    , Accepted 8th September 2014First published on 9th September 2014Abstract(Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz) (y ≤ 0.10; z ≤ 0.15) solid solutions have been investigated for their electronic structure and visible light photocatalytic activity, and a correlation was found between them. (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz) with ZnO as the major component have been synthesized by a solution combustion method in 10 minutes using simple raw materials. The local structures of Zn K edge and Ga K edge, and changes in the chemical environment with the incorporation of Ga and N in ZnO were determined by EXAFS study. EXAFS and XRD results suggested the dissolution of GaN in the ZnO lattice. The homogeneity of the solid solution was demonstrated from HRTEM studies. Photoluminescence studies revealed the creation of a new band at the top of the ZnO valence band (VB), and thus the broadening of the VB of (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz) or a decrease in the band gap was attributed to the origin of visible light absorption. UV-Vis spectral studies showed light absorption up to 550 nm, which directly supports the VB broadening. Predominant oxygen vacancies and high photocorrosion observed for ZnO were fully suppressed for (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz), indicating the minimization of defects, and thus more sustainability under irradiation conditions. The bare solid solution exhibited reasonable and promising activity for solar hydrogen evolution and photoelectrochemical current generation at 0 V. The present work explained factors such as the preparation method, single phase structure with the stabilization of integral parts, homogeneity in the structure, compensation of oxygen vacancies, and suppression of the density of recombination centres that play a pivotal role in realizing solar energy harvesting.
1. Introduction
The development of visible-light active photocatalytic systems has gained significant attention in the field of semiconductor photocatalysis towards solar harvesting.1 Generally, light absorption in the entire visible light range and the effective utilization of photogenerated charge carriers are the prime features expected in a desired photocatalyst for most of the photocatalytic applications. With regards to this, imparting visible light absorption to catalytically potent wide band gap semiconductors, such as TiO2, ZnO, TaO2 and ZrO2 has received wide research interest.2 Band gap engineering is considered to be an indispensable way of extending visible light absorption in wide band gap semiconductors, leading to new hybrid materials, namely oxynitrides, oxysulphides, solid solutions, and quantum dot integrated materials.3–6 Among all the classes of hybrid materials, solid solutions are ideal for the structural and electronic integration of active components. The integration aspect of solid solutions allows the advantages of composition tunable absorption,7 least defect densities, long standing stability,8 and easy flow of charge carriers6 that are essential for solar harvesting.
Solid solutions comprised of metal oxides and metal nitrides, as integral structural parts, are attracting great interest for applications in photocatalytic water splitting as well as H2 generation. Domen et al. developed GaN:ZnO solid solutions with a predominant Ga-content, exhibiting a different visible light absorption with respect to the precursors (GaN or ZnO).9 The absorption features and cooperative performance of the solid solution with cocatalyst for visible light driven photocatalytic H2 generation have motivated research interest in developing solid solutions, such as (GaN:ZnO),9,10 (ZnO:InN)11 and (ZnO:GeN).12
In this report, we demonstrate (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz) solid solution as a visible light photocatalyst and investigated the bulk structure–property relationship for evolving virgin photocatalytic activity and/or photocurrent generation. A solution combustion method (SCM) was employed for the synthesis of solid solutions. The adopted method affords rapid synthesis, viability, effective nitridation conditions, and a high degree of reproducibility. To realize effective charge utilization, structures promoting the fast conduction of photogenerated charge carriers and catalytic active sites are necessary. ZnO, which is well known for fast electron conduction and catalytic potential, was preferably chosen to be the major structural part and GaN was chosen to be the minor structural part. Taking advantage of the similar lattice structure and matching lattice parameters, the formation of a solid solution is favoured. (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz) solid solutions with varying Ga and N concentrations were prepared and all the compositions showed visible light absorption extending up to 550 nm. Despite the salient features of the precursors, ZnO and GaN, the advancement is severely hindered by native defects, such as oxygen/nitrogen vacancies, causing detrimental effects on the photostability13 and sustainable performance. According to the literature, the diffusion of Ga from bulk to surface under ambient conditions leads to the formation of impure phases as recombination centres. Therefore, it is essential to understand the local structure of Zn and Ga, and the chemical environment of nitrogen and oxygen in the present solid solution. An investigation of the bulk structure property relationship is of prime importance to address and alleviate the limiting factors for developing new photocatalysts.14,15
To demonstrate the photoconversion efficiency of the as-synthesized solid solution, we carried out photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting and solar hydrogen generation without a cocatalyst. The (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz) solid solution exhibits promising current generation at 0 V under simulated sunlight with AM1.5 filter. It also shows reasonable photocatalytic activity towards visible light driven hydrogen evolution. This work is a part of ongoing efforts in our laboratories to understand the visible light driven photocatalysis.5,6,10,11,16–18
2. Experimental section
2.1. Material synthesis
SCM was adopted using urea as a fuel. Gallium nitrate (from Sigma Aldrich), zinc nitrate and urea (both from Merck) were used without further purification. Urea/(Zn + Ga) molar ratio was kept constant at 5. The required amounts of zinc nitrate hexahydrate, gallium nitrate hydrate and urea were dissolved in 10 ml of water and stirred to form a homogenous solution. The homogenous solution was kept inside a muffle furnace; its temperature was maintained at 500 °C. A voluminous combustion process occurred after the water boiled off in the first few minutes, leading to the formation of (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz). Depending on the composition, the color of the material varied from bright yellow to dark yellow. The material preparation can be completed within 10 minutes, which was confirmed at least fifty times in different batches to prove the high reproducibility. The material remained stable at ambient conditions for a period of about one year under typical laboratory conditions. The codes of the materials are given as ZGy; Z and G represent zinc and gallium that are followed by a numeral y, which indicates the Ga content in mol%. The material prepared without gallium was ZnO0.914N0.086, which is denoted as UZ5.5
2.2. Characterization methods
PANalytical X′pert Pro dual goniometer X-ray diffractometer was used to record powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the ZGy and UZ5 materials. A step size of 0.02° at a scan rate of 0.5° min−1 was maintained to collect the data. The sample was rotated throughout the scan for better counting statistics. The radiation used was Cu-Kα (1.5418 Å) with Ni filter and the data collection was carried out using a flat holder in Bragg–Brentano geometry (0.2°). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) of ZGy was carried out using a FEI TECNAI 3010 electron microscope operating at 300 kV (Cs = 0.6 mm, resolution = 1.7 Å). The powder form of the samples was dispersed in isopropanol and deposited onto a gold coated carbon grid. The powder material was mixed with spectral-grade BaSO4, well pressed in the sample holder, and then it was subjected to room temperature UV-Vis absorption measurements in solid form using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Model UV-2550) with a 5 nm slit width. BaSO4 was used as the reference material. The solid powder was pressed and the photoluminescence (PL) measurements were obtained with a Photon Technology International spectrophotometer equipped with a Hg–Cd source at room temperature. An excitation wavelength of 330 nm photons was used for all the materials. To maintain uniformity with the absorption experiments, the slit width was maintained at 5 nm in PL measurements.
2.3. EXAFS studies
The EXAFS measurements were carried out under the dispersive EXAFS beamline (BL-8) in transmission mode at the INDUS-2 Synchrotron Source (2.5 GeV, 100 mA) at Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore, India.19–21 The beamline uses a 460 mm long Si(111) crystal having 2d value equal to 6.2709 Å, mounted on an elliptical bender, which can bend the crystal to take the shape of an ellipse. The crystal was first set in such a fashion that the central portion makes the proper Bragg angle θ0 with respect to the incident beam and it selects the energy E0 corresponding to the absorption edge of interest. Due to the divergent nature of the synchrotron beam, the angle of incidence varies from (θ0 − Δθ) at one end of the crystal to (θ0 + Δθ) at the other end; therefore, a band of energy of E0 + ΔE was selected by the crystal, which then falls on the sample due to the elliptical bending of the crystal. The elliptical optics offers the minimum aberration. The radiation transmitted through the sample was detected by a position-sensitive CCD detector with 2048 × 2048 pixels. A plot of the absorption versus photon energy was obtained by recording the intensities I0 and IT, as the CCD outputs, with and without the sample, respectively. The absorption coefficient was obtained using the following relation: IT = I0e−μx(1)where x is the thickness of the absorber. Thus, using the above beamline, the full EXAFS spectrum of the sample at any specified absorption edge can be obtained in the form of a single shot within a time frame of 300 ms. Samples of appropriate weight, estimated to obtain a reasonable edge jump, were taken in powder form and thoroughly mixed with cellulose powder to obtain a total weight of 100 mg and homogenous pellets of 15 mm diameter were prepared using an electrically operated hydraulic press. The Zn K-edge and Ga K-edge XAS measurements were performed. For the present measurement, a Si(111) crystal was set at an appropriate Bragg angle to obtain a band of energy around 9659 or 10367 eV at Zn K-edge or Ga K-edge, respectively for the EXAFS measurements. Zn and Ga filters were used for the calibration of CCD channels for the Zn K-edge measurements, while for the Ga K-edge measurements, Ga and Ge filters were used. To control the oscillations in the absorption spectra, μ(E) was converted to absorption function χ(E) defined as follows:22 (2)where E0 is the absorption edge energy, μ0(E0) is the bare atom background and Δμ0(E0) is the step in μ(E) value at the absorption edge. The energy dependent absorption coefficient χ(E) was converted to the wave number dependent absorption coefficient χ(k) using the relation, (3)where m is the electron mass. χ(k) is weighted by k2 to amplify the oscillation at height k and the χ(k)k2 functions are Fourier transformed in R space to generate the χ(R) versus R spectra in terms of the real distances from the centre of the absorbing atom. The set of EXAFS data analysis available in IFEFFIT software package was used for EXAFS data analysis.23 This includes background reduction and Fourier transform to derive the χ(R) versus R spectra from the absorption spectra (using ATHENA software), generation of the theoretical EXAFS spectra starting from an assumed crystallographic structure, and finally fitting the experimental data with the theoretical spectra using ARTEMIS software. The structural parameters (atomic coordination and lattice parameters) of ZnO, Ga2O3 and GaN used to simulate the theoretical EXAFS spectra of the samples were obtained from the values that are reported in the literature.24
2.4. Photocatalytic H2 generation study
30 mg of UZ5 or any ZGy material was suspended in 20 ml of an aqueous reactant solution containing 4 ml of methanol dissolved in 16 ml of water. The suspended solution was placed in an air tight 50 ml round bottom flask and irradiated with visible light from an Oriel instruments solar simulator equipped with a 300 watt xenon arc lamp system and a 400 nm cut off filter as the irradiation source.6 The product gas mixture was periodically analyzed by gas chromatography instrument (GC) equipped with the TCD detector (Agilent 7890) for quantitative analysis.
2.5. Photocurrent generation studies
PEC studies, by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry, on the ZGy materials were carried out using Gamry potentiostat instrument (Model 3000 Potentiostat/Galvanostat/ZRA) in a conventional three-electrode test cell with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and platinum foil as the counter electrode in a 0.5 M aqueous solution of lithium perchlorate having a neutral pH (pH-7.3), as the supporting electrolyte medium. The temperature (25 °C) was maintained constant throughout the experiment. ZGy coated on an FTO plate was used as the working photoelectrode. The plates were thoroughly cleaned in acetone and dried. The powder slurry prepared by dispersing 5 mg of material in 1 ml of isopropanol was drop casted onto the electrode surface and dried at room temperature. This electrode was used as the working electrode for all the electrochemical studies. The irradiation source was an Oriel instruments 300 watt Xenon arc lamp that was adapted with various filters to cut-off at different wavelengths. The LSV measurements were recorded from −0.5 V to 0.5 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under the light irradiation and dark conditions. The chronoamperometry measurements were recorded at 0 V using the same irradiation source and with the above mentioned filters. The photocurrent remained constant over the entire period of the shutter opening, demonstrating that current generation is simply because of the photofunctional response of (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz). The solar energy conversion efficiency for the ZG8 material was evaluated using the conventional formula given as follows:IPCE = 1240 × I mA cm−2/cut-off λ nm × J mW cm−2where I denotes the current density at 0 V in the chronoamperometry measurements with respect to the incident wavelength. Using the cut-off filters (Oriel instruments) the incident wavelength was varied. J indicates the irradiance power of the flux incident on the sample.
3. Results and discussion
XRD
XRD diffraction pattern of ZGy materials along with reference ZnO is shown in Fig. 1. The XRD patterns of the materials showed similarity with that of the precursor ZnO, indicating the retention of the wurtzite structure. The sharp feature of the peak represents the high crystallinity of the materials. No peak was observed for Ga2O3 or other carbonate species. However, a marginal peak shift to a higher angle was observed for all diffraction features with the incorporation of Ga and N. The inset in Fig. 1 shows a shift in the (101) diffraction feature. The observation of a peak shift to a higher angle without an impure phase is indicative of solid solution formation and marginal lattice contraction.

EXAFS studies
To understand the local structure of the Ga K edge and Zn K edge, EXAFS measurements were performed on the UZ5 and ZGy materials with different Ga contents. An EXAFS near absorption edge study examines the oxidation state and coordination geometry of the absorbing atom. Fig. 2 shows the normalized EXAFS spectra for solid solutions, as denoted as UZ5Gy, which was measured at the Zn K-edge along with the EXAFS spectrum of ZnO as reference. The normalized EXAFS spectra measured at the Zn K edge for nitrogen-doped ZnO (ZnO1−zNz) materials are given in the ESI-1.† In both series of materials, the edge position of the lattice Zn showed a +2 oxidation state and coordination geometry relating to wurtzite structure, which is identical with respect to bulk ZnO. In the present method of preparation, nitrogen incorporation is accomplished during the growth of zinc oxo clusters, and the same plays a key role for Ga co-incorporation. Therefore, the changes in the lattice parameters of N-incorporated.

ZnO and ZGy, compared to virgin ZnO, were expected. To understand the changes in the local environment of lattice Zn, the χ(R) versus R spectra were generated for the nitrogen-doped ZnO samples from μ(E) versus E spectra following the methodology that is described in the Experimental section. The bond distances, co-ordination numbers (including scattering amplitudes) and disorder (Debye–Waller) factors (σ2), which give the mean square fluctuations in the distances, were used as fitting parameters to attain the best fit χ(R) versus R spectra for all the materials. The best fit values for the bond distances, co-ordination numbers and D–W factor of the first three paths, which contribute significantly to the 1st and 2nd peak in the normalized spectra of UZ1 and UZ5, are shown in Table S1 in ESI-2,† along with the corresponding theoretical values for bulk ZnO as a reference. The bond lengths of the Zn–O and Zn–Zn second and third shell distances were relatively low in the case of nitrogen doped ZnO than that of the bulk ZnO. The bond length of Zn–O decreased with increasing N content in the materials. The above observations agree with the results presented by Mapa et al.,5 where lattice contraction of ZnO on N doping was observed because of the higher covalency of Zn–N bonds compared to Zn–O bonds. The covalent character increased with increase in the N doping concentration and the same result was correlated with the EXAFS result. Another observation was that the coordination of oxygen site decreased with N doping, whereas that of Zn site increased. This observation demonstrates nitrogen incorporation at the expense of oxygen vacancies, supporting the plausible mechanism.
In the case of solid solutions, the local structure analysis of incorporated Ga is also essential because Ga plays a major role in stabilizing the incorporated N as nitride form.5,10 The normalized EXAFS spectra of solid solutions measured at the Ga K edge is shown in Fig. 3, along with Ga2O3 as a reference. The edge position of incorporated Ga showed +3 oxidation state in the solid solutions. The oxidation state of Ga remains same in both chemical forms: GaN and Ga2O3. To confirm the coordination geometry and chemical environment of Ga in the ZnO lattice, structural models of monoclinic Ga2O3,23 hexagonal GaN23 and ZnO models23 were used to generate the theoretical EXAFS spectra for fitting purposes. The structural parameters (atomic coordination and lattice parameters) of wurtzite ZnO, GaN and Ga2O3 used for the simulation of theoretical EXAFS spectra were obtained from the reported values in the literature.23,24 It should be noted that the Fourier transformed data up to only the 1st shell was considered here. In the first place, the simulations of theoretical EXAFS spectra of the materials were obtained assuming that a few Zn atoms in the wurtzite ZnO lattice are replaced by Ga atoms.
 Fig. 3  Normalised EXAFS spectra of (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz) materials at Ga K-edge along with that of Ga2O3 reference. 
The best fit theoretical χ(R) versus R spectra using the above models are shown in Fig. 4. The best fit was obtained when the GaN (wurtzite) structure was used instead of the other two models. The correlation between the theoretical GaN model and the experimental result substantiate the presence of GaN. The co-ordination number of Ga in GaN is 4, whereas the coordination number of Ga in Ga2O3 is 6. Because the incorporated Ga has a co-ordination number of 4, GaN form in the ZnO lattice is evident. The Fourier transform calculation involves the averaging out of the local environments throughout the lattice, and thus uniformity in the presence of GaN form throughout ZnO lattice was revealed. It was also observed that as the Ga and N content increases, the central atom (Ga) coordination approached to hexagonal GaN structure. This observation significantly shows that Ga in the solid solution is present in the GaN form.
 Fig. 4  Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra of (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz) (ZGy series) at Ga K-edge (scatter points) and theoretical fit (solid line). GaN model (left panels) is used as a fitting model for (a) ZG5 (b) ZG8 (c) ZG10, whereas the right panels show the fit with the Ga2O3 model. 
The variation of the Zn–O and Zn–Zn bond lengths, coordination number and disorder (Debye–Waller) factors with the respective R-factor as a function of the Ga concentration in the solid solutions are given in Table 1 and Fig. 5. The Zn–O bond length for the ZGy series of the samples are lower than that of bulk ZnO, and first and second Zn–Zn/Ga shell bond lengths are indicated in green and red colours, respectively, which are found to reduce with increasing Ga content. Similar fitted values for UZ5 along with corresponding theoretical values for bulk ZnO are also given. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the Zn–O and Zn–Zn bond lengths of the ZGy compositions are relatively lower than bulk ZnO (Table 1). The bond length of Zn–O decreases with increasing nitrogen content. The EXAFS result is in agreement with the Rietveld refinement study on (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz) materials,10 which revealed a marginal decrease in the lattice parameters of solid solutions with respect to ZnO. Because the size of the Ga is smaller than Zn, marginal lattice contraction is expected, when Ga in the form of GaN is constituted in ZnO lattice. The strong affinity of Ga towards nitrogen and structural similarity between GaN and ZnO facilitates the formation of solid solution.

HRTEM
HRTEM measurements were carried out for ZGy materials and the representative results are shown in Fig. 6. This is mainly to explore the homogeneity of the solid solutions and the microstructural level as well as the change in morphology. Fig. 6 shows the morphology of the material for the ZG5 and ZG2 compositions and lattice planes of the solid solution along with the SAED pattern. The predominant hexagonal structure observed in the TEM results confirms the hexagonal wurtzite structure. The (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz) possess a corrugated structure on the surface because of the evolution of gases during SCM synthesis. Such surface corrugated structure was reported to enhance the light scattering25 and anchoring of the co-catalyst.1,16
 Fig. 6  HRTEM results obtained for (a–b) UZ5G2 and (c–d) UZ5G8 solid solution. A uniform d100-value, which is in between ZnO (0.282 nm) and GaN (0.275 nm), obtained over large area underscores the solid solution nature. The corrugated structure observed at the edges in panel c indicates the easy anchoring of the co-catalysts. 
An enhancement in light scattering will assist in the penetration and interaction of incident photons with the material; thus, the population of photogenerated charge carriers will be increased. The lattice planes are analyzed using statistical line profile analysis for calculating the interplanar d-spacing value of the solid solutions, and the corresponding d values are given in the respective image. The d100 value of the material is in between that of bulk ZnO (0.282 nm) and GaN (0.275 nm).6 The intermediate d-spacing values of the materials with respect to the parent ZnO and GaN materials demonstrate the solid solution formation. The appearance of uniform lattice fringes without any abrupt interface indicates the homogeneity of a solid solution assisting in the easy flow of charge carriers. Fig. 6d shows a SAED pattern from which the calculated d-spacing is in good agreement with the earlier calculated value. The homogenous distribution of GaN nanoclusters in the ZnO lattice is an essential feature for evolving the electronic integration between GaN and ZnO components.

Light absorption and emission studies. 
UV-Visible absorption studies were carried out for the solid solutions and the corresponding results are given in Fig. 7a. The inset in Fig. 7a shows a digital photograph of the powder form of the solid solutions for the actual colour variations. Upon solid solution formation, the colour of the material becomes intense yellow, which is completely different from the colourless ZnO. The absorption spectra of the solid solutions extend into the visible light regime, where the absorption edge onsets between 550 and 600 nm; this is in total contrast to the absorption edge of ZnO precursor at 370 nm. The extended visible light absorption and the bright colour associated with the solid solutions indicate the changes in the electronic structure of the solid solutions from that of the parent materials ZnO and GaN.
 Fig. 7  Room temperature study of (a) absorption, (b) photoluminescence of ZGy with different Ga contents. (c) Possible band-gap reduction is shown with N 2p states overlapping with O 2p band in (ii) solid solution. (i) ZnO band structure is shown for comparison. 
Room temperature PL studies were performed on the ZGy materials to obtain more information on the electronic structure. Fig. 7b shows the emission spectra of the solid solutions with different Ga contents along with ZnO (in inset). According to the literature, the near band edge emission of ZnO, which is the precursor of the solid solution appear at 375 nm.26 In the emission spectra of the ZGy materials, a sharp peak with very low intensity at 375 nm is observed. A decrease in the intensity of the near band edge emission of the materials indicates VB broadening to support the visible light absorption (Fig. 7a). The phenomenon of VB broadening shifts the VB edge towards a lower positive potential (compared to ZnO), resulting in a band gap reduction. Two intense peaks at 420 and 440 nm are observed and those peaks are attributed to the formation of new acceptor levels due to nitride incorporation.27 This result provides additional supportive evidence for VB broadening, which occurs due to the mixing of N 2p states of nitride with O 2p bands at the top of VB. Another observation from the peaks is that intensity of the peaks at 420 and 440 nm increases with increasing Ga concentration. This indicates that the co-incorporation of Ga with N increases the solubility of the latter in the ZnO lattice. Interestingly, the broad emission feature centered on 525 nm in ZnO is completely absent in the case of the ZGy solid solutions. The above emission feature at 525 nm is ascribed to oxygen vacancies, which is responsible for deleterious photocorrosion in ZnO.28 The absence of broad emission in the green region of the solid solutions highlights the anti-photocorrosive nature of the material with the compensation of oxygen vacancies by effective nitride incorporation.29 After corroborating the absorption and emission results, a formation of new energy band overlapping with the top level of the VB was revealed. This phenomenon results in VB broadening, leading notable band gap reduction to 2.4 eV, which further causes visible light absorption in the material. The schematic representation of VB broadening is illustrated in Fig. 7c that explains the origin of the visible light absorption of the material. It should also be noted that the fully filled Zn 3d band, which is well below the VB in ZnO30 (∼6 eV), as well as in the solid solution of InN in ZnO, remains at the same energy levels.11 It is unlikely that Zn 3d bands may have any influence in the VB broadening in ZGy, especially in view of the fully filled orbital.


Photocatalytic applications. 
(a) Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. 
ZGy materials were evaluated to be a sacrificial agent for visible light (λ > 400 nm) driven photocatalytic hydrogen generation from aqueous methanol (20%). Experimental conditions for hydrogen evolution are given in the Experimental section, and the corresponding results are tabulated in Table 2. The hydrogen evolution rate increases with increase in the Ga content of the solid solution. This is because visible light absorbance increases to a higher wavelength with increase in the Ga content, and thus the availability and absorption of incident photons increases. When there is more absorption of incident photons with different photon energies, the rate of hydrogen evolution also increases. In contrast, the related solid solution photocatalyst shows negligible activity towards visible light driven hydrogen evolution without a cocatalyst.9a,13 The use of a noble metal co-catalyst with a special core–shell morphology increased the activity to 2 mmol h−1 g−1 of H2 evolution.9b The present solid solution enables H2 evolution without any cocatalyst.9,12 The virgin catalyst activity is attributed to the improved catalytic sites with the maximum ZnO content and the suppressed defect densities, such as oxygen vacancies and impure phases.

(b) Visible light driven photocurrent generation. 
The true efficiency of water splitting was further validated by current generation through PEC measurements31 and PEC studies of (Zn1−yGay)(O1−zNz) under visible light irradiation were successfully demonstrated. Fig. 8 shows the LSV of the solid solutions with Ga concentrations ranging from 2% to 8% under visible light irradiation at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1. There was a marked increase in photocurrent generation from the solid solutions, about 30 times higher than ZnO, and the current density of the solid solutions increased with increasing Ga content. The enhancement in photocurrent generation was primarily attributed to the effective visible light absorption as well as the utilization of charge carriers towards current generation. The solid solution with the maximum ZnO and minimum GaN content provides a suitable structure for the fast conduction of photogenerated charge carriers. The presence of the GaN form also plays a pivotal role in suppressing recombination centers, such as oxygen vacancies, and in furnishing the energy overlapping of N 2p with O 2p bands. Chronoamperometry experiments were carried out at 0 V using a solar simulator using different cut-off filters (visible band pass filter for 370–770 nm, 400, 455, and 515 nm), and the results are shown in Fig. 9. There is visible light current generation by the solid solution even at a longer wavelength of 510 nm and the performance remained sustainable over a period of time in several cycles of the experiment. For shutter opening and closing, the sharp changes in photocurrent generation demonstrated the photofunctional behaviour of the ZGy solid solutions.

The solar energy conversion efficiency for the ZG8, which is calculated as elaborated in Experimental section 2.5. The calculated incident photon conversion efficiency for ZG8 varied from 4.1% (380 nm), 2.5% (A.M 1.5 filter), 0.84% (400 nm), to 0.41% (455 nm) with different cut-off wavelengths as mentioned in the respective brackets.

4. Conclusions
The present work brings out the vital structural features of the solid solution responsible for the photocatalytic activity and photocurrent generation, and in general solar light harvesting. The SCM preparation method provides effective nitridation conditions by producing a large quantity of in situ ammonia, resembling high flux ammonia conditions, which involved in forming GaN and interacting with the growing zinc oxo nano clusters with oxygen vacancies. The suppression of oxygen vacancies with the incorporation of Ga and N also plays a crucial role in enhancing the photostability of the material. The EXAFS study revealed the local structure of incorporated Ga in the form of GaN with hexagonal coordination to be homogeneously distributed in ZnO lattice, as evident from HRTEM study. The presence of GaN form assists in minimizing the oxygen vacancies in the ZnO lattice. Light absorption and emission studies support the valence band broadening for being the prime reason for the visible light absorption by the ZGy solid solutions. Homogeneity in the solid solution structure plays a major role in exhibiting promising visible light absorption, photocurrent generation and virgin catalytic activity for hydrogen generation.
