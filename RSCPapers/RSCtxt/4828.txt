    , Accepted 7th January 2015First published on 8th January 2015AbstractA new cathode interlayer (CIL) material metallophthalocyanine (MPc) derivative 1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octaoctyloxy-2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octa-[N-methyl-(3-pyridyloxy)] zinc-ylphthalocyanine iodide (1:8) (ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8) was synthesized and applied in polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PTB7:PC71BM (PTB7 = thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene, PC71BM = [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acidmethyl ester), P3HT:PC61BM (P3HT = poly(3-hexylthiophene), PC61BM = [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acidmethyl ester) or PCDTBT:PC71BM (PCDTBT = poly[N-9′′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]) as an active layer. As a result, power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of the PSCs were 8.52%, 4.02% and 6.88%, respectively, which are much higher than those of corresponding PSCs with the Al-only cathode. It indicates that ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 is a new promising candidate as a universal CIL for highly efficient PSCs. Compared to VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 (2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octakis-[N-methyl-(3-pyridyloxy)] vanadylphthalocyanine iodide (1:8)), the PSC with ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL has higher short-circuit current and fill factor because ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 can form a better, denser, and more uniform film on the active layer than VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 as demonstrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy-dispersive spectrum mapping on scan electron microscopy (SEM-EDS mapping) and contact angle measurements.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn great attention owing to their key advantages of synthetic variability, light weight, low cost, large-area roll-to-roll fabrication and the lucrative possibility of integration directly into flexible devices.1 Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rapidly increased to efficiencies of over 9% with good ambient stability for single-cell devices.2 One efficient strategy to achieve such a high efficiency was the application of an alcohol/water soluble cathode interlayer (CIL) in the PSCs.2a–c This kind of CIL was first used as an electron-injection layer in polymer light-emitting diodes3 and then applied to organic field-effect transistors4 and recently in PSCs.2a–c,5,6 Current reports of CILs improving device performance mainly consist of polymers5 and organic small molecules.6 Most alcohol/water-soluble polymer CILs have been designed and synthesized based on fluorine units with alcohol/water-soluble groups.2a–c,5a–i Some alcohol/water-soluble polymers based on trimethylammoniumhexylthiophene have also been used as CILs to construct highly efficient PSCs.5j,k In addition, some organic small molecules were utilized as CILs in the PSCs as well.6 Successful alcohol/water-soluble, small molecular CILs include fullerene derivatives,6a–d perylene diimides,6e,f porphyrin,6g pyridinium salt,6h rhodamine with inner salt,6i quinacridone tethered with sodium sulfonate,6j triphenylamine-uorene core featuring a phosphonate side chain,6k tetra-n-alkyl ammonium bromides,6l metallophthalocyanine (MPc) derivative7 and so on. Compared to polymers, small molecules have advantages of well-defined structures, high purity without batch-to-batch variation and easy modification. However, it is more difficult for alcohol/water-soluble small molecular CILs to form a high-quality uniform film than polymer CIL, and in particular on the hydrophobic active layer.
For fabrication of PSCs with CIL by solution processing, to prevent intermixing between the active layer and the interlayer, the active layer must be sufficiently resistant against the solvent used for the CIL (conventional PSCs) or the CIL must be sufficiently resistant against the solvent used for the active layer (inverted PSCs). Because the active layers were prepared by weak polar organic solvents and are highly hydrophobic, the CIL materials must be easily soluble in strongly polar solvents such as water or alcohol and are often greatly hydrophilic. The wettability of CIL materials on the surface of the active layer is often very poor and with the terms reversed. Based on the above premise, it is very hard to prepare uniform, thin CIL on the top surface of the active layer. However, it is essential to construct a continuous, stable and well-distributed dipole layer (CIL) between the active layer and cathode for highly efficient PSCs. More importantly, the CIL should be endowed with characteristics that can promote electric and physical contact between the active layer and metal cathode. The design and synthesis of CIL materials that can uniformly form electrical and physical adhesion between the active layer and metal cathode remains a great challenge for further improving the PCE of PSCs.
Recently we reported a water-soluble MPc with pyridine salts, VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 (Fig. 1(a)), as a CIL leading to simultaneous enhancement in open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of PSCs. As a result, a PCE of 8.12% for the working areas of 2 × 2 mm2 and a PCE of 7.23% for the working areas of 4 × 4 mm2 have been achieved. However, VOPc(OPyCH3I)8-treated surface of PTB7:PC71BM blend showed a rough morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 9.34 nm. Notably, there are some visible islands distributed over the surface. The formation mechanism of the islands may be the self-aggregation of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 itself due to its high polarity and adverse wettability of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 aqueous solution on the hydrophobic active layer. Moreover, we found that RMS roughness of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8-treated surface of PTB7:PC71BM increased over time.7 Such a rough morphology is usually unfavorable for the device efficiency, especially for Jsc, FF and stability. Therefore, it is necessary to improve film formation of alcohol/water soluble small molecular CILs on hydrophobic active layer in order to further increase device performance of the PSCs.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of (a) VOPc(OPyCH3I)8, (b) ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8, and (c) device configuration of PSCs with a CIL. Differences between (a) and (b) are highlighted in red. 
In this contribution, a new CIL material α-alkoxy-substituted MPc derivative ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 was intentionally synthesized by introducing eight alkoxy chains on the rigid skeleton as shown in Fig. 1(b). Such chemical modification provides the molecule with an ideal balance between solubility in the polar solvent and adhesive property on the active layer surface. High conformational flexibility of the alkoxy chains affords the MPc derivative sufficient solubility in alcohol and hardly any in water, which makes it possess better wettability on the hydrophobic active layers. The abundant flexible alkoxy chains attached to the centre core of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 promote uniform film formation on the underlying organic layer. It was demonstrated that methanol/ethanol treatment can improve the performance of the PSCs due to passivation of surface traps and a corresponding increase of surface charge density in the active layer.8 Therefore, a further enhanced PCE would be expected by spin-coating a ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 solution in methanol/ethanol on the active layer.
2. Results and discussion
Detailed UV/vis absorption spectra and electrochemical properties of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 are shown in the ESI.† We used ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL in the PSCs based on a blend of PTB7 and PC71BM as an active layer and Al as a cathode. Device architecture is presented in Fig. 1(c).
ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 can be well dissolved in alcohol (methanol or ethanol) while its solubility in other common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene is very poor. The optimized concentration of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 in methanol was 0.8 mg mL−1. For comparison, two control devices without (device 1) and with (device 2) methanol treatment at the interlayer between the PTB7:PC71BM and Al were fabricated. Fig. 2 presents current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the two control devices and the PSCs with ∼5 nm ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL (device 3) under AM 1.5-G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. J–V curves of the three devices in the dark are presented in Fig. 3. Table 1 summarizes the device performance parameters derived from Fig. 2. Intriguingly, the PCE of device 3 with the ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL can reach 8.52%, which is higher than not only the two control devices but also the PCE (8.12%) of device R with ∼5 nm VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL.7 Compared to the two control devices, introduction of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 between the active layer and cathode results in a simultaneous enhancement in Voc, Jsc, and FF. Moreover, device 3 has even higher Jsc and FF than device R. The results should be attributed to an excellent film-forming property of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 on the active layer by spin-coating the solution of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 in methanol. In order to ensure the validity and repeatability of data, we measured at least 30 pixels (size = 2 × 2 mm2) for all device configurations. The average PCE values of devices 1–3 are 5.06%, 6.51%, and 8.46%, respectively. In order to detect a discrepancy of Jsc, which easily leads to overvalued PCE,9 external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices 1–3 from 350 nm to 800 nm were carried out and are shown in Fig. 4. Jsc values calculated from integration of the EQE spectra are 13.93 mA cm−2 for device 1, 15.11 mA cm−2 for device 2 and 16.47 mA cm−2 for device 3, which are in good agreement with Jsc = 13.98 mA cm−2 of device 1 (ca. 0.3% error), Jsc = 15.34 mA cm−2 of device 2 (ca. 1.5% error) and Jsc = 16.88 mA cm−2 of device 3 (ca. 2.4% error) obtained from J–V characteristics under illumination. It indicates that the Jsc values measured for the PSCs are reliable and PCE values presented in this manuscript are not overvalued.

 Fig. 4  EQE spectra of the device 1 (black line), device 2 (red line) and device 3 (blue line). 
Under illumination, device 3 with ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL showed a Voc of 0.738 V, which is higher than the control devices with (Voc = 0.715 V, device 2) and without (Voc = 0.679 V, device 1) methanol treatment. The increase in Voc can be mainly attributed to the reduced work function (WF) of the Al cathode. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopic (UPS) measurements were carried out with monochromatized HeI radiation at 21.2 eV. WF is defined by secondary electron cutoff in the UPS spectra of Al, Al treated by methanol and Al covered by ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 as shown in Fig. S3.† As a result, the WF values were 4.12 eV for bare Al, 3.55 eV for Al treated by methanol and 3.32 eV for Al covered by ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8. Unsurprisingly, the Voc of device 3 was almost the same with the Voc of the device R due to a close WF value (3.30 eV) for Al covered by VOPc(OPyCH3I)8. The increased Voc was consistent with the increased built-in potential across devices with CIL. This speculation can be supported by the dark J–V characteristics of devices in Fig. 3. In the dark, devices 3 exhibit a turn-on voltage around 0.78 V while they are around 0.76 V for device 2 and 0.71 V for device 1. It suggests that the built-in voltage (Vbi) (here considered as the flat-band condition) of the devices increase when introducing ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL or methanol treatment. Because Vbi influences the internal electric field in polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells and gives the upper limit for the Voc provided that the WF difference of electrodes is larger than the donor HOMO–acceptor LUMO offset of the BHJ. Thus the increase of Vbi may be responsible for the increase in Voc in the devices 3 and 2.
In order to confirm that introducing ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 film not only enhances electron transport but also facilitates a balance of electron and hole transport in the PSCs, the mobilities of electron and hole were measured in the electron-only and hole-only devices using space charge limited current (SCLC) method (details and parameters in Fig. S4a, b and Table S2†). The mobilities of electron and hole for the devices without any treatment at the interlayer between the PTB7:PC71BM and Al are 1.35 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. However, the mobilities of electron and hole for the devices with ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL are 3.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It is apparent that incorporation of the CIL increases electron mobility up to one order of magnitude and a perfect mobility balance of hole and electron has been achieved.

Table 1 also presents series resistances (Rs) and shunt resistances (Rsh) of the devices obtained from the slops of J–V curves at Voc and Jsc, respectively. Compared to the two control devices and device R, a decrease of Rs and an increase of Rsh are apparent when ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 was utilized as a CIL. More importantly, compared to the device R with VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL, the increases of Jsc and FF of the device 3 are attributed to the resistance changes due to formation of a high-quality uniform film of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 on PTB7:PC71BM.

Fig. 5 shows the surface morphologies obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measured at ambient temperature. The surface of PTB7:PC71BM film is smooth with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.79 nm (Fig. 5(a)). The methanol-treated surface of PTB7:PC71BM was slightly smoother than the pristine film due to RMS roughness of 2.04 nm and remained homogeneous as shown in Fig. 5(b). When a PTB7:PC71BM blend was covered by ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 film, the RMS roughness of the surface becomes 1.91 nm (Fig. 5(c)), which is much smoother than VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 on PTB7:PC71BM, with RMS roughness of 9.34 nm (Fig. 5(d)), and even smoother than pristine and methanol-treated surfaces of PTB7:PC71BM. Moreover, ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 had a better film-forming property on the PTB7:PC71BM blend than famous alcohol soluble polymer PFN, because the RMS roughness of PFN on the PTB7:PC71BM was 3.41 nm (Fig. S5†). Notably, ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 film has solved the problem with sharp island formation of MPc derivatives, for example, VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 on the hydrophobic active layer. We assigned it to the introduction of eight alkoxy chains, which can enhance the compatibility and adhesive characteristics between the active layer and the ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8-based CIL.

In order to further prove that ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 has better film formation and more uniform distribution on the active layer than VOPc(OPyCH3I)8, we detected distributions of metal elements and iodine of the two molecules on the active layer using scanning electronic microscopy-energy dispersive spectrum mapping (SEM-EDS mapping). SEM-EDS mapping images of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 on PTB7:PC71BM film are shown in Fig. 6(a), where the purple dots are zinc (Zn) element, and Fig. 6(b) where the blue dots are iodine (I) element. Fig. 6(c) is a combination of the maps of Zn element in Fig. 6(a) and I element in Fig. 6(b). In the same way, SEM-EDS mapping images of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 on PTB7:PC71BM film are shown in Fig. 6(d), where the yellow dots are vanadium (V) element, and Fig. 6(e), where the blue dots are I element. Fig. 6(f) is a combination of the maps of V element in Fig. 6(d) and I element in Fig. 6(e). Apparently massive dots for elements of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 densely covered the background for PTB7:PC71BM in Fig. 6(c). However, dots for elements of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 were much sparser and a large area of the background was uncovered as shown in Fig. 6(f). It is quite evident that ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 can form a better, denser and more uniform film on the active layer than VOPc(OPyCH3I)8.

SEM-EDS mapping images of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 on PTB7:PC71BM film are shown in (d) where yellow dots are the element vanadium, (e) blue dots iodine, and (f) a combination of (d) and (e). 
In addition, contact angle (θ) measurements were performed in order to investigate polarity of treated surfaces of PTB7:PC71BM film and the wetting property of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 in methanol and VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 in water on PTB7:PC71BM film, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7(a)–(d) show contact angle images of water droplets on the surfaces of PTB7:PC71BM film without and with methanol treatment, covered by ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 and VOPc(OPyCH3I)8, respectively. The water contact angles of the four surfaces are 99.5°, 97.6°, 92.8°, and 55.6°, respectively. It indicates that the treatments of both methanol and ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 only slightly changed the surface polarity of PTB7:PC71BM. The surface of PTB7:PC71BM/ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 was still hydrophobic due to θ ≈ 92.8°. However, the surface of PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 was hydrophilic due to θ ≈ 55.6°. Fig. 7(e)–(g) presents photos of liquid droplets of methanol, ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 in methanol and VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 in water on the surfaces of PTB7:PC71BM. The contact angles of the three liquid droplets are 7.7°, 10.5°, and 88.3°, which strongly suggest that the wetting property of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 in methanol was much better than VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 in water on PTB7:PC71BM film. The contact angle measurements once more provided powerful proof that ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 had a larger potential to form a high-quality film on the active layer than VOPc(OPyCH3I)8.

The surface energy of various films can be calculated based on contact angle measurements according to equations from the “three-liquid acid–base method.”10 Ma et al. obtained the surface energies of ITO, P3HT, PC61BM, P3HT:PC61BM, PCBDAN and P3HT:PC61BM:PCBDAN using the method.11 To further investigate the effect of the two MPc derivatives on surface energy of the active layer, we also carried out advanced contact angle measurements by selecting water, ethylene glycol and hexadecane as probing liquids. Table 2 presents our results for measured contact angles and calculated surface energies and their components. The surface energy of ITO is 38.0 mN m−1, which is similar to the value (40.0 mN m−1) reported by Ma et al.11 The surface energies of PTB7:PC71BM (25.2 mN m−1) and PTB7:PC71BM/ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 (26.1 mN m−1) are quite close to each other. However, the surface energy of PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 changed to 38.7 mN m−1, which is even higher than the one for ITO, although VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 only partially covered PTB7:PC71BM as shown in Fig. 6(f). It proves that ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 had a better wettability and compatibility on the active layer than VOPc(OPyCH3I)8.

Encouraged by successful application of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL in PSCs with the PTB7:PC71BM as an active layer, the MPc derivative was also introduced into the PSCs based on P3HT:PC61BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM to demonstrate its universality acting as a CIL in PSCs. Table 3 provides a summary of device performance parameters derived from J–V curves of devices with P3HT:PC61BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM as the active layer under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5-G illumination (see Fig. S6 and S7†). In the case of P3HT:PC61BM blends, incorporating ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL led to a large increase in PCE from 2.17% (device I) to 4.02% (device II) due to increases of Voc from 0.488 V to 0.604 V, Jsc from 9.22 mA cm−2 to 10.05 mA cm−2, and FF from 48.2% to 66.2%. Similarly, ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL in the PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM gave rise to a simultaneous increase of Voc, Jsc and FF compared to the control device without a CIL. As a result, PCE rose from 5.34% (device III) to 6.88% (device IV).

Finally, ethanol was also employed as a solvent of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 to fabricate PSCs with PTB7:PC71BM as the active layer (see Fig. S8†). For device 4, ethanol treatment was performed at the interlayer between the PTB7:PC71BM and Al, and for device 5 the CIL was prepared from the ethanol solution of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8. The PCEs of devices 4 and 5 were 6.85% and 8.10%, respectively. Parameter details of devices 4 and 5 are listed in Table 1. The ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 film as a CIL prepared from ethanol solution can also remarkably enhance PSC performance. These results suggest a possible approach to fabricate high-performance PSCs with greener solvents.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, a new metallophthalocyanine (MPc) derivative, ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8, has been synthesized and successfully utilized as a CIL in the PSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM, P3HT:PC61BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM. A simultaneous increase of Voc, Jsc and FF resulted in an overall PCE enhancement due to introduction of ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8. As a result, maximum PCE values of the PSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM, P3HT:PC61BM, and PCDTBT:PC71BM were 8.52%, 4.02%, and 6.88%, respectively. It indicated that ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 was a new promising candidate as a CIL for highly efficient PSCs. Compared to VOPc(OPyCH3I)8, ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 realized uniform deposition on the underlying organic layer due to introducing the flexible alkoxy chains. Such a chemical modification can enhance compatibility and adhesive characteristics between the active layer and ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8-based CIL, and meanwhile improve solubility in alcohol. So the interlayer material displayed better wettability on the hydrophobic active layer. For phthalocyanine molecules, the structural modification space is very wide. Therefore, it should be an efficient strategy to improve film formation for highly efficient PSCs.

4.2. Device fabrication and characterization
ITO glass substrates were pre-cleaned carefully and treated with oxygen plasma for 7 min. First, PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) was spin-coated onto a cleaned ITO and annealed in air at 120 °C for 10 min. Second, blend films of active layers were spin-casted from solution on PEDOT:PSS. For P3HT:PC61BM PSCs, the active layer was formed by spin-coating from o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solution consisting of 17 mg mL−1 P3HT and 17 mg mL−1 PC61BM at 500 rpm for 18 s, followed by solvent annealing at room temperature for 2 h, and thermally annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. For PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs, the active layer was formed by spin-coating from the chlorobenzene:o-dichlorobenzene (1:3) solution consisting of 7 mg mL−1 PCDTBT and 28 mg mL−1 PC71BM at 2000 rpm for 40 s, followed by thermally annealing at 75 °C for 10 min. For PTB7:PC71BM PSCs, the active layer was formed by spin-coating from the chlorobenzene:1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 vol%) solution consisting of 10 mg mL−1 PTB7 and 15 mg mL−1 PC71BM, and then dried in vacuum. ZnPc(OC8H17OPyCH3I)8 was deposited on the active layer by spin-coating and then 100 nm Al was evaporated as a cathode. For the electron-only and hole-only devices, device structures were ITO/Al/PTB7:PC71BM/with or without CIL/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/with or without CIL/MoOx/Al, respectively. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under N2 atmosphere in the glove box by using a Keithley 2400 under illumination and in the dark. Solar cell performance was tested under 1 sun, AM 1.5-G full-spectrum solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech., model #SS50AAA-GB) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard silicon photovoltaic traced to the National Institute of Metrology, China. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using the Q Test Station 2000 (Crowntech, USA) at room temperature in air. In addition, the static contact angles of the as-prepared surfaces were measured with a commercial contact angle system (DataPhysics, OCA 20) at ambient temperature. AFM images were measured with an S II Nanonaviprobe station 300 HV (Seiko, Japan) in contact mode. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken with a JEOL FESEM 6700F electron microscope with primary electron energy of 3 kV. Energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) mapping was conducted with Inca X-Max instruments made by Oxford Instruments.
