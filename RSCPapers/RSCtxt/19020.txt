    , Accepted 8th October 2022First published on 15th November 2022AbstractFerric oxide (Fe2O3) is an attractive anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with a high theoretical capacity of 1005 mA h g−1. However, its practical application is greatly restrained by the rapid capacity fading caused by the large volume expansion upon lithiation. To address this issue, we have designed and synthesized a unique yolk–shell Fe2O3/N-doped carbon hybrid structure (YS-Fe2O3@NC) with rich oxygen vacancies for robust lithium storage. The obtained results show that YS-Fe2O3@NC delivers a high reversible capacity of 578 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1, about 11 times that (53.7 mA h g−1) of pristine Fe2O3. Furthermore, a high specific capacity of 300.5 mA h g−1 even at 10 A g−1 is achieved. The high reversible capacities, excellent rate capability and cycle stability of YS-Fe2O3@NC might be attributed to the elaborate yolk–shell nanoarchitecture. Moreover, electron percolation and a local built-in electric field induced by oxygen vacancies in the Fe2O3 matrix could also enhance the kinetics of Li+ insertion/deinsertion.
1. Introduction
For decades, LIBs with high energy and power density have attracted increasing attention owing to their potential applications in large-scale energy storage, backup power devices and hybrid electric vehicles.1–3 Nanostructured transition metal oxides are considered as promising candidates as anode materials for high energy and power density LIBs because of their multiple chemical valence states and various morphological characteristics.4,5 Among numerous anode materials, low-cost and eco-friendly Fe2O3 has been regarded as a promising anode material for LIBs with a high theoretical capacity of 1005 mA h g−1.6,7 Unfortunately, the intrinsically low Li+ mobility, poor electrical conductivity and drastic volume change still remain as challenges that limit their high-rate electrochemical performance in practical applications.8,9 In order to solve these problems, lots of effective strategies have been developed including tuning the structure and morphology at the nanoscale or using carbon-based materials as the buffer layer.10–12 One effective strategy is to synthesize and design yolk–shell nanostructured Fe2O3-based nanomaterials.13,14 With meticulous care design, the hollow interiors can provide enough space to accommodate the intense volume expansion upon lithiation. In addition, the cavity wall provides a short diffusion path, which also enhances the transport of lithium ions. For example, Gu15et al. reported hierarchical nanotubes of α-Fe2O3 as a high performance anode for LIBs, exhibiting a stable capacity of 764.2 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. Zhang16et al. proposed triple-shell hollow α-Fe2O3 microspheres as anodes for LIBs, which retained a stable capacity of 903.6 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Although these strategies could help to facilitate ion transport and release the volume expansion for a partly improved electrochemical performance for LIBs, their lithium storage still suffers from the drawback of poor conductivity.
Vacancies usually impact the physicochemical properties of many semiconducting materials.17,18 Vacancies, which could effectively regulate the electronic structure without fundamentally changing the pristine lattice, would unlock the potential for optimizing the performance of LIBs, especially high-rate capability.19,20 Oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides are significant owing to their role as electron donors.21 For example, Ma et al.22 reported a yolk@shell structure of TiO2@Fe2O3 with oxygen vacancies for LIBs. These oxygen vacancies in Fe2O3 served as shallow donors, and effectively improved the electronic properties of Fe2O3 nanostructures, leading to excellent rate capability and superior cycling stability. The oxygen-vacancies in the Fe2O3 matrix seem to be a non-negligible factor for improving Li+ kinetics in terms of percolation charge transfer and the local built-in electric field. It is believed that the synergetic design of the yolk–shell structure and lattice defects in metal oxides would be a new avenue for improving the electrochemical performances of rechargeable ion batteries in terms of rate capability and cycling stability.
Based on the above analysis, we have designed and synthesized a unique yolk–shell Fe2O3/N-doped carbon with rich oxygen vacancies for robust lithium storage. The as-prepared samples exhibited high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability and ultralong cyclic stability as anode materials for LIBs. When evaluated as an anode for LIBs, the composites delivered a high specific capacity of 300.5 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with coulombic efficiency more than 99%. The as-prepared YS-Fe2O3@NC can be a promising candidate for Li+ storage.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of spindle-like α-Fe2O3
The spindle-like α-Fe2O3 was prepared by aging a solution of 0.02 M FeCl3 and 0.45 mM NaH2PO4 at 98 °C for 24 h.23 After the mixture cools down to room temperature naturally, the dark red precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol a few times, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h.
2.2 Synthesis of Fe2O3@SiO2 composites
For SiO2 coating, 200 mg of α-Fe2O3 spindles was first dispersed by ultrasonication in a mixture consisting of 400 mL of 2-propanol and 40 mL of deionized water, followed by the addition of 50 mL of ammonia (25–28%) and 1 mL of tetraethyl-orthosilicate to the beaker; then the reaction was continued with stirring for 15 h. The overall hydrolysis and condensation reactions are given as follows: Si(C2H5O)4 + 4H2O → Si(OH)4 + 4C2H5OH(1) Si(OH)4 → SiO2↓ + 2H2O(2)
The α-Fe2O3@SiO2 particles were collected by centrifugation, and washed with ethanol and water several times before being dried at 60 °C.
2.3 Synthesis of YS-Fe2O3@NC composites
Typically, 100 mg of Fe2O3@SiO2 spindles were first dispersed into 250 mL tris-buffer solution (pH = 8.5) by ultrasonication for 60 minutes. Then, 80 mg of dopamine hydrochloride (PDA) was added to the above solution, which was stirred continuously for 24 h. The condensation polymerization is given below: (3)
The resultant product Fe2O3@SiO2@PDA was collected through centrifugation and washed several times with absolute ethyl alcohol and deionized water, respectively, and dried at 80 °C overnight. After annealing the particles at 450 °C for 6 h, the silica was dissolved in 250 mL of 1 M NaOH solution at 55 °C for 24 h to yield the YS-Fe2O3@NC nanocomposites with rich oxygen vacancies. The synthetic procedure for the fabrication of YS-Fe2O3@NC is illustrated in Fig. 1.

2.4 Materials characterization
The crystalline phase of the as-prepared Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC composites was investigated by powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD, BRUKER D8 ADVANCE) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The microstructure of Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC composites is further identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TJEOL JEM 2100) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8010) with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests were performed using a Bruker, 300-10-12 Bruker EPR spectrometer at 77 K. The carbon content in the composite is determined by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TG, Netzsch STA449F3) from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an air atmosphere. Nitrogen sorption isotherms are measured using a Micromeritics Tristar 3020 analyzer. Specific surface areas of the as-synthesized Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC powders are calculated according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore size distribution is determined based on the theory of Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BJH). The surface potentials of Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC electrodes are measured by Kelvin probe atomic force microscopy (KPAFM) (Bruker dimension ICON, Germany). The chemical composition and valence states of YS-Fe2O3@NC are analysed using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Scientific). The Raman measurements were performed using a Horiba/Jobin Yvon Raman instrument.
2.5 Cell fabrication and characterization
The electrochemical performances are evaluated using CR2025 half-cells with the Fe2O3 or YS-Fe2O3@NC anode electrode coated on copper foil and lithium foil as a counter electrode. The anode slurry is prepared by mixing 70 wt% active materials with 15 wt% CMC (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) and 15 wt% super-P in a solvent (deionized water). The slurry is then cast onto a copper foil and subsequently dried at 110 °C in vacuum for 12 hours. The resulted laminate is punched into a 12 mm diameter disc and pressed under a pressure of 2.5 MPa. The loading density of Fe2O3 or YS-Fe2O3@NC is ∼1.3 mg cm−2. Electrochemical cells are assembled in an Ar-filled glove box, in which O2 and H2O contents are below 0.01 ppm, using a microporous polypropylene membrane as the separator. The electrolyte is 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of diethyl carbonate membrane (DEC)–dimethyl carbonate (DMC)–ethylene carbonate (EC) (1:1:1 in vol. ratio) as the electrolyte. The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements are carried out on a LAND test system (LAND CT2001A 1U). The cyclic voltammograms (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) for the prepared anodes are measured in a voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V on a Zahner Zennium IM6 electrochemical workstation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Material characterization

Fig. 2(a) shows XRD patterns of the as-synthesized Fe2O3, Fe2O3@SiO2@PDA and YS-Fe2O3@NC composites. All the diffraction peaks of all samples could be assigned typically to a rhombohedral α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS No. 33-0664).24 The diffraction pattern of the Fe2O3@SiO2@PDA nanocomposite agrees well with the hematite phase and it can be seen that a new broad peak exists at 2θ ≈ 21°, which is attributed to the (111) plane of SiO2.25 The results of thermal analysis (TG/DTA) on YS-Fe2O3@NC reveal that the carbon content in the composite is about 25 wt% (Fig. 2(b)). Fig. 2(c) shows nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC, suggesting a typical hysteresis mesoporous system.26 Based on BET analysis, the specific surface areas of Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC are calculated to be 20.47 and 87.16 m2 g−1, respectively. Large specific surface area undoubtedly provides a large contact area with the electrolyte and leads to high Li-ion flux across the electrolyte/electrode interface.27 The pore-size distribution shown in Fig. 2(d) reveals that Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC have an average pore size of ∼31.9 nm and ∼61.2 nm, respectively. An increase in the surface area and reduction in the average pore size by carbon coating understandably result from the porosity of polydopamine.

XPS measurements are carried out to further clarify the chemical states of Fe, O, C and N on the YS-Fe2O3@NC surface. The survey spectrum shown in Fig. 3(a) indicates the presence of Fe, C and O and the absence of other impurities. Fig. 3(b) shows the XPS spectrum of the Fe 2p doublet peaks, Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 at ∼710.8 eV and 724.8 eV; which is decomposed into five peaks of 710.2, 712.5, 718.2, 724.3, and 732.5 eV, respectively, suggesting the formation of Fe–OH, C–O–Fe and Fe–O bonds in Fe2O3.6,28 In terms of high-resolution O 1s spectra (Fig. 3(c)), the peaks at 529.4 and 531.9 eV are associated with lattice oxygen and near-surface oxygen like molecular water adsorbed on the surface, respectively.29 The peak at 530.7 eV is assigned to oxygen vacancies in the matrix of metal oxides.30 For LIBs, the lopsided charge distribution caused by oxygen vacancies will intrinsically induce an in-plane built-in electric field, which would provide an adventitious coulomb force to accelerate Li+ migration and facilitate the rate capability of LIBs.31 Deconvolution of the C 1s region (Fig. 3(d)) demonstrates a main peak at 284.6 eV corresponding to CC. The peaks observed at 285.5 and 288.8 eV are assigned to C–N and O–CO bonds, respectively. The XPS N 1s spectrum of YS-Fe2O3@NC in Fig. 3(e) can be divided into two peaks at 399.5 and 400.6 eV, corresponding to pyridinic nitrogen and pyrrolic nitrogen, respectively.32 It has been reported that pyridinic nitrogen and pyrrolic nitrogen as electrochemically active sites, could facilitate the fast diffusion of reactive Li-ions and improve the surface-induced capacitive processes involving Li-ions.33 To further confirm the existence of oxygen vacancies in YS-Fe2O3@NC, EPR spectra of Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC samples were obtained. Fig. 3(f) clearly shows their characteristic EPR signal, revealing the presence of isolated oxygen vacancies in YS-Fe2O3@NC. It has been demonstrated that oxygen vacancies, not only facilitate faster charge transport kinetics, but are also beneficial to retain the integrity of the electrode structure, thus enhancing the electrochemical activity.22

As shown in Fig. 4, the morphologies and microstructure of the Fe2O3 spindles, Fe2O3@SiO2, Fe2O3@SiO2@PDA and YS-Fe2O3@NC composites, were examined by SEM and TEM. From Fig. 4(a), these spindle-like α-Fe2O3 has highly uniform morphology with an average side length of about 300 nm. A uniform and smooth SiO2 layer is then coated on the surface of Fe2O3 (Fig. 4(b)). Fig. 4(c) presents the low magnification SEM images of the Fe2O3@SiO2@PDA sample, showing the high quality of the homogeneous and uniform nanoparticles. EDS elemental mapping spectra clearly show that Fe, O, C, N and Si are evenly distributed throughout the composites (Fig. 4(d–i)). The TEM images in Fig. 4(j and k) reveal that the Fe2O3 yolks are approximately 300 nm in diameter entirely wrapped by the homogeneous carbon shells with an average thickness of ∼15 nm and ∼17 nm SiO2 in between. The average width of the void space is calculated to be ∼34 nm. SEM images of YS-Fe2O3@NC are shown in Fig. 4(l). A visible interlayer gap is clearly observed between the carbon shell and the Fe2O3 core, which is a result of etching the SiO2 interlayer to generate the void space. The yolk–shell structure is beneficial to the electrochemical performance of the composite. With the advantages of Fe2O3 cores to deliver high reversible capacity, the N-doped carbon shell to improve the electronic conductivity of the nanocomposite, and void space to accommodate the volume expansion, superior electrochemical performance of YS-Fe2O3@NC can be expected. In addition, EDS mappings also reveal the uniform distribution of Fe, O, C and N elements in YS-Fe2O3@NC particles (Fig. S1(a–e), ESI†). Fig. 4(m and n) shows the TEM images of the YS-Fe2O3@NC nanostructures. The yolk–shell structure is confirmed in the TEM images (Fig. 4(m)). The robust and complete N-doped carbon shell can not only promote efficient electron transfer and improve the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite, but also repress the agglomeration of the nano-particles. Furthermore, the HRTEM image in Fig. 4(n) clearly displays a set of parallel fringes with a d-spacing of 0.367 nm, corresponding to the (012) plane of single-crystalline α-Fe2O3.34 Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows Raman patterns of YS-Fe2O3@NC composites. The two characteristic peaks around 1355 and 1592 cm−1 can be assigned to the D-band and G-band of carbon, respectively.

3.2 Electrochemical measurements
The cycling stability of the Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC electrodes was first explored by galvanostatic charging/discharging in a voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V for the 10th, 50th, 100th and 200th cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. The cells are activated at 0.5 A g−1 for 1 cycle before cycling at 5 A g−1. As displayed in Fig. 5(a and b), it should be emphasized that an obvious change in both charging/discharging curves is observed for the bare Fe2O3 in subsequent cycles while no obvious changes are observed even after 200 cycles for YS-Fe2O3@NC, which further indicates that the YS-Fe2O3@NC electrodes present much better electrochemical lithium storage performance than the bare Fe2O3 electrode. In addition, the degree of bending of the plateau reflects the polarization of the electrodes. In comparison, YS-Fe2O3@NC demonstrates lower polarization and better reaction kinetics, resulting from the enhanced electrical conductivity induced by the carbon layer in the composite. Fig. 5(c and d) show the CV curves of two electrodes at the first five cycles in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. For the sample Fe2O3 (Fig. 5(c)), in the 1st cathodic scan, well-defined current peaks were observed at ∼0.67 V, which is attributed to the reduction of Fe3+ to the metallic state Fe and the irreversible decomposition of the electrolyte to form an SEI film.4,34 The broad peak observed at ∼1.42 V can be attributed to Li-ion insertion into the amorphous Fe2O3 to form a solid-solution-like compound.35 The first anodic sweep shows two hump-like peaks at ∼1.69 V and ∼1.95 V, revealing the oxidative reaction of the metallic state Fe to Fe2+ and the further oxidation to Fe3+, respectively.34,35 Compared to the CV curves of Fe2O3 shown in Fig. 5(c), it is observed from Fig. 5(d) that the peaks in the following 4 cycles overlap well, indicating a better electrochemical reversibility and structural stability for YS-Fe2O3@NC.

The rate properties of the Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC anodes at different current densities from 0.2 A g−1 to 10 A g−1 between 0.01 and 3 V were also investigated and are shown in Fig. 5(e). As can be seen in Fig. 5(e), YS-Fe2O3@NC exhibits higher capacity (0.2 A g−1: 1052.5 mA h g−1; 0.5 A g−1: 1019.1 mA h g−1; 1 A g−1: 950.8 mA h g−1; 2 A g−1: 848.8 mA h g−1, 5 A g−1: 677 mA h g−1, and 10 A g−1: 415.8 mA h g−1, respectively) than Fe2O3 (0.2 A g−1: 1078.5 mA h g−1; 0.5 A g−1: 822 mA h g−1; 1 A g−1: 639.6 mA h g−1; 2 A g−1: 456.4 mA h g−1, 5 A g−1: 321.1 mA h g−1, 10 A g−1: 225.5 mA h g−1, respectively). Furthermore, the capacity of YS-Fe2O3@NC could be recovered back to 1075.7 mA h g−1 when the current density was restored back to 0.2 A g−1, indicating the excellent Li+ storage performance of YS-Fe2O3@NC. In order to further illustrate the advantage of YS-Fe2O3@NC, a comparison of the electrochemical performances between our work and other groups’ work.6,8,9,15,34 Analysis from Fig. 5(f) suggests that high-rate YS-Fe2O3@NC electrodes in our work has potential application in fast-charging LIBs. Fig. 6(a) shows the cycle performance of Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC electrodes at a current density of 5 A g−1 for 300 cycles. From Fig. 6(a), a discharge capacity of 578 mA h g−1 was retained for the YS-Fe2O3@NC electrode after 300 cycles, while the Fe2O3 electrode delivers merely 53.7 mA h g−1. In addition, the capacity retention of YS-Fe2O3@NC (77.9%) is larger than that of Fe2O3 (9.1%).
 Fig. 6  (a) Cycling performance and (b) AC impedance spectra of Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC electrodes; and (c) long-term cyclic capability at 10 A g−1 of YS-Fe2O3@NC electrodes. 

Fig. 6(b) shows AC impedance spectra of Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC electrodes in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz. Both EIS curves show an inclined line at the low frequency region and a depressed semicircle at the high frequency region, which reflects the Li+ diffusion process and the charge-transfer process, respectively.36 According to the equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 6(b)), the values of Rct for the Fe2O3 electrodes are calculated to be 326.6 Ω, much higher than that of the YS-Fe2O3@NC electrode (120.3 Ω), facilitating Li+ storage and enhancing charge transfer kinetics under a high current density. These results convincingly show that the introduction of oxygen vacancies can unquestionably improve the conductivity and electrochemical properties of α-Fe2O3. To further evaluate the long-term cycle performance of YS-Fe2O3@NC, the cycling measurements are conducted at 10 A g−1 (Fig. 6(c)). As shown in Fig. 6(c), the YS-Fe2O3@NC electrode displays an excellent long-cycle performance, with the specific capacity retained at 300.5 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1, and the capacity retention is calculated to be 43%. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that after the first several cycles, the coulombic efficiency of YS-Fe2O3@NC increases to approximately 100%, implying a superior reversibility during the lithiation/delithiation process.
Work function (WF) defined as the minimum energy required for the loss of an electron from the inside of a bulk material to the vacuum, plays a fundamental role in most of the electronic properties of a material.37 Therefore, the smaller the WF, the easier the loss of an electron from the material. The WF of the as-prepared composites are further characterized by KPFM and the work electrode including Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC particles is given in Fig. 7(a). Fig. 7(b–d) present the surface potential images over a scan area of 200 nm × 200 nm of Fe2O3, YS-Fe2O3@NC and Au foil, respectively. According to our previous work,38 the WFs of Fe2O3 and YS-Fe2O3@NC are calculated and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. 7(e). It is found that YS-Fe2O3@NC has a smaller WF (5.35 eV) than Fe2O3 (5.64 eV). The measured WF of Fe2O3 is close to the reported value (5.6 eV).39 The lowed WF induced by the N-doped carbon shell could be explained phenomenologically based on the energy-band model (Fig. 8).30 Smaller WF requires less energy for electrons to escape from the materials. Therefore, the N-doped carbon shell is expected to facilitate electron transfer in the composite, which is consistent with the analysis of EIS measurements. The excellent electrochemical performance in terms of rate capability and cycling stability can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of the morphology, size, structural stability, specific surface area and chemical compositions. First, the nanosize (300 nm) shortens the Li+ diffusion paths, provides many active sites for Li+ storage, reduces the electrode polarization and therefore enhances the kinetics of the Li+ uptake/release. Second, the N-doped carbon layer offers a high-conductivity electron transport pathway and decreases the internal resistance among Fe2O3 particles. Third, the N-doped carbon shell, which serves as a self-supporting framework, can allow for the remission of the aggregation of Fe2O3 particles. Moreover, the large void space could relieve the volume change and prevent the Fe2O3 spindles from aggregation, sustaining voids for facile penetration of the electrolyte and improving cycling stability. This N-doped carbon shell is well maintained even when Fe2O3 expands during the lithiation processes, thanks to the enough void space of the yolk–shell structure.

On the other hand, oxygen-vacancies in the Fe2O3 lattices also play crucial roles in enhancing Li-ion kinetics based on percolation charge transfer and the localized built-in electric field. Due to the imbalance in charge distribution induced by oxygen vacancies, a positively charged area (δ+) in the oxygen-vacancy center and an equivalent negatively charged electron area surrounding the oxygen vacancies are correspondingly formed, as demonstrated in Fig. 9(a). When oxygen-vacancy concentration exceeds the percolation threshold, the negatively-charged electron area surrounding the oxygen vacancies would overlap to form a charge transfer percolation-channel in the Fe2O3 matrix (Fig. 9(b)), facilitating electron transfer via the electron-jump model and consequently improving rate capability. It is expected that the lopsided charge distribution leads to the central region of oxygen vacancies being positively-charged and the region around oxygen vacancies being negatively-charged.40 Therefore, the localized built-in electric field correspondingly forms pointing from the defect-free region to the negatively-charged overlapped-chain, which accelerates Li-ion migration towards to the oxygen-vacancy region because of the coulombic forces shown in Fig. 9(c). In deep lithiation, the negatively-charged region became electrically neutral. During the delithiation process, the secondary electric field, pointing from the positively-charged oxygen-vacancy to the electroneutral lithiation layer, would also facilitate Li-ion extraction in the Fe2O3 matrix and across heterojunction interfaces, as shown in Fig. 9(d). So, the oxygen vacancies in the Fe2O3 matrix indeed facilitate Li-ion diffusion kinetics during the charge/discharge process. As a result, the obtained YS-Fe2O3@NC reveals excellent lithium storage properties.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have rationally designed a yolk–shell Fe2O3@carbon (YS-Fe2O3@NC) with rich oxygen vacancies for robust lithium storage. Benefiting from its unique structural features and the existence of oxygen vacancies, YS-Fe2O3@NC shows remarkable rate capability and ultra-long cycling stability. In particular, it delivers a reversible capacity of 578 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1, and a satisfactory ultra-long cycle life with a capacity of 300.5 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 10 A g−1. This research may open a new avenue for the design and synthesis of Fe2O3-based nanocomposites for high-performance LIBs.
