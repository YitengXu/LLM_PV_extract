    , Accepted 15th May 2012First published on 7th June 2012AbstractThree new conjugated polymers have been designed and synthesized via the alternate copolymerization of the electron-donating monomer benzodithiophene (BDT) and three different electron-accepting monomers: 5,8-dibromoquinoxaline, 5,8-dibromo-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline, 10,13-dibromodibenzo[a,c]phenazine. The synthesized polymers show good solubility in common organic solvents as well as broader absorptions in the visible region and narrower optical band gaps compared to homopolymers made from BDT units. It is found that the absorptions of the copolymers are red-shifted by increasing the electron-withdrawing ability of the co-monomer. In particular, the absorption edge of the P3 film extends to 778 nm, whereas that of the P1 film is only at 636 nm. Theoretical calculation studies of structure–property relations indicated that polymer chains with better coplanarity or π–π* delocalization will lead to lower band gaps. Photoinduced charge transfer (PCT) studies disclosed that exciton dissociation of photoexcited PX (X = 1, 2, 3) via electron-transfer may occur at the interface with CHL-C60, enabling the photogeneration of electrons and holes. The P3/CHL-C60 blended film was chosen as a representative sample to test the applicability of the polymer P3 for energy conversion, a 1.76% PCE was finally obtained.
Introduction
During the last few years, organic solar cells have attracted a great deal of interest because of their advantages in offering low-cost solar electricity by using spin-coating, ink-jet printing, or roll-to-roll printing techniques to fabricate large-area photovoltaic devices on flexible and light-weight substrates.1–4 Among these cells, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells,5 in which the hole-transporting conjugated polymers (donor) and electron-transporting molecules (acceptors), such as fullerenes, are blended in the active organic layer, are regarded as highly efficient systems for rapid exciton dissociation and charge transport. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solution-processed BHJ solar cells have recently exceeded 5%,6–9 primarily due to the development of low band gap p-type materials10,11 and better control of the interpenetrating electron donor–acceptor network by using processing additives.12–14
Recently, polymers based on benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (BDT) have attracted great attention for their functions as the electron donor for BHJ solar cells. For instance, some research groups have synthesized the BDT-based copolymers with thiophene, benzothiadiazole, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene, and thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine units.15 Among these polymers, poly(BDT-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene) showed the most promising photovoltaic performance (>7%) due to the aromatic stabilization energy gained from forming the resonance quinoidal structure of the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene units that significantly red-shifts the absorption of the polymers.15b–d
Herein, the present paper reports the synthesis of three new conjugated polymers based on BDT units. Polymers, poly[4,8-bis(2-dodecyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-(5,8-diquinoxaline)] (P1), poly[4,8-bis(2-dodecyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-(2,3-dipyridine-2-ylquinoxaline)] (P2) and poly[4,8-bis(2-dodecyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-(dibenzo[a,c]phenazine)] (P3), were synthesized successfully via the Stille reaction. All obtained polymers show good solubility in common organic solvents as well as broader absorptions in visible region and narrower optical band gaps compared to homopolymers from BDT units. Molecular structures and models of these polymers are shown in Scheme 1.

Measurements
The target polymers were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy using Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer with chloroform-d as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. The polymer molecular weight was determined by size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser light-scattering detection (SEC-MALLS). SEC was performed using an HPLC pump (Waters 515) and a column (200 mm × 0.8 mm, MZ-Gel SDplus 500 Å 5 μm). Column effluent was monitored sequentially with a miniDawn light-scattering detector (Wyatt technology, Santa, Barbara, CA, USA) and an Optical rEX differential refractometer (Wyatt Technology). Two 25 mm high-pressure filter with 0.22 and 0.1 μm pore (Millipore) were used for on-line filtration of the mobile phase. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2501PC/2550. Photoluminescence emission spectra were measured in a HITACHI F-4600 fluorescence spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the synthesized polymer was performed on a HENVEN thermal analysis system at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 500 °C in a nitrogen flow rate of 80 mL min−1. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out using thin films of polymer prepared from chloroform with PRINCETON APPLIED RESERC HPARSTAT-2273 in a solution of Bu4NBF4 (0.1 M) in acetonitrile at a scan rate 50 mV s−1.
Synthesis of polymers
These three polymers were prepared with the same procedure used to couple dibromide compounds with bis(tributylstannyl)-substituted compounds via the Stille coupling reaction. Scheme 3 shows the synthesis routes of polymers P1–P3.
 Scheme 3  Synthesis route of polymers. 
1.0 mmol of dibromide compound, 1.0 mmol of bis(tributylstannyl)-substituted compound and 50 mL of toluene were put into a three necked flask in an oil bath. The solution was flushed with nitrogen for 10 min, and then 20 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added into the flask. The solution was flushed again for 20 min. The oil bath was carefully heated to 110 °C, and the reactants were stirred for 20 h at this temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the reactants were cooled to room temperature, and the polymer was precipitated by the addition of 100 mL of methanol and filtered through a soxhlet thimble. The filtered polymer was subjected to a soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform successively and then recovered as a solid sample from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation. The solid was dried under vacuum for one day to get the final product. The yields of the polymerization reactions were about 40–60%.

Results and discussion
Thermostability
As revealed by the TGA curves (Fig. 4), the TGA of the polymers exhibited an apparent degradation at approximately 300 °C for P1 and P3, and 350 °C for P2 with a weight loss of around 5% under nitrogen protection and P1 was first decomposed among these three polymers. This is might be ascribed to the quinoxaline unit on P1 may be less stable than the diphenylquinoxaline and dibenzo[a,c]phenazine units on P2 and P3 respectively. The thermal stability of these three polymers is apparently good enough for their application in polymer solar cells (PSCs) and other optoelectronic devices.

Optical properties

Fig. 5 shows the normalized absorption spectra of the three polymers in CHCl3 solution and their corresponding spin-coated films on quartz substrates. The results from the absorption spectra are summarized in Table 1. The copolymers, P1–P3, show the lowest energy absorption edge at a longer wavelength than that of the homopolymer poly[4,8-bis(2-dodecyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene] (PBDT) (Table 1), which was presumably due to an intramolecular charge transfer structure in the copolymers. The quinoxaline or phenzine unit is a π-acceptor whereas the BDT unit serves as a π-donor. Thus, we can conclude that incorporating the electron-acceptor unit into the polymer chain can lower the polymer band gap effectively. Additionally, Table 1 shows the fact that the spectra of all these polymers in the solid-state are red-shifted compared to their corresponding absorption onsets in solution. This phenomenon suggests that the polymer backbones in the solid-state have more ordered interchain packing compared to those in solution.19,20 The absorption band-edge of the polymer films extend to 636, 756 and 778 nm, which are red-shifted by 15, 45 and 29 nm compared to those in solutions, respectively. Thus, the optical band gaps (Egopt) are calculated as 1.95, 1.64 and 1.59 eV for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. Obviously, these three electron-deficient units exhibit a strong effect in lowering the band gaps of the BDT-based polymers compared to the PBDT homopolymer (Egopt = 2.13 eV). Compared to PBDT (λonset = 582 nm), the absorption spectra of the films of P1 (λonset = 636 nm), P2 (λonset = 756 nm) and P3 (λonset = 778 nm) are red-shifted by 54, 174, 196 nm, respectively. Thus, we can draw a conclusion that the order of bandgap-lowering ability of these three units is: 5,8-dibromoquinoxaline (M1) < 5,8-dibromo-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline (M2) < 10,13-dibromodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (M3). This is ascribed to the rigid structure of the phenazine ring which makes the polymer P3 chains more coplanar. Comparing P1 and P2, the conjugation between dipyridine and quinoxaline in P2 will also lower its band gap and the slight electron withdrawing effect from pyridine also lower the band gap of P2. Therefore, the order of bandgap-lowering ability of these three units is M1 < M2 < M3.

In summary, all three polymers show broader visible absorption bands and narrower optical band gaps than those of the homopolymer formed from BDT units in a film, which exhibits the absorption edge at 582 nm with an optical band gap of about 2.13 eV. The broader absorption bands and the lower optical band gaps of the polymers are favorable for their application in PSCs.
Studies of structure–property relations by theoretical calculation

Method. 
The band gaps of the BDT-based polymers with diverse structures have been analysed using quantum-chemical methods in order to understand the structure–property relations. All the calculations were performed with the Gaussian-03 program.21 The geometries of the oligomers were optimized at an RHF level using a semi-empirical AM1 method.22 The band gaps were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/3-21G* and B3LYP/6-31G* levels. The calculated band gaps are plotted against the inverse of the number of monomer units (1/n) and extrapolated to infinite number of units to get the value for the polymer. Two types of basis sets were chosen for comparison of the accuracy of the calculations.


Calculation of band gaps. 
The band gaps in conjugated polymers are governed by their chemical structures. Therefore, detailed band gap theoretical calculations were carried out on the polymer structures. The theoretical quantity of Eg for direct comparison with the experimental band gap should be the transition (or excitation) energy from the ground state to the first dipole-allowed excited state.23 At the molecular level, Eg corresponds to the adiabatic transition energy.24 However, the crudest estimate, but most widely used due to its low cost, is based on the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), when n = ∞.23,25,26 Band gaps for the infinite chains (polymer) of P1, P2 and P3 were determined by plotting band gaps of oligomers against the inverse of the number (n) of monomer units and extrapolating the number of units to infinity. The HOMO–LUMO gaps of the oligomers, and the extrapolated band gaps of polymers are presented in Table 2 and in Fig. 6. As shown in Table 2, for the band gaps of P1, P2 and P3, there is a good agreement between the theoretically calculated (P1: 1.88/2.07 eV; P2: 1.54/1.67 eV; P3: 1.39/1.54 eV) and the experimental optical band gap Eg values (counterparts P1: 1.95 eV; P2: 1.64 eV; P3: 1.59 eV). For polymers P1, P2 and P3, the predicted values of the band gaps are in fair agreement with the experimental values, with deviations of about 0.12, 0.03 and 0.05 eV, respectively. Hence, this methodology to determine the band gaps is a good approach for predicting the band gap in benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene copolymers with alternate D–A units. The difference between the computed values and experimental values is probably due to the fact that the theoretical calculations are in the gaseous phase, while the experimental band gaps values are obtained in solution or in thin films. Hence, solvent effects and interchain interactions should be considered.27 In addition, the band gaps are the crudest approximation because of the methodology based on the difference between the HOMO and LUMO.

Calculation of dihedral angels and bond length. 

Fig. 7 shows the structure of conjugated oligomers (P1, P2, P3, n = 3) main chain. The optimized dihedral angles between the subunits and the C–C bond lengths are summarized in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The sketch structures of the conjugated oligomers (n = 3) are shown in Fig. 8. As shown in Table 3, the scope of dihedral angles of polymer P1 is: −24.151–132.777°, and the minimum dihedral angle is 24.151°, the maximum is 47.123°. P1 presents a larger degree of polymer chain twist, leading to poor coplanarity in Fig. 8. In comparison, in polymers P2 and P3, their polymer chains coplanarity are almost alike in Fig. 8. The minimum dihedral angles of P2 and P3 are 2.907° and 0.850°, respectively. The maximum dihedral angles are 17.324° and 8.563°, respectively. Comparing the dihedral angles of polymers P1, P2 and P3, P1 is the largest, P2 is second, and P3 is the smallest. P3 has a most planar structure attributed to the large fused ring in benzophenazine. The calculated values of the band gaps exactly agree with that order: P3 < P2 < P1. Therefore, the optimized geometry conformations are in good agreement with the differences in band gaps between polymers P1, P2 and P3. Thus, it may be suggested that the coplanarity has a crucial influence on the band gap in addition the factor of intrinsic construct.

 Fig. 8  AM1 optimized geometry configuration of P1–P3. 
As we know, in conjugated systems, the C–C bond length variation (Δγ) can be defined as the difference between the lengths of a C–C single bond and a double bond, a smaller Δγ leads to a better polymer chain π–π* delocalization. Analyzing the C–C bond lengths and CC bond lengths in Table 4, the C–C single bond length scopes of P1, P2 and P3 are 1.39560–1.44746 Å, 1.53617–1.55963 Å, 1.53164–1.55283 Å, respectively. The CC double bond length scopes of P1, P2 and P3 are 1.36289–1.43270 Å, 1.53568–1.55321 Å, 1.53164–1.55283 Å, respectively. Thus, we can determine the Δγ values to be 0.033–0.015 Å for P1, 0.001–0.006 Å for P2 and 0.0004–0.006 Å for P3 (P3 < P2 < P1) which means that P3 has the best π–π* delocalization, and P1 has the worst. The calculated values of the band gaps exactly agree with that order: P3 < P2 < P1. Thus, it may be suggested that the π–π* delocalization has a crucial influence on the band gap.
In summary, structure–property relation studies indicated that polymer chain with better coplanar or π–π* delocalization will lead to a lower band gap.

Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed according to the literature28 to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers. Fig. 9 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the BDT-based polymer films on a Pt electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6, CH3CN solution. From the value of onset oxidation potential (Eox) and onset reduction potential (Ered) of the polymers, the HOMO and the LUMO as well as the band gaps (Egec) were calculated and listed in Table 5.

Thin films of the polymers were drop cast from chloroform (10 mg mL−1). The CV of P1, P2 and P3 were measured in acetonitrile at a potential scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) served as the reference electrode. It was calibrated with ferrocene (EFc/Fc+ = 0.5 V vs. SCE). HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated here on the basis of the reference energy level of ferrocene (−5.10 eV below the vacuum)29 according the following equation:EHOMO/LUMO = [−(Eonset (vs. SCE) − Eonset (Fc/Fc+vs. SCE))] − 5.1 eV

Fig. 9 shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of polymers P1–P3. The reductions are observed with an onset potential at about −1.21 V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) for P1, −1.08 V for P2 and −0.67 V for P3. Similarly, the oxidations are observed with an onset potential at about 0.82 V, 0.58 V and 0.95 V versus the SCE for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated to be −5.42 eV and −3.39 eV for P1, −5.18 eV and −3.34 eV for P2, and −5.55 eV and −3.93 eV via cyclic voltammetry. Calculations using the equation Egec = HOMO − LUMO, give the band gaps of polymers P1–P3 as 2.03, 1.66 and 1.62 eV, respectively. The discrepancy of the values lies within the range of errors, and this discrepancy between the CV bandgaps and optical bandgaps of polymers is probably due to the interface barrier for charge injection.30,31
PCT studies
The ability of charge transfer has been investigated by photoluminescence (PL) measurements. As shown in Fig. 10, the mixing of approximately massPX/massCHL-C60 ∼ 1/2 CHL-C60 and PX (X = 1, 2, 3) will result in a quenching of the photoluminescence of the conjugated polymer. The spectra show that the photoluminescence of PX (X = 1, 2, 3) is completely quenched upon addition of CHL-C60. Because energy (exciton) transfer from the electron-donor to electron-acceptor is highly endergonic. We attribute the fluorescence quenching to electron-transfer, although a contribution from increased nonradiative decay (e.g., intersystem crossing) cannot be ruled out. Thus, the results show that the electron-transfer from the donor to acceptor is very close to 100% (Fig. 10a–c). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PX (X = 1, 2, 3) and CHL-C60 relative to the vacuum level, are schematically shown in Fig. 10d, which indicates that exciton dissociation of photoexcited PX (X = 1, 2, 3) via electron-transfer may occur at the interface with CHL-C60, enabling the photogeneration of electrons and holes.

The P3/CHL-C60 blended film was chosen as a representative sample to test the applicability of the polymer P3 for energy conversion, photovoltaic cells consisting of a composite film (P3:CHL-C60, 1:2 wt%) as the active layer sandwiched between a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) front electrode covered with a conducting layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) and an aluminum back electrode were prepared. It is clear that the control of morphology in dispersed heterojunction devices is a critical point. The degree of phase separation and domain size depend on solvent choice, speed of evaporation, solubility, miscibility of the donor and acceptor etc.Fig. 11 shows the AFM images of the surface of P3/CHL-C60 blended films spincoated using dichlorobenzene as solvent. The images show the surface morphology, indicating phase separation of the constituents.

Under white-light illumination from a solar simulator (AM 1.5) an open circuit voltage of Voc = 0.558 V and short circuit current of Isc = 6.83 mA cm−2 were obtained. The fill factor (FF), defined as (Imax × Vmax)/(Isc × Voc), with Imax and Vmax corresponding to the point of maximum output, was FF = 0.46. Under these conditions the power conversion efficiency (PCE = (Pout/Pin) × 100 = (FF × Voc × Isc/Pin) × 100) is about 1.76%, shown in Fig. 12. The low power conversion efficiency can be explained due to the bad morphology of the P3/CHL-C60 blended film.

Conclusion
Three low band gap conjugated polymers based on the BDT unit have been successfully synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction. All the obtained polymers are completely soluble in common organic solvents, thus applicable to solution-processing. All three polymers show broader visible absorption bands and narrower optical band gaps than those of homopolymer formed from BDT units. Theoretical studies disclosed that the polymer chain π–π* delocalization and the coplanarity have a crucial influence on polymer band gap. Photoinduced charge transfer studies suggested that these polymers P1–P3 could be used as electron donors in PSCs. The P3/CHL-C60 blended film was chosen as a representative sample to test the applicability of the polymer P3 for energy conversion, a 1.76% PCE was finally obtained.
