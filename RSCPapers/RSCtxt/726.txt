    , Accepted 14th June 2020First published on 15th June 2020AbstractParallel to the flourishing of inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the development of inorganic cesium-based metal halide PSCs (CsPbX3) is accelerating, with power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of over 20% being obtained. Although CsPbX3 possesses numerous merits, such as superior thermal stability and great potential for use in tandem solar cells, severe challenges remain, such as its phase instability, trap state density, and absorption range limitations, hindering further performance improvements and commercialization. This review summarizes challenges and strategies relating to each device functional layer and their integration for the purposes of performance improvement and commercialization, utilizing the fundamental configuration of a perovskite photo-absorption layer, electron transport layer (ETL), and hole transport layer (HTL ). In detail, we first analyze comprehensively strategies for designing high-quality CsPbX3 perovskite films, including precursor engineering, element doping, and post-treatment, followed by discussing the precise control of the CsPbX3 film fabrication process. Then, we introduce and analyze the carrier dynamics and interfacial modifications of inorganic ETLs, such as TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, and other typical organic ETLs with p-i-n configuration. The pros and cons of inorganic and organic HTLs are then discussed from the viewpoints of stability and band structure. Subsequently, promising candidates, i.e., HTL-free carbon-electrode-based inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs, that meet the “golden triangle” criteria used by the PSC community are reviewed, followed by discussion of other obstacles, such as hysteresis and large-scale fabrication, that lie on the road toward PSC commercialization. Finally, some perspectives relating to solutions to development bottlenecks are proposed, with the attempt to gain insight into CsPbX3 PSCs and inspire future research prospects.
1. Introduction
In the past decade, we have witnessed a smash-hit in the traditional photovoltaic industry in the form of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells, whose power conversion efficiency (PCE) values have rocketed from 3.8% in 2009 to 25.2% in 2020.1–5 The spectacular development of PSCs is ascribed to intrinsic merits possessed by perovskite materials, including high absorption coefficients, high carrier mobilities, low exciton binding energies low trap state densities, and high defect tolerances.6–10 Despite the successes attained using organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs, the thermal instability arising from the use of organic moieties, such as methylammonium (CH3NH3+ (MA+)) and formamidinium (CH(NH2)2+ (FA+)) cations, has become a Gordian knot preventing the commercialization of PSCs.11,12 It has been well-documented that MAPbI3 thin film dissociates remarkably into PbI2 and MAI after annealing at 85 °C.13 Although FA-based perovskite thin films have higher thermal stability and a mixture of FA and inorganic cesium (Cs) is stable even above 100 °C,14–16 a permanent solution to improve thermal stability is to replace organic cations with inorganic analogs (e.g., Cs+, Rb+, etc.),17,18 which have higher melting points (460 °C).19 Since the first report on the synthesis of fully inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = I and/or Br) in 1893,20 vast numbers of studies of the properties of CsPbX3 have been released. Parallel to the fast development in the solar photovoltaic industry,21 CsPbX3 perovskites also garner interest from the light emission community.22,23
The torrent of investigation into CsPbX3 PSCs started in 2012 when Shum et al. reported the first cesium-based metal halide PSCs, i.e., CsSnI3 PSCs, despite their quite low PCEs and unstable Sn2+ cations.24 Later, in 2015, Hodes et al. confirmed that CsPbBr3 PSCs worked equally as well as their organic analogous MAPbBr3 PSCs.17 Since then, the development of CsPbX3 PSCs began and has become unstoppable. According to the composition of the X site, CsPbX3 perovskites can be classified as CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br, CsPbIBr2, and CsPbBr3, as summarized in the PCE evolution tree (Fig. 1). Among the types of CsPbX3, the α-phase (cubic) CsPbI3 perovskite possesses the narrowest bandgap of ∼1.73 eV, which is close to the optimum bandgap for single-junction solar cells. However, the desirable α-phase CsPbI3 perovskite is not stable at room temperature. In 2015, Snaith et al. reported the first CsPbI3 PSCs with a stable α-phase at room temperature via adding HI to the precursor, showing a PCE of 2.9%.25 Then, Luther et al. proposed a dimensionality reduction strategy to obtain room-temperature-stable α-CsPbI3 quantum dot (QD) PSCs with a PCE of 10.77% in 2016 and 13.43% in 2017.26,27 Very recently, Fang et al. developed a series of doping-free polymers, including J71, PBDB-T, and PM6, as hole transport materials with suitable energy structures and superior carrier mobilities, boosting the PCEs of CsPbI3 PSCs above 17%, which is a record for inorganic PSCs using dopant-free hole transport materials.28 Zhao et al. post-treated CsPbI3 film with simple phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) to attain bifunctional stabilization, using gradient Br doping (or alloying) and surface passivation, and the as-fabricated PSCs achieved a PCE of 17.06%.29 Furthermore, the same group continued to improve the performance of CsPbI3 PSCs through precursor engineering, garnering a PCE of 19.03%.30 Compared with CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br perovskite exhibits improved phase stability but a wider bandgap of ∼1.92 eV. The first CsPbI2Br PSC, which had a PCE of 9.80%, was reported in 2016.19 The poor solubility of CsBr in polar solvents was then solved by Lin et al. through the co-sublimation of cesium halide and lead halide precursors under high vacuum conditions, which increased the PCE to 11.7%.31 In 2018, Wang et al. improved the PCE of CsPbI2Br PSCs to 14.81% via crystal engineering.32 Later, in 2019, Qu et al. evaporated CsBr to post-treat CsPbI2Br film, obtaining a highest PCE of 16.37%.33 Very recently, in 2020, Liu et al. adopted n-type doping, adding Ca2+ to CsPbI2Br, and achieved a record PCE of 16.79%.34 Compared with CsPbI2Br, the bright-red CsPbIBr2 perovskite possesses superior thermal stability, but with a widened bandgap (∼2.05 eV). In 2016, Ho-Baillie et al. utilized a spray-assisted deposition method to fabricate the first CsPbIBr2 PSC with a PCE of 6.3%.35 Then, in 2017, Cheng et al. obtained a CsPbIBr2 PSC with a PCE of 8.02% through a gas-assisted method.36 Subsequently, Zhang et al. elevated the PCE to 9.16% through intermolecular exchange.37 In 2019, Liu et al. employed a SmBr3 interface layer to modify CsPbIBr2 film, boosting the PCE of CsPbIBr2 PSCs to 10.88%.38 Very recently, in 2020, we inserted a thin layer of MgO between SnO2 and CsPbIBr2 to reduce interfacial recombination, with a highest PCE of 11.04%.39 Although ultra-stable CsPbBr3 suffers from having the widest bandgap, PSCs based on CsPbBr3 reached comparable PCEs to CsPbIBr2 PSCs. The first CsPbBr3 PSC was fabricated in 2015, with a CsPbBr3 PCE of 5.95%.17 Then, in the next few years, with the development of deposition strategies, the PCE of CsPbBr3 PSCs has been increased to 10.91%.40

Despite the fast development of CsPbX3 PSCs, huge discrepancies exist between the theoretical (the dashed leaves in Fig. 1) and experimental PCE values. This discrepancy is ascribed to deficient optical and carrier management, resulting in poor short-circuit current (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) values.41 Deficient optical management arises from insufficient charge-transport capabilities compared with absorption, where the film is too thin to fully absorb the entire solar spectrum.42 The VOC deficits seen in CsPbX3 PSCs are also severe in other wide bandgap cells, where the main reason is bandgap fluctuations, such as iodide segregation and mixed crystal phases with different bandgaps. Meanwhile, bulk and interfacial defects in CsPbX3 PSCs usually work as carrier recombination centers, corroding the VOC values of PSCs.43
To improve optical and carrier management in CsPbX3 PSCs, vast efforts and stunning strategies have been developed and applied, including novel deposition methods, compositional engineering, and the elaborate selection of electron and hole transport materials.42 On the other hand, theoretical investigations into PSC efficiency limits and efficiency losses are of great importance, enabling us to gain further physical insights into PSCs, particularly inorganic PSCs with inferior PCEs. Some excellent theoretical studies have suggested design guidelines for more closely approaching efficiency limits such as: (i) utilizing optically corrected radiative recombination, involving light trapping and angular restriction; (ii) utilizing selective contact, while considering charge accumulation and surface recombination at the electrodes; (iii) elaborately balancing the light-absorber thickness to ensure a large photocurrent and non-radiative recombination; and (iv) carefully selecting the carrier transport layer to terminate resistance-induced loss channels and diminish the large optical reflectance.44,45
In this review, we focused on these strategies to tackle the challenges faced by the CsPbX3 PSCs community, as shown in Fig. 1. First, we discussed CsPbX3 perovskites, from a fundamental understanding of the crystal structures and optical properties of CsPbX3 perovskites to the elaborate design and precise fabrication of high-quality CsPbX3 films. Then, we systematically reviewed recent progress relating to the electron transport layers (ETLs) and hole transport layers (HTLs) integrated into inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs. Subsequently, we elaborated on the emergence of carbon electrodes applied in CsPbX3 PSCs as a strategy to enhance the stability to meet the requirements for commercialization. Finally, other challenges, such as hysteresis, large-scale fabrication, and operational stability, existing on the roadmap toward commercialization are discussed. We hope that this review will help to boost further research into CsPbX3 PSCs.
2. Cesium-based inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite photo-absorption layers
2.1 The crystal structures and optical properties of CsPbX3 perovskites
Inorganic perovskites generally have the typical formula of ABX3, where the A site is a monovalent cesium cation (Cs+), B is a bivalent metal cation (typically Pb2+), and the X site is one or two halides (I− and/or Br−). The crystal structure of cubic-CsPbX3 is illustrated in Fig. 2a. However, this cubic phase of some perovskites is not always stable at room temperature. Thus, a prediction or assessment of the geometric stability can be attained via a semi-empirical relationship based on the octahedral factor (μ) and tolerance factor (t),47 as per the following equations: μ = RB/RX(1) (2)where RA, RB, and RX are the ionic radii of the A site, B site, and X site, respectively. The semi-empirical relationship suggests that an ABX3 perovskite is structurally stable when 0.44 < μ < 0.90 and 0.81 < t < 1.11.41,47 The μ and t values of hypothetical metal halide and Cs-based metal halide perovskites were calculated by Ho-Baillie et al., as shown in Fig. 2b.41

A more direct investigation into the phase stability of CsPbX3 was conducted by Abate et al.48 They found that a clear boundary located at an I/Br ratio of 3:2 separates distorted and stable perovskite lattices, where a higher I concentration leads to structural instability, as shown in Fig. 2c. Meanwhile, I/Br ratio variations change the optical properties of CsPbX3 perovskite film, as the brown color of a Br-rich perovskite turns to the quasi-black of the I-rich analog, as shown in Fig. 2d.19 Besides, increasing the concentration of Br compresses the CsPbX3 lattice (Fig. 2e), resulting in an increase of the bandgap from 1.77 to 2.38 eV (Fig. 2f).49
2.2 The design of high-quality CsPbX3 perovskite films

2.2.1 Precursor engineering. 
Up to now, spin-coating perovskite solutions (or precursors) is the most commonly used deposition method to obtain high-performance perovskite thin films.50,51 Precursor engineering advances in the areas of solvent coordination, compositional modulation, additive optimization, and defect control have remarkably affected the film compositions, crystallinities, morphologies, and trap-state densities of inorganic perovskite thin films.52 Accordingly, a profound understanding of precursor solution chemistry is essential for obtaining high-quality thin films from these solutions.53
The precursor solution solvent is a dominant factor affecting the crystallization kinetics and, thus, the final inorganic perovskite film quality.54,55 Since inorganic halide lead salts usually exhibit poor solubility, the primary criterion for precursor solutions is the choice of a strongly polar aprotic organic solvent, such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), or acetonitrile (ACN), to dissolve the perovskite precursor completely.56 The physical properties of these commonly used solvents are summarized in Table 1. The boiling point and vapor pressure of the organic solvent determine the solvent evaporation rate and, thus, the crystallization. Besides, the viscosity of the solvent has an impact on the homogeneity of the thin film morphology. Meanwhile, important solution-solute coordination is determined based on the dielectric constant of the solvent. The calculated Mayer bond order (MBO) is a good indicator showing the effectiveness of a solvent for solubilizing Pb-containing perovskites, where the MBO value is inversely proportional to the effectiveness.57

Among these different solvents, DMSO and DMF are widely used to solubilize precursors owing to their strong coordination abilities with Pb2+ to form PbX2-DMSO or CsX-PbX2-DMSO intermediate phases. Accordingly, the crystallization of PbX2 and perovskite are suppressed and high-quality perovskite films are formed after the release of DMSO during annealing.58–60 Meanwhile, the solvent composition is important for controlling these intermediate phases and the final perovskite crystallinity.61–63 Chen et al. conducted a systematic investigation of the influence of the solvent composition, particularly the DMF:DMSO ratio, on CsPbI2Br crystallization and perovskite film morphology.61 The evolution of CsPbI2Br crystallization at different DMF:DMSO ratios is sketched in Fig. 3a, with the corresponding top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shown in Fig. 3b. From the viewpoint of coordination chemistry, the Lewis acid PbX2 tends to react with the Lewis base CsI and DMSO to form an adduct.64 When the DMSO concentration is low, the quickly volatilized DMF induces the hasty coordination of CsI and PbX2, resulting in few CsPbI2Br crystal nuclei and thus leading to a morphology with small grain sizes and vast pinholes. When a suitable amount of DMSO is added, the rapid intercalation of DMSO molecules into the adjacent planes of PbX2 contributes to the formation of DMSO-PbX2 coordination and the expansion of the interlayer distance along the c-axis, driven by van der Waals forces.59,65 The formation of DMSO-PbX2 is beneficial for CsI to subsequently intercalate into the PbX2 lattice, resulting in large grain sizes and a compact pinhole-free CsPbI2Br film. However, once too much DMSO is added, the CsPbI2Br film morphology deteriorates because of the high hydrophobicity and viscosity of DMSO. From a study by Chen et al. of these solvent-composition-controlled perovskite crystallization kinetics, the optimized ratio of DMF:DMSO was found to be 2:1.63

Apart from the solvent composition, the inorganic salt ratio, i.e., PbX2:CsX2, has a potential influence on the crystallinity and quality of the inorganic perovskite film. Yang et al. obtained compact, pinhole-free, and full-coverage CsPbI2Br film (Fig. 3c) via introducing excess CsI to a CsPbI2Br precursor to attain spinodal decomposition, which refers to the demixing of components in a solid solution.66 During the crystallization process, CsI, with a faster growth rate, assembles first. Afterward, the well-matched crystal structure between the (100) plane of CsI and the (200) plane of CsPbI2Br promotes cubic CsPbI2Br perovskite formation. Kang et al. precisely regulated the raw material stoichiometric ratio to study its influence on the performance of CsPbI2Br PSCs.67 They found that a small amount of PbI2 significantly affects the morphology and crystallinity of the as-prepared CsPbI2Br perovskite film, and that PSCs show the best photovoltaic performance when the ratio of PbI2 to CsBr is 1.05:1, as shown in Fig. 3d.
Introducing additives to the perovskite precursor is another effective strategy to fabricate high-quality perovskite films and stabilize the desirable α-phase perovskite, especially in the case of α-CsPbI3.68 Lan et al. prepared smooth and dense CsPbBr3 film with good crystallinity and enlarged grain size through adding a judicious amount of NH4SCN to the CsPbBr3 perovskite precursor, as shown in Fig. 3e.69 Fang et al. found that upon adding tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) additive into the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 precursor solution, the trap-state density was remarkably reduced due to the alkyl chains and halide atoms of TBAB (Fig. 3f).70


2.2.2 Doping engineering. 
Element doping, a strategy that intentionally introduces heteroatoms into the target lattice without severe variations of the host crystal structure or basic physicochemical characteristics, has led to advances in tailoring semiconductors for microelectronics and optoelectronics applications.71 For inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs, element doping, especially at lead sites, has been proved to be a bifunctional strategy for performance enhancement and toxic lead mitigation.72 We summarize and illustrate the reported doping elements in Fig. 4 and Table 2, including main-group, transition-metal, and rare-earth cations, according to their main functions in CsPbX3 perovskite modification, i.e., light conversion, film morphology, carrier dynamics, and phase stability. Of particular note is that although we characterize these dopants according to the main function, some of them have multiple functions.

The energy band structure of a CsPbX3 perovskite is subject to change upon introducing heteroatoms into the crystal lattice. Accordingly, the bandgap-related light conversion capacity of a perovskite film is affected by element doping. For inorganic CsPbX3 perovskites with slightly wide bandgaps, some element doping strategies at Pb sites broaden the absorption spectrum, resulting in an increase in the light conversion capacity. Jin et al. introduced 10% Sn2+ to replace Pb2+, compressing the bandgap of CsPbIBr2 from 1.90 to 1.79 eV, as shown in Fig. 5a.73 Therefore, the IPCE spectrum edge was extended to ca. 700 nm, boosting JSC to above 14 mA cm−2. A slightly narrowed bandgap (1.89 to 1.85 eV) was also reported by Qi et al. when using Mn2+ to replace Pb in CsPbIBr2 perovskite, as shown in Fig. 5b. The performance of the CsPbIBr2 PSC was enhanced through the synergetic effects of a broadened absorption spectrum and better film morphology.74

Proper Pb substitutes, such as lanthanide ions and divalent Ba or Ca, can passivate the intrinsic traps, optimizing the carrier dynamics in perovskite films. Tang et al. systematically investigated the influence of doping lanthanide ions (Yb3+, Er3+, Ho3+, Tb3+, and Sm3+) on CsPbBr3 perovskite films. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) studies suggested that the carrier lifetimes of perovskite films doped with lanthanide ions increased significantly compared with pristine CsPbBr3 film (Fig. 6a).76 Recently, Liu et al. employed Ca2+ to substitute Pb2+; the prolonged carrier lifetime was confirmed from the TRPL results and ascribed to the enhanced built-in potential, as suggested by Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 6b and c).34

Element doping can improve the film morphology and crystallinity through a modified nucleation process and decreased crystal growth rate.96 Liu et al. reported a facile method to control the CsPbI2Br film growth process via the moderate doping of Mn2+ into the interstices of the CsPbI2Br lattice. The average grain size of the Mn2+-doped CsPbI2Br film significantly increased to 1.2 μm, which was superior compared to the grain size of pristine CsPbI2Br film (ca. 0.5 μm), as shown in Fig. 7a.79 Furthermore, Ho-Baillie et al. found that the addition of Sr+ drastically changes the morphology of CsPbI2Br perovskite and results in the appearance of “snowflakes”, which appear brighter under SEM, as seen in Fig. 7b.80 Apart from enlarging the grain size and shape transformation, element doping helps the structural reconstruction of CsPbX3 grains. Mai et al. demonstrated that incorporating InCl3 into the CsPbI2Br lattice contributes to promoting CsPbI2Br perovskite growth with the multiple orientation of some crystal planes (Fig. 7c), potentially resulting in efficient charge transport along multiple directions.81 Meanwhile, another important function of doping InCl3 into the CsPbI2Br lattice is to inhibit the formation of δ-phase CsPbI2Br. Aside from Pb substitution, element doping to replace Cs+ helps to improve the grain size of CsPbBr3. Tang et al. demonstrated the enlarged grain size of CsPbBr3 perovskite after doping several alkali metal cations, such as Na+, Li+, K+, and Rb+, as a substitute for Cs+, as shown in Fig. 7d.85 The average grain size of the Rb+-doped film increased to 820 nm, much larger than the value of the pristine film (360 nm). The enlarged grain size is attributed to the increased formation energy and easier perovskite phase conversion, where the crystallization process is preferred at pre-existing crystal surfaces, leading to gradual growth into larger grains instead of the formation of new crystal nuclei. Later, in 2019, the same group reported the similar function of transition metal cations (Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) in enhancing the CsPbBr3 grain size.88

Another important function of element doping is to stabilize the desirable perovskite phase, typically the α-phase, although some reports have confirmed the high performance of the β or γ-phase of CsPbI3. A detailed discussion of the effects of doping on the stability of CsPbI3 perovskites is presented below. However, Hayase et al. demonstrated that S doping in CsPbIBr2 crystals stabilizes the α-phase because of the electronegativity and strong coordination with halides.92 Accordingly, halide-vacancy-induced moisture channels close after S doping.

2.3 The fabrication of high-quality CsPbX3 perovskite films
Compact and pinhole-free inorganic CsPbX3 film with proper thickness is a prerequisite for inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs to achieve high photovoltaic performance. However, CsPbX3 perovskite film still needs to overcome the following challenges. (i) Film thickness are often insufficient. It has been well-documented that CsPbX3 and CH3NH3PbX3 have similar absorption coefficients.97 Therefore, the optimal thickness of CsPbX3 film should be more than 400 nm for the full absorption of the incident light.98 However, during the solution-processed one-step deposition method, the poor solubility of CsX (especially CsBr) in polar aprotic solvents (such as DMSO and DMF) impairs increases in film thickness.19 Therefore, inorganic perovskite films grown via this method have typical thicknesses of 100–300 nm,79,99 less than the required thickness (400–600 nm) for high-performance PSCs.31 To overcome the poor solubility of CsX (especially CsBr), adopting new precursor recipes, such as CsAc and HPbX3 for CsPbI3,97 and CsI, PbI2, and PbBr2 for CsPbI2Br,100 plays an important role. Another solution for obtaining CsPbBr3 is developing the multi-step decomposition of CsBr to mitigate solubility problems.101 (ii) Desirable α-phase CsPbI3 is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature, which is attributed to the small size of Cs+ resulting in an unsatisfactory tolerance factor.102–104 Five effective strategies have been proposed to address this issue, i.e., metastable phase formation;105–107 precursor additives;25,108 dimensionality reduction;26,27 steric hindrance;109,110 and compositional tuning.93,102 (iii) Abnormal morphologies and mixed phases can arise from the concurrence of solvent evaporation and crystal growth, mainly in the mixed halide region between CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, i.e., CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2.111,112 Accordingly, some strategies, like gradient thermal annealing,111,112 anti-solvent treatment,92,111 light processing,113 and intermolecular exchange,37 are proposed to balance the solvent evaporation rate and crystal growth rate, and, eventually, to improve the perovskite film quality. Co-evaporation,31 spray-assisted deposition,35 and sequential immersion73 have also been proved to be effective methods to fabricate high-quality inorganic perovskite films.

2.3.1 CsPbI3. 
Generally, CsPbI3 has four polymorphs, i.e., a cubic (α) phase at ca. 645 K, a tetragonal (β) phase at ca. 510 K, and two orthorhombic phases (black γ at ca. 325 K and non-perovskite yellow δ at room temperature), and these polymorphs can interconvert upon increasing/decreasing the temperature, as shown in Fig. 8a.114–116 Accordingly, at room temperature, undistorted α-CsPbI3 with a suitable bandgap of 1.73 eV tends to become non-perovskite yellow γ-CsPbI3 with an undesirable bandgap of 3.01 eV.117 The facile way to obtain α-CsPbI3 is to elevate the annealing temperature to over 310 °C, whereas further heating to 390 °C will decompose CsPbI3 into CsI and sublimated PbI2 (Fig. 8b).116 Snaith et al. found that a heating temperature of ≥335 °C under air-free conditions is necessary to obtain high-quality α-CsPbI3 thin film.19

The alternative is the introduction of a judicious amount of HI to the precursor, which slumps the heating temperature to 100 °C to obtain α-CsPbI3 with fine grains, as shown in Fig. 8c.25 Subsequently, numerous works based on “HPbI3” or “HPbX3” precursors have been reported for the fabrication of α-CsPbI3 thin films.29,90,97,110,118 Recently, Zhao et al. pointed out that the actual additive contributing to the formation of black phase CsPbI3 perovskite thin film is not the acid but dimethylammonium iodide ((CH3)2NHI; DMAI) and DMAPbI3,30 which are the products of the reaction between the acid and DMF solvent.119,120 As shown in Fig. 8d, DMAI and PbI2 formed an intermediate phase similar to DMAPbI3, which transforms to γ-CsPbI3 (at low DMAI concentration) or β-CsPbI3 (at high DMAI concentration) as a result of DMAI sublimating and Cs+ cations embedding into the crystal lattice concurrently. Accordingly, high-quality β-CsPbI3 thin film was fabricated to attain efficient and stable CsPbI3 PSCs.30,108 Meanwhile, it was also reported that γ-CsPbI3 is more stable than α-CsPbI3 with a more suitable bandgap of 1.68 eV.114,121,122Via adjusting the [CsI/PbI2] compositional ratio, Unold et al. reported that the γ-CsPbI3 phase can be formed under CsI-rich growth conditions without secondary phases, whereas the non-perovskite δ-phase is formed under PbI2-rich growth conditions.105 Ho-Baillie et al. fabricated high-quality black γ-CsPbI3 perovskite film based on a simple cation exchange growth (CEG) method via replacing the organic MA+ cations with Cs+ (Fig. 8e); the intermediate MAPbI3 at a lower annealing temperature (200 °C) acted as a perovskite template for Cs+ to replace MA+.121 After the high-temperature annealing process, compact and pinhole-free γ-CsPbI3 films were formed with a more uniform grain-size distribution. In contrast, perovskite films produced via the conventional process have pinholes visible on the surface and voids.
Surface organic terminal group functionalization via introducing steric hindrance is another emerging strategy to suppress distortion (phase changes), which is caused by the octahedral tilting of [PbI6]4− units in cubic CsPbI3.56 Choy et al. developed a facile method, decorating CsPbI3 film with multifunctional 4-aminobenzoic acid (ABA), and using steric neostigmine bromide (NGBr) to stabilize the photoactive phase and reduce the defect density of CsPbI3, as shown in Fig. 8f.123 ABA or NG cations are located successfully at the grain boundaries and surface of the CsPbI3 film, increasing the steric hindrance to anchor the PbI6 octahedra. Accordingly, a continuous array of corner-sharing PbI6 octahedra is maintained to kinetically stabilize the photoactive CsPbI3 phase. Moreover, ABA and NGBr have two other merits, defect passivation and energy-level alignment, to improve the PCE of CsPbI3 PSCs to 18.27% with excellent stability. In addition, Han et al. introduced organic terminal group (OTG) molecules as a capping layer to provide an extra energy barrier for phase transitions, thus enhancing the stability when exposed to air (Fig. 8g).99
Another efficient strategy to stabilize α-CsPbI3 at room temperature is to reduce the dimensionality of CsPbI3 to 2D,126 quasi-2D,127 or 0D (quantum dots: QDs),128,129 because of the high surface energies of nanocrystals or the high surface micro-strain on nanocrystals.130 Aside from the improved phase stability at room temperature, α-CsPbI3 QDs have another advantage, i.e., the precise control of film thickness through layer-by-layer decomposition.27 However, while surface ligands protect QDs from aggregating, they reduce the mobility of charge carriers. To address this dilemma, Luther et al. post-treated CsPbI3 QDs using organic halide salts (e.g., AX) to enhance the electronic coupling between CsPbI3 QDs without sacrificing the nanocrystal morphology.27 Liu et al. employed a ligand-exchange method, replacing long-chain oleic acid (OA−) and oleylamine (OAm−) with short-chain thiocyanate anion (SCN−), to enhance the conductivity, as shown in Fig. 8h.124
As described above, the relatively low tolerance factor of CsPbI3 attributed to the small Cs+ cations results in low chemical stability. Therefore, the incorporation of new ions to tune the tolerance factor can stabilize α-CsPbI3.104,131,132 Yang et al. investigated the α-phase stability variations after doping with three different metal ions, Sn2+, Ge2+, and Si2+, at varying concentrations, as shown in Fig. 8i.125 A negative formation energy indicates higher thermal stability, suggesting that the highest stability is achieved via Sn-doping at a suitable concentration.


2.3.2 CsPbI2Br. 
Initially, CsPbI2Br thin films were obtained by dissolving CsBr and PbI2 stoichiometrically in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO, assisted by a gas-quenching method (gas-assisted spin coating) and quick low-temperature annealing.80 However, the solubility limits of Br cap the concentration of CsPbI2Br precursor in DMF at 0.43 M.19 Alternatively, DMSO undergoes stronger coordination interactions with the CsPbI2Br precursor and enables Br salt concentrations exceeding 2 M. The stronger coordination of DMSO with PbI2 contributes not only to an improvement in precursor solubility but also to the promotion of cubic CsPbI2Br formation at room temperature. A mechanism that explains this DMSO-induced cubic CsPbI2Br perovskite formation at room temperature was proposed by Rao et al., as illustrated in Fig. 9a.133 Initially, interlamellar interstices of layered PbI2 or PbBr2 (in the form of layered octahedral [PbI6]4−) leave space for DMSO molecules to embed to coordinate with PbI2 spontaneously, expanding the PbI2 interlayer distance along the c-axis.134 The strong coordination of DMSO with PbI2 lengthens the PbI2 interplanar distances, paving the way for the subsequent intercalation of CsI species to form a CsI-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase. Afterward, with better affinity toward PbI2 than DMSO, the intercalated CsI components gradually edge out the DMSO molecules to form the final α-CsPbI2Br perovskite. The above-mentioned α-CsPbI2Br crystallization could be carried out at room temperature taking about 3 h. However, this crystallization process could be accelerated to 15 min upon using a room temperature solvent annealing strategy, where the one-step spin-coated perovskite films were subjected to DMSO vapor annealing treatment, as shown in Fig. 9b. The condensed DMSO vapor molecules facilitate the dissolution and rearrangement of CsPbI2Br, thus catalyzing the growth of perovskite crystals.135,136

However, the uneven evaporation of DMSO triggered by the high boiling point (189 °C) results in an extremely rough surface and poor coverage, with severe aggregation, mixed with some plausible amount of the δ-CsPbI2Br phase. To solve this problem, Chen et al. proposed a gradient thermal annealing (GTA) method (Fig. 9c), i.e., 50 °C for 1 min, 100 °C for 1 min, and 160 °C for 10 min, to simultaneously control the evaporation rate of residual DMSO and the crystallization rate of CsPbI2Br film.111 This GTA method eliminated the δ-CsPbI2Br phase and greatly improved the morphology of CsPbI2Br film, obtaining continuous and full coverage; this emphasized the importance of the annealing temperature and solvent evaporation rate on phase transitions and morphologies in a mixed-halide system. However, the device performance is still influenced by some flaws in the GTA film, such as abnormal stripes along the edges and irregular CsPbI2Br crystals, which are induced by the strong coordination capacity of DMSO and the solvent edge effect. An anti-solvent (ATS) concept is proposed to tackle this solvent edge effect, through washing away residual DMSO in the as-formed CsPbI2Br precursor film using a low-boiling-point solvent, i.e., isopropanol or toluene, as shown in Fig. 9c. Isopropanol, with a low boiling point and high viscosity, forms and maintains the homogeneous CsPbI2Br precursor film, eventually contributing to high-quality α-CsPbI2Br film after GTA treatment.111 The GTA strategy or multistep annealing is widely used to fabricate high-quality CsPbI2Br film, where perovskite crystal growth and micron-sized grains are optimized.33,136,138 Liu et al. further pointed out that crystal growth processes, e.g., the CsPbI2Br nucleation rate and solvent evaporation rate, are remarkably influenced by the annealing temperature.32 They fabricated temperature-assisted CsPbI2Br film via a hot spin-coating method to precisely control the density of nuclei and crystal grain growth rate, as illustrated in Fig. 9d. For a given concentration of solution, the initial nucleation step is significantly suppressed under high precursor solubility conditions;139 this is related to the CsPbI2Br precursor temperature. Thereafter, crystalline grain growth is highly dependent on the solvent evaporating process,140,141 which is carefully controlled by the annealing temperature. The concurrence of solvent volatilization and perovskite crystallization makes it difficult to control the perovskite nucleation and crystal growth processes, resulting in low-quality CsPbI2Br film with unsatisfactory surface coverage, poor thickness, and fine grains. To address this issue, Wang et al. proposed an anti-solvent assisted multi-step deposition method to allow the preparation of high-quality CsPbI2Br, as shown in Fig. 9e.137 The fast precipitation of PbI2 (DMSO) intermediate complexes and the formation of a porous structure were promoted by treating spin-coated PbI2 films with proper anti-solvents, which significantly affected interdiffusion and reactions between PbI2 and the deposited CsBr.


2.3.3 CsPbIBr2. 
Similar to CsPbI2Br, the fabrication of high-quality CsPbIBr2 film needs precise control of the thermal annealing process. Since the radius of Cs+ (1.81 Å) is much smaller than those of MA+ (2.70 Å), FA+ (2.79 Å), and DMSO (2.93 Å), the perovskite crystal growth mechanism of CsPbIBr2 is different from its MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 analogs, where low-temperature stable-transition-film (STF) is essential for high-quality CsPbIBr2 film.112 Solution-processed CsPbIBr2 perovskite crystal growth includes three processes, as shown in Fig. 10a. (i) Disordered distribution is when PbBr2, CsI, and DMSO molecules are disordered in the precursor and freshly spin-coated film. (ii) CsI-DMSO-PbBr2 2D intermediate phase formation is when, under electrostatic and thermodynamic forces, the molecules tend to migrate to energetically more favorable positions to form a CsI-DMSO-PbBr2 2D intermediate phase. Specifically, with stronger affinity to PbBr2 and a smaller size compared to DMSO, CsI is expected to intercalate into the PbBr2 framework as the DMSO is extruded out. After spin-coating the perovskite precursor on the substrate, the white and transparent film turns orange and reaches a stable state under equilibrium conditions. This phenomenon indicates that an incomplete CsPbIbr2 perovskite film has been formed, which is named STF.112 The formation of this orange STF is very sensitive to the environment, with the film being negatively affected by a temperature that is either too high or too low. To improve STF quality, research was done in which the thermal annealing temperature was precisely controlled,112,142 the spin-coating time was prolonged,38 or long-term illumination was adopted.113 (iii) 3D α-phase perovskite formation is when the thermal annealing temperature is elevated to at least 160 °C (the lowest temperature reported to form the 3D α-phase perovskite) and the DMSO evaporates completely to form the final 3D α-phase perovskite.

Mai et al. highlighted the importance of Cs-PbBr2+ array ordering in a bright yellow STF (Fig. 10b1) through contrast experiments.112 The desirable brownish-red film (Fig. 10b2) is obtained via a two-step (30 °C/160 °C) annealing process, while the frosted films (Fig. 10b3) could be formed via a direct high-temperature (160 °C) annealing process. Meanwhile, the XRD pattern evolution clearly illustrates the three processes of CsPbIBr2 perovskite crystal growth mentioned above (Fig. 10c). Originally, a diminutive peak appears at 30° from the wet film just after being spin-coated at room temperature, indicating the crystallization of CsPbIBr2. Then, after thermal annealing at 30 °C, some CsPbIBr2 starts to consolidate, even without the high temperatures needed for solvent evaporation. Finally, upon continuously increasing the temperature up to 160 °C, stronger peaks appear, suggesting further crystallization in the film.
Similarly, Zhang et al. utilized intense light processing technology to modulate wet CsPbIBr2 film to STF, followed by a high-temperature annealing (280 °C) process for the formation of final, full-coverage, pure-phase CsPbIBr2 films (Fig. 10d).113 Then, the same group continued to develop new technology for the efficient fabrication of STF. They proposed a facile intermolecular exchange strategy for the efficient replacement of DMSO by Cs+ in STF, wherein CsI solution is spin-coated onto wet CsPbIBr2 film. In this way, bright yellow STF was formed, and the final perovskite film exhibited dense and pure-phase morphology (Fig. 10e).37 Aside from the two-step conventional solution route, early strategies for CsPbIBr2 formation were usually designed for large-area fabrication, including spray-assisted deposition (Fig. 10f),35 sequential immersion (Fig. 10g),73 and dual-source thermal evaporation (Fig. 10h).143


2.3.4 CsPbBr3. 
From a structural point of view, the relatively complex Cs–Pb–Br phase diagram can lead to multiple perovskite and quasi-perovskite phases (Fig. 11a), which could be obtained through carefully controlling the ratios of the precursors (i.e., CsBr and PbBr2) to obtain favorable crystal growth conditions.144 However, the large concentration differences between CsBr and PbBr2 in current solution-processing techniques result in mixed phases being formed in the corresponding perovskite films, which is the main handicap to further enhancing the performance of CsPbBr3 PSCs. Thus, fabricating pure-phase CsPbBr3 film requires an elaborately designed deposition method taking into account the following crystalline conversion processes: 2PbBr2 + CsBr → CsPb2Br5(3) CsPb2Br5 + CsBr → 2CsPbBr3(4) CsPbBr3 + 3CsBr → Cs4PbBr6(5)

In detail, layered two-dimensional (2D) CsPb2Br5 with a tetragonal phase will form under Cs-deficient conditions.149–151 In contrast, 0D Cs4PbBr6 with a rhombohedral phase tends to form under Cs-rich conditions.152,153 The 3D CsPbBr3 perovskite phase only appears close to neutral conditions (CsBr:PbBr2 = 1:1). Meanwhile, CsPbBr3 crystals have two polymorphs, i.e., an orthorhombic phase at room temperature and a cubic phase at high temperature.154
To overcome the issue of the different solubilities of CsBr and PbBr2 in polar solvents, Tang et al. developed a novel multi-step solution-processed deposition strategy (Fig. 11b), increasing the number of deposition cycles of CsBr solution to convert Cs-deficient CsPb2Br5 (cycles <4) to neutral CsPbBr3 (cycles = 4) and then to Cs-rich Cs4PbBr6 (cycles >4).101 After the 4th deposition cycle of CsBr solution, the final CsPbBr3 film coverage and grain size are ideal. The further deposition of CsBr solution not only reduces the grain size and therefore harms the carrier dynamics but also introduces a CsBr-rich Cs4PbBr6 phase into the final film, thereby corroding the overall photovoltaic performance. This novel and effective deposition strategy helps fabricate full-coverage and pure-phase CsPbBr3 film and, thus, high-performance PSCs.
Liao et al. modified this multi-step method via dipping the as-prepared PbBr2 film into CsBr solution to reduce the ideal number of CsBr deposition cycles to 2 (Fig. 11c).145 After the proposed dipping and spin-coating processes, the color of the PbBr2 film changes from white to yellow, indicating the formation of cesium lead bromide halide. In the multi-step spin-coating process, the properties of the PbBr2 sublayer dominate the final perovskite film morphology. Tang et al. systematically investigated the impact of the PbBr2 film crystallization temperature on the final CsPbBr3 film morphology and the consequent PSC performance, as shown in Fig. 11d.146 Under different crystallization temperatures from 25 to 120 °C, the as-prepared PbBr2 films varied from semitransparent to opaque. Solvent volatilization and film shrinkage contributed to the formation of porous and rough PbBr2 film, providing room for sufficient CsPb solution penetration and CsPbBr3 grain growth. Meanwhile, there is a linear relationship between the PbBr2 film thickness (d) and crystallization temperature (T), d ∝ 0.003T, paving the way for precise control of the PbBr2 morphology and final perovskite film quality. A low crystallization temperature leads to relatively compact PbBr2 film, resulting in compressive stress along the in-plane direction (Fig. 11d), since the CsPbBr3 grain volume tends to be expanded 2.18-fold compared with the PbBr2 grain volume. The compressive stress and the insufficient growth space restrict lateral growth to large-sized CsPbBr3 crystals. On the other hand, a high crystallization temperature enlarges the porosity volume, which is much larger than the expanded lattice volume upon changing from PbBr2 to CsPbBr3. Several CsPbBr3 grains expand and gather in a single pinhole, where compressive stress from neighboring grains restricts further grain expansion, unavoidably leaving unfilled pinholes. Ultimately, the compressed crystalline grains and pinholes hinder the carrier dynamics and increase charge recombination.
Although the deposition of CsPbBr3 films using solution-based methods is inexpensive, it is still quite challenging to obtain large-area, consistently uniform, high-quality CsPbBr3 films. Instead, vacuum thermal evaporation, an established technique that is widely used in the coating industry, can easily deposit multiple layers of uniform and flat thin films over large areas.148 Jiang et al. adopted a sequential vacuum evaporation method to obtain enlarged grain-size CsPbBr3 film with an adequate CsPb2Br5 derivative phase based on reverse routing (Fig. 11e), where PbBr2 was deposited on a CsBr sublayer to form Cs-deficient conditions.147 The formation of CsPb2Br5 at the surfaces and grain boundaries of the perovskite film can effectively passivate grain defects and the electron transport layer. Meanwhile, the derivative phase will warp the energy band at the interfaces, lowering the energy barrier and reducing charge recombination at the interfaces. Liu et al. also deposited CsPbBr3 perovskite films using vacuum thermal evaporation via the dual-source co-evaporation of CsBr and PbBr2 precursors (Fig. 11f).148 The stoichiometry of the final CsPbBr3 film is determined by the CsBr to PbBr2 evaporation rate ratio. High-quality CsPbBr3 films with decent crystallinity and uniformity can be obtained via systematically optimizing the deposition parameters.

2.4 Post-treatment to attain high-quality perovskite films
Low-temperature-processed CsPbX3 film possesses many surface defects, unavoidably.155,156 Meanwhile, deep traps on the perovskite film surface, introduced by the large number of halide ions during the formation of CsPbX3 films, will result in severe charge recombination and thus impair the PSC performance. Accordingly, reasonable post-treatment techniques focusing on passivating the CsPbX3 film surface defects and accelerating charge transport have been well-developed.157,158 Tian et al. doped Pb(NO3)2 solution into as-prepared CsPbI2Br film to passivate the deep trap states arising from Pb vacancies and I interstitials, as shown in Fig. 12a.159 Liu et al. post-treated one-step spin-coated CsPbI2Br QDs/film with a series of A-site cation-based organic iodine salts, as shown in Fig. 12b.160 They found that the passivation effect of FAI in ethyl acetate (EA) on the prepared perovskite films is dependent on the soaking duration time. At the optimized soaking time, the iodine-ion-enriched CsPbX3 film formed on top of CsPbI2Br is suggested to modify the film surface for proper band edge bending. Also, the CsPbI2Br film surface is modified by FA+ cations through grain boundary and surface defect passivation. As a result, the decreased recombination loss and the improved charge extraction capacity at the interface boost the PCE of the CsPbI2Br PSC to 14.49%.

Apart from inorganic and/or organic salts, some aryl halide hydriodates, like 4-bromobenzylamine hydriodate (BrBeAI), are effective post-treatment materials for CsPbX3 films. Wang et al. post-treated CsPbI2Br film with BrBeAI and found that band alignment occurred at the perovskite/HTL interface, which assists the extraction of holes and blocks electrons.161 Consequently, this post-treatment strategy improved the short-circuit current of CsPbI2Br solar cells and enhanced the PCE from 13.10% to 14.63%. To reduce the large positive/negatively charged defect induced VOC losses in CsPbX3 PSCs, Jen et al. introduced a small molecule Lewis base to passivate these defects. This study reveals the effects of nitrile (C–N) groups on trap density passivation (Fig. 12c).43 Consequently, notorious non-radiative recombination is restrained via passivating the Pb-exposed surface, resulting in improved VOC and FF values after passivation (Fig. 12d).
Quantum dots, with a size of several nanometers, size-dependent optoelectronic properties, a tunable energy band structure, and superior charge-extraction abilities, are an excellent candidate to act as a band alignment modulator. The optoelectronic behavior of QDs, especially alkyl acid decorated QDs, is dominated by the surface morphology and charge properties.163 Therefore, organic ligands are essential for QD utilization in photoelectric devices, as they provide significant anti-aggregation effects, solution processability, coordination with surface atoms, surface defect passivation, and energy level modulation.164 In addition, the trade-off between charge recombination and transfer properties emphasizes the importance of ligand length. Therefore, based on the surface coordination chemistry, a better understanding of the interfacial carrier dynamics allows for the rational design of surface-ligand-decorated QDs for photovoltaics. Accordingly, Duan et al. investigated the length dependence of charge recombination using several QD hole-conductors (Fig. 12e).162Via optimizing the alkyl-chain lengths of ligands, charge repulsive Coulomb forces and quantum tunneling distances can reach a delicate balance to maximize charge extraction.
3. The ETL and the ETL/CsPbX3 interface
Generally, PSCs employ an ETL to conduct the photo-generated electrons to the anode and to block holes. In this regard, modulating and choosing the proper ETL and controlling the ETL/perovskite interface can lead to advances in accelerating electron transport and suppressing carrier recombination (Fig. 13a), contributing to enhanced photovoltaic performance and environmental stability.21,165–169 Particularly for normal n-i-p PSCs, the ETL plays a key role as the substrate for upper perovskite crystallization, regulating the perovskite film morphology.170 Accordingly, the criteria to be optimized for a desirable ETL, as illustrated in Fig. 13b, include: (i) the electronic properties (energy structure, trap states, mobility); (ii) the optical properties (transmittance, bandgap, and refractive index); (iii) morphology control toward the adjacent perovskite layer; (iv) chemical stability to moisture and the polar aprotic organic solvent used for the perovskite precursor; and (v) facile, low cost, and nontoxic fabrication.169,171–173 After about ten years of development, dozens of n-type materials, both organic and inorganic, have shown their potential to be integrated into highly efficient PSCs, as summarized in Fig. 13c.174–177 This fast development of ETLs for hybrid organic–inorganic PSCs provides the ability to adopt established modulation strategies for obtaining ETLs and ETL/perovskite interfaces for inorganic PSCs.

3.1 Inorganic ETLs
Inorganic n-type materials, especially binary and ternary metal oxides such as TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, and ZnMgO, are excellent ETL candidates in inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs because of their facile fabrication and splendid properties.38,178–180 However, challenges such as severe carrier recombination at the interface, improper band alignment with the adjacent CsPbX3 perovskite, and high sintering temperatures have frustrated the community. The following discussion covers the applications and modifications of binary and ternary metal oxide ETLs.

3.1.1. TiO2. 
TiO2, originating from dye-sensitized solar cells, is the most successful and popular electron transport material in both hybrid and inorganic PSCs. The conduction band minimum (CBM) of TiO2 is −4.1 eV, lower than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite, helping electron transport from the perovskite to the back electrode. Meanwhile, high transmittance in the visible region guarantees that sufficient light is absorbed by CsPbX3.181 Outstanding inorganic PSCs with TiO2 are summarized in Table 3, classified by the X component of CsPbX3. Although TiO2 exhibits numerous merits, the high sintering temperature (>450 °C), mismatched energy levels, and UV-light instability corrode the performance of inorganic PSCs. Vast elaborate strategies have been designed to tackle these flaws. Choy et al. utilized a simple low-temperature route to deposit a thick TiO2 backbone film decorated with fullerene on the perovskite film to configure an inverted PSC. The reduced defect density and more favorable energy-level alignment contribute to suppressed mono-molecular Shockley–Read–Hall recombination and ion diffusion. Remarkably, the thickness of TiO2 does not affect the PSC performance, which contributes significantly to the robust fabrication and high reproducibility of this kind of PSC.182 Liu et al. utilized a low-cost lanthanide halide, SmBr3, as a modification layer, inserting it into the interface between TiO2/CsPbI2Br, as shown in Fig. 14a–f.38 From the viewpoint of element doping, SmBr3 enhances the interface by binding with oxygen from TiO2 and intercalating into the CsPbIBr2 lattice with a gradient distribution simultaneously. The substitution of Pb by Sm contributes to the band structure variation, resulting in a gradient energy band with a hole blocking function. Meanwhile, the SmBr3 interface layer has a positive influence on the growth of perovskite, and a more compact and pinhole-free CsPbIBr2 layer is formed on the TiO2/SmBr3 substrate, as demonstrated by a top-view SEM image (Fig. 14d). Similarly, Zhang et al. found that CsBr layered between TiO2 and CsPbIBr2 benefitted the band alignment, thus suppressing carrier recombination and improving carrier transport.183 Feng et al. exposed the mystery behind the CsBr interfacial modifier through first-principles calculations.184 The charge difference indicator, Δρ, suggests that the accumulation of charge mainly occurs on Ti and O atoms, while depletion occurs underneath Cs and Br atoms (Fig. 14g). Another indicator, namely the charge displacement (ΔQ) curve, was employed to describe charge transfer across the interface (Fig. 14h). The positive ΔQ value in the CsBr/TiO2 interfacial region implies that charge is transferred from CsPbBr3 to the TiO2 ETL. Meanwhile, the negative ΔQ value on the perovskite side of the PbBr2/TiO2 interface explains the weaker optical absorption and lower VOC values of PbBr2/TiO2 films and solar devices. The integrated local density of states demonstrated an offset junction with staggered gap (type II) interface states. Furthermore, the more decreased interfacial bandgap of the CsBr/TiO2 interface spurred a tunneling effect (Fig. 14i), boosting the performance of the corresponding CsPbBr3 PSC.

Stability is another challenge facing ETLs. To enhance the stability of the ETL and the corresponding inorganic PSC, Chen et al. deposited carbide-titanium oxide (c-TiO2) on CsPbI2Br perovskite film to form p-i-n inorganic PSCs, as shown in Fig. 14j–l.185 The in situ c-AFM results suggest that the c-TiO2 film has higher thermal stability than the PCBM film. The stable morphology and electrical properties of c-TiO2 contribute to its associated PSCs achieving long-term stability.


3.1.2. SnO2. 
Compared with TiO2, which requires a high sintering temperature to remove organic materials and to enhance crystallinity, a low-temperature of <200 °C is required to fabricate SnO2, making it a promising alternative to TiO2 as an ETL.186 Apart from the low-temperature process, SnO2 has other splendid properties for acting as an ETL in inorganic PSCs: (i) a deep CBM and well-matched energy structure, as shown in Fig. 13c; (ii) high bulk electron mobility (240 cm2 V−1 S−1) and high conductivity to enhance electron dynamics; (iii) a wide bandgap (3.6–4.0 eV) and high transmittance to maximize the incident light reaching the perovskite layer; and (iv) excellent chemical stability.169 The inorganic PSCs with the best performances based on SnO2 are summarized in Table 4.

Since the properties of SnO2 are significantly affected by the processing method and conditions, modifications and/or the post-treatment of SnO2 are necessary.169 Meanwhile, attaining high-performance inorganic PSCs is still hindered by VOC loss, which is related to energy band matching and interfacial defects. Therefore, interface engineering is developed to enhance the band alignment between the SnO2 and CsPbX3 layers, simultaneously passivating defects. You et al. inserted an inorganic shunt-blocking layer of lithium fluoride (LiF) between SnO2 and CsPbI3−xBrx perovskites, elevating the CBM of SnO2 and suppressing the surface defects, as shown in Fig. 15a.187 The better band alignment and the passivation effect of the LiF layer boosted VOC from 1.08 to 1.18 V (Fig. 15b and c). Yip et al. also found severe VOC losses in CsPbI2Br devices. To alleviate this dilemma, they proposed a SnO2/ZnO bilayered ETL to facilitate better cascade energy level alignment with superior electron extraction capacity, as shown in Fig. 15d.188 Accordingly, suppressed interfacial recombination and greater electron extraction efficiency contributed to a 0.17 V increase in VOC. Similarly, Zhang et al. deposited a TiO2 layer on a SnO2 ETL through an atomic layer deposition method to improve the CsPbIBr2 film morphology and form a cascade energy level alignment, and VOC was improved from 1.11 V to 1.27 V.191

Apart from mismatched energy levels, other problems relating to solution processed SnO2 are its low crystallization and inferior electron mobility at low annealing temperatures. Tang et al. controlled the bandgap and energy level of SnO2 QDs through changing the aging time of the SnO2 QDs during the synthesis process, as shown in Fig. 15e and f.189 The optimized aging time of 36 h introducing band alignment, boosting VOC to 1.57 V. Very recently, Tang et al. implanted a TiCl4 hydrolyzed TiOxCl4−2x accessory layer on the SnO2 layer to simultaneously passivate oxygen-vacancy-related defects and to obtain an intermediate energy level at the ETL/perovskite interface.192 Meanwhile, the third function of the TiOxCl4−2x accessory layer was to improve the CsPbBr3 film morphology. Yip et al. also found that introducing an amino-functionalized polymer (PN4N) to the SnO2 ETL has triple functionality in CsPbI2Br PSCs: better surface wetting properties, promoting CsPbI2Br film morphology (Fig. 15g and h) and stability; more suitable energy level alignment; and passivating electronic surface trap states to reduce interfacial recombination.190


3.1.3. ZnO. 
Similar to SnO2, ZnO exhibits high potential for use as an ETL in PSCs due to its high bulk electron mobility, favorable energy level structure, wide bandgap with high transmittance, and easy fabrication.193–196 Meanwhile, its established application both in p-i-n and n-i-p structures is another attractive merit of ZnO.197,198 Besides, diverse ZnO structures, such as nanoparticles and nanorods,199–201 can be fabricated at low temperatures, contributing to their integration into flexible PSCs.202 The basic nature of ZnO with surface hydroxyl groups and/or residual acetate ligands leads to the deprotonation of methylammonium cations, causing the decomposition of the hybrid perovskite film.203 Although dilemmas relating to ZnO-based hybrid PSCs exist, ZnO ETLs show extraordinary performance in inorganic PSCs, as summarized by a summary of efficiency records (Table 5).

Tang et al. doped a classical alkali metal carbonate, Cs2CO3, to tune the energy levels and electrical properties of a sol–gel-derived ZnO ETL in CsPbI2Br PSCs, as shown in Fig. 16a and d.204 After Cs+ partially substituted Zn2+, the combination of O2− dangling bonds and Cs+ forms a permanent dipole moment pointing to Zn2+ at the ZnO surface, reducing the work function from 4.0 to 3.7 eV. Accordingly, matched energy level alignment between ZnO:Cs2CO3 and CsPbI2Br is achieved, promoting the VOC from 1.13 to 1.28 V. Our group recently added NH4Cl to the ZnO precursor to lower the work function of the ZnO ETL.21 As a result, band alignment between the ETL and CsPbIBr2 perovskite occurred, improving the electron mobility and reducing interfacial recombination (Fig. 16e). Consequently, the VOC and PCE values were elevated significantly compared with the control devices (Fig. 16f).

Interface modification is another strategy for dealing with interfacial recombination. Hao et al. developed an ambidextrous strategy through the doping engineering of the ZnO ETL and inserting a TiO2 buffer layer between ZnO and CsPbI3.205 On one hand, the interfacial layer relieves the energy band bending and structural disorder of CsPbI3. On the other hand, the conductivity of the ZnO/TiO2 bilayer is enhanced upon increasing the doping concentration of ZnO, due to strong interactions between the TiO2 and ZnO layers. Yip et al. also integrated a ZnO/SnO2 bilayer into PSCs to enhance the electron extraction efficiency at the cathode interface.206 In p-i-n structured CsPbI2Br PSCs, the use of a ZnO/C60 bilayer is demonstrated as an effective strategy to form band alignment and enhance the electron extraction efficiency, as shown in Fig. 16g and h.138
Similar to the bilayer concept, novel core–shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles were developed by Yang et al. to improve the photovoltaic performance of CsPbI2Br PSCs, and the details are shown in Fig. 16i and g.207 The enhanced electron mobility and CsPbI2Br film morphology contribute to the achievement of high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. In addition, doping engineering of the ZnO ETL regulates the CsPbI2Br film morphology. Song et al. demonstrated that thickness-insensitive Al-doped ZnO not only provides an appropriate energy level structure to improve the VOC but it also enhances the quality of perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 16k.208


3.1.4. Other emerging inorganic ETLs. 
Unfortunately, the performances of devices using traditional ETLs still suffer from problems such as the UV-light instability of TiO2 and the chemical instability of ZnO. To solve these issues, numerous emerging metallic compounds, i.e., Nb2O5,210 ZnMgO,180 In2S3,211 and CeOx,212 have been exploited as good alternatives to traditional ETLs. Chu et al. deposited compact amorphous Nb2O5 film as an ETL in inorganic planar CsPbBr3 PSCs through a magnetron sputtering method at room temperature.210 Compared with high-temperature (500 °C) fabricated crystalline Nb2O5 and TiO2, the amorphous Nb2O5 exhibited a higher PCE and stability (Fig. 17a and b), which is attributed to the well-matched energy structure, high transmittance, lower interfacial recombination, and improved perovskite film morphology. Wang et al. provided a solution-processing method to attain crystalline Nb2O5, which is integrated into p-i-n CsPbI2Br PSCs to form a bilayer with PCBM.213 Similarly, the PCE and stability were improved after inserting crystalline Nb2O5. In 2019, our group fabricated an In2S3 ETL via a chemical bath method. It was found that the CsPbIBr2 perovskite film morphology and PSC performance were highly dependent on the duration of the chemical bath reaction. By regulating the deposition time of In2S3 films to 85 min, the PSCs achieved the highest PCEs with reduced hysteresis and prolonged stability (Fig. 17c–e).211 To solve the issues of thermal instability and mismatched band alignment induced by the ZnO ETL in CsPbI2Br, Hong et al. developed a ternary metal oxide, i.e., ZnMgO, to substitute for the ZnO ETL, as shown in Fig. 17f–h.180 The optimum energy structure of ZnMgO could be approached via tuning the Mg concentration. Meanwhile, the degradation trigger, i.e., hydroxyl groups or residual acetate ligands, is mitigated via Mg doping, which contributes to the improved stability.

3.2 Organic ETLs
Organic n-type materials like fullerene, graphdiyne, and their derivatives have been widely exploited as ETLs. Organic ETLs allow easy solution processing and good flexibility. However, they are usually expensive and weak in terms of photo-, thermal-, and moisture-stability, and this should be evaluated comprehensively when device stability is considered. Generally, organic ETLs are located at the top in p-i-n configuration because they can be dissolved in perovskite precursor solvents. Numerous organic materials have been synthesized as ETLs or as dopants for ETLs to allow band alignment with the adjacent perovskite. Mai et al. tailored C60 via a co-doping strategy, i.e. with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) and a non-hygroscopic lithium salt (LiClO4), to construct efficient ETLs, resulting in remarkably enhanced VOC values for CsPbI2Br PSCs (Fig. 18a).214 The LUMO level of C60 decreased as a result of TPFPB doping (Fig. 18b). Meanwhile, the electron mobility is enhanced by LiClO4, leading to a reduction in hysteresis and the facile fabrication of large-area devices. Ding et al. designed a novel non-fullerene ETM, SFX-PDI2, and combined it with PC61BM to form a binary ETL (Fig. 18c).215 The cascade energy structure of the PSC accelerated electron mobility (Fig. 18d), boosting the PCE to 15.12%, which is the highest value reported for a p-i-n planar structured all-inorganic PSC to date.

4. HTLs and the CsPbX3/HTL interface
The rocketing performance improvements of inorganic PSCs have been significantly stimulated by the continuous development of solid-state hole transport materials (HTMs). An ideal HTL tends to possess the following merits: (i) suitable energy levels and high hole mobility for effective hole extraction; (ii) straightforward synthesis and purification processes; (iii) low cost; (iv) high photochemical and thermal stabilities; (v) the use of a solvent that is harmless to the perovskite film in n-i-p PCSs; and (vi) high transmittance.216–218 Several p-type materials, such as conducting polymers, organic small molecules, metallic compounds, and inorganic semiconductors, have been exploited to see whether they meet one or more of the criteria listed above and shown in Fig. 19a. However, the inferior PCEs, instabilities, and costs of the related inorganic PSCs are still issues. Among the diverse HTMs available, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), a triphenylamine (TPA)-based HTM, is the most widely used material for fabricating HTLs, and it was exploited by Park et al. in 2012.219 This breakthrough catalyzed dramatic developments in the PSC field. However, Spiro-OMeTAD still suffers drawbacks, such as low hole mobility, complicated and high-cost synthesis, hydrophilicity, and dopant-induced instability, as shown in Fig. 19b.220–222 Accordingly, diverse HTMs, including inorganic and organic materials, have been developed to replace Spiro-OMeTAD, and the valence band maximum (VBM) or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) values of commonly-used HTLs are summarized in Fig. 19c. Parallel to the fast development of HTLs, the interface between the HTL and inorganic CsPbX3 film is another important issue for accelerating hole extraction and transport to the electrode.

4.1 Inorganic HTLs
Easily fabricated inorganic p-type semiconductors with proper energy structures and stability are promising HTL candidates for integration into PSCs. These p-type semiconductors, including NiOx, CuI, Co3O4, and MoOx, have been successfully applied in inorganic PSCs. Mai et al. developed solution-processed NiOx HTLs in CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 inverted systems (Fig. 20a), confirming the effectiveness of the NiOx HTL in inorganic PSCs.112,138 However, this solution process needs an ultra-high sintering temperature (400 °C), potentially corroding the conductivity of the transparent conducting oxide electrodes. To overcome this dilemma, Tang et al. fabricated a NiOx HTL for CsPbI2Br PSCs via DC reactive magnetron sputtering, as seen in Fig. 20b. The O2 gas flux and film thickness were precisely controlled, optimizing the target voltage, transmittance, deposition rate, and resistivity.223 Since NiOx needs a high-energy deposition process, it is unsuitable for deposition on fragile organic perovskite films. However, this thermal obstacle is relieved in CsPbX3 PSCs, which are stable at temperatures under 250 °C. Accordingly, several n-i-p inorganic PSCs based on NiOx HTLs have been developed with good photovoltaic performance and stability.224,225 Chen et al. deposited oleylamine (OAM)-tailored NiO QDs on CsPbI2Br film to fabricate all-inorganic PSCs, as shown in Fig. 20c.225 The tailored NiO QD film exhibited compact, pinhole-free morphology and excellent charge-extraction capabilities, which were contributed to by band alignment with the adjacent perovskite. These merits enhance the PCE and stability. Apart from NiOx, other p-type metal oxides like MoO3 have also been integrated into CsPbX3 PSCs as an addition to the HTL. Hao et al. inserted a thin MoO3 layer between Spiro-OMeTAD and the Ag electrode to accelerate hole extraction and transport to the electrode.226 Liu et al. exploited a new HTM, Co3O4, and applied it to CsPbI2Br PSCs, as shown in Fig. 20d.227 Compared with the Fermi level of the carbon electrode, the deeper VBM of Co3O4 restrained interfacial recombination and thus enhanced hole extraction efficiency, resulting in improved performance.

4.2 Organic HTLs
As mentioned above, there is a tradeoff between hole mobility and stability in a Spiro-OMeTAD HTL, since hole-accelerating dopants such as bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI), cobalt(III) complexes, and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) are hygroscopic and deliquescent.222 Therefore, the concept of dopant-free organic HTLs is catching on, and some outstanding organic materials such as PTAA and P3HT have been successfully exploited in inorganic PSCs.228,229 Also, continuous efforts are being made to improve inorganic PSC performance based on novel organic HTLs.28 Ma et al. adopted the undoped conjugated polymer poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl] (PTB7) as the HTL in CsPbI3 PSCs, as shown in Fig. 21a and b.230 Meanwhile, they also compared PTB7 with Spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT. The carrier lifetime histogram (Fig. 21c) suggests that using PTB7 as a HTL can effectively passivate surface trap states through synergistic passivation via sulfur and carbonyl groups. Therefore, the carrier lifetime of CsPbI3 QD film is significantly reduced after PTB7 is used to form the HTL (Fig. 21d), resulting in an accelerated hole extraction rate. To solve difficulties related to the processability and batch-to-batch variations of polymeric materials such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), Yip et al. designed the dopant-free organic small molecule TPE-S, based on tetraphenylethylene, to act as the HTL in p-i-n CsPbI2Br PSCs, as shown in Fig. 21e.231 Based on DFT calculations, the twisty molecular geometry of TPE-S is beneficial for weakening intermolecular interactions (Fig. 21f). Meanwhile, the electrostatic potential surface image suggests that more negative charge is distributed around the S atoms of TPE-S, potentially providing Lewis base anchors to coordinate with Pb2+ vacancies. Apart from the mentioned novel organic materials, vast numbers of emerging organic HTLs, such as pseudo-two-dimensional (2D) p–π conjugated polymers,232 PTAA derivatives,233 and PTAA doped with polymer donors,234 have been designed and synthesized for use in inorganic PSCs as well.

5. All inorganic PSCs with a carbon electrode
Concerning the well-known “golden triangle” of PSC commercialization (efficiency, stability and cost), cooperation between inorganic CsPbX3 thin film and an inorganic carbon electrode is the most promising solution.235 Carbon electrodes have numerous merits: (i) the efficiency issue is tackled by the high conductivity and suitable work function (5.0 eV), which contribute to effective current conduction and hole extraction, even without an expensive HTL;236 (ii) the stability issue is solved by the use of an ultra-thick carbon electrode with a thickness of over 10 μm, which remarkably reduces the H2O/O2 penetration that induces the perovskite degradation and halide corrosion that occurs in normal metal electrodes;237 and (iii) the cost issue is overcome, as the most expensive parts of PSCs are the organic HTL and metal electrode (especially Au), and these could be replaced by a cheap carbon alternative. Meanwhile, diverse carbonaceous allotropes (Fig. 22b), including amorphous carbon,236 graphite,238 graphene,239 and carbon nanotubes, have been successfully applied in inorganic PSCs. A common fabrication process of carbon-based PSCs is the screen-printing technique in air, which is shown in Fig. 22c.240 A small solar photovoltaic power system has been installed in Wuhan, China, consisting of several small carbon-based modules fabricated by the WonderSolar company, as shown in Fig. 22d.241

Although carbon electrodes show competent performance in HTL-free devices, the large energy difference between perovskite and carbon is still a shortcoming, as the sluggish carrier dynamics accelerate significant and detrimental interfacial recombination. The most favorable solution is using a band alignment strategy to tackle these severe energy losses at the interface.243 Element-doping the carbon electrode is a successful strategy to increase the work function of the carbon electrode to form a cascade energy structure. Tang et al. incorporated polyaniline/graphite (PANi/G) composites into the carbon electrodes of CsPbBr3 PSCs to modulate the work function and to improve the hole extraction abilities of the back electrode, as shown in Fig. 23a.238 As a result, the enhanced energy level alignment and interfacial hole extraction lead to remarkably reduced energy loss and charge recombination, boosting the efficiency to 8.87% (Fig. 23b). Similarly, the work function of a MoO2/N-doped carbon nanosphere composite can be regulated based on the N concentration (Fig. 23c), where enhanced energy level alignment results in a reduction of energy loss and performance improvements (Fig. 23d).244

Reproduced with permission;243 copyright: 2019, Elsevier. 
Another effective strategy for reducing the energy difference between carbon and CsPbX3 film is interface engineering. Tang et al. reported a carbon-based CsPbBr3 PSC with a red phosphorus quantum dot (RPQD) mediator between the perovskite film and carbon electrode (Fig. 23e). The introduced intermediate energy level accelerates holes extraction and suppresses interfacial charge recombination, yielding a decent PCE of 8.20% under one sun illumination.245 Later, in 2019, the same group inserted ternary CuInS2/ZnS alloy quantum dots (CISZ-QDs) between CsPbBr3 and the carbon electrode for efficient hole extraction under local built-in potentials, without destroying the interface structures.246 Qiao et al. reported an effective strategy that employs P3HT as the interfacial layer to modify the CsPbBr3/carbon interface (Fig. 23g).243 The function of the P3HT layer is to suppress charge recombination and thus enhance the hole extraction capacity via the formation of a cascade energy level alignment between CsPbBr3 film and the carbon electrode (Fig. 23h). To address the serious issue of charge recombination at the CsPbBr3/carbon interface, Ding et al. modified a polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) polymer with a carbonyl group to function as: (i) an interface passivator to reduce perovskite surface defect states; and (ii) an energy-level elevator to improve energy-level alignment between CsPbBr3 and the carbon electrode.239 Meanwhile, the introduction of a graphene oxide layer further promoted the carrier dynamics by allowing more efficient hole extraction and decreasing energy-level differences. Accordingly, a modified PSC with an FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/PVAc/GO/carbon structure achieved a record-high PCE of 9.53%, an improvement of 44.0% compared with the PCE of 6.62% for the pristine device.
The sticky nature of carbon paste means it can tolerate moderate amounts of pinholes in thick CsPbIBr2 film. Such pinholes profit the crystalline grains in the perovskite film, leading to larger sizes, higher crystallinity, less microstrain, and fewer defects. Zhu et al. regulated the spin-coating time to control the pinhole densities, where an increased spin-coating time decreases the pinhole density, as shown in Fig. 24a.247 Meanwhile, they found that an optimized pinhole density and perovskite film thickness (∼700 nm) contribute to more favorable carrier dynamics (Fig. 24b) instead of the formation of notorious shutting paths in the final device (Fig. 24c). Compared to the strategy of increasing the perovskite film thickness to offset the influence of the pinholes, another approach is to insert a mediating layer between the perovskite film and carbon electrode. Liu et al. demonstrated that Cu-phthalocyanine (CuPc) was not only a suitable blocker to avoid direct contact between the carbon electrode and TiO2 ETL (Fig. 24d), but also an effective hole transporter (Fig. 24e).248 As a result, the PCE increased to 6.21% with significantly enhanced JSC owing to suppressed charge recombination and a more effective charge transfer process.

6. Roadmap toward commercialization
6.1 Hysteresis
The notorious hysteresis in hybrid PSCs has been well addressed in recent years.249 However, inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs suffer the torment of hysteresis, hindering the road to commercialization.105,141,146,250 Previous studies have pointed out that the hysteresis could be ascribed to ion migration,251 interfacial carrier dynamics,252,253 and charge trapping and de-trapping processes.254 A theoretical study by Choy et al. suggested a complicated hysteresis mechanism at the interface between the perovskite and HTL.44 Internal-electrostatic-field-driven ion migration occurs in the perovskite absorber with accumulation at the interfaces, i.e., perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL. Meanwhile, the migrated and accumulated ions contribute to the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the internal field. Accordingly, in different bias directions, carrier transport will be affected by the reconstructed injection barrier, surface recombination and additional surface ohmic loss and current leakage. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that I-rich CsPbI(1+x)Br(2−x) is likely formed at grain boundaries and segregates as clusters inside the film, where vast numbers of mobile ions move along the boundaries and finally pile up at the interfaces causing a larger injection barrier.36 Accordingly, numerous remedies have been developed to alleviate and eliminate severe hysteresis in CsPbX3 PSCs. The first strategy is balancing the electron flux and hole flux through increasing the interfacial area using mesoscopic TiO2,233 and increasing electron mobility at the interface.21,180 Improving the CsPbX3 film quality is another effective strategy to tackle hysteresis via (i) increasing the grain size and reducing grain boundaries, which will shut down ion moving channels;111 and (ii) doping with large metal cations to suppress halide migration and phase segregation.82 Furthermore, some reports have stated that a trap density decrease will relieve hysteresis.142,250 Zhao et al. found that the PSCs based on CsPbI3 with high DMAI additive content show small hysteresis, which was attributed to the improved crystallinity and enlarged crystal grain size.30 Other work by Nazeeruddin et al. revealed that faster carrier transport due to reduced trap density resulted in minor photocurrent hysteresis in CsPbI3 PSCs.250
6.2 Large-area and reliable modules
The final step for moving inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs towards commercialization is to fabricate large-area and reliable photovoltaic modules, from mini-modules to a whole PV system. Currently, most studies stay in laboratories, where small-area devices (<1 cm2) are typically fabricated through spin-coating methods, as discussed above. Fortunately, more and more novel technologies for large-area fabrication have been developed, such as blade coating,100 spray coating,35 and screen printing,255 albeit with decreases in PCEs.243 Furthermore, before their actual application, the CsPbX3 modules should pass specific endurance tests, such as IEC 61625, designed for crystalline silicon terrestrial photovoltaic modules.256 Meanwhile, the modules should have the capacity to overcome some operational problems, such as hot spots and partial shading. Cells that have hot spots or are partially shaded would act as a load under reverse bias, where the enormous power dissipation occurring in the small cell can result in local overheating. A good strategy to solve the issues of hot spots and partial shading is to employ a by-pass diode to shunt the affected cells.
6.3 Operational stability
Under real operational conditions, involving issues such as moisture, heat, oxygen, UV-light, partial shading, and temperature variations, it is required that solar cells should properly operate at the maximum power point for long durations.53 However, long-term stability is still a severe challenge facing the PSC community. The origins of operational stability issues mainly involve four aspects: intrinsic perovskite film and interfacial defects,257 the dopant-induced instability of Spiro-OMeTAD,258 the UV-light vulnerability of TiO2 ETLs,259 and metal-electrode-migration-induced degradation.260 Notorious photoinduced halide segregation and ion migration usually generate Pb0 and I0 defects or vacancies in the perovskite film and at interfaces during device operation. These defects have two roles that affect the PSCs performance: recombination centers deteriorate device efficiency, and degradation initiators hamper device lifetimes.257 Nevertheless, numerous works mentioned above have shown encouraging results for greatly improving operation stability via defect passivation. Tang et al. used transition metals to reduce the trap-state density to prolong device stability up to 760 h without attenuation under an 80% RH air atmosphere.88 Choy et al. proposed facile ABA incorporation with NGBr surface mediation using CsPbI3 perovskite to passivate defects and enhance the operational stability of the device to 500 h under continuous white light LED illumination.123 Meanwhile, the instability of Spiro-OMeTAD toward heat and humidity induced by the LiTFSI dopant further deteriorates the operational stabilities of PSCs. Alternative approaches include the use of other dopant-free organic HTLs and inorganic HTLs, as mentioned above, which would address the instability issues. For instance, Im et al. integrated P3HT as the HTL into CsPbI2Br PSCs, where only 10% degradation was detected after 1000 h of continuous light soaking at 85 °C.233 To address UV-light instability, an easy way is to replace TiO2 with another metal oxide (ZnO, SnO2, etc.) without sacrificing the PCE. Recently, we reported a SnO2-based CsPbIBr2 PSC with excellent long-term stability, where the PCE was maintained above 90% after 1250 h under a 25% RH air atmosphere.39 The last challenge relating to operation stability is metal migration from the metal electrode (Au/Ag) under thermal stress.260 Chen et al. inserted a thin but compact semimetal Bi interlayer between the PCBM ETL and Ag electrode to insulate the perovskite from moisture and protect the Ag electrode from iodine corrosion, and the PCE was retained at 88% after 6000 h under dark air conditions.261 Meanwhile, as mentioned above, carbon electrodes are one of the most promising solutions for fabricating stable and efficient all-inorganic PSCs.
7. Conclusions and perspectives
After severe years of development, inorganic PSCs have achieved significant progress, not only in terms of device conversion efficiencies but also related to stability against heat, moisture, oxygen, and UV irradiation. Up to now, the record PCE values of CsPbI3-, CsPbI2Br-, CsPbIBr2-, and CsPbBr3-based PSCs are 19.03%, 16.79%, 10.88%, and 10.91%, respectively, approaching 70% of the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) efficiency limits shown in Fig. 1. However, there is a long way to go for inorganic PSCs to attain the performance of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs, whose PCEs are over 80% of the SQ limits. Specifically, CsPbI3 perovskite suffers intrinsic crystal phase instability, albeit with a superior bandgap for light absorption; on the contrary, CsPbBr3 perovskite is the most stable from a phase stability angle, but it has the largest bandgap, which is insufficient for converting the incident light completely. Meanwhile, Br-salt insolubility affects the perovskite film quality, where the defect-induced bandgap fluctuations and the deficient management of the trap-density corrod the VOC values of Br-based inorganic PSCs. Furthermore, carefully selecting suitable electron and hole transport materials, and optimizing the interracial layers is crucial for controlling the carrier dynamics and reducing energy losses. Accordingly, the future development of inorganic PSCs requires the judicious design and fabrication of each essential functional layer, such as perovskite film, the electron transport layer (ETL), and the hole transport layer (HTL), and the interfaces. For the transport layers, i.e., the ETL and HTL, some critical characteristics, such as charge mobility, energy level alignment, trap states, morphology, and interfacial properties, are essential for determining the final performances of PSCs. In detail, the carrier mobilities of the ETL and HTL determine the transport and collection efficiencies of photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively. The ETL/perovskite/HTL energy level alignment can effectively accelerate carrier transport to increase JSC and FF, while well-matched Femi levels will contribute to enhanced VOC. Therefore, doping engineering and growth-condition optimization are very helpful for enhancing carrier mobilities and modifying the energy structures of the ETL and HTL. Meanwhile, the trap states and interfacial properties also play important roles in charge transport. Therefore, interfacial engineering with wide-band semiconductors or insulators is a useful tool to passivate the interfacial defects and, thus, non-radiative recombination.
Spin-coating perovskite solutions is still the dominant method for fabricating inorganic perovskite films. Therefore, precursor engineering, including solvent selection, composition stoichiometry, and additive modulation, plays an important role to the final perovskite film quality. The precursor solvent has a direct impact on inorganic perovskite crystallization; thus, the solvent should meet certain physical requirements relating to factors such as solubility, boiling point, vapor pressure, and dielectric constant. However, there is potential incompatibility between spin-coating methods and large-scale fabrication. The ingenious combination of the mechanisms of precursor engineering and large-scale fabrication will lead to breakthroughs facilitating the commercialization of inorganic PSCs.
The phase instabilities of inorganic CsPbX3, especially iodine-rich analogs, and the intrinsic defects are bottlenecks in the performance of CsPbX3 PSCs. Element doping, especially at the lead sites, is a fundamental solution to improve device performance and mitigate lead toxicity. Compared to their undoped counterparts, doped inorganic perovskites usually exhibit distinct improvements in optical and electronic properties, including enhanced stabilities, new energy band structures, reduced trap-state densities, and improved film morphologies, thus contributing to the excellent performances of the corresponding inorganic PSCs. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the essential mechanism of element doping, such as where the introduced element is located. Since perovskite lattice doping or interstitial site doping would affect the optical and electronic properties of CsPbX3 materials, there is still significant controversy regarding the location of lattice doping.
After the judicious design of the inorganic perovskite precursor and composition, careful control of the film growth and a fundamental understanding of the crystallization process are helpful for obtaining high-quality CsPbX3 perovskite film with the following merits: (i) being compact and pinhole-free, avoiding shunt currents; (ii) having sufficient film thickness, utilizing the incident light; and (iii) showing enhanced phase stability and phase purity. However, controversy regarding solvent evaporation and perovskite crystallization emphasize the importance of a gradient thermal annealing method for attaining high-quality perovskite films. We believe that it is essential to explore the relationship between the solvent evaporation rate, perovskite nucleation, and crystallization, with the subsequent selection of an appropriate antisolvent and thermal annealing process. Meanwhile, fabricating CsPbX3 perovskite film at low temperature without compromising film quality is attractive for flexible application. Furthermore, some organic materials with specific functional groups are proper candidates for post-treating low-temperature processed CsPbX3 film to passivate the defects and to accelerate charge transport.
Choosing and modulating a proper ETL and the ETL/perovskite interface will lead to advances in accelerating electron transport and suppressing carrier recombination, contributing to enhanced photovoltaic performance and environmental stability. Traditional TiO2 ETLs suffer from UV-induced instability, contributing to the short lifetimes of CsPbX3 PSCs. Other alternatives, such as SnO2 and ZnO, have shown their huge potential in the PSC community, with the possibility of low-temperature fabrication. Now attention is largely paid to the ETL/perovskite interface and band-alignment to accelerate electron transport and suppress charge recombination. Meanwhile, we suggest that future work should make an overall consideration of the driving force and voltage losses because of the band difference between the ETL and perovskite.
For CsPbX3 PSCs with a normal n-i-p configuration, organic HTLs (Spiro-OMeTAD) still prevail, albeit with some issues relating to instability and high cost. Hydrophilic HTLs are a key contributor to the instability of CsPbX3 PSCs. Now it is most urgent to replace Spiro-OMeTAD with a more stable material without sacrificing the PCE. Carbon electrodes are a possible candidate to fulfill a HTL-free configuration, and they have been widely used in CsPbBr3 and CsPbIBr2 PSCs. Meanwhile, carbon electrodes meet the requirements of large-scale fabrication, low-cost and prolonged lifetime, effectively supporting the well-known “golden triangle” of PSC commercialization.
