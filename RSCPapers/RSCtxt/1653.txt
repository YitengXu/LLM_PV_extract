    , Accepted 11th August 2020First published on 12th August 2020AbstractTin perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are rising as the most promising candidates for lead-free PSCs. However, the randomly crystallized tin halide perovskite with a high concentration of defects is still the bottleneck for obtaining high efficiency. Here, we report the pretreatment of FASnI3 (formamidinium, FA) perovskite film by spin-coating a solution of organic halide salt n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) before annealing. It is found that PAI can induce the templated growth of FASnI3 crystals by reconstruction of the intermediate phase, resulting in a highly crystallized FASnI3 film with preferential orientation along the (100) plane and suppressed trap density. Finally, a stabilized efficiency of 11.22% was certified at an accredited test center and the cell is stable, maintaining over 95% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours of operation at the maximum power point.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells that use organic–inorganic lead halide semiconductors as light absorbers have achieved high efficiencies as well as improved stabilities after ten years of development.1–8 However, the risk for lead leakage could impede their commercialization. One way to solve this problem is to develop an effective encapsulation technique to sequestrate lead inside the devices.9,10 The other is to investigate lead-free alternatives.11–15 Among them, tin halide perovskites are the most promising candidates due to their narrow band gap, low exciton binding energy and high carrier mobility,16–19 but they often show fast crystallization processes and are easy to be oxidized, leaving behind a rough morphology and high-level concentration of defects, which limits the improvement in the performance of tin perovskite solar cells (TPSCs).20,21
To address these disadvantages, a lot of efforts have been devoted to optimizing the crystallization process. For example, π-conjugated Lewis base molecules, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and pseudohalogen were applied to form intermediate adducts with SnI2 to slow down the crystal growth.22–24 In addition, the long-chain ammonium cations such as ethylammonium, butylammonium and phenylethylammonium were used to induce the oriented crystallization of tin perovskites or to form 2D–3D structures to passivate the trap states and prevent the moisture.25–27 Recently, a few reports have published efficiencies over 12%.28,29 However, it is noticed that these cells were unstable under light soaking, and is difficult for them to obtain stabilized results under strict standards as are stipulated by accredited test centers. The reason can be attributed to the high defect density in TPSCs.11,16–20,29 Therefore, new methods are required for further improving the crystallization quality of tin halide perovskite films.
In this work, we report a pretreatment method for fabricating FASnI3 film by spin-coating a solution of n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) in a mixed solvent of chloroform (CF) and DMSO (100:1 v/v) right after the dripping of antisolvent. DMSO can dissolve the crystals at the surface to create a liquid phase environment and large cations of PAI successfully aggregate around the newborn nucleus of FASnI3 to form a template, which induces the templated growth of FASnI3 crystals (TG-FASnI3) along the (100) plane. In this way, PAI can be controlled at a much lower content compared to being used as an additive in precursor solution. It will not form 2D structures at the perovskite surface and thus guarantees the effective charge transport in the device. As a result, we obtained a highly crystallized and smooth TG-FASnI3 film with the defect density decreasing from 2.89 × 1016 cm−3 to 5.41 × 1015 cm−3. The highest stabilized efficiency of 11.22% was certified at an accredited test center (Newport Laboratory, USA). The cell can maintain over 95% of the initial efficiency after 1000 hours of operation at the maximum power point (MPPT) under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic fabrication process of the TG-FASnI3. Chlorobenzene was used as an antisolvent to induce the initial nucleation and crystal growth (Fig. 1a-I, II), but these crystals are randomly distributed (Fig. 1b-(1)), which will lead to a rough morphology as is measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 1b-(2)). This phenomenon was extensively reported due to the fast crystallization process of tin halide perovskites.23,30,31 In our method, we loaded a solution of PAI in CF/DMSO (100:1; v/v) onto the sample in Fig. 1b-(1) and spin coated it at 4000 rpm, immediately (Fig. 1a-III, IV) to realize the recrystallization of FASnI3 under the template formed by PAI. From Fig. 1b-(3), a smoother morphology of an intermediate phase with bright boundaries can be observed. The bright boundaries can be attributed to the gathering of PAI, which will be further confirmed. The crystal growth is completed after the annealing process (Fig. 1a-V, Fig. 1b-(4)). The surface roughness of FASnI3 is greatly reduced from 22.49 nm to 3.37 nm when PAI is applied, measured by atomic force microscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†). Grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) (Fig. S2, ESI†) was applied to analyze the chemical information of the intermediate phases in Fig. 1a stage II (before the treatment of PAI) and stage IV (after the treatment of PAI) with an incident angle of 0.2° (surface information) for tin perovskites in Fig. 1a stage II (before the treatment of PAI) and stage IV (after the treatment of PAI). It is found that in stage II, the intermediate phase obtained by dripping chlorobenzene is disordered with strong signals for both (100) and (102) planes while after the treatment of PAI, the intermediate phase shows a highly oriented growth along the (100) plane, indicating that PAI can serve as a template to promote the oriented crystallization. Other details about the fabrication of the perovskite films can be found in the Methods section.

(b) SEM images of FASnI3 (1) before and (2) after annealing. SEM images of TG-FASnI3 (3) before and (4) after annealing. (c) The XRD patterns of the tin halide perovskite films treated with different concentrations of PAI solution. (d) Normalized rocking curves of the corresponding tin halide perovskite films. The intensity of FASnI3 in the XRD patterns is multiplied by 100 to ease comparison. 
Note that the concentration of PAI solution we used in Fig. 1a and b was 2 mg ml−1, which was optimized as the main factor that affects the quality of TG-FASnI3 films by performing SEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests. From Fig. S3, ESI,† the morphology tends to become flat when PAI is applied with a concentration of 1 mg ml−1. However, when the concentration reaches 5 mg ml−1, PAI aggregates on the surface of the film, which is detrimental to the performance of TPSCs. In the corresponding XRD patterns (Fig. 1c), five XRD peaks are found to be located at 14.1°, 24.5°, 28.2°, 31.7°, and 40.5° in the pristine FASnI3 film, which can be assigned to the (100), (102), (200), (122), and (222) planes of orthorhombic structure, respectively.32,33 On pretreatment with PAI, a significant increase in the signals of the (h00) peaks and the suppression of the (102), (122), and (222) peaks are observed. Among all the samples, TG-FASnI3 treated with 2 mg ml−1 PAI solution shows the strongest intensities of the (h00) peaks, indicating a preferential orientation. To further evaluate the orientation, we performed the rocking curves of the (200) reflections (Fig. 1d) for these samples. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of a rocking curve is undefined for the pristine FASnI3 film, indicating that the pristine FASnI3 is a polycrystalline film with random orientation. In contrast, all the TG-FASnI3 films exhibit narrow FWHM with a minimum value of 2.0° when the concentration is fixed at 2 mg ml−1 (Fig. S4, ESI†). This is the lowest value among the reported FWHM of halide perovskite films.34,35 In addition to the concentration, the rate of spin-coating of PAI solution and the ratio of CF/DMSO had also been optimized (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). All the TG-FASnI3 samples mentioned below used the best conditions of 2 mg ml−1 PAI, 4000 rpm and 100:1 v/v (CF/DMSO).
To further confirm the location of PAI, we amplified the signals of the (100) peak in Fig. 1c and no change is found for PAI-treated samples in the peak positions compared to the pristine FASnI3 (Fig. S7, ESI†). This result means that PA cations will not enter the crystal lattice of FASnI3 and might locate at the grain boundaries, which is consistent with the SEM images of Fig. 1b-(3). According to a lot of previous works, the long-chain ammonium cations such as butylammonium and phenylethylammonium that are applied as additives tend to form a 2D structure on the surface of 3D FASnI3. To testify whether the 2D structure also formed in our method, we fabricated the pure 2D PA2SnI6 film. As a result, the XRD peaks of 2D PA2SnI6 (Fig. S8, ESI†) do not match with any peaks in TG-FASnI3 films. Considering that the signals of the 2D structure may be too weak to be detected by XRD, we then performed 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) with the incident angle of 0.1° and 1° to check the structure of FASnI3 and TG-FASnI3 from the top to the bulk (Fig. S9, ESI†). Similarly, no Debye–Scherrer rings or spots at a low q value between 0.4–0.8 Å−1 that can be assigned to the large lattice distance of 2D structures are observed for the TG-FASnI3 sample (Fig. S9c and d, ESI†),25,27,36 which means that the 2D structure does not exist in TG-FASnI3. Moreover, the FASnI3 sample displays diffraction Debye–Scherrer rings with an isotropical intensity distribution (Fig. S9a and b, ESI†), indicating considerable randomness in the orientation of the crystal domains. In contrast, sharp and discrete Bragg spots can be observed for TG-FASnI3, which means that the crystal domains are highly oriented with the (100) plane vertical to the substrate surface (Fig. S9c and d, ESI†). The radially integrated intensity plots along the (100) ring at q ≈ 1 Å−1 for FASnI3 and TG-FASnI3, plotted as a function of azimuthal angle are shown in Fig. S9e and f (ESI†), respectively. The emerging peak at the azimuthal angle of 90° for the TG-FASnI3 film with a narrow FWHM of ∼6.5° also demonstrates that preferential orientation, which is consistent with the results from the rocking curves in Fig. 1d.
The light absorption properties of FASnI3 and TG-FASnI3 are similar except for the stronger absorption at the long-wave band for TG-FASnI3, measured by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (Fig. S10, ESI†). Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was measured based on the architectures of glass/FASnI3, glass/FASnI3/C60 and glass/TG-FASnI3, and glass/TG-FASnI3/C60, respectively. PL spectroscopy that is sensitive to the defects is shown in Fig. 2a. An increase in PL intensity can be observed for TG-FASnI3 compared to FASnI3, which is consistent with the longer carrier lifetime measured by the time-resolved PL spectroscopy (TRPL) (Fig. 2b), indicating a reduction of non-radiative recombination centers in TG-FASnI3. In addition, TRPL for FASnI3/C60 and TG-FASnI3/C60 were measured and based on these results, and we calculated the electron diffusion length using the equation below: (1)where in eqn (1),D is the diffusion coefficient for electrons and k(x,t) is the recombination rate of the carriers. The initial distribution of excitons was assumed to be n(x,0) = n0exp(−Ax/L), where A is the absorbance of the FASnI3 and TG-FASnI3, and L is the thickness of the perovskite layer. The thickness of both films is about 170 nm, which can be found in the cross-section SEM images in Fig. 3a and b. The PL lifetime without the quencher of C60 is simulated to be 4.10 and 6.88 ns for FASnI3 and TG-FASnI3, respectively. After C60 is evaporated on the perovskite films, the lifetimes are correspondingly reduced to 2.74 and 1.70 ns. After calculation, the electron diffusion lengths for FASnI3 and TG-FASnI3 are about 77 nm and 182 nm, respectively. The longer electron diffusion length of TG-FASnI3 will reduce the recombination loss and be beneficial for improving the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the device.

The stability of the tin halide perovskite films was tested by XRD for 200 hours in a glove box with an oxygen concentration of around 100 ppm (Fig. 2c and d). The intensity of the (100) plane goes through a large decrease for FASnI3 and the peak appearing at 14.4° angle can be attributed to the oxidation of FASnI3 (Fig. 2c).37 In contrast, only a slight drop in the intensity of the (100) plane can be found for the TG-FASnI3 sample and no new peaks are observed. These results indicate that TG-FASnI3 has better resistance to oxygen, probably due to the high-quality crystals with less defects.
We then fabricated TPSCs with the structure of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/tin halide perovskites/C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag on an aperture area of 0.09 cm2. The cross-section SEM images for the devices based on FASnI3 and TG-FASnI3 are shown in Fig. 3a and b, which further demonstrates their big difference in morphology. The current–voltage (I–V) curves of the two devices are shown in Fig. 3c. The detailed device parameters under different scanning directions can be found in Table S1 (ESI†). The device based on FASnI3 obtained an efficiency of 7.93% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 22.10 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.53 V and a fill factor (FF) of 67.7%, which is similar to previous reports.38 In contrast, the efficiency of the device based on TG-FASnI3 is improved to 11.78% with VOC and FF increasing to 0.73 V and 72.0%, which may be attributed to the suppressed defects and the longer electron diffusion length in TG-FASnI3. One of our cells based on TG-FASnI3 was sent to Newport Laboratory, USA; a certified stabilized efficiency of 11.22% was obtained on an aperture area of 0.089 cm2, which is the highest stabilized efficiency measured at an accredited test center for TPSCs (Fig. S11–S13, ESI†).
The integrated current densities for the devices based on FASnI3 and TG-FASnI3 are calculated to be 22.43 mA cm−2 and 22.82 mA cm−2 from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. S14, ESI†), which are in good agreement with the JSC measured by I–V curves. Sixteen cells for each batch were fabricated and the performances are summarized in Fig. S15, ESI.† We can see an obviously higher reproducibility of the devices based on TG-FASnI3 than those based on FASnI3, which may be attributed to their better resistance to oxygen. We also investigated the operation stability of FASnI3 and TG-FASnI3 based cells. The TG-FASnI3 based cell that was encapsulated in a N2 glove box maintained over 95% of its initial efficiency after operating at maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under simulated illumination of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) for 1000 hours. In contrast, the FASnI3-based cell lost more than 60 percent of the performance within 500 hours (Fig. 3d). For one thing, the devices with less defects intrinsically show better operation stability under light bias according to previous reports.39–41 For another, TG-FASnI3 with high-quality crystals shows better resistance to oxygen as is confirmed by XRD in Fig. 2c and d.
To make a comparison, we fabricated reference devices using PAI as an additive in perovskite precursor solution. The concentration of PAI changed from 5 mol% to 15 mol% and the best efficiency of 9.78% was obtained when the molar ratio of PAI is 10 mol% (Fig. S16, ESI†). The lower efficiency may be attributed to the formation of a 2D structure on the 3D perovskite surface, which hindered the charge transport. In addition, we fabricated reference devices using only the mixed solvent of CF/DMSO (100:1 v/v) to do the pretreatment, which showed a similar performance with FASnI3 based cells (Fig. S17, ESI†). Furthermore, we also fabricated the TG-FASnI3 device with 5% SnI2 excess in the precursor solution. We found an increase in series resistance from the I–V curve (Fig. S18, ESI†), which might be due to the formation of a 2D–3D structure.
To fundamentally understand the enhancement in efficiency, we performed capacitance–voltage (C–V) characterization (Fig. S19, ESI†) to determine the defect density using Mott–Schottky equation: (2)where in eqn (2),Na is the defect density, C is the capacitance, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, ε is the dielectric constant of the absorber layer and A is the aperture area of the device. The calculated defect density of the TG-FASnI3 based device is ∼5.41 × 1015 cm−3, which is about one fifth of that in the FASnI3 based device (∼2.89 × 1016 cm−3). The lower defect density illustrates the suppressed Sn2+ oxidation and reduced trap states in the TG-FASnI3 based device. The dark currents for the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. S20, ESI;† the current leakage of the TG-FASnI3 based device is four times lower than that of the FASnI3 based device, which is consistent with the reduction in the charge-carrier density and indicates the efficient collection of photo-generated carriers.
We further tested the performance of the devices under different light intensities to calculate the ideality factors. As is shown in Fig. S21a, ESI,† both the devices based on FASnI3 and TG-FASnI3 show a linear relationship between JSC and light intensity, which indicates that there are no significant energy barriers existing in both devices. We analyzed the light intensity-dependent VOC (Fig. S21b, ESI†) according to the equation below: (3)where in eqn (3),n is the ideality factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38065 × 10−23 J K−1), q is the electric charge of one electron (1.6 × 10−19 C), T is the room temperature (298 K), and VOC is the obtained VOC under different light intensities of ϕ. After calculation, the ideality factors for the devices based on FASnI3 and TG-FASnI3 are 1.98 and 1.62, respectively. The lower value of ideality factor for the device based on TG-FASnI3 demonstrated the less Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination induced by defects. Correspondingly, the decay time of transient photovoltage of the device based on TG-FASnI3 prolongs from 12.4 μs to 56.5 μs (Fig. S22, ESI†). Detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1.

Conclusion
In summary, we successfully fabricated templated-growth FASnI3 films with high orientation and less defects and thereby increase the efficiency and stability of TPSCs. A stabilized efficiency of 11.22% was certified by an accredited test center. In this work, we noticed that although the defects of TPSC are suppressed by using our pretreatment method with PAI, the defect density in TPSC is still higher than that of lead-based PSCs (1013–1014 cm−3).42,43 This should be the main reason for the comparatively low efficiency of TPSCs. Further advances in the suppression of defects in TPSCs should enable the efficiency to exceed 15% with high working stability.
