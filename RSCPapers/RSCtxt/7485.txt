    , Accepted 3rd April 2023First published on 4th April 2023AbstractAs a special two-dimensional layered perovskite material, CsPb2Br5 has attracted great attention and shows great stability and excellent photoelectric performance. Herein, a simple and environment-friendly two-step method was used to prepare CsPb2Br5 microwires. The effect of substrate temperature on the growth process of the microwires was investigated. With the increase in substrate temperature, the amount of nucleation in the microwire increased, and the length of the microwire decreased from several millimeters to dozens of microns. A parasitic phase of CsPbBr3 was found in CsPb2Br5 through synchrotron radiation wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The in situ heating test of WAXS results showed that the CsPb2Br5 microwire had good structure thermostability, and no phase transformations were observed when the temperature increased to 350 °C before the thermal decomposition of CsPb2Br5. Spatial and temporal resolved fluorescence measurements reveal the distribution of defect states and carrier recombination processes in different regions of the microwires. The changes in fluorescence characteristics affected by annealing temperature suggested the evolution of defect states and components in the CsPb2Br5 microwires at different temperatures. A photodetector (PD) based on CsPb2Br5 microwires exhibits an “on/off” current ratio of 800, a short rise time of 43 ms and a decay time of 83 ms. After being placed in air without any package for 90 days, the photocurrent of the PD is still maintained at 82% of its initial value.
Introduction
In recent years, halide perovskite materials have developed rapidly in the fields of PDs,1–3 solar cells,4–7 photodiodes,8–10 and X-ray detectors11–14 due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. The photoelectric conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has achieved a breakthrough result of 25.2%,15 evidence of the strong competitiveness of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. However, the stability of organic–inorganic perovskites has always been a hurdle restricting the commercialization of perovskite devices. All-inorganic perovskite (Cs–Pb–X) materials with high stability are considered potential organic–inorganic perovskites alternatives16,17 and have been widely used in many kinds of optoelectronic devices.18–20
Currently, most all-inorganic perovskite devices are thin film-based ones. However, the performance of perovskite thin film optoelectronic devices would be affected by many properties of the thin films, such as the defect density and grain boundaries in the films. Defects and grain boundaries deviating from ideal conditions would deteriorate the photoexcited charges generation and recombination kinetics processes in the perovskite and lead to a reduction in the photocurrent and photoresponsivity of the device.21,22 Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate nano- or micro-structured perovskite materials, such as nano-micro wires,23,24 tubes,25,26 sheets,27,28 and so on. The unique anisotropic geometry of the nano-micro wire and its large surface-to-volume ratio enable its high light absorption;29 the carrier transport direction is bound by the wire structure, reducing possible exciton transport losses.30 In addition, perovskite nano–micro wires have excellent mechanical stability,31 and also facilitate the integrated application of nano–micro optoelectronic devices.32
Two-dimensional CsPb2Br5, a member of the Cs–Pb–Br family, has attracted the attention of researchers due to its high formation energy, good stability and low density of defect states. As a new type of two-dimensional material, CsPb2Br5 has a relatively unique crystal structure—the tetragonal crystal structure presents a layered two-dimensional structure, in which Cs+ ions are sandwiched between two layers of Pb2Br5− anions.33 Due to its unconventional two-dimensional structure, CsPb2Br5 has been widely studied in the field of optoelectronics. Han et al. reported the synthesis of green LEDs based on CsPb2Br5 nanoplatelets, showing a luminous efficiency of 34.49 lm W−1 at an operating current of 10 mA.34 A pure-phase CsPb2Br5 single crystal was prepared in concentrated hydrobromic acid, and the prepared CsPb2Br5-based deep ultraviolet detector showed high responsivity and a fast response speed.19 Zhi and coworkers prepared CsPb2Br5 nano–micro sheets using an antisolvent crystallization strategy, and the CsPb2Br5-based photoconductive PD exhibited a high specific detection rate and photoresponsivity.35 Ruan et al. first induced the synthesis of shape and crystal phase controlled perovskite-related CsPb2Br5 nanowires with mercaptan ligands, which showed high stability at high temperatures and high humidity.36 Ligands with long carbon chains are used as surface sealers to regulate the morphology of nanocrystals and stabilize nanocrystal colloids; however, this organic ligand poses a serious obstacle to charge transfer between ions. The development of a green and environmentally friendly synthesis of perovskites is also one of the research directions at present. Therefore, it is of great interest to directly synthesize all-inorganic CsPb2Br5 microwires without the help of organic surfactants.
At present, the luminescence mechanism of CsPb2Br5 still remains controversial, and researchers have provided explanations both theoretically and experimentally. Zhou's group suggested that the donor (VBr)–acceptor (CsPb) pair (DAP) resulted in a peak green emission of 2.30 eV which may be the source of green reflection in CsPb2Br5.37 Paribesh Acharyya et al. indicated that the photoluminescence (PL) of CsPb2Br5 nanosheets is caused by amorphous ammonium complexes containing PbBr42− and Pb2Br5− on the surface. These amorphous complexes cannot be detected by powder XRD, but can be detected by spectroscopic techniques as they have strong metal-centered s to p absorption bands and corresponding luminescence.38 Wang and coworkers ruled out point defects such as VBr as alternative mechanisms by using pressure-dependent Laman-PL, and they demonstrated that residual CsPbBr3 on the surface of CsPb2Br5 is responsible for the green light generation.39 Yu's group demonstrated that the coexistence of CsPb2Br5 and CsPbBr3 is inevitable in the synthesis of CsPb2Br5 using density functional theory (DFT) and they indicated that CsPbBr3 is the source of luminescence in the CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5 heterojunction.40 Therefore, the luminescence mechanism of CsPb2Br5 is the focus of current research and needs to be further explored.
In this work, we used a simple two-step self-assembly method to fabricate high-quality perovskite CsPb2Br5 microwires in water and ethanol. This method avoids the surface residues of oleic acid, oleamine and other long chain solvents. The process of self-assembly and growth of the microwires was studied. The morphology evolution of the microwires was controlled by controlling the substrate temperature and the growth mechanism was investigated. Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) was used to analyze the phase existing in the material, and it was found that there was a small amount of CsPbBr3 in the CsPb2Br5 microwires. We annealed CsPb2Br5 microwires to study the phase evolution and stability at high temperature. Two-dimensional fluorescence intensity and time-resolved PL were performed on a single microwire to study its photophysics and fluorescence kinetics. The PDs of perovskite microwires were prepared and their photoresponse characteristics were investigated.
Results and discussion
Self-assembled CsPb2Br5 microwires were synthesized using a two-step method at room temperature as described in the Experimental section, and the growth flow diagram is shown in Fig. 1. CsBr ethanol solution was added dropwise to the self-assembled PbBr2 microwires, and the PbBr2 microwires were rapidly converted into CsPb2Br5 microwires. The formula of the synthesis of CsPb2Br5 is as follows:38,40–42 CsBr + PbBr2 → CsPbBr3(1) CsPbBr3 + PbBr2 → CsPb2Br5(2)

From the synthesized molecular formula, CsPbBr3 appears as an intermediate product in the synthesis of CsPb2Br5. The PbBr2-rich synthesis environment is suggested to suppress the coexistence of CsPbBr3 and CsPb2Br5, and be conducive to obtaining the CsPb2Br5 phase.43

Fig. 2(a)–(c) show the optical images (OM) of PbBr2 microwires of different sizes grown at different substrate temperatures. The optical image in Fig. 2(a) shows the PbBr2 microwires at 20 °C with a length over 1 mm but in small quantity. As the temperature increases to 40 °C, the length decreases to a few tens of microns, and the width decreases accordingly, but the number of microwires increases a lot. When the temperature was increased to 60 °C, the growth deviation from the growth balance of microwires and exhibits other crystals form (Fig. S1, ESI†). Crystal growth is a kinetic process of the transformation from the metastable phase to stable phase, and a process of continuous formation and growth of crystal nuclei. The supersaturation state of the solution is a prerequisite for crystal growth and the supersaturation determines the nucleation rate and growth rate of the crystal.44 In nucleation theory, , V2 ∝ σ2, and , where V1 is the crystal nucleation rate, V2 is the crystal growth rate, N is the number of grains per unit area, which is inversely proportional to the grain size, and σ is the supersaturation of the perovskite precursor.45 The supersaturation curve in the crystal growth process is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), which is mainly divided into two stages. In stage A, as the solvent evaporates after being added dropwise onto the substrates, the supersaturation increases and reaches the maximum value. In the B stage, nucleus formation and crystal growth occur simultaneously, and the supersaturation decreases and gradually flattens out. When the substrate is at room temperature (20 °C), after the saturated PbBr2 solution is added to the substrate, with the slow volatilization of the solvent, the PbBr2 solution has a relatively lower supersaturation σ compared with that at higher substrate temperatures. In this condition, the crystal growth rate is higher, the number of as-prepared microwires is relatively less and the microwires are long and wide. When the substrate temperature rises to 40 °C, with the fast volatilization of the solvent after the PbBr2 saturated solution dropped on the substrate, the supersaturation σ of the PbBr2 solution increases quickly. The crystal nucleation rate V1 will increase much more quickly than the crystal growth rate V2 with the increase of σ, leading to a larger N than that in lower supersaturation σ at a low substrate temperature. The result of the competition between the nucleation and crystal growth is that the nucleation rate is greatly improved and a large number of smaller crystals are formed. Fig. 2(d)–(f) show the optical images of the conversion of PbBr2 microwires into CsPb2Br5 microwires. During the conversion from PbBr2 to CsPb2Br5, the microwires morphology does not change.

Fig. 3(a) shows the SEM image of the CsPb2Br5 microwires. The microwires are staggered and disordered in their distribution on the substrate, the lengths of longer microwires are over 1 mm and the widths range from 21.7 to 36.6 μm. Fig. 3(b) shows the local magnification in the red box in Fig. 3(a). It can be seen that the whole surface of the microwire is flat, and exhibits clear crystal edges and planes. To further understand the structure of the CsPb2Br5 microwire, a TEM image of the CsPb2Br5 microwire is displayed in Fig. 3(c). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 3(d)) show the crystalline planes spacing of the microwire are 0.3 and 0.23 nm, respectively corresponding to the (220) and (224) planes of the CsPb2Br5 crystal. We selected parts of the edge of the microwire in Fig. S3, ESI† (inside the red circle) for fine characterization of the CsPb2Br5 crystal, hoping to find the CsPbBr3 phase in the edge of CsPb2Br5. The HRTEM image in Fig. S3, ESI† shows that only a lattice fringe with a lattice spacing of 0.3 nm that can be indexed to the (220) crystal plane of CsPb2Br5 phase was obtained, and the parasitic CsPbBr3 phase at the edge of CsPb2Br5 mentioned as in other literatures39,46 could not be easily observed by TEM.

To determine the phase of CsPb2Br5 microwires, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to measure the samples. The XRD spectra of PbBr2 and CsPb2Br5 microwires are shown in Fig. 4(a). The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.4°, 18.6°, 23.7°, 29.1°, 37.7° and 44.4° (upper curve) correspond to the (110), (020), (111), (201), (040) and (202) planes of the PbBr2, respectively, which is consistent with the standard XRD patterns of PbBr2 (PDF#84-1181). There are four obvious diffraction peaks (lower curve), which are at 11.8°, 29.4°, 38.2° and 44.5° respectively, corresponding to the (002), (220), (224) and (402) planes of the CsPb2Br5 phase, and all peaks match the orthogonal phase (PDF#25-0211) of the CsPb2Br5. The Raman spectra of CsPb2Br5 microwires (Fig. 4(b)) were obtained using a 532 nm laser as the excitation source. Three characteristic peaks of CsPb2Br5 were observed in the range 50–300 cm−1, 67, 78 and 131 cm−1 representing the B2g mode, B1g mode and A1g mode, respectively.41,47 As can be seen from the absorption spectrum (Fig. 4(c)), the absorption peaks of CsPb2Br5 microwires are about 307 nm and 340 nm, which are similar to the previous results reported in CsPb2Br5.38,48 The absorption peak at 515 nm is suggested to be due to the CsPb2Br5 excitonic absorption35,43 or CsPbBr3 phase.49,50Fig. 4(d) shows the steady-state fluorescence PL spectra of CsPb2Br5 microwires. It has a highly symmetrical emission peak with a center of 528 nm and a full width at half maxima (FWHM) of 17 nm. The PL emission of CsPb2Br5 at 528 nm is supported in ref. 35. In contrast, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and PL test in bulk CsPb2Br5 single crystals suggested that intrinsic CsPb2Br5 has a wide and indirect band gap and should display PL inactivity.19,33 The absorption peak of 515 nm and PL emission might be due to the sub-bandgap defects or parasitic CsPbBr3 phase. Even though a thimbleful CsPbBr3 parasitic phase does exist in CsPb2Br5 microwires, due to the limitation of detection, the presence of the CsPbBr3 phase could not be confirmed in our XRD test. As a consequence, synchrotron radiation wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) was used to gain better insight into the fine structure and phases in the prepared material. As shown in Fig. 4(e) and (f), the diffraction peaks at 43.3° originated from the Cu substrate. The diffraction peaks at 11.6°, 23.7°, 30.3°, 39.7° and 48.5° correspond to the (002), (204), (221), (206) and (422) planes of CsPb2Br5. In addition, weak intensity peaks at 26.5°, 37.6° and 49.3° of the tetragonal CsPbBr3 structure (PDF#18-0364) are observed, revealing the CsPb2Br5 microwire contains a small amount of CsPbBr3, which suggests that the observed absorption peak of 515 nm and PL emission are likely caused by the residual CsPbBr3 on the surface of CsPb2Br5.39,40 The objection that the absorption peak and PL emission is not originated from the CsPbBr3 phase in CsPb2Br5 might be due to the CsPbBr3 being too little to be detected by conventional XRD or TEM.

In order to study the CsPb2Br5 phase evolution at high temperatures, a WAXS test was performed by in situ annealing treatments at different temperatures from 20 °C (293 K) to 350 °C (623 K) (Fig. 5). From Fig. S4 (ESI†) we can see that with the increase in temperature all peaks are shifted towards low angles due to thermal expansion of the lattice. This is consistent with the results of the in situ XRD on the biphasic CsPb2Br5/CsPbBr3 thin films at different temperatures between 313 and 583 K performed by Sebastián's team.51 In addition, they verified that, at 373 K, the (004) and (220) diffraction peaks of the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 transformed to the (002) and (200) peaks of the tetragonal phase, while the peaks of CsPb2Br5 remained unchanged.51 However, the results in Fig. 5 show that until the temperature increases to 350 °C (623 K), no phase structure transformation was observed for both CsPb2Br5 and CsPbBr3 in the as prepared microwires. The coexistence states and proportion of CsPb2Br5 and CsPbBr3 in the microwires should be very different from that in CsPb2Br5/CsPbBr3 thin films. Therefore, at high temperature, their phase transformation mechanism and properties will be different. In the as-prepared microwires, the high temperature induced transformation of the CsPbBr3 phase was inhibited, which also indicates that the microwires have better materials and devices stability at high temperatures. (Note that the intensity changes of the diffraction peaks in the WAXS pattern do not mean changes in the amount of phase content of CsPb2Br5 or CsPbBr3 in the microwires. Because the polyimide flexible substrates used in the test would be slightly deformed at higher temperature.) Due to equipment limitations, the WAXS test annealing temperature only reached 350 °C, we failed to verify the phase transition from CsPb2Br5 to CsPbBr3 and PbBr2 detected by Wang's team as they annealed the CsPb2Br5 cluster at over 400 °C.50 Therefore, we annealed the microwires at 400 °C in an N2 atmosphere and measured the samples using X-ray diffraction (Fig. S5, ESI†). It was found that after annealing at 400 °C, compared with in Fig. 4(a), the (002) and (200) crystal planes of CsPb2Br5 disappeared, and the (224) and (402) crystal planes of CsPb2Br5 still exist but the strength is reduced. The (100) (110) (002) and (200) crystal planes of CsPbBr3 and the (200) (220) and (130) crystal planes of PbBr2 appeared in the XRD of the annealed CsPb2Br5 microwires. The result shows that CsPb2Br5 microwires start to decompose at 400 °C, compared with the new phase that appears in Wang's CsPb2Br5 cluster at 220 °C, and it further shows that the as prepared CsPb2Br5 microwires have better material stability at high temperature.

In recent years, the dynamics of photoexcited carriers has become a focus of research due to their important role in perovskite devices. To investigate the fluorescence features and the recombination processes of charge carriers, spatial and temporal resolved measurements were used to study the diversity of fluorescence attenuation behavior in the CsPb2Br5 microwires. We selected a CsPb2Br5 microwire about 70 μm in length prepared at 40 °C for spatial and temporal resolved fluorescence measurements (Fig. 6(a)). Fig. 6(b) shows the fluorescence intensity of the microwire. The morphological characteristics of the observed fluorescence are in good agreement with the optical images, and the distribution of fluorescence intensity is obviously not uniform. We labeled three typical regions of CsPb2Br5 microwire as A, B and C, respectively, corresponding to the red in the center, green in the edge, and light blue positions in both ends of the microwire, respectively. It shows that the fluorescence intensity at positions B and C is weaker than that at the central position A. Two-dimensional time-resolved fluorescence images are shown in Fig. 6(c), exhibiting uneven distribution of fluorescence lifetime intensity in the microwire. It can be clearly seen that the fluorescence lifetime intensity in the middle area is greater than that in the edge sides and both ends. Fig. 6(d) shows the corresponding fluorescence attenuation curves of three different positions A, B and C extracted from the mapping of Fig. 6(c). We use the double exponential function fitting to obtain the time constant and its proportion, and calculate the fluorescence lifetime distribution according to the fluorescence decay curve. The calculated fluorescence lifetime and corresponding average weighted lifetime are listed in Table 1. The results in Table 1 show that the fluorescence lifetime decreases gradually from the middle region to the sides. Furthermore, all fluorescence attenuation curves consist of two components: the fast component process τ1 and the slow component process τ2. The weighted average life expectancy is defined by τave= A1τ1+ A2τ2, where τ1 is the fast decay time of PL emission, which can be attributed to the high density of surface traps generated by dangling bonds and uncoordinated atoms, and τ2 is the slow decay time of PL emission, which may be caused by the recombination of the conduction band and the band edge of the valence band.52,53A1 and A2 are constants corresponding to the fast and slow decay components, respectively, and they represent the amplitudes of the decay portion. The different ratios of long and short lifetimes in regions A, B, and C further explain the uneven distribution of fluorescence lifetimes in CsPb2Br5 microwires. The shorter lifetimes and higher ratio of short lifetimes suggest that the larger carrier decay may be due to the higher density of defect states on both sides and both ends of the CsPb2Br5 microwire. Region A has a longer fluorescence lifetime and a higher proportion of long-lived components, which are attributed to the higher crystal quality in the middle.

Fig. 6(e)–(h) show the fluorescence lifetime images of the microwires at 40 °C, and those annealed at 150 °C, 300 °C and 400 °C under a N2 atmosphere. It can be seen that the fluorescence emission distribution of CsPb2Br5 microwires changes after high temperature annealing, and the PL lifetimes of different emission regions in the microwire will have large difference.48 The decay curves of the red region (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 6(e)–(h)) in the CsPb2Br5 microwires at different annealing temperatures are shown in Fig. 6(i), and the fluorescence lifetime and corresponding average weighted lifetime are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The decay curves conform to a double exponential decay function for the microwires of different annealing temperatures. The average fluorescence lifetime decreased from 1.22 ns to 0.15 ns as the annealing temperature increased to 150 °C. This decrease of the fluorescence lifetime might be attributed to the increase in defect density in CsPb2Br5 after annealing, the photogenerated carriers would be more captured by the defects, resulting in a decrease in the quantum yield of external photoluminescence.51 As the annealing temperature increases to 400 °C, CsPb2Br5 would decompose to CsPbBr3 + PbBr2 (CsPb2Br5 → CsPbBr3 + PbBr2),54 and this has also been verified in our XRD of 400 °C annealed samples (Fig. S5, ESI†). The average fluorescence lifetime increases to 1.32 ns, which is due to the increased lifetime and contribution percentage of long-lived components. The long fluorescence lifetime and high fluorescence efficiency of radiative recombination of CsPbBr3 was suggested to contribute to this increased long lifetime weight.55,56
Photodetectors can be clarified into different types according to their work principles, such as photodiodes (PN photodiodes,57,58 PIN junction photodiodes,59,60 avalanche photodiodes61,62), and metal–semiconductor–metal photodetectors (MSM-PDs)63etc. Depending on the contact type, MSM-PDs can be divided into the ohmic-contact type (photoconductive type) and the Schottky-contact type.64–66 The working mechanism of the ohmic contact type MSM-PDs: in dark conditions, ohmic-contacts are formed between the semiconductor material and the metal electrodes in photoconductive type PDs. Under illumination, photogenerated carriers (electrons and holes) are produced due to the intrinsic or impurity absorption of photons in the semiconductor area (Fig. S6a, ESI†), then the conductivity of the semiconductor decreased.65 The photogenerated carriers drift in the drive of applied bias and are collected by the electrodes, thereby generating photocurrent in the output circuit. The main advantage of photoconductive type photodetectors is that the fabrication process is simple and the internal photoelectron gain is high.67,68
To characterize the optoelectronic properties of CsPb2Br5 microwires, an ohmic-contact type photodetector was prepared (Fig. S6b, ESI†). Fig. 7(a) shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the CsPb2Br5 microwire-based devices under illumination with different optical powers ranging from 1.14 to 4.22 mW mm−2. We can see from Fig. 7(a) that the photocurrent gradually increases with the increase in light intensity. The linear and symmetrical features of the I–V characteristic curve indicate good ohmic contact between the gold electrode and the CsPb2Br5 microwires. The inset in Fig. 7(a) is a magnification curve of dark and light currents. The dependence of the photocurrent of the PD on the optical power (Fig. 7(b)) can be described by a power law: I = αPβ,1,26 where I is the photocurrent, α is the proportionality constant, P is the intensity of the light, and β is the exponent. β represents the response to photocurrent related to the intensity of light, and its ideal value is 1, indicating the utilization of light. The microwire PD showed a I = 4.303p0.91 power dependence. Compared with previous literature,35 the β of 0.91 suggests the microwire's high utilization ability of light in the microwires.

(f) Stability measurement of the CsPb2Br5 microwires at room temperature in air under a 405 nm under laser with a light intensity of 4.73 mW mm−2 and a bias voltage of 5 V. 
In order to explore the stability of CsPb2Br5 microwires, the photocurrent response of the PD is performed in 5 V bias. The I–t curve is shown in Fig. 7(c). Under dark conditions, a low dark current of 3.4 nA was observed. When the laser (405 nm, light intensity of 4.23 mW mm−2) was opened, the current rapidly increased to the obvious saturated value of 2.71 μA, and the current on/off ratio was about 800. The I–t curve shows a stable periodic photocurrent response, which indicates that the detector has good cycling stability and reproducibility. Light response and recovery time are also the important parameters of photoelectric detectors. The response time and the recovery time is the time needed for the current to reach (1 − 1/e) and 1/e of the maximum photocurrent, respectively.69 As shown in Fig. 7(d), the CsPb2Br5 nanowire PD exhibits rise and fall times of about 90 ms and 43 ms, respectively, showing a comparable fast response time as compared with perovskite PDs with a MSM structure, as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Responsivity (R) and detection sensitivity (D*) are very important to the sensitivity of PD. They’re evaluated by R = Iph/PS and ,1,70 respectively, where Iph is the difference between light and dark currents, P is the irradiance of incident light, S is the effective area, Id is the dark current density, and e is the electron charge. Both R and D* decrease as the irradiance power increases. The highest values are 640.7 mA W−1 and 6.07 × 1010 Jones for R and D*, respectively. In addition, we studied the R and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PD at 400–800 nm wavelength, calculated using the following formula:  where h and c are Planck's constant and light speed, and λ is the light wavelength. The highest value EQE of the PD can be estimated to be 191%, with a bias voltage of 5 V and illumination λ of 405 nm (as shown in Fig. S7, ESI†). The photoresponse behavior measured at different bias voltages from 3 to 10 V irradiated with a 405 nm laser is shown in Fig. 7(e). The rapidly generated photocurrents at different voltages as well as the stable and repeatable on/off cycles, further indicate the device has an excellent optical switching performance. In order to display the optoelectronic performance change of the detector at different preservation times, the photocurrents of the as prepared PD after being stored for 10, 30, 60 and 90 days without any package are shown in Fig. 7(f). The PD still maintained 82% of the optoelectronic performance after 90 days of storage in an atmospheric environment, benefiting from the environmental (water and oxygen) stability of CsPb2Br5 microwires.
Conclusion
Self-assembled CsPb2Br5 microwires were successfully synthesized using a two-step method at room temperature. The effects of substrate temperature on the growth process and morphology evolution of the microwires were studied. The results show that the growth temperature is the key factor controlling the morphology of CsPb2Br5 microwires. CsPb2Br5 microwires prepared at low temperatures were few in number but several millimeters in length. The amount of nucleation in the microwires increased with increasing temperature. Through WAXS characterization of CsPb2Br5, it was found that CsPb2Br5 contained a small amount of parasitic phase CsPbBr3, which might be the cause of the green luminescence in CsPb2Br5. The result of WAXS shows that the CsPb2Br5 and CsPbBr3 parasitic phases are not transformed after annealing to 350 °C (623 K), indicating that the CsPb2Br5 microwires have good structural stability and device stability at high temperatures. The spatial and temporal resolved fluorescence measurements further revealed the distribution of defect states and carrier recombination processes in different regions of the microwires. The defect density is higher in the edge region than in the center region. With the increase of annealing temperature, the fluorescence lifetime first decreases, and then increases due to the increase of CsPbBr3 composition at high temperature. In addition, the CsPb2Br5 microwire PDs display an excellent light response and a large on/off ratio of about 800, with rise and fall times of 90 and 43 ms, respectively. The PD based on CsPb2Br5 microwires exhibits good stability and relatively fast response time, and exhibits development potential in the field of optoelectronic devices.
