    , Accepted 21st June 2023First published on 23rd June 2023AbstractExploration of novel photocatalytic systems with inner light sources and less energy consumption is desirable to extend the applications of photocatalytic oxidation. An intelligent route is to achieve energy cycling between a light source and photocatalytic oxidation. However, conventional photocatalytic systems cannot produce light emission, which restricts energy cycling. We found that the involvement of cataluminescence (CTL) greatly enhanced the efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation with a hetero-structured catalyst comprising Co(OH)2 and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 (ZIF-67), denoted as “Co(OH)2@ZIF-67”. Mechanistic investigations revealed that bandgap matching between CTL emission and absorption of the catalyst benefited energy cycling and facilitated charge carrier separation/transport, resulting in acceleration of the CTL reaction. The universality of this strategy was further verified with ZIF-8 and FeO(OH) catalysts. Our study has opened a new avenue for exploring effective photocatalytic systems through bandgap matching-induced energy cycling towards various applications in sensing, organic synthesis, pollutant degradation, and even water-splitting.
Introduction
Photocatalytic oxidation has attracted growing attention in water-splitting, organic synthesis, and pollutant degradation due to its easy operation, high efficiency, and minimal secondary pollution.1–4 It is one of the most effective ways to decompose volatile organic compounds (VOCs).5,6 To achieve effective photocatalytic oxidation, an external light source is generally required, which complicates the equipment and limits usage in small operating spaces.7–9 In addition, the costly features and high loss of incident light are in conflict with the shortage of electric power.10 In contrast, inner light source-based systems of small size can provide high efficiency of energy utilization and aid competent processes of photocatalytic oxidation.11 Therefore, it is possible to exploit sustainable photocatalytic systems with less consumption of energy by using an inner light source. To meet this concern, few photocatalytic systems using persistent luminescent materials as a self-luminous light source have been explored.12 Unfortunately, the duration of self-luminous photocatalysis is largely dependent on the storage capacity of persistent luminescent materials, which hinders long-lasting photocatalytic applications.13,14 Hence, it is appealing to design a simple and effective photocatalytic system with an appropriate inner light source.
Chemiluminescence (CL) is a luminescence technique that produces in situ emission by a chemical reaction. The free light source and low background endow CL with extensive applications in the design of sensitive detection and lighting systems.15,16 For example, sensitive and real-time perception of the endogenous hydroxyl radical (˙OH) has been reported based on a citrate-stabilized CdTe CL probe.17 With the sustained-release of reactants, long-lasting luminol-based CL lighting systems have been constructed.18,19 Thus, it is possible to construct simple and effective photocatalytic systems by using CL as the inner light source. However, interfacial photocatalytic oxidation has a high requirement of a clean interface to enable efficient charge separation.20,21 As a result, CL reactants cannot be attached onto the interface of photocatalysts directly. Kang and colleagues reported that the efficiency of energy transfer from the inner light source to the photocatalyst was strongly dependent on the distance between them.12 Hence, a long distance between a light source and the photocatalytic interface may weaken the reaction efficiency.22 In addition, most CL systems emit a flash-type emission, which hinders its use as a stable inner light source.23 A CL system with a glow-type emission can be used as the inner light for a photocatalytic reaction. For instance, by separating a 2,4,6-trichlorophenyloxalate-hydrogen peroxide system and acrylamide into diethylphthalate/water bilayers, a photocatalytic acrylamide polymerization reaction has been realized in the presence of a water-soluble photoinitiator.24 However, the photochemical reaction can occur only on the diethylphthalate/water interface. Moreover, the energy cycling between CL and photocatalysts is not considered.25,26 In theory, energy cycling from an appropriate CL/photocatalyst pair would further benefit the decrease in energy consumption. As a result, it is essential to develop a self-sustaining and highly effective photocatalytic system with an appropriate interfacial light source.
Cataluminescence (CTL) is a specific type of CL that generates emission during the catalytic oxidation of organic molecules on solid catalyst surfaces in an atmosphere containing oxygen.27,28 That is, the catalyst promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species, which oxidizes organic molecules and produces emission.29 Typically, the chemical reaction between the VOC molecules and adsorbed oxygen on the catalyst surface at a certain temperature (usually 200–500 °C) generates an excited intermediate, which produces a certain light emission when it returns to the ground state. Such a light emission is called CTL.30,31 CTL originates from the molecules involved in the reaction, so the intensity of the light emission could indicate the catalytic effect.32 In contrast, photocatalytic oxidation first requires the adsorption of light, which benefits the charge separation and yield of reactive oxygen species.33 In a way, CTL is a complementary process to photocatalytic oxidation. Thus, it has been speculated that CTL-assisted photocatalytic oxidation could afford new opportunities to yield self-sustaining and effective photocatalytic systems with enhanced photocatalytic performances. As a proof-of-concept, herein we constructed a CTL-coupled hetero-structured Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 photocatalyst system that revealed excellent efficiency (up to 97.8%) for the catalytic oxidation of acetone. The high photocatalytic efficiency was due to the matched bandgap energy from Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 and acetone CTL emission. Then, the CTL energy was adsorbed by the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 photocatalyst, which enabled the generation of electrons and holes and subsequently promoted the oxidation of acetone, achieving energy cycling between the CTL process and charge separation of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 (Scheme 1). The universality of this CTL-assisted photocatalytic oxidation strategy was verified by ZIF–acetone and FeO(OH)–acetone systems. The proposed CTL-assisted photocatalytic oxidation showed convenient operation, freedom from external light, and low energy consumption. It could be extended to exploit effective photocatalytic systems toward VOCs or other organic molecules by matching the energy between CTL emission and the bandgap of the photocatalyst.

Experimental
Chemicals and materials
All reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemicals (Shanghai, China). 2-Methylimidazole was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents (Beijing, China). Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile, acetone, butanone, formic acid, and acetaldehyde were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagents (Beijing, China). All solutions were freshly prepared with deionized water (Milli-Q™; Millipore, Barnstead, CA, USA).
Synthesis of catalysts
All catalysts were prepared according to procedures reported previously with slight modification.34 For the synthesis of ZIF-67, cobalt nitrate (0.64 mmol) was dispersed in 100 mL of water (solution A), and 2-methylimidazole (42.12 mmol) and CTAB (0.103 mmol) were dispersed in 100 mL of water (solution B). Solution A was poured into solution B while stirring. The resulting purple mixture was kept at 25 °C for 24 h. The preliminary product was washed by centrifugation (twice with deionized water and once with ethanol) and dried overnight at 60 °C under a vacuum.

In brief, cobalt nitrate (0.64 mmol) in 100 mL of water was solution A. 2-Methylimidazole (42.12 mmol) and CTAB (0.103 mmol) were dispersed in 100 mL of water as solution B. Solution A was poured into solution B while stirring. The resulting purple mixture was kept at 25 °C for 20 min. The initial product was sonicated for 5 min, then washed by centrifugation (twice with deionized water and once with ethanol) and dried overnight at 60 °C under a vacuum.
CTL measurement
CTL signals were detected by a biophysics chemiluminescence (BPCL) ultraweak chemiluminescence analyzer (Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China) and imported to a computer for data acquisition. In a typical assay, the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 catalyst was sintered onto a cylindrical ceramic heater, and catalytic oxidation occurred in a quartz tube set in air. As the reactants flowed through the reactor, the reaction was catalyzed at high temperature and the accompanying light was captured and amplified by a photomultiplier at the bottom, and then the light signal was converted into an electrical signal and output by the computer (Fig. S1†). An aliquot of VOC solution (20 μL) was injected into a gasification chamber, and then the air carrier gas conducted the VOC into a closed CTL reaction cell. The temperature of the CTL reaction was 150 °C, working voltage was −1000 V, and data-integration time was 1.0 s per spectrum.
Apparatus and characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL HT-7700 microscope (JEOL, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained with a JEOL S-4700 microscope (JEOL, Japan). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were collected on a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) at 40 kV and 30 mA. A 2θ angle of the diffractometer was stepped from 5° to 90° at a scan rate of 10° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were made using an ESCALAB-MK II 250 photo electron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra were obtained by a UV-3900H system (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were obtained with a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using a KBr disk. In situ FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out on a Nicolet 380 system (Thermo Scientific) containing a controlled-environment chamber equipped with CaF2 windows. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) experiments were carried out on a Trace 1300-ISQ GC/MS system (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a TR-5MS column (length = 30 m, inner diameter = 0.25 mm, film thickness = 0.25 μm). CTL intensity was detected using the BPCL luminescence analyzer (Institute of Biophysics). Volatile organic gases were delivered by an air pump (Beijing Zhongxing Huili, Beijing, China). A heater controller (Shenzhen Hengtai Electric Equipment Factory, Shenzhen, China) was used to provide heat for the ceramic rod. A F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) was used to obtain CTL spectra at a slit of 20 nm and a scanning rate of 2400 nm min−1. The excitation lamp was turned off. The photogenerated current curve of solar cells was measured by a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai, China) containing a solar simulator (CEL-AAAS50; Ceaulight, Beijing, China) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Specific surface areas were obtained using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method from N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K, which were measured using Autosorb-IQ-MP nitrogen adsorption apparatus (Quantachrome, Boynton Beach, FL, USA).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of photocatalysts
Photocatalysts (ZIF-67, Co(OH)2, and Co(OH)2@ZIF-67) were synthesized according to previous reports with slight modification and characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, and FT-IR spectroscopy.34 Cubic ZIF-67 nanoparticles of size ∼300 nm were obtained after 24 h of crystallisation with the addition of CTAB (Fig. 1a). However, ZIF-67 appeared to be dodecahedral without CTAB addition (Fig. S2†).35 A cubic morphology would benefit the generation of a hollow structure. A Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 hollow cube was formed with nucleation for 20 min (Fig. 1b), which was different from ZIF-67 due to the short duration of crystallization. As shown in Fig. 1c, Co(OH)2 nanosheets were formed after sonication treatment of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67. The nanosheets were small, a flocculent morphology at the micrometer scale was formed due to agglomeration. To further characterize Co(OH)2@ZIF-67, TEM was conducted. As displayed in Fig. 1d, a visible cavity within the cubic shell was observed. The formation of this inner cavity was attributed to the different growth rate of ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2. The concentration of 2-methylimidazole was much higher than that of Co2+. Hence, outside, Co2+ reacted rapidly with 2-methylimidazole and formed the ZIF-67 outer shell. However, inside, Co2+ formed Co(OH)2 preferentially in a basic environment. As a result, competitive coordination and the precipitation of Co2+ occurred.36,37 The high concentration of 2-methylimidazole led to the rapid kinetics of coordination and subsequently caused the generation of a cavity. The enlarged image in Fig. 1e clearly demonstrates the hollow cube-like structure of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67. The interface between ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2 is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1f. The inside cavity could increase the overall specific surface area, which benefits the adsorption of gas reactants and the diffusion of products during a catalytic reaction.38,39

Next, the crystalline form and structure of catalysts were characterized using XRD. As shown in Fig. 2a, strong diffraction peaks belonging to (011), (002), (112), (013), and (222) crystal planes were observed in ZIF-67, indicating good crystallinity. For Co(OH)2, diffraction peaks around 19°, 32°, 38°, and 51.5° appeared, which belonged to (001), (100), (101), and (102) crystal planes, respectively.40 The existence of these crystal planes suggested a lamellar structure of Co(OH)2. In Co(OH)2@ZIF-67, the crystallographic planes of ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2 were observed simultaneously, indicating that Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 comprised ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2. The N2 adsorption and desorption isothermal curves of the three catalysts displayed a type I-like isotherm (Fig. S3†).41 ZIF-67, Co(OH)2@ZIF-67, and Co(OH)2 showed a similar distribution of pore sizes, and the surface areas were 558, 461, and 411 m2 g−1, respectively.

To understand the elemental valence states, the N 1s and Co 2p XPS spectra of catalysts were obtained. Co(OH)2 does not have the N element, so the N 1s XPS spectrum of Co(OH)2 was not measured. As manifested in Fig. 2b, N 1s peaks around 398.9 eV and 400.5 eV were observed, which belonged to the N and N–O of pyridine.42 In Fig. 2c, the peak at 400.5 eV suggested that the O of intermediate LDH was bonded to the N in the outer shell of ZIF-67 (Fig. 1f). According to the Co 2p XPS spectra, different Co valence states were witnessed. As shown in Fig. 2d, the Co 2p XPS spectrum of ZIF-67 could be divided into two sets of peaks corresponding to satellite peaks (803.1 and 786.9 eV) and Co2+ (797.4 and 781.8 eV). Hence, only Co2+ was present in ZIF-67. However, the Co 2p XPS spectra of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2 shifted to a lower binding energy and showed Co2+ (797.4 and 781.8 eV) and Co3+ (796.2 and 780.7 eV) signals.43 The Co3+ signal was attributed to the oxidized Co2+ in two-dimensional Co(OH)2 nanosheets, which may form CoOOH.44
The functional groups and composition of photocatalysts were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. The characteristic vibration peaks below 1200 cm−1 belonging to the imidazole ring were observed in Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67. As shown in Fig. S4,† the bending vibrations of the imidazole ring around 1109, 1139, and 1173 cm−1 appeared in Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67.45 Accordingly, the N–H stretching band from the imidazole ring (1306 cm−1) and C–H stretching band from –CH3 (2960 cm−1) revealed the existence of 2-methylimidazole in Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67. Wide absorption peaks around 3500 cm−1 and 1380 cm−1 were observed in Co(OH)2, which were assigned to the surface –OH and C–N single stretching bonds with 2-methylimidazole, respectively. Taken together, hetero-structured Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 photocatalysts were prepared.
Co(OH)2@ZIF-67-mediated efficient photocatalytic oxidation of acetone
To test the photocatalytic-oxidation capability of catalysts, the CTL signals of various VOCs (acetone, ethanol, methanol, butanone, ethyl acetate, acetaldehyde, and formic acid) were recorded. The oxidation of these VOCs usually leads to emission of strong luminescence. In other words, the stronger the CTL signal, the higher the photocatalytic-oxidation efficiency of VOCs. As shown in Fig. 3, acetone showed the highest CTL signal in the presence of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67, whereas other VOCs only displayed ultraweak CTL intensity, indicating a high specificity towards photocatalytic oxidation of acetone. The CTL kinetics of acetone on all catalysts was fast (∼10 s). However, the CTL signals with different catalysts were different, and followed the order ZIF-67 < Co(OH)2 < Co(OH)2@ZIF-67. The CTL responses of other VOCs towards all three catalysts were also investigated. Interestingly, none of them caused a conspicuous CTL variation as acetone did, even with different catalysts. In this case, Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 showed high efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation towards acetone. To reveal the stability of the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 catalyst, repeat tests on the oxidation of acetone were undertaken (Fig. S5†). The CTL signal did not show a distinct variation during different repeat tests. In addition, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of 10 replicates was calculated to be 4.5%, which indicated the good reproducibility and high stability of the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 catalyst during photocatalytic oxidation. To further understand the oxidation efficiency towards acetone, GC-MS was applied to the measurement of the acetone concentration before and after the reaction. The reactants or products were collected in chromatographically pure acetonitrile and then used for analyses. As shown in Fig. S6,† the GC spectra of acetone after oxidation were collected. The retention peak at 1.93 min belongs to acetone, indicating that acetone was in excess during CTL. The conversion (oxidation) efficiency was calculated by the equation (1 − c1/c0) × 100%, where c0 and c1 are initial and final concentrations of acetone, respectively. As displayed in Table S1,† the oxidation efficiency of acetone decreased with increasing concentration from 500 to 2000 ppm. Compared with ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2, Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 had the highest conversion rate under an identical condition. Even at 1000 ppm of acetone, a conversion rate of 96.8% was achieved, suggesting the high oxidation efficiency of acetone using the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 catalyst. CTL-mediated acetone degradation needed a lower conversion temperature and less light energy than recent thermal/photovoltaic treatments (Table S2†). It was a low-energy and efficient degradation method. In the experiments on conversion testing, the carrier gas flow rate was set to be 10 mL min−1 to collect the product sufficiently, which allowed sufficient catalytic oxidization of acetone. As a result, the conversion of acetone on Co(OH)2 and Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 did not show a dramatic difference. However, this flow rate was much slower than that of CTL experiments (∼200 mL min−1), which could induce different trends. To eliminate this effect, a conversion test with a flow rate of 200 mL min−1 was conducted. As shown in Fig. S7,† the conversion with the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 catalyst was higher than that using the Co(OH)2 catalyst at the same flow rate, which was consistent with the CTL results. Therefore, Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 could be a promising photocatalyst towards effective catalytic oxidation of acetone.

The VOCs were acetone, ethanol, methanol, butanone, ethyl acetate, acetaldehyde, and formic acid. Conditions of CTL measurement: air flow rate = 200 mL min−1, reaction temperature = 150 °C, negative pressure = −1000 V, acquisition interval = 0.1 s. 
Mechanism of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67-enhanced photocatalytic oxidation of acetone
As indicated above, Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 afforded highly effective oxidation of acetone. To understand the mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic oxidation, some characterizations were undertaken. The theoretical basis of photocatalysis is that even weak natural light will trigger a photochemical reaction as long as the wavelength is less than the threshold λg (absorption edge) of the photocatalyst.46 It has been reported that the interfacial photocatalytic oxidation is usually accompanied with charge separation, which is important for the generation of reactive oxygen species and subsequent oxidation of organic molecules.6 CTL is an interfacial luminescence, so the return of the excited state to the ground state is accompanied by the generation of light occurring on the catalyst surface. Such a short distance can lead to energy transfer from CTL to Co(OH)2@ZIF-67. After that, charge separation can be promoted. To confirm this assumption, the matching energy of the bandgap was first investigated. To determine the energy gap, the absorption spectra of ZIF-67, Co(OH)2, and Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 were measured. As shown in Fig. 4a, ZIF-67 exhibited visible absorption around 250 and 550 nm, which were assigned to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) and metal-to-metal (MMCT) charge transfer, respectively. In addition, the peaks at 539, 564, and 585 nm could be attributed to the 4A2 (F) → 4T1 (P) tetrahedral coordination of cobalt-energy shift in ZIF-67.47 The strong absorption at 550 nm indicated the possibility of visible-light absorption. In contrast, Co(OH)2 had a weak absorption peak ∼500 nm and similar absorption at 220 nm. Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 showed distinct absorption around 250, 500, and 550 nm, indicating the preservation of ZIF-67. The absorbance increased in the order Co(OH)2 < ZIF-67 < Co(OH)2@ZIF-67, implying the synergistic effects of ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2. The absorption intensity of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 did not show a significant increase in comparison with ZIF-67. A possible reason was that the absorption of Co(OH)2 was weak and thus provided only a small contribution to absorption. On the other hand, the hollow structures of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 could cause multiple reflections and scattering of incident light, which also enhanced the absorbance.48 To calculate the width of the energy gap (band gap) of an individual catalyst, Tauc plots were created. The Tauc plot of all three catalysts was obtained by converting the corresponding UV–vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4b–d). The intersection between the extrapolated red dotted line and x-axis was the bandgap width. The bandgap was obtained using the equation (Ahv)1/2 = A(hv − Eg), where A, ν, h, and Eg represent the absorbance, frequency, Planck constant, and bandgap, respectively. The corresponding forbidden bandwidths for ZIF-67, Co(OH)2@ZIF-67, and Co(OH)2 were calculated to be 1.71, 2.45, and 2.86 eV, respectively.49

The CTL emission spectra of acetone on the surface of the three catalysts were first collected by fluorescence spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5, the CTL emission on the ZIF-67 surface was in the range 500–620 nm, with the maximum emission located at 550 nm. The CTL emission range shifted to 400–650 nm in the presence of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67, with a maximum wavelength ∼520 nm. With Co(OH)2, the CTL emission range was 450 to 750 nm, with a maximum wavelength ∼600 nm. Only small overlapping CTL emission and the absorption spectrum of ZIF-67 appeared, leading to weak CTL emission. With the addition of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67, the photocatalytic reaction was in a heterojunction. In this case, Co(OH)2 could absorb high-energy light at a shorter wavelength, whereas ZIF-67 absorbed lower-energy light near the red region. As a result, the wide photo-response region benefits the utilization of light and the production of more carriers to accelerate acetone oxidation, which realizes CTL-chemical energy cycling.50,51 However, Co(OH)2 alone led to weaker CTL in comparison with Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 because the red-shifted CTL emission on the Co(OH)2 surface diminished the overlapped area between CTL emission and the absorption spectrum of Co(OH)2. BET tests (Fig. S3†) ruled out specific surface area-mediated high catalytic efficiency, suggesting the importance of a hetero-structure. In this case, bandgap matching was important to the photocatalytic oxidation of acetone. To verify this suspicion, the CTL emission spectra of other VOCs were tested. As shown in Fig. S8,† CTL emission of all VOCs (butanone, methanol, formic acid, formaldehyde, methanol, and ethyl acetate) did not show a large spectral overlap towards the absorption spectrum of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67. On the other hand, the CTL intensity of these VOCs was too weak to excite the semiconductor for light-energy conversion. The change in VOC denoted the variation of the CTL light source. The mismatched light source and bandgap of the catalyst did not contribute to effective photocatalytic oxidation.

To verify that light emission (∼550 nm) was absorbed by the catalyst, we conducted the experiments with an external LED light whose central emission was located at ∼550 nm (Fig. 6). The power of the LED light was only 3 W, which is very weak in comparison with most sunlight simulators. Thus, this weak LED light could be used to simulate the CTL of acetone. The CTL signal of weakly responsive VOCs was tested on the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 surface without and with LED illumination. The CTL emission maxima of these VOCs were around 600–750 nm, which is far from the central emission of LED light. To eliminate the effect of the LED light, a bandpass filter (640 ± 5 nm) was set behind the PMT detector. As shown in Fig. 6c, the CTL signals of ethanol, butanone, and ethyl acetate were enhanced distinctly with the assistance of the LED light, suggesting that weak light (∼550 nm) irradiation benefited the catalytic reaction. In addition, the conversion rates of different VOCs were investigated without and with LED illumination. Interestingly, introduction of the LED light greatly improved the conversion rates of VOCs (Table S3†). These enhanced conversion rates suggested that the involvement of a bandgap-matched light source could facilitate the activity of the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 catalyst. However, none of them were comparable with that of acetone, which indicated that the CTL inner light source was more efficient. A possible reason is that the interfacial CTL was more easily absorbed by the catalyst, which exhibited higher efficiency of energy transfer. Taken together, CTL could be used as an inner light source to promote the photocatalytic reaction of VOCs.

(c) CTL response of ethanol, butanone, and ethyl acetate on the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 surface without and with light irradiation at 535 nm. 
To validate the importance of spectral overlap between CTL emission and the absorption spectrum of a catalyst, different Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 were prepared by regulating the crystallization time of 10 min, 1 h, and 2 h, denoted as Co(OH)2@ZIF-67-10 min, Co(OH)2@ZIF 67-1 h, and Co(OH)2@ZIF-67-2 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. S9,† the size of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 increased gradually with an increase in the crystallization time, and the hollow structure in all of them was maintained, indicating that the crystallization time did not destroy the hollow structure of the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 catalyst. As shown in Fig. S10,† the absorbance of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 increased gradually with increasing crystallization time in comparison with Co(OH)2. CTL emission was proportional to the crystallization time due to the increased spectral overlap. Besides, the quantified relationship between reaction efficiency and CTL intensity was obtained. The CTL intensity-enhanced catalytic reaction could be shown by the conversion results with different acetone concentrations. The CTL intensity with 500 ppm of acetone was lower than that of 1000 ppm of acetone (Fig. S11†). However, the conversion rates of acetone were close in these two conditions (Table S1†). Such a result suggests the oxidation rate of acetone in 1000 ppm condition is higher than that in 500 ppm. These results further revealed that CTL could collaborate with light-absorbing Co(OH)2@ZIF-67, which facilitated energy cycling and enhanced photocatalytic processes.
The reaction conditions in our photocatalytic system also included heating at 150 °C, so the catalytic effect of temperature and light on acetone were investigated briefly. With only heat, 500 ppm of acetone at 150 °C (on ceramic rod surface) caused only 6.9% conversion (Table S1†). With the introduction of catalysts (ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2), the CTL signal was enhanced greatly and the acetone conversion was also promoted. When the CTL emission energy matched the bandgap of the catalyst (Co(OH)2@ZIF-67), the conversion efficiency of acetone was enhanced dramatically at various concentrations. That is, heat provided a platform for initiating the generation of CTL. Then, CTL acted as internal light source, and supported the photocatalytic oxidation of acetone. Additional acetone oxidation provided continuous CTL, which contributed to the self-sustaining photocatalytic process.
As referred in previous works, the positions of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of hetero-structured catalysts are important to realize efficient photocatalytic oxidation.1 To further understand the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67-enhanced photocatalytic oxidation of acetone, the energy of VB (Evb) and CB (Ecb) of ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2 were calculated. On the basis of XPS spectra (Fig. 7a), the Evb of ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2 were 1.23 and 1.61 eV, respectively. The bandgap Eg could be calculated from Evb minus Ecb, so Ecb = Eg − Evb. As mentioned above, the Eg of ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2 were 1.74 and 2.86 eV, respectively. Then, the Ecb of ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2 were calculated to be −0.13 and −1.63 eV relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE),52 respectively. The relative positions of the VB and CB of ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2 are shown in Fig. 7b. To form a heterojunction, the energy-band positions of ZIF-67 and Co(OH)2 would move towards each other until the Fermi energy levels were equal.53,54 The bending of energy bands at a contact surface is usually accompanied with the formation of an internal electric field that accelerates the rapid movement of carriers, which greatly facilitates the hole- and electron-oxidation-dependent CTL reaction.55,56 Photogenerated charge carriers can react with oxygen and water and produce highly reactive oxygen species,32 including ˙OH and the superoxide anion (O2−). As a result, the oxidation of acetone was enhanced with hetero-structured Co(OH)2@ZIF-67.

It has been reported that fluorescence emission spectroscopy can be applied to study the capture, migration, and transfer of charge carriers, which is important to understand the fate of electron–hole pairs in semiconductor particles. The fluorescence behavior is caused by the complexation of free carriers, and the “radiative leap” implies recombination of an electron and hole.57 In this case, fluorescence spectroscopy could be used to detect the radiative leap. As shown in Fig. S12a,† individual catalysts showed weak fluorescence under light excitation at 380 nm. The fluorescence intensity of ZIF-67 was higher than that of Co(OH)2 and Co(OH)2@ZIF-67. Also, Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 showed the lowest emission. High fluorescence indicates the strongest recombination of an electron and hole, which causes the least CTL. In contrast, Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 with lowest fluorescence contributed to the highest CTL. Hence, a dramatic fluorescence burst of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 and effective utilization of electrons in the excited state occurred.58 As a result, the resistance to electron transfer between the heterojunction interfaces was reduced and facilitated the rapid transfer of electrons. To directly observe electron transport in semiconductor nanoparticles under light irradiation, the photogenerated current was investigated. As manifested in Fig. S12b,† the photocurrent values generated by Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 under xenon-lamp irradiation were about three-times higher than those from Co(OH)2, thereby indicating the positive effect of the hetero-structure on charge carrier separation/transport.
The reaction process was further probed by in situ IR spectroscopy (Fig. S13†). For ZIF-67-catalyzed CTL, there was no other peak except the gradually decreased characteristic peak of acetone (1740 cm−1), which suggested the consumption of reactants. With use of the Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 catalyst, CO and C–H stretching vibrations (2953, 298, 2901, and 2846 cm−1) gradually decreased but did not complete disappear, presumably due to the conversion of acetone to aldehyde. In addition, the C–O stretching vibrations at 1175 and 1135 cm−1 originating from –CH2OH/–COOH indicated the further oxidation of aldehydes. The CC and C–C stretching vibrations (1575 and 992 cm−1) suggested the formation of pheromones through the polymerization of acetone.59 Moreover, the characteristic peaks of CO2 (2437 and 2470 cm−1) were observed, indicating that the emitter should be excited CO2 ().60,61 Using Co(OH)2 as the catalyst, a significant product was not observed, which was consistent with weak CTL emission. To further confirm the oxidation products, GC-MS was conducted (Fig. S6†). Through molecular matching, the retention peak at 3.48 min belonged to O2, probably due to dissolved oxygen from the carrier gas. Retention peaks at 2.94, 9.81, and 9.99 min could be assigned to ethanol, formic acid, and propionic acid, respectively (Fig. S14†). Combining the results of GC-MS and in situ IR spectroscopy, the possible experimental procedures are summarized in Fig. S15.†62,63 Taken together, Co(OH)2@ZIF-67-enhanced photocatalytic oxidation could be attributed to energy matching between the bandgap of the catalyst and CTL emission, which induced energy cycling and promoted the oxidation of acetone (Scheme 1).
Universality of bandgap matching-enhanced photocatalytic oxidation
To evaluate the proposed bandgap matching-enhanced photocatalytic oxidation, the ZIF-8 catalyst with absorption of visible UV (∼300 nm) (Fig. 8a) and the hetero-structured FeO(OH) catalyst with strong absorption around 400–650 nm (Fig. 8c) were prepared according to the literature.64,65 The obtained ZIF-8 and FeO(OH) were loaded onto a ceramic heater for CTL measurement. As expected, ZIF-8 with UV absorption led to ultraweak CTL of acetone. The CTL signal was even lower than that with ZIF-67 (Fig. 8b). Although ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 have very similar structures, the absorption capability towards visible light of ZIF-8 was much lower than that for ZIF-67. Thus, the highly crystalline and dodecahedral ZIF-8 of diameter 200 nm (Fig. S16†) provided only weak CTL towards acetone due to a mismatched bandgap and less spectral overlap. In addition, FeO(OH) endowed strong CTL due to the distinct spectral overlap and stratifying bandgap matching (Fig. 8d). The CTL signal of acetone on the surface of FeO(OH) was higher than that of Co(OH)2@ZIF-67. The abundance of hydroxyl groups on the surface of FeO(OH) resulted in good hydrophilicity, which could lead to a homogeneous catalyst coating on the surface of ceramic rods.66 Thus, exposure of more active sites on the catalyst surface led to higher CTL signals. On the other hand, the surface of the rich hydroxyl group facilitated the adsorption of hydrophilic acetone molecules.67 With these possible factors, FeO(OH) induced higher CTL signals. Our results further verified the feasibility of enhancement of photocatalytic oxidation by CTL with appropriate bandgap matching.

Conclusions
CTL-involved photocatalytic oxidation with enhanced efficiency was explored using a hetero-structured Co(OH)2@ZIF-67 catalyst. Bandgap matching between CTL emission and the absorption spectrum of the catalyst was crucial to promote energy cycling and subsequent photocatalytic oxidation. The proposed strategy for bandgap matching-enhanced photocatalytic oxidation is verified by ZIF-8 and FeO(OH) involved photocatalytic oxidation of acetone. This work exhibits an effective photocatalytic oxidation system, but also provides a general tactic to construct a selective platform for the photocatalytic treatment of VOCs. Moreover, our work offers deep understanding of the relationship between light energy/photocatalyst bandgap and photocatalytic activities. This strategy is expected to be applied for the exploration of simple photocatalytic systems for rapid and effective organic synthesis, pollutant degradation, and even water-splitting.
