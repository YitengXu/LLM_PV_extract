Based on this strategy, PCEs of CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs were improved from 6.71% to 10.62% (i.e., 58% enhancement). For the one-step route, TBP as an additive resulted in orientational and better crystallinity, by which the PCEs of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based planar PSCs increased from 11.11% to 15.01%, showing a remarkable enhancement as high as 35%. Using TBP as one multifunctional additive, it is thought that our strategy in this work offers a new idea for the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs.
1. Introduction
Over the past three years, organometal halide perovskites have been considered as extraordinary photovoltaic materials with desirable properties, such as moderate direct band-gap, high carrier mobility, ambipolar behaviour in charge transport, and facile solution processability.1,2 For thin-film solar cells, organometal halide perovskites are not only good photoabsorbers, but also superior charge transport media (for both electrons and holes), which facilitate high photoelectric conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and provide more flexibility in cell architecture design.3,4 High PCEs from 9.7% in 2012 to 20.1% in 2015 have been achieved successively by perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with either mesoporous or planar architectures.1,5 To obtain highly efficient PSCs, effective controls on perovskite crystallinity, homogeneity, and surface morphology are crucial. High-quality perovskite can be prepared by vapor-assisted methods.6 However, solution routes are more advantageous and competitive for large-scale production. In recent years, various efforts have been exerted to upgrade solution routes and photovoltaic performances of the corresponding PSCs have been improved largely.5,7,8
Initially, we prepared perovskite by depositing a mixture of two precursors (i.e., PbI2 and CH3NH3I) in a single step onto mesoporous TiO2 films.1 However, the uncontrolled precipitation process in this method usually results in large morphological variations, wide distribution in photovoltaic performance, and poor reproducibility. In 2013, disadvantages of the one-step method were remedied by introducing a sequential deposition method that was conducted by initially depositing mesoporous TiO2 with PbI2; subsequently, these materials were dipped into CH3NH3I solution.9 For solution routes, at the early stage, this method largely progressed from the “one-step” to “two-step”, by which high PCEs of up to 15% were achieved in 2013. Nevertheless, the two-step route is unsuitable for the fabrication of all kinds of PSCs, such as planar ones. Successful use of the “two-step” route mainly depends on the mesoporous scaffolds that can offer a large surface area to enable sufficient contact of PbI2 with CH3NH3I for perovskite formation. However, for planar PSC fabrication, the contact between the two precursors is usually very limited. Thus, the PbI2 layer, especially the part that is distant from the contact interface, cannot be fully converted into perovskite.
Recent studies have revealed that the use of specific additives and solvents is extremely effective for improving perovskite crystallization and PSC performance, especially for planar PSCs fabricated via the one-step or two-step routes. Various specific processing methods were developed based on different additives, and some mechanisms were proposed accordingly. A modified two-step method is conducted by dissolving PbI2 with dimethylsulfoxide instead of N,N-dimethylmethanamide (DMF).10 By employing this strategy, problems of incomplete conversion and uncontrolled particle sizes of perovskites were largely alleviated in the absence of mesoporous scaffolds, thereby increasing film reproducibility and planar PSC. In contrast, for planar PSC fabrication by one-step routes, the additives are significant in facilitating homogeneous nucleation or crystallization kinetics modulation. Currently, highly uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films, such as CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, and HC(NH2)2PbI3, have been prepared with the use of some additives, such as 1,8-diiodooctane, N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone, HI, and NH4Cl.11–14
4-tert-Butylpyridine (TBP) is a commonly used additive in electrolytes of dye-sensitized solar cells15 and in hole transport materials of PSCs.16 In the present report, we demonstrate the flexible and facile use of TBP to improve the crystallinity of perovskite in two-step or one-step routes. For the two-step route, addition of TBP into DMF when dissolving PbI2 for spin-coating resulted in a porous layer that was constructed by randomly packing PbI2 nanocrystals. This approach subsequently offered a widely enlarged contact area to facilitate interfacial reaction with CH3NH3I and greatly improved CH3NH3PbI3 crystallization, as shown in Scheme 1. Based on this strategy, the PCEs of the CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs were improved from 6.71% to 10.62% (i.e., 58% enhancement). For the one-step route, TBP as an additive resulted in orientational and better crystallization, by which the PCEs of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based planar PSCs increased from 11.11% to 15.01%, showing a remarkable enhancement as high as 35%.

2. Experimental section
PSC fabrication
Typically, FTO glass (15 Ω sq−1) was patterned by etching with Zn powder (6–9 µm, Alfa Aesar, 97.5%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 4 M, Sigma-Aldrich), then followed by consecutive cleanings with 2% hellmanex solution (Sigma-Aldrich, being diluted into working concentration as received), deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, and finished through drying samples in clean air. A compact TiO2 blocking layer (C-TiO2) was fabricated by spin coating an organic sol on the clean substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by sintering in a furnace at 450 °C in air for 2 h. The organic sol for the TiO2 compact layer was prepared according to the previous literature.17 CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs were fabricated through the route of two-step sequential deposition. To prepare the PbI2 film for the normal sample, in the first step 462 mg PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%) was dissolved into 1 ml anhydrous dimethyl formamide (DMF, J&K, anhydrous, 99.8%) and then were spin-coated on C-TiO2/FTO substrates at 5000 rpm for 10 s, finally drying at 70 °C for 30 min in a glove box. Preparation of the porous PbI2 film for sample 2-TBP-guided-TS was conducted by adding 80 µl 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, J&K, 96%) into the above-mentioned PbI2 solution (as that for sample 1-normal-TS) and then treated with the same procedures mentioned above. After cooling to room temperature, the PbI2 films were dipped into a solution containing 10 mg CH3NH3I in 1 ml 2-propanol (IPA, J&K, anhydrous, 99.5%) for 2 min, then rinsed with 2-propanol and dried at 70 °C for 30 min to form the crystallized CH3NH3PbI3. The above-mentioned two CH3NH3PbI3 samples are named as 1-normal-TS and 2-TBP-guided-TS, respectively, where TS refers to the “two-step” method, and 1 or 2 is the sample number. For the fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx normal films, one precursor solution was firstly prepared by adding 102.2 mg PbCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%) and 174.9 mg CH3NH3I (with a molar ratio of 1:3) into 500 µl anhydrous DMF and then heated at 70 °C for 1 h. This sample is named as 3-normal-OS, where “OS” represents the one-step method. For sample 4-TBP-guided-OS, 40 µl TBP was added into the above precursor solution additionally. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films were fabricated by spin-coating of the precursor solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The coated films were then placed on a hot plate set at 90 °C for 1 h and 100 °C for 25 min. The HTM (hole transport material) prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD (Borun Company, China, 98%), 28.8 µl TBP, and 20 µl solution of 300 mg ml−1 Co(III) TFSI salt (Co[PyPz]3[TFSI]3, MaterWin Technology, >99%) in acetonitrile, and 17.5 µl solution of 520 mg ml−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95%) in acetonitrile (J&K, 99.8%) into 1 ml chlorobenzene (Alfa Aesar, 99.5%) was deposited by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the fabrication of PSCs was completed after the deposition of 100 nm Ag (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) by means of thermal evaporation on top of the HTM layer. The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.12 cm2.
Characterization
The microscopic morphology and crystallinity were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta 450) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2400, Rigaku), respectively. The UV-Vis absorbance spectra of perovskite were measured with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (HP 8453, Hewlett Packard, USA) by deducting the background of the compact TiO2 layer. Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation (PEC-L15, Peccell, Yokohama, Japan) with a Keithley digital source meter (Keithley 2601, USA). Before each J–V measurement, the light intensity was calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar cell. IPCE measurements were performed using monochromatic light from a system made of a xenon lamp, a monochromator, and appropriate filters.
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a and b, a relatively compact PbI2 film approximately 100 nm in thickness was obtained through the normal route. After the reaction with CH3NH3I solution, larger and closely packed CH3NH3PbI3 crystals were formed in sample 1-normal-TS with sizes ranging from 200 nm to 500 nm, as shown in Fig. 1c and d. For TBP-guiding, we obtained a free-standing and porous PbI2 film composed of randomly packed nanoparticles, as illustrated in Fig. 1e and f. The porous PbI2 film is more advantageous compared to that of the compact one because a greatly enlarged surface area is available for the subsequent reaction with CH3NH3I solution, which is necessary for the full conversion of PbI2 into CH3NH3PbI3.

Although the mechanism by which TBP guided the formation of PbI2 nanoparticles in the present work is unclear, we believe that the “guiding” effect of TBP is highly relevant to the coordination effect between Pb2+ and TBP. Compared to the oxygen atom on DMF, the nitrogen atom on TBP (pyridine nitrogen) as the electron-donating unit is more inclined to coordinate with Pb2+. We conjecture that such greater coordination can eventually tune PbI2 crystallization into nanosized particles. In addition, TBP can also act as a dispersing agent (similar to some surfactants) that is capable of hindering the formation of large-sized bulks or aggregates. Based on the porous PbI2, the morphology of the resultant CH3NH3PbI3 film for sample 2-TBP-guided-TS is very different from that of 1-normal-TS as this material is also porous. In addition, this material has numerous large hollow pores with diameters exceeding 100 nm. The CH3NH3PbI3 crystals were also found to interconnect well around the pores. This condition is an important prerequisite for efficient carrier transport. To the best of our knowledge, the present study proposed a tuning method or a morphology that has never been reported.
The crystallinities of PbI2 films prepared using the normal and TBP-guided, two-step routes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 2a. Furthermore, to probe the evolution of crystallinity of PbI2 before and after heating, one fresh film (drying in air, without baking) and one baked at 70 °C for 30 min were measured. Detailed assignments of the diffraction peaks for each curve in Fig. 2a are demonstrated in Fig. S1.† For the PbI2 sample prepared without TBP guiding, all diffraction peaks in either the fresh film or the one baked at 70 °C for 30 min correspond well to PbI2, suggesting no formation of a crystallized PbI2–DMF complex. On the other hand, PbI2 crystallization in the case of using only DMF as the solution is highly oriented. This result is consistent with that reported previously.10 In contrast, based on the strong and strange diffraction peaks (marked with “#”) observed in the fresh film with TBP guiding, it is evident that the PbI2–TBP complex has been formed. Even after baking at 70 °C for 30 min, peaks (at 2θ = 22.8° and 28.1°) that belong to the PbI2–TBP complex also exist. The XRD results indicate that TBP and PbI2 have strong interaction, under which an intermediate (one complex) can be formed in the preparation of the PbI2 film. In light transmittance measurement from 500 nm to 800 nm, the porous PbI2 film allows the transmission of above 80% incident light, as illustrated in Fig. 2b. In contrast, only a small fraction of incident light can go through the compact PbI2 film. This characterization actually reflects the nature of these two films, namely, compact and porous. Fig. 2c shows XRD patterns of the resultant CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared according to the two different two-step routes. In the 1-normal-TS sample, a substantial portion of PbI2 was apparently not converted into CH3NH3PbI3 because the characteristic peak intensity for the PbI2 (001) plane is still very strong. In contrast, in the 2-TBP-guided TS sample, the diffraction peak for PbI2 is relatively very weak, as clearly illustrated by the comparison in the inset of Fig. 2c. This finding also suggests that our TBP-guided route is very facile and effective. For the normal two-step route, such problems may be resolved through reaction time alteration. However, extending the dipping time in CH3NH3I solution is not feasible because this process will result in the formation of extremely large crystals (several microns), which hinder electron transport through the perovskite film and deteriorate charge recombination.10 As shown in Fig. 2d, the 2-TBP-guided TS sample shows relatively high absorbance in the whole visible and some near-infrared light regions because of good crystallinity. By comparison, the PSC based on 2-TBP-guided TS is darker than the one based on 1-normal-TS, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2d. By high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), we confirmed that TBP has been fully removed after the formation of the TBP-guided perovskite film (see Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI†).

Fig. 3a illustrates the J–V curves of the champion devices based on the PSCs fabricated via the two different two-step routes; the J–V curves were measured under AM 1.5 and 100 mW cm−2 simulated light. Detailed photovoltaic parameters including that of the champion devices and the mean values of 35 devices for each group are summarized in Table 1. For 1-normal-TS-based PSCs, the mean PCE is extremely low, which is only 2.55% (Table 1). A low short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) are specifically responsible for the unsatisfactory results. Previous studies reported that under some conditions, residual PbI2 in perovskite was advantageous to PSC performance. This outcome was caused by the finding that a proper amount (usually very small) of PbI2 is favorable in the suppression charge-recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface or grain boundaries of perovskite crystals. Meanwhile, in the 1-normal-TS sample, the amount of residual PbI2 was relatively large (as confirmed by XRD results mentioned above); therefore, transport and collection of photo-generated electrons would be affected seriously. Consequently, we can obtain neither large Jsc nor FF because the residual PbI2 will directly result in the increase in series resistance (Rs) and deterioration in charge-recombination. For 1-normal-TS-based PSCs, another serious problem is the poor reproducibility. Table 1 also shows that the Jsc value shows an extremely large distribution, which further confirms the poor controllability when using the normal two-step route. As demonstrated in Fig. 3a, the champion device for 1-normal-TS-based PSCs exhibits a PCE of only 6.71%, whereas the one based on the 2-TBP-guided-TS route provides a relatively higher PCE of 10.62%, which was greatly enhanced by 58%. All photovoltaic parameters have been found to improve for 2-TBP-guided-TS-based PSCs, wherein Jsc and FF contributed most to the final PCE. Apparently, the enhancement in photovoltaic performance was derived from the improved CH3NH3PbI3 crystallinity. In PSCs, the hysteresis phenomenon is very common, which has generally been attributed to the migration of ions within the perovskite film or to the transient ferroelectric polarization.18 Improving the crystallinity of the perovskite films has proved effective in terms of eliminating the hysteresis phenomenon.19 Although hysteresis still exists in 2-TBP-guided-TS-based PSCs, it has been alleviated a lot when compared to the one prepared by the normal route. Obviously, the amelioration in hysteresis was achieved as a result of the improved crystallinity of perovskite by TBP-guiding. Spectra of the monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) are shown in Fig. 3b. From 300 nm to nearly 800 nm, the 2-TBP-guided-TS-based device was more efficient than the 1-normal-TS-based device and exceeds 80% in the region from 355 nm to 560 nm. Moreover, based on this modified two-step route, the reproducibility has also improved greatly, as shown in Fig. 3c. In 2013, Snaith proposed three probable future directions for PSC technology, including the “porous perovskite p–n heterojunction” architecture, which is similar to that of the bulk heterojunction organic solar cells.17 Compared to the planar p–i–n cell architecture, the “porous p–n heterojunction” architecture may benefit from the enlarged interfacial contact between the perovskite and the charge-selective material, which is favorable to the extraction of photogenerated carriers. However, no report has still been published regarding such PSCs. Therefore, our research study may provide one important idea for the fabrication of “porous perovskite p–n heterojunction” PSCs.

For one-step routes, additives are very effective in promoting homogeneous crystallization of high-quality perovskite films for planar p–i–n junction PSCs. In the present work, the above-mentioned results motivated us to use TBP in the one-step route. Regardless of the chemical components, PbCl2 is used as the precursor in the preparation of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.20–22 We also introduced TBP into the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx synthesis via the one-step route. Details of the synthesis can be found in the Experimental section. The 3-normal-OS samples were prepared by the normal one-step route. This CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film was condensed using numerous pinholes, as illustrated in Fig. 4a and b. In addition, we can hardly find any isolated and distinguishable crystals as observed in CH3NH3PbI3 samples because of the fused grain boundaries. Similar to other additives, initially TBP was expected to be able to promote homogeneous nucleation and result in high-quality CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films. However, the 4-TBP-guided-OS sample we obtained using this strategy was not a pinhole-free film, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. However, at least two different crystallization forms can be found in Fig. 4c. Similar to sample 3-normal-OS, the first form exhibits a smooth surface and large scale. Meanwhile, the second crystallization form is composed of large quasi-cuboid-like crystals that are formed from the first crystallization, which are approximately hundreds and tens of nanometers in length and width, respectively. We infer that the formation of these crystals is due to the preferred orientation of crystals caused by TBP. Finally, it is confirmed that TBP has been fully removed after the formation of TBP-guided CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films (see Fig. S4†). The XRD patterns in Fig. 5a indicate that, compared to sample 3-normal-OS, the crystallization of sample 4-TBP-guided-OS shows preferred orientation along the (110) direction as evident increases for diffraction intensities of the (110) and (220) planes are observed when compared to the (310) or (211) planes. Usually, the difference in the crystallinity of perovskite films may lead to the change in properties. For example, the two samples show different UV-Vis absorbances. Fig. 5b shows that the TBP-guided perovskite film prevails the normal sample in the whole range from 400 nm to 800 nm, which possibly has been caused by better crystallinity when compared to the normal sample (3-normal-OS).

A total of 35 cells were examined for each sample. The average and highest performances are summarized in Table 2. 4-TBP-guided-OS-based PSCs exhibit much higher photovoltaic performance than the 3-normal-OS-based PSCs. 3-Normal-OS-based PSCs show an average PCE of 9.86%, whereas all parameters including Jsc, Voc and FF of 4-TBP-guided-OS-based PSCs enhance obviously, and finally result in a higher PCE of 12.64%. Fig. 5d illustrates the champion cells for each CH3NH3PbI3−xClx sample. The Voc of the 4-TBP-guided-OS-based cell is 1.04 V, which is evidently higher than that of 0.82 V for the 3-normal-OS-based cell. Along with the notable enhancement in FF (0.69), a high PCE of 15.01% was obtained for a planar CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based PSC. Due to the better crystallinity, the hysteresis phenomenon in the 4-TBP-guided-OS-based cell is less pronounced than that observed in the 3-normal-OS-based one. Furthermore, IPCE spectra shown in Fig. 5d indicate that, in a very broad range from 300 nm to 750 nm, the two CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based PSCs demonstrate high external quantum efficiency. In particular, the IPCE of the 4-TBP-guided-OS-based PSC exceeds 80% from 350 nm to 700 nm. In addition to the higher PCE, PSCs fabricated with the two CH3NH3PbI3−xClx samples also show better reproducibility than the CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs, as shown in Fig. 5e. Tuning of the crystallinity in the current study varies from that in previous studies that focused on obtaining larger crystals or pinhole-free films. Our findings suggest that using functional additives such as TBP could also result in better crystallinity. We provide a novel strategy for future studies. We believe that further enhancement of the photovoltaic performance may still be achieved by eliminating the pinholes.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a novel strategy for tuning perovskite crystallization in PSCs by a flexible and facile method involving the use of TBP in one-step and two-step routes. For two-step routes, porous PbI2 could be constructed, which then offered an extremely enlarged contact area to facilitate interfacial reaction with CH3NH3I and greatly improved CH3NH3PbI3 crystallization. Based on this strategy, the highest PCEs of the CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs were improved from 6.71% to 10.62% (i.e., 58% enhancement). Furthermore, TBP was also used effectively as an additive for a one-step route in fabricating CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based planar PSCs. The use of TBP resulted in orientational and better crystallinity. This feature plays a positive role in increasing the photovoltage of materials. Finally, the PCE of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based PSCs exhibited a remarkable enhancement as high as 35% (i.e., from 11.11% to 15.01%).
