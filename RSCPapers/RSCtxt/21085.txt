    , Accepted 26th July 2020First published on 27th July 2020AbstractDefect engineering is increasingly recognized as a viable strategy for boosting the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using metal oxide-based photoelectrodes. However, previously developed methods for generating point defects associated with oxygen vacancies are rather time-consuming. Herein, high density oxygen deficient α-Fe2O3 with the dominant (110) crystal plane is developed in a very short timescale of 10 minutes by employing aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition and pure nitrogen as a gas carrier. The oxygen-defective film exhibits almost 8 times higher photocurrent density compared to a hematite photoanode with a low concentration of oxygen vacancies which is prepared in purified air. The existence of oxygen vacancies improves light absorption ability, accelerates charge transport in the bulk of films, and promotes charge separation at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface. DFT simulations verify that oxygen-defective hematite has a narrow bandgap, electron–hole trapped centre, and strong adsorption energy of water molecules compared to pristine hematite. This strategy might bring PEC technology another step further towards large-scale fabrication for future commercialization.
Introduction
Solar energy is expected to be the primary source for driving future growth as it is eco-friendly, safe, abundant, and unlimited. The intermittent nature of solar energy makes energy storage essential for providing continuous energy supply to the electricity grid.1 One of the most excellent ideas for storing solar energy is to use excess energy from sunlight and split water into its constituents such as hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen acts as an energy storage medium, where it could be converted to electricity at times of supply shortage via a green route with the only by-product being water.2,3 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting with the aid of a semiconductor is one of the promising technologies in producing high-purity hydrogen. To date, numerous materials such as TiO2, 4 SnO2, 5,6 BiVO4,7,8 and g-C3N49,10 have been explored as photoanodes for PEC water splitting.
Another promising material that exhibits positive potential for generating hydrogen by means of the PEC process is the alpha phase of iron oxide (α-Fe2O3) or the so-called hematite. Among other known phases of iron oxide such as beta (β) and gamma (γ) phases, crystalline iron oxide typically appears in the form of α-Fe2O3. The reason behind this is it's thermodynamic stability under ambient conditions.11,12 In addition, hematite possesses non-toxic properties, widespread availability, low cost, and suitable bandgap energy (2.0–2.2 eV), rendering it suitable for photoanodes in large-scale PEC systems.12–14 Theoretically, hematite is capable of achieving solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency up to 16.8% under 1 Sun irradiation (100 mW cm−2, 1.5 G illumination) at 1.23 VRHE.15,16 The theoretical value exceeds the STH benchmark efficiency for practical applications, which is 10%.3,12 However, the performance of PEC water splitting based on the state-of-the-art hematite photoanode is still far below the target. This is attributed to the challenging task of balancing the extremely short hole diffusion length (about 2–4 nm) and the long absorption depth of photons of hematite, to obtain efficient charge extraction and high-light absorption.17,18
Lots of efforts have been devoted to enhance the PEC performance of the hematite photoanode including the modification of nanostructures,19,20 introduction of dopant,21,22 coupling with other semiconductors to form composites23 or heterojunction devices24 and creation of point defects associated with oxygen vacancies.25,26 From the viewpoint of oxygen vacancies, several research groups have observed considerable improvement in the PEC performance of hematite thin films, since oxygen vacancies can serve as electron donors to ameliorate bulk conductivity and facilitate charge separation.27 Besides, oxygen vacancies would also modify the surface component which is favorable for water adsorption and subsequently enhance surface catalytic activity.16,28 Nevertheless, the processing techniques developed to introduce oxygen defects in hematite thin films currently are time-consuming and irrelevant for large-scale production. This is due to the fact that most reports employed additional treatment towards the pre-fabricated hematite film to generate defect sites. For instance, Zhao et al.27 reported a 20 min method for the preparation of a compact hematite film, using a metal–organic decomposition method, annealed under a N2 flow for 2 hours to form an oxygen-deficient sample. Wang et al.25 applied a double-step thermal oxidation/reduction process on iron foils where the foils were initially annealed in air followed by annealing in an Ar atmosphere. The whole fabrication process needed more than 3 hours to produce hematite nanorods with oxygen vacancies. Another approach of generating oxygen vacancies in hematite includes the plasma treatment of pre-sintered hematite nanoflakes, which needs at least 25 min.16
To overcome the extensive time consumption of the defective hematite film fabrication, additional processing protocols should be eliminated. Therefore, a technique to simultaneously introduce oxygen vacancies during the fabrication process of hematite layers must be developed. For this purpose, one of the practical strategies is to adopt the aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method. AACVD is basically a variant of the well-established chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique for the deposition of thin films. However, in the case of the AACVD process, an external atomic transducer can be used to vaporize the liquid solution, containing precursors which negates the reliance on the volatility of precursors, widens the choice of precursors, and minimizes the power consumption.5,29 Moreover, AACVD enables facile control of the morphological and structural properties of a thin film by manipulating the deposition parameters such as deposition time, precursor concentration, and the type of carrier gas which, in turn, affects their electrical and optical properties.5 Numerous photoelectrodes with impressive performance including TiO2,30 Fe2O3,31 BiVO432 and NiO33 have been developed using this technique which proves its excellent potential to be used in commercial applications.
Previously, we have successfully demonstrated the AACVD process with purified air as a gas carrier, applicable for eliminating oxygen vacancies in a SnO2 thin film, which is advantageous for perovskite solar cell devices but detrimental towards PEC water splitting.34 In this work, oxygen vacancies are intentionally generated in the Fe2O3 film by introducing a nitrogen environment in the fabrication process of the photoanode via the AACVD process, to boost the overall PEC performance. The photocurrent density of this sample has been found to be eightfold that of purified air flow, which contains less oxygen defects. Such a phenomenon was primarily attributed to the magnificent optical and electrical properties, which are elaborated in detail in this study. The thickness of the films was also tuned by regulating the deposition period to understand the superior ability of oxygen vacancies to enhance the PEC performance of Fe2O3. It is found that the duration of optimum device fabrication is only 10 min, which is the fastest ever-reported fabrication of a defective hematite photoanode. Furthermore, this signifies the great potential of this approach for further development. Finally, periodic density functional theory (DFT) simulations were carried out to countercheck the experimental data. We have constructed different surfaces of hematite; however, the 110 surface matches our experimental thin film, and is more stable; so, the calculations are restricted to this phase. It is found that defective hematite has high adsorption energy toward water molecules, electron–hole trapping centers in the Fermi level, and narrow bandgaps compared to pristine. In summary, an excellent correlation between the theory and experiments is found, which validates and confirms the main idea of this work.
Experimental
Materials
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Pilkington, sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1) was employed as a substrate. Iron chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 97%) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Absolute ethanol and acetone were obtained from VWR International Limited and R&M Chemicals, respectively. Deionized (DI) water purified at 18 MΩ was acquired from the Thermo Scientific Barnstead Smart2Pure water purification system.
Fabrication of the Fe2O3 thin film
A 0.1 M precursor solution was made by dissolving FeCl3·6H2O in absolute ethanol and stirred vigorously for 30 min at room temperature. The solution was left overnight before use. FTO substrates (2 cm × 1 cm) were cleaned ultrasonically with ethanol, acetone, and DI water for 10 min sequentially, followed by drying under a nitrogen flow. Deposition of the Fe2O3 film was conducted using a homemade AACVD system, as reported in our previous study.20 In brief, approximately 20 mL of the precursor was added to the precursor container. A commercial humidifier was utilized to atomize the precursor at full power to create saturated vapor in the container. The vapor of the precursor was transported to another container (filtration chamber), using purified air at a rate of 280 cm3 min−1 and simultaneously, additional purified air at a rate of 1530 cm3 min−1 was supplied into the same container to reduce the concentration of the vapor. Afterwards, the gas mixture was directed to a hot reaction chamber containing a pre-cleaned substrate placed on a 450 °C hot plate. The deposition was performed for 10 minutes. Finally, a similar process has been employed for pure nitrogen gas supply.
Characterization studies
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, D8 Advance, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 154.18 pm, 2θ = 20–80°) to analyse the crystal structure of the Fe2O3 thin film. The thickness of the film was determined with a profilometer (Dektak XT, Bruker). Nanosurf Easyscan2 atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to study the roughness of the samples. The morphology of the films was analyzed using a ZEISS Merlin field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken using Thermo Fisher, Talos 120C. The elemental composition and types of chemical bonds were investigated using Auger electron spectroscopy with an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), Axis Ultra Kratos/Shimadzu. A Lambda 35 PerkinElmer UV visible spectrophotometer was utilized for determining the optical properties. The performance of the photoanode with an active area of 1.0 cm2 was determined using chronoamperometry, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For this purpose, a Metrohm Autolab electrochemical workstation under simulated 1 sun illumination and dark conditions including a three electrode configuration was employed. The prepared samples were used as the working electrode while Pt was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The electrodes were immersed in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. During the LSV measurement, the voltage was swept from 0 V to 1.7 VAg/AgCl at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The following Nernst equation was applied to convert the experimentally measured potentials versus Ag/AgCl (EAg/AgCl) to the potentials versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (ERHE). ERHE = EAg/AgCl + E0Ag/AgCl + 0.059 pH(1)where E0Ag/AgCl = 0.209 V at 25 °C for a Ag/AgCl electrode in 3 M NaCl and pH = 7.0 for the electrolytes based on 0.5 M Na2SO4.7 The stability of the sample was also measured using chronoamperometry for 30 min under a bias voltage of 1.2 VAg/AgCl. During EIS measurements, a frequency from 105 to 0.1 Hz and a bias voltage of 1.2 VAg/AgCl were applied. Mott-Schottky analysis was performed under dark conditions at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 3000 Hz. A high frequency was chosen to prevent the filling/unfilling of surface states or the build-up of a double-layer capacitance. Furthermore, different frequencies are necessary to evaluate the possible frequency dispersion.
Computational methodology
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using Quantum-ATK35 and the results are visualized using VESTA and Virtual NanoLab Version 2019.3.36 In order to model Fe2O3(110) and its oxygen defective surface, a primitive unit cell with a space group of R3c, and lattice parameters of a = b = c = 5.21Å and α = β = γ = 54.55° is taken as a unit cell. The linear combination of atomic orbital (LCAO) method has been used for the Fe and O atoms37 where different pseudopotentials are employed to reproduce the experimental bandgap. Recently, a bandgap of 1.53 eV has been reported for alpha hematite,38 using the GGA + U method. However, this 1.53 eV bandgap is still underestimated compared to the experimental one. In this work, we used the spin polarized exchange correlation functional along with the Hubbard model. Different Hubbard parameters are employed, where the (U–J) value of 5.5 eV is selected for Fe. In order to fit the experimental data, these high (U–J) values are required.39 After optimizing the lattice parameters of the bulk unit cell, a supercell (2 × 2 × 2) is constructed, from which the (110) surface is built. The thickness of the slab is set as enough as that of eight unit cells and a vacuum of 10 Å is created. The stability of this surface is confirmed from the positive surface formation energy, followed by the oxygen defective surface, Ov_Fe2O3(110). The surface formation energies of these slabs are estimated using our previously reported method.7,40,41 Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional and the pseudopotential of Hartwigsen Goedecker–Hutter (HGH) with tier 4 basis was utilized for the structural and energy optimization.42 A 5 × 5 × 5 Monkhorst–Pack k-grid with an energy cut-off of 700 eV is used for the unit cell, while a 5 × 5 × 1 k-point mesh is used for the Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110) surfaces. The density of states (DOS), partial density of states (PDOS), band structure, effective potential, electron density difference (EDD), and electron localization functional (ELF) are also simulated.
Results and discussion
Experimental results
As discussed earlier, the hematite layer was fabricated via the AACVD system using different carrier gases, namely purified air and pure nitrogen, where the former represents an excess oxygen environment while the latter indicates an inadequate oxygen environment. All these conditions were operated for 10 min to ensure a similar thickness of both samples. Fe2O3 and Ov_Fe2O3 notations will be used to denote the samples prepared under purified air and a pure nitrogen flow, respectively. The thickness of both samples was approximately 350 nm as identified using a profilometer indicating a similar growth rate of the hematite film regardless of the carrier gas employed. From the FESEM images in Fig. 1, it can be seen that the surface of FTO is fully covered with hematite insinuating that the AACVD technique enables the homogeneous deposition of the metal oxide layer throughout the substrate.

The oxygen-rich environment caused the Fe2O3 film to grow vertically and it forms a flake-like nanostructure. Furthermore, due to the random orientation and thin size of the nanoflakes, the film has a more porous domain and slightly exposes the FTO surface. However, the Ov_Fe2O3 samples exhibited an irregular shard-like nanostructure which tends to agglomerate into a bulky form with micro-scale size. The development of these nanostructures is closely related to the growing direction of the hematite crystal and will be discussed later. The 3-dimensional view of the as-prepared films is shown in the AFM images (Fig. 1(c) and (f)) where the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness for Fe2O3 and Ov_Fe2O3 was estimated to be 54.2 nm and 49.5 nm, respectively. The rougher surface of the former sample originates from the existence of a deep porous region and sharp nanoflakes in the Fe2O3 film.
The XRD measurement has been performed to investigate the crystallinity of the deposited thin films (Fig. 2), where the observable characteristic peaks of both samples can be indexed to the rhombohedral crystal structure of α-Fe2O3 or the so-called hematite (JCPDS No. 33-0664). Even though the Ov_Fe2O3 sample was fabricated under a pure nitrogen flow, it should be noted that the source of oxygen still exists in solution in the form of solvents and dissolved oxygen molecules, which allows the conversion of the Fe-based precursor to hematite. Moreover, other characteristic peaks corresponding to magnetite or other phases of iron oxide, which typically appear during the fabrication of the film in an oxygen-deficient environment are not observable, implying that the energy supplied in the AACVD technique is sufficient for the complete reaction and crystal formation of hematite. Nonetheless, several peaks which belong to the FTO substrate are noticeable, particularly for the Fe2O3 film due to the thin layer and the presence of a porous domain, which leads to the incomplete surface coverage of Fe2O3 as described earlier. In addition, the peak magnitude of the (110) crystal plane is dominant for both samples but the intensity of this peak for Fe2O3 is greater than that of Ov_Fe2O3, signifying the improvement of the crystallinity and formation of the crystallite with larger size. Hereafter, Fe2O3 and Ov_Fe2O3 will be denoted as Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110), respectively. With the aid of the Scherrer equation (see ESI†), the average crystallite size of Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110) was determined to be 106.25 nm and 42.49 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Ov_Fe2O3(110) also shows a much higher ratio of the peak intensity of the (110) planes to the peak intensity of other planes. Meanwhile, the peak intensity of crystal planes other than the (110) plane increased for the Ov_Fe2O3(110) sample. The oxygen-deficient environment that was created by the pure nitrogen gas carrier causes α-Fe2O3 to grow in multiple directions, which explains the origin of shard-like shapes in the Ov_Fe2O3(110) thin film.

The density of oxygen vacancies in the Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110) films was analyzed using XPS. Based on the high-resolution Fe 2p spectra in Fig. 2(b), three peaks corresponding to Fe 2p3/2, Fe 2p1/2 and the Fe2+ satellite peak can be clearly observed at binding energies of 710.5 eV, 724.3 eV, and 719.0 eV, respectively. These values are consistent with the binding energies typically reported for hematite.43–45 The difference in the Fe 2p spectra between the Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110) films is negligible. However, significant changes are detected in the O 1s spectra of both samples as displayed in Fig. 2(c). The peak with low binding energy is associated with the oxygen in the hematite lattice (O–Fe) whereas the peak at higher binding energy is related to the oxygen vacancies (Ov).46 Apparently, the O–Fe and Ov peaks of the Ov_Fe2O3(110) sample shifted slightly to higher binding energy with respect to that of the Fe2O3(110) sample. This is because the oxygen vacancies change the coordination of O atoms and the chemical valence of Fe atoms which influences the O–Fe lattice and enhances the binding energy.45,46 Besides, the magnitude of the Ov characteristic peak of the Ov_Fe2O3(110) film is greater than that of the Fe2O3(110) counterpart as presented in the inset of Fig. 2(c). This proves that the deposition of hematite using AACVD under a N2 environment can amplify the density of oxygen vacancies. XPS survey spectra were also taken as presented in Fig. S1.† Based on these spectra, other unwanted elements such as Sn (which may appear due to the uncontrollable diffusion from FTO)45,47 are not detected for both samples.
TEM images were also obtained to examine the structural properties of the prepared samples at the atomic level. Fig. S2(a and b)† show the parallel fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.25 nm, which can be assigned to the (110) plane of hematite.48,49 Point defects associated with oxygen vacancies can also be clearly seen in the crystal lattice of the Ov_Fe2O3(110) sample.
The light absorption property of the hematite films was evaluated using UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3(a)). The light absorption onset for the Fe2O3(110) thin film starts at approximately 574 nm corresponding to a bandgap of 2.16 eV as deduced from the Tauc plot (the inset of Fig. 3(a)) which is in line with the values reported in the literature.50,51 A slight absorption tail that extends up to 770 nm is also visible for this sample. When the hematite film was deposited in a nitrogen environment, a substantial increment in the light absorption across the entire spectral range was detected and the estimated bandgap energy narrowed to 2.10 eV in comparison with that of the film fabricated under a purified air flow. This could be attributed to (i) the shard-like nanostructure that is well distributed throughout the surface of the substrate forming a compact layer and (ii) the high density of defects related to the oxygen vacancies in the crystal lattice and on the surface of the Ov_Fe2O3(110) film. In terms of morphology, the compact thin film of Ov_Fe2O3(110) causes the incident light to be absorbed at each point on the substrate. However, the Fe2O3(110) sample, which has exposed the FTO surface as confirmed from the XRD and FESEM analyses, allows a part of the light to simply pass through it and reduces the light absorption capability. Meanwhile, the high concentration of the oxygen vacancies in Ov_Fe2O3(110) may induce the formation of new electronic states. Recently, it has been reported that shallow states at both band edges (i.e. electronic states near the conduction band and valence band) of hematite and a deep donor state (i.e. a deep electronic state near the valence band side) appear in the presence of oxygen vacancies.52,53 This facilitates the photoexcitation of charge carriers by low energy photons and inhibits the rapid charge recombination.34 Moreover, the additional absorption tail becomes more apparent for the Ov_Fe2O3(110) sample, which can be ascribed to the Urbach tail, formed by defective states in hematite.54

Fig. 3(b) displays the Mott-Schottky plot of the Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110) photoanodes at three different frequencies measured under dark conditions. A straight tangent line was built to help acquiring qualitative information about the charge transport properties of the samples. The apparent positive slope of the tangent line verifies the n-type nature of the material. An average of the intercept of the tangent line with the horizontal axis, at three different frequencies, resembles the flat band potential (EFB) of the hematite films.55,56 The EFB values are applicable for estimating the conduction band of Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110).6 By assuming that 0 VAg/AgCl is equivalent to −4.64 eVvacuum, the conduction bands of Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110) are determined to be −4.59 eVvacuum and −4.51 eVvacuum, respectively. With the aid of band gap values, obtained from the Tauc plot, the valence band was deduced, which enables the construction of an electronic structure of both samples as illustrated in Fig. 3(c). The estimated electronic structure is in agreement with the values reported previously.57 The gradient of the tangent line was also utilized to compute the density of the free charge carrier, ND of the defect layer according to the following equation: (2)where e is the charge of one electron, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, A is the interfacial area of the photoanode/electrolyte, and d(1/C2)/dE is the slope of the tangent line as determined in the Mott–Schottky plot.6 As expected, Ov_Fe2O3(110) possesses a higher free carrier density (approximately 8.34 × 1019 cm−3) than that of Fe2O3(110) (approximately 2.89 × 1019 cm−3) which is primarily attributed to the excess of oxygen defective sites in the sample.
The increment of the free carrier could be simply explained from the atomic arrangement in the crystal of hematite. Fig. 3(d–f) illustrate the primitive and hexagonal unit cells of a perfect hematite (α-Fe2O3), where the iron cation (Fe3+) and oxygen anion (O2−) are arranged in a corundum structure. In the case of defective Fe2O3, the removal of one oxygen atom from the crystal lattice results in the generation of one point defect or the so-called oxygen vacancies which simultaneously reduces the coordination number of the three neighboring iron ions. So, the electrons which are left behind, lead to an increment of the total amount of the majority carrier in the Fe2O3 thin film. It is widely known that hematite is an n-type semiconductor,58 where free electrons that form a majority carrier in hematite, stemmed from the naturally existing oxygen vacancies. Nonetheless, the fabrication of hematite in the nitrogen environment amplifies the total number of oxygen vacancies which, in turn, considerably enhances the number of free electrons. The higher carrier density can improve the conductivity of hematite, which may eventually facilitate the charge separation.
The AACVD-fabricated α-Fe2O3 films were tested in a PEC cell as an active photoanode and their performance was analyzed using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The current density vs. voltage curves of the samples are simulated alternately under 1 Sun illumination and dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 4. The current density of the Ov_Fe2O3(110) sample is 1.49 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.23 VAg/AgCl which is approximately 8 times higher than that of Fe2O3(110) (0.19 mA cm−2). Obviously, the oxygen vacancies are responsible for the substantial improvement of photocurrent generation. In addition, the oxygen vacancies can act as electron donors.54 The PEC performance could be further boosted by employing a co-catalyst or introducing a surface passivation layer, which is beyond the scope of this study. However, taking into account the rapid fabrication process and outstanding performance improvement achieved in this work, the defective hematite photoanode obtained using the AACVD technique could serve as a leaping stone towards the commercialization of PEC technology.

In order to gain a deeper insight into the effects of oxygen vacancies towards the photocatalytic activity of hematite, the electrical properties of the thin film were further scrutinized. Charge transfer kinetics at the interfaces is one of the main factors, which determines the PEC performance of a photoanode.59 To evaluate this effect, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out using a similar cell configuration to that in LSV analysis, under light illumination at a bias voltage of 1.2 VAg/AgCl. The experimental data were best fitted using a Voigt circuit comprising an R component connected in series with two R–Q parallel components as illustrated by the equivalent circuit in the bottom inset of the Nyquist plot (Fig. 5(a)). Both R–Q parallel components correspond to the two imperfect semicircles observed in the fitted line. The R1–Q1 component (i.e. the semicircle in a high frequency domain) can be attributed to the charge transport process within the bulk of the hematite film whereas the R2–C2 component (i.e. the semicircle in a low frequency domain) can be attributed to the charge transfer process at the electrolyte/hematite photoanode interface. As evident from Table 1, the Ov_Fe2O3(110) sample shows smaller semicircles than Fe2O3(110), which has much lower charge transport transfer in the bulk (R1) and charge transfer resistance at the interface (R2). In other words, the injection rate of holes on the surface of Ov_Fe2O3(110) into the electrolyte is relatively high, expediting the oxidation process of water molecules to oxygen. Meanwhile, the low charge transport resistance within the bulk of the Ov_Fe2O3(110) film allows rapid transport of the photoexcited electrons towards the counter electrode for hydrogen production.

The chopping current–time (I–t) curve in Fig. 5(b) indicates that the sample is highly responsive toward the presence and absence of light. The curve was then converted to lnD vs. the time graph (Fig. S3†) using eqn (S2) and (S3) in the ESI,† to determine the transient time where a longer transient time corresponds to a slower charge recombination rate and vice versa.60 As listed in Table 1, the values were estimated to be 0.08 and 0.38 s for Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110), respectively, implying that the oxygen vacancies retard the charge recombination process and increase the electron lifetime. The stability of Ov_Fe2O3(110) under a prolonged exposure toward light and bias voltage was also examined. As can be seen from Fig. S4,† the Ov_Fe2O3(110) sample exhibits relatively stable performance under constant light illumination for a duration of 30 min at a bias voltage of 1.2 VAg/AgCl. This finding proves that the high density of oxygen vacancies in hematite does not adversely affect the stability of the photoanode against light soaking or electrical bias. The reliability of the analysis and the reproducibility of the hematite thin film were verified by measuring the performance of several samples fabricated under identical conditions. Fig. S5† shows the photocurrent density of four Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110) photoanodes prepared using the AACVD technique. As compared to the LSV result discussed earlier, consistent results were observed for the photocurrent density, which proves that the maximum PEC performance is actually achievable with a 10 min deposition period in a nitrogen environment.
Based on the analysis above, the significant increase of the PEC performance for the hematite film fabricated under a pure nitrogen flow relative to that of the sample prepared using purified air can be ascribed to several factors. For the most part, the greater density of oxygen vacancies is the most influential factor that fosters the photocurrent generation of Ov_Fe2O3(110). The oxygen vacancies increase the conductivity of bulk hematite, leading to a better charge separation and preventing charge recombination.61 This is supported by the low charge transport resistance and longer transient time as determined from EIS and chopping I–t analyses, respectively. Meanwhile, the reduced charge transfer resistance at the interface as determined by EIS was also contributed to by the presence of oxygen vacancies. The defect sites facilitate the adsorption of water molecules onto the surface of hematite, which subsequently accelerates the electrocatalytic process. In addition, the presence of oxygen vacancies contributes to the improvement of the light absorption capability of the Ov_Fe2O3(110) sample as detected by UV-vis spectroscopy. The stronger light absorption intensifies the number of photoexcited electron–hole pairs, which ultimately increases the total amount of charges available for the oxidation process of water. From the viewpoint of the crystal structure, the (110) plane provides a high-mobility pathway for photoexcited electrons whereas the (104) plane is favorable for trapping the generated holes on the surface of hematite, rendering the holes available for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recently, it has been reported that the (012) facet has optimal interaction with all oxygenated intermediates, which is beneficial for intermediary adsorption/desorption and hence decreases the kinetics barrier for the OER. The balance between these crystal planes that was observed in the XRD pattern of the Ov_Fe2O3(110) sample promotes charge transport and charge separation, which eventually increase the photocurrent.
However, the morphological properties of the Fe2O3(110) sample with a nanoflake structure are in fact superior to those of Ov_Fe2O3(110) with shard-like shapes. As shown in the FESEM and AFM analyses, the thin structure of nanoflakes could shorten the path length for the electron and hole transport, which may prevent the charge recombination process induced by the limited charge carrier diffusion length. Besides, the rougher surface of nanoflakes would also enlarge the available sites for photocatalytic activity escalating the charge separation efficiency. In spite of this, Fe2O3(110) still exhibited much lower current density in comparison with Ov_Fe2O3(110), suggesting that the film morphology has less influence towards the PEC performance. Thus, we believe that the point defects related to oxygen vacancies are the paramount features contributing to the extraordinary generation of photocurrent density.
To validate that oxygen vacancies are the predominant parameter governing the efficiency of Fe2O3 in this study, the effect of the thickness and surface roughness of the samples fabricated under different gas flows was further investigated. Firstly, the deposition period for the Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110) samples was manipulated with the aim of controlling film thickness where a longer deposition time would lead to a greater thickness and vice versa. A duration of 10, 20, 40, and 60 min was selected for the fabrication of Fe2O3(110) whereas a duration of 5, 10, 15, and 20 min was selected for the fabrication of Ov_Fe2O3(110). The time of deposition was chosen differently to achieve the optimum PEC performance for the respective devices. As observed in the LSV analysis (Fig. 6), the performance of the hematite samples fabricated either via purified air or a pure nitrogen flow improves with the deposition period until a certain optimum value followed by a significant performance drop. The champion device for the Fe2O3(110) group was shown by the sample prepared for 40 min whereas only 10 min deposition time is needed to reach the optimum conditions for the Ov_Fe2O3(110) group. The best Ov_Fe2O3(110) photoanode has a shorter deposition time which resulted in a thinner layer; the PEC performance is much better than that of the thicker Fe2O3(110) counterpart signifying that the photoelectrocatalytic activity of hematite highly depends on the oxygen vacancies.
 Fig. 6  PEC performance of (a) Fe2O3(110) and (b) Ov_Fe2O3(110) fabricated using AACVD at diverse deposition times. 
The surface roughness of all Fe2O3(110) samples was examined as shown in Fig. S6.† As expected, prolonging the deposition time of Fe2O3(110) up to 40 min leads to a gradual increment in the RMS roughness due to the conversion of nanoflakes to nanoflowers (Fig. S7†). The roughness of the best sample in the Fe2O3(110) group exhibits a much higher value (129.6 nm) compared to the roughness of the optimum Ov_Fe2O3(110) (49.5 nm), as seen in Fig. 1(f). Previous reports have witnessed a notable enhancement in the generated PEC photocurrent upon increasing the roughness of the photoanode since a rougher surface enlarges the available sites for catalytic activity. In spite of this well-known fact, Ov_Fe2O3(110) fabricated for 10 min, which possesses relatively lower RMS roughness with respect to Fe2O3(110) fabricated for 40 min, still exhibits higher PEC performance indicative of a greater impact of oxygen vacancies towards the water oxidation process.
It is noted that the optimum Ov_Fe2O3(110) sample is unable to be as thick as Fe2O3(110) in spite of the fact that a thicker layer may increase the light absorption. Basically, an increase in the hematite film thickness leads to a corresponding increase in the light absorption of the film. This results in a higher excitation rate of electron–hole pairs and greater hydrogen production. However, the extremely thick hematite film substantially lowers the overall performance owing to the limitation of charge carrier diffusion length. Nonetheless, in the case of Ov_Fe2O3(110) that possesses a high amount of oxygen vacancies, the oxygen vacancies can create trap states on the surface of the hematite layer, subsequently making the photoanode behave like an insulator. In other words, extremely large quantities of oxygen defect sites would reduce the charge transfer ability at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, intensify the charge recombination rate, and plummet the generation of current density. Besides, several previous studies have proved that oxygen vacancies are able to migrate to the surface of the oxide-based semiconductor such as TiO2 under electrical bias, which might be applicable for the hematite photoanode.62 If this is the case, this feature would be detrimental to the hematite film with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies, since hematite requires a relatively large overpotential (about 0.5–0.6 V) to drive the superior charge transport, charge separation, and charge transfer efficiency provided by oxygen vacancies while preserving the high light absorption ability of the film. To give a more comprehensive view regarding this phenomenon, a deeper analysis is still ongoing in our lab, which will be discussed in a separate report.
Electronic properties
In order to countercheck our experimental data, DFT simulations have been carried for pristine Fe2O3(110) and its oxygen defective species such as Ov_Fe2O3(110). Using spin-polarized DFT simulations, a bandgap of 2.02 eV is obtained for bulk hematite, while it reduces to 1.75 eV in the case of [110]-terminated Fe2O3 as shown in Table 2. Upon making the Fe2O3 2% oxygen deficient, the electronic and catalytic properties further improve. The Fermi energy level increases from 6.17 to 6.78 eV while the bandgap reduces to 1.72 eV. These data well correlate with our experimental results. A comparative analysis of the data in Table 2 led us to conclude that the charge carrier mobilities of Ov_Fe2O3(110) are better than those of its pristine counterpart. The reason behind this is that the oxygen vacancy produces flat bands between the VBM and CBM, as can be seen from Fig. 7. These flat bands are responsible for hole trapping centers, which alternatively reduce the rate of electron hole recombination. Again, this statement is also consistent with our experimental data and the already reported similar theoretical investigations.63

Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of these two surfaces is investigated from the water molecule adsorption energies. Four water molecules are adsorbed over the surfaces of Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110) at an appropriate distance and then allowed to relax. The optimized structures of the Fe2O3(110)@H2O and Ov_Fe2O3(110)@H2O systems along with their electrostatic potential maps are given in Fig. 8, where the O atom of water has strong inter-bonding with the surface Fe atoms of the Ov_Fe2O3(110)@H2O system, compared to that of the pristine system.

The stronger the O–Fe bonding, the higher will be the water splitting ability. As can be seen from Fig. 8, the average O–Fe bond length in Fe2O3(110)@H2O is about 2.16 Å while it is about 2.03 Å in Ov_Fe2O3(110)@H2O. Consequently, these short inter-bondings are responsible for strong water adsorption energy. The per water molecule adsorption energy of Fe2O3(110)@H2O and Ov_Fe2O3(110)@H2O along with their surface formation energies are listed in Table 3. The surface of pristine Fe2O3(110) is comparatively stable, having a surface formation energy of 0.48 eV Å−2 while that of the oxygen deficient one is about 0.44 eV Å−2. On the other hand, Ov_Fe2O3(110) is more active which is responsible for a higher per water molecule adsorption of −63.44 kJ mol−1. This high water adsorption energy can be correlated with the experimental lower overpotential of water splitting. In summary, oxygen defective Ov_Fe2O3(110) has higher catalytic activity (in term of strong water adsorption energy) than pristine Fe2O3(110). Again, these results and discussion strongly corroborate our experimental data.

In addition, we calculated the electron difference densities of Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110) with and without water molecule's interactions, as shown in Fig. 9. From Fig. 9a, it can be inferred that electrons are donated from water molecules toward Fe2O3(110) which results in an overall stable nucleophilic species. This can be seen from the red line in Fig. 9a, in the range from 7.5 to 10 Å along the z-axes. On the other hand, the interaction of water molecules with the Ov_Fe2O3(110) surface is totally opposite. Ov_Fe2O3(110) became more electro-positive, upon interaction with water which forms the Ov_Fe2O3(110)@H2O system. From Fig. 9b, it can be easily seen (the red line in the range from 8 to 10.5 Å along the z-direction) that water molecules have donated electronic cloud density to Ov_Fe2O3(110), in the positive scale.

Finally, we also simulated the average effective potentials of these surfaces along the z-direction, with and without water molecules which are given in Fig. 9c and d. The results and discussion of these effective potential plots led us to conclude that both Fe2O3(110) and Ov_Fe2O3(110) are stable with and without water molecule's interactions, however, Ov_Fe2O3(110) is more active compared to pristine Fe2O3(110).
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed defective hematite thin films in a very short timescale through the AACVD technique, simply by deploying a pure nitrogen flow during the fabrication process. The photocurrent generation of the hematite films prepared under a nitrogen environment exhibited a tremendous improvement of about 8 times in comparison with purified air-based samples mainly due to the formation of higher density of oxygen vacancies. The point defects associated with oxygen vacancies improve the bulk conductivity of hematite, enabling fast charge transport and efficient charge separation. While the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs decreased as proved from the increase of the transient time, the oxygen vacancies also encouraged the hole transfer process on the surface of the hematite photoanode, which expedites the water oxidation reaction. Nonetheless, appropriate control of the thickness is necessary to avoid the undesirable charge recombination as a consequence of trap states formation. The best PEC performance was obtained for the hematite film prepared for merely 10 min in a nitrogen environment using the AACVD technique. In order to countercheck and confirm our experimental data, DFT simulations were carried out for the pristine and oxygen defective α-Fe2O3 thin films. We observed that oxygen-defective hematite has a narrow band gap, electron–hole trapped center in the band structure, and strong adsorption energy for water molecules compared to pristine hematite. The development of the rapid fabrication process for the production of the film could pave the way for realizing successful commercialization of this green technology.
