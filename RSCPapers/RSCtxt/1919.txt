    , Accepted 28th June 2012First published on 28th June 2012AbstractAmid the investigation of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (SDSSCs), it was found that the incorporation of F4TCNQ into the solid hole-transporting materials (HTMs) spiro-MeOTAD forms a spiro-MeOTAD/F4TCNQ (strong electron acceptor) polaron charge-transfer complex. Careful examination indicates that the formation of the polaron charge-transfer complex not only facilitates the conductivity of HTMs but also inhibits the charge recombination across the interface of the heterojunction, i.e. photoanode/HTMs and/or counter electrode/HTMs. As a result, the performance of SDSSCs has been markedly improved by using the organic dye A2-F. At AM1.5 illumination the short circuit current densities JSC increase from 8.29 mA cm−2 (w/o F4TCNQ) to 10.95 mA (w/F4TCNQ), accompanied by a 20% increase of the overall power conversion efficiency, η, from 4.55% to 5.44%.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are considered to be economically low cost and have latent competitiveness with both crystalline and amorphous silicon solar cells.1–3 However, although DSCs based on redox-active liquid electrolytes (I−/I3−)4–6 have reached promising efficiencies with either Ru(II) based sensitizers7 or organic dyes,8 it unfortunately still encounters inevitable inferiority. Of prime concern is the leakage of liquid electrolytes, which seriously limits the device stability and hence prevents long-term operation. As an alternative, solid-state DSCs (SDSCs), where the electrolyte is replaced by nonvolatile hole conductors such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), CuSCN, or conducting polymers, have received considerable attention.9–12 Among the various SDSCs, a few exquisite cases incorporating spiro-MeOTAD as hole transporting materials (HTM) and Ru(II) metal complexes and organic dyes as the sensitizers have shown encouraging results with the power conversion efficiency (η) approaching 4.5%.13–18 Nevertheless, at this stage, several remaining obstacles need to be circumvented before promoting SDSCs to the next stage of high conversion efficiency. This is particularly critical for hole transport materials. For example, despite of the fact that spiro-MeOTAD shows the best performance to date, its conductivity is ∼100-fold lower than those not doped with solid electrolytes, like lithium bis-trifluoromethylsulfonyl amide (LiTFSI) and antimony salt,19 while its resistivity is still one order of magnitude higher than that of the liquid and ionic liquid hole transporting materials.20 Moreover, the interfacial contact between the spiro-MeOTAD and photoanode or metal counter electrode (CE) should be of serious concern, as it plays a key role in improving the hole collection and hence the power conversion efficiency. In an aim to improve the inferior conductivity, Grätzel and co-workers recently reported the application of Co(III) complexes as a p-type dopant into spiro-MeOTAD, and obtained an enhanced performance (η of 6–7%) of SDSCs.21,22 Therefore, the use of either Co(III) or other metal complexes has received considerable attention. In practice, however, syntheses of transition metal complexes may be non-trivial. This is particularly true for cases where a mixture of isomers was obtained, rending low yield of the designated product. This approach, together with the sophisticated purification process, may not be feasible, i.e., cost-ineffective, for practical applications.
In our continuous effort researching SDSCs, we are focused on searching for p-type dopants that are commercially available; i.e., those in mass production and that have cost-effective synthesis. In a relevant approach, the semiconductor industry has utilized a variety of p-type dopants to fine-tune the electronic properties, such that the performance of organic–semiconducting electronic devices could be boosted effectively.23 Upon doping organic or organometallic conjugated molecules into the HTMs and forming the charge-transfer complex, several orders of magnitude increase in conductivity and optimized hole injection at interfaces have been reported.24–28 We thus propose that a similar approach, i.e., to enhance the conductivity of solid HTMs via introduction of p-type dopants, may be applicable in SDSCs. We screened numerous potential p-type doping methods/materials that must also be suited for solution processes, including exposure to oxidizing gases such as oxygen or iodine,29,30 oxidization by Lewis acids,31 various aromatic acceptor molecules32,33 and transition metal oxides.34–36 We found that the strong electron acceptor perfluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ, see Scheme 1a) is an ideal candidate from the viewpoint of electrochemistry. F4-TCNQ has been widely used in organic light-emitting diodes for reducing the hole injection barrier by forming a narrow space-charge region near the metal contact, and thereby improving photo-electronic device performance.37–41 The energy level of the LUMO (−5.20 eV versus vacuo) of F4TCNQ is nearly degenerate with that of the HOMO (−5.21 eV) of spiro-MeOTAD. Thus, upon doping F4TCNQ onto spiro-MeOTAD the formation of a charge transfer complex is expected, leaving holes in spiro-MeOTAD to facilitate the charge transport. Moreover, upon doping with F4TCNQ, we may also expect a good metal–organic semiconductor contact in the interface between HTMs and cathode resulting from better matching of the energy levels, so that the hole injection barrier can be substantially reduced. The combination of these advantages may lead to a leap in the performance of SDSCs. Details of the mechanism and its application in SDSCs is elaborated in the following sections.

Experimental
Synthesis of the sensitizer A2-F (see Scheme 1b) has been elaborated in our previous report.18 Spiro-MeOTAD (Luminescence Technology Corp.), F4TCNQ (Luminescence Technology Corp.) Li-TFSI (Acros) and TiO2 paste (Eternal Chemical Corp., Ltd) were used without further purification. A prototypical configuration consisted of F-doped SnO2 (FTO) anode, TiO2 compact-layer, dye-coated mesoporous TiO2 layer, hole-transporting layer and metal counter electrode. Fig. 1 shows an SEM image of the compact-layer and mesoporous TiO2. In brief, the fabrication of SDSCs initially involves the incorporation of a 100 nm thick compact-layer of TiO2 deposited onto FTO via spray pyrolysis (450 °C). After that, TiO2 paste was spin coated onto the compact TiO2 layer and sintered at 500 °C for 45 min to form a mesoporous TiO2 layer (∼4 μm). This was followed by dipping into a dye solution with sensitizer A2-F, drying and spin casting of the hole-transporting materials (HTMs). Finally, the counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation of Ag metal.18 The AC impedances (PGSTAT 12, AUTOLAB) of SDSCs, SL5 and SL5-F, were measured in the dark at open-circuit voltage, −0.87 V, and −0.89 V, respectively. The valence-band ultraviolet photoemission spectra (UPS) were measured via He I (21.2 eV) as the excitation sources, with a base pressure of 10−10 torr. The photoelectron spectra were recorded by a hemispherical analyzer with an overall resolution of 0.05 eV, as determined from the width of the Fermi step measured on a gold substrate that was cleaned by sputtering.

Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of F4TCNQ, spiro-MeOTAD, and the mixture of spiro-MeOTAD and F4TCNQ (weight ratio spiro-MeOTAD:F4TCNQ = 90:1) in chlorobenzene/acetonitrile (1:1 v/v). Spiro-MeOTAD and F4TCNQ show the absorption peak maximum at 381 nm and 388 nm, respectively, which are ascribed to the ππ* transition. Note that none of them exhibit appreciable absorption at e.g. >450 nm. Upon mixing spiro-MeOTAD and F4TCNQ, as shown in Fig. 1, two distinctive new absorption bands appear with peak maxima located at 517 nm and 760 nm, indicating the occurrence of charge-transfer interaction. The assignment of these two bands can be referred to previous reports. On the one hand, the absorption of the oxidized spiro-MeOTAD ranging from 500–700 nm is similar to the radical cation absorption of a derivative of spiro-MeOTAD, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-diphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene.42 On the other hand, however, the anion radical of F4TCNQ reveals a distinct absorption profile ranging from 580 nm to 1000 nm.43 Thus, at <700 nm it is difficult to differentiate the negative polaron absorption of F4TCNQ from the absorption bands of the oxidized spiro-MeOTAD. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the absorption spectrum greater than 700 nm is mainly ascribed to the negative F4TCNQ polaron absorption.

The formation of the charge transfer complex, in theory, leads to a slightly downhill flow of electrons from spiro-MeOTAD to the newly formed charge transfer complex, leaving holes in spiro-MeOTAD to facilitate the regeneration of oxidized dyes and subsequent charge transport. To test this hypothesis, we fabricated the SDSCs by systematically varying the ratio of spiro-MeOTAD (S), Li salt (L) and F4TCNQ (F) in an aim to improve device performance. A2-F was selected as the testing dye, which was reported to possess high absorptivity in the visible region and the strategically designed alkyl chain has good interaction with spiro-MeOTAD, so that a remarkable SDSCs performance of η = 4.8% was achieved.18
The numerical parameters of the as-prepared devices and the corresponding I–V curves under simulated AM1.5G solar irradiance (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1. Fig. 3 shows the effects of HTMs with LiTFSI (L)- and/or F4TCNQ (F)- doped spiro-MeOTAD (S) on the solid-state PV devices. In comparison to device S with only spiro-MeOTAD as the HTM, increased amounts of doped Li in spiro-MeOTAD (devices SL1, SL3, and SL5) gave significant increases in both JSC and VOC. In particular, an enhancement of more than two-orders of magnitude in the overall efficiency η was observed in device SL5. The result can be rationalized by the fact that the Li-TFSI dopant has successfully increased the hole mobility, retarding the recombination between electrons in the TiO2 and holes in the spiro-MeOTAD.44 However, when the concentration of Li in spiro-MeOTAD is higher than that of device SL5, such as in devices SL7 and SL10, the PV performance decreases dramatically (see Table 1). For SL7 and SL10, we observe a slight precipitation of Li salts in the as prepared HTMs solution, which upon spin coating onto the surface of mesoporous dye-coated TiO2 films may result in discontinuous pathways for hole hoping from the A2-F sensitizer to the cathode. Interestingly, compared to S and S–F, even in the absence of Li-TFSI, an obvious increase of the conversion efficiency is obtained in S–F, indicating that the addition of F4TCNQ had a positive gain due to the formation of charge transfer complex. This encourages us to prepare a SLF device by incorporating both F4TCNQ and Li-TFSI into the spiro-MeOTAD. Remarkably, device SL5-F reveals a near 20% increment in η from 4.55% to 5.44% and a 32% enhancement in JSC from 8.29 mA cm−2 to 10.95 mA cm−2 in comparison to device SL5.

Fig. 4 depicts the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of SL5 and SL5-F devices. The spectral profile correlates well with the absorption spectrum (inset of Fig. 4) of the A2-F dye coated on the TiO2 film. Compared with device SL5, it is clear that the improved performance (in terms of η) for device SL5-F can be attributed to the enhancement of the IPCE from 49% to 58% at the highest response value (∼445 nm), making a direct contribution to JSC. In general, the short-circuit current density can be increased by improving the resistance in the photovoltaic (PV) device. These include the reduction of the series resistance and increase of the shunt resistance, i.e., the electron-hole recombination resistance. In this regard, electrochemical impedance is one of the reliable techniques for probing interfacial redox processes of charge carriers between electrodes and materials of interest.

To investigate the recombination impedance between electrons and holes in the as prepared SDSCs, for simplicity, only two types of interfacial interactions, i.e. those between HTMs and photoanode/counter electrode in the dark and under forward bias conditions were considered.45Fig. 5 and Table 2 show typical Nyquist diagrams of devices SL5 and SL5-F and their fitted parameters by Z-View software (Scribner Associate, Inc), in the dark under open-circuit voltage forward bias, −0.87 V and −0.89 V, respectively. There are two distinct semicircles in the low and high frequency regions. The low frequency arc (right semicircles in Fig. 5) is attributed to the electron-hole recombination at the interface between TiO2 and HTMs. Obviously, compared to device SL5-F with the presence of F4TCNQ (R2 = 4000 Ω cm2), device SL5 reveals a smaller semicircle radius (R2 = 1720 Ω cm2) in low frequency regions, indicating smaller recombination resistance and higher recombination rate at the TiO2 anode.46–48 This result is in good agreement with the trend observed in the improved JSC by increasing recombination resistance with F4TCNQ-doped HTMs (vide supra). It is thus postulated that the existence of charged polaron builds up Coulombic screening between electrons (TiO2) and holes (HTMs), resulting in the reduction, in part, of the charge recombination. With regard to the high frequency (the left semicircles in Fig. 5) and the series resistance, Rs, the result shows larger resistance for device SL5-F (R1 = 1350 Ω cm2, Rs = 380 Ω cm2) compared to that of device SL5 (R1 = 780 Ω cm2, Rs = 270 Ω cm2). This is in agreement with the worse fill factor for device SL5-F. The high frequency region is somewhat complicated, which may be attributed to two factors; one is the charge exchange process at the HTMs/CE (Ag) interface,49 the other is the electronic transport resistance (Rt) in the nanocrystalline titania film.50Rt is varied with both the Fermi level of hole conductor (EFp) and the applied potential (U). Moreover, the transport resistance in solid-state spiro-MeOTAD is too high to be directly discernible in the Nyquist.51 It is thus rather difficult to determine the component that dominates the first semicircles of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the as prepared SDSCs with F4TCNQ-doped HTMs.

For further in-depth investigation, the electronic energy levels of the valence band at the interface HTMs/Ag cathode were measured via UPS. Fig. 6(a) shows the UPS valence band spectra of the as-cast Spiro-MeOTAD:Li surface and the surface with F4TCNQ coverage. With a few Å of F4TCNQ deposition onto the surface, the secondary electron cutoff shifts toward lower binding energy by 0.5 eV, corresponding to the vacuum level shift at the interface, the result of which indicates the formation of the interfacial dipoles.52 The interfacial dipoles are created by the electron transfer from Spiro-MeOTAD:Li to F4TCNQ due to the large electron affinity of the latter (5.20 eV). The HOMO energy levels of the films are defined by extrapolating the edges of the HOMO peaks down to the background of the UPS spectra. The hole injection barrier (Φh) in optoelectronic devices, as shown in Fig. 6(a), is the energy difference between the HOMO level and zero binding energy (EF). According to Fig. 6(b), the Φh for the Spiro-MeOTAD:Li was deduced to be 0.6 eV below the Fermi level, the difference of which decreases to 0.3 eV after doping of F4TCNQ. If the energy band gap is maintained for each material, the reduction of Φh would lead to a cascade hole transfer from HOMO energy of HTMs to the Ag electrode and an increase of the electron barrier, which will lower the possibility of electron/hole recombination and hence increase the JSC in the devices.53,54 It is noteworthy that the energy values of HOMO shown in Scheme 1 represent the energy difference between HOMO and the vacuum level. On the other hand, the band diagram shown in Fig. 6(b) plots the energy level with respect to the Fermi level. There is a 0.5 eV shift in vacuum level between Spiro:Li and the complex of Spiro:Li:F4TCNQ. If the vacuum levels are aligned together, according to Fig. 6(b), the HOMO level of the complex should be 0.2 eV below HOMO of Spiro:Li, consistent with that depicted in Scheme 1.

In parallel, we have also fabricated metal/HTMs/metal reference devices (without the presence of dyes) in order to analyze the effect of p-type dopant alone with lithium salt and/or F4TCNQ added onto spiro-MeOTAD. The resulting J–V curves of metal/HTMs/metal with various weight ratio of 90:0:0(S), 90:5:0(SL5), 90:0:1(S–F), 90:5:1(SL5-F) are depicted in Fig. 7. Evidently, the current densities are linearly dependent on the voltage at the range from −2 V to 2 V. The slope in the J–V curve follows a trend of 90:5:1(SL5-F) > 90:0:1(S–F) > 90:5:0(SL5) > 90:0:0(S), which agrees well with that of the PV performance of SL5-F, SL5, S-F and S devices. This can be attributed to the improved HTMs conductivity and low charge injection barrier in the interface between HTMs and the Ag counter electrode.

Conclusions
In sum, blending spiro-MeOTAD based HTMs matrix with F4TCNQ forms a F4TCNQ/spiro-MeOTAD polaron charge-transfer complex, which spectroscopically reveals the positive polaron absorption of spiro-MeOTAD and negative polaron absorption of F4TCNQ at 500 nm and 750 nm, respectively. Using a prototypical solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell with F4TCNQ and Li-TFSI doped spiro-MeOTAD based HTM, we have successfully improved the conversion efficiency from 4.55% to 5.44% and the JSC from 8.29 mA cm−2 to 10.95 mA cm−2. We thus demonstrate for the first time the use of the popular organic electron acceptor, F4TCNQ, forming a charge-transfer complex with HTMs to attain higher performance of SDSCs. We also believe that other commercially accessible organic acceptors should be equally feasible to serve as the much needed p-type dopant, which may open up an alternative avenue en route to high performance SDSCs.
