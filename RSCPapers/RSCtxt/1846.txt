    , Accepted 17th May 2023First published on 17th May 2023AbstractOptical limiters are greatly needed to protect eyes and sensitive optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors and sensors from laser damage, but they are currently plagued by low efficiency. In this work, we utilized Cu3VSe4 nanocrystals (NCs) to enhance laser protection performance, and they exhibit higher saturation intensity and broader nonlinear spectral response extending into the near IR region than the C60 benchmark. A flexible optical limiter goggle prototype based on the NCs significantly attenuated the incident laser beam, with Z scan and I scan measurements demonstrating a giant nonlinear absorption coefficient β value of 1.0 × 10−7 m W−1, a large optical damage threshold of 3.5 J cm−2, and a small starting threshold of 0.22 J cm−2. Transient absorption spectroscopy disclosed that the origin of the excellent nonlinearity was associated with quasi-static dielectric resonance behavior and a large TPA cross-section of 3.3 × 106 GM was measured for Cu3VSe4 NCs, suggesting the potential of intermediate bandgap (IB) semiconductors as alternatives to plasmonic noble metals for ultrafast photonics. Hence, optical limiters based on such semiconductors offer new avenues for laser protection in optoelectronic and defense fields.
Introduction
In recent years, lasers have been widely used in many fields such as the processing industry, scientific research, and medical and defense fields due to their high power, coherence, brightness, etc. The ensuing question is how to protect sensitive components including photodetectors, sensors, eyes, and photoelectric devices, and for this, optical limiters blocking incident beams of high energy to prevent sudden laser exposure damage are in urgent demand. Wearable, deformable, and flexible devices such as eye protection goggles are particularly desirable.1 Usually, materials with reverse saturable absorption (RSA) properties, i.e., third-order nonlinear optical behavior, are ideal self-adaptive optical limiters as they allow the passage of low intensity light while preventing the transmittance of high-energy light. Many materials exhibit strong RSA responses, such as organic materials that have the advantages of a low starting threshold and large nonlinear coefficient, but are constrained by low damage thresholds. In contrast, the damage thresholds of inorganic materials are relatively high but the nonlinear coefficient is usually not large enough, and processability is not satisfactory due to the limitation of dispersion. More importantly, current materials frequently suffer from low attenuation ratios in optical limiting.2
Under this context, limiters based on new concepts (such as plasmonic metasurfaces and quasi-static dielectric resonance to enhance optical nonlinearities and thus significantly raise efficiency) are desired.3–5 Intermediate band (IB) semiconductors, i.e., with mid-gap states within their fundamental band gaps,6 are natural epsilon-near-zero materials with quasi-static dielectric resonance. The partially filled intermediate band enables a two-step absorption process where valence band electrons are first injected into the intermediate band and subsequently into the conduction band.7 For instance, Gaspari et al. reported an IB semiconductor nanomaterial, namely CuFeS2 NCs,8 which exhibited a plasmon-like quasi-static dielectric resonance feature and giant optical nonlinearity.9
In this work, we turned to Cu3VSe4, an IB semiconductor to enhance optical nonlinearity, which is a member of the sulvanite family of Cu3MCh4 (M = V, Nb, Ta; Ch = S, Se, Te) or ternary metal-chalcogenides in a more general sense (including CuFeS2, CuAgS2, etc.). Previously, the plasmon-like sulvanite Cu3VS4 has attracted considerable attention from researchers.6 For instance, Wu et al. applied transient absorption techniques and discovered that Cu3VS4 NCs featured quasi-static resonances in the UV-visible range and converted to excitons via shell-coated CdS.10 Sulvanite NCs also have other advantages: their electronic and optical properties can be tailored by controlling their chemical composition. For example, their band gaps are tunable over a wide range (from 0.93 eV for Cu3VTe4 to 2.6 eV for Cu3TaS4).11,12 Moreover, for IB semiconductors, photons with insufficient energy for electrons to jump from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) can utilize the intermediate band as a stepping stone to create an electron–hole pair,13 facilitating multiphoton absorption. Therefore, IB semiconductors show huge potential in the nonlinear optical field but relevant research is sparse.
In addition, IB semiconductor QDs/NCs also excel due to their ease of integration with other materials or devices through further processing by spin-casting, dip-coating, and printing. Specifically, CuInS2, CuInSe2, CuFeS2, Cu3VS4, and Cu3VSe4 QDs/NCs have been reported as photoelectric conversion and photothermal conversion materials.6,14–17 Unfortunately, research on their nonlinear optical properties is scarce. In this work, we created a new member of the sulvanite family, Cu3VSe4, which exhibited giant reverse saturable absorption responses stemming from its quasi-static dielectric resonance. A proof-of-concept flexible goggle prototype based on the material demonstrated huge potential for optical limiting applications.
Experimental
Synthesis of cubic Cu3VSe4 NCs

Metal precursor. 
Cu3VSe4 NCs were synthesized based on previous literature.6,10,16 Briefly, CuCl (1 mmol, 99 mg), VO(acac)2 (0.7 mmol, 185.5 mg), TOPO (trioctylphosphine oxide, 3 mmol, 1.31 g), and OLAM (oleylamine, 15 mL) were added to a 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask successively. The mixture was kept at 120 °C under vacuum conditions for 1 h using a Schlenk line. The mixture was then heated to 220 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere and maintained for 20 minutes.


Se precursor. 
Meanwhile, 162 mg of Se powder was dissolved in a mixture of 5 mL OLAM and 3 mL OA (oleic acid), and the mixture was kept at 150 °C under vacuum conditions for 1 h and then switched to a nitrogen atmosphere using a Schlenk line.
The Se precursor was then rapidly injected into the metal precursor at 220 °C and reacted for 1 h, which was stopped by removing the heating mantle and cooled down to room temperature. The resulting NCs were collected by centrifugation and ultrasonicated in 4 mL of TOP (trioctylphosphine) to remove the residual Se. The precipitates were washed with toluene and EtOH and dried overnight in a vacuum oven for further use and characterization.

Synthesis of the control: spherical Cu3VSe4 NCs

Metal precursor. 
CuI (1 mmol, 190 mg), VO(acac)2 (0.7 mmol, 185.5 mg), 15 mL of diphenyl ether and 15 mL of OLAM were added to a 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask successively. The mixture was kept at 110 °C under vacuum conditions for 1 h and then switched to a nitrogen atmosphere using a Schlenk line. The mixture was then heated to 210 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere and maintained for 20 minutes.


Se precursor. 
322 mg of diphenyl diselenide (1.03 mmol) was dissolved in 2 mL of OLAM, and the mixture was kept at 100 °C under vacuum conditions for 1 h and then switched to 50 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
The Se precursor was then rapidly injected into the metal precursor at 210 °C and reacted for 1 h, which was stopped by removing the heating mantle and cooled down to room temperature. The resulting NCs were collected by centrifugation, washed with CH3Cl and EtOH, and dried overnight in a vacuum oven for further use and characterization.

Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the Cu3VSe4 NCs, which exhibit cube-like shapes with an average size of 10.5 ± 1.6 nm, and the size distribution is shown in Fig. S1.† The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1b shows lattice fringes with interplanar spacing (d-spacing) of 0.32 nm and 0.20 nm, which can be assigned to the (111) and (220) planes of the Cu3VSe4 NCs, respectively.16,18 The FFT diffractogram in Fig. 1c further proves the single crystalline nature and cubic structure of the Cu3VSe4 NCs. With regard to the chemical composition of the Cu3VSe4 NCs, STEM-EDX (Fig. S2†) elemental mapping images show the uniform distribution of Cu, V, and Se elements. The elemental mapping analysis result obtained from at least 100 particles shows a Cu/V/Se ratio of 4.3:1:4 in the Cu3VSe4 NCs (Fig. S3†). In contrast, in the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis, the Cu/V/S ratio is 3.7:1:4.6. Herein, STEM-EDX is considered more reliable because of the difficulty of sample cleaning or the problem of sulfur digestion during ICP measurement.6 For instance, the Cu exceeding the stoichiometric ratio may come from the indicated copper adsorption, and the Se deviation from the stoichiometric ratio in ICP-OES may come from the unavoidable loss of Se during the treatment process (formation of volatile H2Se).

The XRD reference pattern of Cu3VSe4 (PDF#70-5039) is given at the bottom of the panel in (e). High-resolution Cu 2p (g), V 2p (h), and Se 3d (i) XPS spectra of the Cu3VSe4 NCs. 

Fig. 1d shows the steady-state UV-vis spectrum in toluene of the as-prepared Cu3VSe4 NCs. The spectrum exhibits a broad absorption that extends through the whole visible range (300–800 nm), where three pronounced peaks at 358 nm, 540 nm, and 650 nm can be identified. These absorption peaks are attributed to electronic transitions from the VB to the IB, strongly evidencing that the NCs are IB semiconductors.6 The XRD pattern in Fig. 1e confirms the cubic P3m space group of Cu3VSe4 NCs (PDF#70-5039), in agreement with the HRTEM results, and the peaks at 15.9°, 27.7°, 36.1°, 46.1°, and 54.7° can be attributed to the (100), (111), (210), (220), and (311) planes, respectively. The Raman spectrum of the synthesized Cu3VSe4 NCs (Fig. 1f) exhibits five major vibrational peaks at around 128.5 cm−1, 178.7 cm−1, 215.0 cm−1, 255.6 cm−1, and 342.1 cm−1, which is consistent with the literature.16,18
The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicate the presence of Cu, V and Se in the elemental composition of Cu3VSe4 NCs (Fig. S4†). Moreover, the chemical information of the elements can be indexed through high-resolution Cu 2p, V 2p, and Se 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 1g–i). For Cu 2p in Fig. 1g, two characteristic peaks with binding energies of 932.4 eV and 952.0 eV correspond to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, which can be associated with Cu(I) or Cu(II). However, the satellite peaks at ∼945 and ∼965 eV indicating the presence of an unfilled Cu 3d shell are weak, implying that the copper is mainly Cu(I). The reason is that the outer electronic structure of Cu(II) is 3d9, and it will show strong characteristic satellite peaks in the XPS spectra, while Cu(I) has a full 3d shell and only weak satellite peaks will appear.19,20 Meanwhile, the binding energy peaks in the V 2p panel in Fig. 1h appear at 516.2 eV and 523.6 eV, corresponding to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively, which can be associated with V(V). However, the binding energy peaks at 513.2 eV and 520.7 eV should be assigned to V(II).16 However, the XRD data show that only the Cu3VSe4 phase is present, where vanadium is present in the form of V5+.6 In the Se 3d XPS spectra in Fig. 1i, there are two identical peaks at 53.2 eV and 54.0 eV, which correspond to the Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 of Se2−, respectively.21 In summary, the XPS results verify that the Cu, V, and Se in Cu3VSe4 NCs exist in the form of Cu+, V5+, and Se2−, respectively.16,18 The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plot shows a rapid weight loss starting from 666 °C, indicating that decomposition has begun at this temperature (Fig. S5†). This observation is consistent with previous reports,16 and the good thermal stability also meets the robustness requirement of laser protection materials under high laser irradiation. The slight weight loss beginning at 230 °C is due to the decomposition of organic ligand residues introduced during the synthesis process.
The third-order nonlinear optical properties of the as-prepared Cu3VSe4 NCs were investigated using the ns and fs Z-scan technique.22–24 The Z-scan results of Cu3VSe4 NCs and C60 at different incident laser energies of 532 nm and 1064 nm are shown in Fig. 2a and b and Fig. S6 and S7† (C60 is a reported benchmark optical limiting material at 532 nm, and there is no response at 1064 nm as shown in Fig. S7†). The Cu3VSe4 NCs exhibit a notable RSA response at 532 nm, which is comparable to that of C60 at 9.6 μJ and much higher than those of C60 when the input laser energy is higher than 20.0 μJ (Fig. S6†). Moreover, the nonlinear response wavelength of the Cu3VSe4 NCs can be extended to 1064 nm, which is not observed for C60. The solid lines in Fig. 2a and b, and Fig. S6, S7† are the fitting data obtained through a nonlinear absorption model in the ESI.† The Z-scan data are fitted to the nonlinear transmission equation according to our previous work and the parameters are summarized in Tables S1 and S2.†25–27 The β values of Cu3VSe4 NC solution reach 6.2 × 10−10 m W−1 and 1.6 × 10−10 m W−1 at 532 nm and 1064 nm, respectively, and the imaginary parts of the third-order nonlinear susceptibility Imχ(3) of Cu3VSe4 NC solution reach 1.49 × 10−11 esu and 7.68 × 10−12 esu at 532 nm and 1064 nm, respectively (Fig. S6 and S7, Tables S1 and S2†). The band gaps of Cu3VSe4 NCs disclosed by the UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. S8†) demonstrate energy levels at 1.44 and 2.42 eV, which indicated that the optical limiting responses could be attributed to two-photon absorption (TPA) and excited-state absorption (ESA).

(f) The plots of normalized transmittance versus input fluence of Cu3VSe4 NC and C60 solutions at 532 nm. Both Cu3VSe4 NCs and C60 are dispersed in toluene with an identical linear transmittance of 0.7 in quartz cells with a 2 mm optical path length. 
To discern the order of the optical nonlinearity, the relationships between nonlinear absorption and the input laser irradiance were investigated. The depth of the valley (ΔT) in the Z-scan trace is plotted on a log–log scale against the fluence of the input laser, and the slopes of the fitting line for the Cu3VSe4 NCs and C60 solution are 0.96 and 0.53, respectively (Fig. 2c). In regions of relatively low intensity, nonlinear processes with n-photon absorption show curves with slopes of (n−1), indicating that the RSA responses of Cu3VSe4 NCs are due to nominal TPA processes and third order optical nonlinearity.28–30 The β and Is values of Cu3VSe4 NC and C60-dispersed solutions at different incident laser energies are summarized in Fig. 2d. The β values of Cu3VSe4 NCs become larger as the incident energy increases, suggesting that the observed two-photon absorption arises not only due to a genuine TPA but also from a sequential (stepwise) TPA. The sequential TPA process is also known as ESA, where real intermediate states assist the electron jumps from the ground state to the final state. Therefore, β varies with the incident laser intensity as it affects excited state populations.31 Compared with conventional 2PA processes, the power threshold to cause the stepwise 2PA processes is much lower. In extreme cases where the lifetime of the intermediate state is long enough, a stepwise 2PA process can be induced by CW light sources or even solar light.32 The specific nonlinear process endows IB semiconductors such as Cu3VSe4 NCs with promising potential of very low starting threshold and thus effective protection.
Dividing the normalized Z-scan data under the closed aperture by those under the open aperture gave nonlinear optical refractive information of the Cu3VSe4 NCs. The nonlinear refraction curves are shown in Fig. S9,† where no significant nonlinear refractive signals were observed at 4.8 μJ, but they appeared at 9.6 μJ and the intensity increased with the increase of energy. Together with the emerged loss of symmetry of the curves, the measurement suggested a solvent thermal effect induced by transient nonlinear absorption.33,34
The fs Z-scan results further imply the sequential TPA properties of Cu3VSe4 NCs, because genuine TPA often responds in a shorter pulse time, whereas sequential TPA does not (Fig. S10†). We measured the TPA cross section (σ2) using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (see below) through the equation hνβ = σ2NACm103, where h is the Planck constant, ν is the frequency of a 532 nm laser pulse, NA is Avogadro's number, and Cm is the molar concentration of the Cu3VS4 NCs (see details in the ESI and Fig. S11†). The calculated σ2 value of the Cu3VS4 NCs is as large as 3.3 × 106 GM (1 GM = 10−50 cm4 s per photon), which is even higher than those of recently reported perovskite NCs.35–37
Additionally, the I-scan curves (for the setup of the I-scan, refer to Scheme S1†) of the Cu3VSe4 NCs and C60 (Fig. 2e) reveal that the output fluence linearly increases with the input fluence at low fluence.38 While at high incident fluence, the output fluence deviating from linearity represents the typical optical limiting response behavior of the Cu3VSe4 NCs and C60, which is consistent with the results obtained by Z-scan measurement. The optical limiting starting threshold (Fs) and the optical limiting threshold (Fo, defined as the input fluence at which the transmission drops to 50% of the linear transmission) are 0.22 J cm−2 and 1.15 J cm−2, respectively, for the Cu3VSe4 NCs, and 0.13 J cm−2 and 8.74 J cm−2, respectively, for C60 (Fig. 2f).
To further understand the optical limiting characteristics of the Cu3VSe4 NCs from the perspective of dynamics and identify the optical resonance nature of the Cu3VSe4 NCs, femtosecond transient absorption measurements were conducted. As shown in Fig. 3a, with 400 nm pulses at 6 μJ as the pump light, the transient absorption spectra of the Cu3VSe4 NCs show photoinduced absorption features at 485 nm, 600 nm, and 725 nm, while ground state bleaching appear at 540 nm and 650 nm. The transient absorption features correspond well to the static resonance features. Specifically, the two photobleaching peaks corresponding to the static resonance, as shown in Fig. 1d, are sandwiched between the three excited-state absorptions, respectively, which suggested the transient absorption spectral characteristics of plasmon-like NCs. In these systems, the incident photon increases the electron temperature, which presents a broadened plasmon-like band, thus creating the aforementioned sandwich features in the transient absorption spectra.8,10,39,40 The decays of the ground bleaching at 650 nm (Fig. 3b) indicate the following processes: the sub-picosecond lifetime of formation is attributed to the electron–electron scattering leading to a Fermi–Dirac distribution of hot electrons; the fast decay of a few picoseconds stems from the energy transfer from the electrons to the lattice phonons; the slower decays on the time scale of hundreds of picoseconds and >1 ns are assigned to phonon–phonon scattering.8,10,39,41 The dynamics probed at 540 nm show a similar trend but are more complicated because of the overlapping between photoinduced bleach and absorption features.

(e and f) Representative decay curves of the Cu3VSe4 NCs pumped at 800 nm (e) and 1300 nm (f). 
An important plasmon-like dynamic feature is that the electron–phonon coupling time is highly sensitive to the pump power because the initial electron temperature is highly dependent on the pump laser intensity while the electronic dynamics of excitons are not.42 To distinguish plasmon-like dynamics from the exciton-like dynamics of the Cu3VSe4 NCs, transient absorption as a function of excitation fluence was analyzed. The results in Fig. 3c and d, and S12, S13† exhibit slower decay with increasing pump fluence, indicative of plasmon-like NCs. This observation is consistent with previous work on CuFeS2 and Cu3VS4, where Wu's group and Roberto and Giuseppe's group all attributed the resonance features of the absorption spectra of Cu3VS4 and CuFeS2 NCs to plasmon-like quasi-static resonances. The difference in the number of resonance modes between Cu3VS4 and CuFeS2 NCs was explained to be due to different shapes of Cu3VS4 and CuFeS2 NCs, which are nanocubes and nanospheres, respectively.8,10 Although this phenomenon is well recognized in classical noble metal plasmonic nanoparticles, in order to further clarify whether the shape is the cause of the difference, we synthesized spherical Cu3VSe4 NCs as the control (Fig. S14†). In their absorption spectra, the control spherical Cu3VSe4 NCs show only one dipolar mode for the oscillation of bound electrons (Fig. S15†), whereas the cubic ones exhibit multiple distinct symmetries for dipole resonance (Fig. 1d). Notably, intermediate- (800 nm) and low-energy (1300 nm) excitations generate all of the transient absorption features as the high-energy mode (400 nm) as indicated in Fig. 3e and f, because any mode elevating the electron temperature leads to the broadening of all the resonance modes. This transient absorption spectral characteristic also conforms to the plasmon-like spectral characteristics.
However, despite the significant similarity in the observed optical properties, the dielectric resonance of IB semiconductors is fundamentally different from the local surface plasmon resonance. Plasmonic resonance stems from the collective oscillations of free charge carriers, while the Cu3VSe4 NCs are all dielectric materials without a large number of free carriers in the ground state.6,10 Hence, the plasmon-like features in the transient absorption spectra actually originate from the unique IB band structure of the Cu3VSe4 NCs which enables Frölich resonance and leads to a quasi-static dielectric resonance in the visible region.43,44 IB semiconductors such as CuFeS2, CuAgS2, and Cu3VS4 have been reported to possess dielectric resonance. Gaspari et al. proposed that IB semiconductors do not show divergences in the dielectric response, and are therefore natural epsilon-near-zero materials over a wide spectral region.8 Indeed, DFT calculations further confirmed that the Cu3VSe4 NCs are IB semiconductors. As shown in Fig. 4, the band structure diagram indicates the existence of an intermediate band in the Cu3VSe4 NCs, showing that they are indirect semiconductors with two band gaps of 0.77 and 2.46 eV.

In addition, dielectric resonance leads to the enhancement of the electric field in the epsilon-near-zero region and thus giant optical nonlinearity.45,46 Fig. S16 and Table S3† show that the nonlinear optical responses of the spherical Cu3VSe4 NC control without dielectric resonance are much weaker. Currently, materials with dielectric resonance are mostly used to enhance saturation absorption, and our work herein demonstrates one example of their utilization for optical limiting. Table S4† lists the third-order nonlinear optical coefficients of a series of materials with dielectric resonance.
The colloidal NCs were embedded in large-area, transparent, and flexible thin polymer films for practical application scenarios of laser protection. The Cu3VS4 NCs dispersed in toluene solution form a homogeneous glue solution with the epoxy resin precursor, and do not precipitate during the curing process. As shown in Fig. 5a, the fabricated films and the goggles are uniform and transparent. Fig. S17† shows that the transmittance of the film is 60–85% in the range of 400–1100 nm. For the 20 μm-thick film with a transmittance of 0.78 at 532 nm, a β value of 1.0 × 10−7 m W−1 was obtained (Fig. 5b). In Fig. 5c, the plots of normalized transmittance versus the input fluence of the Cu3VSe4 NC film at 532 nm give the Fs, Fo, and optical damage threshold (Fth) values of 0.22, 0.73 and 3.5 J cm−2, respectively. After being bent multiple times at an angle of less than 90 degrees, the Z scan curve of the film did not vary much (Fig. S18†). The ΔT variation curve (Fig. 5d) indicates that the optical limiting properties of the film are well retained after bending. As a proof-of-concept application, the laser protection performance of the goggles was tested using a digital camera. As shown in Fig. 5e and f, the intensity of the incidence beam was dramatically reduced after passing through the goggles, suggesting highly effective laser protection.

Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrate an IB semiconductor, Cu3VSe4 NCs, as a more effective optical limiting material with a broader nonlinear spectral response extending into the near IR region in comparison with the C60 benchmark. Transient absorption experiments elucidate that the nonlinear absorption responses are related to their quasi-static dielectric resonance and a large TPA cross section of 3.3 × 106 GM was measured, suggesting the potential of Cu3VSe4 NC IB semiconductors as alternatives to plasmonic noble metals for ultrafast photonics. Moreover, the NCs were conveniently incorporated into flexible polymer substrates as optical limiting goggles for laser protection, which dramatically attenuated the incident beam intensity. Z scan and I scan measurements demonstrated a giant nonlinear absorption coefficient β value of 1.0 × 10−7 m W−1, a large optical damage threshold of 3.5 J cm−2, and a small starting threshold of 0.22 J cm−2 for the goggle prototype. Hence this work indicates that optical limiters based on IB semiconductors with quasi-static dielectric resonance offer new avenues for laser protection in optoelectronics and defense fields.
