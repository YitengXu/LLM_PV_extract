    , Accepted 19th December 2017First published on 20th December 2017AbstractThree ultralow-bandgap D–A copolymers (P0F, P2F and P4F) based on fluorene-substituted thiadiazoloquinoxaline acceptor and BDT donor units were synthesized and characterized. The effect of the number of fluorine atoms substituted in the fluorene side chain on the optical, electrochemical, crystalline and photovoltaic properties of copolymers was compared. The results showed that the optical properties and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of the copolymers are almost the same with an increase in fluorine atoms in the side chain, while the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level is shifted downward. P4F and P2F show better light harvesting abilities, higher crystallinities and low-lying HOMO energy levels than those of P0F. These copolymers were used as donors along with PC71BM as an acceptor for the bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells and optimized by adjusting the donor-to-acceptor weight ratios and solvent vapor treatment. Polymer solar cells based on optimized active layers based on P4F and P2F deliver a power conversion efficiency of 8.15% and 6.38%, respectively, which are higher than that of P0F counterpart (5.04%) due to an increase in all photovoltaic parameters, i.e., short circuit current, open circuit voltage and fill factor, and a very low voltage loss of 0.44 eV.
1. Introduction
In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their potential advantages, including light weight, low material cost and possibility of production of large-area flexible devices.1 At present, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been achieved in the range of 10–13%2 using fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers. Current success was primarily achieved due to continued development of new narrow bandgap-conjugated polymers using donor–acceptor (D–A) strategy, which is the most successful strategy for improving short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) values because it allows fine adjusting of bandgap width as well as HOMO and LUMO energy levels3via controlling the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and the acceptor. Recently, numerous D–A copolymer donors with wide bandgap have been developed and have achieved impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) using fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors.4 At present, one of the aims in the field of PSCs is to design new D–A conjugated polymers that should have high absorption in the near-infrared region (low bandgap) of the solar spectrum. Moreover, such polymers should exhibit appropriate molecular energy levels in order to facilitate the generation of excitons and their subsequent dissociation into free charge carriers at D/A interfaces present in the BHJ active layer and also have high hole-mobility. However, Voc of low bandgap polymers suffers primarily from the high-positioned HOMO energy level.5 Accordingly, maximization of Voc with low bandgap polymers is one of the critical factors in the development of high-efficiency PSCs. Recently, it has been found that the introduction of fluorine atoms into conjugated polymeric backbone is the important approach in improving photovoltaic, physical and chemical properties of conjugated D–A copolymers.6 In general, the attachment of fluorine atoms onto polymeric chains can be considered as an effective tool for decreasing energy of the HOMO level of polymers due to strong electron-withdrawing ability of fluorine atoms, its small atom size and highest electronegativity. As a result, fluorinated polymers possess lower HOMO levels, providing higher Voc because of its direct dependence on the difference between energy values of HOMO of polymer donor and LUMO of fullerene acceptor. In addition to the reduction of HOMO energy levels of conjugated polymers, fluorine atoms play an important role in increasing Jsc, Voc and FF in PSCs. It was shown that introduction of fluorine atoms into electron-withdrawing moieties of D–A copolymers simultaneously reduces HOMO and LUMO energies without significant influence on optical bandgap of polymers.7 In general, fluorinated polymers have demonstrated higher PCE values in PSCs as compared to their non-fluorinated analogues. Remarkably, fluorination also causes an increase in Jsc and FF values.8 This improvement can be explained by the effect of strong induced C–F bond dipoles that lead to higher mobility of charge carriers.9 In addition, it was found that strong F⋯H/F⋯S contacts and well-defined fibrillar structure of fluorine-containing polymers can improve the morphology of active layers and reduce charge recombination losses, thus improving Jsc values.10 It should be noted that some researchers make very different considerations based on different systems. For example, it was found that fluorine atoms can reduce HOMO and LUMO levels simultaneously,11 but it is also shown that it can decrease only the HOMO level without affecting the LUMO level.12 In addition, it was demonstrated that fluorine atom differently affects the absorption spectra of polymers.13,14 Evidently, the influence of F atoms on energy levels, absorption spectra and other characteristics is very complex and depends on the specific polymer system and also, it is not currently understood well. Nonetheless, in general, we can consider that fluorine atoms in the main polymeric chain decrease the HOMO levels of conjugated polymers and lead to higher Voc values in PSCs.15
The overall PCE of PSCs is strongly dependent upon the light harvesting ability of the BHJ active layer employed in the device. In order to improve the light harvesting ability of the active layer, it is essential to utilize the BHJ active layer consisting of donors and acceptors, which can absorb the photons from the wavelength region ranging from 300 nm to 1100 nm. Therefore, we designed and synthesized three new copolymers, P0F, P2F and P4F, based on new 0-, di- and tetra-fluorinated thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TDQx) moieties as strong acceptors and benzodithiophene (BDT) derivative as a weak donor fragment. We performed thienyl substitution in the 4th and 8th positions of BDT unit due to the fact that it is beneficial for broadening the absorption band, lowering the HOMO energy level and improving the hole-mobility.16 Quinoxaline (Qx) is an important class of heterocyclic molecules, in which two N-atoms at 1,4 positions make the Qx unit as an electron-deficient molecule. Qx has been used as the building block acceptor for designing D–A copolymers along with different donor moieties for PSCs, which achieved the high PCEs of approximately 11.34%.17 TDQx is a derivative of Qx and is a strong electron acceptor than Qx due to its rigid planar structure and presence of four imino groups with unique properties, such as high charge mobility, extending absorption up to the near infrared region and ease of functionalization with various aryl and alkyl groups for improving the solubility. Advantages of the “weak donor–strong acceptor” synthetic strategy and the interest of using fluorine substitutions allows for the improvement in performance of solar cells-devices based on our as-prepared D–A polymeric systems. The presence of fluorine atoms in the side chain (fluorene) of TDQx in P2F and P4F as compared to P0F leads to more deep-positioned HOMO energy levels without any significant influence on the LUMO energy level and allows for achieving higher Voc value in PSCs. Low bandgap width values are required for improving Jsc. We prepared PSCs based on novel copolymers P0F, P2F and P4F as electron donors. After the optimization of the morphology of the active layer by adjusting the donor-to-acceptor weight ratios and subjecting to solvent vapor treatment of the active layer, the PCE values for PSCs based on P0F, P2F and P4F were 5.04%, 6.38% and 8.15%, respectively. It was found that Jsc, Voc and FF values of the corresponding PSCs improve with an increase in the number of fluorine atoms in the main polymeric chain. These results indicate that the introduction of F atoms into the side chain of TDQx in the copolymers is a promising strategy for overall improvement of performance of PSC-based TDQx polymeric materials. Moreover, these PSCs showed very low voltage losses of 0.44 eV, which is the most important result of the present investigation.

2.1. Device fabrication and characterization
The device structure is denoted as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al. The indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication process sequentially in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and then dried under ambient conditions. After filtration through a 0.45 μm filter, PEDOT:PSS (Bay P VP AI 4083, Bayer AG) was spin-coated at 3500 rpm for 60 s to obtain a 40 nm-thin layer on the cleaned ITO substrate, and baked on a hot plate at 120 °C for approximately 10 min. A blend film of P0F or P2F or P4F:PC71BM (different weight ratios of 1:05, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:2.5) was prepared by spin-coating using its CF solution (concentration: 16 mg mL−1) at 2000 rpm for 60 s. After the active spin coating, SVA was used to tune the morphology of the blend film. For SVA, the films were placed in a glass Petri dish, containing 1 mL carbon disulphide (CS2) for 60 s. Subsequently, a thin film of PFN was spin coated from the PFN solution in methanol and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 90 s. Finally, an aluminum layer was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) through a mask, yielding four individual devices with 16 mm2-effective area. The J–V characterization of the devices was carried out on the computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measurement system. A solar simulator was used as the light source and the light intensity was monitored using a standard Si solar cell. The monochromatic incident-photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were collected by illuminating the device using a monochromator and the resultant current at short circuit condition was measured using the Keithley electrometer. The devices for hole-mobility measurement were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer donor:PC71BM/Au.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization polymers
The detail of the synthesis and characterization of copolymers is given in the ESI.† The copolymers P0F, P2F and P4F were obtained through Stille-coupling polymerization using Pd(Ph3P)4 as catalysts in good yields as shown in Scheme 1; the detailed synthetic processes are described in the Experimental section (ESI†). Crude copolymers were purified by extracting with methanol, hexane and chloroform, respectively. The chloroform solution was concentrated and the product was re-precipitated in methanol several times to obtain the resultant copolymers. The structures of the copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR, 19F NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (Experimental section, ESI†). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using chloroform as the eluent and polystyrenes as the internal standards; the results are listed in Table 1. The values of Mn of P0F, P2F and P4F are 11900, 12000 and 17200, with a polydispersity of 3.02, 2.63 and 2.76, respectively (as shown in Table 1). The final copolymers were characterized by NMR and elemental analysis as described in ESI.† These results indicate that the introduction of fluorine atoms have significant influence on the molecular weight of the copolymers. All polymers are well soluble in chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene.

3.2. Thermal analysis
The thermal properties of the copolymers P0F, P2F and P4F were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†) and the obtained data are summarized in Table 1. The TGA analysis reveals that the onset temperatures for 5% weight-loss (Td) of P0F, P2F and P4F are 365 °C, 390 °C and 410 °C, respectively. This indicates that the thermal stability of the copolymers is sufficient for application in optoelectronic devices, such as PSCs or light emitting devices (LED) and field effect transistors (FET).
3.3. Optical and electrochemical properties
Absorption spectra of copolymers P0F, P2F and P4F in chloroform-diluted solutions and in thin films are shown in Fig. 1 and their absorption properties are listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 1, all the copolymers demonstrate similar absorption profiles and possess two main characteristic absorption bands. The band at 300–600 nm can be attributed to the π–π* transition, while the band at 600–1100 nm corresponds to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units in the polymer backbone. The absorption bands of the solid films of the copolymers were shifted to the long-wavelength region as compared to their spectra in solutions; this can be explained by packing effects that lead to planarization of polymer backbones. The optical bandgap values (Eoptg) of P0F, P2F and P4F were calculated to be 1.01 eV, 1.09 eV and 1.14 eV, respectively. The fluorine atom can cause the formation of aggregates of the conjugated polymeric backbones due to π–π stacking, which leads to improved charge-transfer properties. It is also interesting to note that both in solutions and in films, the absorption spectra of the copolymers were slightly shifted to the blue region with an increase in the number of fluorine atoms; this phenomenon was also observed by other research groups.18

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to examine the electrochemical properties and determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The measured cyclic voltammograms are illustrated in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and the results are summarized in Table 2. The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO of the polymers were calculated according to the equations:HOMO = –e(Eox + 4.40) (eV),LUMO = –e(Ered + 4.40) (eV).LUMO energy levels of P0F, P2F and P4F are −3.75 eV, −3.76 eV and −3.78 eV, respectively. Thus, we can observe that the LUMO energy levels are almost unaffected by the introduction of fluorine atoms, and LUMO energy values for all three polymers are ca. 0.35 eV higher than those for the fullerene-based PC71BM acceptor (4.1 eV), which provides rapid electron transfer from the polymeric donor to fullerene acceptor in polymer solar cells.18
The HOMO energy level value of P0F was estimated to be −5.12 eV. After introducing two fluorine atoms into the acceptor fragments, the HOMO energy of polymer P2F decreased to −5.20 eV. After introducing four fluorine atoms into the acceptor fragments, the HOMO energy of polymer P4F decreased to 5.29 eV. Therefore, we expect that the substitution of fluorine atom into the fluorene side chain in TDQx lowers the energy of HOMO levels of the copolymers, which results in the value of Voc of PSCs based on these fluorine-containing polymers and can lead to better stability of the materials to environmental conditions. Our results agree with the previous reports on the helpfulness of using electron-withdrawing fluorine substituents for decreasing the energy of HOMO levels of some related conjugated polymers.18 The electrochemical bandgap values of P0F, P2F and P4F were calculated from the onset difference of oxidation and reduction potentials and are determined to be 1.38 eV, 1.44 eV and 1.51 eV, respectively. The values of Eecg of the polymers are larger than their optical bandgap values by ΔE = 0.32–0.46 eV. This discrepancy between the optical (Eopg) and electrochemical (Eecg) bandgap values can be explained by the exciton binding energy in the copolymers and/or the interfacial barriers for charge injection.19 We can conclude that the energy of the HOMO level of fluorinated P4F (−5.29 eV) is lower than that for P2F (−5.20 eV), which can be explained by the electron-withdrawing effect of four fluorine atoms on the thiadiazoloquinoxaline units of the former polymer. These results agree well with the report stating that the incorporation of fluorine is effective to control the HOMO and LUMO energy levels.
In order to obtain information about the absorption ability of copolymers in the active layer of PSCs, we have also recorded the absorption spectra of copolymer:PC71BM blend films spin coated from CF solution. As shown in Fig. 2, the blend thin films showed the broad absorption band from 300 nm to 1200 nm, and the absorption band in the wavelength region from 400 nm to 600 nm, where the absorption for copolymers is minimum due to the absorption of PC71BM, indicating that both copolymer and PC71BM contribute to photocurrent generation in PSCs.

3.4. X-ray diffraction properties
In order to obtain information regarding the effect of fluorination in the crystalline properties of the thin films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed; the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 3. All the copolymer films showed strong (100) and (010) diffraction peaks corresponding to lamellar stacking distance and π–π stacking distance, respectively. The P0F, P2F and P4F showed (100) that diffraction peaks are located at 2θ = 4.75, 4.89 and 5.09°, respectively. This indicates that as the number of F atoms in the fluorene side chain increases, the lamellar stacking distance decreases. The decrease in the lamellar stacking distance may be due to strong H–F interaction. The intensity of the (100) diffraction peak for fluorinated copolymers (P2F and P4F) is higher than that for the non-fluorinated copolymer (P0F). XRD of P2F and P4F shows a relatively distinct π–π stacking peak around 2θ = 23°–25° as compared to P0F (2θ = 23.66°). In particular, the diffraction peak observed at 2θ = 24.16° for P4F corresponds to a small π–π stacking distance of 0.38 nm, which is lower than both P2F (0.41 nm) and P0F (0.44 nm). This indicates that fluorination in the side chain of TQx improves the stacking of polymer chain. It can be observed in Fig. 3 that P4F has higher crystallinity than other copolymers, which is beneficial for charge transport and hence, improves the hole-mobility, resulting in higher Jsc and FF for the resulting PSCs.

3.5. Photovoltaic properties
The solution processed bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated employing these copolymers as donors along PC71BM as electron acceptors with a conventional device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/PFN/Al. PC71BM was chosen as the electron acceptor due to its considerably strong absorption in the visible region, which can fully compensate the absorption dip in these donor copolymers. The photovoltaic performances were optimized under different conditions, i.e., first adjusting the donor-to-acceptor weight ratios in chloroform solution and then subjecting to solvent-vapor treatment. It was observed that for both the copolymer-based PSCs, the Jsc and FF values initially increased with the increase in the PC71BM in the blend film and reached the maximum values at the D/A (1:2) weight ratio in the blend for both active layers; then, Jsc starts to decrease probably due to the reduction of the amount of copolymer donor material, resulting in the reduction in the light harvesting efficiency of the active layer and also unbalanced charge transport of holes and electrons in the active layer. However, the value of Voc is almost the same for all weight ratios. Without solvent annealing, all the PSCs showed moderate PCEs, i.e., 3.35%, 4.25% and 5.22%, for P0F:PC71BM (1:2), P2F:PC71BM (1:2) and P4F:PC71BM (1:2) active layers, respectively (the results were summarized in Table 3). The low PCE of these PSCs may be related to the poor nanoscale morphology of the active layers, which hinders both exciton dissociation and charge transport. The appropriate nanoscale morphology for efficient exciton as well as charge transport is required for enhancing the overall PCE of the PSCs. Among the techniques to improve the nanoscale morphology of the BHJ active layer, solvent vapor annealing is one of the main techniques to enhance PCE of organic solar cells.20,21 In SVA treatment, the solvent vapors diffuse into the active layer, inducing a reorganization of the polymer donor and fullerene acceptor across the bulk and simultaneously, also create an appropriate phase separation between donor and acceptor components. Among the various solvents used for SVA, CS2 has been employed for SVA treatment of active layers employed for organic solar cells.22 Recently, PCE of 11.53% for organic solar cell based on small molecule donor has been achieved when CS2 was used as an SVA agent.23 Therefore, in order to further improve the PCE of the PSCs, we have adopted the solvent vapor annealing treatment of active layers. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs based on optimized active layers, i.e., solvent annealed 1:2 weight ratio blend films, are shown in Fig. 4(a) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. After the solvent annealing, the Jsc and FF significantly increased for all the PSCs with a slight decrease in Voc values, resulting in the best PCEs of 5.04%, 6.38% and 8.15% for P0F:PC71BM (1:2), P2F:PC71BM (1:2) and P4F:PC71BM (1:2) active layers, respectively. It can be observed from Table 3 that the values of all the photovoltaic parameters, i.e., short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), were higher for the two fluorinated copolymers. The higher values of Voc for the fluorinated copolymers are related to the deeper HOMO energy levels of these copolymers since the Voc of BHJ PSCs is directly related to the difference of LUMO energy level of acceptor and HOMO energy level of donor. The higher values of Jsc based on fluorinated copolymers are related to the higher absorption coefficient of fluorinated copolymer-based BHJ active layers as compared to the non-fluorinated counterpart, which is evidenced by the absorption spectra of active layers (Fig. 2). The incident photon-to-current conversion spectra of the optimized PSCs were recorded (Fig. 4b) to verify the Jsc values of the devices. As shown in Fig. 4b, all the PSCs displayed a broad IPCE response from 350 nm to 1100 nm that closely resembles the absorption spectra of the corresponding active layers, indicating that both copolymer and PC71BM contribute to the photocurrent generation. The values of IPCE for the entire wavelength region are higher for the fluorinated copolymers than for the non-fluorinated copolymer (P4F > P2F > P0F). Moreover, the values of Jsc estimated from the integration of IPCE spectra are 13.06 mA cm−2, 14.15 mA cm−2 and 15.84 mA cm−2, for PSCs based on P0F, P2F and P4F, respectively, which agree well with the values obtained from J–V characteristics under illumination (Table 3).

In order to obtain information regarding the difference in Jsc and FF values and determine the effect of fluorine substitution in the acceptor unit in the copolymer on charge transport, we measured the charge carrier mobilities of copolymer:PC71BM systems by space charge limited current (SCLC) model with hole-only devices. The dark J–V characteristics of the optimized hole-only devices are shown in Fig. 5. The hole-mobility values of P0F, P2F and P4F blend films are obtained as 5.35 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 9.95 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Moreover, the electron mobilities in the blends, estimated from the electron-only devices, are about 2.56 × 10−4, 2.64 × 10−4 and 2.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for P0F, P2F and P4F blend films. The enhancement of the hole-mobility for active layers based on fluorinated copolymer as compared to the non-fluorinated counterpart may arise due to the fact that fluorination increases the interaction between C–F and C–H. Moreover, the ratio between the electron and hole-mobilities (μe/μh) for P2F and P4F are 2.65 and 1.38, respectively, which are lower than that of P0F (4.78). The higher hole-mobility and more balanced charge transport in P2F and P4F blend active layers compared with the P0F counterpart could improve the charge transportation and suppress the charge recombination, hence resulting in higher Jsc and FF of the corresponding PSCs. Moreover, the series resistance (Rs) was estimated from the inverse slope of J–V characteristics under illumination around Voc; the Rs values are compiled in Table 3. It can be observed from Table 3 that the value of Rs decreases with an increase in fluorine atom in the fluorene unit of TDQx for an optimized device and agrees with the values of Jsc and FF.

In order to obtain information regarding the charge recombination, we have investigated the J–V characteristics under different illumination intensities and the variation in Jsc with illumination intensity (Pin) (as shown in Fig. 6) since the bimolecular charge recombination and space charge effects are considered as one of the dominating factors for FF and Jsc of the devices.24 The relationship between Jsc and Pin is defined as Jsc ∝ Pαin, where the α-value represents the degree of bimolecular recombination.25 If the value of α is greater than unity, it is indicative to formation of space-charge or substantial bimolecular recombination in the solar cells. The value of α is 0.89, 0.94 and 0.97 for the devices based on P0F, P2F and P4F, respectively. These results indicate weaker bimolecular recombination in the P4F blend as compared to the other two blends.

In order to investigate the effect of fluorine atoms in the copolymers on the exciton generation and dissociation processes in the PSCs, we calculated the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) and exciton dissociation probability P(E,T) from the variation in photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) and shown in Fig. 7. Jph is calculated as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are current densities under illumination and dark, respectively. Veff is calculated as Veff = Vo − Va, where Vo is the voltage, at which Jph is zero and Va is the applied voltage.26 As shown in Fig. 7, Jph linearly increases with Veff in the low voltage region and attains saturation values at higher Veff. As compared to the device based on P0F, the saturation current density significantly increases from 14.78 mA cm−2 to 15.63 mA cm−2 for P2F and 16.98 mA cm−2 for P4F. The maximum Gmax was calculated from Jph = qLGmax, when Jph attains the saturation value, where q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer in the device. The calculated value of Gmax increases from 9.2 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for P0F to 9.7 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for P2F and to 10.5 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for P4F. Moreover, the P(E,T) values estimated from Jph/Jsat under short circuit conditions are 0.88, 0.91 and 0.96 for PSCs based on P0F, P2F and P4F, respectively. The enhancement in the value of P(E,T) for the fluorinated copolymer-based PSCs is attributed to the decrease in recombination rate, which supports the increase in FF.

In order to correlate the effect of fluorine atom substitution on copolymers with the corresponding photovoltaic properties, the nanoscale morphology of the active layer was investigated from the transmission electron microscopic (TEM) measurements and shown in Fig. 8. The TEM images show different lengths of nano-fibrills in copolymers:PC71BM blend films and correspond to the crystalline features of copolymers as confirmed by XRD data. The TEM images of P4F:PC71BM blend show more distinct nano-fibrillar domains with high densities than other two blends. This fibrillar structure is desirable since a bicontinuous interpenetrating network in a blend film accelerates the exciton dissociation and charge transport and thus, leads to enhanced Jsc and FF.27

A key factor for the improvement in the PCE of PSC is the minimization of photon energy loss (Eloss), which is defined as Eloss = Eoptg − Voc.28 In most of the PSCs based on fullerene acceptors, the Eloss is in the range of 0.7–1.0 eV, which is relatively very large in comparison to inorganic solar cells and may be attributed to the large driving force, i.e., ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO between the donor and acceptor materials. The large driving force would lead to high Eloss. We have achieved Eloss of 0.44 eV for the present optimized PSC, which is attributed to the low value of LUMO offset (ΔELUMO) (0.35 eV) between the as-prepared copolymers and PC71BM. Moreover, it is greater than the exciton binding energy (0.3 eV), which ensures the efficient exciton dissociation.29
4. Conclusion
We have synthesized three D–A copolymers with BDT donors and fluorene-substituted thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TDQx) acceptors with different numbers of fluorine atoms (without fluorine P0F, di-fluorine P2F and tetra-fluorine P4F) in the fluorene side chain and used these copolymers as donors along with PC71BM as an acceptor for the fabrication of BHJ polymer solar cells. After the optimization of the BHJ-active layer (adjusting weight ratio and solvent vapor treatment), the resultant PSCs based on P0F, P2F and P4F showed PCEs of 5.04%, 6.38% and 8.15%, respectively, with a very low energy loss of 0.44 eV. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the lowest energy-loss reported in the literature for PSCs using ultralow-bandgap copolymers. Since these copolymers showed a strong absorption band beyond 700 nm in the near infrared region, the PCE of PSCs can be further improved by using them in ternary BHJ active layer along with a wide bandgap polymer. We are working in this direction.
