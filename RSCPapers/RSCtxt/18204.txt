    , Accepted 8th November 2022First published on 11th November 2022AbstractMulti-component nano-oxide composite materials may present special synergistic effects as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Mesoporous β-MnO2/Mn3O4 composite nanotubes are built here via controlling the deoxidation process of carbon-coating to induce a partial phase transition of high valence manganese dioxides.

The excellent performance is attributed to the unique multiple phase transitions regulation phenomena of manganese oxide occurring in the β-MnO2/Mn3O4 composite material during the electrochemical processes, which significantly extends the cycle life of the β-MnO2/Mn3O4 composite material.
1. Introduction
Unidimensional (1D) tubular nanomaterials with their unique structures play a significant and promising role in fungible energy storage and conversion systems and have excellent applications in many fields such as solar cells, supercapacitors, photocatalysis, and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1–4 Transition metal oxides (TMOs) for LIBs are regarded as potential anode materials to supersede graphite (372 mA h g−1) due to their high capacity.5,6 However, TMOs always suffer from property degradation due to their low conductivity and large volume change during electrochemical processes which extremely limit their further application.7,8 From the perspective of the kinetics of the electrode reactions in LIBs, the lithium storage process is affected by both the Li-ion diffusion in the solid materials and the electronic transfer process. Based on the Fick rule that J = −D·dC/dx (J is diffusion flux, D is diffusion coefficient, dC/dx is concentration gradient, and “−” shows that the diffusion direction is opposite to the concentration gradient direction), to achieve a high rate capability, an increase of “D” and “dC” and a decrease of “dx” is required. Increasing the Li-ion effective contact area and reducing the Li-ion diffusion distance are the main methods to boost the LIBs’ rate capability.9,10 Therefore, it is necessary to design electrode materials with morphological structures with larger specific surface areas and higher stability. Here, designing TMOs with a 1D nanotube structure is an excellent choice because the large surface area can significantly improve the Li-ion diffusion speed in the solid electrode materials and the electrolyte/electrode interfacial area. Besides, it can provide the electrolyte with multiple contact locations, and thus benefit the electrolyte permeation.11,12 Meanwhile, the large interior hollow space of the nanotubes can also effectively buffer the volume changes during the electrochemical processes. In particular, the hierarchical design including mesoporous and nanotube structures will further amplify the advantages of the nanotube structures and show superior lithium storage ability.
Besides the morphological and structural design, the chemical composition of TMOs is also significant to achieve high capacity and rate capability.13,14 Manganese oxides are distinguished conversion mode anode materials due to their relatively low charging platform (1.3 V), low toxicity, and low cost.15 There have been a number of studies about MnO2, Mn2O3, and Mn3O4,16–18 but these studies pay more attention to single-component manganese oxides. Recently, many cases have demonstrated that compared with single-component nanomaterials, multi-component nanomaterials exhibit superior properties due to their abundant defects, high electrical conductivity, and multi-component synergy, which has made binary TMOs (e.g. NiCo2O4, MnCo2O4, ZnCo2O4, etc.) rapidly become a research focus.6,8,19,20 However, past studies have focused much on the spinel binary materials and neglected other binary combinations. Although a few studies have been carried out to optimize the electrochemical properties by compounding various manganese oxides, it is difficult to achieve a sufficient composite of various manganese oxides on the nanoscale.21,22 Compared with other common binary spinel oxides, the composite phases of manganese oxides are composed of any two oxides of MnO2, Mn2O3, and Mn3O4, which will exhibit superior electrochemical properties.
In this paper, a process of a hydrothermal method united with a subsequent annealing treatment is explored to synthesize carbon-coated mesoporous β-MnO2/Mn3O4 composite nanotubes. The β-MnO2 is prepared by a simple hydrothermal reaction. The Mn3O4 nanotubes are prepared after the deoxidation of β-MnO2 nanotubes in Ar. This process is controlled by carbon-coating (C-coating). Based on the principle that C-coating can inhibit the deoxidation reaction of high-valent manganese oxides, the carbon coated β-MnO2 is thermally treated to partially deoxidize to form a nanoscale composite nanotube material of β-MnO2 and Mn3O4. Abundant mesoporous structures are formed on the surface of the nanotubes by deoxidation and heat treatment processes, which can boost the Li-ion contact efficiency and improve the electrochemical activity. Moreover, the C-coating can also act as a conductive agent and a buffer layer during electrochemical processes, which not only alleviates the TMOs’ volume expansion but also significantly improves their conductivity. In comparison to single β-MnO2 or Mn3O4 nanotube electrode materials, benefiting from the unique multiple phase transitions regulation phenomenon of manganese oxide during the charge and discharge cycle, the C-coated β-MnO2/Mn3O4 nanotube electrode showed superior properties with high reversible specific capacity and cycle stability (679 mA h g−1 reversible specific capacity and 86% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 current density).
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and synthesis

2.1.1. Synthesis of β-MnO2 nanotubes. 
The β-MnO2 nanotubes (β-MnO2 NT) were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. All the chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical purity. All chemicals were produced by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. A solution was obtained by dissolving 16 mmol MnSO4·H2O and 18 mmol hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) in 40 mL ultrapure water (18.25 MΩ cm). Solution B was obtained by dissolving 30 mmol NaClO3 in 30 mL ultrapure water. Then, solution A and solution B were stirred evenly to obtain solution C, which was put into a 100 mL Teflon-linked stainless steel autoclave. A hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 160 °C for 8 h. After cooling to room temperature, the hydrothermal product was collected, washed repeatedly with ultrapure water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C for 10 h under vacuum to obtain the β-MnO2 NT sample.


2.1.2. Synthesis of carbon-coated mesoporous β-MnO2/Mn3O4 and Mn3O4 nanotubes. 
First, 30 mg dopamine hydrochloride was dispersed into 50 mL of a 10 mM Tris-buffer solution to obtain solution D. Then 30 mg of the as-prepared β-MnO2 nanotubes was dispersed into solution D with 30 min of sonication and 10 h of magnetic-stirring. The resultant sample was centrifuged, washed with ultrapure water and ethanol repeatedly, and dried at 40 °C for 8 h under vacuum to obtain the β-MnO2@PDA (β-MnO2@polydopamine) nanotube sample. Then the β-MnO2@PDA nanotubes were annealed at 350 °C for 3 h in Ar atmosphere to induce thermal decomposition of the PDA coating. Finally, β-MnO2 was partially deoxidized and the composite β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT sample was obtained. A schematic diagram of the synthetic process is shown in Fig. 1. Similarly, the annealing temperature was increased to 500 °C and annealed for 3 h to fully deoxidize β-MnO2, resulting in the Mn3O4@C NT sample.

2.2. Characterization of the materials
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) was used to photograph the morphological structures of the electrode materials and the equipped EDS detector (GENENIS 4000) was used to detect the distribution of the chemical elements. The chemical valence of the electrode material elements was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS ULTRA, Kratos, UK), and the bond energy was calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The phase structure of the electrode materials was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, SHIMADZU XRD-7000 with Cu Kα radiation), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20, 200 kV). The specific surface area and pore structure of the manganese oxide nanotubes were measured by automatic specific surface and aperture distribution analyzer (Quantachrome NOVA 3200e). Atomic force microscopy (AFM, MFP-3D Classic) was used to characterize the changes in the electrode surface structure during cycling.
2.3. Battery assembly
All the manganese oxide nanotube electrodes were synthesized by casting a slurry consisting of the active material, Super P (carbon black), and PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) (6:3:1 by weight) onto the Cu foil current collector. The mass of the active material loaded on the electrode is 0.320–0.450 mg. The counter electrode was lithium metal, the separator was Celgard 2400 microporous film, and the electrolyte was 1.0 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethylene carbonate (1:1 by volume). The coin cells were assembled in a glove box filled with Ar gas. The contribution of the C-coating to the charge and discharge specific capacity was not deducted in the test.
2.4. Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical properties of the manganese oxide nanotubes were characterized at room temperature. Electrochemical constant current charge–discharge tests were performed in the potential window of 0.01–3.0 V on the Neware CT-4008 battery test system. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed on a workstation (Versa SATT3 Princeton) by providing an AC signal with an amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range of 10−2–10−5 Hz. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (Versa SATT3 Princeton) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 between 0.01 V and 3.0 V in coin cells.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structural analysis
The synthetic processes and the schematic structures of the new manganese oxide nanotubes are shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the β-MnO2 nanotubes are easily synthesized by adjusting the dosage of NaClO3 and CTAB.23 During the hydrothermal reaction process, CTAB self-assembled into micelles first, then the Mn2+ aggregated on the surface of CTAB micelles and was oxidized by ClO3− to form β-MnO2 nanotube structures.
The synthesized samples were analyzed by XRD to identify their phase structure. In Fig. 2, the diffraction peaks of β-MnO2 NT point to the tetragonal β-MnO2 phase (PDF#24-0375) and the diffraction peaks of Mn3O4@C NT point to the tetragonal Mn3O4 phase (PDF#24-0734). No impurity peaks were observed for these two samples, indicating the phase-pure nature of the products. The diffraction peaks of β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT contain two phases including β-MnO2 and Mn3O4. No carbon peak was found in the X-ray diffraction patterns of β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT and Mn3O4@C NT because the carbon was amorphous due to the lower annealing temperature. It is worth noting that an interesting phenomenon was discovered during this deoxygenation process. The β-MnO2 nanotubes without C-coating were completely converted into Mn3O4 nanotubes, while the β-MnO2 nanotubes with C-coating were partially converted into Mn3O4 nanotubes after annealing at 350 °C for 2 h in Ar. In contrast, the β-MnO2 nanotubes without a C-coating were converted into Mn3O4 and MnO composite nanotubes, while the β-MnO2 nanotubes with a C-coating were all converted into pure Mn3O4 nanotubes after annealing at 500 °C for 2 h in Ar (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†). The process of the deoxygenation reaction can be described as follows:
(a) β-MnO2 nanotubes without C-coating Annealing at 350 °C for 2 h in Ar: 3 MnO2 → Mn3O4 + O2↑(1) Annealing at 500 °C for 2 h in Ar: 5 MnO2 → Mn3O4 + 2 MnO + 2O2↑(2)
(b) β-MnO2 nanotubes with C-coating Annealing at 350 °C for 2 h in Ar: 4 MnO2 → MnO2 + Mn3O4 + O2↑(3) Annealing at 500 °C for 2 h in Ar: 3 MnO2 → Mn3O4 + O2↑(4)
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns for β-MnO2 NT, β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT, and Mn3O4@C NT. 
Comparing the conditions and results of all the experiments, it can be found that the presence of a C-coating can control the β-MnO2 deoxygenation process. The β-MnO2 nanotubes are tightly wrapped with a C-coating, which prevents oxygen volatilization, causing a delayed deoxygenation reaction. This result creates the basis for the design of the composite β-MnO2/Mn3O4 nanotubes.
The microstructure of all the samples was examined with SEM. Fig. 3(a)–(c) shows that the β-MnO2 NT present a nanotube morphology. In Fig. 3(d) and (e), it can be observed that the C-coating and annealing treatment have little effect on the microscale morphology of the nanotubes of β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT. The inner and outer diameters of the nanotubes are 136 nm and 378 nm, respectively, and the wall thickness of the nanotubes is calculated to be around 120 nm. The lengths of nanotubes range from a few microns to tens of microns. In Fig. 3(f) and (g), it can be found that there are abundant mesoporous pores on the Mn3O4@C NT sample when the annealing temperature is raised to 500 °C, which may be caused by the release of O2 and the re-growth of nanocrystals during the transformation of monocrystal β-MnO2 into polycrystalline Mn3O4. In addition, the average outer diameters of β-MnO2 NT, β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT, and Mn3O4@C NT counted from the SEM images are around 440 nm, 420 nm, and 450 nm, respectively, (Fig. S2 and Table S2, ESI†). Moreover, the broader range of the EDS mapping shows (Fig. S3 ESI†) that the Mn, O, and C elements are distributed uniformly in the manganese oxide nanotube electrodes.

The structural details of the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT were further investigated by TEM. In Fig. 3(h), the TEM images clearly further demonstrate that the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT exhibits nanotube morphology. As shown in Fig. 3(i), nanotubes are composed of nanoparticles, and there are abundant mesoporous structures among the nanoparticles. In the HRTEM image of Fig. 3(j), lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of about 0.492 nm and 0.227 nm correspond to the (101) and (103) planes of the tetragonal Mn3O4 phase, which belongs to the space group I41/amd. The lattice fringe with a lattice spacing around 0.313 nm corresponds to the (110) plane of the tetragonal β-MnO2 phase of the space group P42/mnm. These results are consistent with the XRD analysis (Fig. 2) and fully demonstrate that the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT nanotubes have realized the nanoscale composite of β-MnO2 and Mn3O4.
The SEM and TEM results show that there are abundant pore structures on the manganese oxide nanotubes after annealing. The pore structure and distribution were further characterized by the nitrogen adsorption method. The nitrogen isotherm of β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT at 77 K is shown in Fig. 4(a). The surface area of β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model is at about 28.21 m2 g−1. In Fig. 4(b), the pore volume and corresponding pore size distribution are calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. The pore volume is about 0.15 mL g−1. The pore size is mainly distributed in the mesoporous range. The average pore diameter in the adsorption state is about 11.94 nm. The abundant mesoporous structure among manganese oxide nanocrystals can effectively alleviate the problem of the large volume change during the cycle, improve the contact area between the active substance and electrolyte, and show a high power density.

The compositions and chemical valence of the surface elements in the manganese oxides were investigated by XPS. In Fig. 5(a)–(d), the XPS spectrum of the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT sample shows four spectral lines: the full spectrum, Mn 2p, O 1s, and C 1s. In Fig. 5(a), the full spectrum indicates that there are Mn, O, and C three elements in the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT sample. As seen from Fig. 5(b), the Mn 2p peaks at a binding energy of 642.3 eV and 653.9 eV with a spin-energy separation of ∼11.5 eV point to the Mn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 levels. The Mn2+ peaks allot the binding energy of 642.3 eV and 654.0 eV, while the binding energy of 644.8 eV and 657.3 eV corresponds to the Mn3+ peaks.24,25 In Fig. 5(c), there are four oxygen contributions that point to the O 1s spectrum at the binding energy of ∼529.1 eV, ∼530.6 eV, ∼531.9 eV, and 533.4 eV, which correspond to the metal–oxygen bonds,26 the oxygen in OH−,27 the under-coordinated lattice oxygen,28 and the absorbed water,29 respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 5(d) that the three peaks of the C 1s spectrum with binding energies of 284.8 eV, 286.6 eV, and 288.9 eV are assigned to amorphous carbon, carbonyl carbon, and carboxylic acid carbon, respectively.30,31 These results show that there are two chemical valence states of Mn2+/Mn3+ in manganese oxide, which are consistent with the XRD phase analysis in Fig. 2. It is worth noting that Mn4+ was not detected in β-MnO2 by the XPS test. The possible reason is that Mn3O4 is wrapped around the surface of β-MnO2 during the deoxidation process of β-MnO2 to Mn3O4, which is also consistent with the TEM analysis in Fig. 3(j).

3.2. Electrochemical investigation
Cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves for the three samples are compared in Fig. 6. Three reduction peaks can be observed for all samples in the first cathodic scan. The first wide peak at 1.40–2.60 V for β-MnO2 NT and Mn3O4@C NT and 1.40–1.80 V for the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT can be attributed to the decomposition process of the electrolyte and the wetting process of the electrolyte in the nanotubes, which occurs only in the first cycle.32,33 The second wide peak at 0.70–1.38 V for all the samples means that MnO2 or Mn3O4 is reduced to MnO and the SEI layer forms.34,35 The second reduction peak sharply weakens in the subsequent scan, manifesting that the formation of the SEI layer only occurs in the first cycle. The third sharp peak for β-MnO2 NT at 0.08 V, β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT at 0.02 V, and Mn3O4@C NT at 0.07 V corresponds to the reduction of MnO to Mn° and the formation of the amorphous Li2O.36,37 In the second to fourth cathodic scan, the reduction peak for β-MnO2 NT at 0.08 V gradually ascends to 0.09 V, 0.19 V, and 0.23 V, for β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT at 0.02 V gradually ascends to 0.28 V, and for Mn3O4@C NT at 0.07 V gradually ascends to 0.35 V, which is a common phenomenon during the electrochemical processes of the manganese oxides. The change in reduction peak potential can be attributed to the small size effect caused by the decomposition of the electrode material into nanoparticles of about 5 nm after one charge–discharge cycle.14,38,39 In the first anodic scan, the two oxidation peaks at 1.28 and 2.35 V for β-MnO2 NT, 1.32 and 2.35 V for β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT, and 1.35 and 2.36 V for Mn3O4@C NT manifest that the oxidation reaction is carried out in two steps. The oxidation peak at low potential is related to the oxidation of Mn° to MnO, and the oxidation peak at high potential means that Mn2+ is oxidized to a higher valence state.14,40,41 In the second anodic scan, the CV curve is similar to the first cycle except for the intensity decreasing. Particularly, the peaks around 2.35 V for β-MnO2 NT show the irreversible capacity of the β-MnO2 nanotubes. In the third to fourth anodic scan, the CV curves for all samples are very similar to the second cycle ones. The CV curve of β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT presents the highest overlap degree compared to the other two samples, indicating the best electrochemical reversibility and structural stability.42
 Fig. 6  CV curves of β-MnO2 NT, β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT, and Mn3O4@C NT, acquired at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. 
Galvanostatic charge and discharge tests were completed to confirm the influence of the morphological structures, chemical composition, and C-coating for the manganese oxide nanotubes on the electrochemical properties for LIBs. As shown in Fig. 7(a)–(c), in the first cycle, a sloping voltage plateau for the three samples appearing between 1.0 V and 1.6 V in the initial discharge curve indicates that MnO2 or Mn3O4 is reduced to MnO. Next, a long voltage plateau appearing around 0.35 V demonstrates that MnO is reduced to Mn°. Two sloping voltage plateaus for three samples appearing between 1.0 and 1.5 V and 2.0 and 2.5 V in the initial charge curve correspond to the oxidation of Mn° to MnO and MnO to Mn2O3 or Mn3O4. This result is consistent with the CV measurements in the initial scan. For the three electrodes, the initial charge and discharge capacity at 0.2 A g−1 present about 2015 and 1148 mA h g−1, 1992 and 1137 mA h g−1, and 2183 and 1129 mA h g−1, respectively. The initial coulombic efficiency is 56%, 57%, and 52%, respectively. The large irreversible capacity loss may be caused by the SEI layer production during the initial cycle.43 In the second cycle, the long voltage platform of the three samples in the second discharge curve is observed to increase to ∼0.5 V, which is normal during the electrochemical processes of manganese oxides.38,39 After the second cycle, comparing the charge curves of β-MnO2 NT and Mn3O4@C NT, it can be found that the capacity attenuation of β-MnO2 NT is faster than that of Mn3O4@C NT, but the voltage platform stability is higher than that of Mn3O4@C NT. The capacity attenuation and voltage platform stability of Mn3O4@C NT are opposite to β-MnO2 NT. The β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT electrode has the dual advantages of the high voltage platform stability of β-MnO2 NT and low capacity attenuation of Mn3O4@C NT.

The rate capabilities of three samples from the 0.1 A g−1 to 5 A g−1 current densities are analyzed in Fig. 7(d). It can be seen that the rate capabilities of the three samples improve sequentially, especially at the high current densities. The results manifest that the mesoporous structures, chemical composition, and C-coating are effective methods to improve the rate capability. Benefiting from the reasonable structure and abundant component design, the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT electrode presents the most excellent rate capability with a high reversible capacity of ∼352 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1, equating to ∼33% of its initial capacity at 0.1 A g−1. This demonstrates its high electrode integrity and fast reaction kinetics. In contrast, β-MnO2 NT and Mn3O4@C NT electrodes present reversible capacity of ∼150 mA h g−1 and ∼230 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1, equating to ∼11% and 20% of its initial capacity at 0.1 A g−1.
A comparison of the Nyquist plots measured by EIS can reflect that the electrical conductivity and charge transfer efficiency are boosted by the manganese oxide nanotube electrode. In Fig. 8, the Nyquist plot consists of a sloping line in the low frequency region and a semicircle in the mid-high frequency region, which is consistent with the typical EIS characteristics of LIBs.44,45 Six Nyquist diagrams were fitted with ZSimpWin software, and a general equivalent circuit model was obtained. As seen from the inset part in Fig. 8, the equivalent circuit is comprised of Rs (the sum of the contact resistance and the ionic resistance), Q (semi-infinite diffusion capacitor), Rct (charge transfer resistance), and C (intercalation capacitance).25,46 In the initial state, the diameter of the three semicircles increases for β-MnO2 NT, Mn3O4@C NT, and β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT in turn, indicating Rct is also reduced in turn. According to the fitting results of the equivalent circuit diagram model (Table S3, ESI†), Rct of β-MnO2 NT, Mn3O4@C NT, and β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT are 501.0 Ohm, 365.1 Ohm, and 301.0 Ohm, respectively. This indicates that the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT electrode has the fastest lithium reaction kinetics. This is consistent with the test results of the rate capability.

The specific capacity and coulombic efficiency results for these three samples obtained for 500 cycles at 0.2 A g−1 are compared in Fig. 9(a). The β-MnO2 NT electrode exhibits the worst cycling stability. Its capacities decrease rapidly in the first 100 cycles and become stable at 200–300 mA h g−1 from 100 to 500 cycles. Importantly, the Mn3O4@C NT presents a quite high reversible capacity and this capacity gradually increases as the cycle progresses and reaches the highest value of 1254 mA h g−1 at the 345th cycle. This anomaly may be caused by the breakdown of the Mn3O4 nanotube structures into a smaller structure during the cycling processes.47 The morphological change of the electrode material can be observed through the SEM pictures after cycling (Fig. S4(a), ESI†). After the 345 cycles, the capacities decay rapidly and the active material begins to crack and fall off from the current collector after the 448th cycle, causing the cycle to deteriorate further (Fig. S4(b) and (c), ESI†). Compared with the other two electrodes, the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT electrode exhibits the most excellent cycling stability. Except for the first 50 cycles, the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT electrode always maintains a high reversible capacity between 570–610 mA h g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency exceeding 98%. Although the capacity of the Mn3O4@C NT is higher than β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT in the first 448 cycles, this situation is extremely reversed after 448th cycles.

To further analyze the advantages of lithium storage of manganese oxides, the coulombic efficiency and cycle property for the three samples at a high current density of 1 A g−1 are evaluated, as shown in Fig. 9(b). The specific capacity and cycle property of the β-MnO2 NT electrode are inferior at 1 A g−1 due to its low conductivity and huge volume changes during cycling processes. In contrast, the Mn3O4@C NT electrode containing the C-coating and mesoporous structures can provide a higher capacity under 1 A g−1. The reasons for the change of the cycle curve are similar to those under the 0.2 A g−1 in Fig. 9(a). Compared with the manganese oxides electrodes reported in the literature, it is seen that the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT here exhibits excellent properties, particularly the cycling stability at the high current density of 1 A g−1 (Table S4, ESI†). Meanwhile, compared with the other two samples, the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT electrode shows the most excellent cycle stability, and the capacity retention rate of 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 is ∼86%. As the cycle progresses, the capacities gradually decrease to the valley of 395 mA h g−1 at the 248th cycle, then gradually increase to the highest position of 831 mA h g−1 at the 812th cycle, subsequently decrease again due to structural damage, and finally reach 372 mA h g−1 at the 1170th cycle (Fig. S5, ESI†).
3.2. Long-life mechanism analysis
To evaluate the effect of structure design on the electrode cycle life, the changes in the electrode surface structure during cycling were characterized by AFM and SEM, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10(a)–(c), the surface roughness (Ra) of the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT electrode increases clearly with the increase of the number of charge–discharge cycles. This result is consistent with the phenomenon observed by SEM, as shown in Fig. 10(d)–(f). This shows that with the progress of the charge–discharge cycles, the electrode structure changes more and more. After a certain number of cycles, huge structural changes can severely damage the integrity of the electrode, causing the active material to fall off the current collector, which seriously deteriorates the battery performance. Therefore, high structural stability and integrity are crucial to improve the cycle life of electrodes.
 Fig. 10  The surface structure of β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT during cycle characterized by AFM ((a)–(c)) and SEM ((d)–(f)), respectively. 
Based on the above discussion, the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT electrode exhibits excellent cycle properties benefiting from the three advantages described as follows: (a) due to the multi-component synergy and abundant phase boundary structural defects, the composite β-MnO2/Mn3O4 nanotubes present more active electrochemical activity and higher conductivity; (b) the hierarchical structure design of the one-dimensional mesoporous nanotubes can provide a large specific surface area and free space, allowing lithium ions to rapidly diffuse in the electrode and the electrode/dielectric interface. Meanwhile, this ingenious design can alleviate the volume expansion during cycling processes and improve the electrode structure stability. These conclusions are proved by the AFM 3D images and SEM images of the electrode morphology after cycling (Fig. 10; Fig. S4(d)–(i), ESI†); and (c) the C-coating can also act as a conductive agent and buffer layer role during cycling processes, which not only further alleviates the TMO's volume expansion but also significantly improves conductivity.
Although many experimental results and data have proved that rational structural design and chemical composition regulation play an important role in improving the electrochemical properties of electrodes, these features alone are inadequate to improve the rate and cycle performance of β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT electrode to such a significant level. Maybe there are still some deeper reasons.
To further investigate the lithium storage mechanism of manganese oxides, their cycling processes under 1 A g−1 were monitored by XRD at the 200th, 500th, 800th, and 1000th cycle, respectively (Fig. S7 and Table S5, ESI†). Analyzing the CV test and comparing all the XRD patterns during the cycle progress, it can be found that the Mn3O4 phase in Mn3O4@C NT does not change, while the β-MnO2 phase in the β-MnO2 NT electrode there appears two phase transitions. Specifically, β-MnO2 gradually converts to Mn2O3 in the first 200 cycles and then Mn2O3 also gradually converts to Mn3O4 between 200 to 500 cycles. Compared with β-MnO2 NT and Mn3O4@C NT, β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT exhibits excellent cycling properties benefiting from the regulation phenomena of multiple phase transitions during the cycle processes. As seen in Fig. 11, this phenomenon is similar to the long-distance relay race, which completes the phase conversion of MnO2 into Mn3O4 through multiple phase transitions, achieving the effective series connection of different manganese oxides’ properties’ advantages. Specifically, during charging processes, Mn° is first oxidized to MnO and MnO is further oxidized to MnO2. The latter process requires more power and this process is more difficult than the oxidation of MnO to Mn2O3. Thus, the process in which MnO is oxidized to MnO2 is gradually replaced by the process in which MnO is oxidized to Mn2O3, resulting in the increasing content of Mn2O3. As the cycle continues, similar to the above process, the process of MnO being oxidized to Mn2O3 is replaced by a lower energy process, which makes only the Mn3O4 phase maintain in the β-MnO2/Mn3O4@C NT sample finally. The newly formed Mn3O4 will gradually counteract the inferior cycle properties of MnO2 and eventually dominate the entire cycle process, which will significantly extend the cycle life of β-MnO2/Mn3O4 composite materials.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the hydrothermal method united with a subsequent annealing treatment is employed to synthesize carbon-coated mesoporous composite manganese oxide nanotubes. The β-MnO2 nanotubes are directly prepared by the hydrothermal method. The Mn3O4 nanotubes are formed from the deoxidation of β-MnO2 nanotubes in Ar and this process is controlled by the C-coating. The C-coating inhibits the deoxidation reaction, making β-MnO2 partially deoxidize to form β-MnO2/Mn3O4 composite nanotubes. The carbon coated β-MnO2/Mn3O4 mesoporous nanotubes exhibit excellent electrochemical properties, which are attributed to three advantages, namely, suitable structures containing mesoporous and nanotube structures, the abundant chemical composition of MnO2 and Mn3O4, and the C-coating used as the conductive agent and the buffer layer. In addition, there is a unique multiple phase transitions regulation phenomenon in the β-MnO2/Mn3O4 composite materials, which significantly extends the cycle life of β-MnO2/Mn3O4 composite materials. This unique preparation method of nanoscale composite oxide material as well as hierarchical architecture design is expected to provide a new strategy for other anode materials for LIBs.
