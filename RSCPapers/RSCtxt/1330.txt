    , Accepted 5th April 2015First published on 13th April 2015AbstractTiO2 is an exemplary semiconductor anode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting electrodes due to its functionality, long-term stability in corrosive environments, nontoxicity, and low cost. In this study, TiO2 photoanodes with enhanced photocurrent density were synthesized by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2 onto a porous, transparent, and conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide nanoparticle (nanoFTO) scaffold fabricated by solution processing. The simplicity and disordered nature of the nanoFTO nanostructure combined with the ultrathin conformal ALD TiO2 coatings offers advantages including decoupling charge carrier diffusion length from optical penetration depth, increased photon absorption probability through scattering, complimentary photon absorption, and favorable interfaces for charge separation and transfer across the various junctions. We examine the effects of porosity of the nanoFTO scaffold and thickness of the TiO2 coating on PEC performance and achieve an optimal photocurrent of 0.7 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G irradiation in a 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, the fundamental mechanisms behind the improvements are characterized via cyclic voltammetry, incident photon-to-current efficiency, transient photocurrent spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and are contrasted with those of single crystal rutile TiO2 nanowires. The strategies employed in this work highlight the opportunities inherent to these types of heteronanostructures, where the lessons may be applied to improve the PEC conversion efficiencies of other promising semiconductors, such as hematite (α-Fe2O3) and other materials more sensitive to visible light.
1. Introduction
The direct use of sunlight as the electromotive force driving the electrolysis of water is a process known as photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Given the renewable nature and abundance of solar energy, this PEC process is considered to be the “holy grail” of achieving an economically sustainable and environmentally friendly hydrogen production system.1 In addition, the storability of hydrogen fuels curbs the intermittency issues intrinsic to the sun's diurnal cycle. This PEC process is made possible when a semiconductor material2 comes into contact with an aqueous electrolyte and causes a depletion region to be created within the semiconductor, forming the semiconductor-liquid junction (SCLJ). The corresponding band bending can drive the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes so that they may undergo the chemical reactions of water oxidation at the anode (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and water reduction at the cathode (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER), respectively.3,4 The HER and OER reactions on the cathode and anode in an alkaline environment are shown in eqn (1) and (2), respectively. 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−(1) 4OH− + 4h+ → O2 + 2H2O(2)
One intrinsic n-type semiconductor material that meets the proper valence and conduction band edge position requirements for the OER is titanium dioxide (TiO2). Since 1972,5 TiO2 has shown great potential as an exemplary PEC material since it consists of earth-abundant elements, is considered non-toxic, and it is highly stable in a variety of aqueous electrolytes.
Most of the recent approaches to optimizing PEC performance of TiO2 have deviated from traditional photonic systems with planar morphologies and moved towards employing porous 3-dimensional (3D) nanostructures to enhance the functionality of the PEC devices. The large electrochemically active SCLJ surface area from a 3D porous electrode provides a large contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode, which enables the usage of a larger portion of the electrode materials to enhance the throughput of the kinetically sluggish OER. Moreover, loading TiO2 onto a 3D conductive scaffold can decouple the required thickness for efficient light absorption from the minority charge carrier diffusion length and thereby avoid significant recombination of the photogenerated electron/hole pairs. Recent approaches have utilized various conductive 3D nanostructured scaffolds, including Si nanowires,6 TiSi2 nanonets,7 carbon nanotubes,8 and even single crystal rutile TiO2 nanowires9 to support TiO2 for the synthesis of TiO2 anodes. However, many of these approaches suffer from the fact that the supporting scaffolds are expensive to fabricate and may compete with TiO2 for the absorption of photons.
To circumvent these problems, our nanostructuring approach utilizes solution-processed 3D mesoporous scaffold made of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) nanoparticles. The TCO's wide bandgap makes the nanoparticles less likely to compete with the photoactive semiconductor layer. Most recently, Peng et al. demonstrated the potential of this approach for the synthesis of TiO2 PEC electrodes by coating antimony-doped tin oxide nanoparticles (nanoATO) with TiO2 by atomic layer deposition (ALD).10 In this study, we demonstrate that additional PEC performance enhancements can be achieved when solution-processed fluorine-doped tin oxide nanoparticles (nanoFTO) are used as the porous TCO scaffold for supporting ALD TiO2 films. FTO is one of the most commonly used TCOs in optoelectronic applications due to its thermal stability over a wide temperature window and is thus attractive as a mesoporous scaffold. We characterized the TiO2-coated nanoFTO photoanodes (TiO2/nanoFTO) by cyclic voltammetry, incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and transient photocurrent analysis. Importantly, we find that despite the simplicity and disordered nature of the TiO2/nanoFTO core–shell nanostructure, an extremely effective PEC photoelectrode is created due to the intrinsic benefits of using ultrathin TiO2 core–shell coatings and the specific surface properties inherent to ALD TiO2. Additional advantages from this particular heterostructure include complimentary photon adsorption from FTO and TiO2 and a favorable interface for charge separation and transport.
2. Results & discussion
2.1. Materials synthesis and characterization
The self-limiting cyclic layer-by-layer growth mode of ALD enables coating of high aspect ratio nanostructures with angstrom-level thickness precision, conformality, and uniformity. This makes ALD an ideal tool to maximize the performance of the TiO2/nanoFTO heteronanostructure studied herein. The concept behind using ALD to deposit TiO2 thin films over the nanoFTO scaffold to construct a PEC photoanode is illustrated in Fig. 1. Given that the absorption coefficient of polycrystalline TiO2 for a 370 nm photon is roughly 1.2 μm,11 a colloidal nanoFTO film with a total thickness of roughly 2 μm was spin-coated onto a planar FTO glass substrate in order to ensure ample absorption of photons with energies larger than 3.0 eV (bandgap of rutile TiO2). The resulting nanoFTO scaffold consists of a porous network of nanoparticles with diameters spanning 100–300 nm. It is expected that the disorder of the nanoFTO scaffold will promote optical scattering effects within the bulk of the film, thus enhancing the light harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 coatings that serve as the principal photoactive component for PEC water oxidation.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram illustrating the light trapping and charge carrier separation mechanisms for the TiO2/nanoFTO architecture, where a thin film of TiO2 (orange) is coated over a conductive network of nanoFTO (green). On the left, a region is shown where the TiO2 film causes some pores within the network to become closed, thus preventing an electrochemically active SCLJ from being within reach of photogenerated holes. 
TiO2 films with thicknesses ranging from 5–20 nm were deposited onto nanoFTO substrates and their resulting chemical composition was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 2 shows XPS spectra of a 10 nm TiO2-coated nanoFTO (TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO) sample, which is also representative of the other samples in this study. The survey scan in Fig. 2a shows TiO2 with the presence of N (0.5 at%), C (13.1 at%), and Si (2.2 at%) contaminants. The N and C species can be attributed to the N2 carrier gas used during ALD12,13 and adventitious carbon, respectively. The presence of small concentrations of Si is likely due to the contamination from sample handling and is not expected to contribute to PEC performance. The lack of detection of Sn peaks indicates that a conformal coating of TiO2 with minimal pinholes was achieved near the surface of the nanoFTO network. Fig. 2b displays the Ti 2p triplet region of the spectrum, whose Ti 2p3/2 peak maximum near 538.4 eV confirms the presence of a Ti4+ oxidation state, which further confirmed the presence of TiO2.14 Similar spectra were observed for TiO2/nanoFTO samples with different TiO2 coating thicknesses of 5 nm–20 nm, which suggests that 5 nm TiO2 was able to conformally cover the nanoFTO substrates.

To analyze the crystal structure of TiO2 ALD coatings onto the nanoFTO structure, Raman spectroscopy was performed on TiO2/nanoFTO with various thicknesses of TiO2. Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of nanoFTO (cassiterite crystalline phase) and nanoFTO coated with 5, 10, and 20 nm of TiO2. All the TiO2/nanoFTO samples show strong Raman modes near 242 cm−1, 440 cm−1, and 610 cm−1, which are the three strongest Raman bands associated with the rutile polymorph of TiO2.15 As anatase TiO2 is the usual polymorph at this low growth temperature,16 we attribute this preferential rutile formation to the underlying cassiterite lattice structure of the nanoFTO, which is from the rutile family and possesses similar lattice constants as rutile TiO2. This is consistent with recent studies that show a preferential formation of rutile TiO2via ALD when deposited on rutile-like substrates at low growth temperatures.10,17,18 Interestingly, as the film thickness increases, a small peak corresponding to the major anatase TiO2 Raman band near 143 cm−1 starts to be detected, as shown by the TiO2(20 nm)/nanoFTO sample. This suggests that although our polycrystalline TiO2 material consists mostly of the rutile phase, some TiO2 crystals with the anatase phase might also be present in small concentrations.
 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of an uncoated nanoFTO sample compared to those coated with a 5, 10, and 20 nm TiO2 film. The peaks corresponding to the anatase TiO2, rutile TiO2, and cassiterite FTO structure are denoted by the letter-labels A, R, and F, respectively. 

Fig. 4 contains scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) of TiO2/nanoFTO samples as the TiO2 coating thickness is increased. The plain-view SEMs in Fig. 4a–c show the transition from the wide distribution of open pores (dark regions) provided by the uncoated nanoFTO scaffold (Fig. 4a) to the sample with the thickest TiO2 film (Fig. 4c), where the density of visible pores has been drastically reduced. In contrast, the TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO sample displayed in Fig. 4b shows an intermediate state where the smallest pores may have been filled but the larger pores remain. The cross-sectional perspective in Fig. 4d, shows the larger pore channels through which the TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO photoelectrode maintained electrolyte accessibility throughout the depth of the nanostructure.

2.2. Photoelectrochemical performance

2.2.1. Photocurrent optimization. 

Fig. 5 displays the photocurrent density (J) as a function of the applied potential versus an Ag/AgCl (KCl saturated) reference electrode (EAg/AgCl) and was obtained by performing linear cyclic voltammetry scans on TiO2/nanoFTO photoelectrodes with a range of TiO2 thickness. The consistent diode-like shape (or fill factor) across all of the photocurrent responses plotted in Fig. 5a confirms the conformal coverage of the ALD TiO2 coating over the entire surface area of the underlying nanoFTO. In addition, the cathodic peak observed at EAg/AgCl = −0.9 V corresponds to the oxygen reduction reaction resulting from ineffective purging of the recently evolved O2 within the mesoporous nanostructure. Fig. 5a shows that the TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO produces a photocurrent density of 0.7 mA cm−2 at EAg/AgCl = 0 V. This is the maximum J observed among various TiO2 film thicknesses and can henceforth be considered to be the optimal thickness for this particular nanostructure. This value represents an almost fourfold enhancement over the recently reported values for planar ALD TiO2/FTO and is even higher than the 0.58 mA cm−2 photocurrent density value which was recently observed with nanoATO.10Fig. 5b summarizes the J–EAg/AgCl data in order to help to visualize the effect of thickness on photocurrent. At thicknesses less than 10 nm, there is a high surface area in contact with the electrolyte, allowing a large concentration of reactive sites to be available for the OER. However, there is not enough TiO2 to absorb and convert most of the incident photons, which is evidenced by the Incident Photon-to-Current Efficiency (IPCE) measurements presented in the following section. As the thickness increases to 10 nm, the smaller pores may begin to be filled (as shown in the SEM from Fig. 4). However, any detrimental effects on PEC performance caused by a decrease in active surface area are likely outweighed by a boost in light absorption from the higher loading density of the photoactive TiO2 coating (Fig. S3†). As the thickness of TiO2 coatings becomes larger than 10 nm, the majority of the pores become filled which causes a sharp drop in photocurrent. The filling of larger pores reduces the active surface area and increases the hole transport lengths, counteracting the benefit of adding photoactive TiO2. These competing contributions account for the leveling off of J. Thereafter, J is expected to continue to decrease as the last pores become filled in a manner similar to a previous study.10 As for the stability of these samples, within the roughly 30 minute time period required for most experiments, no obvious degradation of the photocurrent is observed for any of the TiO2/nanoFTO samples. Even more, the J–EAg/AgCl curves from a TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO sample that had been stored in air and then retested periodically in 1 M KOH over the course of approximately 1 year displayed no significant signs of degradation (Fig. S4†).

(b) Photocurrent densities measured at EAg/AgCl = 0 V of TiO2/nanoFTO samples as a function of TiO2 thickness. 


2.2.2. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE). 
IPCE measurements were conducted on the photoelectrodes to gain additional insight into the wavelength-dependent photon absorbance, carrier separation, charge transport, and interfacial charge transfer mechanisms related to the total photocurrents observed above. IPCE spectra of various samples and a schematic of the corresponding mechanisms are shown in Fig. 6. The IPCE spectra displayed in Fig. 6a were collected at EAg/AgCl = 0, thus characterizing the mechanisms behind the photocurrents observed in Fig. 5b. As expected from the data above, the TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO IPCE curve shows the highest overall efficiencies. The IPCE curve of TiO2(7.5 nm)/nanoFTO closely matched the IPCE behavior of the TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO sample at wavelengths (λ) less than 380 nm, but its values are smaller at wavelengths longer than 380 nm. The smaller IPCE at these longer wavelengths accounts for the lower total photocurrent performance of TiO2(7.5 nm)/nanoFTO in comparison with TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO (Fig. 5a), despite the fact that the overall area under each IPCE curve is similar for both samples. This is because of a much higher weighting factor for photons near 400 nm in the simulated solar spectrum (AM 1.5 G) than the photons with shorter wavelengths deeper into the UV region.19
 Fig. 6  (a) IPCE spectra of nanoFTO with and without ALD TiO2 coating samples collected at EAg/AgCl = 0 with 1 Sun AM 1.5 illumination; (b) schematic band diagram depicting the heterojunction at the interface between a nanometer FTO particle and TiO2. The band bending between TiO2 and FTO heterojunction favors the separation and transport of photogenerated charges. 
It is also important to note the relatively high IPCE efficiencies obtained for the higher energy UV photons (below 350 nm wavelengths) in all the TiO2/nanoFTO electrodes. For other reported TiO2-based nanostructured photoelectrodes, the IPCE values peak and then decrease dramatically as the wavelengths decrease.17,20 As an example, we confirmed this behavior for 1.8 μm TiO2 nanowires (NWs) on planar FTO glass, which show IPCE values that peak around 380 nm and decrease sharply at shorter wavelengths (Fig. S1†). This is due to a larger recombination ratio for photoelectrons excited by shorter wavelength, which tend to be generated near the tips of the nanowires and thus have a high probability of recombining as they are transported throughout the micrometer-long NWs. However, such behavior is not the case here for the TiO2-coated nanoFTO electrodes; the high IPCE values are sustained down to a wavelength of 300 nm. We attribute this efficient behavior to the unique ALD TiO2/nanoFTO hetero-nanostructure.
The underlying nanoFTO support plays several roles here. First, the high electron conductivity of the FTO nanoparticles decreases the transport time needed for electrons to reach the collecting electrode. When this is combined with the short distance that holes photogenerated within the thin TiO2 coating need to travel before reaching the SCLJ, the high electron conductivity decreases the recombination rate of the electron–hole pairs. This is especially important for the electron–hole pairs that are generated from high-energy photons, since they will be absorbed near the top surface of the electrode due to their large absorption cross-section.17,20 Second, nanoFTO will transmit or scatter photons with energy smaller than 3.5 eV. Although this means that it will not compete with TiO2 for the absorption of photons with energies between 3.0–3.5 eV, the absorbance of such photons within thin TiO2 coatings (≤20 nm) is normally very small. However, due to the 3D morphology of the nanoFTO scaffold, the probability that the TiO2 coating will absorb these photons will be dramatically increased as they scatter and propagate through the tortuous pathway inside the TiO2-coated FTO nanoparticles. Third, the IPCE spectrum of nanoFTO without ALD coating indicates that the nanoFTO support will absorb photons with energies greater than 3.5 eV (λ < 350 nm) and convert them into useful electron–hole pairs. Based on the respective positions of the conduction and valence band edges of FTO and TiO2, a type II heterojunction is formed between FTO and TiO2 that promotes charge transport across the semiconductor junction in the desired directions for the OER.21 The approximately 40% IPCE values imply that the nanoFTO is not only absorbing a large number of the incident photons with λ < 350 nm, but is also helping to separate the photogenerated carriers efficiently at the heterojunction with TiO2. We postulate that an additional reason for this rapid charge separation may be due to the reported intermixing of the electronic structure of FTO and TiO2 near the heterojunction, which may cause a small potential distribution to be felt near this interface.22 In addition, it is possible that the complete depletion of the ultrathin TiO2 coating at EAg/AgCl = 0 may cause the total width of any depletion layer (WD,Total = WD,FTO + WD,TiO2) to extend a small distance into the nanoFTO structure. The strength of the electric field (amount of band bending) within TiO2 is expected to be small due to the ultrathin dimensions of the ALD TiO2 coatings.23 Although there have been reports of small scale band bending inducing the photooxidation of water on TiO2,24 we ascribe most of the charge separation within our ALD TiO2 films to their long diffusion lengths (10–100 nm)25–27 by which they will reach the SCLJ and become rapidly scavenged by the OH−/O2 redox-driven free energy gradient on the surface.28 On the other hand, within the nanoFTO, the formation of the depletion layer might provide the electric field required to efficiently separate the photogenerated charges (Fig. 6b). This kind of extension of the depletion layer into the underlying TCO material has been reported for anatase TiO2 thin films on tin-doped indium oxide.29 In summary, the combined effects of these above-mentioned mechanisms help produce the unique IPCE behavior of these ALD TiO2/nanoFTO nanostructured photoanodes.


2.2.3. Characterization of recombination mechanisms. 
To help further understand the charge transfer mechanisms of the TiO2/nanoFTO samples, we analyzed their transient photocurrent behavior from chopped illumination and contrasted it with the performance of a sample of hydrothermally-grown rutile TiO2NW/FTO with similar photocurrents (Fig. 7). The measurement of these non-steady state photocurrents can be used to study recombination mechanisms since the characteristic relaxation time for minority carriers trapped in surface states or accumulated near the surface is slow enough to be detected experimentally.30
 Fig. 7  A comparison of the transient photocurrents resulting from hand-chopped light on TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO and single crystal rutile TiO2 NWs on FTO glass, both during a (a) linear sweep voltammogram and (b) chronoamperometry test at EAg/AgCl = −0.8 V. 

Fig. 7a shows the similar levels of total photocurrent performance for both of these samples under chopped illumination as well as a saturation of photocurrent transient effects as a function of additional negative bias. Since the photocurrent transient effects are more pronounced near the onset of photocurrent, we chose to compare their transient behavior during an amperometric scan conducted at a constant potential of EAg/AgCl = −0.8 V. This low band-bending region is expected to highlight the recombination due to the accumulation of holes and surface states, and not be subject to the effect of photon flux.31 The symmetry of the anodic and cathodic transients observed for each sample indicated that both samples suffered from these recombination mechanisms. However, the drastically larger transient peak current feature observed from the TiO2 NW sample indicates a loss of a significantly higher fraction of photogenerated charges32 than the ALD TiO2/nanoFTO sample. The dramatic difference in charge transfer mechanisms between TiO2/nanoFTO and rutile NWs is also highlighted by their different impedance response under EIS, whose Nyquist plot shows an additional charge transfer (semicircular) feature at low frequencies only for the rutile NWs (Fig. S2†). This indicates that the surface of the ALD TiO2 allows more facile charge transfer across the SCLJ.33,34
In highly alkaline 1 M KOH, two possibilities have been previously proposed as explanations for the faster surface hydroxide-driven reaction kinetics35 observed on certain rutile TiO2 materials. The two possibilities are (i) the presence of multiple rutile crystal facets, and (ii) a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies on the film's surface.36 Both of these are possible given the polycrystalline and defective growth mechanism inherent to ALD. However, a more intriguing possibility is the generation of more peroxide (H2O2) species generated only near the surface31 which serve as hole scavengers37 and thus accelerate the OER.32 Given the slightly more negative redox potential for OH−/H2O2 than OER,21 such peroxides could be generated more easily if “hot holes” reached the surface before having time to relax down to the valence band edge by thermalization. However, assuming that the thermalization time is just under 100 ps for n-TiO238 and that the hole transit time through a full depletion layer is less than 40 ps,21 it may be possible that the efficient collection and utilization of the deep UV photons by the TiO2/nanoFTO photoelectrodes could be yielding such behavior. This may be even more likely for the nanoFTO system, given the ultrathin nature of the ALD TiO2 films that would result in even shorter theoretical hole transit times. Although the feasibility of such behavior is still under some debate, there have been some reports claiming that it can be sustained across the SCLJ using oxide-covered metallic electrodes.39,40

3. Conclusion
We have shown that the ALD TiO2/nanoFTO nanostructure resulted in a photoanode with impressive light harvesting efficiency for the photooxidation of water. In particular, the high IPCE efficiencies of TiO2/nanoFTO throughout their materials’ respective absorption regions provide insights for future development of tandem heteronanostructures for applications in PEC conversion and solar cells. Moreover, the photocurrent transient behavior indicates charge transfer mechanisms on the surface of these nanostructures is extremely efficient and could be a property inherent to these ultrathin ALD films. Given the large junction area that is responsible for the photocurrent enhancement, future work should be done to characterize the specific electronic properties and chemical bonding structure near the interface between the ALD TiO2 and the nanoFTO, as it is possible that the d orbital occupancy has been modified near this transition metal oxide interface.22 We expect that future applications could exploit the beneficial effects observed herein to further improve the PEC conversion efficiencies of other promising materials such as hematite (α-Fe2O3).
4. Experimental methods
4.1. Synthesis of nanoFTO-coated substrates
FTO nanopowder (3 g, Keeling and Walker, 0.1–0.3 microns, BET surface area 10–15 m2) was added to 200 proof ethanol (10 ml) to make a suspension of nanoFTO as discussed previously.41 The application of nanoFTO onto 12 mm × 50 mm FTO-coated Soda lime glass (Hartford Glass, 15 ohm per sq) was accomplished by spin-coating the nanoFTO suspension according to earlier procedures.10,42 Finally, the approximately 2 μm thick layer of nanoFTO was sintered at 450 °C for 2 hours before the ALD process.
4.2. Atomic layer deposition (ALD)
The TiO2 films were deposited on the nanoFTO-coated substrates described above by a “homemade” hot-wall viscous flow ALD reactor operated at 300 °C. The reactor was kept at process pressure of 1.42 Torr under a constant 300 sccm flow of UHP nitrogen (Airgas Inc.) as a carrier and purging gas. TiCl4 and deionized H2O were used as the metal precursor and the co-reactant, respectively, for the TiO2 ALD process. All precursors were held at the temperature of ∼40 °C. The time sequence of the recipe used was 1.5/5 and 1.5/5 s for the TiCl4 dose/purge and H2O dose/purge, respectively. Prior to growth, substrates were blown dry with UHP nitrogen before loading them into the ALD chamber. During each growth run, p-type Si (100) substrates covered with a native oxide layer were placed along the length of the reactor as the control samples to monitor the film thickness. Film thickness was measured by using a J.A. Woollam M-88 Variable Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometer at scan angles ranging from 65–75° and a polarizer angle of 20°. These thicknesses corresponded to the thickness of the films deposited on the nanoFTO glass substrates since the growth rate has been shown to be the same on Si as on FTO.43 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, and 20 nm TiO2 films were deposited using 120, 171, 225, 270, 318, and 410 ALD cycles, respectively. The measured growth rate was approximately 0.5 Å per cycle.
4.3. Material characterization
The chemical compositions of TiO2 films were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Kratos Analytical Axis Ultra equipped with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source operated at an emission current of 10 mA with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Pass energies of 20 eV and 160 eV were used for regional and survey scans, respectively. The step sizes were 0.1 eV and 1 eV for the regional and survey scans, respectively. All XPS spectra were processed with CasaXPS software, and were calibrated to an adventitious carbon peak near 284.6 eV. The crystallinity of the films was characterized by Raman spectroscopy via an Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRam ARAMIS Raman microscope with a 633 nm He/Ne laser. The morphologies of samples were imaged using an FEI XL30 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) under a high-resolution mode with electron beam energy of 15 kV. Lastly, optical measurements from the TiO2/nanoFTO nanostructure were collected at UNC-Chapel Hill using a Cary 5000 UV-Vis spectrometer with the DRA-2500 internal integrating sphere accessory. Using a planar FTO sample as the blank for reference, reflectance and transmittance data were measured in order to calculate the amount of absorption plus scattering (that couldn't be accounted for by the integrated sphere) taking place in our samples according to the formula 100 − T − R = A + S, where T is the total transmittance, R is the total reflectance, A is the absorption, and S is the unaccounted scattered light.
4.4. PEC performance characterization
All electrical connections were made by scratching the ALD film to expose part of the underlying FTO surface. The scratched region was then rubbed with InGa eutectic metal (Sigma-Aldrich, 495425) in order to ensure an ohmic contact with low resistance between the FTO coating on the glass and the flattened end of a bare Cu wire used as the electrode lead. This contact region was then sealed with a nonconductive epoxy (Hysol 9460, Loctitte) and left to cure for at least two hours. In order to isolate all non-semiconductor (inactive) components from the electrolyte, the rest of the length copper wire was fed through a quartz glass tube (Ace Glass, O.D. 6 mm) and the active planar PEC area was defined by covering all inactive regions of each sample with the same nonconductive epoxy resin. Electrochemical activity was measured using a Bio-Logic SP-200 potentiostat. An Oriel 150 W Xe Arc lamp with an AM 1.5 G filter was used as the light source with the calibrated power of 100 mW cm−2 on the sample surface. All measurements were performed with a 1 M KOH electrolyte and under a constant flow of Ar as the sparging gas, via a standard three-electrode configuration with a Pt mesh as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (saturated in KCl) reference electrode (0.198 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). To measure the basic photoresponse, cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans were taken at a voltage sweep rate of 20 mV s−1. The photocurrent density was then obtained by dividing the photocurrent by the photoactive area of the electrode, which was measured through scale-marked photos via Image-J. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed under both dark and light conditions. The amplitude of the sinusoidal voltage was 10 mV and it was applied across a frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 mHz. Mott–Schottky analyses were derived from the EIS measurements at the frequency of 1 kHz. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) data was collected at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl using a customized Newport-Oriel system powered by a 300 W Xe (Ozone-free) lamp equipped with a Cornerstone 130 1/8 M Monochromator. The irradiance was measured with a power meter (Newport 1918-R) adjusted to the calibrated photoresponse of a standard silicon photodetector.
4.5. Rutile TiO2 nanowire synthesis
The hydrothermal synthesis procedure of TiO2 nanowires on a FTO glass substrate is similar as the literature report. The reaction solution was made by mixing 5 ml concentrated HCl (ACS, ∼37%,) with 5 ml de-ionized (DI) water, followed by addition of 0.16 ml of titanium butoxide (Reagent Grade, Sigma Aldrich). The solution was stirred for 10 min before transferred into a hydrothermal autoclave reactor, which has a volume of 20 ml. A cleaned FTO glass substrate, which was sonicated in soap water, DI water, ethanol, and DI water sequentially, was then leaned against the wall of the Teflon lined autoclave with the FTO coated surface facing downwards. The sealed autoclave was then transferred into a furnace and sit in the furnace for 2 h at 200 °C. After the reaction, DI water was used to cool down the autoclave to room temperature before open it. Then the FTO substrate coated with uniform pale white film of TiO2 nanowire (NW) was recovered and rinsed thoroughly by DI water, and dried in air. The synthesized TiO2NW/FTO samples were then annealed in air at 500 °C for 2 h before assembled into a testable electrode.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic diagram illustrating the light trapping and charge carrier separation mechanisms for the TiO2/nanoFTO architecture, where a thin film of TiO2 (orange) is coated over a conductive network of nanoFTO (green). On the left, a region is shown where the TiO2 film causes some pores within the network to become closed, thus preventing an electrochemically active SCLJ from being within reach of photogenerated holes.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) XPS survey spectrum and (b) corresponding Ti 2p regional spectrum collected from a TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO sample.	 

 	Fig. 3  Raman spectra of an uncoated nanoFTO sample compared to those coated with a 5, 10, and 20 nm TiO2 film. The peaks corresponding to the anatase TiO2, rutile TiO2, and cassiterite FTO structure are denoted by the letter-labels A, R, and F, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Top-down SEM images displaying the evolution of topological porosity from (a) pristine/uncoated, (b) 10 nm TiO2, and (c) 20 nm TiO2 nanoFTO samples. The inset figures are the regions on the samples under higher magnifications. (d) Cross-sectional SEM image of a TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO sample displaying pore channels inside of the film.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Cyclic voltammograms taken at a sweep rate of 20 mV s−1 of TiO2/nanoFTO samples with a range of TiO2 thicknesses (colored lines) under ∼1 sun of AM 1.5 G irradiation and under dark condition (black line). (b) Photocurrent densities measured at EAg/AgCl = 0 V of TiO2/nanoFTO samples as a function of TiO2 thickness.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) IPCE spectra of nanoFTO with and without ALD TiO2 coating samples collected at EAg/AgCl = 0 with 1 Sun AM 1.5 illumination; (b) schematic band diagram depicting the heterojunction at the interface between a nanometer FTO particle and TiO2. The band bending between TiO2 and FTO heterojunction favors the separation and transport of photogenerated charges.	 

 	Fig. 7  A comparison of the transient photocurrents resulting from hand-chopped light on TiO2(10 nm)/nanoFTO and single crystal rutile TiO2 NWs on FTO glass, both during a (a) linear sweep voltammogram and (b) chronoamperometry test at EAg/AgCl = −0.8 V.
