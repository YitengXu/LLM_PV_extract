    , Accepted 15th September 2022First published on 26th September 2022AbstractTelomerase is an enzyme that protects the length of telomeres by adding guanine-rich repetitive sequences. In tumors, gametes, and stem cells, telomerase activity is exerted. Telomerase activity can be a cancer biomarker for therapeutic and diagnosis approaches. So, a number of studies concentrating on the discovery of telomerase activity were reported. Bioanalytical devices, in comparison with other tests, have numerous advantages including low expense, simplicity, and excellent sensitivity and specificity. In this article we reviewed recent studies on the subject of various bioanalytical methods based on different nanomaterials. Optical, electrochemical, and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) are prominent analytical techniques that are mentioned in this paper.
1 Introduction
Telomeres are repeatable (TTAGGG) DNA–protein complexes placed at the eukaryotic chromosome ends. They protect the eukaryotic chromosome linear ends against fusion and degradation, and also maintain genome stability.1 In humans, the double-stranded (ds) telomere track length is around 10–15 kb. The telomeres activity decreased and cannot be replicated by the replication fork lagging strand during the division of somatic cells.2 They include a repetitive non-coding DNA sequence (TTAGGG repeats in vertebrates) bound up in a multi-protein complex. Moreover, the telomere complex includes long noncoding RNA transcribed from telomeric repetitive DNA (TERRA) and a currently recognized component that is essential for the maintenance of a functional telomere structure.3 Telomeres are substrates for telomerase that is a DNA polymerase, and have a role in elongation of telomeres.4 The shortening of telomeres to a crucial length can cause programmed cell death. Telomerase is an enzyme that has a role in protecting the length of telomeres through adding guanine-rich repetitive sequences. The telomerase complex binds with an oligonucleotide or a telomere that adds de novo repeats to the 3 ends of the telomere and synthesizes a short DNA fragment. Then, telomerase moves to the telomeric end (translocation) and, a DNA fragment is again synthesized.5 In most various types of normal somatic cells, the reverse transcriptase activity of telomerase is silenced, except in some T-cells and stem-like cells.6,7 High-regulating telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression and increasing telomerase activity are the main factors for developing cancers and telomerase activity has been demonstrated in ∼90% of cancers.8 High expression of telomerase is an almost universal feature across various cancer types, and the measurement of telomerase is an important subject in both detection and therapeutics of cancers. So, telomerase suppression is an interesting, broad-spectrum therapeutic target for cancer treatment. The sensing method for detection of telomerase activity is determined by the unique G-rich tail, nucleotide sequence, and ample negative charges of the tandem repeats.9 Also, there are three main mechanisms for telomerase activity detection namely the hybridization-based mechanism, electronegativity-based mechanism and G-rich tail-based mechanism. Biosensors are analytical technologies that selectively respond to targets in various samples while converting their concentration into an electrical signal by combining biological recognition systems such as electrochemical, optical, or piezoelectric biosensors. In this review, we focused on new research studies on biosensor systems for telomerase activity detection.
2 Methods for detecting telomerase activity
As mentioned, many study results on the correlation between cancer development and telomerase activity have aroused more interest among researchers in exploring telomerase as an appropriate target for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Telomerase activity is observed in the most prevalent cancers such as breast, lung, prostate, liver and colon.10–12 PCR-based methods for evaluating telomerase activity have been expanded by using an enhanced detergent lysis technique to cause a more uniform extraction of telomerase from fewer cells.13 A telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) technique was reported in 1994 to measure telomerase activity.14 In this method, non-telomeric sequences are utilized as a substrate and telomerase extends the substrate primer (TS) and this process can amplify specific sequence through the PCR with a reverse primer.15 Evidence has been shown that the TRAP can be useful as a potential diagnostic method for cancer. Conventional TRAP tools need polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for autoradiography of the amplified products, and other limitations including not easily quantitated, time-consuming, and using radioactive labels, have limited their use in clinics.16 The real-time quantitative TRAP (Q-TRAP) and capillary electrophoresis-TRAP are advanced methods that were created to overcome some disadvantages of the traditional TRAP. However, these two techniques are high cost, complex and not fast.17 Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT or hTERT) and human telomerase RNA (hTR/hTER/TERC) are the necessary components of telomerase. RNAscope is a new in situ hybridization (ISH) assay for detecting the target RNA in terms of the Advanced Cell Diagnostics – patented probe design.18 RNAscope is able to perform multiplex detection of more than four target genes (restricted by the number of fluorescent dyes discernible spectrally).19 Baltzarsen et al.19 employed RNAscope for the detection of hTERT mRNA. This method is appropriate for identifying specific mRNA but has some disadvantages such as the need for crosslinking fixatives and many steps to be taken with precise optimization for each tissue.20 One of the methods is capillary electrophoresis (CE). This technique is a highly sensitive and high resolution method that is often applied to nucleic acid detection.21 Microchip electrophoresis is used as a high-throughput analysis and is better than CE in terms of time-consumption. Karasawa et al.22 have detected telomerase activity by microchip electrophoresis employing a novel mixed gel and SYBR gold fluorescent dye. This tool is cheaper, easier, and faster than TRAP. Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is chemiluminescence generated by electrochemical techniques. This method is included in our immunoassays to prepare the light signal used to evaluate important factors and molecules and is also an appropriate tool for analytical applications as a highly selective and sensitive approach.23 El-Shalakany and his colleagues23 have shown that immunohistochemical discovery of positive telomerase expression is correlated with the development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Different biosensors such as electrochemical, optical and piezoelectric are bioanalytical devices for telomerase activity detection. In recent years, biosensors or genosensors have been developed for various biomarker detection, because of some of their attractive features including simple operation, not being expensive, high specificity and sensitivity.
3 Bioanalytical systems
Most of the above-mentioned approaches for telomerase activity detection have important disadvantages, such as complications, time-consuming, expensive instrumentation, unsuitable for point-of-care diagnosis, and label-required.24 Biosensors contain a transducer with a biorecognition element and hence are suitable for directly transforming a biochemical event on the transducer surface into a measurable signal. A biosensor is an analytical tool that is made up of biological elements containing organelles, cell receptors, microorganisms, antibodies, nucleic acids, enzymes, etc.25,26 Biosensors have been developed in many studies, for example, biomolecule detection for pathogen diagnosis, medical monitoring, and measurement of toxins in food and water. The specific and sensitive materials in a biosensor are immobilized onto the transducers' surface, and they can interact with target factors without adding any reagents to the sample solution. Today, there are many methods for biosensing, such as electrochemical, optical, piezoelectric, thermometric, or magnetic.27 Each of these types of biosensors can detect different markers according to their unique characteristics.
3.1 Current advancements in electrochemical biosensors based on nanoparticles for telomerase activity detection
Electrochemical biosensors are uniquely designed to meet all the needs for flexible biosensor development. Three integrated components are necessary in an electrochemical biosensor to prepare a biosensor: (a) a signal transducer to create a measurable signal from the bimolecular-target specific interaction; (b) a biorecognition element for specific interaction with the analyte and (c) an electronic system for data management.28 Electrochemical biosensors offer many features, including low cost, the requirement of only small volumes of target factors and reagents, high specificity, simplicity, and short evaluation times29 (Table 1).

Magnetic beads can be employed to manipulate biological materials, including proteins, microorganisms, cells, and nucleic acids. Using magnetic beads in electrochemical biosensors can prevent false-negative results from DNA polymerase inhibitors in cell lysates.30 For telomerase activity detection, an electrochemical sensing device based on magnetic beads can improve the sensor sensitivity via exonuclease III-aided target recycling amplification. The extended telomeric repeats can hybridize with the complementary probe, which provides exonuclease III for recognizing the latter once the hybrid product is formed30 (Fig. 1). This biosensor device prevents complex modification and false negatives or immobilization procedures because it is carried out in a homogeneous solution after magnetic purification. Moreover, this method holds excellent potential as a sensitive and highly specific device for early-stage cancer detection and telomerase activity detection in various samples. Liposomes, as artificial vesicles built of lipid bilayers possess attractive features for use in biosensors as signal amplifiers, and these vesicles can be selected as a good candidate factor for biosensors to intensify signals.44 Moreover, carbon nanotubes are widely used in modifying electrodes due to their increasing sensitivity and excellent conductivity.45 Alizadeh et al.31 have constructed a glassy carbon electrode modified with carbon nanotubes and telomerase reaction products immobilized on a streptavidin-coated microplate while hybridizing with biotinylated capture probes. Biotinylated liposomes loaded with dopamine are added to streptavidin and biotinylated capture probes. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) can detect telomerase activity in the 10 cultured cancer cells. The appropriate operation of the biosensor was attributed to (1) two steps for signal amplification and (2) the high sensitivity of the electrochemical technique. This nano-based and liposomal biosensor was low cost, PCR-free, simple in function, enzyme-free, and highly sensitive, which makes it possible to evaluate the telomerase activity of cell extracts for future clinical research.

3.1.1 Electrochemical biosensors with various nanomaterials. 
Enzymes are nanometer-sized molecules with 3D structures composed of the self-assembly and folding of polymeric chain-like components by supramolecular interactions.46 Recently, enzyme mimics or artificial enzymes have been fabricated because of adjustable enzymatic activity and low cost of synthesis, in comparison with natural enzymes.47 Also, many nonmaterials including, magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and Au, Pt, and Cu nanomaterials, are utilized with artificial enzymes in biosensors.48,49 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted a great deal of attention due to their great functionalities, suitable size, good biocompatibility and other particular properties.50 In recent years, some MOF–metal nanoparticle materials51 were synthesized for bioanalytical applications, such as cancer therapy,52,53 biosensing and gene assay.54 The integration of metal nanoparticles with MOFs causes fast electron transfer currents with localized surface plasmons.55 In a new study, Pt@P-MOF(Fe) is combined with artificial enzymes and is used as a nanocarrier and for electrochemical signal enhancement.32 In this study, the telomerase primer (TP) hybridized with assistant DNA2 (aDNA2) in triple-helix DNA and has demonstrated good sensitivity with a 20 cell per mL limit of detection (LOD). This artificial nanozyme biosensor has some great features such as a novel method to use an artificial nanozyme in an electrochemical biosensor, a new way to exploit the intrinsic activity of MOFs and utilizing it as a signal medium to amplify the signal. However, the challenges of this study should also be noted, which include having low sensitive detection for low concentrations of analytes and evaluating MOF features to detect biomarkers in vivo. And it is very interesting to examine one of the most recent studies in this regard. In this article, Ag2S/Ag decorated ZnIn2S4/C3N4 3D/2D heterostructures could improve bioanalytical sensitivity for fabrication of specific electrochemical tools56 (Fig. 2). In another study that was carried out by Ling et al.,33 the encapsulation of noble-metal platinum nanoparticles was performed to create a Pt/MOF composite. This composite can be used to prepare a good biosensing device for easily integrating other signal amplifications for trace detecting a wide range of telomerase activity and elucidating the biofunctionality of telomerase. Moreover, the combinations of nanomaterials and MOFs such as metal oxides, carbon-based nanomaterials, and metal NPs, have an effective role in the creation of new multifunctional materials for signal amplification in various fields.57,58 CeMOFs (cerium-based metal–organic frameworks) have a necessary role in decreasing the background signal with high reliability, stability, and reproducibility.34 Dong et al.34 have proposed a new electrochemical sensor based on CeMOFs with AuNPs, Au@CeMOF, hybridization hairpin probe and telomerase primer (TP), which has shown excellent electrocatalysis because of its specific structure, presenting increased current for signal readout. This study measured telomerase activity in a single cell with a low LOD and wide linear range. Like the previous study, in another study conducted in 2020, the specificity of the biosensor is increased by active metal–organic framework (MIL-101(Fe)), DNAzyme with Zn2+. Then, hairpin DNA HpDNA–AuNPs were added to a GCE to enhance electrochemical signals for telomerase activity detection.35 Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are more appropriate for direct detection of tags and classic electrochemistry, because of their lower oxidation potential.59 Wang and his coworkers37 have decorated AgNPs on the surface of a pre-synthesized MOF (PCN-224) via in situ reduction of AgNO3 and this AgNPs/PCN-224 was deposited as a signal probe on a GC modified electrode with Au. The hairpin-structured DNA (H-P DNA) was linked to the modified electrode by the AueS affinity. Different concentrations of telomerase were added and telomerase activity as low as 5.4 × 10−8 IU L−1 has been detected.37 By evaluating telomerase activity in cancer cells, this high-performance study showed that HeLa cells possess high telomerase activity. Nucleic acids are utilized to create various accurate signal amplification techniques, nanomachines, biomedicine and biosensing, due to their appropriate specificity and predictability of Watson–Crick base pairing.60,61 Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) including nucleic acids in a spherical configuration with duplexed or single-stranded oligonucleotide softened around a nanoparticle core, are nanostructures.62 Introducing spherical nucleic acid gold nanoparticles (SNA AuNPs) into the detection system as primary amplification elements was performed, which has been broadly used for signal amplification. Electrochemical signals can improve with doxorubicin-spherical nucleic acid (DSNA) and framework nucleic acid (FNA) nanomachines for resistance to enzymatic degradation, low toxicity, and increased binding constants with complementary sequences.63 In a study, entropy-tetrahedron (ET) and primer-tetrahedron (PT) probes via Au–S bonds are immobilized on the surface of a bare gold electrode. While telomerase exists, the fuel-tetrahedron (FT) quickly binds to the exposed toehold domain to generate an ET–FT complex and this complex captures DSNA/FNA, creates an amplified electrochemical signal and finally could detect telomerase activity with a 2 cell per mL LOD.36 In another research study that was carried out in 2015, the SNA AuNP solution was dropped on a gold electrode and hairpin DNA probe 1 (H1) and finally hairpin DNA probe 2 (H2) was cast onto the electrode for enzyme-free amplification and has detected telomerase activity with as few as 2 HeLa cells.38 Au nanorods (AuNRs) have attracted great interest as a platform for theranostic operations and biomedical applications, especially imaging and cancer hyperthermia due to their tunable optical features, reproducible synthesis, stability, biosafety, ease of surface modification and simple protocols for synthesis with designed parameters.64,65 In a recent study, the telomerase primer (TS) was immobilized onto a GCE and was prepared to sense the probe by AuNRs, which were functionalized with a carboxylic group (AuNRs-3) and acetaminophen and sequentially attached with capture DNA (cDNA).41 The hybridization between the AuNRs-3-cDNA electrocatalyst and the extended part on the biosensor surface could generate a significantly amplified electrocatalytic current toward acetaminophen. This property has caused a wide dynamic range, low LOD, and great sensitivity. The synthesis of spherical mesoporous silica particles with high thermal stability chemically via the Stöber method was first exhibited in 1997.66 The features of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) in drug delivery have attracted much attention because of their well satisfying biocompatibility, chemical properties, improved bioavailability, and thermal stability. MSNs have been highly utilized in various biomedical fields, including diagnosis, drug delivery, cellular uptake and biosensing.67 Silica nanoparticles, the submicron size range structures carrying silica adducts, have several pores to load different molecules inside them. Also, the silica body further creates an external surface between anionic molecules attached to the outer surface of the silica and pore openings. DNA-gated magnetic mesoporous silica nanocontainers (MMSNs) that were immobilized on a magnetic removable screen-printing carbon electrode (SPE) can detect telomerase activity by wrapping DNA strands on MMSNs to create rigid hairpin-like DNA structures.39 This strategy can be an alternative method designed by the homogeneous assay with no sample washing with a limit of 12 cells per mL LOD. One of the most important features of electrochemical bioanalyticals is that they are enzyme free and PCR free. These two features have increased the efficiency of these types of systems and reduced their complexity. In this regard, in a study, a type of electrochemical system based on AuNRs has been developed to measure telomerase activity.68 Wang et al.69 have utilized Pd nanoparticles anchored on amine functionalized Cr-based metal–organic frameworks as a redox mediator. This bioanalytical system demonstrates a low limit of detection and wide dynamic correlation of telomerase activity. This study emphasized two important features including enzyme free and PCR free.
 Fig. 2  A photoelectrochemical biosensor was generated for specific and sensitive detection of telomerase activity. In this analytical system, Ag2S/Ag decorated ZnIn2S4/C3N4 3D/2D heterostructures were utilized to enhance sensitivity.56 
Three-dimensional (3D) macroporous carbon (MPC) with continuously interconnected macroporous structures has great features and attracted attention in various fields of research such as biomimetic catalysis, catalyst supports and sensors.70 MPC with excellent electrical conductivity and pore accessibility highly employed as an electrochemical platform, is a very interesting support for noble metallic nanocatalysts.71 Also, epoxy-functionalized MPC can generate a powerful support for reacting with DNA via the biochemical self-assembly process because of the number of –COOH sites on its surface. In recent years, Pt nanostructures have been used in different operations such as photocatalytic applications, hydrogen storage, light emitting diodes (LEDs), electro-catalytic systems, and solar cells. Platinum (Pt) nanostructures are of great material interest for the improvement of sensor devices and catalytis.72 A sensitive and simple electrochemical biosensor is fabricated to detect telomerase activity in the tumor cells through integrating the telomerase-triggered CHA procedure as a unique detector and Pt/MPC-COOH as a signal probe amplifier40 (Fig. 3). The main reason that this study has important advantages of biosensors is the conjugation of Pt NPs with epoxy-functionalized MPC to impediment the aggregation of Pt NPs, and subsequently short electron-transport distance of epoxy-functionalized MPC, exhibiting outstanding catalytic activity toward acetaminophen oxidation. According to studies examined to detect telomerase activity using electrochemical biosensors, in general, we can point to two common limitations of studies, such as shorter life spans due to greater exposure to the target molecule and the limited or confined temperature range and cross-affectability of different target molecules.

3.2 Optical biosensors & telomerase activity
Optical bioanalytical systems have excellent features over conventional analytical methods because they enable the real-time, direct, and label-free detection of many biological and chemical substances. Optical sensors are immune to electromagnetic interference, can perform multiplexed detection within a single device and have a role in performing remote sensing.73 Also, they are highly sensitive, reproducible, rapid and simple-to-operate analytical tools (Table 2).

3.2.1 Fluorescence biosensors. 
Fluorescence-based techniques have been highly investigated for enhancing the sensitivity and increasing the operation of biosensors. Fluorescence biosensors have attracted attention because of their great simplicity, sensitivity, versatility, multi-analyte detection and non-invasive measurement.84 Different functional nanomaterials were used widely in the fabrication of fluorescence biosensors. For example, carbon (nano) spheres (C (N) Ss) have also been confirmed as active nanoparticles in many conversion and energy storage applications such as hydrogen storage cells, catalysis, supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries.85 Multi-decade defects have been recognized about in situ hybridization in terms of the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) mechanism that prevented mRNA expression imaging in various organisms, presenting a specific combination of multiplexing, sensitivity, quantitation, versatility and resolution.86 In 2019, Wang's group reported ultrasensitive fluorescence biosensors via combining nanoflares and mimicking a HCR-based signal amplification system on a single PG/CNS with a Janus structure.74 This biosensor has an effective role as a sensitive and convenient method for telomerase detection (Fig. 4). Spinach is a 98 nt-long RNA aptamer and binds to 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI), an analogue of the fluorophore in GFP. Both DFHBI and spinach are non-fluorescent when unbound, whereas the spinach–DFHBI complex is demonstrated to lead to a considerable enhancement in green fluorescence emission. Its activation is fluorescent and was achieved via in vitro selection from a random sequence pool of RNAs.87 A fluorescent biosensor based on the spinach aptamer has been employed for detecting telomerase activity. (TTAGGG)n repeats added to the 3′ end of the telomerase substrate primer. The spinach reconstruction assisted by an enzyme was induced to detect telomerase activity with a 100 HeLa cell LOD.75 The most important innovation in this study is that RNA spinach would allow this method to be further employed as an expressible signaling system. So, the assay revealed its potential in biological analysis, which might be significant in cancer biomarker detection in the future. Although, it is also crucial to note that one of the main defects of fluorescent bioanalytical techniques is that not all compounds are fluorescent and for this reason the variety of studies has been reduced.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a non-radiative energy transition and electronic excited state energy transfer happens between two chromophores, namely the donor and the acceptor. Moreover, the receptor attracts the energy from the donor emission wavelength.88 Various nanoparticle materials are suitable energy receptors when constructing the FRET system. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) NPs have an extensive absorption spectrum and robust oxidation operation and are regularly used as energy acceptors and fluorescent quenching agents in the construction of FRET biosensors.89 Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have attracted attention in biomedicine and bioassay studies and can convert low energy near-infrared (NIR) photons into high-energy visible light.76 In comparison with traditional down-conversion fluoroprobes, the MnO2–UCNP system is considered one of the most promising FRET techniques, since the UCNP system leads to much lower autofluorescence from ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) excitation, and lower background interference of scattering light.76 DNA walkers are molecular machines moving with higher precision on the nanoscale because of their functional programmability and structure. In biosensors, DNA walkers as the signal amplifier are commonly triggered through target molecules and powered by some specific reactions such as toehold mediated strand displacement.90 Integration of the MnO2–UCNP FRET system with the 3D DNA walker-based signal amplification method can detect telomerase activity with higher sensitivity and the detection limit could reach 23 HeLa cells.76 The telomerase-catalyzed extension-reaction can increase the DNA walking event and then the DNA walker containing a DNAzyme sequence could spontaneously move along the substrate DNA-based track, subsequently developing a sensing tool that is successfully used for telomerase activity detection in spiked human urine samples. Therefore, this sensing method can be utilized as a strong non-invasive diagnostic technique to screen for bladder cancer in clinical applications. Turberfield et al. have demonstrated that a DNA tetrahedron is a classical three-dimensional framework.91 Four well-designed 55-base oligonucleotides are mixed in the equimolar in salt-containing buffer to make a DNA tetrahedron. The high biostability and perfect cell permeability cause the DNA tetrahedron to be a great scaffold for intracellular imaging and sensing. Flare DNA and the DNA tetrahedron construct a DNA nanoprobe for FRET devices and in the presence of the telomerase primer probe, the generated DNA nanoprobe configuration can be altered.77


3.2.2 Surface plasmon resonance (SPR). 
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a label-free detection technique that has appeared in the last 20 years as an excellent and appropriate method for the clinical analysis of biomolecular interactions. In the past, considerable enhancements and various implementations of the SPR sensor technology including in foodborne marker screening, medical diagnostics, area of chemical sensing, and environmental monitoring were observed.92 SPR biosensors can evaluate small local alterations in the refractive index, directly linked to alterations in concentrations on a surface. A rapid SPR sensor is based on 5′-biotinylated oligomers comprising telomeric repeats that were coated on streptavidin-pretreated dextran sensor surfaces to bind telomeric repeat elongation (TRE).79 This rapid detector has other advantages such as reproducibility and simplicity. (localized surface plasmon resonance) LSPR is used when noble metal nanomaterials' conduction electrons oscillate collectively upon interaction with light. LSPR has specific applications such as phototherapy, biosensing, and catalysis.93 So, the LSPR technology is more localized compared to traditional SPR biosensors, and permits for probing procedures at the platform interface with good specific sensitivity within the nanometer scale. In SPR and LSPR devices, Ag, Au, and Cu nanoparticles are suitable plasmonic materials due to their good biocompatibility, photostability, and much stronger, and low toxicity scattering signal intensity in comparison with the fluorescence of a dye or quantum dot.94 LSPs are charge density oscillations limited to the mentioned metal nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) exhibit a special presence of SPR because of LSP. Since Natan's group showed that AuNPs remarkably increased the sensitivity of SPR sensors,95 Wang et al.78 have designed a new 50 nm gold core-satellite nanostructure (Au50) as the core and 13 nm gold nanoparticles (Au13) (Au50@Au13) for label-free LSPR sensing of telomerase activity. In this study, the color change from orange to green was detected with an enhancement of telomerase activity. This LSPR sensing system containing Au50@Au13 with the plasmon coupling effect exhibited appropriate selectivity and a great signal-to-noise ratio for quantitative monitoring and in situ imaging of telomerase activity in cancer cell lines. Also, Au50@Au13 was employed productively for revealing changes in the intracellular telomerase activity in response to telomerase-based drug treatments. However, the important disadvantages of SPR that affect its results are the long calibration process, sensitivity to temperature and motion and being bulky in size.


3.2.3 Colorimetric assay. 
Colorimetry methods minimize radioactive/mutagenic hazards and polymerase-derived artifacts, enable visual determination, and facilitate a more maneuverable, portable, and on-site assay of telomerase.96 A calorimetric biosensor shows a color change that can be used to detect targets. A simple colorimetric sensor can decrease costs, increase function and instrumentation in fluorescence diagnosis and thus can cause real-time, on-site detection easier. AuNPs were the broadly used probes to develop colorimetric analytical methods. An oligonucleotide-modified AuNP based colorimetric biosensor can be used as a signal transducer and analyze telomerase activity through two types of DNA modification.81 AuNPs as reporters, telomeric substrate (TS) primer, a linker DNA, a hairpin DNA, and nicking endonuclease (NEase) as functional reagents were inserted into the sample solution (Fig. 5). Lack of telomerase and linker DNA with complementary strands to DNA1 and DNA2 increased the aggregation of AuNPs. Then, the solution's color turned to purple. On the other hand, a chain reaction happened in the existence of telomerase.81 Hemin–graphene conjugates (H–GNs) have the main advantages of both graphene and hemin and demonstrate excellent features.97 Hemin (iron protoporphyrin IX) (heme in its oxidized state) is a common natural metaloporphyrin and is an active site in heme-proteins that contain peroxidases, catalases, myoglobins and hemoglobins.98 The H–GNs structure is various dispersibilities in the higher salt concentration while existing with single- or double-strand DNA sequences. Xu et al.82 have fabricated a H–GN colorimetric sensor to evaluate telomerase activity. The important point in this analytical method is that the elongated primers through telomerase extracts protected the H–GNs from the aggregation induced by salt. In this sensor, in positive TS solutions, the individual H–GN electrostatic repulsion and resisted salt-induced H–GN coagulation were elevated and the color of the solutions changed to dark blue. This proposed bioanalytical method is simpler than TRAP which was previously discussed and also this colorimetric system could measure telomerase activity in real urine samples.

3.3 Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a biosensor device that has a mechanical transducer and this transducer operates on the principle of mass detection.99 The QCM technique is one of the most useful tools for obtaining quantitative and qualitative information about biomolecular interactions via the detection of mass change. The QCM has the features of being real-time, label-free, easily operated, etc. These features make the sensor applicable to biological diagnosis.100 Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) can be employed on QCM surfaces that are effective amplifiers in DNA detection and provide easy functionalization and also large mass.101 The binding of telomerase extends (TTAGGG)n by the 3′ end as a primer and oligonucleotide-functionalized GNPs on the QCM sensor can form a single-stranded G-rich strand and detect telomerase activity with 37 cells per mL.102 QCM analytical systems have been shown to be effective in detection of different target molecules in various studies but surprisingly, studies on this type of bioanalytical tool for telomerase activity detection are few.
4 Conclusion
The telomere is a specific chromosomal structure including tandem GT-rich repeats (TTAGGG)n, protecting the linear chromosome termination from degradation and fusion. Detecting telomerase activity can be a cancer biomarker for therapeutic and diagnosis approaches because of its high correlation with cell tumorgenesis and immortalization. Routine methods such as various types of TRAP and TERT are approved for evaluation of telomerase activity. However, these methods have some limitations including high cost, tedious functions and equipment for rapid thermal cycling. Compared with conventional methods, biosensors are low cost, simple, excellent sensitivity and even portable. Electrochemical biosensors based on different nanomaterials, various techniques of optical biosensors such as colorimetry, SPR, fluorescence and QCM were employed for telomerase activity detection. In most of the studies these biosensors have been used with appropriate sensitivity and specificity. Although, further research in QCM is necessary, approximately all of the studies that are mentioned in this review study have been approved to be relatively sensitive and also cheaper than conventional methods. Other types of bioanalytical methods such as colorimetric and QCM can be discussed more in the future for telomerase activity detection, because studies on this type of biosensor are few. Furthermore, in this review article, we discussed various types of nanomaterials and one of the important points for future research is using more sensitive and easy to synthesize nanomaterials. If we look at this review in a general way, we should also mention the general challenges of bioanalyticals investigated in this study. For example, some types of electrochemical methods require warm-up time before starting tests due to the electrode type and need for polarization to function well. However, most of the optical methods do not have these limitations. Also, it is necessary to remind this point for future studies that analytical methods such as piezoelectric should be used to measure telomerase activity more. We should also take a critical look at optical analytical tools such as SPR because they have an important flaw and that is that the ligand may not protect its native configuration upon immobilisation on the sensor chip surface. But the important guess that we make in the field of future studies regarding bioanalytical methods and measuring telomerase activity is to use electrochemical methods that are based on 2D or 3D structures.
