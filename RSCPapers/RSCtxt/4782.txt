1. Introduction
Porous materials play vital roles in many fields of science and technology and have attracted much attention as a useful platform for advanced functional material design. Historically, the skeleton structure of porous materials has clearly evolved from the inorganic open frameworks of zeolites and mesoporous silicates1–3 to metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs)4–6 and recently organic porous materials.7–24 Organic porous materials can be constructed by noncovalent and covalent approaches. Organic cage crystallization forms a representative class of noncovalent organic porous materials.7–9 In contrast, porous organic polymers (POPs),10–13 hyper crosslinked polymers (HCPs),14–16 polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs),17–19 covalent organic frameworks (COFs),20–22 porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs),23,24 and conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs)25,26 constitute the typical classes of covalently linked organic porous materials and feature high porosity, lightweight elements and strong covalent linkages. Among these covalently linked organic porous materials, CMPs are a class of amorphous materials that permit the linking of building blocks in a π-conjugated fashion and possess three-dimensional (3D) networks. These structural features are unique and are not available in other porous materials, which are typically not π-conjugated, or conventional conjugated polymers, which are nonporous. Since the discovery of the first CMP by Cooper,27 many chemists and materials scientists have joined this field of study and contributed to the rapid growth of the CMP family. One may notice that PAFs are not π-conjugated over the skeletons, whereas imine-linked COFs are π-conjugated but have high crystallinity; these two porous materials cannot be categorized as CMPs.
From a molecular design perspective, the most characteristic feature of CMPs is the rather broad diversity of π units. Building blocks ranging from simple phenyl units to extended arenes, heterocyclic aromatic units and large macrocycles have been successfully exploited for the synthesis of CMPs. Because there is less limitation on size, geometry and functional groups, CMPs can systematically tune their π-conjugated porous architectures and allow for the optimization of the skeleton and properties.
From a synthetic perspective, chemical reactions for synthesizing linear conjugated polymers, such as the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction,28,29 Yamamoto reaction,30,31 Sonogashira–Hagihara reaction,32,33 oxidative coupling,34,35 Schiff-base reaction,10,36 cyclotrimerization,37,38 phenazine ring fusion reaction39,40 and Friedel–Crafts arylation,41,42 are effective for the preparation of CMPs. The diversity of building blocks, coupled with the wide availability of different reaction types, make CMPs an invaluable platform for developing new organic porous materials.
From a functional perspective, recent advancements in the complementary utilization of conjugated skeletons and nanopores suggest the enormous potential for exploring new functional materials to solve challenging energy and environmental issues. This potential is exemplified by the excellent performance of CMPs in gas adsorption, heterogeneous catalysis, light emitting, light harvesting and electric energy storage. In this paper, we provide a review of CMPs, covering basic design concepts, the state-of-the-art advancements in synthesis and the frontiers of functional exploration and potential applications of this unique class of organic porous materials.
2. Design and synthesis
2.1 Design principles
2.1.1 Geometric requirements. The network architecture of CMPs requires that building blocks have at least two reactive groups. To build the porous structure, cross-coupling of building blocks with different geometries to fulfill a 3D polymer skeleton is necessary, whereas self-condensation reactions are useful for the homo-coupling of building blocks. For clarity, building blocks are classified by their geometries into C2, C3, C4 and C6 categories (Fig. 1). Self-condensation such as C2 + C2 + C2,43,44 C3 + C345,46 or C4 + C447,48 leads to the formation of 3D networks. In contrast, cross-coupling reactions typically use such combinations as C2 + C3,27,49 C2 + C4,50,51 C2 + C6,52 C3 + C4, C3 + C6 or C4 + C6.53 In both cases, nanopores are fixed in 3D networks by covalent bonds, leaving permanent porosity in the resulting CMPs.

2.1.2 Diversity of reactive groups. A variety of π units, such as arenes, fused aromatic rings, phenylethynylene derivatives, heterocyclic units and macrocyclic systems, have been developed as building blocks for the synthesis of CMPs (Fig. 1). Reactive groups, such as bromoarenes, iodoarenes, aromatic boronic acids, cyano-substituted arenes, aromatic aldehydes, ethynyl-substituted arenes and amino-substituted arenes, are widely utilized in the synthesis of CMPs. The diversity of building blocks and the wide range of reactive groups endow CMPs with different chemical structures and thus different functions.
2.2 Synthetic reactions and methods
To construct a conjugated skeleton, the synthetic reaction must covalently link building blocks with a π-conjugated bond. Chemical reactions utilized for the preparation of linear conjugated polymers can also be employed for the synthesis of CMPs. The Suzuki cross-coupling reaction,50,51 Yamamoto reaction,47,48 Sonogashira–Hagihara reaction,27,49 oxidative coupling reaction,45,54,55 Schiff-base reaction,56–58 Friedel–Crafts reaction,59 phenazine ring fusion reaction53 and cyclotrimerization43,44 have been well established for the synthesis of CMPs (Fig. 2). Because building blocks can have different geometries, reactive groups, and π systems, this structural diversity significantly enhances the flexibility of the design of both skeletons and pores.
 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of reactions for the synthesis of CMPs. 
As a general synthetic protocol, a mixture of monomers, catalyst and solvent is allowed to stir under an inert atmosphere at a designated temperature for a certain period of time. The precipitate is collected, washed with solvents to remove the catalyst and unreacted monomers and dried under vacuum to remove solvent molecules from the pores, yielding CMPs.
As an alternative method, reactions upon microwave irradiation have been developed for the synthesis of CMPs.60–62 The advantage of the microwave method is that it shortens the reaction time while enhancing the porosity. In contrast, ionothermal reactions using metal halides as a molten medium at elevated temperatures have been developed for the efficient synthesis of triazine-63–67 and phenazine-linked CMPs (Fig. 3).53
 Fig. 3  Schematic representation of the synthesis of phenazine-fused Aza-CMP and its elementary pore structure. 
The π-conjugated skeletons of CMPs allow for post-synthesis modification. For example, a radical thiol–yne reaction has been applied to phenylethynylene-based CMPs (Fig. 4).68 The thiol–yne ratio can tune the degree of functionalization and regulate the microporosity simultaneously. Similarly, the reaction of ethynyl groups with lithium metal, followed by treatment with carbon dioxide, modified the phenylethynylene CMP with carboxylate functionalities.69
 Fig. 4  Schematic representation of the synthesis of CMP-1 and its post-synthesis thiol–yne reaction. 
CMPs are typically obtained as insoluble powders, making it difficult to form thin films by solution processes. Cooper and coworkers have recently synthesized a soluble CMP (SCMP1) by introducing bulky organic units, such as tert-butyl, to the periphery of CMPs, using a strategy based on the two-step Suzuki cross-coupling reaction (Fig. 5).50 The resulting pyrene-based SCMP1 exhibits microporous characteristics and has a moderate Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (SBET) of 505 m2 g−1. One significant feature of SCMP1 is that it allows for solution-processable film preparation. Although the porosity of the film remains to be improved, this SCMP1 methodology is important from the application perspective.

2.3 Structural studies
The insolubility and amorphous nature of CMPs makes their structural characterization relatively complicated in comparison with soluble conjugated polymers and crystalline organic porous frameworks. Nevertheless, the chemical structure of CMPs can be unambiguously characterized by various analytical methods. For example, infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, solid-state 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy allow the composition, linkages, and end groups of CMPs to be determined. The macroscopic morphology of CMPs can be investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), whereas the nanopores can be visualized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Dynamic light scattering analysis is a powerful method for evaluating the size and distribution of CMP particles.
The 3D structure of the building blocks in CMP skeletons is difficult to resolve by X-ray diffraction measurements due to its amorphous nature. To study the 3D structure, Cooper and coworkers have developed an atomistic simulation method.49 The method utilizes fragmental models and amorphous cell simulation embedded in the Materials Studio Modeling package to build the molecular models. This methodology can predict the elementary molecular skeleton in the network and provides insights into the intra-skeleton intercalation and thus the occupation of pores in the fragment. In particular, the increased degree of conformational freedom in the extended struts allows for greater intramolecular intercalation and space filling within the fragments. Therefore, the increase in cluster size does not scale in direct proportion to the average strut length. The conformational freedom may also contribute to the reduction in the micropore volume for networks with longer struts.
Nitrogen sorption isotherm curves provide information regarding the porosity of CMPs using the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) methods.70 The gas sorption data provide important parameters, such as surface area, pore volume, pore size and pore distribution. However, these parameters can be strongly model dependent, whereas the swelling effect of CMPs must be considered. Until now, no universal model has been available for the simulation of the porous structure of CMPs.
3. Structural control
3.1 Control over conjugated structure and morphology
Depending on the different types of reactions employed (Fig. 2), the skeletons of CMPs can be categorized into phenylene-, ethynylene-, imine-, and phenazine-linked types, among others.
CMPs are typically obtained as nanoparticles with 3D particle morphology as a result of the crosslinking network. A recent report has found that the morphology of a phenylethynylene CMP (Fig. 6) is highly dependent on the reaction solvent.71 Changing the reaction solvent from toluene to p-xylene and mesitylene changes the morphology of CMPs from spherical to tubular and platelet while retaining a similar BET surface area of approximately 390 m2 g−1. Macroscopic morphology has a significant effect on the adsorption of organic solvents, such as kerosene, acetone, aniline, dichloromethane, nitrobenzene, bromobenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, trimethylbenzene, toluene and benzene, and CMPs with platelet morphology exhibit the best adsorption performance.
 Fig. 6  Schematic representation of the synthesis of a phenylethynylene-based CMP. 
3.2 Control over porous structure
The porous structure is highly dependent on the monomer structure, monomer ratio and reaction conditions. Efforts have been particularly focused on enhancing surface area and pore volume, with the aim of achieving a high capacity for gas adsorption.
3.2.1 Control by tuning the monomer length and geometry. The CMP skeleton consists of knots and linkers, whose size has a profound effect on the material's porosity. For example, changing the linker length but not the knot size tunes the porous structure of phenylethynylene-based CMPs (Fig. 7).49 In this case, the knot is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted phenyl derivative, whereas the linkers are designed to have different lengths, increasing from 0.82 to 1.11, 1.53, 1.90 and 2.55 nm, to yield CMP-0, CMP-1, CMP-2, CMP-3 and CMP-5, respectively. Systematic investigations reveal a clear length-dependent tendency, i.e., the BET surface area decreases as the length of the linker increases. For example, the CMP with the shortest linker distance between knots, CMP-0, has a BET surface area of 1018 m2 g−1, for which the micropore contribution is as high as 702 m2 g−1. The BET surface area of CMP-1, CMP-2, CMP-3 and CMP-5 decreases to 834, 634, 522 and 512 m2 g−1, respectively. The micropore contribution also decreases to 675, 451, 350 and 257 m2 g−1, respectively. Pore volume follows a similar trend, decreasing from 0.38 to 0.33, 0.25, 0.18 and 0.16 cm3 g−1, respectively. Moreover, the pore becomes larger as the linker is longer. These results indicate that a short linker favors the development of a microporous structure, whereas a long linker generates a mesoporous skeleton. A family of pyrene-based CMPs (Fig. 8, YPy, YDBPy, YDPPy and SDBPy) exhibits a similar effect of linker size on the porosity of CMPs.47
 Fig. 7  Schematic representation of phenylethynylene-based CMPs. 
 Fig. 8  Schematic representation of the synthesis of pyrene-based CMPs. 
The geometry of the linker unit plays a key role in the development of a porous structure. The Yamamoto reaction of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobifluorene yields a CMP (YSN) with a BET surface area of 1275 m2 g−1, which decreases to 887 m2 g−1 in a CMP prepared from the copolymerization of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobifluorene with para-substituted 1,4-dibromobenzene (Fig. 9).46 The BET surface area decreases further to 361 m2 g−1 when 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobifluorene is copolymerized with meta-substituted 1,3-dibromobenzene. More drastically, when ortho-substituted 1,2-dibromobenzene is utilized as a comonomer, the resulting material is nonporous with a surface area of only 5 m2 g−1. Therefore, an extended linker, such as a para-substituted phenyl unit, benefits the formation of porous skeletons, whereas a sterically hindered linker, such as an ortho-substituted phenyl moiety, cannot develop a porous network because the polymerization reaction cannot proceed smoothly.
 Fig. 9  Schematic representation of the synthesis of spirobifluorene-based CMPs using linkers of different geometries. 

3.2.2 Control by using a statistical copolymerization scheme. In addition to those consisting of two building blocks as described above, systems with three reactive components have been developed using a statistical copolymerization scheme for the control of porosity.49 For example, when the knot unit 1,3,5-trisubstituted ethynylbenzene is reacted with a mixture of 1,4-diiodobenzene (DIB) and 4,4′-diiodobiphenyl (DIBP) as a linker unit, the surface area and micropore volume increase with decreasing DIB content (Fig. 10). The BET surface areas increase from 643 to 722, 749, 757, 775 and 856 m2 g−1 as the content of DIB is increased from 0 to 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%, respectively. Meanwhile, the micropore volume increases from 0.25 to 0.29, 0.29, 0.30, 0.31 and 0.32 cm3 g−1, respectively. This incremental tendency is similar to that of two-component synthetic systems.
 Fig. 10  Schematic representation of the synthesis of CMPs using two linker units (DIB and DIBP) in different molar ratios. 

3.2.3 Control by tuning reaction conditions. Reaction media play a significant role in the development of porous structures. Similar to the solvent effect on morphology, a significant solvent effect on porosity is observed for CMPs prepared by the Sonogashira–Hagihara reaction of 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene with various dibromo-substituted arene units (Fig. 11).72 For example, the copolymerization of 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene with 2,5-dibromobenzene-1,4-diol forms CMPs, whose surface areas decrease from 1043 to 847, 778 and 761 m2 g−1, when prepared in DMF, THF, 1,4-dioxane and toluene, respectively. The micropore volume exhibits a similar trend, decreasing from 0.40 to 0.33, 0.32 and 0.27 cm3 g−1, respectively. A similar solvent effect on the porous structure is also observed for other linkers.
 Fig. 11  Schematic representation of the synthesis of phenylethynylene-based CMPs using linkers with different functional groups and geometries. 
The molar ratio of monomers typically determines the polymerization degree of a linear conjugated polymer. In the case of CMPs, the ratio of building blocks for the knot and linker has a significant effect on the porous structure. For example, in the Yamamoto reaction of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobifluorene as the knot and 1,4-dibromobenzene as the linker, increasing the ratio of knot to linker from 1:0 to 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4 causes a drastic decrease in the BET surface area from 1275 to 887, 580, 457 and 156 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. 9).46 The pore volume decreases from 0.997 to 0.686, 0.415, 0.305 and 0.159 cm3 g−1, respectively. The micropore volume also decreases sharply from 0.749 to 0.504, 0.335, 0.240 and 0.097 cm3 g−1, respectively.
In the ionothermal synthesis of triazine-based porous polymers, the ratio of catalyst to monomer affects the polymerization degree significantly, giving rise to a series of networks with different pore volumes, surface areas and pore size distributions. For example, the porous triazine network (Fig. 12) synthesized from (1,1′,4′,1′′-terphenyl)-4,4′′-dicarbonitrile with 10-equivalent ZnCl2 catalyst at 400 °C is predominantly microporous, whereas the presence of 20-equivalent ZnCl2 produces a mesoporous network with large pore size (8 nm).65 The BET surface area and pore volume increase dramatically when the catalyst ratio is increased. The use of 10-equivalent ZnCl2 leads to the formation of a polymer with a surface area and a pore volume of 495 m2 g−1 and 0.97 cm3 g−1, respectively, which increase to 1900 m2 g−1 and 2.25 cm3 g−1 when a 20-equivalent catalyst is employed.
 Fig. 12  Schematic representation of the synthesis of triazine-based porous polymers. 
The reaction temperature also drastically affects the porosity. For example, in triazine networks prepared by the trimerization of 1,4-dicyanobenzene at temperatures of 400, 500, 600 and 700 °C, the BET surface area increases from 920 to 1600, 1750 and 2530 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. 13).65 The pore volume also increases from 0.47 to 1.00, 1.58 and 2.26 cm3 g−1, respectively. Similarly, reaction temperature has a significant effect on the pore size distribution. Samples synthesized at 400 °C have a narrow distribution of micropores (1–2 nm), whereas a broad distribution (1–6 nm) is observed for networks prepared at 500 °C.
 Fig. 13  Schematic representation of the synthesis of triazine-based porous networks. 
In the ring-fused reaction for preparation of phenazine-based CMPs (Fig. 3, Aza-CMPs), changing the reaction temperature can finely tune the surface area and pore size.53 Aza-CMPs synthesized at 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 °C have BET surface areas increasing from 24 to 546, 1029, 1086 and 1227 m2 g−1, respectively, whereas the pore size decreases from 1.65 to 1.40, 0.90 and 0.85 nm (for the highest two temperatures), respectively.
A microwave reaction has been developed for the synthesis of CMPs and has demonstrated significant merits over the traditional heating method, as it can shorten the reaction time while increasing the resulting porosity. For example, the triazine-based porous polymer CTF-1 (Fig. 13) synthesized via the ionothermal polymerization of 1,4-dicyanobenzene at 400 °C for 40 h has a BET surface area of 791 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.4 cm3 g−1. In sharp contrast, a 60 min microwave reaction of 1,4-dicyanobenzene yields CTF-1 with surface area and pore volume as high as 2390 m2 g−1 and 2.52 cm3 g−1, respectively.61
Monitoring the polymerization reaction is an interesting and important issue due to its possibility of providing insights to the mechanistic aspect of porous skeleton development. In a TPE–CMP system (Fig. 14), polymerization is monitored by time-dependent FE-SEM measurements.48 The size of the resulting CMP particles increases with the reaction time. For example, the average size of CMPs is approximately 25 nm after a 2 h reaction, which increases to 55, 100 and 255 nm as the reaction time is extended to 12, 36 and 72 h, respectively. Similarly, the BET surface area readily increases with the reaction time, from 753 to 1340, 1464 and 1665 m2 g−1. The pore volume increases from 0.91 to 2.11, 2.44 and 3.42 cm3 g−1 as the reaction time extends from 2 to 12, 36 and 72 h, respectively. These results indicate that the porous structure grows larger with the reaction time to achieve high surface area and large pore volume.
 Fig. 14  Schematic representation of the synthesis of a tetraphenylethene-based CMP and its elementary pore structures. 
CMPs that possess extended π conjugation comparable to that of linear polymeric analogs can be synthesized. CMPs typically contain a mixture of micro- and mesopores and have a broad pore size distribution. The irreversibility and kinetic control of polymerization reactions give rise to various types of pores. Developing a methodology that allows for the preparation of discrete pores remains a synthetic challenge in the field of CMPs.

4. Functional exploration and applications
CMPs are unique in that they are nanoporous and π-conjugated, whereas their structures can be designed at the molecular level and synthetically controlled. By virtue of high surface areas and microporous characteristics, CMPs have emerged as a new class of porous materials for gas adsorption and storage applications. The pores provide open space and are accessible to various guest molecules and metal ions, allowing for the construction of supramolecular structures and organic–inorganic hybrids. Most importantly, CMPs allow the complementary utilization of π-conjugated skeletons and nanopores for functional exploration. They have shown great potential for challenging energy and environmental issues, as exemplified by their excellent performance in such applications as gas adsorption, heterogeneous catalysis, light emitting, light harvesting and electric energy storage.
4.1 Gas adsorption and storage
CMPs have been widely explored for the adsorption and storage of gases, such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane. In addition to the control over porosity provided by synthetic methods, the pore environment can be modified by introducing functional units to the wall surface. This surface functionalization is an important and effective way to enhance the capacity and selectivity of a specific gas.
4.1.1 Hydrogen gas. Hydrogen storage attracts public interest because the gas represents a future energy resource due to its high chemical abundance, high energy density and environmentally friendly characteristics. The Department of Energy (DOE) target for hydrogen storage by the year 2015 is 9 wt% and 81 kg m−3 in the range of 253–323 K and at a pressure of 100 atm. Among materials that rely only on relatively weak physisorption where cryogenic temperatures (e.g. <100 K) will be required, only porous materials with high surface areas (>3000 m2 g−1) and optimized pore sizes between 0.7 and 1.2 nm have the potential to meet the DOE 2015 target. These porosity requirements can very likely be achieved with CMPs. Table 1 summarizes the hydrogen storage capacity of CMPs reported to date.

Cooper and coworkers have reported poly(phenylene butadiynylene) networks for use in hydrogen storage (Fig. 15).45 HCMP-1 prepared from the palladium-catalyzed homo-coupling of 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene (SBET = 842 m2 g−1, pore size = 1.1–1.6 nm) and HCMP-2 formed by the palladium-catalyzed homo-coupling of 1,4-diethynylbenzene (SBET = 827 m2 g−1, pore size = 0.9–1.6 nm) exhibit hydrogen adsorption capacities at 77.3 K and 1.13 bar as high as 107 and 131 cm3 g−1, respectively. Although it has a relatively low surface area compared with HCMP-1, HCMP-2 has a higher micropore volume (0.26 cm3 g−1) than that of HCMP-1 (0.23 cm3 g−1), which accounts for the increased storage capacity. This result indicates the significance of micropores for hydrogen storage.

More recently, Yu and coworkers have developed a series of poly(phenylene) networks (Fig. 16) for use in hydrogen adsorption.43 The capacities of POP-1 (SBET = 1031 m2 g−1), POP-2 (SBET = 1013 m2 g−1), POP-3 (SBET = 1246 m2 g−1) and POP-4 (SBET = 1033 m2 g−1) at 77 K and 60 bar are 2.78, 2.71, 3.07 and 2.35 wt%, respectively. Adsorption is an enthalpically controlled process, so that the difference in capacities is likely related to the difference in the binding energies of hydrogen molecules to the aromatic skeletons.
 Fig. 16  Schematic representation of the synthesis of various poly(phenylene) CMPs. 
Post-treatment of CMPs with lithium ions is an effective way to enhance hydrogen storage capacity. For example, the polyphenylene HCMP-1 (Fig. 15) exhibits a hydrogen uptake level of 1.6 wt% at 77 K and 1 bar.54 In contrast, after treatment with lithium naphthalene in THF under Ar, a Li–CMP sample containing 0.5 wt% Li exhibits a sharp enhancement in capacity, reaching 6.1 wt%. When the Li content is greater than 0.5 wt%, the hydrogen storage capacity decreases significantly as a result of lithium agglomeration in the pores. Hydrogen storage capacity decreases to 2.6 and 1.1 wt% for Li–CMP samples with 1.43 and 7.21 wt% Li, respectively. Similarly, the CMP-0 sample (Fig. 7), upon infusion of palladium(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate or palladium(II) acetylacetonate and subsequently heating at 310 °C under nitrogen, yields a hybrid Pd@CMP sample with Pd nanoparticles loaded in the pores. Hydrogen storage capacity increases from 0.006 wt% for CMP-0 to 0.033 and 0.069 wt% for Pd@CMP samples with 4.1 and 9.5 wt% Pd, respectively, at 293.3 K and 1.13 bar.73
CMPs with adsorption capacities as high as 6.1 wt% at 1 bar and 77 K are promising for hydrogen storage. However, these remarkable results achieved at cryogenic temperatures are still not sufficiently good for practical applications. To solve this bottleneck, increasing the enthalpy of hydrogen adsorption is an important aspect that must be considered in molecular design.

4.1.2 Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is one of the main greenhouse gases that cause global issues, such as climate warming and increases in sea level and ocean acidity. Among various techniques for capturing CO2, adsorption using porous materials is energetically efficient and technically feasible. CMPs are quite promising due to their high porosity as well as high tunability of their pore surface functionality, which is important in enhancing interactions with CO2. The CO2 uptake by CMPs reported to date is summarized in Table 2.

Cooper and coworkers have developed a series of polyphenylethynylene-based CMPs (Fig. 17) for the uptake of CO2 that incorporate a range of functional groups, including carboxylic acids, amines, hydroxyl and methyl units, into the pore surface.74 Interestingly, at low pressure (1 bar), CO2 uptake depends on the binding energy caused by functional groups rather than on absolute surface area and pore volume. CMP-1 exhibits the highest volumetric CO2 uptake, with a capacity of 1.18 mmol g−1 at 298 K and 1 bar, whereas the CMP with a dimethyl group (CMP-1–(CH3)2) exhibits the lowest uptake (0.94 mmol g−1). The experimental isosteric heats are dependent on the functional groups and follow an order of –COOH > (OH)2 > NH2 > H > (CH3)2.
 Fig. 17  Schematic representation of the synthesis of polyphenylethynylene-based CMPs having different functional groups on the pore wall. 
The electronic properties of building blocks can affect CO2 adsorption. Cooper and coworkers have investigated the CO2 adsorption of a series of CMPs with triazine and phenyl knots (Fig. 18). TCMP-0 with triazine units exhibits the highest CO2 uptake at both 273 K (2.38 mmol g−1) and 298 K (1.34 mmol g−1), whereas TCMP-3 exhibits the highest CO2/N2 selectivity (25.2). The electron-withdrawing triazine-based CMPs exhibit higher capacities and selectivities than does the phenyl series due to the strong interactions between CO2 and triazine-based skeletons.75
 Fig. 18  Schematic representation of the CMPs with triazine or phenyl knots. 
The trimerization reaction of metalloporphyrin-bearing nitrile reactive groups at 300, 400 and 500 °C yields porphyrin-based MCTF@300 (SBET = 640 m2 g−1, pore size = 1.44 nm), MCTF@400 (SBET = 1060 m2 g−1, pore size = 0.85 nm) and MCTF@500 (SBET = 1520 m2 g−1, pore size = 0.74 nm), respectively (Fig. 19).66 MCTF@300, MCTF@400 and MCTF@500 all exhibit carbon dioxide adsorption, with capacities of 98.9, 104.1 and 139.1 mg g−1, respectively, at 273 K and 1 bar. The high surface area and small pore size favor the adsorption of carbon dioxide.
 Fig. 19  Schematic representation of the synthesis of porphyrin-based MCTF networks. 
Post-synthesis treatment of CMPs that generates functional groups is an effective way to facilitate CO2 adsorption. For example, the treatment of COP-1 (Fig. 20 and Table 2) with lithium naphthalenide, followed by reaction with CO2, yields Li@COP-1, with the ethynyl groups converted to lithium carboxylate units.69 Li@COP-1 with a lithium content of 3.2 wt% exhibits a decreased BET surface area and pore volume of 573 m2 g−1 and 0.37 cm3 g−1, respectively, which are much lower than those of COP-1 (SBET = 827 m2 g−1, pore volume = 0.71 cm3 g−1). Interestingly, Li@COP-1 exhibits an enhanced capacity of 220 mg g−1, which is larger than that of pristine COP-1 (194 mg g−1), at 298 K and 18 bar.
 Fig. 20  Schematic representation of the synthesis of Li@COP-1. 
Selectivity of CMPs is another important aspect with regard to CO2 uptake. Preparing a CMP with small pores is a useful way to enhance its selectivity. For example, poly(phenylene)-based CMPs p-PPF (Fig. 21; SBET = 269 m2 g−1, pore volume = 0.20 cm3 g−1) and m-PPF (SBET = 276 m2 g−1, pore volume = 0.15 cm3 g−1) feature high CO2/N2 selectivities, as a result of a molecular sieving effect.76 Their pore size is quite small (∼0.5 nm), which results in a rather strong interaction between CO2 and CMPs, as indicated by a hysteretic loop in the sorption profiles. The capacities of p-PPF and m-PPF are as high as 58 and 41 mL g−1, respectively, at 273 K and 30 bar.
 Fig. 21  Schematic representation of the synthesis of poly(phenylene) based CMPs of p-PPF and m-PPF. 
Imine-linked CMPs synthesized from 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene and dialdehyde derivatives, which have a moderate surface area range of 70–614 m2 g−1 but small pore size range of 4 to 8 Å (Fig. 22) exhibit a high CO2 capacity of 50.2–60.7 cm3 g−1 at 273 K and 1 bar.56 The CO2/N2 selectivity is as high as 56–77. Such high selectivity suggests the chemisorption of CO2 on the skeletons and a molecular sieving effect of the small pores.
 Fig. 22  Schematic representation of the synthesis of imine-linked CMPs. 
The above results indicate that CMPs with high tuning flexibilities of their structure, functional groups and porosities are highly promising for the adsorption of CO2.

4.1.3 Methane gas. Methane gas, the primary component of natural gas, is an abundant energy resource. The target value for methane storage set by the DOE is 180 cm3 (STP) at 35 bar and 298 K. Compared with other gases, less attention has been given to the exploration of CMPs for CH4 adsorption. The isosteric sorption heats for methane in carbonaceous materials fall within the appropriate range for storage near ambient temperature; hence, organic porous materials are highly promising. COP-1 (Fig. 20) exhibits CH4 uptake with a capacity of 29 mg g−1 at 298 K and 18 bar. After loading Li ions, the uptake increases to 39 mg g−1 for Li@COP-1.69 Compared with MOFs and COFs, the uptake capacity is still low. The highest capacities reported for COFs (COF-102)77 and MOFs (MOF-210)78 are 187 mg g−1 and 220 mg g−1, respectively.
4.2 Encapsulation of dyes, solvents and other chemicals
In addition to gases, the pores of CMPs are accessible to toxic chemicals, organic solvents, dyes and fullerenes, expanding the encapsulation scope of CMPs.
The introduction of a hydrophobic unit, such as fluorine, endows CMPs with hydrophobic pores, whereas hydrophilic groups can enhance the hydrophilicity of the porous materials. Cooper and coworkers have demonstrated this strategy with a series of CMPs synthesized by the Sonogashira–Hagihara reaction of 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene with dibromobenzenes bearing different substituents (Fig. 11).79 When tested with a water-soluble methyl orange dye, these CMPs exhibit completely different behaviors when dispersed in water. For example, only CMPs with hydroxyl groups in the skeletons can absorb methyl orange, whereas CMPs without hydrophilic groups cannot trap methyl orange.
Deng and coworkers have reported that HCMPs (Fig. 15) are useful for the adsorption of organic solvents and oils.55 By virtue of superhydrophobicity, HCMPs can absorb oils and organic solvents and allow for the efficient separation of oils and organic solvents from water. The absorbencies for 1,2-dichlorobenzene are as high as 1569 wt% for HCMP-1 and 2300 wt% for HCMP-2, respectively. These results are interesting, as they suggest possible molecular sponges based on CMPs.
A porphyrin-based porous PCPF-1 (Fig. 23) synthesized by the Yamamoto reaction of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)porphyrin is highly hydrophobic, with a contact angle of 135°.80 PCPF-1, with a BET surface area of 1333 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.86 cm3 g−1, exhibits the highest capacities for saturated hydrocarbons and gasoline among sorbent materials reported to date. For example, the adsorbed amounts of n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane are 456, 623, 752, 737, 909 and 1030 mg g−1, respectively, at 298 K and at their individual saturation pressures. The PCPF-1 sample (1 g) can adsorb 14.7 g of n-pentane, 16.7 g of n-hexane, 22.5 g of n-heptane, 25.9 g of n-octane, 15.4 g of cyclopentane, 25.1 g of cyclohexane and 20.5 g of gasoline, respectively. PCPF-1 allows for the recovery of oil from water.
 Fig. 23  Schematic representation of the synthesis of porphyrin-based CMPs. 
George and coworkers have demonstrated the encapsulation of fullerene molecules in a pyrene-based CMP (Fig. 8, Py-PP).81 Py-PP emits a greenish-yellow luminescence centered at 540 nm. The purple solution of fullerene in toluene immediately changes to colorless upon addition of Py-PP, which indicates efficient and instantaneous uptake of fullerene molecules by the CMP. The fullerene molecules in the pores cause a 20% drop in BET surface area and quench the fluorescence of the CMP.
Removal and treatment of chemical waste is an issue of broad scientific interest, great technological importance and increased public concern. Porous materials provide an advanced green approach to the removal of chemical wastes, particularly toxic chemicals, and are in many ways superior to traditional methods. Amines are important chemicals but cause severe pollutions and are a direct threat to health. However, the uptake of amines by porous materials has been very limited. From both the basic research and technological advancement perspectives the development of porous materials for amine uptake and removal remains a substantial challenge.
We synthesized a series of metalloporphyrin-based CMPs, with BET surface areas of 1140, 1247 and 1080 m2 g−1 in ZnP1–CMP, CuP1–CMP and CoP1–CMP, respectively (Fig. 23).82 Their pore volumes are 1.49, 1.49 and 1.16 cm3 g−1, respectively. Pore size distribution profiles indicate that the pore size is 0.8–2.0 nm. ZnP1–CMP is highly efficient in the uptake of amine vapor. For example, the capacity for n-propylamine reaches 1.7 gamine gCMP−1, which is larger than the theoretical capacity calculated by multiplying the pore volume and amine density (1.1 gamine gCMP−1). Interestingly, the capacity for n-butylamine increases to 2.2 gamine gCMP−1, which is increased further to 2.7 gamine gCMP−1 for n-hexylamine. ZnP1–CMP is also highly efficient for bulky secondary amines, with a capacity of 1.6 gamine gCMP−1 for dibutylamine and 2.3 gamine gCMP−1 for diisobutylamine.
ZnP1–CMP is highly efficient in uptaking amine liquid. Surprisingly, the uptake of liquid is rapid and levels off within 1 min. ZnP1–CMP exhibits a high capacity for n-propylamine (5.2 gamine gCMP−1) that is 4.8 times greater than the theoretical value (1.1 gamine gCMP−1). Interestingly, ZnP1–CMP exhibits an increased capacity of 5.4 gamine gCMP−1 for n-butylamine, which is further increased to 6.2 gamine gCMP−1 for n-hexylamine, a capacity as high as 5.4 times greater than the theoretical one. The majority of the material is the amine, whereas ZnP1–CMP occupies only 14% by weight. ZnP1–CMP is highly efficient for the uptake of secondary amines. Surprisingly, the capacities for the bulky diisobutylamine and dibutylamine are as high as 5.3 and 5.5 gamine gCMP−1, respectively. ZnP1–CMP is also useful for uptake of triethylamine with a capacity of 4.4 gamine gCMP−1. In contrast to the vapor, the capacity for the aniline liquid increases drastically to 5.4 gamine gCMP−1, which is 2.4 times higher than the theoretical value. ZnP1–CMP is also efficient for uptaking pyridine liquid, with capacity reaching 5.7 gamine gCMP−1. The ability of CMP skeletons to swell significantly increases the capacity to a super absorption regime.
The uptake capacity depends on the metal species. A clear tendency is that CuP1–CMP is as efficient as ZnP1–CMP, whereas CoP1–CMP is relatively less active. These differences suggest that the metal ions centered in the porphyrin rings affect amine uptake through their influence on the electron density of the porphyrin ring and thus the conjugated skeleton. Therefore, manipulation of the electron density of CMPs, for example, by using an electron-deficient skeleton, is a subject worthy of further study.
4.3 Heterogeneous catalysis
CMPs are characterized by their capabilities of integrating various functionalities into their skeletons. Introduction of catalytic sites to the skeletons endows CMPs with built-in catalytic sites. Due to their 3D open frameworks, CMPs constitute a new type of nanoreactor that allows the complementary utilization of skeletons and pores.
We have developed the first example of CMP-based catalytic systems, which employed metalloporphyrin units as active sites (Fig. 24, FeP–CMP).83,84 Metalloporphyrin functionalities are gained, as the units serves as the knots in a tetragonal skeleton. FeP–CMP consists of dense catalytic sites and has a high surface area of 1270 m2 g−1. The micropores are accessible to substrates and reactants, thus allowing for the generation of a heterogeneous catalytic system. FeP–CMP displays high catalytic activity in the oxidation of sulfide with a turnover number (TON) as high as 97320 and a conversion as high as 97%. FeP–CMP is highly active with a broad scope of substrates, including alkyl, aromatic and cyclic sulfides. The oxidation is highly chemoselective to oxidize sulfide units and forms sulfoxide. The FeP–CMP catalyst is insoluble, enabling facile separation from the reaction mixture by simple filtration. FeP–CMP can be cycled repeatedly without a significant decrease in catalytic activity. The catalyst can be further developed for the oxidation of the stronger CC bond. FeP–CMP exhibits high efficiency (99%) and high activity (TON > 107) in the epoxidation of olefins. Indeed, FeP–CMP is effective for the epoxidation of a variety of olefins, including alkyl, aromatic and cyclic types.
 Fig. 24  Schematic representation of the synthesis of FeP–CMP. 
Cooper and coworkers have developed a metallo-organic CMP with coordinated Ir sites that catalyzes a reductive amination reaction (Fig. 25, CMP–CpIr-3).85 CMP–CpIr-3 exhibits high catalytic activity, with 90% yield, and is efficient for a series of substrates of alkyl, aromatic and cyclic substrates.
 Fig. 25  Schematic representation of the synthesis of metallo-organic CMP–CpIr-3. 
Schüth and coworkers have developed a triazine-based porous Pt–CTF catalyst that bears coordinated Pt sites (Fig. 26).64 The Pt–CTF sample exhibits stable catalytic activity with a TON value of 250 for the oxidation of methane to methanol. This catalytic activity is similar to that of the homogeneous analog; however, Pt–CTF is recyclable by simple separation.
 Fig. 26  Schematic representation of the synthesis of Pt–CTF. 
The Sonogashira coupling reaction not only generates CMPs but also produces Pd nanoparticles encapsulated within the CMP pores (Fig. 27, Pd@CNPCs).86 Guo and coworkers have shown that Pd@CNPCs are useful for catalyzing the Suzuki coupling reaction, with a turnover frequency as high as 44100 h−1. The Pd@CNPCs catalyst can be recycled without a significant leak of Pd nanoparticles due to spatial confinement. These researchers have also developed a magnetic hybrid Fe3O4@ CNPC consisting of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE) networks and entrapped Fe3O4 nanocrystals.87 The Fe3O4@CNPC microspheres combine such properties as narrow size distribution, porosity, luminescence, rapid magnetic response and high catalytic activity.
 Fig. 27  Schematic representation of the synthesis of Pd@CNPCs. 
Lin and coworkers have developed chiral cross-linked polymer networks (Fig. 28, CCPs) based on 1,10-binaphthyl.88 Upon complexation with titanium ions, the networks exhibit good activity and modest enantioselectivity (55–81 ee%) for asymmetric diethylzinc addition to aldehydes.
 Fig. 28  Schematic representation of the synthesis of chiral CCP-1d. 
Wang and coworkers have reported a heterogeneous organocatalyst based on a 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-pyridine (DMAP) network (Fig. 29). The DMAP-based CMP with pyridine units as active sites exhibits excellent catalytic activity in the acylation of alcohols, with a yield of 92–99%.89
 Fig. 29  Schematic representation of the synthesis of a DMAP-based CMP. 
Recently, Vilela and coworkers have reported a benzothiadiazole-based CMP as a photocatalyst for oxygen activation that exhibits porosity-dependent catalytic activity (Fig. 30).90 The CMP with the highest surface area of 660 m2 g−1 oxidizes α-terpinene with a conversion of 96% upon irradiation at 420 nm, with a singlet oxygen generation quantum yield of 0.06. Post-synthesis modification of the CMP using thiol–yne chemistry allows for the preparation of a water-dispersible CMP.91 The resulting CMP serves as a water-soluble photocatalyst for generating singlet oxygen and transforms furoic acid to 5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone with a conversion of 90% in aqueous solution upon irradiation at 420 nm.
 Fig. 30  Schematic representation of the synthesis of a benzothiadiazole-based CMP. 
As described above, the diversity of building blocks allows for the generation of various CMPs with different active sites for catalyzing different reactions. The exploration of asymmetric catalytic systems is an interesting future direction.
4.4 Light emitters
Extended π conjugation over their 3D skeletons endows CMPs with a high probability of preparing highly efficient luminescent materials. Cooper and coworkers have reported the tuning of the luminescence wavelength by changing the components of pyrene-based CMPs (Fig. 8, YPy, YDPPy, YDBPy and SDBPy).47 YPy powder synthesized by the Yamamoto reaction of 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene monomer emits a red fluorescence centered at 620 nm. When the pyrene units are linked with phenylene or biphenylene units, the resulting CMPs exhibits a luminescence at a short wavelength. Indeed, YDPPy composed of biphenylene linkers emits an orange fluorescence at 602 nm, whereas YDBPy with phenylene linkers emits a green fluorescence at 545 and 582 nm. Although the SDBPy sample synthesized by the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction has the same phenylene linker as YDBPy, it emits at 530 nm with a narrow emission band. Meanwhile, the band gap can be finely tuned by the linker. The band gap is 1.84, 1.90, 2.05 and 2.37 eV for YPy, YDPPy, YDBPy and SDBPy, respectively. These results indicate that the π networks modulate the band gap of the materials. CMPs with tunable emission colors have also been observed for tetrakisphenylethene-based,59 spirobifluorene-based92 and other CMPs.93
We have developed a highly luminescent CMP with tetrakisphenylethene (TPE) as a building block (Fig. 14, TPE–CMP).48 Due to the crosslinking nature of CMPs, TPE–CMP can suppress the rotation of TPE units, thus allowing for high luminescence in both solution and solid states. As a result, a positive “CMP effect” is observed, i.e., the interweaving CMP architecture promotes π conjugation, facilitates excitation migration and improves luminescence activity. Changing the reaction time allows for the synthesis of a series of CMPs having different sizes and absorption bands. As the reaction time is extended, the TPE–CMP particles become large, have increased surface area and display a red-shifted electronic absorption band. These results suggest that the network structure grows larger as the polymerization reaction proceeds. The fluorescence quantum yield of TPE–CMP is as high as 40%. In contrast, the linear TPE polymer exhibits a low quantum yield of only 0.65% under otherwise identical conditions.
Interestingly, due to the crosslinking nature of the network, TPE–CMP is highly luminescent irrespective of solvent, emitting strongly in various solvents, such as methanol, dioxane, THF, dichloromethane, chloroform, hexane, DMF, benzene and water, whereas the linear polymer analog is almost nonemissive in such solvents as dichloromethane, chloroform and THF. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements suggest that the exciton is not localized but migrates over the 3D CMP skeletons. These positive CMP effects suggest that the CMP architecture provides a new platform for the design of highly luminescent materials.
Recently, we have developed a core–shell strategy for achieving color-tunable and -controllable light emission while retaining high luminescence efficiency (Fig. 31).94 We have explored a one-pot two-stage polymerization protocol for the synthesis of core–shell structured CMPs; at the first stage, a blue luminescent PP–CMP core (PPC–CMP) is generated, whereas at the second stage, a yellow luminescent TPE–CMP shell is generated on the exterior surface of the PP–CMP core. This method allows for the preparation of an inverse core–shell CMP architecture with a TPE–CMP core and PP–CMP shell (TPES–PPC–CMPs). The absorption band redshifts from 312 nm for the PP–CMP core to 351 nm for the core–shell structured TPES–PPC–CMP. A similar redshift of the absorption band is observed for the inverse core–shell CMPs (PPS–TPEC–CMPs). Such a redshift is much larger than that of the linear polymer analogs. Therefore, the core–shell CMPs promote π conjugation, which is not localized in the core CMP but rather extends from the core to the shell. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements indicate that the emission is significantly depolarized even without a saturated tendency when the shell is as thick as 45 nm, which indicates that the core–shell CMPs facilitate exciton migration over the π-conjugated networks.
 Fig. 31  Schematic representation of the synthesis of core–shell CMPs. 
Remarkably, each core–shell CMP emits a single luminescence but at a longer wavelength as the shell becomes thicker. The emission wavelength shifts from 443 to 489, 499 and 518 nm as the TPE–CMP shell becomes thicker. Therefore, changing the shell thickness continuously tunes the emission from deep blue to sky blue, near white and green. This shell-thickness dependence is rather interesting because it resembles the particle-size-dependent luminescence of quantum dots.
The porous network structure plays an important role in light emission, and CMPs enhance this activity by six- to eight-fold over those of their linear analogs. The TPES–PPC–CMPs exhibit a constant fluorescence quantum yield of 23–24%, whereas the inverse PPS–TPEC–CMPs have a quantum yield of 28–32%, irrespective of shell thickness. The CMPs exhibit homogeneous and bright luminescence, with a series of colors, changing from deep blue to sky blue, near white, green, light yellow and deep yellow. Significantly, all of the CMPs sustain their emission colors and maintain bright luminescence in various solvents, including dichloromethane, chloroform, hexane, DMF, THF, dioxane, benzene, methanol and water. These luminescence features are observed even in the solid state. By virtue of their permanent porous network structures, solid-state CMPs strongly emit the same color as those in solution. The core–shell strategy is not limited to the PP–CMP and TPE–CMP systems but is rather general and extendable to a variety of CMP systems; thus it has great potential use in designing efficient light emitters with particular desired colors.
Ma and coworkers have reported a simple and effective way for the formation of thin films on electrodes using the electropolymerization method. These films have been developed as an efficient anode interlayer (hole transport) in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) and solar cells (Fig. 32, TPTCz–CMP).95 TPTCz allows electrochemical oxidation to form dimers of carbazole units, which give rise to crosslinked networks and eventually thin films deposited on electrodes. The film can be obtained in the form of free-standing film, which has a pore size of approximately 1 nm, a thickness of 150 nm, and a size of up to even 1.5 cm2. The film is capable of storing and releasing counterions and further affects its electrical properties such as work function and conductivity. This film can be used as an anode interlayer in PLEDs and enhances luminous efficiency up to 20.7 cd A−1.95 Interestingly, the film can serve as an anode interlayer with high work function and yields a significant power-conversion efficiency of 7.56% in polymer solar cells (PSCs). These device efficiencies reach the best levels in related PSC and PLED fields, which demonstrate great potentials of CMP films as electrode interlayers in organic electronics.

4.5 Chemosensors
Conjugated polymers are fascinating materials with π conjugation and light-emitting properties that allow for the detection of various chemicals. Specific sites that interact with target compounds can be introduced into conjugated chains to enhance the interaction interface and improve the signaling activity. In this context, CMPs are attractive candidates because they possess large surface areas and provide a broad interface for analyte interaction.
We have reported the first example of a chemosensing CMP, which emits blue luminescence at 468 nm (Fig. 33, TCB–CMP).96 Compared with its linear polymer analog, TCB–CMP exhibits enhanced detection sensitivity and allows for the rapid detection of arenes upon exposure to their vapors. TCB–CMP displays prominent fluorescence enhancement in the presence of electron-rich arene vapors and drastic fluorescence quenching in the presence of electron-deficient arene vapors and can be reused without a loss of sensitivity or responsiveness. These characteristics are attributed to the microporous conjugated network of the material. Specifically, the micropores uptake arene molecules in the confined space of the polymer, the skeleton possesses a large surface area and provides a broad interface for arenes, and the network architecture facilitates exciton migration over the framework. These structural features function cooperatively, enhancing the signaling activity of TCB–CMP in fluorescence-on and -off detection. This result indicates that the CMP architecture provides a unique platform for the design of de novo chemosensing systems.

Cao and coworkers have developed two CMPs (Fig. 34, COP-3 and COP-4) consisting of 1,3,5-tris(4-bromophenyl)benzene, and 2,4,6-tris-(4-bromophenyl)-[1,3,5]triazine blocks as a fluorescent chemosensor.97 The CMPs are highly sensitive to nitroaromatic explosives such as picric acid (PA) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) with a low detection limit (<1 ppm).
 Fig. 34  Schematic representation of the synthesis of COP-3 and COP-4. 
4.6 Light harvesting and excitation energy transduction
A variety of light-harvesting systems have been studied and attracted much attention due to their potential for artificial photosynthesis. Among them, CMPs that bear conjugated skeletons and inherent micropores are fascinating platforms because CMPs allow for building supramolecular light-harvesting systems by encapsulating energy acceptors within the micropores.
We have synthesized a polyphenylene-based CMP by using the Suzuki polycondensation reaction of 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene and 1,4-benzene diboronic acid. PP–CMP exhibits an absorption band at 365 nm, which is close to the theoretical maximum of linear polyphenylene. Upon excitation at 365 nm, PP–CMP emits strong blue luminescence at 443 nm. This emission band overlaps the absorption band of coumarin 6. Therefore, the combination of PP–CMP with coumarin 6 as an energy acceptor that could very likely serve as a platform for building a supramolecular light-harvesting system with PP–CMP skeletons as antennae (Fig. 35, PP–CMP).51 In this case, because of the high porosity of PP–CMP (SBET = 1083 m2 g−1, pore size = 1.56 nm), the mixture of PP–CMP and coumarin 6 in solution leads to the loading of coumarin 6 within the micropores of PP–CMP (PP–CMP⊃coumarin 6). One important point is that the ratio of coumarin 6 to PP–CMP can be easily adjusted by changing the loading ratio.
 Fig. 35  Schematic representation of the synthesis of PP–CMP. 
Upon excitation of the PP–CMP skeleton, the fluorescence of PP–CMP itself decreases with increasing coumarin 6 content. Conversely, the fluorescence from coumarin 6 increased significantly, indicating energy transfer from PP–CMP to coumarin molecules. From excitation spectra, the energy transfer quantum yield increases with the content of coumarin 6 and levels off at 90% after the content reaches 2.7 mol%. The excitation energy in PP–CMP is not localized but can migrate over the 3D skeleton, as shown by fluorescence depolarization measurements. The skeleton of PP–CMP can cooperatively serve as an antenna, in which 176 phenylene units work together to channel the excitation energy to coumarin 6. As a result, excitation of the PP–CMP skeleton leads to brilliant green emission from coumarin 6, with an intensity that is 21 times as high as that observed upon direct excitation of coumarin 6 itself. Therefore, CMP-based light harvesting systems can trigger a rapid, vectorial and highly efficient energy flow from the CMP skeleton to the acceptor molecules confined in the micropores. The conjugated skeleton allows for the transport of charge carriers with mobility as high as 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1. These results indicate that the CMP architecture is very promising for developing photoenergy conversion and photocatalytic systems.
4.7 Electrical energy storage and power supply
Supercapacitors are energy storage and power supply devices that are in increasing demand with the broadening of applications such as vehicles and electric devices. Supercapacitive energy storage operates on the electric double layer by accumulation of charges at the electrode/electrolyte interface, where the stored energy is proportional to the capacitance of the electrode. Therefore, a breakthrough in electrode materials holds the key to fundamental advances in supercapacitors. As electrode materials, activated carbons have been intensively studied, as they have capacitances as high as 270 F g−1.98,99 Recently, nanostructured carbons, such as templated carbons,100,101 graphenes,102,103 carbon nanotubes,104,105 aerogels106,107 and heteroatom-hybridized carbons108,109 have been developed with the aim of improving their performances and exhibiting capacitances of 50–370 F g−1. In contrast, polyarene CMPs pyrolyzed at 600 °C exhibit a capacitance of only 110 F g−1.110 Despite the extensive efforts in synthesis, the rational design of supercapacitive electrodes that meet the demands of large capacitance, high energy density and outstanding stability remains a considerable challenge.
We have developed a ring-fused CMP system for electric energy storage (Fig. 3, Aza-CMPs).53 Aza-CMPs have four significant structural features: (1) conductive fused CMP frameworks, (2) aza units in the skeletons that enable dipolar interaction with electrolyte cations and accumulate protons on the pore walls, (3) inherent micropores with optimized size that allow for quick ionic motion during charge–discharge processes and (4) high surface areas that provide large interfaces for the formation of electrostatic charge-separation layers in the pores. Ultimately, these structural features work cooperatively, leading to exceptional energy storage and power supply capacities.
Aza-CMPs are ionothermally synthesized by a condensation reaction of 1,2,4,5-tetraaminobenzene with triquinoyl hydrate at 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 °C, yielding Aza-CMP@300, Aza-CMP@350, Aza-CMP@400, Aza-CMP@450 and Aza-CMP@500, respectively. The specific capacitance depends highly on the synthesis temperature of the Aza-CMP. Aza-CMP@450 exhibits the highest capacitance of 946 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 among the five Aza-CMPs. Other members also exhibit high capacitances of 549–818 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. However, Aza-CMP@500, which has small pores, does not retain this capacitance, particularly when the current density increases up to 5 and 10 A g−1. Similarly, the capacitance of Aza-CMP@300, with a low surface area of 24 m2 g−1, exhibits a significant decrease from 419 to 263 F g−1 when the current density increases from 2 to 5 A g−1. The decrement is more explicit at the current density of 10 A g−1, with a sharp drop to 93 F g−1. This decremental tendency originates from the inhibition of ionic motion caused by small pores and low surface area. In contrast, Aza-CMP@350, with relatively large surface area (546 m2 g−1) and large pore size (1.4 nm), retains a large capacitance of 397 F g−1 at the current density of 5 A g−1. Of interest, Aza-CMP@350 can be operated at a high current density of 10 A g−1 to achieve a large capacitance of 378 F g−1, which allows for a rapid charge and power supply.
Impedance measurements provide insight into the supercapacitive energy storage and power supply using Aza-CMPs. The structural factors of Aza-CMPs work cooperatively in energy storage. Aza-CMPs that combine suitable pore size, high surface area and low interfacial resistance facilitate charge accumulation and ion motion and thus endow the framework with outstanding supercapacitive functions. As a result of their ring-fused structures, the Aza-CMPs are highly stable for cycling, exhibiting no loss in capacitance after 10000 cycles.
The specific capacitance of Aza-CMPs is four times as high as that of activated carbon (<270 F g−1). Aza-CMPs are superior to nitrogen-enriched carbons (50–330 F g−1) and outperform the state-of-the-art nanostructured carbons, including template porous carbons (120–350 F g−1), graphenes (120 F g−1), carbon nanotubes (50–120 F g−1) and carbon fibers (120–370 F g−1). Their capacitance is even greater than the highest values for supercapacitors (720 F g−1) with the redox-active ruthenium oxide electrode. A Ragone plot reveals that Aza-CMPs exhibit the maximum energy and power densities of 53 W h kg−1 and 2.25 kW kg−1, respectively. The energy density is higher than those of nanostructured porous carbons and reaches the regime of such batteries as Pb-acid, NiCd and lithium ion (10–150 W h kg−1). The powder densities of Aza-CMPs are more than one order of magnitude higher than those of batteries (<0.3 kW kg−1). These outstanding results demonstrate the enormous potential of CMPs for energy storage applications.
5. Summary and concluding remarks
CMPs are a unique class of polymers that inherently combine π conjugation with porosity. The diversity of chemical reactions, the availability of building blocks and the variety of synthetic methods give rise to the generation of CMPs with different structures and functions. The flexibility of molecular design and the tunability of structure endow CMPs with ‘predesignable’ characteristics, although they are amorphous materials without long-range molecular ordering. The experimental efforts in the past few years on the design, synthesis and functional exploration have allowed for the rapid growth of this field.
As a platform for designing porous materials, CMPs provide a powerful means for tuning the porosity, pore environment and functionality. Achieving high surface areas over 3000 m2 g−1 remains a considerable challenge. CMPs with well-defined pore sizes or controlled pore size distributions are of similar importance for selective gas adsorption. Precise control over functional groups on the pore surface would bring a new chemistry-based aspect to the study of CMPs. Progress in these directions would enable the preparation of CMPs with controlled pore size and tailor-made pore functions, which are essential for targeting specific gases or chemicals.
As a platform for designing π-conjugated materials, CMPs are useful for developing 3D networks that allow exciton migration and carrier transport. The synthesis of low-bandgap CMPs is of particular importance but remains difficult. The methodologies and/or molecular architectures that enhance charge carrier mobility and electric conductivity are highly desirable for electronic and photoelectric applications. In this sense, systematic investigations are essential for clarifying the structure–property correlation, which remains unclear in many CMPs. Similarly, the charge dynamics in these 3D CMP networks is another important aspect to be explored.
As a platform for designing synergistic systems, CMPs enable the complementary exploration of π-conjugated skeletons and inherent nanopores. If different functionalities, such as light-harvesting antennae, redox-active modules and catalytic centers, can be hierarchically merged in the skeleton, the resulting CMPs may function as an artificial photosynthetic system that couples an energy conversion system with the mass transformation process. This intriguing aspect is worthy of further study.
In summary, CMPs are a fascinating class of materials with great potential for applications. The past efforts on the design, synthesis and functional exploration have demonstrated that CMPs are a versatile platform for structural and functional designs, which will continuously drive the further advancement of this emerging field. We anticipate a bright and promising future for CMPs, with their utility as a powerful platform to solve challenging environmental and energy issues.
