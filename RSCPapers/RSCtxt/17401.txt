    , Accepted 27th October 2019First published on 31st October 2019AbstractNH3 synthesis via the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has been regarded as a sustainable strategy for fertilizer production and hydrogen fuel storage and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The faradaic efficiency (FE) and reaction rate of the NRR, however, are still low for current electrocatalysts. Herein, we develop a metal-free B, N co-doped porous carbon nanofiber (B/N–CNF) that exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for the NRR in an alkaline electrolyte with the highest FE of 13.2% at −0.5 V and a NH3 yield rate of 32.5 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.7 V. Such a high NRR activity of the B/N–CNF is superior to that of N- or B-doped carbon materials in the literature. The experimental results reveal that the B–N bonds play a critical role in the NRR process, in which N atoms promote the electron conductivity and B atoms efficiently enhance the N2 adsorption and charge transfer.
The electrochemical reduction reaction of nitrogen to ammonia has been widely investigated as a potential technology to overcome the thermodynamic barrier of high-temperature and high-pressure needed for the industrial Haber–Bosch process.1–4 At present, noble metal-based materials, such as Au,5–7 Ru,8,9 and Pd,10–12 have been demonstrated as efficient electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR); however their expensive cost isn't in favor of industrial production.13 To address the disadvantages of noble metal-based catalysts, transition metal (Mo,14–16 Fe,17–20 Nb,21,22etc.) oxides,23 sulfides,15,24 nitrides,25 and carbides26 have been explored due to their low cost and abundant storage. Nonetheless, it is well known that transition metal compounds are also good electrocatalysts27,28 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of excellent conductivity and low hydrogen binding energy29–31 and thus negatively impact the NRR performance.
Recently, heteroatom (e.g., B, N, P, and S) doped carbon materials32,33 have become a research focus as metal-free electrocatalysts owing to their good electrochemical stability and high electronic conductivity.34–36 As reported previously, N-doped carbon materials could induce the protonated pyridinic N and adjacent atomic vacancy site, which are in favor of N2 adsorption.37 Besides, on account of charge density difference,38 B-doped carbon materials could induce inhomogeneity for carbon to adsorb N2 molecules. Compared with single heteroatom dopants,3,39,40 heteroatom co-doping could bring in charge redistribution of carbon, which can facilitate the chemisorption of N2 molecules and electron transfer. Herein, we reported a metal-free B and N co-doped porous carbon nanofiber (B/N–CNF) fabricated by an electrospinning and calcination strategy. The contents of B and N dopants for the B/N–CNF were 29.9% and 27.6%, respectively. Benefitting from a high surface area of 748 m2 g−1 and synergistic effect between B and N dopants, the B/N–CNF exhibited a high electrocatalytic activity for the NRR in a basic electrolyte, achieving the highest FE of 13.2% at −0.5 V and the NH3 yield rate of 32.5 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.7 V. Such a high NRR activity was superior to that of most of the previously reported B- or N-doped carbon materials. It was found that B atoms facilitated the cleavage of NN bonds, and the N atoms enhanced the electronic conductivity of CNF nanofibers.
The synthesis process of the B/N–CNF is shown in Fig. 1a. In brief, boric acid and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) were first mixed together and dissolved in N,N-dimethyl formamide to obtain the B-PAN CNF via electrospinning. The resulting B-PAN CNF was thermally treated at 250 °C for 2 h under air and a higher temperature for subsequent 2 h under NH3 to form the B/N–CNF. The effects of calcination temperature (700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C, and 1000 °C) were systematically investigated, and 900 °C was identified to be the best temperature.

The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of the B/N–CNF showed the typical morphology of the cross-linked carbon networks composed of nanofibers with a diameter of ∼100 nm (Fig. 1b). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1c) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images demonstrated that the B/N–CNF consisted of amorphous and graphitized carbons with a lattice fringe of around 3.4 Å (Fig. 1d), consistent with the (002) plane of graphic carbon. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern further revealed the partial graphitization features of the B/N–CNF with the (002) and (100) planes of carbon (inset of Fig. 1d). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the B/N–CNF showed two obvious peaks located at 26° and 44° (Fig. S1†), which are indexed to the (002) and (100) planes of graphite, respectively. Raman spectra of the B/N–CNF (Fig. 1e) displayed a D-band at 1350 cm−1 and a G-band at 1580 cm−1 with an ID/IG ratio of 1.29. Compared with the B/N–CNF, both N- and B-doped carbon nanofibers (N–CNF and B–CNF) exhibited lower ID/IG values of 0.99 and 1.04, indicating that the B/N co-doping increased defects and vacancies of CNFs. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of the B/N–CNF demonstrated four peaks centered at 190.8 eV, 284.6 eV, 397.9 eV, and 530.5 eV (Fig. S2†), corresponding to B 1s, C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s, respectively, confirming the success co-doping of B and N elements into CNFs. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the B/N–CNF (Fig. S3†) showed the out-of-plane stretching of B–N–B bending modes located at 1380 cm−1 and the in-plane B–N bond stretch modes located at 765 cm−1.41 The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curve (Fig. 1f) of the B/N–CNF exhibited a high BET specific surface area of 748 m2 g−1 and a mesopore structure with a pore diameter of around 4 nm and volume of ∼0.39 cm3 g−1 (inset of Fig. 1f).
The electrocatalytic activity of the B/N–CNF for the NRR was investigated in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte in a two-compartment cell with a standard three-electrode system. For comparison, the N–CNF and B–CNF were also tested. The potentials were referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).42 As shown in Fig. 2a, between −0.5 V and −0.7 V, the chronoamperometric curves of the B/N–CNF showed no obvious current drop within 2 h of reaction, indicating good stability of the catalysts. During the electrochemical NRR process, the NH3 product was measured by an indophenol blue method,4 and the N2H4 by-product was spectrophotometrically quantitated by the Watt and Chrisp method (Fig. S4 and S5†).43Fig. 2b shows the FEs and NH3 yields at different applied potentials, where the highest FE value of 13.2% at −0.5 V and NH3 yield of 32.5 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.7 V were obtained for the B/N–CNF. With the decrease in potential, FE values also dropped because of the competitive HER. Notably, no N2H4 could be detected after the electrocatalytic NRR (Fig. S6 and S7†), further confirming the high NRR selectivity of the B/N–CNF.

As shown in Fig. 2c and d, the FE values of the B/N–CNF were much higher than those of the N–CNF and B–CNF over the whole potential range. The highest FE of 13.2% at −0.5 V for the B/N–CNF was 15 times higher than that of the N–CNF (0.9%) and 3.8 times than that of the B–CNF (3.5%), respectively. The corresponding maximum NH3 yield of 32.5 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 for the B/N–CNF was nearly 5.2 times higher than that of the N–CNF (6.2 μg h−1 mgcat.−1) and 3.6 times higher than that of the B–CNF (9.1 μg h−1 mgcat.−1). These results demonstrated the existence of the synergistic effect between B and N atoms. Importantly, the high FE value of 13.2% for the B/N CNF was superior to that of almost all previously reported carbon based NRR electrocatalysts with single N-doping or B-doping (Fig. 2e), including, N-doped porous carbon44 (FE = 1.4% at −0.9 V), N-doped carbon nanospikes40 (FE = 11.6% at −1.19 V), MOF-derived N-doped nanoporous carbon37 (FE = 10.2% at −0.2 V), B-doped graphene38 (FE = 10.8% at −0.5 V), N, P co-doped carbon45 (FE = 4.2% at −0.2 V), Fe2O3–CNT46 (FE = 0.2% at −1.0 V), and even comparable to that of noble metal catalysts47 (Table S1†). Considering the importance of the stability of electrocatalysts, continuous recycling tests are initiated at −0.5 V, and the results showed almost no obvious decline in both the FE and NH3 yield after eight cycles, suggesting the excellent stability of the B/N–CNF.
To further investigate the electrocatalytic NRR performance, a series of background measurements were conducted in Ar and N2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solutions. As shown in Fig. 3a, the current density of the B/N–CNF in a N2-saturated solution was higher than that in an Ar-saturated solution. The absorbance of electrolyte after reacting with N2 and Ar saturated solutions illustrated the corresponding NH3 yields (inset of Fig. 3a). Since trace amounts of ammonia may exist in air, electrolyte or the electrode surface, there is a small value of absorbance under Ar as the background. 15N isotopic experiments were conducted to verify the fact that the detected NH3 was completely produced during the NRR. As shown in Fig. S8,† only a distinguishable chemical shift of doublet coupling that is originated to the 15NH4+ was determined by 1H NMR spectra, and the 14NH4+ was detected from the electrochemical NRR using 14N2 as the feed gas, as well. Also, no any peaks about 14NH4+ and 15NH4+ under Ar conditions were observed. These results clearly demonstrated that the B/N–CNF can efficiently convert N2 into NH3via the NRR.11 As shown in Fig. 3b, the NRR partial current density of the B/N–CNF was much higher than that of the N–CNF and B–CNF. For instance, the NRR partial current density of the B/N–CNF was 56.14 μA cm−2 at −0.70 V, much higher than that of the N–CNF (2.35 μA cm−2) and B–CNF (10.59 μA cm−2), which further demonstrated the synergistic effect of B and N dopants. A lower Tafel slope (Fig. 3c) of 202 mV dec−1 for the B/N–CNF was observed, as compared with that of the N–CNF (211 mV dec−1) and B–CNF (233 mV dec−1), respectively, revealing that the B/N–CNF more efficiently suppresses the HER. The fast reaction kinetics of the NRR on the B/N–CNF was further supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, in which the B/N–CNF displayed a much smaller charge transfer resistance than the B–CNF (Fig. 3d), but higher than the N–CNF, indicating that the N dopant mainly contributed to the improved electron conductivity of the B/N–CNF. The electrochemical double layer capacitances of the B/N–CNF, N–CNF, and B–CNF are shown in Fig. 3e, where the B/N–CNF possessed the highest capacitance of 6.7 mF cm−2, over six times that of the B–CNF and two times that of the N–CNF, suggesting the highly exposed active sites of the B/N–CNF. The long-term activity stability of the B/N–CNF was further investigated, and the results showed that no any change in current density was observed for the B/N–CNF after the 18 h continuous NRR process, indicating a long-time superior stability (Fig. 3f). Moreover, the HRTEM images of the B/N–CNF before and after the electrochemical NRR process also supported the robust stability (inset of Fig. 3f), which is beneficial for large-scale applications in industrial.

To further explore the intrinsic catalytic mechanism of the B/N–CNF, control NRR experiments and additional XPS measurements of B/N–CNF samples prepared at different calcination temperatures of 700 °C (B/N–CNF-700), 800 °C (B/N–CNF-800), and 1000 °C (B/N–CNF-1000) were conducted. The contents of B and N co-dopants of B/N–CNF samples increased with the calcination temperatures (Table S2†) due to more significant gasification of carbon at higher temperatures. Further, the NRR catalytic activities of B/N–CNF samples were tremendously influenced by the contents of B and N co-dopants (Fig. 4a). As such, the highest FE value of 13.2% for the B/N–CNF appeared at −0.5 V, higher than that of the B/N–CNF-700 (10.5%), B/N–CNF-800 (11.9%), and B/N–CNF-1000 (2.8%). Likewise, at −0.7 V, the B/N–CNF exhibited the highest NH3 yield of 32.5 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 (Fig. 4d), compared with the B/N–CNF-700 (6.9 μg h−1 mgcat.−1), B/N–CNF-800 (24.2 μg h−1 mgcat.−1), and B/N–CNF-1000 (29.4 μg h−1 mgcat.−1), respectively. Although both the B/N–CNF and B/N–CNF-1000 exhibited similar contents of B and N co-doping, the NRR activity of the B/N–CNF was obviously superior to that of B/N–CNF-1000, which indicated that the doping configuration plays an additional role in the NRR activity. Inspired by the previously well-investigated DFT results,48 a possible mechanism of nitrogen reduction was proposed in this work. First, the N2 molecule is adsorbed on the B/N–CNF surface, followed by proton and electron transfer forming intermediate products of *N2Hy (1 < y < 4) species. When one proton and electron transferred to *N2H4, a free NH3 molecule is formed together with *NH2 species.49 By adding another proton and electron to the *NH2, the second NH3 molecule can be further produced to complete the NH3 production via the NRR process.

To further investigate the specific doping configuration of B and N dopants, both high-revolution N 1s and B 1s XPS spectra were recorded. For the B/N–CNF, the N 1s XPS spectrum could be divided into three different types of N species (Fig. 4b), including B–N (N1, 397.8 eV), pyridinic N (N2, 398.4 eV), and pyrrolic N (N3, 399.5 eV).37 In Fig. 4c, it can be cleanly seen that the content of pyrrolic N decreases with increasing calcination temperatures from 700 °C to 1000 °C. In contrast, the content of B–N bonds follows an opposite trend: the portion of B–N bonds increases as the calcination temperature increases. At 900 °C, the content of B–N bonds of the B/N–CNF achieves the maximum value of 14.3%, followed by a small decrease at 1000 °C. The chemical state of B moieties in the B/N–CNF was further investigated. In Fig. 4e, the B 1s XPS spectrum was divided into four different types of B species, corresponding to BC3 (B1, 189.8 eV), B–N (B2, 190.6 eV), BC2O (B3, 191.2 eV), and BCO2 (B4, 192.3 eV).41 The percentages of B–N bonds are nearly 14.0% for the B/N–CNF and B/N–CNF-1000 (Fig. 4f), which are much higher than those of B/N–CNF-700 (2.4%) and B/N–CNF-800 (6.4%). Based on these results, one can conclude that B–N bonds acted as the main active sites for the NRR.
An electrolyzer was built using the B/N–CNF as the cathodic electrocatalyst and commercial Ir/C as the anodic material with 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte in a two-electrode system. As shown in Fig. 5a, the B/N–CNF//Ir/C couple delivered a current density of 1.2 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 3.0 V and a long-term robust stability for the NRR-OER (inset of Fig. 5a). Furthermore, the B/N–CNF//Ir/C couple electrodes displayed excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the NRR-OER with a potential of 3.06 V to acquire a current density of 1.27 mA cm−2 powered by two AA-size alkaline batteries and a remarkable long-time stability (>10 h, Fig. 5b). Without additional applied potential, the NRR-OER device (Fig. 5c) could be further powered by a commercial solar panel under chopped simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The current density of the B/N–CNF//Ir/C recorded in Fig. 5d was stable and corresponded well with the on–off cycles at the given potentials (2.5 V, 3.0 V, and 3.5 V). Therefore, the NRR-OER device was not only powered by alkaline batteries, but also by the commercial solar panel, which makes the application of the B/N–CNF electrocatalyst in the industrial production possible.

Conclusion
In summary, a metal-free porous B/N–CNF with 29.9% of B and 27.6% of N dopants was developed through the electrospinning and subsequent calcination treatments. The B/N–CNF delivered superior catalytic activity for the electrochemical NRR, exhibiting the highest FE of 13.2% at −0.5 V and NH3 yield of 32.5 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.7 V in basic electrolytes. The high NRR performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect between B and N co-dopants. The FE value of the B/N–CNF was almost the highest among all previously reported carbon-based materials with single N- or B-doping. Control NRR experiments illustrated that the excellent NRR catalytic activity of the B/N–CNF was mainly due to the formation of B–N bonds, which acted as the active sites. B atoms could contribute to facilitating N2 adsorption and further electron transfer to produce NH3, while the N atoms could enhance electron conductivity. Moreover, an electrolyzer with the B/N–CNF as the cathode and commercial Ir/C as the anode was successfully fabricated to confirm the NRR activity of the B/N–CNF driven by alkaline batteries and solar panels. The developed B/N–CNF presented in this work paves a promising pathway for rational design of highly efficient dual heteroatom doped carbon materials for not only NRR, but also other electrochemical energy conversion reactions.
