    , Accepted 19th October 2018First published on 22nd October 2018AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites are desirable candidates for application in photovoltaics and lasing. However, enhancing the lasing performances of these perovskites with a lower threshold and higher quality factor is still a challenging issue. Thus, herein, we fabricated a Fabry–Pérot resonator using an active layer of novel C(NH2)3PbI3:Tm thin films with a reflecting layer of cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC), spacer layers of Al2O3 and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and back reflecting layer of Au to improve the lasing performances of hybrid halide perovskites. The incorporation of thulium further improved the optical properties of the C(NH2)3PbI3 perovskite thin films by enhancing the insertion of organic and inorganic molecules. Furthermore, the introduction of a cholesteric liquid crystal layer greatly enhanced the single-mode lasing performances of GAPbI3:Tm with a low threshold of 0.70 μJ cm−2. Interestingly, the Fabry–Pérot resonator of CLC/Al2O3/C(NH2)3PbI3:Tm/P3HT/Au achieved a high quality factor of 2500. This work proves the potential of C(NH2)3PbI3:Tm perovskites in lasing. Therefore, rare earth element-incorporated guanidinium lead iodide can result in a dramatic change in future lasing applications owing to its desirable optical properties.
1. Introduction
The rapid development in organic–inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) have enabled high efficiency and low cost solar cells owing to their superior properties such as high absorption co-efficient, tunable band gap, and balanced long-range electron/hole transport lengths.1 Hence, they have been further employed in LEDs and lasing from whispering gallery cavities, distributed feedback resonators and bulk perovskite faceted crystals.2,3 Importantly, a photoluminescence quantum efficiency of about 70% with a lasing threshold of 7 μJ cm−2 has been confirmed in flexible cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) reflector-based MAPbI3 perovskites, which indicates their capability in laser devices.2 To date, the optically pumped lasing behaviors of well-defined perovskites have been demonstrated by single crystalline MAPbI3 nanostructures with regular cavity shapes, which support Fabry–Pérot or whispering gallery mode cavity lasers.4,5 Besides single crystalline perovskite nanowires, nanodisks and nanoplatelets, lasing has also been achieved in polycrystalline films.
Initially, Xing et al. fabricated solution-processed perovskite thin films as an optical gain medium for lasing, which attained a threshold of 12 μJ cm−2 and opened a wide range of opportunities in photonic applications.3 Subsequently, in 2014, Deschler et al. observed the out-of-plane cavity modes from a vertical cavity under the excitation of a pulsed laser at room temperature, in which the perovskite film was sandwiched between a gold mirror and Bragg reflector, thus achieving multimode lasing behaviors.2 Moreover, Samuel D. Stranks et al. reported enhanced amplified spontaneous emissions (ASE) from a CH3NH3PbI3 thin film-based resonator cavity with a reflecting layer of CLC.6 Also, multimode lasing behaviors were observed by Hyunhee Choi et al. from a resonator with broadband CLC Bragg reflectors.7 Songtao Chen et al. achieved photonic crystal lasing from solution based organo-lead halide perovskite thin films with a threshold of 68.5 μJ cm−2.8 Thermally and electrically tunable lasing and amplified spontaneous emissions were attained by Lin-Jer Chen et al. from a composite of inorganic quantum dot nanocrystals and organic cholesteric liquid crystals.9 In 2016, Tsung Sheng Kao et al. achieved multimode lasing from CH3NH3PbI3 thin films on a glass substrate.10 In addition, Qing Zhang et al. demonstrated a new family of planar room temperature NIR nanolasers and whispering gallery mode lasing in 2016 from CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br and I) and CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br and I) perovskite nanoplatelets, respectively.11,12 In 2017, the lasing properties of various perovskites and the rapid advances in small lasers based on perovskite nanostructures were reviewed and reported.13
However, the above reports have yielded multimode lasing behaviors with high lasing thresholds and low quality factors due to Auger recombination loss14 and not beneficial for practical applications. In addition, the defect sites at the interfaces and boundaries of thin films as well as irregular morphologies also reduce the lasing performances due to scattering loss.15 Indeed, most of the aforementioned works have noted the important role of morphology in device performances.16,17 Therefore, the occurrence of single mode lasing with a lower threshold and higher Q-factor in hybrid halide perovskite thin films for practical applications is still a challenging issue. Thus, (i) to improve the lasing performances of hybrid halide perovskites, a novel guanidinium as substituted in the site of methyl ammonium for the formation of C(NH2)3PbI3 (GAPbI3) thin films. Accordingly, the versatility of the organic part generally afforded the possibility of fine tuning material properties, which affects the optical properties of the perovskites, resulting in improved optical efficiency.18 (ii) To solve the morphological problems, the rare earth element of thulium was incorporated into the lead site of perovskite, which enhanced the insertion of organic iodide into the inorganic iodide, resulting in complete transformation of GAPbI3 with a well-defined morphology and desirable roughness. Importantly, the incorporation of thulium not only offers a favorable morphology, but also improves the emission properties of GAPbI3via an increment in the oscillator strength of perovskite. (iii) To solve the problem of Auger recombination loss and further enhance the lasing performances of Tm-doped GAPbI3 perovskite thin films, a Fabry–Pérot (F–P) resonator was fabricated with a reflecting layer of CLC, which is promising to achieve desirable lasing performances. Moreover, changing the structure of the device is a desirable way to reduce Auger recombination loss. In the past decades, CLC has attracted much attention in the field of optoelectronic devices owing to its unique optical properties and desirable structure. CLC offers selective light reflection, which is one its important features.19 Moreover, CLC thin films have been yielded the maximum reflection, which is beneficial to improve the lasing performances of perovskite-based F–P resonators.20
In this work, we report for the first time, the single-mode lasing performances of a novel GAPbI3:Tm thin film (active layer)-based F–P resonator with two spacer layers of P3HT and Al2O3, reflecting layer of CLC and back reflecting layer of Au. To the best of our knowledge, the present work has never been reported. The lasing performances of the Tm-doped GAPbI3 hybrid halide perovskite based F–P resonator are greatly improved with a lower threshold and higher quality factor compared to both MAPbI3 and without device stacking. The enhancement mechanisms of lasing are also discussed clearly through both experimental and simulation methods. Hence, this work offers a key route to achieve high performance laser devices with GAPbI3:Tm, which is a promising candidate for future lasing applications.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of undoped and Tm-doped GAPbI3 thin films
All chemicals were commercially available and utilized without further purification. In a typical process for the formation of the perovskite thin films, an equimolar ratio (1:1) of guanidinium iodide (C(NH2)3I) and lead iodide (PbI2) was dissolved in 5 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) to form a mixed guanidinium lead triiodide solution (C(NH2)3PbI3). Then, the solution was stirred at 30 °C for 24 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After stirring, the perovskite solution was dispensed on glass substrates and spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s. Then, the deposited films were dried at 60 °C for 15 min, and the resulting films were black in color. In the doping process, thulium iodide was incorporated into PbI2 solution and GAPbI3:Tm thin films were fabricated following the above procedure.
2.2 Fabrication of device stack as Fabry–Pérot resonator
Initially, liquid crystals of RM-257 (97 wt%), chiral dopant of LC-765 (3 wt%), photoinitiator of Irgacure 651 (1 wt%) and surfactant of 2-n-ethylperfluoro-octanesulfonamido-ethyl methacrylate (1 wt%) were dissolved in 1.5 wt% of xylene under constant stirring at 50 °C for 1 h to obtain the cholesteric liquid crystal solution (CLC). Subsequently, the mixed solution was spin-coated on well-cleaned glass substrates at 2000 rpm for 30 s and then polymerized under the illumination of UV light for 5 min, thus yielding a reflector layer of CLC. In the formation of the spacer layer of Al2O3, aluminum chloride (AlCl3·6H2O) was dissolved in isopropanol with glacial acidic acid and stirred at room temperature under an air atmosphere for 1 h to obtain a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the substrate with a CLC layer was coated with the above homogeneous solution via a dip coating method and dried at 300 °C for 10 min and then annealed at 600 °C for 1 h to obtain the Al2O3 spacer layer. Then, the perovskite of Tm-doped GAPbI3 thin film was deposited on the Al2O3 layer according to the abovementioned procedure. Subsequently, P3HT in chlorobenzene was spin-coated on the perovskite layer and dried at 80 °C for 5 minutes to obtain another spacer layer of P3HT. Finally, the gold back reflector was evaporated on the P3HT layer via the electron beam evaporation method.
2.3 Optical simulation
Herein, FDTD simulation was used to display the electronic field distributions of the F–P resonator in the presence and absence of CLC. During this process, a plane source in ranging between 700 and 800 nm was used as the light source. The perovskite layer was sandwiched between two Al2O3 spacer layers and P3HT. The thickness of the CLC, Al2O3, perovskite, P3HT and Au layers was 300 nm, 120 nm, 100 nm, 120 nm and 8 nm, respectively. A electronic field monitor with a wavelength of 780.1 nm was used to record the mode properties.
2.4 Characterization
X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) spectra of the perovskite thin films were recorded using an Ultimate IV X-ray diffractometer (Kyowaglasxa, H-12, Japan and λ = 1.5406) with Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 0.026 degree s−1 in the 2θ range of 10–60°. Surface morphology was studied using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Carl Zeiss Ultra plus). Photoluminescence, ASE and lasing spectra for all the films and device stacks were recorded using a Micro PL system with an optical microscope (OLYMPUS BX53F) and optical multichannel analyzer (SP2500i) under an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Formation of pure and Tm-doped GAPbI3 thin films

Fig. 1a shows the XRD spectra of the pure and Tm-doped GAPbI3 thin films on glass substrates with various doping concentrations. As can be seen, all the diffraction peaks match well with the tetragonal phase of GAPbI3 with the absence of impurity phases.21,22 Moreover, the Goldschmidt's tolerance factor (t > 1) obeys the tetragonal crystal structure of GAPbI3. Interestingly, the peak positions are red-shifted in GAPbI3 compared to MAPbI3 due to the larger C(NH2)3+ cation.23 When the Tm dopant was introduced and the doping concentration increased, there was no change in crystal structure, but the peak intensities slightly decreased, which indicates the formation of strain due to the incorporation of thulium. Specifically, these results confirm the successful incorporation of thulium into the lattice sites of perovskite. Concomitantly, a shift in the peak position values was also identified with an increase in the dopant concentration. The peak positions slightly shifted to the lower angle side with an increase in doping concentration from 1 at% to 3 at% and then moved to the higher angle side with a further increase in doping concentration up to 5 at%. The variations in peak intensity and 2θ values with respect to doping concentration are clearly depicted in Fig. 1b. The lower angle shift corresponds to lattice expansion; whereas, the higher angle shift is ascribed to lattice shrinkage in the perovskite.24 The lattice constants and volumes prove the lattice expansion and shrinkage, which are listed in Table 1. When the doping concentration of Tm increased from 1 at% to 3 at%, the lattice constant values increased and then decreased with a further increase in doping concentration up to 5 at%. The lattice volumes also exhibited the same trend. Accordingly, the optimum concentration of thulium for the lattice sites of GAPbI3 was determined to be 3 at%. In addition, the perovskite structure is stable in the presence of rare earth ions due to lattice defects, and similar behavior was also observed in previous literature.25

The surface morphology of thin films plays a vital role in the long-term performances of perovskites through proper control of grain size and shape.26 The SEM images of the pure and Tm-doped GAPbI3 thin films on glass substrates are presented in Fig. 2a and b. As can be seen, the crystalline grains are uniformly distributed on the entire surface of the substrate and closely arranged without any pinholes and voids. In particular, Fig. 2a exhibits homogeneously distributed spherical-like grains with a rough surface. The unnecessary roughness is related to the penetration of the GAI solution into the holes of PbI2, which leads to simultaneous reaction on the surface and interstitial PbI2.27 Concomitantly, the GAPbI3:Tm thin films on glass substrate exhibited greater homogeneity with a smooth surface, as shown in Fig. 2b. This is due to the desirable insertion of GAI into the PbI2 lattice sites in the presence of thulium. The grains look like closely-packed flower petals. Furthermore, it can be apparently noted that the grain size increased whereas the roughness decreased compared to pure GAPbI3. The SEM results indicate that the morphologies of these perovskite films are beneficial for lasing.

Fig. 2c depicts the EDX spectrum of the Tm (3 at%)-doped GAPbI3 thin film and the inserted table presents the compositional percentages of the pure and Tm (3 at%)-doped GAPbI3 thin films. The spectrum exhibits the presence of C, N, Pb, I and Tm elements in the films with a stoichiometric ratio. Specifically, there is a regular distribution of all the elements throughout the compound. The presence of Tm element confirms the penetration of the dopant element into the lattice sites of GAPbI3. In particular, the decrement in percentage of Pb in the Tm-doped GAPbI3 thin films compared to the pure GAPbI3 thin film indicates the successful incorporation of Tm into the perovskite lattice sites.
The optical behaviors of organo-metallic perovskites are generally accumulated by both inorganic and organic components. The metal cation is equivalent to a quantum well structure with a small band gap when an inorganic anion acts as a barrier. Both are coupled to each other, resulting in exciton formation and a strong binding energy.28 In addition, the iodide halide ions are used to enable the adjustment of spectral position for a particular optical transition. Fig. 3 presents the photoluminescence spectra of the undoped and Tm-doped GAPbI3 thin films with different doping concentrations, which were recorded at a wavelength ranging between 700 and 900 nm under an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. As can be seen, the emission peak of the undoped GAPbI3 is located at 761.1 nm with a corresponding band gap value of 1.62 eV from the interband transition between electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band. The obtained strong emission peak even at room temperature is due to the interactions of the organic Frenkel and inorganic Weiner excitons with closer bands, which lead to quenching of the inorganic exciton, resulting in strong emissions from organic guanidinium.29
 Fig. 3  Emission spectra for the pure and Tm-doped GAPbI3 thin films with different doping concentrations under an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. 
When the dopant element of thulium was introduced in the GAPbI3 thin film and the doping concentration increased from 1 at% to 3 at%, the peak intensity values increased. The number of lattice sites replaced by the thulium ions can lead to a state of valence compensation. This charge compensation in the crystal system is of prime importance for enhanced photoluminescence properties.30,31 Concomitantly, the peak intensity values decreased apparently with a further increase in doping concentration above 3 at% due to the concentration quenching effect, which matched well with the X-ray diffraction results. Under this condition, thulium acted as a trapping center, and consequently, the excess energy dissipated non-radiatively.32,33 Moreover, the peak position value of the doped films red-shifted to 764.3 nm compared to the undoped films due to lattice defects.
3.2 ASE behaviors of GAPbI3:Tm thin films
The ASE spectra of the GAPbI3:Tm thin film on a glass substrate under an excitation wavelength of 532 nm with various excitation power densities are presented in Fig. 4a, where it can be noted that the ASE peak appeared at 784.94 nm for an excitation power density of 23.56 μJ cm−2. It is well known that the waveguide structure plays a significant role in the high performance ASE devices.34 The desirable peak intensities of ASE for the GAPbI3:Tm thin films were attained due to the incorporation of thulium into the lattice sites of perovskite. The rare earth elements can enhance the luminescence properties of perovskite materials due to their beneficial optical properties, including large stimulated emission cross-section, high quantum efficiency and strong absorption band.35,36 The substitution of thulium increases the defect concentration at the lead sites, which leads to local tetragonal distortion due to octahedral tilting. This increase in local asymmetry is favorable for improved luminescent properties.37 Moreover, the smoother and well defined particles with uniform surface coverage can suppress the light scattering effect at the surface and internal area of thin films. This desirable film constructs a nearly perfect planar waveguide, which boosts the performances of ASE.38 Moreover, the ASE properties of the GAPbI3:Tm perovskite thin films were improved compared to the undoped GAPbI3, as depicted in Fig. S1(a) (ESI†).
 Fig. 4  (a) ASE spectra of the Tm-doped GAPbI3 thin film on a glass substrate with various excitation power densities under an excitation wavelength of 532 nm, (b) variation in output intensity and (c) variation in FWHM value with respect to excitation power density for the Tm-doped GAPbI3 thin film. 
In both the doped and undoped perovskites, the intensities of ASE increased significantly, whereas the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values decreased slightly with an increase in excitation power density from 23.56 to 27.89 μJ cm−2 and from 33.11 to 36.93 μJ cm−2 for GAPbI3:Tm and GAPbI3, respectively. The variation in intensity value with respect to excitation power density for the Tm-doped GAPbI3 is depicted in Fig. 4b. Thus figure indicates that the threshold decreased compared to the previous literature on MAPbI3 due to the improved properties of the GAPbI3:Tm thin film with changes in electron phonon coupling as well as GAPbI3.38 In addition, the threshold of GAPbI3:Tm is lower than that of GAPbI3, as shown in Fig. S1(b) (ESI†). The threshold values of the Tm-doped and undoped GAPbI3 are 23.39 μJ cm−2 and 32.99 μJ cm−2, respectively. According to the empirical Goldschmidt tolerance factor, it can be predicted that guanidinium (GA) cations, which have an ionic radius of 0.21 nm, are slightly too large to be incorporated into lead iodide cavities.39,40 Therefore, the insertion of GA cations into lead iodide was slightly lower in the undoped films compared to the Tm-doped GAPbI3. Interestingly, the presence of thulium dopant ions enhances the insertion of GAI into PbI2. Thus, the ASE properties are improved in the Tm-doped perovskite thin films compared to the undoped films.
Furthermore, the variation in FWHM value with respect to excitation power density for the GAPbI3:Tm thin film is presented in Fig. 4c. It can be noted that the FWHM value of GAPbI3:Tm is lower than that of GAPbI3, as depicted in Fig. S1(c) (ESI†). The FWHM values of the Tm-doped and undoped GAPbI3 thin films are 11.01 and 15.02 nm at the excitation power densities of 27.89 μJ cm−2 and 32.99 μJ cm−2, respectively. Importantly, the FWHM values of both the doped and undoped perovskite thin films decreased slightly compared to the previous literature on MAPbI3.38 Thus, it can be proposed that the rare earth element of thulium is a potential candidate for improving the ASE performances of perovskites.
3.3 ASE behaviors of GAPbI3:Tm thin films based F–P resonator
When P3HT was introduced as one of the spacer layers on the surface of the GAPbI3:Tm thin films, the ASE threshold and FWHM values decreased to 13.81 μJ cm−2 and 7.98 nm, respectively. The ASE spectra for glass/GAPbI3:Tm/P3HT are depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†), which prove the ability of P3HT to improve the optical performances of perovskite-based device stacks. To further reduce the ASE threshold of the GAPbI3:Tm thin films and yield a controllable device stack, two spacer layers of Al2O3 and P3HT were introduced with the metal reflecting layer of Au. Here, P3HT not only acted as a spacer layer but also protected the perovskite films from air and moisture. Moreover, Al2O3 is generally employed as an interfacial layer in fluorescent and up-conversional materials to enhance the efficiencies of their emissions.41 The surrounding spacer layers generally possess larger bandgaps and a smaller refractive index than that of the active gain layer, which are essential for providing both carrier and photon confinement in the active layer. The SEM image in Fig. 5a exhibits the uniform coverage and densely packed nature of the Al2O3 layer on the entire surface of the glass substrate without any voids. A schematic diagram of the structure of the controlled device stack as an F–P resonator is illustrated in Fig. 5b. Here, the perovskite layer is sandwiched between two spacer layers of Al2O3 and P3HT. The thicknesses of the Al2O3, perovskite, P3HT and Au layers are 120 nm, 100 nm, 120 nm and 8 nm, respectively. Fig. 5c represents the ASE spectra for the device stack of Al2O3/GAPbI3:Tm/P3HT/Au under an excitation wavelength of 532 nm with various excitation power densities. The occurrence of narrow emissions can be observed due to ASE rather than other narrowing mechanisms including superfluorescence and excitonic effects.42,43 The spontaneous emission (SE) peak intensity of Al2O3/GAPbI3:Tm/P3HT/Au at 763.50 nm improved gradually with an increase in excitation power density from 1.03 μJ cm−2 to 4.59 μJ cm−2 and the ASE was obtained at 780.01 nm with a further increase in excitation power density to 5.11 μJ cm−2. The SE and ASE peak positions of the controlled device stack were blue-shifted, whereas their intensities increased compared to that without the device stack.

Furthermore, the ASE intensities improved greatly, whereas the FWHM values decreased slightly with an increase in excitation power density from 5.11 μJ cm−2 to 7.89 μJ cm−2 for the device stack of Al2O3/GAPbI3:Tm/P3HT/Au. The variations in intensity value with respect to excitation power density for Al2O3/GAPbI3:Tm/P3HT/Au is depicted in Fig. 5d. From this figure, it can be noticed that the threshold of the controlled device stack decreased compared to that without the device stack, which was 4.86 μJ cm−2. Importantly, the threshold value is lower than that obtained from previously reported device stacks.6 Based on the present results, it can be speculated that the influence of the substrate on both crystallization and generation of surface defects plays a great role here, which leads to improved ASE performances.44,45 The variation in FWHM value with respect to excitation power density for the device stack of Al2O3/GAPbI3:Tm/P3HT/Au is also displayed in Fig. 5d. From this figure, it can be noted that the FWHM value decreased compared to that without the device stack, which was 5.42 nm.
The improved ASE performances for the device stack with Al2O3 as the spacer layer are consistent with the report by Tan et al., which stated that the substantial increment in quantum efficiency of a light emitting diode (LED) with the insertion of alumina as the under-layer is attributed to suppressed luminescence quenching at the device junction as well as the surface-induced structure of the perovskite layer.46 In addition, the ‘n’ doping from mesoporous alumina occurred to a lesser extent at the planar interface, which is ascribed to the filling of the non-radiative trap sites of electrons at the interface based on previous literature.47 The role of Al2O3 can be explained as follows: (i) the presence of a spacer layer of Al2O3 enhances the adhesion of the perovskite layer and (ii) when there is light incident on the sample, the emission signal generated along the entire length of the waveguide and the spacer layer of Al2O3 recovers the radiated light, which considerably enhances the intensity of the emission signal. More clearly, the pump beam travels along the spacer layer of Al2O3, while the signal beam is confined in the perovskite layer. The propagation of the pump beam in the sample generates carriers along the entire length of the waveguide. Consequently, a gain is produced in the waveguide when the excitation overcomes the threshold, thus improving the ASE performances.
The presence of another spacer layer of P3HT tunes the cavity photon mode closer to the wavelength of an exciton.48 Moreover, the resonance between the Frenkel excitons of P3HT and Frenkel–Wannier–Mott excitons of perovskite is also an important phenomenon for improved ASE performances. In particular, the Frenkel–Wannier–Mott hybrid exciton simultaneously has a larger exciton radius from the Wannier exciton as well as higher oscillator strength from the Frenkel exciton. The introduction of additional Frenkel excitons into perovskite from P3HT leads to a further improvement in the oscillator strength of the perovskite, resulting in improved ASE performances.49 In addition, the perovskite film can act as the active core of the planar waveguide without a polymer spacer layer. However, the propagation of the pump beam along the waveguide is restricted to a short distance due to the strong absorption of the perovskite material above its bandgap and strong attenuation. Consequently, the generated emitted light cannot overcome the intrinsic losses in the structure. On contrary, the presence of P3HT on the top of the perovskite layer enables end-fire coupling of the excitation laser through the planar waveguide with weak losses, which further enhances the ASE performances. Electron–hole recombination is dominant, whereas Auger recombination is negligible under such excitation condition. Thus, the results suggest that Al2O3 and P3HT are favorable spacer layer materials for perovskite-based device stacks.
3.4 Lasing behaviors of F–P resonator with CLC layer
To achieve the lasing spectra of the Tm-doped GAPbI3 perovskite thin films, a complete device stack was fabricated with the insertion of CLC as a reflecting layer, and Au acted as a back reflecting layer. A schematic diagram of the device stack as an F–P resonator is illustrated in Fig. 6a. Due to its complex structure, CLC possesses some advantageous properties for photonic applications, such as ultra-fast switching speeds, existence of 3D photonic band gap manifesting in Bragg reflections, no need of alignment layers in display devices and induced birefringence by external electric field (Kerr-like effect).50,51 Interestingly, CLC has also been considered as a promising reflecting layer material for MAPbI3- and GAPbI3-based F–P resonators due to its reflection, which is matched well with the emissions of both perovskites.6 Moreover, the back reflecting layer of Au reflects the perovskite emissions as well as optical excitation energy, which allows a second pass of optical excitation energy, resulting in enhanced absorption in the perovskite layer. Although CLC has multiple layers here through different deposition processes, they did not degrade or alter its properties, which indicate the robust nature of CLC to various processing conditions.

Fig. 6b represents the conversion of ASE into lasing spectra for CLC/Al2O3/GAPbI3:Tm/P3HT/Au as an F–P resonator with various excitation power densities under an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. It can be observed that the ASE appeared at 780.01 nm for the excitation power density of 0.71 μJ cm−2. With a further increase in the excitation power density up to 1.39 μJ cm−2, a single-mode lasing spectrum occurred. Importantly, the F–P resonator yielded the strongest lasing emissions owing to the presence of the CLC layer. The coherent multiple scattering from CLC produced a photonic band gap for light with same circular polarization and light transmission of opposite circular polarization unimpeded by the chiral structure.52 Hence, the new modes appeared at the band edge in the series of closely spaced narrow lasing peaks.
In addition, the ASE and lasing intensities of the F–P resonator increased dramatically, whereas its FWHM values decreased rapidly with an increase in excitation power density. The variation in intensity value with respect to excitation power density is illustrated in Fig. 6c. From this figure, it can be noted that the threshold (0.71 μJ cm−2) of the F–P resonator decreased compared to that obtained without a CLC layer, as shown in Fig. 5d. Here, the lowest threshold was achieved from the F–P resonator due to the introduction of a CLC layer, which is consistent with the combination of increased radiative rate and decreased Auger loss.53 Generally, lasing occurs for the guided wave modes, which propagate freely in the in-planes, and therefore it can be expected that the occurrence of a lower threshold is not based on the vertical cavity.54 In this case, the CLC reflector layer redirects the emission, which propagates along the out-of-plane cavities, whereas the oblique ones go back to the bulk. These behaviors lead to an enhanced optical path length in the medium, resulting in a lower threshold compared to the non-CLC device stack. Hence, the CLC layer enhances the wave-guiding capability of the Tm-doped perovskite films effectively and the yielded narrow gains are based on the contributions of the out-of-plane cavity modes.43 In addition, both the residence time for light within the CLC and opportunity for optically pumped stimulated emission are greatly enhanced at the band-edge modes and reduced within the stop band, which may also be caused a lower threshold.52
Furthermore, the variation in FWHM value with respect to excitation power density for the F–P resonator are also displayed in Fig. 6c. The FWHM value for the lasing spectrum of CLC/Al2O3/GAPbI3:Tm/P3HT/Au is 0.28 nm. Therefore, the Q-factor was calculated according to the equation: Q = λ/δλ, where, λ and δλ refer to the lasing mode wavelength and its FWHM value, respectively. The calculated Q-factor value is 2500 and the yielded Q-factor value is higher than that in previous literature on MAPbI3 perovskite thin films with GaN-based distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs).55 Moreover, the threshold value of this F–P resonator is lower than that in previous literature.56,57 Thus, to clearly understand the dramatic changes in ASE and lasing performances of the films and device stacks, the important parameters were compared in Table 2. To further understand the enhancement effect of lasing with respect to CLC, an FDTD simulation was performed, which is depicted in the ESI,† Fig. S3. It can be observed that the light reflected at the interface and formed light distributions in the F–P mode in the absence of CLC, as shown in Fig. S3(a) (ESI†). On the other hand, more light reflected in the F–P resonator when the reflecting layer of CLC was added, and the light distributions are represented in Fig. S3(b) (ESI†). CLC can reflect light back, which was proven by the simulation. This phenomenon is the main reason for the improvement in optical properties. Moreover, this is beneficial for the optical gain of the cavity, and subsequently, lasing can be realized.

The role of CLC in the improved lasing performances can be explained by the mechanism of the rapid exciton localization process. An exciton is a bound state, which consists of an electron and hole attracted by coulombic forces. It is one of the most elementary excitations and plays a key role in the optical emission and transport behavior of semiconductors. With presence of CLC in the resonator, a faster exciton localization process is completed before the formation of optical gain due to its natural photonic bandgaps. This induces an enhancement in the exciton density spatially confined in the perovskite layer, thus achieving population inversion and a reduction in the optical gain threshold. Such a fast localization process also bypasses the nonradiative trapping centres in the perovskite layer and limits the diffusion of photocarriers. Hence, the lasing performances of the resonator are improved.
In addition, the lasing performances were further enhanced by introducing a CLC layer on both sides of the glass substrate. The top and bottom surfaces of the CLC layer had a thicknesses of 300 nm and 100 nm, respectively. The lasing spectra for Glass/CLC (on both sides of the glass)/Al2O3/GAPbI3:Tm/P3HT/Au are presented in Fig. 7a, which shows the presence of single-mode lasing spectra. When the excitation power density increased from 0.31 μJ cm−2 to 0.50 μJ cm−2, the intensities of the lasing peaks also increased with an FWHM of 0.21 nm. The lasing threshold value decreased to 0.26 μJ cm−2, as shown in Fig. 7b. Moreover, the calculated Q-factor value increased to 3714. Here, the fraction of unpolarized perovskite emission with the same handedness as CLC on the top surface of the substrate could be reflected, whereas light of the opposite handedness could be transmitted through the CLC layer. The transmitted light changes the handedness of the top CLC layer when it passes through the film and is further reflected by the CLC on the bottom surface of the substrate, resulting in higher reflectivity.43 This is the reason for the enhanced lasing performances of the F–P resonator with a CLC layer on both sides of the glass substrate. According to previous literature, the ASE properties of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin film-based device stacks with a CLC reflector were improved by Samuel D. Stranks et al. via the introduction of a CLC layer on both sides of the substrate.6

4. Conclusions
In summary, lasing spectra were successfully achieved from a GAPbI3:Tm perovskite thin film-based F–P resonator with a low threshold of 0.70 μJ cm−2 and high Q factor of 2500. Interestingly, the yielded threshold and FWHM values from the F–P resonator were lower than that obtained without device stacks as well as previous literature on MAPbI3 thin film-based device stacks. The CLC layer greatly reduced the FWHM values of the lasing spectra and simultaneously enhanced the Q-factor. Here, the CLC layer is favorable for the GAPbI3:Tm perovskite thin film-based device stack. The results prove the potential of GAPbI3:Tm perovskite in lasing. Hence, the perovskite of GAPbI3:Tm can pave a dramatic change in future lasing and photovoltaic applications, which offers a key route for organic luminescent frameworks.
