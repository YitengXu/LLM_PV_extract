    , Accepted 4th April 2019First published on 4th April 2019AbstractPreparation of CdSe nano-tetrapods in a controlled environment, using a glove box for the preparation of the Se precursor, was found to eliminate radiative surface trap emission to a large extent. This manifested in an increase in the band edge photoluminescence quantum yield by a factor of 20 and a concomitant decrease in the surface trap emission by a factor of 8. Interestingly, the time for recovery of ground state bleaching was more or less the same in the two kinds of nano-tetrapods, even though the photoluminescence dynamics are significantly slower in the more emissive ones. In single emissive nano-tetrapods, the kinetic traces for ground state bleaching recovery became gradually faster upon increasing the pump power. This is likely to be due to the effect of multiexciton relaxation and nonradiative Auger recombination.
Introduction
Semiconductor nanocrystals are interesting due to their shape- and size-dependent optical properties.1,2 They have been hailed as a new generation of emitters3–6 and have a plethora of optoelectronic applications.7–12 Spherical nanocrystals and nanorods have been studied extensively over the last few decades.13–18 In more recent times, nanocrystals with exotic structures have taken centre stage, by virtue of their unique shape-dependent exciton dynamics and a myriad of possible applications that are not possible for spherical nanoparticles.19–22 Nano-tetrapods belong to this family of exotic nanocrystals. They comprise a staggered zinc blende core, the (111) facets of which serve as origins of protrusions that take the shape of nanorods, with an eclipsed wurtzite structure.22–24 Due to this unique shape, nano-tetrapods are capable of acting as seeds for dendrimeric structures22 and supporting electron transfer perpendicular to the plane of devices in which they are used.25–27 Some systematic studies of exciton dynamics in nano-tetrapods exist in the literature,28–33 but a lot remains to be done in this area.
Very recently, we have studied dual emitting nano-tetrapods, in which short lived (picosecond–nanosecond) band edge emission is accompanied by comparably more intense, long lived (tens and hundreds of nanoseconds) trap state emission,34 which becomes significantly more intense and longer lived at 77 K, due to the suppression of non-radiative trapping. While such dual emission has, in some cases, been effectively used to generate white light,35–38 traps are usually a hindrance, as they deplete band edge emission.39–41 In the present work, the preparation procedure of nano-tetrapods has been altered so as to almost completely eliminate trap state emission. A comparison was made between the excited state dynamics of these nano-tetrapods and the dual emitting ones prepared earlier.
It is particularly interesting, in this context, to study the multiexponential decay of colloidal quantum dots ranging from picoseconds to tens of nanoseconds using back to back time resolved photoluminescence (PL) and femtosecond pump–probe techniques. Along with radiative recombination, nonradiative deactivation pathways also affect the excited state dynamics of quantum dots (QDs).42 Photoexcitation of these semiconductor nanocrystals leads to the generation of electron and holes in their hot state. Relaxation of these charge carriers involves several pathways, including hot charge carrier cooling to the lowest energy level, multiexciton generation, extraction of hot charge carriers by substrates, Auger recombination, etc.43,44 These processes have been utilized to increase the number of charge carriers generated per excitation event,45 leading to an increase in efficiency in quantum dot sensitized solar cells, in which these nanostructures have found ample applications.44,46 The dynamics of such processes are best followed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy using different powers of pump pulses, numerous studies of which have been performed on CdSe and other quantum dots.44,47,48 There have also been some reports on nano-tetrapods.49–51
In the present study, detailed spectroscopic analysis is used to confirm the influence of the surface state emission in the excited state dynamics of nano-tetrapods devoid of trap state emission. Femtosecond pump power variation studies reveal the effect of multiexcitons, where nonradiative Auger recombination plays a significant role in charge carrier recombination. Moreover, these studies can open up a variety of possible applications in nanocrystal-based solar cells due to the independent tunability of the arm length and bandgap.

Synthesis of tetrapod shaped CdSe nanocrystals devoid of surface state emission
The synthesis of dual emissive CdSe nano-tetrapods, reported earlier,34 involves identical amounts of Cd and Se precursors and capping agent following the hot injection literature synthesis method of the tetrapods.30 It was observed that while preparing the Se-precursor inside a N2 filled glove box the surface state emission of the CdSe nano-tetrapods reduced considerably. Additionally, to ensure the complete absence of moisture and O2 in the reaction mixture containing Cd precursors, alternating nitrogen purging and evacuation processes were repeated three times with continuous stirring at 100 °C to maintain the controlled conditions. As a whole, a completely inert atmosphere was maintained in the reaction mixture using a Schlenk line. Cd and Se precursors were always kept under an inert atmosphere for the preparation of CdSe nano-tetrapods without surface state emission, the detailed synthetic procedure of which is as follows: CdO (1 mmol), oleic acid (6.28 mmol) and octadecene (ODE, 20 ml) were used as a Cd precursor in a 100 ml three-neck round bottomed (RB) flask. The vertical neck was connected to a condenser coupled with a Schlenk line, connecting an inert nitrogen cylinder source and vacuum pump to both sides. Another neck was used to insert a temperature sensor and the third was closed with a septum, through which aliquots were extracted using a microliter syringe. The reaction mixture was heated slowly under an inert atmosphere with continuous nitrogen purging using a Schlenk line. Additionally, to maintain the controlled conditions, alternating nitrogen purging and evacuation were carried out under continuous stirring at 100 °C. This process was repeated three times to ensure the complete absence of moisture and O2 in the mixture. This step was not carried out for the preparation of dual emissive CdSe nano-tetrapods. The temperature was then increased gradually to 240–250 °C, at which point the brown mixture turned clear and colourless to form a stable Cd-oleate precursor solution. 0.5 mmol of Se mixed with 1.5 ml of TOP was prepared inside a N2 filled glove box as a Se precursor. A TOP-Se solution premixed with CTAB (0.02 g in 3 ml of toluene) was injected rapidly to the reaction mixture in a RB at 190 °C using a glass syringe with a stainless steel needle through a septum. For the growth of CdSe nano-tetrapods, a reaction temperature of 160 °C was maintained. Aliquots were collected from time to time to ensure the formation of tetrapods. To remove unreacted excess precursors, the CdSe nano-tetrapods were purified by precipitation using 2-propanol (1:3), followed by centrifugation at 7000 rpm at 4 °C. The final product, dried at ambient temperature, was redispersed in toluene.
Microscopic characterization
A JEOL (JEM-2100F) high resolution (HR) field emission gun transmission electron microscope (FEG-TEM) operated at 200 kV was used to characterize the CdSe nano-tetrapods. Diluted and sonicated samples of nanocrystalline suspensions were placed on a carbon coated Cu-grid using a single drop. The drop was dried in air as well as under infrared (IR) lamp exposure.
Steady state absorption and photoluminescence (PL)
Steady state UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature using a JASCO V-530 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. Varian Cary Eclipse and Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorimeters were used to record the photoluminescence (PL) spectra, using λex = 440 nm. For the calculation of the quantum yield (ϕPL), rhodamine 6G was used as a standard (ϕPL = 95%, λex = 480 nm). The spectra of freshly prepared samples of CdSe nano-tetrapods with surface state emission were recorded, which matched the earlier spectra reported in ref. 34.
Time-resolved photoluminescence
Ultrafast PL decay components were resolved by fluorescence upconversion, widely known as femtosecond optical gating (FOG) using a FOG100 spectrometer from CDP corporation, Russia. 800 nm, 100 fs pulses from a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator (Tsunami, Spectra Physics), with 80 MHz repetition rate, pumped by a 4.2 W Millennia (Spectra Physics) DPSS laser, were focused on a non-linear crystal (NC1, 0.5 mm β-BBO, θ = 25°, ϕ = 90°) to generate second harmonic 400 nm excitation light, which was used to excite a dispersion of nano-tetrapods in a rotating cell with a 1 mm pathlength. Residual 800 nm light (gate) was focused, along with PL from the sample, on another nonlinear crystal (NC2, 0.5 mm BBO, θ = 38°, ϕ = 90°), to generate an upconverted signal. This was dispersed by a double grating monochromator and detected by a photomultiplier tube at different path differences between the gate and PL, to generate transient PL. The decay was recorded at magic angle polarization with respect to the excitation pulse. Multiexponential fitting was performed after iterative re-convolution using an IGORPRO routine. A cross-correlation function was obtained using the Raman scattering from ethanol with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ∼230 fs.52
A picosecond pulsed diode laser based time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system from IBH, UK, with a repetition rate of 1 MHz, was used to record PL decays in a longer time regime. An excitation source of 440 nm was used with a full width half maximum (FWHM) of the instrument response function (IRF) of ∼270 ps along with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) as a detector. To eliminate the rotational anisotropy effect, PL decays were collected with an emission polarizer at a magic angle of 54.7° with respect to the excitation polarizer. The data analysis software IBH DAS v6.2 was used to analyse the decay traces for each of the excitations.53
All of the data were fitted to the sum of multi-exponential functions using the iterative re-convolution method, as shown below (eqn (1)): (1)where, after excitation by the pulse of the laser source, at time t and zero, I(t) and I(0) are the PL intensities, and Ai is the amplitude of the ith component. PL decays of nano-tetrapods with surface state emission, reported earlier in ref. 34, were recorded afresh. The results of this study were found to match the decays reported earlier. In order to build a unified picture over the entire time domain studied, fast components were taken from FOG experiments. Nanosecond components were obtained by global fit of the TCSPC decays.
Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy
75 fs pulses with a wavelength of 800 nm, energy of 4 mJ and repetition rate of 1 kHz were obtained from an amplified laser (Libra, Coherent, USA). About 1.6 mJ of the output was used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (OPA – TOPAS, Light Conversion, Lithuania) in order to generate tunable pump pulses. For all of the experiments reported here, the pump wavelength used was 400 nm. A portion of the 800 nm light was focused onto a CaF2 crystal to generate a white light continuum (WLC) (370–750 nm), which was used as a probe for pump-induced absorbance changes as a function of delay between the pump and probe beams. The white light was divided into probe and reference beams using a beam splitter. The reference beam was used to correct for real time intensity fluctuation of the white light continuum. The pump pulse was passed through a synchronized mechanical chopper that blocks every alternative excitation pulse, creating a succession of “pump” and “no pump” situations. The pump (400 nm) and probe pulses were focused and spatially overlapped on the nanocrystalline solution, kept in a rotating cell with a path length of 1 mm. They were detected by two diode arrays. The effect of rotational diffusion was corrected by adjusting the polarization to the magic angle (54.7°). Steady state absorbance of the sample before and after the transient absorption experiment was recorded to check for any degradation of the sample. All of the recorded data were chirp corrected for the removal of the group velocity dispersion (GVD) and fitted using Surface Minor Pro version 4.0 software. In order to compare CdSe nano-tetrapods with and without surface state emission, transient absorption spectra and dynamics of the nano-tetrapods with surface state emission were recorded anew and the data were found to match the earlier reported data in ref. 34.
Results and discussion
Size, shape and steady state spectra of the CdSe nano-tetrapods
The shape and size distribution of the CdSe nanocrystals were determined by TEM, where the inset in the TEM image shows a tetrahedral shape with a high resolution (HR) image (Fig. 1a). Fairly good monodispersity was observed, in terms of the length of arms as well as the diameter of the core, which have mean values of 21.5 ± 2.5 nm and 2.60 ± 0.29 nm, respectively (Fig. 1b and c). Standard deviations are represented by the full width at half maxima of the Gaussian fits to the histogram. The arm length and diameter of the tetrapods were found to increase with reaction time.30 The major absorption band, ascribed to the 1S(e)–1S3/2(h) transition, has a maximum at 532 nm (2.33 eV), similar to in an earlier report.34 However, the shoulder at 400–450 nm (3.1–2.75 eV), ascribed to the 1P(e)–1P3/2(h) transition region is prominent in the present study (Fig. 2), unlike in the previous study.34 The PL spectra exhibit a sharp band edge emission at 550 nm (2.25 eV), but the broad surface state emission at 600–800 nm (2.07–1.55 eV) is very weak. This indicates a drastic reduction in the number of trap states, which is manifested in the seven-fold increase in the overall PL quantum yield (ϕPL) to 0.07. While comparing both the single and earlier studied dual emissive nano-tetrapods, after deconvoluting the complete PL into individual components, it can be clearly seen that the ϕPL for the band-edge emission is enhanced by twenty times from 0.003 to 0.060, whereas that for the surface state emission decreases from 0.008 to 0.001 (Fig. 2).

Time resolved photoluminescence
For CdSe nano-tetrapods without surface state emission, slower decays are obtained for the band edge emission (λem = 550 nm), in the FOG as well as the TCSPC, compared to those obtained earlier for dual emissive nano-tetrapods (Fig. 3). On the ultrafast timescale, a component of 8.0 ps occurs for both kinds of nano-tetrapods. However, the ones with surface state emission exhibit a major component of 1.2 ps, which is absent for the ones without surface state emission (Table 1). This component is hence assigned to the trapping process. Global analysis of the TCSPC data yielded two components of 5.20 and 30.5 ns. Predominance of the ultrafast trapping process, leading to the population of the emissive shallow trap states with a lifetime of 30.5 ns, is the principal reason for the miniscule quantum yields of the dual emissive nano-tetrapods. The absence of this ultrafast component contributes to the significantly greater PL quantum yield of singly emitting nano-tetrapods. The presence of the 8.0 ps component in both kinds of nano-tetrapods indicates the occurrence of a second trapping process, leading to the population of nonemissive trap states, which do not show up in the PL spectra. The 5.20 ns component is due to intrinsic radiative electron–hole recombination.

Femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy
The transient absorption spectra of both the nano-tetrapods are dominated by ground state bleaching. Notably, the minor, high energy band in the 400–450 nm region shows up prominently in the signal of CdSe tetrapods without surface state emission, unlike in the earlier report of the dual emissive ones (Fig. 4a). This is because of the relative prominence of this band in the steady state absorption spectra (Fig. 2b). A comparison between the kinetics at the maxima (negative) of these spectra (λprobe = 530 nm) for the two kinds of nano-tetrapods reveals a slower bleaching recovery for the ones without trap emission (Fig. 4b). A further comparison with FOG traces at the band edge emission (λem = 550 nm, Fig. 3a) indicates that ground state recovery is slower than the decay in the PL intensity on the femtosecond-picosecond timescale. This indicates that the newly prepared nano-tetrapods, with insignificant trap emission, are associated with non-radiative trap states, which delay the regeneration of the ground state. These are likely to be the ones that are populated by the 8 ps decay observed in the FOG.
 Fig. 4  Transient absorption study comparison of CdSe nano-tetrapods with and without surface state emission: (a) transient spectra and (b) the kinetics of the ground state bleaching recovery at λprobe = 530 nm. 
To explain the charge carrier dynamics at different pump powers in the transient absorption experiments (Fig. 5), we monitored the kinetics of ground state bleaching recovery of the 1S exciton for the CdSe nano-tetrapods without surface state emission. It has been observed that the decay becomes gradually faster with an increase in the pump power (Fig. 6a). While fitting the ground state bleaching decay traces in multiexponential functions, the bleaching growth and recovery kinetics can give information about the cooling of the conduction band hot electrons from the higher excited state to populate the concerned probe state (1Se state) followed by depopulation of that state through recombination and surface trapping processes, respectively.54 With an increase in the pump power, the magnitude of ΔA, at λprobe = 530 nm, increases, indicating a greater extent of ground state bleaching, as may be expected (Fig. 6a inset). For the CdSe nano-tetrapods, while exciting in the 400 nm region, electrons are directly excited to the 1P and higher states. Hot electron cooling, involving subsequent transitions from the higher states to 1Se is reflected in the rise time (Fig. 6b). The ground state bleaching growth time (τg) increasing with an increase in the pump energy per pulse because of the slowdown of the Auger assisted cooling process may be due to the decoupling of electrons from the hole wave functions (Table 2).54,55 the ground state bleaching recovery kinetics for the depopulation of the probe state shows the initial two fast components (τd1, τd2) on the picosecond time scale, which can be attributed to charge carrier trapping. These short and long trapping processes can be assigned to electron trapping for shallow and deep trap states, according to the literature.56,57 Competition between electron trapping and electron–hole recombination processes can contribute to the long component (τd3) on the nanosecond time scale for incomplete recovery of the bleaching kinetics.

It is widely reported for CdSe quantum dots that at low pump intensities, population relaxation is dominated by the decay of singly excited QDs.45,47 Increase in the pump density leads to the observation of more exponential terms, accounting for the decay of QDs in greater numbers of e–h pair states via nonradiative Auger recombination of multiexcitons.45,47 This is the reason for a decrease in the time constants of CdSe quantum dots with an increase in pump fluence. In an earlier study of the ultrafast dynamics of CdSe nano-tetrapods, in which the core diameter was 5 nm and the arms had a length of 11 nm and diameter of 3.5 nm,51 hot electrons produced by the pump were reported to first relax into arm states followed by the core state.58 As a whole, with an increase in the pump fluence, the Auger recombination rate of the tetrapod is slower than that of quantum dots is due to the delocalization of electrons into different areas, such as arms or core.51 Nano-tetrapods used in the present study have a much longer arm length and shorter diameter of the core. The ultrafast dynamics results are slightly different from those of the earlier reported CdSe tetrapods, maybe because of the longer arms, which mean that electrons cannot transfer from the arms to core like in the CdSe/CdS core/shell tetrapods.50 In this experiment, the kinetic traces converge at higher pump powers (Fig. 6(a)). So, a further increase in the pump power beyond 4.8 μJ is unlikely to change the kinetics. Also, experiments cannot be performed at smaller intervals of pump power, as that would lead to a significant overlap in the normalized kinetics. So, in these studies, the contribution of the fast picosecond components increases with more pump energy per pulse followed by a decrease in the contribution of the long component picosecond–nanosecond lifetimes, reflected in the faster recovery of ground state bleaching processes at high pump energy.
Conclusions
In the present study, the importance of the use of an inert atmosphere in the reactions to make the mixed system as well as the Cd and Se precursors are shown through the synthesis of CdSe nano-tetrapods devoid of surface state emission. Inert conditions were maintained throughout the reaction with continuous N2 purging using a Schlenk line. Alternating N2 purging and evacuation were carried out at 100 °C to ensure the complete absence of moisture and O2 in the reaction mixture containing Cd precursors. Preparation of a Se-precursor inside the N2-filled glove box became the turning point to get rid of the surface state emission in these nano-tetrapods. The excited state dynamics of these single emissive nano-tetrapods were characterized and compared with those of the dual emissive nano-tetrapods using steady state and time resolved spectroscopy. It was found that the PL intensity as well as lifetime becomes enhanced in these CdSe nano-tetrapods due to the absence of predominant ultrafast trapping as well as the greater extent of intrinsic radiative recombination of excitons in the presence of very weak surface states. Interestingly, in transient absorption experiments, the kinetic decay traces for the ground state bleaching recovery became faster with an increase in the pump energy per pulse. This can be attributed to Auger recombination for generated multiexcitons at high pump power in these CdSe nano-tetrapods.
