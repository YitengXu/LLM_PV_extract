    , Accepted 29th May 2022First published on 31st May 2022AbstractA W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film modulated for visible and near infrared light was prepared by a layer-by-layer method on an FTO glass substrate, and had a significant coloration efficiency (149.78 cm2 C−1), fast response time (2.62 and 0.94 s at 650 nm, and 1.98 and 1.92 s at 1167 nm, respectively), and good cycling stability (500 cycles) in 0.5 M AlCl3 electrolyte. Furthermore, the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film was successfully assembled into an electrochromic device, which can realize color reversibility conversion under a small voltage. Overall, the experimental results showed that W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film preparation allows the production of an electrochromic film for next-generation smart windows, which are able to evenly control the solar light and heat gain in buildings.
Introduction
Reduction in energy consumption is an efficient way to solve the environmental pollution and energy problems. In the field of architecture, because of its active control and large optical modulation, electrochromic (EC) smart window technology1 is an efficacious energy conservation technique that is conducive to reducing the energy consumption of artificial lighting and air conditioning.2 Because 50% of the radiant energy from the sun is in the near-infrared region in the solar spectral range, EC intelligent windows that simultaneously regulate the transmission of visible and near-infrared incident light have become a hot topic.3
EC materials are the core part of the EC smart windows, and can be classified into three types: inorganic, organic and composite EC materials. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a well-known class of inorganic EC material with a good electron reservoir and excellent redox reversibility, and undergo stepwise multielectron-transfer reactions without the structure changing but exhibiting a color change, which can apply in many areas, such as anti-glare car rear-view mirrors, reusable labels, EC display devices and particularly “smart windows”.4–7
The nature of electrochromism in POMs can be described as follows; for example, color changes by the reduction of [P5W30O110]15− in an acidic electrolyte can be represented by eqn (1): [P5W30O110]17− + xe− + xM+ = [MxP5W30O110]17−(1)where M+ represents H+ or alkali metal ions. The color change in the film is directly related to the double injection/extraction of electrons and ions in/out of the film, respectively.
POM-based EC films can effectively control the visible light transmittance; for example, TiO2(NP)–Na–P5W30,8 P2W18/WO3 (P2W18: P2W18O626−),9 [(PEI/SiMoW)25/(g-C3N4NS/SiMoW)3/(PEI/SiMoW)2] (PEI: poly(ethyleneimine), SiMoW: SiMoW10O398−),10 and [PDDA/As2W15Mg3]4 (PDDA: poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride, As2W15Mg3: As2W15Mg3O6218−).11 Furthermore, POMs also exhibit the ability to regulate the Near Infrared (NIR) spectrum, with promising application potential in the energy regulation field, but there are few related reports.12,13 Therefore, the development of POMs with NIR absorption properties will be of great research significance in the EC field.
Monoclinic W18O49 with the largest oxygen deficiency in WO2.625–WO3 has been reported as the only oxide with a pure form, which causes the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, and makes it have promising full spectrum absorption properties (including visible and NIR light).14,15 Therefore, the NIR absorption properties of W18O49 make it an effective candidate in various applications, such as photocatalysts,16 gas sensors,17 field-emission performance,18,19 and EC devices.20,21 Many studies have focused on W18O49, including both fundamental studies and application-oriented studies. Further improvement of the EC properties of W18O49 is an important research direction. Formation of different nanostructures is a universal and reliable method for the enhancement of EC properties. Kim et al.22 explored W18O49 nanourchins (NUs) and nanospheres (NSs), of which the W18O49 NUs exhibited better EC properties. Xie et al.23 reported citric acid-induced bi-layer W18O49 (CA–WO) nanostructures for EC properties, which strengthened the modulation capability of visible light. Gu et al.24 prepared an EC film using W18O49 nanowires and P8W48 anions, which can independently modulate visible and NIR light in different voltage ranges. In summary, changing the nanostructure and compositing with other EC materials is an effective strategy to fabricate a high performance functional device.
For next-generation electronics, the dual-band modulation of EC devices is urgently needed. In this paper, a W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film has been fabricated by a layer-by-layer (LbL) method using Preyssler-type POMs and W18O49 nanowires (PEI: poly(ethylene imine)). The transmittance, response time, coloration efficiency and cycling stability of the composite films were tested by UV/VIS/NIR spectroscopy using an electrochemical workstation in an Al3+-based aqueous electrolyte at 650 nm and 1167 nm, respectively. The W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film exhibited excellent control capability in the visible and near infrared regions, and is a promising material for smart windows.
Materials and methods
Reagents and materials
All solvents and chemicals were analytical grade and did not require further purification. Poly (ethylene imine) (PEI), chlorinated tungsten (WCl6, 99%), and anhydrous ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.7%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc, Shanghai Macklin, and Zhongtian Fine Chemical Co Ltd, respectively. Sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4·2H2O), phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and potassium chloride (KCl) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin, and Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, respectively, and were used to synthesize K12.5Na1.5[NaP5W30O110]·15H2O (P5W30), which was detected by infrared spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.25 FTO-coated glass was purchased from Yingkou Opv Tech New Energy Co Ltd.
Preparation of W18O49 nanowires
Unlike the typical synthesis, 0.028 g of WCl6 was dissolved in 9 mL of absolute ethanol, and transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave holding a vertically oriented FTO-glass substrate. The autoclave was then sealed and heated at 180 °C for 10 h. After the reaction, the substrate was removed and rinsed thoroughly with distilled water before drying at room temperature. Finally, the temperature was raised to 200 °C and the sample was kept in the air for 1 h to make the film closely adhere to the FTO conductive glass, and an EC film was obtained, which can be used for subsequent testing.
Preparation of composite films
FTO loaded with W18O49 was used to prepare the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film (Fig. 1). In this experiment, the LbL method was used. First, the FTO was soaked in 5 mM PEI (pH 4.00) for 7 minutes, and then removed, rinsed with distilled water and blown dry. Next, the FTO was immersed in 5 mM P5W30 solution for 7 minutes, and then removed, rinsed with distilled water and blown dry. Repeating the above operation 20 times produced a W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film. Because both W18O49 and P5W30 have negative charges, a positively charged polyelectrolyte, PEI, is used as the electrostatic interaction partner for alternating deposition to form an LbL multi-layered film (abbreviated as [PEI/P5W30]n, where the subscript n denotes the deposition number).

Assembly of the electrochromic device
The W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film and FTO glass are used as the EC layer and ion storage layer, respectively. A mixed solid electrolyte made of LiClO4/PC and polymethyl methacrylate was poured onto the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film and FTO glass, which was then used after drying. To investigate the response time and transmittance, the device was tested by applying a square wave voltage of +4.0/−4.0 V for 50 s. Meanwhile, a 300 W xenon lamp was used as a solar simulator, and the power density change of the energy was measured with an optical power meter at the same potential as before.
Electrochemical measurement
Electrochemical measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instruments, Inc.) using a conventional three-electrode test cell. Platinum wire, Ag/AgCl saturated with KCl, and the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film were used as the counter electrode, reference electrode, and working electrode, respectively. 0.5 M AlCl3 was used as the electrolyte to test the electrochemical and electrochromic performance.
Characterization
Surface morphology characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Merlin Compact), atomic force microscopy (AFM, MFP-3D Infinity), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-F200, JEOL). XPS (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD) was carried out to confirm the element composition of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film and the valence states of tungsten. The FTIR spectra were acquired on a Frontier FTIR spectrometer from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1 (FTIR, PerkinElmer). All of the electrochemical tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instruments, Inc.), and the EC properties of the films were measured in a 0.5 M AlCl3 electrolyte solution by using a conventional three-electrode system (as-prepared films as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and platinum wire as the counter electrode). The composite film growth and optical properties were detected using a UV-vis (TU-1900) and UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 1050 +), respectively.
Results and discussion
The microstructures of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film and the W18O49 film are shown in Fig. 2. The as-grown W18O49 on FTO was composed of entangled nanowires with a large number of vacancies, which is more conducive to electron conduction within them (Fig. 2c). After the LbL process, the interspace between the nanowires was reduced and the nanowires became wider and more compact, which formed a unique wrap-type porous nano-structure and proves that the nanowires were wrapped uniformly by POMs (Fig. 2a). In addition, the interplanar spacing of an individual nanowire is measured to be about 0.396 nm, corresponding to the (010) plane of monoclinic W18O49 (Fig. 2d). The width of a single nanowire is only 3 nm. After being wrapped with POMs, it was only vaguely shown that there was a very thin nanowire inside, and the whole structure is thicker under TEM, which corresponds to the SEM result (Fig. 2a and b).

AFM was employed to further investigate the surface morphology of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film deposited onto the FTO substrate. Randomly grown nanowires could be seen on the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film in Fig. 2c. Moreover, the root mean square (RMS) roughness of 106.397 nm was calculated from an area of 10 × 10 μm2 in the AFM image (Fig. 2e and f). The obviously higher roughness of the composite film may increase the reaction surface area, resulting in improved EC performance.
The structures of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film, W18O49 film and P5W30 were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3a, the characteristic absorption peak at 1091 cm−1 could be assigned to the P–O stretching modes of P5W30, and the strong peak at 822 cm−1 could be attributed to the W–O–W stretching modes of W18O49. These characteristic peaks indicate the synthesis of a composite film with both W18O49 and P5W30.

The element composition of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film was identified by XPS. On the film, the presence of W, P, O, and C was confirmed. In Fig. 3b, the peaks at the binding energies of 41.6, 37.9, and 35.8 eV can be assigned to the spin–orbit split peaks of W 4f3/2, W 4f5/2, and W 4f7/2, respectively.26,27 The fitting peaks at lower binding energies in the W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 doublet can be attributed to W5+, and those at higher binding energies can be assigned to W6+,28 suggesting that the as-prepared materials are multivalent and stoichiometric. As shown in Fig. 3c, the peak position of the P element is 133.4 eV, which is in agreement with data for P-containing POMs.29
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded for the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 and the W18O49 film in 0.5 M AlCl3 electrolyte at different scan rates (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200 mV s−1) in the potential region of −1.1 to 0.8 V, as shown in Fig. 3d and e. They all exhibited excellent pseudocapacitive behavior, showing well-resolved redox peaks. The anodic and cathodic peaks were observed to be symmetric, reflecting superior reversibility of the relevant redox reactions. When the scan rate was increased from 25 to 200 mV s−1, the anode peak point was slightly off-set in the positive voltage direction. Furthermore, there is a good linear relationship between the peak current and scanning speed in inset images of Fig. 3d and e.
To further evaluate the ion diffusion and EC properties of the two films, the diffusion coefficient (D) of Al3+ ions has been calculated using Randles–Sevick's equation.30 (2)where Ip is the peak current density, n is the electron number involved in the reaction, c0 is the concentration of active ions in the solution, ν1/2 is the square root of the scan rate, and A is the area of the film. When using 0.5 M AlCl3 electrolyte, the D values are calculated to be 1.67 × 10−11, 7.89 × 10−12, and 2.59 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 for the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film, the W18O49 film and the P5W30 film, respectively. It is well-known that a higher D is more beneficial for Al3+ ion intercalation and deintercalation. Obviously, the D value of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film is higher than that of the W18O49 film, indicating that the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film has the ability to support larger sites for Al3+ ion intercalation and deintercalation.
Furthermore, the improved current density of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film was mainly due to the unique wrap-type porous nano-structure and the synergistic effect of W18O49 and P5W30, which increased the surface area and enhanced the contraction areas between the EC materials and electrolytes.
To investigate the effective combination of two cathodic EC materials, the EC properties of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film, W18O49 film and P5W30 film were tested from 0 V to −0.8 V voltage range and 350–1300 nm wavelength range in 0.5 M AlCl3 electrolyte, respectively (Fig. 4a). The transmittance of the above two films exhibited a gradual decrease between 0 and −0.8 V. In the colored state, the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film had lower visible and near infrared transmissivity than the W18O49 film (as shown in Fig. 4d and e). The light contrasts of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film, the W18O49 film and the P5W30 film at 650 nm were 56.29%, 41.58% and 26.86%, respectively, which is a 109.57% increase from the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film to the P5W30 film. Fig. 4c shows that the light contrast of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film at 1167 nm is slightly higher than that of the W18O49 film, which is attributed to the composite with P5W30. Moreover, W18O49 makes an important contribution to the shielding effect of near-infrared light. In general, the EC performance of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film in the visible region is stronger than that of the W18O49 film and the P5W30 film. On the other hand, the energy absorption of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film in the near infrared region is slightly strengthened compared to that of the W18O49 film and much higher than that of the P5W30 film. Thereafter, a sandwich-type EC device based on W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film was constructed (Fig. 4f), which can realize color reversibility conversion under a small voltage.

In this work, to investigate the response time of the two films, the switching current density versus time of the films was switched between colored and bleached states by applying a square wave voltage of +0.8/−0.8 V for 22 s, and measuring the corresponding transmittance value at a phototropic wavelength of 650 nm and 1167 nm as shown in Fig. 5(a)–(f). The switching time is defined as the time required for a 90% change in the full transmittance modulation at 650 nm and 1167 nm,31 which is a critical parameter for EC materials. The coloring time (tc) and bleaching time (tb) of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film were 2.62 and 0.94 s at 650 nm, and 1.98 and 1.92 s at 1167 nm, respectively. Compared with the W18O49 film, the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film has a faster response time in the visible-near infrared region. It is worth noting that the bleaching time of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film reduced by 48% and 53% at 650 nm and 1167 nm, respectively. The enhanced EC ability might be attributed to the strong electrostatic force created by the insertion of Al3+ ions, which stabilizes the film structure and increases the ion transmission capacity.32

In addition, the EC cycling stability of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 films was tested and is shown in Fig. 6a and b. The losses of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film at 650 nm and 1167 nm after 500 cycles are 10.90% and 3.5%, respectively. Compared with the transmission spectra of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film after three months, the transmission spectra of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film under −0.8 V differ by only 1.3% in light modulation. This shows that the composite film has good cycling stability, and the P5W30 has a good protective effect on the film material. Besides, the unique wrap-type porous nano-structure of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film makes ion diffusion become easier and gives a larger surface area for charge-transfer reactions.

The coloration efficiency (CE) is also an important parameter to judge EC performance, which represents the change in optical contrast (ΔOD) per unit charge (Q/A) relative to the electrode area. The CE can be calculated from eqn (3) and (4):33 CE = ΔOD/(Q/A)(3) ΔOD(λ) = logTb/Tc(4)where Tb and Tc refer to the bleached and colored transmittance of the EC films, respectively. CE can be used to obtain the slope of the line fitting in the linear region of the block, and Fig. 6c shows that the CE values of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film are calculated to be 149.78 and 94.75 cm2 C−1 at 650 nm and 1167 nm, respectively. The coloration efficiency of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film is very competitive among the W18O49 films reported in Fig. 6d, and this proved that the composite membrane has good coloration efficiency.22,23,34–36
The modulation of sunlight and solar heat of the EC device was tested in Fig. 5g and h. The light contrast, coloring time (tc) and bleaching time (tb) of the EC device are 19.61%, 35.48 s and 20.52 s at 650 nm, respectively. The original power density was 568 W m−2, and as the voltage across the EC device reaches −4.0 V, the power density is decreased to 303 W m−2 and the energy absorption percentage is 46.65%. The light contrast of the EC device changed from 15.13% to 10.61% after 100 cycles. The results show that the device made of the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film shows promising applications in energy-saving smart windows.
Conclusion
A W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film was successfully fabricated by an LbL method on FTO-coated glass. Compared to the pure W18O49 nanowire film, the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film has an enhanced EC performance with a larger optical modulation (56.29%), faster switching responses (2.62 s and 1.98 s for coloration and 0.94 s and 1.92 s for bleaching in the visible and NIR region, respectively), and higher CE (149.78 cm2 C−1) in the visible region. This may be because of the unique wrap-type porous nano-structure for W18O49/P5W30, which facilitates electrolyte penetration, and shortens the diffusion length of ions. And the synergy of W18O49 and P5W30 is also another important factor for the significantly enhanced performance. Furthermore, an EC device based on P5W30 and W18O49 was demonstrated, which can effectively modulate visible and near-infrared light. Overall, with the significantly enhanced performance, the W18O49/[PEI/P5W30]20 film electrode has potential applications in other flexible electronics and human–machine interfaces.
