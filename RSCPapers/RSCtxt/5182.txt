    , Accepted 10th September 2019First published on 11th September 2019AbstractSnO2 is a transparent large band gap semiconductor, particularly interesting for optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, mainly because its conduction can be easily tuned by doping or by modulating the amount of oxygen vacancies. Besides, rare earth doping was successfully exploited for up conversion properties. Here we report on the functionalization of SnO2 nanoparticles with optically active Yb3+ ions using the sol–gel method, which allows UV to NIR spectral (down) conversion. As starting solutions we used stable non-alkoxide metal–organic compounds, which is rather uncommon. Transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated the formation of small well-crystallized nanoparticles while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements have revealed that the Yb is well inserted in the host matrix and has a 3+ valence state. All nanoparticles present large absorption in the UV-visible range (250 to 550 nm) and a band gap that decreases down to 2.72 eV upon doping. The UV energy converted into NIR on the basis of efficient energy transfer from SnO2 to the Yb3+ ions ranges between 250 and 400 nm. Reference undoped SnO2 nanoparticles with a mean size of 20 nm allow converting UV light into broad visible emission centered at 650 nm. The incorporation of up to 3.5 at% of Yb3+ ions into the SnO2 host matrix results in a spectacular decrease of the nanoparticle size down to 6.6 nm. This allowed also the shift of the photoluminescence to NIR in the 970–1050 nm range. The energy level structure of Yb3+ in SnO2 was successfully determined from the deconvolution of the Yb emission. This emission is significantly enhanced by increasing the doping level. All optical measurements suggest that these nanoparticles can be efficiently used as down-shifting converters.
I Introduction
Lanthanide-doped semiconductors and insulators usually present outstanding optical and magnetic properties that can be potentially interesting for various technological applications ranging from light-emitting diodes,1,2 lasers,3,4 and optical fibers and photovoltaics5–11 to biomedical applications that include bioimaging,12,13 biomarkers,14–16 sensing,17,18 therapy19,20 and nanothermometers.21–24 This new class of materials presents unparalleled advantages such as narrow absorption bands, the ability to emit at different wavelengths, high photo-stability, reasonable sensitivity, low biotoxicity and chemical degradation.25–29 The particular optical properties of Ln are governed by their intra 4f transitions, which give rise to intense emission bands in the visible and NIR regions. The NIR photons match with the absorption spectrum of Si (or other similar semiconductors such as CIGS), which is particulary interesting for solar cells with increased efficiency.30–32 In this context, synthesis of novel and interesting Ln-doped materials with particular photon management properties has long been a challenging topic. A variety of chemical techniques such as hydrothermal, co-precipitation, electrospinning and sol–gel techniques have been employed to synthesize different shapes and morphologies of Ln-doped nanostructures such as quantum dots,33 nanofibers,34 nanosheets,35 nanoparticles,36 core shells21 and nanocrystals.37
The combination of visible or NIR emitting lanthanide elements with suitable hosts can provide tuned optical properties such as up conversion (UC), down conversion (DC) or down shifting (DS). In UC, NIR photons can be converted into visible photons, while in DC and DS, UV and visible photons can be converted into NIR ones.
To date, Yb, due to its large absorption cross-section in the NIR (1.2 × 10−20 cm2 at 980 nm),12 is widely used in spectral conversion systems. Its simple energy level structure constituted of only one excited state 2F5/2 located at 1.27 eV from its 2F7/2 ground state makes it easy to associate with other RE elements to play the role either of a sensitizer in UC systems or emitter in DC ones. However, photon conversion using Yb as a single doping element has not gained sufficient insight yet, and only a few studies have been reported.38,39
On the other hand, oxides, among other host materials (such as phosphors, glasses and vanadates), have been extensively studied for bearing trivalent lanthanides. Because of their low phonon energies, efficient conversion processes with low non-radiative relaxation rates can be provided. While ZnO and TiO2 have gained increasing success when being doped with lanthanides (Er, Pr, Tb, Nd, and Yb) in thin films and nanostructures,40–44 SnO2 has not been fully explored yet as an alternative host. However it has recently attracted increasing attention, particularly for DC purposes for photovoltaics. Its large band gap, about 3.6 eV for the bulk material, offers good absorption of UV photons and the combination of good transparency in the visible and NIR and excellent electrical properties (SnO2 accepts easily oxygen vacancies in relation to the 2+ possible valence of Sn) makes it a potential candidate as a multifunctional material. Moreover, from the RE sensitization point of view, SnO2 presents numerous discrete energy levels within its band gap (due to oxygen vacancies), which offers more energy transfer paths.
SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) have been already studied and reported in the literature for different applications mostly related to catalysis and gas sensing.45–48 For emission purposes interesting studies have been published on SnO2 doped with rare earths, namely Nd, Er, Eu and Sm,49–51 while only a very few and coarse studies have concerned Yb doped SnO2.
In this work we present a detailed study on the structural, chemical and spectral conversion properties of Yb-doped SnO2 nanoparticles synthesized by the sol–gel technique. Our aim is to functionalize SnO2 nanoparticles with Yb3+ rare earth ions in order to convert UV into NIR light for down conversion purposes. For an efficient conversion process, the Yb ions have to be inserted in the SnO2 structure and therefore thorough structural characterization is needed. The synthesis of NPs is carried out by the sol–gel method using as starting solutions stable non-alkoxide metal–organic compounds. The sol–gel technique was used because it is much cheaper than physical methods and leads to rather monodisperse powders that can be further embedded in other transparent materials such as polymers. The changes in the structural properties induced by doping were thoroughly investigated. We show that Yb3+ ions are optically active and lead to efficient UV-visible to NIR spectral conversion. More precisely, the SnO2 NPs efficiently absorb UV light while Yb3+ is responsible for the emission in the NIR, due to efficient energy transfer from the host SnO2 to Yb3+. The evidence of efficient energy transfer paves the way for the increase of the solar cell efficiency using such DS conversion layers.
II Experimental details
The synthesis of the NPs was performed by the sol–gel method. The undoped and Yb-doped SnO2 sol–gel solutions were provided by the RBnano Company. The initial solutions consist of a mixture of tin metal–organic precursor in propionic acid (RBN119 product). For Yb doping, ytterbium(III) acetate hydrate, REacton®, 99.9% (REO) from Alfa Aesar was added to the solution in different amounts in order to modulate the doping concentration. The chosen nominal concentrations of Yb are 1, 2 and 4%. The sol–gel solutions were further annealed at 700 °C for 3 hours in air. This treatment allows obtaining the pure and doped SnO2 phases. The powders were then ground in an agate mortar in order to obtain the final NPs.
The Yb doping level in the final samples was checked by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. For the nominal Yb concentrations (measured with respect to the Sn + Yb content) of 1, 2 and 4 at%, the measured values are 0.69 ± 0.07, 1.23 ± 0.12 and 3.51 ± 0.35%, respectively. No impurities could be detected within the detection limit of the EDS technique.
The NPs were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in low magnification and high resolution modes. For this purpose the NPs were dispersed in a methanol solution using an ultrasound bath. The NPs were then dropped on a grid and dried in air before observation. A JEOL JEM2100 (LaB6, 200 kV) transmission electron microscope with a resolution of 0.21 nm and equipped with an EDS analyzer was used for this investigation.
The crystalline structure and the variation of the crystallite size at large scale were checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (a Cu Kα1 wavelength of 0.154056 nm) equipped with a front monochromator and a high-speed energy-dispersive LYNXEYE detector. The diffracted beam was energy filtered in order to eliminate the fluorescence background.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) surface chemical analysis was carried out using a Thermo Electron K-Alpha spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) and a flood gun. The spectra (HR and valence) were recorded with a pass energy of 50 eV and a step energy of 0.1 eV. Before each measurement, a calibration procedure was performed using Cu and Au samples followed by the ASTM-E-902-94 standard procedure. The size of the spot used for analysis was about 400 μm. The acceleration voltage and emission intensity were 12 kV and 6.0 mA, respectively. The homogeneity of the sample was checked by measuring at several points on the surface. The data treatment including the quantification of the different atomic elements was performed using Thermo Fisher Scientific Avantage data system software. In order to collect the maximum signal, large amounts of NP aggregates were compacted into pellets. This allows extracting valuable quantitative information on the chemical surroundings of the RE in samples with rather low doping levels. The position of the C 1s peak (found at 285.4 ± 0.1 eV) was used as a reference to determine the binding energies of the other elements.
Optical absorption measurements were carried out using an ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-visible-NIR) Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer.
The energy transfer from the host matrix to the RE ion was determined from photoluminescence measurements performed on compacted pellets. The excitation was induced by a Nd-YAG (355 nm) laser while the detection was ensured by means of a CCD camera. An excitation power of 10 mW for 10 s was chosen to avoid NP degradation. Additional PLE experiments were performed using a xenon lamp as the excitation source.
III Results and discussion
The morphology and size of the nanoparticles were analyzed by conventional and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies (TEM and HRTEM). Representative images of the four samples are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. The bright field images of undoped and Yb-doped samples (Fig. 1a, c, e and g) highlight the nanometric and aggregated aspects of the NPs. The particles are mostly spherical in shape with a size that decreases as a function of the Yb content. The particle size distribution was extracted from the different TEM images and the results are summarized in the histograms presented in Fig. 1b, d, f, and h. The size of the undoped SnO2 NPs is found to range between 14 and 24 nm, with a mean size of 19.6 nm. Upon light doping (0.69% and 1.23% of Yb) the mean size of the NPs decreases to 12.4 and 11.3 nm, respectively. The effect of the Yb concentration is particularly remarkable at a doping level of 3.51%, for which this value is as small as 6.6 nm. These results highlight the gradual decrease of the average particle size when increasing the Yb doping, which can be attributed to the larger ionic size of Yb with respect to Sn. The insertion of Yb in the SnO2 matrix induces strain, thus hampering the growth of large size particles. Moreover, it can be seen that the standard deviation of all size distributions is relatively small, which suggests a homogenous distribution of Yb ions inside the NPs.

A closer look into the NPs was performed by HRTEM. Fig. 2a, c, e and g give insight into the crystalline structure of the undoped and doped (0.69, 1.23 and 3.51% Yb) samples, respectively. These images reveal crystalline order in each nanoparticle, indicating successful crystallization of the synthesized material. The insets in each image show clearly the presence of well-defined atomic planes that can be easily indexed from the interplanar distance dhkl. The lattice parameter a can be further extracted from the relation: . A slight increase of the interplanar distance as a function of the doping level has been noticed. This can be easily seen in the inter-plane distance d110, which increases from 3.35 ± 0.03 Å to 3.40 ± 0.04 Å when the doping level varies from 0 to 3.51%. This result indicates an increase of the lattice parameter most likely due to the insertion of the Yb atoms into the host structure. Such a result is already expected from this particular doping. With the ionic radius of Yb3+ (0.086 nm) being larger than the ionic radius of Sn4+ (0.069 nm),52 the insertion of Yb into the structure would increase the unit cell volume, and therefore all the interplanar distances.
In order to have more precise values of the interplanar distances and the lattice parameter in the undoped and Yb-doped SnO2 nanoparticles, selected electron diffraction (SAED) patterns have been recorded for all samples. The patterns are shown in Fig. 2b, d, f, and h for undoped, and 0.69, 1.23 and 3.51 at% doped samples, respectively. The patterns are constituted of circular diffraction rings and are typical of polycrystalline samples. The patterns can be indexed using the SnO2 tetragonal rutile phase. It is important to underline that increasing the Yb content does not affect the crystalline phase of the NPs nor its nature. The circular rings are more continuous for the doped NPs when compared to the undoped ones. Such behavior is likely related to the better statistics when applied to smaller size NPs. As expected the interatomic distances dhkl and lattice parameter a increase with the Yb doping concentration. The tables in the inset of each SAED pattern giving the dhkl of the most intense diffraction planes clearly support the Yb insertion in the host structure. These results are confirmed at large scale using X-ray diffraction (Fig. 3). The samples are polycrystalline, without spurious phases, and show diffraction peaks that become wider as the doping level increases, thus indicating a decrease of the crystallite size. This size, calculated using the Scherrer formula (and without taking into account additional instrumental factors) is about 29.8, 17.4, 8.9, and 7.0 nm for the undoped and doped samples (Yb concentrations of 0.69 at%, 1.23 at% and 3.51 at%), respectively. The very close values obtained by XRD and TEM (Fig. 1) for the highly doped samples suggest that most NPs are single crystals.
 Fig. 3  X-ray diffraction patterns of the undoped and Yb-doped SnO2 NPs with Yb concentrations of 0.69 at%, 1.23 at% and 3.51 at%. The spectra recorded on the doped samples were shifted along the vertical axis for visibility reasons. The vertical lines show the positions of the SnO2 diffraction peaks according to the International Center for Diffraction Database (ICDD), card number 00-041-1445. 
The surroundings of Yb atoms inserted into the SnO2 nanoparticles have been explored by means of XPS. The survey spectra recorded in the 0–1300 eV binding energy range for the synthesized samples are shown in Fig. 4a. The 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 5s and 5p levels of Sn, the 1s, 2s and 2p levels of O, and the 4s, 4p and 4d levels of Yb have been successfully identified. No other elements could be observed in the detection limit of our XPS set-up, except carbon which is due to surface contamination. This result is in line with EDS observations. The C 1s binding energy position is used as a reference to determine the binding energies of the other elements. As it can be noticed in Fig. 4b, the C 1s peak has the same position and intensity for all samples. Therefore, the change in the other XPS spectra originates from a change in the NP structure, particularly related to the atomic environment.
 Fig. 4  Survey (a), C 1s core level (b), valence band (c) and Yb 4d level (d) XPS spectra of the undoped and Yb-doped SnO2 NPs. The horizontal arrow (→) in (c) suggests a decrease of the band gap when increasing the Yb concentration. 
A closer look at the valence bands reported in Fig. 4c allows rapid identification of the dominant oxide within the structure.53 All samples exhibit three bands at 5, 8 and 11 eV that generally arise from the hybridization of the atomic orbitals of Sn and O. The band at 5 eV corresponds mainly to O 2p derived levels. The band at 8 eV is due to the ppσ hybridization between Sn 5p and O 2p orbitals. Finally, the band at 11 eV originates mainly from Sn 5s–O 2p bonding states.54,55 The simultaneous presence of these three bands indicates that the structure is that of SnO2, which is in agreement with the TEM results. It is interesting to note that the intensity of the O 2p band is the same for all samples while that of the Sn 5p–O 2p and Sn 5s–O 2p increases with the Yb doping level. This is interesting behavior, which suggests that the presence of Yb atoms within the structure either promotes the hybridization between the atomic orbitals of Sn and O or is responsible for additional effects. The enhancement of the hybridization could be explained by a compressed lattice parameter, i.e. the Sn–O distance, which is opposite to what is observed from the TEM and XRD measurements. Another possibility could originate from the Yb 4f line. Indeed, according to ref. 56, the binding energy of these levels is observed at 8 and 11 eV, thus matching the Sn 5p (5s)–O 2p interactions. Moreover, a clear shift of the valence band edges toward lower binding energies can be noticed. Similar observations were reported by Egdell et al.57 In their case, the shift of the valence band onset toward higher binding energies upon doping with Sb was attributed to the increase of the band gap. In our case, the shift is gradual toward lower binding energies, which suggests a decrease of the band gap with the doping level of Yb. This is confirmed by UV-vis absorption measurements reported further in this work which indicate clearly a decrease of the band gap upon doping.
In spite of the relatively low concentrations of Yb in the structure, the Yb 4d5/2 and 4d3/2 levels have been successfully identified using high-resolution XPS (HR-XPS) experiments. The spectra are presented in Fig. 4d. The Yb 4d5/2 and 4d3/2 spin–orbit doublet peaks are found around 186 and 199 eV for all samples. Such peak positions are characteristics of a 3+ oxidation state of Yb.58 This indicates that Yb ions are well inserted into the structure and bound to oxygen. Such a condition is required, although not sufficient, for efficient spectral conversion. Moreover, the intensity of the Yb 4d levels increases with increasing the doping level, meaning that most of the incorporated Yb atoms are bound within the structure. The NPs doped with 3.51 at% of Yb exhibit a slight shift of the Yb peak toward lower energies. This indicates a change in the atomic environment of the rare earth, which is expected for such a doping level.
The Yb ions, being well inserted into the SnO2 and bound to oxygen, meet part of the criteria for efficient spectral conversion. In the following the absorption of the functionalized SnO2 NPs as well as their interaction with the incident light is discussed.

Fig. 5a shows the absorption spectra of the different samples as a function of the Yb content over the UV-visible-NIR range. It appears that all NP samples exhibit strong absorption in the UV-blue range with an edge extending over 200 nm. In the case of the undoped NPs, the maximum of absorption is obtained at 300 nm with an absorption threshold ranging between 480 and 550 nm. These observations are consistent with reported studies on undoped SnO2 thin films or nanoparticles.59 Adding Yb into the structure leads to a progressive extension of the NP absorption towards the blue range. This is witnessed by the gradual redshift of the absorption edges in Fig. 5a indicating a decrease of the band gap. The optical band gaps for the doped and undoped samples calculated from the Tauc plots (Fig. 5b) are much lower than the one expected for SnO2 (about 3.6 eV). Assuming a direct band gap, the values for the doped and undoped samples are 2.9 and 2.7 eV, respectively. With increasing the doping concentration from 0.69 to 3.51%, the band gap decreases slightly from 2.74 to 2.72 eV (inset of Fig. 5b). Note that assuming an indirect band gap leads to even smaller values for which a reasonable explanation is hard to find. This reinforces our opinion that SnO2 is a direct band gap semiconductor, in agreement with earlier reports.60,61 The reduced gap of the undoped sample is probably due to a large concentration of defects (as will be evidenced further by PL measurements). This gap is further reduced by doping. Indeed, Yb ions substituting Sn ions in the SnO2 matrix lead to an increase of the lattice parameter as evidenced by XRD and TEM. If theoretical studies seem to claim an increase of the band gap with the increase of the lattice parameter,62 other studies suggest that the increase of the lattice parameter by large-size ion doping leads to a reduced band gap.60,61 The band gap reduction is in agreement with the XPS observations regarding the shift of the valence band edge. In the doped samples, an additional absorption feature is observed in the NIR region of the absorption spectra ranging from 870 to 1040 nm (Fig. 5a). The intensity of this absorption band is proportional to the Yb content and is assigned to the typical absorption of Yb atoms.63,64 This means that Yb3+ ions are optically active.

(b) Tauc plots used to determine the optical band gap of the sample assuming direct transitions. In the inset the variation of the gap with the doping level is reported. 
In order to check the possible spectral conversion using the Yb3+ ions, photoluminescence measurements have been carried out using a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm) as the excitation source. Fig. 6 compares the emission spectra of the undoped and 0.69 at% Yb-doped SnO2 samples. Upon direct excitation both samples exhibit a rich emission spectrum covering a wide wavelength range. The undoped NPs show a broad and strong emission band from the visible to NIR (400–900 nm range) centered at around 650 nm. This emission is essentially arising from structural defects in the SnO2 structure that are related to the preparation technique. Among these defects O vacancies, Sn atoms in interstitial sites, dislocations and grain boundaries are the main luminescent centers in such oxide-based materials.65–69 In such a case, it is interesting to underline that when using undoped SnO2 nanoparticles, spectral conversion from UV to visible light can be already performed through the intermediate states within the SnO2 band gap induced by structural defects.
 Fig. 6  Emission spectra of undoped and Yb-doped SnO2 NPs (0.69 at%) under Nd:YAG laser excitation of 355 nm. The inset shows the variation of the PL intensity recorded at 972 nm for SnO2 samples with different Yb content. 
Doping these SnO2 NPs with Yb3+ ions leads to a dramatic decrease of the emission band centered at 650 nm but results also in the appearance of a small feature at 375 nm and two narrow and intense emission peaks in the NIR region. The decrease of the defect-related emission band can be explained by the decrease of radiative defects induced by the Yb3+ insertion. A change in the type and density of these defects cannot be excluded either. The weak emission peak in the UV is most likely the excitonic peak of SnO2 and can be attributed to band-to-band transitions. In terms of energy, the band gap of bulk SnO2 is around 3.6 eV. This value can vary depending on the structure (thin films, nanocrystals) and the preparation technique. The presence of such a feature at 3.31 eV represents the band gap value of our material. On the other hand, the two narrow peaks at 972 and 1005 nm correspond well to radiative transitions from the 2F5/2 excited state to the 2F7/2 ground state of the Yb3+ ions.30 Such a result indicates that the optically active Yb3+ ions are successfully sensitized by SnO2 thus indicating energy transfer. Incident UV light can be therefore efficiently converted into NIR light. The inset in Fig. 6 shows the evolution of the Yb3+ PL as a function of the Yb content. A linear increase of the Yb3+ related PL can be observed, indicating that in this structure the NIR emission is promoted by increasing the Yb concentration to 3.51 at% without photoluminescence quenching.
Based on the energy level structures of lanthanides reported by Dieke,70 it is expected that Yb3+ possesses only one single excited state 2F5/2 which is located approximately at 1.32 eV above the ground state 2F7/2. The photoluminescence data of our NPs exhibit two narrow emission peaks at 1.27 and 1.23 eV. The existence of more than one single emission peak could be explained in terms of the crystal field splitting of the two electronic levels of Yb3+.
In order to get more insight into the energy levels of Yb3+ in the SnO2 structure, a photon emission experiment under a xenon excitation wavelength of 300 nm of the doped samples was carried out. The resulting spectrum of the sample containing 0.69 at% of Yb is displayed in Fig. 7. Remarkably, eight Gaussian components were necessary to fit the experimental spectrum. Thereby, the deconvolution of this emission allowed constructing the electronic level structure (energy level diagram) of Yb3+ as shown in the inset of Fig. 7. Considering the (2J + 1)/2 Stark splitting of the 2S+1LJ energy levels (where J is the total angular momentum), 2F5/2 can be deconvoluted into three sublevels (A, B and C) while the 2F7/2 levels can be deconvoluted into four sublevels (A′, B′, C′ and D′). The position of each sublevel depends strongly on the crystal field of the host matrix. In our case we have found that the A′, B′ and C′ sublevels are located at about 0.11, 0.06 and 0.04 eV above the ground state D′ (E = 0 eV), while the A, B and C sublevels are positioned at 1.31, 1.29 and 1.27 eV above the D′ energy level.
 Fig. 7  Gaussian deconvolution of the room temperature Yb emission spectra recorded under xenon lamp excitation (300 nm) of the Yb-doped SnO2 NPs (0.69 at%). The inset shows the energy level structure of Yb3+ ions including the (2J + 1)/2 Stark components of the 2F5/2 and 2F7/2 multiplet. In order to identify easily the correspondence between the electronic transitions and the PL lines constituting the spectrum, the transitions and peaks were labeled from 1 to 8. 
These results are in line with those reported by Antic-Fidancev et al.71 who reported on the splitting of the 2F5/2 and 2F7/2 levels of Yb3+ ions in a cubic sesquioxide host material (Y2O3) where the local environment of Yb ions is very similar to the one of Yb inside the SnO2 rutile structure. Note that Dieke has reported slightly different values of the 2F5/2 multiplet of Yb3+ in the Yb:YAG structure.70 In this case, the A, B and C sublevels are centered at around 1.32, 1.31 and 1.28 eV above the ground state. Such values do not present a significant variation, yet they are coherent with the crystal field effect.
It was shown above that Yb3+ ions inserted into the SnO2 matrix exhibit several NIR emission bands under UV excitation, indicating energy transfer from SnO2 to the embedded RE element. In order to have more details of the transfer process and identify the exact wavelength range in which this phenomenon occurs, the absorbance spectrum of the 1.23 at% Yb-doped sample and the excitation spectrum of Yb3+ in the same sample are plotted in Fig. 8. The excitation spectrum is recorded by monitoring the detection at 972 nm (where the main emission of Yb3+ is observed) while varying the excitation wavelength from 250 to 600 nm. Fig. 8 shows that a significant luminescence signal at 972 nm can be obtained when exciting in the deep UV with an optimum at 275 nm (for which the maximum PL of Yb3+ was recorded). Moreover, the excitation range of Yb matches the absorption region of the SnO2 matrix, suggesting that when the SnO2 absorbs the UV light, the Yb ions emit NIR photons. Furthermore, it can be noticed from Fig. 8 that the SnO2 NPs absorb the UV-visible light in the 200–600 nm range but transfer energy only in the 250–450 nm range to Yb3+.
 Fig. 8  Absorbance and PL excitation spectra recorded on Yb-doped SnO2 NPs (1.23 at%). 
Different transfer mechanisms can be proposed as schematically shown in Fig. 9. Upon UV excitation, the excited electrons from the conduction band of SnO2 can relax to lower energy states and simultaneously excite a 4f electron of the Yb3+. The electron relaxation can occur in two ways: (i) band to band transitions or (ii) via the localized intermediate states within the band gap of SnO2 generated by structural defects. A second process can be identified as electronic transfer where Yb atoms are very close to the transfer sites, and therefore the electrons will jump directly to an excited state of Yb3+.

IV Conclusion
Undoped and Yb-doped SnO2 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized using the sol–gel method. TEM microscopy analysis demonstrated the formation of small well-crystallized nanoparticles with sizes ranging between 3.5 and 24 nm. XPS measurements have revealed that the Yb atoms are well inserted in the host matrix and have a 3+ valence state. The nanoparticles present strong absorption in the UV-visible and NIR regions corresponding to the SnO2 matrix and Yb3+ ions, respectively. An extension of the nanoparticle absorption over the blue region is observed when increasing the Yb concentration. Upon direct excitation of the SnO2 nanoparticles in the UV (at 355 nm) strong Yb3+ photoluminescence has been recorded in the NIR region, thus proving efficient energy transfer from the host matrix to the dopant.
The deconvolution of the photoluminescence spectra of Yb allowed building for the first time the energy level diagram of Yb in SnO2 with the exact positions of the 2F5/2 and 2F7/2 multiplets as well as identifying the optical transitions recorded in the PL spectra. The PLE analysis also allowed identifying the exact wavelength region where the energy transfer between the SnO2 host matrix and Yb3+ occurs. Thus, the insertion of the Yb3+ ions into the SnO2 nanoparticles allowed the conversion of the incident UV into NIR light. Such results open opportunities of down conversion for solar cell applications.
