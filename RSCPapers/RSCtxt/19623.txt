    , Accepted 11th March 2020First published on 12th March 2020AbstractMost of the polymer acceptors for all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) are semi-crystalline. Amorphous polymer acceptors containing B ← N units represent a new class of acceptor materials and possess unique phase separation behaviours in all-PSCs. In this work, to study their phase separation morphology and all-PSC device performance, we select three polymer donors with an identical polymer backbone but different side chains to blend with an amorphous polymer acceptor (rr-PBN). Among the three polymer donors, J91 exhibits the strongest aggregation tendency in solution and moderate crystallinity in thin film. The J91:rr-PBN blend shows the most optimal phase separation morphology and the best all-PSC device performance. In comparison, J51 shows the least aggregation tendency in solution and the highest crystallinity in thin film. The all-PSC device of the J51:rr-PBN blend exhibits sub-optimal active layer morphology and poor photovoltaic performance. These results indicate that the aggregation tendency in solution of polymer donors is the dominant factor in the phase separation of semi-crystalline polymer donor/amorphous polymer acceptor blends in all-PSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have received widespread attention in the past two decades because of their great potential as next-generation thin-film photovoltaic technologies with flexibility, low cost and semi-transparency.1–4 An important class of organic solar cells are all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which use blends of polymer donors and polymer acceptors as an active layer.5–9 Compared with OSCs employing small molecules, all-PSCs have great advantages of excellent thermal stability and superior mechanical properties.10–13 At present, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-PSCs is lower than that of OSCs based on polymer donors and small molecular acceptors.14–21 This low efficiency is due to the non-optimal active layer morphology of all-PSCs. Scientists have made great efforts to tune the phase separation morphology of all-PSCs by optimizing the molecular weights, side chains and fluorine substitutes of polymer materials as well as the processing solvent.15,16,22–30 Despite these progress, it remains very challenging to rationally tune the phase separation morphology of polymer donor/polymer acceptor blends in all-PSCs.
As crystallization is the main driving force for phase separation of polymer blends, the crystallinity of polymers greatly affects the phase separation morphology of polymer blends. Because most of the polymer acceptors are semi-crystalline, they always can match some specific polymer donors to give efficient all-PSCs. On the other hand, our group has developed a new class of polymer acceptors containing boron–nitrogen coordination bonds (B ← N units).31–39 Recently, we have reported an amorphous polymer acceptor containing a B ← N unit, which can match various polymer donors to give efficient all-PSCs.40 The preliminary results indicate that the amorphous polymer acceptor shows unique phase separation behaviours. Moreover, Huang et al. have reported an amorphous polymer acceptor based on a new bulky building block based on B ← N units.41 They demonstrate a PCE as high as 8.78% in all-PSCs, which proves the promising future of amorphous polymer acceptors. This motivates us to systematically study all-PSCs based on the amorphous polymer acceptor, which is expected to provide new insight to the active layer morphology manipulation of all-PSCs.
In our previous paper, we have found that the phase separation of semi-crystalline polymer donor/amorphous polymer acceptor blends in active layers of all-PSCs is driven by the aggregation and crystallization of the polymer donors.40 Then we raise the next question. Which one, the aggregation tendency or the crystallinity, of polymer donors is the exact determinant factor in the phase separation morphology? We aim at addressing this question in this manuscript. We select three commercially available polymer donors with an identical polymer backbone but different side chains to blend with an amorphous polymer acceptor to fabricate all-PSCs. The three polymer donors exhibit different aggregation behaviours in solution and different crystallinity in thin film. The polymer donor with the strongest aggregation tendency and moderate crystallinity gives the best phase separation morphology and consequently the best all-PSC device performance. The polymer donor with the highest crystallinity and the least aggregation tendency shows sub-optimal morphology and the worst all-PSC device performance. These results indicate that the active layer morphology and the all-PSC device performance of amorphous polymer acceptors are mainly determined by the aggregation tendency in solution of the polymer donors.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Materials
We select poly[4-(5-(4,8-bis(5-(2-hexyldecyl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)-2-octyl-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]-triazole] (J51), poly[4-(5-(4,8-bis(5-(dodecylthio)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole] (J61) and poly[4-(5-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4-difluorothiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole] (J91) as the polymer donors,42–44 and choose poly[2-(6-(2,5-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-4-(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)-3,6-dioxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-1-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-7-methyl-5,5-diphenyl-5H-thieno[3′,2′:3,4][1,2]azaborolo[5,1-b]thiazol-4-ium-5-uide] (rr-PBN) as the polymer acceptor.40 The chemical structures of the polymer donors and the polymer acceptor are shown in Scheme 1a. All the three polymer donors possess the same conjugated backbone based on bithienyl-benzodithiophene (BDTT)-alt-fluorine substituted benzotriazole (FTAZ) but have different substituents. Compared with J61 and J91, J51 possesses a linear alkyl group on the FTAZ unit, which may reduce steric hindrance more than a branched alkyl group, thus resulting in increased crystallinity. The alkylthio substituent on the BDTT unit may increase the aggregation of J61. J91 owns the difluoro-substituents on the thienyl conjugated side chains of the BDTT unit, which will lead to a down-shifted HOMO energy level and enhanced aggregation.

As shown in Scheme 1b, the three polymer donors in thin film show similar absorption spectra with two peaks in the range of 400 to 620 nm. The absorption spectra of the three polymer donors are complementary to the absorption spectrum of the polymer acceptor, rr-PBN. The complementary absorption is beneficial for the effective sunlight utilization of the resultant all-PSC devices. The energy level diagram of the three polymer donors and the polymer acceptor is shown in Scheme 1c. J51, J61, J91 and rr-PBN show the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels (ELUMO) of −2.86, −2.90, −2.95 and −3.71 eV, and the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels (EHOMO) of −5.16, −5.22, −5.28 and −5.81 eV, respectively (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The large energy level offsets between the three polymer donors and the polymer acceptor are all adequate to drive the electron/hole transfer between them, which may enable the efficient organic photovoltaics.1,45 The EHOMO of J61 and J91 is lower than that of J51 due to their side chains.43,44 This would lead to enhanced open-circuit voltage (VOC) of J61- and J91-based all-PSC devices.46,47
2.2 Aggregation and crystallinity properties of polymer donors
Aggregation of polymer chains in solution plays an important role in the phase separation morphology in all-PSCs.15,24,25 This motivates us to study the aggregation behaviours of the three polymer donors, wherein the wavelength absorption band at ca. 540 nm is attributed to the isolated polymer chains and the long-wavelength absorption band at ca. 585 nm is ascribed to the aggregated polymer chains.48 Thus, the intensity ratio of the two absorption bands (A585/A540) reflects the degree of polymer aggregation in solution. At 30 °C, the A585/A540 values for J51, J61 and J91 are 0.93, 0.99 and 1.01 (Fig. 1), respectively. As the temperature increases from 30 °C to 90 °C, the relative intensity of the long wavelength absorption decreases, indicating partial dis-aggregation of polymer chains in solution at high temperature. At 90 °C, the A585/A540 values for J51, J61 and J91 are 0.76, 0.86 and 0.91, respectively. The larger variation of A585/A540 for J51 than those for J61 and J91 suggests that J51 exhibits slightly stronger temperature dependent aggregation.49 Nevertheless, the higher A585/A540 values at both 30 °C and 90 °C indicate that the aggregation of J61 and J91 is stronger than that of J51 in CB solution.50

We investigate the crystallinity of the three polymer donors in thin film by two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS). The 2D-GIWAXS patterns and one-dimensional (1D) line profiles are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding characterization parameters are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). J51 shows distinguishable (100) and (200) reflections at 0.26 and 0.52 Å−1 in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions as well as a strong (010) reflection at a q value of 1.74 Å−1 (the d-spacing is 3.62 Å) in the out-of-plane direction. The coherence lengths of the (100) and (010) reflections are 11.21 nm and 3.44 nm, respectively. These results indicate that J51 is semi-crystalline in thin films.42,48 For J61 and J91 thin films, only the in-plane (100) reflection and out-of-plane (010) reflection are observed. The coherence lengths (CL) of the (100) and (010) reflections are 6.78 nm and 2.93 nm for J61, and 5.55 nm and 2.23 nm for J91, respectively. Compared with those of J51, the absence of the (200) reflection peak and the smaller coherence lengths of J61 and J91 suggest decreased crystallinity in thin film despite their strong aggregation tendency in solution. The inconsistent aggregation tendency in solution and crystallinity in thin film have been demonstrated in other polymer donor systems.51 In addition, the three polymer donors adopt a face-on orientation in thin films, which is helpful for the charge transport in the all-PSC devices.52,53 As reported in our previous paper, the polymer acceptor rr-PBN shows no aggregation in solution and is amorphous in thin film (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†).

2.3 Active layer morphology
We further investigated the effect of aggregation tendency in solution and crystallinity in thin films of polymer donors on the active layer morphology of the three polymer donor:rr-PBN blends. The molecular ordering of polymers was studied by 2D-GIWAXS, and the phase separation morphology was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Fig. 3 gives the 2D-GIWAXS patterns and 1D line profiles of the three polymer blend films. Table S1 (ESI†) shows the corresponding parameters. The J51:rr-PBN blend shows a strong (100) reflection at a q value of 0.27 Å−1 in the in-plane direction and a profound (010) reflection at a q value of 1.72 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction. The CL values of (100) and (010) reflections for the J51:rr-PBN blend film are 7.65 nm and 2.74 nm, respectively. For the J61:rr-PBN blend film, the relevant CL values of (100) and (010) reflections are 5.49 and 2.22 nm, respectively. For the J91:rr-PBN blend film, the relevant CL values of (100) and (010) reflections are 5.52 nm, and 1.95 nm, respectively. As rr-PBN is amorphous and shows very weak diffraction signals (Fig. S4, ESI†), the reflection peaks in the three blends films all originate from the polymer donors.40 The (100) and (010) reflection CL values of the J61- and J91-based all-polymer blend films are smaller than those of the J51-based blend film, suggesting the decreased crystallinity of J61 and J91 in the blend film. This is in accordance with the crystallinity of the pure thin film of the three polymer donors.

The TEM images of the three active layers are shown in Fig. 4a–c. Short white fibers can be observed in the J51:rr-PBN blend film and are attributed to the polymer donor.40 For the J61:rr-PBN blend film, the quantity and length of the white fibers increased. Compared to the fiber clusters appearing in the J61:rr-PBN blend film, lots of long fibers with a diameter of ca. 20 nm form connected networks across most areas of the J91:rr-PBN blend film. For the conjugated polymers, the obvious fibers do not show high crystallinity, and the low-crystallinity polymer donors can also form fibrillar structures.54 The fibrous network of the J91:rr-PBN blend film provides electron/hole transporting channels and enables efficient exciton diffusion/dissociation,55 leading to the improved JSC and FF of the J91-based device. The AFM height images of the three active layers are shown in Fig. 4d–f, and the corresponding phase images are shown in Fig. 4g–i. Among the three polymer blend films, the J91:rr-PBN blend film shows the most coarse surface in the height image and exhibits the most obvious fibrous structure in the phase image, and the J51:rr-PBN blend film shows the smoothest surface and the least obvious fibrous structure. The root-mean-square roughness of the J51-, J61- and J91-based blend films are 0.644 nm, 0.667 nm, and 0.774 nm, respectively. The film morphologies disclosed in AFM agree well with the TEM results.

2.4 Photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs
To investigate the influence of aggregation tendency in solution and crystallinity in thin films of polymer donors on the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs, we fabricated all-PSC devices based on the blends of the three polymer donors and the polymer acceptor, rr-PBN. Scheme 1d shows the inverted device structure: ITO (indium tin oxide)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) plots and the corresponding photovoltaic characteristics of the different all-PSC devices are shown in Fig. 5a and listed in Table 1, respectively. The VOC, short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of the device based on the J51:rr-PBN blend are 0.89 V, 10.18 mA cm−2 and 42.5%, respectively, resulting in a PCE of 3.85%. When J61 is used as the polymer donor, the all-PSC device shows a VOC of 0.98 V, a JSC of 10.62 mA cm−2, an FF of 57.8% and a PCE of 5.12%. For the J91:rr-PBN based device, the VOC, JSC, FF and PCE further increase to 1.06 V, 12.23 mA cm−2, 51.5% and 6.67%, respectively. Compared with the J51-based device, the J61- and J91-based devices show increased VOC because of the downshifted EHOMO of the two polymer donors. Fig. 5b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the three all-PSC devices. The J51-, J61- and J91-based devices show a photoresponse in the range of 400–700 nm with the maximum EQE values of 54.2%, 57.8% and 65.3%, respectively. The J61- and J91-based devices show higher EQE values than the J51-based device. This is also consistent with the JSC values of the three devices and may be related to the improved active layer morphology. The interconnected networks in the active layer will improve charge transport and suppress charge recombination, leading to the improved JSC, FF and device performance.

2.5 Charge transport and recombination behaviors
The charge transport properties of the three active layers were studied by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method with the J–V curves of the hole- and electron-only devices. The measured J–V curves and the fitted results are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), and the calculated hole and electron mobilities are present in Table S2 (ESI†). The hole mobilities (μh)/electron mobilities (μe) of J51:rr-PBN, J61:rr-PBN, and J91:rr-PBN blend films are 1.03 × 10−4/1.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.50 × 10−4/6.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 3.65 × 10−4/2.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, corresponding to the μh/μe ratio of 6.78, 2.45 and 1.82, respectively. Considering the small CL and large d-spacing values of the (010) reflection in the J91:rr-PBN blend film cannot account for the improved charge transport, we speculate that the high and balanced charge carrier mobility of the J91:rr-PBN blend may be due to the interconnected fiber networks originated from the strong aggregation of J91.56,57 They can serve as efficient charge transporting channels, and the improved charge transport is advantageous to sweep the charges out of the active layer and reduce the charge combination in the all-PSC devices.58
The charge recombination behaviors of the three all-PSC devices were evaluated by the effective voltage (Veff) dependent photocurrent density (Jph) and the light intensity (Plight) dependent JSC and FF. The Jph–Veff plots are shown in Fig. 6a. As Veff increases, Jph grows rapidly at first (Veff < 0.5 V) and then slows down (Veff > 1 V), and does not saturate even at high voltages (Veff = 4 V) for all the three all-PSC devices, indicating incomplete charge collection under an electrical field. The calculated Jph,SC/Jph,sat values (the Jph,SC and Jph,sat are the Jph values under short-circuit and saturation conditions, respectively, and Jph,sat is selected from Jph at a Veff of 4 V for all the three devices) for J51-, J61- and J91-based devices are 75%, 78% and 82%, respectively. The increased Jph,SC/Jph,sat value of the J91-based device is consistent with the improved charge transport properties and suggests the most efficient charge collection.24,59 The JSC–Plight plots are shown in Fig. 6b. Generally, a power law of JSC ∝ Pαlight can be used to describe bimolecular recombination in photovoltaic devices, where a larger power-law exponent α indicates suppressed bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions.60,61 The α should be 1 when bimolecular recombination is negligible. The calculated α values for the J51-, J61- and J91-based devices are 0.91, 0.92 and 0.94, respectively. The highest α value of the J91:rr-PBN based device indicates that bimolecular recombination is mostly suppressed in this device. In addition, the FF of the J91-based device is less insensitive to the light intensity than those of J51- and J61-based devices (Fig. 6c), indicating the most effective charge extraction in the J91-based device. Compared with the J51- and J61-based devices, the J91-based device exhibits improved charge transport, suppressed charge recombination and enhanced charge extraction. This is consistent with its high JSC and FF, which may originate from the optimal active layer morphology.

Phase separation behaviors of amorphous polymer acceptors should be totally different from those of the intensively studied semi-crystalline polymer acceptors. In our previous paper, we have found that phase separation of amorphous polymer acceptors and semi-crystalline polymer donors in active layers in all-PSCs is driven by the aggregation and crystallization of the polymer donors.40 Then we raise an important question, which one, aggregation or crystallization or both, is the exact dominant factor for the phase separation of semi-crystalline polymer donor/amorphous polymer tendency in solution. The high crystallinity of J51 has been well preserved in the J51:rr-PBN blend film. However, the J51:rr-PBN blend film exhibits insufficient phase separation with homogenous mixing of the two polymers, resulting in low JSC and FF of the all-PSC device. J91 exhibits the strongest aggregation tendency in solution but moderate crystallinity. In the J91:rr-PBN blend film, the optimal phase separation morphology with a fibrous network is formed, leading to the excellent all-PSC device performance. These results indicate that the aggregation tendency of polymer donors in solution plays the dominant role in the phase separation of semi-crystalline polymer donor/amorphous polymer acceptor blends. Although the high crystallinity of polymer donors can be well preserved in the blend films, they are not adequate to provide ideal phase separation in the blend films with an amorphous polymer acceptor.
3. Conclusions
In summary, by blending three polymer donors with similar chemical structures with an amorphous polymer acceptor, we have studied the phase separation morphology of polymer blends and the photovoltaic performance of all-PSC devices. Among the three polymer donors, J91 exhibits the strongest aggregation tendency in solution and moderate crystallinity in thin film. The J91:rr-PBN blend shows the most optimal phase separation morphology and the best all-PSC device performance. In comparison, J51 shows the least aggregation tendency in solution and the highest crystallinity in thin film. The all-PSC device of the J51:rr-PBN blend exhibits sub-optimal active layer morphology and poor photovoltaic performance. These results indicate that the aggregation tendency in solution of the polymer donor is the dominant factor for the phase separation of semi-crystalline polymer donor/amorphous polymer acceptor blends in all-PSCs.
