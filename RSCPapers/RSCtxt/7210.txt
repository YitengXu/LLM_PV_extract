    , Accepted 10th January 2017First published on 11th January 2017AbstractHerein, we investigated the photovoltaic properties of carbazole-based diketopyrrolopyrroles with tetracyanobutadiene acceptor units as highly efficient non-fullerene acceptors together with a D–A conjugated polymer, P, as a donor for polymer solar cells. After optimization, i.e. donor to acceptor weight ratio and solvent vapour annealing, the polymer solar cells exhibited power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.86% and 7.19% for DPP7 and DPP8 as acceptors, respectively. These results indicate that slight changes in the chemical structure of the small acceptor molecule significantly increase the efficiency of the device. The design and synthesis of these non-fullerene acceptors with broader absorption spectra extended towards the near infrared region may be key for the further development of high-performance and cost-effective solution-processed organic solar cells.
Introduction
The use of solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSC) is a cost-effective approach due to their significant advantages, such as light weight, low-cost, and flexibility.1–3 Recently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells have been significantly improved but still lag behind compared to those of the blends of polymer donors and fullerene acceptors, which cross 10% efficiency.4–8 In most of the efficient PSCs, PC61BM/PC71BM are the most commonly used acceptors owing to their excellent properties9 such as (i) high electron mobility, (ii) delocalization of the LUMO over the entire molecule, which facilitates better electron transport, (iii) formation of domains from the solution-processed films with an appropriate length scale for exciton dissociation with a mixed phase with electron donors, (iv) exhibits reversible electrochemical reduction, which results in stable electrical and charge transport properties of the reduced charge species, and (v) 3D electron transfer and charge transfer. Although fullerene derivatives possess these excellent properties, they also suffer from certain drawbacks such as difficulty in controlling the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, low-open circuit voltage, poor photochemical stability, insufficient light absorption in the longer wavelength region, and high-cost of production. These drawbacks limit the further improvement in the performance of organic solar cells at a low-cost.10 To achieve high PCE of PSCs at a low-cost, it is imperative to search for new alternative electron acceptor molecules with larger non-planar conjugated structures to have favourable nanoscale phase separation and charge transport in the blended films. Therefore, the design and characterization of new low-cost non-fullerene acceptors that possess efficient absorption over the visible light region of the solar spectrum, excellent solubility, high charge carrier mobility, and matching energy levels with those of the donors are necessary for solution-processed BHJ polymer solar cells.
In recent years, considerable research efforts have been made to design the non-fullerene acceptors.11–22 The advantage of choosing non-fullerene D–A small-molecules over fullerene derivatives include tuning of electronic energy levels, absorption profiles, solubility parameters, and self-assembly tendencies. In a BHJ active layer, the optical bandgap of the acceptor can be reduced, thus elevating the HOMO energy level without losing the energy gap between the HOMO level of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor. In 1986, Tang et al. developed a non-fullerene acceptor material based on perylene diimide (PDI), which exhibited a PCE of 1% with copper phthalocyanine as the donor.23 Solution-processed BHJ organic solar cells based on a PDI acceptor with 6.1% PCE have been reported by Yao et al.24 Zhan et al. reported a fused-ring electron acceptor (ITIC-Th) based on an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]-thiophene core with thienyl side chains, which showed a PCE of 9.6%.25 More recently, a PCE of 11% has been achieved for a fullerene free polymer solar cell.26
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives are used as acceptors for OPVs due to certain attractive features such as broad absorption in the visible region, low-band gap, easily tunable energy levels, good photochemical and thermal stability, and facile synthetic modification.27,28,50 Chen et al. reported a spirobifluorene and DPP-based non-fullerene electron acceptor for efficient, thermally stable polymer solar cells.29 The electron accepting ability of DPP was further improved by fabricating a star-shaped DPP trimer with triphenylamine at the centre, which is the first example of a 3D non-fullerene acceptor, and it was explored for BHJ OPVs.30,31 The use of electron withdrawing groups, such as the cyano group, in the design of small molecular acceptors increases their electron mobility but decreases their LUMO energy level.13,32–34 Bhosale et al. recently reported a non-fullerene electron acceptor based on a central carbazole and terminal DPP unit with a 2.3% PCE.17 The motivation of choosing carbazole as end capping group is due to its good electron donating, charge transport abilities and various applications by connecting with DPP through different positions and use of various applications.35–40 Tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) is a strong acceptor unit that induces non-planarity to a molecule and its functionalization can provide a molecule with high electron affinity.41–46 Recently, we reported small molecule-based fullerene free electron acceptors containing triphenylamine, TCBD, and DPP units for BHJ organic solar cells.47
Herein, we investigated DPP7 and DPP8 as efficient acceptors along with a D–A conjugated polymer P for polymer solar cells. We utilized an A–D–A–D conjugated copolymer (P) (synthesized via a simple Stille coupling reaction)48 as the donor, which has complementary absorption to DPP to harvest photons covering from the visible to near infrared region of the solar spectrum. The optimized devices based on P:DPP7 and P:DPP8 (donor to acceptor ratio of 1:2 and solvent vapour annealing), show an overall PCE of 4.86% and 7.19%, respectively. The higher PCE value for the P:DPP8-based device is mainly due to the larger values of Jsc and FF, related to the broader absorption profile and stronger phase separation morphology of P:DPP8 compared to that of P:DPP7 and more balanced charge transport within the active layer.
Results and discussion
The small molecules DPP7 and DPP8 were synthesized via the reported procedure49 and the chemical structures of these small molecules are shown in Fig. 1. Both molecules are soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, and dichloromethane. Herein, the photovoltaic (OPV) properties of DPP7 and DPP8 were studied.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The normalized absorption spectra of DPP7 and DPP8 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution and thin films cast from THF are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption spectra show two bands in the vis-near infrared (400–500 nm and 550–900 nm) region. The insertion of an additional N-phenyl carbazole in DPP8 results in an enhanced absorption profile, which increases its light harvesting ability. The thin film absorption spectra of DPP7 and DPP8 are broader and red-shifted compared to the absorption spectra in the solution, indicating effective aggregation in the solid state due to the strong intermolecular π–π interaction derived from their highly conjugated backbone. The optical band gaps of DPP7 and DPP8 were estimated from the onset edge of the absorption spectra in the thin film, which are 1.52 eV and 1.36 eV, respectively. The absorption spectra of pristine DPP7 and DPP8 films with solvent vapour annealing (SVA) treatments are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It can be seen from this figure that the absorption spectra of these DPPs are red-shifted and the vibronic feature is enhanced, showing an increased aggregation tendency. This implies that there is an increased population of molecular transition dipoles that are arranged in a head to tail manner. This aggregation behaviour under SVA treatment may lead to charge transport properties, which has been discussed hereinafter. The absorption spectra of the SVA-treated thin film of the D–A polymer is also shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It can be seen from this figure that the ICT band is broadened and redshifted with a clear vibronic shoulder, thus indicating that the molecular ordering of the polymer also improves upon SVA treatment.

The ionization potential (IP) corresponds to the HOMO and the electron affinity (EA) corresponds to the LUMO energy levels of the donor and acceptor materials used in the BHJ active layer of the organic solar cells, which play an important role in high photovoltaic performances, and the HOMO or IP and LUMO or EA energy levels of the donor must lie higher than the corresponding energy levels of the acceptor. The energy differences (ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO) between the donor and acceptor should be larger than the binding energy of the exciton for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer. The IP/EA energy levels of DPP7 and DPP8 estimated from cyclic voltammetry measurements are 5.52/3.83 eV and 5.33/3.81 eV, respectively. In comparison to DPP7, the IP or HOMO energy level in DPP8 was shifted by 0.19 eV, whereas the EA or LUMO energy level was almost the same. The absorption spectra and electrochemical measurements clearly demonstrate that the introduction of additional N-phenyl carbazole donor units significantly reduce the bandgap by raising the HOMO energy level.
Photovoltaic properties
We selected a conjugated A–D–A–D copolymer consisting of fluorobenzotraizole and dithieno[3.2-b:2′,3′-d]silole as donor and acceptor units, respectively, which is denoted as P (chemical structure shown in Fig. 1) with an IP/EA energy level of 5.26 eV/3.33 eV and with an energy optical band gap of 1.79 eV, for use as a donor for the fabrication of solution-processed bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. The absorption profile of P is complementary (absorption spectrum of P is shown in Fig. S2, ESI†) to both DPP7 and DPP8, which is beneficial for the light harvesting ability of the active layer employed in PSC since both the donor and acceptor components can contribute to the exciton generation process. The PSCs were fabricated using the conventional ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate))/P:DPP7 or DPP8/PFN/Al structure. Poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was used as the cathode buffer layer in the organic solar cell. The donor to acceptor weight ratio was varied and THF was used as the solvent. It was found that the optimized ratio is 1:2 for the best performance for solar cells (the results are summarized in Table 1) for both DPPs, and then solvent vapour annealing (SVA) treatment of the optimized active layer (1:2 weight ratio) was adopted to improve the PCE of the devices, as reported in the literature.50,51 For the solvent annealing treatment, the films were subjected to chloroform vapour for a period of 60 s in a sealed Petri dish. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices based on optimized active layers, under AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination, are shown in Fig. 3a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The device based on optimized P:DPP7 and P:DPP8 active layers showed an overall PCE of 4.86% (Jsc = 10.56 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.94, and FF = 0.49) and 7.19% (Jsc = 13.78 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.90, and FF = 0.58), respectively. The polymer solar cells based on P as a donor along with PC71BM showed an overall PCE of 3.87% and 7.66%, when the active layers were processed with CF and DIO/CF, respectively.48 The increase in the PCE of the devices processed with the SVA-treated active layer compared to the devices with as cast active layers may be related to the increased crystallinity of the active layer and better charge transport induced by the SVA treatment. The PSCs exhibit high Voc values that are remarkable for PSCs with low-band gap acceptors, indicating that energy losses (Eloss = Eoptg − qVoc) in the devices are as low as 0.58 and 0.48 eV (ref. 52 and 53) for DPP7 and DPP8, respectively. The IPCE spectra of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 3b, which closely resemble the absorption spectra of the corresponding active layers (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, the optical absorption spectra of the blended film are a combination of DPPs and P. The IPCE spectra show two bands, i.e. in the lower wavelength region (450–600 nm) and beyond 650 nm, indicating that both the conjugated copolymer P donor and DPPs acceptor contribute to the exciton generation and photocurrent of the devices. P:DPP8 shows a broad IPCE response from 400 nm to 884 nm, whereas P:DPP7 is limited to 834 nm. Moreover, the IPCE values for P:DPP8 are higher than those of P:DPP7 for the entire wavelength, confirming the higher Jsc value of the device based on P:DPP8 compared to that of the P:DPP7-based device. The values of Jsc estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra are about 10.47 mA cm−2 and 13.66 mA cm−2 for the P:DPP7 and P:DPP8-based devices, respectively, which are consistent with the values observed in the J–V characteristics under illumination.

The photovoltaic parameters of the different devices based on the SVA treated optimized active layers are shown in Tables S1 and S2.† We checked the performance of the optimized devices after five days and found that the PCE of the devices with P:DPP7 and P:DPP8 active layers were about 4.45% and 7.02%, respectively.
To obtain information about the charge transport in the devices, we estimated the electron and hole mobilities by measuring the J–V characteristics of the hole only and electron only devices and space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. 5a and b for the hole only and electron only devices, respectively). The hole (μh)/electron mobilities (μe) for the optimized P:DPP7 and P:DPP8 films are calculated to be 1.28 × 10−4/0.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.32 × 10−4/0.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher value of electron mobility for the P:DPP8 active layer indicates that there is more balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 1.57) for the P:DPP8-based device compared that for P:DPP7 (μh/μe = 2.41), which may be one of the reasons for the higher FF for the device based on P:DPP8. Moreover, we estimated the μh/μe for the as cast active layer in a similar manner, which was found to be about 4.53 × 10−5/0.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.34 × 10−5/0.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P:DPP7 and P:DPP8, respectively, thus leading to the μh/μe value of 3.77 and 2.54 for P:DPP7 and P:DPP8, respectively. These results indicate that the charge transport in the as cast active layer is unbalanced, resulting in low FF, Jsc, and PCE values.

To obtain information about the charge recombination and exciton dissociation processes occurring in the devices, we measured the variation of Jsc with light intensity,54,55 as shown in Fig. 6. Both the devices showed a power dependence of Jsc on illumination intensity (I), which is expressed as Jsc ∝ Iγ, where γ is the exponent factor. The values of γ for the P:DPP7 and P:DPP8-based devices are 0.91 and 0.95, respectively. Compared to P:DPP7, the value of γ in the P:DPP8-based device is higher, indicating reduction of the bimolecular recombination in the device.
 Fig. 6  Light intensity dependence of Jsc for the devices. 
The variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff)56 is shown in Fig. 7. The measured Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is described as Veff = Vo − Vappl, where Vappl is the applied voltage and Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero. Moreover, the exciton dissociation and charge transfer probability (Pc) is estimated as Pc = Jsc/Jphsat, where Jphsat is the saturation current density at a higher Veff (Fig. 7). The values of Pc are 0.84 and 0.89 for the P:DPP7 and P:DPP8-based devices, respectively, indicating that the device based on the DPP8 acceptor has a high exciton dissociation efficiency at the donor/acceptor interfaces and effective charge transport. The reduced bimolecular recombination and higher Pc value for the P:DPP8 device compared to those for P:DPP7 may be attributed to its high values of Jsc and FF for PSC. We measured the exciton dissociation rate (Gmax) using Gmax = Jphsat/qL, where q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer, which was found to be about 1.02 × 1026 m−3 and 1.29 × 1026 m−3 for the P:DPP7 and P:DPP8 active layers, respectively. The higher value of Gmax is related to the broader absorption profile of P:DPP8, relative to that for P:DPP7, which results in a higher Jsc and PCE for the P:DPP8-based device.

To understand the correlation between the molecular structure and the performance of the OSCs based on the different DPPs acceptors processed under different conditions, the crystallinity of pristine DPPs films and P:DPPs thin films was characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Fig. 8a and b show the XRD patterns of the pristine DPPs and P:DPP8 thin films processed using THF and SVA treatment. The pristine P shows a sharp diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.28° corresponding to the lamellar stacking of P chains with a d-spacing of 1.68 nm and a wider diffraction peak at 2θ = 22.48°, which corresponds to the π–π stacking distance of 0.36 nm.48 The DPP7 and DPP8 thin films cast from THF show a diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.96° and 2θ = 6.13°, respectively (Fig. 8a), which corresponds to the d-spacing of 1.23 nm and 1.12 nm, respectively. It can be seen that the diffraction peak for DPP8 is stronger than that for DPP7, which indicates that more ordered stacking exists in DPP8, due to the additional N-phenyl carbazole donor unit and consequential improved crystallinity, which is in agreement with the absorption spectra of DPP8. The XRD patterns of the as cast and SVA-treated blended films (P:DPP8) are shown in Fig. 8b. Since both DPP and P show diffraction peaks in the range of 5.2–6.2°, it is reasonable to conclude that both P and DPPs form crystalline domains in the blended films. The intensity of the peaks increased after the SVA treatment, which indicates that the processing additive significantly enhances the crystallinity of both P and DPPs in the active layer and thus increases the degree of order and improves the charge carrier transport, resulting in a higher PCE.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to obtain information about the morphologies of the blended films, and the images obtained are shown in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9, the P:DPP8 blend film exhibits a stronger phase separation property than its P:DPP7 counterpart. This stronger phase separation leads to more efficient exciton dissociation into free charge carrier and charge transport towards the respective electrodes and is beneficial for a high Jsc and FF, thus confirming the higher PCE for the P:DPP8-based device than that for P:DPP7-based devices.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we studied the solar cell properties of two narrow band gap small molecules, DPP7 and DPP8, as acceptors with a D–A copolymer P as the donor, (D/A ratio of 1:2 and solvent vapour annealing), which give an overall PCE of 4.85% and 7.19% for the active layers, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the 7.19% PCE is the highest value for a DPP-based acceptor. The higher efficiency for the device based on DPP8 is mainly due to the larger Jsc and FF values compared to those of its DPP7 counterpart, which are related to the broader absorption profile of P:DPP8 and more balanced charge transport. These results demonstrate that employing an additional N-phenyl carbazole donor unit in the backbone of the small molecule provides great opportunities for the molecular design of low-band gap acceptors with a high Voc and low energy loss, which provides important progress for non-fullerene organic solar cells and illustrate that non-fullerene acceptors have significant potential to compete with fullerene derivatives and can be paired with other polymers.
