    , Accepted 30th April 2018First published on 30th April 2018AbstractElectromotive force of photovoltaics is a key to define the output power density of photovoltaics. Multiple exciton generation (MEG) exhibited by semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has great potential to enhance photovoltaic performance owing to the ability to generate more than one electron–hole pairs when absorbing a single photon. However, even in MEG-based photovoltaics, limitation of modifying the electromotive force exists due to the intrinsic electrochemical potential of the conduction band-edges of QDs. Here we report a pronouncedly improved photovoltaic performance by constructing a PbS QD-sensitized electrode that comprises plasmon-active Au nanoparticles embedded in a titanium dioxide thin film. Significant enhancement on electromotive force is characterized by the onset potential of photocurrent generation using MEG-effective PbS QDs with a narrow bandgap energy (Eg = 0.9 eV). By coupling with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), such QDs exhibit improved photoresponses and the highest output power density over the other QDs with larger bandgap energies (Eg = 1.1 and 1.7 eV) under visible light irradiation. The wavelength-dependent onset potential and the output power density suggest effective electron injection owing to the enhanced density of electrons excited by energy overlapping between MEG and LSPR.
Introduction
By taking advantage of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metal nanoparticles (NPs), an emerging class of plasmonic photovoltaic devices provides a unique approach to advance photoenergy conversion techniques.1–3 The oscillations of free electrons in metal nanoparticles excited by incident light result in a highly localized electromagnetic field at the metal NP surface. Such localized electromagnetic field effectively confines the absorbed photon energy at the NP surface and induces an intense electromagnetic field gradient surrounding the NPs. When semiconductor nanostructures were close to plasmonic metal NPs, the unique characteristics of LSPR not only modify light harvesting efficiencies for normal bandgap excitation,4 but also alter the selection rules for electronic excitation and even form new hybridized states in the regime of strong coupling.5 Consequently, enhanced excitons or electron–hole pairs are expected to be created in semiconductor nanostructures by matching the energy of LSPR. Recent studies related to the coupling systems using semiconductor nanostructures and plasmonic metal NPs have included the well-known photoexcitation of normally forbidden electronic transitions in single-walled carbon nanotubes,6 the manipulation of forbidden transitions between discrete quantum levels in CdSe nanorods,7 and the creation of exotic excited states between plasmons and CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals arising from the Rabi splitting energy.8 Additionally, effective electron transfer has been shown via plasmon-induced interfacial charge-transfer transitions in strong coupling between plasmons and CdSe nanorods.9 Although plasmon-induced excitations have been experimentally examined,10,11 the methods for straightforwardly investigating photocurrents, especially the electrochemical potentials of plasmon-excited electrons and holes in semiconductor nanostructures, are still under active investigation.12
Photocurrent generation systems that employ colloidal quantum dots (QDs) as sensitizers have attracted much attention as next-generation photoenergy devices because of their tunable electrical and optical properties based on size-dependent quantum confinement. Lead sulfide, PbS, for example, is of interest in solar applications owing to its small bulk bandgap of 0.41 eV and a large Bohr exciton radius of 18 nm, which together with quantum confinement allows bandgap tuning over the full solar spectral range.13 Absorption of photons with energies higher than a semiconductor's bandgap produces electron–hole pairs (EHP) (process I, Fig. 1a), each with excess kinetic energy above its respective band edge. Such kinetic energy is usually dissipated as heat (process II) rather than converting into electricity (process IV) due to fast recombination processes (process VI) that lead to short carrier lifetimes. However, when this initially excited EHP has sufficient excess energy greater than the bandgap energy (Eg), it is able to transfer the excess to a valence band electron, exciting it across the bandgap to the conduction band forming a second EHP whilst allowing the first EHP to relax back toward the conduction band edge (process III). The process of generating more than one exciton when absorbing a single photon is known as multiple exciton generation (MEG) or carrier multiplication.14–16 As a consequence of distinct relative masses of electrons and holes, the energy threshold for MEG is based on the conservation of momentum and energy, resulting in a threshold of 2.6 times Eg for PbS QDs.17,18 Reducing the size of the QDs increases the special confinement of the EHP and affects the conduction band minimum by breaking the degeneracy of the 1S state, namely relaxed momentum conservation,19 thus lowering the MEG threshold for relatively small QDs (e.g. 2.4 times Eg17,18). The MEG-related intrinsic properties of colloidal PbS QDs with various sizes have been intensely studied.20–26 However, MEG-induced photoelectric conversion using PbS QDs has undergone limited reporting to date with the apparent enhancement only generated under exposure to ultraviolet or near-ultraviolet visible light.27 Plasmon-induced highly intense excitation based on MEG has been receiving less attention.

Our previous research28 demonstrated the generation of excitation modes of PbS QDs interacting with plasmonic gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and confirmed enhanced photoelectric conversion in the short visible light range, in addition to traditional enhancement in the near-infrared range.29 Analogous to the electromagnetic field confinement in the gap between adjacent metal NPs,30 semimetal and dielectric PbS QDs well-coupled with Au NPs also enhance the electromagnetic field generated by LSPR,31 and such metallic coupling yields visible light excitation. As lead chalcogenides have distinct characteristics of quantum confinement induced symmetry breaking on optical transitions32 and hot electron–hole pair-induced transient Stark effect,33 it is rational to expect that LSPR progresses to absorption of PbS QDs and consequently expands photoelectrical responses in a wavelength range with photon energies exceeding the MEG threshold.
Herein we demonstrate the modification of the photo-electrochemical responses of size-controlled PbS QDs excited by LSPR of Au NPs which are fabricated within TiO2 thin films. By overlapping the energies of LSPR excitation and MEG, highly localized excitation promotes electron excitation and injection (process V, Fig. 1a), consequently affects the electromotive force defined by the photocurrent onset potential that shifts towards a higher electrochemical potential. Expected improvement of the electromotive force results in enhanced output power density as well as photoelectric conversion efficiency over a wide wavelength region from near ultraviolet to near infrared. The system demonstrates the validity of plasmon enhancement on the photovoltaic performance using quantized particles in a wide variety of sizes based on MEG.
Results and discussion
Characterization of size-controlled PbS QD-sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2
An electrode that comprises Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) embedded in a TiO2 thin film (TiO2/Au/TiO2) was prepared according to our previous report.28 Au NPs with an average diameter of 20.6 ± 6.3 nm result in a peak maximum of LSPR at around 580 nm in the range of 1.77–2.58 eV according to extinction spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†), and this LSPR region is highlighted in yellow in Fig. 1b. Oleic acid-capped size-controlled PbS QDs were synthesized using a hot-injection method.34 Colloidal PbS QDs were loaded onto the substrate by drop-casting with the quantity being loaded based upon ICPE quantitative analysis (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†). The PbS QDs are named according to their absorption maxima, which correspond to their 1st exciton peak wavelengths (Fig. 1b). Three samples are OP-1344, OP-1101, and OP-728. The average bandgaps (Eg) were determined from their 1st exciton peaks found to be 0.9 ± 0.04, 1.1 ± 0.05, and 1.7 ± 0.14 eV (ranging from infrared to visible light). The half-widths of the absorption maxima (Fig. 1b) resulted in error evaluation can be seen in Table S4, ESI.† And the average diameters were estimated to be 4.8, 3.7, and 2.3 nm35 and were confirmed by TEM (Fig. S3, ESI†). Within a Bohr radius of 18 nm, all of these PbS QDs exhibit strong quantum confinement. Notably, the LSPR energy region is able to couple with more than twice Eg for both OP-1344 and OP-1101, while the overlap between LSPR and the Eg of OP-728 is practically limited. Fig. 1c shows the size-dependent energies of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of PbS QDs, which were calculated according to the ionization energy values for bulk PbS36 (ESI†). The energy band positions indicate the possibility for photocurrent via electron injection from photoexcited PbS QDs to TiO2, as well as hole transfer from PbS QDs to S2− in the electrolyte.37
Potential-dependent photovoltaic performance
Photoelectrochemical measurements on the prepared TiO2/Au/TiO2 or TiO2 substrates sensitized with size-controlled PbS QDs were performed using a three-electrode system in an electrolyte solution of 0.05 M Na2S and 0.1 M NaOH (Fig. S4, ESI†). A three-electrode system is a way to accurately determine the potential of the working electrode by introducing an Ag/AgCl reference electrode referred to the absolute potential vs. vacuum38,39 (all potentials in this work are reported vs. this reference electrode unless otherwise stated). In this system, the electrochemical potential of the Fermi level of the working electrode is under control with respect to the reference electrode.40Fig. 2 shows the observed photocurrent densities of OP-728, OP-1101, and OP-1344 sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2 and TiO2 substrates recorded by steady-state on–off responses under monochromatic irradiation from 450 to 650 nm in the potential region from −0.8 to 0.5 V (Fig. S5, ESI†). As the potential becomes positive, the photocurrent density increases in all the systems. This is because the Fermi level of the TiO2 electrode controlled by the electrochemical potential plays an essential role in controlling charge separation and recombination of excited electron–hole pairs in PbS QDs (Fig. S6, ESI†). Recombination is promoted when the potential becomes more negative than the TiO2 flat band potential (UFB, −0.63 V41) because electron injection is inhibited; in contrast, when the Fermi level is downshifted to be more positive than UFB, accelerated charge separation via effective electron injection from PbS QDs to TiO2 prevents recombination. It is noteworthy that our previous work29 has carefully examined the effect of ultra-thin TiO2 layer on the Au/TiO2 electrode to prevent the direct plasmonic oxidation of donors in the absence of QDs as well as the recombination of the excitons via Förster resonance energy transfer by optimizing the thickness. In contrast to the electrons created from PbS QDs, as if there is another TiO2 layer covering on Au/TiO2, the plasmon-generated hot electrons from Au have been confirmed to be rather limited, that is cal. ∼10% contribution to the total photocurrent even if the loading amount of PbS QDs was the lowest value.29

(a) OP-1344, (b) OP-1101 and (c) OP-728 sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2 (upper) and TiO2 (down) substrates upon irradiation at 450 (blue), 500 (cyan), 550 (green), 600 (orange), and 650 (red) nm, in the potential range from −0.8 V to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the electrolyte of 0.05 M Na2S and 0.1 M NaOH. PbS particle densities within a single layer domain are 2.7 × 1011, 5.9 × 1011 and 2.6 × 1012 cm−2, respectively. The mole number densities of PbS are all near 0.5 nmol cm−2. Vertical dashed lines present the onset potential (ϕonset) corresponding to the electrochemical potential at 10% of the photocurrent density measured at 0.5 V and irradiated at 450 nm. 
The onset potential of photocurrent generation (ϕonset) in the present system defines the absolute potential of excited electrons. One can determine the maximum electromotive force (ϕ) of photovoltaics as the difference between the potential values of ϕonset and the valence band edge (ϕVB), as shown below. ϕ = ϕVB − ϕonset(1)
The size and excitation wavelength of the QDs significantly influence photocurrent generation. Distinct size-dependent behaviour is investigated, as shown in Fig. 2 where the mole number densities of PbS are all near 0.5 nmol cm−2. One prominent result is that it is OP-1344 coupled with Au NPs that states to produce photocurrent at a more negative potential. We define ϕonset as the electrochemical potential at 10% of the photocurrent density at 0.5 V (details and error evaluation on ϕonset can be seen in Fig. S7, ESI†). The dashed lines shown in Fig. 2 represent ϕonset under irradiation at 450 nm, giving −0.58, −0.41 and −0.27 V for OP-1344, OP-1101 and OP-728, respectively. Consequently, in the potential range from −0.6 to −0.3 V, OP-1344 produces the highest photocurrent density compared with OP-1101 and OP-728. Such a negative shift of the photocurrent onset by OP-1344 illustrates that the large-sized QDs–Au NPs coupling system has the advantage of effective electron injection over recombination processes. The shift of the onset potential to a negative value proves that ϕ generated by the OP-1344 system becomes the highest compared with those of OP-1101 and OP-728. Another noticeable point is the saturation of photocurrent: the saturation of the OP-1344 system starts at −0.2 V, a much more negative value compared to 0 V of the two other systems; and the yielded saturated photocurrent densities by OP-1344 are more outstanding than OP-728. Additionally, the contrast experiments by QDs/TiO2 electrodes result in a limited photocurrent only at an electrochemical potential more positive than 0.2 V. Reproducibility of such characteristics was obtained by controlling the loading amount of each size of the QDs (the mole number densities of PbS near 1.0 nmol cm−2 and less than 0.25 nmol cm−2), showing a similar tendency that OP-1344 creates with more negative onset potentials (Fig. S8, ESI†). These phenomena demonstrate that appropriately sized QDs coupled with LSPR does achieve effective charge separation at a more negative potential than those with different sizes.
Examination of wavelength-dependent characteristics of the photocurrent generation in the present systems (mole number densities of PbS near 0.5 nmol cm−2) provides further proof of enhancement by MEG via LSPR excitation. The ϕonset, maximum of photocurrent density (jmax) and the yielded output power density (Wout) of each size QDs are summarized in Fig. 3 as a function of wavelength. The Wout was estimated as the area integral of the photocurrent density in the potential range from −0.8 V to ϕVB of distinct sizes of the QDs (Fig. S9, ESI†). The MEG region is highlighted in green as shown in Fig. 3 with calculated MEG threshold wavelengths of 517 ± 24 nm (2.40 eV) for OP-1344, 423 ± 21 nm (2.93 eV) for OP-1101, and 280 ± 23 nm (4.43 eV) for OP-728, respectively, considering a threshold of 2.6Eg for PbS QDs42,43 and deviations due to the size distribution of the QDs (Table S4, ESI†). Compared with the middle-sized QDs (OP-1101, Fig. 3b, e and h), the largest QDs (OP-1344, Fig. 3a, d and g) with the smallest bandgap benefit from a lower MEG threshold within the visible light region; in contrast, for the smallest QDs (OP-728, Fig. 3c, f and i), the threshold is in the ultraviolet region. The occurrence of MEG in these wavelength ranges is revealed by internal quantum efficiency spectra (Fig. S10, ESI†).

(a–c) The onset potential (ϕonset), (d–f) the yielded output power density (Wout, histogram, left axis) and the maximum of photocurrent density (jmax, grey dashed line, right axis) of the OP-1344, OP-1101 and OP-728 sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2 electrodes as a function of wavelength measured in the potential range from −0.8 V to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the electrolyte of 0.05 M Na2S and 0.1 M NaOH. ϕonset is defined as the electrochemical potential at 10% of the photocurrent density measured at 0.5 V. Details of the error evaluation for onset potential can be found in Fig. S7, ESI.†Wout is estimated as the area integral of the photocurrent density in the potential range from −0.8 V to the valence band edge of distinct sizes of the QDs (Fig. S9, ESI†). jmax is the maximum photocurrent density at 0.5 V. Error bars of Wout and jmax are evaluated from the measured photocurrent noise width. The LSPR region (highlighted in yellow) from 1.8 to 2.5 eV; the size-dependent MEG region of QDs (highlighted in green) with a threshold of 2.6Eg and deviations due to QDs’ size distribution (Table S4, ESI†). For OP-1344, MEG overlaps with the LSPR energy region (a, d and g), whilst for OP-1101, a gap exists between MEG and LSPR (b, e and h). (g–i) IPCE spectra of size-controlled PbS QD-sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2 (solid) and TiO2 (hollow) electrodes recorded at −0.1 V. PbS particle densities within a single layer domain are 2.7 × 1011 for OP-1344 (d, g, and solid diamonds, solid line in a), 5.9 × 1011 for OP-1101 (e, h, and solid circles, solid line in b) and 2.6 × 1012 cm−2 for OP-728 (f, i, and solid squares, solid line in c), respectively. The mole number densities of PbS are all near 0.5 nmol cm−2 in these figures. Loading amount inducing onset potential change was also examined, with mole number densities of PbS near 1.0 nmol cm−2 (hollow points, dashed lines, a–c) and less than 0.25 nmol cm−2 (hollow points, dotted lines, a–c). 
The Wout and the maximum of jmax present similar wavelength dependence for all three QDs coupled with LSPR, while noticeable different tendencies on ϕonset are observed for the OP-1344 system. The most negative ϕonset value is obtained by the OP-1344 system across all the wavelengths performed (solid diamonds, solid line in Fig. 3a), and an apparent negative shift on ϕonset is observed as the wavelength changes from 650 to 450 nm. First of all, the more negative ϕonset values, around −0.5 V (4.14 eV vs. vacuum), of OP-1344 at 650, 600 and 550 nm along with the relatively large jmax (Fig. 2a and 3d) altogether result in great enhancement on Wout than on the other two systems, owing to the LSPR energy region that well couples with twice Eg of OP-1344 in these wavelengths (Ephoton/Eg > 2, top scale in Fig. 3a). In contrast, extremely limited overlapping between LSPR and twice Eg of OP-1101 and no overlapping of OP-728 in the wavelength range from 650 to 550 nm (Ephoton/Eg < 2 for both) results in a lower photovoltaic performance than that of OP-1344. All the IPCE spectra obtained by three QD systems showing a broad range of features in the range from 700 to 500 nm prove that the observed photocurrent is generated upon LSPR excitation. Moreover, excitation by 500 nm generates very high photocurrent density and Wout with ϕonset = −0.56 V (4.08 eV vs. vacuum), rather noteworthy than the other two sizes of QDs. Since the MEG effect of OP-1344 takes place at 500 nm whilst LSPR is still effective at this wavelength, their combination rationally produces an enhanced photovoltaic performance compared to the other systems, where only the LSPR effect modifies their bandgap excitation. Furthermore, a higher photon energy at a wavelength of 450 nm further negatively shifts the onset potential to −0.58 V (4.06 eV vs. vacuum) and the results improved Wout for OP-1344 owing to MEG and probable interband excitation of Au NPs, suggesting the possible formation of excitations by the well-coupled system. Supplementary examination was performed to certify the general tendency of ϕonset by varying the loaded mole number densities of PbS from 0.25 and 0.50 to 1.0 nmol cm−2 (Fig. 3a–c). The higher values of ϕonset were confirmed at OP-1344 than those at OP-1101 and OP-728 (Fig. S8j–l, ESI†). Larger differences between the values of ϕonset with distinct QDs are apparent at 0.25 and 0.50 nmol cm−2 than those at 1.0 nmol cm−2. The results suggest that an optimized loading amount results in a relatively strong interaction between QDs and the LSPR electromagnetic field which is able to shift ϕonset, whilst excess loading may lead to less contribution of photocurrent enhanced by MEG via LSPR excitation. In addition, the enhancement factor on the output power density is calculated as the ratio of the substrates with Au NPs to that of the substrate without Au NPs in the LSPR wavelength range from 500 to 650 nm (eqn (4) in the Methods section). Taken together, in the present study, the observed negative shift of the photocurrent onset reflects an increase in ϕ of the photovoltaic system of the OP-1344 sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2 substrate compared with OP-728 and OP-1101. And these observations indicate a significant improvement in the output power when the MEG and LSPR are optimally combined.
The characteristics of IPCE spectra (Fig. 3g–i) measured at −0.1 V with a wavelength interval of 10 nm provide further evidence for the comparison. The most significant response covering the whole wavelength range is achieved by the OP-1344 sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2 substrate (Fig. 3g), especially in the short wavelength range that MEG works as well as the MEG-LSPR overlapping region. The wavelength-dependent tendency of the IPCE spectra is consistent with the Wout and jmax results. The enhancement factor (EF) on IPCE is calculated viaeqn (3), and the EF spectrum shows a large EF in the LSPR region and size-dependent enhancement (Fig. S11–S13, ESI†). Unique enhancement behaviour is seen in the wavelength region where LSPR overlaps with MEG for OP-1344 (Fig. 3g); for example, the calculated EF at 520 nm is 12.2 for OP-1344, while the EF is only 6.7 and 6.9 for OP-728 and OP-1101, respectively. This wavelength-dependent enhancement is affected by the loading amount of the QDs. This demonstrated that controlled loading with relatively low QDs (the mole number densities of PbS all near 0.5 nmol cm−2) corresponds to the formation of a close-packed single layer of QDs to cover the substrate (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†). Excess loading of QDs leads to the decrease in the EF especially at the wavelength region where LSPR overlaps with MEG. This result also proves the important role of the coupling between MEG-effective PbS QDs and Au NPs.
The size-dependent enhancement of the photovoltaic performance improved by LSPR is estimated from the total output power density (Wtotal) obtained from the sum of Wout in the wavelength region from 500 to 650 nm (Fig. 4). The largest EF of 25 is obtained with OP-1344, whilst the other systems do not show so much improvement. The remarkable results of the largest size and the narrowest bandgap of the QDs (OP-1344) coupled with LSPR are considered to arise from three aspects including the MEG effect, plasmon excitation (energy coupling between twice Eg and LSPR), and electromagnetic field enhancement. One essential aspect is that based on MEG by the largest size QDs, and plasmons with energies larger than 2.5Eg induce a high density of excitation in PbS QDs (wide green arrow in Fig. 4b) including multiple excitons (black arrow), which soon become electrons because of the low binding energy in PbS.44 In contrast, plasmon excitation in the middle-sized QDs (OP-1101, Fig. 4c) and the smallest sized QDs (OP-728, Fig. 4d) is relatively limited, especially in OP-728 that the strong quantum confinement effect dominates rather than bandgap coupling with LSPR. Another reason is that the largest PbS QDs enhance the LSPR electromagnetic field to the largest degree, which was confirmed by FDTD simulation results (Fig. S14, ESI†), because the largest size induces the highest scattering efficiency.31 Such an enhanced localized electromagnetic field promotes electron generation and accelerates electron injection,45 consequently resulting in increased photocurrent density, even in conditions of probable unsatisfied electron transfer between QDs and TiO2 due to the long chain capping ligands of oleic acid. The increased photocurrent density results in a negative shift of the onset potential, because a relatively negative electrochemical potential is enough to inhibit the recombination of excited electron–hole pairs in the largest QDs. Thus, the highly intense electron generation and the accelerated electron injection by the effective coupling of appropriately sized PbS QDs with LSPR lead to the significant increase in Wtotal for OP-1344.
 Fig. 4  Size-dependent enhancement on output power and mechanisms. (a) Comparison of the total output power density (Wtotal) of TiO2/Au/TiO2 and TiO2 electrodes sensitized by different sized PbS QDs. Wtotal is the sum of Wout in the LSPR region from 500 to 650 nm. The enhancement factor (EF) is the Wtotal ratio of the PbS/TiO2/Au/TiO2 electrode to the PbS/TiO2 electrode (eqn (4)). Error bars of Wtotal are evaluated from the measured photocurrent noise width. Schematic illustration of the mechanism for (b) OP-1344, (c) OP-1101 and (d) OP-728-sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2 under LSPR excitation. τET and τHT refer to the electron transfer time into TiO2 (ref. 47), and hole transfer into the donor of S2− (ref. 38), respectively. τcool refers to the intraband relaxation lifetime (ref. 48 and 16), τPL refers to the photoluminescence lifetime (ref. 36), and τxx refers to the Auger recombination lifetime (ref. 26). 
Dynamic aspects are also important to understand the present observations. Efficient electron transfer processes compete with both the electronic relaxation between two excited states (e.g. 1Pe–1Se) in PbS QDs, and the biexciton lifetimes of Auger recombination, to outpace the cooling process. The electron transfer lifetime from excited PbS QDs into TiO2 NPs has been estimated to be ∼7 fs,46 much faster than 1.75 ps47 for intraband relaxation, and 65 ps25 for Auger recombination of PbS QDs of a similar size to that of OP-1344, indicating that multiple excitons can contribute to photocurrent generation because of the faster timescale than exciton annihilation. OP-1344 benefits from its slow cooling processes compared with OP-1101 and OP-728 (intraband relaxation time of ∼0.6 and ∼0.4 ps,15 and biexciton Auger lifetime of 39 and 22 ps,25 respectively), because the relatively weak quantum confinement induced by the large size results in dense energy spacing between discrete electronic states where the Coulombic interaction is comparatively weak and intraband cooling rates become slower.18,47 LSPR contributes to the effective MEG process via the enhanced excitation of hot electrons and holes with energies larger than the bandgap.48 MEG is also affected by the plasmon characteristics of longer lifetimes, excited state coherence, and selection rule modification of electronic excitations near materials. Presently, the relative contributions of these LSPR excitation characteristics to MEG are not clear. Further research on the electron transfer dynamics of QDs in LSPR fields should be investigated to clarify the mechanism of the observed characteristics that the electron injection achieves relatively high photocurrent density to give high output voltages.
The present system generates electrons with a relatively high electrochemical potential. This is the advantage not only for high-performance photovoltaics, but also for effective light-induced chemical energy storage. A higher electrochemical potential of more than 0.15–0.18 V, which corresponds to ca. 2000 K heat in energy, can significantly accelerate chemical reactions, especially for important reduction reactions such as hydrogen evolution,49 fuel production from carbon dioxide,50 ammonia fixation,51etc. Photovoltaics generating photocurrent with high output voltages will provide opportunities for solar energy use in diverse ways.
Conclusions
PbS QDs with narrow bandgaps coupled with LSPR produce enhanced photocurrents showing improved electromotive forces, especially under irradiation of light for MEG and LSPR excitation. The PbS QD system with a relatively small bandgap energy (Eg = 0.9 eV) shows a higher output power density than those with larger bandgap energies (Eg = 1.1 and 1.7 eV) under comparable conditions for LSPR excitation by visible light (500 nm (2.5 eV)–650 nm (1.9 eV)). The wavelength dependence on the onset potential suggests that PbS QDs well-coupled with LSPR result in a high-density photocurrent via MEG which is enhanced by the highly localized electromagnetic field. MEG upon LSPR excitation promotes the formation of high-density electrons at higher electrochemical potentials, resulting in accelerated electron injection competing against the recombination of excited electrons and holes. The onset potential will be further enhanced by optimizing the coupling between PbS QDs and LSPR, which contributes to improving photovoltaic efficiency by using light at energies higher than the semiconductor's bandgap. That is to say, to appropriately design the optical and electrical properties of nanostructured semiconductors or metals by simply tuning the size, shape or compositions, a well energy range overlapping between MEG and LSPR is achievable, which is an encouraging and promising way for solar energy conversion and further utilization.
Experimental methods
Preparation of lead sulfide quantum dots
An adapted hot injection method based on the method of Hines and Scholes was used34 to synthesize size-controlled PbS QDs. Briefly, PbO (0.4475 g, 2 mmol) was added to 1.25 mL of oleic acid and 48.5 mL of octadecene. The reaction mixture was evacuated for 10 min whilst stirred and refilled with nitrogen three times under Schlenk conditions. Then the temperature was adjusted to the desired injection/growth temperature of 100, 150 or 200 °C kept for 1 h under nitrogen to ensure the complete reaction of PbO and oleic acid. Separately bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide (100 μL, 0.4 mmol) was dissolved in 15 mL of degassed 1-octadecene at room temperature. The bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide solution was swiftly injected into the reaction flask, resulting in a nucleation burst as evidenced by the solution turning dark brown in color. The QDs were allowed to grow for 80 or 30 s depending on the size required. The growth was quenched by rapidly cooling the mixture to room temperature. Anhydrous acetone was added to cause aggregation of the PbS QDs followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10000 rpm to separate the aggregated QDs from the reaction mixture. The supernatant was removed, and the acquired QDs were redispersed in hexane (1–2 mL) and further re-precipitated three times in anhydrous acetone. Table S1 in the ESI† shows the growth temperatures and times used to synthesise the different-sized QDs. Full details of the reagents used are provided in the ESI.†
Construction of electrodes
The construction of TiO2/Au/TiO2 was prepared by following a reported method with an area of 2 × 2 cm2.26 In brief, the titanium dioxide film was prepared by liquid phase deposition (LPD) for 12 hours and then annealed at 500 °C to form a uniform crystalline layer with a thickness of 100 nm. A gold film was deposited by electron beam vaporization and then annealed at 500 °C to promote the modification of continuous films toward the formation of gold isolated nanoparticles. LPD was once again used to form another extra-thin titanium dioxide film covering the surface of gold nanoparticles for the purpose to inhibit energy quenching between PbS QDs and Au NPs.
Morphology and elemental mapping
The morphology and elemental mapping of the electrodes were measured by using a scanning electron microscope (Philips XL30 FEG SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analytical system (Rontec, now Bruker). SEM images were captured by using a 10.0 kV electron beam with a magnification of 250000 times and EDS mapping and spectra were accumulated for 10 min by a 20.0 kV electron beam with a magnification of 62500 times.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured using a three-electrode system in an electrolyte of 0.05 M Na2S and 0.1 M NaOH. Illumination from a xenon lamp (USHIO Spax Inc.) was cut off for visible light by using a UV-cut filter (wavelength lower than 380 nm is cut off, SCF-50S-38L, SIGMA KOKI Co., Ltd), and then passed through a grating monochromator (M10, Bunkoukeiki). A plano-convex lens (SLSQ 50-100P, SIGMA KOKI Co., Ltd) was placed at the exit light of the monochromator to focus the light, yielding a square with a width of 2 cm at the position the electrode was located. Steady-state on–off photocurrent responses were monitored by a shutter controller (SC10, THOR LABS) and were recorded with a potentiostat (HSV-110, Hokuto Denko) connected between a counter electrode of the Pt coil and a working electrode. A homemade Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl aq.) was used as the reference electrode and was calibrated with a commercial one within an error of ±3 mV before each measurement. The active area on the electrode is determined by the electrochemical cell in which the electrode contacts with the electrolyte in an area of 0.385 cm2 with a diameter of 0.35 cm, and other area of the electrode is masked by a silicon rubber and an opaque metal sheet in an area of 3.815 cm2 (a width of 2.3 cm) from the back to prevent excitation. The edge of the cell was not masked because the metal sheet is large enough to eliminate the formation of “light piping”.52 The cell was located at the center of the light beam and fixed between measurements via a sample holder in a metal box which is able to prevent room light irradiation. A power meter (VEGA RoHS, OPHIR PHOTONICS) was used to measure the incident power through the monochromator for the photocurrent measurement. The diode of the power meter was located exactly at the same distance in the same spot, and the area under illumination is 0.709 cm2 with a diameter of 0.475 cm. All the photo-electrochemical measurements were performed in the dark with a constant temperature of 23 °C at Physical Chemistry Laboratory in Hokkaido University, Japan. More than six electrodes with the same QD loading for different sizes of QDs have been tested and yielded the same tendency. We chose the best performance with the highest photocurrent yielding based on the well selection of potentials and radiation wavelengths.
Calculation for IPCE and EF
The incident photon-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the PbS QD-sensitized substrates as a working electrode is calculated by the following formula, where I and φ are respectively the photocurrent density and the power intensity density at a wavelength of λ. (2)
The enhancement factor (EF) was introduced. In the present experiment, as the loading amounts of PbS QDs both on the substrates with and without Au were carefully controlled to be the same, the EF was calculated as the ratio of the yielded IPCE of the PbS QDs/TiO2/Au/TiO2 substrate (with Au NPs) to the PbS QDs/TiO2 substrate (without Au NPs) at a certain wavelength, as described below. (3)
The enhancement factor on the output power density was also evaluated as the ratio of the substrates with Au NPs to the substrate without Au NPs in the LSPR region (500–650 nm) over the potential range from −0.8 V to the valence band potential (ϕVB) of each size (Fig. S9, ESI†). (4)

 	Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the energy diagram of MEG in PbS QDs excited by LSPR and size-dependent PbS QDs. (a) PbS QDs/TiO2/Au/TiO2 by the electromagnetic field of LSPR (520 nm, 2.38 eV, green curved arrow). Excitation by visible light or LSPR (green arrow labelled I) generated hot electrons (filled red circles) and holes (empty red circles) at higher energy levels (grey lines) than the conduction band (labelled CB) or the valence band (labelled VB). Cooled electrons (filled pink circles) or holes (hollow pink circles) relaxed to the CB or VB via intraband relaxation (black curved arrows labelled II) and a fraction undergo MEG with irradiation energy larger than 2.6 times of bandgap energy (black arrow labelled III) to create a 2nd electron–hole pair (filled or hollow pink circles). Hot electron injection into TiO2 from a higher energy level without intraband relaxation (red arrow labelled IV), cooled electron injection from conduction band or bi-electron injection via MEG from the conduction band (pink thick arrow labelled V) and electron–hole pair recombination (grey thick arrow labelled VI). The existence of Au NPs generates the electromagnetic field under excitation at 520 nm and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by PbS QDs (ref. 27 and 30) (brown shadow). The enhanced electromagnetic field manipulates QDs’ absorption (thick green arrow) and facilitates electron injection. (b) Normalized absorption spectrum of size-controlled colloidal PbS QDs with the 1st exciton peak at 1344 nm (red), 1101 nm (orange), and 728 nm (blue), respectively. The average diameters were estimated from the 1st exciton wavelengths. The LSPR region (highlighted in yellow) from 1.77 to 2.58 eV. (c) Schematic energy diagram of PbS QDs calculated with regard to the average size. The flat band potential of anatase TiO2 in a neutral aqueous solution.	 

 	Fig. 2  Stacked area chats of size-dependent photocurrent generation. (a) OP-1344, (b) OP-1101 and (c) OP-728 sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2 (upper) and TiO2 (down) substrates upon irradiation at 450 (blue), 500 (cyan), 550 (green), 600 (orange), and 650 (red) nm, in the potential range from −0.8 V to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the electrolyte of 0.05 M Na2S and 0.1 M NaOH. PbS particle densities within a single layer domain are 2.7 × 1011, 5.9 × 1011 and 2.6 × 1012 cm−2, respectively. The mole number densities of PbS are all near 0.5 nmol cm−2. Vertical dashed lines present the onset potential (ϕonset) corresponding to the electrochemical potential at 10% of the photocurrent density measured at 0.5 V and irradiated at 450 nm.	 
ϕ = ϕVB − ϕonset	(1)

 	Fig. 3  Comparisons of size-dependent photovoltaic performance. (a–c) The onset potential (ϕonset), (d–f) the yielded output power density (Wout, histogram, left axis) and the maximum of photocurrent density (jmax, grey dashed line, right axis) of the OP-1344, OP-1101 and OP-728 sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2 electrodes as a function of wavelength measured in the potential range from −0.8 V to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the electrolyte of 0.05 M Na2S and 0.1 M NaOH. ϕonset is defined as the electrochemical potential at 10% of the photocurrent density measured at 0.5 V. Details of the error evaluation for onset potential can be found in Fig. S7, ESI.†Wout is estimated as the area integral of the photocurrent density in the potential range from −0.8 V to the valence band edge of distinct sizes of the QDs (Fig. S9, ESI†). jmax is the maximum photocurrent density at 0.5 V. Error bars of Wout and jmax are evaluated from the measured photocurrent noise width. The LSPR region (highlighted in yellow) from 1.8 to 2.5 eV; the size-dependent MEG region of QDs (highlighted in green) with a threshold of 2.6Eg and deviations due to QDs’ size distribution (Table S4, ESI†). For OP-1344, MEG overlaps with the LSPR energy region (a, d and g), whilst for OP-1101, a gap exists between MEG and LSPR (b, e and h). (g–i) IPCE spectra of size-controlled PbS QD-sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2 (solid) and TiO2 (hollow) electrodes recorded at −0.1 V. PbS particle densities within a single layer domain are 2.7 × 1011 for OP-1344 (d, g, and solid diamonds, solid line in a), 5.9 × 1011 for OP-1101 (e, h, and solid circles, solid line in b) and 2.6 × 1012 cm−2 for OP-728 (f, i, and solid squares, solid line in c), respectively. The mole number densities of PbS are all near 0.5 nmol cm−2 in these figures. Loading amount inducing onset potential change was also examined, with mole number densities of PbS near 1.0 nmol cm−2 (hollow points, dashed lines, a–c) and less than 0.25 nmol cm−2 (hollow points, dotted lines, a–c).	 

 	Fig. 4  Size-dependent enhancement on output power and mechanisms. (a) Comparison of the total output power density (Wtotal) of TiO2/Au/TiO2 and TiO2 electrodes sensitized by different sized PbS QDs. Wtotal is the sum of Wout in the LSPR region from 500 to 650 nm. The enhancement factor (EF) is the Wtotal ratio of the PbS/TiO2/Au/TiO2 electrode to the PbS/TiO2 electrode (eqn (4)). Error bars of Wtotal are evaluated from the measured photocurrent noise width. Schematic illustration of the mechanism for (b) OP-1344, (c) OP-1101 and (d) OP-728-sensitized TiO2/Au/TiO2 under LSPR excitation. τET and τHT refer to the electron transfer time into TiO2 (ref. 47), and hole transfer into the donor of S2− (ref. 38), respectively. τcool refers to the intraband relaxation lifetime (ref. 48 and 16), τPL refers to the photoluminescence lifetime (ref. 36), and τxx refers to the Auger recombination lifetime (ref. 26).
