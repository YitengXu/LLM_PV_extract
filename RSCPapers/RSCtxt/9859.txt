Introduction
With the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization, the alarming contrast between the ever-growing energy demand and limited natural resources has become an ongoing and huge scientific challenge facing us now. Given this challenge, exploring clean and sustainable energy to replace exhausted fossil fuels and developing highly efficient energy storage systems are extremely necessary. In this regard, electrochemical water splitting1 has been recognized as a quite appealing and intriguing path to convert renewable energy (wind and solar power) into eco-friendly and high-purity hydrogen energy with zero emission of greenhouse gas. Simply, water splitting involves two independent chemical reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 2H+ + 2e− → H2) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 2H2O → O2↑ + 4H+ + 4e−). The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is not only a critical half-cell reaction of water splitting, but also a vital technological component in many energy conversion systems, such as metal–air batteries,2 CO2 reduction,3 regenerative fuel cells,4 nitrogen reduction5 and so on, thereby attracting substantial attention over the past two decades. However, the OER involves multiple proton coupled electron transfer steps6,7 during the whole water oxidation process, implying that it is much more complex, and exhibits sluggish electrode kinetics when compared with the HER. Accordingly, the OER is beyond all doubt the major bottleneck to achieving highly efficient water-splitting. Currently, precious RuO2 and IrO2 as well as their matrix compounds are considered state-of-the-art OER catalysts8,9 owing to their relatively small overpotentials, but the high cost, extreme scarcity and poor electrochemical stability of these materials seriously impede their large-scale application. Therefore, it is of great importance to search for and develop alternative OER electrocatalysts based on non-noble substrates with high-activity, low-cost, and long-term durability for practical applications.
To overcome these limitations, much attention has been devoted to transition metal phosphides,10,11 sulfides,12–14 nitrides,15,16 and oxides17,18 and two-dimensional layered double hydroxide (LDH) materials.19–22 Among them, LDH systems, especially those containing earth abundant transition metals (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu), are the most promising OER catalysts and have attracted tremendous interest in the water splitting field owing to their outstanding OER performance. Previous studies have proved that heteroatom doping is an extremely effective strategy to further enhance the OER performance of LDH substrates by tuning the electronic environments around reactive sites. For example, Boettcher's group demonstrated that the overall electronic conductivity of Ni1−xFexOOH films could certainly be improved by incorporating Fe into the NiOOH lattice, and this permanently enhanced the OER electrocatalytic activity of the electrocatalyst films.23,24 Moreover, Jin et al. reported that introducing Mo and Fe modifications can synergistically boost the catalytic activity and structural stability of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH nanosheets toward the OER.25 It should be noted that, regarding Fe-doped NiOOH catalysts, the active sites for the OER are still controversial now. Some studies proposed that Fe sites are the active sites,26–28 whereas others argued that Ni sites are the active sites.29,30 More importantly, Xiao and co-workers discovered that the OER performance of Fe-doped NiOOH [(Ni,Fe)OOH] can be further improved by separately screening the optimal component for O radicals at the high spin d4 Fe(IV) sites and O–O coupling at the closed shell d6 Ni(IV) sites.31 Most recently, Baker et al. synthesized Ni–Al–Fe–OOH films and confirmed that Al exerts a promoting effect on the OER activities of NiOOH and Ni–Fe–OOH catalysts.32 Even so, developing new promising LDH candidates with much higher catalytic efficiency and lower reaction overpotentials is desired. However, precisely identifying active sites and controlling the elemental composition of the target LDH electrocatalysts using experimental measurements are extremely difficult and time consuming. Fortunately, density functional theory (DFT) simulations, a powerful calculation tool, can achieve systematic screening of the catalytic activity among various OER catalysts at the atomic level by analyzing the adsorption strengths of oxygen intermediates (OH*, O*, and OOH*) and theoretical overpotentials.
Keeping in mind the above considerations, tailoring the matrix component and evaluating OER activity of the target catalysts are of great significance from the theoretical prediction viewpoint. Herein, considering that nickel oxyhydroxide-based catalysts exhibit outstanding OER activity in alkaline electrolytes,33–35 a series of NiMOOH (M = Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, W) LDH electrocatalyst models are constructed, and their OER performance is systematically screened via DFT calculation. In the present work, our main research aims are to identify true catalytically active sites, predict theoretical overpotentials, determine the potential determining step (pds), establish the catalytic activity trend and propose further optimization strategies. Our results indicate that the OER catalytic activity of the NiOOH matrix was significantly enhanced by embedding transition-metal (TM) heteroatoms. Most prominently, the theoretical overpotential for the NiOOH substrate was significantly reduced by nearly 68% from 0.65 to 0.21 V after introducing the Fe dopant. In addition, our theoretical predictions also demonstrate that the Ni@NiCu-2, Ni@NiMn-3 and O@NiW-b catalyst models exhibit relatively low overpotentials of 0.22, 0.24, and 0.27 V, respectively, and therefore are very promising OER candidates for achieving efficient water-splitting. These findings not only pave a new way for selecting highly active OER electrocatalysts based on the NiOOH matrix, but can also be extended as theoretical guidelines to develop other earth-abundant and cost-effective TM-based hydroxide materials with superior OER performance.
Computational details
All DFT calculations in the present work were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) 5.3.5 code36–38 with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.39 The ion–electron interaction was described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method40,41 with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV. A 4 × 4 supercell of the NiOOH (001) layer was employed to model the catalyst substrates. A Γ-centred Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh42 with a size of 3 × 3 × 1 was applied for all supercells. A vacuum layer of 20 Å was set along the vertical direction for all slab models to avoid interactions between periodical images. Considering the magnetic nature of NiOOH, the spin polarization approach was employed in the present work. In addition, the DFT-D3 correction method in Grimme's scheme43,44 was also used to accurately describe the long-range vdW interactions. For structural optimization, atomic positions were allowed to relax in all three directions, while the shape and volume of the supercell were kept constant until the total energy and force were less than 10−5 eV per atom and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively.
The widely accepted method to model the OER process is a four-electron reaction pathway in an acidic environment H2O + * → OH* + H+ + e−(1) OH* → O* + H+ + e−(2) H2O + O* → OOH* + H+ + e−(3) OOH* → * + O2 + H+ + e−(4)where * represents an active site on the bare catalyst surface and OH*, O*, and OOH* denote different adsorbed intermediates. For each individual step, the Gibbs free energy ΔGi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) can be calculated using the expression ΔGi = ΔE + ΔZPE − TΔS − eϕ + kBTln(H+)(5)where ΔE is the total energy difference between the reactant and product molecules in the reactions (eqn (1)–(4)). The detailed expressions of ΔE for different adsorbed intermediates are presented in the ESI (cf. eqn (S1)–(S3)†). ΔZPE and TΔS are the changes in the zero-point energy and the entropic contribution, respectively. Here, e is the charge transferred and ϕ is the external potential. The last term, kBTln(H+), can be regard as the corrected Gibbs free energy of H ions. All reaction free energies ΔGi were obtained under standard conditions (ϕ = 0, T = 298.15 K, pH = 0) using DFT calculations. Thus, based on the above free energy results, the thermodynamic overpotential ηOER for a given electrocatalyst can be determined using GOER = max{ΔG1,ΔG2,ΔG3,ΔG4}(6) ηOER = GOER/e − 1.23 V(7)where ΔG1, ΔG2, ΔG3 and ΔG4 are the Gibbs free energy for the elementary OER steps: formation of OH* by dissociative adsorption of H2O molecules, formation of O* by deprotonation of OH*, O* oxidation to OOH*, and O2 formation and release. The overpotential ηOER, one of the most important electrocatalytic parameters, is closely related to the OER catalytic activity of a catalyst. In this regard, if a catalyst exhibits a lower value of ηOER, it would possess better OER performance. From eqn (6) and (7), we can conclude that to obtain the minimum overpotential, requiring the reaction free energy for each step has the same magnitude being approximately equal to 1.23 eV to ensure the binding strength neither too strong nor too weak. That is, all adsorption intermediates of OH*, O* and OOH* need to be carefully controlled to balance the breaking of O–H bonds and the formation of O–O bonds.
Results and discussion
Indeed, nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) has already shown excellent OER catalytic activity in many previous studies. But the overpotential for pristine NiOOH is still high, meaning that decreasing the overpotential is urgently desired now. As mentioned above, electrocatalysts with mixed second TM heteroatoms commonly exhibit better OER performance than single-metal oxyhydroxide systems. Hence, in the present work, a series of Ni-based LDH electrocatalyst models are constructed, and their OER performance is systematically screened via DFT calculations, aiming to further optimize the OER catalytic activity of the NiOOH substrate. To begin with, the optimized lattice parameters for the pristine NiOOH bulk crystal were obtained with a = b = 2.95 Å, c = 4.55 Å, α = β = 90° and γ = 120°. Based on this optimized structure, an oxygen-terminated (001) surface with the size of 4 × 4 supercells was constructed as the initial simulation model for the clean NiOOH slab. Note that having the best stability of the oxygen-terminated (001) surface is the main reason why these slabs were adopted. For the pristine NiOOH model, the Ni and oxygen reaction sites are simply denoted by Ni@Slab and O@Slab, respectively. Moreover, TM-doped LDH systems were simulated by replacing a single Ni atom on the top layer of NiOOH, and the top and side views of the doped models are shown in Fig. 1. Combining the relative distance and symmetry equivalence principles, four possible metal-active sites have been captured on the doped 4 × 4 (001) surface of NiOOH, as depicted in Fig. 1a, namely M@NiM-0, Ni@NiM-1, Ni@NiM-2 and Ni@NiM-3 (M = Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, W). Similarly, regarding oxygen-active sites, there still appear to be four different configurations, denoted here as O@NiM-o, O@NiM-a, O@NiM-b and O@NiM-c, as presented in Fig. 1b.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the structure models for different reaction sites from both top and side views. (a) Ni or TM active sites and (b) O active sites. The atomic radius distinguishes four different atomic compositions: the largest represents Ni or doped TM atoms, the middle indicates O atoms, and the smallest refers to H atoms. 
In order to display the OER activities in a straightforward way, a volcano plot was constructed based on −ηOER and the descriptor of ΔGOOH* − ΔGO*, as displayed in Fig. 2. Meanwhile, the theoretical overpotentials as well as the detailed free energies ΔGi for all considered reaction sites are collected in Tables S2 and S3.† First, we focused our analyses on the pristine NiOOH substrate. In the case of Ni@Slab, we note that the peak of Ni@Slab shows quite a large deviation from the peak of the volcano owing to the overly strong OOH* binding compared to O* binding. As a result, the formation of O2 from OOH* is the potential determining step (pds) with an extremely poor OER activity of ηOER ∼ 1.40 V. Such a large overpotential indicates that the Ni sites would be passivated by OOH* intermediates during the reaction process. Additionally, in the case of O@Slab, we discovered that the difference of ΔGOOH* − ΔGO* substantially decreased to 1.88 eV, implying that the adsorption strength of O* and OOH* species at O sites can be well-balanced, which leads to a relatively better ηOER of 0.65 V. Therefore, we could claim that the exposed O sites on the NiOOH substrate are more catalytically active than the Ni sites and play a vital role in the OER process. Further, in Fig. 2, we observe that the lowest overpotential (about 0.21 V) is achieved at the top of the volcano plot with an optimum binding of ΔGOOH* − ΔGO* of approximately 1.44 eV. Most significantly, the positive slope of the volcano, i.e. ΔGOOH* − ΔGO* < 1.44 eV, is composed mainly of Ni reaction sites, whereas the negative slope (ΔGOOH* − ΔGO* > 1.44 eV) predominantly contains O reaction sites. In comparison, the Ni@NiFe-2 specimen exhibits the highest OER catalytic activity with ηOER ∼ 0.21 V, which decreases by nearly 68% compared with that of O@Slab. Overall, the OER activities for the doped LDHs obeyed the order of Ni@NiCo-2 < O@NiMo-b < O@NiW-b < Ni@NiMn-3 < Ni@NiCu-2 < Ni@NiFe-2.

Subsequently, taking the optimal structure in each doped system as the representative samples, i.e., Ni@NiCo-2, Ni@NiCu-2, Ni@NiFe-2, Ni@NiMn-3, O@NiMo-b and O@NiW-b, detailed free energy diagrams are shown in Fig. 3. Meanwhile, the optimized structures for various intermediates are presented in Fig. S1–S6.† For the sake of comparison, the free energy diagram of an ideal catalyst is also given in Fig. 3 (pink steps). In the case of Ni@NiCo-2, the second step exhibits the largest energy barrier of ΔG2 = 1.66 eV under standard conditions (U = 0 V), implying that the formation of O* on the surface of Ni@NiCo-2 is the potential determining step (pds) for the OER process. Moreover, when an electrode potential of 1.23 V is applied, although only the fourth step (OOH* → O2) is exothermic, the overall energy barrier is still relatively high with a value of 0.43 eV. As for Ni@NiCu-2, the overly weak binding strength of the O* intermediate compels the conversion of OH* to O* to become the primary potential determining step, as indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 3. In particular, for the model of Ni@NiMn-3, a considerably high overpotential of 0.24 V is thermodynamically required to achieve an exothermic OER reaction. Regarding Fe doped NiOOH, according to our DFT results, compared to that at the Fe site, the theoretical OER catalytic performance at the Ni site is more active with an overpotential of 0.21 V for the sample Ni@NiFe-2. Furthermore, in the cases of O@NiMo-b and O@NiW-b, the O site exhibits stronger activity toward the OER than the TM (Ni, W, Mo) site. As expected, among all considered catalyst models, Ni@NiFe-2 possesses the lowest overpotential of ηOER = 0.21 V, which is even better than that of the current best RuO2 (0.42 V in ref. 45 and 0.37 V in ref. 46) based on the DFT results. That is, when the electrode potential is 1.44 V, the OER reaction on the Ni@NiFe-2 surface could occur spontaneously, as indicated by all steps being thermodynamically favorable with negative values of ΔGi. Overall, the OER process of the NiOOH substrate was significantly improved by introducing the second heteroatom dopant. In addition, to fully understand these catalytic properties, charge density difference and Bader charge analysis47,48 of O@Slab and Ni@NiFe-2 samples were carried out, as displayed in Fig. S7 and Table S4.† Our results suggest that embedding transition-metal (TM) heteroatoms can efficiently modify the electronic properties of the NiOOH phase, which is beneficial for electron transfer, thereby facilitating OER electrocatalysis activity.

The color filled rectangles distinguish different free energy differences; among these, the green rectangle is the longest corresponding to the potential determining step (pds) determining the reaction overpotential, and the yellow rectangle is the shortest implying that this step is the easiest to perform from a thermodynamic viewpoint. 
Furthermore, the OER activity of the O and Ni/TM reaction sites was visualized using Pourbaix diagrams (external potential URHEvs. pH), as displayed in Fig. 4. For comparison, the reversible hydrogen electrode H2 → H* and H2O → O2 equilibria are also presented separately and denoted by the black dashed lines. In Fig. 4a, we observe that O@NiW-b exhibits the best catalytic performance in the whole range of pH (0–14). Further, the sample O@NiMo-b also exhibits a better OER activity at a URHE > 1.50 V at pH = 0 and URHE > 0.67 V at pH = 14. Specifically, O@Slab exhibits a relatively poor OER performance requiring a URHE up to 1.88 V at pH = 0. Similarly, according to Fig. 4b, Ni@NiFe-2 shows an optimal OER activity among all considered doped systems at URHE > 1.44 V at pH = 0 and URHE > 0.61 V at pH = 14. Moreover, the trend of OER activity for these samples at Ni activity sites follows the order Ni@NiFe-2 > Ni@NiCu-2 > Ni@NiMn-3 > Ni@NiCo-2 > Ni@NiMo-3 > Ni@NiW-2 > Ni@Slab.

Fig. 5 illustrates the scaling relationship of ΔGOOH*vs. ΔGOH* for all considered reaction sites, and in addition the scaling relationship of ΔGO*vs. ΔGOH* is illustrated in Fig. S8.† To begin with, we list the optimal reaction sites for the pristine NiOOH and doped LDH models, i.e., O@Slab, Ni@NiCo-2, Ni@NiCu-2, Ni@NiFe-2, Ni@NiMn-3, O@NiMo-b and O@NiW-b, and find that their Gibbs free energy of adsorbed OH* and OOH* follows a strong linear relation, which can be expressed as ΔGOOH* = 0.96ΔGOH* + 2.82 eV with a reasonable coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.85), as denoted by the black dashed line in Fig. 5. Moreover, the two independent deviations of ±0.2 eV and ±0.5 eV from the fitted line are presented in Fig. 5, as marked by the yellow and gray shaded regions, respectively. Quantitatively speaking, approximately 60% of the reaction sites are located in the yellow shaded region, and ∼85% of the reaction sites are distributed in the gray shaded region, denoting that the scaling relationship of ΔGOOH* = 0.96ΔGOH* + 2.82 eV is reasonable and matches well with that of our catalyst models. In Fig. 5, a striking feature is that both Ni@Slab and O@Slab are clearly distributed on the fitted line, implying a better balance between the ΔGOH* and ΔGOOH*. Meanwhile, many LDH systems doped at O reaction sites, such as O@NiW-o, O@NiW-a, Ni@NiCo-1, O@NiMo-a, and Ni@NiFe-1, were widely distributed in the lower right region of the fitted line, implying that the adsorption of OH* for these catalysts is unambiguously the potential determining step during the OER process.
 Fig. 5  The scaling relationship between ΔGOH* and ΔGOOH* for different reaction sites. The black dashed line represents the line of fit for all considered reaction sites. The yellow and gray regions denote ±0.2 and ±0.5 eV deviations, respectively. 
Based on the scaling relation, ΔGOOH* = 0.96ΔGOH* + 2.82 eV, the detailed OER reaction Gibbs free energy of eqn (5) can be expressed as follows ΔG1 = ΔGOH*(8) ΔG2 = ΔGO* − ΔGOH*(9) ΔG3 = (0.96ΔGOH* + 2.82) − ΔG1 − ΔG2(10) ΔG4 = 4.92 − (0.96ΔGOH* + 2.82)(11)
Amazingly, in eqn (8)–(11), we note that only two independent descriptors were observed, namely, ΔGOH* and ΔGO* − ΔGOH*. That is, the overall OER performance for a given electrocatalyst can be clearly identified using these two descriptors. In the following, in order to find the optimal catalytic activity for the OER among various electrocatalyst models, the limiting overpotentials were visualized using a two-dimensional (2D) volcano plot based on the two independent descriptors (i.e. ΔGOH* and ΔGO* − ΔGOH*), as presented in Fig. 6. This approach has been successfully applied in many previous studies49–53 to determine the minimum possible overpotential for a given catalytic system. As can be seen, the contour map is clearly divided into four zones based on the difference of Gibbs free energy (brown dashed lines). Compared to the red-filled region, the blue area of the plot exhibits higher OER performances with ηOER < 0.72 V, and the optimal catalytic activities converged to the navy-blue line under the condition of ΔG1 = ΔG2 = ΔG3. Located on this line, the max{ΔG1,ΔG2,ΔG3,ΔG4} is only 1.38 eV, with the ηOER reaching its minimum value of 0.15 V. The present predicted potential determining steps in this contour map for the seven models are in good agreement with the Gibbs free energy results in Fig. 3. In particular, regarding the pristine NiOOH substrate, the OER catalytic activity of O@Slab is rather weak (ηOER ∼ 0.65 V), owing to the overly strong O* binding compared to OOH* binding, resulting in the formation of OOH* from O* being the potential determining step. Most prominently, heteroatom embedding dramatically boosted the OER catalytic activity of the NiOOH matrix, especially O@NiW-b, Ni@NiCu-2 and Ni@NiMn-3, which lie almost at the top of the volcano plot, and therefore possess extraordinary OER performance.

The scaling relation ΔGOOH* = 0.96ΔGOH* + 2.82 eV as shown in Fig. 5 was employed to construct this 2D contour map. 
Conclusions
In summary, a series of Ni-based LDH electrocatalyst models were constructed in the present work, and their OER performance was systematically screened via DFT calculations. According to our DFT predictions, the exposed O sites on the pristine NiOOH substrate are more catalytically active than the Ni sites, and they play a vital role in the OER process. Moreover, introducing a second transition-metal heteroatom-dopant is an effective strategy to boost the OER catalytic activity of the NiOOH matrix. Six promising candidates were rationally established with the OER activity trend following the order of Ni@NiCo-2 < O@NiMo-b < O@NiW-b < Ni@NiMn-3 < Ni@NiCu-2 < Ni@NiFe-2. Among them, Ni@NiFe-2 exhibits an extraordinary OER performance with the lowest overpotential of 0.21 V and can compete with or even outperform the current best catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2. Our results not only pave a new way for selecting highly active OER electrocatalysts based on an NiOOH matrix, but can also be extended as theoretical guidelines to develop other earth-abundant and cost-effective TM-based hydroxide materials with superior OER performance.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the structure models for different reaction sites from both top and side views. (a) Ni or TM active sites and (b) O active sites. The atomic radius distinguishes four different atomic compositions: the largest represents Ni or doped TM atoms, the middle indicates O atoms, and the smallest refers to H atoms.	 

 	Fig. 2  Calculated overpotential (−ηOER) vs. Gibbs free binding energy difference between OOH* and O* at various reaction sites.	 

 	Fig. 3  The predicted OER free energy diagrams in an acidic medium of the doped NiOOH systems at their optimal active sites. The color filled rectangles distinguish different free energy differences; among these, the green rectangle is the longest corresponding to the potential determining step (pds) determining the reaction overpotential, and the yellow rectangle is the shortest implying that this step is the easiest to perform from a thermodynamic viewpoint.	 

 	Fig. 4  Calculated overpotentials as a function of the solution pH for the clean/doped NiOOH slab at (a) optimal O active sites and (b) Ni/TM active sites. For comparison, the reversible hydrogen electrode H2 → H* and H2O → O2 equilibria are also presented separately and denoted by the black dashed lines.	 

 	Fig. 5  The scaling relationship between ΔGOH* and ΔGOOH* for different reaction sites. The black dashed line represents the line of fit for all considered reaction sites. The yellow and gray regions denote ±0.2 and ±0.5 eV deviations, respectively.	 
ΔG1 = ΔGOH*	(8)
ΔG2 = ΔGO* − ΔGOH*	(9)
ΔG3 = (0.96ΔGOH* + 2.82) − ΔG1 − ΔG2	(10)
ΔG4 = 4.92 − (0.96ΔGOH* + 2.82)	(11)

 	Fig. 6  The colored contour plot of OER activity volcanoes for the doped NiOOH systems by showing the theoretical overpotential (ηOER) as a function of the Gibbs free binding energies (i.e., ΔGO* − ΔGOH* along the x axis and ΔGOH* along the y axis). The scaling relation ΔGOOH* = 0.96ΔGOH* + 2.82 eV as shown in Fig. 5 was employed to construct this 2D contour map.
