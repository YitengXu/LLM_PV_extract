    , Accepted 23rd September 2021First published on 24th September 2021AbstractIn recent decades, there has been a significant quest for a viable medium for multiple applications. Many researchers have devoted all their utmost efforts to identifying such a medium. Finally in this context, conjugated polymers have proven to be a potential platform for a variety of applications due to their diverse nature. The conjugated polymer backbone is made of alternate electron donor and acceptor groups; the properties of such compounds can be tuned by altering the length of conjugation, adjacent group of monomers, energy levels, molecular interaction, etc. This alteration increases the light absorbance range that enables the molecule to be a photoluminescence active material for sensing toxic metal ions, organic molecules and gas detectors. Energy transfer, complexation, charge transfer and active chemical transformations are the common mechanisms of fluorescence based sensing application. Optimization of the HOMO and LUMO levels has been used as an efficient charge transfer ground between a conjugated polymer and analyte for photoluminescence and electrochemical sensing applications, and has subsequently been used in the construction of optoelectronic devices such as NIR sensors and flexible OLEDs. High compatibility conjugated polymers even made these giant molecules apt for mimicking biomolecules; some compounds were suitable for anti-bacterial application and even served as a drug delivery system. This review article intends to provide insights (2015–present) into versatile applications of conjugated polymers with the required diagrammatic explanation and a unique behavior of monomers including fluorene, carbazole, phenyl vinylene, triphenylamine, etc. Thus, we predict that this work will offer a comprehensive overview of an overall application of conjugated polymers and improve their applicability in multiple domains including portable sensors, flexible optoelectronic devices and future drug delivery processes.

1. Introduction
With the advent of industries1–3 in a massive structure it brought about the pollution of the environment by several organic molecules, non-biodegradable polymers and heavy metals. Of these intoxicants, heavy metals have serious and immediate impact in polluting an ecosystem and developing several health disorders. Anthropogenic factors4,5 primarily contribute to metal contamination in the environment, such as the consumption of petroleum products releasing vanadium, nickel, and mercury, the automobile exhausts, which release lead, the extractive metallurgical processes including smelting and roasting release copper, silver, zinc and arsenic. Factors including agriculture,6 households7 and R&D8 usage have led to the wide spread distribution of heavy metals in the ecosystem. Heavy metals obtained in the form of sulphates, nitrates and nitrites9 release contaminant gases of sulfur and nitrogen into the atmosphere. The most common heavy metals are chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and arsenic (As). Because of their high reactivity,10 these metals can easily accumulate in the living tissue and potentially enter into the food chain, resulting in serious impact. High concentration of mercury can lead to long-term medical disorders and in rare occasions causes a permanent neurological change;11 lead can enter into the body via the pulmonary system through contaminated water or food12 and causes a prolonged disorder in adults13 including high blood pressure and kidney failure. High levels of lead exposure in pregnant women lead to premature birth and malnutrition during birth and sometimes cause miscarriage and stillbirth;14 chromium affects the components of the immune system and may result in immunostimulation or immunosuppression;15 cadmium causes serious illness like itai- itai disease,16 softening of bone and renal failure;17 nickel is one of the most common causes of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD),18 amyloid precipitation, Wilson's disease,19 and Parkinson's diseases20 caused due to an accumulation of copper ions in the organs and organ system of the human body.
Conventional methods21 of sensing metal ions include AAS, ICP-MS, ICP-AES, voltammetry, atomic absorption spectrometry,22,23 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,24 ion-selective electrodes,25 solvent extraction,26etc. Being these methods are expensive, crucial standard operating procedures are required in ex-situ investigation.27 Researchers were in the search of an efficient tool for sensing different toxic metals from lethal metal ions (Hg2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Cr2+, etc.) to interfering metal ions (Cu2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, etc.) through a single platform in a cost-effective manner. In this regard, three different promising approaches have involved the use of optical sensors, electrochemical sensors and surface adsorption technique.28 Though the latter technique has been efficient in both detection and elimination of metal ions,29 a plenty of discoveries have utilized the former two methods of detection. This is because of significant selectivity and sensitivity over detection of analytes and in several discoveries the former two techniques have been employed in an in-situ determination of metal ions and other organic molecules in a biological system. Thus firstly, optical sensors have a number of benefits in sensing applications30 and they are found to be the promising tool for developing highly selective, sensitive and cost-effective sensors. Optical sensors work on colorimetric (through naked eyes)31 and fluorimetry methods of detection.32 Upon the addition of metal ions to the fluorimetry probe, changes in fluorescence can be observed; it may either quench or enhance the fluorescence. Comparatively, electrochemical sensors too have advantages like good resolution, low power consumption, linear output, specific operation in the ppm range, repeatability, accuracy, low detection limit and detection of toxic gases and oxygen.33
Another issue has been selecting an appropriate probe. Several organic molecules were used as an optical sensor. Despite their advantages, they have various drawbacks like restrictive pH action, solubility in organic solvents, instability in competitive environments, selectivity and sensitivity. Recognizing the suitable moiety is another challenge. In the recent past the versatile nature of conjugated polymer compounds has attracted a researcher to validate its versatility. Conjugated polymers are an all-round polymer moiety having photo-physical, photo-chemical, electrochemical and biological applications.34 The fundamental unit of CPs is its conjugated polymer backbone. These backbones facilitate high stability, aqueous solubility, pH adoptability and biocompatibility. By varying the receptor and acceptor molecules in the polymeric chemo sensors they can be used as an efficient tool in several applications.35,36 Other than metal ion sensing, they have found importance in the field of organic molecule detection,37 reactive oxygen detection and as an active redox material to make them a portable sensor;38,39 thin films were fabricated for both fluorescent sensing and electro chemical sensing. Recent publications identified CPs as an even more versatile probe used as a drug delivery system40 and an explosive detector.
To date, several outstanding reviews amply outlined and individually discussed the optical sensors,41 functional electronic devices and electrochemical sensors42 and biomedical applications including implantable electronics towards clinical applications.43 To the knowledge of the authors, so far, no particular review article was published in describing the overall behavior of conjugated polymers with a distinguished list of monomers and polymers. Therefore, explaining the mechanism involved in altering the fluorescence of the polymeric optical sensor of metal ions, organic molecules, and biological compounds, electrochemical activity and bio chemical activity has been taken as a key objective in this review article. In this review, research articles published since 2015 to the present were taken for consideration. A consolidation of various monomers and their applications, polymers and references is given in Table 1. The overall sensing mechanism and details of detection are summarized in Table 2, followed by explanations. Later segments furnish the electrochemical activity and bio-medical applications. The overview is presented at the end of this review.

2. Photo physical behavior
2.1 Fluorescent sensors
In a comprehensive way conjugated polymeric chemo sensors were designed in the form of pendant recognition units, polymeric backbone recognition, microporous conjugated polymers (MCPs), polymer dots, graphene oxide and silicon base polymers;44 however, in general the above mentioned structure basically consists of either a continuous link of monomers or an alternate linkage of two or more monomers.45,46 Various monomers have been employed in constructing a prudent polymer with enhanced fluorescence. Enhancement of fluorescence of the polymer with the respective monomers is due to the presence of electron donor and acceptor groups and its extended conjugated setup. This fluorescence enhancement was however quenched or further enhanced by the introduction of an external molecule or ion to the fluorimetry probe.47 Fluorescent probes of CPs are used for metal ion detectors, organic molecule sensors, gas detectors and explosive detectors. A detailed description of the fluorescent sensing mechanism is as follows.

2.1.1 Metal ion sensors. 
Carbazole is a heterocyclic molecule found to be an excellent electron donor group which when coupled with various other electron accepting monomers like pyrazine, terpyridine, quinoxaline, etc. acts as an efficient fluorimetry probe for sensing and other notable applications. For instance, Upadhyay et al.48 have synthesized carbazole based donor acceptor polymeric probes P1, P2, and P3 for Ni2+ detection in THF. The polymer backbone was designed as alternate carbazole and quinoxaline units with three different side chains. The polymer consists of continuous imine linkage obtained by Wittig condensation with formylated carbazole and aminated quinoxaline units. The details of the reaction are presented in Fig. 1. Photoluminescence examination reveals high selectivity of polymers for Ni2+ sensing; metal complex formation followed by electron transfer from the polymer to the complex was the main cause for the fluorescence quenching of the polymer.
 Fig. 1  Synthesis of polymers (P1–P3). 
In deed carbazole acts as an excellent donor group; the work of Upadhyay et al. again proved it by condensing carbazole and pyrazine units with the varying side chains in P4, P5, and P6. Here carbazole and pyrazine are electron donor and electron acceptor groups respectively. Absorption of incident light causes intermolecular charge transfer between carbazole and pyrazine groups. A comprehensive fluorescence behavior of all the polymers was studied, which reveals a redshift with high polar solvents from THF to DMF. The alkyl side chain on the formed polymer spine impacted the optical properties of the polymer. Thus, a notable red-shifted absorption peak was observed in polymer P4 with heptyl carbon substitution in the side chain in comparison with dimethyl alkyl bromide substituted CP. In the presence of Cd2+, the fluorescence intensity quenched to “turn off” mode on account of photoelectron transfer (PET) that happened between interspersed carbazole and pyridine polymeric spine with Cd2+ (Fig. 2).49
 Fig. 2  The binding mode of carbazole-based polymer P4 with Cd2+ ions resulting in PET. 
Taking into account the importance of carbazole monomer in the PL response, Yang and coworkers synthesized a carbazole functionalized cross linked polymer by a rarified RAFT approach; Ching's work was one among the very few research studies which adopted the RAFT method for the synthetic procedure of a conjugated polymer (PC2Br) using 3,6-dimethyl-9-(4-vinylbenzyl)-9H-carbazole (monomer-1) and 4-cyano-4-(thiobenzoylthio)pentanoic acid (CTP). This RAFT process is catalyzed by AIBN with toluene as a solvent. The reaction mixture was heated at 90 °C in a vacuum tube for about 48 h. Further PC2Br was allowed for a Heck coupling reaction with terpyridine derivative to form a polymer PCaT (P7) (Fig. 3). Another polymer was synthesized by the Heck coupling method with 3,6-dimethyl-9-(4-methylbenzyl)-9H-carbazole (monomer-2) and styrene derivative to form a polymer PCT. The yield of PCT is greater among the three polymers (35.6%). A comparative photoluminescence study of PCT and PCaT was carried out. The study exhibits the high selectivity of PCaT to Fe3+ ions with an LOD of 1.3 μM (Table 2).50
 Fig. 3  Chemical structure of polymeric sensor P7. 
Fluorene is an excellent conjugated system being utilized extensively by researchers. Notably Petzoldt51 and his research group synthesized cross-shaped metallo-reactive fluorophore polyfluorene (XFPF) (P8) (Fig. 4). They have developed a combined molecular wire effect with a biphasic sensor (a competitive environment in the presence of water and in sensor dye 2-methyltetrahydrofuran); this was also found to be an excellent colorimetric sensor for Hg2+ ions. An immediate color change from turquoise to yellow was observed when 500 μM mercuric ion solution was added to the solution. They have also developed a biphasic system in a microfluidic chip. But we strictly restrict ourselves to explaining its fluorescence mechanism. Strong fluorescence quenching was observed when Hg2+ ions were introduced to the polymer solution. The quenching of fluorescence was due to the competitive binding of water molecules to Hg2+ in the presence of XFPF. The limit of detection was observed to be 20 mM (Table 1).
 Fig. 4  Structure of fluorene-based polymer P8. 
Generally, metal coordination with the conjugated polymer shows pronounced absorption and emission when compared to a just conjugate polymer compound. Predominantly, coordination of metal ions takes place with the group adjoined with the polymer backbone. Sen and Valiyaveettil52 further enhanced the absorption and emission of a fluorene and carbazole backboned polymer by conjugating it with gallic acid; as this compound contains multiple conceding sites it caused an electronic conjugation with the polymer spine, resulting in an intensified response. The vinylene linkage between gallic acid and polymer spine showed a stronger binding constant towards zinc (Zn2+) ions52 (Fig. 5). This was clear from the Stern–Volmer quenching constants of polymers for Zn2+ ions. Polymer P1(OH)n (P9) is a fluorene and thiophene based polymer and showed a notable red shift in emission maximum from 475 nm to 535 nm along with a 74% decrease in emission intensity in the presence of zinc ions. Initially, the polymers with protected hydroxy groups were taken for the metal ion detection; none of the polymers showed any emission band change when heavy metal ions were added. Later all the three polymers (P1(OH)n, P2(OH)n, and P3(OH)n) with free hydroxy groups were used to detect Zn2+ ions.
 Fig. 5  Structure of P9 and its binding mechanism for Zn2+. 
Yongmei and Xiaolei53 utilized the versatility of conjugated polymers; as some CPs are highly biocompatible in nature, a bipolar probe was constructed with hydrophilic DNA and a hydrophobic conjugated polymer (CP) unit. In an aqueous solution, they can form micelles with a hydrophobic CP core and a hydrophilic DNA shell. Aggregation of micelles always leads to turn-off fluorescence. When Hg2+ ions are added into the bipolar probe (P10), hydrophilic DNA surrounds the metal ion and results in an aggregation caused quenching effect of adjacent hydrophobic CP fluorescence. The sensing mechanism involves selective determination of Hg2+ ions at room temperature using thymine–Hg2+–thymine coordination chemistry (Fig. 6). A breakthrough LOD was observed to be 21 nm for mercury detection (Table 1). Another target binding induces the collapse of micelles that ends up in turn-off fluorescence of micelles.

Recently a reaction-based fluorescence sensing mechanism grabbed attention due to its high selectivity towards the analyte and exhibition of vibrant fluorescence. With this note in 2017 Ding et al.54 developed a similar kind of sensor for the detection of mercuric ions. After the addition of Hg2+ to the polymer with a dithioacetal side chain (PDT) P11, induced reaction occurs. The added mercuric ion influences the conversion (deprotection reaction) of dithioacetal into aldehyde one polymer (PA1) (Fig. 7). The magnificent orange-red fluorescence emission is attributed to various electron transfer in the polymer spine. Intermolecular charge transfer is efficient in PAI. Because of particular chemical reaction, PDT shows faster reciprocation and peculiar selectivity towards Hg2+, which results in a molecular wire effect and signal amplification effect.

Following the analogous approach of reaction-based fluorescence sensing of analytes, a novel AIEE active polymeric probe PTS (P12) was synthesized (Fig. 8). Initially tetraphenyl ethylene was converted into 1-(4-(2,2-bis(4-bromophenyl)-1-phenylvinyl)phenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethenone (TPE-O) which was further copolymerized with an alkylated fluorene moiety, giving poly[1-(4-(2-(4-(9,9-dihexyl-7-methyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)phenyl)-1-phenyl-2-p-tolylvinyl)phenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethanone] (PTO). Then PTO is treated with 2-ethanedithiol (3.00 equiv.) and then BF3·Et2O (6.00 equiv.) (Lewis acid) was added; dry DCM is used as a solvent for the reaction process. PTO was then finally converted into poly[2-(4-(2-(4-(9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)phenyl)-1,2-diphenylvinyl)phenyl)-2-(4-nitrobenzyl)-1,3-dithiolane] (PTS) (P12). Even in the presence of numerous interfering ions, the TPE-S group in the polymer PTS shows high selectivity toward Hg2+. The PL enhancement is remarkable to the naked eye; this is a good sign of an effective sensor. As mentioned in (B2), deprotection reaction occurs when a metal ion is added to the polymeric solution; here, a dithiacetal group is converted into a ketone group (TPE-S to TPE-O) (Fig. 8).55

Considering the importance of fluorene as a potential unit for optical sensing application Spiliopoulos56 has synthesized a variety of polymers with different mole combinations of fluorene, imidazole and triphenyl amine. This researcher has successfully synthesized three different polymers (Fig. 9). Amongst the three polymers PFIM100, PFIM50 and PFIM25, polymers PFIM50 and PFIM25 with TPA and imidazole show a remarkable solvatochromic effect due to the presence of an efficient electron donating group TPA and an electron accepting group imidazole unit, which facilitates enhanced emission maxima; this does not affect the absorption maxima of the polymer. This means that it has negligible charge transfer in the ground state. Emission of the polymer PFIM100 (P13) is independent of solvent polarity because of the absence of the TPA unit. The rest of the polymers show the photo induced charge transfer in the excited state. However P13 polymer (PMIF100) contains alternating imidazole and fluorene. The potential usage of P13 as a chemo sensor, because of the presence of imidazole, was examined. PFIM100 displayed a double fluorescence reaction to Fe2+ and Hg2+. Fe2+ quenched the emission of CP. Photoluminescence diminishing and Fe2+ concentration showed linearity up to 70 μmol L−1. Interestingly, Hg2+ could be recognized through fluorescence ‘turn-on’ of the polymer (P13)/iodide complex. Photoluminescence ‘turn-on’ and Hg2+ concentration displayed linearity at a concentration of 2–10 μmol L−1.

In 2015, Hui Zhanga et al. synthesized polyfluorene by a direct electrochemical method. Poly[N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-glycine] (P9FG) was electrochemically prepared with boron trifluoride diethyl etherate electrolyte (BFEE-DCM) as a mixture system (Fig. 9).57 The onset oxidation potential of the system was reduced when BFEE was added to pure DCM containing Bu4NBF4; it was reduced from 1.48 V to 1.17 V. And then it increased from 1.17 V to 1.98 V. High onset oxidation potential effectively aims the monomers over oxidation at the polymerization potential, bringing about annihilation of the formed construction of the polymers and debasement of their properties. The reduction in the onset oxidation potential can forestall side reactions adequately and lead to great polymer film preparation. Thus, the polyfluorene prepared was an excellent turn-off fluorescence sensor for Cr2O72−, Fe3+ and Cu2+ (P14).
A similar approach for synthesizing a polymer by a direct electrochemical method was again considered by the same research group Hui Zhanga et al., in 2017. This research group again synthesized a conjugated poly fluorene with a histidine side chain polymer P15 for a highly selective Cr3+ sensor. This polymer (P15) is a kind of polymer with a pendant recognizing unit having histidine as a side chain. The histidine group has two functional groups namely carbonyl and Schiff nitrogen which act as a potential ground for the chelation of Cr3+ ions. The effect of quenching of the Schiff base completely disappeared due to the chelation which caused turn on fluorescence when metal ions were added and the carbonyl oxygen collaboratively enhanced the recognition of Cr3+. The pendant unit of the PFLH-based chemosensor for chromium ions is presented in Fig. 10.58

A series of chromium sensors have been developed because of the toxicity of chromium, considering the limit of chromium in drinking water and in food products as prescribed by the WHO; the need for the development of chromium sensors gained huge attention. A series of direct electrochemical syntheses of polyfluorene with amino acid side chains for the detection of chromium in real samples were again successfully performed by Hui Zhanga (Fig. 11).59 This time the sensor has higher efficiency with a great detection limit of 72 pM in a linear range of 80 pM to 1.95 mM. The serine unit of poly(Fmoc-L-serine) (PFOLS) (P16) contains numerous functional groups such as carboxylic acid, hydroxy, and amine that operate as a recognition unit for chromate ions and, more significantly, to prevent anions and other acid substances from interfering with chromate ions during detection. The interaction between metal ions and P16 can be suppressed through addition of some highly reactive chelating agents (EDTA, pyrophosphate, and citrate); they have a strong binding ability with metals. In the presence of EDTA, P16 only showed a response to Cr2O72− with the LOD reaching 72 pM. In a photoluminescence study quenching of fluorescence occurs which involves the signal amplification effect by a molecular wire of polymers.
 Fig. 11  Electrochemical synthesis of a highly sensitive fluorescent sensor P16. 
Again, a notable work from the same research group Hui Zhanga et al. in 201660 electro chemically synthesized a fluorene based conjugated polymer with carboxylic side chains meant for selective Fe3+ ion detection in a real sample. The tunable property of polyfluorene is well utilized by this group by simply varying the side chains and employed in the detection of a variety of metal ions. The sensing mechanism enormously varied from the rest of the poly fluorene-based sensors. In this alcohol-soluble poly(9-fluorenecarboxylic acid) (PFCA) P17 the sensing of ferric ions Fe3+ happens through an analyte induced aggregation of polymer chains (Fig. 12) which was confirmed by TEM images.
 Fig. 12  (A) Chemical structure of polymer P17 and (B) schematic representation of Fe3+ induced aggregation of polymer chains. 
Poly phenylene has been utilised extensively in OLED, solar cells, biological sensors, and other optoelectronic devices due to its modifiable electronic and optical behavior as a vital fluorescent conjugated polymer. A research group explored its optical behavior by developing a highly sensitive and on-site Cu2+ detecting turn-off fluorimetry probe which was prepared by Amit Sil et al. Terpyridyl appended alternate phenylene and fluorene backboned polymer (P18) shows brilliant blue emission upon irradiation. When the polymer (P18) is treated with stoichiometric 1:1 ratio of Cu2+ and terpyridine unit, a bathochromic or red shift of 4 nm was observed at 328 nm with an increased intensity; this was accompanied by an additional absorbance band at 332 nm. A turn off fluorescent sensor for copper ions due to a molecular wire effect shows very high selectivity and sensitivity. A plausible mechanism of metal ion sensing was studied using cyclic voltammograms. The energy of dx2–y2 orbital of Cu2+ was in between the HOMO and LUMO of the polymer probe, which facilitates PET from the lower unoccupied molecular orbital of the excited π-conjugated polymer probe to the vacant d-orbital of the metal ion and electrons return to the HOMO of the probe in a non-radiative process, resulting in fluorescence quenching (Fig. 13).61
 Fig. 13  Schematic representation of molecular wire effect of chemosensor P18 resulting in photo-induced electron transfer (PET). 
In a similar line of preparing alt-polyfluorene, Yang L1 and his research group changed the alternating group in P18 from phenylene to truxene in order to study the variation in its photophysical behavior. They synthesized truxene functionalized poly fluorene with terpyridine as a pendant recognizing unit (P19) (Fig. 14)62 through Suzuki coupling reaction. When investigated for the metal ion detection the polymer showed high selectivity to Fe3+ ions with a detection limit of 2.13 × 10−7 M. In the THF–H2O mixture, the addition of the analyte (Fe3+) caused a fluorescence change from bright purple to dark. A more stable Fe3+–tpy complex formed due to the high electron accepting capacity of ferric ions generated as a result of the smaller diameter and high charge density of ferric ions. A trace amount of CN− anions to the mixture recovered fluorescence due to formation of a highly stable CN−–Fe3+ complex.
 Fig. 14  Structure of chemo sensor P19. 
In 2015, the Lijuan Feng research group has identified a novel route to synthesize a FRET-based fluorescent probe consisting of MSN for ratiometric detection of Hg2+ ions. Fabrication of the mesoporous nano sensor has three main steps: firstly, through an in situ polymerization route poly phenylene vinylene (PP) was encapsulated into mesoporous silica nanoparticles and CTACl surfactant to prepare the hybrid fluorescent nanoparticle (PPV@MSNs); secondly, probe molecules (spirolactam rhodamine-B (SRhB)) for Hg2+ ion detection were prepared by treating rhodamine-B dye and polymer. Finally, the solution of PPV@MSN was centrifuged with SRhB to get the desired PPV@MSN@SRhB nano sensors (P20). In this process, the spirolactam rhodamine group changed into the ring-opened state due to its complexation with Hg2+ ions, and the fluorescence of the PPV donor was quenched by transferring its energy to the ring-opened RhB through FRET. The non-coordinated P20 shows a strong emission at 502–536 nm on excitation at 370 nm in an ethanol/water (1:1, v/v) solvent mixture. However, the addition of Hg confers a decrease in emission intensity of PPV at 502–536 nm and a new fluorescence emission at 585 nm appeared which was attributed to the spirolactam ring-opening of the rhodamine-B unit (Fig. 15)63 and subsequent FRET between the donor PPV@MSN and acceptor SRhB.
 Fig. 15  Schematic representation of Hg2+ sensing by the mesoporous silica-based ratiometric fluorescent nanosensor P20via the FRET process. 
In a line of exploring the versatility of the poly phenylene vinylene polymer probe, novel phenylene–vinylene polymer dots P21 were synthesized by Xu et al.64 With the addition of numerous metal ions, P21 (Fig. 16) displayed selective fluorescence quenching at 585 nm only with Fe3+ and without any fluorescence colorimetric change. These changes were ascribed to complex chemical interaction of the phenolic hydroxyl group with ferric ions. It was clearly known that the existence of O–H in the imperfect molecular structures is the main reason causing the quenching of Fe3+.
 Fig. 16  Chemical structures of P21, P22 and P23 sensors. 
Phenylene and benzimidazole-based conjugated polyelectrolytes (+)-PPBIPV and (−)-PPBIPV (P22 and P23) (Fig. 16) having opposite charges on their side chains were prepared via Heck coupling reaction.65 The absorption and emission spectra of these polymers exhibit their solvent-dependency and concentration-dependency, and they also have an aggregation effect in aqueous solution. The absorbance maximum of (+)-PPBIPV and (−)-PPBIPV in methanol and water was 403, 415, 405, and 408 nm respectively. The aqueous solution of (+)-PPBIPV has outstanding selectivity and sensitivity for Fe3+ in ion detection. In methanol solution, Pd2+ can almost completely quench the fluorescence of (+)-PPBIPV, with a quenching constant of 5.93104 M−1. Zn2+ induced a 100 percent fluorescence enhancement in (−)-PPBIPV polymer solution having water as a solvent, while Fe3+ in methanol was detected better with a KSV = 3.44105 M−1 due to metal ion aggregation around the polymer probe in (−)-PPBIPV.
A novel thiazine-based polymer nanosphere was developed for the detection and removal of environmentally threatening toxic mercuric ions (Hg2+). NOP-28 (P24) was prepared by a simple Friedel–Crafts reaction. The polymer in ethanol suspension unveils a significant fluorescence emission signal at roughly 415 nm. It was as a result of the donor–acceptor type π-conjugated structure, which contains electron-accepting 1,3,5-triazine and electron-donating diphenyl sulphate parts. With the subsequent addition of mercuric ions to the polymer the nanosphere causes a spontaneous reduction of emission intensity of fluorescence.
The fluorescence quenching behavior of the polymer was attributed to the polymer NOP-28 providing the energy and electrons to metal complexes produced, or it might be due to metal ion-induced polymer chain aggregation (Fig. 17).66
 Fig. 17  Hg2+ recognition of fluorescent probe P24. 
Dipanjan et al. investigated the sensitive and selective fluorescent Cu2+ sensor probe p-bromophenyl substituted benzodithieno-imidazole π-conjugated polymer. Two polymers P25 and P25a were synthesized from the ligands p-bromobenzodithieno-imidazole and p-tolylphenylbenzodithieno-imidazole respectively. Complexation study with both the ligands clearly explains no significant change with the ligand having the electron donating methyl group in its para position. However p-bromobenzodithieno-imidazole with electron donating bromine shows a significant photophysical change toward Cu2+ with the competing metal ion. Thus, the photoluminescence study of P25 was explored with Cu2+, which exhibited an excellent quenching of vibrant cyan fluorescence of the probe. The chelating site with “N” and “S” heteroatoms was responsible for binding with metal cations where interaction of the fluorophore unit with paramagnetic Cu2+ was caused by photoinduced electron transfer (Fig. 18).67
 Fig. 18  Structure of water-soluble polymeric probe P25 and sensing of Cu2+ through complex formation. 
In later 2015, the Naoya Adachi research group fabricated a water-soluble conjugated polymer–graphene oxide (GO) composite (Fig. 19).68 In order to synthesize a firm non-covalent water-soluble (solubility in water) PPE–GO composite poly(p-phenylene ethynylene) (PPE)–graphene oxide P27 sulfonic acid side chain was introduced in the PPE backbone for strong π–π interactions between PPE and GO. Both the polymer PPE P26 and the composite PPE-GO P27 were demonstrated for selective and sensitive metal ion sensing. Surprisingly PPE and PPE–GO show great selectivity and sensitivity for Cu2+. The absorbance band of PPE at 530 nm quenched up to 80% following the addition of metal ions. This excellent fluorescence quenching was due to an enhanced delocalization of singlet excitons and the faster energy migration along the backbone of the polymer. No significant absorption band was observed in the PPE–GO composite because of strong π–π interactions between the polymer and graphene oxide. Hence the composite exhibited an excellent turn-on property when Cu2+ was added. When cuprous ions were added to the polymer composite they interacted with the carboxylic acid group on GO bound by electrostatic attraction, leading to a dissociation of the polymer from the P27 composite.
 Fig. 19  Chemical structure of polymeric sensor P26. 
A dual response conjugated polymer sensor (PPETE-RB) (P28) with alternate phenylene ethynylene and thienylene–ethynylene as the backbone and rhodamine-B as a pendant recognition unit for the detection of Fe2+/Fe3+ was developed by Yichen Zhang et al.69 (Fig. 20). This polymer showed two strong emission bands at 481 nm and 571 nm due to the presence of the π-conjugated framework of polymer and the rhodamine-B unit respectively. The mechanism of dual response of fluorescence enhancement and fluorescence quenching was quite interesting. The emission around 481 nm (excited at 360 nm) decreased due to a competition in absorption between the polymer and Fe2+/Fe3+, called the inner filter effect (IFE) and the emission around 571 nm (excited at 520 nm) formed which increased with an increase in concentration of Fe2+/Fe3+ which was attributed to spirolactam ring opening of the rhodamine-B unit.
 Fig. 20  The synthetic route to the conjugated polymer P28. 
Another potential monomer pyrene boronic acid for detecting Cu2+ was prepared by the Zhang group using the electrochemical polymerization technique.70 The electrochemical polymerization of pyrene boronic acid (PYBA) was performed using a potentiostat–galvanostat under computer control. Two platinum sheets with large area were employed as the counter and working electrodes in order to create a considerable quantity of polymer films (OPYBA) (P29) (Fig. 21); an Ag/AgCl electrode served as a reference electrode. PYBA monomer itself caused fluorescence quenching upon addition of Cu2+ ions. However, polymerization enhances the sensitivity of detection due to complexation of metal ions with both the pendant recognizing boronic acid group and pyrene backbone. This was confirmed by an observation of a new absorption peak at 478 nm when Cu2+ was introduced to OPYBA, which increased the conjugated chain length. Dramatic quenching of fluorescence was observed when Cu2+ and Co2+ were added. Interestingly addition of Co2+ shows a colorimetric change from yellow to pink. Hence the quenching effect can be easily distinguished. The LOD for the detection of Cu2+ was found to be 23 pM (Table 1).
 Fig. 21  (A) Electrochemical synthesis of pyrene-based chemosensors. (B) Chemical structure of polymers of P29 and P30. 
Later, Jian and coworkers also synthesized a pendant recognizing pyrene-based polymer probe by electro chemical polymerization in boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BFEE). Oligo(1-pyrenesulfonic acid) (P30) (Fig. 21)71 was used for the selective and sensitive recognition of Fe3+ ions in aqueous solution. The synthetic procedure was similar to the one which was mentioned in previous research work.57,70 Oligo(1-pyrenesulfonic acid) was also a kind of pendant recognizing polymer probe with sulphonic acid in its side chain. The ability to sense a specific metal ion in the presence of multiple competing metal ions is the most important condition for a selective sensing probe. The fluorescence of P30 in water exhibited a selective response upon adding Fe3+ but negligible response upon adding other cations. Binding induced aggregation caused a quenching of fluorescence of polymer probe with a detection limit of Fe3+ of 1.0 × 10−7 M.
The importance of triphenyl amine was very well illustrated by Ruey-Shin and coworkers in the year 2016.72 A multifunctional alt-conjugated polyfluorene–TPA was synthesized via Suzuki coupling reaction (Fig. 22). The polymers P31, P31a containing an alternate fluorene, triphenyl amine and fluorene, benzene respectively. Both the polymers consist of a terpyridine unit as its side chain coupled with every TPA and benzene. The photoluminescence spectra of the polymer revealed a strong solvent dependency; the PL spectra of P31 were red-shifted in different solvents ranging from toluene (non-polar solvent) to DMSO (polar solvent) with rising Dimroth-Reichardt solvent polarities (i.e., from ET = 33.9 kcal mol−1 to ET = 43.9 kcal mol−1). Introduction of TPA groups in P32 caused a charge separation in the excited state and caused the migration of electrons from TPA–fluorene groups to the terpyridine acceptor unit, resulting in ICT and red shifts (Fig. 22),72 while P31a has a negligible effect, resulting in an increased dipole moment. TPA-based poly fluorene exhibited high selectivity toward Cu2+ (“turn-off” fluorescence) with a Ksv of 2.30 × 105 M−1. Further most polymer–Cu2+ complex restored its fluorescence (“turn-on”) with CN− ions.
 Fig. 22  Solvatochromism of chemosensor P31 and schematic representation of cuprous ion binding with P31. 
Taisheng et al. designed and developed a triphenylamine (TPA)–biimidazole (donor–acceptor) based linear and branched fluorescent probe P32 (Fig. 23). Fluorescence of branched polymer P32 at 417 nm was quenched up to 95% upon the addition of cobalt(II) ions in a proportion of five equivalent metal ions. Then again, with the addition of silver(I) ions, the emission peak at 417 nm exhibited a red shift of 55 nm with decreased intensity. Coordination of silver ions to the biimidazole unit of the branched polymer changed the electron density in P32; this served as a major reason for the shift. From the intensity ratio I475/I417 and I0/I, it was easy to distinguish cobalt and silver ions. Electron transfer between the metal complex and branched polymer backbone contributes to the quenching effect.64
 Fig. 23  Structure of the triphenyl amine and biimidazole based branched fluorescent probe. 
Recently, a polymeric sensor P33 with a Pd2+ coordinating benzimidazole ligand as an alternating unit in a benzothiadiazole backbone polymer was reported by Kuan Liu et al. (Fig. 24).74 The targeted polymeric chemosensor was synthesized through Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction. PPBIBTE showed an outstanding selectivity for Pd2+ by 97% fluorescence quenching. When the metal ion was introduced into the system it resulted in the formation of a D-AM complex by metal–acceptor binding that facilitated ICT. The Stern–Volmer and Benesi–Hildebrand plots and Job's method together proved the fluorescence quenching of the polymer initiated with a 1:1 PPBIBTE–Pd2+ complex, with an association constant value of about 1.78 × 104 M−1 and a quenching constant value of about 7.80 × 104 M−1.
 Fig. 24  Chemical structures of P33 and P34 polymeric sensors. 
A direct arylation polymerization technique was used by Sina Sabury et al.75 to synthesize the thiophene-based copolymer with adenine functionalized side chains as pendant recognizing units. A substituted purine (TAd) and thiophene (tT4h) was used as a monomer to synthesize a polymer (TAd–tT4h) (Fig. 24) (P34). Introduction of adenine functionality enhances the packing of the polymer which provided steric hindrance-induced flexibility to the polymer probe TAd–tT4h, enabling it to be soluble in common organic solvents. This improved solubility facilitates greater binding of metal ions to the adenine base, leading to apparent fluorescence quenching (greater than 90%) with the introduction of Cu2+ ions to the polymer solution under UV-Vis light. Adenine pendent groups chelate cupric ions, and initiate fast fluorescence quenching which was triggered by energy transfer from the conjugated polymer backbone to the adenine-cupric ion complex formed upon metal ion binding.


2.1.2 Gas detectors. 
Although gas detectors have various challenges researchers have employed complex conjugated polymers for the detection of gas. They utilized the photo luminescence technique for the detection. As it was obviously known that conjugated polymers have extended conjugated π systems, they show tremendous fluorescence upon excitation. But fluorescence based gas detectors were not so familiar and it was challenging. In 2015 Taisheng Wang73 and his research team developed a triphenylamine (TPA)–biimidazole (donor–acceptor) based branched fluorescent probe (P32) for the detection of HCl gas and ammonia gas. The maximum absorbance was noted at 351 nm and the emission began at 417 nm. It was basically a kind of reversible gas sensor; upon addition of an acid and base the enhancement and quenching of fluorescence took place. This was fundamentally due to an addition and removal of protons from the biimidazole unit in the polymer backbone (Fig. 25). The protonated biimidazole unit enhanced the ability of electron-accepting nature of the donor–acceptor dye, which led to an increased intermolecular charge transfer that caused a red shift in the emission band from 417 nm to 471 nm.
 Fig. 25  The mechanism of the acid–base gas triggered vapochromism of chemosensor P32. 


2.1.3 Organic molecule sensors. 
Several organic molecules like N,N-dimethylaniline, dimethyl thiophosphate, melamine, and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid are detected through the fluorometric techniques using polymers as a detection probe. Organo phosphorous is highly harmful and has various health hazards like hypersecretion, convulsions, and respiratory disorder and sometimes leads to coma and death.76 Respiratory intake of N,N-dimethylaniline has a direct impact on the central nervous system (CNS) and circulatory system, accompanied by headache, discoloration of skin, and dizziness in humans. Anemia and blood clot in veins are the common symptoms when exposed to EDTA. Melamine poisoning can lead to kidney stone and sometimes kidney failure can cause death.77,78 Various other biomolecules were also investigated by various research groups; the details will be given in biochemical applications.
In keeping this notion of hazardous organic molecules, Uphadhyay et al. developed a carbazole based metal ion and organic molecule sensor. Organic molecules like N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA) and dimethyl thiophosphate (DMTP) were detected through a fluorometric conjugated probe containing carbazole and quinoxaline47 and carbazole and pyrazine.48 This research group has synthesized six different polymers with six different side chains as derivatives P1–P6 (Fig. 1 and 2). All the three polymers (P1–P3) showed a considerable diminishing fluorescence when DMA/DMTP were introduced. The Ksv values of the three polymers were found to be 1.5 × 104 M−1, 2.8 × 104 M−1 and 2.4 × 10−5 M−1 respectively. The quenching effect of P1 was more pronounced when compared to polymers P2 and P3. This variation was clearly due to a varying side chain which caused a negative impact on quenching namely, wearing out of flatness of the polymer backbone and resisting DMA molecules from advancing towards the polymer backbone, while in the case of DMTP, the remarkable electron acceptor DMTP has a strong interaction with the electron donating polymer chain. Such a strong interaction causes a photo induced charge transfer between the analyte and the polymer, resulting in fluorescence quenching.
Sabury et al.75 observation again found importance in the detection of EDTA; a polymer (TAd–tT4h) (Fig. 24) (P34) exhibited selective detection of cupric ions, which showed excellent turn-off fluorescence. The group further extended the study by investigating the photophysical properties of Cu2+-chelated adenine complexes. After the addition of strong binding EDTA to the complex, complete reversibility of fluorescence emission was observed. A strong chelation provided by EDTA extracts copper ions from the organic phase, which results in retrieving fluorescence emission. And basically the metal–polymer complex acted as a turn-on fluorescence sensor for EDTA.
Based on the property of nitrogen as an excellent electron donor in amine units of melamine and pyridyl part of a polymer, strongly held with the electron-deficient surface of silver nanoparticles to form stable polymer nanocomposites P1–AgNPs (P35). Xhu and coworkers79 have successfully investigated the properties of the P35 nanocomposites through the fluorometric technique. P35 excited at 338 nm and showed dual-emission spectra at 389 nm and 465 nm. A ratiometric fluorescent sensor was employed for the investigation of melamine; melamine aggregated with the P1–AgNPs (Fig. 26). When melamine concentration was gradually increased the fluorescence at 386 nm increased constantly, whereas the band around 488 nm decreased. The ratiometric fluorescence intensity F386/F488 increased abruptly at small concentrations of melamine, and then increased passively at elevated concentration of melamine. The ratiometric fluorescence intensity F386/F488 exhibited amazing linearity towards melamine in two ranges of 0.1–1.0 nM (F386/F488 = 0.319 + 0.168 Cmelamine, correlation coefficient R = 0.990) and 1.0–1.5 × 103 nM (F386/F488 = 0.544 + 4.924 × 10−4Cmelamine, correlation coefficient R = 0.995), respectively.
 Fig. 26  Schematic representation of the ratiometric fluorescent and colorimetric detection of melamine dependent on P35–AgNPs. 


2.1.4 Explosive detectors. 
It is notable that conjugated fluorescent polymers can be utilized for the identification of different chemical and biological agents like metal particles, organic moieties, explosives, and bio molecules like DNA and proteins either by quenching or by improving the fluorescence of the polymers. But the explosive detection by means of the fluorescence technique was not so common. To further investigate the chance of utilizing conjugated fluorophores for the detection of explosives Weeradech Kiratitanavit et al.80 made a remarkable achievement in developing polyphenols by a greener way through enzymatic catalysis. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPA), hydroxytyrosol (HDT), and chlorogenic acid (CGA) were polymerized via enzyme catalysis with horseradish peroxidase as a catalyst. Polyphenols (P36a, P36b, and P36c) (Fig. 27) were chosen because they exhibit fluorescence with an exceptional red or Stokes shift in the range 30–100 nm, which rendered fluorescence quenching-based sensors for the detection of nitro aromatic DNT and TNT. Another TNT detector developed by copolymerizing fluorene and thiophene has been explained in the portable sensor section. As polymers found importance in portable sensing of picric acid a combined explanation has been presented there.
 Fig. 27  Structure of polyphenols P36a, P36b, and P36c. 


2.1.5 Portable sensors. 
Cost-effective portable sensors are the emerging trend in the market since the rise in using synthetic products has various toxic by-products. L. R. Adil, P. Gopikrishna, and P. K. Iyer invented an inexpensive tool for the detection of 2,4,6 tri nitro phenol [picric acid (PA)].81 It was developed using Whatman filter paper by dipping it in THF solution of the copolymer PFTPBZ (P37) (Fig. 28). A piece of paper dried and exposed to vapor of PA at different time interval, the quenching of fluorescence visible in UV lamp. The reusability of the paper strip was confirmed by using it again by washing in DI water. The following gives a detailed idea about the preparation and sensing mechanism of the copolymer PFTPBZ (P37).
 Fig. 28  Chemical structure of chemosensor P37. 
A portable onsite sensor for picric acid was synthesized using an AIEE active bromostyryl functionalized thiophene monomer which was copolymerized with boronic acid functionalized dioctyl fluorene ester via a Suzuki coupling process. Though the successfully designed polymer PFTPBZ (P35a) lacks receptors, it showed AIEE behavior and displayed high selectivity and fluorescence quenching to picric acid (PA) and 2,4,6-trinitroglycerin. The investigation was carried out in THF solution, aggregate state 40% and 95% water fraction fw for PA and TNT sensing. The two different sensing mechanisms FRET and PET were confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and TRPL experiments.
The possibility of FRET of PFTPBZ was observed in fw 95%. In fw 40% there was a significant overlap of the quencher and fluorochrome; no proximal distance between them causes no FRET, while in fw 95% there was a slight spectral overlap between the fluorophore and quencher, yet there occurred high aggregation, resulting in FRET. Under the photo induced charge transfer mechanism, energy transfer takes place from the HOMO to LUMO (PFTPBZ to PA and TNT). CV investigation displayed only an oxidation peak. The HOMO and LUMO of PFTPBA were observed at −5.65 eV and −3.32 eV and the estimated optical band gap was 2.33 eV obtained from the onset of solid state absorption spectra. PET took place between the LUMO of the luminogen to LUMO of TNT and PA (Fig. 29). The LOD for PA was obtained to be 28.16 × 10−7 M and for TNT in 40% and 95% water fraction the LOD was found to be 10.47 × 10−6 M and 47.39 × 10−8 M respectively.

3. Electrochemical application
3.1 Electrochemical sensors
The electro chemical sensor is a prominent tool in the field of sensors, as it is reliable in the detection of analytes in a very short span of time, with least expenditure processes, superfluous sophisticated equipment, portability, and low detection limit. A most efficient redox active material is chosen for the process. The lesser the difference in peak oxidation and reduction potential the more efficient the detection of analytes. Electrochemically active materials either oxidize or reduce the analyte; thus, the change in potential and current measures the efficiency of detection. Some of the important CPs like poly aniline (P39 and P42), amic acid (P38), truxene (41), and benzene tetramine (P40)82–86 (Fig. 30) have been employed for electrochemical sensing application and have been successful in determining a variety of compounds from an inorganic element and organic molecule to bio-molecules. The details of sensing ability of some conjugated polymers are listed in Table 3.

Recent studies showed that the electrochemical detection ability of CPs was outstanding with the least LOD and they can be made as a portable sensor. A simple polymer polyamic acid–AgNPs (P38) on a glassy carbon electrode too has a wide range of signal intensities from 10 μM to 6000 μM and a LOD of 1.68 μM for nitro benzene detection.82 Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the reversible feature of poly amic acid. The electrochemical property of the PAA–AgNP composite was studied on the surface of a gold electrode using CV with 25 mV s−1 to 200 mV s−1 scan rate. Between −600 mV and 900 mV, an apparent reversible redox couple was observed at 350 mV and 547 mV. With a cathodic and anodic peak separation of 100 mV, a formal potential was centered at 430 mV. Sensing of nitrobenzene was carried out in a GC electrode with a constant scan rate of 100 mV s−1. When nitro benzene was introduced a sharp reduction peak potential was observed at −0.752 V; this was attributed to that the nitro benzene was reduced to phenyl hydroxylamine. An increase in scan rates from 20 to 200 mV s−1 simultaneously increases the reduction peak and a negative shift in peak potential was observed. A linear relationship between the reduction peak current response of nitro benzene and the square root of rates indicates that the reduction of nitro benzene is an irreversible process.
Fabrication of a working electrode is a bit tedious process when it comes to a bio sensor; it involves a stepwise crucial procedure for making a wide surface area for an analyte to be in contact with the surface of the electrode deposited with a redox active material.73,86 A detailed structural elucidation and construction of electrodes have been explained by Karen et al. during an attempt to detect BCR/ABL gene.83 Aniline was electrochemically polymerized to generate a positively charged poly aniline which was made into a nanocomposite with gold nanoparticles embedded in 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPTMS). Fabrication began by depositing the AuNP–PANI nanocomposite later on a DNA probe adsorbed on to the composite coated gold electrode surface (Fig. 31).

Karen et al. utilized the AFM and TEM imaging techniques to study the immobilization of DNA on to the modified gold electrode. With due importance to surface plasmon resonance imaging study of the gold electrode surface, another research article has been considered for a review highlighting the importance of SPR imaging and SPR sensors. In early 2014 Singh and Aurora87 reported SPR based detection of salmonella on a gold electrode functionalized with a self-assembled DNA. SPR basically works on the principle of production of plasmons (electric charge density) when polarized light strikes the conducting electrode surface interface, thereby resulting in the decrease of reflected light through a particular angle called resonance angle in proportion to the mass of the sensor surface. The advantage of using SPR techniques includes the tracing of one-base mismatch sequences and enhanced reusability up to several hybridization cycles at room temperature.
As we described earlier, during electrochemical sensing of an analyte either it may be oxidized or reduced by an analyzer, here probably a conjugated polymer. In 2018, Dequig Lin and coworkers84 through thermal annealing of a polymer at about 1000 °C synthesized microporous polymer nanosheets. They synthesized microporous N,P-codoped graphitic nanosheets N,P-CMP-1000 (P40) and described the details of metal-free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and utilized an entire pH range for the energy conversion process and also for biosensing of dissolved oxygen (Fig. 32). N,P-CMP-1000 was applied for in vitro sensing of dissolved oxygen (CCK-8 and both live and dead cell staining assay).

3.2 Organic electrochemical transistors
The organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is an electrolyte gated transistor that allows electrical and ionic charges in organic molecules to be coupled together. The semi-permeability of CP films to hydrated ions made them an optimistic electronic material for the sensing of ions. CP films are sensitive to polarity and valence of the ions. In the fabrication of the OECT, the CP film is used as a transistor channel and the function of the gate electrode has been designated to the metal piece. An interface has been developed using an electrolyte between the transistor channel and a gate electrode.
The first ever dual cation sensing crown-ether functionalized CP88 was developed by Shofarul Wustani et al. PEDOT (P43a, P43b) was synthesized using a sodium and potassium ion selective monomer based on thiophene (Fig. 33). The construction of the OECT is schematically depicted in Fig. 34. In P43 channel substantial current runs due to the absence of a gate voltage (VG); at negative voltage cations drifted towards the gate electrode. The transconductance value (gm = ΔID/ΔVG) of the PEDOT:PSS channel shows that there was a decrease in source-drain current (ID). The designed gate electrode captures targeted Na+ and K+ ions and generated current proportional to cation concentration.

4. Optoelectronic devices
4.1 NIR sensing organic photo transistor/OLED
An era of flexible and wearable electronic devices influenced the researchers to develop such devices form different inorganic and organic platforms. It is well known that inorganic materials are heavy and rigid. Hence researchers switched their attention to organic molecules, as it is reliable for the existing need of opto-electronic devices. Chemical tunability of mechanical properties of CPs makes them extensively applicable for the fabrication of stretchable electronic devices. In fact, the tunable behavior caused a structural distortion without causing disturbance to the function of the electronic device.
In 2018 Han and Lee coated poly[{2,5-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-bis-(thien-2-yl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diyl}-co-{2,2′-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)]-5,5′-diyl}] (PEHTPPD) on the source ITO electrode89 which is a NIR gate sensing layer, and another P3HT (organic-photo transistor) channel layer over PEHTPPD; this channel layer simply plays an effective signal transfer role between PEHTPPD-BT and drain Ag electrode. PEHTPPD-BT was inserted between poly(methyl methacrylate) GIL and ITO (Fig. 35). In darkness, irrespective of the thickness of PEHTPPD-BT P44 acted as a p-type transistor; notably drain current decreased with an increase in thickness; lower drain current was ascribed to the decreased capacitance of the PEHTPPD-P3HT/PMMA layer but the hole mobility was rather slightly increased. No photocurrent was measured with a GSL thickness ranging from t = 0 to t = 70.
 Fig. 35  (A) Illustration of the NIR-sensing transistor device with a GS layer. (B) Diagrammatic comparison of phototransistors with and without a shadow mask. (C) Chemical structure of the polymer P3HT, PMMA, and PEHTPPD-BT (P44). Reproduced from ref. 89 with permission from [John Wiley and Sons], copyright [2018]. 
PEHTPPD-BT can absorb NIR up to 110 nm; it was clear that the drain current increased upon irradiation of both visible light and NIR at wavelengths of 555, 780, and 1000 nm respectively. Regardless of the incident light wavelength, Rc/M values (VD = 60 V) were achieved at t = 80 nm for a polymer layer. A relatively lower responsivity was observed for the layer thickness smaller or greater than the thickness t = 80 nm. At low PIN, the masked polymer layer of the transistor shows higher responsivity of 0.42 A W−1, 0.34 A W−1, and 0.25 A W−1 with the incident light wavelength of 550 nm, 780 nm and 1000 nm respectively. This was compared with conventional inorganic photodiodes; Rc/M was lower with low PIN for conventional NIR sensors.
5. Bio-medical applications
5.1 Bio mimicking
First ever in the history of bio mimicking a membrane protein was completely stabilized on a lipid mimic bilayer generated using a block copolymer and conjugated electrolytes (BCP-COEs). Patrick O. Saboe et al.90 developed a lipid mimic bilayer from a block copolymer poly(butadiene)12-poly(ethylene oxide)8 (PB12-PEO8) (P45) (Fig. 36) and it was intercalated with conjugated oligo electrolytes, 4,40-bis(40-(N,N-bis(600-(N,N,N-trimethylammonium)hexyl)amino)-styryl)stilbene tetraiodide (DSSN+). In a near-native hydrophobic condition PSI was stabilized by a combined bilayer of DSSN+ and a block copolymer. The PEO block is a hydrophilic block of BCP, hydrated with water to intercalate with amino acids present near the membrane interface. Thus, the composite conductive polymer interface was generated; the hydrophobic end of the BCP stabilizes the COE and protein surface. In water medium a self-built planar and extended membrane was generated due to a hydrophobic interaction between the membrane protein and block copolymer (Fig. 36). An intercalated two-dimensional membrane on the gold enables the mimic layer for the productive electron move to the proteins, which resulted in huge photocurrent generation. When illuminating in the photosynthetically active region (PAR), the photocurrent generation was found to be 35.0 ± 3.5 μA cm−2. The photo current generated was twice the current produced with a membrane protein (PSI) and lipid crystals on to the surface of conjugated electrolyte and lipid bilayers.

5.2 Anti-bacterial activity
In this most uncertain environment, living organisms are prone to numerous bacterial, fungal and viral infections. Numerous irresistible microbes are dangerous even at very minimal concentrations. Hence, the detection, approximation and elimination of pathogenic microbes are profoundly significant for controlling lethal diseases. Traditional methods involved plate counting by means of the PCR method. But it has various drawbacks like requirement of sophisticated equipment, being labor intensive and time-consuming processes. In order to overcome these drawbacks, a novel fluorescent detector has been developed by the researchers in the recent past. Since conjugated polymers are well known for their extended conjugated π systems they are capable of producing magnificent fluorescence upon irradiation of EM radiations.
With these two notions, Wang et al.91 synthesized three different polymers like PFBTDBT, PFDBT, and PFDBT-BIMEG (P46) (Fig. 37). All these polymers were tested for their ability to act as an anti-bacterial agent. At the end of all the preliminary investigations PFDBT-BIMEG fulfilled the criteria for being a good anti-bacterial agent. One, weak FRET from the polyfluorene backbone to DBT happened because of complete solubility of BIMEG side chains in water; two, efficiency in producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a longer lifetime of the triplet exciton state; three, enhanced fluorescent signal when introduced onto the bacterial surface; finally, PFBDT-BIMEG is highly non-biocompatible. The properties of P46 were enhanced by introducing plasmonic Ag-NPs, which in turn induced a MEF effect in the conjugated polymer. The intermediate (PLL/PAA)/PLL-g-PEG layer acts as a spacer layer between the P46 and Ag-NP substrate, allowing the fluorescence enhancement of CPs to be optimized. In addition to the fluorescence enhancement at 427 nm, the fluorescence intensity of P38 at 663 nm showed a 3.5 times enhancement caused by FRET on the Ag/intermediate layer platform (Fig. 38). P46 along with Ag/intermediate layer was exposed to E. coli bacteria; with an increase in the concentration of bacteria from 5 × 105 to 1 × 108 CFU, FRET at (I427nm/I663nm) also increased. Ag-NPs increased the ROS generation. Colony counting showed that Ag/intermediate layer/P46 seemed to have the highest bacterial killing performance, with 99 percent after irradiation and 13 percent in the dark.

5.3 Drug delivery systems
The drug delivery process is the crucial and preliminary procedure in a bio-medical application. The molecule or a moiety employed for drug delivery should be highly biocompatible, targeted and selective and stable even in a rarified environment. The construction of drug delivery systems has various challenges like stability when exposed to near infra-red radiation/heating, bio compatibility, adaptability to microenvironments, and null effect on cell necrosis. For more than a decade polydopamine was considered to be an excellent drug delivery system for various treatments of disease. In early 2018 Nakatsuka and coworkers92 worked on the efficacy of polyserotonin as a potential alternative to PDA in view of developing a future drug delivery system in bio-medical applications. Before entering into the clinical trial, a system should be tested in vivo and several aspects need to be fulfilled. The efficacy of polyserotonin (P47) has been compared with that of polydopamine (PDA). Elimination of protein corona93 was considered to be the foremost characteristic for a good delivery system. Notable proteins like fibrinogen and serum albumin form corona with the nano particle; however, this research group coated the nano particle with a hydrophilic polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), to eliminate the formation of protein corona. The PEGylation of nano particles reduces the protein absorption by 85%.
Human serotonin was incubated with PEGylated polyserotonin for 72 hrs in standard MTT assay for identifying cell viability (Fig. 39). PEGylated polyserotonin showed lower cytotoxicity than PDA. Mild photothermal heating at approximately 45 °C of nano particles is required for an improved cancer treatment. Near infra-red drug carriers have been successfully developed; the nanoparticle loaded with commonly used doxorubicin (DOX) (anticancer chemotherapeutic drug) remains stable even after heating. Computational studies and molecular dynamics simulation study investigated and revealed that the hydrogen bonding played a crucial role in the absorption of DOX on to the polyserotonin surface. Later DOX loaded nanoparticles were deployed in the microenvironment having Hela cells. The targeted delivery of DOX took place and viability of HeLa cells decreased.

5.4 Biosensors
The construction of non-adherence or non-receptor molecules is the most important thing in the fabrication of bio sensors. A small interaction with substances like serum protein, hemoglobin, biliverdin, glucose, cholesterol, and metal ions might disturb the entire process of sensing application. Despite the successful laboratory sensing of bio molecules, a clinical trial will completely ruin even a small interaction with intriguing substances like serum protein, endocrine secretion like hormones, fluids, etc. Hence a multiple trial is required to choose a non-interactive molecule for the bio-sensing application.
Senthil Kumar and Asha94 developed a serum protein nonreceptor polymer for the detection of bilirubin in human serum. Basically a polymer is made of multiple fluorene (PF) with appended D-glucuronic acid (PF-Ph-GlcA) (P48). Human serum with added free bilirubin was maintained at pH = 10 to provide a basic medium for the detection of bilirubin. Upon irradiation direct excitation at 455 nm occurred in accordance with sharp emission from bilirubin at 520 nm. The polymer exhibited a commendable energy transfer (FRET) (Fig. 40) from the polymer to bilirubin due to a spectral overlap between bilirubin and P4 and a non-covalent interaction too happened; both resulted in quenching of blue fluorescence of the polymer PF-Ph-GlcA when bilirubin was added; along with that a concurrent light green emission from bilirubin was observed.
 Fig. 40  Mechanism of FRET-induced sensing of bilirubin (P48). 
Fluorescence responses of the sensing system to the telomerase were extracted from different bladder cancer patients and healthy samples (P10). Concentration of CP-c-Ts was taken as 250 nM. The same probe is involved in both signal on and signal off fluorescence for Hg2+ and telomerase sensing (Fig. 6). The aggregation state is tuned simply by changing the relative content of DNA (telomerase) in a bipolar probe. At lower concentration of DNA, the hydrophobic behavior of the bipolar probe is high; it favored the aggregation of the hydrophobic CP core and a low fluorescence signal was observed due to the ACQ effect. In contrast, at high concentration of DNA, hydrophilic behavior of the bipolar probe is high. The aggregation of the hydrophobic CP core is destabilized and a high fluorescence signal was observed due to the opposite effect of ACQ (Fig. 6), hence acting as a signal on fluorescence sensors for telomerase.
Adenine and guanosine nucleoside sensors have been developed by Isao Yamaguchi and coworkers.95 A newly synthesized π-conjugated polymer (P49a and P49b) (Fig. 41) using palladium complex catalyst consists of 9,9-dihexylfluorene-2,7-diyl and alloxazine-6,9-diyl units. The photoluminescence (PL) gradually decreased with the addition of nucleosides adenine and guanosine which is most likely caused by FRET from the excited polymer to the formed complex as a result of hydrogen bonding between the alloxazine unit of the polymer and the nucleoside. Stern–Volmer constant of the polymers KSV(A) = 0.8 × 103 M−1 and KSV(G) = 7.4 × 103 M−1 confirmed the mechanism of sensing of nucleosides.

6. Conclusion and future perspectives
In this review, a comprehensive overview of the recent utilization of conjugated polymers in photophysical, electrochemical, optoelectronic and biomedical applications has been outlined. In a nutshell mechanisms involved in each application are demonstrated. The distinct examples under each title implied that the polymeric probe has tunable fine optical and electronic properties. Even, a simple monomer with the varying side chain is effective in a variety of applications. Conjugated polymers are extensively utilized in fluorescent application just by altering the backbone of a polymer to make it a donor acceptor probe. In this review article it is obviously seen that the polymers with fluorene, carbazole, and phenylene vinylene monomers were found to be versatile probes in developing a turn-on/turn off fluorescence sensors, portable electro chemical picric acid sensors and in drug delivery systems as well as anti-microbial agents.
It is obvious that conjugated polymers have been used for making flexible opto-electronic devices and photo transistors because of their softness, durability and less weight but explored less in making a portable electrochemical sensor and in electrochemical applications. Thus, the tunable properties of polymers, like optimization of band gap, can be well utilized in electrochemical applications. Moreover, although some conjugated frameworks have been used for delivering drugs like doxorubicin and bio imaging, their biological applications are still in the initial stage of exploration. Some important aspects ought to be considered while designing these materials, such as bio availability, bio compatibility, solubility in aqueous and biological environments and reduced cytotoxicity.
Despite several applications, polymer moieties have leading challenges in terms of stability, sensitivity, identification, durability, real sample investigations and waste water treatment. In the line of such challenges recent trends in development of nano-composite based surface adsorption techniques for detection96 and removal of toxic substances97 will give threshold to the researchers in exploring the conjugated polymers in a more versatile application. Noticeably more explorations are expected to access the capability of robust conjugated polymers in future. Thus, conjugated polymers will be a hot research topic in the future world of flexible electronic gadgets, detection and removal of toxic substances and in medical applications.
