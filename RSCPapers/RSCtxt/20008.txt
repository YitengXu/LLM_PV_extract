    , Accepted 29th January 2014First published on 29th January 2014AbstractIndium oxide (In2O3) is an important wide band-gap semiconductor having applications in a variety of optoelectronic devices. We report here on the low temperature solution deposition of In(OH)3 and In(SO4)(OH)·H2O architectures with various shapes such as cubes, maize corns and giant crystals. The In2O3 nanostructures are then obtained by solid state transformation of In(OH)3 and In(SO4)(OH)·H2O architectures. Shape control is achieved by controlling the local concentration of In3+ ions available for reaction by applying the principles of coordination chemistry, thereby obviating the need of any shape controlling agents. The phase and surface composition is obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The XPS is used to probe the defect structure of In2O3 architecture. Optical properties of the films, studied by UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements, show that the different morphologies have different band-gaps. Furthermore current–voltage characteristics of In2O3–CdSe photoelectrochemical cells are studied, which show that cube–CdSe samples display excellent photovoltaic behaviour, exhibiting a short circuit current density in excess of 10 mA cm−2. The charge transport properties of the In2O3–CdSe photoanodes are studied by impedance spectroscopy, which shows that cube–CdSe samples have lowest resistance to charge transfer.
Introduction
Semiconductor nanostructures have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their exceptional properties compared to their bulk counterparts and their application in optoelectronics.1 In2O3 is one such semiconductor having a band-gap of about 3 eV. It has unique optical, chemical and electrical properties and is used in a variety of applications like batteries, thin film infrared reflectors transparent to visible light (hot mirrors), non-linear optics, nanoelectronics, gas sensing, biosensing, photoelectrochemical cells and antistatic coatings.2 In combination with tin dioxide, indium oxide forms indium–tin-oxide (also called tin-doped indium oxide or ITO), a material used for transparent conductive coatings. The physico-chemical properties of nanocrystalline semiconductors depend strongly on their morphology. Various methods employed for fabricating indium oxide nanostructures include electrodeposition, chemical bath deposition, chemical vapor deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, hydrothermal, sol–gel synthesis method etc.3 Among these methods, chemical deposition is the simplest and low cost method with a simple setup for deposition. In wet chemical synthesis, for controlling the shape of nanocrystals, a variety of shape controlling agents are used such as, complexing agents, surfactants and pH regulating agents. All these additives make the synthesis method complicated and costly. Furthermore these additives can act as impurities, thereby lowering the performance of the device in which they are employed. In2O3 nano/micro-structures with different morphologies like nanorods, cubes, donuts, spheres, porous microspheres, nanoplates, nanorhombohedra, flowers, etc. have been synthesized by various methods.3 Some reports have shown that catalytic, gas sensing and photoelectrochemical properties have strong dependence on the morphology and electronic defect structure of In2O3.2f,4 Wide band-gap oxides like TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, etc. have been extensively studied for their application in dye and semiconductor sensitized solar cells.1a,5 However, despite favorable band positions, ideal band-gap and stability in a wide range of electrolytes, reports on successful photosensitization of In2O3 are rare.6 Therefore, controlling the morphology and defect structure remains a key issue in developing high performance photoelectrochemical cells using In2O3. To address this, we report here a soft chemical strategy for shape controlled synthesis of indium hydroxide/sulfate hydroxide hydrate architecture, without using any morphology controlling agents. By applying the principles of co-ordination chemistry and using Pearson's acid–base concept as a guiding principle, we were able to synthesize three different morphologies viz. cubes, maize corns and crystals. Furthermore, these architectures were transformed into In2O3 architectures (Scheme 1). These architectures were then sensitized with CdSe nanoparticles to form In2O3–CdSe heterostructures, which were utilized in photoelectrochemical cells. A photocurrent in excess of 10 mA cm−2 was obtained with cube–CdSe photoelectrochemical cells under 1 Sun illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on chemical solution deposition of In2O3 on conducting substrates with different morphologies and highest performance obtained using In2O3 as transparent n-type oxide in sensitized solar cells.
 Scheme 1  A schematic representation of the reaction between various indium ion precursors like In(NO3)3, InCl3, In2(SO4)3 and urea in an aqueous medium. The In(NO3)3 and InCl3, upon reaction with urea, form In(OH)3 cubes and maize corns respectively while, indium sulphate forms micron sized crystals of In(SO4)(OH)·H2O. On annealing in air at 400 °C, these architectures get transformed into In2O3. 
Experimental
All the reagents used in this experiment were of the analytical grade, obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. and used without further purification. The FTO coated glass slides (7.5 × 2.5 cm2) used for the deposition were cleaned successively with detergent, isopropanol and acetone ultrasonically and finally dried with a stream of air. In a typical experiment, 0.1 M each of indium nitrate, indium chloride and indium sulphate were separately dissolved in 25 mL of deionized water in falcon tubes of 50 mL capacity. To each of these solutions, 25 mL of 0.3 M urea solution was added. The tubes were then sealed and kept in a water bath maintained at 80 °C. After completion of reaction (evidenced by white deposits on the walls of tubes) after 12 h, the tubes were taken out of the bath, allowed to cool and the films covered with a white coating of indium hydroxide/sulphate hydroxide hydrate were washed with water, dried in a stream of air and stored for further characterizations.
In2O3 architectures were obtained by annealing the samples in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 30 min. After annealing, the colour of the sample changed from white to faint yellow, indicating the formation of In2O3. For photoelectrochemical cells, the CdSe was deposited onto In2O3 architectures by chemical bath deposition. The deposition bath consisted of 80 mM cadmium sulphate, 90 mM nitrotriacetic acid disodium salt, and 80 mM sodium selenosulfate solution. The In2O3 architectures on FTO were dipped in the deposition solution and kept at 40 °C in a water bath for 3 h. The films coated with CdSe nanoparticles were then taken out, washed with deionized water, dried in a stream of air and annealed in air at 250 °C for 30 min.
The crystal structure and phase of the architectures were confirmed using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/MAX 2500 V, Cu Kα, λ = 0.15418 nm). The morphology of the architectures was monitored using a field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4200). UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a spectrophotometer (CARY 100 conc-EL04073168) with another identical reference FTO substrate. XPS spectra were obtained using a twin Mg Kα source at a chamber base pressure of ∼10−10 Torr. In order to measure the solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency, In2O3–CdSe heterostructures on FTO were incorporated into a thin layer of sandwich-type cells with a Pt-coated FTO as the counter electrode (obtained by sputtering), using a spacer film (50 μm thick polyester film) and an electrolyte, 0.1 M polysulfide. Cell performance was measured by irradiation with 100 mW cm−2 white light (1 Sun) with air mass (AM) 0 and 1.5 filters as a solar simulator in the presence of a water filter (450 W xenon lamp, Oriel Instruments). Impedance spectra of the same cells were measured with an IVIUM Compactstat impedance analyser, under open circuit conditions. The AC frequency range was 0.1 to 106 Hz with a sinusoidal amplitude of 50 mV. Impedance parameters were obtained by fitting the obtained curves using Z-view software. Photoelectrochemical properties of pristine In2O3 electrodes were measured in a three electrode cell using In2O3 coated FTO as working, Ag/AgCl(3 M NaCl) as reference and platinum wire as counter electrodes. The working electrode was contacted with a copper back-plate and then pressed against an O-ring in the base of an electrochemical cell, leaving an area of 0.38 cm2 exposed to the electrolyte. The electrolyte was a 1 M NaOH solution in deionized water. The samples were then illuminated with simulated 1 Sun radiation through the electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammograms were measured using an Ivium compactstat, at a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
Pearson's acid–base concept classifies metal ions and ligands into hard and soft categories.7 Hard acids prefer to bind to hard bases and vice-versa. We utilized this concept in the present study to control the shape of the nanoarchitectures. We chose three different In3+ ion precursors, viz. In(NO3)3, InCl3 and In2(SO4)3. In the present case, the basicity of ligands is in the order of Cl− > SO42− > NO3− while In3+ ions are a hard acid. Thus, it is clear that, In3+ ions will bind more preferentially to Cl− ions and less with NO3− ions; while intermediately to SO42− ions. This factor will in turn affect the local concentration of In3+ ions available for the reaction, which consequently will be the shape determining factor for indium oxide architectures. Complexing agents or surfactants used for shape control of nanostructures play a similar role of controlling the local concentration of metal ions or anions available for the reaction. Thus implying the principles of co-ordination chemistry one can control the shape of the nanoarchitectures, thereby obviating the need of any complexing agents or surfactants. Urea was used as the source of hydroxide ions in the present study, which decomposes slowly in aqueous solution at higher temperature to produce hydroxide ions according to the following reaction NH2CONH2 + 3H2O → 2NH4OH + CO2(1)
These formed hydroxide ions then react with the In3+ ions in the solution to produce different architectures according to the mechanism discussed above. The possible reaction mechanism leading to the formation of different architectures with different In3+ ions precursors can be given as below: InCl3 + 3OH− → In(OH)3 + 3Cl−(2) In(NO3)3 + 3OH− → In(OH)3 + 3NO3−(3) In2(SO4)3 + OH− + H2O → 2In(SO4)(OH)·H2O + SO4−(4)
The hydroxide ions formed by hydrolysis of the urea at high temperature react with the indium ions to precipitate indium hydroxide architectures in the case of indium nitrate and chloride, whereas, in the case of indium sulphate, indium sulphate hydroxide hydrate is produced. It has been proven that, indium exists as a sulfato complex in aqueous indium sulphate solutions. Digital photo images of the samples formed on FTO substrates are shown in the inset of Fig. 1. Fairly uniform deposits can be confirmed from the image. The XRD patterns of the indium hydroxide and sulphate hydroxide hydrate products are shown in Fig. 1. The diffraction patterns of the products synthesized from indium nitrate termed as N and chloride termed as C precursors match with the body-centered cubic (bcc) In(OH)3 with a lattice constant a = 7.979 Å (JCPDS card no. 85-1338), while those synthesized from indium sulfate termed as S match with In(SO4)(OH)·H2O with a lattice constant a = 6.058 (JCPDS card no. 14-0608). The sharp diffraction patterns in the case of N, as compared to C products, indicate higher crystallinity of the former, which was further confirmed from SEM measurements. The S products also have strong reflection peaks indicating high crystallinity. SEM images of the products are shown in Fig. 2. Cuboids of edge lengths of 2–8 microns corresponding to sample N can be seen in the image A. The angle between adjacent edges appears close to 90°, consistent with the cubic shape. These cuboids are packed well in the film form and look well interconnected to each other. This can be beneficial in a sense that many applications, including solar cells, sensors, supercapacitors, etc., need the material in a thin film form with good interconnectivity and conductivity. Furthermore, cubic particles expose a specific surface, which provides an ideal model for the study of surface related properties. Qiu et al. reported the fabrication of cubic particles of indium hydroxide by the hydrothermal route using sodium borohydride and polyvinyl pyrrolidone.8 Our method produces the particles directly on the conducting glass substrates at relatively low temperatures without the use of any surfactant. Maize corn like structures can be seen in the case of sample C, which we can assume, are formed from many small nanorods joined together. These structures are 1–2 microns in length, while the diameters range from 100 to 150 nm on the top to 500–600 nm in the middle (body). Some structures seem to grow from the body of other substrates, while others grow from FTO substrates. In the case of sample S, large crystals of 80–90 μm dimensions can be seen. Additional low resolution SEM images of the samples are shown in Fig. S1.† In a further experiment, we transformed the above architectures into indium oxide architectures by thermal annealing at 400 °C. As reported in the literature, indium hydroxide undergoes solid state transformation to indium oxide, upon annealing at 400 °C.8 Upon annealing, all the films changed the color from white to faint yellow, indicating the formation of indium oxide. This was further confirmed from XRD measurements (Fig. 3). After annealing, all the samples showed reflections corresponding to the cubic phase of indium oxide with a lattice constant of a = 10.11 Å, consistent with the JCPDS card no. 71-2194. The intensity of the reflection peaks was highest in the case of cube samples, as compared with corn and particle samples. The cube and corn samples retain the high crystallinity even after annealing and transformation to indium oxide. Thus, after conversion to indium oxide, the indium hydroxide particles maintain the crystallinity order. In the case of indium sulfate hydroxide hydrate particles, after annealing, the reflection peaks become much weaker, which is attributed to formation of nanoparticles of small size (explained later in the text) by complete destruction of original crystals. The chemical equations for solid state transformation can be given as below, 2In(OH)3 → In2O3 + 3H2O(5) 2In(SO4)(OH)·H2O → In2O3 + 3H2O + 2SO3(6)

The SEM images of indium oxide products formed after the solid state transformation process are shown in Fig. 4. In the case of cubes, the original morphology is retained after annealing; but some cracks are formed in the centre of the crystals, possibly due to evolution of H2O and accompanying weight loss. However, the particles retain the film topography and crystallinity as described above. A different phenomenon is observed in the case of maize corn particles where shrinking of the maize corns can be seen by annealing and no cracks were observed in the single corns. This indicates substantially different arrangement of nanorod building blocks to form corn particles. The indium sulphate hydroxide hydrate crystals were transformed into ultrafine indium oxide particles after thermal treatment. The particles look uniform and are 30–40 nm in size. (See Fig. S2† for low resolution images.)

We further carried out XPS analysis to analyze the chemical state of elements and electronic defect structure in indium oxide architectures. The In 3d core level spectra of cube, corn and particle samples are shown in Fig. 5a–c. The spectra are split into spin–orbit doublets (3d5/2 and 3d3/2). This suggests that the valency of indium in the compounds is mainly 3+.9 Also the spectra of the different samples look nearly identical, indicating the identical nature of In3+ in all the three samples. Fig. 5d–f show O1S core-level spectra of the various indium oxide samples. It is clear from the figure that there are two peaks in each of the spectrum, located at 529.44 and 531.2 eV. The peak at 531.2 is shifted to 531.8 for the particle samples. The peak at 529.44 eV corresponds to oxygen bonds in In–O–In while the one at 531.2 is related to oxygen vacancies in the bulk of metal oxide.9,2f For all the samples, the relative intensities of the two O1S peaks are significantly different. Especially, for the particle samples, the intensity of the peak due to oxygen vacancies (531.8 eV) is overwhelmingly high, indicating large number of oxygen vacancies. For cube and corn samples, the ratios of the intensities are 1.38 and 1.30 respectively and that for particle samples is 0.59. This factor has a significant effect on photoelectrochemical properties, which is described later in the text.

The optical properties of indium oxide films were studied with Uv-Vis absorption spectroscopy. The Uv-vis spectra of the films are shown in Fig. 6a. The structureless absorption spectra, as observed here, are often encountered in nanostructured films due to size distribution of the particles constituting the film. This causes smearing of the absorption bands near the band-gap energy. Another important reason is the strong electronic coupling in well-interconnected particles.10 All the three samples show different absorption spectra possibly due to the presence of different oxygen vacancies in cubes, maize corns and particles. The band-gaps calculated from the graph in Fig. 6b are 2.84, 2.97 and 3.29 eV for cubes, maize corns and particulate films, respectively. The considerable difference in band-gap energy can be explained on the basis of the interfacial polaron effect arising from the electron–photon coupling. This effect is favourable for the formation of self-trapped excitons from the free excitons attributed to the coexistence of rich oxygen vacancies among the gap.4b,11

The red shift in absorption spectra of cubes and maize corn particles could be explained by the shape prevailing effect over the quantum size effect. A similar phenomenon was observed in the case of CeO2 particles.11b The direct band-gap of In2O3 is somewhat controversial, and is reported between 2.3 and 3.8 eV. Many studies have reported the direct gap of 3.75 eV.12 Whereas, Walsh et al. have reported the band-gap energy of 2.9 eV on the basis of first principle calculations and X-ray spectroscopy.13 Our group has reported a direct band-gap of 3.05 eV for electrodeposited In2O3 spheres,3a while Chen et al. reported a band-gap of 2.58 eV for In2O3 nanoparticles.14
Photoluminescence spectra of indium oxide cubes, maize corns and particles are shown in Fig. 7. All the three samples show weak emission peaks at 410 and 460 nm with varying intensities. These peaks have commonly been attributed to different sub band-gap energy levels of oxygen vacancies where the electron in the vacancy combines with the hole to emit a photon of corresponding energy.15 Also the position of the emission peaks, normally reported in the literature, ranges from 360–640 nm, strongly dependent on the preparation methods.16 Nanocubes prepared by the electrodeposition method exhibited strong blue emission centered at 405 nm, attributed to singly ionized oxygen vacancies.2f In2O3 prepared by wet chemical methods exhibit emission peaks between 400 and 500 nm consistent with our results (Fig. 7).4a,16b

Despite favorable band-edge positions, wide band-gaps and higher lifetime of injected photoelectrons, there are very few reports on the photosensitization of In2O3 and its successful utilization in photoelectrochemical cells.6 Motivated by this fact, we decided to photosensitize In2O3 with CdSe, a prototypical semiconductor widely used as a sensitizer in semiconductor sensitized solar cells. In2O3 cubes, maize corns and particles were coated uniformly with CdSe nanoparticles using the chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique. For this purpose, our previously described recipe, which yielded excellent results with photosensitization of ZnO, was used.5b Also the results were relatively more reproducible as compared to those of the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. Nitroltriacetic acid provided consistent results (conformal coating of CdSe), when used as a complexing agent instead of commonly used ammonia. For deposition, the films with cubes, maize corns and particles were dipped in a deposition solution, as described in the Experimental section. After 2.5 h of deposition, the films changed color from faint yellow to blood red indicating the uniform coating of In2O3 by CdSe particles. We note that this deposition time is optimum for obtaining the best photosensitization results. The films were then annealed at 250 °C for 30 min in ambient air, in order to improve the adhesion between In2O3–CdSe layers. The films changed color from blood red to dark brown after annealing, due to the quantum confinement effect, arising from increase in crystallite size of CdSe. We found that annealing step is necessary for improvement of photoelectrochemical properties. Uv-vis spectra of indium oxide films after CdSe deposition are shown in Fig. 6c. It is clear from the figures that, after deposition, all the films show improved light absorption starting at ∼700 nm, corresponding to the absorption range of CdSe nanoparticles. It can also be seen that particle–CdSe films have lowest absorption of all. This is due to lower loading of CdSe on particulate films. This can be explained on the basis of the fact that surface bonding characteristics and morphology can have significant effects on loading of CdSe particles, as we have observed previously for chemically deposited TiO2, SnO2 and ZnO, nanostructures.5b SEM images of the samples after CdSe coating and annealing step are shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that all the three samples – cubes, maize corns and particles – are uniformly coated with CdSe nanoparticles. In the case of maize corns, a well defined core–shell structure of In2O3–CdSe is formed, while the particle samples are uniformly coated with CdSe with some aggregation.

We further measured photoelectrochemical properties of these composite films using Pt-FTO as the counter electrode and polysulfide as the redox electrolyte, as described in detail in the Experimental section. Fig. 9a shows the current–voltage plots for three systems, obtained under simulated 1 Sun illumination. Cube–CdSe films showed highest short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit potential (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) values (Table 1). The particulate–CdSe films showed lower values of these photovoltaic parameters, while corn–CdSe films showed intermediate values. Photocurrent action spectra of the three electrodes, sensitized with CdSe, are shown in Fig. 9b. The onset of photocurrent for all the samples is around 700 nm, corresponding to a band-gap energy of 1.77 eV. This agrees well with the band-gap of CdSe reported in the literature and also indicates that the CdSe particles deposited on various In2O3 morphologies have nearly the same size.17 This is considerably different from our previous report regarding the ZnO–CdSe system, where the onset of photocurrent was around 750 nm, corresponding to a band-gap energy of 1.66 eV.5b This observation points out that, there is substantial difference between growth of CdSe nanoparticles onto different semiconducting oxides. Also, there is drastic difference between the photocurrent action spectra at ∼400 nm of ZnO–CdSe and In2O3–CdSe systems presented here. In the case of the latter, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) value at ∼400 nm is higher than that of the former system, where this value declined at the said wavelength. This is possibly due to contribution of In2O3 to the overall photocurrent in the case of the In2O3–CdSe system. The drastic difference between the photovoltaic parameters of different In2O3 samples is obvious and can be readily explained on the basis of morphological difference, oxygen vacancies and interparticle connectivity, which in turn affect the charge transport properties. It is a well known fact that, intrinsically, In2O3 is an insulator and its semiconducting character depends mainly on the defect structure (oxygen vacancies). In the present case, as determined from XPS measurements, In2O3 nanoparticles have the highest number of oxygen vacancies, while this number is nearly similar in cubes and corns. These vacancies act as shallow donors near the conduction band, which increases conductivity and carrier concentration. However, a large number of these vacancies can act as traps and recombination centers.2f This fact is also reflected in photoelectrochemical measurements of pristine In2O3 samples, in a three electrode cell containing In2O3 on FTO as working, Pt as counter and Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) as reference electrodes (Fig. S3†). The electrolyte solution was 1 M NaOH. From such measurement, it is possible to study the properties of pristine In2O3 electrodes as the photocurrent generated solely depends on the nature of the photoanode and is independent of the quality and catalytic activity of the counter electrode. From the figure, it is clear that cube samples show maximum photocurrent (170 μA cm−2 at 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl) followed by corn samples (135 μA cm−2). Particle samples show the lowest photocurrent of 28 μA cm−2 at 0.1 V. This indicates that charge generation, separation and transport are efficient in cube samples as compared to those in maize corn and particle samples. To probe this, we performed impedance spectroscopy measurements on the three samples sensitized with CdSe. Samples for impedance measurements were same as those used in photovoltaic performance measurements. Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plots of the cells obtained by fitting the original data using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset. An impedance spectrum of semiconductor sensitized solar cells shows two semicircles; one in the high frequency region corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (R1) between counter electrode and electrolyte (Pt–polysulfide) and the other in the low frequency range corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (R2) in the photoanode (In2O3–CdSe).1c,5b The size of the second semicircle (the value of R2) is mainly an important factor affecting the photovoltaic parameters, as the factors affecting the R1 are similar in all the samples. Large differences between the R2 values can be seen for the cube, corn and particle samples. The cube samples exhibited the smallest R2 value (∼291 ohm) while particle samples showed the highest value (∼885 ohm). The lower value of R2 means that the photogenerated electrons can easily travel through the photoanode and are collected at FTO with much fewer chances of recombination. The cube and corn samples show a similar nature of oxygen vacancies and consequently similar electronic structures; however the maize corn samples show high resistance to charge transfer (∼568.25 ohm). This can be explained on the basis of the fact that the charge transfer through the photoanode is affected by interparticle connectivity (grain boundaries) and electronic structure of the transparent oxide. It is clear from the SEM images that the cubes are relatively in more intimate contact with each other, as compared to the corns; thus electrons flowing through the corn samples may undergo several events of recombination. The highest R2 value in the case of a particle sample may be due to combined effects of the large number of oxygen vacancies (acting as recombination centers) and lack of interparticle connectivity. The electron lifetime in the composite films (τr) can be estimated from maximum frequency of the mid-frequency peak, according to the relationship τr = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency of the mid-frequency peak. The fmax values for cube–CdSe, corn–CdSe and particle–CdSe films are 0.15, 0.25 and 0.39 Hz respectively, which indicate that the cube–CdSe composite has relatively higher electron lifetime than the other two composites. This is in line with the photovoltaic performance data. The photovoltaic performance values obtained in this study (in the case of cubes and corn samples) are far better than those reported in the literature (Table 2). This underlines the importance of careful materials engineering of the morphology and electronic structure of this important n-type oxide. The photovoltaic performance with CdSe sensitization is still lower as compared to that with TiO2, SnO2 and ZnO based devices. Especially Voc and FF are on the lower side, while Jsc is comparable. Careful interface engineering of the In2O3 based devices, as has been previously done in the case of other oxides, will certainly improve the photoconversion efficiencies.

Conclusions
Three different morphologies of indium oxide viz. cubes, maize corns and particles have been fabricated by a soft solution strategy. XPS data show that particles contain the highest number of oxygen vacancies, which are detrimental for the charge transport. After CdSe sensitization, cube samples showed highest photovoltaic performance, due to the presence of an optimum number of oxygen vacancies and good interparticle connectivity, which facilitate charge transport through the photoanode. Photocurrent action spectra reveal that CdSe sensitized samples start generating photocurrent at 700 nm continuing up to 300 nm and In2O3 also contributes to the overall photocurrent. The results also underline the importance of tuning the band-gaps, trap states and electronic structure of the transparent oxide. The low temperature and surfactant free method employed here, for direct deposition of In2O3 on transparent conducting substrates, is scalable for large area deposition and can be used for commercial applications. Furthermore, simply applying the principles of Persons theory, one can tune the morphologies of the formed products obviating the need of any shape directing agents. The highest photovoltaic performance obtained here for In2O3 based anodes will certainly boost the studies in the area of this otherwise unexplored semiconductor in the photoelectrochemical field. Further work is underway in our lab to control the electronic properties of In2O3 by controlling the defect structure and developing the low cost deposition methods to facilitate its use in high performance photoelectrochemical cells.
