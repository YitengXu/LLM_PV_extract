    , Accepted 15th May 2020First published on 15th May 2020AbstractAlthough the significance of charge diffusion has been recognized in many high-performance energy devices, it has received very less attention in the design of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is particularly crucial for highly active but less conductive OER electrocatalysts, such as two-dimensional metal hydroxides (MHs) with anisotropic conductivity. Herein, we report the elaborate design of a series of CoFe hydroxide nanosheets on graphene (CFH@G) composites to demonstrate the importance of charge diffusion regulation in improving the OER activity of MHs. It was discovered that the few-layer-thick CFH nanosheets lying on the graphene substrate provided an effective in-plane charge diffusion pathway, while keeping the substrate surface entirely covered by the laid nanosheets is necessary for providing sufficient active sites. The overly thick or stacked nanosheets are not favourable for charge diffusion, especially at large current outputs. By regulating the charge diffusion properties, the best-performing CFH@G-based material can deliver a steady OER current density of 2000 mA cm−2 at a cost of only 1.507 V under near-industrial conditions (6 M KOH and 60 °C). A practical water electrolyzer also demonstrated an impressive current output of 400 mA cm−2 at 1.694 V as well as a steady solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 17.41%. These findings provide new insights into the role of charge diffusion in water oxidation and may open up an avenue for developing low-cost, stable and efficient electrocatalysts for practical water electrolysis and diverse energy devices.
Introduction
Electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production shows great promise for clean energy conversion and storage.1–4 However, the efficiency is greatly hindered by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its sluggish multiple proton-coupled electron transfer processes.5–8 Although the Ir/Ru-based materials are recognized as the most efficient OER catalysts, their wide application is significantly limited by their high cost and low natural abundance. Additionally, their long-term stability falls far short for the market need.9–11 In the past decades, tremendous efforts have been made in the search for cost-effective catalysts for OER by using earth-abundant materials and developing economical synthetic routes.12,13
Generally, high-performance catalysts require a large number of highly active intrinsic sites and rapid charge/mass transport during the reaction.14–16 The significance of charge transport has been well recognized in diverse energy conversion and storage devices such as Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells.14,17 Since the charge diffusion limitation will retard the electrochemical processes and thus degrade the device performance, it has received much less attention in designing electrocatalysts for water splitting, especially at industrial-level current outputs, where a large amount of electrons need to be diffused efficiently.
Two-dimensional metal hydroxide (MH) catalysts have attracted considerable attention due to the advantages of low cost, impressive catalytic activity and durability in alkaline electrolytes, and they have been widely explored in the past several years.18–23 In recent literature, the common approach for improving their OER performance is to regulate the intrinsic catalytic activity by adjusting the crystal phase,24 creating defects,25 or doping with heteroatoms26,27 as well as maximizing the exposed surface active sites. However, the charge diffusion is particularly crucial for highly active but less conductive two-dimensional (2D) MH electrocatalysts.
In order to compensate for the naturally low conductivity, MHs are commonly combined with highly conductive substrates such as graphene to enhance the charge transportability.20,28–31 However, as typical two-dimensional materials, MHs are composed of in-plane interconnected metal–oxygen octahedrons by strong metal–oxygen bonds in each MH layer, while these layers are held together by weak out-of-plane van der Waals interactions. This anisotropic structure of MH leads to anisotropic conductivity like other 2D materials.32 For example, the in-plane electrical resistivity of graphite is 0.04 mΩ cm, which is significantly lower than 150 mΩ cm for the interlayer resistivity.33 For transition-metal dichalcogenides, the electrical conductivity along the layer is about 2200 times higher than that across the layers.34,35 Therefore, it is conceivable that the overloaded MHs with stacked layers on graphene would significantly limit the interlayer electron diffusion, making it the rate-limiting step during high current OER. Avoiding the stacking of MH layers to enable the in-plane electron transport would be effective for improving the OER activity, especially under high current density. However, how the charge diffusion affects the OER performance of MHs and how to control this property has not yet been systematically investigated, although these insights would advance the knowledge and design of new electrocatalysts with favourable charge transport capability for efficient water oxidation.
Herein, we demonstrate a simple and scalable strategy for fabricating a series of CoFe hydroxide/graphene (CFH@G) composites and regulating their charge diffusion properties to realize industrial-level current output. The structure of CFH@Gs was elaborately designed to meet the requirements of high activity OER catalysts (Scheme 1). Iron element was introduced into the Co(OH)2 structure to obtain high intrinsic active sites. The hierarchical architecture was also built to offer CFH@G abundant active sites and preliminary fast charge transport, as well as excellent hydrophilicity to ensure rapid mass transport between the electrolyte and catalytic sites. Subsequently, the charge diffusion property of the CFH@G composites was regulated by carefully adjusting the thickness and the alignment of the CFH layer. By preparing the few-layer thick CFH nanosheets to lie on the graphene matrix and cover the entire surface, the effective in-plane electron diffusion can be ensured while providing as many active sites as possible. The overly thick or stacked CFH nanosheets would retard the electron transport, thus damaging the OER performance even though they provide much larger exposed active sites.

Experimental section
Chemicals and materials
FeSO4·7H2O (98%), CoSO4·7H2O (98%), iridium(IV) oxide (99.99%), and potassium hydroxide (99.98%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Graphene was purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co. Ltd (XFNANO); the graphene powder was prepared by the chemical method, the size ranged from 0.5–5 μm, and the thickness ranged from 0.8–1.2 nm. Nafion (5 wt%, DuPont) was received from commercial suppliers. Ethanol, ammonia aqueous solution (25–28%), and hydrochloric acid were obtained at analytic grade (A. R.) from Beijing Chemical Works. Nickel foam (NF) (1.8 mm in thickness) was used as the substrate. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification. Milli-Q ultrapure water (resistance of 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C) was used in all experiments.
Preparation of CFH@G-x
A series of CFH@G-x with different mass loadings of CoFe hydroxide (CFH) were synthesized via a coprecipitation method at room temperature by simply changing the dosage of the feeding metal salt (Co and Fe);36x represents the molar amount of the used metal salt. The molar ratio of Co to Fe was set to 2:1. Specifically, the total amount of metal salts was 0.375 mmol for CFH@G-0.375, 1.5 mmol for CFH@G-1.5, 3.75 mmol for CFH@G-3.75, and 7.5 mmol for CFH@G-7.5. In a typical synthesis, two solutions containing different amounts of Co and Fe sulfates and graphene were mixed. The metal cations were adsorbed onto the graphene as the nucleation sites. Next, 5 mL ammonia aqueous solution (25–28%) was slowly added to the above suspension with violent stirring (1000 rpm). The CFH nanosheets were quickly grown from the initial nucleation sites and covered the graphene matrix. The products were washed with water and ethanol, then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight.
Preparation of the CFH@G-1.5/NF electrode
The electrode was prepared by coating CFH@G-1.5 ink on nickel foam (NF) via an ultrasonic spray-deposition setup (Sunlaite SP201, China). In brief, 3 mg CFH@G-1.5 was ultrasonically dispersed in 20 mL ethanol for 1 h, followed by the addition of 20 μL 5% Nafion solution and ultrasonication for another 0.5 h to achieve the catalyst ink. The as-prepared ink was spray-deposited on a clean NF with a catalyst loading of 0.5 mg cm−2.
Preparation of the MoNi4/MoO2/NF HER electrode
An aqueous solution containing 0.04 M Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.01 M (NH4)6Mo7O24·6H2O was prepared and transferred into a Teflon autoclave after continuous stirring. A piece of pre-cleaned nickel foam was then put into the solution. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 150 °C for 6 h in an oven to obtain NiMoO4 cuboids on nickel foam (NiMoO4/NF). The obtained NiMoO4/NF was subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 2 h in a H2/Ar (v/v, 10/90) atmosphere to achieve MoNi4/MoO2/NF.
Four-probe resistance measurements
The powder samples were pressed into disks at 4 MPa with two stainless-steel plungers. The resistances were measured by a Keithley 2400 digital multimeter in four-wire mode. The conductivities of the samples were then calculated according to the resistance and the size of the disk.
Material characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were recorded on a Rigaku D/max 2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at a scan rate of 2° per min in the 2-theta degree range from 5° to 80°. Morphology and structure characterizations were performed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi SU-8020) operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F) working at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Energy dispersive spectra (EDS) and mapping images were collected using the EDS system (Oxford Materials Analysis) on the SEM and TEM. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to determine the chemical bonding states using a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi with 300 W monochromatic Mg Kα radiation. Contact angle measurements were carried out on a contact angle system (DataPhysics OCA20, Germany).
Electrochemical measurements
All electrocatalytic measurements were performed on an Autolab PGSTAT302N (Metrohm, Netherlands) electrochemical workstation at room temperature (25 °C) using a conventional three-electrode configuration. The as-prepared electrodes, Hg/HgO electrode (1 M NaOH), and carbon rod were used as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively. To prepare the working electrode, 3 mg of catalyst and 20 μL of 0.5% Nafion solution were dispersed in 500 μL of ethanol with the assistance of ultrasonication for 1 h to form a homogeneous catalyst ink. Afterward, the ink was drop-cast onto a glassy carbon electrode with a catalyst loading of 0.2 mg cm−2. The double-layer capacitances (Cdl) of the catalysts were measured in the potential range without the Faradaic process at various scan rates including 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted under the potential of 1.53 V (vs. RHE) in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 MHz. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with 90% iR-compensation unless specifically indicated. Chronopotentiometry (CP) curves were recorded without iR-compensation. All potentials reported in this work were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and were converted according to the following equation:ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.098 + 0.059 × pHwhere EHg/HgO is the measured potential referenced to the Hg/HgO reference electrode.
The overpotential (η) was calculated according to the following formula:η(V) = ERHE − 1.23V
The overall water splitting measurements were performed in a two-electrode system consisting of a CFH@G-1.5/NF electrode as the anode and MoNi4/MoO2/NF as the cathode. The LSV curve for overall water splitting was recorded in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 without iR-compensation.
The solar-driven water-splitting system was assembled with a commercial GaAs solar cell without external bias. The solar cell was placed under simulated AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination to provide the voltage to power the electrolyzer. The efficiency of the solar to hydrogen conversion was calculated according to the following formula:  where j is the current density and P is the light power.
The near-industrial electrolytic measurements were carried out in 6 M KOH electrolyte at 60 °C.
Results and discussion
Four CFH@G composites with different nanosheet thicknesses were successfully prepared and denoted as CFH@G-x, where x represents the molar amount of metals (Co and Fe) used in the synthetic recipe. All of their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1a) were similar, with four typical peaks at 10.6°, 22.1°, 34.4°, and 59.4°, corresponding well to the (003), (006), (101), and (110) planes of the hexagonal α-Co(OH)2 (JCPDS no. 46-0605), respectively. The wide XRD peak at around 23° could be attributed to the graphene substrate. It is worth noting that the intensity of the (003) peak (representing the interlayer of α-Co(OH)2 (ref. 18)) of CFH@G-0.375 or CFH@G-1.5 is very low, indicating the ultrathin layer structure in these two composites. The CFH layers were became much thicker for CFH@G-3.75 and CFH@G-7.5 as indicated by the increased (003) peak intensity.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of CFH@G-0.375 shows a rough surface covered by randomly distributed nanosheets (Fig. 1b and inset). These separated nanosheets exhibit an ultrathin morphology when observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1c). The high-resolution TEM image (HRTEM, inset in Fig. 1c) reveals the lattice fringes with a distance of 0.15 nm, corresponding well to the d-spacing of the (110) planes in α-Co(OH)2. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping in Fig. 1d verified the successful growth of Fe-doped Co(OH)2 nanosheets on the graphene substrate. As the metal dosage increased to 1.5 mmol, the small discrete nanosheets grew and fully covered the graphene matrix (CFH@G-1.5, Fig. 1e). The interconnected wall-like nanostructure was formed as the metal dosage further increased to 3.75 mmol (Fig. 1f) and became much denser at 7.5 mmol (Fig. 1g). The TEM image corroborates that the nanosheets in CFH@G-1.5 retained the ultrathin structure (Fig. 2a), but they can become much thicker and stacked together if the loading further increases (Fig. S1†). High-resolution TEM images demonstrate that the majority of these 2D nanosheets in CFH@G-1.5 are around 4-atomic-layers (Fig. 2b) with an interlayer spacing of 0.38 nm. The number becomes greater than 10 atomic-layers for CFH@G-3.5 (Fig. 2c) and over 20 layers for CFH@G-7.5 (Fig. 2d), indicating that the increase in metal dosage leads to thicker CFH layers. EDS mapping images (Fig. 2e) suggest the homogeneous distribution of Co, Fe, O, and C elements in CFH@G-1.5. The atomic ratio of Co to Fe was determined to be ∼2:1 (Fig. S2†).

It is well known that a hydrophilic interface between the catalyst surface and the electrolyte can favour the mass and charge exchange during the reaction.37 The hydrophilicity of CFH@G-1.5 was firstly examined by Tyndall light scattering.38,39 The photograph in Fig. 2f shows that the laser travels straight through the aqueous suspension. Such a state can be maintained for at least several weeks, indicating the excellent hydrophilicity. Subsequently, the hydrophilicity of the CFH@G-1.5 surface was directly measured by contact angle experiments. As shown in Fig. 2g, bare graphene shows a large contact angle of 168.76° and retains the value of 151.87° after 30 min (the slight shrinking of the water droplet could be due to the natural evaporation of water) owing to its hydrophobic nature. In contrast, CFH@G-1.5 exhibited a smaller contact angle of 136.64°, which quickly decreased to 10.32° within several seconds (Fig. 2h), indicating that the hydrophobic graphene surface turns into a hydrophilic surface after being covered by CFH nanosheets.
The surface chemical states of CFH@G-1.5 were then probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2i, the main peak at 284.8 eV in the C 1s spectrum originates from the C–C bond from the graphene substrate. Minor peaks at 286.3 and 288.5 eV can be assigned to C–OH and C–OOH bonds, respectively, originating from the abundant carboxyl groups on the oxidized graphene surface, as evidenced by the Raman spectrum of the graphene substrate with an ID/IG ratio of 0.76 (Fig. S3†). These oxygen-containing functional groups play a critical role in anchoring the hydroxide layer onto graphene through chemical bonds, enabling effective charge transport at such an interface. The presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in CFH@G-1.5 was evidenced by the peaks at 710.8 and 712.7 eV in Fe 2p (Fig. 2j), respectively.40 In the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 2k), the peak at 781.3 eV with an obvious shake-up (786.6 eV) indicates the dominant presence of Co2+.41 The atomic contents of Co and Fe in CFH@G-1.5 as determined by XPS were 11.1% and 5.4%, respectively, which are consistent with the EDS results. The XPS peak at 283.1 eV in the C 1s spectrum of CFH@G-0.375 (Fig. S4†) could be ascribed to the C–C bonding shifted by the charging effect from the large conductivity difference between the exposed graphene surface and the CFH covered surface. This corroborates that the graphene surface was not fully covered by CFHs in the case of CFH@G-0.375.
The OER performance of the catalysts was first evaluated through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves. The graphene substrate exhibited negligible current density in the scan range (Fig. S5†), indicating that the performance of the composites came from the loaded hydroxides. The role of Fe in modulating the electronic structure of the active site was evidenced by the shifted XPS binding energy (Fig. S6†) as well as the enhanced OER activity. As displayed in Fig. S7a,† the LSV curve of CFH@G-1.5 with Fe was significantly shifted as compared with CH@G-1.5 without Fe. The Fe modulation also increased the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) (Fig. S7b†). After normalization by ECSA in terms of capacitances, CFH@G-1.5 still showed a much better intrinsic OER performance than CH@G-1.5, corroborating the improvement of the OER performance by Fe modulation (Fig. S7c†). Furthermore, the Fe modulation also greatly reduced the charge transfer resistance (Rct) (Fig. S7d†). The OER performances of four CFH@G catalysts were recorded as shown in Fig. 3a. The CFH@G-0.375 exhibited a relatively good OER activity with overpotentials of 311, 348, and 368 mV at 10, 50, and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. After the nanosheets fully covered the graphene, the CFH@G-1.5 showed the highest activity among four catalysts with the smallest overpotentials of 260, 294, and 312 mV at the corresponding current densities. Notably, it can deliver a high current density of 500 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of only 398 mV (Fig. S8†). However, as the loading of CFH increased, the OER activity appreciably decreased for CFH@G-3.75 (300, 337, and 359 mV) and CFH@G-7.5 (303, 367, and 406 mV). Tafel slopes of these CFH@Gs were further analysed (Fig. 3b). CFH@G-0.375 exhibited the smallest value of 37.9 mV dec−1, which gradually increased as the CFH loading increased (48.7, 53.9, and 65.8 mV dec−1 for CFH@G-1.5, −3.75, and −7.5, respectively). The control samples of CFH-1.5, without graphene substrate but in the physical mixture (CFH-1.5 + G), were also prepared. CFH-1.5 shows the morphology of self-nucleated nanosheet assemblies (Fig. S9†). It can be seen that CFH-1.5 + G exhibited much worse catalytic activity (Fig. S10a†) and showed significantly larger charge transfer resistance (Rct) than all the CFH@G catalysts (Fig. S10b†), indicating the notable improvement in the charge diffusion by directly growing CFH on graphene. Compared with CFH@G-0.375 and CFH@G-1.5, the appreciably increased Rct for CFH@G-3.75 and CFH@G-7.5 suggests deteriorated charge transport as the CFH nanosheets got thicker and stacked. These results indicate the importance of constructing an efficient charge transport pathway in promoting catalytic performance. The long-term durability of the best-performing CFH@G-1.5 was evaluated at a fixed current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3c), which exhibited a negligible rise (5 mV) after continuous operation for nearly 25 h. Durability at high current densities was subsequently evaluated by multi-current step chronopotentiometry (Fig. 3d). The overpotentials remained constant at each current density up to 50 mA cm−2, indicating that the in situ grown architecture remained robust even under high O2 evolution rates. The chemical composition of CFH@G-1.5 after the durability test was evaluated by XPS measurements (Fig. S11†). The Co 2p3/2 spectrum exhibited a new higher peak at 779.9 eV, implying the formation of Co3+ after durability testing.42 Similarly, the Fe 2p3/2 spectrum located at 711 eV indicated that the Fe species were fully translated into Fe3+.40 The new peak at 528.6 eV in the O 1s spectrum, corresponding to the lattice oxygen species, also verified the surface oxidation.43

Schematic illustration of the (g) in-plane and (h) interlayer charge diffusion processes. 
To further probe the effects of different structural features of CFH@G catalysts on their OER activity, ECSA were evaluated by measuring the electrochemical double layer capacitances (Cdl), as shown in Fig. S12.†44 According to the plot slopes in Fig. 3e, CFH@G-0.375 showed the smallest Cdl value of 28.6 mF cm−2 while it dramatically increased to 71.2 mF cm−2 for CFH@G-1.5, indicating that the number of accessible electrochemical sites rapidly increased as the CFH nanosheets fully covered the entire graphene surface. The Cdl then slowly increased to 84.3 mF cm−2 for CFH@G-3.75 because the CFH nanosheets started to grow in a stacked way, where the interconnected nanowall structure formed. As the nanowall became denser, the highest Cdl value of 125.2 mF cm−2 was achieved for CFH@G-7.5. This trend is consistent with the SEM results. However, CFH@G-1.5 showed the best OER activity, while the CFH@G-7.5 has the largest ECSA. Generally, the denser active sites are usually observed with higher catalytic performance. To understand the origin of this activity difference, the OER curves of all catalysts were normalized by the Cdl values to exclude the influence of the active site density (Fig. 3f). Compared with CFH@G-1.5, the CFH-1.5 + G showed a more inferior intrinsic OER performance after normalization, corroborating the improvement of the direct layer-to-layer structure in charge transport as well as OER activity (Fig. S13†). The CFH@G-1.5 still displayed the best OER performance among all the CFH@G catalysts with graphene supports. It is interesting to note that the activity of CFH@G-0.375 after normalization was greatly enhanced and approached that of CFH@G-1.5 since they both have a favourable charge diffusion pathway. The activities of CFH@G-3.75 and CFH@G-7.5 after the normalization got worse due to the subtraction of the contribution from increased active sites as compared with CFH@G-1.5. Since all CFH@G catalysts share the same active compounds, the differences in Fig. 3f are largely dependent on the charge diffusion properties as determined by the catalyst architecture. The four-probe resistance measurements were carried out to directly evaluate the electronic conductivities of these samples. The CFH@G-0.375 and CFH@G-1.5 exhibited similar conductivities (5.33 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 1.21 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively), which were two orders higher as compared to CFH@G-3.75 (2.88 × 10−6 S cm−1) and CFH@G-7.5 (1.23 × 10−6 S cm−1). The conductivities of all CFH@G catalysts were significantly higher than that of CFH itself without the graphene support (1.53 × 10−7 S cm−1).
The architecture of these graphene-supported catalysts is illustrated in Fig. 3g for the cases of CFH@G-0.375 and CFH@G-1.5, as well as Fig. 3h for CFH@G-3.75 and CFH@G-7.5. If few-layer thick CFH nanosheets lay on the substrate, the electrons from the OER could efficiently diffuse to the conductive graphene through the in-plane pathway and get collected. However, if the CFH nanosheets are overly thick, the electrons have to be transported across the layers (interlayer pathway) to reach the conductive substrate. Such interlayer electron diffusion will limit the reaction process, especially at high current density, thus resulting in low catalytic activity. This observation demonstrates the significance of the regulation of the charge diffusion properties in enhancing electrocatalytic performance, which may guide the structural design of supporting materials for efficient electrochemical reactions.
To evaluate the potential application of CFH@G-1.5 in the real water splitting device, the catalyst was further deposited onto a three-dimensional nickel foam (denoted as CFH@G-1.5/NF). The OER performance of CFH@G-1.5/NF was significantly enhanced in terms of a lower overpotential of 246 mV at 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4a) although the OER activity of the NF substrate itself is negligible (Fig. S14†). The large current density of 100 and 500 mA cm−2 can also be achieved at a very low overpotential of 284 mV and 364 mV. This performance is better than that of IrO2/NF (Fig. S15†) and is comparable to, or lower than, the recently developed OER catalysts (Table S1†). Notably, the CFH-1.5/NF without the graphene substrate exhibited a much inferior OER performance, indicating that the graphene matrix also plays an important role in accelerating the charge transfer and thus reaction kinetics. Such excellent OER performance inspired us to assemble a real water electrolyzer with a reported highly active HER electrode composed of MoNi4 on MoO2 (MoNi4/MoO2/NF).45 The HER performance with a low overpotential of 131 mV at 100 mA cm−2 was measured as shown in Fig. S16.† The electrolyzer device composed of CFH@G-1.5/NF and MoNi4/MoO2/NF carries a very small cell voltage of only 1.507 V and 1.696 V (without iR-compensation) to deliver 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 4b). Such impressive activity is among the state-of-the-art catalysts (Fig. 4c and Table S2†). Furthermore, the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) was measured by integrating the electrolyzer with a commercial GaAs solar cell to demonstrate a solar-driven water-splitting system. The J–V curves (Fig. 4d) gave a high STH of 17.41%, ranking in the top tier (Table S3†). The photograph (Fig. 4e) and movie (Movie S1†) depict the continuous production of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles under simulated solar light. The solar-driven current output showed no decay after 3600 s of operation (Fig. 4f), demonstrating the feasibility of our catalyst in the practical solar water splitting system. In light of the excellent catalytic performance. We further measured the OER performance of CFH@G-1.5 and its overall water splitting performance in the electrolyzer under a near-industrial electrolytic condition (6 M KOH electrolyte at 60 °C). This electrode exhibited superb activity with a small potential of 1.406 V to deliver 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. S17†). Furthermore, this electrode could stably deliver current densities of 100, 1000, and 2000 mA cm−2 under extremely low potentials of 1.431, 1.480, and 1.507 V, respectively (Fig. 4g). The overall water splitting electrolyzer also exhibited superior performance in terms of small cell voltages of 1.439, 1.556, and 1.694 V without iR-compensation to deliver 10, 100, and 400 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 4h). The steady output at 50 mA cm−2 during 100 h of continued operation (Fig. 4i) indicates the superior durability of the electrolyzer.

Conclusions
To gain insight into the influence of charge diffusion on water electrolysis, we report herein the rational charge diffusion regulation of CFH@G composites towards a high-rate OER. Systematic investigations and control experiments have demonstrated that the charge diffusion properties of these CFH@G composites could be regulated by controlling the thickness of loaded CFH nanosheets on the graphene substrate. The few-layer thick nanosheet allowed the effective in-plane electron transport from CFH to graphene, while the overly thick or stacked nanosheets exhibited sluggish electron diffusion. The best performance was achieved on the CFH@G-1.5 where both fast charge diffusion and sufficient amounts of active sites were ensured. Together with the NF scaffold, the CFH@G-1.5/NF electrode was capable of delivering a striking industrial-level current density of 2000 mA cm−2 at an extremely low potential of 1.507 V under harsh near-industrial conditions. When it was applied as an anode in a practical solar-driven water electrolyzer, the device demonstrated a current density of 400 mA cm−2 at a small cell voltage of 1.694 V, as well as a steady conversion of solar energy to hydrogen with a high efficiency of 17.41%. These findings highlight the importance of charge diffusion regulation by supported catalysts, which should receive more attention when we develop strategies to increase the intrinsic activity and the number of active sites for enhancing the catalytic activity of an electrocatalyst.
