    , Accepted 9th June 2015First published on 15th June 2015AbstractUpconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have made a significant and valuable contribution to materials science, photophysics, and biomedicine due to their specific spectroscopic characteristics. However, the ensemble spectroscopy of UCNPs is limited because of the electronic behavior in average effect, which ignores the fact that these nanoparticles are heterogeneous. With regards to the research focus on heterogeneous intrinsic structures, unique photophysical phenomena, and advanced applications, the optical characterization of single UCNPs have been promoted to the frontier development of the UCNPs community. In this review, we give an overview of the importance of single UCNPs characterization, typical principles of UC, and single particle detection methods. Considerable emphasis is placed on the specific spectroscopic study of single UCNPs, which shows fantastic photophysical phenomena beyond ensemble measurement. Parallel efforts are devoted to the current applications of single UCNPs.
Introduction
Upconversion (UC) luminescence from lanthanide doped nanoparticles with unique spectroscopic conversion ability, which exhibit different promising applications in biomedicine, photovoltaics, 3D displays, and sensing, has become a fast-developing research field in recent years. Photon management in the nanoscale has superiority in optical tunability, which includes aspects of excited-state dynamics, emission spectra, and quantum efficiency. For instance, near-infrared (NIR) excited multicolor UC could be applied in multiplexed labeling through the control of the dopant species, concentration, and spatial distribution. Single-band red or NIR UC emission with high productivity is very promising for deep in vivo imaging and cell tracking. Composites composed of UC nanoparticles and semiconductors (TiO2 and ZnO) have spectral conversion characteristics in the NIR to UV region for solar energy harvesting in photovoltaic or photocatalysis.
One will easily find that all of the prevalent research on UC nanoparticles (UCNPs) are focused on optical performance with the use ensemble spectroscopy techniques. Little effort has been contributed to single nanoparticle UC luminescence behavior, although it is well known that with the knowledge gained through single particle spectroscopy, the performance of the UC particles could be optimized.
UCNPs, e.g. NaYF4, which is considered as a typical representative, have an average size ranging from sub-20 nm to 100 nm. Most UCNPs are synthesized by wet-chemical methods and are expected to disperse in various types of solvents to form a colloid. In addition, the surface functionalization of UCNPs is an extremely important process in bio-applications. For instance, the significant proportion of atoms lying around their surface, combined with enriched surface defects and organic ligands, can significantly complicate the photophysical behavior of doped lanthanides. Electronic behavior detection aimed at a single nanoparticle shows signals from the micro-structure of nanoparticles. Moreover, single nanoparticle spectroscopy offers clear insight into the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic influences without noise, and subsequently gives instructions for the high quality preparation of UCNPs.
On the other hand, single nanoparticle optical characterization possesses powerful capacity to explore the crystalline structure anisotropy related optical differences, or some unexpected unique optical phenomena at the sub-micron and even nano-scale. For instance, earlier developed artificial nano materials, quantum dots and metal nanoparticles have been widely investigated in single nanoparticle photophysics. For example, the first reports of the detection of single CdSe nanocrystals revealed a number of novel photophysical phenomena that had not been expected. NaYF4 or any other UCNPs with isolated activators, which are different from the conductor or semiconductor luminescent principle, are expected to have new photophysical phenomena. From photophysical theoretical investigations to single nanoparticle technical applications, single UCNP focused optical characterization plays an important role in optical super resolution imaging, and local field enhanced luminescence.
In this study, we present the first short review on the UC behaviors of single UCNPs, which spans from the typical UC principles, single particle spectroscopic detection technology, to the recently discovered new photophysical phenomena and applications at the single particle level.
Principles of upconversion luminescence
Upconversion is an anti-Stokes process, which converts two or more low-energy photons into one high-energy photon. The occurrence of this phenomenon benefits from the relatively long lifetime of most of the excited states in trivalent lanthanides. UC luminescence has attracted unprecedented attention with reference to various promising applications, which include photovoltaics, bioimaging, solid-state laser diodes, temperature sensors, and lightings, since UC was first observed by Auzel in the 1960s.
The higher prevalence and practicability of UC compared to multi-photon absorption and second/third harmonic generation are because of its relatively low excitation energy and high quantum efficiency. In general, UC occurs in four different ways (Fig. 1). Fig. 1(a) illustrates excited state absorption (ESA), where the sequential absorption of two photons occurs and the ion is exited to a higher state via a real intermediate state. Fig. 1(b) shows the energy transfer UC (ETU), which means two neighboring ions are excited to the intermediary states by ground state absorption followed by non-radiative energy transfer between the two ions. Fig. 1(c) shows the photon avalanche (PA). This is an unconventional process, where strong UC luminescence occurs without resonance ground state absorption when the excitation power exceeds a certain threshold. The pump wavelength is only resonant between a metastable state and a higher energy state. The energy migration-mediated UC (EMU) shown in Fig. 1(d) was recently proposed by Wang et al.2 which involves the use of four types of lanthanide ions and a core–shell structure. The ions without long-lived intermediary energy states (Ln3+ = Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, and Sm3+) become activators to generate efficient UC luminescence in NaGdF4:Tm3+/Yb3+@NaGdF4:Ln3+ core–shell nanoparticles, which benefit from the energy migration effect of Gd3+ located in the host lattice.

Detection approaches for single particle spectroscopy
The detection of single UCNPs is an advanced technique that requires background knowledge in material science and optical engineering. In all detection approaches, high resolution microscopes and overcoming the light diffraction limit constitute the main components. In general, a 980 nm laser source is employed for excitation and selected ultraviolet, visible or NIR wavelength regions are detected. To date, two mainstream approaches are mainly used for single UCNPs’ optical characterization: confocal scanning microscopy and fiber loaded measurement. These stand out from the other methods, e.g., photonic force microscopy and fiber tapper measurement. In this part, we will give a brief introduction of the key techniques in these two approaches.
Confocal scanning microscopy
Confocal scanning microscopy possesses the advantage of a high signal-to-noise ratio with the spatial filtering effect compared to wide-field microscopy. In this scheme, out-of-focus signals do not pass the hole and are not detected by the detector, as is shown by the grey dot lines in Fig. 2. In a typical single nanoparticle upconversion measurement,3–9 a 980 nm diode laser is tightly focused on the sample through an objective. The sample is raster scanned by a piezo-actuated three-dimensional nanopositioning stage. At each pixel, UC luminescence is collected through the same objective and passed through a dichroic beam splitter and short-pass filters, while the 980 nm excitation light is completely filtered out. After passing through a confocal pinhole, the upconversion luminescence is either detected by a spectrometer for spectrum collection or an avalanche photo diode (APD) for luminescence image acquisition.
 Fig. 2  Schematic of confocal scanning microscopy. 
In confocal scanning microscopy, single nanoparticle hunting is time consuming, which makes sample preparation skill demanding work, even though the atomic force microscope (AFM) is usually in situ combined with optical detection.4,5 Empirical methods consist of TEM grid loading and coverslip loading through the dropping process of diluted nanoparticle solutions with a concentration of ∼0.1 nM. Using TEM grids, single particles could be further confirmed by TEM or SEM imaging. Note that this should be carried out after all optical characterization to avoid perturbing the optical properties caused by high-energy electrons. For the coverslip approach, it is indeed a tricky task to obtain monodisperse particles in the appropriate distribution for single detection. In this case the employment of a surface treatment agent on top of the coverslip may be helpful. In addition, to avoid agglomeration of the nanoparticles during evaporation of the solvent, the coverslip itself could be stored on a support mount on a beaker in an ultrasonic bath.
Fiber loaded measurement
Luminescence detection using liquid-immersed exposed-core microstructured optical fibers (MOF) has been frequently reported by Monro et al.10–12 Recently, single-nanocrystal sensitivity was achieved by enhanced UC luminescence, which results from the cooperation of Jin's group and Monro's group. This makes the fiber loaded technology a powerful approach for single UCNPs detection.13,14 A schematic of the experimental configuration for capturing the UC luminescence of nanoparticles using a suspended-core microstructured optical-fiber dip sensor is demonstrated in Fig. 3. A 980 nm fiber-coupled diode laser source is used for excitation. It is coupled to the MOF using a dichroic mirror and a microscope objective. The UC emission is collected by the same fiber core and is propagated backward to the excitation light. After the fiber light propagates through the dichroic filter and the broad band-pass filter where residual back scattered pump light is removed, the particle luminescence is detected by a spectrometer. The experimental procedure first involves optimizing and recording the amount of power coupled into the suspended core of the fiber by varying the fiber position using XYZ stages. The lens is then removed from the output coupling stage, and the tip of the fiber is immersed in the nanoparticle solution where fiber holes are filled with solution due to capillary forces. The fiber is then removed from the solution and the measurement is performed. Here, the nanoparticle solution is diluted UCNPs dispersed in a nonpolar solvent, e.g., toluene and cyclohexane, with a concentration ranging from tens of fM to tens of nM.

Specific spectroscopic study of single UCNPs beyond ensemble spectroscopy
Single particle characterization is a powerful technical approach to exploit microstructural dependent spectroscopic characters, which are always compromised in ensemble spectroscopy. For instance, both “bright” and “dark” spots representing the UC efficiency of different hexagonal NaYF4 may coexist in an imaging field. This is a clear signal that some unknown defects may be induced during synthesis to generate inconsistent crystalline symmetries between particles though they have similar morphologies, or different particles lying with different lattice planes on surface, which may have specific atomic density and orientation effects with a polarized laser beam. This type of precise spectroscopic study is of great importance to improve the quality of UCNPs, but is ignored in ensemble measurements. Here we would like to introduce some important fundamental developments that are devoted to the upconversion luminescence behaviors of single nanoparticles.
Non-blinking and non-bleaching luminescence
Photoluminescence blinking—random switching between states of high (ON) and low (OFF) emissivity—is a universal property of molecular emitters which is found in single quantum dots and fluorophores.15–17 Moreover, the observed time scale of blink ranges from several hundred milliseconds to several seconds in single Eu3+ ions incorporated in Y2O3 nanoparticles.18 However, such behavior is absent in single nanoparticles with abundant lanthanides. For the lanthanides activated UCNPs, the question—blink or not—has been confirmed by single particle characterization using confocal or wide field microscopy.3,9,19 As is displayed in Fig. 4, the first graphical demonstration of non-blinking behavior and no photobleaching or photodamage after 1 h of continuous laser illumination was reported by Cohen et al. in single (β-NaYF4) nanoparticles doped with 20% Yb3+and 2% Er3+, which was subsequently considered to be ideally suited for single-molecule imaging. Since then, the upconversion intensity fluctuation assessment of a laser focused single particle over a considerable period of time has been frequently used to confirm the photostability of UCNPs. This is practically considered as a prerequisite of UCNPs from materials science for their feasibility in biomedical science. Successful examples of this are listed in Table 1. Moreover, single particle imaging with spectral exhibition is used for the accurate assessment of the brightness of UCNPs with different micro-structures.20

Polarization anisotropic upconversion
Micro-polarized spectroscopy that focuses on single particle luminescence has attracted great attention in semiconductor systems. In contrast to the single emission bands observed for semiconductor systems, lanthanides-doped UCNPs generally show a distinct set of sharp emission peaks arising from f–f orbital electronic transitions. The multiple-peak patterns should provide spectroscopic fingerprints, which are particularly useful for accurate interpretation in the event of overlapping emission spectra, thus possibly allowing a detailed theoretical analysis. Furthermore, UC, which has the requirement of laser excitation, will be affected by the polarization state spontaneously. However, it is still an open question whether nanoparticles with abundant activators should exhibit polarization anisotropy under linearly polarized laser excitation, even though the single lanthanide ion transitions have polarization orientation. Therefore, we tried to demonstrate the micro-polarized optical detection of UC based on a lanthanide doped inorganic dielectric system, namely, a Tm3+–Yb3+ ion couple activated β-NaYF4 single microrod, for the first time.6 During this single particle detection, unique luminescent phenomena were observed upon excitation with a 980 nm linearly polarized laser, e.g. sharp energy level split and singlet to triplet transitions at room temperature, and multiple discrete fluorescence intensity periodic variations with polarized direction (Fig. 5(a–d)). Comparative experiments suggested that intra-ions transition orientation and crystal local symmetry dominate the polarization anisotropy. For the purpose of exploring the origin of polarization anisotropy with convincing experimental design, we further employed excitation polarization detection considering the interplay between the azimuth of laser polarization and the crystallography axis.24 As is shown in Fig. 5(i and k), the linearly polarized laser beam was focused onto two nanodisks face up (i) and side up (k), and the excitation polarization angle was defined as 0° when the laser is polarized parallel to the a axis or c axis, respectively. For the side up particle, it was observed that the UC luminescence intensity changes periodically when the polarization angle of the excitation light is changed from 0° to 360°. Moroever, the polarization degree is as large as 0.78, 0.79, and 0.74 for the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+. However, this UC luminescence dependence on excitation polarization could be ignored in the case of the face up particles. This measurement provided the useful information that the polarization of UC luminescence depends upon the orientation of the nanodisk with respect to the polarization angle of the excitation light or the detection.

Concentration quenching abatement
Dopant concentration is a crucial factor to determine UC brightness and color display.25,26 Strong absorption, critical distance between donor and acceptor, and radiative efficiency are concentration dependent. High dopant concentrations have been found to result in the quenching of luminescence due to cross-relaxation. Therefore, an optimum dopant concentration to avoid quenching is frequently emphasized in most studies, e.g., the optimal Tm3+ concentration in upconverted NaYF4 host lattices has been found to be in the range of ∼0.2–0.5 mol% at excitation irradiance below 100 W cm−2 (with ∼20–40 mol% Yb3+).27–31 Recently, Zhao et al. presented evidence that UC luminescence can be significantly enhanced using considerably higher activator concentrations under relatively high-irradiance excitation.13 In other words, the concentration quenching or UC saturation threshold value could be greatly increased in a single nanoparticle with high power excitation. As is shown in Fig. 6(a), increasing the excitation irradiance from 1.6 × 104 W cm−2 to 2.5 × 106 W cm−2 enhances the overall UC luminescence intensity by factors of 5.6, 71 and 1105 for 0.5 mol%, 4 mol% and 8 mol% Tm3+ concentrations, respectively. Importantly, at high excitation and a high Tm3+ doping level, the fraction of excitation energy producing UC emission is increased. This demonstrates that UC is more efficient at high excitation and for high Tm3+ doping. Similarly, Gargas et al. also reported that a higher UC yield could be produced with high concentration and high excitation irradiance in the case of 20 mol% Yb3+–20 mol% Er3+ couple.7 In addition, the fascinating single particle luminescence images with low, medial, and high laser intensity give clear evidence of this concentration quenching abatement effect of single nanoparticles with high doping (Fig. 6(b)).

Intense multiphoton upconversion
Multiphoton UC with a large anti-Stokes shift is produced in potential applications, which include photocatalysis and super-resolution imaging. Tm3+, which is the most popular activator to generate multiphoton UC, has a perfect ladder-type electron configuration with fairly small mismatch in relation to the energy feeding from Yb3+ step-by-step. The concentration of the classic combination for a Tm3+–Yb3+ couple is about 2 mol%–20 mol% in a hexagonal NaYF4 host, which has been found for the utilization of the strong 2-photon near-infrared (NIR) emission.32 Actually, the lower the concentration of Tm3+, the higher the multiphoton UC percentage will be obtained on account of the avoidance of cross relaxation quenching. However, one should note that this energy distribution status of multi- and 2-photons populations shown in the spectrum is at the cost of the overall quantum efficiency of UC due to the small activator number. Benefiting from the saturation excitation effect in the single nanoparticle mode, we successfully observed luminescent switching between the emissions from 2-photon UC and multi-photon UC at 2 mol% Tm3+–20 mol% Yb3+ with the increase of laser power (Fig. 7(a,b)). The achievement of the super-intense multiphoton UC of Tm3+—specifically, the emission intensity of blue 4-photon UC exhibits an increase by a factor of ∼70 in comparison with the NIR 2-photon UC under 980 nm excitation (Fig. 7(c))—may promote the Yb3+–Tm3+ ion couple to be a good candidate as a lanthanide activator for NIR excited super-resolution UC imaging.

(c) Laser power dependent multiphoton UC radiative percentages in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 850 nm of single β-NaYF4:20 Yb3+–2 Tm3+nanoparticle.33 
Heterogeneous emission profiles
Nanoparticles, which are synthesized by wet-chemical methods with different types of surfactants, are usually capped with corresponding surface chemical bonding. For example, all three conventional ways (coprecipitation, thermal decomposition, and solvothermal methods) used to synthesize NaYF4 UCNPs cause the introduction of oleic acid molecules or oleic acid ions ligands to attach to the surface of the particles.2 These surface ligands, which are accompanied with crystal defects, will affect the precision spectroscopy of each nanoparticle. From the precise particle-by-particle spectral investigation, the microscopic electron behavior and energy transfer mechanism exploration would be certainly improved; more importantly, it makes sense to obtain high efficient UCNPs by intrinsic improvement. A pioneering discovery has been reported by Gargas et al., and typical heterogeneous high-resolution spectra from their study are shown in Fig. 8, with particle-to-particle variations in peak intensities at 541 and 557 nm.7 The addition of undoped NaYF4 shells to these nanoparticles eliminates this heterogeneity (Fig. 8, bottom trace), thus suggesting a region within the nanoparticles in which the lanthanides may be emissive but are energetically coupled to the surface. The observed spectral differences may arise from either variation in the lanthanide distributions between nanoparticles, or from subtle variations in surface defects, surface reconstruction, or faceting. This identification of loss from energy transfer to the surface suggests one means for improving the emission from nanoparticles.

Vertical dotted lines highlight the peaks that exhibit heterogeneity between individual UCNPs. The green emission spectrum of an 8 nm UC nanoparticle with an epitaxial 1.8 nm undoped shell is shown below the horizontal dashed line.7 
Lifetime-tunable imaging
Lifetime is another dominant characteristic, in addition to the emission profile with the fingerprint effect of Lanthanides’ electronic transitions. Lanthanides have their 4f–4f transitions in the time range from microseconds to milliseconds. Among typical materials that emit such long-lived luminescence, lanthanides doped UCNPs are attracting significant attention for applications in sensing, bioimaging, and 3D displays. Although it is widely known that the lifetime of lanthanides could be tuned by their concentration in a local environment, the issue of how best to control and fine tune the lifetimes that cover a broad temporal range that targets to certain application is a challenge. Recently, Lu et al. developed more than ten nanocrystal populations with distinct lifetimes ranging from 25.6 μs to 662.4 μs and decoded their well-separated lifetime identities in a single color band. This precise tuning of lifetime has been vividly demonstrated in a single nanocrystal's emission at 475 nm.34Fig. 9 shows the confocal images of five typical groups of lifetime-encoded Tm-doped ‘τ-dots’, using pseudocolour to map the luminescence lifetime for each pixel. This is a pioneering discovery of single nanoparticle characterization that focuses on the transient state of the electronic transition rather than the steady state. The multi-dimensional comprehension and views of upconversion behavior are promising for further advancement of the broad application prospect of UCNPs.

Applications in single UCNP level
Super-resolution upconversion imaging
Upconversion is of high interest for microscopy because of the excellent imaging quality without a luminescence background. The combination of the advantages of super-resolution optical microscopy techniques and UCNPs is an advanced investigation with significant importance. In terms of the fluorescent species dependent super-resolution technique, a breakthrough of optical resolution could be achieved using UCNPs. Simultaneously, for the widespread research on lanthanides doped UCNPs, which span from chemosynthesis, dynamical models, spectroscopic analysis, and ensemble applications, it is a frontier development at the single particle level to realize super-resolution UC imaging. To date, the reported feasible solution is a method that resembles stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED), which involves stimulated absorption rather than stimulated emission. In this method, a three-level system and long-lived intermediary state are necessary, e.g., the Pr3+:3H4–1D2–4f5d system with long lifetime of 1D2 (150–200 μs) was used by Kolesov et al.35 As is shown in Fig. 10(a), the 1D2 level is excited by an orange 609 nm laser, and a donut-shaped 532 nm beam is exploited as the second excitation step. In that situation, the population of the 1D2 level is depleted by the donut green beam unless the particle is not at the center of the donut. After that, the remaining population of the 1D2 state can be read out by a short 532 nm pulse. Finally, comparing the confocal images (Fig. 10(b)) and the super-resolution images (Fig. 10(c)), the optical resolution value can be improved by at least an order of magnitude. The best resolution obtained to date was ∼50 nm and is limited by the size of the nanoparticles. Further improvement is expected to be realized using a NaYF4:Yb3+–Tm3+ UC system with a smaller particle size.

Location control investigation of luminescence enhancement
The plasmonic local field effect on luminescence is a controversial topic because of the vague theoretical origin of enhancement and the random occurrence of enhancement or quenching.36–38 One recognized experience from the previous research is that the positional relation between emitters and metallic surfaces or particles possess critical importance on the field effect.39 The investigation to this point has been successfully performed with a controllable nanoassembly of UCNPs and gold nanospheres in the single particle mode and even with the consideration of the laser polarization effect.5 As is shown in Fig. 11(a), the gold sphere was brought in the vicinity of the UC nanoparticle with its central axis along the laser polarization axis. The non-equative rates of increase between green and red emission by a factor of 4.8 and 2.7 are observed from the UC spectra in Fig. 11(b). The plasmonic enhancement effect on the emission of the nanoparticle was also reflected in the reduction of the rise and decay times (Fig. 11(c)). This controlled study of UC using single nanoparticle accurate characterization provides important input for the optimum design of future hybrid UCNPs and metal nanostructures.

(b) UC emission spectra of the nanoparticle without (violet curve) and with (blue curve) the gold nanosphere in close vicinity. (c) Rise (upper) and decay times (lower) of the green (left) and red (right) emission with the same color code as in part (b). (d) Schematic of the tip-enhancement of a single UC nanoparticle. (e) UC emission spectra with retracted and approached tip, respectively. (f) Decay curves for red emission detected with and without the tip at 660 nm.5,40 
Similarly, tip-enhanced luminescence is an effect in which the locally enhanced electric fields in the vicinity of a sharp metal tip are used to amplify the excitation and emission rates in a nearby sample object. Very recently, Mauser et al. presented the first near-field study of a single NaYF4 nanoparticle doped with Yb3+–Er3+ using an AFM scanning tip.40 The strong UC luminescence amplification (Fig. 11(e)) indicated the tip-enhanced near-field effect, and the enhancement factor was in general agreement with the near-field to far-field ratios calculated according to the experimental configuration (Fig. 11(d)). The significantly faster decay of the lifetime in the presence of the tip (Fig. 11(g)) and tip-sample distance curves confirmed the contribution of radiative rate enhancement. This study indicates the potential of this single nanoparticle technique for the characterization of more complex upconverting structures with subtle targets, e.g., to demonstrate the lattice plane sensitive enhancement in a single hexagonal particle.
Single particle multicolor barcoding
Optical microbarcodes are emerging as attractive media for multiplexed analyte detection or anti-counterfeiting applications.41–47 Here, a lanthanide-doped UC system with multicolor anti-Stokes emissions using single-wavelength NIR laser excitation provides a feasible strategy to generate a large, diverse library of optical barcodes. However, it is still a challenge to display an optical barcode at the single particle level because of the optical resolution limitation of commonly designed core–shell UC nanoparticles. Therefore, it is critical to design a multicolor structure with the monochromaticity of spatial separation. Recently, Liu et al. reported the design of one-dimensional epitaxial growth on the tips of a parent rod structure, where different activators exhibiting RGB colors were doped in the epitaxial material and parent rods (Fig. 12).48 Using confocal single particle optical characterization, the energy transfer at the tip junction was investigated by lifetime comparison. The unaltered lifetimes of Er3+ recorded at three different spots, which were obtained by moving the focus indicated that there is no apparent crosstalk between Tm3+ and Er3+ activators, even at the tip junction.

Conclusion and perspective
Significant achievements in the fields of UCNPs have been rapidly made in the past few years, which span from nanofabrication, photophysical theory, to applications. Towards further enormous progress, advanced technical promotion with regards to the crystal growth kinetic related intrinsic structure combined with the size effect, surface effect, and local field effect is urgently necessary. In this regard, the characterization of single nanoparticle UC behavior is extremely effective to offer breakthrough insight of UC investigations. Beyond the universality of ensemble spectroscopy, single particle optical characterization exhibits its superiority in inhomogeneous or anisotropic spectra, unique photophysical phenomena, and tailored applications.
Despite the growing efforts that have been devoted to the single particle behavior of UC luminescence, further thinking to push the research to a remarkable depth and breadth is necessary. First, the major challenge for single nanoparticle characterization is centered on the sensitivity issue. The quantum efficiency of small size UCNPs is still low. The success of single particle detection mainly relies on laser irradiation with a high power density up to ∼106 W cm−2. However, this high energy input at the focus point may cause side effects and even irreversible damage of the application environment in some cases. Moreover, limited by the UCNPs’ brightness, the current investigations of single particles are mainly located in species of Er3+ and Tm3+, which have efficient UC sensitized by Yb3+. Therefore, high quality UCNPs with high-technical nanofabrication is urgently pursued,49 and a more effective way to collect the nondirectional emitting light is expected to improve sensitivity. On the other hand, because there are no commercial instruments available with single nanoparticle sensitivity, only a few leading research groups with instrumentation expertise have such capability to purposely build instruments and carry out advanced optical characterizations of single UCNPs. More encouragement is needed for the multidisciplinary research community to purposely build instruments to further advance this field. Second, the high-speed nanopositioning function aimed at single particles with the size of 1–100 nm in the optical detection technique is pursued. Taking the confocal scanning technique as an example, the specimen treatment and point-by-point scanning way is time consuming. In addition, it should be noticed that when less optical components are employed in the detection part, high credibility of the data collected and high signal-to-noise ratio will be achieved. Third, systematic research with precise controllability of optical-function at the single nanoparticle level is expected to be carried out beyond the limits of the current phenomenological exploration. For example, the accession of external fields on single UCNPs, e.g., cryogenics, pressure, and magnetic or electronic fields, are expected to show fantastic modulation capability of UC luminescence. To date, we consider that the most promising applicable way out of UC luminescence from single nanoparticles lies in the optical super-resolution imaging and the dynamic detection of diagnosis and therapy in biomedical fields.
