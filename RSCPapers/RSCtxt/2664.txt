    , Accepted 2nd July 2019First published on 2nd July 2019AbstractTernary blended approach, which uses a small-bandgap nonfullerene acceptor as the guest to comply with the aggregation of the host with an increased short-circuit current-density (Jsc), however, usually supplies reduced open-circuit voltage (Voc). In this study, we present a new ternary material approach with a higher-LUMO-level nonfullerene acceptor to comply with the aggregation of the host with increased Voc, which supplies a 16.1%-efficiency polymer solar cell. This ternary approach was designed on the basis of a new host binary system with PBDB-T-SF as the donor polymer and Y6, a recently reported fused-benzothiadiazole-based molecule, as the host nonfullerene acceptor. It was realized by replacing a small amount of the host with the guest ITCT, an IDTT-based, fused-ring electron acceptor. The application of this approach to another binary system, PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F, again demonstrated the same beneficial effects. The structural similarity between the guest and the host benefits the higher-LUMO-level ITCT synergized with the host, which not only maintains the homogeneous fine morphology and keeps the π–π stacking patterns of the host binary blend but also forms larger donor and acceptor phases and increases the phase crystallinity, by which the charge mobilities increased and the recombination reduced, contributing to the improved FF. The Jsc is maintained though a small amount of Y6 in the host binary blend was replaced with the guest ITCT having a wider bandgap. The results reported herein demonstrate that the use of a structurally similar nonfullerene acceptor with a higher-LUMO-level as the guest is a simple, yet effective, ternary material approach that enables increased Voc with improved device function and performance.

New concepts
The ternary blended approach has been proven to be effective in improving device function and performance with increased efficiency. Along with the success in the fullerene-free binary blended polymer solar cells, the use of two compatible nonfullerene acceptors continues to receive increasing interest. To date, this fullerene-free ternary blended approach is usually designed by selecting a small bandgap nonfullerene acceptor as the near infrared absorber to achieve an increased short-circuit current-density (Jsc). In order to reduce the optical bandgap of the added nonfullerene acceptor, its energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) has to be down-shifted, which usually leads to a reduced open-circuit voltage (Voc), and therefore, a reduced efficiency in most cases. This issue (i.e., the reduced Voc) can be overcome by selecting a higher-LUMO-level nonfullerene acceptor as the guest. As demonstrated in this study, we achieved a new binary system with PBDB-T-SF as the donor polymer and the newly reported Y6 as the host nonfullerene acceptor, which shows an efficiency of 15.2%, and we selected ITCT as the higher-LUMO-level acceptor guest. We found that the guest ITCT complies well with the aggregation of Y6, leading to the effective maintenance of the homogeneously nanoscaled fine film-morphology and π–π stacking pattern of the Y6 binary. More interestingly, the guest ITCT further improved the morphology with the formation of larger phase domains and increased phase crystallinity. As a result, this synergy of the host Y6 with the higher-LUMO-level ITCT benefits in obtaining an increased Voc with the concurrent increase in electron and hole mobilities and a reduction in recombination, leading to an improved device fill-factor while maintaining the device Jsc, and hence, improved device efficiency. Moreover, the same beneficial effects are demonstrated with another binary system PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F, which suggests the applicability of such a Voc-increased ternary blended approach.

Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) can be fabricated in a number of ways, leading to properties of semitransparency, mechanical-flexibility, colour-tunability etc. They have received continuously increasing attention in the past decades. In the last five years, great progress has been made with the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching over 15% recently.1,2 However, the narrow absorption, low mobilities, and recombination of organic photovoltaic materials are the challenges of the device performance. To overcome these issues, ternary3–27 and quaternary28–32 blended approaches have been developed, which have been proven to be effective in improving efficiency with PCEs reaching over 13%.11,33–38
Compared to the fullerene backbone, the molecular structures of the nonfullerene acceptors can be directly modified to fine-tune their optical and electrochemical properties, in addition to their film-forming properties and film-morphologies. The use of two nonfullerene acceptors allows a large wide-ranging modulation in the energy levels, absorption spectra, and optical bandgap (Eoptg) of the ternary blended active layer. To this context, ternary blended solar cells with two compatible nonfullerene acceptor components have received great interest in recent years. In the fullerene-free ternary approach, the added nonfullerene acceptor, hereafter called the guest, has to comply with the aggregation of the host (the one dominating the film-morphology of the ternary blend) so that the film-morphology of the host binary can be maintained and the photo-to-electron conversion can be efficient as in the host binary. To date, the fullerene-free ternary material systems are normally designed by adding a smaller bandgap nonfullerene acceptor as the near-infrared (NIR) absorber to extend the absorption range of the active layer so as to obtain an increased short-circuit current-density (Jsc).39–48 For this Jsc-increased ternary approach, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the guest acceptor must be downshifted in order to meet the requirement to obtain a smaller bandgap. Therefore, the LUMO level of the two blended acceptors can be downshifted, which inevitably leads to a reduced open-circuit voltage (Voc).49–52 In most cases, the reduced Voc can lead to deteriorated device function.
In contrast to the Jsc-increased ternary approach, if we select a nonfullerene acceptor that has a higher LUMO level than the host acceptor as the guest nonfullerene acceptor, such a new ternary approach would allow us to obtain an increased Voc. However, this approach has been rarely reported in the literature. The challenges in designing such a Voc-increased ternary material approach are as follows: (1) the difficulty in selecting a host binary blend that should more fully cover the near-infrared (NIR) solar emission spectrum, ideally supply a large Voc over 0.8 V, and show a high fill-factor (FF) (normally > 0.7), and (2) the difficulty in selecting a guest acceptor, which not only has a properly higher LUMO level but also has a similar structure to the host so as to maintain the homogeneously fine film-morphology of the host binary and maintain (or even increase) the Jsc and/or FF along with the increased Voc. To date, only several ternary cases featuring this new ternary approach have been shown with the PCEs, reaching 11.1% with the improvement of the acceptor phase crystallinity for PSTZ:ITIC:IDIC (1:0.1:0.9),53 11.60% for J71:IT-M:ITIC (1:0.9:0.1),54 and 12.2% for PBDB-T:IT-CN:IT-4M (1:0.2:0.8).55
In this contribution, we present an impressive PCE of 16.1% achieved with this Voc-increased ternary material approach that supplies increased Voc and simultaneously improved FF, while the large short-circuit current-density (Jsc) of the host binary device is maintained. Recently, a fused benzothiadiazole-based nonfullerene acceptor named Y6 (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))-bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile) was reported with a PCE of 15.7% when using PM6 as the pairing donor polymer.1 Herein, we selected another wide bandgap donor polymer (PBDB-T-SF)56 to pair with Y6 in a donor:acceptor weight ratio of 1:1.2 (Fig. 1b). A 15.2% efficiency is obtained from the PBDB-T-SF:Y6 binary solar cell.

Then, we built upon this new binary host and chose ITCT (3,9-bis(5-methylene-4-one-6-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-cyclopenta[c]thiophen)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-n-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene)57–59 as the guest acceptor. The rational design is based on the following considerations. First, ITCT has a properly higher LUMO level than Y6, which benefits the achievement of an even higher Voc when blended with the host binary: a Voc of 0.98 V and 0.86 V is obtained from the ITCT and Y6 binary devices, respectively. Second, ITCT and Y6 are structurally similar − both molecules are constructed with a dimalononitrile-substituted coplanar indanone-like fused-ring (called IC-2F and CT, respectively) as the end electron-accepting (A) units and thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno fused-ring as the electron-donating (D) core. The structural similarity between ITCT and Y6 helps to maintain the film morphology of the host binary. Our results clearly demonstrate that the homogenously fine film morphology and the π–π stacking patterns of the host binary are both well maintained after a small amount of Y6 is replaced with ITCT (Y6:ITCT = 1.1:0.1). Moreover, with the replacement of the host Y6 by a small amount of ITCT, longer and larger donor and acceptor phases are formed and the donor and acceptor phase crystallinities are increased. The hole and electron mobilities are increased and the monomolecular and bimolecular recombination is reduced, both of which account for the improvement in the device FF and the maintenance of the Jsc. The same beneficial effects are again demonstrated with another host binary system, PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F, by replacing a small amount of IT-4F with ITCT to form a ternary blend in a weight ratio of 1:0.9:0.1, which results in a PCE of 13.7% for the ternary solar cell in comparison to the 12.8% efficiency of the host binary device.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1c gives the film absorption spectra of the donor polymer and the nonfullerene acceptors. The optical bandgap (Eoptg) was calculated to be 1.77 eV for PBDB-T-SF, 1.52 eV for ITCT, 1.51 eV for IT-4F, and 1.31 eV for Y6. The absorption spectrum of PBDB-T-SF is complementary with that of IT-4F, and the red-shifted absorption of Y6 allows the absorption of its blend film with the polymer to more fully cover the NIR solar emission spectrum, which is expected to give a larger Jsc than the IT-4F-based solar cell. The absorption of ITCT is a little blue-shifted to the absorption of IT-4F and complementary to that of Y6.

Fig. 1d is the diagram of the energy levels of the polymer and nonfullerene acceptors, which were calculated from their cyclic voltammetry (CV) data with the CV experiments performed under the same conditions (Fig. S1, ESI†). The LUMO of ITCT is positioned between the LUMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the host acceptor Y6 and IT-4F, with an energy offset of 0.25 eV lower than the LUMO of the polymer and 0.19–0.23 eV higher than the LUMOs of Y6 and IT-4F. The HOMO energy of ITCT was −5.60 eV, which is lower than the HOMO of the polymer by 0.03 eV. Moreover, the HOMO of ITCT was higher than the HOMO of IT-4F by 0.11 eV and parallel to the HOMO of Y6. Therefore, the energy levels of ITCT match with the energies of the polymer and the two nonfullerene hosts, which means that ITCT can be used as the guest acceptor component with these two binary blended systems.
Since ITCT has a higher LUMO level than Y6, the mixing of ITCT with Y6 (such as in a weight ratio of 1:0.1, 1:0.2, and 1:0.5) gave a higher LUMO level than Y6. The estimated LUMO levels for the mixtures above were −4.08 eV, −4.06 eV, and −4.03 eV, respectively. Similarly, the mixing of ITCT with IT-4F in the same ratios also gave a higher LUMO level than IT-4F with a value of −4.12 eV, −4.10 eV, and −4.07 eV. The CV data of the mixtures are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The increased LUMO level with the mixing of ITCT will help in supply an increased Voc of the Y6- and IT-4F-based solar cells.
The photovoltaic properties of these two ternary systems were investigated using a normal device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS60/active layer/PDINO/Al. Here, PDINO is amino N-oxide perylene diimide.61 The weight ratio of the Y6-based binary and ternary is 1:1.2 and 1:1.1:0.1, respectively. For the IT-4F binary and ternary systems, the weight ratio is 1:1 and 1:0.9:0.1, respectively. A thermal annealing process at 80 °C for 10 min was applied to fabricate the active layer. The optimizations are shown in Table S1 (ESI†) for the Y6 binary and its ternary devices and Table S2 (ESI†) for the IT-4F binary and its ternary devices.
For the PBDB-T-SF:Y6 binary system, the best binary device showed a PCE of 15.18% with Voc = 0.864 V, Jsc = 24.68 mA cm−2, and FF = 71.19%. Due to the higher LUMO level of ITCT, the Voc was 0.981 V for the PBDB-T-SF:ITCT device and the PCE was 10.92%. After the 0.1 weight ratio of Y6 in its binary host was replaced with ITCT, the resulting ternary device supplied an impressive PCE of 16.14%. As expected, the Voc of the ternary device increased to 0.885 V. Simultaneously, the device FF is increased from 71.19% (Y6 binary) to 73.67% (Y6 ternary) and the Jsc is maintained at 24.75 mA cm−2. We sent an Y6-based ternary device to the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China and received a certified PCE of 15.0% (Fig. S3, ESI†). Fig. 2a gives the current-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the Y6-based binary and ternary solar cells, and Table 1 summarizes their photovoltaic data.

We again introduced ITCT as the guest into the PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F binary blend by replacing the 0.1 weight ratio amount of IT-4F. The best ternary device with a weight ratio of 1:0.9:0.1 exhibits a PCE of 13.67%, a Voc of 0.888 V, an FF of 76.23%, and a Jsc of 20.19 mA cm−2. Compared to the IT-4F host binary, the Voc is increased by 0.024 V and the FF is increased by 2.72%, while the Jsc remains stable.

Fig. 2c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the Y6- and IT-4F-based binary and ternary devices. The EQE response of the Y6-based binary and ternary covers the wavelength range from 300 to 960 nm. The 840–960 nm EQE of the ternary device is reduced, which reflects the replacement of a small amount of Y6 by the guest ITCT. The integrated Jsc from the EQE spectrum is 24.01 and 23.84 mA cm−2 for the Y6 ternary and binary devices, respectively, which is consistent with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V measurement. For the IT-4F system, the replacement of the 0.1 weight ratio of IT-4F with a 0.1 weight ratio of ITCT can be again reflected by the small reduction of EQE in the wavelength of 730–850 nm. The integrated Jsc from the EQE spectrum is 19.03 and 19.26 mA cm−2 for the IT-4F binary and ternary devices, respectively, which agrees with the Jsc value calculated from the J–V curve.
The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the binary and ternary solar cell blends were measured with the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The dark J–V data obtained from the hole-only and electron-only devices are given in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The estimated μh and μe values are shown in Fig. 3. The μh increased from 1.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the Y6 binary to 1.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PBDB-T-SF:Y6:ITCT (1:1.1:0.1) ternary. Moreover, the μe is increased from 2.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the Y6 binary to 2.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the Y6 ternary. As a result, the electron and hole mobilities of the Y6 ternary blend became a little more balanced in comparison to the Y6 binary (1.77 vs. 1.87, Table 2). For the IT-4F system, increased electron (2.61 vs. 2.35 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole (2.16 vs. 1.53 cm2 V−1 s−1) mobilities are both observed as a 0.1 weight ratio of the IT-4F is replaced with a 0.1 weight ratio of the ITCT. The electron and hole mobilities of the IT-4F ternary are more balanced in comparison to its binary blend (1.21 vs. 1.54, Table 2). The balanced hole and electron mobilities are one reason for the increased FF.

For both the Y6 and IT-4F ternary systems, a larger value of hole mobility is obtained, which could be because the ITCT binary shows a larger hole mobility than the Y6 and IT-4F binary systems. Interestingly, a larger electron mobility is even observed for the Y6 and IT-4F ternary blends although the ITCT binary shows a smaller value of electron mobility than the Y6 and IT-4F binary blend.
The dark J–V curves of the optimal binary and ternary solar cells (Fig. 2d) were measured to disclose the increased FF. The Y6 ternary device exhibits a relatively lower leakage current in the low voltage regime than the Y6 binary, which can be due to its higher shunt resistance (Rsh) (5.3 vs. 3.4 kΩ cm2). Moreover, the series resistance (Rs) is decreased from 5.3 Ω cm2 (Y6 binary) to 4.2 Ω cm2 (Y6 ternary). The reduced series resistance and increased shunt resistance are another reason for the increased FF and the maintenance of Jsc. For the IT-4F system, the Rs decreased from 6.1 Ω cm2 to 5.4 kΩ cm2 and the Rsh slightly reduced from 3.2 to 3.0 kΩ cm2 after the 0.1 weight ratio of IT-4F is replaced with ITCT. The reduced series resistance and the more balanced charge mobilities (1.2 vs. 1.5) could be the reasons for the increased FF.
Light dependent J–V experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of the added ITCT on the charge collection and recombination mechanisms, from which the relationships between Voc/Jsc and light intensity (P)62 were plotted and are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The recombination at open-circuit can be reflected in the plot of the Voc as a function of the light intensity (P) by following eqution Voc ∝ n(KT/q)ln(P), where K, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge, respectively. Normally, the fitting n value is between 1.0 and 2.0 for the fullerene-free devices. The smaller n value suggests a reduced monomolecular recombination. The recombination at the short-circuit condition can be related to the plot of Jsc as a function of light intensity in a power law equation Jsc ∝ Pα. The fitting α value is usually between 0.9 and 1.0 and an α value close to 1.0 suggests a reduced bimolecular recombination. The fitting n/α values from the Y6- and IT-4F-based binary and ternary devices are shown in Fig. 4a. Compared to the host binary, either Y6- or IT-4F-based, the ternary device has a smaller n value and an α value closer to 1.0 again, which strongly suggests a reduced monomolecular and bimolecular recombination and explains the increased device FF.

We again measured photocurrent (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. S6, ESI†)63 with Veff = VBI − Vbias, where VBI is the voltage when Jph = 0 mA cm−2 and Vbias is the applied voltage; Jph = JD − JL, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. On the Jph–Veff plot, the Jph becomes saturated at the high applied voltage (Veff ≥ 2.0 V). This saturated photocurrent density value is named Jph,sat, herein, which reflects the full dissociation of the photogenerated charges at the high applied voltage. Otherwise, the Jph.sc reflects the photocurrent density collected under the short-circuit condition. The values of Jph,sat and Jph.sc of the Y6-, ITCT-, and IT-4F-based binary and ternary devices are shown in Fig. 4b. Table 2 gives the relative values of Jph.sc/Jph,sat. Comparable Jph,sat and Jph.sc values are observed for the binary and ternary devices, either for the Y6- or the IT-4F-based systems. From the Jph.sc/Jph,sat value, we can see that the collection efficiency of the photogenerated carriers at short-circuit is slightly improved for the two ternary devices in comparison to their binary counterparts.
The device FF is determined by eqution FF = (JM.P.·VM.P.)/(Jsc·Voc), where JM.P. and VM.P. are the current-density and voltage at the maximum power point, respectively. The improved FF suggests an increased collection efficiency of the photogenerated charges at the maximum power point. We then calculated the Jph value at the maximum power point, Jph.M.P. (shown in Fig. 4b) and further calculated the charge collection efficiency, Jph.M.P./Jph,sat and Jph.M.P./Jph,sc, relative to the Jph,sat and Jph.sc, respectively. The calculations are given in Table 2. We can see that both Jph.M.P./Jph,sat and Jph.M.P./Jph,sc values obtained from the ternary devices show an increase compared to their host binary systems. Moreover, if we compare the value of either Jph.sc/Jph,sat, Jph.M.P./Jph,sat, or Jph.M.P./Jph,sc with the device FF, we find that the changing tendency of Jph.M.P./Jph,sat or Jph.M.P./Jph,sc is in a better agreement with the tendency of the device FF. This suggests that the charge collection efficiency value related to the Jph at the maximum power point is a reflection of the device FF.
To see changes of the film-morphology of the host binary when the host acceptor is replaced by the guest ITCT in a small amount (0.1 weight ratio), we first collected the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the binary and ternary blends (Fig. 5a–e). We can see that the homogeneously fine film morphology of the binary host, either for the Y6 or the IT-4F binary blend, is well maintained (at their fine nanoscale level) after a 0.1 weight ratio amount of the host acceptor component was replace with ITCT, which is consistent with the high device FF. Moreover, distinct changes were also observed with the replacement of the host with ITCT. For the Y6-based system, larger acceptor (dark) domains with fine interpenetrating networks were clearly seen for the ternary device. The formation of the larger acceptor domains is in accordance with the increased electron mobility. Similarly, the same changes can be seen on the IT-4F ternary compared to its binary blend.

The film-morphology was again characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 5f–j (height) and 5k–o (phase). A finer fibril morphology is seen for the Y6 binary, while much larger and longer bright fibers are clearly seen for the ITCT binary. Upon addition of ITCT, albeit using only 0.1 weight ratio of ITCT to replace the host acceptor, larger sized fibril structures (bright, donor-rich phase) and larger dark domains (acceptor-rich) are clearly seen. The phase separation has been improved, as suggested by the formation of the larger donor and acceptor rich phases. The dark domains are observed to be connected in the interpenetrating network way. The same changes are seen on the images of the morphology of the IT-4F-based systems. The observations of the film morphology can explain the increased hole and electron mobilities, as indicated by the formation of large donor and acceptor phases, and explain the increased FF, as suggested by the improved phase separation.
To gain insightful information on the molecular packing and crystallinity of the polymer and Y6 in the thin films before and after the addition of a small amount of ITCT, we collected the graze-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) data (Fig. 6). The GIWAXS data of the neat Y6, PBDB-T-SF, and ITCT are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). For Y6, the face-on π–π stacking is indicated by the strong scattering of the (010) signal around 1.77 Å−1 (d = ∼3.55 Å) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and the lamellar signal around 0.28 Å−1 (d = ∼22.4 Å) in the in-plane (IP) direction. The peak around 0.42 Å−1 (d = ∼14.8 Å) seen in the in-plane direction may originate from the backbone ordering previously found in Y6.1,64 For the polymer, the face-on π–π stacking is suggested by the weak signal at 1.74 Å−1 (d = ∼3.61 Å) in the OOP direction. Its lamellar signals appear in both the OOP and IP directions, positioned at around 0.32 Å−1 (d = ∼19.6 Å) and 0.27 Å11 (d = ∼23.3 Å), respectively.
 Fig. 6  2-D GIWAXS images (a–c) and the linecut profiles (d–f) of the Y6 binary (PBDB-T-SF:Y6 = 1:1.2, a and d), Y6 ternary (PBDB-T-SF:Y6:ITCT = 1:1.1:0.1, b and e), and ITCT binary (PBDB-T-SF:ITCT = 1:1, c and f), respectively. 
As Y6 is blended with the polymer to form a binary blend, the strong scattering around 1.77 Å−1 in the OOP direction is mainly attributed to Y6 because the polymer shows weak signals at this place. The IP 0.28 Å−1 may result from the combination of the lamellar signals of the polymer and Y6. The scattering patterns, such as the face-on π–π stacking and compacted lamellar packing, are well kept as the 0.1 weight ratio of Y6 in the PBDB-T-SF:Y6 binary is replaced with a 0.1 weight ratio of ITCT to form the ternary blend. The crystalline correlation length (CCL) related to the face-on π–π stacking ordering of Y6 may be estimated from the OOP 1.77 Å−1 signal. The CCL value is increased slightly from 4.0 nm (binary) to 4.5 nm (ternary). In addition, the lamellar packing ordering of the PBDB-T-SF:Y6 binary is also increased with the CCL value going from 16.2 nm (binary) to 18.7 nm (ternary). The increased donor and acceptor phase crystallinity is in accordance with the increased hole and electron mobilities.
Conclusions
In summary, we observed that the guest ITCT complied well with the aggregation of the newly reported Y6. The synergy between Y6 and the structurally similar guest ITCT enabled the formation of larger phase-domains and increased phase-crystallinity, and simultaneously, the maintenance of the homogeneously nanoscaled fine film-morphology and the retention of the π–π stacking pattern of the host binary system. The replacement of a 0.1 weight ratio amount of Y6 with a 0.1 weight ratio amount of the higher-LUMO-level ITCT enabled the attainment of an increased Voc with increased charge mobilities and a reduced recombination, which resulted in the improved device FF and the maintenance of the larger Jsc of the host binary. A highly efficient ternary blended material system with 16.1%-efficiency was then attained and is reported here. This ternary material approach was designed on the basis of a new host binary system of PBDB-T-SF:Y6, which supplied an efficiency of 15.2%, and the higher LUMO level of the guest ITCT was one of the reasons for the increased Voc.

New concepts
The ternary blended approach has been proven to be effective in improving device function and performance with increased efficiency. Along with the success in the fullerene-free binary blended polymer solar cells, the use of two compatible nonfullerene acceptors continues to receive increasing interest. To date, this fullerene-free ternary blended approach is usually designed by selecting a small bandgap nonfullerene acceptor as the near infrared absorber to achieve an increased short-circuit current-density (Jsc). In order to reduce the optical bandgap of the added nonfullerene acceptor, its energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) has to be down-shifted, which usually leads to a reduced open-circuit voltage (Voc), and therefore, a reduced efficiency in most cases. This issue (i.e., the reduced Voc) can be overcome by selecting a higher-LUMO-level nonfullerene acceptor as the guest. As demonstrated in this study, we achieved a new binary system with PBDB-T-SF as the donor polymer and the newly reported Y6 as the host nonfullerene acceptor, which shows an efficiency of 15.2%, and we selected ITCT as the higher-LUMO-level acceptor guest. We found that the guest ITCT complies well with the aggregation of Y6, leading to the effective maintenance of the homogeneously nanoscaled fine film-morphology and π–π stacking pattern of the Y6 binary. More interestingly, the guest ITCT further improved the morphology with the formation of larger phase domains and increased phase crystallinity. As a result, this synergy of the host Y6 with the higher-LUMO-level ITCT benefits in obtaining an increased Voc with the concurrent increase in electron and hole mobilities and a reduction in recombination, leading to an improved device fill-factor while maintaining the device Jsc, and hence, improved device efficiency. Moreover, the same beneficial effects are demonstrated with another binary system PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F, which suggests the applicability of such a Voc-increased ternary blended approach.
