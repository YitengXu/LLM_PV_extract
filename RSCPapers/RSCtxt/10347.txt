    , Accepted 27th December 2022First published on 27th December 2022AbstractPbS QDs have attracted considerable interest in optoelectronics. However, their high susceptibility to oxidation results in the production of Pb oxides on PbS, which can induce sub-bandgap traps in PbS QDs that are detrimental to the performance of the resultant device. Here we report a facile strategy to enhance the film quality of PbS QD solids through an in situ surface etching and passivation route, carried out by immersing the PbS QD solid film in an I−/I2 solution at room temperature in ambient air. The process is simple and allows for the simultaneous removal of surface Pb oxides and the formation of a PbI2 passivation layer on PbS QDs, leading to the elimination of traps in PbS QDs while preserving their optical properties and film morphology. As a result, charge recombination within the film is suppressed and charge carrier transport is enhanced. When used to fabricate a quantum dot sensitized solar cell, a large increase in cell performance was achieved.
1 Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have attracted considerable interest due to their tunable optical and electronic properties that enable their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.1–5 Of particular interest is PbS, which has been extensively studied for various applications, such as near-infrared (NIR) photodetectors and solar cells,6–10 because of its brilliant optical and electrical properties of a narrow bandgap, a large Bohr radius, and a high absorption coefficient as well as potential multiple exciton generation. Although great progress has been achieved through surface and energy band engineering as well as device architecture optimization, further improvements in device performance are required to make them competitive.
It is well known that the surfaces of QDs are very important in determining their physical and chemical properties owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio, whereas appropriate terminations on the QD surface can efficiently passivate its defect sites and hence improve the charge transport in a QD solid film and the performances of the resultant devices.11–14 Therefore, enormous efforts have been made to control the surface terminations on PbS QDs. For example, by varying the surface ligands of PbS QDs through a ligand exchange strategy, Brown et al. found that the energy levels of PbS QDs can be adjusted to improve the performance of the corresponding device.11 Azmi et al. examined the effect of surface ligands on the quality of PbS QDs, and found that the efficient surface passivation of PbS QDs by 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (PDMII) reduced the sub-bandgap trap-states in QDs, leading to improved device performance.12 More recently, Mandal et al. reported that hybrid passivation on PbS QDs with inorganic lead halides and 2-cloro-1-propanethiol can efficiently suppress the detrimental traps on PbS, resulting in a large improvement in device performance.13
On the other hand, it is also known that PbS QD solids are highly susceptible to oxidation when exposed to an oxidative gas such as ambient air, resulting in the formation of lead oxides.15–19 The formed lead oxides attached to PbS QDs are proved to produce sub-band defects that influence the electronic properties of PbS QD solids and degrade device performance.20–22 Therefore, the removal of Pb oxides and/or protecting them from oxidation are of great importance for achieving high-quality PbS solids to enhance device performance. For instance, by exchanging oleic acid on PbS QDs with various surface ligands through a solid-state ligand exchange route, Goswami et al. found that a higher degree of surface passivation with short ligands efficiently diminished the surface oxidation of PbS QDs and enhanced the open-circuit voltage of the resultant solar cell.23 Choi et al. reported that the introduction of additional KI on the PbS QD surface stands in the way of oxidation of PbS QDs, leading to an enhancement in the photovoltaic performance of the cell.24 Heo et al. reported that the introduction of an MAPbI3 layer by spin-coating the perovskite solution (MAPbI3/DMF solution) on PbS QD sensitized TiO2 film can remove the Pb oxides on PbS QDs. As a result, the surface defects on PbS QDs are decreased, leading to a large enhancement in the cell efficiency of a solid-state PbS quantum dot-sensitized solar cell.25
To improve the film quality of a PbS QD solid, we report herein a simple route to remove Pb oxides on PbS QDs through an efficient in situ surface etching and passivation process by I−/I2 treatment, carried out by immersing the film in a methoxypropionitrile solution containing I− and I2. This process can simultaneously remove the surface oxides and produce a PbI2 passivation layer on PbS, which in turn leads to a reduction in the surface traps of PbS QDs and a decrease in charge recombination in the film. By using the I−/I2-treated PbS solid to fabricate a quantum dot sensitized solar cell, a large enhancement in cell performance was achieved.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of PbS quantum dot film
PbS quantum dot film was prepared by depositing PbS QDs onto porous TiO2 film through a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) route. Porous TiO2 film was obtained by coating commercial P25 (Degussa) through a doctor-blade method: firstly, a thin and compact TiO2 underlayer was coated on the precleaned FTO (F-doped SnO2, resistance 7 Ω sq−1, Hake New Energy Co. Ltd, Harbin) substrate by pyrolysis of TiCl4. Then, nanoporous TiO2 film was prepared by coating commercial P25 (Degussa) through a doctor-blade method. Finally, a mixture of large-sized TiO2 (L-TiO2, 300 nm–500 nm) and P25 (L-TiO2:P25 = 7:3 in weight) was coated on top of the TiO2 film. After drying in air, the resulting film was sintered for 30 minutes at 450 °C. PbS was deposited on TiO2 by successively dipping the TiO2 film into 0.02 M Pb(AC)2 in methanol and 0.02 M Na2S in methanol/water (1:1 in volume) mixture for 1 min each, while the sample was thoroughly rinsed with methanol between dips to remove excess precursor. One dipping in both precursor solutions is referred to as 1 cycle and the SILAR cycle was done twice. After that, ZnS was deposited through the SILAR process using the two separate aqueous solutions of 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and 0.1 M Na2S, and the film was denoted TiO2/PbS.
2.2 I−/I2 treatment
I−/I2 treatment was carried out at room temperature in ambient air, by immersing the TiO2/PbS film in a 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN, Alfa Aesar) solution containing 0.05 M iodine (Acros) and 0.5 M lithium iodide (Acros) for 3 min followed by thorough rinsing with MPN and drying in air.
2.3 Fabrication of PbS quantum dot sensitized solar cell (QDSSC)
QDSSCs were assembled into a sandwich structure as reported previously,26 where PbS-sensitized TiO2 was used as the working electrode, PbS on a brass plate was used as the counter electrode and a polysulfide aqueous electrolyte was composed of 2.0 M S, 2.0 M Na2S and 0.2 M KCl with 5% SiO2 (Aladdin, ∼7 nm).
2.4 Characterizations
Vis-NIR absorption spectra were measured using a UV-4150 spectrometer (Shimadzu). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALab 250XI). The spectrometer was calibrated using the C 1s (284.8 eV) signal. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out using a Hitachi S-4800 instrument. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra were recorded with an SU-8010 instrument.
Photocurrent–voltage measurements were carried out with a Keithley 2602 unit under illumination by simulated sunlight (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The incident light was calibrated with a power meter (model 350) and a detector (model 262). The active area of the cell was 0.2 cm2. Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a 500 W xenon lamp combined with a monochromator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at open-circuit voltage under illumination, using a frequency response analyzer (Solartron 1255B) coupled with an electrochemical interface system (Solartron Analytical SI, 1287). The frequency range was 10−1–105 Hz. Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were measured using a green-light-emitting diode (λmax = 520 nm) driven by a Solartron 1255B frequency-response analyzer, where an LED provided both dc and ac components of the illumination.
3 Results and discussion
PbS QD films were obtained by depositing PbS QDs on the TiO2 surface through a SILAR route followed by ZnS deposition, while I−/I2 treatment was carried out by immersing the PbS film in an I−/I2 solution, as stated in the Experimental section. SEM investigations show that the film is highly porous with a thickness of ca.18 μm (Fig. 1a), which is not affected by the I−/I2 treatment (Fig. S1 in ESI†). Fig. 1b–d show the elemental mapping of Pb, S and I throughout the film thickness in the rectangular area indicated in Fig. 1(a). The well-distributed Pb and S in the whole film indicate that PbS QDs homogeneously cover TiO2 particles (Fig. 1(b) and (c)). Note that, after I−/I2 treatment, element I was detected, which is uniformly distributed found throughout the whole film. Since I was not detected before I−/I2 treatment (Fig. S1 in ESI†), this result suggests that I is incorporated into the film during I−/I2 treatment.

Fig. 2A shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectra of TiO2/PbS film with and without I−/I2 treatment. The appearance of the characteristic peaks of Pb and S confirmed the deposition of PbS on TiO2. Compared with the sample without I−/I2 treatment, we found that I−/I2 treatment leads to the appearance of new peaks at 619.0 eV and 630.6 eV, which correspond to the I 3d signal.27,28 This is in accordance with the EDX analyses, confirming the incorporation of I into TiO2/PbS film during I−/I2 treatment. Fig. 2B–D show the high-resolution XPS spectra of Pb 4f, S 2p and I 3d for the film before and after I−/I2 treatment with peak positions indicating different species identified by spectrum deconvolution. The Pb 4f spectrum for the pristine film shows main peaks at 137.58 eV and 142.44 eV, consistent with Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 of PbS.29,30 The peaks at higher binding energies of 138.77 eV and 143.63 eV are assigned to Pb 4f in PbSO4, indicating the presence of PbSO4 in the pristine PbS/TiO2 film,28,31 which is further confirmed by the high-resolution S 2p spectrum. As shown in Fig. 2C, one can see that, except for the main peaks at 161.64 eV and 162.84 eV originating from S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 of PbS, the as-prepared TiO2/PbS film also displays peaks at higher binding energy (168.25 eV and 169.45 eV), ascribable to PbSO4.28,32 The presence of PbSO4 is ascribed to the partial oxidation of PbS during the SILAR process for preparing TiO2/PbS film as it is processed in an ambient atmosphere. It is worth noting that, when the sample was subjected to I−/I2 treatment, the XPS peaks of Pb 4f and S 2p relating to PbSO4 disappeared (Fig. 2B and C), indicating the removal of PbSO4 by I−/I2 treatment. In the meantime, we found that, after I−/I2 treatment, additional new peaks at binding energies of 138.28 eV and 143.14 eV appeared in the Pb 4f spectrum (Fig. 2B), indicative of the formation of PbI2.33 This is further identified by the high-resolution I 3d spectrum, which displayed new peaks at 619.0 eV and 630.6 eV corresponding to I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2 of PbI2 for the I−/I2-treated sample (Fig. 2D).27,28 These results suggest that I−/I2 treatment results in the removal of PbSO4 and the simultaneous formation of PbI2.

Fig. 3 compares the absorption spectra of TiO2/PbS film with and without I−/I2 treatment. Due to its small bandgap of PbS, TiO2/PbS film displays broad absorption throughout the UV-vis-NIR region, which is expected to be of great benefit for achieving efficient light harvesting. Note that the film treated by I−/I2 gives almost the same absorption spectrum as the sample without I−/I2 treatment, suggesting that I−/I2 treatment does not influence the optical absorption property of TiO2/PbS film in our case. By plotting (Ahv)2vs. hv as shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the band gap of PbS QD was calculated to be 1.41 eV, corresponding to a particle size of ca. 4 nm irrespective of I−/I2 treatment. The larger bandgap of PbS QDs compared to PbS bulk (0.41 eV) is attributed to the quantum size effect of PbS QDs.

The charge carrier recombination kinetics of TiO2/PbS film treated by I−/I2 was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), where PbS and polysulfide aqueous solution were used as the counter electrode (CE) and electrolyte, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the Nyquist and Bode plots of the TiO2/PbS film before and after I−/I2 treatment in open-circuit conditions under irradiation. As the same counter electrode and electrolyte were used in both cases, we focused our investigations on the TiO2/PbS electrode. The charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte is obtained by fitting the impedance data using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 4A, where Rs is the equivalent series resistance, and R1, CPE1 and R2, CPE2 represent the charge transfer resistance and chemical capacitance at the CE/electrolyte and TiO2/PbS/electrolyte interfaces. The charge recombination rate constant (keff) at the TiO2/PbS/electrolyte interface and the steady-state electron density (ns) in the TiO2 conduction band were further calculated using the equations:34,35 (1)where fmax is the frequency at the maximum of the Bode plots in Fig. 4B, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, and A and L represent the area and thickness of the TiO2/PbS film, respectively. The obtained parameters are summarized in Table 1. As displayed, we found that the I−/I2-treated sample had lower R2 and keff than pristine TiO2/PbS film, suggesting that I−/I2 treatment efficiently reduced the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, we noted that I−/I2 treatment increased the steady-state electron density ns in the conduction band of TiO2. Because of the identical optical absorption properties before and after I−/I2 treatment, this result indicates that I−/I2 treatment increased the electron injection from PbS QDs to TiO2, which can be ascribed to the decreased surface traps on PbS, as will be discussed below.

It is well known that lowered charge recombination within quantum dot film is beneficial for enhancing the performance of the resultant optoelectrical device. On this basis, we constructed a sandwich-structured QDSSC using the I−/I2-treated TiO2/PbS film as the photoanode and PbS on Pb as the counter electrode together with a sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) aqueous solution containing SiO2 nanoparticles as the electrolyte, and their photovoltaic properties were characterized by measuring the current–voltage (J–V) behaviour. The upper part of Fig. 5A shows the typical J–V curves of the QDSSCs under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), while the corresponding open-circuit voltages (Voc), short-circuit current densities (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and overall solar-to-energy conversion efficiencies (η) are tabulated in Table 2 and the parameters based on five cells are shown in Table S (ESI†). Without I−/I2 treatment, the device achieved a Voc of 386 mV, Jsc of 18.84 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.551, leading to an overall solar-to-energy conversion efficiency of 4.0%. As expected, when I−/I2 treatment was performed, obvious increases in both Voc and Jsc were observed, which results in a large increase of the cell efficiency from 4.0% to 4.82%. The lower part of Fig. 5A shows the J–V curves of QDSSCs in the dark. The decreased dark current for the device with I−/I2-treated TiO2/PbS film indicates its reduced charge recombination, which is in accordance with the EIS analyses (Fig. 4). The incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCEs) of QDSSC with TiO2/PbS film before and after I−/I2 treatment are shown in Fig. 5B. The device treated by I−/I2 exhibits an obviously higher IPCE throughout the entire spectrum compared with the device without I−/I2 treatment. This is consistent with the variation trend of Jsc, as shown in Fig. 5A, verifying the beneficial role of I−/I2 treatment in enhancing the photocurrent of the QDSSC. In controlled experiments, we fabricated CdS and CdS/CdSe QDSSCs through a similar procedure to PbS QDSSC using CdS and CdS/CdSe instead of PbS. Cell performance investigations show that I−/I2 treatment does not lead to an increase in cell performance for either CdS or CdS/CdSe QDs (Fig. S2 in ESI†). Also, we found that the treatment of TiO2/PbS film with bare MPN does not increase the cell performance of the resulting QDSSC. These results indicate that the beneficial role of I−/I2 treatment is closely related to PbS QDs.

Fig. 6 shows the IMPS and IMVS spectra of the QDSSC with TiO2/PbS film before and after I−/I2 treatment. The electron transit time (τd) and electron lifetime (τn) were calculated from τd(τn) = 1/2πfmin, where fmin is the frequency at the minimum of IMPS/IMVS.36,37 As shown in the figure, we found that the I−/I2-treated sample had a shorter transit time and longer electron lifetime compared to the film without I−/I2 treatment. The lowered τd and increased τn suggest that the transport rate of electrons across the TiO2/PbS film is increased and the charge recombination in the film is reduced upon I−/I2 treatment.

Fig. 7 shows the dependence of Voc of the cell on light intensity (I). It has been demonstrated that the dependence of Voc on the light intensity of a cell can be expressed as:38 (2)where n is the ideality factor, C is a constant, and k, q, and T represent the Boltzmann constant, the electron charge and the absolute temperature. The ideality factor n is closely related to recombination in the device, while an n close to 1 indicates that band-to-band recombination is dominant. By fitting the data in Fig. 7 with eqn (2), the ideality factor was obtained, which shows a decrease from 1.32 for the untreated sample to 1.24 for the I−/I2-treated device. The lowered n value reveals that I−/I2 treatment reduced the trap-assisted charge recombination in the device, in accordance with the EIS, IMPS/IMVS and dark current investigations.

The above results clearly indicate that I−/I2 treatment by simply immersing TiO2/PbS film in I−/I2 solution improved the film quality of PbS solid, due to the removal of Pb oxides and the simultaneous formation of a PbI2 passivation layer on PbS QDs, leading to a reduction in charge recombination in the film and enhanced injection efficiency of photogenerated electrons from the QDs to TiO2. As a result, a QDSSC fabricated with I−/I2-treated TiO2/PbS film exhibits much higher cell efficiency than a device with pristine TiO2/PbS film. Considering the importance of the QD surface, the beneficial role of I−/I2 treatment is ascribed to its ability to eliminate the defects on PbS QDs. It is known that PbS QDs are apt to oxidize under oxidizing conditions, such as in an ambient atmosphere,19 which was also confirmed by our XPS investigations (Fig. 2). The formation of oxides will produce surface defects in PbS QDs that further induce charge recombination by trapping the photogenerated electrons (Scheme 1).39 Therefore, the removal of the surface oxides by I−/I2 treatment can eliminate the surface oxide defects on PbS QDs, whereas the PbI2 produced is simultaneously deposited on PbS QDs, decreasing the charge recombination in the film (Scheme 1). The lowered charge recombination in TiO2/PbS film leads to faster charge transport within the film and higher electron injection from the QDs to TiO2, contributing to the enhanced photocurrent. The enhanced Jsc together with the lowered dark current increased the Voc, consequently leading to a large improvement in cell efficiency. It should be mentioned that the PbI2 deposited on PbS QDs can also protect PbS QDs from further oxidation and etching, and hence stabilize the PbS QDs. To test the stability of the I−/I2-treated film, we measured the photocurrent of the resultant QDSSC as a function of illumination time. As illustrated in Fig. S3,† we found that the photocurrent of QDSSC with I−/I2-treated TiO2/PbS film remains almost unchanged during the illumination period, and is more stable than a device with pristine TiO2/PbS film.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have reported an efficient and facile way to enhance the film quality of PbS QD solids through an I−/I2 redox solution based in situ surface etching and passivation process, carried out by immersing the PbS QD film in a methoxypropionitrile solution containing I− and I2. Film structure and light absorption analyses confirmed that this treatment process does not affect the structure or the optical properties of the film, but removes the Pb oxides on PbS QDs and simultaneously produces PbI2 to passivate and protect PbS QDs. Charge carrier recombination kinetics investigations show that the I−/I2 treatment leads to a decrease in charge recombination and an increase in electron injection from the PbS QDs to TiO2, ascribable to the suppressed surface defects of PbS QDs. When applied to a QDSSC, in consequence, a large enhancement in the solar-to-energy conversion efficiency of the PbS quantum dot sensitized solar cell was achieved.
