    , Accepted 6th August 2018First published on 6th August 2018AbstractHybrid photocatalysts containing plasmonic metal and semiconductor building blocks can alleviate charge carrier recombination and broaden the range of light absorption of the semiconductor. In this work, plasmonic Au nanocrystals of different sizes and shapes (spheres and rods) are attached on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets through electrostatic attraction. The effects of the morphology and loading amount of the Au nanocrystals are carefully studied for understanding and optimizing the hybrid photocatalysts. The optimized 18 nm-sized Au nanospheres/g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibits a superior activity for H2 evolution at a rate of 540 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light (λ > 420 nm), exceeding those produced over larger-sized Au nanospheres/g-C3N4, Au nanorods/g-C3N4 and photodeposited Au nanoparticles/g-C3N4 photocatalysts. The excellent activity for H2 evolution is attributed to the electron sink and plasmonic effects of the Au nanocrystals in different spectral regions, as evidenced by photocurrent measurements. The introduced plasmonic Au nanocrystals not only enhance the photocatalytic activity, but they also endow the hybrid photocatalysts with an extended light absorption range. Our results and understanding will be useful for the design of efficient plasmonic photocatalysts for solar to fuel energy conversion as well as for other plasmon-driven chemical reactions.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen is a clean, highly efficient and carbon-free energy carrier with low environmental impact. The solar H2 generation technology by semiconductor photocatalysis has become one of the most important approaches for converting and storing solar energy since the landmark discovery of photoelectrochemical water splitting on TiO2 electrodes in 1972.1 However, due to its wide bandgap (∼3.2 eV), TiO2 is only active under ultraviolet light, which occupies ∼4% of the total sunlight energy.2 Therefore, to optimize the utilization of sunlight, much attention has been paid to the exploration of visible-light photocatalysts, as nearly one half of solar energy lies in the visible region. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets have emerged as a promising photocatalyst because of their unique electronic features and favourable thermal/chemical inertness since the pioneering study in 2009 on their use for visible-light photocatalytic water splitting.3 Yet, some drawbacks have still remained with g-C3N4, such as low visible-light absorption and severe photogenerated charge carrier recombination.4 Therefore, extensive studies have been carried out to overcome these drawbacks through morphological optimization,5,6 defect engineering,7–9 non-metal element doping10,11 and hybridization with other semiconductors.12–14
Incorporation of plasmonic metal nanoparticles (NPs) onto a semiconductor can increase the photocatalytic activity due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metal NPs. LSPR refers to the collective oscillations of free electrons in plasmonic metal NPs in resonance with an external oscillating electromagnetic field.15 The plasmonic enhancement of photocatalytic water splitting includes several mechanisms. They are (1) light absorption and scattering, (2) direct hot-electron injection, (3) plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer, and (4) plasmonic photothermal heating.15–17 Plasmonic enhancement in solar energy conversion has been applied in many areas, including photocatalytic chemical reactions,18,19 photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting,15,20 photocatalytic CO2 reduction,21,22 dye-sensitized23,24 and polymer solar cells.25
Until now, loading plasmonic metal NPs on g-C3N4 to realize plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis has mainly relied on deposition–precipitation,26,27 photodeposition28–31 and chemical reduction methods.32 In addition, three-component catalysts based on the Au/g-C3N4 system have also been synthesized and investigated.33–35 The Schottky junction formed at the metal–semiconductor interface is beneficial for electron transfer and can facilitate photocatalytic reactions.36 Plasmonic Au NPs have been reported to act as electron sinks and plasmonic sensitizers in the short- and long-wavelength spectral regions, respectively, in photodeposited Au NPs/g-C3N4.37 However, the previous methods are ineffective in controlling the size and morphology of plasmonic metal NPs, which is unfavourable for understanding the mechanisms of plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis. Therefore, it has still remained highly desirable to develop new approaches for achieving better control of the plasmon resonance wavelength and ascertain the role of metal NPs in metal/g-C3N4 systems for photocatalytic applications.
In this work, we have developed a facile method for the preparation of hybrid Au/g-C3N4 photocatalysts through electrostatic attraction, where pre-grown Au nanospheres (NSs) of different sizes and Au nanorods (NRs) of different plasmon resonance wavelengths are assembled on g-C3N4 nanosheets. The hybrid photocatalyst containing 18 nm-sized Au NSs at an optimal amount of 2.0 wt% exhibits a superior activity of 540 μmol g−1 h−1 for H2 evolution under visible light, which is about three times the rate over the catalyst made of Au NPs photodeposited on g-C3N4. The excellent activity for H2 production is understood to arise from the different electron transfer mechanisms in different spectral regions. This work provides a facile approach for designing plasmonic photocatalysts that are responsive in different spectral regions for solar-to-chemical fuel conversion as well as for various plasmon-driven chemical reactions.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the g-C3N4 nanosheets
The g-C3N4 nanosheets were synthesized by a method modified from a reported approach.12 Typically, urea powder (15 g) was placed into a lidded alumina crucible and then heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 0.3 °C min−1 in a muffle furnace, and maintained at the final temperature for 3 h. g-C3N4 nanosheets were obtained after the furnace naturally cooled down to room temperature.
2.2. Preparation of the hybrid Au/g-C3N4 nanostructures
The Au NSx and Au NRy samples were grown using a seed-mediated method as reported previously,38–40 where x and y represent the average diameter of the Au NSs and the longitudinal surface plasmon wavelength of the Au NRs, respectively.
The Au nanocrystal samples were attached on the g-C3N4 nanosheets through electrostatic attraction. Specifically, the g-C3N4 nanosheets (30 mg) were first dispersed in deionized water (200 mL) and sonicated for ∼1 h to obtain a homogenous suspension. A suitable amount of the colloidal Au nanocrystal solution with a controlled cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) concentration was then added dropwise into the g-C3N4 suspension. After being stirred for 3 h, the Au/g-C3N4 sample was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was stirred in ethanol overnight and washed separately with water and ethanol three times to fully remove the residual CTAB molecules. The weight ratio of the Au nanocrystals in the Au/g-C3N4 sample was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Au NPs/g-C3N4 and Pt NPs/g-C3N4 samples with an amount of 2.0 wt% for the metal NPs were prepared by photodeposition. Typically, HAuCl4 (0.01 M, 0.62 mL) or H2PtCl6 (0.01 M, 0.63 mL) was added to the dispersion of the g-C3N4 nanosheets (0.15 mg mL−1, 400 mL). The resultant suspension was evacuated several times to remove air and irradiated under a 300 W Xe lamp for 1 h. The hybrid nanostructure samples were collected by centrifugation and washed several times with water.
2.3. Characterization
Zeta potential measurements were performed in aqueous solutions by dynamic light scattering analysis using a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta 400 FEG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai Spirit) were carried out to observe the morphologies and structures of the samples. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed on an FEI Tecnai F20 microscope at 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation at a tube voltage and current of 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. Extinction spectra were measured on a Lambda 950 ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer). Diffuse reflectance spectra were acquired on the same spectrophotometer equipped with an integration sphere accessory using BaSO4 as a reference. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained on a Veeco Metrology system (Model No. 920-006-101) operated in the contact mode using super-sharp silicon nitride tips. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet NEXUS 670 FTIR spectrometer. Photoluminescence spectra were taken on a Hitachi F-4600 spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. Before the measurements, a homogeneous suspension was first prepared by dispersing the photocatalyst in water and sonicating the solution for at least 30 min. The photoluminescence spectra were recorded immediately afterwards to avoid the precipitation of the catalyst and ensure the reliability of the photoluminescence measurements as much as possible. ICP-MS measurements were performed on an Agilent ICP-MS 7500a system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an Escalab 250 Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific) system with Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source for excitation. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas were calculated from the adsorption data. The emission spectra of the light sources were measured with an Ocean Optics ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer.
2.4. Photocatalytic H2 production
Photocatalytic H2 generation experiments were performed in a top-irradiation vessel connected to a closed gas circulation glass system. The vessel had a double wall for cooling the reaction solution to 20 °C with circulating water. The prepared photocatalyst (0.02 g) and CTAB powder (0.26 g) were dispersed into an aqueous solution of triethanolamine (TEOA) (2.5 vol%, 40 mL). The suspension was thoroughly evacuated to remove air and irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300C, Beijing Perfectlight Technology). A cut-off filter was employed to obtain visible light (λ > 420 nm). The amount of evolved H2 was determined by gas chromatography (GC-7806, Shiweipx) with high-purity argon as the carrier gas. The stability test of the photocatalyst was performed under the same conditions for three cycles. After each cycle, the catalyst was collected by centrifugation and washed with water for reuse in the next cycle. H2 evolution under monochromatic light was observed using an appropriate bandpass filter (380, 420, 475, 520, 550, 600, 650 and 700 nm). The power intensity of the monochromatic light was measured using an optical power meter (Molectron POWER MAX 5200). The effective areas of the detector and reactor were approximately 2.83 and 38.46 cm2, respectively. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was calculated according to the equation below: (1)
2.5. Photoelectrochemical measurements
The working electrode was prepared by depositing the as-prepared sample on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate (2 cm × 1 cm). Before dip-coating, the FTO substrate was first sonicated in ethanol for ∼30 min, and then treated in a plasma cleaner for 5 min (18 W, Harrick Scientific, PDC-32G) to remove the residual organics and improve the hydrophilicity of the surface. Before deposition, the photocatalyst was dispersed in an ethanolic solution of Nafion (5.0 vol%) to produce an ink (10 mg mL−1). The electrode was obtained by drop-casting the ink onto the FTO substrate with a resultant surface area of 1 cm2. The photoelectrochemical tests were performed on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua) in a standard three-electrode system with the photocatalyst as the working electrode, the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and a Pt plate electrode as the counter electrode. An aqueous Na2SO4 solution (0.5 M) was used as the electrolyte. Mott–Schottky measurements were performed to determine the band position of the photocatalyst using the impedance–potential technique in the potential range from 0 to 1 V versus SCE. Photocurrent measurements were conducted at a potential of −0.2 V (versus SCE) under chopped visible light. Control experiments under laser irradiation at 325 and 514 nm were carried out at an optical power of 0.5 W and with a laser beam diameter of ∼0.5 cm on the electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for Nyquist plots was undertaken in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Graphitic C3N4 nanosheets and the Au NS18 sample
The SEM and TEM images of the produced g-C3N4 nanosheets are shown in Fig. 1a and b, where the silk-like feature of the two-dimensional nanosheets with some irregular holes is clearly observable. AFM imaging of a representative g-C3N4 nanosheet reveals that it has a thickness of ∼1.2 nm, which corresponds to ∼3–4 atomic g-C3N4 layers (Fig. S1a and b, ESI†). More AFM measurements reveal that the average thickness of the nanosheets is 1.5 ± 0.4 nm. From the electrochemical Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 1c), the positive slope of the linear plots indicates the typical n-type characteristic of the g-C3N4 semiconductor. The estimated flatband potential is directly regarded as the conduction band (CB) level.41 By combining with the absorption spectrum and the derived Tauc plot of g-C3N4 (Fig. 1d and e), the electronic band structure was obtained (Fig. S2, ESI†). The CB and valence band (VB) of the g-C3N4 nanosheets were calculated to be −1.029 and 1.831 V (versus the normal hydrogen electrode, NHE, pH = 0). The tail in the range of 450–530 nm in the absorption spectrum can be ascribed to the defect states produced in the g-C3N4 framework during synthesis. The defect states can be revealed in the FTIR spectrum of the g-C3N4 nanosheets (Fig. 1f). The bands observed between 3000 and 3300 cm−1 are the stretching vibrations of –NH/NH2 groups, and the weak peak at 2145 cm−1 is caused by the asymmetric stretching vibrations of cyano groups (–CN).8 The other two series of peaks in the range of 1194–1686 cm−1 and at ∼800 cm−1 can be assigned to the vibrations of C–N/CN bonds and the breathing mode of the triazine units, respectively.7

According to previous studies, optimal noble metal-based photocatalysts should combine both the superior light-harvesting properties of plasmonic NPs and the efficient photocatalytic properties of the catalytic component. If the plasmonic NPs are too large, the hybrid nanostructures will scatter light strongly and the photocatalytic activity will be reduced. If the plasmonic NPs are too small, the plasmon resonance will be largely damped and the light absorption cross-section will be small, which will also limit the catalytic activity.16,42 Therefore, the Au NS18 sample with an average diameter of 18 ± 1 nm was first chosen in our study for the preparation of the hybrid photocatalysts. The SEM and TEM images are shown in Fig. 1g and h.
3.2. Gold NS18/g-C3N4 hybrid nanostructures
The Au NS18/g-C3N4 samples were prepared through electrostatic attraction.43–45 The zeta potentials of the g-C3N4 nanosheets and the CTAB-capped, 18 nm-sized Au NSs in water were −14 and 25 mV (Fig. 2a). The opposite charges facilitate their assembly into the hybrid Au NS18/g-C3N4 nanostructures through electrostatic attraction, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 2b. The uniformity of the Au NSs deposited on the g-C3N4 nanosheets varies considerably with CTAB concentration (Fig. S3, ESI†). If the CTAB concentration is too low (<10 μM), the Au NSs tend to aggregate over the g-C3N4 nanosheets. If the CTAB concentration is too high (>100 μM), excess CTAB molecules will occupy the negatively charged surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets, preventing the adsorption of the positively charged Au NSs. The suitable CTAB concentration is 10–100 μM for the successful formation of the hybrid nanostructures. In the experiments below, unless otherwise stated, the CTAB concentration for the synthesis of the Au/g-C3N4 samples was fixed at 50 μM. We also measured the zeta potential (Fig. S4, ESI†) of the Au NS18/g-C3N4 hybrid nanostructures in the solution in which the electrostatic assembly was carried out. The resultant value was −22 mV. The difference in the zeta potential in comparison with that of the g-C3N4 nanosheets is believed to be caused by the change in the morphology of the nanosheets after the adsorption of the Au NSs. Fig. 2c shows the SEM images of the obtained Au NS18/g-C3N4 samples with different Au mass percentages, which are 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 wt% relative to the total masses of the hybrid samples. The monodisperse 18 nm-sized Au NSs are uniformly anchored on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets. Fig. 2d shows the absorption spectra of the Au NS18/g-C3N4 samples. In comparison with the extinction spectrum of the Au NSs in water, there is no clear shift in the plasmon peak, due to the small refractive index sensitivity of the Au NSs.46,47 The XRD patterns of the samples indicate the coexistence of Au and g-C3N4 (Fig. S5, ESI†). The diffraction peaks at 12.8° and 27.2° in the g-C3N4 and Au NS18/g-C3N4 samples can be assigned to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C3N4.32,48 The other five diffraction peaks located at 37.8°, 44.0°, 64.4°, 77.4° and 81.6° correspond to the characteristic peaks of Au.29

(b) Schematic illustrating the formation of the hybrid nanostructure through electrostatic attraction. (c) SEM images of the hybrid nanostructure samples with Au loading amounts of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 wt%, respectively. (d) Absorption spectra of the hybrid nanostructure samples and extinction spectrum of the Au NS18 sample. (e) Photoluminescence spectra of the g-C3N4 and hybrid nanostructure samples in aqueous solutions. 
To study the separation and radiative recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, photoluminescence measurements were performed in the aqueous suspensions of the nanostructure samples (0.5 mg mL−1) under excitation at 350 nm (Fig. 2e). The main emission peak centered at 460 nm can be attributed to the interband transition of the g-C3N4 nanosheets.29 The creation of surface states or defects within the crystal structure of g-C3N4 can affect its electronic structure.49 Therefore, we believe that the emission shoulder at ∼500 nm might arise from defect states in the bandgap.7,50 Another noticeable point is that the emission intensity of the Au NS18/g-C3N4 samples is reduced compared with that of the pure g-C3N4 nanosheets. This result suggests that the radiative recombination probability is reduced to some extent due to electron transfer from the g-C3N4 nanosheets to the Au NSs at the interface. To rule out the absorption of the Au NSs in the emission reduction of g-C3N4, the extinction spectra of the representative Au NS18/g-C3N4 samples were taken in 0.5 mg mL−1 aqueous suspensions (Fig. S6, ESI†). The location of the plasmon resonance peak of the Au NS18/g-C3N4 samples at 530 nm and its weak intensity suggest that the emission of g-C3N4 caused by the radiative recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is hardly absorbed by the Au NSs. XPS measurements were also performed to determine the chemical states of the involved elements (Fig. S7, ESI†). The C/N molar ratio was found to be 0.72 for the g-C3N4 nanosheets (Table S1, ESI†), further confirming their imperfect structure. The result that the C/N molar ratio is not exactly 0.75 is consistent with previous findings.51,52 According to the XPS results (Table S1, ESI†), the calculated mass percentage of Au in the Au NS18/g-C3N4 sample is 2.1%, which is close to that obtained from ICP-MS. Moreover, there are no clear peak shifts between the g-C3N4 nanosheets and the Au NS18/g-C3N4 sample in the C 1s and N 1s spectra, demonstrating that the introduction of the Au NSs has a negligible effect on the electronic structure of the g-C3N4 nanosheets.
The Au NSs are uniformly distributed on the g-C3N4 nanosheets in the hybrid nanostructure samples, as revealed by TEM and HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 3a and b). The observed interplanar distance of 0.235 nm on the HRTEM image (Fig. 3c) is attributed to the lattice fringes of the (111) planes of face-centered cubic Au. The lattice fringes of g-C3N4 cannot be observed under HRTEM imaging, due to its transparent nature and tendency to degrade under the highly energetic electron beam. The Au NSs are seen to be in close contact with g-C3N4, which can facilitate charge carrier transfer across the interface. Moreover, the specific surface area of the 2.0 wt% Au NS18/g-C3N4 sample was found to be comparable to that of the g-C3N4 sample (Fig. S8 and Table S1, ESI†).

3.3. Photocatalytic activities of the Au NS18/g-C3N4 nanostructures
The photocatalytic H2 evolution of the g-C3N4 and Au NS18/g-C3N4 samples was examined under visible light. Compared with the bare g-C3N4 nanosheets, the Au NS18/g-C3N4 samples with different amounts of Au loading show highly enhanced photocatalytic activities (Fig. 4a). The H2 evolution rate over the Au NS18/g-C3N4 samples first increases and then decreases as the loading amount of the Au NSs is increased. The decrease in the rate of H2 generation can be attributed to the fact that the Au NSs can adversely act as recombination sites for photogenerated electrons and holes.36 The optimal photocatalytic H2 evolution rate over the 2.0 wt% Au NS18/g-C3N4 sample is 540 μmol g−1 h−1, which is much higher than that over the g-C3N4 nanosheets (10 μmol g−1 h−1) (Fig. 4a and b) and also surpasses those obtained in many previous studies (Table S2, ESI†). The negligible activity of the bare g-C3N4 nanosheets can be attributed to rapid charge carrier recombination53 and unfavourable conjugation reduction in the hydrogenated g-C3N4 nanosheets.3 Moreover, the Au NS18/g-C3N4 sample shows superior stability (Fig. 4c). During each cycle, almost an identical amount of H2 is generated. In contrast, in the absence of CTAB, the produced H2 amount decreases considerably in the second cycle (Fig. S9a, ESI†). The reduction in H2 generation is ascribed to the aggregation of the Au NSs (Fig. S9b, ESI†). In the presence of CTAB, the Au NSs show no sign of aggregation over the g-C3N4 nanosheets (Fig. S9c, ESI†). The zeta potential of the Au NS18/g-C3N4 nanostructures in the photocatalytic reaction system is 38 mV owing to the presence of CTAB, suggesting that the hybrid nanostructures are stabilized by CTAB (Fig. S10, ESI†). In comparison, we also conducted the photodeposition of Au NPs over the g-C3N4 nanosheets with the content of the Au NPs adjusted to 2.0 wt% and subjected the Au NPs/g-C3N4 sample to the H2 evolution test. According to Fig. 4d, the H2 production over the Au NPs/g-C3N4 sample is approximately one-third that of the Au NS18/g-C3N4 sample at the same amount of Au loading. There is no clear difference in the FTIR spectra between Au NPs/g-C3N4 and Au NS18/g-C3N4 (Fig. S11, ESI†). We speculate that the smaller H2 production rate of Au NPs/g-C3N4 is mainly caused by the larger size of the photodeposited Au NPs and their non-uniform distribution on the g-C3N4 nanosheets (Fig. S12, ESI†).

3.4. Effects of the size, shape, aspect ratio and loading amount of the Au nanocrystals on the photocatalytic activity of Au/g-C3N4
To confirm the generality of our method for the preparation of Au/g-C3N4 hybrid nanostructures, Au nanocrystals in different sizes and shapes were also synthesized and assembled with the g-C3N4 nanosheets at various Au loading amounts. Two more Au NS samples, NS32 and NS45, and three Au NR samples, NR715, NR750 and NR850, were prepared. The NS32 and NS45 samples have average diameters of 32 ± 1 and 45 ± 2 nm, respectively. The NR715, NR750 and NR850 samples have average lengths of 87 ± 8, 81 ± 6, and 53 ± 5 nm, average diameters of 29 ± 3, 22 ± 2, and 12 ± 2 nm, and average aspect ratios of 3.0 ± 0.3, 3.7 ± 0.5, and 4.4 ± 0.7, respectively (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  SEM and TEM images of the Au NS and Au NR samples. The labels on the top denote the names of the samples. 
The as-prepared CTAB-capped Au nanocrystals were subsequently decorated on the g-C3N4 nanosheets. Fig. 6a shows the SEM and TEM images of the Au nanocrystals/g-C3N4 samples with the Au loading amount of 2.0 wt%. The uniform distribution of the Au nanocrystals on the g-C3N4 nanosheets indicates the generality of our assembly approach. Additionally, the number densities of the Au nanocrystals on the g-C3N4 nanosheets decrease with the increase in size of the Au nanocrystals at the same Au loading amount. The plasmon peaks of the Au NS32/g-C3N4 and Au NS45/g-C3N4 samples show no shifts compared with those of the Au NS samples themselves in water because the refractive index sensitivities of Au NSs are small. In comparison, the longitudinal plasmon peaks of the Au NRs/g-C3N4 samples are blueshifted compared with those of the Au NR samples in aqueous solutions due to the reduction in the effective refractive index of the surrounding environment (Fig. 6b and c).54

The generality of our approach enables the control of the plasmon wavelength of the Au nanocrystals/g-C3N4 samples and therefore the further optimization of the photocatalytic activity. The synthesized Au nanocrystals/g-C3N4 samples were employed for H2 generation under visible light (Fig. 6d). For the Au NSs/g-C3N4 samples, at the Au loading amount of 2.0 wt%, the photocatalytic activity decreases as the Au NSs get larger (compare Fig. 4b and 6d). The reduced activity can be ascribed jointly to the lower overall efficiency in the generation of plasmonic hot electrons36 and the smaller specific number density of the active sites for H2 evolution on larger Au NSs. For the three Au NRs/g-C3N4 samples, the photocatalytic activity can be affected by both the number density and aspect ratio of the Au NRs. The H2 production rates are 417, 405 and 298 μmol g−1 h−1 for the samples containing NR715, NR750 and NR850, respectively. Since the particle volume of NR850 is smaller than those of NR715 and NR750, the lower activity of NR850/g-C3N4 compared with those of NR715/g-C3N4 and NR750/g-C3N4 is believed to be mainly caused by the spectral mismatch between the plasmon peak of NR850/g-C3N4 and the emission spectrum of the visible light source.

Fig. 6e summarizes the effects of the size, shape and loading amount of the Au nanocrystals on the photocatalytic activities of the Au nanocrystals/g-C3N4 photocatalysts under visible light irradiation. In general, for a given type of Au nanocrystal, the H2 generation rate increases at small Au loading amounts, reaches the maximum at an optimal Au loading amount and drops at large loading amounts. This trend can be attributed to the increasing number of recombination events of photogenerated electrons and holes as the number density of the loaded Au nanocrystals is increased on the g-C3N4 nanosheets.36 Moreover, the optimal Au loading amount shifts to higher values when the Au nanocrystals become larger. This is because a higher loading amount is required for larger Au nanocrystals to achieve the same number density, which has been proven to be important for the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 4b).
3.5. Proposed mechanism for photocatalytic H2 evolution over Au NS18/g-C3N4
The Au NS18/g-C3N4 sample at the Au loading amount of 2.0 wt% shows the highest H2 generation rate among all of the hybrid nanostructure photocatalysts containing differently sized and shaped Au nanocrystals at different loading amounts. We then investigated the photocatalytic activity of the Au NS18/g-C3N4 sample under monochromatic light in order to figure out the charger transfer mechanisms of the hybrid nanostructure photocatalysts. The AQYs (Table S3, ESI†) were estimated as a function of wavelength using monochromatic light, which was obtained by placing a bandpass filter in front of a Xe lamp (Fig. S13, ESI†). The trend of the AQYs of the Au NS18/g-C3N4 sample was found to coincide with the absorption spectrum, confirming that H2 generation is induced by the light absorption (Fig. 7a). In particular, the variation of the AQYs in the spectral range from 500 to 600 nm follows the spectral change around the plasmon resonance peak of the Au NSs. The AQYs at the wavelengths of 380 and 520 nm are 1.2% and 0.1%, respectively (Fig. 7a and Table S3, ESI†), indicating the remarkable activity of our plasmonic photocatalyst for H2 production.

(f) Ag NPs photodeposited on the Au NS18/g-C3N4 sample under 325 nm laser irradiation. (g) Ag NPs photodeposited on the Au NS18/g-C3N4 sample under 514 nm laser irradiation. Some representative Ag NPs are marked with orange dashed circles. (h) Transient photoluminescence spectra of the g-C3N4 and Au NS18/g-C3N4 photocatalysts. 
The H2 production rates of the g-C3N4 and Au NS18/g-C3N4 samples under monochromatic light were compared to better understand the effect of the LSPR of the Au NSs on the photocatalytic activity. Because of the negligible activity of the bare g-C3N4 nanosheets (Fig. 4a and b), Pt NPs at 2.0 wt% were photodeposited on the g-C3N4 nanosheets to promote H2 generation. We divided the monochromatic light into two regions according to the different H2 evolution rates. First, when H2 evolution was tested at 380, 420 and 475 nm, Pt NPs/g-C3N4 shows higher H2 generation rates than Au NS18/g-C3N4 (Fig. 7b). At these wavelengths, interband or defect excitation occurs in g-C3N4. The photoexcited electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 then transfer to the attached Pt NPs or Au NSs across the interface for the reduction of water. Pt is known to be more active towards H2 evolution than Au.55,56 Therefore, Pt NPs/g-C3N4 possesses a higher H2 evolution rate than Au NS18/g-C3N4. We note that the interband transitions in Au can also be excited at short wavelengths.57 However, the photon energy of 365 nm (3.4 eV) light has been reported to not be enough for exciting electrons beyond the redox potentials of CO2/CH4 (−0.24 V, versus the standard hydrogen electrode, SHE at pH 7), CO2/HCHO (−0.48 V, versus SHE at pH 7) and CO2/CH3OH (−0.48 V, versus SHE at pH 7).58,59 We therefore believe that the electrons derived from the interband transitions of Au have insufficient energies for the production of H2 (E° = −0.41 V, versus SHE at pH 7).
On the other hand, Au is a better material to support LSPRs than Pt.60 Au NS18/g-C3N4 exhibits a better photocatalytic performance than Pt NPs/g-C3N4 at the wavelengths of 520, 550 and 600 nm (Fig. 7b) due to the excitation of the LSPR of the Au NSs. The excitation of the LSPRs of Au nanocrystals has been known to affect the photocatalytic activity through several mechanisms, including plasmonic sensitization, local electric field enhancement, resonant energy transfer and plasmonic photothermal heating.16,61–63 In our experiments, the temperature of the reaction system was maintained unchanged with circulating water to eliminate the plasmonic photothermal effect. Because of the spectral overlap between the defect-induced absorption of g-C3N4 and the plasmon resonance of the Au NSs, both local electric field enhancement and resonant energy transfer contribute to the improvement in the photocatalytic activity. Additionally, hot electrons generated from the plasmon excitation can overcome the Schottky barrier between Au and g-C3N4 and inject into the CB of g-C3N4 for water reduction.
Photocurrent measurements under chopped irradiation with different light sources were performed at an applied potential of −0.2 V versus SCE to further confirm the LSPR effect of the 18 nm-sized Au NSs (Fig. 7c). The photocurrent enhancement factor (3.4), which is the photocurrent ratio between the Au NS18/g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 electrodes, measured under visible light, is higher than that (1.8) measured under 325-nm laser irradiation. The reason is that the Au NSs can enhance the light absorption of Au NS18/g-C3N4 owing to the plasmon resonance as well as facilitating the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers under visible light. The enhancement factor reaches the highest value of 3.8 under 514 nm laser light, which can be attributed to the LSPR effect of the Au NSs in Au NS18/g-C3N4. We also measured the photocurrent responses of the two electrodes under 633 nm and 705 nm laser irradiation. However, no clear currents were detected, which can be ascribed to the weak absorption of the photocatalysts under these wavelengths. EIS measurements were performed to investigate the interfacial charge transfer characteristics of the electrodes in the dark and under visible light irradiation (Fig. 7d). The equivalent circuit was also drawn, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7d, where Rs is the resistance of the electrolyte solution, CPE is the constant phase element and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the electrode–electrolyte interface. The charge transfer efficiency across the electrode–electrolyte interface increases with the decrease of the Rct value.64 The Au NS18/g-C3N4 electrode shows the smallest Rct value under visible light, indicating that the charge transfer in the Au NS18/g-C3N4 electrode is more efficient than that in the bare g-C3N4 electrode. This result further suggests that the introduction of the Au NSs on the g-C3N4 nanosheets increases the conductivity and facilitates electron–hole separation.65
To help to understand the role of the Au nanocrystals in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution more intuitively, a schematic is provided to illustrate the plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis (Fig. 7e). Both the bandgap excitation of g-C3N4 and the photon absorption originating from the LSPR of the Au nanocrystal contribute to the superior photocatalytic activity of the hybrid nanostructure. At λ < 500 nm, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 transfer to the adjacent Au nanocrystal for H2 production, with the holes left in the VB to oxidize the electron donor (Fig. 7e, left part). At λ > 500 nm, incident photons are mainly absorbed by the Au nanocrystal through plasmon excitation (Fig. 7e, right part).66,67 The improved H2 generation rates can be attributed to the LSPR effect of the Au nanocrystal.
The plasmon-mediated charge transfer mechanism was further verified by the photodeposition of Ag NPs on the Au NS18/g-C3N4 photocatalyst under laser irradiation. The reduction potential of Ag+ (0.8 V, versus NHE, pH = 0) is more positive than that of H+ (0 V, versus NHE, pH = 0). Therefore, Ag+ ions can be readily reduced to Ag NPs by electrons that possess the ability for water reduction. Fig. 7f shows the Ag NPs photodeposited on the Au NSs under 325 nm laser irradiation. The Au NSs originally with a smooth surface become rough after the photodeposition of Ag NPs, indicating that the Au NSs are the reduction sites at this wavelength. Although the interband transitions of Au can be excited at this wavelength, the energy of the generated electrons is not enough for injection into the CB of the g-C3N4 nanosheets.58 In contrast, Ag NPs were detected on the g-C3N4 nanosheets in the vicinity of the Au NSs under 514 nm laser irradiation, suggesting that Ag+ ions are reduced on the g-C3N4 nanosheets by the electrons derived from the local electric field enhancement, resonant energy transfer and/or hot electron injection effects of the Au NSs (Fig. 7g).
The interfacial charge transfer was further confirmed by the decreased photoluminescence lifetime (Fig. 7h). The time-resolved transient photoluminescence spectra of the samples were measured and the decay curves were fitted with exponential functions as follows:68 (2)where τ1 and τ2 are the emission lifetime values, and A1 and A2 are the corresponding amplitudes. The double-exponential function suggests that two emissive states are involved in the photoluminescence decay with τ1 = 2.26 ns and τ2 = 8.77 ns for g-C3N4. The lifetime values are reduced respectively to 2.21 and 7.66 ns for Au NS18/g-C3N4. The decreased photoluminescence lifetime shows the rapid charge transfer in Au NS18/g-C3N4.69 The time-resolved photoluminescence spectra together with the steady photoluminescence spectra in Fig. 2e demonstrate that the Au NSs can efficiently inhibit the radiative recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers and further enhance the photocatalytic activity.
4. Conclusions
We have synthesized Au nanocrystals/g-C3N4 nanostructures through electrostatic assembly and studied their photocatalytic activities for H2 generation. In comparison with the previously reported photodeposition, our method takes advantage of the well-controlled shapes, sizes and therefore plasmon wavelengths of colloidal Au nanocrystals, which allows us to investigate the separate effects of the shape, plasmon wavelength and loading amount of Au nanocrystals on the photocatalytic activity and in turn optimize the performance of the hybrid photocatalysts. The H2 evolution rate is greatly improved upon the loading of the Au nanocrystals on the g-C3N4 nanosheets. The optimal Au NS18/g-C3N4 nanostructure exhibits a superior activity, with the H2 generation rate reaching 540 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light. The excellent activity for H2 production is ascribed to the different electron transfer mechanisms that take effect in different spectral regions of light. Apart from enhancing the photocatalytic activity, the Au/g-C3N4 system exhibits a favourable photocatalytic water splitting performance under broadband light irradiation. We believe that our reported strategy provides a guide for designing other metal–semiconductor systems with improved performance for solar energy-to-fuel conversion and for other plasmon-driven chemical reactions.
