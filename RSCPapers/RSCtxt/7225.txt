    , Accepted 20th June 2013First published on 10th July 2013AbstractDual-channel (DC) anchorable organic dyes with well-defined structures, based on an acceptor–π-donor–core bridge–donor–acceptor structural motif, were synthesized and used as sensitizers for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The new synthetic approach implies the use of two donors, two acceptors and a core bridge as a spacer. DC dyes linked the two donors using a core bridge such as m-phenylene and fluorene units, which makes two channels maintaining a particular distance (>4 Å). The inter-planar DC1 structure exhibited higher aggregation and charge recombination than the trapezoidal DC3 structure, due to strong intermolecular π–π stacking between the channels of DC dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. The DC3 dye had a broader light-harvesting range than DC1, while the DC3 dye with HC-A1 was less efficient than the DC1 dye with HC-A1. Thus, the effect of the chemical structure of a DC sensitizer on DSSC performance was studied. As a result, a solar cell based on DC1 with HC-A1 showed better photovoltaic performance with a Jsc of 10.8 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.72 V, and a FF of 0.77, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 6.06%.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising hybrid/organic photovoltaic devices for high efficiency, low cost solar energy conversion.1–4 In these cells, the sensitizer is one of the key components for high power-conversion efficiency; the Ru(II) complex is the most efficient heterogeneous charge-transfer sensitizer and is widely used in nanocrystalline TiO2-based DSSCs.5–9 However, the main drawback of Ru(II) complex sensitizers is the cost of ruthenium metal, the requirement for careful synthesis, and tricky purification steps.10
Recently, interest in metal-free organic dyes as an alternative to noble metal complexes has increased due to their many advantages, such as the diversity of molecular structures, high molar extinction coefficients, simple synthesis, as well as low cost and negligible environmental issues.11,12 By employing a combination of a zinc porphyrin dye (YD2-o-C8) and an organic dye (Y123) in conjunction with a tris(2,2′-bipyridine) cobalt(II/III) redox couple, Grätzel et al. reported a DSSC with 12.3% efficiency.13 Many organic dyes based on the donor–(π-spacer)–acceptor (D–π–A) system, exhibiting relatively high DSSC performance, have so far been designed and developed. A single D–π–A sensitizer having a rod-like configuration may cause undesirable dye aggregation and charge recombination.14,15 The intermolecular π–π stacking of dye molecules can lead to self-quenching of excited states and hence inefficient electron injection.16 A common structural strategy for suppression of dye aggregation is the introduction of a bulky group into the donor part.17 Another unique approach is bridging of two chromophores into a spiro configuration similar to Ru-sensitizers.18 To enhance optical density and binding strength of the dye onto TiO2, of particular interest is the synthesis of a dianchoring dye, which has been found to enhance the photocurrent due to the extended π-conjugated framework and higher molar extinction coefficient. Several dianchoring organic dyes have been synthesized for use in DSSCs, and have demonstrated better cell performance than single D–π–A sensitizers with an improved photoresponse, photocurrent and stability.19–23
In this study, we present an extension of dianchoring organic sensitizers, with the aim of further expanding the possibility of improving the optical and energetic properties of the sensitizers. The new approach, based on the acceptor–π-donor–core bridge–donor–π–acceptor structural motif, includes the use of two donors, two acceptors and a core bridge as a spacer. We have adopted diphenylamine as a donor group by using a core bridge such as m-phenylene and fluorene units, which makes two channels maintained at a distance (>4 Å), providing dual-channel (DC) anchorable dyes with well-defined structures. DFT/TD-DFT calculations were carried out in order to highlight the main properties associated with the dual-channel anchorable dye geometry.
Results and discussion
To design new dual-channel anchorable organic dyes with well-defined structures, we selected some of the most common donor and π-spacer groups. Namely, we adopted diphenylamine as the donor core using m-phenylene and 9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene building blocks as the core bridge units (Fig. 1). DC aldehyde derivatives were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction, and DC sensitizers were synthesized with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of a piperidine catalyst.

Fig. 2 shows the absorption and emission spectra of the DC dyes measured in THF solution; the photophysical properties are summarized in Table 1. In the UV-vis spectra, the two dyes exhibited two main prominent bands, appearing at 350–400 and 400–550 nm, respectively. The former was ascribed to the localized aromatic π–π* transition, and the latter was that of the charge transfer character, which was from the donor part to the acceptor group. The absorption spectrum of the DC3 dye containing the fluorene unit showed a maximum absorption at 494 nm, which was 36 nm red-shifted in contrast to the DC1 dye. Also, the molar absorption coefficient (ε) of the DC3 dye was much higher (εmax = 60100 M−1 cm−1), indicating that the DC3 dye had good light-harvesting ability. The absorption spectra of the DC dyes on the surface of TiO2 are shown in Fig. S1.†

Typically, a blue-shift on TiO2 is a common phenomenon for most organic dyes, and is thought to be the result of a strong interaction between the dye and the semiconductor surface.24 The dianchoring mode of DC dyes was further confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. S2†). The CO stretching band at 1730 cm−1 assigned to the carboxylic acid groups of the free DC1 dye was found to have disappeared in the IR spectrum of the DC1 dye adsorbed on the TiO2 film, indicating the involvement of both carboxylic acid groups upon adsorption on the TiO2 surface; this result is similar to the observations made by Heredia et al.18 and Abbotto et al.19
The electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) to obtain the HOMO and LUMO levels of the DC dyes. The cyclic voltammograms were obtained from a three-electrode cell in 0.1 M TBAPF6 in CH3CN at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, using a dye coated TiO2 electrode as the working electrode, a Pt wire counter-electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode (+0.197 V vs. NHE) which was calibrated with ferrocene. All of the measured potentials were converted to the NHE scale. The band gap was estimated from the absorption edges of the UV-vis spectra and LUMO energy levels were derived from the HOMO energy levels and the band gap. HOMO values (1.07, 1.09 V vs. NHE) were more positive than the I−/I3− redox couple (0.4 V vs. NHE). Electron injection from the excited dyes into the conduction band of TiO2 should be energetically favorable because of the more negative LUMO values (−1.18, −1.06 vs. NHE) compared to the conduction band edge energy level of the TiO2 electrode.25
Structural optimization of DC dyes was done with a PBE exchange–correlation function using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). We used 400 eV as the cut-off energy, and the conjugate gradient method was employed to optimize the geometry until the force exerted on an atom was less than 0.03 eV Å−1. The size of the super-cell was maintained large enough to guarantee that the closest distance between atoms belonging to the neighboring cells was greater than 16 Å. More precisely, structure optimizations were done for two configurations for each dye, i.e., cis and trans configurations.

Fig. 3 shows that the torsional angles for the cis and trans configurations were expected to be quite different for the two configurations. In the cis configuration, two channels are close to each other, while they are far apart in the trans configuration (Fig. S3†). A complicated but sophisticated optimization procedure, in which each of the donor, acceptor, and bridge fragments was separately optimized before all the fragments were combined in the final molecule and reoptimized, was carried out to structurally optimize the DC dyes.
 Fig. 3  Molecular structures of the DC1 (a and b) and DC3 dyes (c and d) in the cis (a and c) and trans (b and d) configurations. The torsional angle ϕ is also defined. 
Here, we summarize our results for the DFT and TD-DFT calculations. First, our optimization results indicate that the cis configuration is more stable than the trans configuration by 0.25 and 0.32 eV for DC1 and DC3, respectively. Therefore, we can conclude that both dyes adopt the cis configuration (≈100%), and the TD-DFT calculations were performed for this configuration. Fig. S4† shows separate distances between the same kind of atoms belonging to two different channels in the cis configuration. For DC1, the closest distances between the two m-phenylene units were 5.33 and 6.28 Å for the cis and trans configurations, respectively. Such an inter-planar conformation leads to intermolecular π–π stacking interactions between channels of the DC1 dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. It is well-known that the π–π stacking of the inter-planar molecules may facilitate the formation of detrimental excimeric species and may lead to fluorescence quenching in the solid state.26 The ϕ angles were −10° and −115°. For DC3, the corresponding distances were 11.01 and 11.34 Å, and the ϕ angles were 4° and 122°, leading to a trapezoidal structure. In very good agreement with the experimental data shown in Fig. 2, we first found two and three absorption maxima for the DC1 and DC3 dyes, respectively (Fig. S5†). We were able to confirm that absorption peaks below 400 nm were not observed for the DC1 dye if only 40 transitions were examined. A similar argument holds for the DC3 dye. The major absorption appeared at 494 and 512 nm for DC1 and DC3, respectively, which were red-shifted by ∼20 nm with respect to the experimental data. The major absorption for the DC3 dye was red-shifted by 32 nm with respect to that of the DC1 dye, which agrees very well with the experimental red-shift of 36 nm.
The shapes of the HOMOs and LUMOs of the DC dyes are shown in Fig. 4. The ground state of all the dye electrons was homogeneously distributed in the donor, and upon light illumination, electrons were finally excited to an anchoring group through the change from the HOMO to the LUMO by intramolecular charge transfer, which indicated that photo-induced electrons are able to transfer from the dye to the TiO2 electrode efficiently. Next, we delved into the nature of the transitions responsible for the observed absorption maxima of the DC1 dye. Table S1† shows that absorptions at 459, 473, and 494 nm, which are responsible for the absorption peak at 480 nm, can be largely ascribed to two charge transfer transitions, i.e., HOMO−5 → LUMO and HOMO−4 → LUMO+1 transitions. Note that HOMO−5 and HOMO−4 are degenerate, which is also true for LUMO and LUMO+1. Table S1† also shows that the calculated absorptions at 491, 495, 514, 519, and 574 nm, which are responsible for the calculated absorption peak of the DC3 dye at 512 nm, can be largely ascribed to two charge transfer transitions, i.e., HOMO−1 → LUMO+2 and HOMO−1 → LUMO+3 transitions. Note that LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 are almost degenerate, since they are bonding and antibonding combinations of π-orbitals of two acceptors which are distantly separated.

To effectively suppress dye aggregation for DSSCs, in our previous study,27–30 coadsorbents such as DCA and HC-A1 were used. Both Voc and Jsc were dramatically enhanced by the coadsorption of the multi-functional coadsorbent HC-A1 with the dye, due to the efficient retardation of charge recombination arising from the prevention of π–π stacking, light-harvesting in shorter wavelength regions, and a hole conducting function through a redox cascade process.27Fig. 5 shows the spectra for the efficiency of conversion of an incident photon to current (IPCE) for the DSSCs with dye only and dye/coadsorbent, respectively. The onset wavelengths of the IPCE spectra for DSSCs based on DC1 and DC3 were 750 nm. IPCE values higher than 60% were observed in the range of 400–600 nm with a maximum value of 75% at 490 nm for the DSSC based on DC1 with HC-A1. Interestingly, the DC1/DCA-sensitized DSSC remarkably increased the IPCE value, while the DC3/DCA-sensitized DSSC slightly enhanced the IPCE value.
 Fig. 5  Typical action spectra of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) obtained for nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells sensitized with DC dyes. 
Moreover, the IPCE response of the DC1/HC-A1-sensitized DSSC was remarkably increased compared to that with DCA. We suggest that intermolecular π–π stacking between channels of the DC1 dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface was effectively reduced by the incorporation of coadsorbents, resulting in enhanced light harvesting. The reaction rate of the first carboxylation reaction with the TiO2 surface (an intermolecular reaction), which was the rate-limiting step, was slower than the rate of the second carboxylation reaction (an intramolecular reaction) of the same dianchoring dye.31 After the first carboxylic acid of the DC dye had anchored at an active site of TiO2, if the carboxylic acid reaction of the coadsorbents proceeded between channels, intermolecular π–π stacking could be avoided and would remarkably increase the IPCE value.
For the dye with DCA and HC-A1 coadsorbed on the TiO2 film, the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group in the dye induced less adsorption of the DC dye onto the TiO2 surface, owing to the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged carboxylic acid groups.32 Moreover, less dye adsorption for HC-A1 than DCA coadsorption was attributed to the larger molecular size of HC-A1. Thus, HC-A1 with a Y-shaped bulky structure was found to be more efficient than DCA in decreasing dye adsorption and preventing aggregation between the dye molecules in the pores of TiO2 films.27–30 The amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface was estimated spectroscopically by desorbing the dyes with a 0.1 M solution of NaOH in 50:25:25 (vol%) H2O/EtOH/THF. The surface concentrations were found to be 1.97 × 10−7, 1.64 × 10−7, and 1.47 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for the DC1, DC1/DCA, and DC1/HC-A1-based TiO2 films, respectively.
The photovoltaic performance of the DC-sensitized DSSCs is summarized in Table 2. Under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions, the DC3 sensitized cell (without coadsorbents) gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 9.24 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.63 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.60, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 3.56%, while the DSSC based on DC1 showed lower Jsc and Voc values due to heavy aggregation, leading to a much lower efficiency of 1.00%. On the other hand, the DC1/DCA-sensitized DSSC, compared to the DC1-sensitized DSSC, had an increased Jsc from 2.50 to 8.90 mA cm−2, 0.52 to 0.60 V for Voc, and 1.00 to 4.05% for η. As shown in Fig. 6, Jsc increased in the same order as the integrated photocurrent from the IPCE spectrum. Also, the DC1/HC-A1-sensitized DSSC, compared to the DC1/DCA-sensitized DSSC, had an increased Jsc from 8.90 to 10.8 mA cm−2, 0.60 to 0.72 V for Voc, and 4.05 to 6.06% for η. It was observed that the coadsorption of either DCA or HC-A1 simultaneously improved Jsc and Voc, but coadsorption with HC-A1 enhanced Voc more significantly than with DCA (80 mV for DCA, 200 mV for HC-A1). For the DC3/HC-A1-sensitized DSSC, compared to the DC3-sensitized DSSC, values were increased from 9.25 to 11.1 mA cm−2 for Jsc, 0.63 to 0.72 V for Voc, and 3.56 to 5.04% for η. The DC3 dye exhibited a broader light harvesting range than DC1, while the DC3 dye with HC-A1 was less efficient than the DC1 dye with HC-A1 due to the low FF. These results indicate that the DC1 structure leads to heavier aggregation and charge recombination than the DC3 structure due to intermolecular π–π stacking between adsorbed channels on the TiO2 surface.

To further characterize the electron transport and recombination effect for the chemical structure of the DC sensitizers and different coadsorbents used, we measured electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under dark conditions at a forward bias of −0.65 V. Their EIS parameters calculated from the equivalent circuit are summarized in Table 3. Typical EIS Nyquist and Bode plots for DSSCs based on the DC dyes, DC/DCA, and DC/HC-A1 are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S6.† The larger semicircle at intermediate frequencies represents the interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the dye-TiO2–electrolyte interface. The calculated Rct values of DC/HC-A1-based devices (203.5 Ω for DC1, 743 Ω for DC3) were higher than those of the DC/DCA-based devices (57.1 Ω for DC1 and 98.0 Ω for DC3), which was consistent with the sequence of open circuit voltage values in the devices. From the EIS results, it is clear that the charge recombination rate was the rate-determining step of the DSSC in terms of device performance, since the DC1 and DC3 DSSCs with or without coadsorbents decreased the charge recombination rate and resulted in an improvement in device performance, in that order. From these results, we can conclude that charge recombination of the DSSCs with dye only is faster than that of the DSSCs with coadsorbents (DCA and HC-A1). This insulating molecular layer effectively inhibits back electron transfer from TiO2 to I3− ions and results in a higher Voc. The photovoltaic performance was reflected in the electron lifetime (τn = CμRct) and charge collection efficiency (ηcc = (1 + Rt/Rct)−1) derived from EIS by fitting the experimental data through an appropriate equivalent circuit.30

The fitted Rct, τn and ηcc values are plotted in Fig. 8. The electron lifetime (τn) observed for DC/DCA was slightly slower than for the dye only, whereas this was significantly increased for DC/HC-A1 compared to DC/DCA. The charge collection efficiency (ηcc) of DC3, DC3/DCA, and DC3/HC-A1 was calculated to be 98, 98, and 99%, respectively. On the other hand, the ηcc of DC1 with DCA and HC-A1 was greater than with the dye only (64, 86, and 99%) due to the prevention of aggregation, resulting in an increased Voc of DSSCs based on DC1.

Conclusions
We successfully synthesized novel well-defined dyes based on a dual channel system to yield materials with interesting optical and electrochemical properties. The higher molar absorption coefficient was favorable for the light-harvesting efficiency of DSSCs. The inter-planar DC1 structure had heavier aggregation and charge recombination than the trapezoidal DC3 structure due to heavy aggregation with strong intermolecular π–π stacking between channels adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. The DC3 dye had a broader light harvesting range than DC1, while the DC3 dye with HC-A1 was less efficient than the DC1 dye with HC-A1 due to the low fill factor. As a result, the solar cell based on the DC1 dye with HC-A1 showed better photovoltaic performance than solar cells based on DC3 with HC-A1, with a Jsc of 10.8 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.72 V, and a FF of 0.77, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency η of 6.06% under standard AM 1.5 irradiation.
