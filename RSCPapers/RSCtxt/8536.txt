    , Accepted 1st July 2021First published on 1st July 2021AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid Pb-based halide perovskites, especially the well-known MAPbI3, have shown great promise for photovoltaic applications due to their fast-growing power-conversion efficiency (PCE) and low manufacturing cost. However, their poor ambient stability and Pb-toxicity are still challenging issues for future commercialization. Here, by combining first-principles calculations with large-scale screening, we propose a Pb-free all-inorganic Dion–Jacobson perovskite CsSbCl4, which has an optimal bandgap (∼1.4 eV) in the first place. Our calculations also show that CsSbCl4 possesses high carrier mobility (∼102–104 cm2 V−1 s−1) and strong interband optical absorption (∼105 cm−1). Consequently, its spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency can reach up to ∼27%, similar to MAPbI3. Moreover, the TiO2/CsSbCl4/spiro-OMeTAD junction has a PCE of 20.07%, which can be further enhanced by optimizing parameters, such as absorber defect density. These favourable characteristics of CsSbCl4 make it a potential alternative to Pb-based halide perovskites in photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
Three-dimensional (3D) organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites, e.g. the extensively-used MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium), have aroused a wide variety of research interest due to their outstanding electronic, optical, and charge transport characteristics as well as low-cost solution fabrication process.1–6 Recently, the certified power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction Pb-based solar cells has reached up to 25.5%.7 However, their inherent low stability with exposure to moisture, light, and heat environments together with intrinsic Pb-toxicity are still hindering their commercialization.8 A considerably large amount of research effort has been made on interface engineering and encapsulation to overcome the instability of 3D perovskites.9,10 On the other hand, many researchers turn their attention to 2D perovskites with remarkable optoelectronic characteristic tunability and improved stability.11 Recently, 2D layered halide perovskites have exhibited great potential in photovoltaic (PV) and solid-state lighting applications because of their excellent structural and bandgap tunability as well as high photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency.12–15
Usual 2D halide perovskites have both advantages and challenges to be used as solar-cell absorbers. Analogous to oxide perovskites, 2D halide perovskites can be divided into five different layered structures: the (i) Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phase, (ii) Dion–Jacobson (DJ) phase, (iii) 110 phase, (iv) 111 phase, and (v) Aurivillius (AV) phase.16 These structures are different in stacking orientation of M–X (M is the metal cation and X is the halogen anion) octahedra, the position of the interlayer cation and the number of octahedral layers. The DJ halide perovskites have several intrinsic benefits among the aforementioned five kinds of 2D perovskites for realizing high-performance solar cells. The DJ perovskites require only one interlayer cation A′ per unit cell (Fig. 1a), and the adjacent octahedral layer is stacked exactly in a vertex-to-vertex manner. The adjacent octahedral layers can thus be joined together by strong chemical bonds instead of weak van der Waals interaction adopted in some well-known 2D materials, such as graphene and MoS2.17,18 Therefore, DJ perovskites have a small interlayer distance, stable structure, and fast interlayer charge transport, which are highly desirable for PV devices.
There are also experimental studies on substituting Pb with Sn to reduce Pb-toxicity. The Sn-based low-dimensional DJ halide perovskite (4AMP) (FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (4AMP = 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium, FA = formamidinium, n = 4) was reported to have a PCE over 4%, exhibiting great potential in Pb-free PV applications.19 Recently, Li et al. synthesized a Sn-based DJ perovskite (BEA) (FA)2Sn3I10 (BEA = 1,4-butanediamine), which has a PCE of 6.43% and exhibits an improved stability.20 By combining the advantages of the enhanced stability of layered DJ perovskites and the suitable bandgap of mixed Pb/Sn-based perovskites, Ke et al. successfully synthesized a mixed Pb/Sn-based DJ perovskite (3AMP) (MA0.5FA0.5)3(Pb0.5Sn0.5)4I13, achieving a PCE up to 20.09%,21 which is the highest PCE of layered perovskite solar cells at present. However, there is an urgent need to address issues of Pb-toxicity as well as the instability of both Sn2+ and organic cations for their practical use in perovskite solar cells. Therefore, it is imperative to explore stable and non-toxic inorganic perovskites with excellent PV properties for solar-cell absorbers.
In this work, we design a DJ-phase all-inorganic Pb-free halide perovskite CsSbCl4 with excellent PV performance by using first-principles calculations. The composition flexibility of DJ perovskites allows us to use elements with various valences (e.g. +3) for the octahedral cation M, and we thus choose Sb after comprehensive screening with several key criteria. Our results show that CsSbCl4 exhibits an optimal direct bandgap (∼1.4 eV), a large interband optical absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1), and high and balanced photo-generated carrier mobility (∼102–104 cm2 V−1 s−1). Based on the above outstanding electronic, optical, and transport properties, the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency is calculated to be 27% for a 3 μm-thick CsSbCl4 film. The simulated PCE of the solar-cell device TiO2/CsSbCl4/spiro-OMeTAD is 20.07%. These excellent photoelectric properties are crucial and highly desirable for improving the utilization of solar radiation in PV devices.
2. Calculation methods
2.1 DFT and GW calculations
We carried out first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method22,23 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).24 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) is used for exchange–correlation functionals.25 The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis set is 500 eV. For few-layer structures, a 13 × 13 × 1 (15 × 15 × 1) k-point mesh is used for structure optimization (self-consistent calculations) in the first Brillouin zone. We take a vacuum layer larger than 20 Å along the out-of-plane direction to eliminate pseudo coupling between periodically repeated systems. The bandgap, a fundamental parameter of a semiconductor, is always underestimated in GGA approaches due to inaccurate description of the exchange–correlation functionals. In our calculations, we adopted the GGA-1/2 method26 to correct the bandgap to an accurate value in agreement with time-consuming GW calculations at a computational cost comparable to the ordinary GGA-PBE calculations. Moreover, the BerkeleyGW package was used to perform the accurate GW calculations of the electronic structures.27 The ground state Kohn–Sham wave functions and eigenvalues were obtained using the Troullier–Martins norm-conserving pseudopotentials28,29 as implemented in the QUANTUM ESPRESSO code.30 For the GW calculations, the dielectric matrices were evaluated up to a cutoff of 38 Ry on a 12 × 12 × 1 k-grid.
2.2 GGA-1/2 bandgap correction
In the GGA-1/2 approach,26 the orbital dependent self-energy Sα = ∫nα(r)Vs(r)d3r of a Kohn–Sham state α with electron density nα(r) is subtracted from the Kohn–Sham eigenvalue at full occupation. The self-energy potential Vs is given by, Vs ≈ V(0,r) − V(−1/2,r),(1)that is, the difference between the all-electron potentials of the atom and its half-ion. The self-energy correction is problematic if it is added to all the atoms in the crystal. Therefore, the self-energy potentials must be trimmed by a step function Θ(r) to avoid overlapping between neighboring atoms. The step function Θ(r) is defined as, (2)
The values of the parameter CUT (a.u.) and n can be determined in a variational manner to make the bandgap of the crystal reach its maximum. To validate the accuracy of the GGA-1/2 method used to make correction to the bandgap, we calculated the band structure of 1-layer CsSbCl4 by using the GGA-1/2 method and compared it with the advanced GW method, shown in Fig. S1.† In our current GGA-1/2 calculations for CsSbCl4, the parameter n is chosen to be 8 for anion Cl− and cation Sb3+. The parameter CUT is set to 1.3 and 1.2 a.u. for Cl− and Sb3+, respectively. It clearly indicates that both the band edge dispersion from the PBE method and the bandgap obtained by using the GGA-1/2 method are in good agreement with those from the GW calculations.
2.3 Optical absorption
The interband optical absorption coefficient α(ω) can be calculated using the formula,31 (3)where ε(1)(ω) and ε(2)(ω) denote the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. The imaginary part is calculated using the following expression,32 (4)where  represents the unit vector along the α (β) direction, q is the wave number of the incident electromagnetic wave, Ω is the volume of the unit cell, and c (ν) represents the unoccupied (occupied) bands. Using the Kramers–Kronig relationship, one can calculate the real part as follows33 (5)where P labels the principal value.
2.4 Carrier mobility
According to deformation potential (DP) theory proposed by Bardeen and Shockley,34 the carrier mobility μ3D and μ2D in the bulk and 1–3 layer materials can be calculated using the following formulas, respectively,35–37 (6) (7)where e is the electron charge, ℏ is the Planck's constant divided by 2π, KB is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and C is the elastic modulus of the longitudinal strain along the transport direction. For 1–3 layer and bulk CsSbCl4, C can be calculated using [∂2E/∂δ2]/S0 and [∂2E/∂δ2]/V0, respectively, where E is the total energy, δ is the applied uniaxial strain, and S0 (V0) is the area (volume) of the optimized supercell. The effective mass m* of electrons (holes) around the bottom of the conduction band (the top of the valence band) can be approximately fitted by m* = ℏ2[∂2E(k)/∂k2]−1, and md can be calculated using  and  in 1–3 layer and bulk CsSbCl4, respectively. Here,  represents the carrier effective mass along the 〈100〉 (〈010〉, 〈001〉) direction. The deformation potential constant E1 = [∂Eedge/∂δ] represents the shift of the valence band maximum (VBM) for the hole or conduction band minimum (CBM) for electrons along the transport direction. Here, Eedge is the energy of the CBM or VBM under appropriate lattice compression or dilatation.
2.5 Theoretical power-conversion efficiency (PCE)
The PCE η of a single-junction solar cell is defined as η = Pm/Pin, where Pin is the total incident solar energy density [AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2)],38 and Pm is the maximum output power density. One can get Pm by numerically maximizing the product of current density I and voltage V, i.e., Pm = ImVm. The fill factor FF can be calculated using FF = (ImVm)/(ISCVOC), where ISC and VOC represent the short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage, respectively.

2.5.1 Spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME). 
The Shockley–Queisser (SQ)-limit model considering only the electronic bandgap of the absorber has been used extensively for exploring promising PV materials with an optimal band gap.39 Based on the SQ-limit, the SLME further takes into account the shape of the absorption spectrum and the film thickness of the solar absorber to evaluate the intrinsic solar cell PCE.40,41 The photon absorptivity a(E) is defined as a(E) = 1 − e−2α(E)L, where L is the thickness of the absorber layer with a zero-reflectivity front surface and unity-reflectivity back surface, and α(E) (α(ω)) is the optical absorption coefficient calculated by using the first-principles method.
Furthermore, the PCE of a thin-film solar cell also depends on the fraction of radiative electron–hole recombination current fr, which can be described by  Here, Edag is the minimum allowed bandgap and depends on the transition mechanism of the solar absorber. In the case of a direct-gap semiconductor, the parameter fr would be 1 when the transition between the CBM and VBM is allowed and one has Edag = Eg. However, for an indirect-gap semiconductor, the parameter fr would be less than 1 because the lowest transition energy is usually larger than its bandgap. In the SLME model, the current-density–voltage relationship, i.e. I–V curve, can be described by40,41I = ISC − I0[exp(eV/KBT) − 1], where the short-circuit current density ISC can be obtained by  Here, Isun(E) is the AM 1.5G standard photon flux at temperature T.38 The reverse saturation current I0 is given by I0 = Ir0 + Inr0 = Ir0/fr, where Ir0 and Inr0 are radiative and nonradiative parts, respectively. The radiative part of the reverse saturation current can be defined by  where Ibb(E, T) is the black-body spectrum at temperature T.


2.5.2 PCE of the solar-cell device using CsSbCl4 as the absorber. 
To evaluate the performance of CsSbCl4 in a realistic device, in which the important non-radiative recombination loss is taken into account, we also calculated the PCE of solar-cell devices using CsSbCl4 and MAPbI3 as the absorbers. To this end, we used wxAMPS, which is a free solar cell simulator based on an updated version of the AMPS (Analysis of Microelectronic and Photonic Structures) code.42 Compared with the SLME method, this code can simulate the real device consisting of carrier transport layers and the absorber film. The defects in the absorber and carrier transport layers, the crystal orientation of the solar absorber, and the energy level matching are all taken into account. Then the I–V curve and the corresponding parameters can be obtained by solving the Poisson equation (eqn (8)), electron continuity equation (eqn (9)), and hole continuity equation (eqn (10)),43,44 (8) (9) (10)Here ε is the permittivity, ψ is the electrostatic potential, and n (p) and nt (pt) are the densities of the free electrons (holes) and trapped electrons (holes), respectively. Moreover, Na (Nd) is the acceptor (donor) doping concentration, G is the generation rate, τ is the carrier lifetime, μ is the carrier mobility, ξ is the electric field, and D is the diffusion coefficient.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure and stability
Let us now focus on the crystal structure of CsSbCl4 as shown in Fig. 1a. It has the simplest structure in DJ halide perovskites with the general chemical formula of A′An−1MnX3n+1 (A′, A = organic or inorganic cations, M = metal cation, X = halogen anion, and n = positive integer). Because Cs-based halide perovskites are usually more stable than organic ones,45 we choose Cs+ as A′ and A in this paper. It is also well-known that Cl-based perovskites are more stable than Br- and I-based counterparts due to the shorter M–X bond. Therefore, we narrow the DJ perovskites (n = 1) down to CsMCl4, where the octahedral cation M should be a trivalent metal ion, such as Sb3+ and Bi3+. The CsBiCl4 perovskite has been waived due to its large bandgap (see Fig. S2†). Here we thus choose Sb3+ as the cation M after screening all possible candidates by the following three criteria. (i) It should be large enough to guarantee structural stability. (ii) It possesses lone-pair s-electrons to enhance photoelectronic performance. (iii) CsMCl4 exhibits excellent electronic, optical, and transport properties (to be discussed below). The bulk CsSbCl4 has a cubic crystal structure with the space group of P4/mmm, which was determined by using the VASPKIT code.46 The adjacent octahedral layers are stacked in the vertex-to-vertex manner and there is only one interlayer cation A′ per unit cell. The 1-, 2-, and 3-layer structures of CsSbCl4 are also given in Fig. S3.† Moreover, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of bulk CsSbCl4 are calculated by using the VESTA software,47 and shown in Fig. 1b.

The letters a, d, and h represent the fully-relaxed lattice constant, the interlayer distance, and the single layer thickness (Table S1†), respectively. (b) The XRD spectra of bulk CsSbCl4, in which the angular range and the radiation wavelength are chosen to be 1–60° and λ = 1.54184 Å (Cu-Kα), respectively. Some of the important peaks are labeled with the corresponding Miller indices. (c) The calculated Goldschmidt tolerance factor t and formation energy of CsSbCl4. Here the corresponding results of CsSbBr4, CsSbI4, and MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) are also plotted for comparison. 
The formability of CsSbCl4 can be evaluated by using the Goldschmidt tolerance factor map method and formation energy. The tolerance factor is defined as  where rA, rM, and rX are the ionic radii of the A-, M-, and X-site ions, respectively. The empirical observations suggest that the optimal region varies from 0.813 to 1.107 for the tolerance factor.48 The formation energy is calculated using the following formula, Ef = (EAxMyXz − xEA − yEM − zEX)/(x + y + z),(11)in which EAxMyXz is the total energy of AxMyXz, and EA (EM, EX) represents the energy of per A (M, X) atom (eV per atom) in its corresponding single crystal phase. The negative value of formation energy indicates the stability of materials. Fig. 1c clearly shows that the tolerance factor of CsSbCl4 falls into the aforementioned ideal region (0.813–1.107) and is closer to 1 than MAPbX3, which is one indication of its structural stability. The formation energy of CsSbX4 is smaller than that of MAPbX3, which is a sign of higher stability of CsSbCl4. Notably, CsSbCl4 also has a lower formation energy than corresponding Sb-based DJ perovskites CsSbBr4 and CsSbI4 due to tighter binding between Sb and Cl atoms. The results above are in support of the conclusion that the DJ-phase CsSbCl4 has a better structural stability than MAPbX3, CsSbBr4, and CsSbI4.
It is worthwhile to discuss the availability of the tolerance factor in 2D perovskites. Although the definition of tolerance factor stems from 3D perovskites, it is a significant measure of stability for 2D perovskites as well. The physical explanations may be summed up as follows. 2D perovskites with five different layered structures (as described above) can be obtained by slicing 3D perovskites along the (100), (110), or (111) crystal plane. Naturally, the 2D configurations will transform into 3D structure AMX3 as the number of octahedral layers n approaches infinity (for details see Fig. S4†), which indicates that there is a close structural relationship between the 3D and 2D perovskites. It can also be concluded that the ions within the octahedral layer of 2D perovskites have similar local chemical environments to the corresponding 3D perovskites except for interlayer A′ and X ions. Furthermore, 2D perovskites exhibit greater flexibility and strain tolerance compared with their corresponding 3D ones, and thus the tolerance factor requirement can be relaxed in 2D perovskites.49 In fact, the tolerance factor has been widely referred to as a guide in 2D perovskite synthesis.49–52 Therefore, we believe that the tolerance factor can also be adopted as a supportive empirical criterion for estimating the stability of 2D perovskites.
Furthermore, we calculate the decomposition energy of CsSbCl4 to assess its stability along the following two decomposition paths:
Pathway (1): CsSbCl4 → SbCl3 + CsCl,(12)
Pathway (2): 3CsSbCl4 → Cs3Sb2Cl9 + SbCl3.(13)
Then the decomposition energy Ed can be defined as,
Pathway (1): Ed = ESbCl3 + ECsCl − ECsSbCl4,(14)
Pathway (2): Ed = ECs3Sb2Cl9 + ESbCl3 − 3ECsSbCl4.(15)
The calculated decomposition energies of CsSbCl4 are −0.023 and −0.09 eV per atom along the paths (1) and (2), respectively. That is to say, the total energy of CsSbCl4 is slightly higher than that of its corresponding decomposition products (see Fig. S5†). The negative decomposition energies are undesirable for long-term stability owing to the possibility of decomposition. However, the absolute values of its decomposition energy are still smaller than that of the synthesized all-inorganic halide double perovskite Cs2AgBiI6. The decomposition energy of Cs2AgBiI6 is −0.41 eV per atom along the decomposition path 2Cs2AgBiI6 → Cs3Bi2I9 + 2AgI + CsI.53,54 Further examples include MAPbI3, which has a decomposition energy of −0.09 eV (ref. 55) and has also been synthesized in experiments. Therefore, we believe that the synthesis of CsSbCl4 is possible as well due to its small decomposition energy. Moreover, in order to avoid decomposition of the CsSbCl4 perovskite, one can choose hydrophobic organic molecules, such as PEA (phenethylammonium) and BA (butylammonium), as the A′-site cation, or hexagonal boron nitride flakes as an encapsulation layer at the surfaces of perovskites to improve stability.56
In order to test the mechanical stability of CsSbCl4, we further calculate the elastic constants Cij. It has been known that a 2D material is mechanically stable if the Born criteria of C11C22 − C122 > 0 and C66 > 0 are satisfied.57 For CsSbCl4, our calculated elastic constants are C11 = C22 = 24.03, C12 = 16.62, and C66 = 18.12 N m−1, which satisfy the above-mentioned Born criteria. We thus conclude that CsSbCl4 is mechanically stable.
3.2 Electronic properties
Due to the heavy atom Sb contained in the current perovskite CsSbCl4, it is imperative to check the important spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect on electronic properties. We calculate the electronic band structures of few-layer and bulk CsSbCl4 by the PBE method with and without taking the SOC effect into consideration. Fig. S6† indicates that the SOC has a remarkable effect on the bandgap and band edge dispersion. Here we would like to take the 1-layer CsSbCl4 as an example to show the SOC effect. One obvious effect of SOC on the band structure of 1-layer CsSbCl4 is the large reduction of the bandgap (0.25 eV), which amounts to roughly 36% of the bandgap obtained by using PBE without SOC. The reduction mainly results from the spin-splitting (0.47 eV) of the lowest two vacant bands, which would be degenerate if the SOC is neglected. It is notable that SOC has distinct effects on the CBM. The reason is that the strong SOC is attributed mainly to the Sb-p orbitals, which are dominant in density of states (DOS) near the CBM. Meanwhile, the VBM mainly derives from the Cl-p orbitals, which have negligible SOC effects. Furthermore, given that the GGA-1/2 method with the SOC effect is in good agreement with experimental and GW + SOC results for many semiconductors,58 we thus calculate the band structures of CsSbCl4 by combining the PBE and GGA-1/2 approach including the important SOC effect in our following calculations.
Let us now investigate the important electronic structures of layered CsSbCl4 perovskites. We first calculate the band structures of few-layer and bulk CsSbCl4 as shown in Fig. S7.† The 1-, 2-, and 3-layer CsSbCl4 perovskites have direct bandgaps of 1.58, 1.57, and 1.44 eV, respectively, with both the CBM and the VBM located at the Γ-point. The bulk CsSbCl4 has an indirect (direct) bandgap of 1.38 (1.41) eV with the CBM at the M-point and VBM at the A-point. The bandgap of CsSbCl4 increases from the bulk to 3-layer to 1-layer due to the quantum confinement effect. In particular, Fig. 2a and b show that the bandgaps of 3-layer and bulk CsSbCl4 are in the optimal bandgap region of 1.10–1.44 eV for a single-junction solar cell, according to the SQ-limit model.39 They are smaller than that of MAPbI3 and even closer to the optimal bandgap of 1.34 eV. The partial density of states (PDOS) of CsSbCl4 in Fig. 2a and b demonstrates that the CBM is mainly dominated by the p orbitals of Sb, and the p orbitals of Cl have a minor contribution, while the p (s) orbitals of Cl (Sb) have a major (minor) contribution to the VBM. Like other halide perovskites, the A-site atom (Cs) has scarcely any direct contribution to the CBM and VBM states.61 The corresponding partial charge densities of the CBM and VBM in 3-layer CsSbCl4 are also presented in Fig. 2c, which gives a more intuitive picture than the aforementioned PDOS. Fig. 2c clearly shows that the states at the CBM and VBM are localized on the Sb and Cl atoms, consistent with the PDOS shown in Fig. 2a and b.

(c) Corresponding partial charge densities of the CBM and VBM (ρ = 1.5 × 10−3 eÅ−3) in 3-layer CsSbCl4. (d) Schematics of the energy diagram for the functional layers in the perovskite solar cells comprising the ETL, perovskite absorption layer CsSbCl4, and HTL.59,60 
It is also noticed that CsSbCl4 exhibits a crossover from a direct- to an indirect-gap semiconductor with increasing thickness, which is similar to the well-known 2D semiconductor MoS2.62 Generally, 2D semiconductors exhibit distinct electronic structures from their 3D counterparts due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the dimension reduction. Comparing the density of states in 3D and 2D materials, one can easily observe the different laws of electron motion.63
The bulk CsSbCl4 is a quasi-direct bandgap material with a slightly larger direct bandgap (1.41 eV) than indirect bandgap (1.38 eV). Indirect-gap materials are unfavourable for luminescence due to weak carrier recombination. However, this seemingly undesirable feature may make the indirect-band-gap semiconductor suitable as a good absorber of solar cells. In the case of indirect-gap semiconductors, the excited electrons undergo direct transition from the VBM to the conduction band, and then quickly go to the CBM through relaxation. It can be inferred that the possibility of carrier recombination is reduced owing to different location of the CBM and VBM in the momentum-space, which is favourable for the utilization of solar radiation in PV devices. The best evidence is the semiconductor Si with an indirect bandgap which has been widely applied in solar cells.
Compared with bulk structures, 2D few-layer materials frequently exhibit novel physical and chemical properties owing to the quantum confinement effect. In the case of the DJ-phase layered perovskite CsSbCl4, few-layer configurations have larger bandgaps than the bulk counterpart. Simultaneously, the indirect bandgap of bulk CsSbCl4 becomes a direct bandgap when the film thickness decreases to the nanometer level. The few-layer CsSbCl4 shows large estimated exciton binding energy of 0.40 (0.39 and 0.36) eV for 1- (2- and 3-) layer.64 The direct-band-gap feature and large exciton binding energy make the few-layer CsSbCl4 suitable as PL devices.
There are a variety of possible choices of electron-transport layers (ETLs) and hole-transport layers (HTLs) in a practical perovskite solar cell using CsSbCl4 as the absorber layer. It is preferred that the ETL (HTL) possesses good alignment with the perovskite absorber, so as to facilitate electron (hole) transfer from the perovskite absorber into the ETL (HTL) and make the ETL (HTL) a good hole (electron) blocker for the perovskite simultaneously. That is to say, the energy level position of the CBM (VBM) of the ETL should be below the CBM (VBM) of the perovskite absorber for efficient electron transport (hole-blocking), and meanwhile the energy level position of the VBM (CBM) of the HTL is above the VBM (CBM) of the perovskite absorber for efficient hole transport (electron-blocking). For our designed DJ-phase perovskite CsSbCl4, energy alignment is shown in Fig. 2d, in which the chosen ETLs (HTLs) have suitable band offsets with a CsSbCl4 absorber layer as discussed above.59,60 Note that the vacuum energy level is chosen as the reference level and set to 0 eV for the comparison of electron energy levels in different materials following the Anderson rule.65 Then the energy levels of the CBM and VBM of CsSbCl4 can be calculated according to Fig. S8.† The corresponding work function, ionization energy, and electron affinity are 4.50, 5.20, and 3.77 eV, respectively.
3.3 Optical properties
To understand the optical properties of CsSbCl4, we calculate the absorption coefficients of CsSbCl4 as shown in Fig. 3a. For comparison, the absorption coefficients of well-explored PV materials Si, GaAs, and MAPbI3 are plotted as well. As shown in Fig. 3a, the band edges of 3-layer and bulk CsSbCl4 are within the optimal bandgap range (1.10–1.44 eV), and those of 1-layer and 2-layer CsSbCl4 are close to the aforementioned optimal bandgap range in accordance with the SQ-limit. The absorption edge generates a bathochromic shift and moves even closer to the optimal value owing to a weaker quantum confinement effect as the layer number increases. The absorption coefficient of CsSbCl4 is one order of magnitude higher than that of the traditional PV materials GaAs and Si, and on par with that of the well-known PV material MAPbI3 in the whole visible range.66,67 Particularly, the absorption coefficient of bulk CsSbCl4 is up to 2–3 × 105 cm−1 in the visible region, which is similar to that of MAPbI3, and very favourable for light absorption. Therefore, the DJ-phase CsSbCl4 can be recognized as a promising absorber of solar cells due to its desirable bandgap and excellent absorption coefficient in the visible-light region.

The data of widely used solar-cell semiconductors MAPbI3, GaAs, and Si are also plotted for comparison.66,67 (b) The orbital characteristics of the VBM and CBM together with the allowed interband optical transition in CsSbCl4. (c) The transition dipole moment of bulk CsSbCl4. The corresponding band structure is also shown in the inset. 
To deeply understand the excellent interband optical transition on par with MAPbI3 in Sb-based DJ perovskites, we also present the orbital characteristics of the VBM and CBM in Fig. 3b. Notably, our current perovskite CsSbCl4 is an ionic crystal and, therefore, the interband optical absorption is determined largely by the intra-atomic transitions rather than the inter-atomic transitions. In accordance with the transition selection rule derived from the Fermi's Golden rule,71 for a dipole-allowed transition, such as transition between |s〉 and |p〉 orbitals, the valence band states |v〉 and the conduction band states |c〉 should have opposite parity to ensure 〈c||v〉 ≠ 0, where 〈c||v〉 is the optical transition matrix. As for CsSbCl4, the VBM is determined by Sb lone-pair s orbitals together with Cl-p orbitals, and the CBM is dominated by the Sb-p orbitals as well as Cl-s and p orbitals, resulting in s ↔ p intra-atomic transitions at Sb and Cl sites, which is similar to MAPbI3 with transitions happening on Pb and I sites.72 This interpretation can be confirmed partly by the transition dipole moments (TDMs), defined as the squares of the dipole transition matrix elements P2. The calculated TDMs between the band edges of the bulk CsSbCl4 are shown in Fig. 3c. Obviously, the TDMs of bulk CsSbCl4 have a large value at the A-point. Its TDM still has a remarkable value at the M-point, although it drops quickly from the A-point to M-point. For comparison, the TDMs for the 3-layer CsSbCl4 are also given in Fig. S9,† which shows parity-allowed and strong transitions at the Γ-point. Therefore, it is the unique lone-pair s-electron configuration in Sb3+ and the strong allowed transitions between band edges that enhance the optical absorption strength of CsSbCl4.
3.4 Carrier effective mass and mobility

Table 1 shows that the carrier effective masses in few-layer CsSbCl4 are 0.1 m0, approximately, which are smaller than those in the widely used PV materials MAPbI3 and Si, and similar to that of GaAs. The small carrier effective mass results from the sharp band edge dispersion in the band structure shown in Fig. 2a. This in turn gives rise to a large carrier mobility. The calculated carrier mobilities in few-layer CsSbCl4 can reach 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, which is on par with those in MAPbI3, Si, and GaAs. Moreover, the carrier mobility in 2D perovskite CsSbCl4 increases with the layer number from 1 to 3. This behavior results from the increase of elastic modulus C with the film thickening. Furthermore, the balanced carrier mobility in few-layer CsSbCl4 is very beneficial to carrier transport.

As for bulk CsSbCl4, the carrier effective mass in the 〈100〉 direction is small and about 0.1 m0, which is smaller than that in the 〈001〉 direction. The carrier mobility can reach up to 102–104 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature. The in-plane carrier mobilities are larger than out-of-plane mobilities due to the smaller effective mass and larger elastic modulus C in the 〈100〉 direction. The out-of-plane carrier transport in layered perovskite absorbers is relatively poor due to the existence of a gap between the two adjacent layers, which is a general problem of layered materials and unfavourable for carrier extraction from the absorber to the ETL and HTL. Several new approaches have been proved to be active to improve the out-of-plane carrier transport through interstratified A′ engineering, such as constructing charge transport channels through interlayer S–S interactions in the gap of (MTEA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 (ref. 15) or achieving better energy level matching between the inorganic Pb–I layers and organic salts (perylene, pyrene and naphthalene) in (R–NH3)2PbI4.51 Although bulk CsSbCl4 has a small out-of-plane electron mobility, it has a quite large hole mobility that is comparable with that of the in-plane one and even greater than that of the well-known PV materials, such as MAPbI3, Si, and GaAs. Therefore, through appropriate modulation, DJ perovskites have a great chance of realizing large out-of-plane carrier mobility owing to their intrinsic merits outlined in the introduction. From the viewpoint of carrier effective mass and mobility, the DJ-phase CsSbCl4 perovskites are also quite suitable materials for solar cells.
3.5 Theoretical PCE

Fig. 4a shows that the theoretical PCE based on the SLME model increases monotonically with the film thickness of CsSbCl4 due to the growth of absorbance. In particular, the 3 μm-thick CsSbCl4 film exhibits a PCE of 27.16%, together with ISC = 31.77 mA cm−2 and VOC = 0.97 V as detailed in Fig. 4b. For the practical thickness (∼0.5 μm) of the absorber layer in a solar cell, the PCE of CsSbCl4 falls between that of MAPbI3 (CsPbI3) and GaAs.66 The lower PCE of CsSbCl4 in comparison to MAPbI3 is largely attributed to its indirect transition mechanism. The bulk CsSbCl4 has an indirect bandgap, and meanwhile the direct transition from the valence band to the conduction band is dipole-allowed at the A-point (see Fig. 3c and 4c). Therefore, the minimum allowed bandgap Edag is just its direct bandgap, 1.41 eV, which is slightly larger than its indirect bandgap 1.38 eV. Then one can get the parameter fr, i.e., 0.31, smaller than 1, which corresponds to the direct allowed bandgap material, such as MAPbI3. Smaller fr means larger nonradiative recombination loss and lower PCE in general.40,41 In order to ensure the precision of our SLME calculations, we also calculate the PCE of MAPbI3 as a function of the absorber thickness, which is in accordance with the results in ref. 66 (see Fig. S10†).
 Fig. 4  (a) The PCE of CsSbCl4 calculated by using the SLME method as a function of the film thickness. The corresponding results of MAPbI3, CsPbI3, and GaAs are also given for reference.66 (b) The I–V curve of a 3 μm-thick CsSbCl4 film and its key parameters. (c) The optical transition mechanism of bulk CsSbCl4. (d) The calculated PCE of a 3 μm-thick CsSbCl4 as a function of solar concentration ratio X. The inset shows the schematic of the concentrated solar cell, in which the Fresnel lens is used to concentrate solar energy. 
Considering that the area of perovskite solar cells is usually very small, we further consider concentrator photovoltaics (CPVs) to improve the utilization of sunlight. Generally, the PCE can be enhanced by using a solar concentrator such as Fresnel lens to focus the sunlight to a small area of the absorber layer. Fig. 4d indicates that the calculated PCE of CsSbCl4 increases monotonously with the concentration ratio X, and reaches up to 28.69% at X = 1000 Suns. Note that the AM 1.5D standard spectrum38 is used to calculate the PCE in this case. Then the PCE for 1 Sun is 23.78%, smaller than the PCE (27.16%) calculated by using the AM 1.5G spectrum in Fig. 4b. The reason is that the diffused portion of the solar energy is not included in the AM 1.5D spectrum. Since the temperature tolerance of solar cells usually increases with X changing from I, Br to Cl, the inorganic CsSbCl4 is well suited for CPVs due to its improved stability compared to Br and I-based ones.
To study the performance of CsSbCl4 in a more realistic situation, we further used the wxAMPS code to simulate a TiO2/CsSbCl4/spiro-OMeTAD junction, which is the core part of a solar cell as shown in Fig. 5a. Here, the thickness of the solar absorber is set as 0.5 μm, and TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD are chosen as the ETL and HTL, respectively. For reference, we first simulate a TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD junction, which has the same ETL and HTL as a CsSbCl4-based junction. The calculated PCE of the MAPbI3-based junction is 22.64%, which is consistent with the experimental value (see Table S2†).76 Therefore, the simulation parameters77 (please refer to Table S3† for details) are reasonable. By using the simulation parameters listed in Table S3,† the estimated PCE of the CsSbCl4-based junction is 20.07% (see Fig. 5b), in which the out-of-plane electron (hole) mobility of 501 (22806) cm2 V−1 s−1 from Table 1 is used because the absorber layer planes are usually parallel to the interfaces between the ETL (HTL) and absorber layer.
 Fig. 5  (a) The schematic illustration of an actual solar cell. Generally, the ETL is a high-k dielectric (TiO2 with εr ∼ 75–80 (ref. 73 and 74)) and the electrode is a metal, which will significantly reduce the exciton binding energy to several meV in a real solar-cell device because of the enhanced dielectric screening effect. (b) The I–V curve and the key parameters of an actual 0.5 μm-thick CsSbCl4 absorber solar cell [please refer to (a)] simulated by applying the wxAMPS code, where the layer planes of CsSbCl4 are parallel to the surface of the ETL and HTL, and the carriers move along the out-of-plane direction (see the inset). (c) The short-circuit current density ISC and open-circuit voltage VOC together with (d) PCE as a function of the defect density in the CsSbCl4 absorber. 
In reality, various types of defects, such as grain boundaries and vacancies in the absorber layer, will significantly lead to carrier recombination and further affect the overall performance of the solar-cell devices. Fig. 5c and d show the influence of the absorber defect density on the key parameters including ISC, VOC, and PCE. When the defect density decreases from 1017 to 1015 cm−3, they increase quickly due to the reduced carrier recombination rate. As the defect density decreases even further (below 1015 cm−3), ISC approaches a constant of 21.4 mA cm−2, and VOC still increases. Consequently, the increase of PCE slows down slightly. This clearly shows that the PCE can be enhanced greatly by decreasing the absorber defect density.
3.6 Comparison between CsSbCl4 and the commonly used PV materials
In Fig. 6, we compare comprehensively the electronic, optical, and transport properties among 3-layer and bulk CsSbCl4 together with the well-known PV materials MAPbI3, GaAs, and Si.68–70,75 Compared with 3D MAPbI3, the DJ-phase CsSbCl4 exhibits a unique layered structure and has different arrangement modes of M–X octahedra (M = Sb, Pb), which directly leads to its new PV properties. The direct bandgap of 3-layer (bulk) CsSbCl4 is 1.44 eV (1.41 eV), which falls in the range of the optimal bandgap (1.10–1.44 eV), and is smaller than that of MAPbI3 (∼1.50–1.60 eV) and GaAs (1.52 eV). In addition, the DJ-phase CsSbCl4 exhibits a great absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1 in the visible region, which is comparable with that of MAPbI3 (∼105 cm−1) and one order of magnitude higher than that of traditional PV materials GaAs and Si (∼104 cm−1). The sharp band edge dispersion directly results in a smaller electron (hole) effective mass along the 〈100〉 direction, i.e. 0.08 (0.05) m0 and 0.12 (0.08) m0 in 3-layer and bulk CsSbCl4, respectively, which are similar to that of GaAs and smaller than that of MAPbI3 and Si. Consequently, both 3-layer and bulk CsSbCl4 have high carrier mobility (∼102–104 cm2 V−1 s−1), comparable with MAPbI3 (∼103 cm2 V−1 s−1).
 Fig. 6  A comprehensive comparison of the crystal structure, bandgap, electronic dispersion, optical absorption, carrier effective mass and mobility, and PCE among the promising solar cell material CsSbCl4 and the well-known PV materials MAPbI3, GaAs, and Si.68–70,75 
The optimal direct bandgap, strong absorption ability in the visible range, and large carrier mobility of CsSbCl4 make it advantageous for the utilization of sunlight. Therefore, the SLME of CsSbCl4 can reach up to 27% at a film thickness of 3 μm, which is slightly lower than that of MAPbI3 (∼30%) and comparable with that of GaAs (∼28%). The simulated PCE of the TiO2/CsSbCl4/spiro-OMeTAD junction by using the wxAMPS code is ∼20%. These characteristics clearly show that bulk CsSbCl4 has great potential as the absorber layer of solar cells. Additionally, few-layer CsSbCl4 would be a promising PL semiconductor owing to its direct bandgap properties and large exciton binding energy ∼0.4 eV.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed an all-inorganic Sb-based DJ CsSbCl4 perovskite, and systemically investigated its electronic, optical, and transport characteristics by using first-principles calculations. Our results on the tolerance factor and formation energy indicate that CsSbCl4 has better structural stability than MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I). Its optical absorption coefficient in the visible range is of the order of magnitude of 105 cm−1, which is comparable with that of the well-known PV material MAPbI3 and better than that of GaAs and Si. Particularly, the bulk CsSbCl4 exhibits a direct bandgap of 1.41 eV, which falls in the range of the optimal bandgap (1.10–1.44 eV) according to the SQ-limit model and is highly conducive to solar cells. Moreover, the bulk CsSbCl4 has a small carrier effective mass (∼0.1 m0) and high mobility (∼103–104 cm2 V−1 s−1) along the in-plane direction. Its hole mobility in the out-of-plane direction is comparable with the in-plane one, which demonstrates the advantage of DJ perovskites over other layered ones. Based on these favourable properties, CsSbCl4 achieves a PCE of 27% at a layer thickness of 3 μm within the framework of the SLME model. When being used in a more realistic situation, e.g. a TiO2/CsSbCl4/spiro-OMeTAD junction, CsSbCl4 can still make it reach a theoretical efficiency of ∼20%. We expect that these new DJ-phase CsSbCl4 perovskites can stimulate future research interest in novel non-toxic, stable, and highly efficient PV materials and devices.
