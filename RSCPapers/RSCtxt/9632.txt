    , Accepted 1st May 2014First published on 2nd May 2014AbstractWe report the molecular interactions between cobalt tris(bipyridyl) [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and additives of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in a redox electrolyte and the effects on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The interactions and consequent effects led us to the concept of a TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complex, where the [Co(bpy)3]3+ ion was surrounded by TBP molecules via weak ion–dipole attractions. The TBP molecules were able to bi-functionally shield both [Co(bpy)3]3+ ions and the TiO2 surface from undesirable charge recombination, achieving a greater enhancement of open-circuit voltage (VOC) of about 200 mV than 140 mV in the iodide (I−/I3−) system where TBP passivated the TiO2 surface only. The VOC–JSC trade-off problem was thereby mitigated. Our discovery of the molecular interactions between additives and redox species would stimulate the engineering of new additives or redox mediators to improve the performance of DSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are being actively studied because of their potential use as clean, renewable alternatives for the conversion of sunlight into electricity.1,2 The use of inexpensive, environmentally friendly materials and a simple fabrication process enhance their appeal. Photons that strike a DSC generate photoexcited electrons when they are absorbed by a dye-sensitizer. The photoexcited electrons are then transferred to a mesoporous TiO2 film and diffuse through the film to be collected by a transparent electrode, leaving the dye-sensitizer oxidized. A redox mediator reduces the oxidized dye-sensitizer by transferring electrons from the counter electrode. High light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies are being sought for future commercialization of DSCs. However, the performance of DSCs has so far been inadequate to enable them to compete with conventional silicon solar cells. Nevertheless, their performance has improved significantly in the past 10 years, and high power conversion efficiencies above 11% can be easily achieved.3–6
Today, high performance DSCs can be obtained by using either iodide/triiodide I−/I3− or cobalt [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolytes as the redox mediator. In the past, the I−/I3− electrolyte was the traditional choice as the redox mediator for DSCs. However, the I−/I3− electrolyte is far from being an ideal redox mediator for DSCs. It has several drawbacks, including its high redox potential, which limits the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of DSCs; its competitive absorption of visible light; its volatility; and its corrosiveness.7,8 Consequently, there has been an active search for new and better redox couples. Among the potential candidates, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ complexes have emerged to become the redox couples most likely to replace I−/I3− because of their high and tunable redox potentials.9–14 However, the charge recombination rate of cobalt-based DSCs is high, and recombination lowers the VOC of DSCs.15–18 Therefore, suppression of recombination in cobalt-based DSCs is very crucial to obtain a high VOC and thereby taking full advantage of their lower redox potential.
The conventional method of enhancing the VOC in a DSC is the addition of a potential-determining additive (PDA) such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP).3–5 In the I−/I3− system, the adsorption of TBP, bearing an electron donating group, onto the TiO2 surface is believed to shift the electronic states of TiO2 toward higher energies at the same total electron density in the TiO2 film. The result is an increase of the VOC, but it is always accompanied by a decrease of JSC.19–22 Previous studies have used three-electrode system DSCs to systematically evaluate the effects of PDAs, including TBP, on the quasi-Fermi levels (QFLs) of TiO2 films under short-circuit (SC) and open-circuit (OC) conditions in I−/I3− based DSC systems.23,24 The different QFL values observed under SC and OC conditions in these studies have provided information that has facilitated the effort to solve the JSC–VOC trade-off caused by PDAs. In addition, some studies have reported that TBP adsorption on the TiO2 surface can passivate the TiO2 surface and reduce the interaction of redox species with TiO2, the result being a reduction of charge recombination.20,25 Other studies have found that TBP addition causes no significant change in the electron lifetime.26,27 In comparison with the well investigated PDA-enhanced I−/I3− redox mediator, however, few studies have been carried out to investigate the molecular interactions in the cobalt-PDA based system. The positively charged cobalt-based redox mediators should exhibit very different behaviour from the negatively charged I−/I3− redox mediator, especially in the presence of TBP that has an electron donating group. Therefore, it is of importance to further study the cobalt-PDA system and reveal the effect on the device performance of DSCs.
In this study, we discovered a noticeable molecular interaction between the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediator and TBP. The [Co(bpy)3]3+ ion is surrounded by TBP molecules which would shield the [Co(bpy)3]3+ ion from receiving electrons from the TiO2 conduction band, hindering the undesirable electron transfer from TiO2 to [Co(bpy)3]3+ ions, i.e. suppressing the recombination. Therefore, we found that the suppression of recombination by TBP in a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ DSC system is not only via surface passivation on the TiO2 surface but also through the shielding of [Co(bpy)3]3+ ions by TBP molecules. The discovery of TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complexes allowed us to achieve a higher VOC with less reduction of the JSC compared to that in the I−/I3− redox system. This study paves a way for the molecular design of new additives or redox mediators to obtain DSCs with sufficiently high performance for future commercialization.
Experimental method
Dye-sensitized cells
The photoanode consisted of a screen-printed, sintered TiO2 film with a thickness of 5 μm and an area of 0.25 m2 on a transparent, conducting oxide (TCO)-coated glass. The TiO2 was then dipped into a dye solution consisting of a 0.3 mM MK-2 dye in acetone and left overnight. The dye-coated TiO2 was sandwiched with platinum (Pt)-coated TCO glass as the counter electrode. A heated 40 μm Surlyn spacer was used to seal the sandwich structure. The redox electrolyte was injected through a pre-drilled hole on the counter electrode side to fill out the space inside the sandwich structure. The hole was then sealed using a Surlyn spacer and a cover glass. Two types of redox electrolytes were considered: the I−/I3− electrolyte consisted of 0.6 M dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, and 0.1 M LiI in acetonitrile; the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte consisted of 0.283 M [CoII(bpy)3](BF4)2, 0.049 M [CoIII(bpy)3](BF4)3, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile. We studied the effects of four TBP concentrations: 0 M (no TBP), 0.2 M, 0.5 M, and 0.8 M.
Photovoltaic, charge extraction method (CEM) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements
The J–V characterization curves of the cells were measured under standard air mass 1.5 simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co., Japan). A black mask with an aperture area of 0.23 cm2 was placed on top of the cells during each measurement.28 The charge extraction method (CEM) was used to monitor the shift in the conduction band of TiO2.20 The DSCs were illuminated under open-circuit conditions for 5 s to obtain a steady state. The light was then removed, and the cells were switched to short-circuit conditions to extract the charges generated at that specific light intensity. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) was used to measure the electron lifetime of the cells.29 The IMVS response was obtained by using a potentiostat (Solartron1287) equipped with a frequency-response analyzer (Solartron1255B) while the cells were illuminated under open-circuit conditions with a sinusoidal-modulated light source at a specific intensity within the frequency range of 0.1 to 106 Hz.
Quasi-Fermi level (QFL) measurements
The QFLs were determined using a direct method based on a three-electrode DSC, the design of which has been explained in detail previously.23,24,30 The third (Ti) electrode, 1 mm wide and 100 nm thick, was deposited on the top side of the TiO2 film by sputtering. The QFLs of the TiO2 film were monitored on the Ti electrode against the Pt counter electrode by using a potentiostat (Potentiostat/Galvanostat PS-08).
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
The FTIR spectra were obtained by using a Jasco FT/IR6100 spectrometer. The measurement was performed on the TiO2 film exposed to 0.283 M [CoII(bpy)3](BF4)2 only and the TiO2 film exposed to 0.049 M [CoIII(bpy)3](BF4)3 only. Acetonitrile was used as the solvent. The TBP concentration used for the measurement was 0.8 M.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and TBP. We performed FTIR measurements to investigate the possibility of molecular interactions between TBP, [Co(bpy)3]2+, and [Co(bpy)3]3+ ions on TiO2. Fig. 1b and c show the FTIR spectra of TiO2 films exposed to [Co(bpy)3]2+ only, [Co(bpy)3]2+ and TBP, [Co(bpy)3]3+ only, [Co(bpy)3]3+ and TBP, and TBP only. Peaks corresponding to C–H bond stretching of the heterocyclic rings are shown in Fig. 1b. The C–H bonds on the bipyridine rings of [Co(bpy)3]2+ and [Co(bpy)3]3+ are represented by the absorption peaks at 3080 cm−1 and 3088 cm−1, respectively.31,32 In contrast, the C–H bonds on the pyridine ring of TBP molecules are represented by the adsorption peak at 3060 cm−1 in the spectra of the TBP only adsorbed TiO2 film.32 Higher wavenumbers associated with the bipyridine rings of [Co(bpy)3]3+ indicate relatively stronger bonds between the Co3+ ion and bipyridine ligands that form the [Co(bpy)3]3+ complex. With TBP addition, there was no significant change in the C–H (heterocyclic rings) bond absorption peaks of TiO2 films exposed to [Co(bpy)3]2+. However, with the addition of TBP, a 6 cm−1 blue shift in the absorption peak of C–H (heterocyclic rings) bonds was apparent on TiO2 films exposed to [Co(bpy)3]3+. The blue shift of the adsorption peaks indicates an interaction between [Co(bpy)3]3+ with TBP molecules, but such an interaction was undetectable with [Co(bpy)3]2+. In the TBP only adsorbed TiO2 spectra of Fig. 1c, the adsorption peak at 1408 cm−1 is associated with the CC stretching band of the pyridine moiety in TBP molecules.33 The corresponding peak is also observed in both TiO2 films exposed to [Co(bpy)3]2+ and [Co(bpy)3]3+ with TBP addition, confirming the adsorption of TBP on these films. Fig. 1c also shows a 10 cm−1 blue shift in the absorption peak of the bipyridine ring stretching mode at 1440 cm−1 on the TiO2 film exposed to [Co(bpy)3]3+ when TBP is added.33 In contrast, no peak shift was observed on addition of TBP to the TiO2 film exposed to [Co(bpy)3]2+. The blue shift represents higher vibrational energy of the bipyridine rings on the TiO2 film exposed to [Co(bpy)3]3+ after the addition of TBP. This result indicates that the positively charged [Co(bpy)3]3+ can easily attract the TBP molecule, which possesses a lone electron pair and strong donating ability, via weak ion–dipole attractions. As a result, these molecular interactions influence the configuration of [Co(bpy)3]3+ ions and allow the formation of a larger structure, within which the [Co(bpy)3]3+ are weakly bonded to the surrounding TBP molecules. Consequently, the [Co(bpy)3]3+ ion is shielded by the TBP molecules. In this study, we refer to this structure as the TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complex. A similar interaction may also occur between [Co(bpy)3]2+ and TBP molecules. However, the interaction is very weak to detect by FTIR and may be easily disrupted by the surrounding environment in the redox electrolyte such as acetonitrile or anions. The TBP-shielded redox complexes, therefore, cannot occur in the presence of a negatively charged redox mediator, such as I−/I3−.

These spectra reveal the vibration peaks of (b) C–H bonds in the heterocyclic rings and (c) the pyridine and bipyridine heterocyclic rings. The black-dashed lines highlight the peak positions. 
In order to discover the role of the TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complex in DSCs, we fabricated I−/I3−-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs and varied the TBP concentrations. Fig. 2 shows the J–V characterization and dark current curves of the DSCs and the photovoltaic performance is summarised in Table 1. The common “JSC–VOC trade-off” effect caused by TBP was apparent for both types of DSCs; the addition of TBP significantly increased the VOC but caused a minor decrease of the JSC. Fig. 2a and b, however, clearly show that the effect of TBP was different on I−/I3−based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs. In the I−/I3− system, a significant increase in the VOC of about 100 mV was observed with the addition of 0.2 M TBP. A further increase of the TBP concentration resulted in only a slight increase of the VOC; the addition of 0.8 M TBP increased the VOC by only an additional 20 mV. The increase of VOC was closely associated with a decrease of dark current density (Fig. 2a). The addition of 0.2 M TBP decreased the dark current, which remained unchanged when the TBP concentration was increased further. The increase of the VOC caused by the addition of TBP was not without an inevitable decrease of JSC. However, the magnitude of the rate of decline of the JSC diminished as the TBP concentration was increased. The addition of 0.8 M TBP caused an 18% increase of the VOC and a 19% reduction of the JSC. This result is comparable to the results reported in another study of the I−/I3− system.25

The addition of TBP resulted in a more favourable trade-off between VOC and JSC in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ system (Fig. 2b). Without the addition of TBP, the VOC of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs (0.63 V) was not significantly higher than the VOC of I−/I3−-based DSCs (0.58 V), despite the lower redox potential of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediator. The severity of charge recombination loss in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ system was clearly apparent when no TBP was added. This effect was also manifested by the high dark current density (Fig. 2b, lower panel). The addition of TBP, even at a concentration as low as 0.2 M, produced a VOC increase of 140 mV in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs. Unlike the I−/I3−-based DSCs, a further increase of the TBP concentration resulted in a further increase of VOC. A remarkable VOC increase of 200 mV was observed with the addition of 0.8 M TBP. This increase of VOC was accompanied by a reduction of dark current density. Moreover, the 32% increase of VOC associated with the addition of 0.8 M TBP resulted in only an 18% reduction of JSC, the indication being that at the same TBP concentration, there was less JSC–VOC trade-off in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs than that in the I−/I3−-based DSCs. The difference in the performance of I−/I3− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs is believed to be due to TBP-shielded redox complexes, which can exist in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ but not in I−/I3−.
To elucidate the mitigation of JSC–VOC trade-off in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs by the TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complexes, it was first necessary to evaluate the factors that contributed to VOC. The VOC is determined by the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi level (QFL) of TiO2 and the redox potential of the mediator. Based on the redox potentials of the mediators, it was logical to hypothesize that the higher VOC of a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSC was due to the lower redox potential of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ compared to the I−/I3− based DSC. However, when there was no addition of TBP, the VOC of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs (0.63 V) was not significantly higher than that of I−/I3−-based DSCs (0.58 V). Thus addition of TBP was clearly important to achieve the high VOC in a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based system, indicating the significant role of TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complexes. Determining the QFL values relative to the corresponding redox potentials was crucial to explain the significant VOC increase of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based systems compared to the I−/I3−-based systems at the same TBP concentration.

Fig. 3a shows a plot of QFL versus redox potential as a function of bias voltage. At open circuit, the QFLOC was equal to the VOC. As the applied bias was reduced, the QFL downward shifted (decreased) because of the reduction of electron density in the TiO2 film as electrons flowed out to the external load. As the applied bias was reduced to zero (i.e. at short-circuit), the QFL is referred to as the QFL under short-circuit conditions (QFLSC). The QFL under short-circuit conditions was measured at the Ti electrode, which was located on the side of the TiO2 film furthest from the collecting TCO electrode. The QFL of the TiO2 near the TCO electrode would be equal to the Fermi level of the TCO glass. Generally, the QFL of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs is higher than that of I−/I3−-based DSCs due to the lower redox potential of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediator, i.e. a larger energy gap between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential. The values of QFLSC and QFLOC can be extracted from Fig. 3a and are presented with respect to TBP concentrations in Fig. 3b. Shifts of the QFLs (ΔQFLs) as a function of TBP concentration under short-circuit and open-circuit conditions were apparent for both I−/I3−-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs. Under short-circuit conditions, the shifts of the QFLsSC were approximately equal at all TBP concentrations for both I−/I3−-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs (ΔQFLSC,0.8 M TBP ∼ 140 mV), whereas under open-circuit conditions, the ΔQFLOC of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs (ΔQFLOC,0.8 M TBP ∼ 200 mV) was significantly higher than that of the I−/I3−-based DSCs (ΔQFLOC,0.8 M TBP ∼ 140 mV). Moreover, in I−/I3−-based DSCs, the upward shift (increase) of QFLSC (ΔQFLSC,0.8 M TBP = 140 mV) due to TBP was similar to the upward shift of QFLOC (ΔQFLOC,0.8 M TBP = 150 mV). In contrast, ΔQFLOC,0.8 M TBP (200 mV) of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs was significantly higher than the ΔQFLSC,0.8 M TBP (140 mV). Hence, in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs, a greater shift of the QFLOC compared to the QFLSC was apparent, whereas the shifts of the QFLOC and QFLSC were the same for I−/I3−-based DSCs.

(b) The QFLSC and QFLOC values of I−/I3−-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs without TBP and in the presence of 0.2 M, 0.5 M and 0.8 M TBP. “SC” and “OC” denote “short-circuit” and “open-circuit”, respectively. 
The QFL of TiO2 depends on the conduction band (EC) of TiO2 and on the charge density (ne) accumulated in the TiO2, according to the following equation:34 (1)where Ne is the density of conduction band states in TiO2.
According to eqn (1), the QFL depends on the shift in EC and also on the electron density in the conduction band of TiO2. Thus, the observed upward shift in the QFL due to TBP can be attributed to (1) the shift in EC (ΔEC), (2) higher electron density, or (3) the combined effects.20 Reduction in charge recombination is associated with an increase of the charge density in TiO2. It is generally accepted that the increase of VOC caused by TBP is due to an upward shift of the TiO2 conduction band (EC), the result being a larger potential difference between the EC and the redox potential. This larger potential difference leads to a higher VOC, regardless of the type of dye-sensitizer used, whether Ru-based dyes25 or organic dyes.27,33,35 Although the upward EC shift increases the VOC, it also pushes the EC closer to the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the dye-sensitizer, the result being a decrease of the kinetics for charge injection from the dye to TiO2 and a lowering of the JSC. As a result, a JSC–VOC trade-off is always observed when TBP is added to the redox mediator.
We used the charge extraction technique to investigate the EC shift of TiO2 due to TBP, because this technique allows for a direct determination of the density of trapped electrons over the energy interval Ef,redox to (Ef,redox + EC).20 By observing the shift in the amount of charge extracted with respect to the open-circuit voltage, it is possible to determine the shift in EC due to TBP in nanocrystalline TiO2.20 A plot of charge extracted as a function of the open-circuit potential in I−/I3−-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs (Fig. 4) revealed that with TBP, a higher open-circuit potential is required to extract an equal amount of charge. This requirement is a confirmation of an upward shift in the EC of TiO2 for both I−/I3−-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs. The amount of charge extracted was generally lower in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs because of their higher recombination rate. The fact that no significant difference in the EC shift was found between I−/I3−-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs shows that the EC shifts of the TiO2 were similar, regardless of the redox mediator used. An approximately 100 mV shift in EC was observed with the addition of 0.2 M TBP, followed by a relatively small EC shift (∼40 mV) with a further increase of the TBP concentration for both redox systems. The similarity of the shifts in the TiO2EC also reveals that approximately the same amount of TBP was adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface, regardless of the different types of redox mediators used. Moreover, the large shift in the QFL under open-circuit conditions in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based system due to TBP may not have been solely the result of an EC shift, but may also have been due to the change of the electron density in TiO2.

The electron density in TiO2 is related to the charge recombination rate, which is reflected by the electron lifetime. Fig. 5 shows the plots of the electron lifetime vs. the open-circuit potential. The higher recombination rate of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs versus I−/I3−-based DSCs results in a lower electron lifetime of the former. Fig. 5a reveals the insignificant increase in electron lifetime with increasing TBP concentration in an I−/I3−-based system. About a 100 ms increase in the lifetime was apparent with the addition of 0.2 M TBP, and with a further increase of TBP, no significant increase in the lifetime could be detected. This result confirms that minimal protection against recombination is provided by TBP in I−/I3−-based DSCs. The effect of TBP in the I−/I3− redox system has been widely studied.20,26,36 However, the effect of TBP on charge recombination is still unclear. Investigation of electron lifetimes by Boschloo et al.20 revealed that a 40% increase in VOC due to TBP was attributable to reduction in charge recombination. In contrast, Nakade et al.26 observed no significant influence of TBP in suppressing charge recombination. Boschloo et al.20 acknowledged this difference by pointing out that the discrepancy was due to the use of different solvents in the redox electrolyte. Boschloo et al.20 used 3-methoxypropionitrile as the solvent, whereas Nakade et al.26 used acetonitrile. The implication was that complex formation between TBP and iodine was higher in the case of 3-methoxypropionitrile than in the case of acetonitrile. Because our redox electrolytes were acetonitrile-based, our results are consistent with these two previous studies. Conversely, Fig. 5b clearly reveals an increase in electron lifetime with TBP concentration in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs. The electron lifetime values of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs without TBP addition, and with 0.2 M, 0.5 M and 0.8 M TBP addition measured at a potential of 0.7 V are 0.4, 8, 10 and 15 ms, respectively. We observed an increase in electron lifetime of about one order of magnitude with the addition of TBP, and increasing the TBP concentration resulted in a further increase of the lifetime, i.e., a reduction in the recombination rate with increasing TBP concentration. Reduction in the recombination rate would result in an increased electron density in TiO2. This result therefore confirms that the enhancement of VOC due to TBP in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs is not only due to a shift in EC but also due to an increase in the electron density of TiO2. This result indicates that there is a greater protection against recombination in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs than in I−/I3−-based DSCs at the same amount of adsorbed TBP, which is mainly due to the TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complexes.

A summary of the shift in the QFLOC, QFLSC, and EC as a function of TBP concentration for both I−/I3−-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based systems (Fig. 6) clearly shows that the QFLSC shift due to TBP was rather similar to the EC shift, regardless of the redox mediator. Moreover, the QFLSC and EC shifts were also similar for the I−/I3−-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs (ΔEC and ΔQFLSC,0.8 M TBP ∼ 150 mV for both systems). Under short-circuit conditions, the electron density in TiO2 is mainly controlled by the transport rate, and thus the loss due to recombination is limited. The QFLSC shift is therefore mainly due to the shift in EC. In contrast, under open-circuit conditions, when J = 0 (i.e., zero transport rate), the loss of electrons due to recombination is mainly responsible for the change in electron density. Hence, by observing the difference in shifts of the EC and QFLOC, it is possible to investigate the effect of TBP on the recombination in the DSCs. The QFLOC shift would be lower than the EC upward shift in the case of more severe recombination, and vice versa. In the I−/I3−-based DSCs (Fig. 6a), the QFLOC shift was almost equal to the EC and QFLSC shifts, the indication being that the increase in VOC due to TBP in this system was mainly due to the EC shift, and there was no significant change in the electron density. This result has been confirmed by Zhang et al.23,24 Therefore, in I−/I3−-based DSCs, TBP does not significantly reduce the recombination loss of electrons in conduction band states. In contrast, Fig. 6b indicates that in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs, the QFLOC shift was higher than the EC and QFLSC shifts as the TBP concentration increased, the indication being that there was a significant increase in the electron density in the TiO2 of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ system due to TBP. This result can only be explained by the suppression of recombination by TBP. In contrast to the I−/I3−-based system, in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs, TBP allowed not only an upward shift in EC, but also a suppression of recombination under open-circuit conditions, the result being a significantly improved VOC. Hence, for the same amount of TBP molecules, their capability to suppress recombination is higher in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs than in I−/I3−-based DSCs. The reason for this is that the free, un-adsorbed TBP molecules in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs are able to interact with the [Co(bpy)3]3+ species which results in the formation of a larger structure, namely the TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complexes. We believe that the TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complexes are responsible for the great suppression of recombination in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs. Consequently, the suppression of recombination in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs causes a greater shift in the QFL of TiO2 under open-circuit conditions than under short-circuit conditions, and thus mitigates the JSC–VOC trade-off.

We have proposed a mechanism to explain the recombination protection by TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complexes in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs, which leads to the enhancement of VOC. We have considered the interactions between redox species and TBP at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface under short-circuit and open-circuit conditions. The TiO2 surface under short-circuit conditions would be less negatively charged than under open-circuit conditions due to the lower electron density under short-circuit conditions compared to open-circuit conditions, as previously determined.24 A similar upward shift in EC for both I−/I3−-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs confirmed that the same amount of TBP was adsorbed on the TiO2 surface under both short-circuit and open-circuit conditions, and that a different redox mediator did not affect the adsorption of TBP onto the TiO2 surface. In the I−/I3−-based DSCs, there was no significant difference in terms of TBP adsorption onto the TiO2 surface, and the similar shifts in the QFLSC and QFLOC showed that there was no difference in the interaction with the TiO2 surface and/or the redox mediator under short circuit and open circuit conditions as shown by the similar shifts in the QFLSC and QFLOC. Negatively charged redox species (I− and I3−) would interact less with the negatively charged TiO2 surface. Any redox species that would come near the TiO2 surface would be easily repelled by the negative polarity of the TiO2 surface. There would also be a minimal interaction between the free TBP and the I−/I3− redox species. The only effect of TBP on I−/I3−-based DSCs is related to the adsorption of TBP molecules onto the surface of TiO2, where TBP acts as an electron-donating molecule, the result being an upward shift of the TiO2-EC. The site where TBP adsorbs would also be able to protect the surface of the TiO2 film from recombination loss, a fact apparent from the slight increase in electron lifetime with addition of TBP. However, there are only a limited number of sites available for TBP adsorption onto the TiO2 surface. Consequently, a major portion of the TiO2 surface is unprotected against recombination. Therefore, an increase in VOC accompanied by a decrease in JSC due to the upward shift of EC is observed. Small further increases in VOC by further addition of TBP provide no significant protection against recombination in I−/I3−-based DSCs.
With [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs, the effect of TBP adsorption is significantly different from the effect with I−/I3−-based DSCs. Fig. 7 illustrates the reason behind the greater enhancement of VOC provided by the TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complexes under both short-circuit and open-circuit conditions. The amount of adsorbed TBP is similar under short-circuit and open-circuit conditions, as indicated by the similar EC shift, despite the electronic conditions of TiO2. Under short-circuit conditions, the positive redox species, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+, are able to come into close proximity with the TiO2 surface. However, due to the less negatively charged TiO2 surface under short-circuit conditions, there are fewer interactions between the redox species and the TiO2 surface (Fig. 7a). When TBP is added to the system, the only significant effect caused by the TBP under short-circuit conditions is therefore an upward shift of the TiO2 energy levels (Fig. 7b). The positively charged, TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complexes that are formed by molecular interactions between the un-adsorbed TBP molecules with the positively-charged [Co(bpy)3]3+ species should have an insignificant effect on the DSC system. In contrast, under open-circuit conditions, during which the TiO2 surface is very negatively charged, the positive redox species are easily attracted to the TiO2 surface and would be expected to position themselves in close proximity to the surface. It is generally detrimental for the oxidized species of the redox mediator, [Co(bpy)3]3+, to be in close proximity with the TiO2 surface because of the potential for undesirable electron transfer to occur from the TiO2 to the oxidized species, i.e. electron loss via recombination, as illustrated in Fig. 7c. However, when TBP is added (Fig. 7d), the addition facilitates two favorable outcomes; (1) TBP absorption onto the TiO2 surface causes an upward shift of the EC, and (2) interactions between TBP molecules and [Co(bpy)3]3+ species lead to the formation of TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complexes that are able to significantly block undesirable electron transfer from TiO2 to the [Co(bpy)3]3+ species, the result being a very effective suppression of electron loss via recombination and thus an upward shift of the QFLOC. The significant upward shift of the QFLOC causes the greater enhancement of VOC due to TBP in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs.
 Fig. 7  The interactions of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ species near the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs under short-circuit conditions (a) with no TBP addition and (b) with TBP addition; and under open-circuit conditions (c) with no TBP addition and (b) with TBP addition. The interaction between free TBP molecules and [Co(bpy)3]3+ species is illustrated. Note: ‘e’ denotes an electron. 
The TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complex is the reason for the substantial upward shift of the QFLOC associated with the addition of TBP in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs. The result, a remarkable increase of VOC without a further detrimental effect to the JSC, thereby mitigates the JSC–VOC trade-off. Such a phenomenon is also observed in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based DSCs with pyridine as the additive. A relatively significant increase in the VOC of about 16% was obtained. This increase was accompanied by an 11% decrease of JSC. Meanwhile, in the I−/I3−-based DSCs with pyridine, a 19% decrease in JSC was observed without any significant increase in VOC. An interaction between [Co(bpy)3]3+ species and pyridine molecules was also revealed by FTIR. Our findings have therefore shown that the interaction between positively charged [Co(bpy)3]3+ species and a PDA (e.g., TBP or pyridine) to form a PDA-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complex, which can effectively reduce the recombination problems in cobalt-based DSCs. As a result, the upward shift in TiO2-QFL under open-circuit conditions can be larger than the shift under short-circuit conditions. Therefore, it leads us to a new strategy to solve the JSC–VOC trade-off for the development of high performance DSCs.
Conclusions
The molecular interactions between TBP and [Co(bpy)3]3+ species have been discovered to be crucial for the VOC enhancement in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox systems. The interactions between the free, un-adsorbed TBP and [Co(bpy)3]3+ species via weak ion–dipole attractions lead to the formation of a larger structure referred to as a TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complex. TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3]3+ complexes reduce the charge recombination loss from TiO2 into [Co(bpy)3]3+ species and thereby cause a significant upward shift of the QFLOC compared to the EC and QFLSC. Such a phenomenon is not observed in I−/I3−-based DSCs. The discovery of the TBP-shielded [Co(bpy)3f]3+ complex to suppress charge recombination paves a new way to solve the JSC–VOC trade-off problem and improve the performance of DSCs. The molecular interactions between additive compounds and redox species discovered in this study should encourage the search for new additives or redox mediators to achieve high performance DSCs suitable for commercialization.
