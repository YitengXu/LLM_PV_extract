    , Accepted 15th April 2021First published on 11th May 2021AbstractThe role of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP-H) as an additive on the ionic conductivity of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based gel polymer electrolytes (GPE) was studied for DSSC applications. The pure PEO/PC/KI/TPAI/I2 GPE was prepared with a mixture of propylene carbonate (PC) as a non-volatile plasticizer and iodide salts, such as potassium iodide (KI), tetrapropylammonium iodide (TPAI) and iodine (I2), together with PEO. The modified GPEs were prepared with different weight percentage (wt%) ratios (0.5%, 0.75%, 1% and 1.25%) of DPP-H using acetonitrile as a solvent. The polymer gel electrolytes were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and the electrochemical properties were analyzed to relate the nature of the polymer and iodine ion conducting properties. The pure PEO/PC/TPAI/KI/I2 electrolyte exhibited an ionic conductivity value of 0.084 mS·cm−1 at room temperature. Upon the optimized addition of DPP-H (0.75 wt%), the ionic conductivity was found to be improved to a maximum value of 0.393 mS·cm−1, and the highest diffusion coefficient of 1.02 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 was observed. The optimized GPEs photovoltaic characterization studies showed higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.69% for DSSC under light illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The same was compared with pure electrolyte, which delivered PCE of 4.39%. To gain an in-depth understanding of the interfacial resistance of the fabricated devices, the electron lifetime and transient photo response was analyzed. These above studies showed that prepared GPE could be an efficient alternative for traditional DSSCs with liquid electrolyte.
1. Introduction
Next-generation hybrid solar cells are promising photovoltaic devices, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), due to their low cost, facile fabrication processes and environmental affability.1 DSSCs are constructed using a photo-anode (dye-sensitized nano-structured TiO2), a counter electrode (usually Pt) and redox electrolyte I−/I3− as an electrolyte sandwiched between the electrodes. As an important component of DSSC, the electrolyte is involved in the charge transfer and dye regeneration process. Hence, it has great influence on the overall power conversion efficiency.2 However, the volatility and leakage of liquid electrolyte hampered their outdoor commercial applications.3–6
In this regard, many efforts have been made to replace the liquid electrolytes with gel7 solid-state materials.8 Gel electrolytes are generally made up of polymers due to their high thermal and physical stability, and good conductivity. Polyethylene oxide (PEO), a high molecular weight polymer, i.e., up to 20000 g mol−1, is a polyether compound having a very low toxicity. The repeating unit of PEO, ethylene oxide has high donor atoms and PEO itself holds high chain flexibility, which helps for charge transport. PEO exhibits a semi-crystalline nature, consisting of both crystalline and amorphous phases, but the crystalline side of the polymer hinders the chain dynamics. The activated chain segments of the amorphous phase help in ionic transportation. The GPE with PEO, having ether and oxygen atoms, supports both hopping and diffusion mechanism with cation and anion transport, respectively. Through the presence of both mechanisms, the ionic salt interaction with the polymer chain alters its nature to an amorphous one, which is favorable for conductivity enhancement.9 Furthermore, PEO can be used as an interpenetrating phase polymer, where its interactions with other polymers or ionic salts undergo changes in its chain linearity. So, the design and addition of an additive must be such that it expedites the chain segmentation by making it more of an ion transporter. By controlling the chain length of PEO segments, the steric hindrance of the PEO segment is tuned to make it more amorphous.10 Different additives suppress the crystallinity structure by making PEO more amorphous and facilitating its segmental motion.11 In the salt selection, the lattice energy of the salt must be low so that there is an easy disassociation of the salt. Small cations, like Li+ as reported12,13 from lithium salt, can be engrossed to the surface of the photoanode better. However, the large cation tetrabutyl ammonium salt can penetrate electrons very fast and produce high short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), which ultimately lead to high power conversion efficiency (PCE).14 The addition of the organic plasticizer propylene carbonate (PC)15 to gel enhances the flexibility by infiltrating between the main chains of the polymers, which decreases the crystallinity of the polymer. This makes it more amorphous, which enhances its ionic conduction and increases its mechanical stability.16 Cyclic carbonates have high viscosity and dielectric constant, which gives a pathway for the high ionic permittivity in the electrolyte. Due to their high polarity, they can form a solvent interface with the ammonium salt, resulting in the high conductivity.
In this perspective, various organic additives were implemented in polymer electrolytes to enhance the ionic conductivity, resulting in an increase of the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated cell. Generally, the dye heteroatoms associated with I2 of the electrolyte enhances the iodine concentration on the semiconductor surface, resulting in decreasing cell performance.17 To overcome this, organic additives make way for the dissemination of the electrolyte (I−/I3−).18 Moreover, the incorporation of organic additives decreases the polymer–polymer chain interaction and crystallinity.19,20
Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic additives with an I−/I3− redox electrolytic solution couple plays a great role in the performance of DSSCs.21–23 Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) with enriched heteroatoms have an ion-accessible surface area, tunable geometry, controllable pore structure and surface engineering.24 Furthermore, the DPP core is considered as a potential dopant candidate having a lone pair of electrons in both its nitrogen and oxygen atoms.25 So, it can act as a donor and can form an N–O bond with the oxygen of the ethyl oxide group of the PEO moiety, which helps to improve the ionic transportation in the electrolyte. Furthermore, the thiophene-flanked DPP derivative with additional heteroatoms (i.e., S atoms) in the gel polymer electrolyte could easily form a charge-transfer complex with iodine, and may lead to improve the ionic conductivity with high stability in solar cells, resulting in an improvised PCE.
Keeping in view the above points, in this study, different wt% of DPP-H (a thiophene end-capped DPP derivative)-doped PEO/PC/KI/TPAI/I2 gel electrolytes have been prepared. A plausible mechanism of the incorporation of DPP-H additives in GPE is explained. Confirmation of the amorphous phase was analyzed by XRD. The structural and thermal properties were analyzed by FTIR and TGA. The ionic conductivity and diffusion coefficient of the prepared electrolytes were compared. The dye-sensitized solar cell devices were fabricated with few optimized compositions, and the role of DPP-H on the photovoltaic performances was discussed. The ionic conductivity of the DPP-H doped polymer electrolytes with different compositions was analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electron lifetime was analyzed by the Bode plot.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials and reagent
Polyethylene oxide (PEO), propylene carbonate (PC), acetonitrile (ACN), tetrapropylammonium Iodide (TPAI), potassium iodide (KI), iodine (I2) were purchased from SIGMA. Fluorinated tin oxide (FTO), N719 [di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanate)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II)] dye, and platinum were purchased SIGMA ALDRICH. Ethanol and acetonitrile were purchased from Himedia. All chemicals were used without any purification. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP-H) was synthesized as per reported procedure.26,27
2.2. Preparation of DPP-H-modified gel polymer electrolyte
Initially, DPP-H (wt% concerning PEO, 0.5 wt%, 0.75 wt%, 1 wt% and 1.25 wt%) was dispersed in acetonitrile (5 mL). Then, PEO (250 mg), propylene carbonate (500 mg), TPAI (80 mg), KI (40 mg), and I2 (20 mg) were stirred continuously at 85 °C in a glass bottle, while keeping the lid closed. After achieving complete homogeneity, the lid was opened and the solvent was evaporated to obtain the gel polymer electrolyte. Finally, the bottles were stored for further use. The electrolytes were named as PD-0, PD-0.5, PD-0.75, PD-1 and PD-1.25, where the number indicates the weight percentage of DPP-H used in the electrolyte.
2.3. Electrode preparation and DSSCs fabrication
The TiO2-based photoanodes were prepared via screen printing technique, as reported earlier.28,29 In brief, the TiO2 slurry was prepared and screen printed for 8–10 layers over the pre-cleaned FTO surface (5 mm × 5 mm). The TiO2-printed electrodes were annealed at 450 °C for 2 hours at temperature ramp of 5 °C s−1 in air atmosphere. Finally, the annealed samples were dipped in dye solution containing 5 mM N719 dye dissolved in ethanol to obtain the photoanodes. Platinum-based counter electrodes were also prepared as reported.30–32 The DSSCs were fabricated with electrodes placed face-to-face with surlyn used as a spacer. Before sealing the electrode, the prepared gel polymer electrolyte was filled in between the spacer. The formulas used for calculation of the fill factor and PCE are shown below. (1) (2)
3. Results and discussion
3.1. DPP-H as an organic additive in gel polymer electrolytes and its plausible DSSC mechanism
The prepared pure and DPP-H-doped (with different wt%) gel electrolytes are depicted in Fig. 1(a), and the plausible DSSC mechanism, and DPP-H ionic interaction with the gel polymer electrolyte are shown in Fig. 1(b).
 Fig. 1  (a) The photographs of the pure and DPP-H-doped gel polymer electrolytes. (b) Plausible DSSC mechanism by incorporation of DPP-H in the electrolyte blend. 
The polymer gel electrolyte was optimized by adjusting the mass ratio of PEO/PC and the concentration of TPAI, KI and I2. The electron transfer mechanism taking place by addition of DPP-H in PEO/PC/TPAI/KI/I2 could be explained as follows. The externally reduced I− ions from the counter electrode migrate in the polymer electrolyte by ionic hopping movement in the polymer chains. The addition of DPP-H molecules, which contain end thiophene moieties and nitrogen/oxygen atoms, eases the ionic hopping in the polymer electrolyte chains, further helping the iodine sublimation, which follows the mentioned reactions (3) and (4).21 DPP-H + I3− ↔ (DPP-H)I2 + I−(3) 2(DPP-H) + I3− ↔ (DPP-H)2I + 2I−(4)
The incorporation of DPP-H in the polymer electrolyte tends to have a few advantages, like the reduction in the nature of the polymer electrolyte, and increases in the ionic conductivity and diffusion coefficient. All of these combined effects result in obtaining a higher short circuit current density, finally leading to enhanced efficiency of DSSCs. All of these studies were carried out, and are explained in the respective upcoming sections.
3.2. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectral analysis
The XRD patterns were obtained to analyze the nature of the prepared GPEs, and the XRD patterns of the prepared gel polymer electrolytes are depicted in Fig. 2(a). The PEO with PC and iodide salts (PD-0) showed a diffraction peak in a 2 theta range of 23.34°, where the peak appearance was due to the crystalline nature of the electrolyte. Furthermore, upon DPP-H addition to the electrolyte, the original diffraction peak was found to be broadened and reduced, which signified a change in the nature of the polymer from crystalline to amorphous. The change in nature of the GPEs was due to the complete dissolution of DPP-H into the polymer chains. The results inferred with the addition of DPP-H with various weight percentage ranging from 0.5 to 1.25 weight%, exhibited the reduction in crystallinity. The % crystallinity of the electrolyte was found to be 42, 26, 19, 29 and 31% for PD-0, PD-0.5, PD-0.75, PD-1 and PD-1.25, respectively. The decrease in the crystallinity has an outcome of ionic mobility and room temperature ionic conductivity of the gel polymer electrolyte.
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns of the prepared GPEs in a 2 theta range of 2–80°. (b) FTIR spectra of PEO/PC and the gel polymer electrolytes obtained in the wavelength range of 400–4000 cm−1. 
The FTIR spectra of PEO/PC, PD-0, PD-0.75, and PD-1.25 are shown in Fig. 2(b). As seen in the figure, the broad bands appearing at 2880 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibrational mode of the methylene group of the PEO polymer. The band with the characteristic frequency at 1612 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching of the C–O group of the PEO polymer complex.19 The bands appearing at the range of 1180 cm−1 in all GPEs are assigned to the CC stretch of PEO and PC. All of the curves showing an absorption at the range of 1790 cm−1 and 1050 cm−1 confirmed that the CO and C–O–C groups clarified the PC domination in GPEs with more intensified and broadened peaks as a result of proper salt interaction in PD-1.25, PD-0.75, and PD-0. The vibrational bands at 1350 cm−1 and 780 cm−1 show the wagging mode of –CH2 with the salt interaction. Due to salt segregation, there is an absorbance at 765 cm−1 in GPEs. With iodine cation salt interaction, there is intensification of the peak, alternation and shifting at 1132 cm−1, 1050 cm−1 and 932 cm−1. When the polymer interacts with the metal cations, it reduces the electrostatic force of attraction among the positive ion and negative ion of iodide salts. Therefore, more mobile ions are produced by the disassociation of salt. Thus, the chain flexibility increases by reducing the crystallinity of the polymer. The band at 1475 cm−1 is in PD-0, which is intensified in PD-0.75 and PD-1.25 for the strong C–N group due to the addition of the organic compound. By addition of the organic compound and the redox couple (KI & I2) to the PEO, the vibrational bands and positions are changed and intensified.20 The asymmetric bending vibration at 2980 cm−1 in PD-0 is shifted to 2995 cm−1 and 2990 cm−1 in PD-1.25 and PD-0.75, respectively. Both intensified and strong vibrational peaks corresponding to N–H stretching confirm the presence of the DPP-H organic additive in both characterized GPEs. In PD-1.25, PD-0.75 and PD-0, absorption peaks at 3532 cm−1, 3546 cm−1 and 3556 cm−1 can be seen, which illustrate the presence of moisture because of the hydrophilic nature of PEO.33,34 Thus, the FT-IR studies clearly signify that peak broadening and shifting are evidence of the complexation of the organic molecule and salt with the gel polymer electrolyte.
3.3. Thermogravimetric analysis
For the effectual effect of GPEs, they need to uphold the high ionic conductivity over a wide range of temperatures, and should remain structurally stable during the fabrication and storage of DSSCs. Fig. 3 shows the TGA curves of PD-0 and PD-0.75. Both curves have major weight losses of 47%, which are at 159 °C and 184 °C for PD-0 and PD-0.75 electrolytes, respectively, due to the decomposition of the PEO and PC polymers. The initial weight loss of 5% at 76 °C and 84 °C for PD-0 and PD-0.75 show the irreversible decomposition of the polymers and evaporation of the solvent, respectively. It shows that after adding the additive, the weight loss transition region shifted to a higher temperature. This makes PD-0.75 more thermally stable than PD-0, which settles at 333 °C and 350 °C for PD-0 and PD-0.75, respectively, for 70% weight loss. That indicates that the DPP-H molecules are interacting with the components of PEO and PC, which led to mutual stabilization.35 The results indicate that both gel polymer electrolytes can sustain up to 400 °C, but confirm that PD-0.75 is thermally more stable than PD-0.

3.4. Electrochemical properties of the prepared GPEs
Impedance analysis was carried out at room temperature to study the ionic conductivity of the prepared GPEs by symmetric cell assembly (FTO/Pt/GPE/Pt/FTO). The frequency of 1 MHz to 1 mHz at a potential of 10 mV was applied to the assembly. The output is bulk resistance obtained from the Nyquist plot shown in Fig. 4(a) with the equivalent circuit shown in the inset. The bulk resistance of the gel polymer electrolyte was found to be decreased upon addition of the DPP-H to GPEs, and the order of the bulk resistance values was PD-0.75 < PD-1 < PD-0.5 < PD-0 < PD-1.25. The change in the bulk resistance can be related to the change in the nature of the polymer to amorphous, and clearly supports the obtained crystallinity values shown in section 3.2. Bulk resistance is an important parameter to calculate the ionic conductivity of the prepared GPEs. Based on the below mentioned eqn (3), the ionic conductivity was calculated: (5)where Rb is the bulk resistance, A is the active area (0.25 cm2), and t is the spacer thickness. A clear comparison of the ionic conductivity of the gel polymer electrolyte with varying the addition of the DPP-H is shown in Fig. 4(b). The plot shows the influence of the addition of DPP-H on the ionic conductivity of GPEs. The pure electrolyte exhibited an ionic conductivity of 0.084 mS cm−1, and the ionic conductivity increased to 0.393 mS cm−1 with 0.75 wt% DPP-H into GPEs. Again, with further addition of DPP-H over 1 wt%, the ionic conductivity was found to be reduced, which may be due to the hindrance that appeared by the dissociation of additives in the polymer electrolyte. The ionic conductivity values of various prepared GPEs are shown in Table 1. The higher ionic conductivity of the electrolyte resulted in enhanced photovoltaic property during the assembling of DSSCs.

Furthermore, the same assembly used in impedance analysis was used to carry out voltammetric analysis in a potential window of −1 to 1 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, and the plot is shown in Fig. 4(c). As seen from the voltammetric plot of various DPP-H-doped GPEs, PD-0.75 had the highest limiting current density of 6.6 mA cm−2. The other GPEs, such as PD-0.5, PD-1 and PD-1.25, exhibited limiting current densities of 2.90, 4.25, and 2.80 mA cm−2, respectively. The obtained limiting current values are in good agreement with the resistance values, where the lower resistance displayed higher limiting current density values. From the obtained limiting current density values, the diffusion coefficient of the GPEs can be calculated by eqn (4) shown below: (6)where Jlim is the limiting current density, d is the cell gap, n is the number of electrons, F is the Faraday constant, and C is the initial I2 concentration. As per the obtained limiting current density, the diffusion coefficient was calculated and the value for the PD-0.75-based GPE was as high as 1.02 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, whereas PD-1 exhibited a diffusion coefficient value that was close to that of PD-0.75, and the calculated diffusion coefficient values are listed in Table 1.
From the above electrochemical property, it is clear that the PD-0.75 having higher ionic conductivity and diffusion coefficient was optimal. The higher electrochemical property was due to the reduction in the crystallinity, which changed the chain orientation in the polymer. These changes in the chain orientation helped in the quick ionic transportation in GPEs. The DPP-H incorporation in GPE decreases the I3− ion concentration and increases the I− ion concentration, paving the way to ionic conductivity enhancement. Furthermore, these enhanced ionic transportations helped in increasing the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated DSSCs. Hence, the optimized GPE of PD-0.75 was used in the fabrication of DSSCs, and the same was compared with PD-0. Also, another composition, i.e., is PD-1, which exhibited electrochemical properties close enough to PD-0.75 that it was used in the fabrication of DSSCs, and a comparison was done between pure, PD-0.75 and PD-1.
3.5. Photovoltaic performance of fabricated DSSCs
The performance evaluation of the fabricated DSSCs with gel polymer electrolytes with higher ionic conductivity was compared with the pure electrolyte, which was carried out under the light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). The photovoltaic plot is depicted in Fig. 5(a), and the inset values are the performance of the fabricated DSSCs. From the obtained parameters, it is clear that DSSCs with electrolyte PD-0 exhibited Jsc (mA cm−2), Voc (V), fill factor and efficiency (%) of 10 mA cm−2, 0.72 V, 0.61 and 4.39%, respectively. In contrast, PD-1 delivered photovoltaic parameters of 10.5 mA cm−2, 0.72 V, 0.65 and 4.91%, and the PD-0.75 gel polymer electrolyte fabricated DSSCs delivered the highest performance of 13.5 mA cm−2, 0.74 V, 0.67 and 6.69%. The obtained photovoltaic performance results confirmed that the influence of DPP-H in the gel polymer electrolyte was due to a reduction in the crystallinity, which paved a path to obtain higher conductivity through better ion diffusivity, which led to faster ionic transfer in the electrolyte. The faster ionic transfer was due to the optimum dissolution of the additives in the polymer chains, where the electrons hop in the entangled chains of the polymer electrolyte. Also, the optimum addition of the additive had an enhanced penetration of the polymer electrolyte into the TiO2 electrode, where it reduces the interfacial contact and exhibits improvement in the photovoltaic properties of the fabricated DSSCs. Based on the additive incorporation, a literature survey was done with similar structured additives in the polymer electrolyte. The photovoltaic performance comparison with previously reported similar devices is shown in Table 2, and it shows that the electron-rich donors (N, S and O) in the organic additive (i.e., DPP-H) with the PEO/PC gel polymer electrolyte improves the PCE up to 6.69%.

The fabricated DSSCs were subjected to investigate its interfacial charge transfer occurring at different interfaces. Fig. 5(b) is the Nyquist plot-obtained impedance analysis of the fabricated DSSCs. The technique parameters applied was the same as that for the symmetrical cells. The only change was that a bias potential of 0.7 V was applied to the cell, considering it as the working potential of the fabricated DSSCs. All of the fabricated DSSCs exhibit similar resistance curves, i.e., series resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), and Nernst diffusion (Rw). The series resistance (Rs) can be related to the resistance occurring by connections and FTO resistance. The observed semicircle is the charge transfer resistance. Here in our study, a single semicircle is observed, which can be included to the whole interfaces, such as the counter electrode/electrolyte/dye/TiO2 interfaces. The possibility of the single semicircle may be due to the continuous ionic hopping through the interfaces. The observed arc is the Nernst diffusion, where the ions diffuse into the TiO2 layers. The fitting circuit validated with Zsim software is shown in the inset of the Nyquist plot. From the Nyquist plot, the electron transfer process can be understood, and it is clear that the reduction in the charge recombination resulted from the addition of additives in the gel polymer electrolyte. This can be observed in the reduction of the diameter of the semicircle occurring at the interfaces with the ease of the ionic hopping movement in the circuit, which was obtained by the addition of 0.75 wt% DPP. Similarly, there was also a reduction in the Nernst diffusion occurring at the ionic diffusion at the TiO2 layers. The diameter of other EIS spectra, i.e., PD-0 and PD-1, was larger, which was due to the hindrance appearing at the interface. This favorable resistance factor of PD-0.75 exhibited enhancement in the photovoltaic property of the DSSCs. Furthermore, the electron relaxation lifetime was studied to know the kinetic process appearing in the DSSCs circuit. Usually, the values are obtained from the Bode plot, which is derived from the impedance analysis. The derived Bode plot is shown in Fig. 5(c), and there was a clear peak shift towards lower frequency, signifying the higher electron relaxation lifetime39 and longer electron lifetime decrease back reaction of TiO2/I3−, which led to the overall enhancement in the DSSCs efficiency. The electron relaxation time (τ) was calculated using the equation τ = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency. The study stated that the PD-0.75 GPE-based DSSCs showed an electron relaxation lifetime of 0.854 milliseconds, whereas PD-0 and PD-1 delivered a relaxation lifetime of 0.763 and 0.665 milliseconds, respectively. The higher relaxation lifetime achieved from PD-0.75 GPE was due to the faster diffusion and higher ionic conductivity, with a slower electron charge recombination.40 Furthermore, the obtained higher electron lifetime results are in good agreement with the electrochemical and photovoltaic performances of the fabricated DSSCs. Finally, the photo-response studies of the PD-0.75 GPE-based DSSCs were carried out for 600 s with multiple light ON and OFF illuminations. The obtained j–T plot is shown in Fig. 5(d), and suggested stable current generation with a similar pattern throughout the cycles, where it signifies the charge carrier recombination from the surface state. Moreover, the quick electron injection from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2 led to a sharp rise in the photo-response of the fabricated DSSCs.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the positive influence of DPP-H as an additive on the PEO-based gel polymer electrolytes were profoundly studied. Fourier transform infrared analysis indicates that the incorporated DPP-H had good interactions with the polymer and added iodine salts, and XRD studies clearly suggested that the optimized addition of DPP-H led to a clear reduction of crystallinity. The optimized addition of DPP-H, i.e., PD-0.75-based GPE exhibited an ionic conductivity of 0.393 mS cm−1 and diffusion coefficient of 1.02 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. The photovoltaic performance under solar light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 for PD-0.75 GPE-based DSSCs delivered a higher PCE of 6.69%, whereas the pure polymer electrolyte (PD-0)-based DSSCs had a PCE of 4.39% and PD-1 delivered a PCE of 4.91%. All of the fabricated DSSCs were subjected to impedance analysis to obtain the interfacial kinetics and electron relaxation lifetime. Finally, the fabricated PD-0.75-based DSSCs delivered excellent photo-response with multiple ON and OFF light illuminations. This study states that DPP-H could be a potential candidate in developing a gel polymer electrolyte, which could efficiently replace the traditional liquid electrolyte of DSSCs.
