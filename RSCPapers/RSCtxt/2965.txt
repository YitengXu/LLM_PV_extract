    , Accepted 5th August 2021First published on 6th August 2021AbstractThe development of high-capacity and high-power lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is a key challenge to meet the increasing demand for advanced mobile electronics and electric vehicles. A novel high-capacity and high-power Ga2Te3 anode material for LIBs, which exhibits a distinctive reaction mechanism with Li ions, has been introduced in this study. Two types of Ga2Te3/C composite were prepared via different synthetic routes, namely carbon thermal decomposition (TD) and high-energy ball milling (BM), to improve the electrochemical performance of Ga2Te3 anodes, and their electrochemical performances were compared. The electrochemical evaluation results indicate that the Ga2Te3/C composite produced by BM (BM-Ga2Te3/C) showed better electrochemical performance by delivering much smaller Ga2Te3 nanocrystallites than the Ga2Te3/C composite produced by TD (TD-Ga2Te3/C). Furthermore, the BM-Ga2Te3/C anode showed a highly reversible initial volumetric capacity (1245 mA h cm−3), stable capacity retention (93.2% after 500 cycles), and excellent high-rate performance (∼1000 mA h cm−3 at 1C after 500 cycles). These high electrochemical performances, which were demonstrated via ex situ analyses, were attained by a unique three-step nano-confinement process of Ga2Te3 in BM-Ga2Te3/C. Thus, this study provides a new material development strategy of employing mechano- and electro-chemical nano-confinement processes to develop high-performance anodes for LIBs.
Introduction
In recent decades, enormous efforts have been dedicated to developing long-range and sustainable electric vehicle (EV) batteries towards the goal of achieving a negative carbon dioxide emission future.1–3 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been successfully commercialized for EV applications, and their market has been expanding rapidly; however, EV batteries still suffer from certain performance deficiencies that prevent the EVs from being more competitive to combustion engine vehicles.4–7 Graphite, the most widely used anode material for conventional LIBs, has been used as a non-ideal LIB anode for EV batteries because of its low specific capacity (theoretically, 372 mA h g−1 when it forms LiC6) and poor rate capability; therefore, alternative anode materials, such as silicon, tin, phosphorus, and antimony have been intensively investigated to meet the energy and power density requirements of EV batteries.8–12 The major issue with these high-capacity anodes is their excessive volume change caused by repetitive electrochemical Li-alloying/dealloying reactions, which result in a poor cycling stability.
Theoretically, gallium (Ga) is a good high-capacity LIB anode material candidate, as it can alloy with two Li ions per Ga atom (Li2Ga, vs. LiC6 for a graphite anode), resulting in a high theoretical capacity of 769 mA h g−1. Additionally, a Ga anode offers a high theoretical volumetric capacity (4545 mA h cm−3), which is attributed to the high density of Ga (5.91 g cm−3 at ambient temperature).13,14 Therefore, several Ga-based studies have been attempted; however, Ga has a low melting temperature (29.8 °C), and therefore, its tendency to agglomerate owing to the high surface energy caused by the dissolution of liquid Ga during cycling leads to a poor cycling performance.14–20 Tellurium (Te) is another attractive material for LIB anodes, as it can theoretically form a Li-rich binary phase, i.e., Li2Te, which offers a theoretical specific capacity of 420 mA h g−1 and high volumetric capacity of 2621 mA h cm−3 owing to its high density (6.24 g cm−3).21 In addition, because of the relatively good electronic conductivity of Te (2 × 10−4 MS m−1) among the chalcogens (vs. S: 5 × 10−22 MS m−1, Se: 1 × 10−10 MS m−1), Te has been investigated recently as a LIB anode material; however, the capacity fading caused by the volume change of Te particles still needs to be overcome.21–30
Ga and Te appear as various binary compounds, such as GaTe, Ga3Te4, Ga2Te3, and Ga2Te5, which have been studied and utilized in radiation detectors, optoelectronic devices, semiconductors, and solar cells owing to their distinctive structural, electronic, and mechanical properties.31–36 Among the binary compounds, Ga2Te3 is most commonly synthesized by solid-state reactions, and is a stable compound with black, odorless, brittle, and non-toxic characteristics. Furthermore, Ga2Te3 has a high melting temperature of 790 °C; therefore, it can supplement the dissolution and agglomeration of Ga during cycling, when utilized as a LIB anode material.37 Additionally, it has a high density (5.57 cm−3) and can therefore theoretically provide a high volumetric capacity anode (2858 mA h cm−3) for LIBs.38 Despite its interesting properties, Ga2Te3 has not yet been studied as an anode material for LIBs.
In this work, cubic-structured Ga2Te3 was synthesized using a simple thermal synthesis method and investigated for its performance as a LIB anode. The reaction mechanism of the Ga2Te3 anode with Li ions was intensively investigated using ex situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical methods, including galvanostatic tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Two types of Ga2Te3/C composite were prepared by different synthesis routes, which include (1) a carbon coating process by thermal decomposition (TD) of a carbon precursor and (2) a carbon composite process by high-energy ball milling (BM). These composites demonstrated a significant improvement in the electrochemical performance of Ga2Te3-based anodes for LIBs. Thus, a Ga2Te3/C anode that has not been reported elsewhere, to the best of our knowledge, will open a new possibility to advance the LIB technology towards a greener future.
Experimental
Sample preparation
Ga–Te binary compound (GaTe, Ga3Te4, and Ga2Te3) powders were synthesized using a simple thermal synthesis method. Ga (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9% purity) and Te (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8% purity) powders were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio and pelletized. The prepared pellets were heat-treated at 700 °C in an inert Ar gas atmosphere for 3 h at a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1. Two Ga2Te3/C composites were prepared as follows: (1) a TD-Ga2Te3/C composite with carbon via thermal decomposition (TD) of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The heat-treatment process of the mixture of the synthesized Ga2Te3 and PVC carbon precursor was performed at 700 °C for 3 h (ramping rate: 5 °C min−1) under a high-purity Ar atmosphere. Considering the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results of PVC (Fig. S1†), the carbon content in the TD-Ga2Te3/C composite was 40 wt%. (2) A BM-Ga2Te3/C composite was synthesized via high-energy ball milling (BM), using amorphous carbon (Super-P carbon black) as the carbon matrix. The high-energy BM process was performed for 20 min, and the carbon content in BM-Ga2Te3/C was 40 wt%.
Materials characterisation
The crystal structures of the synthesized Ga2Te3 and Ga2Te3/C composites were observed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Rigaku, D-MAX/2000-PC) and 7D beamline X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS; Pohang Light Source, South Korea). Morphological and elemental analyses were conducted using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM; JEM-ARM200F/JEOL) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM-6500/JEOL), and particle size analysis (PSA; Mastersizer-2000). Various ex situ techniques, including XRD, TEM, SEM, EXAFS, and XANES, were performed to investigate the reaction mechanisms of the Ga2Te3 and Ga2Te3/C anodes. Furthermore, the electrical conductivities of these anodes were investigated using a ZIVE-MP2A (ZIVELAB) impedance analyzer.
Electrochemical measurement
The Ga2Te3 and Ga2Te3/C electrodes were prepared using a conventional tape casting method. Briefly, a slurry (comprising an active material, conductive carbon (Denka), and a binder, such as polyvinyl alcohol–polyacrylic acid (PVA–PAA) in the ratio 8:1:1 w/w) was prepared in a highly purified water solvent, and cast onto a Cu foil current collector. The cast slurry was dried at ambient temperature. Next, the dried electrodes were transferred to a vacuum oven and dried at 120 °C for 3 h to completely remove the water residue. As a control experiment, Ga, Te, and graphite electrodes were also prepared by the same method. After the drying process, the electrodes were cut into discs, with an electrode area of 0.79 cm2 and an average mass loading of the active material of approximately 2.5 mg cm−2. Coin-type cells were fabricated for electrochemical tests using Li metal foil as a counter/reference electrode, an electrolyte composed of 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC, and a porous polypropylene separator (Celgard 2400). The cells were fabricated in an Ar-filled glovebox to minimize residual water in the cells. A galvanostatic cycling test was carried out using a battery cycling tester (Maccor 4000) in the voltage range of 0–2.5 V (vs. Li+/Li) at 100 mA g−1. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was carried out in the voltage range of 0–2.5 V (vs. Li+/Li) at a current density of 100 mA g−1 for 10 min at 1 h rest intervals using a ZIVELAB electrochemical workstation. A full-cell test was conducted under the same conditions as the half-cell test using a LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode and a BM-Ga2Te3/C anode. The LCO cathode was fabricated by dissolving LCO, conductive carbon (Denka), and PVDF in NMP with a ratio of 8:1:1 w/w. The full-cell was designed with a negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 1.1 based on the loading level (cathode: 6.4 mg cm−2 and anode: 1.7 mg cm−2), and cycled within 2.0–4.2 V at 0.1C (1C = 140 mA g−1). The cell was subjected to a pre-formation process before the first cycle to form a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer at 0.05C. The tap density of the electrodes was measured using a tap density tester (BT-301, Bettersize), and the volumetric capacity of the electrodes was estimated using the measured tap density and weight of the electrodes.
Results and discussion
Among the binary compounds of Ga and Te present in the binary phase diagram (Fig. S2†), three compounds, GaTe, Ga3Te4, and Ga2Te3, which are stable at ambient temperature, were synthesized via a heat-treatment process. However, only Ga2Te3 could be successfully synthesized (Fig. S3a–c†), which implies that Ga2Te3 is the most thermodynamically stable phase among the Ga–Te compounds under the synthesis conditions employed in this work. The Rietveld refinement result of the synthesized Ga2Te3 (Fig. 1a) shows that the refined lattice parameter value of the synthesized Ga2Te3 (reliability index, Rwp) of 11.7% matched well with that of the standard cubic Ga2Te3 (space group: F3m; a = 5.89 Å). The Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra of Ga metal (Ga–Ga bonding: 2.38 Å) and the synthesized Ga2Te3 (Ga–Te bonding: 2.45 Å) confirmed the formation of the Ga2Te3 phase as a result of the simple thermal synthesis (Fig. 1b). The average particle size of the synthesized Ga2Te3 was 16.6 μm according to the PSA and SEM results (Fig. S4a and b†).

To investigate the electrochemical behavior of Ga, Te, and the synthesized Ga2Te3 anodes for LIBs, galvanostatic cycling tests were performed, and the obtained voltage profiles are shown in Fig. 1c–e. The Ga anode exhibited an initial lithiation/delithiation capacity of 483/181 mA h g−1 and approximately 38% initial coulombic efficiency (ICE; Fig. 1c). Considering the theoretical capacity of Ga (769 mA h g−1, calculated by the formation of Li2Ga), the initial electrochemical utilization of Ga was approximately 63% (at lithiation) and only 24% (at delithiation) of Li ions at 100 mA g−1, which was mainly caused by the dissolution and agglomeration of Ga during the cycling; this could be attributed to its low melting temperature (29.8 °C).14,15 The Te anode also exhibited a poor lithiation/delithiation capacity of 199/93 mA h g−1 with approximately 47% ICE as against its theoretical capacity (420 mA h g−1, calculated by the formation of Li2Te; Fig. 1d). The poor Te utilization and Li ion reversibility could be attributed to its poor electrical conductivity and large volume change that degraded the electronic conduction path of the Te electrode during lithiation/delithiation.21–24 In contrast, the Ga2Te3 anode exhibited a significantly improved initial lithiation/delithiation capacity of 626/470 mA h g−1 with an approximately 75% ICE (Fig. 1e). Considering the capacity contribution of the SEI layer formation (approximately 100 mA h g−1), it can be inferred that Ga and Te in Ga2Te3 were fully utilized (an obtained specific capacity of 526 mA h g−1vs. a theoretical capacity of 513.2 mA h g−1, calculated based on the formation of Li2Ga and Li2Te), and achieved a high volumetric lithiation/delithiation capacity of 1959/1471 mA h cm−3, owing to the high tap density (3.13 g cm−3) of the Ga2Te3 electrode. However, the capacity of the Ga2Te3 electrode decayed rapidly in the following cycles (Fig. 1f) because of the volume change of Ga2Te3, which degraded the electronic conduction path of the Ga2Te3 electrode.

Ex situ XRD (Fig. 2b), EXAFS (Fig. 2c and e), XANES (Fig. S6a and b†), and derivative XANES (Fig. 2d and f) analyses of the Ga2Te3 anodes were performed to investigate their reaction mechanism with Li. The Ga2Te3 anodes were electrochemically lithiated and delithiated to the selected potentials shown in the differential capacity plot (DCP, Fig. 2a), and collected for the ex situ analyses. The Ga2Te3 anode showed one small peak at approximately 1.27 V and two large peaks at approximately 1.1 and 0.1 V during the first lithiation process; in addition, it showed two broad peaks between 0 and 0.9 V, and a large peak at approximately 1.54 V during the first delithiation process, which was in good agreement with the cyclic voltammetry (CV) result (Fig. S5†). According to the analyses (t1 in Fig. 2b–d), the small peak at 1.27 V was not associated with the reaction of Ga2Te3 with the Li ions, but rather related to side reactions, such as SEI formation. At 0.8 V (t2 in Fig. 2a), Ga2Te3 decomposed to Ga and Te, and the decomposed Te reacted with Li to form Li2Te. Even though no XRD peaks associated with Ga were found owing to extreme nanocrystallization or amorphization by electrochemical reaction (t2 in Fig. 2b), the existence of Ga was certainly proved by the Ga K-edge EXAFS (Ga–Ga bond: 2.38 Å; t2 in Fig. 2c) and derivative XANES (derivative absorption edge energy: 10368 eV; t2 in Fig. 2d) results. Next, the decomposed Ga was further lithiated and converted to Li2Ga at 0 V, which was also proved by the Ga K-edge EXAFS (Li–Ga bond: 2.31 Å; t3 in Fig. 2c) and derivative XANES (derivative absorption edge energy: 10371 eV; t3 in Fig. 2d) results. Meanwhile, during the initial delithiation process, Li2Ga was first transformed back to Ga at 0.9 V (Ga–Ga bond: 2.38 Å; t4 in Fig. 2e, derivative absorption edge energy: 10368 eV; t4 in Fig. 2f), and Li2Te was not delithiated (t4 in Fig. 2b). At the end of delithiation at 2.5 V, the Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra (Ga–Te bond: 2.45 Å; t5 in Fig. 2e) and derivative XANES (derivative absorption edge energy: 10374 eV; t5 in Fig. 2f) demonstrated that Ga and Te were recombined into a Ga2Te3 phase; however, interestingly, no XRD peak associated with the Ga2Te3 phase was observed (t5 in Fig. 2b), indicating that the recombined Ga2Te3 phase had short-range atomic order similar to extremely small nano-crystalline or amorphous materials. Based on the ex situ analysis results, the two-step conversion/recombination mechanism of the Ga2Te3 anode with the Li ions was suggested, which is as follows:

(b) Ex situ XRD patterns of the Ga2Te3 anode during the initial lithiation/delithiation. (c) EXAFS and (d) derivative XANES spectra of the Ga2Te3 anode during the first lithiation.

During lithiation:Ga2Te3 → Ga + Li2Te → Li2Ga + Li2Te
During delithiation:Li2Ga + Li2Te → Ga + Li2Te → Ga2Te3
The conversion/recombination two-step mechanism of the Ga2Te3 anode during lithiation/delithiation is also crystallographically illustrated in Fig. 2g. The cubic Ga2Te3 was converted into orthorhombic Ga and cubic Li2Te phases; next, the orthorhombic Ga alloyed with Li to form an orthorhombic Li2Ga phase. Subsequently, during delithiation, the orthorhombic Li2Ga dealloyed into Ga, the cubic Li2Te dealloyed into Te, and finally, Ga and Te recombined into the original cubic Ga2Te3 phase.

Ex situ analyses of Ga (Fig. 3a and b, and S7†) and Te (Fig. 3d and e) anodes were performed at the fully lithiated (0 V) and delithiated (2.5 V) states to compare their reaction mechanisms with that of the Ga2Te3 anode, which was discussed above. The same electrochemical reaction mechanisms of Ga and Te with Li ions as those of Ga and Te decomposed from Ga2Te3 were confirmed by the ex situ analyses. Specifically, at the fully lithiated state (0 V), the Ga anode was transformed into Li2Ga, which was confirmed by the XRD (JCPDS #83-1228; t1 in Fig. 3b), EXAFS (Li–Ga main bond: 2.31 Å; t1 in Fig. S7a†), and XANES (derivative absorption edge energy: 10371 eV; t1 in Fig. S7b and c†). Subsequently, Li2Ga was recovered to amorphous Ga at a fully delithiated state (2.5 V; t2 in Fig. 3b and S7a–c†). In addition, the reaction mechanism of Te was confirmed through ex situ XRD at the selected points, indicated in the voltage profile (Fig. 3d and e). Te formed the Li2Te phase when fully lithiated (0 V) and returned to its initial state when completely delithiated (2.5 V). Therefore, Ga and Te had the following lithiation/delithiation mechanisms, which are also crystallographically depicted in Fig. 3c and f, respectively.Ga → Li2Ga (in the fully lithiated state at 0 V) → Ga (amorphous, in the fully delithiated state at 2.5 V)Te → Li2Te (in the fully lithiated state at 0 V) → Te (in the fully delithiated state at 2.5 V)

Despite the distinctive reaction mechanism of Ga2Te3 for LIBs, substantial improvement in its capacity retention is necessary (Fig. 1f), which can be addressed by overcoming two major issues of the Ga2Te3 anode, namely, the mechanical degradation caused by the volume expansion of Te, and agglomeration and dissolution of the decomposed Ga during cycling. SEM and photographic images of the Ga electrode before the cycling (Fig. 4a) and of the Ga electrode and separator after 10 cycles of the LIBs (Fig. 4b) show agglomeration of Ga on the top surface of the Ga electrode and separator after 10 cycles. Severe agglomeration of Ga up to approximately 60 μm would slow down the electrochemical process of the Ga anode, resulting in a rapid capacity decay. Notably, the Ga agglomeration was significantly mitigated in the Ga2Te3 anode (Fig. 4c and d), compared to that of the pure Ga anode, even though the crack propagation (Fig. 4d) owing to the volume change of Ga and Te during the cycling still led to a capacity degradation of the Ga2Te3 anode. Therefore, the mechanical degradation issue of the Ga2Te3 anode needs to be further addressed to improve its cyclability for LIBs.

A nanostructured Ga2Te3/C composite consisting of homogeneously confined nano-Ga2Te3 crystallites in an electronically conductive carbon matrix offers an ideal design for a high-performance LIB anode because the carbon matrix not only improves the electronic conductivity of the Ga2Te3 anode, but also mitigates the mechanical strain of the electrode caused by the volume changes of Ga2Te3 during the battery operation.9,12,39,40 In addition, the carbon matrix encapsulating the nano-confined Ga2Te3 can secure the decomposed Ga from Ga2Te3 during lithiation/delithiation, and prevent the agglomeration of the Ga particles. A key material design strategy would be to homogeneously distribute and embed the nano-confined Ga2Te3 particles within the electronically conductive carbon matrix so that faster electronic and ionic conduction, improved mechanical stability, and better security against the loss of melted Ga can be achieved. Therefore, to improve the electrochemical performance of Ga2Te3, two types of Ga2Te3/C composite, namely TD-Ga2Te3/C and BM-Ga2Te3/C, were prepared by two different nano-confinement routes, shown in Fig. 5a. According to the SEM images (Fig. S8a and S9a†) and PSA results (Fig. S8b and S9b†), a smaller particle size of Ga2Te3 was obtained via the BM method (average particle size: 4.86 μm) compared to that of the TD-Ga2Te3/C composite (average particle size: 19.9 μm). The difference in the crystallite size of Ga2Te3, as calculated by the Scherrer equation using the XRD data (Fig. 5b and c), was more significant. The crystallite size of BM-Ga2Te3/C was only 6.87 nm, while that of TD-Ga2Te3/C was 36.76 nm (Fig. S10a and b†). These results emphasize the effectiveness of the BM process, as it could reduce the crystallite size of Ga2Te3 by 80% relative to that of TD-Ga2Te3/C in only 20 min. Furthermore, the Ga-K edge EXAFS, XANES, and derivative XANES results for the TD-Ga2Te3/C and BM-Ga2Te3/C composites (Fig. 5d and e, and S11†) show that the Ga2Te3 phase was well preserved in the TD-Ga2Te3/C and BM-Ga2Te3/C composites.

(g) DGITTvs. capacity plots of Ga2Te3, TD-Ga2Te3/C, and BM-Ga2Te3/C composite anodes for LIBs. 
EIS was performed to compare the electrochemical resistances of the Ga2Te3, TD-Ga2Te3/C, and BM-Ga2Te3/C composite anodes. From the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 5f, it is very evident that the BM-Ga2Te3/C composite anode exhibited the lowest charge transfer resistance (36.1 Ω, represented by the semicircle at the high and middle frequencies) among the three electrodes (Ga2Te3: 90.3 Ω and TD-Ga2Te3/C: 53.7 Ω); this could be attributed to the nano-confinement effect of Ga2Te3, resulting from the BM process. In addition, to further investigate the reaction kinetics, the GITT measurement was carried out and the GITT curves of Ga2Te3, TD-Ga2Te3/C, and BM-Ga2Te3/C after the second cycle between 0 and 2.5 V at 100 mA g−1 and the corresponding Li ion diffusion coefficients are shown in Fig. S12† and 5g.41–46 The Li ion diffusion coefficient of BM-Ga2Te3/C (1.10 × 10−9 cm2 S−1) is approximately two and ten times higher than that of TD-Ga2Te3/C (4.88 × 10−10 cm2 S−1) and Ga2Te3 (1.22 × 10−10 cm2 S−1), respectively, suggesting that BM-Ga2Te3/C has much better electrochemical kinetics.
Bright-field, high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and EDS elemental maps of the TD-Ga2Te3/C and BM-Ga2Te3/C composites are compared in Fig. 6. As shown in the HR-TEM images and SAED patterns, the TD-Ga2Te3/C had tens of nanometer-sized Ga2Te3 crystallites embedded in an amorphous carbon matrix (Fig. 6b), while the BM-Ga2Te3/C nanocomposite contained Ga2Te3 nanocrystallites that were approximately 6–8 nm (Fig. 6e). These results agreed with the calculations of the Scherrer equation. The EDS mapping results, shown in Fig. 6c and f, demonstrate that the Ga2Te3 crystallites were homogeneously distributed in both the TD-Ga2Te3/C and BM-Ga2Te3/C composites; however, the BM-Ga2Te3/C composite showed a more nano-confined and homogeneous elemental distribution than the TD-Ga2Te3/C composite. The TEM analyses also confirmed that the high-energy BM produced smaller and more homogeneously dispersed, and confined Ga2Te3 nanocrystallites in the amorphous carbon matrix than the TD process.

The voltage profiles of the composites of TD-Ga2Te3/C and BM-Ga2Te3/C, obtained by the galvanostatic cycling tests, are compared in Fig. 7a and b. The TD-Ga2Te3/C anode exhibited initial lithiation/delithiation capacities of 685/511 mA h g−1 and 1260/940 mA h cm−3; however, the reversible capacity rapidly decreased to 291 mA h g−1 and 535 mA h cm−3 after 100 cycles. In contrast, the BM-Ga2Te3/C anode demonstrated higher initial lithiation/delithiation capacities of 840/616 mA h g−1 and 1697/1245 mA h cm−3, and showed almost identical voltage curves with respect to that of the initial cycle even after 500 cycles, thus demonstrating its excellent long-term electrochemical stability. The comparisons of DCPs (Fig. S13a and b†) and CVs (Fig. S14a and b†) of the TD-Ga2Te3/C and BM-Ga2Te3/C anodes demonstrated similar electrochemical behavior as the Ga2Te3 anode; however, the BM-Ga2Te3/C anode showed a lower overpotential than the other two electrodes. According to the galvanostatic voltage profile and cycling test results of the amorphous carbon anodes produced by the TD (Fig. S15a and b†) and BM (Fig. S16a and b†), the reversible capacity contributions of the carbon matrix (40 wt% composition) to the TD-Ga2Te3/C and BM-Ga2Te3/C anodes were approximately 31% and 39%, respectively. Considering the capacity contributions of the amorphous carbon and irreversible SEI formation, Ga2Te3 in both the composites exhibited almost fully reversible reactions with the Li ions.

(f) Summary of electrochemical performance (initial reversible capacity vs. cycle number) of various Ga-based anodes for LIBs. 
The rate capability and galvanostatic cycling test results of the Ga2Te3, TD-Ga2Te3/C, BM-Ga2Te3/C, and conventional graphite anodes are compared in Fig. 7c–e. Remarkably, the BM-Ga2Te3/C anode exhibited much higher capacities than did the Ga2Te3, TD-Ga2Te3/C, and conventional graphite anodes (Fig. 7d). While the specific capacity of the Ga2Te3 anode decayed rapidly during the first 50 cycles owing to the electrode degradation caused by the large volume expansion of the Ga2Te3 anode, the cycling behavior of the TD-Ga2Te3/C anode was slightly enhanced compared to that of the Ga2Te3 anode; however, its performance was still not satisfactory. In contrast, the BM-Ga2Te3/C anode showed a dramatic improvement in the cell performance of the Ga2Te3 anode, and demonstrated excellent capacity retentions of approximately 93.2% (Q500th/Q1st for delithiation) after 500 cycles. The BM-Ga2Te3/C anode exhibited a very promising volumetric capacity (1160 mA h cm−3 at the 500th cycle, Fig. 7d), which was approximately 2.8 times higher than that of the graphite anode (408 mA h cm−3 at the 300th cycle) during the galvanostatic cycling test. In addition, approximately three times higher volumetric capacities were obtained for the BM-Ga2Te3/C anode compared to the graphite anode in all the C-rate tests from 0.1C to 5C during the rate capability tests (Fig. 7c and e), thus indicating its excellent rate performance. In addition, the BM-Ga2Te3/C anode demonstrated an excellent cycling stability at a high 1C rate for 500 cycles with a highly reversible volumetric capacity of approximately 1000 mA h cm−3 (Fig. 7e). Notably, the electrochemical performance of the BM-Ga2Te3/C anode reported here is one of the best among the Ga-based anodes for LIBs, to the best of our knowledge (Fig. 7f and Table S1†).14,47–59
The electrochemical test results clearly demonstrated that the BM-Ga2Te3/C composite dramatically improved the electrochemical performance of Ga2Te3. The nanostructure of the BM-Ga2Te3/C composite consisting of nano-confined Ga2Te3 crystallites embedded in an electrically conductive amorphous carbon matrix resulted in a substantial improvement in the electrochemical reaction kinetics with the Li ions by reducing the charge transfer and mass transfer resistances; this in turn resulted in an excellent high-rate performance of the BM-Ga2Te3/C composite anode. In addition, the BM-Ga2Te3/C anode did not show any crack development and agglomerated Ga after 100 cycles (Fig. 8a and b), indicating that the carbon matrix successfully accommodated the volume changes of the Ga2Te3 particles, and preserved the nano-confined structure of Ga2Te3 during cycling. To further investigate the crystallographic changes in the BM-Ga2Te3/C composite during cycling, ex situ HRTEM analyses were performed (Fig. 8c and d). Interestingly, it was observed that the size of the Ga2Te3 crystallites in the BM-Ga2Te3/C composite (6–8 nm, Fig. 6e) was reduced to 2–3 nm as a result of the electrochemical cycling (Fig. 8c), and the electrochemically nano-confined Ga2Te3 crystallites were still preserved after 100 cycles (Fig. 8d). Consequently, we proposed a unique three-step nano-confinement procedure for Ga2Te3 nanocrystallites in the BM-Ga2Te3/C composite (Fig. 8e) that results in a highly reversible capacity, excellent capacity retention, and best rate capability for LIB anodes; these steps include (1) mechanochemical nano-confinement by high-energy BM (Ga2Te3 size: 6–8 nm); (2) electrochemical nano-confinement by conversion/recombination reactions during galvanostatic cycling (Ga2Te3 size: 2–3 nm); and (3) electrochemically stabilized nano-confinement by repeated conversion/recombination reactions during the ongoing galvanostatic cycling (Ga2Te3 size: 2–3 nm). Meanwhile, the size of the Ga2Te3 crystallites in the TD-Ga2Te3/C composite was increased slightly as a result of the electrochemical cycling (Fig. S17†), which results in capacity degradation during cycling. Furthermore, to confirm the practical performance of the BM-Ga2Te3/C anode, the full cell comprising the LCO cathode and BM-Ga2Te3/C anode was assembled and the electrochemical performance was tested at a current density of 0.1C (Fig. S18†). The LCO//BM-Ga2Te3/C full cell delivered ∼3.0 V and ∼110 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 2.0–4.2 V.60,61

Conclusions
Ga2Te3 and its composites, applicable to LIB anodes, were developed. Various ex situ analysis results were obtained to reveal the conversion/recombination reaction mechanisms of the Ga2Te3 anode during the lithiation/delithiation processes. The key strategy of the Ga2Te3/C nanocomposite anode to achieve high capacity and long-term cycling performance was to homogeneously embed nano-confined Ga2Te3 crystallites within an electronically conductive carbon matrix via a high-energy BM process, which would not only promote the kinetics of the electrochemical processes of Ga2Te3 with the Li ions, but also improve the mechanical stability of the electrode by accommodating the volume change of the Ga2Te3 particles and preventing the agglomeration of Ga. The BM-Ga2Te3/C composite anode exhibited the highest gravimetric and volumetric capacities with a very stable capacity retention compared to a TD-Ga2Te3/C composite anode, and the as-synthesized Ga2Te3 and conventional graphite anodes for LIBs. Furthermore, the BM-Ga2Te3/C composite anode exhibited a high initial volumetric capacity of 1245 mA h cm−3, durable capacity retention of 93.2% after 500 cycles, and fast and stable rate capability (approximately 1000 mA h cm−3 at 1C after 500 cycles), which were far superior to those of the other electrodes, including a conventional graphite anode tested in this work. The high electrochemical performance of the BM-Ga2Te3/C composite was achieved by a three-step nano-confinement that included (1) mechanochemical nano-confinement (mechanochemically nano-confined Ga2Te3 size: 6–8 nm), (2) electrochemical nano-confinement (electrochemically nano-confined Ga2Te3 size: 2–3 nm), and (3) electrochemically stabilized nano-confinement (electrochemically stabilized nano-confined Ga2Te3 size: 2–3 nm). Thus, the BM-Ga2Te3/C composite can be a promising alternative anode material for high-performance LIBs.
