    , Accepted 6th February 2022First published on 7th February 2022AbstractThe conversion of electricity to chemical energy is a key technology for absorbing the fluctuations of electricity and utilizing solar and wind-powered electricities as chemical fuels. An electrochemical system equipped with a phosphate-based electrolyte has been reported as a promising method to efficiently obtain CH4 from CO2 and H2O in a single electrochemical cell. Electrochemical cells with 10 wt%-Ru/ZrO2, Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/TiO2 were examined for CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O at 210–270 °C and 10 mA cm−2. Approximately 13 and 1 nmol s−1 cm−2 of CH4 and H2, respectively, were formed using the Ru/ZrO2 cell at 270 °C, and the current efficiencies for CH4 and H2 formation were 97 and 3%, respectively. The cells with Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/TiO2 produced lower CH4 yields. An H-permeable membrane (Pd–Ag) cathode cell, which was designed in a previous study, and a newly designed PTFE membrane filter cell was investigated with Ru/ZrO2. Both cells demonstrated similar formation rates and current efficiencies, which means that the Pd–Ag membrane is not essential for the synthesis of CH4 from CO2 and H2O. The catalysts were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy and temperature-programmed desorption of H2.
1. Introduction
Currently, renewable energy-based electricity sources, such as solar thermal plants, photovoltaic plants, wind farms, and tidal power stations, are being widely installed to reduce the consumption of carbon-based fossil resources.1 Technology for the efficient utilization of such carbon-free primary energies will lead to the establishment of a carbon-neutral society. The most significant barrier to the adoption of such renewable energy-based electricity is that these technologies are highly dependent on climate and cannot be used freely according to human demands.2 Surplus electricity generated from such power plants is frequently seen in various parts of the world. In other cases, renewable energy-based electricity is frequently limited, meaning that society is dependent on fossil fuel-based thermal power plants. Areas rich in renewable energy are sometimes far from populated areas, and transportation over long distances is required. Rechargeable batteries can assist in stabilizing and transporting electricity. However, rechargeable batteries have limited capacity (260 W h kg−1 or 0.936 kJ g−1 for Li ion batteries).3,4 The capacities of currently available batteries are not sufficient for stabilizing over weeks or months or for long-distance transportation of energy.
The most promising technology for utilizing such renewable energy-based electricity is the conversion of electricity to chemical energy.5–7 For example, hydrogen (H2) has a heat of combustion of 142 kJ g−1,8,9 which is more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of Li-ion batteries. Methane (CH4) is a gaseous fuel commonly used as liquefied natural gas, which has a heat of combustion of 55.5 kJ g−1.8,9 Therefore, infrastructure including pipelines, storage tanks, transport ships, and liquefaction/gasification plants are already available. Because CH4 is currently one of the main fuels used in thermal power plants, existing power plants already have the capacity to convert it to electricity. CO2 is easily obtained from chemical plants, power plants, and refuse incinerators. Even when humans establish a fossil fuel-free society, CO2 will still be emitted when biomass waste is burned. When CH4 is synthesized from CO2 and H2O using renewable energy-based electricity, CH4 is regarded as a carbon-neutral energy carrier. The conversion of CO2 and H2O to form CH4 using electricity has been intensively developed with the combination of water electrolysis and CO2 methanation.10–12 Pilot plants to test this process on a practical scale are being installed in many countries. H2 can be converted to CH4 from CO2 by the Sabatier reaction, to NH3 from N2 by the Haber–Bosch reaction, to CO from CO2 by the reverse water gas shift reaction, to methanol from CO by methanol synthesis, and to gasoline and diesel from CO by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. All of these processes are conventionally available.13,14 Therefore a number of chemical fuels can be synthesized when H2 is obtained by water electrolysis. However, our group has proposed a technique to convert CO2 and N2 with H2O directly to CH4 and NH3, respectively, using an electrochemical system at intermediate temperatures of 200–270 °C.15 Direct synthesis using a combination of an electrolyzer and catalyst bed eliminates the requirement for a reservoir tank of H2, and has the advantage of fluctuating operation. This combination also enables thermal compensation between the exothermic and endothermic reactions. Theoretically, the thermally balanced potential for the electrochemical reaction of CO2 and H2O to form CH4, H2O, and O2 is slightly smaller than that for water electrolysis, indicating that the water electrolysis and methanation reactions perform better when thermally coupled to each other in a single vessel at the same temperature.15 The thermodynamic properties are discussed in Section 3.5.
Electrochemical CO2 reduction has been examined by many researchers over many years.16–22 A typical example is the reduction of CO2 to CH4, C2H4, and several organic compounds using Cu-based electrodes in aqueous electrolyte.16–22 The small selectivity for a variety of products, relatively high overpotential, and low current density are still serious problems16,20 that make this reaction unsuitable for industrial energy conversion. Technologies that reduce CO2 to CO at low temperatures have been far more successful than the those that rely on the production of hydrocarbons.21 However, CO cannot function as a fuel on its own, and another catalytic process is required to form hydrocarbons or alcohols after electrolysis. A high-temperature (800–1000 °C) electrochemical system with solid oxide electrolytes is another candidate for the electrochemical synthesis of chemical fuels.21 However, hydrocarbons or alcohols are readily decomposed at such temperatures; therefore, water electrolysis to form H2, CO2 reduction to form CO, and co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2 to form H2 and CO are possible at these temperatures.18 Therefore, at intermediate temperatures (200–300 °C), the electrochemical system has the potential to directly synthesize hydrocarbons from CO2 with H2O. However, there are only a few sufficient electrolytes in the 200–400 °C temperature range, and the development of electrolysis at these temperatures has not progressed sufficiently.23
Phosphate-based electrolytes have appropriate proton conductivity in the intermediate temperature region of 200–300 °C,24 and this temperature range is also suitable for catalytic CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2. The composite of CsH2PO4 and SiP2O7 has been reported to have ionic conductivity, log(σ)/S cm−1 > −1.5 in the range of 200–300 °C,24 and a single cell fuel cell using CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 has been reported to have maximum power density of 45 mW cm−2 at 120 mA cm−2.25 An electrochemical system with CsH2PO4/SiP2O7, which uses an electrochemical water gas shift reaction, has been applied to H2 production from CO and H2O at 200 °C, indicating that the CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 electrolytes could be applied for the electrochemical synthesis of fuels.26 In addition, CsH2PO4 has been used as a molten salt at 350 °C, and has been applied to CH4 synthesis from CO2.27 However, the CH4 yield has not been clearly established and the current efficiencies (CEs) for CH4, H2, and CO have not been well clarified in the case of the molten salt.27 The CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 composite has an advantage over the molten CsH2PO4 salts, as solid-like electrolytes do not fully cover electrocatalysts to maintain mass transfer of reactants and products. Our group has reported NH3 synthesis from N2 and H2O using a cell with a CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 electrolyte, Pd–Ag H-permeable membrane, and Ru catalyst.28–30 Our previous communication demonstrated the application of this electrochemical system to CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O.15
We have previously reported CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O using an electrochemical system equipped with a Ru/TiO2 catalyst, H-permeable membrane, and CsH2PO4-based electrolyte.15 The concept of CH4 production from CO2 and H2O using electricity as a green fuel is illustrated in Fig. 1. The chemical equations for each of the reaction components are detailed below.

Our previous communication demonstrated that 93, 1.7, and 0.33% of electrons were converted to CH4, H2, and CO, respectively.15 However, the experimental technique and results obtained in the previous study were preliminary, and further investigation was required to investigate the feasibility of the electrochemical CH4 synthesis system from CO2 and H2O. In this report, we describe our detailed investigation of the electrochemical system for CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O. A few catalysts and various support materials were investigated for use in this electrochemical cell. Several types of electrode structures were also examined.
2. Experiments
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Oxide-supported Ru catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method using a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of Ru3(CO)12 (Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.). ZrO2 (JRC-ZRO-9), Al2O3 (JRC-ALO-9), and TiO2 (JRC-TIO-16) were provided by the Catalysis Society of Japan. The specific surface areas of ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 are 100.5, 204, and 109 m2 g−1, respectively. These support oxides were calcined at 500 °C in air to remove adsorbed impurities, and then immersed in a THF solution of Ru3(CO)12 for 3 h with stirring. The loading amount of Ru metal was fixed at 10 wt%. The THF solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator below 50 °C with evacuation to avoid the decomposition of Ru3(CO)12. The obtained orange-yellow powders were heated in vacuum at 400 °C to decompose the carbonyl complex. The Ru catalysts were pressed into disks and crushed. Granules of 500–800 μm in size were obtained by sieving. Approximately 800, 400, and 400 mg of Ru/ZrO2, Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/TiO2 catalysts, respectively, were used to maintain a constant bulk volume.
The catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEM-2100F, JEOL at Kyushu University, Japan. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were performed using a homemade apparatus that can operate at a cryogenic temperature of −190 °C (83 K).
2.2. Electrolyte preparation
Phosphate electrolytes of the CsH2PO4 and SiP2O7 composite were used. CsH2PO4 was obtained by neutralization of H3PO4 (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co.) using an aqueous solution of Cs2CO3 (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co.), followed by drying at 120 °C. SiP2O7 was prepared by stirring H3PO4 and SiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h to obtain a uniform viscous slurry. The slurry was calcined at 200 °C in air for 3 h. The obtained lumps were crushed using a mortar. Finally, the powder was calcined at 500 °C in air for 3 h. CsH2PO4 and SiP2O7 (1:2 molar ratio) were mixed in a mortar and then pressed to form a disk of 20 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness.
2.3. Electrode preparation
Two types of cathodes were investigated. The structures of these cathodes are shown in Fig. 2. One was a Pd-25 wt% Ag membrane (Fig. 2A). Pd-25 wt% Ag membrane (Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.) had 0.1 mm thick and 25 mm diameter. The center part of 20 mm diameter of Pd membrane was attached to the phosphate electrolyte. This H-permeable membrane cell was designed for NH3 synthesis from N2 and H2O in our previous study, and it is also applicable to CH4 synthesis. H atoms produced by the dissociative adsorption of H2 can permeate into Pd alloy membranes and desorb from opposite side as H2, the other molecules cannot. Pd alloy membranes are frequently used for the purification of H2. The Pd alloy membranes can also act as cathode as a precious metal electrode. The use of an H-permeable membrane avoids several problems through the following mechanisms;15,28–30
 Fig. 2  Magnified views of two types of electrochemical cells for methanation from CO2 and H2O. H-permeable membrane cathode cell (A) and membrane filter cathode cell (B). 
(1) Products in contact with the electrolyte are absorbed into the electrolyte,
(2) The steam produced by water electrolysis penetrates from the anode side to the cathode side and mixes with the product,
(3) Steam penetrating the cathode side poisons the Ru catalysts, and
(4) The Ru catalysts are covered with an exuded electrolyte and deactivated.
However, these advantages are critical for NH3 synthesis from N2 and H2O, but not for CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O. Neither CH4 nor CO2 are alkaline, unlike NH3; therefore, they are not absorbed by the protonic electrolyte. In CH4 synthesis, H2O exists as a product on the cathode side, meaning the steam does not cause catalyst poisoning.
Therefore, another type of cathode was designed (Fig. 2B). Pt paste (Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.) was spread on carbon paper (Toray, TGP-H-120H) with a diameter of 20 mm and a density of ca. 3 mg Pt cm−2, and then dried at 300 °C. CsH2PO4 is almost melted in the range of 200–300 °C and supported by SiP2O7. Therefore, hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane filter (Advantech Toyo Co.) was placed between the Pt/carbon paper and Ru catalysts to avoid penetration of the CsH2PO4 into the catalyst layer. The hydrophobic PTFE membrane filter is permeable for any gaseous molecule, but not for polar solvents.
We used Pt/carbon paper as an anode in previous studies.15,28–30 However, a Ti sintered metal electrode (0.5 mm thick, 60% porosity) with a Pt coating (0.2 μm thick) was used for both the H-permeable membrane cathode and membrane filter cathode cells in this study. Pt coated Ti sintered metal was provided from Bekaert Japan Co. Ti sintered metal was cut to form 20 mm diameter disk, and washed by acetone and ethanol in prior to use. With Pt/carbon paper, the lifetime of the cell when operated continuously was several days, and the cell voltage rose sharply after that. The Pt/Ti electrode has a lifetime of a few weeks for stable operation. All diameters of Ti sintered metal anode, Pt alloy cathode, and phosphate electrolyte were 20 mm, so the geometric area of electrode was calculated as 3.14 cm2.
2.4. Gas handling system
The gas handling system is illustrated in Fig. 3. The flow of Ar, CO2, and H2 was controlled by mass flow controllers (MFCs). H2 was used for the pretreatment of the catalysts before electrolysis. To balance the stoichiometry between CO2 and current flows, an MFC (Model 3200, Kofloc Co.) with a small full scale of 1.0 cmSTP3 was required. Liquid H2O was supplied by a plunger pump, which is typically used for liquid chromatography, and evaporated in a small chamber filled with porous oxide balls. The temperature of the electrochemical cell was maintained between 210–270 °C by an electric heater and thermocouple, and was placed in an oven at 100 °C to avoid condensation. The exhaust gas from the cathode side was dried using a silica-gel column and analysed using a gas chromatograph (GC) with a thermal conductivity detector.
 Fig. 3  Schematic illustration of gas handling system. The abbreviations are as follows: mass flow controller (MFC), check valve (CV), plunger pump (PP), evaporation chamber (EC), pressure gauge (PG), back-pressure regulating valve (BRV), silica-gel column (SC), 6-way sampling valve (SV), gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD-GC). 
Notably, the absolute rates of formation of CH4, CO, and H2 were estimated from the ratios of CH4, CO, H2, and CO2, respectively, measured by GC and the flow rate of feeding CO2, assuming a carbon balance of 100%. The ratio of CH4, CO, H2, and CO2 in the exhaust gas from cathode vessel was measured by GC. H2O in the exhaust was not quantified because it was removed by a silica-gel trap. The absolute rates of formation of CH4, CO, and H2 were based on that total molar amount of CH4, CO, and CO2 in the exhaust is same to feeding CO2. The feeding of CO2 was 0.055 cmSTP3 min−1, which corresponds to 130 nmol s−1 cm−2. Thus, sum of the rates of CH4, CO, and CO2 in the exhaust was 130 nmol s−1 cm−2. Because the accuracy of the flow rate of CO2 at the 0.055 cmSTP3 min−1 level was remarkably low, the absolute CE was prone to considerable error. It should be noted that the accuracy of feeding CO2 flow was 0.055 ± 0.01 cmSTP3 min−1, as indicated in the manual book of mass flow controller. By the way, theoretical amount of initial H2 with current density of 10 mA cm−2 was 521 nmol s−1 cm−2, which was equivalent to the flow of 0.22 cmSTP3 per min per cell.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of catalysts
TEM images of 10 wt%-Ru/ZrO2, Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/TiO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4A–C. All catalysts consisted of 2–3 nm Ru particles (dark gray images) on the surfaces of 10–40 nm oxide particles (light gray images, Fig. 4). The Ru particles were relatively difficult to distinguish in the Ru/ZrO2 TEM image because the atomic weight of Zr was similar to that of Ru. Therefore, only a few small Ru particles were observed. Energy dispersive X-ray mapping was performed for Ru/ZrO2 to produce the secondary electron images, Zr L and Ru L (Fig. 4D). Ru was found to be uniformly dispersed on the ZrO2 particles. Thus, while small Ru particles were observed in Fig. 4A, Ru particles were considered to be dispersed on the whole part of the oxide support surfaces as well as the other oxides.

TPD analysis of H2 adsorption was performed for Ru/ZrO2, Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/TiO2 catalysts. The catalysts were pretreated in 50 kPa of H2 at 400 °C using a vacuum system with a base pressure of 10−4 Pa. The H2 gas was evacuated at 400 °C, and the catalysts were cooled to −190 °C under high vacuum. At −190 °C, 5 kPa of H2 was introduced to the sample tube and then evacuated after a few minutes. The catalysts were heated at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and the desorption of H2 into the high-vacuum chamber was monitored using a quadrupole mass analyzer. The homemade apparatus can be operated at −190 °C, and the results can be compared to surface results using single-crystal samples.
The results of the TPD of H2 are shown in Fig. 5. The profiles of the three catalysts are significantly different from each other. First, we explain the TPD profile of Ru/Al2O3. On well-defined Ru surfaces of Ru (111), the TPD profile of H2 has three components: α-H is desorbed at −158 °C and appears as a sharp peak, β-H is desorbed at –98 to 7 °C and appears as a broad peak, and γ-H is desorbed at 72 °C and appears as a broad peak.31 The TPD profiles of H2 from the Ru (111) surface were similar to those of the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. Thus, the desorption of H2 from Ru/Al2O3 was ascribed to desorption from the dissociatively adsorbed H atoms on clean metallic Ru sites. H2 desorption from metallic sites of various metal catalysts takes place between −200 and 100 °C. However, the low-temperature range is frequently ignored in studies because of the limitations of the apparatus. In the case of Ru(001), two peaks have been reported at 60 and 120 °C in the TPD profiles of H2, which are denoted β1 and β2.32,33 The TPD profiles of H2 from Ru(001) are not similar to those of the Ru catalysts. The present TPD profile from Ru/Al2O3 was similar to that of Ru (111) but not to Ru(001) because the arrangement of Ru atoms at the Ru particle surface was complicated, similar to the high-index single crystal surface. The majority of the Ru surface is not flat and close-packed. Therefore, the desorption of H2 from Ru/ZrO2 was observed in the same temperature range as that of Ru/Al2O3, which means it can be assigned to adsorbed H atoms on clean metallic Ru sites. However, the volume of H2 desorbed from Ru/ZrO2 was significantly smaller than that from Ru/Al2O3. Clean Ru sites were not effectively exposed on the surface in the case of Ru/ZrO2, while the rate of CH4 formation for this catalyst was the highest. In such cases involving limited surface area, a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) is sometimes suspected. Although ZrO2 was first reported to be negative for SMSI,34 there are some reports of SMSI of supported metal catalysts.35–37 In any case, the desorption of H2 below 100 °C originated from metallic Ru sites, and the number of metallic Ru sites was somewhat smaller for Ru/ZrO2. Above approximately 400 °C, the desorption of H2 increased with increasing temperature. This desorption originated from H2 on ZrO2 by H2 spillover.38,39 In the case of Ru/TiO2, there was more desorption of H2 from metallic Ru sites below 100 °C than in the case of Ru/Al2O3, indicating that the Ru surfaces were not covered with TiO2 by SMSI in the present case. A new intense desorption peak was observed at 200 °C. The peak at 200 °C did not originate from the H2 species on the metallic Ru sites. TiO2 has been known to be positive for H2 spillover between metal and TiO2 surfaces.40–42 The desorption peak at 200 °C was assigned to the desorption of H2 on TiO2 sites through spillover to the Ru sites.
 Fig. 5  TPD profiles of H2 from 10 wt%-Ru/ZrO2, Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/TiO2. The catalysts were prepared with 50 kPa of H2 at 400 °C and then the H2 gas was evacuated. H2 adsorption was performed at 5 kPa after cooling to −190 °C in vacuum. The heating rate was 10 °C min−1. The trace for Ru/ZrO2 was enlarged by five times and shifted upward. 
For the desorption of H2 from metallic Ru sites below 100 °C, the peaks can be separated into two peaks at −120 and −40 °C. The peaks at −120 °C predominated in the results for Ru/Al2O3, while peaks at −40 °C were the most prominent for Ru/TiO2 and Ru/ZrO2. We believe that the surfaces of Ru particles on Al2O3 were closer to those of single-crystal Ru because of the similarities between their peak shapes. The Ru particles on TiO2 and ZrO2 were considered to have support interactions.
A large number of studies have been published on CO2 methanation (Sabatier reaction) with H2.43–48 The present three catalysts are very typical examples, and there is significant room for improvement. In this study, a 1.5 mm layer comprising 400–800 mg of catalyst was used. However, the catalyst could be significantly reduced in size through optimization. A catalyst layer less than 0.1 mm thick is ideal.
3.2. Temperature dependence of CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O
The temperature dependence of the rates of formation of CH4, H2, and CO from CO2 and H2O at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is shown in Fig. 6A. H-permeable membrane cells were used in these experiments. The flow of CO2 in the cathode chamber was fixed at 0.055 cmSTP3 min−1, as this flow maintained the stoichiometry of an 8-electron reaction against 10 mA cm−2 (total 31 mA for 3.1 cm2 of cross section). Our previous communication demonstrated that the stoichiometric operation of the cell led to the maximum conversion of CO2 and H2. In our previous communication, we only presented the results for Ru/TiO2. However, three catalysts, Ru/ZrO2, Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/TiO2, were examined. For Ru/TiO2, the rate of formation of CH4 increased, but that of H2 decreased with increasing temperature from 210–270 °C. The formation of CO was also detected with Ru/TiO2. This indicates that the rate of CH4 formation was kinetically limited. However, in the cases of Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3, the rates of CH4 formation were much higher than those for Ru/TiO2, and the rates of formation of CH4 and H2 were not significantly dependent on temperature. As discussed in the following section, the CO2 conversion for CH4 formation was close to the chemical equilibrium, and the rate was not controlled by the reaction kinetics of catalysis because it was less dependent on temperature. The rate for Ru/ZrO2 was slightly higher than that for Ru/Al2O3; however, it was considered to originate not from the difference in the essential catalytic activity, but from the morphological effects on the mass transfer of reactants and products in the catalyst layer. If the activity of Ru/Al2O3 is significantly lower than that of Ru/ZrO2, the rate of formation of CH4 should demonstrate a strong temperature dependence. The catalyst layer was in a counter-flow arrangement for H2 and CO2, which is a disadvantage for the homogeneous mixing of reactants. For Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3, CO formation was not detected. Ru/TiO2 clearly demonstrated less activity than Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3; therefore, the formation of a partially reduced species of CO was likely.
 Fig. 6  Formation rates of CH4, H2, and CO (A), reaction ratios of H2 to CH4 + 2H2O and CO + H2O (B), and current efficiencies of CH4, H2, and CO (C) for the synthesis of CH4 from CO2 and H2O with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 as a function of temperature. 10 wt%-Ru/ZrO2 (circles), Ru/Al2O3 (triangles), and Ru/TiO2 (squares) were used as catalysts. CO2 flow in the cathode chamber was 0.055 cmSTP3 min−1, and Ar flow in the anode chamber was 10 cmSTP3 min−1 with an injection of H2O at 5.0 μLliquid min−1. 
In our previous short article, we examined synthesis of CH4, from a mixture of CO2 and H2 as a catalytic reaction using a same catalyst layer in the present cell.14 In this catalytic reaction, Ru/TiO2 was examined a mixture of 0.90 cmSTP3 min−1 of CO2 and 3.6 cmSTP3 min−1 of H2 and formation of CH4 with almost equilibrium limit above 210 °C was found. CO was not detected in this case. The catalyst layer has enough activity and selectivity for the mixture of CO2 and H2. However, in the case of the electrolysis presented in this study, the flow of CO2 was 20 times smaller than that for the catalytic reaction of CO2 and H2. Insufficient mixing of CO2 and H2 in the catalyst layer is a problem to be solved in the future. The amount of catalyst can be fundamentally reduced by 20 times. It should be noted that there could be no electrochemical effect on Ru catalysts because Ru catalysts do not attach to the electrolyte. The electrochemical potential was applied at the interface between the Ag membrane and phosphate electrolyte and Ru catalyst layer is electronically neutral.
In the present cell, H2 was first obtained by electrolysis with 10 mA cm−2, which was equivalent to 0.22 cmSTP3 min−1. The reaction ratio of H2 to CH4 + 2H2O and CO + H2O was defined using the following equation, and they are shown in Fig. 6B.    where XCH4 and XCO are the percentage reaction ratios of H2 to form CH4 + 2H2O and CO + H2O, respectively, and rCH4, rH2, and rCO are the rates of formation of CH4, H2, and CO, respectively. The formation rates of H2O could not be measured in our system, conversion ratios of H2 to respective products of CH4, H2O, and H2 could not be obtained, and therefore the reaction ratios of H2 to form CH4 + 2H2O and CO + H2O were estimated. More than 90% reaction ratios of H2 was achieved for Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3 over the entire temperature range and for Ru/TiO2 at 270 °C. A reaction ratios higher than 90% indicates that the activities of the catalysts were sufficiently high at the present current density. Therefore, this electrochemical system has sufficient potential for practical applications.
To understand the equilibrium limit of reaction ratios, the chemical equilibrium was calculated (Fig. 7). The calculation was performed using the Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) software provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States.49,50 The calculation was performed for a 1:4 stoichiometric mixture of CO2 and H2 at a total pressure of 101 kPa. The conversion of CO2 to CH4 is almost same to that of H2 to CH4 + 2H2O because the mixture of CO2 and H2 is stoichiometric and CO formation is negligibly small. The equilibrium (Fig. 7) is in good agreement with that reported in the literature.51,52 The experimental reaction ratio to CH4 for Ru/ZrO2 (Fig. 6) was consistent with the equilibrium limit shown in Fig. 7, and the rate of formation of CH4 was limited by the chemical equilibrium. The formation of CO was thermodynamically unfavorable, and CO was not formed with Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3. As CO is an intermediate and reactant for the formation of CH4, CO is temporally formed in the cell prior to methanation in the case of Ru/TiO2. The present cell had a counter-flow arrangement at the catalyst layer for H2 and CO2; therefore, the ununiform mixing of reactant gases without enough contact-time might have enhanced CO formation.
 Fig. 7  Theoretical conversions of CO2 to CH4 and CO at chemical equilibrium for the 1:4 stoichiometric mixture of CO2 and H2 at total pressure of 101 kPa. 
The CEs for CH4, CO, and H2 formation (CECH4, CECO, and CEH2, respectively) were calculated as follows:14      where rCH4, rCO, and rH2 are the rates of formation of CH4, CO, and H2, respectively, in mol cm−2 s−1. F and j are the faradaic constant (96500 s A mol−1) and current density in A cm−2, respectively. The CE must theoretically be the same as the reaction ratios of H2, as shown in Fig. 5B. The CEs shown in Fig. 5C were found to be similar to those of the reaction ratios of H2. However, the summed CEs for all products were not close to 100%. A total CE, or a CE above 100%, is theoretically impossible, and results above 100% were obtained due to experimental error. The reaction ratio of H2 was estimated from the ratios of the product yields to the quantities of products and unreacted H2. Accuracy was maintained if the relative rates among the products were certain. However, the CEs were dependent on the absolute rates, which were derived from the flow rate of CO2. This experiment was performed with a CO2 flow rate of 0.055 cmSTP3 min−1, which is a low flow rate to be controlled and measured accurately. The deviation of the total CE for all products from 100% reflects the accuracy of the CO2 flow rates. The realistic CE for CH4 were the difference between 100% and CEs for H2 and CO. Thus, for Ru/ZrO at 270 °C, CEs for CH4 and H2 were 97 and 3%, respectively. In our previous study on NH3 synthesis, the total CE was closer to 100%, but it deviated from 100% when the flow rate decreased. In our previous work on NH3 synthesis, the N2 flow rate at 1.0 cmSTP3 min−1, which was out of stoichiometry, was an optimized value; thus, the flow was much higher than that of the CO2.28–30 When the total CE is much smaller than 100%, another factor should be considered. The leakage of gas from the cathode chamber to the outside was believed to explain the lower CE. In our previous work on NH3 synthesis, a total CE of less than 100% was frequently observed for high-pressure experiments up to 1.0 MPa. This was due to leakage. The leakage between the anode and cathode also likely decreased the total CE. When the formed O2 at the anode migrates through the cracks of the electrolyte or sealing material, it reaches the cathode and combines with H2, decreasing the total CE.
In the present study, only Ru/ZrO2, Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/TiO2 catalysts were examined, and Ru/ZrO2 was found to demonstrate the highest formation rates of CH4. The methanation reaction of CO2 with H2 has been thoroughly investigated since its discovery by Sabatier in 1897, and a large number of studies have been published.33–35 The most investigated catalysts were Ru, Ni, Fe, and Ru, and the activity of Ru is superior. However, as Ru is a limited resource, Ni-or Fe-based catalysts are better alternatives. Furthermore, the development of catalysts with promoters in addition to oxide-supported metal catalysts has progressed.33–35 The present electrochemical system is expected to reduce the thickness the incorporation with advanced type of catalysts. While, the present study demonstrates a new type of electrochemical system, further developments in electrochemical cells and catalysts are required.
3.3. Electric properties of electrochemical cell
The current density versus cell voltage for the H-permeable Pd–Ag membrane cathode is shown in Fig. 8. The voltage was increased from 0 V, and the current appeared at 1.4 V before increasing. At 2.8 V, the current density reached approximately 15 mA cm−2. The current density sometimes fluctuated due to the electric contact between the cell components. Such fluctuations were also observed in the results discussed in the next paragraph. The current density monotonically increased with increasing voltage between 2.0 and 2.8 V, indicating that the current density was controlled by resistivity but not reaction kinetics, according to the Tafel equation. With decreasing voltage from 2.8 V, the current density followed the trace of the positive scan. For the negative scan, downward peaks of current density were observed at 0.7 and 0 V. These were considered to be a result of the reduction of Pt–O and formation of Pt–H on the anode. Although the cell voltage was practically higher than the theoretical value discussed in Section 3.5, the theoretical advantage of direct CH4 synthesis in the cell voltage has not been observed experimentally. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is the powerful tool to understand the components of resistances such as kinetic resistance at electrode interfaces, ionic conductivity in the electrolyte, and electric resistances. However, reasonable results of EIS have not been successfully obtained in the present work. The present cell was still primitive, and the cell voltage was considered to be mainly decided by the contact of mechanical components with influenced by the corrosion of the surfaces. For clear understanding of components of overpotential, further investigation should be required.
 Fig. 8  Current density versus cell voltage. The cell was operated at 270 °C with synthesis of CH4 from CO2 flow of 0.055 cmSTP3 min−1. The output voltage of power supply was scanned at 0.50 mV s−1 as the constant voltage mode. 
The long-term stability of the electrochemical cell was examined, as shown in Fig. 9. The cell was operated with a constant-current power supply to maintain a constant synthesis rate, meaning that the current density was maintained at 10 mA cm−2. In the first 200 min, the cell could not be operated at a constant current because the supply of steam for electrolysis was insufficient, and the condition of the electrolyte was not appropriate. Typically, this induction period (Fig. 9) was not used in the other experiments. Thus, to quickly start the system, the temperature and steam flow should be maintained. After the induction period, the cell voltage was kept below 3.0 V for 5 days. Notably, the voltage was relatively stable on the first day but fluctuated thereafter. This problem was a result of corrosion at the surfaces of the cell components that interfered with the electric contact.
 Fig. 9  Cell voltage and current density as a function of elapsed time. The cell was operated at 270 °C with synthesis of CH4 from a CO2 flow of 0.055 cmSTP3 min−1. The power supply was operated in constant current mode. 
The theoretical equilibrium voltage of electrochemical CH4 synthesis from steam was 1.02 V, as discussed in Section 3.5. However, the practical cell voltage varied between 2 and 3 V, depending on the cell assembly. The Pt anode, which was made from Pt paste coated on a carbon-fiber paper, had a lower electrolysis voltage.28–30 However, the cell with the Pt-plated Ti sintered metal anode had a longer lifetime and a higher voltage. In any case, the high cell voltage was determined by experimental and technical methods, and should be optimized to obtain a cell voltage closer to the theoretical value. Considering that the CE of the cell with Ru/ZrO2 was close to 100% (Fig. 6C), the energy efficiency of this system was determined predominantly from the cell voltage. Because the cell voltage was 2.8 V, the energy efficiency was estimated to be 41% from the thermally balanced potential.
3.4. Cathode with hydrophobic membrane filters
The cell with the H-permeable Pd–Ag membrane cathode was originally developed for NH3 synthesis. The Pd–Ag membrane was found to be effective for NH3 synthesis. However, for CH4 synthesis, isolation between the reactant/product gases and electrolyte was considered to be unimportant. Pd–Ag membranes are precious materials that are better replaced with other materials. Thus, the cell shown in Fig. 2B was examined using 10 wt%-Ru/ZrO2. A Pt electrode made from Pt paste on carbon paper was used as the cathode, and Ru/ZrO2 was isolated from the cathode by a hydrophobic PTFE membrane filter. The rates of formation of CH4, H2, and CO as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 10A. There was no significant difference in the rate of formation obtained for the Pd–Ag membrane cell (Fig. 6). A small production of CO was detected, when using the Pt carbon paper cathode (Fig. 10A), but not when using the original Pd–Ag membrane cell (Fig. 6). Visualization of the inside of the cell after the experiments revealed that a small volume of electrolyte had leaked into the catalyst layer. The formation of CO may originate from poisoning of the catalyst by the electrolyte.
 Fig. 10  Formation rates of CH4, H2, and CO (A) and current efficiencies for the formation of CH4, H2, and CO (B) from CO2 and H2O with the current density at 10 mA cm−2 as a function of temperature. 10 wt%-Ru/ZrO2, hydrophobic membrane filter, and carbon paper with Pt paste were used for the cathode side. CO2 flow in the cathode chamber was 0.055 cmSTP3 min−1, and Ar flow in the anode chamber was 10 cmSTP3 min−1 with injection of H2O at 5.0 μLliquid min−1. 
The CEs calculated from the data in Fig. 10A are plotted in Fig. 10B. More than 90% of the electrons are used for the formation of CH4. The error in the total efficiency measurement was caused by the low CO2 flow, as discussed in Section 3.2.
Thus, the use of a Pd–Ag membrane was found to be unnecessary for CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O using a phosphate-based electrochemical cell. However, the hydrophobic PTFE membrane filter is mechanically weak, and careful assembly of the cell is required. The leakage of the melted electrolyte into the catalyst layer negatively affected the catalyst activity.
3.5. Thermodynamic properties of direct CH4 synthesis
Additionally, we discuss the thermodynamic advantage of the direct synthesis of CH4 from CO2 and H2O by the combination of water electrolysis and methanation in the final part. Although the thermodynamic advantage has not been experimentally confirmed in this work, the essential advantage of direct synthesis using a single vessel is explained in this section.
The thermodynamic requirements for the combination of water electrolysis to produce H2 from H2O and methanation of CO2 and H2 are shown in Fig. 11A. Water electrolysis is a typical up–hill reaction with an enthalpy of reaction (ΔrH°) of 286 kJ mol−1 H2. The energies are expressed as those per H2, since the energies can be normalized by H2 obtained by electrolysis according to reaction eqn (2). The ΔrG° corresponds to the electrochemical potential, which equals 1.23 V as a two-electron reaction.7–9 The difference between the ΔrH° and ΔrG° (TΔrS°) is 49 kJ mol−1 H2, so that the excess heat outside of 1.23 V is required for water electrolysis. The ΔrH° is equivalent to 1.48 V in an assumed two-electron process, which can be referred to as a thermally balanced potential. Methanation of CO2 and H2 is an exothermic reaction with an ΔrH° of −41 kJ mol−1 H2, and this heat is wasted if not utilized. The methanation reaction is typically performed at 200–400 °C. When water electrolysis is performed with a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) or alkaline electrolyte electrolyzers below 100 °C, the exothermic heat of the methanation reaction cannot be fully utilized for water electrolysis because of the difference in temperature. When water electrolysis is performed with solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), the cell temperature is 800–1000 °C, and the exothermic heat at 200–400 °C is insufficient.
 Fig. 11  Thermodynamic parameters for combined water electrolysis and CO2 methanation (A) and direct CO2 methanation with H2O (B). 
However, in the direct CO2 methanation with H2O (Fig. 11B), the ΔrH° and ΔrG° are 223 and 205 kJ mol−1 H2, respectively, which are equivalent to 1.16 and 1.06 V, respectively.22 These thermodynamic requirements are significantly smaller than those for water electrolysis. Even if CO2 is not electrochemically reduced, but catalytically hydrogenated, the thermodynamic requirements are maintained because they originate from the parameters of the reactants and products but not from the pathways. This indicates that for the hydrogenation of CO2, the small chemical potential of H2 is sufficient when all of the elemental reaction steps are thermally equilibrated at a constant temperature.
The thermodynamic parameters from steam but not liquid H2O are also shown in Fig. 11.7–9 The values are different from those from liquid H2O by the heat of vaporization and the difference in entropies. The required energy for CH4 synthesis from steam is smaller than those from liquid H2O for both A and B cases. For the present CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O, steam was supplied and this value is applicable. It should be noted that ΔrG° is larger than ΔrH° in the case of direct synthesis of CH4 from CO2 and H2O, indication that direct synthesis of CH4 is exothermic. This nature is in contrast to electrolysis of H2O. A part of electricity is released as heat, which can be utilized for maintain the temperature of system. For CH4 synthesis from CO2 and steam, ΔrG° of 1.02 V is required at least as electricity, although ΔrH° is smaller than ΔrG°.
Note that these energies correspond to standard conditions. At an arbitrary temperature, the TΔrS° depends on the temperature, and the thermodynamic requirements are different from those under the standard conditions.21 However, ΔrH depends little on temperature and the direct synthesis of CH4 with a thermally-balanced potential has clear advantages over water electrolysis to produce H2.21
This advantage of small cell voltage is just theoretical but has not been confirmed experimentally in this work, as explained in Section 3.3. However, there is no reason why this method is thermodynamically disadvantageous. Moreover, direct CH4 synthesis with electrolysis in a cell has another advantage of absence of H2 storage over combination of separated water electrolysis and methanation of CO2.
4. Conclusions
CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O was investigated using phosphate-based electrochemical cells with three types of Ru catalysts. Ru/ZrO2 converted most of the CO2 to CH4 and was found to be a suitable catalyst for this system. The CE for CH4 formation was close to 100%, and the sub-product of H2 was detected with a CE of 1–3%. The cell voltage was ca. 2.8 V when operated at 10 mA cm−2, and a decrease in the relatively high voltage was considered a barrier to increasing the energy efficiency. The cell was operated for more than 5 days without significant problems. The PTFE membrane filter cell was examined in a similar manner to the H-permeable membrane (Pd–Ag) cathode cell. The properties of CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O were comparable for both cells, indicating that the use of H-permeable membranes is not necessary for this reaction. The reaction is expected to have higher feasibility without the need for precious Pd–Ag materials. The metal support interaction of the oxide-supported Ru catalysts was considered to determine the activity of the Ru catalysts in the present cell. The present electrochemical cell is a composite of electrolyzer and a catalyst layer at a constant temperature that is easily started and stopped and is capable fluctuating operation without any H2 storage.
