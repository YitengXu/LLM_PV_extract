    , Accepted 29th November 2015First published on 30th November 2015AbstractIn this work, a self-powered photodetector device is fabricated through the integration of a palladium-doped molybdenum disulfide thin film on silicon (Pd-MoS2/Si). The substitution of host Mo atoms with Pd dopants in the MoS2 film is revealed by structural and chemical analysis techniques. Due to the incorporation of Pd atoms into the MoS2 films, the photovoltaic characteristics of the fabricated Pd-MoS2/Si device were enhanced largely, promoting its application as a self-powered photodetector operated at zero bias voltage. The obtained results further show that the device is highly sensitive to broadband wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared light (300–1100 nm). In particular, the Pd-MoS2/Si photodetector shows an ultra-high detectivity of ∼1014 Jones (Jones = cm Hz1/2 W−1), a responsivity of ∼654.0 mA W−1, and an ultrafast response speed of ∼2.1 μs. The present work opens new avenues for developing high-performance photodetectors for optical communications and imaging techniques as well as optoelectronic circuits.
Introduction
Due to the low energy consumption, safe operation and simplifying design of driving circuits, self-powered photodetectors based on Schottky junctions or p–n junctions have attracted much attention in many fields, such as optical communications and imaging.1 These photodetectors are driven by a built-in electrical field at the junction interface and they can work under zero bias voltage due to their photovoltaic behaviors. To date, great progress has been made in fabricating self-powered photodetectors. Various kinds of nanostructures have been applied in this area, such as CdSe nanobelts, TiO2 films, CdS nanoribbons, and ZnO nanorods.2 However, the results from these devices show that the range of detectable light wavelengths is generally limited to the narrow range of the ultraviolet or visible light, the detectivity is very low (107–1010 Jones) (Jones = cm Hz1/2 W−1), and the response speed is relatively slow (60–300 μs). It is therefore still a significant challenge to fabricate simple nanoscale devices toward self-powered broadband detectors with high detectivity and fast response speeds under weak light conditions, which will promote remarkably their applications in future nano-optoelectronic integrated circuits.
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has become one of the hottest research topics due to its good electrical, mechanical, optical, magnetic and electrochemical properties.3 As a typical kind of layered transition metal dichalcogenide, MoS2 is a stack of planes where covalently bonded S–Mo–S atoms in layers are closely packed in a hexagonal arrangement. The adjacent planes are held together by van der Waals interactions. It is reported that MoS2 shows one order of magnitude higher sunlight absorption than the most commonly used sunlight absorbers Si and GaAs.4 Thus, MoS2-based materials have been used to develop various optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors and solar cells.5,6 Usually, junction-type configurations are constructed for MoS2 as the active material in practical optoelectronic device applications. Similar to traditional semiconductor technologies, stable n- and p-type conduction in MoS2 is indispensable in these devices. Native MoS2 is an n-type semiconductor owing to the presence of sulfur vacancies. The semiconductor characteristics of n-type MoS2 can be modulated by several techniques, such as metal work-function engineering,7 surface functionalization,8 and charge transfer from absorbed volatile molecules.9 However, it is still difficult to obtain stable p-type doping in MoS2 due to its native electron concentration, despite the suggestion that p-type operation is more desirable for MoS2-based field-effect transistor devices.10 p-Type MoS2 was obtained via a plasma-assisted doping approach by Wi et al.,11 while Suh et al. demonstrated stable p-type conduction in MoS2 by substitutional niobium doping.12 Using these techniques, homojunctions composed of vertically stacked MoS2 monolayers were fabricated. However, these devices usually suffer poor optoelectronic performance. For example, low power-conversion efficiencies (only ∼2.8%) resulted due to its weak absorption to light, and the narrow detectable wavelength range. Comparatively, the formation of heterojunctions by combining MoS2 with other semiconductors supplies a feasible route to construct high-performance optoelectronic devices by harnessing the advantages of both materials. Presently, silicon (Si) is dominating the commercial electronic device market due to its high abundance and mature processing technology. In order to develop practically applicable optoelectronic devices, it is of great value to realize the integration of MoS2 onto Si. It should be further addressed that MoS2 is fully compatible with Si fabrication technology.13 So far, extensive efforts have been devoted to MoS2/Si optoelectronic devices. For example, Esmaeili-Rad et al. reported the fabrication of photodetectors composed of MoS2 films and amorphous Si (a-Si).14 Despite the high responsivity of 210 mA W−1, the device exhibited a slow response speed of 0.3 ms due to large quantities of structural defects in a-Si, especially large external voltages are necessary to supply the work power for the device. To improve the photoelectrical properties of the devices, single-crystal Si (sc-Si) has been used as a substrate to grow MoS2 thin layers and MoS2/sc-Si n–p heterojunctions were realized by Tsai et al.15 The device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 5.23%. Furthermore, using a MoS2 thin film as an effective electron-blocking/hole-transporting layer, a high photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 11.1% was achieved in a graphene/MoS2/Si solar cell.16 This supplies the possibility for MoS2/Si to work without any external bias voltage as a photodetector.
In this work, palladium-doped MoS2 (Pd-MoS2) thin films were deposited onto Si substrates using the dc magnetron sputtering technique. The substitution of host Mo atoms with Pd dopants in the MoS2 film was confirmed by structural and chemical analysis techniques and the p-type nature of the film resulted. Due to the substitutional incorporation of Pd atoms into the MoS2 films, a large enhancement of the photovoltaic characteristics was achieved in the Pd-MoS2/Si p–n junction device, enabling its applications as a self-powered photodetector operated at zero bias voltage. The MoS2/Si photodetectors showed excellent properties in terms of wide detection range, as well as high detectivity and high responsivity, and ultrafast response speed.
Experimental section
Pd-MoS2 thin films were deposited on (100)-oriented Si substrates using the dc magnetron sputtering technique. Pd powders and MoS2 powders (purity, 99.9%) with an atomic ratio of 1:99 were firstly ball milled for 2 h and then the mixture was cold-pressed into a disk as the target during sputtering under 20 MPa. The Si substrates used in this work are n-type semiconductors with a resistivity of 3.2–6.8 Ω cm. Before deposition, the substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in sequence with alcohol, acetone, and de-ionized water. Then, the substrates were dipped into HF solution (∼5.0%) for 60.0 s to remove the natural oxide layer from the Si surface. After that, oxidation treatment of the substrates was performed in peroxide solution (∼40.0%) at 100 °C for 20.0 min to form a ∼3.0 nm-thickness SiO2 passivation layer on the Si surface. Subsequently, ∼30 nm-thickness MoS2 thin films were deposited. During the deposition, the working pressure of argon gas and deposition temperature were 5.0 Pa and 400.0 °C, respectively. Finally, the top ∼40 nm-thickness Pd electrode layer was fabricated on the Pd-MoS2 film using the dc magnetron sputtering technique. The whole top surface of the film was covered by the electrode layer. The back ∼500 nm-thickness indium (In) electrode was covered on the whole backside of the Si substrate using thermal evaporation. As a reference, pure MoS2 films without Pd doping were also deposited under the same growth conditions.
Samples were characterized using Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw, 514 nm laser). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the sample were performed on a Bede D1 X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Surface morphologies were studied using an atomic force microscope (AFM, SPM-300HV, SEIKO). X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Kratos Axis ULTRA spectrometer using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The transmission spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrophotometer. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were made using an unfiltered He–I (21.22 eV) gas discharge lamp. The I–V curves were measured using two-point measurement by a Keithley2400 source meter at RT. To obtain the sensitivity of the device, a Xe lamp with tuneable output power combined with double monochromators (7ISW302 and 7ISW304, Sofn Instruments Co., Ltd, China) was used to produce monochromatic light from 200 to 2500 nm. The response speed of the photodetector was evaluated by combining a pulse laser of 980 nm (SCT-DSL, Shaanxi Scitower Photoelectricity Equipment Co., Ltd, China) and a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 2012C).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the Raman spectra of the as-grown MoS2 film (bottom) and Pd-MoS2 (top) film on Si substrates. As shown in the figure, the MoS2 film exhibits two characteristic Raman peaks, the E12g mode at ∼376 cm−1 and the A1g mode at ∼410 cm−1. These results are consistent with other reported results.17 The E12g mode corresponds to the S and Mo atoms oscillating in the antiphase parallel to the crystal plane and the A1g mode corresponds to the S atoms oscillating in the antiphase out-of-plane, as shown in the insets. From the figure, an obvious red shift of about 6.0 cm−1 of the A1g peak can be observed due to the incorporation of Pd atoms in the film, while the position of the E12g peak almost has no change. As a result, the separation (Δ) between the E12g and A1g peaks decreases from 34.0 cm−1 for the MoS2 film to 28.0 cm−1 for the Pd-MoS2 film. In MoS2-based materials, A1g phonons couple much more tightly with electrons than E12g phonons.8 Hence, this demonstrates that a significant change in the electronic structure and semiconductor characteristics of the film can be caused by Pd doping. Additionally, both the separations are much larger than those for the reported monolayer and several-layer MoS2.18Fig. 1b shows the XRD pattern of the MoS2 thin films. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed to MoS2 with a hexagonal phase. Obvious diffraction peaks of the film at 33.9° and 69.1° corresponding to (100) and (200) can be observed from the figure. This demonstrates that the deposited MoS2 film on the Si substrate in our work has preferential [100] orientation. In other words, S–Mo–S unit layers in the film are aligned perpendicular to the substrate. This is completely different from the results for the monolayer MoS2 prepared by the conventional chemical vapour deposition method. According to other reports,19 the monolayer MoS2 is usually lying on the substrate with (001) planes parallel to the substrate surface. The unique vertically-standing structure would open up exciting opportunities for various electronic and optoelectronic devices, complementary to the recent MoS2-based devices with horizontal atomic layers. Fig. 1c shows an AFM topographic image of the Pd-MoS2 thin film grown on the Si substrate. As shown in the figure, the rough surface is evident. According to the measurements, the root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of the film is about 1.1 nm, and the average size of grains is ∼30.4 nm in diameter.

Fig. 2a shows the typical XPS spectrum of the Pd-MoS2 film, illustrating the presence of Pd, Mo and S coexisted in the film. Additionally, the presence of C and O elements can be observed from the spectrum. This might be caused by the absorbed gaseous molecules. Fig. 2b provides the binding energies of the Pd element in the Pd-MoS2 film. Two peaks at 337.6 eV and 342.9 eV are assigned to Pd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. The binding energies are much larger than those for Pd metal20 and almost the same as the characteristics of Pd4+.21 This reveals that the substitution of Mo atoms with Pd dopants is realized successfully and the Pd atoms are stabilized by covalent bonding inside the lattice. A typical high resolution XPS spectrum of Mo 3d and S 2p is shown in Fig. 2c and d. The light gray curves show comparatively the binding energies of Mo and S for the MoS2 film without Pd doping. The peaks at 229.1 and 232.1 eV are assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 orbitals, respectively. As shown in the figure, the core-level peaks of Mo in the Pd-MoS2 show a uniform shift toward lower binding energies compared to those of the undoped MoS2 film. This shift can be attributed to the lowering of the Fermi level (EF) upon the p-type doping, as similarly observed in previous studies.22 According to the calculation, the amount of the shift of the binding energy is about 0.59 eV. The S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 appear at 163.5 and 162.2 eV, respectively, and there is almost no obvious difference in the binding energies between the films with and without Pd doping.

Fig. 3a shows the I–V characteristics of the MoS2/Si and Pd-MoS2/Si devices under dark conditions. Here, the forward voltages are defined as the positive voltages applied to the Pd top electrode. From the figure, obvious rectifying characteristics for both devices can be observed. The rectification ratio (I+/I−) at ±1.0 V reaches 102 orders of magnitude for the devices. In our studies, both the Pd/MoS2 and In/Si contacts are ohmic (ESI,† Fig. S1). Thus, the rectifying characteristics in the device can be mainly attributed to the Pd-MoS2 (MoS2)/Si junction. Compared to the MoS2/Si, the Pd-MoS2/Si device shows a large increase of the current in the forward voltage range. The series resistance (Rs) of the devices can be deduced from the slope of the d(V)/d(ln(I)) versus I plot in a large I region.23 According to the fitted results, the Rs decreases from 56.7 Ω for the MoS2/Si to 14.1 Ω for the Pd-MoS2/Si, as shown in the inset. The enhancement of the conduction of the Pd-MoS2 film along the out-of-plane orientation might be the only reason for the decrease of the series resistance. It demonstrates that the transportation of carriers in the film can be greatly facilitated by Pd doping. This is also helpful for the transportation of the photoexcited carriers in the film, enhancing the photosensitivity of the device. The I–V curves of the devices under 30.0 mW cm−2 white-light illumination are shown in Fig. 3b. Obvious photovoltaic characteristics for all the devices can be observed. According to our measurements, the MoS2/Si device has a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 4.7 mA, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.28 V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.7%. When the Pd atoms are incorporated into the MoS2 film, the photovoltaic characteristics are enhanced largely, as shown in the figure. For the Pd-MoS2/Si solar cell, Voc and Jsc of the device increase to 0.39 V and 9.3 mA cm−2, respectively. The overall PCE reaches 4.6%, up to a six-fold increase compared to the referenced device. These excellent photovoltaic properties can promise the applications of the Pd-MoS2/Si device as self-powered photodetectors operated at zero bias voltage. Fig. 3c shows the corresponding incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of the devices. As shown in the figure, the IPCE values of the Pd-MoS2/Si device are much larger than those for the MoS2/Si and Si solar cells over the full wavelength range, 300–1100 nm. This further demonstrates that Pd-MoS2/Si has higher efficiencies in carrier collection. Fig. 3d shows the photoresponse of the Pd-MoS2/Si device under zero bias and a small forward bias (+0.3 V) under light illumination. Five cycles of switching the light on and off show good stability and repeatability of the photoresponse of the device. When the light-on and light-off conditions are switched alternately, two distinct photovoltage states for the device are shown, the “low” state in the dark and the “high” state in light. Both the steep rise and fall edges indicate that the photoexcited carriers can be separated rapidly. Moreover, the device shows a binary response under a smaller forward bias than Voc. It is well known that the signal–noise ratio is the main factor to limit the accuracy of the photodetector under the relatively weak light signal. The binary response is an effective way to remove the negative effect of the noise signal.24 From the figure, the direction of the current at +0.3 V can be observed to alternate between positive and negative when the light is switched on and off. This phenomenon offers the opportunity to use the device as an on–off binary response device for reliable and stable detection of weak light signals.

Fig. 4a shows the transmission spectrum of the Pd-MoS2 film deposited on a glass (a-SiO2) substrate using the same growth conditions as those on Si. As shown in the figure, the transmittance of the film decreases upon decreasing the wavelength from the near-infrared region to the ultraviolet region (1100–300 nm). Using the data from the transmittance spectrum, (αhν)2 is plotted as a function of photon energy hν, wherein h is the Planck constant and ν is the photon frequency. The α is the absorption coefficient, calculated by αd = ln(1/T), d and T are the thickness and transmittance of the film, respectively.25 The band gap (Eg) of the film can be determined from the intercept of the line on the hν axis, Eg = 1.35 eV. The energy-band value for the film is a little larger than MoS2 bulk (∼1.2 eV) and much smaller than the monolayer (∼1.9 eV). Fig. 4b shows the UPS spectrum of the MoS2 film on the Si substrate. The work function (W) of the film can be calculated from the difference between the cutoff of the highest binding energy and the photon energy of the exciting radiation. From the figure, W = 4.68 eV can be obtained. Since the Fermi level (EF) of MoS2 exists between the conduction band (EC) and the valence band (EV), the distance (ΔE) between EV and EF of MoS2 film can be extracted from the onset energy, as shown in Fig. 4c. The ΔE for Pd-MoS2 is determined to be 0.45 eV. According to these energy-band parameters, the p-type behavior of the Pd-MoS2 film can be proved, while the as-deposited MoS2 film without Pd doping shows an n-type nature determined by UPS analysis (ESI,† Fig. S2). According to the Periodic Table of Elements, the electronegativity of Pd is 2.20 while it is 2.16 for Mo. The p-type nature of the Pd-MoS2 film might be caused by the stronger electronegativity of Pd than Mo. The larger electronegativity of the Pd atoms makes it more difficult for S to receive electrons from Pd. This can cause large quantities of vacancies in the MoS2 film and the native electron carriers can be compensated. As a result, p-type characteristics are exhibited in the Pd-MoS2 films. The Fermi level of n-type Si is 4.21 eV, and its electron affinity (χ) and band gap are respectively 4.05 eV and 1.12 eV.26 Based on the above results, the isolated energy-band diagrams of the Pd-MoS2/Si are constructed, as shown in Fig. 4d. When the Pd-MoS2 film is deposited onto the Si substrate, the electrons flow from Si into Pd-MoS2 at the interface due to the lower Fermi energy level of the Pd-MoS2. The flowing process stops when the Fermi levels are equal and a Pd-MoS2/Si p–n junction is fabricated, as shown in Fig. 4e. Consequently, a built-in electrical field (Ebi) is formed near the interface and its direction points from the substrate to the film. Under light illumination, the incident photons generate electron–hole (e–h) pairs in the Pd-MoS2 film and the Si. The built-in electric field can effectively facilitate the separation of photo-generated e–h pairs, transporting separated electrons from Pd-MoS2 to Si and holes towards Si. The processes of photo-excitation and carrier transport in the Pd-MoS2/Si p–n junction are demonstrated in the figure. Therefore, obvious photovoltaic characteristics result in the p–n junction. As it is well known, the Voc depends on the built-in field near the interface.27 Due to the Pd doping in the MoS2 film, the Ebi near the interface can be enhanced with the shift of the Fermi level of the film towards the EV. Thus, the Pd-MoS2/Si device shows a larger Voc of 0.39 V compared to the device without Pd doping. This photovoltaic effect enables the device to sense the light illumination without any external energy supply. As shown in Fig. 4d, when a small forward electrical field (Eex) is applied to the device, a positive current in the circuit can be caused under dark conditions. However, under light illumination, the photoinduced electromotive force is in the reverse direction to the Eex. Therefore, an on–off binary response with a current change from positive to negative can be observed from Fig. 3d.

Fig. 5a shows the sensitivity of the Pd-MoS2/Si photodetector as a function of wavelength. The sensitivity is defined as the value of Ip/Id, where Ip and Id represent the photocurrent and dark current, respectively. Here the normalization of the sensitivity of the device is used. From the figure, an obvious photoresponse can be observed in a wide wavelength range from the ultraviolet to near-infrared area (300–1100 nm). The highest sensitivity of the device is located at around 950 nm and the real sensitivity reaches 3.1 × 105. The photon energy from 950 nm-wavelength light is consistent with the band gap of the Pd-MoS2 film from the UPS results in Fig. 4a. This well demonstrates that the photoresponse of the device is dominated mainly by the Pd-MoS2 film. Fig. 5b shows the I–V characteristics of the devices under 980 nm laser illumination with different light intensities from 1.0 mW cm−2 to 30.0 mW cm−2. From the figure, we can see that both the photocurrent and photovoltage have a strong dependence on the incident light intensity and increase with increasing light intensity. Fig. 5c shows the photocurrent of the Pd-MoS2/Si at zero bias as a function of light intensity. The dependency curve can be well fitted with a power law:28 Ip ∝ Pθ(1)In eqn (1), Ip is the photocurrent, θ is the proportionality constant and P represents the light intensity. θ = 0.86 can be obtained from the linear fitting. This value is close to the theoretical value of 1.0, implying the low trap density in the film.29 The inset shows that the photovoltage of the device increases rapidly from 0.31 V to 0.42 V when the light intensity changes from 1.0 to 20.0 mW cm−2. However, a further increase of the light intensity leads to the saturation of the photovoltage. To evaluate the detection performance of the Pd-MoS2/Si photodetector, the photoresponsivity (R) and the photodetectivity (D*) are further calculated. The photoresponsivity can be described using the following equation:30 R = Ip/Pin(2) In eqn (2), Ip and Pin are the photocurrent and incidence light power, respectively. A high value of R means that a high photocurrent is generated per unit power of the incident light on the effective area. D* is an important factor that reflects the ability for detecting a weak light signal from the noise environment. D* can be calculated from the following expression:31 D* = R/(2qJd)1/2(3) In eqn (3), Jd is the dark current density (only ∼3.0 × 10−5 mA cm−2 in this work). Eqn (3) suggests that D* is determined by the dark current and the photoresponsivity to a large extent. Fig. 5d shows the R and D* of the MoS2/Si heterojunction under zero bias voltage as a function of incident light intensity. According to the calculated results, a high photoresponsivity and detectivity of about 371.0 mA W−1 and 5.6 × 1013 Jones can be obtained under the light intensity of 30.0 mW cm−2. This is one order of magnitude larger than other results for the MoS2-based photodetector.32 As shown in the figure, both R and D* increase with decreasing power intensity. Under a light intensity of 1.0 mW cm−2, R increases to 654.0 mA W−1, especially D* reaches 1.0 × 1014 Jones which is much larger than the value for commercially available Si photodetectors (≤1013 Jones).33

The response speed for a photodetector is also crucial in practical applications. Fig. 6a shows a schematic illustration of the setup for measuring the response time of the Pd-MoS2/Si device. The response and recovery time of the photodetector are measured using an oscilloscope and a 980 nm-wavelength pulsed laser source with adjustable frequencies from 0 to 8000 Hz. The test was carried out under zero applied field. Fig. 6b shows the photoresponse of the Pd-MoS2/Si self-powered photodetector under light switching frequencies of 2000 Hz and 50 Hz, respectively. As shown in the figure, the response is fast and shows excellent stability and repeatability. The relative balance of the photovoltage signals at different laser frequencies, (Vmax–Vmin)/Vmax, is calculated. Fig. 6c shows the plot of the relative balance versus laser frequency. As shown in the figure, the value of the relative balance only decreases by 15% when the laser frequency increases from 1 Hz to 2000 Hz, implying that the Pd-MoS2/Si self-powered photodetector can work well in a wide switching frequency range. Fig. 6d shows a single normalized modulation cycle measured at 2000 Hz. The response time (tres) is the time interval for the response to rise from 10% to 90% of its peak value. The recovery time (trec) is the time interval for the recovery to decay from 90% to 10% of its peak value. The device shows a fast response speed with tres = 2.1 μs. This value is among the best reported results for self-powered photodetectors.2,5,32,34 Comparatively, longer time is exhausted for the recovery, trec = 173.8 μs. The asymmetric relationship between the response and recovery speeds is a familiar phenomenon for photodetectors due to the existence of the trap states in the film or near the interface.35 The recovery speed would be improved greatly by further decreasing the defects in the film and at the interface.

The high performance of the fabricated Pd-MoS2/Si photodetector could be mainly attributed to the incorporation of the Pd dopant in the MoS2 film based on the following aspects: (i) a strong built-in electrical field at the Pd-MoS2/Si interface is formed due to the shift of the Fermi level caused by the Pd doping, which can greatly facilitate the separation of photo-generated carriers, leading to a high photo-induced current and high photoresponse in the device. (ii) The transportation of the photoexcited carriers in the film can be facilitated by the Pd doping in the film and a high response speed can be obtained, as demonstrated in Fig. 3a and b. (iii) Additionally, due to the high in-plane mobility of the MoS2 layer, the unique vertically standing layered structure for the MoS2 film could offer high-speed paths for the transportation of photoexcited carriers along the out-of-plane orientation. This might be also responsible for the large photocurrent and high response speed.
Conclusion
In summary, Pd-MoS2 thin films were deposited onto Si substrates using the magnetron sputtering technique. Structural and chemical analysis shows that the Pd dopants were incorporated into the film by the replacement of host Mo atoms. This resulted in the p-type nature of the film. A Pd-MoS2/Si photodetector was fabricated based on the p–n junction structure. Due to the incorporation of Pd atoms into the MoS2 films, the photovoltaic characteristics of the Pd-MoS2/Si device were enhanced greatly, enabling its application as a self-powered photodetector. Under zero bias voltage, the Pd-MoS2/Si device exhibited high photoresponse in a wide wavelength, from the ultraviolet to near-infrared light. Under the laser illumination of 980 nm, the Pd-MoS2/Si photodetector shows an ultra-high detectivity of ∼1014 Jones, a responsivity of ∼654.0 mA W−1, and an ultrafast response speed of ∼2.1 μs. These device performances are significantly better than those for commercially available photodetectors. The presented Pd-MoS2/Si devices hold great promise in developing high-performance photodetectors.
