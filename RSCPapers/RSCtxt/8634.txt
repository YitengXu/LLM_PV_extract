    , Accepted 14th October 2021First published on 14th October 2021AbstractThe development of atmospheric water generators depends critically on the preparation of hygroscopic materials. In our systematic efforts toward producing porous frameworks for effective humidity reduction, a super hygroscopic material, which was composed of hetero-layered 2D (two-dimensional) metal–organic framework nanosheet composites, has been established. The effective hetero-layered interactions have endowed the material with the functionalities of simultaneous humidity capture and in situ liquefaction, reaching an unprecedented value of water adsorption of over 658% (highest) of its own weight under ambient atmospheric and room-temperature conditions. Outdoor experiments have suggested that the fast water release is triggered by natural sunlight. Compared with classical hygroscopic salts that require plenty of energy input for water release, the present work has provided a promising strategy for developing next-generation hygroscopic materials for humidity-related management and advanced atmospheric water generator systems.

Environmental significance
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is a promising method for obtaining sources of fresh water. To achieve practical AWH, the key challenge is the development of suitable adsorbents. Considering that current hygroscopic materials suffer from the drawbacks of having energy-intensive requirements for regeneration, the design of new hygroscopic materials with high water adsorption capacities and low energy inputs for water release is of significant importance. In this work, a super hygroscopic material, which was prepared via the in situ exfoliation of hetero-layered MOFs, can be applied as an ideal hygroscopic material for practical energy-free AWH under natural conditions, as this material is capable of adsorbing atmospheric water at over 658% of its own weight, accompanied by a dramatic color change, and the desorption of the adsorbed water can be triggered by natural sunlight. These indices are the best among reported hygroscopic materials. This work is expected to provide a promising strategy for developing novel hygroscopic materials for humidity-related management and advanced AWH systems.

Introduction
The ambient environment is a huge treasure with various energy sources (such as solar energy, thermal energy, air flow, atmospheric humidity, etc.) that can be tamed to meet human energy demands for the development of a sustainable society. Enormous efforts have been made and significant technology has been developed for the conversion of sources such as solar radiation, mechanical movements, electromagnetic radiation, and so on, to useful physical forms, electrical energies and physical signals, for various promising practical applications.1–4 However, atmospheric humidity, which has been viewed as a potential free source of freshwater, is a rather overlooked ambient source because of its annoying attributes, and, in most cases, additional energy must be consumed to reduce the levels of it, to provide a comfortable living space for humans.5–7 Upon considering that the earth's atmospheric humidity is estimated to equal 10% of the total volume of all fresh water lakes (13000 trillion liters),8 efficient atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) could be a promising available source of freshwater.
To achieve practical AWH, the key challenge is the development of suitable hygroscopic materials. Ideally, a desired hygroscopic material should possess the merits of high water stability and tailorable hydrophilicity, enabling it to take up and release water with minimum energy consumption.9–13 Much effort has been made on the design, preparation, and modification of such materials,14–23 and some of them have shown excellent water adsorption properties and potential for practical applications.24–27 However, most of these reported hygroscopic materials have suffered the drawbacks of either low water uptake capacity, high energy consumption for regeneration, or complex engineering for materials manufacturing.28–33 In this case, the search for new hygroscopic materials with high water adsorption capacity and low energy input for water release is of significant importance (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  An illustration of the fabrication process of hygroscopic materials. 
Two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a versatile nano-platform for real-world applications in various surface-active related fields.34–37 In our group, by using facile ultrasonic force-assisted liquid exfoliation methods, single-layered 2D nanosheets of [Co(NCS)2(pyz)2] (pyz = pyrazine) have been obtained. By employing their highly sensitive surfaces and excellent surface adsorption ability, a portable, economical, and in situ visual test strategy38 and a high-performance environmental remediation strategy39 have been developed. Note that, on the one hand, the larger surface area, the excellent surface adsorption ability, and the high polarity of the pyrazine linker and NCS ligand all endow the 2D nanosheets of [Co(NCS)2(pyz)2] with a high affinity to water molecules and potential AWH applications. On the other hand, birnessite,40,41 a well-known 2D material, has been successfully used for practical water harvesting, owing to its quick adsorption of water molecules into the interlayers and the formation of multilayer water–water interactions on the 2D surfaces. We then focussed our investigations on the fabrication of super hygroscopic materials using 2D nanosheets of [Co(NCS)2(pyz)2]. As we expected, via plenty of screening, we found that the in situ exfoliation of [Co(NCS)2(pyz)2] with its isomorphic species [Zn(NCS)2(pyz)2] gave birth to a hybridized nano composite 2D-Co/2D-Zn (2D-Co and 2D-Zn represent the 2D nanosheets of [Co(NCS)2(pyz)2] and [Zn(NCS)2(pyz)2], respectively) that can be used as a super hygroscopic material. 2D-Co/2D-Zn was atomically thin in nature, and showed a clear Tyndall effect in colloidal suspension and a loose-flocculent morphology in the solid state. These features endowed 2D-Co/2D-Zn with a high affinity to humidity, and made it capable of adsorbing atmospheric water at over 658% (highest) of its own weight, under ambient conditions, much higher than the values of the individual 2D-Co (462%) and 2D-Zn (438%). More importantly, under outdoor conditions, 95% of the adsorbed water can be released within 30 min, upon natural sunlight irradiation, suggesting the practical potential of natural sunlight triggered AWH, and providing a promising strategy for developing next-generation hygroscopic materials.
Results and discussion
The isomorphic 2D MOFs [Co(NCS)2(pyz)2] and [Zn(NCS)2(pyz)2] (Fig. 1a and S1†) were prepared according to our previous work.38 The centre metal ions are coordinated by four equatorial pyz ligands and two trans axial NCS ligands, providing a square-like 2D layer structure (Fig. 1b top), with NCS groups orderly arrayed on both sides of the layers (Fig. 1b bottom). Note that charge distribution calculations and zeta potential measurements have suggested this kind of structure with a strong electronegativity of 132.92 mV (Fig. 1c); as a consequence, the high affinity to water molecules of these 2D sheets deserves to be investigated. By using ultrasonic force-assisted liquid exfoliation technology in ethanolic solutions, atomically thin (as demonstrated by atom force microscopy (AFM) measurements, Fig. S2†) 2D nanosheets of both MOFs (named 2D-Co and 2D-Zn) can be obtained respectively, providing a clear colloidal suspension with a significant Tyndall effect (Fig. 1d and S3†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the similar 2D morphologies of 2D-Co and 2D-Zn (Fig. 1e and f), however different colours of the solid-state samples can be observed, green- for 2D-Co (Fig. 1e insert) and white for 2D-Zn (Fig. 1f insert). Interestingly, upon in situ exfoliation of both MOFs, the resulting hybridized species 2D-Co/2D-Zn can also be well dispersed in ethanol solution to give a colloidal suspension with a significant Tyndall effect (Fig. 1g), suggesting its atomically thin nature, as confirmed by AFM measurements (Fig. S4†). However, both TEM (Fig. 1h) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. 1i) demonstrated its fluffy and disordered nature, which can be attributed to the disordered stacking of hetero 2D nanosheets upon solvent removal, and this was expected to promote the complete exposure of the surface area of the 2D sheets for water adsorption. One thing that should be stressed is that 2D-Co/2D-Zn shows a completely blue colour (Fig. 1h insert), which can be attributed to the effective hetero-layered interactions between 2D-Co and 2D-Zn.

For all TEM images, the insets are photos of the corresponding solid-state samples. 
To verify the above-mentioned effective hetero-layered interactions, PXRD and spectrum measurements were performed. For both MOFs, the layer structures are stretched along the (001) crystal plane and stacked along the (110) crystal plane (Fig. 2a). For 2D-Co, the (110) crystal plane disappeared while the (011) crystal plane was preserved well in the PXRD pattern (Fig. 2b), suggesting that the bulk species was exfoliated to the single-layer limit in solution, which were further stacked into crystalline species upon solvent removal. Regarding 2D-Zn, both the (110) and (011) crystal planes were preserved, accompanied by the formation of many new crystal planes (Fig. 2c). These results suggested that, under the same exfoliation conditions, the Zn-based bulk species cannot be exfoliated to the single-layer limit. However, upon in situ exfoliation with the Co-based MOFs, the Zn-based MOFs can be exfoliated to the single-layer limit, as no (110) crystal plane can be observed in the PXRD pattern of 2D-Co/2D-Zn, only the (011) crystal plane is present (Fig. 2d). This phenomenon can be interpreted as follows: upon in situ exfoliation, the first-generated single-layered nanosheets of 2D-Co insert into the interlayers of the Zn-based bulk species, which exfoliates the Zn-based bulk species to the single-layer limit. As a consequence, the hetero-layers of 2D-Co and 2D-Zn hybridized uniformly with each other at the single-layer scale, into a fluffy and disordered state (Fig. 2d). This conclusion was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), whereby the uniform distribution of Co and Zn elements, with a molar ratio of about 3:1, was observed (Fig. 2e and S5†). Furthermore, the UV-vis absorption spectra revealed an increase in metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) (centre at 293 nm) and a decrease in the π⋯π* (pyz) transition (centre at 260 nm) in 2D-Co/2D-Zn, when compared with the individual 2D-Co and 2D-Zn (Fig. 2f), strongly suggesting effective hetero-layered interactions.

Upon exposure to an ambient atmosphere (with a relative humidity (RH) of about 90%), the powdered samples of 2D-Co/2D-Zn changed into a water drop within 30 minutes (Fig. 2g), corresponding to a water adsorption capacity of over 81.5% of their own weight (Fig. 2h). When increasing the exposure time to 300 min, the blue-coloured water drop turned into a big brown-coloured drop, with an adsorption capacity of about 483%. Finally, the brown-coloured drop grew into a bigger red-coloured drop with an exposure time of about 720 min. The corresponding highest adsorption capacity was calculated to be 658%, a value that is the highest among the reported hygroscopic materials (Fig. S6†). This phenomenon can be attributed to the effective hetero-layered interactions, which created a loose interlayer space for water molecule adsorption and storage. With the continuous water adsorption, the multilayer water–water interactions on the 2D surfaces, as well as the interactions involving water molecules, the pyrazine linker and NCS ligand, all increased in strength, which then had a significant influence on the electronic state of the centre metal ions and led to the colour change, as well as the ultimate liquefaction of the water molecules. Note that Fig. 2h suggests two different adsorption mechanisms: the mechanism occurring in the first two hours can be attributed to interactions involving water molecules, the pyrazine linker and NCS ligand; after that, the formation of multilayer water–water interactions on the 2D surfaces dominated. To further confirm the super hygroscopic nature of 2D-Co/2D-Zn, low-pressure water sorption isotherms at 25 °C were recorded, and quasi-S shaped water isotherms (Fig. 2i), with a step adsorption profile and adsorption capacity of about 1380 mg g−1, were observed (Fig. S7†), suggesting that high water uptake and release processes through relatively small temperature gradients can be achieved with 2D-Co/2D-Zn.41 As expected, upon heating at 40 °C in an oven, 99% of the adsorbed water can be released within 25 min (Fig. S8†), suggesting a fast water release with a low energy input.
The above-mentioned results demonstrate the high potential of 2D-Co/2D-Zn for practical AWH. Then, outdoor experiments were carried out. As shown in Fig. 3, powdered samples of 2D-Zn/2D-Co were spread on a glass tray (Fig. 3a) and exposed to moist air at 7 am (with a RH of about 80%); the blue-coloured powder changed into violet water drops within 1 h (Fig. 3b), which further swelled into bigger red-coloured water drops at 9:00 am (Fig. 3c) (with a RH of about 70%). After that, the AWH capacity was calculated to be 3.84 g g−1, with an average water capturing rate of 1.92 g g−1 h−1. Subsequently, the obtained drip-covered glass tray was put into a glass container and exposed to natural sunlight from 9:00 am (Fig. 3d); the adsorbed water was released continuously in the form of water vapor from 9:00 to 9:30 am, accompanied by an obvious colour change of 2D-Co/2D-Zn (Fig. 3e and f). The released water vapor encountered the inner walls of the glass container and condensed into water droplets via heat transfer (Fig. 3f and g). Note that the bigger red-coloured water drops changed into a blue-coloured cake at 9:30 (Fig. 3h) under natural sunlight. Importantly, the obtained blue-coloured cake further turned into red-coloured water drops upon exposure to moist air for 2 h (Fig. 3i), with no decline in AWH efficiency observed. In addition, the PXRD patterns (Fig. S8†) and IR spectra (Fig. S9†) all suggested that no obvious phase change occurred in the recycled 2D-Co/2D-Zn, despite a slight deviation that can be attributed to the caking of nanosheets after water release. One thing that should be stressed is that after repeating the above-mentioned adsorption-release process ten times, no obvious decline in AWH efficiency could be observed (Fig. S10†). Hence, a novel super hygroscopic material with practical AWH potential has been demonstrated.

Experimental
General considerations
All syntheses were performed under ambient conditions, and all of the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Co(NCS)2, pyz; ZnSO4·7H2O, NH4SCN, and all of the solvents were obtained commercially from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (China) and Beijing HWRK Chem Co., Ltd. (China).
Characterization
The morphologies of 2D-Co and 2D-Zn as well as 2D-Co/2D-Zn were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800 20 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Tecnai-G2 20 E-TWIN 200 kV). Before these microscopy characterization experiments, an ethanolic suspension of the nanosheets was added dropwise onto holey carbon-coated carbon support copper grids, Si/SiO2, and piranha-cleaned Si/SiO2 and then naturally dried. PXRD patterns were recorded on an Ultima IV diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the range of 5–80° at room temperature. Gas sorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 802020 surface area analyser. UV-vis absorption spectra of the colloidal suspensions were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3150 double-beam spectrophotometer. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IR Prestige-21 FTIR-8400S spectrometer in the spectral range of 4000–500 cm−1, with the samples in the form of potassium bromide pellets.
Preparation of the 2D MOFs
A methanol solution (12 mL) of pyrazine (0.405 g, 5.0 mmol) was added slowly into an aqueous solution (8 mL) of Co(NCS)2 (0.434 g, 2.5 mmol). After stirring for 1 h, pink solids, the bulk species of the 2D MOFs [Co(NCS)2(pyz)2], formed, which were washed with methanol and dried under vacuum.
A methanol solution (10 ml) of pyrazine (0.405 g, 5.0 mmol) was added slowly into an aqueous solution (10 ml) of ZnSO4·7H2O (1.438 g, 5.0 mmol). Then, a methanol solution (10 ml) of NH4SCN (0.381 g, 5.0 mmol) was added slowly to the above solution and stirred for 3 h. White solids, the bulk species of the 2D MOFs [Zn(NCS)2(pyz)2], formed, which were washed with methanol and dried under vacuum.
Preparation of the 2D MOF nanosheets
15 mg of the bulk species of the 2D MOFs was dispersed in 30 ml of ethanol solution. The obtained mixture was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Brandson, CPX2800H-E, 110 W, 40 kHz) for 30 minutes followed by stirring overnight. Afterwards, the colloidal suspension was left to stand for one week. The upper colloidal suspension was collected by centrifugation to remove the sedimentation of the bulk samples. Finally, the samples of 2D MOF nanosheets were collected by rotary evaporation at room temperature.
Preparation of 2D-Co/2D-Zn
2D-Co/2D-Zn was obtained by using the above-mentioned methods, except both 2D MOFs were added simultaneously.
Atmospheric water harvesting
Under ambient conditions, 2D-Co/2D-Zn was spread out on a glass coverslip and exposed to the atmosphere. The adsorption rates and adsorption capacities were investigated by weighing the adsorbed species on an electronic balance at set time intervals. The desorption process was carried out by using a halogen lamp (AM 1.5) or putting the water saturated samples in an oven with a temperature of 35–40 °C; the desorption rates were investigated by weighing the desorbed species on an electronic balance at set time intervals.
Outdoor atmospheric water harvesting
Outdoor AWH was performed in September 2020, on the lawn at the campus of Southeast University. Samples of 2D-Co/2D-Zn were spread out on a glass tray and exposed to moisture in the air from 7 am. The variation in phase state and water harvesting were record by a camera. At 9:00 am, the water harvesting process was suspended, the obtained drip-covered glass tray was then put into a glass container and exposed to sunlight, and the variation in phase state and vapor diffusion were record by a camera. At 9:30 am, the water release was finished. The recycling of 2D-Co/2D-Zn was performed by repeating the above-mentioned process on another day.
Conclusions
In summary, we present here a super hygroscopic material that was obtained via the in situ exfoliation of 2D nanosheets of hetero-layered MOFs. The effective hetero-layered interactions endow the hygroscopic nanomaterial with the simultaneous properties of humidity capture and in situ liquefaction, as well as fast water release triggered by natural sunlight. Considering the low cost (about 1.3 ¥ per g), good safety, and good hydrolysis stability of 2D-Co/2D-Zn, a promising, practical, and efficient energy-free AWH strategy under natural conditions has been demonstrated. Apart from AWH, the dramatic colour variation in response to water adsorption and release can be further expected to be applied in humidity response and monitoring applications. The present results shed light on the design of new hygroscopic nanomaterials for next-generation advanced AWH systems, and the integration of this super hygroscopic material into devices for practical AWH and humidity response applications is being carried out in our lab at present.

Environmental significance
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is a promising method for obtaining sources of fresh water. To achieve practical AWH, the key challenge is the development of suitable adsorbents. Considering that current hygroscopic materials suffer from the drawbacks of having energy-intensive requirements for regeneration, the design of new hygroscopic materials with high water adsorption capacities and low energy inputs for water release is of significant importance. In this work, a super hygroscopic material, which was prepared via the in situ exfoliation of hetero-layered MOFs, can be applied as an ideal hygroscopic material for practical energy-free AWH under natural conditions, as this material is capable of adsorbing atmospheric water at over 658% of its own weight, accompanied by a dramatic color change, and the desorption of the adsorbed water can be triggered by natural sunlight. These indices are the best among reported hygroscopic materials. This work is expected to provide a promising strategy for developing novel hygroscopic materials for humidity-related management and advanced AWH systems.
