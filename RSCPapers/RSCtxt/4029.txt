    , Accepted 30th June 2017First published on 30th June 2017AbstractTypical optoelectronic devices are transducers used to realize energy conversion between light and electric current. Optoelectronic devices have a wide variety of applications as diverse as e.g. light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic technology, photoconductive cells, laser diodes, photoemissive camera tubes, optocouplers etc. Their versatile utility necessitates a cost-efficient industrial-scale production. The last decade has witnessed a rapid development and great improvement in the efficiency of optoelectronic devices and revealed their evergrowing need in new organic semiconducting materials that are at the heart of such devices. This review article covers the electronic properties of silole-based organic semiconductors including tetraarylsilole, spirosilole, fused silole molecules and polymers, recently applied in OLEDs and OPVs, and their optoelectronic device performances. And an outlook on the future investigations of silole-based materials is offered.
1 Introduction
Optoelectronic devices deal with the technology of optics and electronics. Such devices include light emitting diodes (LEDs),1 light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs),2 field-effect transistors (FETs),3 and photovoltaic cells (i.e. solar cells) etc.4 Typical optoelectronic devices can be divided into light sensitive devices (e.g. organic photovoltaic cells, OPVs) and light generating devices (e.g. organic light emitting diodes, OLEDs). Compared to inorganic materials used in optoelectronic devices, organic semiconductors hold fascinating promise owing to their low production cost and possibility of producing lightweight, flexible devices.4 Additionally, devices based on organic semiconductors also display high-efficiency performance. Recently, an impressive high power conversion efficiency of 13.1% has been reported in fullerene-free single junction OPVs.5 The highest external quantum efficiency of OLEDs without out-coupling technology using an organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter was reported to have reached 36.7%.6
While the use of organic materials in optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs appears an evident option, most organic neat films have low solid-state photoluminescent (PL) quantum yields due to strong aggregation luminescence quenching. Doping has been employed to improve the solid-state PL quantum yield via Förster and Dexter energy transfer from the host to the guest molecules. However, this process complicates the device fabrication process and may result in phase separation and higher operating voltages if the dopant acts as a charge carrier trap.7 It was not until after the aggregation induced emission (AIE) was observed in siloles (Fig. 1) that the research and development of AIE materials for OLED fabrication received a considerable boost.8,9 AIE materials, on the molecular level, tend to have weak intermolecular π–π interactions and flexible structures prone to rapid and easy conformational changes which render them efficient emitters in the solid state with high PL quantum yield. Because of this, the huge benefit of AIE material based OLEDs is that doping is no longer necessary and a high efficiency with low efficiency roll-off can be obtained due to small chances in exciton annihilation.10 Thus, the design of organic materials with AIE properties is of great importance in terms of simplifying the fabrication process and obtaining highly stable devices with good performance.
 Fig. 1  Different types of siloles and their AIE properties. 
Typical AIE materials such as silole-based molecules or polymers are a kind of organometallic materials containing the main group element Si, which can be applied in optoelectronic devices.11 The σ-delocalized electronic structure in silicon-coupled polymers, the empty d-orbital of Si and the exocyclic Si–X σ* orbital in silole derivatives facilitate electronic communication in the system, which has led to advances in materials for solar cells, photoresists, and photo- and electroluminescence materials.12 There are mainly three different types of silole units: tetraarylsilole, spirosilole and fused silole (Fig. 1). The emission spectrum of such silole derivatives can be tuned by the variation of substituents in 2,5-positions, while the phenyl units attached in 3,4-positions are known to cause emission deactivation due to intramolecular motion (rotation) leading to non-radiative decay,13 thus, imparting valuable AIE properties to such 3,4-substituted siloles compared to the ones fused on both sides (Fig. 1).14,15
In contrast to the high emission efficiency required for materials used in OLEDs (Fig. 2), a large broad absorption band (400–900 nm) of blended polymers(donor)/molecules(acceptor) is considered an indispensable requirement when it comes to OPVs. Although most polymers have broader light absorption as thin films compared to their solutions, in most cases, the changes are small. However, some dithienosilole-containing molecules and polymers have large extent of absorption band broadening by aggregation (e.g. 200 nm difference), which are good to be used in OPVs owing to their capability of capturing as many photons as possible.16,17

As for the optoelectronic devices other than OLEDs and OPVs, siloles are furthermore a not-so-common material that finds some application in OFET (organic field-effect transistors) and OLEC (organic light-emitting electrochemical cell). A recent paper reported that bithiophene fused silole polymers with an interchain π-stacking distance of 0.37 nm were used for fabrication of solution-processed OFET devices.18 The OLECs manufactured from silole–fluorene copolymers have shown improvement in both the device lifetime and spectral stability compared with polyfluorene.19 In this review, we therefore focus on the recent improvement in the performance of OLEDs and OPVs based on the aforementioned types of siloles. Three main topics, including electronic properties of tetraarylsilole, spirosilole, fused silole molecules and polymers, recent updated structures of silole molecules applied in OLEDs and their device performances, silole-containing polymers applied in OPVs published from 2012 to 2017, are discussed.
2 Electronic properties
2.1 Electronic properties of tetraarylsilole (non-fused and non-spiro silole)

2.1.1 Electron/hole affinity and LUMO/HOMO energy levels of tetraarylsilole. 
The HOMO/LUMO energies of siloles determine the hole/electron injection barrier. A low LUMO of silole indicates that it has a high electron affinity (EA). The electron affinity is defined as the energy difference of an isolated molecule in the gas phase in its neutral state and as a radical-anion. Thus, a negative electron affinity is indicative of an energy stable radical-anion state of the molecule. Electron affinities can be either calculated theoretically as the Hartree–Fock energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), measured by IXPS (Inverse X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) or estimated from the comparison of E1/2(M0/−) values with that of a compound of known EA.20 In direct analogy to EA, ionization potential (IP) is defined as the energy difference of an isolated molecule in the gas phase in its neutral state and as a radical-cation. It can be either theoretically calculated as the Hartree–Fock energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), experimentally determined by XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) or estimated from comparison of E1/2(M+/0) values with that of a compound of known IP.20 However, the most common method used nowadays in the lab to estimate the HOMO/LUMO values is the combination of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the optical band gap determination from the absorption threshold.21
The HOMO (CV: −5.31 to −5.9 eV) in tetraarylsilole is located on the butadiene fragment of the silole ring and the aryl groups in 2,5-positions as well as to a lesser extent on those in 3,4 positions. Their LUMO (CV: −2.37 to −3.1 eV) consists of the LUMO of butadiene with additional in-phase contributions from the exocyclic Si–X σ* orbital, the local LUMOs of the 2,5-aryl groups and, to a smaller extent, of those in 3,4 positions. The HOMOs of the 1,1-substituted tetraphenyl siloles in thin films determined by XPS are in the range of −6.05 to −6.78 eV, suggesting a high barrier for hole injection into the siloles. While the LUMOs of the 1,1-substituted tetraarylsiloles determined by IXPS are in the range from −1.5 to −2.4 eV, which are similar to those of Alq3 (−2.0 to −2.5 eV), indicating low electron-injection barriers.20 The addition of the extra aryl groups (e.g. pyridyl, bipyridyl, phenyl rings) in 2,5-positions of silole simply serves to add more flexibility to the molecule while having a minimal effect on the HOMO/LUMO energy, HOMO/LUMO wave function, HOMO–LUMO gap and electron–hole distribution.22 Also, in the excited state, the excitons are predominantly located on the silole ring and the aryl rings directly at the 2- and 5-positions. Any addition of the external aryl ring does not affect the location of the exciton.
The electronic properties of tetraarylsiloles can be tuned by their structural modification: e.g. donor/acceptor strength of the exocyclic substituents and the position of these substituents on the silole ring. Computational studies reveal that the tentative order can be given for the influence of the substituents’ position on the electronic properties of tetraarylsiloles: 2,5-substituents > 1,1-substituents > 3,4-substitutents (e.g. the replacement of the 2,5-phenyl groups with dimethylfluoren-2-yl groups leads to much larger changes in the electronic properties than introduction of the same groups into the 1,1-positions).23
Concerning the role of the silicon atom in the electronic properties of siloles, as mentioned previously, tetraarylsilole has a relatively low-lying LUMO that essentially arises from the overlap of the π* orbital of the butadiene fragment and the σ* orbital of the exocyclic Si–X fragments consisting as well as the empty 3d orbital on silicon (Fig. 3), while the HOMO has no contributions from the Si.23,24 Most studies support the idea that the ease of reduction of siloles can be attributed to this highly efficient σ*–π* conjugation. Electrochemically speaking, the smaller the oxidizing potential in the first cyclic voltammogram peak, the less readily is the compound reduced. Blue-shift of the UV absorption maxima in siloles means a larger HOMO–LUMO gap, indicating a higher LUMO energy level and thus less stabilization via σ*–π*conjugation in the silole ring. Conversely, red-shifted UV absorption maxima in siloles are an indication of the good σ*–π* conjugation and higher overall stability.
 Fig. 3  Constituent MOs of silole’s LUMO. 
Since the LUMO of silole in general is directly influenced by the substituents on the silicon atom, LUMO energy will be always more susceptible to the substituent variation in 1,1-positions than HOMO energy.25 However, the effects of the substituents on the silicon atom (1,1-substituents in tetraphenylsiloles) are generally rather slight (Fig. 4). The frontier orbitals are stabilized by σ-electron-withdrawing groups and destabilized by the σ-electron-donating groups. Thus, more electron negative 1,1-substituents (σ-electron-withdrawing groups) generally lead to slightly longer wavelengths for the absorption maxima of siloles. For example, the λmax in the UV-Vis spectra of 1,1-substituted siloles increases from 305 (e.g. for H in 1,1-positions) to 318 nm (for F in 1,1-positions).23
 Fig. 4  The LUMO/HOMO energy levels (obtained by CV) of siloles (A: siloles in OLEDs summarized from Table 1, B: silole-containing polymers in OPVs summarized from Table 2). 
While substitution at the silicon atom exerts some influence on the electronic and optical properties of tetraarylsiloles principally via inductive effects, for the 2,5-substituents, both inductive effect (σ-effect) and resonance effects (π-effect) of the substituents have a notable impact on the electronic and optical properties.26,27 For example, 2-thienyl as a weak σ-acceptor does not have much influence in the 1,1-positions, but as a typical π-donor it causes remarkable changes when introduced in the 2,5-positions of siloles.23 Generally, in the 2,5-positions of siloles, strong π-acceptors (e.g. p-Ar-NO2) or π-donors (e.g. p-Ar-NMe2) result in absorption maxima with a larger red shift (extended conjugation lowers energy) as compared to the groups capable of exerting influence only via inductive effects.28 2,5-Substituents with pronounced resonance effects via π-conjugation usually have significantly larger influence on the electronic properties of silole. It is mainly because the extension of both HOMO and LUMO over a larger π system of such substituents (e.g. the 2,5-aryl groups) stabilizes the LUMO but destabilizes the HOMO, leading to a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap and an increased ease of both oxidation and reduction as well as aforementioned red-shifted absorption and fluorescence spectra. Introducing π-electron withdrawing groups in 2,5-positions will usually increase the ease of reduction, while incorporation of π-electron donating groups in this position decreases the ease of oxidation.29 The bulkier the 2,5-substituents (e.g. 1-naphthyl) are, the higher the dihedral angles between silole and 2,5 aryl substituents will be, resulting in larger blue shifts of absorption and emission maxima.30 However, the incorporation of 2,5-substituents with more extended conjugation (e.g. styryl- or biphenyl-) leads to a bathochromic shift in absorption and emission maxima. The increased asymmetry in the silole bridged 2,5-substituents donor–acceptor system results in increasingly bathochromic shifts in the electronic absorption spectra.23
Aryl substituents in 3,4-positions display a markedly twisted geometry (large dihedrals) in siloles. That limits the extension of the HOMO and LUMO from the silole ring onto the substituents in 3,4-positions, significantly resulting in only little change in electronic spectra upon substituents’ variation in these positions. The resonance effects of the substituents in 3,4-positions have a significantly larger influence on the HOMO of siloles than inductive effects. Although aryl groups are considered to be slightly σ-electron-withdrawing, the presence of phenyl groups in 3,4-positions increases the LUMO stability, thus leading to a red shift in absorption.23 Notably, since the overall contribution of the atomic orbitals of the substituents in 2,5-positions to the HOMO is significantly larger, substituents in 3,4-positions will have less influence compared to the ones in 2,5-positions. On the other hand, the presence of phenyl groups in 3,4-positions significantly reduces the fluorescence quantum yields in solution due to the availability of additional torsional modes.31,32


2.1.2 Electron mobility in tetraarylsilole. 
Another important electronic property of siloles is the electron mobility/transport. Electron transfer through an organic silole film is realized via silole/silole anion pairs with negative polarons as charge carriers.22 On the molecular level, this hopping mechanism is tantamount to the one-electron reduction process of a neutral molecule concomitant with the oxidation of its anion.33 The rate constant Ke for electron transfer (polaron hopping) as described by the Marcus–Hush equation (eqn (1)) is related to the transfer integral (or electronic coupling matrix element) Ve and the reorganization energy λtotal required during the intermolecular transfer of an electron.34 (1)where , with ε[L+1] and ε[L] being LUMO+1 and LUMO energy levels taken from the closed-shell configuration of the neutral state of a dimer, respectively.
Quantum-chemical calculations allow for the description of both the transfer integral and the intramolecular reorganization energy.22 The transfer integral is related to the energetic splitting of the frontier orbitals of the molecules as the system goes from isolated molecules to interacting molecules. Analysis at the INDO (Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap) level of theory of the intermolecular electronic coupling between dimers shows that for systems with intermolecular distances ranging between 5 and 7 Å and varying in orientation, the more planar structure of a silole molecule (e.g. silole with heterocyclic bipyridine substituents in 2,5-positions) is, the shorter are the intermolecular distances, and thus the larger are transfer integrals. For siloles, the calculated transfer integrals for both electrons and holes are in the range of 10−2 to 10−3 eV.
According to eqn (1), the lower the reorganization energies, the higher are the electron transfer (carrier hopping) rates.22 However, when it comes to electron mobility in siloles, another factor that has large influence is the electron transfer energy barrier (ΔG‡) between the anionic and the neutral species. Theoretically, for self-exchange electron-transfer reaction between two neighboring silole molecules (with the acceptor silole molecule M being in the neutral electronic state and the donor molecule M− in the reduced radical-anion state), the Marcus theory yields a simple expression for the electron transfer energy barrier: ΔG‡ = λtotal/4, in which the composite entity λtotal is the total reorganization energy for the reaction: MA + MB− → MA− + MB, where λtotal is a sum of λintra,total and λs, with λs being the medium reorganization energy and λintra,total the total intramolecular reorganization energy.
Usually, the total intramolecular reorganization energy can be further split into λ1 and λ2, in which λ1 is the relaxation energy of the electron-donor molecule (initially ionized, MB−), while λ2 is the relaxation energy of the electron-acceptor molecule (initially neutral MA).22 Thus, λintra,total reflects the reorganization energy of hole transfer between neutral/cation or electron transfer between neutral/anion. It can be computationally obtained by the normal-mode analysis. For example, the intramolecular total reorganization energies of silole for electron transfer are ca. 0.5 eV (which is twice that calculated at the same level for Alq3), while those for hole transfer are in the range 0.4–0.6 eV (which is 4–5 times as high as those calculated for pentacene and twice as high as those calculated for TPD: N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine). Thus, the λtotal value of ca. 0.5 eV is large, which is directly related to the very strong geometrical changes occurring in the silole ring upon reduction.23,33
The reorganization energies do not depend considerably on the substituents on the silicon atom. The geometric modifications that occur upon oxidation and reduction of the silole systems are primarily localized on the silole ring and exocyclic Si–Ar bonds, but also to some extent on the phenyl rings in 2 and 5 positions as reflected by the apparent change of torsional angles of these phenyl rings with respect to the silole ring. This localization is mainly responsible for the relatively large reorganization energy. Vibrational analysis shows that the majority of the relaxation energy contributions come from various combinations of ring-breathing modes of the silole and phenyls rings in 2,5-positions, with some minor contributions of C–C rotations in the same position as well as Si–C stretches/bending vibrational modes of the substituents in the 1,1-positions.20
Although reorganization energy λ is directly related to electron mobility, it does not always play a role in some cases. For instance, some nitrogen-containing heterocycles attached to siloles (e.g. 2,5-positions bipyridyl substituted silole, 3-position pyrazine substituted benzosilole) have a high electron mobility of 0.9–7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the electron mobility of 1,1,2,3,4,5-hexaphenylsilole film lies in the range of 2.7–3.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1,35 which is still in excess of that measured for Alq3 (tris(8-hydroxy-quinolinato)aluminium, 1.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1).20,36 The difference in electron mobility between the aforementioned siloles and Alq3 is likely due to the differences in the intermolecular orbital overlap or morphological effects such as charge trapping at grain boundaries, rather than the differences in reorganization energy λ. Siloles have a so called non-dispersive electron transport mechanism which means that the electron trapping due to energetic disorder is very small or negligible, and oxygen does not function as a significant trap in this silole.33
There are several other factors that can influence the electron mobility: (a) electron trapping agents: impurities and oxygen (e.g. oxygen acts as a strong electron trap in the Alq3 film); (b) morphology (crystal vs amorphous); (c) substrate deposition temperatures during device fabrication are known to influence electron mobility in thin films; (d) high electron affinity (EA). High electron affinity usually stabilizes anions in the organic solid and reduces the electron trapping effects caused by oxygen. Most silole derivatives have trap-free electron transport properties and inherently large electron affinity originating from the σ*–π* conjugation in the silole ring.33 Thus, the stable features of low-lying LUMO provide silole-based systems with large electron affinities coupled with redox stability in air and a high aromatic stabilization of their anionic species. Usually attaching strongly electron withdrawing groups to the extended π-electron conjugated system of siloles leads to an increase in EA, however, it can also induce an energetic disorder (dipolar disorder, a fluctuation of energy in electron hopping sites, resulting in highly dispersive electron transport), thus, decreasing hole and electron mobilities. A wide variety of electron withdrawing groups capable of effectively increasing EA has been established and used in OLED materials for years such as 2-thienyl group, nitro, carbonyl, and cyano groups as well as heterocyclic rings including metal complex of quinolone, oxadiazole, quinoxanline, etc.22,33

2.2 Electronic properties of spiro silole
Ko, Kang et al have chosen 2,3,4,5-tetraphenylsilole 1 (Fig. 5) as the core structural motif to study the effects of cycloalkyl substituents in 1,1-positions of siloles on the electronic properties and electroluminescent device performances based on such derivatives.37 The HOMO and LUMO levels of 2,3,4,5-tetraphenylsilole derivatives 1a–1d (Fig. 5) with a four- to six-membered silacyclo alkyl substituent at the 1,1-positions were estimated to range from −5.3 to −5.48 eV and from −2.55 to −2.32 eV (Fig. 4), respectively. These cyclic voltammetry (CV) results indicate that the LUMO levels increase systematically in the order 1a < 1b < 1c < 1d as the size of the silacycloalkyl ring increases, whereas the HOMO levels remain roughly the same. In addition, the gradual elevation of the LUMO with increasing exocyclic ring size provides direct evidence for the occurrence of the blue-shifted UV and PL spectra of 1a–1d, which is consistent with the energy levels obtained via CV experiments and Hartree-Fock level computational studies. The LUMO energy levels in 1a–1d depend significantly on the exocyclic Si–C1(C2) bond lengths and C1–Si–C2 bond angles. The LUMO energy levels in 1a–1d increase in the order 1a < 1b < 1c < 1d as the Si–C1(C2) bond lengths increase and the C1–Si–C2 bond angle decreases. The calculations have conclusively demonstrated that elongated Si–C bonds induce a weakening of the orbital interaction between the π* orbital of the butadiene moiety and the σ* orbital of the exocyclic silicon ring, causing the overall LUMO energy level increase in the siloles. These results strongly indicate that compounds 1a–1d are promising materials for the fabrication of EL devices with an option of fine-tuning their device performances.37

Yet another interesting series of 1,1′-spiro-bisilole(2)-based molecules functionalized with nitrogen-containing heterocyclic groups including 7-azaindolyl (2a), indolyl (2b), and 2,2′-dipyridylamino (2c) and their electroluminescent properties have been recently reported by Wang et al.38 They were found to display good chemical and thermal stability and to be AIE-active with an emission color ranging from blue-green to yellow. Compared to 2d without nitrogen substituents having the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.51 eV and −2.71 eV (Fig. 4),39 the HOMO energy level for 2c was determined to be −5.8 eV by using cyclic voltammetry, and the LUMO energy level in 2c was estimated to be −3.3 eV by using the optical bandgap determined via UV-vis spectroscopy. The double-layer OLED device with the structure of ITO/NPB (60 nm)/2c (45 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al, in which NPB (N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine) acts as the hole-transporting layer and 2c functions as the emitter (λem = 566 nm) and the electron-transporting layer, displaying yellow light (λEL = 557 nm) with stable brightness of 8440 cd m−2 at 9 V with a current efficiency of 1.71 cd A−1.38
Semiconducting materials based on a spiro-dithienosilole core with different-sized cycloalkyl substituents have been reported by Facchetti et al in 2011.40 Silacyclization of the alkyl substituents on the sp3-silicon atom is expected to reduce steric demand of the alkyl groups, thus allowing for better molecular packing via more efficient π–π stacking, further enhancing carrier mobility, contracting solid state contacts, and facilitating charge transport capacity. The HOMO of spiro-dithienosilole lies mainly on the central silole moiety and the nearby thiophene rings. The LUMO in spiro-dithienosilole has a significant contribution from the S atom, while the contribution of the Si atom remains negligible.
As shown in Fig. 5, spiro-fused siloles containing dithienosilole fragments reported to date include molecules and polymers. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 3a from cyclic voltammetry (CV) data are −4.86 eV and −2.41 eV. The multilayer OLED device based on 3a exhibits good performance with a maximum brightness of 12640 cd m−2. 3a has higher hole mobility values than non-spiro compound 1,1-diphenyl-5,5′-bis(N-1-naphthyl-N-phenylamino)-2,2′-dithienosilole, suggesting that a ring on a silicon atom builds an efficient charge-transport channel.41 The HOMO energies of spiro-dithienosilole oligomers 3b–3c in solution determined by CV are −5.4 eV to −5.6 eV (Fig. 4), while the ELUMO levels show little variation with an almost identical value of −3.4 eV, thus, their optical band gaps are ∼2.4 eV. The extended π-conjugation of annulated silole polymer 3d results in red shift in the absorption spectrum, and thus a smaller optical band gap (1.87 eV) than the oligomeric spiro-dithienosiloles. On the other hand, the alkyl substituents are important for optimizing the charge mobility of polymeric semiconductors. Polymer 3d exhibits superior OTFT (organic thin-film transistor) performance with a field-effect hole mobility μh of ca. 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a current Ion/Ioff of roughly 102–103 after annealing at 190 °C.40
Another kind of spiro-fused silole is the spirobisilafluorene 4a.42,43 Spirobisilafluorenes show a significant bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum relative to that of the corresponding carbon analogues because of the elevation of the energy level of HOMO by the spiro conjugation and concomitant more effective σ*–π* overlap between the σ* orbital of the exocyclic Si–C bond and the π* orbital of the oligoarylene fragment. Solid-state films of 4b–4c display intense violet-blue emission (λPL = 398–415 nm) with absolute photoluminescence quantum yields of 30–55%. 9,9′-Spiro-9-silafluorene (4a) optimized at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) levels of theory shows the HOMO/LUMO energies of −6.09 eV and −1.46 eV.42 The HOMO is primarily localized on the silafluorene unit and its energy level is not affected significantly by the aryl substituents. An estimate of the CV data shows the HOMO/LUMO energy levels for 4c to be −5.81 and −2.28 eV, respectively. Similarly, the HOMO and LUMO levels for 4b were determined to be −5.87 and −2.46 eV, indicating a wide electrochemical band gap (3.41 eV). Based on this result, 4b appears to be a good electron transporter as well as an efficient hole blocker. Its reduction potential is nearly identical to that of the most commonly used electron-transporting material Alq3 (ca. −2.30 V vs. Fc/Fc+) in OLEDs.43
2.3 Electronic properties of fused silole
Fused siloles have extended conjugation due to their highly planar structure and low LUMO energy levels which endow them enhanced electron affinity. As a result, they are considered as efficient materials for organic optoelectronic devices. Except for some non-spiro dithienosilole molecules and polymers similar to their derivatives (Fig. 5 and 8),16,44 siloles fused to other heteroaromatic systems, such as bi(benzothiophene), biindole, bipyridyl, biselenophene, phenylthiophene, phenylcarbazole, naphthylindole, and quinoidal fused oligosiloles have been studied to clarify their potential for use in such applications. In these studies, Ohshita et al reported in 2016 the first example of a benzofuran-fused silole 5 (Fig. 6).45 Theoretical investigations indicated that the introduction of the SiPh2 unit can enhance the conjugation of bi(benzofuran) mainly by raising the HOMO energy level (−5.2 eV) and lowering the LUMO energy level (−1.2 eV), while CV measurements performed on the solution of 5 showed irreversible CV profiles and well reproduced computational results with the estimated HOMO energy level of −5.6 eV.
 Fig. 6  Structures of fused quinoidial siloles. 
A series of new potentially interesting quinoidal fused oligosiloles were reported by Shintani, Yamashita, Nozaki et al.46 A systematic comparison of the electrochemical properties of the compounds 6a–6c uncovered the unique trend in their LUMO energy levels (−2.90 eV for 6a, −2.79 eV for 6b and −2.73 eV for 6c), which become higher with longer π conjugation. Theoretical calculations explained this unusual trend in terms of enhanced interaction of the frontier orbitals of the terminal indenylidene (cyclopentadienylidene) units in these compounds with the HOMO of the central polyene unit. Compared with the compound 6d (Fig. 4 and 6, HOMO/LUMO: −5.49/−2.84 eV), both the oxidation and reduction potentials for 6e are higher, indicating that both the HOMO and LUMO levels are lower (−5.63/−3.03 eV) as a result of the introduction of chlorine atoms, although their energy gaps are almost identical (2.65 and 2.60 eV, respectively). On the other hand, the oxidation potential became lower and the reduction potential became higher for donor–acceptor-type compound 6f (−4.97/−3.16 eV), leading to a narrower HOMO–LUMO energy gap (1.81 eV).
3 Siloles in OLEDs
OLEDs are a kind of solid-state lighting device that can convert electric current to light. The emitting layer of organic semiconductor used in OLEDs can be based on fluorescent, phosphorescent or TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) materials.47 There are basically two main families: small molecules-based (MOLEDs) and polymers-based (PLEDs) devices. Compared to molecules or polymers with ACQ (aggregation-caused quenching) properties, AIE-active materials used in OLEDs have many advantages such as high external quantum efficiency (EQE), non-doped fabrication process and simplified device configuration etc. Among these AIE materials, silole is a popular AIEgen used in OLEDs due to its good electron affinity/mobility, high thermal stability and high solid-state fluorescent quantum yield with some of them even reaching ∼100%.48 In this part, we focus on the most recent structures of three different types of silole molecules used in OLEDs which have not been mentioned in the recent reviews.49–52
For the spiro siloles used in OLEDs, as shown in Fig. 7, the M1-based device has a maximum external quantum efficiency of 4.3% at ∼10 A m−2 (Table 1). As is evident by the almost identical shape and peak emission maxima of PL and EL spectra, there is no exciplex formation at the interface between M1 and the hole transporting layer.7 Compared to the acyclic analogue M2 (2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.613 MV cm−1, Tg = 77 °C), the cyclization of 1,1′-silanylene unit of silole results in spiro siloles M4 and M5, which exhibit higher Tg values (95 °C and 86 °C) and higher electron mobility (M4: 6.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.581 MV cm−1). Additionally, the five-membered exo-cyclic silacyclopentyl silole M4 applied in OLEDs as an electron transporting material has an enhanced device performance than M5.53

Benzosilole is a kind of blue emitting fused silole with high electron mobility and affinity.54 The fused silole M6 can be used as a hole-blocking material (HBM) in phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (POLEDs) due to its high electron-drift mobility of 7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and high triplet energy of 2.43 eV. The POLED based on green phosphorescent fac-Ir(ppy)3 using M6 as a HBM shows high performance, surpassing the widely-used hole-blocking material BCP (bathocuproine) for the luminance efficiency, current efficiency, maximum luminance and external quantum efficiency (Table 1).55
While spiro and fused siloles are used as electron transporting or hole blocking materials in OLEDs, non-spiro and non-fused siloles with AIE properties are mainly used as emitters. Structural modification of 1,2,3,4,5-positions on tetraarylsilole is a well-established and reliable way of designing efficient silole emitters used in OLEDs. To date, there has been only one report on 2,4-isopropyl substituted hexaphenylsilole being used as an emitting layer in OLEDs with a good current efficiency of 5.86 cd A−1.13 Most of the research on tetraarylsilole modification focuses mainly on varying substitution patterns in 1,1-positions and 2,5-positions. For example, several 1,1-positions substituted siloles such as M3, M7 and M8 applied in OLEDs as emitting layers have been reported to have good device performances. 2,5-Bis(2′,2′′-bipyridin-6-yl)-1,1-dimethyl-3,4-diphenylsilacyclo-pentadiene (M2) has a high electron mobility of 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.64 MV cm−1 in either nitrogen or aerobic environment. Using M2 as the electron transporting layer and a highly luminescent silole derivative 1,2-bis(1-methyl-2,3,4,5,-tetraphenylsila-cyclopentadienyl)ethane (M3) as the emitter, an EQE of 4.8% in OLEDs was achieved, which is close to the theoretical limit for a device using a fluorescent emitter.56 Incorporating a silole unit into 2-methyl-8-oxyquinaldinate, 1-methyl-1-aluminodiquinaldinate-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylsilole M7 results in a slight blue-shift emission and higher fluorescence quantum yield. The OLED based on M7 as an emitting layer sandwiched by the hole transporting layer NPB and the electron transporting layer TPBi shows a good current efficiency of 7.89 cd A−1 (Table 1).57 The flexibility of the long substituent attached to silicon atom in M8 lowers the melting point of silole, making it easier to control the evaporation process and deposition rate. And the OLED based on M8 has an effective external quantum efficiency of ∼4%.58
Exciplex emission takes place in MOLEDs at the heterojunction interface between the hole/electron-transporting layer and emitting layer due to their relatively large differences in the energy levels. The radiative relaxation of an exciplex leads to a red shift of the emission compared to the PL emission of the individual component. For example, an efficient exciplex emission between NPB and 2,5-position diphenyl substituted silole M9 can be observed in a three-layer device, which results in an external quantum efficiency of 3.4% at ∼100 A m−2.59 Some other 2,5-position substituted siloles fabricated in OLEDs have similar red-shift EL spectra too. Planar fluorophore pyrene substituted silole M10 applied in OLEDs exhibits yellow emission with a maximum luminance of 49000 cd cm−2 and a high current efficiency of 9.1 cd A−1.60 2,5-Position benzothiophene substituted silole M11 as an emitting layer in OLEDs exhibits a green emission with an external quantum efficiency of 3.63%.61 Similar structures of 9,9-dimethylfluorenyl substituted siloles M12 and M13 used in OLEDs show high optoelectronic performances, in which M13-based OLED exhibits red-shift emission with a high external quantum efficiency of 5.5%.62 While the diphenylamine substituted silole M14 with a propeller-shaped structure has a good OLED device performance without obvious exciplex formation,63 the electroluminescent emission maximum of naphthalen-2-yl-phenyl substituted silole M15 used in OLEDs has a strong bathochromic shift compared to its photoluminescent maximum.64 Another example of exciplex formation observed in OLEDs is the use of the hole transporting (N-1-naphthyl) phenylamino-containing silole M16. A single-layer OLED device with M16 being sandwiched between the ITO anode and LiF/Al cathode has a light-yellow color (λEL = 560 nm), substantially red-shifted compared to the photoluminescence spectrum of M16.65 As seen from the Table 1, most siloles with 3,4-positions substituted rotors are AIE active. However, the removal of the phenyl rings at the 3,4-positions dramatically increase the quantum yields of dipyridylamino substituted siloles M17 and M18 in solution. Compared to the highly featured film of M17, the hexyl group in M18 avoids unfavorable stacking of the molecules, which results in an amorphous film, and thus, better recombination efficiency of holes and electrons in the emissive compound applied in OLEDs.66
Based on the above discussion, by tuning the silole structures of the emitting layer, the color of the device varies from blue to yellow with a small turn-on voltage and high efficiency. Most AIE-active siloles used in OLEDs (Fig. 4) have high solid state fluorescent quantum yields with HOMO energy levels similar to NPB (−5.4 eV) and LUMO energies close to TPBi (−2.7 eV). Thus, the common configuration of OLED devices based on these siloles is the emitter sandwiched between NPB and TPBi. By adding an extra layer of MoO3 as a hole injecting layer for M13 results in the highest EQE. To date, the highest reported EQE of these silole molecules applied in non-doped OLEDs remains up to 6%, which is close to the theoretical maximum EQE limit of 5–7.5% in fluorescent OLEDs.67 However, to date, there have been no TADF silole derivatives that have been designed successfully to be used in OLEDs to obtain even higher performances.
4 Siloles in OPVs
OPVs are of outstanding interest as a main source of renewable energy. In contrast to OLEDs, the exciton formed in the OPV photoactive layer upon light absorption dissociates into holes and electrons at the donor–acceptor interface, then these free charge carriers migrate toward the electrodes to form a circuit.68 Due to the historically formed preferential use of the small molecular fullerene derivatives, also known as PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) because of their own optimal HOMO and LUMO energy levels for many systems, the photoactive layer in OPVs is usually the blend of acceptor PCBM (UV vis abs < 400 nm) and a semiconducting donor polymer which facilitates better film formation. Since a narrower band gap (<1.8 eV) of donor polymers results in broad light absorption (400–900 nm) shifted to red region, and a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor materials can increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the development of alternating electron-rich (D, donor) and electron-deficient (A, acceptor) units in D–A copolymers is a straightforward approach to regulating the HOMO, LUMO and energy band gap due to different D–A interactions. Usually, for the photoactive layer in OPVs, the HOMO energy of donor copolymers is larger than −5.4 eV, while the LUMO energy of the acceptor materials is smaller than −3.6 eV. The energy levels of both donor and acceptor materials should be well aligned for efficient charge transfer between the two components in the photoactive layer. Additionally, the coarser morphology and fine intermixing of two phases enable efficient dissociation of electron–hole pairs at the donor/acceptor interfaces.69
The typical architecture of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices consists of a blend of conjugated polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors. These polymer photovoltaic cells can be fabricated using a typical structure of ITO/PEODT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. To date, the most popular unit containing organometallic main group element used in polymer of the BHJ solar cells has been the donor dithienosilole (DTS). The electron rich DTS-based polymers as donor materials in OPVs have good hole mobility. Compared to non-silicon containing polymers, this silole-containing polymer based OPV has enhanced device performance which is attributed to the higher crystallinity of Si containing materials and better interchain packing.70,71 Furthermore, the low lying σ* orbital of Si conjugated with the π* orbital in the system lowers the LUMO level of the polymer resulting in a narrower band gap (Fig. 4). In this section, we focus on the discussion on the most recent structures of silole-containing polymers as donor materials used in OPVs that were published from 2012–2017. Most of these silole-based polymers have broader light absorption as thin films compared to their solutions (absorption band broadening by aggregation). For example, as shown in Fig. 8, thin film of dithienosilole derivative P1 (abs 300–800 nm in soln, 300–1000 nm as thin film), thin films of dithienosilole-containing polymers P2 (abs 300–720 nm in soln, 300–760 nm as thin film), P5 (abs 300–780 nm in soln, 300–900 nm as thin film), P8 (abs 350–670 nm in soln, 350–800 nm as thin film), P9 and P10 (abs 300–640 nm in soln, 300–800 nm as thin film) have red shifted absorptions as compared to their solutions.16,17,69,73,74
 Fig. 8  Typical silole-containing structures applied in OPVs published from 2012 to 2017. 
Small molecules and low Mw (e.g. 19.5 kg mol−1) of polymers have an influence on their film morphology and optoelectronic properties, although the control of the morphology of BHJ films is still not well understood.73 According to the theory, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells can reach 10–15%,70 however, Forrest et al. reported the thermodynamic limit of PCE in OPVs to be as high as 22–27%.4 To date, the best PCEs of both solution-processed small molecule-based and polymer-based OPVs have achieved over 9%.75 Although only in a few cases DTS-based small molecules have been reported as the electron-donor materials for OPVs, small molecules have their own advantages such as facile control of energy levels and less batch-to-batch variation compared to polymers used in solar cells.16 Zhan X et al. reported the synthesis of an A–D–A small molecule P1 (Fig. 8) and studied the photovoltaic performances of solar cells based on this molecule.16 They have found that the use of the additive is necessary to actively influence the nanomorphology and increase the fill factor (FF) above 50%.76 Addition of 0.5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive to a 1:1.5 P1/PC71BM blend increases the roughness of the blended film resulting in a better phase separation, which is favorable for preferable short circuit current (Jsc) of 11.28 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.64 V, fill factor of 59.5% and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.28%, indicating that the thiophene-fused diketopyrrolopyrrole unit in P1 can act as an efficient acceptor moiety to construct dithienosilole-based small molecules for OPVs (Table 2).16 However, in most cases, DTS-based polymers are promising donor materials used in OPVs with better performances compared to DTS small molecules. For example, using a ternary solvent system during the thin-film fabrication, the BHJ solar cells based on P2/PC71BM (Fig. 8) achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.85% (Table 2), indicating good carrier mobility and charge-separation efficiency.73 Another alternating copolymer P13 afforded a PCE of 7.3% with Voc = 0.88 V.74

Originally, poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithienosilole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5,5′-diyl] P3 (Fig. 8) was considered the most favorable silole-based polymer to be used in OPVs.71,77,78 The stabilization of P3 in OPV is realized by the addition of fullerenes which stabilizes π-conjugated polymers by quenching the polymer exciton through electron transfer. However, the photooxidation degradation of the photoactive layer in OPVs can result in different extent of UV absorbance loss of the P3, which changes the layer morphology and decreases the device performance.77 Besides, solvents and additives can influence the blend morphology. The processing technique is known to be critical to the OPV performance. Although the inkjet-printing using the drop-on-demand (DoD) technology is advantageous regarding low material consumption and device flexibility, the power conversion efficiency of OPV manufactured using this technology has never exceeded 4%.78 On the other hand, the usual doctor blading and spin coating are lab-scale techniques that allow realizing high performance potential of the conjugated polymers used in OPVs. For a P3/PC71BM (1:1.5 by weight) based OPV, its power conversion efficiency yields 5.66% with a doctor-bladed active layer, but a significantly lower PCE of 3.01% when used in inkjet trials, indicating less efficient photon to electron conversion.78 The PCE of P3/PC71BM (1:1 by weight)-based OPV fabricated by spin coating is 4.23%.71 Interfacial area is required to be large to achieve an efficient charge separation at the donor–acceptor interface and charge transport toward the anode and cathode electrodes. A more homogeneous phase distribution of donors and acceptors in the blend layer and higher surface roughness lead to the increase of the OPV efficiency.76 The phase separation is driven by the thin blend films, the crystallization of at least one of the two components, and the incompatibility of the two components caused by solvent or different surface energy. Compared to C-bridged dithiophene polymers, the smaller difference in the surface energy of P3 and PC71BM results in a better intermixing of the blend. Additionally, a lower boiling point solvent has a fast evaporation rate leading to a better intermixing of the blend components.
Other polymeric structures similar to P3 are shown in Fig. 8. By inserting the vinylene double bond in the DTS polymer chain, a narrower band gap of 1.55 eV for P4 has been achieved. (Table 2).70 Introduction of high electron affinity fluorine atoms into the polymer backbone is expected to minimize the steric hindrance and reduce the HOMO energy level, thus, the polymer P5 based OPV shows a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.71 compared to non-fluorinated polymer based OPVs.17 The donor–acceptor DTS-containing copolymer P3 blended with PC71BM as a photoactive layer in OPVs has a PCE of 5.9%.74 A similar DTS benzothiadiazole-containing copolymer P6 exhibits a PCE of 3.64% when blended with PC71BM. This polymer has a high hole mobility of 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 probably arising from the silicon atoms that can enhance the intermolecular interaction and packing between polymer chains.52 However, the benzothiadiazole copolymer containing tetraarylsilole (P7) blended with PC61BM fabricated in a simple OPV shows a low PCE of 1.2%.79
The DTS and cyanated oligothiophene copolymer P8 applied in the BHJ solar cell shows a PCE of ∼5% and an open-circuit voltage greater than 0.8 V without the need of additional thermal annealing.74 On an average, the devices based on polymers P9 and P10 comprising the electron rich DTS moiety and the electron deficient benzobisazole unit have similar performances with PCEs of ∼3% without the use of solvent additives.69 The OPVs based on polymers complexed with B(C6F5)3 exhibit relatively higher Voc, lower PCE and Jsc compared to non-complexed polymers. For instance, in DTS-pyridine polymer P11, the electron deficient pyridine unit can induce a strong interaction between the polymers and B(C6F5)3 molecules, which gives the N–B complex polymer P12. This complex formation can enhance the D–A interaction thus resulting in broader and red-shifted absorption peaks (Table 2). And the OPV based on this complex polymer has an increased Voc (0.59 V) although the Jsc is largely suppressed to lower the PCE of 0.25%.72
Although advantages of using silole-based polymers in OPVs are manifold, such as the low LUMO, narrow band gap facilitating broad absorption, and easy attachment of alkyl chain on Si atom which increases solubility and allows for better film formation, a good photovoltaic cell with high Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE requires materials having a well-balanced set of parameters in terms of chemical, electronic properties and processing conditions. According to the performances of silole-containing polymer-based OPV devices discussed above (Table 2), high Mw, broad absorption with a narrow band gap, good hole mobility, a moderately low-lying HOMO of stable polymers as well as the use of additives, PC71BM, and Ca during the processing are advantageous for obtaining high PCEs of the cell. To date, the most efficient OPVs have been manufactured by the lab-scale spin coating technique. Successful commercialization of high performance OPVs using doctor blading, inkjet printing, or roll-to-roll production processes is yet to be achieved.
5. Conclusions and outlook
In this paper, we reviewed electronic properties of different recently published types of silole-based organic semiconductors and the advances in their application in OLED and OPV devices. In the first part, we summarized the electronic properties of tetraarylsilole- (non-fused and non-spiro silole), spiro silole-, spiro-fused silole- and fused silole-based small molecules and polymers. Most siloles display trap-free electron transport and low-lying LUMO resulting in relatively large electron affinity. Planar structures, shorter intermolecular distances and lower reorganization energies in siloles, are the three basic requirements necessary for high electron transfer rate. Additionally, the electron mobility of silole derivatives can be tuned within a considerable range (7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) by varying the substituents in them. The spiro-dithienosilole compounds display in general higher hole mobility than non-spiro siloles. The electron rich dithienosilole-based polymers also display good hole mobility.
The HOMO/LUMO energies in silole derivatives are usually obtained from the CV experiments. In tetraarylsiloles, HOMOs are located on the butadiene fragment of the silole ring and the aryl groups in 2,5-positions, while the LUMO also contains the σ* molecular orbital of the exocyclic Si–X fragments. Thus, substitution at the silicon atom exerts direct influence on the electronic state of LUMO via inductive effects. However, for the 2,5-substituents, both inductive effect and resonance effect have a notable impact on the electronic and optical properties, while the substituents in 3,4-positions generally have rather slight electronic influence via inductive effects. In the spiro non-fused siloles, the HOMO and LUMO distributions are similar to those of tetraarylsiloles. The LUMO levels (−2.32 to −2.55 eV) increase as the size of the silacycloalkyl ring increases, whereas the HOMO levels (−5.3 to −5.48 eV) remain roughly the same. In the spiro-dithienosiloles siloles, the LUMO (−3.4 eV) has a significant contribution from the S atom but not Si atom, while the HOMO (−5.4 eV to −5.6 eV) is mainly located on the central silole moiety and nearby thiophene rings. Remarkably, for the quinoidal fused siloles, a reverse trend in LUMO energy levels is observed: with the more extended π conjugation, the LUMO energy levels rise (−2.73 to −2.90 eV).
The electronic properties of siloles determine their application field. For silole derivatives used in OLEDs, a better match between siloles’ LUMO/electron transporting layer’s energy levels and siloles’ HOMO/hole transporting layer’s energy levels as well as sufficiently good electron mobility (10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for emitting layer and 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electron transporting layer) are crucial. For silole-containing polymers applied in OPVs, the narrow HOMO–LUMO band gap (<1.8 eV is preferable for broad absorption.
A summary of the recent advances in OLED devices based on spiro siloles, fused siloles and 1,2,3,4,5-substituted tetraarylsiloles is given. Recent reports suggest that the spiro and fused siloles can, indeed, replace some widely-used electronic materials to act as electron transporting layers or hole blocking materials due to their high electron mobility and low LUMO energy levels. The AIE-active 1,2,3,4,5-substituted tetraarylsiloles mainly used for emitters in non-doped OLEDs display good performances, some of which have EQEs (4.8%, 5.5%) close to the theoretical limit (5–7.5%) of fluorescent OLEDs.
In the final section, we itemized and summarized the dithienosilole-based polymers published between 2012 and 2017 that find application in solar cells. Small energy band gap (due to the low lying LUMO levels), large absorption band (broadened by aggregation), high crystallinity (due to better interchain packing) and high hole mobility make them acceptable donor materials in OPVs with good device performances (e.g. PCE of 7.85%).
Although some progress has been achieved in silole-derivatives based OLEDs and silole-containing polymer-based OPVs, a great amount of effort is still required to deepen our understanding of the mechanism underlying the charge transfer processes in the silole-based materials to further develop devices with improved performances. Design of novel siloles to realize their TADF properties with the end goal of surpassing the EQE limits of device published to date remains a dauntingly challenging task. Moreover, additional insights into the working mechanisms behind the better performance (high efficiency with low efficiency roll off) of non-doped AIE-active siloles used in OLEDs as dual function (emitting and electron transporting) layer in simplified devices on the molecular level are highly desirable, as so far only some speculative explanations (such as small chances of exciton annihilation due to weak interactions from molecules with flexible configurations) have been offered.
As for siloles applied in OPVs, although the incorporation of silole-based structural fragments with the low-lying LUMO in the D–A copolymers does help to tune and narrow the band gap, there are no clear guidelines concerning the molecular design of silole-containing polymers to realize large absorption band broadening caused by aggregation, as the absorption band broadening varies somewhat unpredictably in a different polymer. It, furthermore, appears worthwhile to study the structure-absorption band broadening relation differences in solution and aggregated materials, which could potentially provide valuable leads for the polymer design, and thus enable fabrication of solar cells with the extended absorption range, higher performance and transparency. Additionally, the PCE of OPVs based on silole-containing polymers still need to be further improved.
