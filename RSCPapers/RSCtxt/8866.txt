    , Accepted 26th January 2009First published on 27th February 2009AbstractA simple but elegant way to obtain linked donor–acceptor entities involving metallomacrocycle complexes with fixed distance and orientation is the use of coordination of axial ligands to metallomacrocycle complexes. A series of electron acceptor-bearing silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc) triads have been readily synthesized, using the six-coordinated nature of the central silicon atom, by attachment of two electron-acceptor units, fullerene SiPc-(C60)2, trinitrofluorenone SiPc-(TNF)2 and trinitrodicyanomethylenefluorene SiPc-(TNDCF)2. The nitrogen of pyridylnaphthalenediimide (PyNIm) can coordinate to the metal center of zinc porphyrin to form a donor–acceptor complexes: ZnTPP-PyNIm. The binding of pyridine moieties to Zn-porphyrin complexes is much enhanced by the distortion of porphyrin ring. By taking advantage of saddle distortion of zinc octaphenylphthalocyanine (ZnOPPc) and diprotonated dodecaphenylporphyrin (H4DPP2+), a discrete supramolecular assembly composed of Zn(OPPc) and H4DPP2+ and is obtained by using 4-pyridinecarboxylate (4-PyCOO−) with the axial coordination bond and hydrogen bonding. The charge separation in these metal macrocycles linked with electron acceptors with axial coordination bonds is described together with the application to develop supramolecular solar cells.Takahiko KojimaCurrent address: Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Pure and Applied Science, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8571, Japan.

Introduction
The importance and complexity of energy transfer and electron transfer processes in photosynthesis have inspired the design and synthesis of a large number of donor–acceptor covalently linked ensembles including dyads, triads, tetrads and pentads that can mimic the energy transfer or electron transfer processes.1–9 However, achieving the long lifetime and the high efficiency of charge separation (CS) like in natural photosynthesis has often been hampered by synthetic difficulties to make a number of covalent bonds to connect each component. In contrast to donor–acceptor ensembles linked by C–C bonds, the use of metal–ligand coordination, electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonds and rotaxane formation provides a simpler but more elegant way to construct electron donor–acceptor ensembles mimicking the biological electron transfer systems.10–14 When a non-coordinating solvent is used, an efficient charge separation occurs in the supramolecular donor–acceptor complexes but the charge-separated (CS) state is extremely short-lived.14 In contrast, the CS state could be long-lived in a coordinating solvent, but the formation of the supramolecular complex between the donor and acceptor moieties is normally prohibited by the solvent coordination.14 In a polar coordinating solvents such as benzonitrile (PhCN), intermolecular electron transfer prevails and the radical ions produced by photoinduced electron transfer decay via the bimolecular back electron transfer reactions, obeying second-order kinetics.15 This is a typical dilemma for the long-lived charge separation in supramolecular donor–acceptor complexes.
Macrocyclic compounds such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines have widely been employed as building blocks for the photoactive and electroactive assemblies due to their excellent light-harvesting ability in the wide wavelength region (500–700 nm) and to their rich redox chemistry.16–19 This perspective focuses on the recent development of successful detection of the CS state of metallomacrocycles linked with electron acceptors by axial coordination bonds supramolecular donor–acceptor complexes. A proper choice of the axial ligand and the solvent together with combination of non-covalent bonding such as hydrogen bond and π–π interaction has enabled to achieve the efficient and long-lived charge separation in the supramolecular donor–acceptor complexes, leading to development of supramolecular solar cells.
Strong axial coordination in electron donor–acceptor ensembles of silicon phthalocyanines
Silicon phthalocyanines (SiPc) have been employed as convenient electron donor units, which can form strong Si–O bonds by axial coordination of carboxylates with electron acceptor units.20–24 A C60-SiPc-C60 triad (1) was afforded by a double Prato reaction from the bis(4-formylbenzoate)silicon phthalocyanine, which was synthesized by the nucleophilic displacement of two chloride substituents of SiPc with p-formylbenzoic acid (Scheme 1).23 Similarly, electron acceptor-bearing silicon phthalocyanine hybrids have been synthesized using trinitrofluorenone (TNF) and trinitrodicyano-methylenefluorene (TNDCF) to afford TNF-SiPc-TNF 2 and TNDCF-SiPc-TNDCF 3 (Scheme 1).24 These triads exhibit no aggregation phenomena in solution due to the presence of electron acceptor units in the axial position and the tert-butyl groups in the equatorial positions of the phthalocyanine, which are characterized by the close distance between the electron acceptor moieties and the Pc subunits.24
 Scheme 1  
Electron donor–acceptor triads of SiPc. 
The HOMO and LUMO of these triads 1–3 are located on the SiPc and the axial ligands, respectively as shown in Fig. 1.24 The occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of SiPc to the electron acceptor moieties was confirmed by femtosecond laser flash photolysis measurements.24 The photoexcitation of a deaerated PhCN solution containing SiPc-(C60)21 with a 400 nm femtosecond laser pulse affords transient absorption bands at 580, 880 and 1000 nm (Fig. 2). The absorption bands at 580 and 880 nm are diagnostic of the radical cation of phthalocyanines22,25 and the NIR band at 1000 nm is characteristic of the one due to the radical anion of C60 derivatives.8,9 From the rise in absorbance at 880 nm, due to SiPc˙+ in Fig. 2, the rate constant of formation of the CS state of the triad 1 is determined to be 3.2 × 109 s−1. The CS state decays by charge recombination (CR) to the triplet excited state of the SiPc moiety (3SiPc*), because the triplet energy (1.26 eV) is lower than the CS state as shown in the energy diagram in Scheme 2a.24 The formation of 3SiPc* was confirmed by the nanosecond laser flash photolysis.24 The lifetime of the CS state in PhCN is determined to be 5.0 ns from the decay of absorbance at 880 nm as well as 1000 nm.24

 Scheme 2  Energy diagrams of photoinduced electron transfer in (a) SiPc-(C60)21, (b) SiPc-(TNF)22 and (c) SiPc-(TNDCF)23. 
The energy diagrams of photoinduced electron transfer in SiPc-(TNF)22 and SiPc-(TNDCF)23 are also summarized in Scheme 2b and 2c, respectively. In each case, photoinduced electron transfer occurs from the 1SiPc* unit to the acceptor unit to produce the CS state. In the case of SiPc-(C60)21 and SiPc-(TNF)22, the CS state decays via CR to produce 3SiPc* rather than the ground state. This is not the case of SiPc-(TNDCF)23, because the energy of the CS state (1.04 eV) is lower than the energy of the triplet excited state (3SiPc*: 1.26 eV).
The driving force dependence (Fig. 3) of the rate constants of photoinduced electron transfer from the 1SiPc* unit to the acceptor unit in triads 1–3 (kET) and back electron transfer to the triplet excited state (kBET) can be well fitted by the Marcus equation (eqn (1)),26 (1)where V is the electronic coupling matrix element, h is the Planck constant, T is the absolute temperature, ΔGET is the free energy change of electron transfer (−ΔGET is the driving force), and λ is the reorganization energy of electron transfer.
 Fig. 3  Driving force dependence of log (kET and kBET) for photoinduced electron transfer (charge separation; CS) and back electron transfer (charge recombination; CR) in SiPc triads (1–3). The solid lines are drawn as the best fit line to eqn (1) using the values of λ = 0.80 eV and V = 70 cm−1. 
The best fit of the results using eqn (1) affords a small reorganization energy of 0.80 eV and a large electronic coupling matrix V = 70 cm−1.24 The small λ and large V values indicate that the CS and CR processes of a series of axially-substituted silicon phthalocyanine triads proceed by adiabatic electron transfer because of the close proximity between the SiPc and the electron acceptor units in the axial positions. In the case of CR of 1 and 2, back electron transfer to the ground state is deeply in the Marcus inverted region and thereby CR occurs via the spin–orbit interaction to produce the triplet excited state [3SiPc*-(C60)2 and 3SiPc*-(TNF)2] rather than the ground state.24 In the case of 3, however, the CR occurs to the ground state, because the CS energy is lower than the triplet energy (Scheme 2c).24

        Silicon phthalocyanine with more than two fullerene substituents have also been synthesized using fullerodendrimers with up to eight fullerene substituents [SiPc-nC60; n = 2 (G1), 4 (G2) and 8 (G3) show in Fig. 4] to increase the light harvesting efficiency as well as the CS lifetime.27 The synthetic strategy for the dendritic fullerenes G1–G3 consisted of preparing larger dendrimer arms or dendrons (Gn–OH) and coupling several of these to a phthalocyanine core convergently.27 The synthesis of the requisite dendrons was based upon a repetitive coupling/deprotection sequence that utilized silyl-protected phenols and dicarboxylic acids.27
 Fig. 4  Molecular structures of G1–G3. 
The CS and CR processes of G1–G3 were examined by laser photolysis measurements in PhCN and the CS lifetimes increase in the order of G1 (55 ns) < G2 (111 ns) < G3 (280 ns).27 The elongation of the CS lifetime may result from the electron migration among the C60 subunits.27

        SiPc can also act as an electron acceptor in non-sandwich-type metal-coordinated heterotrimers with free base porphyrins and zinc porphyrins [SiPc–(H2P)2 and SiPc–(ZnP)2, which are shown in Fig. 5. These heterotrimers contain both a light-harvesting complex and a charge separation unit in one molecule.
 Fig. 5  Chemical structures of SiPc–(H2P)2 and SiPc–(ZnP)2. 
The photoexcitation of porphyrin moieties of the triads results in electron transfer from the singlet excited state of H2P and ZnP to SiPc to produce the CS state [SiPc˙−–(H2P˙+)(H2P) and SiPc˙−–(ZnP˙+)(ZnP)], respectively.28 The occurrence of the SiPc fluorescence after the photoexcitation of porphyrin moieties gives evidence for energy transfer from the porphyrin moieties to the SiPc moiety as well. The direct photoexcitation of the SiPc moiety also results in electron transfer from the porphyrin moieties to the singlet excited state of SiPc to afford the same CS state. Thus, excitation of either the porphyrin moieties or the SiPc moiety leads to efficient charge separation. The energy diagram is summarized in Scheme 3. The electron- and energy-transfer processes compete for the depopulation of the first excited singlet state of the porphyrin moieties.28

Axial coordination in electron donor–acceptor ensembles of zinc porphyrins
Nitrogenous bases are known to readily bind to zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry by axial coordination.29 The pyridine moiety of pyridylnaphthalene-diimide (PyNIm) coordinates to zinc(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) in PhCN (eqn (2)). (2)
The formation constant (K) of the ZnTPP-PyNIm complex was determined from the spectral change due to the complex formation to be 5.2 × 102 mol−1 dm3 in PhCN.30 The K value decreases with increasing the polarity of the solvent.30 In PhCN and benzene, the ZnTPP-PyNIm complex can be obtained as a major component in solution using the much large concentration of PyNIm than the K−1 value, whereas the smallest K value (4.8 × 102 mol−1 dm3) and the lowest solubility of PyNIm in acetonitrile (MeCN) has precluded to obtain the ZnTPP-PyNIm complex as a major component in MeCN.30
The 1H NMR signals of free PyNIm exhibit upfield shifts upon complexation with ZnTPP in C6D6. The signal of the free PyNIm and the complexed PyNIm always coalesced into a single signal.30 This indicates that the complexation occurs faster than the NMR time scale. The large upfield shift of the pyridyl aromatic protons of PyNIm (3.18 ppm) induced by the complexation is ascribed to the large porphyrin aromatic ring-current.29 This result clearly indicates that the pyridyl group PyNIm coordinates axially to the central zinc ion of ZnTPP.
Photoexcitation of Q band of ZnTPP at 560 nm in PhCN results in fluorescence at λmax = 605 and 654 nm. Addition of PyNIm to a PhCN solution of ZnTPP results in a significant change in the fluorescence spectrum of ZnTPP.30 The fluorescence intensity of ZnTPP decreases to reach a constant value with increasing PyNIm concentration as the ZnTPP-PyNIm complex is formed. Virtually the same K value (6.0 × 102 mol−1 dm3) is obtained from the change in the fluorescence spectrum of ZnTPP in the presence of PyNIm as the value obtained from the absorption spectral change.30
The free energy change of photoinduced electron transfer (ΔGET) from 1ZnTPP* to PyNIm in the ZnTPP-PyNIm complex in PhCN is determined as −0.70 eV from the one-electron oxidation potential of the ZnTPP-Py complex, the excitation energy (S1 = 2.05 eV) of ZnTPP and the one-electron reduction potential of PyNIm in PhCN.30 Thus, the photoinduced electron transfer in PhCN is highly exergonic. The rate constant of electron transfer (kET) from 1ZnTPP* to PyNIm in the supramolecular complex in PhCN is determined as 1.2 × 1010 s−1 from the difference between reciprocal lifetimes of the supramolecular complex and the reference system, i.e., ZnTPP-pyridine complex.30
The occurrence of the photoinduced electron transfer in the supramolecular complex was confirmed by the transient absorption spectra of the ZnTPP–PyNIm complex measured in PhCN using nanosecond laser flash photolysis as shown in Fig. 6. The transient absorption bands observed in Fig. 6 agree with those of superposition of the absorption bands of ZnTPP˙+ (λmax = 618 nm) produced by the one-electron oxidation of ZnTPP with Ru(bpy)33+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) and those of the PyNIm radical anion (λmax = 480, 608, 702 and 779 nm) produced by the one-electron reduction of PyNIm with tetramethylsemiquinone radical anion in PhCN.30 The transient absorption in the 620–700 nm region in Fig. 6 is dominated by those of ZnTPP˙+ due to the large extinction coefficient as compared with those of PyNIm˙−, whereas the transient absorption in the 700–800 nm is ascribed to that due to PyNIm˙−.30 Thus, the transient absorption spectrum in Fig. 6 clearly indicates formation of the CS state [ZnTPP˙+-PyNIm˙−] by photoinduced electron transfer from 1ZnTPP* to PyNIm in the coordination complex.

Fig. 7(a) shows time profiles of the decay of the CS state [ZnTPP˙+-PyNIm˙−] in PhCN using different laser intensities.30 The same slopes in the first-order plots with different laser intensities (Fig. 7(b)) indicate that there is little contribution from the bimolecular charge-recombination (CR) process of free ZnTPP˙+ and PyNIm˙− molecules and that the back electron transfer occurs in the complex.30 The lifetime of the CS state of the coordination complex is determined to be 630 μs at 298 K.30
Thus, the photoexcitation of ZnTPP in the presence of PyNIm mainly results in photoinduced electron transfer from 1ZnTPP* to PyNIm in the complex to produce the long-lived CS state [ZnTPP˙+-PyNIm˙−] in PhCN as shown in Scheme 4.
 Scheme 4  Charge separation and charge recombination in the ZnTPP-PyNIm complex. 
The PyNIm can be attached to a covalently linked ferrocene-zinc porphyrin dyad (Fc-ZnP) by axial coordination to construct a triad (Scheme 5).31 The fluorescence of the zinc porphyrin moiety is efficiently quenched by photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of the zinc porphyrin moiety to the naphthalenediimide moiety. This is followed by subsequent electron transfer from the ferrocene moiety to the zinc porphyrin radical cation to produce the final CS state, ferricenium ion–zinc porphyrin-naphthalenediimide radical anion, which is successfully detected as the transient absorption spectrum in the laser flash photolysis.31 The decay of the CS state obeys first-order kinetics irrespective of the initial concentration of the CS state to afford a long lifetime (320 μs).31

Supramolecular assemblies based on non-planar porphyrin and phthalocyanine
As described above, introduction of pyridine compounds as axial ligands of Zn(II)-porphyrins has been utilized to construct photoinduced charge separation systems. Multi-porphyrin systems as light harvesting units have also been constructed by using template synthesis and self-organization of Zn(II) porphyrins.32,33 However, the axial coordination of pyridine compounds is retarded by coordinating solvents such as MeCN and PhCN, which are normally used to stabilize the CS state. The strength of binding of those ligands can be regulated not only by the basicity of the pyridine nitrogen to control the ability of σ-donation but also the distortion of the porphyrin ligands to regulate the Lewis acidity of the metal center. The Zn(II) complexes of TPP2− (tetraphenylporphyrin dianion) OPP2− (octaphenylporphyrin dianion) and DPP2− (docedaphenylpoprphyrin dianion) showed different degree of distortion of the porphyrin rings.34,35 Among them, the DPP2− ligand exhibited the largest non-planarity as a saddle distortion and the largest displacement of the Zn(II) ion from the porphyrin mean plane.36 The ring distortion should enforce lone pairs of nitrogen atoms in the pyrrole moieties to direct out of plane and this ill-direction of the lone pairs can weaken the interaction between the Zn(II) center and the nitrogen lone pairs to enhance Lewis acidity of the Zn(II) center. Thus, the more the porphyrin ring is distorted, the stronger becomes the Lewis acidity of the Zn(II), leading to the stronger axial coordination.
A saddle-distorted H2DPP has also enabled facile protonation to give a stable diprotonated species, H4DPP2+, which can form intermolecular hydrogen bonding with anionic species and this can act as an electron acceptor exhibiting comparable reduction potentials of C60 and benzoquinones.7,37–42 The characteristics of H4DPP2+ as an electron acceptor have been revealed in porphyrin nanochannels, which are supramolecular assemblies consisting of [H4DPP]Cl2 and electron-donating guest molecules such as hydroquinone derivatives37–39 and in the reaction of the triplet excited state of [H4DPP]Cl2 with a series of electron donors in solution.41
By utilizing the stronger Lewis acidity of Zn(II) in a non-planar Zn(II) complex of saddle-distorted octaphenyl-phthalocyanine (H2OPPc)43 and the facile protonation of H2DPP, a supramolecular electron donor–acceptor assembly has been constructed using H4DPP2+ as an electron acceptor and Zn(OPPc) as an electron donor with 4-pyridine carboxylate (4-PyCOO−) that can connect the donor and acceptor by coordination bond and hydrogen bond (Fig. 8). The reaction of [H4DPP](4-PyCOO)2 with Zn(OPPc) in toluene gave a novel supramolecular assembly, [(H4DPP){Zn(OPPc)(κ1-N-4-PyCOO)}2] (4).44

 Fig. 8  Components of a supramolecular assembly 4. 
The crystal structure of 4 is shown in Fig. 9. The assembly contains one saddle-distorted H4DPP2+ and two saddle-distorted Zn(OPPc) linked by two 4-PyCOO− anions. The bridging 4-PyCOO− coordinates to the Zn(II) center of Zn(OPPc) through the axial coordination of pyridine nitrogen. A remarkable feature of the structure of 4 is two-point hydrogen bonding between H4DPP2+ and 4-PyCOO− to connect the Zn(OPPc) units to the H4DPP2+ moiety. The interatomic distances for those hydrogen bonds are in the range of 2.631(9)–2.725(7) Å,44 which suggests that those hydrogen bonding is fairly strong. The coordination of the pyridine linker is strong enough due to the remarkable saddle distortion of the OPPc2− ligand. The bond lengths of Zn1–N9 and Zn2–N18 are 2.117(3) and 2.140(3) Å, respectively, which are comparable to that found in [Zn(OPPc)(py)].43
 Fig. 9  Crystal structure of 4 with partial numbering scheme: Purple, zinc; red, oxygen; blue, nitrogen; light grey, carbon. Hydrogen atoms and solvent molecules of crystallization are omitted for clarity.44 
The crystal packing of 4 exhibits a one-dimensional nanowire structure into the crystallographic b axis (Fig. 10(a)) by intermolecular π–π interactions of peripheral phenyl groups of the OPPc ligand. The nanowires are extended into the direction of the crystallographic ac plane (Fig. 10(b)) also with intermolecular π–π interactions.
The supramolecular assembly 4 is stable in solution to maintain its structure. 1H diffusion ordered spectroscopy (1H DOSY) spectrum in CDCl3 allowed us to estimate its molecular volume (4849 Å3), which was consistent with that (5096 Å3) calculated on the basis of the crystal structure.44 The stability of 4 in solution can be originated not only from the strong two-point hydrogen bonding between positively charged H4DPP2+ and negatively charged 4-PyCOO− but the strengthened coordination of the nitrogen in 4-PyCOO− to the Zn(II) center with enhanced Lewis acidity within the saddle-distorted OPPc2− ligand.
The two-electron reduction potential of the H4DPP2+ moiety in 4 was determined to be −0.57 V (vs.SCE) and the first oxidation potential of the Zn(OPPc) moiety was determined to be +0.26 V. Thus, the energy of an electron-transfer state of 4 is estimated to be +0.83 eV.44 The energy of the singlet excited states of [H4DPP](4-PyCOO)2 (1.66 eV) is higher than that of [Zn(OPPc)] (1.53 eV), judging from their absorption and fluorescence spectra.44 However, no energy transfer from the singlet excited state of [H4DPP](4-PyCOO)2 to Zn(OPPc) has occurred in the supramolecular complex 4. Although the fluorescence of the H4DPP2+ moiety was totally quenched and no fluorescence due to the [Zn(OPPc)] one was observed.44 This suggests that electron transfer rather than energy transfer occurs from Zn(OPPc) to the singlet excited state of [H4DPP](4-PyCOO)2 in 4.
The occurrence of the photoinduced electron transfer in the supramolecular complex 4 was confirmed by femtosecond laser flash photolysis in PhCN with use of photoexcitation at 410 nm, where both H4DPP2+ and [Zn(OPPc)] moieties can be excited.44 At 4 ps after laser illumination, the formation of the singlet excited state of the H4DPP2+ moiety is detected showing the absorption maximum at 547 and 900 nm (the black trace in Fig. 11). At 150 ps, new absorption bands appeared at 547 and 1030 nm (the red trace in Fig. 10), which were assigned to H4DPP+˙ and [Zn(OPPc+˙)], respectively, based on the spectra of [(H4-DPP+˙)(4-PyCOO)2]− and [Zn(OPPc+˙)] obtained independently.44

The rate constant of the formation of the intrasupramolecular electron-transfer state of 4 ([(H4DPP+˙){Zn(OPPc+˙)(κ1-N-4-PyCOO)}{Zn(OPPc)(κ1-N-4-PyCOO)}]) (4-et) was determined to be 1.6 × 1010 s−1 from the time profile of the rise of the absorption at 1030 nm.44 This electron-transfer state is formed via energy transfer from the singlet excited state of the H4DPP2+ moiety to the [Zn(OPPc)] one within 2.4 ps (4.2 × 1012 s−1).44 The lifetime of 4-et was determined to be 667 ps, which is much longer than that observed in a covalently linked Zn(porphyrin)-Sn(phthalocyanine) dyad reported by Odobel and co-workers.45
The energy diagram of photodynamics of 4 in PhCN by photoexcitation at 410 nm as demonstrated in Scheme 6. The photoirradiation of 4 gives rise to both the singlet excited states of H4DPP2+ and [Zn(OPPc)] moieties, 4-1Por* and 4-1Pc*, respectively. The singlet excited state of H4DPP2+ (1.66 eV) is converted to afford that of [Zn(OPPc)] (1.53 eV) via fast intrasupramolecular energy transfer. This process is followed by intrasupramolecular electron transfer to afford the electron-transfer state 4-et at the energy level of 0.83 eV. This electron-transfer state exhibits the lifetime of 667 ps and goes back to the ground state.

Supramolecular solar cells composed of assemblies of zinc porphyrins and fullerenes
As described in Fig. 10, π–π interactions play an important role in porphyrin assembies.12,46 The π–π interaction also play an important role in formation of interpenetrating network of a two-dimensional large π system (porphyrin) and a three-dimensional large π-system (fullerene).47–51Porphyrin and fullerene tend to make a supramolecular complex in solutions as well as in solid state by π–π interactions.47–51
Zinc porphyrin oligomers with a polypeptidic backbone (zinc porphyrin functionalized α-polypeptides, (P(ZnP)n: n = 1,2,4,8,16 in Fig. 12)13,52 are flexible enough to accommodate C60 between the porphyrin units. Zinc porphyrin-peptide oligomers as well as free base porphyrin-peptide oligomers (P(H2P)n) form π-complexes with fullerenes.53,54 Formation constants (K) of such supramolecular complexes were determined by the UV-vis spectral change of P(ZnP)n and P(H2P)n in the presence of C60 in PhCN.54 The K values for the supramolecular complexes becomes stronger with increasing the number of porphyrins in the porphyrinic polypeptide. When C60 is replaced by C60 derivatives bearing either imidazole and pyridine coordinating ligands, the K values of P(ZnP)16–C60Im and P(ZnP)16–C60Py systems become much larger than that of P(ZnP)16–C60 system due to the π–π interaction between porphyrins and fullerenes plus axial coordination to zinc porphyrin in P(ZnP)16.54 The largest K value (7.9 × 106 mol−1 dm3) was obtained for the P(ZnP)16–C60Im complex.54
 Fig. 12  Zinc porphyrin–peptide oligomers and fullerene derivatives. 
The change of chiral helix structure of P(ZnP)16 by the supramolecular complex formation with C60 is shown as the change in circular dichroism (CD) spectra of P(ZnP)16 in the presence of various concentration of C60.54 The CD spectrum of a PhCN solution of P(ZnP)16 (Fig. 13: blue line) shows cotton effect originating from the porphyrin Soret band at 428 nm. The intensity of the signal corresponding to the Soret band of P(ZnP)16 decreases with increasing the concentration of C60.54 This indicates that structures in P(ZnP)16 are less ordered due to formation of the supramolecular complex between porphyrins and C60.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of P(ZnP)16 (6.1 × 10−6 mol dm−3 based on one porphyrin unit) in the presence of various concentration of C60 (0 to 1.0 × 10−4 mol dm−3) in PhCN. 
As porphyrin-peptide oligomers form the supramolecular complexes with C60, the fluorescence of porphyrins was quenched by intracomplex electron transfer from the singlet excited state of the porphyrin moiety to C60.54 The apparent formation constant determined from the fluorescence quenching is significantly larger than that determined from the UV-vis spectral change.54 This indicates that the excited energy migration between the porphyrin units occurs efficiently prior to the electron transfer.
In an acetonitrile–toluene mixed solvent system these supramolecular complexes aggregate to form clusters of diameter 100–200 nm.53,54 Upon subjecting the resultant cluster suspension to a high electric dc field (500 V cm−1 for 1 min), mixed porphyrin-peptide oligomers [P(H2P)n or P(ZnP)n] and C60clusters [(P(H2P)n+C60)m or (P(ZnP)n+C60)m] were deposited onto an optically transparent electrode (OTE) of a nanostructured SnO2electrode (OTE/SnO2), to give modified electrodes [denoted as (P(H2P)n+C60)m or (P(ZnP)n+C60)m (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)].54
Photoelectrochemical measurements of these modified electrodes were performed with a standard two-electrode system consisting of a working electrode and a Pt wire gauze electrode in 0.5 mol dm−3NaI and 0.01 mol dm−3 I2 in air-saturated acetonitrile.54 The incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) increases with increasing C60 concentration (0 to 0.31 mmol dm−3 in acetonitrile–toluene) at a constant concentration of P(H2P)8 (0.024 mmol dm−3).51 This indicates that efficient electron-transfer from the excited state of porphyrin to C60 occurs, leading to efficient photocurrent generation.54 The IPCE value of (P(ZnP)n+C60)m modified electrodes exhibits a remarkable increase with increasing number of porphyrin moieties in a polypeptide unit as shown in Fig. 14(A).54 The maximum IPCE of (P(ZnP)16+C60)m is determined to be 56% at 480 nm.
 Fig. 14  (A) The photocurrent action spectra of (a) (P(ZnP)16+C60)m, (b) (P(ZnP)8+C60)m, (c) (P(ZnP)4+C60)m, (d) (P(ZnP)2+C60) and (e) (P(ZnP)1+C60)m modified electrodes. (B) The photocurrent action spectra of (a) (P(ZnP)16+C60Im)m, (b) (P(ZnP)16+C60Py)m and (c) (P(ZnP)16+C60)m modified OTE/SnO2electrodes. 
The photocurrent generation in Fig. 14 is initiated by photoinduced charge separation from the zinc porphyrin excited singlet state in the porphyrin-peptide oligomer to C60 in the zinc porphyrin-peptide oligomer-C60 complex rather than direct electron injection to conduction band of SnO2 system.54 The reduced C60 injects electrons into the SnO2 nanocrystallites, whereas the oxidized porphyrin undergoes the electron-transfer reduction with the iodide in the electrolyte system.
The increase in the IPCE values with increasing the number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit in both (P(H2P)n+C60)m and (P(ZnP)n+C60)m is indicative of the fact that efficient photoinduced electron-transfer occurs from excited state of the porphyrin unit to C60 in the supramolecular complex with increasing the number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit. This trend is in good agreement with the results of association constants between porphyrins and C60 based on absorption and fluorescence spectral changes. The maximum IPCE value of (P(ZnP)16+C60)m (56%) is greater than that of (P(H2P)16+C60)m (48%).54 This may be ascribed to driving force for photoinduced electron transfer or the energy level of triplet excited state of porphyrin.54
The IPCE spectra of (P(ZnP)16+C60Im)m and (P(ZnP)16+ C60Py)m modified electrodes are compared with that of (P(ZnP)16+C60)m in order to examine the effect of coordination bond of C60 derivatives on IPCE as shown in Fig. 14(B).54 The maximum IPCE values of (P(ZnP)16+C60Py)m and (P(ZnP)16+ C60Im)m are 20% and 15%, respectively. These values are much smaller than that of (P(ZnP)16+C60)m (56%), whereas the binding constant of P(ZnP)16-C60 is smaller than those of P(ZnP)16-C60Im and P(ZnP)16-C60Py.54 The lower IPCE values of P(ZnP)16-C60Im and P(ZnP)16-C60Py systems as compared with that of P(ZnP)16-C60 system may result from the poor electron transport properties of C60 derivatives due to the steric hindrance of the ligand moiety (Fig. 14(B)). Thus, a key factor for efficient photocurrent generation is mainly the hole and electron transport in the thin film rather than the charge separation between porphyrins and C60.
Summary and outlook
As demonstrated in this Perspective of metallomacrocycles such as metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines can be readily linked with electron acceptors by axial coordination bonds to form donor–acceptor complexes that undergo efficient charge separation upon photoexcitation to attain long-lived CS states. The combination of hydrogen bond and π–π interactions with coordination bonds has made it possible to construct supramolecular assemblies of light harvesting and charge separation units, which will provide promising perspective for the development of efficient light energy conversion systems.
