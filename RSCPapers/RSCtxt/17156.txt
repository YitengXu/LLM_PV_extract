    , Accepted 9th October 2020First published on 9th October 2020AbstractThe electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to eliminate excess CO2 and produce fuels/chemicals under mild conditions provides a sustainable way to maintain carbon balance and alleviate the energy shortage. However, the low current density, competitive H2 evolution reaction and uncontrollable product distribution are urgent to be solved. Benefiting from the well-defined active centers in single atom catalysts (SACs), the coordination bond, bond length/angle, etc. can be modulated to affect the selectivity/activity towards the CO2RR, which relies on electron transfer, adsorption states and so on. Hence, an in-depth summary about the regulation of the coordination structure for the CO2RR is significant and pressing. This review concentrates on the manipulation of central atoms and coordination atoms on carbon and other supports in SACs for the CO2RR. As a prototype, a definitive correlation between the structure and XAFS spectra characteristics was properly decoded. Then, the influence of the coordination atoms and coordination number on the current density, reduction products, reaction path, etc., is highlighted. Finally, prospects such as identification of the coordination structure, machine learning, fine adjustment of the coordination atoms and control of the product distribution were put forward. This Review contributes profound insights for the rational design of the coordination structure towards highly efficient and even guided electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.

Broader context
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) under ambient conditions using clean electric energy provides a potential solution to alleviate the negative effects derived from excessive CO2 and produce value-added carbonaceous fuels. However, the high activation energy of the CO bond and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) seriously reduce the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process. Fortunately, the currently emerging single atom catalysts (SACs) have achieved regulated catalytic performance at the atomic scale. This review is aimed at the coordination structures, catalytic paths and properties of advanced SACs for the CO2RR. The coordination configurations and diverse reduction products as well as their correlations are especially emphasized. Furthermore, the existing challenges and research directions are rationally proposed. We hope that this Review will provide a comprehensive summary and profound understanding about the relationship between the coordination structure and CO2RR performance, which may enrich the design of efficient SACs for the CO2RR and extend the distribution of reduction products.

1. Introduction
The over-consumption of fossil fuels results in the excessive emission of CO2 on the Earth. Effective CO2 conversion as well as utilization strategies are necessary to maintain carbon-neutral balance and alleviate the energy shortage.1–3 Besides, the atmosphere of Mars is more than 96% CO2. The utilization of CO2 resources for Mars exploration has attracted much attention. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) under ambient conditions using clean electric energy from solar, wind, hydro and ocean energy etc, which not only alleviates the negative effects derived from excessive CO2,4 but also produces value-added carbonaceous fuels, is regarded as one of the most promising strategies.5,6 However, due to the stability of linear molecules and the robust CO bonds, a high reaction barrier needs to be overcome to activate CO2.7–12 In the meantime, the electrocatalytic CO2RR involves complicated coupling processes of multiple protons and electrons to generate a wide reduction product distribution from C1 to C3.13–16 Undergoing a reduction process of two electron transfer, CO (CO2 + 2e− + 2H+ → CO + H2O) and formic acid (CO2 + 2e− + 2H+ → HCOOH) have achieved relatively high reduction current density and selectivity.17 Yet, the selectivity of deep reduction products, which is accompanied by multi-electron transfer, including methanol (CO2 + 6e− + 6H+ → CH3OH + H2O), ethylene (2CO2 + 12e− + 12H+ → C2H4 + 4H2O), ethanol (2CO2 + 12e− + 12H+ → CH3CH2OH + 3H2O), propanol (3CO2 + 18e− + 18H+ → C3H7OH + 5H2O), methane (CO2 + 8e− + 8H+ → CH4 + 2H2O), etc., is still unsatisfactory.18–20 To a large extent, the efficiency and pathway of the electrocatalytic CO2RR are decided by the catalysts on the electrode surface due to their diverse interactions with CO2 molecules. So far, the structure–performance relationship towards the CO2RR is still complicated and unclear. Researchers pointed out that the local physical/chemical properties of catalysts (such as morphologies, crystal facets, valence states, etc.) as well as the local pH, electrolyte, and electrode structure all influence the final reduction performance.21,22 Additionally, in aqueous medium (alkali metal bicarbonate solution), since the equilibrium potentials of CO2 reduction are within the range of about +0.3 to −0.5 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode), the competitive H2 evolution reaction (HER) could also take place to reduce the reaction selectivity.23–25 Hence, highly efficient catalysts are urgently required to accelerate the occurrence of the CO2RR.26,27
Single atom catalysts (SACs), as one type of attractive heterogeneous catalysts,28–30 show unique advantages in electrocatalysis.31–33 With maximum atomic utilization, SACs consist of independently separated metal single atoms (SAs) bonded with coordination atoms on various supports.34–40 Compared to traditional heterogeneous catalysts, which expose various crystal facets and surface catalytic sites, the active sites in SACs are homogeneously dispersed. These catalytic species exist in a similar chemical environment, hence displaying analogous catalytic behavior.41,42 Aiming at the CO2RR, the well-defined active centers in SACs have the potential to reduce the diversity of reaction paths or weaken the HER. Applying SACs in the CO2RR field to regulate the product distribution is meaningful whether in terms of increasing productivity or saving costs.43,44 Generally, the coordination structure of SACs mainly involves central atoms, the type and number of surrounding coordination atoms, the bond length and bond angle, etc.45,46 They are seriously affected by the metal sources, supports, molecular modification and external factors (test conditions, etc.). In most cases, due to the unsaturated coordination structure, central atoms which provide suitable adsorption/desorption sites for reaction intermediates serve as active centers.47–49 Sometimes, the reconstruction of SACs happens during the catalytic process, which results in changed active components from SAs to nanoparticles/clusters. The rational construction of the coordination structure endows SACs with incomparable advantages in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.50–52 Even for the same active metal center, slight changes in the coordination structure can cause significant differences in the reaction trends and product distribution. The reported central atoms for the electrocatalytic CO2RR and coordination atoms are summarized in Fig. 1a. Obviously, towards the CO2RR, there is plenty of space to develop more efficient SACs. In Fig. 1b, three representative active centers which applied carbon materials, alloys and chalcogenides as supports are respectively presented. Single metal atoms trapped and anchored in carbon-based materials act as the most common SACs in electrocatalysis. Doping elements (N, S etc.) are usually necessary to stabilize SAs and adjust the catalytic properties. For SA modified chalcogenide compounds (coordination atoms include metals, O, S, Se etc.) and single atom alloys (central atoms mainly coordinated with metal atoms), the activity or selectivity of supports could be modulated by SAs.53–55 Various supports will bring diversified geometric and electronic structure of the coordination configurations.

Fig. 2a summarizes the commonly used characterization techniques for SACs and the evaluation parameters of the CO2RR. A low overpotential, large current density, high Faraday efficiency (FE) and robust cyclic stability of catalysts are expected. At the theoretical level, the Gibbs free energy, density of states and d-band center are generally applied for theoretical calculations. At present, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) are the most commonly used techniques to reveal the coordination structure.56,57 For XPS, the coordination element and the valence state of central atoms could be preliminary obtained through the fitting of peaks. Element-specific XAFS spectroscopy, including extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), is short-range order sensitive and has proved to be a unique powerful probe for local structure and chemical state identification.58 Specifically, Fourier transformed (FT) EXAFS provides quantitative atomic-level structural information about the local environment, i.e., the near-neighbor species, interatomic distance, coordination number, structural disorder and thermal motions surrounding the absorbing center.59 XANES can distinguish the electronic state and the three-dimensional coordination geometry (including the symmetry, atom types, and bond angles and distances).

Taking the well-defined atomic Fe–nitrogen moieties embedded in carbon (Fe–N–C) for example, the DFT calculation-optimized structure model indicated that the FeN4 moiety underwent gradual continuous symmetry breaking with C incorporation. As a result, for the highly regular geometry of FeN4, the interference effects between different paths can conspire to produce the most intense white line peak “A” as shown by the XANES simulation in Fig. 2b. Meanwhile, the chemically induced Fe–N/C bond length contraction from FeN4 to FeN3C1 and FeN2C2 mainly accounts for an obvious higher-energy edge shift with the aid of shell by shell analysis (Fig. 2c and d). For the FT EXAFS spectra in Fig. 2e, the FeN4 sample exhibits a major peak at ca. 1.50 Å and a minor signal at 2.02 Å, which were ascribed to first shell Fe–N and second shell Fe–C, respectively. For FeN3C1 and FeN2C2, a detailed average Fe–N/C bond length contraction of ∼0.05 Å can be well-resolved.
Furthermore, in situ techniques, which could identify the structure transformation during catalysis process, are critical to discover the underlying mechanism. For instance, in situ Raman spectrum, EXAFS and XANES could reveal the bonding or valence changes during the reaction process. The definition of intermediates and active configurations is helpful to realize the real reaction path. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) based on first principles can be employed to calculate the reaction free energy towards the elementary steps and even further guide coordination structure manipulation.60,61 For example, Cai and co-workers62 constructed a series of transition metal SAs on porphyrin-like graphene and screened their CO2RR performance via calculating the adsorption strength of the intermediates. The results provide important references for experimental design. Although we have the assistance of the above-mentioned characterization methods, it is still not easy to discover the influence of the coordination structure on the CO2 reduction mechanism. Thereupon, to enhance the development of SACs in the CO2RR, deep understanding of the coordination structure is pressingly urgent and challenging. However, a related Review about the relationship between the coordination structure and CO2 reduction is rare.
In this Review, firstly, the typical coordination configurations and common characterization techniques are summarized. Particularly, as a prototype, a definitive correlation between the structure and XAFS spectra characteristics was properly decoded for a monodisperse atomic transition metal embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene with a common MNxC4−x moiety. Then the manipulation of central atoms and coordination atoms in SACs on carbon and other supports is summarized. Especially, the influence of the coordination atoms and coordination number on the current density, reduction products, reaction path, etc., is discussed. The reconstruction of SACs during the CO2RR is also included. Finally, aiming at efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on SACs, prospects and challenges are put forward.
2. Regulating central atoms
Different metals exhibit distinct preferences for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction products.63 Precious metals Au and Ag tend to reduce CO2 to CO,64–66 while Sn and Bi generally reduce CO2 to HCOOH.67,68 Cu-Based materials are currently the most efficient catalysts that achieve a deep CO2RR to C1–C3 fuels (C2H4, CH4, CH3OH, CH3COCH3etc.) due to their moderate CO2 adsorption ability.69–72 The adjustment of both central atoms and coordination atoms promotes the diversification of the coordination structure.73–79 The central metal atoms in SACs may display the similar CO2 reduction direction to their nano-scale metal electrode, which indicates their intrinsic activities. Through fine coordination structure regulation, the product distribution of metal SAs could also be controlled.
In general, Cu-based SACs display a deep CO2 reduction ability to liquid fuels. Very recently, the reversible conversion of Cu SAs to particles/clusters during catalysis has been discovered. In Fontecave et al.'s80 work, isolated Cu SAs (1.4 wt%) on an N-doped carbon matrix presented a 2+ oxidation state and coordinated with 4 N atoms to form Cu–N4 active centers. Cu0.5NC was deposited on a gas diffusion layer (GDL) and then tested in 0.1 M CsHCO3. At 1.2 V, with flowing CO2 in a closed setup, the obtained FECH3CH2OH of 55% surpassed the value of 43% yielded under flow conditions. The improved FECH3CH2OH could be attributed to the further reduction of CO to CH3CH2OH. Operando XANES and EXAFS showed that Cu nanoparticles appeared during the electrocatalytic process, which served as active species (Fig. 3a and b). Surprisingly, after electrolysis, such a particle structure restored to the initial SA form. No dissolved Cu atoms in the electrolyte were found, which indicated the strong chelation between Cu atoms and N4 sites. Similar conclusions were also obtained by Xu and co-workers.81 The dynamically reversible conversion between Cu SAs and clusters was disclosed by operando XAS. At the reduction potentials, the Cu3 or Cu4 clusters served as the main active species to achieve a high FECH3CH2OH of 91% (−0.7 V). After removing the applied voltage, the clusters were oxidized to the initial Cu SAs. Additionally, they displayed stable catalytic activity and could continuously catalyze CO2 reduction for more than 16 h at −0.7 V. It is particularly noteworthy that the reversible transformation between nanoparticles/clusters and SAs in the CO2RR helps us understand the true active sites. Noticably, the intrinsic deep reduction ability of Cu atoms for the CO2RR cannot be ignored. Regarding single Cu atoms as the cores, adjusting the coordination structure and investigating the reversible reconstruction under a negative reduction voltage to achieve C2+ product generation are important research areas.

As for other transition metal-based SACs, single Ni atoms exhibited relatively high CO2 reduction activity to CO.82–84 Li and co-workers85 constructed low-valence Ni SAs with 1+ valence on N,S-doped graphene, achieving a TOF of 14800 h−1 towards CO at an overpotential of 0.61 V. As proved by operando photoelectron spectroscopy, electrons transferred from the Ni SAs to adsorbed CO2 molecules to form CO2δ− species. The reduced Ni 3d density of states and the down-shifted valence band edge also verified this charge transfer, which was regarded as an advantageous process for reducing the energy barrier of the CO2RR. It is feasible to advance the current density using a flow cell with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to mitigate the kinetic constraints of the CO2RR.86 Possessing both catalytically active species and gas diffusion capacity, Ni SAs on a carbon fiber membrane with favorable flexibility and a hierarchical porous structure (NiSA/PCFM) were directly applied as a GDE (Fig. 3c).87 The assembled flow cell achieved a satisfactory CO current density of 308.4 mA cm−2 and an FECO of 88% at −1.0 V, which could keep stable after a 100 h potentiostatic test (Fig. 3d and e). Furthermore, scaling up the catalyst loading or the size of the GDE will further increase the current density of CO2 reduction. Wang and colleagues88 integrated Ni SACs into a modular cell (10 × 10 cm−2). A current up to 8.3 A accompanied by an FECO of 98.4% was displayed. As seen, although the reduction products of Ni based SACs were limited to CO, the reduction current density has achieved a level of hundreds of milliamperes, while the selectivity approached 100% in a large voltage window. Obviously, the large current density improved the yield, and the high selectivity was beneficial to simplify the subsequent purification steps. Hence, it is credible that large-scale CO production via the CO2RR is feasible in the near future.
Even in similar coordination environments, different active metal centers induce unequal activity/selectivity towards the CO2RR.89 To illustrate the influence of the central atoms on the selectivity, a direct comparison between Co and Ni SAs was carried out by Jiang et al.53 Whether in an H-cell or a flow cell, Ni-NG showed dominant CO selectivity rather than the HER (Fig. 3f). The maximum FECO values were both higher than 95%. In contrast, the governing HER occurred when Co-NG served as the cathode catalyst (Fig. 3g). Theoretical analysis indicated that both Ni and Co sites bonded with COOH* strongly, and the CO desorption barriers affected the reaction rate. Compared to Co SAs, the CO desorption barriers of Ni SAs were much lower, thus improving the CO-poisoning resistance and promoting the CO generation rate. The desorption barrier diagram of CO also indicated the outstanding CO2RR performance on Ni–N/C sites. Similarly, Jiao and colleagues90 prepared a series of MOF derived carbon-based SACs (M–N4) with almost identical structural parameters (particle sizes, surface area, pore structure, and graphitization degree) except for diverse metal centers (Ni, Fe, Co, and Cu). Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations indicated that Ni1–N–C presented the most suitable ability to reduce CO2 to CO. The FECO and TOFCO of other M–N4 centers were obviously degraded (Fig. 3h). The different reduction products (CO or H2) directly prove the effects of central atom regulation on the reaction selectivity.
At negative reduction potentials, Pd favorably transfers to a PdH structure, which displays both CO2RR and HER activities.91–93 The construction of Pd SAs on N-doped carbon (Pd–NC) not only saves the scarce reserves of precious metal Pd, but also suppressed this unfavorable transition in selectivity.94 The calculations of formation energies showed that the Pd–N4 coordination structure was thermodynamically more favorable than Pd–NC3, Pd–N2C2 and Pd–N3C, consistent with the experimental results. The bond energy towards *H, *HOCO or *CO showed favorable formation of *HOCO and desorption of *CO on Pd–N4 sites, hence demonstrating prioritized CO2RR activity. Pd–NC displayed an FECO of 55% (−0.5 V) and a higher partial current density of CO, better than those of commercial Pd/C (Fig. 3i). At −0.8 V, the mass activity was 373.0 mA mg−1. As a result, the atomic Pd–N4 center displayed superiority in CO selectivity via inhibiting the formation of the adverse PdH structure.
Main group metals (such as Sn, Sb, and Bi) and their compounds have displayed convincing CO2 reduction ability to HCOOH.95,96 Snδ+ coordinated with two C atoms and two N atoms on N-doped graphene was synthesized by Xie and co-workers97 (Fig. 4a). Due to the bonding interaction, the charge density of Sn atoms moved towards graphene, which resulted in positively charged Snδ+ centers. In 0.25 M KHCO3, the largest FEHCOOH of 74.3% was achieved at −1.6 V versus SCE, and the TOF was 11930 h−1 (−1.8 V) (Fig. 4b). Besides, continuous electrolysis for 200 h without an obvious decay in FE was demonstrated (Fig. 4c). Verified by in situ FTIR analysis, the positively charged Sn atoms stabilized CO2˙−* and HCOO−* intermediates. The CO2 activation and protonation processes were facilitated spontaneously, consistent with Gibbs free energy calculations. To improve the HCOOH selectivity of Sb-based materials, Wang and his co-workers98 constructed Sbδ+–N4 active sites on ultra-thin graphene-like carbon, which showed an FEHCOOH of 94% at −0.8 V. In situ EXAFS and XANES suggested a changed valence state of Sn atoms and bond length of Sb–N bonds during the CO2RR. Thus, the Sbδ+–N4 sites served as the active species, consistent with the result of the SCN− ion poison experiment. Different to Sn and Sb, Bi SAs turned the CO2 reduction product from HCOOH to CO.99 In Li's work,100 Bi–N4 sites on N-doped carbon were synthesized via pyrolysis of Bi–MOFs. NH3 played key roles in the atomization of Bi nanoparticles. Presenting a valence state between 0 and 3+, the Bi SACs achieved a maximum FECO up to 97% at −0.5 V (Fig. 4d). Gibbs free energy diagrams showed a low energy barrier for *COOH formation, suggesting a low onset potential and enhanced CO2 reduction performance. Additionally, Zn SAs also displayed a different reduction product of CH4 rather than traditional CO.101 Zn–N4 displayed an FECH4 of 85% at −1.8 V vs. SCE. The current density (−39.9 mA cm−2) and FE (over 84%) could be maintained for more than 35 h. Simultaneously, due to the suppression of CO formation, the poisoning of Zn sites was weakened. DFT calculations showed that the central Zn atoms preferentially bonded with O atoms in CO2 to form *OCHO rather than *COOH intermediates. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy also proved the existence of *OCH3 and *OCH2 intermediates during the CO2 reduction process. Hence, the Zn–N4 centers are inclined to produce CH4, while the by-products (CO, HCOOH, or CH3OH) were effectively suppressed. In the above two studies, the metal SAs presented completely different reduction products compared to their nano-scale counterparts. The difference in the reduction product reflects that the variation of the coordination structure of SACs changes the surface adsorption sites and intermediates.

In the aspect of calculations, Jung et al.102 systematically predicted the CO2RR performance of transition metal-based SAs (Ag, Au, Co, Cu, Fe, Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh or Ru) supported on TiC (or TiN). These SAs were inserted into the surface defect sites of TiC. Among them, Ir-doped TiC (Ir@d-TiC) displayed a very low limiting potential of −0.09 V (Fig. 4e). Because of the weakened *CO binding on Ir SAs compared to bare TiC and the bulk Ir(111) surface, Ir@d-TiC showed the lowest overpotential compared to the other investigated metal atoms, which helped to selectively produce CH4. This work suggests the potential of Ir-based SAs for the CO2RR, which is beneficial for direct subsequent active configuration design.
To sum up, the developed metal centers for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and their diverse products are concluded in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the main reduction products are closely related to the choice of the central atom. CO is still the main CO2 reduction product. Deep reduction products are mainly limited to Cu-based SACs. From this point, special attention should also be paid to the delicate design of other metal centers to achieve deep CO2 reduction to obtain high-value C2+ products. It is noteworthy that to finely adjust the CO2 reduction product dispersion, engineering of coordination atoms is not only necessary but also effective.

3. Coordination atoms on carbon-based supports
It is certain that the coordination atoms stabilizing central atoms on supports could also affect the CO2RR activity and selectivity.103 Due to the high conductivity, abundant porous structure and adjustable atomic doping, carbon-based materials serve as the main supports for SACs in the electrocatalytic field.104–107 Suitable support modifications not only facilitate rapid CO2 diffusion but also provide coordination atoms to anchor metal SAs more feasibly.108–110 It is worth noting that pyrolysis of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) is currently an important strategy to produce carbon-supported SAs.111,112 Through the fine modulation of the precursor composition and preparation process, the type and number of coordination atoms could be tuned, subsequently leading to a change in the CO2 reduction activity and selectivity.
The difference in the coordination environment can be reflected in the density of active sites. To achieve the regulation of the product distribution, Zheng et al.113 tuned the concentration of Cu–Nx sites on N-doped carbon by changing the pyrolysis temperature of the MOF precursors (Fig. 6a and b). Cu–N–C-800 prepared at 800 °C achieved a relatively high metal loading of 4.9 mol%. The active centers involved adjacent Cu–N2 and separated Cu–N4. Such highly dense Cu–N2 active sites enabled C–C coupling to produce C2H4 with an FE of 24.8% at −1.4 V, which was higher than the value (13.9%) of CH4. When the density of Cu–Nx sites dropped to 2.4 mol% obtained at 900 °C, C–C coupling became difficult between separated Cu–N2 sites. Thus, CH4 was the dominant reduction product with an FE of 38.6% at −1.6 V (Fig. 6c). Calculation results also confirmed the optimized free energy on neighboring Cu–N2 sites to produce C2H4. In this work, the density of active sites led to different reaction products of the CO2RR on Cu-based species, which demonstrated the influence of tuning the distance between neighboring active sites.

In addition to the effect on the active site density, the coordination number could also be adjusted by changing the pyrolysis temperature. Wu et al.114 synthesized atomically dispersed Co SAs on N-doped porous carbon with different coordination numbers (Co–N4, Co–N3 or Co–N2) via varying the pyrolysis temperature (Fig. 6d). Co–N2 catalyzed the CO2RR to generate a total current density of 18.1 mA cm−2 at −0.63 V and an FECO of 95% at −0.68 V (Fig. 6e), which were far superior to what Co–N3 and Co–N4 displayed. Co–N2 also derived a record-high TOF (18200 h−1) and satisfactory stability at −0.63 V, which could endure continuous operation for 60 h with negligible current density decay and an invariable FE. The authors proposed that the low-coordinate Co atoms possessed more unoccupied 3d orbitals, which bonded with CO2 easily and promoted the reduction rate. The calculations of the Gibbs free energy (Fig. 6f) and d-band center also verified the boosted CO2RR and suppressed HER on Co–N2. The impact of the coordination number on the CO2RR is complex. In Chen's work,115 high-coordinate Co–N5/HNPCSs from pyrolytic SiO2@melamine–resorcinol–formaldehyde at 700 °C catalyzed CO2 to CO with an FE of 99.2% at −0.73 V. Reducing the pyrolysis temperature to produce Co–N3 or Co–N4 sites caused a decrement in the FE. Yao et al.116 also showed that the Co1–N4 active centers possessed larger current density, FECO and TOF than those of Co1–N4−xCx with fewer coordination N atoms. By means of diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), they pointed out that Co1–N4 bonded with CO2 more strongly, thus increasing the CO2 adsorption and reduction capacity. Thus, the impact of the coordination structure on the CO2RR performance was still ambiguous, and more efforts are urgently required.
Apart from the coordination number of N atoms, the types of coordinated N atoms also affect the valence of the central atom and final electrocatalytic performance.117 Through replacing the pyrolysis precursors, atomically dispersed Fe3+ sites and Fe2+ sites were successfully anchored on N-doped carbon by Chen and his co-workers.118 The central Fe3+ atoms in Fe3+–N–C coordinated with pyrrolic N, which derived a higher TOF and stability than those Fe2+ atoms coordinating with pyridinic N in Fe2+–N–C. Fe3+–N–C achieved an FECO higher than 80% under a reduction potential from −0.2 to −0.5 V, and the current density of CO reached 20 mA cm−2 at −0.47 V. The current density kept stable at −0.37 V for at least 12 h. However, when the potential dropped to −0.5 V or more negative, the CO2 reduction activity seriously decreased. Such performance degradation can be attributed to the rearrangement of the coordination structure. The N atoms coordinated with Fe SAs transformed from initial pyrrolic N into pyridinic N, accompanied by a decreased coordination number from 4 to 3 (Fig. 6g). Hence, the pyrrolic N played critical roles in maintaining the 3+ valence state of Fe3+ during the catalytic process, which promoted CO2 adsorption and weakened CO adsorption.
A similar effect originating from the type of coordination N atoms was also proved by Cu SAs on N-doped carbon obtained in N2 (Cu-SA/NPC) and Ar (Cu-SA/NPCAr) atmospheres.119 For the former, the main CO2 reduction product was acetone, which achieved a maximum production rate of 336.1 μg h−1 at −0.76 V (Fig. 6h) and a maximum FE of 36.7% at −0.36 V. However, Cu-SA/NPCAr displayed a degraded acetone production rate and FE. XPS results revealed higher pyridinic N and lower pyrrolic N contents in Cu-SA/NPCAr (Fig. 6i), confirming the effects of the N type. However, the uncoordinated pyrrolic N atoms had poor acetone production ability. The elementary steps occurring on Cu–pyrrolic-N4 sites, including COOH* formation and C–C coupling, showed more favorable free energy than those on Cu–pyridinic-N4 sites. As a result, the Cu–pyrrolic-N4 centers were regarded as the governing active species for acetone production.
It is a remarkable fact that a dual-coordination strategy provides more opportunity to modulate the electronic structure of central atoms.109 Zhang et al.120 constructed single Mn atoms ((Cl,N)–Mn/G) which coordinated with four N atoms and a halogen Cl atom. (Cl,N)–Mn/G showed a current density (−10 mA cm−2), FE (97%) and TOF (38347 h−1) towards CO at an overpotential of 0.49 V which all exceeded the values of N-coordinated Mn SAs (−3.6 mA cm−2, 17% and 744 h−1). During the CO2RR, the Cl atoms resulted in distorted Mn centers. The obvious electron transfer from COOH* to (Cl,N)–Mn/G also proved the strong interactions between the additional Cl coordination and Mn SAs. As a result, both CO2/COOH* adsorption and CO desorption were facilitated, which was consistent with the result of the free energy profiles. So, this dual-coordination strategy design can be extended to other elements.
Briefly, due to the easy-to-adjust coordination atoms and low requirement for synthesis equipment, carbon-based supports in SACs have been widely investigated. The regulation of the coordination structure is mainly manifested in the unequal density of active sites, and the different types and number of coordinating atoms. These regulation measurements changed the surrounding environment of the active sites, the valence of the central atoms etc., thus influencing the subsequent reduction tendency and C–C coupling. Development of more supports to tune the coordination configuration is worth expecting.
4. Coordination atoms on other supports
Different from SAs supported on carbon-based materials, of which the coordination atoms are mainly carbon atoms and doped atoms such as N, P or S atoms,121,122 oxides, alloys, chalcogenides, etc. bring richer coordination atom design and more opportunities.123–128 Recently, Zheng et al.129 investigated single Cu sites on CeO2 nanorods. Theoretical predictions indicated that the doped Cu in CeO2 will introduce three surrounding oxygen vacancies (VO). Adsorption and activation energy calculation results further demonstrated accelerated CO2 activation on Cu sites with surrounding VO. Subsequently, single Cu atoms were anchored on CeO2 nanorods with abundant VO. The peak shift in XANES suggested a lower oxidation state (Cu1+) of Cu atoms in the CeO2 supports (Fig. 7a). Cu–O coordination was detected in Cu–CeO2-4% (Fig. 7b). The coordination number of Cu atoms was fitted to be 4.8, which was lower than that of the initial Ce atoms in the CeO2 surface (6) and bulk (8). Such low coordinated Cu sites successfully proved the existence of abundant VO (up to 3). Cu–CeO2-4% showed a higher CO2RR current density than Cu nanoparticles and pure CeO2 nanorods. The maximum FECH4 reached 58% at −1.8 V (Fig. 7c). The Cu sites with Vo can strongly adsorb CO2 molecules and deeply reduce them to CH4. This work displays the synergetic effect between Cu sites and defective CeO2, which optimized the coordination structure to lead to deep CO2 reduction.

Recently, tandem electrocatalysis has attracted great attention.130–133 For the CO2RR, the generated abundant CO* on the catalyst surface can be further reduced to high-value fuels. Based on calculations, Head-Gordon and colleagues134 filtered various metal SAs (Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt, Co, Rh, and Ir) as candidates in the (111) and (100) surfaces of Au or Ag. According to their assumptions, coupling of central atoms with suitable supports (Au or Ag) could constitute a tandem catalytic system. CO2 molecules were first converted to CO by Au/Ag, and then further deeply reduced to hydrocarbons. After calculating ΔG*COH, ΔG*CHO and ΔG*H, most of the single atom alloys exhibited preferential CO2RR activity rather than the HER. Among them, Rh@Au(100) and Rh@Ag(100) achieved deep CO2 reduction to CH4 through different reaction paths. Hence, rational support design is still necessary to enlarge the select range of coordination atoms, which is important to adjust the CO2RR products. It can be imagined that the construction of single atom alloys can be extended to other metals to obtain more C2+ products. Predicting a series of combinations between different metals through calculations will improve the efficiency of material design. However, related theoretical and experimental studies aiming at C2+ products have not yet been reported.
Realizing the interaction between central atoms and the support is imperative but knotty.135,136 Construction of composite supports is an effective way. Since the Fe–N sites present strong *CO adsorption,137 maintaining a high FECO in a large potential window remains difficult to solve. Bao et al.138 prepared a stable coupling structure between Fe–N–C sites and cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) to achieve synergistic catalysis. Electrons transferred from Fe–N–C sites to CoPc molecules (Fig. 7d). Compared with single Fe–N–C catalysts, CoPc©Fe–N–C exhibited a 10-fold higher current density of 275.6 mA cm−2 at −0.84 V in a flow cell containing 0.5 M KOH. The FECO was above 90% in a large potential window from −0.13 to −0.84 V (Fig. 7e and f). Theoretical calculations showed that both Fe and Co sites had active CO2 conversion capacity. After introducing CoPc on Fe–N–C, the adsorption energy towards *CO and H* was reduced. As a result, CoPc efficiently accelerated CO desorption, which decreased *CO poisoning and preserved robust catalytic stability.
Here, we summarize the reported supports in SACs used for the CO2RR (Fig. 8). Compared with the central atom, the adjustment ranges of coordination atoms are more diverse. At present, attempts on non-carbon supports towards the CO2RR are still scarce. Delicate structure design, including the type and space configuration of supports, defects, heteroatoms, interface modulation, etc. is necessary. It is worth mentioning that tandem catalysis happening between central atoms and coordination atoms in single atom alloys is also meaningful. Guided by calculations, these beneficial attempts undoubtedly broaden the regulation range of the coordination structure and catalytic properties.

5. Conclusions and outlook
In all, regulation of the coordination structure, including the central atoms and coordination atoms via support design and composite support synergy, can engineer the CO2 reduction selectivity and activity of SACs to a large extent. We summarize the most recent coordination structures in SACs for the CO2RR (Table 1). The maximum FE and current density at the corresponding voltage are specially plotted in Fig. 9a. As seen, the FE of CO has been close to 100%. However, high selectivity towards C2+ products still needs persistent efforts. Moreover, Cu-SAs are the most important SACs to achieve deep CO2 reduction, though the selectivity of the deep reduction products remains to be improved. There is still a lot of room to explore the potential of central atoms and coordination atoms to boost and regulate the CO2 reduction ability. Here, some perspectives and challenges are proposed (Fig. 9b).

 Fig. 9  (a) The performance summary of various SACs for the electrochemical CO2RR. (b) The perspective of catalysts for the electrochemical CO2RR. 
(1) Identification of the coordination structure and active sites
The identification of the coordination structure is not limited to distinguishing the coordination structure, but also includes identifying the structure evolution of SACs and active sites (such as the reversible conversion between SAs and nanoparticles) and absorption/desorption behavior of intermediates under the electrocatalytic process. Though the uniformly dispersed metal centers of SACs are convenient to recognize, considering that SACs may undergo coordination structure changes under working conditions especially under negative potentials, thus the real active sites during catalysis are still ambiguous. It is urgent to figure out the reaction mechanism and path of the CO2RR via advanced identification methods. In situ characterization is necessary to disclose the coordination structure, true active sites and valences during the CO2RR. The reconstruction of SACs will become clear.
(2) Machine learning
Compared to trial-and-error synthesis and testing in the laboratory, undoubtedly, intelligent theoretical prediction and simulation will extremely improve the efficiency of SAC construction for CO2 reduction. Recently, machine learning trained by high-throughput DFT calculations has been applied to the automatic screening and optimization of catalytic materials. The large-scale element matching of specific active sites and coordination structure can be achieved quickly to realize performance prediction.139 Considering the multiple reaction selectivity of the CO2RR, research on the influence of the reaction path in products should be paid extra attention during the design of coordination elements. Apart from the CO2 reduction performance, the stability of catalysts is also a necessary parameter that cannot be ignored in machine learning. Through communication and integration between experiment and theory, improvements in the CO2RR can be significantly achieved.
(3) Fine adjustment of coordination atoms
Compared with the central atoms, the coordination atoms have a broader regulation range. However, at present, most of the SAs used for the CO2RR are limited to coordinating with N or C atoms in carbon-based materials. N atoms, as well as other doping elements such as S and P, could adjust the electronic structure of the central atoms via coordination effects. On the other hand, oxides, alloys, carbides, etc. are also potential supports for SAs. Coordinating atoms on various supports show coordination structures which could induce different reaction pathways. The comprehensive utilization of the advantages of defects, doping, heterojunctions and topological transformation could adjust the coordination atoms to boost the CO2 reduction performance.
(4) Control of the product distribution
The complex mechanism (multi-electron transfer and proton coupling) and diverse reaction paths of the CO2RR make it difficult to accurately control the product distribution. To realize this aim, coordination structure regulation is feasible but challenging. We should rely on more effective synthesis methods to realize more distinct coordination structures. Additionally, tandem catalysts are regarded as a special kind of material for CO2 deep reduction. We believe that this concept can be used for SACs via synergy between the metal centers and support. Considering that the FECO can reach a level close to 100%, tandem catalysis could achieve continuous conversion from CO2 to CO and then to multi-carbon products.

Broader context
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) under ambient conditions using clean electric energy provides a potential solution to alleviate the negative effects derived from excessive CO2 and produce value-added carbonaceous fuels. However, the high activation energy of the CO bond and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) seriously reduce the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process. Fortunately, the currently emerging single atom catalysts (SACs) have achieved regulated catalytic performance at the atomic scale. This review is aimed at the coordination structures, catalytic paths and properties of advanced SACs for the CO2RR. The coordination configurations and diverse reduction products as well as their correlations are especially emphasized. Furthermore, the existing challenges and research directions are rationally proposed. We hope that this Review will provide a comprehensive summary and profound understanding about the relationship between the coordination structure and CO2RR performance, which may enrich the design of efficient SACs for the CO2RR and extend the distribution of reduction products.
