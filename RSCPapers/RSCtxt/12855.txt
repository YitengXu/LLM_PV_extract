    , Accepted 30th March 2020First published on 31st March 2020AbstractA ∼10-μm-long one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanorod array (NRA) vertically oriented on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate is successfully fabricated via a lukewarm hydrothermal method. The reflection of light from the rough surface of this ultralong ZnO NRA, resulting from the variation in the characteristic length of individual ZnO NRs in a tapered geometry, is largely suppressed. This in turn favors the ZnO NRA as a photoelectrode effectively harnessing UV-light for solar water splitting, as evidently manifested in the quasi-theoretical photocurrent density that reached ∼0.9 mA cm−2 at 1VAg/AgCl. A further contribution to such an outstanding performance stems from additional photocurrent generation by the ZnO NRA upon visible light illumination. This is attributed to a variety of native defects and the surface hydroxyl groups present in the ZnO NRA, giving rise to the mid-gap states that mediate the associated electronic transitions. Moreover, those lattice imperfections further boost the carrier concentration of the ZnO NRA to facilitate the carrier transport which in turn enhances the photoelectrochemical activity.
Introduction
Anti-reflection to enhance the light harvesting efficiency of the photovoltaic and the photoelectrochemical devices in order to take full advantage of the diffuse sunlight has long been at the forefront of research interest in solar-energy-related fields.1–8 To this end, a variety of arrayed nanostructures have been put forward for designing and engineering an active photoelectrode for those devices, among which especially the one-dimensional (1D) nanorod array (NRA) stood out.5–8 In this regard, wurtzite zinc oxide (ZnO) holds particularly great promise, provided that a 1D ZnO NRA is readily fabricated via diverse approaches, among which the hydrothermal method grabs tremendous attention due to its cost-effectiveness and the flexibility to grow large-scale 1D ZnO NRA on any substrate at relatively low temperatures.7–16 Conventionally, the characteristic length of the 1D ZnO NRA prepared via such a method hardly exceeded ∼5 μm (Table 1).7–16 This is attributed to the side reaction which is the homogeneous precipitation of ZnO directly from the reaction reservoir, resulting in a solution which remains no longer supersaturated with ZnO, which in turn leads to the damping of its alternative heterogeneous deposition on the seeded substrate.17,18 To address this issue, the present study put forward a lukewarm hydrothermal approach, by using which the 1D ZnO NRA was grown on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate at a particular temperature of only 65 °C. Under such a synthesis condition, ZnO has been reported to be mostly derived from the intermediate – orthorhombic zinc hydroxide (ε-Zn(OH)2) – via the solid-state phase transformation (eqn (1)).18,19 Zn2+ + 2OH− → Zn(OH)2 → ZnO + H2O(1)

In comparison with ZnO, ε-Zn(OH)2 has been reported to be relatively more soluble, and the supersaturation in the reaction reservoir was thus attenuated to a moderate extent.19,20 This in turn effectively circumvented the homogeneous sedimentation of ε-Zn(OH)2 and the subsequent transition to ZnO directly from the reaction reservoir.18–20 In contrast, the heterogeneous deposition of ε-Zn(OH)2 and a further conversion into ZnO on the FTO glass substrate were however hardly influenced, provided that the reaction rate depends on the supersaturation level to the power of a relatively smaller number with respect to that of the homogeneous precipitation.18,21 The discrepancy between the heterogeneous and homogeneous growth rates was hence augmented, leading to ε-Zn(OH)2 mostly deposited on the FTO glass substrate to eventually develop into a ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA. Surprisingly, this FTO-supported ultralong 1D ZnO NRA successfully delivers a quasi-theoretical photocurrent density that reaches ∼0.9 mA cm−2 by working as the photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell to carry out solar water splitting for hydrogen generation.22 This is on one hand ascribed to the deep penetration of particularly ultraviolet (UV) light into the ultralong 1D ZnO NRA that has been developed in the present study, with a characteristic length of ∼10 μm and has been reported to well suppress the reflection of light from the surface.7,8 Moreover, the massive loading of ZnO NRs on the FTO glass substrate allows effective exploitation of the incident UV light. Most intriguingly, the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA formulated via the foregoing ε-Zn(OH)2-mediated mechanism additionally demonstrates an unusual characteristic, viz. the visible light harvesting ability. This is on the other hand assigned to the 1D ZnO NRA populated by a variety of appreciable native point defects and the surface hydroxyl functional groups. These lattice imperfections have been reported to give rise to the mid-gap states, allowing the 1D ZnO NRA to further harness the visible light.11,23,24 Altogether, the results reported herein highlight the great promise of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA and the lukewarm hydrothermal method developed in the present study for not only solar-energy-related applications but also additional optoelectronic applications.
Experimental
In the present study, a FTO glass substrate (sheet resistance in the range of 6–8 Ω sq−1) was purchased from Ruilong Glass, Taiwan. Zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2, 99.5%) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA, C6H12N4, 99%) were purchased from Shimakyu Chemical Co., Ltd, Japan. Zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2, 99%) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 28%) were purchased from Showa Chemical Industry Co., Ltd, Japan. Polyethylenimine (PEI, (C2H5N)n, with a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 60000 g mol−1) was purchased from Acros Organics, Belgium. All chemical reagents were used as received without any further purification.
The hydrothermal synthesis of the 1D ZnO NRA commenced with seeding the FTO glass substrate with ZnO nanocrystals. To this end, the FTO glass substrate was first cleaned via sonication in acetone and distilled water, respectively, and then spin-coated with 15 mM Zn(CH3COO)2 in 80 μl ethanol. In the subsequent 5 min-long thermal treatment in air at 350 °C, Zn(CH3COO)2 was further decomposed into ZnO as the seed immobilized on the FTO glass substrate to mediate the growth of a 1D ZnO NRA. This seeded FTO substrate was next immersed in an aqueous solution consisting of 5 mM Zn(NO3)2, 5 mM HMTA, 5 mM PEI and 0.25 M NH4OH. Afterwards, the overall reaction reservoir was heated to 65 °C for 24 hours to grow the ultralong 1D ZnO NRA on the FTO glass substrate. An additional FTO-supported 1D ZnO NRA as the reference in the present study was further fabricated using the same solution but at a relatively high temperature of 90 °C. Eventually, the two as-grown 1D ZnO NRAs were calcined in air at 550 °C for 5 hours.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEM-4000EX operated at 15 kV) was carried out to characterize the morphology of the 1D ZnO NRA. X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation with a wavelength of 1.540598 Å monochromated by a focusing Ge crystal) was performed to study the crystal structure of the 1D ZnO NRA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer model PHI 1600) was performed to investigate the chemical state of the constituent elements of the 1D ZnO NRA. The Raman spectra of the 1D ZnO NRA were obtained using a LabRAM HR 550 system equipped with a HeNe laser (optical power of 5 mW). The optical absorption spectra of the 1D ZnO NRA were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer and further analyzed by means of Kubelka–Munk transformation. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the 1D ZnO NRA were recorded at room temperature using a LabRAM HR 320 system equipped with a diode laser (405 nm, 50 mW). The photoelectrochemical characteristics of the 1D ZnO NRA were first explored via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using the CHI 6273D potentiostat/galvanostat. A three-electrode cell configuration was implemented to this end, in which the 1D ZnO NRA on the FTO substrate was used as the working electrode and was further coupled with a platinum foil (2.25 cm2) used as the counter electrode and a silver/silver chloride electrode (Ag/AgCl in 3 M KCl, E° = 0.207 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) used as the reference electrode. In addition, 0.5 M Na2SO4 was employed as the electrolyte (pH = 6.8). All potentials (VAg/AgCl) reported herein are against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A 150 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM 1.5 filter was used as the light source, and the calibrated light intensity was 100 mW cm−2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to probe the charge transport kinetics of the FTO-supported 1D ZnO NRA under solar illumination at 0.2 VAg/AgCl with an AC amplitude of 5 mV over a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. Photocurrent action spectra, wherein the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the FTO-supported 1D ZnO NRA was plotted as a function of the wavelength of incident light, were recorded at 0.2 VAg/AgCl under the irradiation of monochromatic light using a 150 W Xe lamp equipped with a monochromator as an alternative light source. Mott–Schottky analysis was performed at a dc potential ranging from 0.1 to 0.4VAg/AgCl with a frequency of 10 kHz and an ac potential amplitude of 10 mV under dark conditions.
Results and discussion
Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were first collected to punctuate the major breakthrough in the present research to successfully extend the characteristic length of the 1D ZnO NRA well beyond the 5-μm-bottleneck via the lukewarm hydrothermal method (Fig. 1b). Particularly, the 1D ZnO NRA reached ∼10-μm-long, far exceeding that (∼4 μm) of its counterpart prepared by using the scheme highly analogous to that reported in the literature, in which the hydrothermal process was carried out at a temperature close to the boiling point (b.p.) of water, more than two-fold (Fig. 1a and Table 1).7–16 Additional discrepancy is further perceived in the diameters of the 1D ZnO NRAs synthesized via the lukewarm and relatively hot hydrothermal approaches, which are 80–130 and 40–65 nm, respectively (Fig. 1c–f).

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were additionally obtained, using which the features were well-resolved and they were in excellent agreement with those (labeled with heart) of bulk hexagonal ZnO (ICSD no. 184793), illustrating that the two 1D ZnO NRAs were highly crystallized into the wurtzite structure (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the strong (002) X-ray reflection (at 2θ = 34.4°) further indicated that the two 1D ZnO NRAs were preferentially oriented in the (002) direction normal to the surface of the FTO glass substrate (the inset in Fig. 2a), which is in line with the SEM results (Fig. 1a and b).25 In this regard, the distinction in the intensity of the (002) X-ray diffraction between the two 1D ZnO NRAs is on the one hand attributed to the significant contrast between their individual lengths (Fig. 1a, b and the inset in Fig. 2a). Moreover, the dense distribution over the entire FTO glass substrate of the relatively thick 1D ZnO NRA synthesized via the lukewarm hydrothermal technique leads to a comparatively better alignment perpendicular to the underlying FTO substrate, being further responsible for the foregoing intensity difference. In addition, it is worth noting that only in the XRD pattern of the 1D ZnO NRA fabricated via the lukewarm hydrothermal approach, a small feature (at 2θ = 32.9°) is seen in close proximity to the (002) X-ray reflection and is hardly ascribed to either ZnO or the underlying FTO (Fig. 2a and b). In contrast, an excellent agreement is otherwise found between that and the (221) X-ray diffraction (labeled with spade) of bulk orthorhombic Zn(OH)2 (ICSD no. 50447) that has been reported in the literature as an important intermediate in especially the low-temperature hydrothermal process to mediate the formation of the 1D ZnO NRA.18,19 The presence of ε-Zn(OH)2 in the 1D ZnO NRA further accounts for the shouldered lineshape of the characteristic O 1s core-level X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectrum, which is a result of the convolution of three contributions (Fig. 2c). Particularly, the emission line at a binding energy (B.E.) of 531.5 eV is assigned to the surface hydroxyl group of ε-Zn(OH)2 and ZnO in addition to the lattice oxygen in especially the oxygen-deficient regions in the wurtzite crystal structure of ZnO.19,23–25 Moreover, the relatively minor feature at 532.5 eV is attributed to the water byproduct derived from the phase transition from ε-Zn(OH)2 to ZnO in addition to the water contamination adsorbed onto the surface of ε-Zn(OH)2 and ZnO (eqn (1)).19,23,26 In contrast, the major contribution at 530.6 eV is in general attributed exclusively to the lattice oxygen in the stoichiometric ZnO host matrix.19,23–26 In this regard, the absence of ε-Zn(OH)2 in the 1D ZnO NRA fabricated via a comparatively high-temperature hydrothermal method results in large attenuation of the intensity of the two emission lines at higher B.E., which in turn leads to their convolution with the feature of lowering B.E. giving rise to the asymmetric lineshape of the corresponding O 1s core-level XP spectrum (Fig. 2d). Background-corrected integration was further carried out to highlight the relative contribution of the three components at B.E. of 530.1, 531.5 and 532.6 eV, which when expressed in terms of percentage were 59%, 36% and 4%, respectively, for the 1D ZnO NRA prepared via a relatively hot hydrothermal method. This is in significant contrast to 26%, 43% and 30% derived for the emission lines at B.E. of 530.6, 531.5 and 532.5 eV, respectively, seen in the deconvoluted O 1s core-level XP spectrum of the 1D ZnO NRA prepared via the lukewarm hydrothermal approach (Fig. 2c), thus further reinforcing the foregoing argumentation.

The post-annealing procedure was afterwards carried out on the one hand to improve the crystallinity of the 1D ZnO NRAs, as evidenced by the reinforced intensity of the X-ray reflections particularly in the XRD pattern of the 1D ZnO NRA fabricated via the relatively high-temperature hydrothermal method (Fig. 2e). Surprisingly, after such a thermal treatment the discrepancy in the intensity of the (002) X-ray diffraction between the two 1D ZnO NRAs is largely attenuated, suggesting that comparatively abundant lattice imperfections were still present in the 1D ZnO NRA prepared via the lukewarm hydrothermal approach. Such an argumentation is further reinforced by additionally performed Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 2f). In addition to the most intense feature at 439.2 cm−1 which is assigned to the vibration mode E2(high) specific to ZnO highly crystallized into the wurtzite structure, an extra contribution at 583.7 cm−1 is seen especially in the Raman spectrum of the post-annealed 1D ZnO NRA synthesized via the lukewarm hydrothermal approach.26,27 This line is ascribed to the longitudinal-optical mode E1(LO) characteristic of structural disorders including the oxygen vacancy (VO) and the Zn interstitial (Zni), and more importantly, the strong intensity passed a clear indication that the 1D ZnO NRA formulated via the lukewarm hydrothermal approach was indeed flooded with those native point defects.26,27 On the other hand, the post-calcination has been reported to dehydrate ε-Zn(OH)2 in the 1D ZnO NRA in the meantime, as validated by the absence of the characteristic (221) X-ray reflection in the corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. 2e).19,28 Moreover, this is further reinforced by the additionally recorded Zn 2p core-level XP spectrum, in which only the Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at B.E. of 1022 and 1045 eV are seen and they are in good agreement with those reported for wurtzite ZnO in the literature (Fig. 2g).24,25 Most significantly, the water byproduct released during the dehydration process in turn largely boosted the ambient humidity, leading to post-tempering of the 1D ZnO NRA under such a condition and highly likely further decoration with numerous surface hydroxyl functional groups. This along with foregoing VO synergistically accounted for the characteristic emission line at a B.E. of 531.5 eV derived from the deconvolution of the O 1s core-level XP spectrum obtained for the post-calcined 1D ZnO NRA prepared via the lukewarm hydrothermal approach, in which the intensity normalized to that of the major contribution at 530.1 eV was 0.85, which far exceeds that (0.54) of its counterpart grown via the relatively hot hydrothermal method (Fig. 2h and i).19,23–25
UV-visible spectroscopy was then carried out to study the optical properties of the two 1D ZnO NRAs (Fig. 3a). Prima facie, the post-annealed 1D ZnO NRA fabricated via the lukewarm hydrothermal method demonstrates very strong photoabsorption of UV-light. Such superiority is on the one hand attributed to the significant surface roughness of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA, resulting from the variation in the characteristic length of individual ZnO NRs (Fig. 1b and f).7,8 This along with the additional structural features including the tapered geometry and the quasi-vertical alignment on the FTO substrate have been reported to largely improve the anti-reflection characteristic of the 1D ZnO NRA.1,7,8 In consequence, the incident light is more successfully coupled into the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA, whose characteristic ultralong length and the relatively thick diameter on the other hand imply the massive loading of ZnO over the entire FTO substrate. The synergistic effect thus highly favors more effective harnessing of the incident UV-light by the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA (Fig. 3a). Moreover, it is worth noting that the onset wavelength of such outstanding UV-light harvesting ability of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA is relatively long compared to that of its counterpart prepared via the comparatively hot hydrothermal technique (Fig. 3b). Such a red-shift of the absorption edge in the present study is ascribed to the presence of appreciable structural defects particularly in the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA (Fig. 2e–i). These lattice imperfections have been reported to give rise to the mid-gap states, which in turn allows the electronic transitions between the discrete energy levels and the continuous conduction or valence band excitable by the incident light with photon energy below the optical band gap (∼3.3 eV) of the 1D ZnO NRA (Fig. 3a and b).23,24,28 To gain more insight into such defect-mediated photoexcitation, room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was further carried out (Fig. 3c and d). The measurement began with the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA first illuminated by blue-violet laser light with a wavelength (λ) of 405 nm. Given that the energy of this incident light hardly exceeded the band gap of the 1D ZnO NRA, the electrons were mostly excited from the valence band (VB) to highly likely the Zni-associated defect states, and the characteristic energy level has been reported to be below the conduction band minimum (CBM).29,30 The subsequent electronic transitions from such a state to a variety of additional defect-related mid-gap levels in turn largely accounted for the measured broadband PL emission (Fig. 3c and d). Surprisingly, further deconvolution gave rise to five distinct contributions, of which the green emission at λ = 516 nm was the most intense feature and has universally been reported to originate from the electronic transitions from/to particularly the VO-relevant defect states.30,31 This is in line with the foregoing conclusion of the presence of Zni and VO in the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA derived from the Raman spectroscopy and XPS results (Fig. 2f and h). More importantly, compared to that of its ∼4-μm-long counterpart, this green feature of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA is relatively strong, and the intensity is normalized to that of the contribution at λ = 470 nm stemming from the spontaneous emission of the pump laser for comparison (Fig. 3c). This further reinforces the aforementioned argumentation that the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA is populated by comparatively abundant Zni and VO (Fig. 2f, h and i). Alongside this green emission are the blue and yellow contributions at λ = 491 and 564 nm, respectively, that most probably stem from the electronic transitions to the mid-gap energy levels associated with zinc vacancy (VZn) and oxygen interstitial (Oi), respectively (Fig. 3c and d).30,32 Such a tentative assignment built by the solution-based hydrothermal approach employed in the present study has been reported to provide an oxygen-rich environment for the growth of the 1D ZnO NRA.33 Under such a scheme, VZn and Oi are readily formed in the 1D ZnO NRA, provided that the characteristic formation enthalpy was relatively low with respect to those of additional native point defects.34,35 In addition to these three common contributions, an extra orange emission at λ = 626 nm is further perceived only in the PL spectrum of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA and more importantly, it accounts for the major spectral discrepancy compared to that of its ∼4-μm-long counterpart (Fig. 3c). Given that in this work the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA was further characterized by the presence of particularly the surface hydroxyl functional groups in addition to the aforesaid point defects (Fig. 2h), this orange feature is thus tentatively ascribed to the electronic transition to the OH-related mid-gap energy states (Fig. 3c and d), which is further reinforced by the excellent agreement with the former argumentation reported in the literature.33

Associated deconvolutions are shown below.

The presence of a variety of numerous structural disorders especially in the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA is insofar well-established, and their influence on the photoelectrochemical property for solar water splitting to generate the hydrogen fuel is further studied first by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). A three-electrode cell configuration was implemented to measure the current response of the FTO-supported ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode subjected to the chopped illumination of simulated sunlight. The result was plotted as a function of the external bias scanned from −0.5 to 1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode) at a rate of 10 mV s−1 (Fig. 4a). Surprisingly, the anodic photocurrent response of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode commences at a potential of ∼−0.2 VAg/AgCl and is progressively increased to ∼0.9 mA cm−2 at 1 VAg/AgCl. This is in significant contrast to its ∼4-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA counterpart, for which the onset potential of the photocurrent response is ∼0 VAg/AgCl and the photocurrent density at 1 VAg/AgCl reaches only 0.47 mA cm−2. To gain more insight into the superior photocurrent density of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode, photocurrent action spectra were additionally recorded at an external bias of 0.2 VAg/AgCl (Fig. 4b). At first sight, the IPCE value of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode far exceeds that of its ∼4-μm-long counterpart particularly at a wavelength below ∼400 nm. This is first attributed to the outstanding UV-light harvesting ability of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA, provided that such an outperformance is in excellent agreement with that seen in the UV-visible spectra (Fig. 3a). Further responsibility was taken by the several lattice imperfections present in the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA, among which particularly Zni has been reported as the shallow donor defect which was favorable for boosting the carrier concentration.24,29,30 To validate such an argumentation, the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plot of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode was performed under dark conditions at a frequency of 10 kHz and an amplitude of 10 mV (Fig. 4c). Particularly, the donor concentration (Nd) was determined from the slope of the linear regression of the curve in the M–S plot using the equation below.24,25 (2)

Inset: equivalent circuit describing the photoelectrochemical behavior of the FTO-supported 1D ZnO NRA working electrode. 
In this expression, C is the space charge capacitance, ε and ε0 stand for the permittivity of ZnO (ε = 8) and free space, respectively, V represents the applied potential, VFB corresponds to the flat band potential, T stands for the temperature, and kB and e are the Boltzmann constant and the elementary charge, respectively. The Nd obtained for the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode was 4.76 × 1018 cm−3, well surpassing that (1.8 × 1018 cm−3) of its ∼4-μm-long counterpart. On the one hand, this results in VFB value of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode that is closer to the CBM, which is at a relatively negative potential of −0.21 VAg/AgCl compared to that (0.01 VAg/AgCl) of its ∼4-μm-long counterpart, as determined from the abscissal intercept of the linear regression of the characteristic M–S curves, respectively.24,25 Such a discrepancy in the VFB values between the two 1D ZnO NRA working electrodes well underlies the different onset potentials of the photocurrent response seen in the measured LSV curves (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, a comparatively higher donor concentration along with a relatively large specific surface area of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode are favorable to the charge transport (Fig. 1b, f and 4c), as reflected in the Nyquist plots obtained under solar illumination at an external bias of 0.2 VAg/AgCl with an AC amplitude of 5 mV over the frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz (Fig. 4d). Particularly, arc impedance in the high-frequency region of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode is relatively small compared to that of its ∼4-μm-long counterpart, and the radius is further utilized to quantify the carrier transport kinetics in terms of the charge transfer resistance (Rct). To this end, the complex nonlinear least squares (CNLS) fitting method based on the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 4d was employed.25 The Rct obtained for the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode reaches only 18.4 Ω cm−2, which is well below that (20 Ω cm−2) of its ∼4-μm-long counterpart. Last but not least, further contribution to the outstanding photoelectrochemical performance of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode originates from additional photocurrent generation upon illumination with the visible light with a particular wavelength of ∼550 nm (Fig. 4b). In this process, other structural disorders in addition to Zni play important roles, and the characteristic energy levels are mostly located deeply within the wide band gap of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA (Fig. 3d).32 In other words, the energy difference between the discrete defect-associated states and the CBM or valence band maximum (VBM) of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA is relatively small. In such context, the electrons have been reported to be readily excited by the incident visible light from those states to the continuous CB of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA to participate in the water splitting reaction, and in this way they contribute to additional photocurrent flow (Fig. 4a).11,23,24
Conclusions
In summary, in the present study a lukewarm hydrothermal method was put forward to grow a highly aligned ultralong 1D ZnO NRA vertically-oriented on the FTO glass substrate, whose characteristic length was ∼10 μm, as manifested distinctly in the SEM and XRD results. Moreover, XPS and Raman spectroscopy analyses revealed that the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA was flooded with a variety of appreciable crystal defects including VO, Zni, the surface hydroxyl functional groups, and so forth. These lattice imperfections on the one hand gave rise to the mid-gap states allowing the wide-band-gap 1D ZnO NRA to further harvest the visible light in addition to UV light, as reflected evidently in the obtained UV-visible and PL spectra. In particular, the Zni-associated defect states were shallowly below the CBM and therefore worked on the other hand as the native electron donor to further promote the carrier concentration of the 1D ZnO NRA, as well evidenced by M–S and EIS measurements. Most significantly, LSV and photocurrent action spectra clearly highlighted that the PEC performance of the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA working electrode was largely improved by the synergistic effect of the foregoing factors and the appreciable specific surface area, which was manifested not only in the negative shift of the onset potential of the photocurrent response but also in the photocurrent density that eventually reached ∼0.9 mA cm−2 at 1 VAg/AgCl. Altogether, the ∼10-μm-long 1D ZnO NRA and the lukewarm hydrothermal method developed in the present study have become the rising stars for not only solar-energy-related applications but also additional optoelectronic applications.
