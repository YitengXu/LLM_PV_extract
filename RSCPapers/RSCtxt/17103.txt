    , Accepted 24th June 2015First published on 25th June 2015AbstractHygroscopic lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Li-TFSI) and corrosive pyridine doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) in perovskite solar cells generally results in poor device ambient stability due to moisture-induced degradation of the perovskite absorber. Simultaneously fulfilling good ambient stability and high efficiency, this work proposes the use of a p-type and highly conductive reduced graphene oxide (RGO) reduced by ferrous iodide acid solution, combined with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD as a hole extraction and transport material in perovskite solar cells, achieving a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.6%, greatly outperforming the reference devices based on pure dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 6.5%). Impressively, only a 15% PCE degradation is observed for the device with RGO/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD without encapsulation after 500 h, whereas the PCE drops by 65% for the device with Li-TFSI and pyridine doped spiro-OMeTAD. This work represents a significant step toward the realization of stable and high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Solution-processed organic–inorganic hybrid trihalide perovskite solar cells have attracted significant research interests owing to their potential for low-cost fabrication of large-area devices and compatibility with light-weight and flexible plastic substrates.1 Presently, highly efficient perovskite solar cells typically employ an organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite material as both the light absorber and charge transporter, which is sandwiched between an electron-blocking p-type organic hole transport layer and an n-type electron-transport layer.2–4 With meticulous compositional engineering of perovskite materials, the device interface design and film growth technique, perovskite solar cells have delivered impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 17%.5–7 In most state-of-the-art high-performance perovskite solar cells, a p-type organic small molecule, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), was typically used as a hole transport material (HTM).
The sp3 hybridization of the nitrogen atom in spiro-OMeTAD leads to an inherent triangular pyramid configuration and hence large intermolecular distances, which result in low hole mobility and poor conductivity.8,9 The low intrinsic charge carrier mobility and poor conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD is detrimental to the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells because they can cause additional series resistance and significant charge recombination. It has therefore been a prevalent practice to incorporate a redox-active p-type dopant lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Li-TFSI) to invoke an oxidative process to achieve appreciable conductivity for spiro-OMeTAD.10–12 In addition, pyridine derivatives were also used as additives to suppress charge recombination and improve the contact between perovskite and the HTM in perovskite solar cells.13 However, such doping would necessitate an open system to allow for rather non-quantifiable oxygen ingression and unpredictable variations of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD concentration.14 The hygroscopic properties of Li-TFSI salt would induce degradation of the perovskite layer if devices are not fully sealed against moisture15,16 and the pyridine derivative is also corrosive to perovskite materials,13 which could thus explain the wide variance in terms of photovoltaic performance, reproducibility, and device stability.
Therefore, seeking novel HTMs without Li-TFSI and pyridine dopants such as 4-tert-butylpyridine,15,17–20 or stable additives combined with HTMs such as spiro-OMeTAD or poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells,16,21–23 is highly desirable for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells. For example, a novel iridium complex, IrCp*Cl(PyPyz)[TFSI], has been used as an additive for spiro-OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells, leading to improved cell performance and remarkable device stability in comparison to unmodified and Co complex (Co(PyPyz)3[TFSI]3) modified devices.22 Recently, graphdiyne has been reported as a conductive additive for the P3HT HTM in perovskite solar cells and the unsealed device stored in a desiccator retained 90% of its initial PCE.21 Bamboo-structured carbon nanotubes were added to Li-TFSI and pyridine doped P3HT as the HTM in perovskite solar cells yielding a maximum PCE of 8.3%, whereas the cell stability was not investigated.24 In addition, sequentially deposited bilayers of P3HT functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD or PMMA also were used as HTMs to replace doped spiro-OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells yielding a stabilized maximum power output of 10.7%.15,16 During the 500 h stability test the PCE retained 80% of its initial values when encapsulated with epoxy resin and a glass coverslip in a nitrogen-filled glove box.16 However, different from graphdiyne or carbon nanotubes functioning only as conductive additives to facilitate hole transport in the composite film, P3HT functionalized SWNTs could be used as an efficient HTM in perovskite solar cells due to not only their high conductivity but also their selective hole extraction properties. These results suggest the potential use of conductive additives or hole-extraction p-type carbon materials for fully replacing Li-TFSI and pyridine doping of spiro-OMeTAD and yielding comparably efficient but more stable devices.
Graphene, similar to its carbon nanotube counterpart, has unique properties such as high conductivity, ease of modification and low cost, and has already shown great potential in perovskite solar cell applications.25 As an oxygen-containing derivative of graphene, graphene oxide (GO) has recently been demonstrated to act as an effective alternative for PEDOT:PSS in inverted heterojunction perovskite solar cells which has achieved a PCE of over 10%.26 In spite of the great advantages of low manufacturing cost and compatibility with roll-to-roll processing, the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells with GO as the HTM is highly sensitive to the film thickness of GO due to its insulating and hygroscopic properties.26 Alternatively, an ultra-thin reduced graphene oxide (RGO) functionalized with p-hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid was just recently reported as an efficient hole extracting material for inverted heterojunction perovskite solar cells,27 with an improved device performance (maximum PCE of 10.8%) due to its higher conductivity (∼300 S m−1) and optimal energy level alignment compared to GO and with a moderate stability (∼60% of the initial value after 140 h in air).
Herein, we demonstrate that p-type solution-processable RGO combined with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD could be used as an efficient HTM in perovskite solar cells with superior stability and high-efficiency. The HTM was fabricated by spin-coating a RGO dispersion on the perovskite film and subsequent casting of dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD. By using such a bilayer structure, the maximum PCE of perovskite solar cells reached up to 10.6%, much higher than the efficiencies of cells containing GO/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD, 6.1%, and dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD alone, 6.5%. In addition, devices with RGO showed a superior stability (retaining over 85% of the initial value after 500 h in air). These results demonstrate the possibility to achieve almost identical device performance at massively reduced cost, using reduced graphene oxide prepared from solution-based methods rather than prohibitive P3HT functionalized carbon nanotubes, and produce ambient stable perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the charge extraction ability of RGO with or without dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD when interfaced with perovskite has been investigated and the hole transport pathways in perovskite solar cells are also discussed.
Experimental
Reduction of GO to RGO
GO was prepared using a modified Hummers' and Offeman's method from natural graphite. The GO dispersed in deionized water was reduced by using FeI2 aqueous solution as reported in our previous work.28 FeI2 aqueous solution was synthesized directly from the reaction of iodine/iron powder with some drops of water as a catalyzer. Briefly, 5 g sphere-shaped iodine particles were ground to fine powder in an agate mortar and subsequently mixed fully with 5 g fine iron powder in a beaker. Then, 20 mL of deionized water were quickly added into the above beaker. By collecting the supernatant, the FeI2 aqueous solution was obtained. After that, the resultant supernatant was added to a beaker containing 100 mL 10 mg mL−2 GO dispersion. Then, the pH value of the GO dispersion in FeI2 aqueous solution was tuned by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid. To obtain different reduction degrees of RGO, pH was tuned to 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 by controlling the volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Finally, the different GO acid dispersions were heated to 95 °C for 6 h to obtain various RGO dispersions. After the beaker containing RGO was cooled down to room temperature naturally, the resulting RGO dispersion was collected through centrifugation and washed with deionized water, and then sonicated in ethanol and washed with ethanol to remove the surface-absorbing residues. Finally, the wet product was dried by vacuum freeze-drying for 24 h and the resultant powder was further dried at 100 °C in a vacuum drying cabinet for 48 h. For simplicity, the GO reduced at pH = 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 was designated as RGO-1, RGO-1.5, RGO-2, and RGO-3, respectively. To obtain dry GO powder, the water in the GO aqueous dispersion was removed by vacuum freeze-drying and then dried at 100 °C in a vacuum drying cabinet for 48 h.
Device fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass was etched with zinc powder and diluted hydrochloric acid to form two detached electrodes and was subsequently ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, separately. Before the fabrication of solar cells, the cleaned FTO glass was treated with an ultraviolet/O3 cleaner for at least 15 min. A compact TiO2 layer was obtained by spin-coating an acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in anhydrous ethanol on the cleaned FTO surface, and then sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. A mesoporous layer was deposited on the compact layer by spin-coating a commercial colloidal dispersion of TiO2 paste (20 nm, PST-18NR, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd., Japan, diluted with ethanol at a weight ratio of 1/3.5) at 5000 rpm for 45 s, and then drying at 125 °C for 10 min, and further annealing in air at 500 °C for 30 min. After the mesoporous film was cooled down to room temperature, PbI2 dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (1.2 M) was deposited on the mesoporous film by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s, followed by drying at 100 °C on a hot plate for 45 min. After that, the resultant PbI2 films were dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (12 mg mL−1) for 10 min and then rinsed with 2-propanol and dried at 70 °C for 1 h.
For the preparation of RGO or GO dispersion, 50 mg of the as-obtained RGO or GO powder was dispersed in 50 mL chlorobenzene and sonicated in a bath sonicator for 2 h. The dispersion was subsequently centrifuged for 25 min at 10000 rpm to remove large RGO or GO particles. The precipitate was discarded while the supernatant was recovered. The obtained supernatant was further sonicated for 1 h to fully disperse the RGO or GO sheets. After the sonication, RGO aggregates were then removed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was recovered. The resultant RGO or GO dispersion with a concentration of about 0.05–0.08 mg mL−1 was used as a stock solution for spin-coating.
For the fabrication of RGO or GO-based HTM layers, the RGO was first deposited dynamically on the as-prepared perovskite surface by slow drop-to-drop spin-coating 600 μL RGO or GO dispersion at 2000 rpm for 120 s, followed immediately by the deposition of 60 μL spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (30 mg mL−1) by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 60 s. The samples were then left in dry air for 12 h. After that, the top electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation of Au. In the stability study, the perovskite solar cells were stored in the dark without any encapsulation. The average humidity percentage was about 40 ± 7% and the temperature was about 20 ± 3 °C.
For doped spiro-OMeTAD deposition, 60 μL of 1 mL chlorobenzene solution containing 73.2 g spiro-OMeTAD, 29 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine and 18.5 μL lithium-bis(trifluoromethyl)sulfonimide/acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1) was cast onto the perovskite coated substrate and spun at a rate of 4000 rpm for 60 s.
Characterization
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the perovskite solar cells were measured with a digital source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments, USA) under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), which was realized using a solar simulator (91192, Oriel, USA, calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar cell). The solar cells were masked with a metal aperture defining the active area (0.06 cm2) of the solar cells. J–V curves were measured by scanning from forward bias to short circuit (FB-SC, from 1.3 V to −0.1 V) or from short circuit to forward bias (SC-FB, from −0.1 V to 1.3 V) with a scan rate of 0.022 V s−1. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was characterized by using a QEX10 solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10, PV measurements, USA). Prior to the measurement, a standard silicon solar cell was used as the reference.
The top surface morphology of the film was obtained using an LEO 1530 Gemini field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher SCIENTIFIC INC., USA) with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) as the source. The compressed-powder RGO sheets were obtained by pressing the RGO powder samples into a cylindrical tablet at a pressure of 8 MPa, whose conductivity was measured by using a digital four-point probe system (SX1934, Suzhou, China) at room temperature. To obtain reliable conductivity data, four different sites of each sample were measured by using the four-point probe system. The thickness of compressed-powder RGO sheets were measured by using a Tesa probe (Tesa GT21, Swiss) and the average thickness was utilized to calculate the conductivity. The Hall measurement (HL5500PC, NANOMETRICS, USA) was performed at room temperature to obtain the semiconductor type and carrier mobility of the compressed-powder RGO sheets using the van der Pauw method. The mobility and semiconductor type for GO are not determined due to the limited sensitivity of the Hall measurement apparatus.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired with a FLS920 transient optical spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK). The probe light was provided by a pulsed xenon arc lamp. The sample was kept at a 45° angle to the excitation beam. The excitation and luminescence measurements were taken from the glass side for all tested samples. The sample for PL measurements was prepared as follows: the perovskite film was deposited on cleaned glass, followed by drying at 100 °C on a hot plate. After that, different quenchers were then deposited via spin-coating. Finally, to avoid the degradation of perovskite during the measurements, a layer of poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) dissolved in chlorobenzene was then deposited via spin-coating.
Results and discussion
The as-reduced RGO exhibited a wrinkled paper-like structure, which was mainly composed of multilayered sheets (Fig. S1†). For simplicity, the GO reduced at pH = 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 was designated as RGO-1, RGO-1.5, RGO-2, and RGO-3. Fig. 1a shows the XPS spectra of GO and RGO reduced by FeI2 under different pH. The fitting of the C 1s XPS spectrum of GO in Fig. 1b clearly indicates a considerable degree of oxidation with four components that correspond to carbon atoms in different functional groups: the peak at 284.8 eV is ascribed to the non-oxygenated C–C/CC, while the peaks at 285.7, 287.2 and 287.9 eV correspond to the C–O, CO, and the carboxylate O–CO groups, respectively.28 After being reduced by FeI2, the C1s XPS spectrum of RGO-1 exhibited certain oxygen functionalities that can be assigned for GO (Fig. 1c), but the peak intensities of these oxygen-containing components in the RGO-1 sharply decreased, indicating highly efficient reduction of GO by FeI2. Interestingly, compared to GO, the XPS survey spectra of RGO always showed additional I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2 peaks at 619 and 631 eV, respectively, suggesting that some iodine has been incorporated into RGO (Fig. 1a). Considering that the iodine atoms can be absorbed on the surface of RGO during the reduction of GO, the as-prepared RGO was washed and sonicated in ethanol for at least 20 min, and then dried at 100 °C in a vacuum for 24 h before use and characterization. The physically bonded iodine can be removed after such procedures, while the remaining iodine on the surface of RGO might have a relatively strong chemical bonding with the matrix. It has been well reported that iodine can be used as a p-type dopant to improve the electrical conductivity of polymers and carbon materials:29–32 the iodine (polyiodides Ix−, usually composed of I− and I2) doped in carbon nanotubes or conducting polymers can efficiently promote electron transfer from carbon nanotubes or polymers to the polyiodide chain and produce a large number of mobile hole carriers, leading to an increase in the electrical conductivity of carbon materials and polymers. Thus, the remnant iodine content in RGO should also contribute to the electrical conductivity.

The Raman spectra of GO and RGO reduced by FeI2 solution under different pH are shown in Fig. 2a, recorded using 633 nm laser irradiation. The ID/IG ratio of RGO increased notably after FeI2 reduction compared to that of GO, indicating the restoration of the conjugated CC bond and an increase in the number of smaller sp2 domains after the FeI2 reduction of GO to RGO.33 The electrical conductivities at room temperature of RGO compressed-powder samples reduced by FeI2 under different pH are shown in Fig. 2b. It is much obvious that lower pH values led to higher bulk conductivities, which indicates that the presence of H+ can efficiently improve the reductive ability by inhibiting the hydrolysis of strong Lewis acid in FeI2 aqueous solution.28 In addition, the RGO compressed-powder samples at pH = 1 exhibited a conductivity of ∼2600 S m−1, which is almost 10 times higher than that of the compressed-powder sample of RGO reduced by hydrazine hydrate (∼200 S m−1) as reported previously.34 Such high intrinsic conductivities of RGO powder samples should be primarily ascribed to a very dense conductive network formed by cross-linking RGO sheets in RGO aggregates and quite conductive particle-to-particle interface.34 Interestingly, the Hall effect measurements consistently showed that RGOs were of p-type nature with a carrier concentration of ∼1019 cm−3 (Fig. S2†). The hole mobility at room-temperature increased from 1.72 to 7.97 as the pH value decreased from 3 to 1. The semiconductor type and mobility for GO has not been determined due to its insulating nature and the limited sensitivity of the Hall effect measurement apparatus.

To evaluate the potential of applying RGO as the hole extracting material in perovskite solar cells, photoluminescence (PL) was used to probe the hole quenching ability of RGO with or without dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD when interfaced with the perovskite absorber. CH3NH3PbI3 was first deposited on a bare quartz slide and then GO or RGO with or without dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated on the surface of CH3NH3PbI3 films. As shown in Fig. 3a, the PL spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 on bare quartz (no quencher) shows a strong peak at ∼770 nm. When RGO or GO was interfaced with perovskite, the characteristic peak intensity dramatically decreased, indicating that RGO or GO could be individually used as the hole extracting material in perovskite solar cells. It is also observed that RGO quenches the perovskite steady-state PL peak more efficiently than GO. When dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD was introduced into the quenching layers, the PL quenching effect was further enhanced (Fig. 3b) due to the energetically favorable hole transfer from the perovskite to spiro-OMeTAD, which will be described later. GO with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD shows slightly higher peak intensity than the RGO/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD composite quencher or dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD alone. However, it should be noted that the PL quenching of the RGO/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD composite quencher shows no significant difference with respect to that of dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD or Li-TFSI and pyridine doped spiro-OMeTAD when interfaced with perovskite. This result was probably due to that RGO could extract holes from perovskite as efficient as spiro-OMeTAD.

To evaluate the effect of RGO on device performance, perovskite solar cells with CH3NH3PbI3 as the light absorber were fabricated. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer was deposited on top of a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold using a sequential deposition method. RGO or GO was deposited on CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 films by spin-coating followed by spin-coating dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD. The solar cells were completed through depositing a layer of ∼400 nm Au electrode on the RGO/spiro-OMeTAD covered film surfaces. Fig. 4a shows a typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) top surface image of perovskite films covered by RGO. It can be clearly seen that RGO sheets lied horizontally and are anchored firmly on the perovskite surface. RGO interfaced with perovskite in horizontal directions will be beneficial to the charge extraction from perovskite. However, since RGO cannot completely cover the perovskite surface, discrete islands have been formed on the perovskite surface. After spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated, the uncovered perovskite surface was completely buried and RGO islands were partly covered as shown in Fig. 4b. The total thickness of the active layer in this work is 580 nm, consisting of 410 nm-thick perovskite filled in the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold and a 170 nm-thick perovskite capping layer. The thickness of spiro-OMeTAD is about 200 nm as shown in Fig. 4c. The RGO islands were always slightly protuberant over the spiro-OMeTAD layer and finally would come into contact with the back electrode, which could greatly benefit the charge transportation, as discussed later in the paper.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of perovskite solar cells based on different hole transport layers under simulated AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 solar irradiation are shown in Fig. 5a and a summary of the device performance is tabulated in Table 1. For comparison, a reference cell fabricated with the doped spiro-OMeTAD was also prepared, which displayed a Jsc of 19.60 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1000 mV, and a FF of 0.68, resulting in a high PCE of 13.33% in FB-SC scan, as shown in Fig. 5a and Table 1. However, the cell with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD exhibited, consistent with previous reports,16 a Voc of 863 mV, a Jsc of 15.53 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.43, and a PCE of 5.85% (max. 6.5%). As for the device with GO, the PCE decreased to 5.54%, even inferior to that of the cell with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD, which could be due to the highly insulating nature of GO. On the other hand, when replacing GO with RGO, all the devices showed significant improvement in the photovoltaic parameters. In particular, the devices with RGO-1 and RGO-2 showed improved photovoltaic performance compared to the RGO-3-based one. RGO-1 based devices exhibited better photovoltaic performance than RGO-2-based ones. The RGO-1-based device showed an average PCE of 9.31% (max. 10.6%), with a Jsc of 16.73 mA cm−2, a Voc of 910 mV and a FF of 0.61. Notably, the improvements could be mainly attributed to the increased FF, which likely originate from the improved hole mobility and increased conductivity of RGO-1, as shown in Fig. 2b. However, compared to perovskite solar cells fabricated with Li-TFSI and pyridine doped spiro-OMeTAD, the J–V curves of the perovskite solar cells fabricated with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD with or without RGO have larger series resistances, which may be a result of charge extraction limited by the low conductivity of the RGO/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD layer. The incident photo to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the perovskite solar cells with and without RGO is shown in Fig. 5b. The photocurrent generation for different perovskite solar cells started at around 800 nm, in agreement with the observed band gap of 1.55 eV.35 The use of RGO gave a noticeable improvement of the IPCE values in the visible to near-infrared wavelength region, especially in the long wavelength region between 500 and 800 nm. Integrating the overlap of the IPCE spectra with the AM 1.5 G solar irradiation yield photocurrent densities of 16.08, 15.14, 14.51, 13.75, 14.31 and 18.02 mA cm−2 for the devices based on RGO-1, RGO-2, RGO-3, GO, dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD and doped spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, which are in general in good agreement with the measured photocurrent density. The higher IPCE values of the devices with RGO suggest that RGO was efficient to extract holes from the perovskite surface and subsequently transport them to the Au back electrode. The trend of IPCE is also consistent with that of PCEs for the corresponding perovskite solar cells.

Recently, an anomalous hysteresis in the J–V curves of perovskite solar cells has been widely observed.36–39 Determining the stabilized power output at a constant voltage around its maximum power point was recommended to provide reliable photovoltaic performance associated with the devices.38 As can be observed from Fig. 5c, for the devices with RGO-1, RGO-2, RGO-3, GO, dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD and doped spiro-OMeTAD, the photocurrent density stabilized within seconds to approximately 15.8, 14.5, 13.6, 11.0, 12.6 and 16.9 mA cm−2, yielding stabilized PCEs of 9.48%, 8.12%, 7.21%, 5.63%, 5.72% and 13.01%, respectively. This indicates that our test conditions provide an accurate representation for the photovoltaic performance of the devices, which is consistent with the J–V measurements with the FB-SC scan.
To better explain the working mechanism when introducing RGO into the hole transport layer, a schematic illustration demonstrating the hole transport pathways is shown for the RGO/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD bilayer HTM (Fig. 6a). Firstly, when RGO was interfaced with perovskite, holes could be extracted from the RGO/perovskite interface and subsequently transported through highly conductive RGO to the metallic back electrode rapidly. Although GO also has the ability to extract holes from perovskite, the insulating nature of GO would result in rather inefficient hole transportation in GO, thus leading to the photovoltaic performance decrease compared to RGO-based devices.26,27,40 On the other hand, dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD also could extract holes from perovskite and subsequently transport them to the back electrode. However, its low electrical conductivity results in a relatively low hole transport rate. An alternative route for hole transport in RGO/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD was that the holes in spiro-OMeTAD were transferred to RGO and finally reached the metallic back electrode via RGO because the work function of RGO (∼5.1 to ∼4.90 eV)41,42 is slightly lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.4 to −5.1 eV) (Fig. 6b).14,43 Therefore, RGO in the RGO/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD composite plays two roles: (1) extracting holes from perovskite and transporting them to the back electrode; (2) accepting holes from spiro-OMeTAD and then transporting the holes to the back electrode. The two synergized routes accompanied by extraction and transportation of holes by spiro-OMeTAD led to further photovoltaic performance enhancement of RGO-based perovskite solar cells.

Most importantly, the commercial viability of perovskite solar cells is strongly associated with their long-term stability when subjected to real working conditions. In fact, there are many factors that influence the stability of perovskite solar cells, such as temperature, moisture and so on.15,44 The ambient stability of perovskite solar cells fabricated with RGO and dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD as a function of storage time in the dark under ambient conditions (average temperature 20 ± 3 °C, average relative humidity 40 ± 7%) is shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2. For comparison, the perovskite solar cell with Li-TFSI and pyridine doped spiro-OMeTAD was also tested. The perovskite solar cells based on RGO or GO with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD showed significantly improved air stability compared with the doped spiro-OMeTAD-based device. The PCE of the RGO-1-based device remained above 85% of the initial value even after 500 h of storage in air, which is comparable with that of perovskite solar cells based on P3HT functional SWCNTs encapsulated with epoxy resin and stored in a nitrogen-filled glove box.16 The rest of the RGO-based devices also demonstrated stable PCEs over 85%. In contrast, the PCE of the device fabricated with doped spiro-OMeTAD decreased to 35% of its initial value within 500 h of storage in air, this trend is consistent with a previous report under similar ambient conditions.19 As aforementioned, the excellent stability of RGO/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD-based devices might originate from the absence of hydrophilic Li-TSFI and the corrosive pyridine additives.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that a p-type, highly conductive RGO reduced by ferrous iodide acid aqueous solution, combined with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD could be used as an efficient HTM for stable and high efficiency perovskite solar cells. The alternative routes for hole extraction and transportation by highly conductive RGO led to photovoltaic performance enhancement of RGO-based perovskite solar cells. Devices with RGO/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD achieved a PCE of 10.6%, greatly outperforming the reference devices based on pure dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, their significantly improved air stability (only 15% PCE degradation after 500 h of storage in air) compared to the device with Li-TSFI and pyridine doped spiro-OMeTAD demonstrated the potential use of hole-extraction RGO for fully replacing Li-TFSI and pyridine doping of spiro-OMeTAD. This work demonstrated that p-type and highly conductive RGO, combined with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD, is a promising hole extraction and transportation material in stable and high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.
