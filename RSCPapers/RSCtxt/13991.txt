    , Accepted 8th May 2015First published on 8th May 2015AbstractAn ultrasound-assisted impregnation deposition technique was adopted to construct Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles on TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) which were prepared by electrochemical anodization in a hydrofluoric acid system. The Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles were found to successfully deposit on the surface of the highly oriented TiO2 NTAs causing no damage to the ordered structure of the nanotubes. The as-prepared Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs exhibited much improved photoelectrochemical capability. Compared with pure TiO2 NTAs, a more than 2.36-fold enhancement in photo-current density and a 2.17-fold enhancement in photo-conversion efficiency of the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs were achieved. The photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activities of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs were evaluated by the degradation of toxic 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in aqueous solution under simulated sun light irradiation. The experimental results indicated that the heterostructure photoelectrode showed much higher PEC activity than the pure TiO2 NTAs for the degradation of 2.4-DCP under simulated sun light irradiation. In addition, electron spin resonance examination confirmed that the photogenerated active species (˙OH and ˙O2−) were involved in the PEC degradation of 2,4-DCP. A mechanism accounting for the enhanced PEC activity of the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs was proposed. The enhanced PEC activity of the nanocomposite electrode could be attributed to the synergistic effects between the lowered electron–hole recombination rate by the applied bias and the wider spectral response promoted by the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 component.
Introduction
Severe environmental pollution and depletion of fossil fuel resources have emerged as two major obstacles for the sustainable development of the human society.1 It is indispensable to develop green and efficient strategies to control and reduce pollution growth. Compared with traditional techniques, the photocatalytic (PC) process is very promising for the photodegradation of organic contaminants and other water pollutions.2–4 Among various oxide semiconductor photocatalysts, TiO2 has in particular attracted the most attention due to its outstanding properties such as strong photo-induced activity, photo-corrosion resistance, non-toxicity, cost-effective and environmentally friendly.5,6 As such, TiO2 NTs have been developed for a range of applications including water splitting,7 drug delivery,8 H2 production,9 CO2 reduction,10 sensor applications,11 and solar cells,12etc.
However, due to its wide band-gap of 3.2 eV (anatase), TiO2 can only be excited by ultraviolet or near-ultraviolet radiation, which occupies about 5% of the solar light spectrum on the earth.13 Furthermore, the relatively high recombination rate of photo-induced charge carriers hinders the practical applications. To overcome these intrinsic serious drawbacks of the wide-band-gap semiconductor, various strategies have been employed to improve the PC efficiency of TiO2 such as metal ion doping,14–16 nonmetal ion doping16–18 and suitable semiconductor composites.19–22 In addition, morphology modification could be performed for improving charge separation efficiency. For example, the construction of nanostructures such as nanowires (belts)23–25 and nanosheets,26,27 which could facilitate charge transportation and promote charge separation efficiently. Compared with other nanostructures, one-dimensional nanotubes exhibit a better PC activity because of their high surface area and spatially ordered dispersion.28
Recently, magnetic nanostructure has been of great scientific interest in a wide range of biomedical and chemical applications, including magnetic resonance imaging, triggered drug release, magnetic fluid hyperthermia and catalysis.29–33 Spinel ferrites such as Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 have attracted much interest because of their unusual magnetic properties for promising applications.32,34 Furthermore, an internal polarization of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 particles due to the pinning of ferrimagnetism domains in a preferred orientation would bend the TiO2 surface energy band upward/downward, which can be utilized to force photogenerated electrons–holes to separate.35 In a previous study, Jun Xie and his co-workers have successfully synthesized mono-dispersed magnetic Mn–Zn ferrite nanostructures with various morphologies via decomposition of metal acetylacetonate in the presence of oleic acid and oleyamine.31 Wenjie Wang has constructed the spinel ferrites Mn1−xZnxFe2O4 with citrate acid as a complex agent using the sol–gel combustion method.36 Xianming Liu has prepared nanocrystalline Zn0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 through the pyrolysis of polyacrylate salt precursors prepared via in situ polymerization of the metal salts and acrylic acid.37 To the best of our knowledge, as an attractive system with an enhanced performance, Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles decorated on the TiO2 NTA photoelectrode towards PC degradation of toxic pollutants have not been explored so far.
In this work, we have successfully synthesized Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs by combining the anodization of a titanium sheet with an ultrasound-assisted impregnation strategy followed by annealing. The morphology, crystalline structures, optical properties and photoelectrochemical performances of TiO2 NTAs and Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs were comparatively investigated. The photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activities of the as-prepared electrodes were evaluated in the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) aqueous solution under simulated sun light irradiation. The species involved in the dechlorination process were examined by high-performance liquid chromatogram-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and the photo-induced active species such as hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and superoxide radicals (˙O2−) were detected by electron spin resonance (ESR) examination. It is demonstrated that the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA nanocomposite electrode possesses significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical activity over pristine TiO2 NTAs.
Experimental
Construction of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 nanotube arrays
All solvents and reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. The electrolyte was freshly prepared from deionized water. The highly ordered TiO2 NTAs were synthesized by the anodic oxidation of a Ti foil in an HF electrolyte according to the literature.38 The Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles were deposited onto the crystallized TiO2 nanotubes using an ultrasound-immersion strategy, and the detailed procedures were described as follows. First, for the preparation of a Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 precursor, 0.99 g manganese chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2·4H2O 99%), 1.485 g zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O AR 99%) and 8.08 g ferric nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O AR 98.5%) were dissolved in 100 mL deionized water followed by the addition of 2.52 g citrate acid (C6H8O7·H2O 99.5%,) as a complexant and 2.68 mL ethylene glycol (C2H6O2 AR) as a dispersant into the solution. Then the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 4 with 0.1 M ammonia. The mixture was stirred for 2 h at 80 °C in an oil bath to form a sol. Second, the as-prepared TiO2 NTA electrode was immersed vertically into the sol followed by ultrasonic processing for 30 min at 40 kHz frequency in a digitally controlled ultrasonic cleaner. Then, the TiO2 NTA electrode was dried at 120 °C for 15 min. A desired deposition amount of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 sol into the TiO2 NTA pores was obtained after four repetitions of the ultrasound-immersing in sol followed by drying at 110 °C. Finally, the desired Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA electrode was obtained by annealing at 500 °C for 2 h with a temperature ramp rate of 2 °C min−1.
Characterization
The morphology of the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (Quanta 450) with an accelerating voltage of 30.0 kV. The dopant concentration was characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) (Horiba 7593H), and EDX was performed to determine the elemental concentration distribution on the catalyst granules using Link Isis Series 300 software. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were taken on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 with an acceleration voltage of 200 and 300 kV. Chloroform solutions containing these nanocomposite samples were dropped on carbon-coated copper grids. The crystallinity of the sample was determined from X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) using a diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (Shimadzu Lab-X XRD-6000, source light at a wavelength (λ) of 0.15406 nm). The accelerating voltage and applied current were 30 kV and 30 mA, respectively, while the diffraction angles (2θ) were scanned from 20° to 60°. Light absorption properties were measured using UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) (JASCO, UV-550) in a wavelength range of 200–700 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the electrodes were collected using a Hitachi F-4500 (excited at λ = 325 nm) fluorescence spectrophotometer in air at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (PHI 5600 mode) was performed to examine the surface properties and composition of the sample. All the binding energies were calibrated by using the carbon (C 1s) 284.6 eV as a reference. The intermedates were detected using a high performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC 1100-6410B, America Agilent Company). The ESR signals of the radicals trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were detected using a Bruker (E 500) spectrometer. The settings for the ESR spectrometer were as follows: center field = 3510 G; sweep width = 200 G; microwave frequency = 9.85 GHz; modulation frequency = 100 kHz; and power = 20 mW.
Photoelectrochemical and PEC measurement
Photo-current density was measured using a CHI electrochemical analyzer (CHI 760C, Shanghai Chenhua, China) in a standard three-electrode configuration with the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs as the photoanode (an effective area of 4.5 cm2), a platinum foil as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. A 0.01 M Na2SO4 (80 mL) solution was used as the electrolyte. The working electrode was irradiated with simulated sun light from a high-pressure xenon short arc lamp (a Phillips 500 W Xe lamp). The incident light intensity was measured using a radiometer (Photoelectric Instrument Factory Beijing Normal University, model FZ-A).
The PEC reaction of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) was carried out in a single photoelectrochemical compartment. The as-prepared electrode serving as a photoanode and a Pt foil as a cathode were placed in parallel in a cylindrical quartz reactor, and an SCE served as a reference electrode. All electrodes were connected to a CHI 760C EC analyzer. A bias potential applied on the photoanode was 0.6 V (vs. SCE) under a simulated sun light of 36 mW cm−2. All the experiments were performed with magnetic stirring, using a 0.01 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte. The initial concentration of the 2,4-DCP aqueous solution (100 mL) was 20 mg L−1. Dark (adsorption) experiments were carried out for 30 min under continuous stirring, to allow sufficient 2,4-DCP to be adsorbed onto the surface of the electrode. The concentration of 2,4-DCP was determined by using a 1100 spectrophotometer with a detective wavelength of 284 nm.
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of a photocatalyst

Fig. 1a shows the top-view SEM image of TiO2 NTAs, the inset figure is the cross-sectional image of TiO2 NTAs. The TiO2 NTAs prepared through electrochemical anodization exhibit a great orderliness with an average tube diameter of ∼90 nm and a wall thickness of ∼10 nm. The tube length of TiO2 NTAs reached ∼400 nm from the inset of Fig. 1a. The highly ordered one-dimensional architecture with a smooth top surface is tight in arrangement, which is highly favorable for uniform deposition of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles. Fig. 1b and c show the cross-sectional and top images of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs, the morphology of doped nanotubes still maintain the original frame structure. The corresponding cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 1b) shows that Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles were deposited inside the TiO2 NTAs. Fig. 1c shows that deposited particles mainly surround the entrance of the top tube without clogging at the nanotube entrance, which facilitates the charge transfer. The composition of the samples is determined by EDX. It is observed from Fig. 1d that the as-prepared Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA sample using an ultrasonic-immersion method contains Ti, O, Fe, Zn and Mn, and the atomic percentage of Fe, Zn, Mn is 2.81%:0.87%:0.75%.

To further investigate the microstructure characteristics of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles deposited on TiO2 NTAs, the low (Fig. 2a–c) and high magnification (Fig. 2d) TEM images of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs have been obtained. As illustrated by the low magnification TEM images in Fig. 2a–c, Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles are deposited on the inner and external tubes causing no damage of nanotubes. Fig. 2d depicts the HRTEM image of the selected area, where the lattice fringes of 0.206 nm, 0.296 nm and 0.351 nm correspond to the reflections from the (400), (220) planes of spinel Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 (JCPDS no. 74-2400)31 and the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272),39 respectively.

To gain further insight into the crystalline structures of composite nanotube arrays, we conduct the XRD characterization. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the Ti sheet, TiO2 NTAs and Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs. The 2θ peaks of the Ti sheet in 35.3°, 38.4°, 40.3° and 53.1° are in good agreement with those of the Ti metal phase of (100), (002), (101) and (102) planes (JCPDS no. 05-0682).39 Obviously, the TiO2 NTAs annealed at 500 °C possess the (101), (220) plane crystal structure of anatase (2θ = 25.3°, 48.1° JCPDS no. 21-1272).39 After the deposition of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4, three additional diffraction peaks are identified at 2θ = 29.78°, 35.1° and 56.3°, which are in accordance with the (220), (331) and (511) planes of spinel Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 (JCPDS no. 74-2401).40 The sharp peak near 35.2° in Fig. 3c is attributed to the overlap and accumulation of 35.3° from anatase and 35.1° from spinel ferrite. It should be noted that MnO, Fe2O3 and ZnO crystalline phases are not present in the obtained Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs. The XRD results indicate that the nanocomposite structures grown on Ti electrodes prepared by the ultrasound-assisted impregnation approach consist of spinel Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 and anatase TiO2 crystalline components.

Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra of the TiO2 NTAs and Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs with the wavelength from 200 nm to 700 nm. The absorption threshold of TiO2 NTAs is of about 385 nm, which is consistent with the intrinsic band-gap absorption of anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV). In addition, two characteristic absorption peaks of TiO2 at about 430 nm and 580 nm corresponded to the absorption of the trapped hole and the trapped electron, respectively, which result from the sub-band-gap energy levels of surface defects on TiO2 nanotubes.41 Compared with the pure TiO2 NTAs, the as-prepared Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs exhibit an increased absorption in the UV and visible light region and the band edges of the samples are shifted toward the visible light region (red shift). It is widely accepted that the higher light absorption under the same conditions may indicate the better PC activity.42 The Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs possesses the stronger absorption than non-doped samples, and thus the higher PC activity is expected.

In order to reveal the impact of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA photon-induced charge separation, migration and combination, PL properties of the samples are characterized. Fig. 5 presents the PL spectra of TiO2 NTAs and Mg0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs. The excitation wavelength of the samples tested was 325 nm. TiO2 NTAs and modified TiO2 NTAs in the vicinity of 400 nm exhibit a strong emission peak. Two weak emission peaks also exist at around 469 nm and 548 nm, respectively. The emission peak at around 400 nm is attributed to the band edge emission of TiO2 NTAs (intrinsic luminescence), corresponding to electron transitions between the emission bands.43 The two weak peaks at around 469 nm and 548 nm are ascribed to TiO2 NTAs with edges of free excitons and bound excitons, these PL signals are mainly owing to oxygen vacancies and defects generated on the nanoparticle surface.44,45 Compared with the PL spectra of TiO2 NTAs and doped TiO2 NTAs, the PL intensity of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs is significantly reduced. Since the PL spectrum results from the recombination of electrons and holes, a lower luminous intensity means less recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, the experimental results illustrate that the recombination ratio of photo-generated electron–hole pairs is lowered due to the loading of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4.46

XPS is employed to reveal the valence states and surface chemical compositions of the composite nanotube arrays. Elements of Ti, Mn, Zn, Fe and O are proven to be present in the nanocomposites (Fig. 6a). Carbon is ascribed to the adventitious hydrocarbon from the XPS instrument itself. In Fig. 6b, two peaks for the Ti 2p are observed at binding energies of 464.1 eV and 458.4 eV, which are assigned to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 respectively. These values are in good agreement with the XPS data known for Ti4+ in the pure anatase titania form in the corresponding literature.38 It seems that the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 loading does not have any significant effect on the position of the Ti 2p peak. As shown in Fig. 6c, two bands at 641.1 and 653.1 eV are observed and can be ascribed to the Mn 2d3/2 and Mn 2d1/2 binding energies, respectively, which is consistent with the results of Mn2+ values reported previously.47 In addition, XPS peaks of Zn 2p located at 1044.2 eV and 1021.1 eV should be assigned to the spectra of Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, suggesting that the composite electrode contains Zn2+.48 As shown in the spectrum in Fig. 6e, the peaks at 710.7 eV and 724.4 eV can be attributed to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 for Fe3+, respectively. This reveals the oxidation state of Fe3+ in the composite.49 The XPS spectrum of the O 1s region was also detected, as shown in Fig. 6f. The O 1s peak is asymmetric, suggesting that at least two kinds of oxygen species are present in and near the surface region. Meanwhile, the XPS spectra of O 1s of the composite NTAs were fitted using Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shapes, which can be devolved into three small peaks. The peak located at 532.4 eV is assigned to the adsorbed oxygen. The other two peaks located at 529.4 eV and 530.7 eV are attributed to the O element in TiO2 and Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4, respectively.50 By XPS quantitative analysis of each element, we could conclude that proportion of Fe, Zn and Mn elements for the surface of the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA electrode is approximately 8.61:2.42:3.04.

Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photo-current density versus voltage (I–V) characteristics of the as-prepared electrodes are presented in Fig. 7. Potential-dynamic scans on the TiO2 and Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA electrode are performed from −1.0 to 1.0 V vs. SCE with a scanning rate of 2 mV s−1 under simulated sun light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7a, a significant increase in the photo-current density is observed across the potential window for the modified nanotube arrays under simulated sun light irradiation. The maximum photo-current density of the modified electrode is 1.32 mA cm−2, which is better than the pure TiO2 NTAs (0.56 mA cm−2). Fig. 7b shows the photo-conversion efficiency (%) as a function of applied potential for the TiO2 and Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs under simulated sun light irradiation. The maximum photo-conversion efficiency of 2.23% was observed for the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA electrode, while it was only 1.025% for the TiO2 NTAs. The photo-conversion efficiency could be calculated according to the formula from the reported literature.39

In order to study the properties of the electrodes and their interactions with the solution, the EIS measurements of the TiO2 NTAs and Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs are carried out, which cover the frequencies of 105 to 10−2 Hz intervals by an amplitude of 10 mV at an open circuit potential under dark and simulated sun light irradiation.50Fig. 8 exhibits the EIS Nyquist plots of TiO2 NTA and Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA electrodes under dark and light illumination in the 0.01 M Na2SO4 electrolyte with the bias voltage set to 0.3 V. It could be found that without any light irradiation, the Nernst curve of TiO2 NTAs becomes close to a straight line, indicating that the TiO2 NTA electrode response is poor without any light irradiation (see Fig. 8). The impedance of the radius of the TiO2 NTA electrode decreases sharply after Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 loading or with simulated sun light irradiation. EIS measurement results illustrate that Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 loading improves the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs effectively and accelerates the photo-generated charge transfer between the Zn0.5Mg0.5Fe2O4 and TiO2 NTA interface. It could be concluded that the dopant Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles effectively accelerate the transfer of photo-generated charge carriers.

PEC activity
To evaluate the PEC activity, we have conducted the 2,4-DCP degradation by TiO2 NTA and Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA electrodes under simulated sun light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 9a, after 120 min reaction, the 2,4-DCP PC degradation efficiency over TiO2 NTAs reaches 13%, while the 2,4-DCP degradation rate in the PC process with a Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA electrode is 27.6%. Fig. 9b shows a comparison of the electrochemical (EC) process, direct photolysis (DP) process, PC and PEC activity of the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs for the degradation of 2,4-DCP. Obviously, the PEC process gains the most efficient degradation efficiency for 2,4-DCP, with nearly 99.9% removal after 120 minutes under simulated sun light irradiation. Meanwhile, only 27.6% of 2,4-DCP degradation efficiency is obtained in the PC process during the same illumination time. The degradation by the EC was even less significant with about 12.2% of 2,4-DCP decomposed. In addition, the degradation efficiency of 2,4-DCP only reached 12.55% during the DP process. The results show that the applied bias potential inhibits the recombination of the photogenerated hole–electron pairs effectively and prolongs the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers. A pseudo-first-order kinetic model was employed to fit the degradation data by using the linear transformation: ln(C0/Ct) = F(t) = kt (k is the kinetic constant).51 As shown in Fig. 10, the kinetic constants of 2,4-DCP degradation by TiO2 in the PEC process and in the EC DP, PC, and PEC processes by Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 are 3.5 × 10−3, 1.1 × 10−3, 1.2 × 10−3, 2.8 × 10−3 and 5.1 × 10−3 min−1, respectively. The corresponding regression coefficients are 0.9924, 0.996, 0.9827, 0.9963 and 0.7545.

Fig. 11 depicts the removal efficiency of 2,4-DCP and total organic carbon (TOC) in order to investigate the mineralization of 2,4-DCP in different times. During 120 min irradiation, the TOC is reduced continuously at a lower rate compared with the PEC degradation of 2,4-DCP. Only about 58.4% of 2,4-DCP is mineralized while the PEC degradation of 2,4-DCP has reached almost 100%. The different removal efficiency indicates that some intermediate products are generated during the decomposition of 2,4-DCP, which are not mineralized into CO2 and H2O in the degradation process, and it is expected that complete mineralization of 2,4-DCP needs more irradiation time.

Hydroxyl radicals and superoxide
The main active species involved in the PC process were examined in the experiments of in situ capture of active species. As shown in Fig. 12, the PEC degradation of 2,4-DCP was inhibited to some extent by the addition of t-BuOH (hydroxyl radical scavenger) under simulated sun light irradiation, indicating that the free radicals were a major active oxidizing species in the PC process. However, it was intensively suppressed when EDTA (holes scavenger) was introduced. This result indicates that holes were the main active oxidizing species involved in the PC process compared with other active species. The direct hole transfer mainly governed the PC process.52 Meanwhile, ˙O2− might also serve as active species in this reaction. N2 was used to confirm the effect of O2 and the results are shown in Fig. 12. Under the anoxic conditions, the degradation of 2,4-DCP was not completely inhibited, indicating that ˙O2− was active species but not the main one. To better confirm these results, the system was examined using the FL spectroscopy to monitor the active radicals during the PC reaction process. It is well known that ˙OH reacts with TA and generates 2-hydroxy terephthalic acid (TAOH), which emits fluorescence at around 426 nm upon the excitation of its own 312 nm absorption band.53 As shown in Fig. 13, the PL intensity at 426 nm was significantly increased with the irradiation time extended, indicating that ˙OH was produced on the surface of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 under simulated sun light irradiation.

To further elucidate the above postulation, the ESR technique was conducted to detect the active species such as hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical species. As shown in Fig. 14a, four characteristic peaks (1:2:2:1) of DMPO–˙OH after irradiating of the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 composite electrode by simulated sun light (curve IV) can be observed, while weak peaks of curve III could be detected for Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 irradiated by visible light and no such signals for Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 (curve II) and unloaded TiO2 (curve I) under dark conditions. Similarly, it could be observed from Fig. 14b, the six characteristic peaks of the DMPO–˙O2− adducts are also detected under simulated sun light irradiation in methanol dispersions of the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 composite electrode (curve IV), while feeble six peaks can be observed with the composite electrode illuminated by visible light (curve III). It could also be found that there are no such signals for the doped electrode (curve II) and pure TiO2 NTAs (curve I) under dark conditions. ESR results indicate that simulated sun light irradiation is crucial to the generation of ˙OH radical and ˙O2− radical species, and it is confirmed that both ˙OH and ˙O2− are produced on the surface of the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 electrode and these species with strong oxidation capability act as the predominant species in the PC reaction.

Suggested PC degradation mechanism
To gain further insight into the degradation mechanism, the degradation intermediates of 2,4-DCP during the PEC process of 2 h were monitored by HPLC-MS. Fig. 15 displayed the HPLC of 2,4-DCP PEC degradation using the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA electrode after 2 h under simulated sun light irradiation. Fig. 15 I exhibited the total ion chromatogram (TIC), and the corresponding ion chromatograms of 2,4-DCP, 2-chloro-1,4-benzenediol (or its isomers 4-chloro-1,2-benzenediol), and 3,5-dichlorocatechol extracted from TIC, which were shown as Fig. 15b–d. As shown from Fig. 15b, the intensity of 2,4-DCP at the retention time of 2.7 min was significantly reduced with the irradiation time extending. It could also be found that the intensity of 2-chloro-1,4-benzenediol (or 4-chloro-1,2-benzenediol) and 3,5-dichlorocatechol gradually grew to the maximum value, then decreased with the irradiation time extended (Fig. 15c and d). According to the HPLC-MS analysis, the peak with a retention time of 2.7 min (m/z = 162) was attributed to the initial 2,4-DCP, and the other peaks appearing at 1.6 min (m/z = 144), 2.15 min (m/z = 178) were assigned to be 2-chloro-1,4-benzenediol (or 4-chloro-1,2-benzenediol) and 3,5-dichlorocatechol respectively. The specific mass spectra could be seen from the ESI.† A possible pathway of 2,4-DCP degradation was then proposed in the following scheme. First, 2,4-DCP was found to hydroxylate to 3,5-dichlorocatechol or detected to dechlorinate to 2-chloro-1,4-benzenediol (or 4-chloro-1,2-benzenediol). Subsequently, 2-chloro-1,4-benzenediol was dehydrogenated to 2-chloro-1,4-benzoquinone (Fig. 16).

After ring cleavage, the formation of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as fumaric acid occurred, which were then degraded into oxalic acid and finally mineralized to CO2 and H2O. These findings are also consistent with the results reported by W. Chu et al. on the reaction pathway of 2,4-DCP transformation by photo-fenton-like oxidation,54 and Enric Brillas et al. on degradation of the herbicide 2,4-DCP by catalyzed ozonation using the O3/Fe2+/UVA system.55
The stability and recyclability of the as-prepared electrode were evaluated by repeating 2,4-DCP degradation under simulated sun light irradiation several times. Before each repeating experiment, the as-prepared electrode was ultrasonically cleaned with deionised water and the PEC degradation of each new cycle was carried out by introducing fresh 2,4-DCP solution (20 mg L−1) and 0.01 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 17, the degradation efficiencies of 2,4-DCP showed no obvious decline in the PEC activity of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs after five recycles. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTA electrode exhibits fair stability and can be optimized as a suitable candidate for PEC purification of toxic chlorophenol polluted water.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 NTAs through deposition of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles on TiO2 NTAs obtained by electrochemical anodization using an ultrasound-assisted impregnation deposition. Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles greatly promoted the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges and thus effectively enhanced the photo-conversion efficiency and PC activity of TiO2 NTAs under simulated sun light irradiation. Furthermore, the nanocomposite electrode was found to possess excellent PEC activity for the degradation of 2,4-DCP compared with a non-doped TiO2 electrode under simulated sun light illumination. The mechanism of the PEC reaction has been speculated according to the results by HPLC-MS as well as the active species detected by ESR and PL strategies. Consequently, the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/TiO2 heterostructure photoelectrodes described here may be used in a wide range of applications besides photocatalysis.
