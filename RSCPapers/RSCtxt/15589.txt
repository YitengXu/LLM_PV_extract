First published on 28th April 2011AbstractThis article reviews the literature reported during 2010 on conducting solids including both ionic and electronic conductors. The review focuses in particular on materials which have particular relevance in solid oxide fuel cell, lithium ion battery and superconductor applications.
Highlights
The key highlights of the year for lithium ion batteries include the investigation of the silver vanadium oxy fluorides and the formation of the new materials Ag4V2O6F2 and Ag3VO2F4 by Sauvage et al. Dedryvere et al. have investigated the surface electrolyte interface layer on the anode material Li4Ti5O12 at high voltages and have discovered an organic based SEI layer rather than a lithium compound. A key highlight in the areas of superconductivity and solid oxide fuel cells has been the use of Raman spectroscopy to improve our understanding of materials properties. In particular Orera et al. have provided information on the location of oxide ion interstitial defects in apatite germanates and their defect trapping, while Zhang et al. have provided evidence for spin dependent electron phonon coupling in iron pnictide superconductors.

        Lithium ion
There has been a vast amount of work published in the field of lithium-ion batteries, several reviews give a good overview of the different technologies and current technical status and future requirements. Tarascon has reviewed the role of lithium ion batteries and the key challenges in future research and development.1 Goodenough et al.2 have discussed the challenges for lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles. In particular the main aspect discussed is safety, and the steps to improve the intrinsic safety of a lithium ion battery.
1.1 Cathodes
There are currently several structure-types of lithium ion cathode material being investigated; these include in particular: the mixed metal layered oxides LiMO2, olivines (LiMPO4), silicates (Li2MSiO4), and the fluoro-phosphates and -sulfates LiM(P/S)O4F (where M = Ni, Co, Mn, V). Yu et al.3 have reviewed the current cathode materials and have discussed the relationship between the crystal structure, lithium ion diffusion and electrochemical performance in terms of the dimensionality of the systems. Olivines, layered oxides, spinel, NASICON and orthogonal silicates were compared. Novel cathode electrodes for lithium ion batteries with better characteristics than these materials are very difficult to find.

Layered oxides. 
Layered oxide materials such as LiCoO2 and LiMn1/3Ni1/3Co1/3O2 still offer some of the highest energy density cathodes for lithium-ion batteries and are still highly researched in terms of their synthesis, composition and properties. Methods to improve the stability include doping and surface coatings, as reviewed by Yu et al.3
A more recent advancement in cathode technology is in the LiMO2/Li2MnO3 mixed systems, also known as the lithium excess metal oxide systems. These systems exhibit high specific capacities of over 200 mA h g−1 and have many different compositional possibilities. Fell et al.4 have investigated the relationship between the synthesis, crystal structure and electrochemical properties of the high capacity, lithium rich, layered metal oxide, Li[NixLi1/3−2x/3Mn2/3−x/3]O2(0 < x < 1/2). Stoichiometric samples were obtained by heat treatment at 1000 °C followed by furnace cooling. Capacities of 250, 230 and 200 mA h g−1 were observed for x = 0.2, 0.25 and 0.33 respectively in the voltage range 2–4.8 V vs.Li. Van Bommel et al.,5 have investigated the kinetics of oxygen loss in Li[Li1/9Ni1/3Mn5/9]O2 samples of varying particle sizes during the first charge. Oxygen diffusion constants of 3 × 10−13 and 2 × 10−12 cm2s−1 were observed for the oxygen-loss process at 30 and 55 °C, respectively, which is significantly lower than typical lithium diffusion constants in layered oxides. The cobalt-free layered oxide Li[Li1/9Ni1/3Mn5/9]O2 was synthesised with a 3 μm particle size and exhibited a specific capacity of 240 mA h g−1 at 55 °C with negligible loss.6
The performances of varying composites of the 2-D layered cathode materials, LiNiO2, LiCoO2, and Li2MnO3, have been investigated with the use of a compositional phase diagram.7 The highest capacity of 244 mA h g−1 at C/15 rate was observed in the voltage range 2–4.6 V vs.Li, with good coulombic efficiency and cyclability. Wei et al.8 have investigated the high rate habit-tuned nanoplates of Li(Li0.17Ni0.25Mn0.58)O2. It was observed that with an increased proportion of the 010 nanoplates much higher rates could be achieved, which is reported to be due to the increased proportion of the lithium ion transport along the 010 surfaces.
Improvements in cyclability and high voltage stability have been observed by surface coating composites. Park et al.9 have used Al2O3 and AlPO4 surface coatings to improve the safety properties of the lithium excess transition metal oxides Li[Li1−x−yMexMny]O2 (Me = Ni, Co, Fe). Structural and electrochemical analysis indicated that significantly improved safety properties were achieved not only by the materials forming a surface coating, but also by aluminium substitution into the transition metal layers. Other reported methods which improve the safety properties include the synthesis of a high voltage core-shell structured layered composite cathode, Li[(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)0.8(Ni1/2Mn1/2)0.2]O2.10 The Li[(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 core was encapsulated by a Li[Ni1/2Mn1/2]O2 shell synthesised using a coprecipitation method. When the material was cycled in the voltage range 3–4.5 V vs.Li, a 99% retention in capacity was observed after 100 cycles. Safety tests indicated a higher exothermic onset temperature of 272 °C compared to 261 °C in the uncoated material.


Spinels. 

            Manganese spinels are intrinsically safer materials than the layered oxides because of the framework structure. The manganese spinel LiMn2O4 is a well known 4 V vs Li cathode material; the nickel manganese spinel operates at a higher voltage (5 V vs.Li). Santhanamet al.11 have reviewed the recent advancements that have been made in the high voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode. Dedryvere et al.12 have partnered a high-voltage spinel oxide cathode with a Li4Ti5O12 anode resulting in 3 V lithium-ion batteries. It was observed that the electrochemical performances were limited by the electrode/electrolyte interfacial reactivity at high voltages. The electrode/electrolyte interfaces of LiMn1.6Ni0.4O4/Li4Ti5O12 cells were investigated and film formation and electroadsorption was observed at the interface of the positive electrode. XPS showed low levels of a lithiated species and large quantities of organic species to be present. Li4Ti5O12 is usually considered as a passivation free electrode, however this work indicates otherwise. The mechanism for the formation of the surface films was discussed.
 

Iron
 cathodes can reduce the cost of a lithium ion battery considerably, since the transition metals cobalt and nickel are expensive and the price can fluctuate vastly. The use of Na2FeO4 as a cathode material has also been demonstrated.13 The material is extremely low cost as it can be made with very low cost starting materials. Na2FeO4 exhibits a capacity of 485 mA h g−1. The reversible capacity is obtained through a 3-electron Faradaic reduction reaction at approximately 4 V vs. Li where, upon lithiation, Fe2O3, lithium oxide and sodium oxide are produced.
Two lithium ion fluorides (α and β) of formula Li3FeF6, have been synthesised by Gonzalo et al.14 Both the α (monoclinic) and β (orthorhombic) forms are related to the cryolite-type structure. The α polymorph was synthesised by a low temperature route in aqueous solution; after milling the α-Li3FeF6 for 5 h a reversible capacity of 0.45 Li/per formula unit (FU) was observed at 3 V whilst the β polymorph showed a reversible capacity of only 0.12 Li /FU. Both polymorphs showed an increase in observed capacity with a decrease in particle size, with the largest capacity of 100 mA h g−1 (0.7 Li) being obtained after 12 hours milling time for α-Li3FeF6. The trirutile phase Li2TiF6 was also synthesised and tested for its electrochemical performance.15 A specific capacity of 100 mA h g−1 at 2.7 V was observed. The lithium ion diffusion in the 4 V vanadium analogue, α-Li3VF6 was investigated using NMR techniques. Lithium ion migration was shown to occur via two of the structural lithium sites (Li1 and Li3) and these lithium ions are expected to be removed first during a delithiation process. It is suggested that the relatively low ionic diffusivity at room temperature could be increased by the initial removal of these lithium ions.16
 

Polyanion
             structures such as phosphates, sulfates and borates possess much improved safety properties compared to the mixed metal oxides. This safety enhancement is structure-related as the oxygen is held within the polyanion and the stability of the compounds is increased.



Phosphates
          . 
With respect to the phosphates, Liu et al.17 have synthesised Fe2P-LiFePO4 composites via a coprecipitation method with an in situpolyacrylamide (PAM) formation. The highest capacity of 131 mA h g−1 was obtained at C/5 rate with 14 wt% in situPAM precursor under a sintering temperature of 750 degrees C for 20 h, and no capacity fading was observed after 30 cycles. Manganese, nickel and cobalt phosphates offer an improvement in energy density compared to the iron analogue, due to the higher redox potential of these transition metal cations. For the manganese analogue, the electrochemical activity is much reduced compared to the iron system, and several methods to improve this have been investigated. Bakenov et al.18 has investigated the magnesium doped manganese phosphate LiMgxMn1−xPO4/C (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.12) synthesised by spray pyrolysis followed by wet ball milling and heat-treatment. The material had an average particle size of 100 nm and a capacity of 154 mA h g−1 was observed at 0.1 C when cycled to 4.9 V vs.Li. The cobalt and nickel analogues were synthesised by Koleva et al.19 Homogenous precursors, made by freeze drying aqueous solutions of metals and LiH2PO4, were heat treated to form the olivines. Single phases of the cobalt phosphate and of the nickel phosphate were achieved by heating to 450 °C and 700 °C respectively, and particle sizes of between 190 and 380 nm respectively were observed. Chen et al.20 have synthesized the high voltage LiCo1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3PO4 material by a solid state reaction. A capacity of 140 mA h g−1 at a 0.05 C rate was observed. From in situXRD analysis, LiCo1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3PO4 was shown to have a high stability during cell cycling and can operate at 5 V vs.Li. Within the olivine structure, the transition metal cations share the same site; however, the contribution from the cobalt II/III redox is only 20 mA h g−1 which is much lower than the contribution for iron or manganese. This phenomena is reported to be due to the low diffusivity of lithium for the cobalt redox process compared to the other transition metals. The mixed transition metal phosphate has also been synthesised via a coprecipitation route using a mixed oxalate precursor.21 The stoichiometry and the distribution of transition metals was extremely sensitive to the coprecipitation process and environmental control. In the optimised material, three distinct contributions from each transition metal were observed with a first discharge capacity of 150.5 mA h g−1 reported. Good capacity retention upon cycling was recorded, with capacities of 102 and 81 mA h g−1 observed at 4 C and 6 C rate.

Fluorophosphates have attracted interest, and Recham et al.22 have synthesised the fluoride based materials LiFePO4F and LiTiPO4F by ionothermal synthesis methods. The phases have been obtained at temperatures of ≈260 °C rather than 600–700 °C required by the solid state method. The fluorine-containing phases exhibit lower redox voltages than the olivine materials. The titanium analogues show redox contributions from the Ti2+/3+ and Ti3+/4+redox couples, whilst the iron analogues show only a small capacity contribution from the Fe3+/4+redox couple. The vanadium analogue LiVPO4F has been prepared by a two-step carbothermal reduction method.23 When tested in a lithium anode cell, the material was initially cycled between 3 and 4.5 V at 15 mA g−1 and stable capacity of 130 mA h g−1 was observed up to 200 cycles, with slow capacity fade up to 360 cycles. When the rate was increased to 0.92 C, a stable reversible capacity of 122 mA h g−1 was observed between 200–800 cycles with a slow capacity fade between 800–1260 cycles and an overall capacity loss of 14%. Ellis et al.24 have investigated the properties of (Li,Na)2FePO4F synthesised using solid state and hydrothermal routes. Crystal structure analysis of a Na2FePO4F single crystal grown by a flux method indicated that the structure contains pairs of face-sharing metal octahedra and 7-coordinate sodium ions. Lithium exchange for sodium was achieved by refluxing with lithium salts. A sloping solid solution type voltage profile was observed upon charge and discharge due to a combination of redox processes which occur with little structural strain. Mossbauer spectroscopy has indicated a localisation of the Fe2+/Fe3+ in the mixed oxidation state intermediate Na1.5FePO4F with a small structural distortion observed. Cobalt and nickel analogues have also been synthesised with an active redox potential of 4.8 V for cobalt, while the mixed material Na2(Fe1−xMx)PO4F, where M = Co, Mg, was also investigated with promising results. Sodium vanadium fluorophosphate, NaVPO4F, has been synthesised by a modified sol–gel process and subsequent heat treatment.25 Upon heating, the phase changes from a monoclinic structure to tetragonal at about 750 °C. When tested with a lithium anode, the hybrid lithium-ion cathode shows an even discharge plateau at 3.6 V vs.lithium in the voltage range 3.0–4.2 V, with a capacity retention of 98.7% after 100 cycles at 0.25 C and with an initial specific capacity of 117 mA h g−1 charge and 106.8 mA h g−1 discharge being observed when charged to 4.5 V vs.lithium.



            NASICON
          . 
Xiong et al.26 have investigated nano-LiVOPO4 synthesised by a rheological phase method. 10–60 nm sized particles were obtained which exhibited initial discharge and charge capacities of 136, A h g−1 and 145 mA h g−1 respectively and showed a capacity retention of 98.9% after 60 cycles. At rates of 1 C and 2 C capacity retention was 96.5 and 91.6%. Dai et al.27 have synthesized Li3(V1−xMgx)2(PO4)3 (0, 0.04, 0.07, 0.10 and 0.13) by a carbothermal reduction (CTR) process using LiOH, vanadium oxide, magnesium acetate ammonium phosphate and sucrose. Powder X-ray diffraction and SEM show that for x = 0.04, 0.07, 0.10 and 0.13, the materials possessed a similar monoclinic structure to undoped Li3V2(PO4)3 with a smaller particle size. Impedance spectroscopy indicated the charge transfer resistance of the doped materials to be reduced. For x = 0.1 at 20 C, the discharge capacity was 107 mA h g−1 and the capacity retention was 98% after 80 cycles. Full cells have been tested with a graphite anode and good compatibilities were observed.

            Li2FeP2O7 was synthesized by a solid-state synthesis reaction and specific capacities of 110 mA h g−1 were observed for large μm particles with no carbon coating or nanosizing. Operating voltages of 3.5 V vs.lithium were obtained in a single electron redox reaction.28
 

Sulfate
 fluorides are being reinvestigated as potential cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries and in this respect LiFeSO4F and NaFeSO4F have been synthesized by reaction in hydrophilic tetraethylene glycol at 220 °C.29 This method is reported to avoid the need to use and recycle costly ionic liquids during the synthesis. The lithium insertion in these materials is reversible and is facilitated by the close structural similarity of the lattice with the parent tavorite-type monoclinic C21/c FeSO4F. The sodium analogue NaFeSO4F was also synthesised via heating of FeSO4·7H2O under a nitrogen and hydrogen atmosphere and then reacting the macroporous FeSO4·H2O with NaF in TEG for 60 hours to form 200 nm sized particles with fast ionic diffusion properties. The similarly obtained lithium analogue LiFeSO4F exhibited a reversible capacity of 130 mA h g−1 at C/10 equivalent to 0.86 Li transfer with an average potential of 3.6 V vs.Li and insignificant capacity fading upon cycling. NaFeSO4F was also investigated in a lithium anode cell; after charging to 4.5 V vs. Li only 55% of the theoretical capacity was observed with no further improvement upon cycling. This indicates that the alkali metal cations in this material are poorly accessible. However, complete oxidation was observed in the sodium iron sulfate fluoride using more oxidising chemical treatment. Barpanda et al.30 have investigated the structural and electrochemical properties of the sodium metal sulfate fluorides. The NaMSO4F phases possess a monoclinic-type structure, rather than the triclinic–type structure observed in the lithium based systems. Using an ionothermal solid-state synthesis method, solid solutions of the type Na(Fe1−xMx)SO4F and (Na1−xLix)MSO4F (M = Fe, Co, Ni) have also been synthesised at temperatures less than 300 °C. The sodium analogue NaFeSO4F is the only phase reported to show Fe2+/Fe3+ redox activity at 3.6 V vs.lithium, with an ionic diffusion of 10−7 S cm−1. Ati et al.31 have also synthesised the 3d-metal fluorosulfates LiFeSO4F, using a hydrothermal process. The initial hydrothermal process led to the formation of a monoclinic (P21/m) NaMSO4F·2H2O material; the structure of this material is that of an uklonskovite-type structure similar to NaMgSO4F·2H2O. The hydrated phases showed no redox activity with either lithium or sodium and have room temperature conductivities of 1 × 10−9 S cm−1. The tavorite-type structures were made by the controlled dehydration of the sulfate fluoride hydrates and in these structures conductivities of 10−7 S cm−1 were observed.
A lithium manganese borate was synthesized by Chen et al.,32 using a single step solid state synthesis route at 850 °C. The initial specific capacity observed upon discharge was 75.5 mA h g−1 at a current density of 5 mA g−1 with a current fade of 0.08% per subsequent cycle. Cyclic voltammetry showed the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple to be between 2.23 and 4.13 V vs.Li as shown by the anodic and cathodic sweeps. The LiMnBO3 compound exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 42.3 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and the capacity fade per cycle was only 0.2% during 40 cycles. Analysis after cycling experiments indicated fully reversible lithium ion insertion and a stable hexagonal LiMnBO3 structure was observed.

Silicates have also been investigated as cathode materials for lithium ion batteries, and in this respect several methods to synthesise materials of formula Li2MSiO4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) have been reported. Aravindan et al.33 have synthesised Li2MnSiO4 nano particles using an adipic acid sol–gel synthesis. This synthesis route produced crystalline particles with an orthorhombic structure of 30 nm in diameter. The oxidation state of manganese was confirmed to be Mn2+ from EPR measurements and, when tested in an electrochemical cell, the manganese silicate exhibited reversible capacities of 125 mA h g−1 over 50 cycles. Deng et al.34 have synthesised nano particles of Li2FeSiO4 and Li2MnSiO4via a citric acid assisted sol–gel method. Both materials exhibited similar lattice parameters. The iron analogue exhibited a specific capacity of 153 mA h g−1 with 98% of its maximum discharge still observed after 50 cycles. The manganese material however showed a reversible capacity of only 70 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles. Dominko et al.35 have studied the mixed material Li2Fe0.8Mn0.2SiO4 made via a hydrothermal method. Using in situ techniques during electrochemical characterisation, the iron was observed to be almost fully reversibly oxidised to Fe3+, whilst only a small proportion of the manganese was reversibly oxidised. When the manganese doping was low, the local environment was stabilised during oxidation. Nuli et al.36 synthesised magnesium silicate materials using mesoporous silica SBA-15 or KIT-6 as a template and silica source. The materials showed improved magnesium intercalation compared to bulk materials. The discharge capacity of Mg1.03Mn0.97SiO4 synthesised using SBA and KIT was 301 and 214 mA h g−1 at a discharge voltage of 1.65 V vs.Mg. The KIT-6 synthesised material exhibited 96% of its initial capacity after 20 cycles at 0.2 C. Armstrong et al.37 have studied the polymorphism of Li2CoSiO4 using a combined diffraction and NMR study. The β(II) polymorph was obtained from hydrothermal synthesis at 150 °C; further heat treatments led to the β(I) polymorph at 700 °C and the γ phase from heating to 1000 °C with subsequent quenching from 850 °C. Neutron and X-ray diffraction patterns indicated significant Co(II) and lithium mixing in the β(II) phase whilst less disorder was observed in the β(I) phase and none in the γ. Li-7 NMR also indicated similar disorder in the β phases but showed a single broad NMR peak in the γ phase rather than two well-defined different environments as predicted from the diffraction data. This indicates a more complicated cation arrangement than diffraction suggests.

1.2 Anodes
The standard anode for lithium ion batteries is graphite, which intercalates lithium between the layers and has a specific capacity of 300 mA h g−1. Cabana et al.38 has discussed the current status of conversion reactions used to actively store lithium in electrodes for lithium ion batteries. This mechanism is mainly observed upon lithiation of transition metal oxides and sulfides such as Fe2O3, CoS, Co2O3 and CuO, where metallic particles and Li2O, or Li2S are formed. This is an interesting and alternative approach to intercalation compounds. Park et al.39 have reviewed lithium alloy anode materials with a focus on the mechanistic aspects of lithium alloying in the Group IV and V elements and their composites.

Metal oxides. 
In terms of the transition metal oxide conversion anodes, Cheng et al.40 have investigated a mesoporous carbon encapsulated NiO nanocomposite. The electrode consists of a 3D CMK-3 ordered mesoporous current collector with NiO nano particles precipitated within the mesoporous carbon using the hydrophobic encapsulation route. In a lithium anode cell, the composite is reported to deliver 812 mA h g−1 first discharge at a C rate of 1000 mA g−1, with 0.24% capacity loss per cycle. Capacities of 808 mA h g−1 are also observed for rates of 3200 mA g−1. These results indicate high kinetics for the conversion reaction of NiO and no blockage of the lithium transport pore channels by the nickel oxide nanoparticles.
A graphene nanosheet (GNS) and Fe3O4 composite was synthesised via the in situreduction of iron hydroxide between the GNS’s.41 The composite exhibited a reversible capacity of 1026 mA h g−1 at a rate of 35 mA g−1 with a capacity of 580 mA h g−1 observed after 100 cycles at 700 mA g−1. It was proposed that the graphene sheets, whilst being excellent electronic conductors, provide a flexible confinement of the Fe3O4 particles. This compensates for the volume expansion during discharge, whilst also preventing the agglomeration of pulverised Fe3O4. Wang et al.42 have synthesised novel peapod like cobalt and carbon composite nanostructures. The nanostructures possess Co or Co3O4 nano particles, of approximately 20 nm in size, inside a graphitised layered structure. The Co3O4/carbon exhibited high capacities of 1000 mA h g−1 at C and 800 mA g−1 at 10 C rate charge and discharge, with good reversibilities observed. A multilayered Co3O4 hollow spheres anode assembled from Co3O4 sheets has been synthesised by Wang et al.43 by using PVP (poly(vinylpyrrolidone)) soft template with cobalt glycolate. The double-shelled hollow structures (D-Co) exhibited a capacity of 866 mA h g−1 over 50 cycles at a current rate of C/5. The enhanced lithium insertion properties are due to the small diffusion path lengths and the layer structures; it is hypothesised that the voids between the layers allow the expansion of the Co3O4 during lithiation with no structure deformation.

            Lu
            et al.44 have investigated core-shell V2O5/TiO2 nanobelts synthesised by a low temperature hydrothermal method. The V2O5 nanobelts were coated with a thin layer of TiO2 sol, which was then sintered to form V2O5 nanobelts and a TiO2 anatase shell. The different synthesis parameters such as the transition metal ratio and the sintering temperature effected the morphology and the composition of the core-shell particles. Minakshi,45 has investigated Sn–MnO2 cells with an aqueous lithium hydroxide electrolyte. The cell is reported to operate at 1 V with a reversible capacity of 110 mA h g−1 with 85% of the initial capacity being observed after 50 cycles. To increase the capacity, 1–5 wt% of MgO was added to the MnO2. MoS2 anodes, synthesised via an exfoliation process and subsequent restacking, were reported to exhibit high capacities of 1600 mA h g−1 when cycled at a rate of 60 mA g−1 over 50 cycles with good rate performances when used as an anode material in a lithium metal anode cell.46


Titanates. 
There has been a large quantity of papers on the titanate anode materials, in particular the Li4Ti5O12 and TiO2 high voltage anodes, several reviews cover most of the work performed in the synthesis methods and the development status. Yiet al.47 have reviewed Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) with respect to high power and high energy density applications such as electric vehicles. The review focuses on the current status of the LTO anode, the properties, routes to synthesis, structure modifications by doping or surface treatments, and on potential future developments. Zhou et al.48 have summarised the recent advances in the TiO2 anodes, in particular the 1-D nanostructures such as nanowires and nanorods. The physical properties of the structure, such as adsorption, stability, ion-exchange, optical, and proton conductivity properties, were described with respect to a particular application, for example, lithium ion batteries, sensors, hydrogen storage and solar cells. In particular the mechanism and formation of the 1-D titanates produced by the alkaline hydrothermal methods was discussed in detail.
Koudriachova et al.49 have used ab initio calculations to study the lithium insertion of several titanate structures. The mechanism is based upon accommodating the electron density upon intercalation of the lithium in specific titanium electron orbitals, which is governed between the structural and electronic degrees of freedom. A predictive model has been proposed which can relate the phase behaviour upon lithium intercalation to the structure of the titania polymorphs. Kerisit et al.50 have used DFT and atomistic modelling to investigate the structure and phase stability of the titania polymorphs rutile, anatase, brookite, TiO2-B, ramsdellite, hollandite, spinel, and hexagonal structures. Each polymorph was modelled with x degrees of lithiation where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 in incremental steps of x = 0.25. A new set of force field parameters was derived for the potential shell model which can be used to describe all the titania polymorphs. Both computational approaches indicate that rutile, anatase, brookite, and TiO2-B are the most stable forms of TiO2, however upon lithiation anatase, brookite and ramsdellite become energetically favoured over rutile. With increasing lithium content the hexagonal and spinel polymorphs have stabilities approaching that of rutile; this correlates well with several experimental studies where nanomaterials have undergone phase transformations to the hexagonal or spinel structure upon lithium insertion. The calculations indicate that the main factors which affect the stability of the lithiated titania polymorphs are the lithium bonding environments and the degree of lattice deformation upon lithiation. Armstrong et al.51 have used a combination of neutron powder diffraction and DFT computational methods, to study the change in structure of bulk and nanowires of LixTiO2-B where x = 0−0.9. Three structures were identified, Li0.25TiO2-B, Li0.5TiO2-B, and the fully lithiated material LixTiO2-B, (x = 0.8 (bulk) and 0.9 (nanowires)). At low lithium levels the square planar lithium site at the centre of the b axis channel (C site) is preferentially occupied. At x = 0.5 the b axis channel site becomes unfavourable and a 5-coordinate site is occupied in preference. In the fully lithiated material both sites are equally occupied. Kim et al.52 have synthesised V2O5 coated TiO2 nanorods with a shell thickness of 6.5 nm. The nanorods were prepared by coating V2O5 on anatase TiO2 nanowires; the volumetric capacity of the synthesised material was 426 and 329 mA h cm−3 at 0.5 and 20 C rates, respectively, compared to 246 and 128 mA h cm−3 for the TiO2 nanowires at the same rate. The enhanced electrochemical properties were attributed to a fully reversible lithiation of the nanoscale-V2O5 shell. The crystalline ω-LixV2O5 phase, in contrast to bulk amorphous-V2O5, exhibited faster pathways for Li ions and electrons into the TiO2 core. TiO2 rutile nanorods with a flower-like structure have been synthesised by the hydrolysation of TiCl4 in ethanol in an autoclave.53 Initial capacities of 270 mA h g−1 were observed with a 50 mA h g−1 1st cycle loss, and a capacity of 183 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles.
Hong et al.54 have investigated Zn2Ti3O8 nanowires as an anode for lithium ion batteries. The materials were synthesised using a low temperature hydrothermal method, where NaxH2−xTi3O7 is ion exchanged with Zn2+ at 60 °C, and then calcined at temperatures of 450–750 °C. A metastable spinel type crystalline phase with no impurities is observed between 500 and 700 °C; above this temperature TiO2 begins to crystallise while below this temperature there is an amorphous phase. An initial capacity of 1400 mA h g−1 was observed, which subsequently cycled well at 400 mA h g−1 with no loss in capacity over 50 cycles. Qui et al.55 have synthesised a TiO2-graphite hybrid nanomaterial by a 3-step hydrothermal self assembly and functionalisation technique. Initial size-tuneable anatase TiO2 nanospindles were synthesised via a hydrothermal process. These TiO2 nanospindles are densely dispersed onto functional graphene oxides (GO) via a spontaneous self assembly process and subsequently annealed under ammonia gas flow. The TiO2 surface of the TiO2/GO hybrid nanocomposite was nitridated and the GO was reduced to graphene sheets (GS). When tested in a lithium anode cell the hybrid TiO2-TiOxNy/TiN-GS nanocomposites showed a much enhanced cyclability and rate capability than the TiO2 nanoparticles alone.

            TiO2-B
            nanoribbons have been synthesised by Beuvier et al.56 The nanoribbons have been synthesised hydrothermally at temperatures above 170 °C in an alkaline medium. After ion exchange, the particles are annealed and 6 nm TiO2-B ribbons with 5% anatase TiO2 are obtained. This material exhibited a reversible capacity of 200 mA h g−1 at C/3 m and a 5% capacity loss over 500 cycles for a 3 C rate. Amorphous titanium oxide nanoparticles were prepared from titanium isopropoxide by Borghols et al.57 High specific capacities of 810 mA h g−1 were observed upon the first discharge at 33.5 mA g−1 which decreased to 200 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. From X-ray diffraction and NMR techniques the capacity fade was determined to be due to the reaction of Li2O with water and hydroxide species at the surface. The high reversible capacity is not wholly due to the formation of Li0.5TiO2 and the results indicate that part of the Li2O at the TiO2 surface may be reversible.

            LiCrTiO4 has been synthesised by a sonochemical method and subsequent heat treatment at 923 K for 2 h.58 The cubic spinel has a particle size range of 60–70 nm. From electrochemical tests lithium intercalation was shown to occur at 1.5 and 1.65 V vs.Li/Li+ with a reversible specific capacity of 160 mA h g−1. When used in an asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor configuration a specific capacity of 59 mA h g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 in a non-aqueous electrolyte was observed with good cycling performance over 1000 cycles with 96% retention in capacity.
 

Nitrides
             are receiving more interest as anode materials for lithium ion batteries and in this respect Li7.9MnN3.2O1.6 and Li7MnN4 have been synthesised by Cabana et al.59 At rates of 1 C specific capacities of 180 and 230 mA h g−1 were observed after 50 cycles for the oxynitride and nitride respectively, with specific capacities of 120–135 mA h g−1 being observed after 100 cycles at 5 C.
At low rates more lithium can be removed, which leads to lithium vacancies; this improves the lithium ion diffusion and rate capability and it is suggested that the partial filling of the sites upon subsequent cycling results in the high lithium ion diffusion. Sun et al.60 have synthesised an antimony nitride film by magnetron sputtering, with the reversible capacity for Sb3Nvs.Li between 0.3 V and 3 V being above 600 mA h g−1. A conversion reaction was observed where Sb3N transforms into Li3Sb and Li3N. Culligan et al.61 investigated the ternary lithium transition metal nitrides LiNiN, Li3FeN2, Li5TiN3 and Li7VN5. The materials were prepared mechanochemically from Li3N and the transition metal or nitride. An intermediate material was observed after milling which subsequently transformed into the ternary nitride after annealing. Lupart et al.62 have synthesised quaternary lithium rare-earth nitridosilicates Li5Ln5Si4N12 (Ln = La, Ce) at temperatures below 900 °C in closed tantalum ampoules with a lithium flux. These materials crystallised in a space group P4-b2 with lattice parameters for the lanthanum analogue: a = 1104.28(16), c = 557.30(11) and the ceriuma = 1097.78(16), c = 551.43(11) pm. Pagano et al.63 characterised the isotypic nitridosilicates Li4Ca3Si2N6 and Li4Sr3Si2N6. The materials were synthesised by reaction of strontium or calcium with Si(NH)2 and additional excess of Li3N in sealed tantalum ampoules. The materials crystallised in the C2/m space group. Li4Sr3Si2N6 has lattice parameters of a = 6.1268(12), b = 9.6866(19), c = 6.2200(12) Å, β = 90.24°, and the structure consists of isolated [Si2N6]10− ions and is isotypic to Li4Sr3Ge2N6.

1.3 Solid electrolytes
Fergus64 has reviewed the solid ceramic and polymer electrolytes for lithium ion batteries. The conductivities of developed and developing electrolytes, such as the NASICON- and garnet-type structures were discussed and compared. NASICON is a well known structure for a solid electrolyte materials and in this respect Salkus et al.65 have investigated the electrolyte Li2.9Sc1.9−yYyZr0.1(PO4)3 (where y = 0, 0.1). At room temperature these compounds possess a monoclinic symmetry (P21/n) and at temperatures between 600–900 K an orthorhombic symmetry (Pbcn). Changes in the enthalpy, activation energy and dielectric permittivity are observed at temperatures between 420–520 K, which can be related to the diffuse structure phase transition occurring in this temperature range. Where y = 0 the lithium ions occupied two different positions, while for y > 0 only one position is occupied. From XPS measurements it was observed that the surface of the ceramics contained cations of different valence state compared to the bulk. Awaka et al.66 have synthesised a tetragonal garnet Li7La3Hf2O12 by solid state reaction. The tetragonal Li7La3Hf2O12 has a space group of I4(1)/acd with lattice constants: a = 13.106(2) Å and c = 12.630(2) Å. In this structure the Li atoms occupy three types of crystallographic sites: Li(1) atom is located at the tetrahedral 8a site, and Li(2) and Li(3) atoms are located at the distorted octahedral 16 f and 32 g sites, respectively. Li7La3Hf2O12 exhibits a bulk Li-ion conductivity of σb = 9.85 × 10−7 S cm−1 and grain-boundary Li-ion conductivity σgb = 4.45 × 10−7 S cm−1 at 300 K and an activation energy of Ea = 0.53 eV in the temperature range of 300–580 K. Nyman et al.67 have investigated methods to increase the conductivity in Li5La3Ta2O12 and Li5La3Nb2O12 garnets. These garnets possess lithium in tetrahedral and octahedral configurations, the lithium in the octahedral sites being more mobile. The ionic conductivity was increased by removing lithium from the tetrahedral sites, which was achieved by Li2O volatility upon repeated heat treatment or by proton for lithium ion exchange and water vaporisation. The ion exchange treatment produced the largest change in the occupation of the tetrahedral (nonmobile) lithium sites and increased the dynamics of the remaining lithium. Ramzy et al.68 have reported the synthesis of different garnet materials using a novel synthesis approach. A solid-solution reaction between Li6BaLa2M2O12, (M = Nb, Ta) and Li7La3Zr2O12 has been employed to form Li6.5La2.5BaZrMO12 which exhibited a conductivity of 6 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 100 °C, while the Nb analogue showed an order of magnitude lower conductivity.
High density materials Li5ReSi4O12 (Re = Nd, Gd) were synthesised by a solid-state reaction method.69 The conductivity of the neodymium sample was observed to be 1.2 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 550 °C and 2.5 × 10−7 S cm−1 at 350 °C, respectively, with an activation energy of 0.84 eV. Li5GdSi4O12 exhibited similar conductivities and an activation energy of 0.90 eV. Olivine-type silicates have been investigated as fast ionic conductors using ab initio density functional calculations.70 From nudged elastic band calculations the materials LiInSiO4 and LiInGeO4 showed very small energy barriers for lithium hopping to neighbouring sites, 0.23 eV in the germanium structure and 0.36 eV in the silicate. The energy for the formation of intrinsic defects was large (1.5 eV) which would suppress the ionic conductivity, however doping with higher valent cations may induce fast ionic conduction in these materials. Mei et al.71 have investigated the ionic conductivity in (Li/La)TiO3 coated with amorphous silica. The ionic conductivity is enhanced to 1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. This improvement has been attributed to the removal of the anisotropy in the outer shell of the grains to provide lithium ions in various sites in the grain boundary close to those in the bulk lithium titanate thus facilitating fast ionic conduction.

          Lithium phosphorus oxynitride materials have been investigated for many years, especially in relation to the thin-film electrolyte LiPON developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Du et al.72 have used first-principle simulations of related crystalline materials to understand the Li-ion conductivity in these materials in more detail. A survey of known crystalline materials related to LiPON has been performed and the prediction of some new structures made. Initially crystalline LiPO3 was studied. This has twisted phosphate chains which were modified by the substitution of N and Li for O. The optimized structures appear to possess regular planar phosphate chains –P–N–P–N–. Several exothermic reaction pathways have been suggested for the synthesis of these crystals.
1.4 
          Sodium, magnesium and silver ionic conductors

          Sodium vanadate
          nanorods (NaV6O15) were synthesised using a low temperature hydrothermal process and when tested vs. a sodium metal anode reversible capacities of 142 mA h g−1 were observed at a current density of 0.02 Ag−1.73 When cycled at 0.05 Ag−1 a capacity of 75 mA h g−1 was observed after 30 cycles. Sodium manganate Na4Mn9O18 has been examined in an asymmetric supercapacitor cell.74 This material was tested in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte against an activated carbon counter electrode. A specific capacity of 45 mA h g−1 was observed over a 0.5 V voltage range, with a specific capacitance of 300 F g−1, and with the correct negative and positive mass ratio, the cells were capable of being charged to 1.7 V with little water electrolysis being reported.
Levi et al.75 have discussed the challenges in the development of magnesium ion batteries, in particular focusing on the magnesium intercalation materials. They discussed the use of nanomaterials and hybrid intercalation compounds, which consist of water or additional anion groups which screen the charge of the inserted cations, and cluster-containing compounds. V2O5 gels and hybrids offer high voltages for magnesium insertion, although the diffusion coefficients are very small. The magnesium containing Chevrel phases, however, offer high kinetics for intercalation but low voltages and hence low energy densities. The review states that there should be a greater focus on cluster containing intercalation compounds for magnesium ion batteries which possess higher capacities and working potentials.
Marschilok et al.76 have investigated lithium reduction of silver vanadium phosphorus oxide, (Ag2VO2PO4). Upon lithium reduction Ag+ is reduced to silver metal which results in significant lowering of the resistivity. Subsequent reduction occurs with V5+ reducing to V4+ when the cathode resistivity begins to increase until the vanadium V4+ reduces to V3+ where it decreases again. Sauvage et al.77 have investigated materials made from the ternary system Ag2O/V2O5/HF(aq). Various silver vanadates can be precipitated with Ag/V ratios from 1/2-3/1, including Ag2V4O11 (SVO) and the novel materials Ag4V2O6F2 and Ag3VO2F4. SVO needle like precipitates were 10-5 nm × 200 nm in size and exhibited lithium exchange for silver and subsequent lithium intercalation reversibility. Specific capacities of 320 mA h g−1 at C rate and 250 mA h g−1 at 5 C were observed.
1.5 Full cells
Kang et al.78 have investigated the electrochemical performance of high capacity xLi2MnO3·(1-x)LiMO2 (M = Ni, Co, Mn) cathodes with a Li4Ti5O12 or carbon-encapsulated anatase, TiO2-C, anode. A reversible capacity of 250 mA h g−1 was selected for the investigation and good reversible capacities and cycle life was observed for the cells made with the LTO anode. The cells with the TiO2-C anode showed no improvement in stability or cycle life and a steady capacity loss was observed upon cycling.
Kobayashi et al.79 have constructed an all solid state phosphate symmetric cell using a Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 solid electrolyte, and Li3V2(PO4)3 for both the positive and negative electrodes. To increase the interface area between the electrodes and the electrolyte amorphous Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 was added. Analysis of the symmetrical cell after processing showed no additional phases at the interface after processing at 600 °C. A discharge capacity of 92 mA h g−1 at 22 μA cm−2 at 80 °C, and 38 mA h g−1 at 25 °C, respectively was observed. A honeycombed structure of Li0.35La0.55TiO3 (LLT) was used as a solid electrolyte for a three-dimensional all-solid-state rechargeable lithium-ion battery, with a LiCoO2 cathode and Li4Mn5O12 anode.80 Small particle sizes of the electrode materials were synthesised by the sol–gel method and intimately dispersed into the electrolyte micro-pores during the fabrication of the anodes and cathodes. This resulted in good contact between the electrolyte and the active materials, and led to a lower internal resistance of the overall cell. The LiCoO2/LLT/Li4Mn5O12 all-solid-state battery operated at 1.1 V with an observed discharge capacity of 7.3 μA h cm−2. Kotobuki et al.81 have investigated the solid electrolyte garnet, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZ), in an all solid state lithium-ion battery with a lithium metal anode. A conductivity of 1.8 × 10−4 S cm−1 was observed in a well sintered pellet. A full cell using LiCoO2 cathode and lithium metal anode was tested, and there was a significant first cycle loss due to an interfacial problem between the LiCoO2 and the solid electrolyte. The discharge capacity observed was 15 mA cm−2. This interfacial layer has been investigated by Kim et al.82Cyclic voltammetry confirms that upon the first charge, the lithium forms an interfacial layer between the solid electrolyte and the LiCoO2 with poor electrochemical performance. TEM and EDX showed a 50 nm layer of La2CoO4 and other crystal structures with varying degrees of Co, La and Zr cation concentration across the layer. The reaction phase is due to mutual diffusion between the cathode and electrolyte and is likely formed in the high temperature processing of the all solid oxide cells.


            Lithium–air batteries. 
With the hypothesised increase in the specific capacity of a rechargeable battery the number of lithium–air papers has significantly increased this year, and in this respect Ellis et al.83 have reviewed the alternative cathode materials for Li-ion and lithium air batteries. An initial review of the positive electrodes for lithium-ion batteries has been performed and the more novel Li–air and lithium–sulfur batteries has been reviewed in detail. In particular the need for more complex cathode assemblies and tailored design to achieve high capacities and energy densities and good properties was highlighted. In terms of lithium–air batteries for vehicles Girishkumar et al.84 give a summary of the current understanding and challenges that lithium–air batteries face in their development.
Eswaran et al.85 have achieved high energy densities of 3100 mA h g−1 with a current density of 0.18 mA cm−2 in their lithium–air cell. The Li–O2cells were fabricated with dual layer high surface area carbon electrodes, which consisted of an active layer and a diffusion layer. AC impedance of the cells at different stages of discharge suggested that the cell resistance gradually increases as the reaction products, such as Li2O2 and Li2O, accumulate in the pores of the carbon electrode. Jin et al.86 have synthesised titanium-containing γ-MnO2 octahedral molecular sieves by a one-step synthesis methods. Ti substitution into specific sites of the MnO2 framework was observed, with no titanium containing impurity phases. High specific capacities of 2.3 A h g−1 were observed and catalytic tests undertaken for the oxidation of toluene with molecular oxygen showed significant activities. Minowa et al.87 have investigated the use of Fe–Mn based perovskites as an addition to carbon black as a catalyst for lithium–air batteries. Compared to carbon with no additives an improved cycle performance was observed. Kumar et al.88 have investigated lithium aluminium germanium phosphate glass ceramic cathodes in solid state lithium–oxygen cells. It was proposed that these materials can absorb oxygen molecules in the large pores due to their open structure and the subsequent reduction of superoxide and peroxide molecules. They can also serve as a solid-state electrolyte membranes due to their superionic lithium-ion conductivity.

2. Solid oxide fuel cells
Detailed discussion on conventional and new materials for use in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) can be found in the 2010 review articles written by Jacobson, Orera and Slater.89,90 This year there has been growing interest in proton conducting electrolytes for lowering the operating temperature.
2.1 
          Oxide ion conductors


Fluorite systems. 
The favoured electrolytes for use in commercial SOFCs continue to be fluorite-type systems, particularly doped ZrO2 and CeO2. In terms of new research on such fluorite systems, the oxide ion and proton conductivity of nanocrystalline Gd doped ceria has been examined by Avila-Paredes et al. below 200 °C. While the oxide ion conductivity showed the expected dopant dependence, the proton conductivity was independent of dopant concentration. The authors attributed the latter to the proton conductivity taking place exclusively at the grain boundaries and suggest that suitably designed materials with large surface areas may show high proton conductivities in wet atmospheres.91 Dikmen et al. have reported the synthesis of Gd doped CeO2 co-doped with up to 10% Bi or other lanthanides (Sm, La, Nd) via a hydrothermal route.92 The authors report that SOFCs using these co-doped electrolytes showed higher power densities than simple Gd doped CeO2 electrolyte systems. The highest conductivity, 4.46 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 700 °C, was observed for Ce0.8Gd0.1Bi0.1O1.9. Bi-based fluorites offer the highest oxide ion conductivities reported, and continue to attract significant attention. In order to find more information regarding the defect structure of the Y-doped phase, Bi3YO6, a combination of total neutron scattering and computer modeling has been performed.93 The results indicated a predominance of 〈110〉 vacancy ordering within this material. Kuang et al. have examined the structures and conductivities of the bismuth molybdates, Bi38Mo7O78 and Bi37.5Mo7.5O78.75, with the latter showing similar conductivities to YSZ.94 The materials show superstructures of the fluorite structure, with the structure of the former system being shown to be non-centrosymmetric-polar and second harmonic generation active.



Apatite systems. 

            Apatite silicates and germanates represent an important new class of oxide ion conductors, whose conductivity is mediated by oxide ion interstitials, rather than vacancies as for fluorite systems. Raman spectroscopy studies of the apatite series La8+xBa2−xGe6O26+x/2 have shown the appearance of an extra band at 645 cm−1, whose intensity increases with increasing interstitial oxide ion content.95 The band has been attributed to the presence of five coordinate Ge, and high temperature studies suggest a defect trapping energy of ≈0.32 eV due to the close association of the oxide ion interstitials to Ge. It is known that apatite germanates with high oxygen contents display triclinic symmetry, with a change to hexagonal symmetry at higher temperatures.96 Work by Pramana et al. suggests the presence of an intermediate monoclinic cell, highlighting the complex structural features of these apatite systems. Significant water incorporation into apatite electrolytes has been observed by a number of groups, with the germanate apatites showing the highest levels of water incorporation, with modeling studies confirming that in such systems the water incorporation is energetically more favourable.97 On water incorporation changes in cell symmetry to hexagonal were observed for triclinic samples and, through consideration of the defect equations, the authors show that in addition to protons, the incorporation of additional interstitial oxide ions occurs. Modelling results suggest that the protons are located along the main oxygen channel, similar to hydroxyapatite systems.98
In addition to strategies for improving the synthesis and sintering of these apatite electrolytes, there is a need to demonstrate their operation in a SOFC. In this area, power densities up to 0.25 W cm−2 (at 1073 K) were observed by Mineshige et al. for a SOFC with the apatite electrolyte La9.62Si5.79Al0.21O26.33 in conjunction with a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−x cathode and Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 anode.99 The authors also reported good compatibility between the electrolyte and electrode materials. Marrero-Lopez et al. have also shown respectable power densities up to 0.2 W cm−2 for a system utilizing a similar La10Si5.5Al0.5O26.75 electrolyte, in conjunction with a Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 anode and a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3−x cathode.100 The authors reported stable performance for this SOFC over 100 hours testing.


Other oxide ion conductors. 
Packer and Skinner have observed high oxide ion conductivity at low temperatures in CeNbO4+y. Oxygen diffusion measurements showed the unusual result that the diffusion coefficient increased at lower temperatures, coinciding with the scheelite-fergusonite phase transition for this material.101 This was contrary to expectations since the lower temperature structure is more complex than the high temperature structure, and the authors suggest that work on the low temperature oxygen diffusion of other systems is warranted. In further work on melilite systems the structural features of La1+xSr1−xGa3O7+x/2 (x ≤ 0.64) have been examined with varying temperature. At high temperatures the structure is tetragonal, while for x > 0.6 a reversible transition to an orthorhombic cell is observed below 600 °C, with a concomittant decrease in conductivity.102 By quenching, the former structure can be retained, leading to a higher conductivity. A similar structural transition is observed for the related Ca-containing system, La1+xCa1−xGa3O7+x/2 for high values of x.103

2.2 
          Proton conductors

Perovskite systems. 
Perovskite systems continue to dominate the area of proton conductors. One common problem with these systems is the difficulty in making high quality dense membranes. To overcome this problem, a range of sintering aids have been examined. In this respect, Zn doping has been employed to lower the sintering temperature of Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O8.73.104 4% Zn doping was shown to improve the sintering with the Zn doped phase showing mixed conductivity as for the undoped system. Under wet 5%H2/Ar, the material displays pure ionic conduction (mainly protonic) below 550 °C.
In terms of improving the sintering of BaZrO3 based electrolytes, Tsai et al. have examined the use of LiF as a sintering aid.105 The results showed that this could lead to a lowering of the sintering temperature by 200–300 °C, with good conductivities for the resultant materials. Ni doping has also been employed to improve the sintering of Y-doped BaZrO3, leading to total conductivities as high as 3.3 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 600 °C under wet Ar.106 The mechanism for this sintering has been examined and ascribed to the initial formation of Ba2YNiO5 which acts as a sintering aid, and then subsequently incorporates into the perovskite phase. A number of studies have been performed aimed at understanding the structural influence of dopant incorporation. Fabbri et al. have examined the effect of Y content on the proton conductivity in BaZr1−xYxO3−x/2 (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.5).107 Despite the increase in proton concentration, the conductivity was shown to decrease with increasing Y content, attributed to both reduced mobility and mobile charge carrier concentration. The possibility of A site deficiency in Y-doped BaZrO3 has been examined by Haile and coworkers.108 The results show that while Ba deficiency is possible, this deficiency is accommodated by incorporation of Y on the A site. Moreover the Ba deficiency was shown to have a detrimental impact on the grain boundary conductivity. Solid state NMR has been employed to investigate the local structure and proton conducting pathways in Sc doped BaZrO3.10945Sc NMR showed the presence of both 5- and 6-coordinate Sc, demonstrating the presence of oxide ion vacancies around the dopant cation, with 17O NMR suggesting a random distribution of dopant. Variable temperature proton NMR indicated at least two different mobile proton sites. In terms of novel doping strategies, the incorporation of phosphate or silicate into Ba2In2O5 has been shown to stabilize the highly conducting cubic phase leading to an enhancement in the conductivity, with silicate doping leading to samples with the highest conductivities (oxide ion in dry atmospheres, proton conductivity in wet atmospheres below 800 C).110 The improvement in conductivity on silicon doping is particularly interesting, as silicon is generally considered to be a poison for SOFC materials.111


Other proton conductors. 
The proton conductor, La1−xBa1+xGaO4−x/2, has been examined in detail by neutron diffraction to locate the proton site(s).112 The results showed more than one proton site, consistent with modeling studies which suggested similar proton defect energies for the different oxide ion sites. The nature of the defects in alkaline earth doped LaNbO4 has been examined by Mather et al. The oxide ion vacancies were shown to be accommodated by the condensation of the NbO4 units into Nb2O74− units.113 In other work on this system, Fjeld et al. have performed a detailed combined experimental and modeling study.114 Modelling work showed that proton diffusion was via an inter-tetrahedral mechanism with activation energies of 39 and 60 kJ mol−1 in the tetragonal and monoclinic phases respectively. The former was in good agreement with the experimentally derived activation energy of 35 kJ mol−1 for the tetragonal system. Detailed analysis of the conductivity data in the monoclinic cell region showed that the activation energy continuously increased with increasing monoclinic angle at decreasing temperature, reaching a value of 57 kJ mol−1 at 205 °C. Xu et al. have examined the proton conductivity of SnP2O7–H3PO4 composites.115 The highest conductivities (3.5 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 300 °C) were observed for high starting P∶Sn ratios and high calcination temperatures, and the composites showed promising stability, suggesting potential for fuel cell applications.

2.3 Cathode materials

Perovskite and related systems. 
Materials with the perovskite structure continue to dominate the research into cathode materials, with particular interest in Co-containing systems due to their generally high electronic and ionic conductivities. One concern with some of these systems has been the long term stability and so this has been a area of continued study. The stability of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Nb0.2O3−x cathode materials towards CO2 has been examined by Yiet al. On exposure to CO2, the oxygen permeation flux was shown to rapidly decrease with the formation of a surface layer of BaCO3, and Co depletion was found close to this surface layer.116 The authors argued that Nb/Fe substitution enhances the stability towards CO2 by increasing the acidity and reducing the oxygen non-stoichiometry. Efimov et al. have examined the decomposition of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−x in the intermediate temperature range (500–800 °C) by post-annealing analysis with transmission electron microscopy.117 Apart from the formation of the hexagonal perovskite Ba0.5Sr0.5CoO3−x, lamellar non-cubic phases were also observed, the latter of which were shown to be related to the 15R hexagonal perovskite polytype. The Sb doped SrCoO3−x phase has been examined in detail as a potential SOFC cathode material by Aguadero et al.118 The composition SrCo0.95Sb0.05O3−x showed a low electrode polarization resistance, <0.1 Ωcm2 in the range 750–800 °C and, in conjunction with a doped LaGaO3 electrolyte and Sr2MgMoO6 anode, power densities up to 0.62 W cm−2 were observed at 850 °C. The excellent performance was attributed to the high electronic conductivity and high oxygen vacancy level giving high oxide ion mobility. Ni-doped La1−xSrxCoO3−y has been examined by Hjalmarsson et al.119Ni doping was reported to increase the p-type mobility as well as decrease the thermal expansion coefficient.
The operation of such Co based perovskite cathodes with proton conducting electrolytes has attracted growing interest. Lin et al. have examined the perovskite Ba0.6Sr0.4Co0.9Nb0.1O3−y in conjunction with a BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O2.9 electrolyte. Very good performance was observed for a SOFC with this cathode material, with a maximum power density of 0.63 W cm−2 at 700 °C.120 Yang et al. have shown an excellent performance for a composite cathode of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O2.9 and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−y: a single cell utilizing this cathode showing a maximum power density of 0.855 W cm−2 at 750 °C and no degradation in performance over a 100 hour test.121
Apart from the systems above, layered cobaltates such as GdBaCo2O5+y have continued to attract detailed research. For a review on these and other layered systems, see the article by Tarancon et al.122 Zhang et al. have examined the potential of GdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+y as a cathode for a SOFC utilizing a proton conducting electrolyte. The results showed area specific resistances of 0.45, 0.25 and 0.15 Ω cm2 at 600, 650 and 700 °C respectively, showing promising potential for this system.123 The same group has examined PrBaCo2O5+y in conjunction with a Ba(Ce/Zr)O3 based electrolyte with an area specific resistance of 0.12 Ω cm2 at 700 °C was observed.124 The synthesis and characterization of thin films of such materials has also attracted significant interest. Burriel et al. have prepared epitaxial thin films of GdBaCo2O5+x by pulsed laser deposition under different conditions.125 The films closest to the stoichiometric composition showed very high electronic conductivity, 800 S cm−1 at 330 °C, with low p(O2) dependence, thus demonstrating the potential of such thin films for SOFC cathodes. Elegant work on thin films of NdBaCo2O5+y, grown by pulsed laser deposition, has been reported by Grygiel et al.126 The authors showed that, through suitable control of growth kinetics, a high level of control on the A site order could be achieved and hence through this a control in the properties.
While Co-containing perovskites do have many beneficial properties for SOFC cathode applications they are not without their problems, typically high reactivity with the electrolyte material and high thermal expansion coefficients. As a result of these issues, Co-free perovskites have attracted interest. Niu et al. have reported promising results for the Co-free cathode material, Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3−x and suggest that this has potential for SOFCs due to its lower thermal expansion coefficient and cost.127 Zhou et al. have investigated the performance of the Co-free perovskite, SrFe0.9Nb0.1O3−y, which shows a conductivity up to 70 S cm−1 in the range 600–800 °C.128 A cathode layer of this material on a doped ceria electrolyte showed an area specific resistance of 0.14 Ω cm2 at 750 °C. Efimov et al. have observed good performance for the Co free cubic perovskite, Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3−x, with high conductivity and high oxygen permeation observed. Extended (200 h at 1023 K) measurements showed that the high oxygen permeation was maintained over time.129Mo doped LaNiO3 has been examined as a potential cathode material in conjunction with a LaGaO3-based electrolyte and a Sr2MgMoO6 anode.130 The optimum performance was for the LaNi0.75Mo0.25O3−y composition, with a SOFC using this cathode giving power densities of 0.66 W cm−2 at 850 °C indicating that these systems are promising Co free cathodes.
The Ruddlesden Popper-type nickelates, Lan+1NinO3n+1−y phases (n = 1–3), continue to attract significant interest for cathode applications. Takahashi et al. have examined the cathode performance of these systems.131 With increasing n, the overall electronic conductivity increased, with the n = 3 phase showing the best cathode performance in conjunction with a Sm doped CeO2 electrolyte.
The long term stability of Nd2NiO4+x in water and CO2 containing atmospheres has been examined by Egger et al.132 The phase was shown to be stable in CO2 but a decrease in the oxygen surface exchange coefficient by one order of magnitude was observed for a 1000 h anneal in a wet atmosphere. The degradation was shown to be related to significant changes in the Nd∶Ni ratio near the surface. Sayers et al. have performed a detailed analysis of the oxygen diffusion characteristics of La2NiO4+y.133 The oxygen interstitial diffusion coefficient was shown to be of similar magnitude to values for vacancy diffusion in perovskites. The activation energy was determined to be 0.63 eV between 350–550 °C. Yashima et al. have analysed neutron and synchrotron diffraction data for Pr1.8La0.2Ni0.74Cu0.21Ga0.05O4+y using the maximum entropy method in order to determine information regarding the oxide ion conduction pathway.134 The results elegantly showed that the oxide ion diffusion occurs via a curved pathway involving migration of oxide ions via the apical (O2) and interstitial (O3) sites. Related mixed Ni/Cr and Ni/Co systems have also been shown to display significant promise. Tonus et al. have investigated the structures of Ln3−xSr1+xCrNiO8−y phases (Ln = La, Nd) through in situ studies involving heating under a hydrogen atmosphere.135 The results showed that oxygen vacancies only formed at the equatorial sites, and showed that these systems display excellent stability under a wide range of p(O2). In related work, El Shinawi et al. have reported the synthesis of La1.5+xSr0.5−xCo0.5Ni0.5O4+y, showing that these materials are stable in 10%H2/N2 up to 800 °C, with high conductivities displayed at elevated temperatures.136


Other cathode materials. 
YBaCo4−xZnxO7 shows promise as a SOFC cathode. The material has been shown to have compatible thermal expansion with SOFC electrolytes, in contrast to many other Co based cathode materials. The lower thermal expansion of this material is attributed to the low levels of oxygen loss and the absence of spin state transitions of tetrahedral Co2+/3+.137 Composite SOFC cathodes consisting of YBaCo3ZnO7 and Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 have been examined for use in intermediate temperature SOFCs. The 50∶50 wt% composite was shown to display optimum performance with a polarization resistance of 0.28 Ω cm2 at 600 °C, and the composites showed good thermal expansion coefficient match with the electrolyte.138 In related work, Vert et al. have examined the effect of the rare earth cation on LnBaCo3ZnO7+y systems (Ln = Y, Er, Tb), with the best performance observed for Ln = Tb, which showed an ASR of 0.46 Ω cm2 at 650 °C.139

2.4 Anode materials

          Ni/electrolyte cermets continue to dominate the field in commercial SOFC systems, but strategies to improve sulfur tolerance and resistance to coking has highlighted other potential anode systems, with significant interest in perovskite materials.
In terms of non-Ni containing metal anodes, Raza et al. have examined a mixed Cu/Zn anode material (Cu0.2Zn0.8), with the authors reporting excellent performance at 550 °C and good compatibility with ceria electrolytes.140

          Mo-containing systems have attracted significant interest for anodes showing sulfur tolerance. Liet al. have investigated Mo doping in rare earth doped ceria. 10% Mo doping was examined giving compositions Ce0.9−xMo0.1LnxO2.1−0.5x (Ln = Y, Sm, Gd), with the samples maintaining the cubic fluorite structure on reduction in H2.141 The total conductivity showed a small increase compared to samples without Mo-doping with a value of 7.8 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 450 °C in wet H2 comparable to the perovskite anode, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3−x. Vasala et al. have investigated the redox stability of Sr2MMoO6−y (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn) double perovskites.142 The results showed that the M = Co, Ni, Zn phases were oxygen-stoichiometric and stable under oxidizing conditions, while for M = Mn, Fe, the samples were oxygen deficient and stable under reducing conditions. The sample with M = Mg was shown to be stable under both oxidising and reducing conditions. The same group have examined the effect of W- and Nb-doping for Mo in Sr2MgMoO6−y.143 While the former showed little influence, Nb doping was shown to lower the degree of cation ordering and have the beneficial effect of introducing oxygen vacancies. The presence of Nb, however, did lower slightly the electronic conductivity.
In other Mo based anode work, Xiao et al. have examined the performance of Sr2Fe1.33Mo0.67O6 systems, with promising results reported.144 The samples showed high conductivities at intermediate temperatures in reducing conditions (16 S cm−1 at 800 °C in wet H2) and a SOFC with this anode exhibited maximum power densities up to 0.6 W cm−2 with good carbon and sulfur tolerance. Danilovic et al. have examined the catalytic activity for methane oxidation of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5M0.5O3−y (M = Co, Fe, Ti, Mn) perovskites.145 The Co containing systems were shown to be unstable under reducing conditions. For the other systems, the performance depended significantly on the fuel used, with the Fe based system showing the best performance for methane while, for methane/H2S mixtures, the Ti based system was best.
In other perovskite anode work, Neagu et al. have performed a detailed investigation of the Sr0.4La0.4TiO3−x anode material.146 The results indicated that while there was rapid reduction of the surface, the reduction of the bulk material was slow. However, increasing the pre-reduction temperature to 1400 °C (5%H2/Ar) resulted in greater reduction and conductivities approaching 100 S cm−1 at elevated temperatures. Dong et al. have reported that the perovskite Sr0.7Ba0.3Fe0.9Mo0.1O3−x shows excellent stability towards reduction, with the structure being maintained in a 5%H2/He atmosphere at 900 °C for >2 days.147 The high tolerance to reduction is attributed to the synergistic effect between the Mo(VI)/Mo(V) and Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couples. The material showed good performance as a oxygen permeation membrane.
2.5 Electrolysers and chemical production
While the vast majority of work has focused on developing electrodes and electrolytes for use in fuel cells, the potential operation of such systems in reverse to generate hydrogen, or in order to produce other commercially useful products, has been attracting increasing interest. In particular, solid state electrolysers are viewed as important devices for generating hydrogen for a low carbon economy. However one major issue with these devices is their degradation in performance over time. Ebbesen et al. have confirmed that this degradation is associated with deposition of impurities on the cathode, and the authors showed that by removing these impurities from the inlet gases the degradation can be avoided.148 The reversible operation of a microtubular SOFC has been examined by Laguna-Bercero et al.149 The system consisted of a YSZ electrolyte with Ni-YSZ and doped LaMnO3 electrodes, and it displayed good performance for steam electrolysis up to 950 °C. Raj et al., have reported the cogeneration of HCN and electrical power from a CeO2 electrolyte SOFC fed with methanol ammonia steam mixtures.150 A maximum yield of HCN of 40% (with respect to methanol input) was observed, showing that SOFCs could be utilized to produce useful chemicals in addition to their electrical performance. Liu et al. have demonstrated the synthesis of NH3 from N2 and H2 in a cell utilizing a BaCe0.9Ca0.1O2.9 electrolyte.151 The authors demonstrated that this electrolyte was a pure proton conductor under wet H2 between 300–600 °C.
3. Superconductivity
The superconductivity area has enjoyed a renaissance following the discovery of the iron pnictide superconductors. This year further work in this area has targeted the identification of new superconductors, as well as studies to help to understand the important features responsible for the superconductivity. In terms of Fe based systems, Zajdel et al. have prepared single crystals of Fe1.15Te1−ySy (0 < y < 0.15).152 At high S contents (y > 0.075) there is suppression of the magnetic and structural transition in the parent compound, with the observation of superconductivity at 9 K. Muraba et al. have induced superconductivity in SrFe2As2 through La doping and high pressure synthesis (2 to 3 GPa).153 A maximum Tc of 22 K was observed for 40% La doping in place of Sr. The effect of cation size mismatch in the superconducting system Ba1−xNaxFe2As2 has been analysed by Cortes-Gil et al.154 Superconductivity was observed for x > 0.2, with a maximum Tc of 34 K for x = 0.4. Despite the large size mismatch between Ba and Na, there was no evidence for their ordering within the structure. Zhang et al. have used low temperature Raman spectroscopy to provide evidence in support of spin dependent electron phonon coupling in the pnictide SmFeAsO, thus adding weight to suggestions that the interplay between spin dynamics and lattice vibration is significant in the superconducting characteristics of pnictide materials.155 Todorov et al. have examined the redox chemistry of NaFeAs in air and water.156 In water, mild oxidation occurs as Na is removed from the structure resulting in a sample with an enhanced Tc of up to 25 K. In air, more extensive oxidation occurs , and the structure type changes to the ThCr2Si2 type with a Tc of 12 K.
The observation of superconductivity has also been reported in a range of non iron-containing systems. Superconductivity (Tc = 3.5 K) in the Cu based pnictide material, LiCu2P2 has been reported by Han et al.157 Coronado et al. have produced a system demonstrating both superconductivity and magnetism at 4 K through the chemically designed [Ni0.66Al0.33(OH)2][TaS2].158 By changing Al for Fe, the magnetic ordering is increased to 16 K. Bailey et al. have reported the synthesis of a new superconducting oxynitride, MoN0.74O0.38 with a TC of 16 K.159 In other oxynitride work, Ohashi et al. have investigated Nb0.89Al0.11 oxynitrides, demonstrating Tcs as high as 17 K after post synthesis annealing at 1773 K under a nitrogen pressure of 0.5 MPa.160
In terms of organic superconductors, Mitsuhashi et al. have reported superconductivity in the hydrocarbon picene on potassium intercalation with Tc ranging from 7–18 K depending on potassium content.161Cs3C60 has been previously isolated as a structure involving body centred cubic (bcc) packing. The polymorph containing face centred cubic (fcc) packing has this year been isolated by Ganin et al.162 The latter phase is a magnetic insulator at ambient pressure, but becomes superconducting under pressure with Tc up to 35 K, slightly lower than the 38 K reported for the bcc polymorph.
