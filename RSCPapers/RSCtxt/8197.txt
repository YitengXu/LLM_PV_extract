    , Accepted 17th October 2022First published on 18th October 2022AbstractBenzoxadiazole derivatives have been rarely employed in designing non-fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs). Herein, two novel NFREAs consisting of uniform difluorobenzoxadiazole cores, cyclopentadithiophene bridges, and different fluorinated/chlorinated dicyanoindanone end-groups were developed and named as BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl, respectively. Apart from the differences in physical properties, different halogenations on NFREAs simultaneously lead to variations in compatibility with different polymer donors. In succession, the polymer donors, PBDB-T and PBDB-TF, were employed to form different donor:acceptor pairs with two NFREAs to estimate the compatibility in varied blends. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on fluorinated BOCIC-4F yielded the best photovoltaic performance with nonhalogenated PBDB-T. However, the efficiency diminished when PBDB-T was changed to halogenated PBDB-TF. In contrast, the chlorinated BOCIC-4Cl, which achieved the poorest performance with PBDB-T, could work better with PBDB-TF. Disparities in aggregation behaviors, miscibility factors, blend morphologies, and carrier dynamics derived from the different halogenations on NFREAs were responsible for the contrary compatibility in different blends. This work demonstrates the potential of benzoxadiazole derivatives in the design of efficient NFREAs. Moreover, these results will also be useful for constructing high-performance PSCs by estimating the compatibility of various donor:acceptor pairs.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are experiencing rapid development thanks to their intrinsic attributes of light weight, mechanical flexibility, semitransparency, and low-cost production, thus becoming a promising technique for renewable solar energy conservation.1–3 The springing up of efficient photoactive materials, and in particular the breakthrough of fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), has promoted continuous progress in high-performance PSCs.4–8 Nowadays, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction and tandem PSCs has reached beyond 19%9,10 and 20%,11 respectively.
Motivated by the aim to reduce synthetic complexities and reduce material costs, the design strategy of replacing fused rings by nonfused-ring architectures to develop nonfused-ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) has been proposed.12–14 In contrast to FREAs, NFREAs bearing flexible nonfused-ring frameworks offer unique advantages, including simplified structures, facile synthesis and purifications, and low production cost. Hence, NFREAs have gathered momentum and shown substantial progress.15–18 More importantly, the nonfused skeletons ensure diversified design probabilities by the modification of molecular structures and photovoltaic properties by judiciously tuning the building blocks, especially the central units. For instance, numerous electron-donating (D) units, such as bithiophene,19,20 benzodithiophene,21 fluorobenzene,22,23 and alkyloxybenzene,13,14,24 as well as electron-accepting (A) fragments, such as benzothiadiazole (BT),25,26 benzotriazole (BTz),27,28 quinoxaline,29 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione,30,31 and isoindigo,32 have been employed as cores for A–D–D′–D–A- and A–D–A′–D–A-type NFREAs with high diversities in their molecular structures.
In contrast with the analogues of BT and BTz, benzoxadiazole (BOz) and its derivatives have seldomly been used in designing NFREAs. As well-known fluorophores in fluorescent probes,33–35 electrochemical applications,36 chemosensors,37 and powerful building blocks in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs)38,39 as well as D–A copolymer photovoltaic materials,40–42 BOz and its derivatives still possess attractive characteristics as central units in the design of NFREAs. First, BOz possesses an intrinsic electron affinity and bulky architecture. In addition, by bearing heteroatoms such as S and O, BOz could induce multiple inter/intramolecular interactions to fix the molecular geometry. Moreover, the chemical structure of BOz can be further modified by judiciously selectively accessing functional groups on the skeleton.
Meanwhile, halogenations on the end groups of FREAs and NFREAs have been proven to be effective strategies to modify the photovoltaic properties. By introducing F, Cl, or Br atoms, the optical bandgaps, energy levels, crystallinities, molecular interactions, and aggregation behaviors can be adjusted.43–45 Moreover, the compatibility of different halogenated electron acceptors with polymer donors, which is one of the determinative factors in the performance of PSCs, can also be simultaneously regulated based on different halogenations. For instance, Yang and coworkers demonstrated that fluorinated FREA YI-4F was more preferable for use with the fluorinated polymer donor PBDB-T-F. In contrast, the nonfluorinated FREA Y1 demonstrated poor performance when blended with PBDB-T-F, but worked well with the nonfluorinated polymer donor PBDB-T.46 However, most research to date on estimating the donor:acceptor compatibility is based on FREAs, and seldomly focused on NFREAs. Thus, it is necessary to synchronously study the different compatibilities with varying the polymer donors when designing halogenated NFREAs. Furthermore, understanding the origins of the different compatibilities would also be significant for selecting well-matched donor:acceptor pairs to realize efficient PSCs.
Based on the above-mentioned aspects, in this work, two NFREAs, named BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl, in an A–D–A′–D–A type architecture were designed and synthesized by employing the uniform BOz-derived difluorobenzoxadiazole cores (A′), 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene bridges (CPDT, D), and different halogenated terminal groups (A) of fluorinated and chlorinated dicyanoindanone, respectively. The inherent F⋯H, S⋯N, and S⋯O noncovalent interactions guarantee highly planar geometries of the two nonfused molecules. Additionally, originating from the different halogenated substitutions, BOCIC-4F showed a stronger light-capture capacity and high-lying energy levels, while BOCIC-4Cl demonstrated a red-shifted absorption and more intense aggregation, respectively. Furthermore, two benchmark polymers, namely PBDB-T and PBDB-TF, were selected as electron-donor materials to successively blend with two NFREAs to estimate the compatibility of different halogenated donor:acceptor blends. As investigated, fluorinated BOCIC-4F worked better with the nonhalogenated donor PBDB-T, with a PCE of 6.14% compared to the 4.42% of PBDB-T:BOCIC-4Cl. Interestingly, when replacing PBDB-T by the halogenated polymer PBDB-TF, PSCs based on chlorinated BOCIC-4Cl achieved improved device performance with an enhancement in the PCE to 5.02%, while BOCIC-4F showed incompatibility with PBDB-TF and an inferior PCE of 4.46%. The disparities in the device performance and compatibility were ascribed to the different miscibility-driven morphologies, which resulted in disparities in the carrier dynamics.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and molecular configurations
The synthetic routes for BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl are depicted as Scheme S1 in the ESI.† Starting from the palladium-catalyzed Stille reaction for coupling the electron-accepting (A) 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole core with electron-donating (D) bridges CPDT to obtain intermediate 1, the target molecules were obtained through a total of three steps. Subsequently, dialdehyde 2 was prepared through a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. Finally, by introducing different halogenated electron-accepting terminal groups of 2-(5,6-difluro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2F) and 2-(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2Cl) to construct an A–D–A′–D–A configuration via a Knoevenagel condensation, BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl were successively synthesized. The chemical structures of the as-synthesized NFREAs were characterized through 1H NMR (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†), 13C NMR (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS, Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†), and elemental analysis.
Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the Gaussian 09 program suite at B3LYP/def2svp level were performed to investigate the chemical geometries and frontier molecular orbitals of the NFREAs. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, both the NFREAs showed excellent coplanarity, which could be reasonably said to originate from the F⋯H, S⋯N, and S⋯O noncovalent interactions existing between the adjacent units, respectively. The rigid planar geometries were conducive to facilitate intramolecular charge transfer and intermolecular electron transportation. Furthermore, as proved in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the simulated molecular orbitals of the NFREAs were uniformly distributed along the conjugated backbones. The theoretical energy levels for the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and the unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) were estimated at −5.62/−3.79 eV for BOCIC-4F and −5.68/−3.85 eV for BOCIC-4Cl, respectively (Table 1). By comparison, BOCIC-4Cl possessed deeper energy levels, which was ascribed to the stronger electron affinity of chlorine atoms than fluorine atoms.

2.2. Characterizations of the thermal, electrochemical, and optical properties
The results from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl possessed good thermal stability with high and similar decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 331 °C and 333 °C, respectively (Fig. S10a, ESI†). Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements unraveled that both the NFREAs exhibited amorphous aggregation with no solid-state thermal transition during the heating or cooling procedure (Fig. S10b, ESI†). In addition, EHOMO/ELUMO values calculated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) were −5.68/−3.86 eV and −5.70/−3.90 eV for BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl, respectively (Fig. S11, ESI†). The results were in accordance with the theoretical values from DFT calculations. Thus, as summarized in Fig. 2a, due to the deeper ELUMO ascribed from the chlorinated terminal groups, BOCIC-4Cl afforded smaller energy level offsets between the polymer donors, which might further result in a lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) in the relevant photovoltaic devices. In addition, contributing from the low-lying EHOMO, PSCs based on the polymer donor PBDB-TF could be expected to realize a higher VOC compared to devices based on its analogue PBDB-T (the chemical structures of the polymer donors are shown in Fig. 2b).

(e) Spectra of the absorption coefficient of the relevant blend films. 
Furthermore, the ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption spectra of the corresponding photoactive materials were characterized. First, in dilute chloroform solution, both the NFREAs showed absorbance in the range around 500–800 nm, with the maximum peaks (λmax) at 727 and 737 nm, for BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl, respectively (Fig. 2c). Also, two explicit shoulder peaks were observed at the wavelengths of 673 and 683 nm, indicating potential J-aggregation for both NFREAs in the solution state. Moreover, although the absorption profiles were similar, the light-harvesting capacities as represented by the molar extinction coefficient (ε) spectra were discrepant. From the solution to the film state, due to the strong solid-state aggregation, the absorption profiles of both NFREAs were sufficiently red-shifted and broadened to overlap the 500–1000 nm solar spectrum. Based on the bathochromic spectra, the λmax/λonset in the film state were located at 777/888 nm and 787/899 nm, resulting in optical band gaps (Eoptg) of 1.40 and 1.38 eV, respectively, for BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl. The red-shifted spectra of BOCIC-4Cl revealed its stronger aggregating behavior than BOCIC-4F. Besides, for both NFREAs, the shoulder peaks in the solution-state spectra turned into equal-height “camel-hump” peaks in the film state, suggesting the J-aggregation features were probably replaced by potential segregated HJ-aggregates. It has been widely reported that J- and H-aggregates of organic semiconductors are derived from “head-to-tail” and “side-by-side” arrangements, respectively.47,48 For both NFREAs in this work, the J-aggregation characteristics in solution concurrently originated from the interactions between halogen atoms (tail-to-tail) and π–π stacking (head-to-head), and these phenomena were also reported in the literature.49–51 In this case, although we could not tell the details of how the HJ-aggregates were formed in the NFREA-based films, the substantially diminished J-aggregates and emerged HJ-aggregates could be reasonably ascribed to arising from concealed halogen–halogen interactions (tail-to-tail) by other intermolecular interactions.
As shown in Fig. 2d, the fluorinated BOCIC-4F demonstrated an overall enhanced ε compared to the chlorinated BOCIC-4F in the whole absorption region, indicating BOCIC-4F would afford a greater contribution to the photocurrent in PSC devices than BOCIC-4Cl. The maximum ε values of BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl were calculated to be 1.37 × 105 and 9.11 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Commonly, for FREAs, Cl-substituted molecules show an improved light-harvesting capacity compared to their F-based counterparts,52,53 which is determined by the molecules, but also closely related to the stronger aggregation induced by Cl–Cl interactions. However, for NFREAs in this work, BOCIC-4Cl demonstrated no obviously stronger aggregating intensity than BOCIC-4F. Hence, the higher ε values of BOCIC-4F were reasonable and also verifiable by the results from other NFREAs.54
By blending NFREAs with polymer donors, the corresponding blend films showed strengthened light-harvesting capacities within the region of 400–700 nm. As shown in Fig. 2e, based on the improved absorbance, the blend films based on BOCIC-4F (PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F and PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4F) synchronously exhibited much higher absorption coefficients than their BOCIC-4Cl counterparts. The results indicated that devices based on BOCIC-4F could be expected to realize a higher photocurrent. Meanwhile, comparing the blends containing the same NFREA but different donor, the blend films based on PBDB-TF possessed stronger absorbance than that of PBDB-T. Furthermore, it was interesting to find that the absorption peaks at approximately 630 nm in the absorption spectra of the different blend films, which belonged to the contribution from the polymer donor PBDB-T or PBDB-TF, were not identical in terms of their intensities. More specifically, in the blends based on PBDB-TF, the peaks were obviously higher than the other two peaks contributed by the NFREAs (at ∼700 and ∼770 nm). In contrast, the PBDB-T-based blends appeared to give contrary results, with lower-intensity peaks contributed by the donor. Except for the intrinsically strong absorption of PBDB-TF, the phenomena above concurrently originated from the inferior miscibility between PBDB-TF and NFREAs compared to PBDB-T:NFREAs, which is further proved below.
2.3. Photovoltaic properties
Based on the varied combinations of polymer donors and NFREAs, PSCs in the conventional architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/3,3′-(1,3,8,10-tetraoxoanthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-2,9(1H,3H,8H,10H)-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine oxide) (PDINO)/Al were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for each donor:acceptor pair are shown in Fig. 3. First, PSCs based on PBDB-T:NFREAs were characterized. As summarized in Table 2, PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F realized a VOC of 0.68 V, JSC of 14.39 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 63.01%, resulting in a maximum PCE of 6.14%, respectively. As for the chlorinated BOCIC-4Cl, the combination of PBDB-T:BOCIC-4Cl afforded inferior performance with a lower PCE of 4.42%, together with overall declined VOC, JSC, and FF values of 0.62 V, 11.91 mA cm−2, and 59.89%, respectively. The decreased VOC and JSC of the BOCIC-4Cl-based devices were mediated by the aforementioned low-lying ELUMO and inadequate absorbance.

In succession, another donor polymer, PBDB-TF, with a deeper EHOMO and stronger absorbance, was employed to replace PBDB-T. As a result, the PCE of the devices based on PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4F declined to 4.46%. However, PBB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl showed an enhanced PCE of 5.02% compared to the PBDB-T based counterpart (4.42%). In this case, for the PBDB-TF system, BOCIC-4Cl afforded superior performance conversely. Both of the PSCs based on PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4F and PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl demonstrated an increased VOC of 0.76 and 0.74 V. Surprisingly, although the blends containing PBDB-TF had stronger light-harvesting capacities than PBDB-T (Fig. 2e), the corresponding PSCs yielded lower JSC. By comparison, PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl realized a higher JSC and FF of 10.92 mA cm−2 and 61.96%, compared to the 9.71 mA cm−2 and 59.69% from PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4F. The EQE characterizations suggested that PSCs based on PBDB-TF would have a wider spectra response but lower intensity in EQE compared to PBDB-T-based devices. Moreover, the variations in EQE intensities and integrated photocurrent densities were also in good accord with the results from the J–V measurements. To sum up the photovoltaic properties, PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F and PBDB-T:BOCIC-4Cl afforded the best and worst performances among all the donor:acceptor combinations. Further replacing PBDB-T by PBDB-TF lifted the PCE of the devices based on BOCIC-4Cl, but reduced the performance of BOCIC-4F. Hence, BOCIC-4F was more compatible with PBDB-T, while BOCIC-4Cl worked better with PBDB-TF.
2.4. Exciton dissociation and charge recombination
Characterizations of the charge dynamics were performed to assess the variations in the photovoltaic performance and to gain a deep insight into the varied compatibilities of different donor:acceptor paired PSCs. First, the photocurrent density (Jph) was plotted as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) to calculate the exciton dissociation probabilities (P(E,T)) based on the photocurrent density under the short-circuit and maximum output (Jsat) conditions (P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat).55 As shown in Fig. 3c, PSCs with a higher JSC concurrently realized a larger saturated Jph. For PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F with the best PCE, the P(E,T) was 0.96, which was the highest value followed by 0.89, 0.91, and 0.93, for PBDB-T:BOCIC-4Cl, PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4F, and PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl, respectively (Table 3). The higher P(E,T) value indicated a more sufficient exciton dissociation process in the corresponding blend. Additionally, by evaluating the power-law dependence of JSC on different light intensities (Plight), the bimolecular charge-recombination processes were estimated (Fig. 3d). In principle, a weak bimolecular charge recombination would lead to a linear relationship between JSC and Plight, with a power-law factor α approaching 1 in the equation: JSC ∝ Pαlight.56 In this work, the α values were calculated to be 1.00 and 0.98 for the PBDB-T-based devices with BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl as acceptors. Besides, for devices with PBDB-TF as the donor, the α values were 0.98 and 1.00 when blending with BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl, respectively. These results indicated that, in the blends of PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F and PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl, the excitons could be more efficiently dissociated with less charge-recombination loss.

2.5. Charge transfer and carrier transportation
The steady photoluminescence (PL) spectra of different neat and blend films were measured. By comparing the PL intensity of the neat films and the corresponding blend films, the PL-quenching efficiencies (ηPLQ) were calculated to evaluate the charge-transfer characteristics in different devices. In this work, the charge-transfer processes from the donors to the acceptors (Fig. 4a and b) and from the acceptors to the donors (Fig. 4c and d) were compared. First, the excitation wavelength was selected at 480 nm to excite the donor PBDB-T and its blends. The PL intensity was sufficiently quenched by blending NFREAs with PBDB-T. More specifically, the ηPLQ values in PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F and PBDB-T:BOCIC-4Cl were 99.45% and 90.81%, respectively, indicating the electron transfer between PBDB-T and BOCIC-4F was more efficient than that of BOCIC-4Cl. These results agreed well with the higher PCE of PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4b, from PBDB-TF to NFREAs, the PL-quenching processes were also efficient, with nearly identical ηPLQ values of 98.29% and 98.93% for PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4F and PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl. These results suggested that the electron transfer from PBDB-TF to BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl were comparably efficient. Furthermore, as demonstrated in Fig. 4c and d, the PL spectra of the different blend films were not sufficiently quenched at the excitation wavelength for exciting NFREAs, indicating that hole transfer from the NFREAs to the polymer donors was less efficient than the above-mentioned electron-transfer processes. For blends based on fluorinated BOCIC-4F, the ηPLQ values were 50.42% and 37.19% for PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F and PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4F. Besides, blending chlorinated BOCIC-4Cl with PBDB-T and PBDB-TF resulted in ηPLQ values of 49.75% and 64.67%, respectively. The higher ηPLQ values in PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F and PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl were consistent with the better device performance. To conclude, the more efficient hole and electron transfer induced by blending PBDB-T with BOCIC-4F synchronously contributed to improving the PCEs of the corresponding devices compared to PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4F. Differently, in the blends based on BOCIC-4Cl, only the facilitated hole transfer from BOCIC-4Cl to PBDB-TF determined the better performance compared to the PBDB-T:BOCIC-4Cl counterparts.

Furthermore, utilizing the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, the hole (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) of different blends were investigated. First, the electron-transporting ability of two NFREAs were estimated from the J1/2–V curves based on the relevant neat films (Fig. S12, ESI†). By comparison, the chlorinated NFREA BOCIC-4Cl showed a higher μe of 1.70 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 than the fluorinated BOCIC-4F, with a μe of 1.21 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Bearing the same conjugated backbone but different halogenated terminal atoms, the improved μe of BOCIC-4Cl was reasonably concluded to originate from the more intense molecular stacking induced by the stronger Cl⋯Cl intermolecular interactions than the F⋯F counterparts.57,58 In addition, from Fig. S13 (ESI†), the carrier mobilities of different donor:acceptor blends were calculated and are summarized in Table 3. For the PBDB-T system, the blends based on BOCIC-4F showed much enhanced μh and μe values of 4.14 × 10−4 and 4.03 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to the 2.41 × 10−4 and 1.74 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 of the BOCIC-4F-based blends. On the contrary, by replacing PBDB-T by PBDB-TF as the polymer donor, the chlorinated BOCIC-4Cl with inferior carrier transportation in the former blends outperformed that of BOCIC-4F, corresponding to μh and μe values of 3.07 × 10−4 and 1.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to 4.23 × 10−4 and 1.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In this case, the PSCs with superior photovoltaic properties were proved to possess better carrier transportation capabilities in the corresponding blends. Moreover, it was interesting to observe that the PBDB-TF-based blends showed prominently higher μe but comparable μh values compared to the blends containing PBDB-T. This phenomena probably predicted the different miscibilities between the NFREAs with different polymer donors. More specifically, PBDB-TF might afford poor miscibility with NFREAs, thus allowing it to form more continuous and larger-scale pure acceptor domains to facilitate electron transportation. On the other hand, the inferior μe of the PBDB-T-based blends potentially originated from the highly miscible donor:acceptor phases. The crystalline acceptor domains were formed by binding with a strong-aggregated polymer to a certain extent, further resulting in unbalanced-sized donor:acceptor domains that impact the carrier transportation.
2.6. Miscibility, morphology, and compatibility
In order to confirm the above conjectures about the miscibility-driven disparities in carrier dynamics, the Flory–Huggins interaction model was utilized though contact angle measurement to evaluate the miscibility and interaction between the different NFREAs and polymer donors. Images of distilled water (water phase) and diiodomethane (DIM, oil phase) upon different film surfaces for the contact angle measurement tests are shown in Fig. 5a and the relevant parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The surface free energies (γ) were calculated based on the Owens–Wendt surface energy model (eqn (1))59,60 (1)where the superscripts γd and γp represent the dispersion and polar components of the surface energy, respectively, and L and S refer to the probe liquid and film sample, respectively. For PBDB-T, PBDB-TF, BOCIC-4F, and BOCIC-4Cl, the surface free energies (γ) were obtained as 35.86, 32.53, 38.13, and 41.13 mN m−1, respectively. PBDB-T and BOCIC-4Cl showed higher γ values compared to their counterparts. In addition, based on eqn (2):61,62 (2)the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χ) were calculated to be 0.035 for χPBDB-T:BOCIC-4F, 0.18 for χPBDB-T:BOCIC-4Cl, 0.22 for χPBDB-TF:BOCIC-4F, and 0.50 for χPBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl, respectively. Here, a smaller χ value indicates a better miscibility between the two photoactive materials in the active layer blend. Also, in principle, good miscibility would facilitate well-intermixed phases and a small phase separation. In contrast, more precise phase separation and larger-sized domains would be induced by relatively poor miscibility. As investigated, the nonhalogenated PBDB-T presented better miscibility with the NFREAs compared to the halogenated PBDB-TF. These results were in good agreement with the conclusions in the literature,63 in which stronger molecular interactions and high miscibility were reported to probably originate from a large molecular electrostatic potential. Furthermore, according to the interfacial tensions equation (eqn (3)):64,65 (3)the interfacial surface energies between different donor:acceptor pairs were estimated based on the results of the surface free energies. In eqn (3,) γdonor:acceptor is the interfacial surface energy between different donor:acceptor pairs and β = 0.000115 m2 mN−2. Generally, the donor and acceptor components tend to form isolated phases when γdonor:acceptor is high. In contrast, the donor and acceptor components are distributed compactly when γdonor:acceptor is low, further reflecting the better miscibility between donor:acceptor pairs.66,67 Herein, the γdonor:acceptor values for PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F, PBDB-T:BOCIC-4Cl, PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4F, and PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl were calculated to be 0.079, 0.43, 0.47, and 1.12 mN m−1, respectively. Hence, several conclusions could be drawn from these results. First, PBDB-T with a higher γ value realized better miscibility with both of the NFREAs compared to PBDB-TF. These results confirmed the conjectures from the absorption profiles of the PBDB-TF-based blends and the remarkably enhanced μe of the PSCs based on PBDB-TF. Second, with respect to the NFREAs, chlorinated BOCIC-4Cl showed a relatively poorer miscibility with both polymer donors than the fluorinated BOCIC-4F. Finally, among the four blends, PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F with the smallest χ and γdonor:acceptor values afforded the best PCE. Additionally, PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl, which afforded the second-highest PCE, in contrast exhibited the largest χ and γdonor:acceptor values. These interesting phenomena reflected that the relationships between the donor:acceptor and the miscibility and photovoltaic performance were different for the different halogenated NFREAs (Fig. 5b).

Furthermore, the surface morphologies of the different neat and blend films were studied through atomic force microscopy (AFM). As found in Fig. S14 (ESI†), the polymer donors and NFREAs exhibited distinguishable aggregating features. Due to the coplanar molecular architectures, the NFREAs tended to form strong crystallinity with numerous island-like domains. In contrast, the surfaces of the polymer donors were relatively uniform. In addition, the halogenated polymer donor PBDB-TF and chlorinated NFREA BOCIC-4Cl demonstrated obviously stronger aggregation behaviors, with rougher surfaces with much higher root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values compared to their analogues. These phenomena were consistent with the enlarged χ values of the corresponding blends.
Additionally, the morphologies of varied blend films are demonstrated in Fig. 6. The blends with smaller χ values simultaneously showed smaller RMS roughnesses, indicating that a better miscibility could result in a smoother surface. The blends based on different donors were first compared. Specifically, blends based on PBDB-T showed a more fiber-like nanostructure, which was due to the aggregation behaviors of PBDB-T, indicating the crystalline domains of the NFREAs were hidden. In contrast, these fibers turned to be rather vague in the PBDB-TF-based blends. Within these blends with rougher surfaces, the morphological characteristics of the NFREAs obviously emerged due to the diminished miscibility. As a result, the pure acceptor domains grew into a larger scale, further inducing enhanced electron mobility and a more explicit phase separation. Moreover, by comparing the surface morphologies of the blends containing the same donor but different NFREAs, less nanofibers and an emerged island-structure originating from the crystalline acceptors could be found in PBDB-T:BOCIC-4Cl more than the BOCIC-4F-based blends. Meanwhile, the donor and acceptor phases were more separated in PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl than in PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4F. That is, the AFM results well-echoed the conclusions from the miscibility analysis. Also, different miscibility-driven morphologies resulted in disparities in the carrier dynamics. For PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F, the best misciblity led to well-mixed donor:acceptor and interpenetrating networks, further facilitating exciton dissociation and suppressing charge recombination. As for PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl bearing the poorest miscibility, a strong acceptor crystallinity and phase-separated morphology were formed to enhance the electron mobility and balance the carrier transport. Hence, it could be inferred that, for NFREAs with varied halogenated end-groups, different morphologies were acquired to realize better device performance.

3. Conclusion
In summary, consisting of difluorobenzoxadiazole and CPDT as uniform A′ cores and D bridges, the NFREAs BOCIC-4F and BOCIC-4Cl with an A-D-A′-D-A molecular framework were developed by employing fluorinated IC-2F and chlorinated IC-2Cl, respectively, as terminal groups. Both the NFREAs possessed synthetic simplicity, good thermal stability, and excellent molecular coplanarity. In addition, by bearing different halogenated end-groups, the photophysical, electrochemical, and aggregate behaviors turned out to be different. Specifically, fluorinated BOCIC-4F showed an improved light-harvesting capacity and high-lying energy levels. Also, bathochromic absorption profiles and stronger aggregating intensity were observed from the chlorinated BOCIC-4Cl. Furthermore, by employing PBDB-T and PBDB-TF as polymer donors, PSCs based on the NFREAs were fabricated to estimate the photovoltaic properties and the compatibility with different halogenated donor:acceptor pairs. Fluorinated BOCIC-4F showed better compatibility with the nonhalogenated donor PBDB-T, with a maximum PCE of 6.14%; while BOCIC-4Cl worked well with PBDB-TF with a higher PCE achieved in this blend. Furthermore, by estimating the relationships between the miscibility and morphology and the device performance, PBDB-T:BOCIC-4F with the best miscibility resulted in well-mixed phases and fibrillar nano-networks to facilitate exciton dissociation and suppress charge recombination. In contrast, the poorest miscibility from PBDB-TF:BOCIC-4Cl induced a phase-separated morphology and a more discernible pure acceptor crystallinity, which could also contribute to better device performance due to the higher electron mobility and balanced carrier transport compared to its BOCIC-4F counterpart. Our results systematically illuminated the property variations induced by different halogenated terminal groups and revealed the promising potential of difluorobenzoxadiazole as a central unit in constructing linear NFREAs. Also, more importantly, this work also provides insight for rationally constituting efficient PSCs by estimating the compatibility of suitable donor:acceptor combinations.
