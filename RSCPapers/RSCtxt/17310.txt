    , Accepted 1st March 2016First published on 2nd March 2016AbstractExtensive investigations in recent years have shown that addition of quantum dots (QDs) to a single-junction solar cell decreases the open circuit voltage, VOC, with respect to the reference cell without QDs. Despite numerous efforts, the complete voltage recovery in QD cells has been demonstrated only at low temperatures. To minimize the VOC reduction, we propose and investigate a new approach that combines nanoscale engineering of the band structure and the potential profile. Our studies of GaAs solar cells with various InAs QD media demonstrate that the main cause of the VOC reduction is the fast capture of photoelectrons from the GaAs conduction band (CB) to the localized states in QDs. As the photoelectron capture into QDs is mainly realized via the wetting layers (WLs), we substantially reduced the WLs using two monolayer AlAs capping of QDs. In the structures with reduced WLs, the direct CB-to-QD capture is further suppressed due to charging of QDs via doping of the interdot space. The QD devices with suppressed photoelectron capture show the same VOC as the GaAs reference cell together with some improvements in the short circuit current.
I. Introduction
Intriguing possibilities for nanoscale engineering of energy transfer between photons, electrons, and phonons have inspired numerous investigations of quantum dot (QD) structures for photovoltaic conversion of solar radiation.1 It has been found that QDs may increase the conversion efficiency due to enhanced coupling with solar radiation,2,3 multiple exciton generation,4–6 two-step light absorption,7–13 and thermionic emission from the dots induced by hot photoelectrons.14–16 Significant efforts in QD photovoltaics were devoted to development of the intermediate band (IB) solar cells, where hybridization of QD levels forms the intermediate band (IB), which is expected to provide two-step absorption of sub-bandgap photons, but does not introduce significant nonradiative relaxation from the conduction band (CB) to QDs.7
Various colloidal and solid-state QD photovoltaic materials were experimentally studied. The most detailed investigations were carried out on epitaxial InAs/GaAs structures because of maturity of the growth process and the well-understood properties of the III–V semiconductors.17 Numerous data have shown that the QD medium placed in the p–n junctions may noticeably increase the short circuit current, JSC, but reduces the open circuit voltage, VOC.8–11,13 Commonly, the increase of JSC may be achieved by decreasing the bandgap in a traditional single-gap solar cell, and this increase is accompanied by a reduction of VOC. Recent research has associated the JSC increase and VOC reduction in QD devices with slow radiative and fast thermal excitations of electrons from QDs to CB in InAs/GaAs structures8–11,18,19 and similarly excitation of holes from QDs to the valence band in Ge/Si structures.20 It is well understood now that the fast QD-to-CB excitation occurs due to the field-induced tunneling via thermo-excited QD states.8 To suppress this process, the QD structures with relatively thick (50–120 nm) spacer layers between QD planes were proposed, fabricated and studied.8,11,18–20 Some improvements in output voltage were reported and discussed mainly in terms of IB kinetics.18–22 However, the spacer layers with a thickness above 30 nm prevent the IB formation, suppress electron transfer between QDs, and facilitate charge accumulation in QDs. The charged dots drastically alter kinetic and transport processes in photovoltaic devices.23
Charging of QDs is an efficient tool to control the microscale potential profile via selective doping and to manage QD processes via a 3D nanoscale potential profile, which is formed by the barriers around dots.14,23–25 The microscale control allows fabrication of PV structures with sharp junctions, which improve electron–hole separation and reduce Shockley–Read–Hall recombination in the junction area. The 3D nanoscale profile is a new paradigm, which allows efficient control of all electron kinetic and transport processes in QD media. In particular, charging of QDs via modulation n-doping of the interdot space prevents photoelectron capture into QDs.14,23
Returning to the problem of VOC reduction, let us note that the fast thermo-activated escape from QDs results in a VOC value below that of the ideal two-step absorption model.7 However, this process does not dissipate any solar energy and cannot deteriorate the device performance with respect to the reference cell. Moreover, if the thermo-activated electron escape from QDs is induced by hot photoelectrons, this process reduces the relaxation losses, and improves the PV efficiency.14–16 Alternatively, the photoelectron capture from CB to QDs always decreases the light-induced shift of electron chemical potentials between CB and QDs, and in this way reduces VOC. Therefore, the main requirement for improvement of the output voltage is not suppression of the thermo-activated escape from QDs with respect to the radiative transitions from QDs, but suppression of photoelectron capture into QDs with respect to the band-to-band recombination. In the limit of strong suppression of capture, the QD-related increase in the short circuit current, δJSC, is expected to provide a small improvement in the open circuit voltage, (1)where JSC is the short circuit current in the device without QDs. Eqn (1) also assumes that the addition of QDs does not change recombination in the host material. The growth of QD media without defects that can enhance the recombination processes is a challenging technological problem. Finally, let us highlight that the processes of electron escape and capture may be controlled by doping the QD medium. The n-doping, i.e. negative charging of dots, increases thermo-activated escape, but reduces the photoelectron capture.
Kinetics of photoelectrons in structures with charged QDs has been intensively studied in QD IR photodetectors.26–30 In particular, it was found that the n-charging of QDs exponentially suppresses the capture processes and exponentially increases the IR photoresponse at liquid nitrogen temperatures.29 Detailed studies of the potential barriers around the dots30 are useful for understanding why QD charging cannot efficiently suppress the photoelectron capture in traditional GaAs/InAs QD solar cells at room temperatures. First, due to a relatively large phase volume of wetting layers (WLs) the capture processes from the CB to the dots mainly occur via the WLs. The WLs play a role of shallow traps, so in the absence of QDs the WLs frequently capture electrons and return them to the CB. In QD structures, the QDs mainly capture electrons that move in WLs. Second, the MBE-grown dots are strongly asymmetric with a low height-to-base aspect ratio. As a result, the potential barriers around the dots in the direction of the QD plane are by an order of magnitude smaller than that in the direction perpendicular to the QD planes. The typical value for the in-plane barrier is 2–3 meV per electron localized in a QD30 and, for example, five electrons per dot would substantially suppress the capture at nitrogen temperatures, but just slightly increase the capture time at room temperatures. Suppression of the WL-assisted capture into QDs at room temperatures would require very significant QD charging, which probably reduces the QD absorption. In this context, it is worth highlighting the original research31 that demonstrates no degradation in the open circuit voltage in InAs/GaAs QD solar cells when compared to a solar cell grown without QDs and composed solely of WLs. This observation also evidences that capture processes via WLs may play a key role in VOC reduction.
To formulate the goals of this research, let us summarize the above discussion of processes in QD media. If QD levels create the IB, suppression of thermal extraction of electrons from QDs as well as suppression of electron relaxation to QDs are very challenging. The proposed suppression of the field-assisted thermal extraction from dots due to a thick spacing layer8,10,11 leads to localization of the QD states and QD charging. The nanoscale barriers created via n-charging of QDs may be employed to suppress the photoelectron capture. However, suppression of the capture processes via WL would require very strong QD charging that decreases light harvesting by QDs. Therefore, reduction of wetting layers is expected to suppress photoelectron capture into QDs and to recover the open circuit voltage to that of the reference cell.
In this paper, we investigate GaAs solar cells with InAs QDs capped by AlGaAs layers, which practically eliminate WL states. We have fabricated and characterized QD devices with WLs and with reduced wetting layers (RWL). A complete recovery of the open circuit voltage in the RWL QD devices with respect to the reference cell is shown.
II. Experimental
Two QD solar cell samples and a reference single junction GaAs sample were grown by molecular beam epitaxy using an As2 beam from a valved cracker source. Fig. 1(a) shows a cross section of the solar cell structure. The reference sample consists of a 300 nm n+-GaAs buffer layer and a 50 nm n+-Al0.2Ga0.8As back surface field layer with a doping density of 5 × 1018cm−3, a 2.1 μm n-GaAs base layer doped to 2 × 1017 cm−3 with Si, and a 200 nm p-type emitter with carbon doping density of 5 × 1018 cm−3. The entire stack was capped with a 30 nm p-Al0.2Ga0.8As window with 5 × 1018 cm−3 doping and a 50 nm thick highly doped p+-GaAs contact layer.

(b–c) Dark field g = (002) micrographs of the QD structures (b) with a wetting layer (WL) and (c) with a reduced wetting layer (RWL). Insets: detailed structures of the WL and RWL QD samples. 
The two QDSC samples had a similar structure to that of the reference cell except that a 1.1 μm thick QD stack was inserted into the base region next to the p–n junction. The QD stack consists of 20 layers of self-assembled InAs QDs separated by 50 nm GaAs spacers. The higher growth temperature and thickness of GaAs spacers were chosen to minimize defect formation and to suppress tunneling between the dots.
The QD section of the WL sample contained an 18 nm thick GaAs layer grown at 600 °C followed by a 6 nm GaAs layer at 530 °C. The temperature was lowered for the growth of the QD layer that consisted of 2 ML of InAs deposited on GaAs at 520 °C and capped with 5 nm GaAs at the same temperature, and further covered with a 25 nm GaAs spacer layer at 600 °C. The RWL QD section consisted of 2.1 ML of InAs deposited on top of 7 ML of Al0.2Ga0.8As barriers and capped with 2 ML of AlAs to suppress In surface redistribution and evaporation. The QD layer was covered with 7 ML of Al0.2Ga0.8As barriers followed by deposition of 25 nm GaAs at 600 °C. The poor mobility of Al adatoms results in a conformal layer of AlAs on the quantum dots.32,33 Therefore, besides reduction of the wetting layer this growth procedure also leads to the formation of nanoscale AlGaAs barriers around InAs QDs.34,35 Together with potential barriers, these barriers also enhance separation of the localized QD states and CB.34 Reduction of the WL due to passivation of QDs with an AlAs cap layer and its positive effect on VOC were investigated in ref. 36. Thus, the QD solar cells with reduced WLs demonstrate a better performance than traditional QD PV devices. However, the efficiency and VOC of QD solar cells with reduced WLs were always below efficiency and the VOC of the corresponding GaAs reference devices.35,36 In our opinion, the decrease in efficiency is a consequence of the p–i–n structure of these QD devices. As discussed in the Introduction, placing of a QD medium in the undoped region strongly enhances SRH recombination losses, but doping of the QD medium with IB decreases the efficiency due to charge accumulation at the boundaries of the QD medium.
To evaluate the QD density, a partial solar cell structure with growth termination after completion of the fourth QD layer was capped with 2 ML of AlAs to prevent QDs from further evolution. The QD density measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was close to 2 × 1010 cm−2. Modulation doped QDs were prepared by placing 1 nm Si-doped layers inside the GaAs spacers. The electrons from the dopant layer occupy the QD ground states. The dopant sheet density was chosen to provide about one electron per dot. To observe the difference in the wetting layer formation and to verify the absence of strain-related dislocations, the QDSC structures were analyzed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Square 300 × 300 μm2 solar cells were fabricated using photolithography and dry etching for trench isolation down to the n-GaAs substrate. For a p-type contact, a Cr/Au metal stack was deposited by electron beam evaporation followed by lift-off. The samples were passivated with silicon nitride (SiN) to minimize surface recombination. A blanket indium metal layer was used as a backside contact.
Current–voltage characteristics were measured using a Newport Oriel simulator at 1 Sun AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) at room temperature. A PMA 2100 pyranometer was used to calibrate the simulator intensity. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using 532 nm laser excitation, dispersed by a monochromator and detected using an InGaAs photodetector. The external quantum efficiency spectral dependence was measured using a halogen lamp and a monochromator as an optical source.
III. Results and discussion
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of the QDSC samples were carried out to observe the details of the QD ensembles. Fig. 1(b and c) show the cross-sectional dark field TEM micrographs obtained under g = 200 diffraction conditions, where the structure factors predict InAs to appear bright and GaAs dark, while the strain contrast is less pronounced. The QDs in the WL sample are visibly larger than in the RWL sample; the image analysis gives the average lateral QD sizes of 21 nm and 16 nm, and QD sheet densities of 2 × 1010 cm−2 and 3 × 1010 cm−2 in the WL and RWL samples, respectively. The reduced QD size and increased density are related to dot nucleation on the AlAs-containing surface.32 In the WL sample image, the bright lines indicate formation of a thin wetting InAs layer almost everywhere between the dots. To observe the detailed structure of the wetting layer, the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning TEM images are shown in Fig. 2 along with the intensity profiles averaged normal to the interfaces as indicated in the figure. As HAADF image contrast is mostly sensitive to the atomic number (∼z2), the indium-containing atomic columns appear brighter with higher scattered intensity in the profiles, and the Al-containing layers have a darker contrast (Fig. 2b and d). This property of HAADF imaging allows direct visualization of In and Al distribution. The WL sample demonstrates a quite wide (∼9 MLs), and brighter contrast corresponding to In segregation and surface redistribution during QD overgrowth.33,37 In the RWL sample, the InAs WL appears just 1.5–2 ML thick which is due to fast “freezing” of the growing surface by deposition of 2 ML of AlAs. The small thickness of the InAs WL in the RWL sample along with the adjacent wide-bandgap AlAs capping likely results in pushing up the WL energy level to above the GaAs band edge,37 which is confirmed by the photoluminescence spectroscopy below. It is also noted that no dislocations were formed in the structure even though no strain-compensating layers were employed.

The luminescence properties of InAs/GaAs QDs with and without the wetting layer were compared using room temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Fig. 3 shows the PL spectra excited by a 532 nm laser with an intensity of ∼20 W cm−2. The ground state emission peaks were observed at 1030 nm and 1115 nm for the RWL and WL samples, respectively; the PL blue shift in the RWL sample is mainly due to a reduction of QD sizes.32 Based on the TEM results, the average numbers of atoms (In + As) in the QDs were estimated: 1.2 × 104 and 2.1 × 104 for the RWL and WL samples which predict the ground state transition wavelengths of 1055 nm and 1119 nm in InAs/GaAs QDs.38 The match for the WL sample is good, and the extra ∼20 meV redshift of the RWL peak position can be explained by the additional AlSb wide-bandgap barrier layer affecting the quantum confinement energy.

The first excited state transition appears as shoulders blue-shifted by ∼63 meV from the ground state transition energies. The small peak observed for the WL sample at 930 nm is related to the transitions in the InGaAs wetting layer, and these transitions are absent in the RWL sample. As discussed above, this likely result from high quantum confinement energy of carriers in a very thin InAs potential well embedded into a wider-bandgap AlGaAs (Fig. 2d) in the RWL sample. The stronger GaAs band-to-band recombination peak in the RWL sample evidences that the reduction of the wetting layer strongly suppresses the capture processes, and thus the photocarriers mainly recombine via band-to-band processes.

Fig. 4 shows current–voltage characteristics measured under 1 Sun AM 1.5G of the reference GaAs solar cell and two QDSC samples. The data from five devices measured across each wafer are presented to illustrate the variability of results. The parameters of the cells are summarized in Table 1. Both QDSCs show a significant improvement of short circuit current (JSC) as compared to the reference cell, but the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the WL QDSC degrades by about 100 mV. Therefore, despite the 3 mA cm−2 increase in the short circuit current, the efficiency of the WL sample drops by 0.2% with respect to the reference GaAs cell. In contrast, the RWL sample with the AlAs cap and Al0.2Ga0.8As barriers maintained similar VOC as the reference cell. The recovered open circuit voltage of the RWL sample is complemented by an additional 2.1 mA cm−2 of JSC and results in an absolute increase of 1.2% power conversion efficiency when compared to the reference sample.

Fig. 5 shows the dark I–V characteristics of the reference and two QDSC samples. First of all, let us note that the current of the RWL sample is almost identical to that of the reference cell. To analyze generation–recombination processes around the open circuit voltage, we fitted the experimental dark current curves in the range of 0.65–0.95 V by the two-diode model, (2)
 Fig. 5  Dark current–voltage characteristics of the reference GaAs sample and the two QDSC samples. Dashed lines indicate the exponents with ideality factors 1.5 and 2.0. 
The first term in eqn (2) is associated with the radiative G–R processes (ideality factor n = 1) and the second term with the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination (n = 2) in the junction area. Two parameters J01 and J02 determined in this fitting procedure are presented in Table 1. As seen, the J01 values are very close for RWL and Ref. devices, while in the WL device the J01 increases by two orders in magnitude. This means that the radiative recombination is substantially enhanced in devices with WLs. In other words, WLs are effective traps that substantially enhance the radiative recombination processes. The J02 values are of the same order for all samples, which evidences that the corresponding SRH recombination losses are close in all QD and reference cells. It is worth noting that this is a result of significant doping of a QD medium with localized QD states. Doping reduces the width of the junction and decreases the SRH recombination losses in PV conversion. On the contrary, in the IBSC design the QD medium is placed in the space charge region with a strong electric field and, therefore, the QD medium gives substantial SRH losses. The negative effect of the SRH recombination on VOC is given by the dimensionless parameter ζ = J022/(4J01JOC), i.e. at ζ ≪ 1 the second term in eqn (2) may be neglected. Calculations show that in this context the SRH recombination is negligible in WL devices. In the reference cell and the QD RWL cell, the SRH parameter ζ is 0.37 and 0.33 respectively, i.e. the SRH recombination in these devices is relatively small. Thus, in both the reference cell and RWL device the VOC is mainly determined by the radiative processes.

Fig. 6 plots the comparison of external quantum efficiency spectra for the QDSC samples and the reference GaAs sample. The spectral response to all the samples resembles that of a typical GaAs SC with a band edge at 880 nm. Samples with QDs exhibit a slightly higher response than the reference GaAs SC in the 700–880 nm band-to-band region. A relatively low absorption coefficient of GaAs in this region39 (∼104 cm−1) makes the efficiency sensitive to the SC thickness in the 1–3 μm range. In our QDSCs, the efficiency increase is due to either light scattering by QDs, or more likely due to the strong absorption of the above-GaAs-bandgap photons in the narrow-bandgap InAs QDs. This effect increases the photocurrent in the majority of the QDSCs as shown in Table 1. In the sub-bandgap range, the EQE spectra of WL devices show the prominent peak at 930 nm, which corresponds to transitions to the wetting layer in agreement with the corresponding peak in the PL spectrum.
 Fig. 6  EQE spectra of reference GaAs and two QDSCs showing bulk GaAs and sub-bandgap absorption regions. The integrated sub-bandgap short circuit current is measured under 1 Sun simulator with an IR longpass (λ > 900 nm) filter. Dotted lines show PL spectra of QD samples as in Fig. 3 on a logarithmic scale. 
The contribution of the sub-bandgap radiation to the SC current was measured using a 1 Sun (AM 1.5G) simulator with an IR longpass (λ > 900 nm) filter. The photocurrents of 0.3 and 0.05 mA cm−2 were measured in the WL and RWL SCs, respectively. The ratio of these values (= 6.0) is in good agreement with the EQE data integrated over the sub-bandgap region (= 7.2). It should be noted that EQE measurements were performed without optical bias; therefore, in both cases, the photocurrent was significantly less than that using a sun simulator.
Now we consider the photocarrier kinetics in PV devices with localized intermediate states, to obtain the conditions for VOC recovery, and to discuss realization of these conditions in our measurements. For our goals it is convenient to present the Shockley–Queisser type kinetic equations for the photocarrier concentration in the conduction band, n, and the concentration in the QD states, n1, in the following way (3) (4)where d is the thickness of the absorber,  and  are the photon fluxes absorbed due to band-to-band transitions and transitions from the valence band to QD states correspondingly, and  is the addition to  due to the enhancement of the band-to-band transitions by QDs, for example, due to photon scattering by QDs. The characteristic times describe the recombination, capture, and thermal generation: τR is the recombination time for carriers in the conduction band, τ1R is the recombination time in QDs, τcap is the capture time to QDs, τth is the time of thermal escape from QDs to the conduction band, and τr is the characteristic time of the radiative transition from QDs to the conduction band. Let us take into account the detailed balance between capture and thermal escape processes in equilibrium, neq/τcap = neq1/τth,(5)and express the photocarrier concentrations via the photo-induced chemical potentials of carriers in the band, μ, and in QDs, μ1, μ = kBTln(n/neq), μ1 = kBTln(n1/neq1).(6)
Employing eqn (5) and (6), the kinetic eqn (3) and (4) in stationary conditions take the form (7) (8)
Taking into account that VOC = μ, we can see that without a QD medium the value of VOC is determined by the first two terms in eqn (7). The third and fourth terms in eqn (7) describe small additions to the short circuit current due to QD enhanced band-to-band absorption (third) and contributions of two step absorption processes and hot-electron induced thermionic emissions from QDs. The last term in eqn (7) and (8) describes the phonon-induced photocarrier exchange between the conduction band and QD localized states. If τcap ≪ τR, the thermal exchange rate, neq/τcapexp(μ/kBT), dominates over all other terms in eqn (7) and (8). Therefore, in this case, exp(μ/μ1) = 1, i.e. μ1 = μ. Thus, under the condition τcap ≪ τR, the kinetic equations reduce to (9)

Eqn (9) has a form of the Shockley–Queisser equation for a single bandgap semiconductor with the bandgap value equal to that in QDs. Thus, if the photoelectron capture into QDs dominates over the band-to-band radiative recombination, the addition of the QD medium to a single junction cell reduces VOC and increases JSC. Let us highlight that in this case the two-step absorption processes do not provide a VOC increase.
In the opposite case, τcap ≫ τR, the electron coupling between the conduction band and QDs is weak. Usually, QD media provides a relatively small contribution to the short circuit current. Then the correction to VOC may be calculated from eqn (7) and (8) in a perturbative way, (10)where δJSC is the total increase in the short circuit current due to QD media. If the capture time reaches infinity, eqn (10) is transformed into eqn (1) that is obvious in the absence of the capture processes.
Now let us return to analysis of our experiments. According to the above discussion the condition for the voltage recovery is τcap ≥ τR.(11)
The typical value of the band-to-band recombination time in GaAs is ∼1 ns. It is well understood that in traditional InAs/GaAs QD structures the photoelectron capture is realized via WLs and the corresponding capture time is several picoseconds.40,41 Thus, in QD media with WLs the capture time is by at least two orders of magnitude shorter than the recombination time and, therefore, the measured open circuit voltage is always substantially smaller than that in the reference cell.
In the QD structures without the wetting layer, the rate of photoelectron capture into the charged QD may be evaluated as14,23,27 (12)where NQD is the concentration of QDs, VQD is the volume of a QD, φ is the average repulsive potential at the QD boundary, which is proportional to the quantum dot charge, and τε is the inelastic electron–phonon relaxation time, which corresponds to the transitions from the conduction band to relatively deep localized QD levels. It should be emphasized that at low temperatures the capture into QDs has a cascade character. Firstly, an electron is trapped in delocalized QD states, such as minibands formed by periodically placed QD layers, and then relaxes to localized QD levels. At room temperature electrons trapped in delocalized QD states are thermally excited back to the continuum states. Therefore, to be captured, the electron should be directly trapped to relatively deep QD levels separated from the continuous spectrum by energy of at least 2–3 kBT, which is a typical value for electron level spacing in QDs. Such relaxation is realized via two-phonon emission, which may include various combinations of optical and acoustic modes. Detailed calculations42 show the two-phonon processes with transferred energy above 40 meV are very slow and the corresponding relaxation time exceeds 1 ns. However, the defects strongly enhance the two-phonon relaxation and reduce the relaxation time, τε, to several picoseconds.43 Taking into account that in our QD media NQDVQD = 0.02 and for one-electron QD charging the exponential factor is 0.3, from eqn (12) we obtain the capture time of ∼1 ns. Thus, the capture time significantly increases in QD media with suppressed WL and even one-electron charging has the same order as the recombination time. As discussed, the voltage recovery takes place when τcap reaches τR.
IV. Conclusions
Engineering of a nanoscale potential profile is an effective tool to control electron processes in solar cells. We fabricated and studied photovoltaic devices with various QD media. EQE measurements and direct measurements with an IR longpass filter under 1 Sun show that harvesting of sub-bandgap photons in QD media provides 0.3 mA cm−2 and 0.05 mA cm−2 contributions in the WL and RWL devices, respectively. The EQE and photovoltaic measurements with and without optical/IR bias show that in our devices the light-induced two-step transitions provide a relatively small contribution to photovoltaic conversion. Thus, we confirm8–11,13 that thermal excitation processes mainly determine electron transitions from QDs to CB. However, thermal excitation from QDs does not reduce the short circuit voltage with respect to the reference cell. Our main result is complete voltage recovery in QD devices with reduced wetting layer. The recovery has been reached due to suppression of electron capture processes from the CB to QDs. Reduction of the WL and n-charging of QDs strongly prevent capture of photoelectrons and, therefore, maintain the light-induced shift between the chemical potentials of electrons in QDs and the CB.
Let us note that the highest values of VOC (0.994 V) in a QD solar cell close to the reference cell VOC (1.04 V) were observed in ref. 9. However, these devices were designed as p–i–n structures, where a very thin (100 nm) i-region in the reference device was replaced in the QD cell by the ten layer QD medium of approximately the same thickness. Therefore, in all these structures the light-induced chemical potential was mainly generated in the thick (∼3 μm) n-doped region, while the contribution of the 100 nm i-region (QD medium) was small due to its small relative thickness.
The presented description of photoelectron processes and their contributions to photovoltaic conversion also provide qualitative explanation of the recent results by other groups. To the best of our knowledge, the voltage recovery was studied in QD PV devices with relatively thick spacer layers (>30 nm), i.e. in devices with localized QD states. Therefore, it is not surprising that the obtained results show strong dependence of the open circuit voltage on the QD charge and its significant improvement due to n-doping. Ref. 18 reported the voltage recovery of 121 mV that was observed in the sample with eight electrons per dot compared with the undoped sample. Recent work19 studied the QD in well structures and reported a 105 mV voltage recovery at the doping level of eighteen electrons per dot. As we discussed in the Introduction, the n-doping of QD media reduces electron capture into QDs, but enhances the electron thermal escape from QDs. Thus, the voltage recovery requires significant suppression of the capture processes with respect to the band-to-band recombination, but not thermal escape from QDs with respect to the corresponding radiative transition.
Despite some voltage recovery due to n-doping,18,19 in all papers the VOC of QD devices was found to be below that of the reference cells. The complete voltage recovery was only demonstrated in the doped QD structures with thick spacer (80 nm) at low temperatures.21,22 Taking into account that carrier capture is mainly realized via emission of an optical phonon,27–29 strong suppression of the carrier capture into QDs at low temperatures is highly expected. Thus, the results of ref. 21 and 22 also show that photoelectron capture is the main reason for the VOC reduction.
Control of nanoscale physical processes that strongly affect the open circuit voltage is important for the development of various QD photovoltaic materials and devices. Nanomaterials with charged QDs and the corresponding 3D nanoscale potential profile provide real mechanisms for suppression of photoelectron capture and increasing the output voltage.
