However, the stability of SOCs, particularly the deterioration of the performance of oxygen electrodes in the SOEC operation mode, is the most critical issue in the development of high performance and durable SOCs. In this study, we investigate in detail the electrochemical activity and stability of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) oxygen electrodes in cyclic SOEC and SOFC modes. The results show that the deterioration of LSM oxygen electrodes caused by anodic polarization can be partially or completely recovered by subsequent cathodic polarization. Using in situ assembled LSM electrodes without pre-sintering, we demonstrate that the deteriorated LSM/YSZ interface can be repaired and regenerated by operating the cells under cathodic polarization conditions. This study for the first time establishes the foundation for the development of truly reversible and stable SOCs for hydrogen fuel production and electricity generation in cyclic SOEC and SOFC operation modes.
1 Introduction
Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power provide opportunities to mitigate greenhouse emissions and supply sustainable energy to replace limited fossil fuels. As solar and wind power sources are intermittent in nature, means of conversion to another energy form is required for energy storage and regeneration of electricity when needed.1–3 A solid oxide cell (SOC) system is very attractive for storage and regeneration of renewable electricity. The SOC can be operated in the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) mode to store electricity in the form of fuels like H2, and in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode to regenerate electricity using stored fuels (Scheme 1). A SOC with dual function of electricity generation and H2 production at a temperature of 800 °C can achieve a round-trip efficiency of 40–63%.4,5

The most significant challenge regarding the performance and durability of the reversible SOC system is the severe degradation, in particular, of oxygen electrodes, in the SOEC mode. In principle, the SOC system is designed and developed based on the existing SOFC technologies and materials. SOFC technologies have been extensively studied since 1980s and significant achievements have been made.6,7 However, the development of SOEC technologies is most recent and the state-of-the-art SOFC materials experience a much higher performance degradation under the SOEC operating conditions.8 The major decay of the SOEC is attributed to oxygen electrodes.9,10 There are several proposed degradation mechanisms such as the delamination of the electrode from the electrolyte,11–15 compositional changes of electrode materials,16,17 and poisoning of oxygen electrodes by volatile contaminants such as chromium.18–20 We have studied electrode degradation and delamination of (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSM) oxygen electrodes and observed the disintegration of LSM grains into LSM nanoparticles (NPs) in the electrode/electrolyte interface region, resulting from lattice shrinkage induced localized internal stress in the LSM grains in direct contact with the YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrolyte under the anodic polarization conditions.21,22
However, there have been reports that operation in the SOFC mode, i.e. cathodic polarization is beneficial to suppress the electrode degradation of the cells induced in the SOEC mode. Hughes et al. observed that reversing the current on symmetric LSM–YSZ oxygen electrodes enhanced the lifetime of the electrodes.23 More recently, Graves et al. reported that for a SOEC with LSM–YSZ oxygen electrodes, continuous electrolysis at a current of 1 A cm−2 for 420 h led to a substantial microstructure deterioration such as nanosized pore or oxygen gas bubble formation near the oxygen electrode/electrolyte interface and the loss of energy efficiency from 96% to 75%.5 On the other hand, the performance deterioration of the LSM–YSZ oxygen electrodes can be completely eliminated by reversible operation for 1 h in the electrolysis mode and for 5 h in the fuel cell mode over the durability test of 4000 h.5 Hughes et al. considered that there may be an incubation time before the delamination of electrode occurs, and interrupting the anodic polarization time to less than the incubation period would interrupt the degradation process and drive the process toward the opposite direction.23 Graves et al. proposed a hypothesis of the possible disappearance or limited growth of the oxygen gas bubbles or nanosized voids due to the periodic release of high oxygen pressure at the interface in the SOFC mode.5 However, there are no direct evidences of the repair of nanosized pores or gas bubbles under the cyclic operation of SOEC and SOFC modes and fundamentally, the reasons for the reversible operation of the SOCs are poorly understood.
Most recently, we studied the electrode/electrolyte interface under high temperature sintering and electrochemical polarization conditions and showed that the electrode/electrolyte interface can be induced under cathodic polarization conditions without high temperature pre-sintering.24 Here, polarization and microstructural behaviour of pristine LSM oxygen electrodes under cyclic anodic and cathodic polarization conditions have been studied in detail. The reason to use LSM instead of the LSM–YSZ composite oxygen electrode is that in the case of the LSM oxygen electrode, the electrochemical reaction is limited within the electrode/electrolyte interface region. This simplifies the electrochemical as well as microstructural examination and analysis, thus facilitating the fundamental investigation. The results show that the fundamental reasons for the reversible operation of SOCs in SOEC and SOFC polarization modes are the self-healing and regeneration of the electrode/electrolyte interface in the cathodic SOFC operation mode.
2 Experimental
YSZ (8 mol% Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2, 0.2 mm thick, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China) was used as the electrolyte. La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM, Fuel Cell Materials) powder was dispersed in an ink vehicle (Fuel Cell Materials) in a weight ratio of 5:5, prepared on the YSZ electrolytes by slurry coating and pre-sintered at 1150 °C for 3 h. The sintering temperature for the LSM electrode should not be too high as the high sintering temperature would cause agglomeration of the electrode structure and possible solid state reaction between LSM and YSZ to form insulating lanthanum zirconate. In the present study, we selected a sintering temperature of 1150 °C as this is the most common temperature for LSM electrodes to form an intimate electrode/electrolyte interface and at the same time to avoid the possible solid state reaction between LSM and YSZ.25 The thickness of pre-sintered LSM was ∼20 μm and the electrode area was 0.5 cm2.
A three-electrode half-cell setup was used for the electrochemical measurement. Platinum paste (Gwent Electronic Materials Ltd) was applied on the other side of the electrolytes, that is, the counter and reference electrodes.26 The pre-sintered LSM oxygen electrodes were polarized under continuous anodic polarization at 500 mA cm−2 and 800 °C in air using a Gamry Reference 3000 Potentiostat. In the case of cyclic anodic/cathodic polarization tests, different polarization regimes at different current densities were used. For example, for the cyclic operation under 36 h anodic and 12 h cathodic polarization, the polarization regime is denoted as 36 h-anodic/12 h-cathodic polarization. The polarization was interrupted from time to time to measure the impedance responses under open circuit in a frequency range of −0.1 Hz–100 kHz. The electrode ohmic resistance, RΩ, was directly measured from the high frequency intercept on the impedance curves and the electrode polarization resistance, RE, was measured from the differences between the low and high frequency intercepts.
To study the effect of cathodic polarization on the electrode/electrolyte interface, specifically designed in situ assembled LSM electrodes were polarized under cathodic or anodic current passage at 200, 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 and 800 °C. In this case, LSM electrodes were applied to the YSZ electrolyte by slurry coating, and directly placed into the test holder without pre-sintering at 1150 °C as in the case of conventional LSM oxygen electrodes.24
The microstructures of the LSM electrode and the YSZ electrolyte surface after polarization were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss NEON 40EsB). The LSM oxygen electrodes were embedded in epoxy resin under vacuum. Thin wafer samples were lifted out in a focused ion beam-SEM (FIB-SEM, FEI Quanta 200i 3D) and polished in another FIB-SEM (HITACHI MI4000L). Microstructure observation and elemental mapping analysis of the wafer samples were carried out using HITACHI MI4000L equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector. Pre-sintered and in situ assembled LSM electrodes after polarization tests were removed by hydrochloric acid treatment at room temperature for 48 h. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, alpha 300 SAR, WITec GmbH, Ulm Germany; probe: silicon probe, spring constant 40 N m−1) was used to examine the electrolyte surface in the intermittent contact mode.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Electrochemical performance

Fig. 1 shows the RΩ and RE plots of a pre-sintered LSM oxygen electrode on a 0.2 mm-thick electrolyte during polarization at 500 mA cm−2 and 800 °C. In the case of continuous anodic polarization (Fig. 1a), the RE behaviour can be divided into three regions. The initial RE is 7.0 Ω cm2, increases to 8.7 Ω cm2 after polarization for 15 min followed by a rapid decrease, reaching a minimum of 2.3 Ω cm2 at 20 h (region I). RE then increases slowly up to 60 h (region II). In region III, RE increases rapidly and is 8.2 Ω cm2 after polarization for 100 h. RΩ increases gradually with the increase of polarization time up to 60 h (regions I and II), and it increases faster in region III. The initial RΩ is 0.39 Ω cm2 and increases to 1.0 Ω cm2 after polarization for 100 h. The fast increase of RΩ and RE in region III indicates the loss of contact at the electrode/electrolyte interface. This is indicated by the delamination of the LSM oxygen electrode after the test.

The electrochemical behaviour of LSM electrodes was also measured under the reversible cyclic test of the 36 h-anodic/12 h-cathodic polarization regime at 500 mA cm−2 and 800 °C. In the 1st cycle (Fig. 1b), the RE behaves similarly to that under continuous anodic polarization and reaches 4.9 Ω cm2 after anodic polarization for 36 h. The electrode activity is further enhanced by cathodic polarization and RE decreases rapidly to 0.39 Ω cm2 after cathodic polarization for 1 h. RΩ also decreases slightly after cathodic polarization. This indicates the well-known promotion effect of cathodic polarization on the electrocatalytic activity of LSM electrodes.27 In the 2nd cycle, anodic polarization causes a rapid increase of RE, reaching 8.5 Ω cm2 after anodic polarization for 36 h. Similar to RE, RΩ also increased from 0.43 to 0.92 Ω cm2. The increase in both RE and RΩ indicates that anodic polarization deteriorates the electrochemical activity of the LSM oxygen electrode and the contact at the LSM/YSZ interface. With the application of reversible cathodic polarization for 12 h, RE and RΩ are reduced to 0.32 and 0.46 Ω cm2, respectively, indicating the drastic increase by cathodic polarization. However, the gradual increase in RE and RΩ after the anodic polarization period (indicated by the dotted line, Fig. 1b) shows that the deteriorated activity and interfaces under anodic polarization are partially recovered by reversed cathodic polarization in this case.

Fig. 2 shows the impedance responses during the first 2 cycles of reversible tests. The impedance curves before anodic polarization are characterized by a large depressed arc. In the 1st cycle, the size of impedance curves, i.e. RE, increases after anodic polarization for 5 min and decreases significantly after polarization for 36 h; the variation of the electrode impedance is particularly pronounced in the low frequencies (Fig. 2a). The enhancement of electrode activity by anodic polarization is attributed to the increase of the reaction surface area due to the formation of LSM NPs on the electrolyte surface under the anodic polarization potential driving force.21 Cathodic polarization leads to a substantial decrease of impedance particularly in the low frequencies (Fig. 2b). In the 2nd cycle, the electrode impedance at both high and low frequencies increases significantly by anodic polarization (Fig. 2c), but decreases again by cathodic polarization (Fig. 2d). This indicates that the decay of electrocatalytic activity under anodic polarization is reversed under cathodic polarization.

The deteriorated electrochemical activity and interface contact can be completely recovered by appropriately adjusting the anodic/cathodic polarization regimes. Fig. 3 shows the plots of RΩ and RE for the reaction on LSM electrodes under the cyclic test of the 12 h-anodic/12 h-cathodic polarization regime at 200 and 500 mA cm−2 and 800 °C. Different from that observed in the 36 h-anodic/12 h-cathodic polarization regime (Fig. 1b), the loss of electrochemical activity and interface contact can be completely recovered, indicated by the reversibility of both RΩ and RE values by cyclic anodic and cathodic polarization. For example, in the case of 500 mA cm−2, in the 5th cyclic test, RE increased to 12.9 Ω cm2 after 12 h-anodic polarization and decreased to 0.89 Ω cm2 after subsequent 12 h-cathodic polarization, which is more or less the same as 12.6 and 0.91 Ω cm2 after 12 h-anodic/12 h-cathodic polarization in the 4th cyclic test, respectively. Similar behaviour was also observed for RΩ and for the reaction at 200 mA cm−2 (indicated by the dotted lines in Fig. 3).

3.2 Microstructure

Fig. 4 shows the SEM micrographs of LSM and YSZ surfaces at the electrode/electrolyte interface after polarization at 500 mA cm−2 and 800 °C. For continuous anodic polarization for 100 h, NP clusters were observed within contact rings of 1.15 ± 0.33 μm in size (AFM results below show that these contact regions are related to the convex contact rings on the electrolyte surface). The NPs are 82 ± 26 nm in size with little contact between them (Fig. 4a). These NPs are identified as the LSM phase by grazing incident X-ray diffractometry.20 On the inner surface of the LSM electrode in contact with the electrolyte are few irregularly shaped fine particles (Fig. 4b). In the case of the YSZ electrolyte surface after 4 cyclic 36 h-anodic/12 h-cathodic polarization at 500 mA cm−2 and 800 °C, the NPs in the ring areas appear to be compacted with enhanced particle-to-particle connection (Fig. 4c). Similar to the case of continuous anodic polarization, there is a formation of fine particles on the LSM inner surface (Fig. 4d).

The scale bar is 200 nm. 
The YSZ electrolyte surface after the removal of LSM electrodes by HCl treatment was examined by AFM and the results are shown in Fig. 5. There are ring-shaped convex contact marks on the electrolyte surface (Fig. 5e), and the formation of these rings is attributed to the cation interdiffusion between LSM and YSZ during the LSM electrode pre-sintering process.28 The morphology of these rings does not change significantly by anodic polarization for 36 and 100 h, though the width of rings increases slightly with the increase of polarization time (Fig. 5a and b). By contrast, the cathodic operation has a profound effect on the contact rings. In the case of single 36 h-anodic/12 h-cathodic polarization, the ring areas became rough with increased contact marks (Fig. 5c). After 4 cycles of anodic/cathodic polarization, the areas within the contact rings are fully filled by the contact marks (indicated by the circle, Fig. 5d). The AFM phase micrographs also show that there are very few variations in the phases of the electrolyte surface after polarization treatment (Fig. S1, ESI†). Nevertheless, the substantial topographical change of the convex contact rings indicates that cyclic anodic/cathodic polarization has a significant effect on the electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

The electrolyte surface in contact with the as-prepared electrode is shown in (e). 
To elucidate the effect of cathodic polarization on the microstructure at the electrode/electrolyte interface, the LSM/YSZ interface was examined after the first cyclic 20 h-anodic/20 h-cathodic polarization at 500 mA cm−2 and 800 °C. In contrast to the intimate contact at the electrode/electrolyte interface for the as-prepared LSM electrode (Fig. 6g), dramatic microstructural changes occur in the electrode/electrolyte interface region after anodic polarization for 20 h. There is formation of a thin layer of 30–45 nm thickness on the YSZ electrolyte (indicated by the arrow ①, Fig. 6a) and micropores in the size range of 50–450 nm within the LSM grains close to the electrolyte (indicated by the arrow ②, Fig. 6a). The electrode is connected to the electrolyte via pole-like particles (indicated by the arrow ③, Fig. 6a). After the removal of the LSM electrode, NPs distribute discretely within the contact ring areas (Fig. 6c), which may be related to the thin layer adhering to the electrolyte as observed in Fig. 6a. On the LSM surface in contact with the electrolyte there are micropores and nanoparticles and larger irregularly shaped particles with characteristics of fracturing (Fig. 6e).
 Fig. 6  SEM micrographs of (a and b) cross sections of the electrode/electrolyte interface, (c and d) electrolyte surface and (e and f) LSM inner surface in contact with the electrolyte, after anodic polarization at 500 mA cm−2 and 800 °C for 20 h (left) and after 20 h-anodic/20 h-cathodic polarization (right). Arrows ①, ② and ③ point to the NPs on the contact rings, micropores and remaining LSM particles in contact with the electrolyte, respectively. The as-prepared LSM electrode is shown in (g). The scale bar is 200 nm for (a–f) and 1 μm for (g). 
On the other hand, there is a change in the microstructure after subsequent cathodic polarization for 20 h. The thin layer on the electrolyte grows to 50–80 nm in thickness and the interfacial contact is enhanced with reduced pores and increased pole contacts (Fig. 6b). The pore size is reduced to 100–200 nm. The ring areas on the electrolyte surface are filled with closely packed NPs (Fig. 6d) and the LSM inner surface becomes less rough (Fig. 6f). This demonstrates the enhancement effect of cathodic polarization on the contact at the interface, consistent with the substantial decrease in RE and RΩ of the LSM oxygen electrodes after cathodic polarization, as shown above.
The LSM electrodes after 20 h-anodic polarization and 20 h-anodic/20 h-cathodic polarization were cut and milled into lamellae by FIB-SEM and the elemental EDS maps are shown in Fig. 7. The EDS maps display no distinct variation of elemental redistribution at the electrode/electrolyte interface. This indicates that the change in the microstructure at the interface is not attributed to elemental redistribution.

The appearance of Sr on the YSZ side is attributed to the overlap of Sr and Y (Zr) signals. The scale bar is 1.5 μm for (a) and 0.5 μm for (b). 

Fig. 8 shows the cross-section of the LSM samples prepared using mechanical and FIB milling methods after 20 h-anodic polarization and cyclic 20 h-anodic and 20 h-cathodic polarization at 500 mA cm−2 and 800 °C. After 20 h-anodic polarization, distinctive cracks were observed in the electrolyte at the vicinity of the electrode/electrolyte interface of the samples prepared by the mechanical polishing process as well as the FIB milling process (Fig. 8a and c). These microcracks still remain after operation in the SOFC mode of 20 h-cathodic polarization (Fig. 8b and d), indicating that microcracks formed during anodic polarization in SOEC mode could not be repaired or eliminated by subsequent cathodic polarization. This indicates that the structural deterioration or damage of the YSZ electrolyte such as microcracks or nanosized pores by anodic polarization in the SOEC mode may not be healed or regenerated by subsequent cathodic polarization. Nevertheless, more systematic investigations are needed for the fundamental understanding of the microstructure deterioration and behaviour under the reversible SOEC and SOFC operating conditions.

Cracks on the YSZ electrolytes close to the interface region are indicated by the arrows. 
3.3 Cathodic polarization induced electrode/electrolyte interface
The above results demonstrate that the deteriorated electrode activity and the electrode/electrolyte interface in the anodic polarization regimes can be reversed and recovered by subsequent cathodic polarization operations. To fundamentally understand the reversibility of SOCs, we employed novel in situ assembled LSM electrodes without pre-sintering to study the effect of cathodic polarization on the formation of the electrode/electrolyte interface.

Fig. 9 shows the polarization curves of the in situ assembled LSM electrodes at 800 °C and different current densities. The initial RΩ and RE are 2.2 and 136 Ω cm2, respectively (Fig. 9a), much higher than ∼0.5 and 8.5 Ω cm2 of the pre-sintered LSM electrodes (Fig. 1). The very high RΩ and RE is a clear indication of poor contact between LSM particles and the poor LSM/YSZ interface of the in situ assembled and un-sintered LSM. However, RΩ and RE decrease rapidly after applying a cathodic polarization current. After cathodic polarization at 200 mA cm−2 for 15 min, RΩ and RE decrease substantially to 1.3 and 4.7 Ω cm2, respectively. A similar trend is also observed at higher currents of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9b and c). In contrast, the electrode behaviour is very different under anodic polarization at 500 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9d). After applying an anodic polarization current, RE is more or less the same initially in the first 2 h and increases slightly with further anodic polarization, reaching ∼105 Ω cm2 at the end of the test. RΩ increases gradually from 2.0 to 5.1 Ω cm2 after polarization for 12 h. This clearly indicates that cathodic polarization substantially enhances the electrocatalytic activity of the in situ assembled LSM electrodes, while anodic polarization has the opposite effect on the activity of the in situ assembled LSM electrodes (Fig. 9e and f).
 Fig. 9  Polarization curves as a function of current passage time for in situ assembled LSM oxygen electrodes at 800 °C, under cathodic currents of (a) 200 mA cm−2, (b) 500 mA cm−2, (c) 1000 mA cm−2, and (d) under anodic current of 500 mA cm−2. The change of RE and RΩ as a function of cathodic and anodic polarization current is summarized in (e and f). 
The electrolyte surface in contact with the in situ assembled LSM electrodes was treated by HCl solution to remove the LSM and the electrolyte surface was characterized by AFM. For the electrode without polarization, the electrolyte surface is clean and smooth (Fig. 10e). On the other hand, the electrolyte surface becomes uneven and there is formation of contact marks and the size and number of contact marks increase with the increase of current density (Fig. 10a–c and also refer to Fig. S2 for larger areas and Fig. S3 for topography and phase images, ESI†). After cathodic polarization at 200 mA cm−2 for 12 h, the distribution of contact marks is symmetrical and the average size of the marks is 147 ± 42 nm (Fig. 10f), while after polarization at a high current of 1000 mA cm−2, the size of the contact marks is in the range of 100 to 400 nm with peaks at 130, 221, and 313 nm. The average size is 213 ± 73 nm (Fig. 10g). However, the size of the contact marks is much smaller than 1.15 ± 0.33 μm of the convex contact rings in the case of pre-sintered LSM electrodes (Fig. 5). Much smaller contact marks are most likely due to the fine particles of un-sintered LSM (Fig. S4, ESI†). The occurrence of the contact marks indicates the formation of the interface between the LSM particles and the YSZ electrolyte under the influence of cathodic polarization.24 The three phase boundary (TPB) length of the electrochemically induced interface could be estimated by measuring the length of contact marks. For example, after cathodic polarization at 200 mA cm−2 for 12 h and 1000 mA cm−2 for 4 h, the TPB is 4.20 and 7.27 μm μm−2, respectively. The higher TPB length of the in situ assembled LSM electrode after cathodic polarization at 1000 mA cm−2 for 8 h explains its lower RE values of 1.56 Ω cm−2 (Fig. 9f). The cathodic polarization induced interface is in excellent agreement with the substantial reduction of RΩ and RE of the in situ assembled LSM (Fig. 9a–c). On the other hand, the AFM micrograph shows very few or no contact marks on the YSZ electrolyte surface in contact with in situ assembled LSM after anodic polarization (Fig. 10d), consistent with the detrimental effect of anodic polarization on the electrochemical activity of the in situ assembled LSM (Fig. 9d).

The YSZ electrolyte without cathodic polarization is shown in (e). The LSM electrodes were removed by HCl treatment. Histograms of the contact marks after cathodic polarization at 200 mA cm−2 for 12 h and 1000 mA cm−2 for 4 h are shown in (f and g), respectively. 
3.4 Fundamental reasons for the reversibility of SOCs
As shown by Hughes et al.23 and Graves et al.5 and also in this study, high temperature solid oxide cells can be reversibly operated in the SOEC mode for hydrogen production and in the SOFC mode for electricity generation. By appropriately adjusting the anodic/cathodic polarization regime, the electrochemical activity of a SOC can be completely reversible, i.e., the significantly deteriorated RΩ and RE of LSM oxygen electrodes for the O2 evolution reaction in the SOEC mode can be recovered partially or completely by subsequent operation in the SOFC mode for the O2 reduction reaction. As evidently demonstrated by the change of the electrode/electrolyte interface under the cyclic test and most significantly by the formation of the electrode/electrolyte interface under cathodic polarization on the in situ assembled LSM, the fundamental reasons for the reversibility of the electrode ohmic and polarization resistances of the LSM oxygen electrodes in anodic/cathodic polarization regimes are the self-healing and regeneration of the deteriorated LSM electrode/YSZ electrolyte interface in the SOFC mode as shown below:  
A good and intimate electrode/electrolyte interface is vital for the electrochemical reaction on the LSM oxygen electrode for both OER and ORR, as LSM is predominantly an electronic conductor with negligible ionic conductivity. For the pre-sintered LSM electrodes, the electrode reaction occurs primarily at the LSM/YSZ interface, i.e., the convex contact rings formed on the electrolyte surface (Fig. 6).29,30 This is indicated by the changes of the morphology of the convex contact rings under both cathodic and anodic polarization and the electrochemically induced morphological change is most likely due to the incorporation of oxygen and/or cation interdiffusion such as Mn between LSM and YSZ.30,31 However, very different to the case of pre-sintered LSM electrodes, there is no intimate contact between LSM and YSZ in the case of in situ assembled LSM electrodes. This is indicated by the very high RE and RΩ values before cathodic polarization (see Fig. 9). After applying a cathodic current, both RE and RΩ decrease remarkably, indicating the formation of an intimate electrode/electrolyte interface. The AFM analysis of the YSZ electrolyte surface also evidently shows the formation of contact marks, i.e., the interface, induced by cathodic polarization, consistent with the most recent study of the in situ assembled LSM and LSCF electrodes.24 Backhaus-Ricoult et al. reported the diffusion of manganese oxide out of the LSM electrode onto the YSZ electrolyte surface under the influence of cathodic polarization.32 Thus Mn dissolution into YSZ under the cathodic conditions could be the reason for the formation of contact marks, as shown in Fig. 10a–c.
Thus, under the cyclic anodic/cathodic polarization conditions, the deteriorated LSM/YSZ interface under anodic polarization (indicated by the significant increase in RΩ and gap formation) can be self-repaired and regenerated under subsequent cathodic polarization, as shown schematically in Fig. 11. The cathodic polarization regenerated interface is supported by a significant reduction in RΩ and the formation of contact marks within the convex contact rings of the pre-sintered LSM electrodes, and is also independently demonstrated on the in situ assembled LSM electrodes. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism for the electrochemically induced interface is not clear at this stage and needs more detailed and high resolution microstructure and element analysis.

4 Conclusions
In this study, the performance and microstructure of LSM oxygen electrodes are investigated under cyclic SOEC and SOFC operating conditions. The electrocatalytic activity of LSM electrodes and the contact at the electrode/electrolyte interface were deteriorated in the SOEC mode for the OER, indicated by the significant increase in RΩ and RE. However, the deteriorated electrocatalytic activity of the LSM oxygen electrode can be partially or completely reversed and recovered in the subsequent SOFC mode for the ORR, indicated by the significant reduction of both RΩ and RE values. Fundamentally, such remarkable reversibility of SOCs is due to the self-healing and regeneration of the LSM/YSZ interface under cathodic polarization conditions. The incorporation of oxygen and/or cation interdiffusion such as Mn between LSM and YSZ by cathodic polarization most likely contribute to the formation of the electrode/electrolyte interface, leading to the substantial reduction of contact ohmic resistance and enhancement of electrode activity. The present study lays a solid foundation for the development of truly reversible and stable SOCs for the hydrogen fuel and electricity generation in cyclic SOEC and SOFC operation modes.
