    , Accepted 27th October 2020First published on 28th October 2020AbstractSeawater is the most plentiful natural resource we have on earth and new research is looking at seawater as an alternative to freshwater for hydrogen production by electrolysis. However, the selective electrochemical anodic oxygen evolution reaction from seawater is challenging because of the competitive chloride oxidation reaction as well as anodic corrosion. Here we report an FeOOH deposited β-Ni–Co hydroxide as a new active material with an outer graphene oxide layer, which works effectively for selective overall alkaline natural seawater splitting, which requires very low cell voltages of 1.57 and 2.02 V to reach current densities of 20 mA cm−2 and 1000 mA cm−2, respectively, at 27 °C. Importantly, this electrolyzer shows exceptional stability for more than 378 h at a current density of 1 A cm−2. This discovery can be generalized with other reported unstable OER/HER seawater splitting electrocatalysts, which can significantly progress the expansion of seawater electrolysis for extensive hydrogen production.
1. Introduction
The hydrogen economy concept is a potential future scenario meant for battling climate change and securing energy for planet earth, in which a water electrolyzer combined with a renewable energy source may one day generate a plentiful amount of chemically bound or molecular hydrogen as primary or intermediate energy vectors.1–3 Over past years, several inexpensive water electrolyzers with electrolytes containing freshwater have been developed, and some have achieved performances even better than those of benchmark iridium oxide (IrO2) or platinum (Pt) catalysts.4–7 However, there will be a massive strain on freshwater resources if we run large-scale freshwater electrolysis. Seawater is an inexhaustible water resource we have on our planet, as among the entire world's water resources, around 96.5% is present in the sea.8 Using direct seawater electrolysis instead of freshwater could solve the freshwater scarcity problem, especially for arid desert zones, as direct seawater electrolysis technology not only stores green energy in the form of hydrogen but can also produce fresh drinking water.9
However, implementation of seawater splitting is highly challenging, particularly for the anodic reaction as compared to the cathodic side. The chemistry of the cathodic catalyst material seems straightforward, mainly because the electrochemical deposition thermodynamic potentials of different seawater ions or the thermodynamic potentials of its competing reactions are not as close as for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and chlorine evolution reaction (CER).8 So far, so many HER electrocatalysts have been developed for seawater splitting.10–13 But very few have been reported for selective seawater oxidation.8 The biggest obstacle in seawater splitting is anodic side reactions, like chlorine ion oxidation, which occurs due to the existence of chloride anions (∼0.5 M) in seawater, and which mainly competes with the OER.8,14 OER is a four-electron oxidation process, which involves a reaction pathway with a minimum of two or three intermediates.14 It is thus fundamentally more difficult than CER which is a kinetically fast reaction as it requires only a two-electron transfer process with ostensibly one catalytic intermediate.8 According to the Pourbaix diagram for artificial saline water (0.5 M NaCl solution), over the entire pH range, chloride ion oxidation is thermodynamically less favorable than the water oxidation reaction.15 It also shows that at high pH (pH > 7.5),15 thermodynamically OER is highly selective within an overpotential window of 480 mV. More importantly, hypochlorite formation (Cl− + 2OH− → ClO− + H2O + 2e−) is a dominant competitive anodic reaction at high pH along with the OER. In the pH range from 7.5 to 14, the standard potentials for hypochlorite formation and OER, at parallel scales, result in a standard potential difference of . So developing an electrocatalyst that can generate an industrial current density (1 A cm−2) below a 480 mV overpotential for alkaline seawater splitting is essential, which is one of the ways to avoid anodic chlorine oxidation reactions. Another approach for selective OER over chorine oxidation is to develop a protective layer on the surface of the active sites of the anode material, and this was found to be an effective way for a selective OER reaction over CER. For example, Vos and co-workers proved that putting an MnOx layer on the surface of IrO2 can effectively improve the efficiency of OER over CER. The MnOx layer acts as a sieve that disfavors the transport of chloride ions.16 However, such materials are unable to generate high current density at low cell voltage, leading to a decrease in electrolyzer efficiency because the OER-inactive MnOx layer blocks the OER-active sites as well as developing additional resistance. Along with this, an Mn oxide placed on IrO2–Ti also showed excellent durability for OER in a saline electrolyte, but the high cost of Ir limits its use on an industrial scale.17,18 An Ni–Fe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH),19,20 Co phosphate, and Co-borate catalyst has been also been reported for high OER activity in NaCl containing electrolyte, but long-term durability at an industrial current density of ∼1 A cm−2 has not been achieved for seawater electrolysis.15,21,22 Recently, Kuang et al. developed an Ni–Fe LDH electrode with in situ-generated polyatomic sulfate and carbonate-rich passivating layers. Such a negatively charged sulfate and carbonate layer can repel chloride and effectively improved the corrosion resistance of the salt-water-splitting anode at an industrial current density (1 A cm−2).16 Without such a protective layer, the Ni–Fe LDH anode is very unstable at an industrial current density. Yu et al. also reported that by doping S in Ni/Fe hydroxide, stable seawater oxidation is possible.23 So, a more general model needs to be developed to improve the stability of the anode against chloride corrosion at an industrial current density. More importantly, for industrial implementation of such electrocatalyst, its synthesis methods must be cost-effective and straightforward.
Considering the need for a highly stable catalyst, which can sustain a high current density for seawater splitting, herein, we report a multilayered GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF electrode as a 3D-form anode catalyst, which yields large current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of 303 and 345 mV, respectively, for OER in simulated alkaline seawater at 25 °C. For superior chlorine corrosion-resistance, we designed the introduction of a graphene oxide overlayer on the catalyst active sites as an interfacial membrane between the Fe@Ni–Co@NF electrode and seawater, and in-depth studies show that graphene oxide is responsible for the superior chlorine corrosion-resistance of the anode. An outstanding two-electrode alkaline seawater electrolyzer using GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF for both anode and cathode has subsequently been fabricated, where 20 mA cm−2 and 1000 mA cm−2 (industrial current densities) can be achieved at low cell voltages of 1.59 and 1.99 V, respectively, at 25 °C with stability that lasts for more than 378 h in simulated alkaline seawater. This work provides a unique approach for improving anodic lifetime at high current density (1000 mA cm−2) in seawater, and this discovery can be generalized with other reported unstable OER/HER seawater splitting electrocatalysts, which can significantly progress the expansion of seawater electrolysis for extensive hydrogen production.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization of catalyst
A multilayered electrode was developed in this work, and a schematic presentation of the electrode synthesis is presented in Fig. 1a, where commercial Ni foam is used as a conductive support due to its decent electrical conductivity and 3D porous architecture.24 Mixed Ni–Co hydroxide was first synthesized using the hydrothermal method by controlling metal hydroxide growth using a metal-chelate complex (Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows SEM images of Ni–Co hydroxide on Ni foam synthesized with 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, and 8 h hydrothermal time intervals. As depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†), after 2 h, the formation of a micro-rod array can be seen on the surface of the Ni foam. As the hydrothermal reaction time increases, secondary growth of petal-like Ni–Co hydroxide takes place (4 h); such a rod-like structure with the surface formed by petals can effectively improve the active surface area of the catalyst, which is very crucial for generating a high current density for OER/HER. However, when the hydrothermal time increases to more than 4 h, additional precipitation of Ni–Co hydroxide occurs, which blocks the 3D network of the Ni foam. So 4 h hydrothermal samples were used for the next experiments. The successful formation of the Ni–Co hydroxide phase was confirmed by XRD data (Fig. S4, ESI†), which shows the formation of the β mixed Ni–Co hydroxide phase.25 The approximate atomic ratio of Co:Ni is 1:0.12, which was confirmed by SEM-EDS measurements (Fig. S5, ESI†). A transition metal-based layered double hydroxide has been considered a promising candidate as a high-performance electrocatalyst for HER and OER. However, at the same time, there is a significant obstacle to the use of LDH based catalysts because of its semiconductor properties, which could lead to more massive resistance that adds an additional overpotential to drive HER/OER. Hybridizing transition metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide with metal oxide/metal alloy was proven to be an effective way to improve catalytic activity for water splitting.26–28 Most previous work shows a multi-step process to develop such metal oxide/metal (oxy)hydroxide,26 metal alloy/metal oxyhydroxide27 interface materials. But here, by merely controlling the annealing temperature under an inert atmosphere, we have developed a mixed-phase metal hydroxide/metal oxide catalyst. To optimize the annealing temperature, we undertook in situ XRD measurement during the annealing of the Ni–Co-hydroxide (4 h) sample under vacuum conditions in the temperature range 26 °C to 500 °C. As depicted in Fig. S4 (ESI†), after 250 °C the metal oxide phase starts to form, and as the temperature increases, the metal oxide phase becomes dominant. To achieve both metal hydroxide and metal oxide phases, the Ni–Co hydroxide sample was annealed at 300 °C under an Ar atmosphere for 2 h (Ni–Co@NF), and analysis was undertaken by TEM and XRD measurements. TEM analysis of Ni–Co@NF confirms that the outer layer of micro-rods remains as a metal hydroxide layer (Fig. S6, ESI†), while XRD confirms the presence of metal oxide and metal hydroxide phases (Fig. S10, ESI†). The advantage of such a metal hydroxide/metal oxide structure can be seen in the catalytic performance for OER in alkaline seawater. As can be seen in Fig. S9a (ESI†), the OER performance of the Ni–Co@NF catalyst is much higher than for metal oxide (Ni–Co3O4@NF) or metal hydroxide (Ni–Co hydroxide@NF) catalysts. Next, graphene oxide (GO) and FeOOH were electrodeposited on the Ni–Co@NF electrode for 500 s (for electrodeposition time optimization see Fig. S7a–d, S8 and S9b, ESI†) and the resulting electrode was named GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF. Here, we choose a graphene oxide overlayer on the catalyst surface as a protective layer against chloride corrosion, as a graphene oxide membrane is well known for the desalination process,29–32 and it can also diffuse gas molecules.33,34 To show the advantages of a graphene oxide overlayer on the catalyst surface, for comparison, 500 s electrodeposited FeOOH on Ni–Co@NF was also synthesized and named Fe@Ni–Co@NF.

Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ni–Co@NF, Fe@Ni–Co@NF, GO@Ni–Co@NF, and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalysts. The XRD pattern of Ni–Co@NF confirms the formation of a mixed metal hydroxide and metal oxide phase. In the case of Fe@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF materials, a peak corresponding to FeOOH is not detected because of the small size of FeOOH nanoparticles. Fig. 1 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Ni–Co@NF, Fe@Ni–Co@NF, and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalysts. From the TEM image of Ni–Co@NF (Fig. 1d), it can be seen that ultrathin sheets cover the micro-rod-like structure. The layered structure of Ni–Co hydroxide can be seen in the HR-TEM of the Ni–Co@NF catalyst (Fig. S6a, ESI†), in which an interlayer spacing of 0.474 nm is observed, which is consistent with the XRD results. Further, TEM-EDS elemental mapping confirms the uniform distribution of all elements (Fig. S6b and c, ESI†). In the case of Fe@Ni–Co@NF material, the uniform deposition of FeOOH nanoparticles with an average diameter of ∼7–9 nm can be seen in Fig. 1i on the surface of the Ni–Co sheets. Interestingly, in the case of the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst, the size of the FeOOH nanoparticles on the Ni–Co sheets was found to be much smaller (∼2 to 4 nm) (Fig. 1m). The reduced size of FeOOH is possibly because of the GO layer, which may limit the permeation of Fe ions toward Ni–Co sheets during electrodeposition.29,35 TEM elemental mapping of the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst (Fig. 1n) further confirms the uniform distribution of FeOOH nanoparticles on the Ni–Co sheets. SEM images of GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF (Fig. 1j), confirm the uniform coating of GO on the Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst. The chemical composition and the surface element state of the catalysts were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Fig. S11 (ESI†) shows the XPS survey spectra, demonstrating the presence of Ni, Co, and O in Ni–Co@NF; Ni, Co, Fe, O in Fe@Ni–Co@NF; and Ni, Co, Fe, C, O in the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst. In the high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectra of the Fe@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalysts, a positive shift in binding energy was observed compared to the Ni–Co@NF catalyst, (Fig. 2a, d, and g, Ni–Co@NF Co 2p3/2 = 780.47 eV, Fe@Ni–Co@NF Co 2p3/2 = 781.42 eV, GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF Co 2p3/2 = 782.31 eV) which indicates the strong electronic interactions between FeOOH and Ni–Co hydroxide. The oxidation of Co2+ in the Ni–Co LDH could be promoted effectively by the highly oxidative interfacial Fe(3+δ)+ species from the unsaturated FeOOH NPs. No shift in Ni 2p binding energy was observed in the case of the Fe@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalysts, which indicates that the growth of FeOOH is mostly on the side of Co(II) (Fig. 2i), leading to the formation of interfacial oxygen bridges, such as Fe–O–Co couples on the interface of FeOOH and Ni–Co hydroxide. Also, the Co 2p shift is higher in the case of the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst compared to Fe@Ni–Co@NF. As TEM analysis showed (Fig. 1i and m), the FeOOH particle size is smaller in GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF (∼2 to 4 nm) than Fe@Ni–Co@NF (∼7 to 9 nm). With a decrease in FeOOH nanoparticle size, the surface atoms and degree of unsaturation ratio increase, which leads to a stronger interfacial interaction between Ni–Co hydroxide and FeOOH NP, resulting in a more pronounced synergistic catalytic effect toward OER electrocatalysis.

2.2. Oxygen evolution catalysis testing in simulated alkaline seawater
The OER performances of all catalyst materials were measured in an alkaline simulated seawater electrolyte (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl) using a three-electrode configuration. Firstly, the OER performances of four different electrodes, namely Ni–Co@NF, GO@Ni–Co@NF, Fe@Ni–Co@NF, and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF, were measured in simulated alkaline seawater. The catalyst was first stabilized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a 50 mV s−1 scan rate in the potential window of 0 to 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, then the LSV experiments were conducted at a scan rate 2 mV s−1. The Ni–Co@NF and Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalysts were without a graphene oxide coating, whereas the GO@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF had a graphene oxide overlayer. For comparison, we chose 50 mA cm−2 current density, mainly because the current density of metal redox peaks is much higher because of the high specific capacitance of β-Ni–Co hydroxide based materials,36 As depicted in the LSV plot in Fig. 3a, the Ni–Co@NF and Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalysts reach a current density of 50 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of 313 mV and 246 mV, respectively, and to reach 500 mA cm−2, they required 401 mV and 312 mV overpotentials. It should be noted that the Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst required a very low overpotential of 0.336 mV to reach an industrial current density (1000 mA cm−2). Interestingly with a graphene oxide overlayer, both electrocatalysts GO@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF show slightly better performance than the electrodes without a GO overlayer. For a GO@Ni–Co@NF catalyst to reach 50 and 500 mA cm−2 current densities requires 307 mV and 398 mV, and for a GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF electrode to reach 50 and 500 mA cm−2 current densities requires 247 mV and 303 mV overpotentials, respectively. Both GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF and Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalysts reach the desired industrial faradaic current density (1000 mA cm−2) below a 480 mV overpotential, which means chloride oxidation is thermodynamically not possible on either catalyst surface according to the Pourbaix diagram.9 It should be noted that after the introduction of FeOOH into Ni–Co@NF the OER activity is significantly enhanced. Fe species at the interface together with Ni and Co hydroxide are critical for achieving high levels of O2 production.37 As seen in the Co 2p XPS spectra of the Fe@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Fe@Ni–Co2NF catalysts (Fig. 2a, d and g), the Co sites are electronically modified by Fe atoms, resulting in much enhanced OER activity compared to bare Ni–CO@NF. Along with this, a slight contribution from GO was also observed toward OER activity enhancement. The Ni–Co@NF and Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalysts show charge transfer resistances (RCT) of 3.18 and 2.81 Ω, respectively (Fig. S12, ESI†), and after the introduction of GO we can see decreases in the RCT values for both materials. For Go@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF the RCT are 2.74 and 2.01 Ω. This observation shows that after introducing the GO layer, the electrical conductivity of the catalyst is enhanced.38,39 Furthermore, the OER activity of the screened catalyst at an overpotential of 260 mV was compared with and without the GO layer, and Ni–Co@NF, and Fe@Ni–Co@NF reached current densities of 17.16 and 59.57 mA cm−2, respectively. Whereas at a 260 mV overpotential the GO@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalysts reached current densities of 19.26 and 90.65 mA cm−2, respectively. These results show that GO also contributes to OER activity enhancement by improving electrical conductivity. The LSV curve of GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF is noisy, and we did not try to smooth the plot. The noise was generated during the bursting of oxygen gas bubbles at high current density (Fig. 3a, Movie S1†). The generated molecular oxygen (O2) can be efficiently released from the Fe@Ni–Co@NF electrode surfaces because of its extremely good 3D porous network. In the Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst, the FeOOH is super-hydrophilic, and diatomic O2 is hydrophobic. So FeOOH prefers to make a hydrogen bond with water or OH− electrolyte and after O2 formation, their interaction is very weak as O2 is hydrophobic in nature. So, O2 easily detaches from the FeOOH and makes way for the reactant.40 However, in the case of the GO-overlayered catalysts (GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Ni–Co@NF), the generated O2 bubbles may block the active catalyst surface and make such a noise in LSV measurement.34,41 In the case of the Ni–Co@NF catalyst, the catalyst surface is less hydrophilic than FeOOH, leading to difficulty in detaching hydrophobic O2 from the catalyst surface. Such a generated O2 bubble blocks the active site, which leads to noise formation in LSV measurement. Fig. 3b shows the Tafel plots of the corresponding catalysts; the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst has a comparatively smaller Tafel slope of 59 mV dec−1 compared to Fe@Ni–Co@NF (105 mV dec−1), Ni–Co@NF (103 mV dec−1), or GO@Ni–Co@NF (94 mV dec−1) catalysts, which verifies the rapid OER catalytic kinetics on the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF surface. As can be seen in the LSV curve (Fig. 3a), the graphene oxide makes little contribution to OER activity. Since with or without a GO overlayer the OER performance of Ni–Co@NF is similar, here the OER active sites are the same, and after introducing GO, there are no changes on the catalyst side, which is the reason the Tafel slopes of Ni–Co@NF and GO@Ni–Co@NF are much closer. However, in the case of the Fe@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalysts, there is a much greater difference in the Tafel slopes of both catalysts. As observed in TEM measurement, the FeOOH nanoparticle size in the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst is smaller (2–4 nm) than in Fe@Ni–Co@NF (7–9 nm). The synergy effect of FeOOH nanoparticles and Ni–Co hydroxide is dependent on the nanoparticle size of FeOOH, and the synergy effect increases as the FeOOH size decreases, leading to a strong interaction between FeOOH and Ni–Co hydroxide, which results in rapid OER catalytic kinetics on the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF surface. A similar observation was reported in previous work,42 where Chen et al. reported FeOOH NPs on α-phase Ni–Fe LDH,42 whereas our catalyst has FeOOH nanoparticles on β-phase Ni–Co LDH. Here, we carefully chose β-phase metal hydroxide (interlayer spacing < 4.74 Å), which has a much lower interlayer spacing than the α-phase (>8.0 Å). The smaller interlayer spacing reduces the intercalation of chloride ions during water oxidation in the chloride-containing electrolyte, which is vital to improving chloride corrosion resistance against seawater oxidation. The turnover frequency (TOF) for GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF was calculated by using the electrochemically active surface area (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†) at different overpotentials. The TOFs at 260, 303, and 345 mV overpotential are 0.02, 0.10, and 0.21 s−1, respectively.

As to concern over the probable chloride oxidation on the anode surface, during constant current OER testing, the gaseous product generated over the anode was collected and the composition of the sampled gas was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) (1 h CP at 1000 mA cm−2 current density). The GC spectra shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†) suggest that only O2 is a detectable gas-phase product formed on the Fe@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF electrode surfaces. Moreover, the presence of a liquid phase chloride oxidation product (HClO/ClO−) was examined using an o-tolidine test, during long-term seawater electrolysis.14,43 In neither the Fe@Ni–Co@NF nor the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF case was any HClO or ClO− formation observed in the o-tolidine test. (Fig. S16g, ESI†). The anode stability for seawater electrolysis at an industrial current density is crucial for practical application.8 Generally, at a high current density, the anode is highly positively polarized, which increases the attraction of chloride ions to the anode surface that can cause electrode corrosion, leading to a decrease in the electrolyzer performance.44 So, the catalyst durability for OER in simulated alkaline seawater was tested using chronopotentiometry (CP) at an industrial current density (1000 mA cm−2). Fig. 3c shows the CP plots of Fe@Ni–Co@NF and GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalysts at a current density of 1000 mA cm−2, for 12 h in simulated alkaline seawater. We can see the advantages of a GO overlayer here, as the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst is very stable under such harsh conditions, and no evident corrosion or voltage increase were observed. The LSV plots after a 12 h stability test show the catalysts are highly stable in reaching 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 current densities; which require just 293 and 318 mV overpotentials (Fig. 3d). This small negative shift in potential is possibly caused by the generation of a microporous pathway on the catalyst surface during O2 evolution, which can increase the exposure of a number of active catalytic sites for OER. In contrast, from the CP plot of the Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst (Fig. 3c), it can be seen that it is unstable under such harsh conditions for seawater oxidation, as increasing voltage was observed with increasing time. The LSV analysis of the Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst after a 12 h CP test shows that reaching 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 densities required high overpotentials of 393 and 494 mV, respectively (Fig. 3d). The decrease in OER performance is possibly caused by corrosion of the anode surface at high positive polarization,9 leading to the leaching of active metal in the electrolyte,20,24 ICP-OES analysis was used to check the dissolved metal ion concentration in the electrolyte after the 12 h of CP test (Table S3†). In the case of the Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst, the dissolved ion concentrations of Co, Ni, and Fe were 0.0391 ppm, 0.0015 ppm, and 0.0293 ppm, respectively, whereas in the case of the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF electrode, the dissolved Co, Ni metal ion concentrations in the electrolyte were found to be very low (Table S3†). These results strongly indicate that by putting a graphene oxide overlayer on the catalyst surface, we can effectively improve the corrosion resistivity of the anode against seawater. Further, after the stability test, a postmortem analysis of both GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF and Fe@Ni–Co@NF electrodes was done by FE-SEM and EDS. (A detailed postmortem analysis of the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF anode was done after a long-term stability test in a 2 electrode system.) Fig. S17 (ESI†) shows the FE-SEM, EDS, and elemental mapping images of the Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst after a 12 h CP test, where the catalyst surface can be seen as rough, which is caused by corrosion. In the case of the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst, removal of the extra graphene oxide layer from some part of the catalyst surface was observed (Fig. S18a, ESI†). The high-resolution EDS mapping of the selected area (Fig. S18a′, b′ and c′, ESI†) shows the residual carbon layer on the surface of the catalyst. These results show that by putting a GO overlayer on the OER catalyst surface (Fig. 3e and f) seawater oxidation can occur efficiently without chloride corrosion at a high current density.
2.3. Overall seawater splitting
As Ni–Fe,45,46 Ni–Co,47 and Fe–Co48 based LDH materials show high HER performance, we decided to use the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst as an HER catalyst rather than using the reported catalyst. Fig. S19 (ESI†) shows the HER LSV plot of the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst in simulated alkaline seawater, and it shows that GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF was also a suitable HER catalyst, as to reach ∼10 mA cm−2 current density required only 150 mV overpotential. Considering the outstanding catalytic performance of the GO@Fe@Ni–Co hydroxide catalyst for HER and OER in simulated alkaline seawater, the overall seawater splitting performance was further investigated by integrating the two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer (without a membrane or diaphragm), in which we used GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF as both cathode and anode, and the electrolyzer performance was measured at 25 °C and 60 °C using different electrolyte feeds (1 M KOH, 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 M KOH + real seawater). Remarkably, this electrolyzer displays outstanding overall water splitting performance in all the electrolyte systems (Fig. S20, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4a, at room temperature (25 °C) in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl, the cell voltages needed to generate 20, 500, and 1000 mA cm−2 current densities are as low as 1.59, 1.91, and 1.99 V, respectively (Fig. 4a). In alkaline natural seawater (1 M KOH + seawater), the electrolyzer performance is slightly lower but still impressive. As to delivering 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 current densities, it required only 1.94 and 2.02 V cell voltages (Fig. 4b). The slight decrease in activity in 1 M KOH + seawater may be due to some insoluble precipitates formed on the electrode [e.g., Mg(OH)2 or Ca(OH)2] covering the surface of the electrode during seawater electrolysis, and thus burying some surface active sites.24 After seawater electrolysis, several new metal elements, including Mg, K, and Ca, were observed on the electrode surface in the EDX spectra which come from the seawater (Fig. S21, ESI†). The artificial and natural alkaline seawater electrolyzer performances were further tested at 60 °C; 20, 500, and 1000 mA cm−2 current densities were achieved at 1.30, 1.80, and 1.84 V cell voltages, respectively, in artificial alkaline seawater. The natural alkaline seawater electrolyzer required 1.36, 1.82, and 1.85 V cell voltages to reach 20, 500, and 1000 mA cm−2 current densities at 60 °C, respectively (Fig. 4b). But our electrolyzer performance is slightly lower than for a recently reported metal nitride-based electrolyzer (NiMoN and NiMoN@NiFeN as the cathode and anode).24 Nevertheless, if a GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF anode is paired with an NiMonN cathode, the electrolyzer performance could possibly improve further. However, the GO@Fe@NiCo@NF(+)//GO@Fe@NiCo@NF(−) electrolyzer performance is better than that of most previously reported electrolyzers in 1 M KOH electrolyte, such as the benchmark of Pt/C(−)//IrO2(+) electrolyzer, or earth-abundant metal catalyst based electrolyzers.49,50

(a) Polarization curves and (b) comparison of the required voltages at current densities of 500, and 1000 mA cm−2 for the Go@Fe@NiCo@NF(+)//Go@Fe@NiCo@NF(−) electrolyzer in different electrolytes.

(d) Polarization curves (initial and after 378 h CP test at 1000 mA cm−2 density in simulated alkaline seawater). (e) Electrolyte volume decrease as a function of time (total electrolyte volume 75 mL). 
The long-term durability of a seawater electrolyzer at an industrial current density is crucial for practical application. The GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF(+)//GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF(−) electrolyzer durability was tested in alkaline artificial seawater (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl), as shown in Fig. 4c, and this electrolyzer can show outstanding stability for overall seawater splitting with no noticeable degradation over 378 h operation observed at an industrial current density (1000 mA cm−2). After the stability test the LSV spectra were recorded (Fig. 4d), in which a slight increase in electrolyzer performance was observed at high current density. The enhanced performance is possibly because of the improved microporous channels through the carbon layer during H2/O2 gas release in a high current density stability test, which improves the electrolyte contact to active sites. The Nyquist plots before and after the stability test also show an improvement in the charge transfer rate, which can result in a slight increase in activity at high current density (Fig. S22, ESI†). A decrease in electrolyte volume can be seen with increasing electrolysis time (Fig. 4e) because of the rapid conversion of H2O into O2 and H2 (Movie S1†). The decrease in cell voltage as a function of time at 1000 mA cm−2 current density is mainly because of the decrease in solution resistance (Fig. S22, ESI†). No chloride oxidation product is found in the electrolyte in the o-tolidine test even after the 378 h stability test. This confirms that OER is the only reaction that takes place on the anode surface. After 378 h of testing, the amount of dissolved metal ions in the electrolyte was analyzed by ICP-OES (Table S5, ESI†). The dissolved metal ion concentration was found to be very low, as the amounts of Co, Ni, and Fe were 0.0104 ppm, 0.0051 ppm, and 0.0332 ppm, respectively. This result shows that both anode and cathode electrodes show excellent corrosion resistivity against alkaline seawater under such harsh conditions. Further, the postmortem analysis of both cathode and anode was done by Raman, FE-SEM, EDS, TEM, and XPS spectroscopy. Fig. 5a shows the Raman spectra of the as-synthesized GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF electrode. The characteristic D and G bands of graphene oxide can be seen at 1339 and 1588 cm−1, respectively.51 The two bands centered at 458 and 523 cm−1 are associated with Ni–OH/Co–OH and Ni–O/Co–O stretching modes in LDH, respectively.42,52,53 The FeOOH/LDH composite displays additional characteristic bands at 594 and 658 cm−1.42 After 370 h of continuous electrolyzer testing, no significant changes were observed in the Raman spectra of the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF cathode electrode (Fig. 5c). As depicted in Fig. 5c, the fingerprint Raman D and G bands of graphene are still present at 1347 and 1588 cm−1. On the cathode side, the GO layer acts as a sieve, which effectively blocks Cl− and Na+ ions and allowing HO− ion and H2 gas penetration (Fig. S23, ESI†). The two-dimensional graphene oxide (GO) stacking sheets function as a sieving membrane,32 and this has been used effectively for the desalination process.30 The water molecules can permeate through the interconnected nanochannels formed between the GO nanosheets of the membrane.33 If the interlayer spacing of GO is between ∼0.3 and 0.7 nm, any molecule or ion with a hydrated radius of 0.45 nm or less could permeate through the nanochannel, while it blocks larger-sized species. Hence, H2 gas and OH− ions can easily permeate through the GO membrane because of their small diameters,34 without disturbing the outer GO layer on the HER active sites (Fig. S23, ESI†). The FE-SEM image of the cathode also shows that no significant change was taking place on the catalyst surface, as the GO layer was still present even after 378 h of testing at 1000 mA cm−2 current density (Fig. 5d). Elemental mapping further confirms the good distribution of all metals on the catalyst surface. (Fig. S24, ESI†). In contrast, in the Raman spectra of the anode (after 378 h of testing at 1000 mA cm−2 current density), tremendous changes were observed. The peak corresponding to FeOOH and Ni–Co hydroxide becomes broad, centered at 515 cm−1 (Fig. 5e). This change possibly happens because of the partial dissolution of FeOOH in KOH electrolyte during OER and the formation of an amorphous mixed metal oxyhydroxide film on the catalyst surface during OER.54 The formation of the amorphous metal oxyhydroxide was further confirmed by TEM analysis (Fig. S25, ESI†). Along with these changes, a new Raman peak appeared around 1225 cm−1, showing that the nature of the carbon becomes amorphous.55 A peak at 1432 cm−1 shows the deformation vibration modes of the O–H groups,56,57 which confirms the higher oxidization of graphene oxide during water oxidation. The intensity of the graphene fingerprint D and G band peaks was also found to be low. The decreasing intensity of the G and D bands was possibly because of the removal of unattached GO films from the catalyst surface, which can be seen in Fig. 5f. Another reason is the partial oxidation of graphene oxide at high potential, leading to the formation of a residual amorphous carbon layer on the catalyst surface,58 which was further confirmed by XPS analysis and SEM elemental mapping. Elemental mapping of the anode after the stability test confirms that a uniform carbon layer is present on the catalyst surface (Fig. S26, ESI†). Fig. S27 (ESI†) shows the C 1s XPS spectra pre and post (378 h) seawater testing for the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF anode. As we can see, there are two broad peaks centered at 284 eV and 288.27 eV, which correspond to sp2 C and CO groups. The presence of a broad 288.27 eV peak confirms that the carbon is functionalized with carboxylate groups.59 These observations show that the in situ-generated highly oxidized carbon, as well as the GO layer on the Fe@Ni–Co surface, acts as a barrier against chloride ions reaching active metal sites, and it simultaneously permeates the OER intermediate as well as oxygen molecules, leading to very excellent durability of the anode for seawater oxidation.

In a real-time seawater electrolysis operation, if seawater is supplied continuously to the system, salt will possibly accumulate in the electrolyte, because water is converted to H2 and O2. Considering this possible scenario, we calculated the faradaic efficiency (FE) of H2 and O2 in highly concentrated NaCl solution (1 M KOH + 1 M NaCl) (Fig. S28, ESI†). The FE of the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst for H2 and O2 was measured using a three-electrode configuration by collecting the generated gaseous products over the working electrode (Fig. S28c, ESI†). As depicted in Fig. S28a, b,† only O2 and H2 gases with a molar ratio close to 1:2 are identified, even at a very high concentration of NaCl (1 M). The faradic efficiency is determined to be around ∼99 and ∼97% for H2 and O2, respectively, at 200 mA cm−2 current density. This result proves the high selectivity for OER on the anode and HER at the cathode. A combined photo-electrolysis system is an effective way to generate hydrogen using a carbon-free energy source. To demonstrate this, a commercial Si solar cell was employed (with a power conversion efficiency of 26.53%, Fig. S29†) with an electrolyzer (GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF as anode and cathode, Fig. 6a). The combined system confirmed spontaneous H2 and O2 evolution under simulated 1.5G solar irradiation at room temperature (Video S2†). As shown in Fig. 6b, from the crossing of the LSV curve of the electrolysis device and the solar cell J–V curve, the expected operational current density of the photolysis system (16.7 mA cm−2) was estimated. The recorded current density under chopped simulated solar illumination is 16.70 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6c), which represents a solar to hydrogen efficiency of 20.3% for alkaline seawater splitting.

2.4. Generalization of concept with other metal hydroxide OER catalysts
To show the broad view of this concept for improving the stability of the anode for alkaline seawater oxidation at higher current density, we synthesized NiFeOxHy layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) on nickel foam, one of the most active OER electrocatalysts.4,20,27,60 Furthermore, the graphene oxide overlayer was electrodeposited on it (Fig. S30, ESI†). The electrodes are named NiFe-LDH@NF and GO-NiFe-LDH@NF, respectively. We chose NiFe-LDH because previous work showed its low stability at higher current density in alkaline seawater mainly because of electrode corrosion.20 The OER performance of both electrodes was tested in extremely harsh conditions (1 M KOH + 2 M NaCl, a 4 times higher concentration of salt than real seawater) using a three electrode assembly (Fig. 7a). The NiFeLDH@NF without a graphene oxide overlayer lasted for less than 270 min at 400 mA cm−2 current density (applied voltage 1.745 V vs. RHE) (Fig. 7b). This observation shows good agreement with a previous report.20 As chloride anion intercalation in α-NiFe LDH interlayer easily takes place during OER applied potential,61,62 which leads to the dissolution of Ni and Fe metal sites, causing the sudden drop in the OER activity. In contrast, the NiFe-LDH with a graphene oxide overlayer show excellent stability at 420 mA cm−2 (applied voltage 1.695 V vs. RHE), as it loses just 10 mA current density (Fig. 7b) even after 720 min. The graphene oxide overlayer blocks the chloride ion contacts with the active metal site as well as its intercalation during OER. FE-SEM and Raman spectroscopy were done for the postmortem analysis of both electrodes after stability tests. The GO-NiFe-LDH@NF electrode maintained its 3D foam network similar to that before the OER test (Fig. 7c), but the NiFe-LDH@NF electrode showed severe corrosion as the 3D network of the electrode was destroyed after a 720 min test (Fig. 7d). The surface-sensitive Raman analysis gives further information about the effect of seawater oxidation on the surface structure of NiFe-LDH catalysts at higher current density. As can be seen in Fig. 8, before OER measurements both NiFe-LDH and GO-NiFe-LDH show the characteristic peaks of NiFe-LDH at 301.50, 468.82, 543.25, 689.8 cm−1 at 532 nm excitation (Fig. 8a), which agree with the previously reported peaks in the Ni–Fe system.63–65 And two additional peaks at 1343.46 and 1588.68 cm−1 for the fingerprint Raman D and G bands of graphene in the GO-NiFe-LDH catalyst were also seen. After the OER stability test, the complete disappearance of the NiFe-LDH peak can be seen in both catalysts (Fig. 8b), and two new peaks were observed. In GO@NiFe-LDH similar behavior to the GO@Fe@NiCo@NF anode was observed, where the 1233.47 and 1432.42 cm−1 peaks show the formation of highly oxidized carbon along with the presence of D and G band signals of GO. Moreover, the peaks at 472.2, 554.39 cm−1 for the Ni–O vibration of NiOOH,66 and the peak at 686.6 cm−1 show the formation of FeOOH species. In NiFe-LDH, two peaks centered at 472.82 and 543.77 cm−1 were associated with Ni–O vibration in NiOOH.66 The negative shift in the 543.77 cm−1 peaks compared to the 554.39 cm−1 peaks is possibly because of the formation of a disordered structure during the corrosion process. These results clearly show that by putting a graphene oxide overlayer on the OER catalyst surface, long-term stability of the anode against chloride corrosion is achievable at industrial current density. One more observation to be noted is that NiFe-LDH@NF shows a much decreased OER stability in seawater compared to the Fe@Ni–Co@NF electrode. The NiFe-LDH we used here is an α-phase metal hydroxide with an interlayer spacing of more than 8.0 Å, whereas the Ni–Co LDH in Fe@Ni–Co@NF is a β-phase metal hydroxide with an interlayer distance of 4.74 Å. A higher interlayer spacing can increase chloride anion intercalation during the OER process,61 resulting in a much higher degree of chloride corrosion. That is also one of the reasons why an α-metal hydroxide shows much lower seawater oxidation durability compared to a β-metal hydroxide. In the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF electrode, the β-phase metal hydroxide improves the chloride corrosion resistance, which also contributes to its superior stability during seawater electrolysis.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF bifunctional active and stable catalyst for overall alkaline seawater splitting. For OER catalysis, this catalyst requires very low overpotentials of 303 and 345 mV to deliver large current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2, respectively, in alkaline seawater at 25 °C. The synergy effect between interfacial FeOOH NP and Ni–Co hydroxide 2D sheets effectively lowers the OER overpotentials and, at the same time, the metal oxide layer underneath helps to lower the charge transfer resistance of the catalyst, leading to the generation of high current density at low OER overpotential. The lower interlayer distance of β-Ni-Co LDH, the GO overlayer, and in situ-generated oxidized carbon layer effectively improve the chloride corrosion resistance of the anode during seawater oxidation. Notably, the GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF catalyst also shows excellent HER activity in alkaline seawater. Hence, we have built a GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF(+)//GO@Fe@Ni–Co@NF(−) alkaline seawater electrolyzer, which exhibits very low cell voltages of 1.57 and 2.02 V to reach current densities of 20 mA cm−2 and 1000 mA cm−2, respectively, in natural alkaline seawater at 25 °C. Most importantly, this electrolyzer showed supreme durability for alkaline seawater splitting at an industrial current density, as no noticeable activity drop was detected after up to 378 h of stability testing. This discovery can be generalized with other reported unstable OER/HER electrocatalysts for stable seawater splitting. Hence, we believe this work provides a meaningful opportunity for economical and practical hydrogen production by vast seawater splitting.
