    , Accepted 16th June 2019First published on 17th June 2019AbstractIn this study, I-deficient BiOI is subjected to heterostructural design by coupling with SrTiO3 (BiOI/SrTiO3, BS) or modification with (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) to enhance the photocatalytic and catalytic activity, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and elemental analyses demonstrated the presence of I− vacancies in BiOI, which acted as electron traps in the photocatalytic reaction, and the absence of Lewis basic sites in the catalytic CO2 reaction to limit the conversion efficiency. After modification, the BS composite exhibited high activity for photocatalytic methyl orange decoloration under visible light irradiation because of facile charge separation resulting from the I− vacancies of BiOI and the intimate heterojunction at the BiOI/SrTiO3 interface. On the other hand, modification of BiOI with APTMS could greatly strengthen the Lewis basicity to enhance the catalytic CO2-to-polycarbonate (PC) conversion activity. In summary, I− vacancies play a vital role in determining the activity of I-deficient BiOI both in photocatalysis and catalysis. Hence, I-deficient BiOI would be a facile catalyst and upon a certain degree of modification, may find promising applications in photocatalysis and catalysis for CO2 conversion and environmental remediation.
Introduction
Bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI), a stable compound with ns2 valence electrons, has a band gap (Eg) of approximately 2.0 eV and can serve as an effective light absorber for photoconversion.1–6 A theoretical study has shown that the valence band of BiOI consists of overlapping Bi 6s, O 2p, and I 2p states, with the stacking of [Bi2O2]2+ layers, and the I− ions intercalated between the slabs.7,8 BiOI has fascinating electrical, optical, and mechanical properties and shows an anisotropic structure because of its weak interlayer van der Waals interactions and strong intralayer bonding.9 Therefore, BiOI is considered to be a promising candidate for catalysis and photocatalysis, including ionic liquid-modified BiOI that can trap photoexcited electrons to prevent recombination,10 oxygen-deficient and vacancy-rich BiOI that contributes to shifting the onset of light absorption and generates more charge carriers to improve the photocatalytic activity,11–13 and vacancy-rich BiOI that exhibits a photothermal synergistic ability to oxidize formaldehyde.13 Oxygen vacancies promote the absorption of H2O, because of the resulting low coordination to provide coordinatively unsaturated sites for the chemisorption of other species. Therefore, the introduction of various vacancies into BiOI results in generating reactive oxygen species, thus improving the photocatalytic activity13 and alternatively changing its chemical and physical properties.
Severe pollution due to organic dyes can also be addressed by using heterogeneous catalysts, and therefore, these catalysts have garnered significant technical and scientific attention in recent years.14–22 BiOI, with its internal electrostatic field between the [Bi2O2]2+ layers and I− ions, favors photoexcited charge separation to improve the photocatalytic activity. In addition, BiOI is an efficient visible-light absorber that can be incorporated with many materials, including carbon-based compounds (reduced graphene oxide,23,24 graphene,25 carbon quantum dots,26 and g-C3N4 (ref. 27 and 28)) and bismuth-based materials (BiOBr, Bi4O5I2, Bi7O9I3, BiOxIy, and Bi5O7I).29–35 Among the numerous metal oxide semiconductors, SrTiO3, a perovskite ABO3 material with a cubic structure and Pmm symmetry,36,37 is a promising candidate for use in solar-driven photocatalytic reactions owing to its high thermal stability, low cost, and anti-photochemical corrosion properties.38,39 However, SrTiO3 has a wide Eg of approximately 3.2 eV and can be activated only by UV light with a wavelength smaller than 400 nm, which strongly restricts its practical photoelectrochemical applications.40,41 Nevertheless, the high chemical stability of SrTiO3 is advantageous for its use as a basis for coupling, doping, and introduction of other compounds. Coupling of SrTiO3 with BiOI effectively facilitates charge separation, suppresses the formation of trap states, and prevents heavy metal contamination by foreign dopants, thus improving the photocatalytic activity of BiOI.
Apart from the issue of water pollution, it is vital to develop a novel material for the utilization, reduction, and catalytic conversion of the greenhouse gas CO2 with epoxides to form cyclic carbonates. Heterogeneous catalysts with dual Lewis acidic and basic sites play an important role.42 Metal oxides such as ZnO,43 ZrO2,44 and Al2O3 (ref. 45) are promising catalysts in CO2/epoxide cycloaddition reactions. However, the selectivity and yield of cyclic carbonates using the above metal oxide catalysts are poor due to the absence of Lewis basic sites. Consequently, basic co-catalysts or solvents, including dimethylformamide (DMF)46 and tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB, n-Bu4Br),47 are used in CO2/epoxide cycloaddition reactions to increase the catalytic performance. On the other hand, Lewis basic catalysts such as MgO (ref. 48) and CaO (ref. 49) have been used in CO2/epoxide cycloaddition reactions and show low epoxide conversion and poor yields owing to the lack of Lewis acidic sites. The development of a heterogeneous catalyst with dual Lewis acidic and basic sites is thus crucial for CO2/epoxide cycloaddition reactions. BiOI is an excellent candidate as a heterogeneous catalyst in CO2/epoxide cycloaddition reactions because of its dual acidic ([Bi2O2]2+ layers) and basic (I− ions) properties. To the best of our knowledge, the dual acidic and basic BiOI has not been used as a catalyst in CO2/epoxide cycloaddition reactions. The critical issue of CO2 emissions is expected to be addressed economically and in an environmentally friendly manner through these cycloaddition reactions.
In this regard, BiOI is subjected to heterostructural design to prepare photocatalysts and catalysts, including BiOI/SrTiO3 composite and APTMS-modified BiOI samples. BiOI was synthesized and decorated on SrTiO3 as a composite by microwave-assisted solvothermal methods at 150 °C within a relatively short reaction time (15 min). I− deficiency in BiOI and Bi-doping at Sr sites in the SrTiO3 lattice through these vacancies were determined, and BiOI/SrTiO3 composites exhibited a high photocatalytic decoloration activity against methyl orange (MO) dye under visible light irradiation. Moreover, over 99% catalytic CO2/propylene oxide (PO) conversion has been achieved by using I-deficient BiOI with the addition of TBAB as a cocatalyst or modification with APTMS to increase its Lewis basicity. Our results strongly suggested that the photocatalytic and catalytic activities of BiOI could be improved through rational design of SrTiO3 coupling and APTMS modification with BiOI. This is the first study to report the correlation between the enhancement of the photocatalytic and catalytic performance and the I− deficient nature of BiOI.
Experimental section
BiOI was synthesized through a microwave-assisted solvothermal method in this study. A certain amount of Bi(NO3)3 (Alfa Aesar, USA) was dissolved in ethylene glycol (Alfa Aesar, USA), which was followed by the addition of potassium iodide with continuous stirring. The mixing solution was named solution A. After homogeneous mixing, solution A was treated in a microwave reactor at 150 °C for 15 min at a constant power (700 W). After filtration and drying, the resulting sample was denoted as B15.
To couple BiOI with the as-synthesized SrTiO3 (named SS), which was prepared through a conventional solid-state method analogous to that in a previous report,41 the SrTiO3 sample was added to solution A. Identical to the BiOI synthesis process, the solution was hydrothermally treated in a microwave reactor at 150 °C for 15 min at a constant power (700 W). The composite was named 0.8BS15, where 0.8 is the mole ratio of BiOI to SrTiO3, and 15 indicates the reaction time (15 min). On the other hand, to increase the number of Lewis basic sites of the BiOI catalyst (B15), TBAB (0.14 g) was added to the autoclave as a cocatalyst or it was subjected to modification with APTMS. These samples were named APTMS-B15 or B15/TBAB, accordingly.
The crystalline structure of the specimens was identified using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Bruker D8 advance, USA) at 2-theta angles of 10–70° with a scan rate of 6° min−1. The surface morphologies and microstructures of the specimens were investigated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM; Hitachi H-7100, Japan) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-4800 N, Japan). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the samples were determined at −196 °C using an adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics ASAP 2020, USA), and the specific surface areas were estimated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; VG Scientific ESCALAB 250, Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis, UK) with Al Kα radiation was carried out to determine the electron binding energy of the products by C 1s (284.8 eV) calibration. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopic analysis was used to examine the optical properties using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrometer (Hitachi U-3900, Japan). Zeta potentials were measured using a zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer 3000 HSa, Malvern, United Kingdom). The catalytic CO2 conversion, selectivity and yield obtained using the catalysts were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR, Bruker AVIII-400(B662), USA). A temperature-programmed desorption analyzer (TPD; AutoChem 2920, Micromeritics, USA) was used to evaluate the Lewis basic or acid sites of the obtained samples in a CO2 or NH3 atmosphere under ambient pressure. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 400 °C (ramp rate of 2 °C min−1).
Photocatalytic reactions were performed using 0.04 g of the composites suspended in 50 mL of MO dye (1.22 × 10−4 M) by employing a magnetic stirrer in a reactor cell made of Pyrex glass. The light source was a 250 W metal halide lamp. An optical filter with a cut-off wavelength of 400 nm was used to block the UV irradiation (Fig. S1, ESI†). Before light irradiation, the solution containing the photocatalyst was stirred in the dark using a magnetic stirrer to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The decoloration rate was determined by measuring the absorbance at 464 nm using the UV-vis spectrometer.
Conversion of PO (1.2 g) and CO2 to propylene carbonate (PC) was carried out using 0.2 g of BiOI catalysts in a 25 ml stainless steel autoclave with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm. The stainless-steel autoclave was pressurized with CO2 to 10 kg cm−2 and heated to a constant temperature of 180 °C. After the reaction, the autoclave reactor was cooled to room temperature and the suspension was centrifuged for NMR analysis.
Results and discussion
BiOI, with a layered structure consisting of I− ions intercalated between the [Bi2O2]2+ slabs, can be considered to be a promising material as a photocatalyst to degrade organic dye and as a catalyst to convert CO2 to PC. In this regard, pristine BiOI (B15) was coupled with SrTiO3 and modified with APTMS to evaluate its photocatalytic activity for MO decoloration under visible light irradiation and catalytic CO2 conversion efficiency (Fig. 1), respectively. For photocatalysis (Fig. 1a), the adsorption–desorption equilibrium of MO on the photocatalysts was achieved in the dark for at least 1 h prior to irradiation. MO decoloration without a catalyst was also tested to prove that photolysis is negligible. In the pristine samples, B15 shows a much higher activity than SS. In terms of the BiOI/SrTiO3 composites, the 0.8BS15 sample has the highest photocatalytic activity, completely decolorizing MO within 180 min, while 0.2BS15 shows the lowest activity among these composites (Fig. S2a, ESI†). In addition, the MO adsorption using the B15 sample in the dark is shown in Fig. S2a,† indicating that the decoloration is triggered by the photocatalyst and light irradiation. The surface chargeability of the materials may be responsible for the contact with, adsorption of, and reaction with dye molecules. The inset of Fig. 1a shows the zeta potentials of B15, 0.8BS15, SS, and MO, revealing that SS repulses MO, whereas the samples that had experienced BiOI coupling attract MO molecules to achieve charge neutrality. The positively charged surface of BiOI can be ascribed to the Bi3+ ions on its exposed (012) plane; on the other hand, SS has a negative zeta potential owing to its surface-adsorbed OH− sites, which can be evidenced by XRD and XPS analysis, as shown in the following section.

Inset of (a) shows the zeta potentials of B15, 0.8BS15, SS, and MO aqueous solution. 
Generally, the pseudo first-order reaction kinetic model is used to describe the photocatalytic decoloration as follows:50,51ln(C/C0) = −kapptwhere C and C0 are the concentration of MO at time t and the initial concentration at time t0, respectively, kapp is the pseudo first-order rate constant (min−1) and t is the reaction time (min). The pseudo first-order kinetic model fitted well with the experimental data, with a regression coefficient (R2) > 0.995 for all the samples. The kapp values were calculated and are displayed in Fig. S2b,† demonstrating that 0.8BS15 has the highest kapp (0.02 min−1), which is approximately 2.2 times that of pristine BiOI (B15, 0.0093 min−1) and 380 times that of SS (5.3 × 10−5 min−1). The rate constants of MO decoloration using BiOI-based compounds in the literature52–84 are summarized in Table 1. The rate at which 0.8BS15 decolorizes the highest concentration of MO (40 mg L−1) is clearly greater than those values reported from experiments under visible light irradiation (>400 nm), demonstrating that 0.8BS15 can serve as an effective photocatalyst. These MO molecules are mainly attacked by the photoexcited holes and superoxide radicals generated by light irradiation through BiOI and SrTiO3, which has been reported in our previous study.22 As a result, these BiOI/SrTiO3 composites exhibited greater activities compared to individual BiOI and SrTiO3. The structural stability of a material is also an important factor, and the XRD patterns of 0.8BS15 before and after the photocatalytic reaction are shown in Fig. S3.† The relative peak intensities and peak positions do not change, and no secondary phases were found, implying that these samples are highly stable and remain unchanged after the photocatalytic reaction. For further application of BiOI as a coupled material, a BiOI/TiO2 composite was used to photocatalytically decolorize MO under identical conditions. Fig. S4† shows that the BiOI/TiO2 composite exhibited a higher activity for MO decoloration than TiO2 alone, proving that BiOI can be a fascinating material for coupling with a wide-band-gap semiconductor for photocatalytic reactions.

In terms of catalytic CO2/PC cycloaddition reactions, not only B15 but also B15/TBAB and APTMS-B15 were used to measure the catalytic conversion, selectivity, and yield (Fig. 1b). The PO conversion and PC selectivity and yield using the B15 catalyst are 92.7, 70.5 and 65.4%, respectively, which are higher than the values obtained using other metal oxide catalysts.14–18 Moreover, the PC selectivity (92.3%) and yield (92%) are greatly enhanced with the addition of the basic cocatalyst TBAB, implying that the Lewis basic sites are not sufficient for the use of the as-prepared B15 catalysts in the CO2/PO cycloaddition reactions although BiOI is a bifunctional catalyst with dual acidic ([Bi2O2]2+ layers) and basic (I− ions) sites. The decreased basic strength of BiOI can be attributed to the presence of I− vacancies in the as-prepared B15. Consequently, the basic strength of I-deficient BiOI can be improved by the surface grafting of the basic amine-terminated modifier APTMS. Similarly, the PC selectivity and yield are increased to 86.5 and 82.6% using the APTMS-B15 catalyst. Therefore, BiOI can be an efficient catalyst after the addition of a Lewis basic cocatalyst in the CO2/PO conversion reaction.
TPD results of B15 and APTMS-B15 samples in a CO2 and NH3 atmosphere under ambient pressure are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Compared with the B15 sample in the absence of APTMS modification, there is an obvious peak in TPD analysis at approximately 300 °C for the APTMS-B15 sample in a CO2 (Fig. 2a) and NH3 (Fig. 2b) atmosphere, indicating that both the basic and acidic sites of the BiOI sample are increased after APTMS modification. The basic strength of the I-deficient BiOI is indeed increased by surface grafting of the basic amine-terminated APTMS. Surprisingly, the acidic intensity of the I-deficient BiOI is also enhanced when using the basic APTMS modifier. The reason for both the increased basic and acidic sites of the APTMS-B15 sample will be discussed later in detail. The inset of Fig. 2a shows the possible catalytic conversion mechanism of CO2/PO using the APTMS-B15 sample. Generally, anions with high nucleophilicity and leaving ability, such as I−, Br−, and N3−, promote the catalytic activity of the binary catalyst system.85 In our system, B15 exhibited low activity for CO2 conversion, while the APTMS-B15 sample showed a dramatic improvement to produce PC. This result suggested that the presence of APTMS and the [Bi2O2]2+ layer in the APTMS-B15 sample can give the bifunctionalities of basicity and acidity, which are essential to the activation of epoxide and CO2, with the opening of the epoxide ring. The epoxide is activated by the [Bi2O2]2+ layer, which serves as a Lewis acidic site, while the activation of CO2 is generally initiated by the nucleophilic attack of –NH2 groups of APTMS, thus facilitating the ring-opening of the epoxide, followed by the formation of polycarbonate. As a result, APTMS-B15 is an effective catalyst, and its bifunctionality is essential for triggering the catalytic conversion for PC production.

The temperature was increased from room temperature to 400 °C (ramp rate of 2 °C min−1). Inset of (a) shows the schematic diagram of the proposed mechanism for CO2/epoxide cycloaddition reaction. 
The structural features and morphologies of B15, 0.8BS15, and APTMS-B15 samples are clarified in the SEM images in Fig. 3. B15 exhibited a uniform circular shape consisting of multiple nanoflower aggregates, which mainly results from the continuous and uniform microwave irradiation (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b shows a pristine SS sample, which shows a cube-like configuration with a particle size of 0.5–1 μm. With increasing BiOI content, BiOI coupled samples can be clearly distinguished from the SrTiO3 sample, and gradually the nanoflower coverage on SrTiO3 increases (Fig. S5†). A steady microwave-assisted treatment (0.8BS15) leads to homogeneous crystal growth and regular nanoplate stacking, forming a coral reef structure, which implies high crystallinity. The 0.8BS15 sample was completely covered by BiOI (Fig. 3c), indicating that the photocatalytic reaction may occur on the surface of BiOI. Fig. 3d shows the appearance of APTMS-B15, revealing the destruction of BiOI and the conversion of B15 to a flat-sheet-stacked configuration.

Elemental analyses of the samples with increasing BiOI contents, shown in Fig. S6,† revealed that Sr/Ti ratios are nearly identical, while the I content is much lower than the Bi content in all the samples, demonstrating that BiOI exhibits many I− vacancies. These I− vacancies may act as traps that capture photoexcited electrons to improve the photocatalytic activity.86 Additionally, the presence of abundant I− vacancies also indicated the lack of Lewis basic sites to limit the CO2/PO conversion using BiOI. Therefore, these I− vacancies, exposed planes, and the crystallinity of BiOI play a major role in governing the photocatalytic and catalytic performance because of the direct contact of the vacancies with the reactants.
The microstructures, d-spacing, and electron diffraction spots of B15 and 0.8BS15 were investigated using HR-TEM and the fast-Fourier transform method (Fig. 4). The plate-like structure of BiOI and the cube-like SrTiO3 with diameters of approximately 200 nm can be viewed in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The ordered d-spacing of 0.276 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of tetragonal BiOI, is shown in the left inset of Fig. 4a, while the right inset of Fig. 4a shows the diffraction spots of the (012) and (002) planes of BiOI with a d-spacing of approximately 0.30 and 0.46 nm, respectively. This result identified a high-quality single-crystal feature and the formation of BiOI. In Fig. 3b, a transparent plate-like BiOI material surrounded and covered the SrTiO3 particles, which is consistent with the above SEM analysis. A magnification of the dashed circle in Fig. 4b is shown in the inset. The lattice fringes were measured to have a lattice spacing of 0.328 nm, matching well with the (012) plane of tetragonal BiOI. Additionally, the electron diffraction patterns in the right inset of Fig. 4b show clear spots corresponding to the (110), (012), and (100) planes of BiOI and SrTiO3. This result suggests that the preferred exposed plane in the BiOI sample is (012).

The XRD patterns of B15, 0.8BS15, APTMS-B15 and SS samples used to determine their crystalline structures are shown in Fig. 5. In B15 and SS samples, all the diffraction peaks can be clearly indexed to tetragonal BiOI (ICSD 29145) and cubic SrTiO3 (ICSD 23076), in which no secondary phases are observed. The diffraction peaks at 29.7° and 31.8°, which can be assigned to the (012) and (110) planes of BiOI, increase in intensity with increasing BiOI content (0.8BS15, 1BS15, and B15; see Fig. S7 in the ESI†); meanwhile, the intensity of diffraction peaks at approximately 32.2°, which represent the (110) plane of SrTiO3, decreases with a simultaneous increase in IBiOI(012)/ISrTiO3(110) (Table S1†), indicating the coupling of BiOI with SrTiO3 particles. In the APTMS-B15 sample, the characteristic peaks of BiOI remained mostly unchanged. The intensity of the peak at approximately 12° of APTMS-B15 decreased slightly, and would be discussed in the next section.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of B15, APTMS-BS15, 0.8BS15 and SS samples. The standard XRD patterns of BiOI (ICSD 29145) and SrTiO3 (ICSD 23076) are displayed at the top and bottom parts of the figure. 
A further detailed inspection of the patterns at the 2-theta position reveals peaks from approximately 28° to 32° for the (012) and (110) planes of BiOI and from approximately 31.5° to 33.5° for the (110) plane of SrTiO3, and these patterns are shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6a, the peaks of B15 and 0.8BS15 samples at 28.8° and 31.4° shift to higher values, 29° and 31.7°, respectively. These shifts can be attributed to the deficiency of I− ions, which are situated between the [Bi2O2]2+ interlayered slabs, resulting in crystal shrinkage along these directions and reduction in the lattice constant. This acts as concrete evidence in order to prove the presence of I− vacancies in the BiOI sample. Moreover, the observed diffraction peaks at approximately 32.3°, which are assigned to the (110) plane of SrTiO3 (Fig. 6b), shift toward higher 2-theta values with increasing BiOI content. This shift can be explained by the substitution of Sr2+ with Bi3+; the radius of Bi3+ (0.117 nm)87 is smaller than that of Sr2+ (0.144 nm),88 and therefore the substitution of the larger ion, Sr2+, with the smaller ion, Bi3+, reduces the lattice constant, which corresponds to the shift of the diffraction peaks toward higher 2-theta values (Fig. S8†). As a result, the peaks that shifted are strongly associated with the I− deficiency that causes the structural changes, including lattice shrinkage and Bi-doping, on SrTiO3. On the other hand, after the modification of BiOI with APTMS to strengthen its basicity, the XRD peak at approximately 12° decreased slightly (Fig. 6c), implying that APTMS grafting may disrupt the crystalline structure and reduce the periodic ordering of BiOI along the c-axis as shown in Fig. 6d. In this regard, the favorable exposed (012) plane of BiOI with I− vacancies may cause Bi3+ to be preferably exposed, thus creating a positive surface charge, which corresponds to the zeta potential measurement as shown in the inset of Fig. 1a and TEM analysis (Fig. 4b). After the modification of BiOI with APTMS, the reactive species including CO2 and propylene oxide could easily adsorb onto the APTMS and [Bi2O2]2+ slabs, which served as the basic and acidic sites, respectively, to improve the CO2 conversion efficiency. On the other hand, the I− deficiency within the [Bi2O2]2+ slabs could still provide space and stronger internal electrical fields for photogenerated charge separation,12,86 since the electronegativity of I is lower than that of the surrounding O. I− vacancies could also act as traps for the electrons to increase separation efficiency and consequently the photocatalytic activity.

N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and BET equations were employed to further determine the surface properties of B15, 0.8BS15, and SS samples (Fig. 7). Classical type IV isotherms (according to the IUPAC classification) were observed for B15 and 0.8BS15 samples, whereas SS isotherms corresponded to type III. This characteristic type IV isotherm is associated with multilayer adsorption along with capillary condensation in mesoporous materials; on the other hand, SS adsorbed relatively low amounts of N2, giving clear evidence of non-porosity. Additionally, B15 and 0.8BS15 samples exhibit H3-type hysteresis loops, which indicate the formation of slit-like mesopores resulting from the aggregates of plate-like particles, while SS shows negligible hysteresis loop characteristics, confirming its non-porous structure. The inset of Fig. 7a shows a pore size distribution evaluated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the adsorption–desorption isotherms of B15, 0.8BS15, and SS samples. Other than SS, the samples have similar pore size distributions, agreeing with the above analysis. Fig. 7b shows the specific surface area obtained from the BET equation for these samples. Among these specimens, the B15 sample has the highest surface area (26.5 m2 g−1), while SS has the lowest (1.2 m2 g−1), revealing that BiOI coupling may provide more surface-active sites for the photocatalytic reaction. After coupling, the mesoporosity, surface area and the mesopore volume are greater for the BS15 sample than for the pristine SS sample, which is mainly due to the complete coverage by BiOI. Consistent with the above SEM and TEM analysis, the B15 sample composed of nanoplate-like structures reveals high mesoporosity and specific surface area, which provide a greater number of active sites and enable the reactants to penetrate the materials, hence improving the photocatalytic and catalytic activity. Moreover, APTMS-B15 exhibits a smaller specific surface area of 3.03 m2 g−1 compared with B15, which can be attributed to its disrupted sheet-like structure observed in the SEM image (Fig. 3d).

The Eg of a semiconductor is one of the important factors determining its photocatalytic activity. Fig. 8 shows the UV-vis spectra of the B15, 0.8BS15, and SS samples; SS has an absorption edge at approximately 380 nm, while the absorption edge of the pristine B15 sample is at approximately 525 nm. The absorption edge shift in B15 can be ascribed to the presence of I− vacancies, which may change the electronic band structure of BiOI, because the top of the valence band (VB) in BiOI is mainly composed of Bi 6s, O 2p, and I 5p orbitals, while the bottom of the conduction band consists of Bi 6s and Bi 6p orbitals. With the presence of I− vacancies in BiOI, the top of the VB could be shifted down, thereby enlarging the band gap of B15 to ca. 2.3 eV, which is larger than the value of 1.9–2 eV in a previous report.89 When the amount of BiOI increases, the absorption edge monotonically shifts toward longer wavelengths (Fig. S9†). The Eg values of these samples were estimated with the Tauc plot (inset of Fig. 8), revealing that the estimated Eg values from the intercept of the tangents to the curves are 2.1 eV and 3.3 eV for BiOI and SrTiO3, respectively, while the Eg of the 0.8BS15 sample is approximately 2.3 eV. These results clearly indicate that the optical properties and visible light absorption can be altered by changing the molar ratio of BiOI to SrTiO3 for coupling (Fig. S9†). Also, no additional light absorption shoulder is found in the spectra of the BS sample, indicating the absence of a secondary phase. The extension of visible light absorption towards longer wavelengths for the 0.8BS15 sample is partially responsible for the enhancement of photocatalytic decoloration activity.

XPS analysis provides useful information on the chemical bonding and oxidation states of the B15, 0.8BS15, and SS samples that helps to explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity. Fig. 9a shows the survey spectra of these specimens, revealing the presence of Sr, Ti, Bi, I and O elements in the samples. The peaks with binding energies of 621.8 and 632.3 eV are attributed to the spin orbital doublets of I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2,89 respectively (Fig. 9b). Additionally, the I 3d5/2 peak intensity at ∼620 eV in the 0.8BS15 sample is lower than that of the B15 sample, which confirms the I− vacancies shown by XRD and EDS (Fig. 6 and S6†). Fig. 9c shows two peaks, one at 166.6 eV and one at 161.3 eV, for the Bi 4f signal of the B15 sample, representing the Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2 of BiOI,90 respectively. These peaks shift towards lower binding energy (164.5 eV and 159 eV) after the coupling with SrTiO3, suggesting an increase in the number of electrons surrounding the Bi atoms due to the transfer of the outer electrons from the Ti atom in SrTiO3 to the Bi atoms, resulting in a change in the electron cloud density.91 In the typical high-resolution Sr 3d spectra (Fig. 9d), peaks at binding energies of 132.6 eV and 134.5 eV are observed and assigned to Sr 3d5/2 and Sr 3d3/2, respectively.39,92 Ti 2p peaks at binding energies of 458.1 eV and 463.9 eV for SS are the characteristic signals of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 9e).39 Interestingly, the prominent Ti 2p1/2 peak of the 0.8BS15 sample shifts toward higher binding energies by ∼0.5 eV, supporting the idea that doped Bi3+, which has a greater electronegativity than Sr2+ (Bi3+: 2.02 and Sr2+: 0.95), substitutes at the Sr sites and withdraws the electrons that originally surrounded Ti atoms. This result is strong evidence in favor of Sr-site substitution by Bi3+. In the O 1s spectra, Bi–O bonding was represented by peaks at binding energies of 531.6 eV and 530.5 eV, and Ti–O bonding was represented by peaks at 529.88 eV and 529.4 eV, indicating the formation of BiOI and SrTiO3. A small peak at 532.5 eV can be ascribed to surface adsorbed –OH groups. These results demonstrate the presence of I− vacancies in BiOI and Bi-doping at Sr sites in the SrTiO3 lattice, supporting the above analysis. Moreover, this electron transfer within the 0.8BS15 sample is favorable for charge separation and increases the photocatalytic performance.

In summary, when BiOI solvothermally grows through the microwave-assisted method, I− vacancies are generated and act as traps for the photoexcited electrons, increasing the charge separation and hence the photocatalytic activity after coupling with SrTiO3 for highly efficient MO decoloration compared to those of materials reported in the literature (Table 1). Apart from the I− vacancies, Sr2+ ions in the SrTiO3 lattice were subsequently substituted with Bi3+, improving the electron flow through the BiOI/SrTiO3 interface and the photoexcited electron–hole transfer, which also led to effective MO decoloration. Therefore, the high specific surface area, mesoporosity, and favorable exposed (012) plane of I-deficient BiOI on Bi-doped SrTiO3 in the BS sample, which are found in the present work, can greatly promote charge separation and high photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the presence of I− vacancies also limited the CO2/PO conversion, and can be compensated by the addition of TBAB and modification with APTMS as Lewis basic sites to improve the catalytic CO2 conversion efficiency (Fig. 10). The interpretation presented in this work is expected to be utilized for the synthesis of tailor-made I-deficient BiOI via an ultrafast microwave-assisted solvothermal method for both photocatalysis and catalysis applications.

Conclusions
We have synthesized I-deficient BiOI through a rapid microwave-assisted solvothermal method, and the reaction time is only 15 min. I-deficient BiOI was subjected to heterostructural design to improve its photocatalytic activity and CO2 conversion efficiency by coupling with SrTiO3 and modification with APTMS, respectively. On the one hand, the BiOI/SrTiO3 composites exhibited a high MO decoloration rate constant (0.02 min−1), which is approximately 2.2 times that of pristine BiOI (0.0093 min−1) and 380 times that of SS (5.3 × 10−5 min−1). On the other hand, APTMS-BiOI serves as a facile bifunctional catalyst for CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonates with a yield and selectivity of 92.3 and 92%, respectively. Based on structural and chemical state analyses, the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the high specific surface area and effective charge separation resulting from the I− deficiency of BiOI and Bi-doping in the SrTiO3 lattice. Bi-doping in SrTiO3 contributes to the electron flow through the interface of BiOI/SrTiO3, while I− vacancies act as electron traps to increase the generation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. The numbers of Lewis basic and acidic sites of I− deficient BiOI could be increased by grafting APTMS on [Bi2O2]2+ layers, which donated and accepted more electrons for the cycloaddition reaction to produce polypropylene carbonate. In conclusion, I-deficient BiOI can be designed and used as a favorable material for photocatalysis and catalysis to address environmental issues and achieve sustainable, green energy utilization.
