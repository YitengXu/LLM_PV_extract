    , Accepted 21st February 2012First published on 28th February 2012AbstractA combined theoretical and experimental investigation of the electronic structure and optical properties of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), poly[3-(4-octylphenyl)thiophene] (POPT) and poly[3-(4-octylphenoxy)thiophene] (POPOT) is reported. In comparison with P3HT, POPT and POPOT exhibit better stabilities and the presence of an oxygen atom and/or a phenyl ring in the side chains enhances conjugation. Quantum chemical calculations have been performed on oligomers of increasing chain length to establish the changes in the electronic and optical properties when going from P3HT to the new derivative POPOT. The knowledge of the structure of these polymers is of utmost importance in understanding their optical properties in different phases (solution and condensed phase). The calculations indicate that, in opposition to P3HT and POPT polymers where the introduction of alkyl chains and the pendant phenyl disturbs the planarity of the backbone of the conjugated segment, POPOT has a better degree of organization in both states: the conjugated chain remains planar even in the presence of the phenoxy groups. Finally, the exciton binding energy is evaluated for these polymers and allows us to conclude that the POPOT is a promising polymer for photovoltaic applications when compared to P3HT and POPT.
1. Introduction
Conjugated organic polymers are of interest in the field of materials for solid-state electronics1 as they can be solution-processed and because the techniques of synthetic organic chemistry can be employed to generate a large variety of structures.2 These materials are now utilized in several industrial applications such as in photovoltaic cells.3 Recent reviews recall the most significant papers devoted to the study of low band gap polymers for organic photovoltaics.4 One of the most successful organic excitonic solar cells is based on a polymer–fullerene blend.5 In particular, the ∼5% power conversion efficiency reported for a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)–fullerene device was quite encouraging,6 while more recent developments, giving efficiencies greater than 9%, have demonstrated the importance of controlling the band-gap of the polymers utilised. While there could be a number of physical processes limiting the efficiency, the control of electronic and optical properties of the polymer itself is thus of great interest in optimizing device efficiency. So in order to support, or even guide, the synthesis of novel materials with enhanced properties, quantum chemical calculations are increasingly applied, in particular for the prediction of the optical properties of π-conjugated polymers. The optical bandgap is a key parameter that controls, for instance, the efficiency of light absorption in solar cells.7 Therefore it is very important to theoretically study the optical and electronic properties of different oligothiophenes and polythiophenes with a view to designing tailor-made, processable materials.
Based on literature data for P3HT and poly[3-(4-octylphenyl)thiophene] (POPT),8 poly[3-(4-octylphenoxy)thiophene] (POPOT) seems to be a good choice with the purpose of enhancing conjugation and thermal stability. Moreover, the degree of regioregularity in the polymer is of great importance for the characteristics of the polymer such as conductivity and charge carrier mobility.9,10 In the case of P3HT, several reports have investigated the regioregularity and its effects on packing of the polymer.11,12 For photovoltaic applications, substituted polythiophenes should demonstrate a high degree of regioregularity in order to allow a self-organisation of the polymer in the solid state and lead to a maximum of π–π interactions.
In the case of P3HT, the experimental studies are numerous.8a–h Although syntheses by oxidative methods and the characterisation of POPT were already reported in the early 1990s,8h,13 we found that POPTs with reasonable molecular weights and high degrees of regioregularity could be obtained via the Grignard metathesis method (GRIM).14 In addition, to our knowledge, POPOT has not been studied elsewhere in the literature, except by us, where in particular its synthesis based on the GRIM method was found to be the only effective route.15 The experimental data indicate that the absorption spectrum of POPT is largely red-shifted (0.6 eV) in going from the solution to the solid phase while the corresponding shift is only 0.16 eV for POPOT. This difference is not yet fully understood experimentally. The main motivation for this work, using quantum chemical calculations, is therefore to give an explanation to this experimental finding i.e. to determine whether the molecular changes along the polymer backbones are likely to be responsible for the decrease in the red-shift from POPT to POPOT or other possible phenomena are responsible. Furthermore, although some systematic theoretical studies on the electronic properties of these polymers have been reported, especially for P3HT, no attempt has been made to investigate the properties of P3HT, POPT and POPOT, which are among the more useful and representative π-conjugated materials, under identical and comparable conditions. As a consequence, a complete understanding of the structural and electronic peculiarities that control the optical properties of these important polymers has not been achieved yet. In this work, we present a comparative quantum mechanical study based on DFT calculations on a series of discrete oligomers to model an idealized infinite polymer.
The aim of this paper is therefore to establish in a joint experimental and theoretical study the relationship between the structure and properties of these three polythiophene derivatives. The study is focused on the intramolecular effects, since the effect of molecular structure is of primary importance in affecting π-electron conjugation. Substituents can further influence the geometric and electronic structures of these compounds, allowing a fine tuning of the optical properties, where the chemical and sterical nature of different groups determine the inter-ring torsional angles and thereby the absorption wavelengths. The influence of intermolecular interactions on the optical properties of these polymers is also analysed by studying the optical spectra in the solid state.
Because of the reduced symmetry in nonplanar substituted-oligothiophenes, theoretical investigations are computationally more expensive and therefore often restricted to semi-empirical approaches. In this work we employed an ab initio DFT approach to investigate ground-state geometries. The optical spectra of different oligomers are calculated with TDDFT, LC-TDDFT and ZINDO without constraints as performed similarly elsewhere.16
2. Experimental section
The syntheses of POPTs and POPOTs have been previously described and are illustrated in Fig. 1(a).14,15 Polymer molecular weights were estimated against polystyrene standards by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a bank of 4 columns (HR 0.5, 2, 4 and 6®) of 300 mm × 5 μm Styragel at 40 °C, THF eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 controlled by a Waters® 2690 pump, and connected to ERC® INC 7515A refractive index (RI) and Waters 996 multiple wavelength UV-visible photodiode array detectors. 1H NMR 400 MHz spectra were recorded on a Bruker® Avance 400 spectrometer using CDCl3 to determine the degree of regioregularity of polymers. UV-Visible-Near IR absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-21021PC spectrometer either from solution in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or from spin-coated thin films.

3. Computational details
The geometries of the neutral oligomers ranging in size from monomer to octamer (up to 242 atoms for POPOT) were fully optimized with the DFT/6-31G* approach. The DFT method we used is based on Becke's three-parameter exchange functional and the correlation functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr: B3LYP.17,18 The B3LYP functional is currently widely used for studying organic electronic materials because it predicts very reliable geometries.19
No constraints (all atoms in the oligomer are free) were used during the optimization. At the energy minimum, the conjugated backbones of P3HT and POPT are not planar (the torsion angles between two neighbouring rings are greater than 30°) while that in POPOT was planar. In addition to these optimized geometries for all polymers, we assumed coplanar conformations, by keeping the conjugated backbone planar. I.e. in the optimized geometry (for P3HT and POPT) we fixed the torsion angle between two neighbouring rings to zero, as might be imposed by π-delocalization and crystal packing in the films. This is what we termed geometrical constraint (where the main, conjugated segment is planar) in the following text.
The neutral equilibrium geometries obtained with DFT were then used as input for TDDFT to calculate the transition energies of each oligomer. It is very well known that the hybrid functionals, such as B3LYP, underestimate the excitation energies and range-separated functionals have been shown to give both correct HOMO–LUMO gaps and transition energies.20–23 So in this paper, we will compare the accuracy of both methods (B3LYP and LC-BLYP) in predicting the excitation energies for different polymers (P3HT, POPT, and POPOT).
We used the 6-31G* basis set in all calculations because it has been demonstrated that this basis set is sufficient to predict optical transitions.24 For the sake of comparison, semiempirical calculations were performed using the ZINDO method (Zerner's spectroscopic parametrization of the intermediate neglect of differential overlap Hamiltonian)25 coupled to a single configuration interaction (SCI) scheme. The ZINDO calculations were performed on the optimized B3LYP geometries. All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 03 and Gaussian 09 programs.26
4. Results and discussion
To modify the optical and the electronic properties of the polythiophene such as band gap and the HUMO–LUMO levels, aromatic substituents have been introduced into the polythiophene chains. Indeed, Andersson et al.13 have shown that the absorption spectra of the POPT films are red-shifted by 150 nm compared to the P3HT. The POPT could exhibit an extended conjugation due to connection of the phenyl ring to the polythiophene backbone.
The samples considered for comparing experimental results to calculations were prepared by the GRIM method. POPT and POPOT both exhibited a very high degree of regioregularity at 100% and 96%, respectively. However, we found that high molecular weight POPOT was relatively difficult to obtain (Mw = 9000 g mol−1, Đ = Mw/Mn = 1.3) compared to POPT (Mw = 50000 g mol−1, Đ = 1.6). This explained the limited solubility of POPOT in common solvents, especially in that used for the polymerisation. Both polymers exhibit a lower dispersity (Đ) compared to the polymer obtained by the oxidative polymerisation.
The UV-visible absorption spectra of POPT and POPOT in chloroform solution and in the solid state (spin coated films) are presented in Fig. 1. In solution, POPOT showed a maximum band absorption at 540 nm which corresponds to a red-shift of about 60 nm with respect to that of POPT (λmax = 480 nm), and a red-shift of 90 nm compared to P3HT (λmax = 450 nm).27 In the case of POPT, the red-shift can be attributed to the extended conjugation through the phenyl ring. In the case of POPOT, the oxygen atom acts as a spacer between the phenyl group and the polythiophene backbone, thus decreasing the steric hindrance and allowing a more planar conformation of the polymer backbone of POPOT as compared to POPT.
The maximum absorption wavelength obtained with POPT is red-shifted to 606 nm in the solid state (a 126 nm red-shift relative to solution data) with a clear vibronic structure. This can indicate that the confinement of the POPT chains in the condensed phase results in a more planar conformation of the polythiophene backbone due to the π-stacking and enhances the delocalisation of π-electrons between phenyl groups and polythiophene backbone. In the solid state, the λmax of POPOT is red-shifted to 580 nm corresponding to a shift of 40 nm. The spectrum does not present any fine vibronic structure.
However, the λmax of POPOT in the solid state is compared to that of POPT (606 nm), it is found that for POPOT the gain in planarity and therefore the conjugation in the solid state are less significant than those observed in the case of POPT. For comparison, the red-shift usually observed for P3HT when going to the solid state is 130 nm, with a maximum absorption at 580 nm.28
The optical band gap (Eg) of polymers was obtained from the formula Eg = 1240/λedge (λedge is the onset value of the absorption spectrum in the long wave direction) (Table 1). POPOT presents an absorption band broader than that of POPT and by consequence the λedge of POPOT (750 nm) is larger than that of POPT (710 nm). The band-gap of POPOT is thus lower (1.65 eV) when compared to POPT (1.75 eV).

With respect to the theoretical results, we used the so-called oligomer approach; in this strategy the properties of oligomers of increasing chain length were first calculated, and then extrapolated to ideal infinite polymers.29 Even the oligomer approach requires calculation of the properties of rather large systems (up to 242 atoms for POPOT), the method used herein (DFT) is relatively cost efficient for electronic structure calculations on large systems in comparison to those usually used for conjugated systems (semiempirical Hartree–Fock methods). The use of DFT against low-cost computational approaches is justified by the nature of the systems studied here, where the twisting is expected to be important. In general DFT with B3LYP hybrid functional is recommended for twisting of conjugated polymers.24,30
In order to use the oligomer approaches some simplifications are necessary due to the high number of atoms in each oligomer. Based on saturation of several physical properties with respect to the length of alkyl chains,31 C4 seems to be a good limit. So, P3HT, POPT and POPOT polymers were studied with these lengths for regioregular head-to-tail arrangement (H–T).
The calculations indicate that while the conjugated chains of P3HT and POPT are affected by the presence of alkyl chains and both phenyl and alkyl chains, respectively, the main conjugated backbone of POPOT is fully planar. Indeed, in each oligomer of P3HT and POPT, the torsion angles between two neighbour rings are nearly similar and vary between 30° and 47°. These data are in good agreement with the torsional angle of PDOBT (poly(dioctylbithiophene)) determined by X-ray diffraction (40°).32 The introduction of the oxygen atom between thiophene and phenyl rings is responsible for planarity of POPOT. The presence of an oxygen atom clearly decreases the steric hindrance of the pendant groups thus allowing a planar polymer backbone with a higher order. Indeed, in addition to the planarity, the pendant phenyl groups are perfectly superimposed. Their intermolecular distances changed from 7.80 to 7.86 Å. The intramolecular distance between oxygen and sulfur atoms varies between 2.90 and 2.93 Å. While in P3HT and POPT, the pendant phenyl and alkyl side chains are less compact and influence the planarity of the polymer backbone.
Bond length alternation (BLA) is the important criterion for comparing the geometries and extents of conjugation in different oligothiophene conformations.33,34Fig. 2 shows the C–C bond lengths in the π-systems of P3HT, POPT and POPOT. Comparison between these three polymers shows similar patterns. The geometric structure of the octamers shows a clear aromatic character. However, the degree of C–C bond alternation in the cycles grows in the order POPOT < P3HT < POPT, which indicates the decrease of resonance within the rings. The reduction of conjugation in P3HT and POPT, in comparison with POPOT, is explained by the large twisting angle between the repeating units in these compounds (the torsion angle is about 40°).

It will be useful to examine the highest occupied orbitals (HOMO) and the lowest virtual orbitals (LUMO) for these oligomers and polymers because the relative ordering of the occupied and virtual orbitals provides a reasonable qualitative indication of the subsequent excitation energies and the ability of electron or hole transport. The evolution of the HOMO–LUMO gaps obtained with B3LYP in oligomers of P3HT, POPT and POPOT is given in ESI.† The energy gap has been estimated from HOMO–LUMO gaps, by using the linear extrapolation technique (Fig. S1, ESI†). We obtained the gaps of 1.75, 2.33 and 2.60 eV for POPOT, P3HT and POPT, respectively (Table 2). These data confirm that the introduction of the oxygen atom in each unit clearly decreases the gap of the polymer and thus, as usually noted in π-conjugated systems, is due to the more planar conformation of the conjugated backbone of POPOT. Moreover, the electron donor feature of the oxygen atom may intervene toward the phenyl ring and the polythiophene backbone, yielding to an extended conjugated chain. In addition, based on the P3HT and POPT geometries obtained, a single point is calculated for the planar conjugated backbone (crystal packing in the films). The energy gap moves from 2.33 to 1.90 eV for P3HT and from 2.60 to 1.88 eV for POPT. These predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimental data (1.9 eV and 1.80 eV, respectively).14

On the basis of the optimized geometry, we calculated with TDDFT, LC-TDDFT and ZINDO the absorption spectrum of these oligomers. The first absorption feature is markedly shifted to lower energies with increasing chain length, and a linear relationship is found between the transition energy and the reciprocal chain length (Fig. 3 and 4). To predict the optical properties of the polymers, this linear behaviour was extrapolated to infinite chain length. The resulting absorption spectra are listed in Table 3, where available experimental data are also included.

The calculations of the S0 ← S1 vertical transition energies for the different oligomers indicate that in comparison with the transitions of P3HT, the transition of POPT is blue-shifted (by 0.2–0.3 eV at both levels of theory), whereas the transitions of POPOT are significantly red-shifted (by 0.5 eV). This trend is directly correlated to the HOMO–LUMO gaps because the S0 ← S1 transition is mainly described by an electronic excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO levels. Using these relationships, optical excitation energies of 2.40, 2.20, and 2.57 eV are extrapolated for an infinite chain of POPT on the basis of ZINDO, TDDFT and LC-TDDFT methods, respectively. This comparison is very interesting and shows the good performance of LC-BLYP in predicting the excitation energy (2.57 eV) compared to the experimental ones (2.68 eV).
The experimental and theoretical first optical transitions of P3HT, POPT and POPOT in solution and in the solid state are listed in Table 3. In solution, the observed absorption maxima at 2.72 and 2.68 eV of P3HT and POPT, respectively, are higher than that of POPOT (2.30 eV), indicating that the introduction of an oxygen atom between the phenyl and the thiophene units red-shifts the maximum absorption band of POPOT with respect to P3HT and POPT. As predicted by the calculations, this red-shift is due to the more planar conformation in POPOT as compared to P3HT and POPT (the torsion angle is about 40°). Going from solution to the solid state, the experimental main absorption is red-shifted by 0.5, 0.62 and 0.16 eV for P3HT, POPT and POPOT, respectively. The observed low shift in the case of POPOT is due to the solid state effects (interchain interactions), whereas the larger shifts in the cases of P3HT and POPT are due both to substitution effects (twisting of conjugated chains) and interchain interactions. Indeed, in order to quantify the substitution effects on the optical properties of P3HT and POPT, we have calculated the first absorption transitions by keeping the conjugated backbone planar (as imposed by π delocalization and crystal packing in the films) in P3HT and POPT. The shifts calculated with and without constraints are estimated to be about 0.37 eV (TDDFT), 0.41 eV (LC-TDDFT) and 0.31 eV (ZINDO) in P3HT while these shifts are 0.62, 0.66 and 0.53 eV in POPT. For each polymer, these values are very similar to the observed red-shifts from solution to the solid state. We conclude that the twisting effects are more important than the intermolecular interactions. Further, while P3HT and POPT show the same torsional features, the red-shift for POPT is more important than in the case of P3HT. This difference can be explained by the difference in energy required from relaxed geometry to a planar structure: 9.5 kcal mol−1 for P3HT (octamer) compared to 33.7 kcal mol−1 for POPT.31
Returning now to the comparison between the methodologies used in this work, a significant difference is observed between the theoretical methods regarding the absolute value of the transition energies. The LC-BLYP yields substantial improvements over conventional hybrid functional, such as B3LYP (see Table 3). On the other hand, the semiempirical ZINDO method has been parametrized to reproduce the transition energies for a large number of compounds in polar solvents. The ZINDO results generally closely match the slope of the 1/N chain-length dependence inferred from experimental data. The significant underestimation of Evert values compared to the experimental Emax values likely results from the combination of several factors: (i) a deficient parameterization of the sulfur atom in ZINDO, which leads to a systematic underestimation of Evert; (ii) a possible discrepancy in the theoretical description of the BLA along the conjugated backbone; (iii) a proper treatment of the impact of the thermal population.
From Fig. 3 and 4, it is inferred that a good linear relationship exists between the transition energy and the inverse ring number within the short oligomeric range which provides further information on effective conjugation length. It is reasonable to consider that the coefficients of the linear equations reflect the effective conjugation of the individual systems.35,36 The coefficients obtained with ZINDO for P3HT and POPT (3.78 and 2.67) are smaller than that for POPOT (4.09). The low coefficients of P3HT and POPT mean less conjugation of these systems, which can be explained especially in terms of intrachain twisting due to sterical demand of the substituted groups. These data confirm the above prediction on the BLA.
The magnitude of the exciton binding energy (Eb), defined as the difference between the charge separation gap and the optical gap of the 1Bu state, has been intensively studied in the past, and is still controversial and hence of great interest. Strictly, this definition is only applied to long-chain oligomers. We note that for small-chain oligomers charge gap is smaller than 1Bu excitation energy. The charge gap is defined as the energy creating an electron plus the energy creating a hole, namely, when the electron does not interact with the hole, or their separation is infinite. In the long-chain limit, it can be regarded as the gap between the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) and highest occupied (HOMO) molecular orbitals, Eg. But, for finite chain length, the two charges (electron and hole) can never be separated from each other. It is thus not well defined for a finite system. The optical gap of the 1Bu state is the vertical excitation energy from the ground state to the first dipole-allowed excited state, Evert. Finally, the magnitude of the exciton binding energy (Eb) can be written as Eb = Eg − Evert.
The magnitude of the exciton binding energy is very important for applications. In photovoltaic devices one would like to have a small binding energy, which facilitates the fast separation of charges, while in electroluminescent devices such as LEDs a larger exciton binding energy is desirable, to increase the probability of fast (radiative) annihilation of electron–hole pairs. The exciton binding energies Eb = Eg − Evert where Eg is the gap between the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) and highest occupied (HOMO) molecular orbitals and Evert the vertical excitation energy from the ground state to the first dipole-allowed excited state. As the interchain interactions have important effects on the exciton binding energy,39Eb is evaluated using coplanar conformations that are imposed by crystal packing in the films. Exciton binding energies obtained from B3LYP/6-31G* are 0.35 eV for P3HT, 0.40 eV for POPT and 0.25 eV for POPOT polymers. Our results allow us to conclude that the POPOT polymer is a promising candidate for photovoltaic applications in comparison with P3HT and POPT polymers.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, we used density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), long-range-corrected TDDFT and ZINDO methods to study the electronic and optical properties of P3HT, POPT and POPOT polymers. In the P3HT and POPT polymers, the calculations indicate that the pendant phenyl and alkyl groups influence the planarity of the polymer backbone due to steric hindrance of the substituents. While the presence of the oxygen atoms in each unit of the polymer leads to significant structural reorganizations, a more planar backbone of polymer (POPOT) and a nice organization of the substituted groups are obtained (the phenyl rings are superimposed, Fig. 5). The results obtained for different structural polymers (planar and not planar) indicate that P3HT and POPT are less conjugated than POPOT. Further, the twisting effects on the electronic and optical properties of P3HT and POPT are very important. Further this study gives an explanation to the experimental observations and allows us to understand the difference between these polymers in their optical properties, indicating that a large shift observed from solution to solid phase in P3HT and POPT results from a large twisting between repeating units in these compounds. Among the theoretical methods used in this work in predicting the excitation energies for different oligothiophenes, LC-BLYP gives the best performance. Moreover, POPOT has the lower exciton binding energy, suggesting that this polymer is a promising candidate for photovoltaic applications in comparison with P3HT and POPT polymers.
