    , Accepted 10th December 2018First published on 12th December 2018AbstractVapor reaction is one of the major methods used for large-scale fabrication of high-quality organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells, but its detailed process is rarely investigated. In this study, the thermal and illumination effects on PbI2 and its transformation to CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) under CH3NH3I (MAI) vapor were investigated. Atomic shifting of the PbI2 layer was observed, which caused the generation of defects and distortion in PbI2 without breaking the phase structure. The reaction with MAI started with decoupling of PbI2 layers and formation of nanoislands and then, the transformation of PbI2 to MAPbI3 proceeded randomly on the surface from top to bottom. Additional illumination of the reaction suppressed the transformation, causing the generation of PbI2 nano-walls along [100] and [010] directions, leading to decrease in power conversion efficiency.
Introduction
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites synthesized using the solution process is 23.2%;1 however, the solution process requires toxic solvents such as DMF, DMSO, and NMP, which may lead to pollution and safety problems when commercialized.2,3 Attempts to replace toxic solvents using green solvents4–6 or low-toxicity solvents2 or preparation of perovskites using solvent-free methods7–9 are becoming attractive. The vapor phase conversion of PbI2 to perovskite is compatible for large-scale production of pinhole-free thin films. PCE of photovoltaic devices has steadily improved to 20.13% in recent years.10 It is known that the growth and processing conditions of perovskite thin films significantly determine the structural and electronic properties. The growth process of perovskites in solution processes has been thoroughly investigated. However, in a fully vapor phase reaction, the transformation of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) does not involve an adduct compound as that required in the solution method,11 which is completely different and requires comprehensive investigation.
The vapor conversion process contains molecular absorption, diffusion and desorption as well as structural evolution, which are dependent on ambient conditions such as temperature,12–14 partial pressure,15,16 initial material forms,17 and moisture.18,19 In this whole experiment, the thermal effect is crucial as it drives the reaction. It has been shown that the reaction can proceed even at room temperature in the solid phase.19 In vapor reaction, in situ XRD results show rapid transformation of PbI2 to perovskite with increasing temperature,20 and many different phases exist during growth.21 However, a detailed pathway of evolution and diffusion as well as the structural transformation mechanism is far from being understood.
Herein, we investigated a two-step vapor conversion process of a crystalline PbI2 nanoplate to MAPbI3 in detail under annealing and illumination conditions. On the basis of AFM, Raman and PL spectroscopies, we illustrate the structural evolution of PbI2 in nanoscale and then its transformation pathway to MAPbI3; the mechanism is also discussed.
Results and discussion
Effects of illumination and annealing on as-prepared PbI2
Face-shared PbI2 is a van der Waals layered material (Fig. 1(a)). In each molecular layer, a layer of Pb atoms is sandwiched between two close packed layers of iodine atoms. Each Pb atom is surrounded by 6 I atoms, forming a face-shared octahedron [PbI6]. The Pb or I molecular layers can slip to each other to form different geometric stackings along the c axis, leading to different phases of PbI2 such as 2H, 4H, 6H, and 12R (Fig. 1(a)).22Fig. 1(b) shows that the as-prepared PbI2 nanoplates are hexagonal with thickness of tens to several hundred nanometers. Fig. 1(c) shows that the as-prepared PbI2 nanoplates on mica are well-orientated with the (001) crystallographic plane parallel to the mica surface. The surface of the as-prepared PbI2 nanoplate is composed of atomic flat terraces (Fig. 2(d)). The minimum step height around 0.70 nm (Fig. 2(e)) agrees well with the height of one layer along the c axis. Fig. 2(a) shows that the as-prepared PbI2 nanoplate was 6H-PbI2 with three typical peaks at 69, 93 and 107 cm−1, which can be assigned to the bending (68 cm−1) and stretching (93 cm−1) of Pb–I bonding and the asymmetric stretching between the lead layer and two iodine layers (109 cm−1).23,24

AFM surface morphology change after illumination (b), annealing (c) and both effects (d). 
To illustrate the effects of illumination and annealing, we first performed a control experiment on as-prepared PbI2 without reaction with MAI. It is found in Fig. 2(a) that the positions of Raman peaks of PbI2 did not change in any of the conditions, whereas the surface morphology changed greatly. AFM results shown in Fig. 2(b) indicate that under illumination, many small slices and pits appear near the steps. The height or depth is the height of one to two molecular layers. The pits show the same geometric structure as the adjacent slices, indicating that the slices break from the terrace.
Annealing PbI2 induced a profound effect. The terrace surface degraded with an increase in the surface RMS roughness from 0.23 nm to 2.4 nm. Nanoparticles were formed on the surface. The process of nanoparticles formed shows that annealing can easily activate the plane terrace of the PbI2 nanoplate. Thermal activation induced intense atomic shifting, which caused internal stress. Uplifting of nanoslices out-of-plane occurred as that observed in the illumination experiments to release the stress, which caused roughening of the surface. When both illumination and annealing were applied on the PbI2 nanoplate, atomic shifting became severe. A large granular surface appeared, and significant in-plane expansion was also observed (Fig. S3†). Although dramatic morphology changes were observed under AFM, Raman spectra in Fig. 2(a) showed no shifting of Raman peaks. This indicated that the lattice geometry did not break under any treatment. Only slight expansion in the peak width could be identified, which indicated that the change in morphology was caused by the generation of defect densities.
Two-step vapor growth of perovskites
The reaction between PbI2 and MAI vapor can significantly change both the Raman spectra and morphology. 6H-polytype PbI2 contains three layer packets and then, the Davydov splitting of vibrational frequencies due to weak interlayer interactions can shift the Raman peaks to lower frequencies. It is found that at the initial 20 minutes, Raman peaks shift to 74, 98 and 113 cm−1. In some former studies, Raman peaks at 74, 98 and 113 cm−1 are ascribed to MAPbI3.25,26 However, PL spectra only show a peak at 758 nm (Fig. 3b). The intensity of the peak is weak, and the position is not exactly the same as that of MAPbI3, which does not support the formation of MAPbI3 at this stage. The Raman spectra are close to the 2H phase PbI2, which shows no Davydov coupling between interlayers; the effect is profound in 6H-polytype PbI2, due to which the observed peaks exhibit lower Raman shifts (Fig. 3(a)).23 We suggest that at this early stage of reaction, MAI molecules should have at least partially diffused into different interlayers of the whole PbI2 nanoplate to decouple PbI2 layers, which cannot be achieved by any condition shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3(c) shows that the surface of PbI2 nanoplate after 20 minute reaction is composed of nanoislands. These islands are randomly distributed on the surface. Under the islands, we can still find the plane terrace. The results show that MAI insertion also helps cause atomic layer shifting of the PbI2 layer from the top surface.
 Fig. 3  Synthesis of perovskite in the dark: (a) Raman spectra of PbI2 after reaction in MAI vapor for 0 minute, 20 minutes and 90 minutes; (b) PL spectra after reacting for 20 minutes and 90 minutes in (a); AFM morphology images after reacting for 20 minutes (c) and 90 minutes (d). 
The reaction time is then extended to 90 minutes. The PL peak shifts to 778 nm, and the intensity increases by about 104 orders. This indicates that most PbI2 has been converted to perovskite. After the completion of the reaction (Fig. 3(d)), the surface seems to be composed of compact grains. An overall in-plane expansion by 0.44 μm and an out-of-plane expansion from 73.8 nm to 130 nm are observed from the morphology changes (Fig. S4†), which are consistent with that observed in solution preparation.27 We found that Raman peaks disappear on the fully reacted sample (Fig. 3(a)), which supports the analysis by Qiong Chen et al.: the intrinsic Raman spectrum of MAPbI3 should exhibit no visible discrete Raman modes in the spectral region of PbI2.25
Grätzel et al. found that illumination during the growth of perovskites was beneficial in the two-step solution method.28 It improves the uniformity of the perovskite crystal by decreasing the nucleation energy. Fig. 4(a) shows that under illumination, the Raman spectral shifts are the same as those in the dark in the early 20 minutes. However, these peaks do not disappear after further reaction. PL measurement showed that during the entire process, the PL peak at ∼780 nm did not appear (Fig. S5†). This indicated that perovskite is less stable than PbI2 under annealing and illumination conditions. Looking at the AFM surface in Fig. 4(b), we infer that the morphology is completely different from that under dark. Small wall-like PbI2 structures aligned along [100] or [010] directions are observed on the surface. The wall-like on the surface show that illumination was illness in the vapor growth of perovskite. The illumination effect was further tested in devices. Fig. 4(c) (detailed thin film characterization is shown in Fig. S6†) shows that without illumination, the device shows PCE of 16.50%. The hysteresis between forward and reverse scans mainly comes from the charging effect at the TiO2/perovskite interface (Fig. S6†).29 The device fabricated under illumination (Fig. 4(d)) shows lower PCE of 10.61%, and JSC, VOC and FF degrade as well. The performance can further degrade under intense illumination power. The decomposition of MAPbI3 to PbI2 is also supported by the XRD results shown in Fig. S6,† which leads to the degradation of PCE.

In the solution method, PbI2 can form an intermediate phase and then transform to MAPbI3.27 Considering the above experiments, we can see that the vapor growth is different. In the vapor phase method, the driving force is suggested to be the thermal-induced atomic shifting and generation of defects. We can draw a schematic picture of the vapor transformation of PbI2 to MAPbI3 from the above observations, as shown in Fig. 5. At the initial stage, the MAI molecules can diffuse into the interlayer of PbI2. At the same time, atomic shifting occurs, which is caused by thermal activation. An integrate molecular plane breaks into small PbI2 islands, which produces many I vacancy sites. The distorted octahedron [PbI6] provides I vacancy sites for the combination of I− in MAI. At the same time, MA+ is located at the center of three octahedrons. It pulls the face-sharing [PbI6] octahedron to reorient to the corner-sharing perovskite structure in a nanoisland. Afterwards, outward ripening appears, which results in the growth of nanoislands into large grains.
 Fig. 5  Schematics of the vapor formation of perovskite upon thermal activation. 
Under illumination, the electron of MAPbI3 is excited to the p orbital of center Pb, leaving an h+ ion at the p orbital of corner I due to s–p coupling.30 It can form a polaronic distorted state that suppresses the continuous growth to large MAPbI3 grains.31 Moreover, the corner I atoms are in a (I−h+) complex, and CH3NH3+ is reoiented to central Pb−.31 Under high-temperature growth process, desorptions of I2 from adjacent (I−h+) complexes or HI and CH3NH2 are allowed. The process will revert the growth of MAPbI3, leaving the growth of PbI2 nanorods with a stable (100) or (010) plane.
Experimental section
Growth of PbI2 nanoplates on a mica substrate
Two-dimensional PbI2 nanoplates were synthesized by the thermal physical vapor deposition method under air condition, as shown in Fig. S1.† PbI2 powder (0.25–0.30 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) was placed at the center of a quartz tube and heated to 400 °C. A mica substrate was placed downstream to collect the nanoplates.
Conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3
Transformation of PbI2 to MAPbI3 was carried out by a two-step chemical vapor deposition. Schematic set-up and process are shown in Fig. S2.† The nanoplates or thin films of PbI2 were placed face-down to the CH3NH3I (MAI, TCI, 98%) powders, which were uniformly distributed in a crucible. The crucible was then put on a heating stage at 150 °C for vapor reaction.
Material characterization
Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were performed using a confocal Raman microscope (LabRAM HR Evolution) with a 532 nm laser as the excitation source. The power of the laser was turned down to ensure that the Raman spectrum of the perovskite remains unchanged after several scans. Surface morphology was analysed using NT-MDT Ntegra Prima atomic force microscopy (AFM) under ambient conditions with the semi-contact mode.
Conclusions
In summary, the structural evolution of PbI2 and its transformation to MAPbI3 perovskite under MAI vapor were systematically investigated. Both atomic shifting of the PbI2 layer and decoupling of PbI2 layers by MAI intercalation were found in the annealing condition, which thermally drove the vapor formation of MAPbI3 step by step from defect generation, nanoisland formation to grain growth. Illumination during preparation was also found to cause defects in PbI2; it suppressed the formation of MAPbI3, leading to reconstruction of PbI2. These findings illustrate the thermal and illumination effects on the vapor growth of perovskites, which should be helpful to optimize the vapor growth of perovskites.
