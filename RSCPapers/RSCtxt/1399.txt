    , Accepted 23rd January 2019First published on 25th January 2019AbstractMetamaterials based on arrays of subwavelength dielectric structures have recently proved to be a viable research tool towards the realization of various photonic devices. In the current study we introduce a new approach towards efficient light trapping and broadband absorption of solar radiation based on silicon surface arrays composed of subwavelength trumpet non-imaging light concentrators (henceforth, trumpet arrays). In geometrical optics, a three-dimensional trumpet non-imaging light concentrator is a hyperboloid of revolution with an ideal light concentration ratio. We use finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic calculations to examine the optical response of an infinite cubic-tiled substrate-less silicon trumpet array under normal illumination. The absorptivity spectra of trumpet arrays are characterized by strong absorption peaks, some of which are just below the Yablonovitch limit. The enhanced light trapping is attributed solely to the efficient occupation of the array Mie modes, and we show absorption enhancement at near infrared that is an order of magnitude higher than that of the optimized nanopillar (NP) arrays. We show superior broadband absorption of solar radiation in trumpet arrays (with unoptimized geometry) compared with that of the optimized NP arrays (∼26% enhancement). The higher optical absorption in the trumpet array is governed by low transmissivity, in contrast to the NP array in which the absorption is governed by low reflectivity. Finally, we show that low reflectivity in trumpet arrays is governed by modal excitation at the upper part of the trumpets (which is also supported by the weak dependency of the reflectivity on the array height), whereas the transmissivity is governed by modal excitation at the lower part of the trumpets.
Introduction
Broadband absorption of the solar spectrum is important to applications ranging from sensing1,2 to solar energy conversion.3–6 For example, efficient absorption of solar radiation could support the realization of ultra-thin film photovoltaic cells with absorption comparable to bulk solar cells which directly lead to lower recombination currents, higher open circuit voltages and hence higher PV efficiencies.7 The Yablonovitch limit predicts the maximum allowed light trapping in a homogeneous semiconducting film,8,9 which is possible by randomization of the top and bottom interfaces of the film. This randomization results in a generation of wave vectors that can occupy the various optical modes of the film that are otherwise not accessible to the impinging illumination. A surface array with a subwavelength period can potentially generate wavenumbers in addition to the impinging radiation by scattering and/or diffraction.10–12 Recently, metamaterials based on arrays of subwavelength dielectric structures emerged as a promising research tool towards the realization of various photonic applications.13 Specifically, in the context of light trapping, surface arrays of semiconducting subwavelength structures introduce additional Mie modes (localized trapped modes); the presence of Mie modes and hybridization of these with other modes (i.e. e.g. guided modes, Fabry–Perot modes, etc.) allow light trapping beyond the Yablonovitch limit.14 Yu et al. demonstrated a statistical temporal coupled-mode theory that predicts beyond the Yablonovitch limit using wave optics,15 and Callahan et al. suggested that the Yablonovitch limit can be exceeded by ensuring the high density of local optical states in the absorber.16 Broadband absorption enhancement of solar radiation was experimentally and numerically demonstrated for surface arrays of subwavelength semiconducting structures such as nanopillar (NP) arrays, nanohole arrays, nanorod arrays and nanocone arrays.6,17–36
Recent studies showed broadband absorption enhancement of the solar spectrum using arrays of subwavelength semiconducting structures by increasing the concentration ratio of the individual structures. Yoo et al. increased the optical absorption of NP arrays by applying match-head features, that act as built-in light concentrators, on top of each NP.37 Mariani et al. generated an absorption enhancement of GaAs arrays by decorating the array with an additional two dimensional periodic array of subwavelength ITO lens; this allowed an efficient occupation of the local density of optical states within the photoactive material.38 We numerically demonstrated broadband absorption enhancement with arrays of subwavelength light funnels (LFs).39–41 We suggested that the absorption enhancement is due to the concentration capabilities of each of the LFs comprising the array that ensures efficient incoupling of the impinging illumination into the individual LFs.
In the following we report broadband light absorption of solar radiation with arrays of subwavelength trumpet non-imaging light concentrators (NLCs). Research on NLCs was initiated and spearheaded by Winston and colleagues during the late 1960s and early 1970s.42,43 The main insight that motivated light concentration based on NLCs was the realization that the performance of light collection systems is maximized if the need for image formation is removed; an imaging system needs to conserve a space phase volume while mapping each point in the object plane to the image plane, while an NLC obeys the conservation of the space phase volume solely by mapping the edge of all rays (the edge-ray principle).44 Today NLCs have important applications for the collection and concentration of solar radiation.45 There are various designs of NLCs such as light cone (LC) NLC, paraboloid NLC, compound parabolic concentrators (CPC) and their derivatives, etc. The trumpet NLC (also known as hyperboloid NLC or a flow-line concentrator) is an important member of the NLC family with an ideal concentration ratio as it accounts for both meridional rays as well as skew rays.46
In the current study we use finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic calculations to examine light trapping and broadband absorption of solar radiation in free-floating arrays composed of subwavelength silicon trumpet NLCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a provides the schematics of a trumpet NLC, and Fig. 1b shows the illustration of an array composed of subwavelength non-imaging trumpet concentrators, henceforth referred to as the trumpet array. In the current manuscript we numerically consider substrate-less trumpet arrays in which we purposely impose absorbing boundary conditions along the vertical axis (see Methods) in order to exclude the contribution of Fabry–Perot oscillations (between the top and bottom interfaces); in this manner the optical response of the system, and specifically the broadband absorption enhancement, is contributed solely to the efficient occupation of Mie resonances. Fig. 1c and d present the absorptivity spectra of a thin film, an optimized NP array (array period and NP diameter of 500 nm and 400 nm, respectively25), and trumpet arrays with a bottom diameter (Db) of 50 nm and 100 nm for heights of 0.5 μm and 1 μm, respectively. Methodologically, the trumpets are generated by deforming the sidewalls of the optimized NPs while maintaining the array periodicity (500 nm) and fixing the trumpet top diameter to that of the NP diameter (Dt = 400 nm). In contrast to the NP array spectra, the trumpet array spectra exhibited strong spectral absorption peaks. Naturally, the strong absorption peaks at near infrared are interesting; for example, at wavelength 880 nm (array height of 0.5 μm) the trumpet array absorption is 13.5 times higher than the NP array absorption (absorptivity of 0.223 and 0.016, respectively), and at wavelength 960 nm (array height of 1 μm) the trumpet array absorption is 15 times higher than the NP array absorption (absorptivity of 0.152 and 0.01, respectively). The Yablonovitch limit is also shown for reference, and noticeably, while the NP array spectrum lies well below the limit, the spectra of the trumpet arrays approach, at certain wavelengths, the Yablonovitch limit. Also, note that, as expected, for 1 μm height (Fig. 1d) the trumpet array spectra are closer to the Yablonovitch limit in comparison with the spectra of the 0.5 μm height (Fig. 1c), albeit there is higher broadband absorption enhancement of the 0.5 μm high array. The reason for this is that the broadband absorption of thicker films is always higher, but the absorption enhancement factor is always higher for thinner films.8,15 Finally, in the spectral range of 400–500 nm, the trumpet arrays absorb less compared to the NP arrays; however, this is not an inherent property of arrays composed of inverted structures as we demonstrated previously.39 Evidently, for both heights of 0.5 μm and 1 μm, the broadband absorption of the selected trumpet arrays is significantly higher than that of a thin film and of an optimized NP array. The insets in Fig. 1c and d present the respective weighted absorption efficiency (ηabs) which is the relative absorption spectrum weighted with the solar spectrum (AM1.5G). The transition from a thin film to an NP array indicates an ηabs enhancement of ∼28.5%, for both heights (0.5 μm and 1 μm). The deformation of a NP array into trumpet arrays generates an additional ηabs increase of 26.5% and 17% for Db = 50 nm and 100 nm, respectively, for the array height of 0.5 μm, and ηabs increase of 17% and 19% for Db = 50 nm and 100 nm, respectively, for the array height of 1 μm.

(c) and (d) Absorptivity spectra for free-floating optimized nanopillar arrays and free-floating trumpet arrays with bottom diameters of 50 nm and 100 nm for array heights of 0.5 μm and 1 μm, respectively and an array period of 500 nm. The absorptivity of a thin film and the Yablonovitch limit, of the corresponding heights, are shown as well. 

Fig. 2a–c present color maps showing the dependency of the trumpet array absorptivity spectra on Db for array heights of 0.5 μm, 1 μm and 2 μm, respectively (array period = 500 nm and Dt = 400 nm). Note that the topmost row in each of the color maps reflects the absorptivity spectra of an optimized NP array of the corresponding height. Again, the deformation of an optimized NP array into a trumpet array results in the emergence of strong absorption peaks; for example, for the 2 μm arrays (Fig. 2c) strong absorption peaks are visible in the spectral range >0.6 μm which are not present in the absorptivity spectrum of the optimized NP array. Fig. 2a–c also present the corresponding ηabs. Interestingly, for array heights of 0.5 μm and 1 μm (Fig. 2a and b), ηabs demonstrates an almost monotonous increase with decreasing Db with an ηabs increase of 35% and 20% relative to the NP array for array heights of 0.5 μm and 1 μm, respectively. Alternatively, for the array height of 2 μm (Fig. 2c) a maximum value of ηabs is recorded for Db = 200 nm which entails an ηabs enhancement of 10% compared with that of the respective NP array. Fig. 2d presents the power flux density (PFD) (which is the time-averaged Poynting vector) of two strong absorption peaks (marked in black circles in Fig. 2c) at wavelength 660 nm for Db = 200 nm and 300 nm (array height of 2 μm) with the corresponding PFD of an optimized NP array. The strong excitation of the trumpet, compared with that of the NP array, is evident. Note that as the reflection from the array bottom is prohibited by the absorbing z-axis boundary conditions (see Methods), the excitation is solely due to the occupation of Mie modes. Also, while the optical coupling between adjacent NPs is relatively weak, the optical coupling between adjacent trumpets exhibits a more complex behavior; the trumpet tops exhibit strong overlapping of the fields whereas the extent of optical coupling at the bottom of the trumpets is significantly smaller. Interestingly, the coupling of the trumpets is relatively independent of the trumpet dominant excitation. For Db = 200 nm the trumpet top is strongly excited while for Db = 300 nm the trumpet bottom is more excited; however, the optical coupling between the upper parts of the trumpets is stronger than the coupling at the bottom for both Dbs. Fig. 2e presents the absorbed photon density (APD) distributions (corresponding to PFD presented in Fig. 2d) where the stronger absorption in both trumpet arrays is evident as compared with the NP array. Finally, it is noticeable that strong excitation implies the area of high absorption efficiency; note the high absorption at the trumpets’ top part for Db = 200 nm and at the trumpets’ lower part for Db = 300 nm that corresponds to the strong excitation shown in Fig. 2d.

(d) Power flux distribution at wavelength 660 nm for Db = 200 nm and 300 nm and for the respective NP array. (e) The absorbed photon density distributions at wavelength 660 nm for Db = 200 nm and 300 nm and for the respective NP array. 

Fig. 3a–c present color maps showing the dependency of the trumpet array reflectivity spectra and transmissivity spectra on Db for array heights of 0.5 μm, 1 μm and 2 μm, respectively. The topmost row of each color map (Db = 400 nm) represents the reflectivity spectra or the transmissivity spectra of an optimized NP array of the corresponding height. Interestingly, reflectivity is lowest for NP arrays and once Db decreases, and the NPs are deformed into trumpets, the reflectivity increases. On the other hand, the transmissivity is highest for NP arrays and decreases substantially with decreasing Db, meaning that transmissivity decreases for trumpet arrays. Also, for each array height the dependency of the weighted transmission efficiency (ηtrn) and the weighted reflection efficiency (ηref) on Db is presented adjacent to the corresponding color maps. Again, it is evident that for the three selected heights ηref increases with decreasing Db which implies that ηabs is maximized when ηref is maximized as well. On the other hand, ηtrn decreases with decreasing Db which implies that ηabs is maximized when ηtrn is minimized. Also, it is evident that ηref depends very weakly on the array height which suggests that the reflection is mainly governed by Fresnel reflections at the trumpet top/ambient interface, whereas ηtrn exhibits strong height dependency, as expected, as higher array forces a decrease in transmission. Finally, the underlying mechanism for absorption enhancement in NP arrays is the anti-reflection properties of the array17,47–50 (which is also evident in Fig. 3a–c). On the other hand, the above results clearly suggest that the absorption enhancement in trumpet arrays is governed by reduced transmission, or in other words, the absorption enhancement in trumpet arrays is an outcome of the ‘anti-transmission’ properties of the arrays.

(b) Same as (a) for an array height of 1 μm. (c) Same as (a) for an array height of 2 μm. 
Next, we closely examine the origin of the strong absorption peaks characteristic of trumpet arrays. In ESI Fig. 4(a)† we present the dependency of the absorptivity spectra of the trumpet array (1 μm height, 500 nm period, Dt = 400 nm) on Db, and strong absorption peaks under consideration are marked in solid filled circles and are numbered (peaks 1–14). Note that these data are also presented in Fig. 2b in a color map representation; in the ESI† we present the same data in 1D curves for the purpose of clarity. The Yablonovitch limit and the absorptivity spectra of the corresponding optimized NP array are presented as well, for reference. For the purpose of clarity, Fig. 4a shows selected data points from ESI Fig. (a)† that presents the dependency of the absorptivity spectra of trumpet arrays on selected values of Db (50 nm, 100 nm, 150 nm, 300 nm), and in the following we examine the absorption peaks 8, 9, 10 and 14. An examination of the far-field absorptivity and the near-field modal excitation of the arrays permits the classification of the considered absorption peaks into four distinct groups. The representative absorption peaks that reflect the classification into four groups are examined in Fig. 4b–e. Fig. 4b–e present the dependency of the reflectivity, transmissivity and absorptivity (RTA) on Db for a selected wavelength. Note that Db = 400 nm reflects the RTA values of a NP array where it is apparent that the absorption is governed by low reflectivity and high transmissivity, and for Db < 400 nm a more complex behavior of reflectivity and transmissivity is recorded. The four groups are distinct in the way the maximum absorptivity relates to the reflectivity and transmissivity as shown in the RTA curves of Fig. 4b–e: group (1) (Fig. 4b): the maximum absorptivity (λ = 700 nm, Db = 100 nm) corresponds to both low reflectivity and low transmissivity; group (2) (Fig. 4c): the maximum absorptivity (λ = 720 nm, Db = 300 nm) corresponds to low reflectivity; group (3) (Fig. 4d): the maximum absorptivity (λ = 760 nm, Db = 150 nm) corresponds to low transmissivity; group (4) (Fig. 4e): the maximum absorptivity (λ = 960 nm, Db = 50 nm) corresponds to low transmissivity similar to group 3 (the distinction between groups 3 and 4 will become apparent once the near-field behavior is examined, which is presented next). Fig. 4b–e also present PFD (x-cut and y-cut – see Methods and Fig. 1b for polarization and directionality) of the selected group members. Group 1 presents one excitation at the trumpet top and a second excitation at the trumpet bottom; in group 2 a strong excitation is presented at the trumpet top; in group 3 a strong excitation is presented at the trumpet bottom; and in group 4 the trumpet bottom is not excited at all and, literally, no photons are able to penetrate the trumpet bottom. Now, the correlation between far-field response (the RTA curves) and the near-field behavior (PFD distribution) is evident: low reflectivity implies strong modal excitation at the upper part of the trumpet; this is also supported in Fig. 3 where it is shown that the dependency of the reflectivity on the trumpet height is negligible. Low transmissivity implies either strong excitation at the trumpet bottoms or, alternatively, Db is too small (relative to impinging wavelength) and no states, for the corresponding energy, are available for occupation and therefore funneling of light through the trumpet bottom diameter is forbidden. Fig. 4b–e also present PFD z-cuts at the location of strong excitation for the selected absorption peaks. Interestingly, note how the top parts of the trumpets are optically coupled whereas the bottom parts are more isolated and the extent of coupling with neighboring trumpets is limited. The other strong absorption peaks 1–7 and 11–13 also obey the above classification into 4 groups as presented in the ESI.† The inset in Fig. 4a summarizes the distribution of the 14 absorption peaks. It is obvious that most of the absorption peaks in trumpet arrays are due to low levels of transmission which is a result of either strong excitation at the bottom of the arrays, or no bottom excitation at all due to small Db and lack of available states for occupation (i.e. low density of states).

The other peaks are documented in the ESI.† Inset: The distribution of the 14 absorption peaks into 4 groups.

On the right PFD z-cuts of the strong excitation are presented. (c)–(e) Same as (b) only for groups 2–4, respectively. 
Conclusions
We numerically demonstrate enhanced light trapping and broadband absorption of solar radiation using arrays of subwavelength trumpet NLCs. We show that the absorption in trumpet arrays is mostly governed by their unique anti-transmission properties. The absorption in trumpet arrays strongly depends on the trumpet bottom diameter which determines the reflectivity and transmissivity of the arrays. We show that low reflectivity corresponds to Mie mode excitation at the upper part of the trumpets, whereas low transmissivity corresponds to mode excitation at the lower part of the trumpet or lack of optical states. Finally, we believe that the ability to affect transmission, reflection and absorption by tuning the trumpet bottom diameter can be of interest to a variety of nanophotonics applications.
Methods
We use three-dimensional (3D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic calculations with the advanced TCAD package by Synopsys Inc. The calculations pertain to an infinite cubic-tiled array where a single unit cell is calculated with periodic boundary conditions along the lateral dimensions. The periodic boundary conditions are applied to normally incident plane wave excitation (polarized along the x-axis) using the total-field scattered-field (TFSF) formulation. Both the magnetic and electric fields are copied directly from the periodic facet to the opposing one during field update. The complementary perfectly matched layer (CPML) boundary condition is set for the vertical direction (z-axis). Note that this boundary condition prohibits reflections from the array bottom interface and hence the optical excitation of the arrays is governed by the occupation of the array Mie modes. The number of absorbed, reflected and transmitted photons are spectrally extracted using sensors located above and below the unit cell. The relative absorption, reflection and transmission are calculated respectively. The spatial distributions of the power flux density (PFD, which is the time-averaged Poynting vector (SAV)) and the absorbed photon density (APD) are calculated at each wavelength. The APD is extracted by dividing the absorbed power density (, where σ is the non-zero conductivity and E is the electric field) by the energy of the incident photon. The calculations are performed in the spectrum range of 400–1100 nm in 20 nm steps. For efficient and accurate FDTD simulations, the maximum mesh cell size is kept smaller than 1/10th of the wavelength in silicon (more than 10 nodes per wavelength). The weighted absorption efficiency (ηabs) is the relative absorption (absorptivity) averaged and weighted with the solar spectrum. The weighted reflection and weighted transmission are calculated in a similar manner. The considered solar spectra is Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G). The optical constants of silicon materials are taken from the literature.51

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) A schematic illustration of the trumpet non-imaging light concentrator. (b) An illustration of a free-floating array composed of subwavelength trumpets (trumpet array). (c) and (d) Absorptivity spectra for free-floating optimized nanopillar arrays and free-floating trumpet arrays with bottom diameters of 50 nm and 100 nm for array heights of 0.5 μm and 1 μm, respectively and an array period of 500 nm. The absorptivity of a thin film and the Yablonovitch limit, of the corresponding heights, are shown as well.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a)–(c) The dependency of the absorptivity spectra on the trumpet bottom diameter for array heights of 0.5 μm, 1 μm, and 2 μm, and the respective weighted absorption efficiency (top diameter of 400 nm and array period of 500 nm). (d) Power flux distribution at wavelength 660 nm for Db = 200 nm and 300 nm and for the respective NP array. (e) The absorbed photon density distributions at wavelength 660 nm for Db = 200 nm and 300 nm and for the respective NP array.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) The dependency of the reflectivity and transmissivity on the trumpet bottom diameter for an array height of 0.5 μm, (top diameter of 400 nm and array period of 500 nm), as well as the corresponding weighted reflection and weighed transmission efficiencies. (b) Same as (a) for an array height of 1 μm. (c) Same as (a) for an array height of 2 μm.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Absorptivity spectra of trumpet arrays for various trumpet bottom diameters (array height of 1 μm, top diameter of 400 nm and array period of 500 nm). Four high absorption peaks are marked as solid circles (1–14). The absorption peaks marked with solid red circles are discussed in the main text. The other peaks are documented in the ESI.† Inset: The distribution of the 14 absorption peaks into 4 groups. (b) Group 1: On the left the dependency of Reflection/Transmission/Absorption (RTA) on the bottom diameter. The highest absorption is marked with a red dashed line. In the middle the PFD x-sections (x-cut and y-cut) are presented and high excitation at the upper part and lower part of the trumpet is marked. On the right PFD z-cuts of the strong excitation are presented. (c)–(e) Same as (b) only for groups 2–4, respectively.
