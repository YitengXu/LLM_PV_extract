    , Accepted 1st December 2016First published on 2nd December 2016AbstractWe here present a new generation of high-performance photoelectrochromic device, which contains a photoanode of CdS quantum dot sensitized TiO2, an electrochromic electrode of WO3, and aqueous electrolyte containing [Fe(CN)6]4−/3− and Li+ ions. It is found that the CdS quantum dot sensitized TiO2 photoanode exhibits a tunable optical absorption edge through modulating the deposition cycles, which results in a controllable photovoltaic conversion. A maximum transparency of 81% and light modulation of about 70% in the visible light range is readily reached under optimized conditions, which is much improved from that of the conventional dye-based photoelectrochromic device. This study demonstrates the promising potential of the photoelectrochromic device in applications for energy-saving smart windows.
1. Introduction
A photoelectrochromic device (PECD) is a self-powered electrochromic (EC) device that consists of an EC electrode and a photoanode (PA) separated by electrolytes.1–3 The PA supplies electrons continuously to the EC electrode for coloration under irradiation of light; with the external circuit open or the light off, the originally colored EC electrode is discolored by losing electrons to its surrounding electrolytes.3,4 As a PECD can be controlled for transmittance modulation on demand and requires no external electrical power source, it has huge potential in applications of energy-saving buildings and displays.1,5 Recent PAs developed for PECDs are mostly sensitized with organic dyes of color, which results in low transmittance modulation as well as deep color (in the discolored state).6–8 The first dye-based PECD demonstrated by Bechinger shows only a transmittance modulation of 18%.1 Then, this value has been steadily improved to be 38% around 620 nm recently by Ho’s and our group using EC materials as the cathode.3,6 Recently, Bella and Syrrokostas designed a partly covered structure by depositing WO3 under a TiO2 layer to act as an anode to achieve a transmittance of more than 60%.4,9–12 However, further improvement in all-covered tandem devices seems to be difficult due to the pristine color of dyes, in addition to the compatibility with both the EC electrode and electrolytes. Thus, a strategy to solve these problems is to employ alternative PAs, such as quantum dot (QD) sensitized PAs. Recent studies on CdS-based QD sensitized PAs have shown not only a sufficient photovoltaic output13 but also a relatively light color.14–16 However, the stake of the compatibility among QD-based PAs, EC electrodes, and electrolytes for a high-performance PECD still remains high. For example, the widely used redox couple of S2−/Sn2− in solar cells etches EC materials such as WO3,17 and the conventionally employed I−/I3− in PECDs causes serious degradation to CdS.18 Recently, Deepa demonstrated a QD-based PECD with CdS/titania, S2−/Sn2−, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole)/vanadium pentoxide nanobelt hybrids, showing an optical contrast of 55% at 650 nm.16 This group also designed a device based on MoO3 and S2−/Sn2, which showed a maximum optical contrast of 31% at 630 nm.19 As far as we know, these are the only two reports found in the literature so far studying QD-based PECDs. Regarding the demands for application, the optical contrast of QD-based PECDs still needs improvement.
Aiming at improving the optical contrast, we herein report the fabrication of a QD sensitized PECD (QDS-PECD) with a CdS QD-based PA, a WO3 electrochromic electrode, and aqueous electrolytes containing [Fe(CN)6]4−/3− and Li+ ions. The obtained devices accompanied by their working electrodes are characterized. An investigation to tune the PA optical properties is carried out by changing the deposition cycles of CdS. Additionally, optimization of the conditions for obtaining a high-performance device is also carried out. At the end, we further discuss work for future improvements.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Tetrabutyl titanate (99%) is purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA). Pure tungsten powder (99%), cadmium nitrate, sodium sulfide, potassium ferricyanide, and lithium chloride are all from Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co., Ltd. All the chemicals are used as received without further purification.
2.2. Preparation of the CdS quantum dot sensitized TiO2 photoanode
A TiO2 sol was prepared with a previously reported method.20 In brief, 10 mL tetrabutyl titanate was dissolved in 20 mL acetic acid, followed by adding 10 mL deionized water and stirring for 4 h. The prepared clear TiO2 sol was then transferred into a reaction kettle and heated at 200 °C for 4 h to obtain TiO2 nanoparticles. After being cooled down to room temperature, the obtained TiO2 nanoparticle paste was stirred for several days for usage. The TiO2 film with a thickness of about 2 μm was deposited on FTO glass by the doctor blade method, followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain the anatase phase.
The CdS sensitized TiO2 film was obtained by immersing the TiO2 film into 0.5 M Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution for 5 min, followed by rinsing with ethanol. It was then dipped into 0.5 M Na2S methanol solution for another 5 min and rinsed fully with methanol. The alternate dipping–rinsing cycle in two different solutions was repeated to increase the amount of CdS QDs. The PA prepared with n cycles is noted as CdS(n)/TiO2.
2.3. Preparation of the WO3 electrochromic electrode
WO3 films of 450 nm were prepared with a method reported previously.21 6 g tungsten powder (99.99%) was dissolved into 60 mL hydrogen peroxide solution (H2O2, 30%), and then filtered. The solution was refluxed and then stored for at least two weeks to form a stable peroxo-polytungstic acid solution before being used for electrodeposition. All the WO3 films were deposited with the method of chronoamperometry in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a platinum sheet as the auxiliary electrode, ITO glass substrate as the working electrode, and Ag wire as the reference electrode. The working electrode was subjected to a constant cathodic potential of −0.6 V for 200 seconds at room temperature. Electrodeposited WO3 films were annealed at 300 °C for 30 min for usage.
2.4. Synthesis of electrolyte
Aqueous electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 0.4 M K4Fe(CN)6 and 0.15 M LiCl into deionized water in air atmosphere. Freshly prepared electrolyte of light yellow color was used every time a device was fabricated.
2.5. Assembly
The TiO2/CdS/FTO and WO3/ITO electrodes were face-to-face sealed to assemble the QDS-PECD. Ultraviolet (UV) curing sealant was used as the sealer around the edges of the electrodes with a space filler of 200 microns aqueous electrolyte injected into the space of the cell through a pre-drilled hole of the electrode. After being fully filled, the hole of the cell is sealed completely with UV curing sealant. The QDS-PECD prepared with CdS(n)/TiO2 is noted as QDS-PECD(n).
2.6. Characterization
The structures of both films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (X'Pert PRO, PANalytical B. V., Almelo, Netherlands), where Cu Kα (Kα = 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 200 mA) was used as the X-ray source. The element composition of the PA was investigated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250, Thermo-VG Scientific, East Grinstead, West Sussex, UK), with Al Kα as the X-ray source. The morphology of the films was obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Sirion 200, FEI, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) and from a field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). Photocurrent–time curves were obtained using an electrochemical station under 5 s illumination of a xenon lamp. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded in the assembled QDS-PECDs under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The light absorption and transmittance of the films were measured with a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (V-670, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The optical performance of the QDS-PECD was measured by a portable spectrometer (USB200+, Ocean Optics, USA). The incident light intensity was measured by an SCR-300 Solar Tester (Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd Japan).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and mechanism
In brief, the QDS-PECD combines half of a typical QD sensitized solar cell and half of a typical EC device. Fig. 1 shows the structure of the designed QDS-PECD, with a QD sensitized solar cell and an EC device in comparison.5,22,23 The QDS-PECD contains, from top to bottom, a PA layer of CdS/TiO2 on FTO glass substrate, an aqueous electrolyte layer of an [Fe(CN)6]4−/3− redox couple and lithium ions, and an EC WO3 layer on ITO glass substrate. The widely used CdS/TiO2 PA in solar cells is preferred here due to its narrow band-gap as well as its light color.13,14 But the conventional redox couples of polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−)18 and I−/I3−,6 for QD solar cells are not suitable for our QDS-PECD due to corrosion to the electrodes and deep color, respectively. Instead, we choose an aqueous electrolyte containing Li+ as intercalation ions and [Fe(CN)6]4−/3− as the redox couple for the QD solar cell. The particular interest of the solution is its slight optical absorption and matched redox potential.24 A WO3 film is chosen as the EC electrode for the QDS-PECD due to its excellent weathering stability and large transmittance modulation in the visible and near-infrared regions.25–31

The mechanism of a quantum dot sensitized photoelectrochromic device in (d) discoloring and (e) coloring processes. In a short circuit, the photoelectrons transfer through the external circuit to color the WO3 film via intercalation of Li+. In an open circuit, the redox couple of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− consumes the electrons from the WO3 electrode, resulting in a discoloring process. TCO stands for transparent conductive oxide. 
The working mechanism of the designed QDS-PECD under light illumination is illustrated in Fig. 1d and e, where the left side (Fig. 1d) presents the neutral (discoloring) state of the device under an open circuit and the right side (Fig. 1e) presents the coloring state with a short circuit. Due to the narrow band-gap of 2.4 eV,32 CdS can be stimulated by the visible light to generate photoelectrons. As CdS has a higher conduction band (CB) than TiO2 does,33,34 excited electrons are supposed to transfer from the former to the latter.14,35 Meanwhile, the generated CdS(h+) holes in the PA would interact electrically with the redox couple in solution for electrical neutralization. Thus, these photoelectric processes on the PA electrode can be expressed in the following three equations: CdS + hν → CdS(h+ + e−)(1) CdS(h+ + e−) + TiO2 → CdS(h+) + TiO2(e−)(2) CdS(h+) + [Fe(CN)6]4− → CdS + [Fe(CN)6]3−(3)
If the circuit is short (Fig. 1e), the accumulated photoelectrons on the PA continuously transfer to the WO3 EC electrode through the external circuit. Then, two main reactions take place around the EC electrode. One is the electrochromic reaction by lithium ions and electron bi-intercalation into the WO3 electrode. The other is the reduction of the [Fe(CN)6]3− ions at the interface of the electrode/solution. Thus, the reactions around the EC electrode can be written as: xLi+ + xe− + WO3(transparent) → LixWO3(colored)(4) [Fe(CN)6]3− + e− → [Fe(CN)6]4−(5)
As a part of the reaction circle, the resulting [Fe(CN)6]4− ions diffuse to the PA electrode where they react with the CdS(h+) holes as shown in eqn (3). Thus, under constant irradiation of light, photoelectrons could be continuously generated and transferred to the EC electrode, thus keeping the colored state of the PECD.
When the circuit is open (Fig. 1d), the photo-generated electrons accumulate at the PA electrode again. Since no excited electrons could reach the WO3 EC electrode, the intercalated electrons in the LixWO3 film would be consumed by [Fe(CN)6]3− under the influence of the photo-induced inner electric field. Such a reaction (eqn (5)) results in a discoloring process.
In brief, under constant irradiation of visible light, the designed QDS-PECD can be controlled in a colored/discolored state simply by turning the external circuit on/off. In a dark environment, it remains discolored.
3.2. Structure analysis
The structure of the obtained PA and EC electrode was characterized using XRD. A typical result of the CdS(6)/TiO2 PA electrodes prepared with 6 cycles of the dipping/rinsing process is shown in Fig. 2a. The peaks at 25.39°, 37.77°, and 48.09° indicate that the TiO2 film is anatase (JCPDS 84-1286, tetragonal).36 The peaks at 25.39°, 37.77°, and 48.09° correspond to the interplanar spacing d = 3.51, 2.37, and 1.89 Å, respectively. And the lattice constants are a = b = 3.782 Å, and c = 9.502 Å. But CdS could not be identified from this measurement probably due to its very limited amount on the electrode surface or due to the overlap of peaks of the FTO substrate and TiO2. On the other hand, an amorphous structure of the WO3 EC electrode is identified due to the lack of peaks as shown in Fig. 2b. The only observed broad halo in the range of 23°–27° is identical to the amorphous structure.21 Further investigation to prove the presence of CdS on the prepared PA electrode was carried out by means of XPS and is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†

3.3. Morphology analysis
The morphologies of the prepared electrodes were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As a reference, a pure TiO2 electrode is examined, appearing to be fully stacked with uniform particles of about 40 nm in diameter (Fig. 3a). However, the morphology of the PA increases irregularly with the coating of CdS on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 3b). By using field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM), the details of the CdS(6)/TiO2 electrode are revealed (Fig. 3c). The CdS QDs appear to be particles of about 3 nm in diameter and are attached firmly to the surfaces of the TiO2 particles. The measured lattice spacing of 0.347 nm is assigned to the (110) plane of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 84-1286, tetragonal), whereas those of 0.33 and 0.29 nm are attributed to the (111) and (200) planes of CdS (JCPDS 80-0019, cubic), respectively. Noticeably, the surfaces of the TiO2 particles are not completely covered with CdS QDs. These defects may lead to an undesirable low solar conversion efficiency due to the charge recombination at the interface of the TiO2/electrolyte.37 Furthermore, the morphology of the WO3 EC electrode is also measured and presented in Fig. 3d. The WO3 EC electrode displays a relatively smooth surface without clear grain boundaries.

3.4. Tunable optical absorption of the photoanode
Unlike dye-based PA electrodes, the optical absorption properties of QD-based ones can be tuned simply by varying the QD deposition cycles. Fig. 4 shows the UV-vis absorption and transmittance properties of the CdS/TiO2 PA electrodes prepared with varied deposition cycles of n = 0–10. The color change from colorless to yellow demonstrates the effective deposition of CdS. For n = 0, the bare TiO2 electrode absorbs only ultraviolet light and appears transparent (inset in Fig. 4a). With an increase of the number n, the obtained CdS(n)/TiO2 electrodes absorb increasingly more light and extend their light absorption up to the visible region. And their colors are tuned from light yellow to orange as n increases from 2 to 10. The high transparency of the CdS(n)/TiO2 PA electrode, shown in Fig. 4b, meets the requirement for high-performance PECDs. Fig. 4 also shows that films with more than 6 layers present a lower transparency and a deeper color with their absorption edge shifting to a higher region. To achieve a larger optical modulation, a good transmittance of the PECD in the bleached state should be considered primarily. Hence, only CdS(n = 2, 4, 6)/TiO2 PA electrodes are used to fabricate QDS-PECDs.

3.5. Photoelectrochromic performance of the QDS-PECD

3.5.1. Photocurrent response. 
In order to study the photocurrent response characteristic of the as-fabricated CdS(n)/TiO2 (n = 2, 4, 6) photoelectrode, the transient photocurrent response was measured and is shown in Fig. 5. The reference and counter electrodes are Ag/Ag wire and Pt sheet, respectively. A bias of 0.5 V is applied on the CdS-modified TiO2 photoelectrode. It was notable that CdS(6)/TiO2 displayed a strong transient photocurrent response under xenon light illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a photocurrent density of 2.30 mA cm−2, which was about 4.42 times larger than that of the CdS(2)/TiO2 photoelectrode with a photocurrent density of 0.52 mA cm−2, indicating that the as-fabricated CdS(6)/TiO2 photoelectrode possess a higher separation efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers. It demonstrates that the photocurrent increased with the deposition cycle.

3.5.2. Optical transmittance. 
QDS-PECDs(n) were fabricated with EC electrodes and PA electrodes of CdS(n)/TiO2, where n = 2, 4, or 6. Their transmittance over visible light under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 is measured in situ. The results are shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Transmittance spectra of QDS-PECDs(n) in fully colored and discolored states from 400 nm to 750 nm. n stands for the number of cycles for depositing CdS. The dashed lines represent the discolored states of the QDS-PECDs(n), and the solid lines are for colored states. 
In the discolored state (dashed lines), for all three devices, the transmittance appears to be similar to the patterns of the corresponding PA electrodes (Fig. 6). This indicates that CdS determines the transmittance of the PECD in the discolored state. Among all the devices, QDS-PECD(2) presents the highest transparency. Especially, it even reaches 81% at 530 nm and 610 nm, which is much higher than that of conventional dye-based PECDs.3,5
On the other hand, all the devices in the colored state (solid lines) show a typical pattern of an EC WO3 electrode.38 WO3 absorbs most light in the red light and infrared regions. Additionally, transmittance of colored QDS-PECDs(n) decreases with increased n, exhibiting tunable photoelectrochromic performance. The lowest light transmission on average is about 10% for QDS-PECD(6). A red shift pattern of the transmittance peak for the QDS-PECDs(n) is observed as the absorption edge of the CdS sensitized PA shifts to a higher wavelength with the increased n for CdS coating cycles.
The transmittance modulation value ΔT(%) = T(%)discolored − T(%)colored, which reflects the performance of a PECD, is calculated and shown in Table 1. For QDS-PECD(2), it has the highest transparency although it presents a ΔT value of 60%. For QDS-PECD(4), the largest ΔT(%) is about 68% at 650 nm and above. For QDS-PECD(6), and in the red region, CdS(6)/TiO2 exhibits the largest ΔT value of about 70% and its transmittance modulation almost keeps constant in the infrared region. This property indicates that it inherits the infrared adjustment ability of WO3 to realize heat control.25 In recent works of dye-based PECDs, Wu et al. presented an optical contrast of about 45% at 788 nm,39 and Manca et al. demonstrated an optical contrast of about 45% at 780 nm.40 It demonstrates that the QDS-PECD in our present work not only presents tunable optical properties, but also exhibits an improved photoelectrochromic performance.

In further experiments, we found that all the devices worked well in a short circuit under illumination, but they did not work under an open circuit state or dark environment. It indicates that the electrons for coloring WO3 are the photo-induced electrons from the CdS QD sensitized PA. Furthermore, we also fabricated a pure TiO2 PA-based PECD. Such a device failed to work, which demonstrates that the photo-electrons are induced by CdS QDs on absorption of light. The results verify our proposed coloration mechanism.


3.5.3. Dynamic behavior. 
The dynamic behavior of coloring and discoloring of the devices is measured in situ by recording their transmittance pattern varying with time, as shown in Fig. 7. The coloring and discoloring processes of the QDS-PECDs(n) are achieved by adjusting the circuit state under constant illumination. At time t = 0, it means that a fully discolored or colored state of a device begins to change. It takes only several minutes for coloring to be completed while it is more than half an hour for discoloring. The detailed coloring process with time is shown in Fig. 7a, c, and e for devices QDS-PECD(2), QDS-PECD(4), and QDS-PECD(6), respectively, with their corresponding discoloring process in Fig. 7b, d, and f. As a result, a similar pattern appears for all three devices in the coloring and discoloring processes. A dramatic change is observed at the very beginning of coloring for all devices. To make the coloring and discoloring dynamics more clear, we plot transmittance as a function of time at 700 nm. The results are shown in Fig. 7g for coloring and Fig. 7h for discoloring. As the human eye has a maximum sensitivity to 550 nm, the time behaviour of the QDS-PECDs(n) monitored at 550 nm was also collected and is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). In Fig. 7, obviously, the coloring process occurs for all three devices in a rapid change within the first 30 seconds. And the whole response time for coloring is shortened with the increase of deposition cycles as shown in Table 1. On the contrary, the discoloring process seems to be slow. It takes about 30 minutes for QDS-PECD(2), 45 minutes for QDS-PECD(4), and 53 minutes for QDS-PECD(6) to go back to their fully discolored state. The distinguished dynamics between coloring and discoloring is attributed to their unique charge transfer mechanism. As coloring takes place with the external circuit being short, the photo-induced electrons move from the PA to EC electrode via a copper conductor. On the contrary, discoloring occurs with the external circuit being open, and the response time depends on the reaction between [Fe(CN)6]3− and the WO3 electrode under a built-in electric field, which is closely related to the charge transfer resistance at WO3 electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Compared to other WO3-based PECDs, the discoloring time of the QDS-PECDs is worse.4,39 It could be improved by using a platinized cathode to accelerate the oxidation reaction of reduced WO3 at the interface between the EC electrode and electrolyte.39
 Fig. 7  Dynamic coloring process (a, c and e) and discoloring process (b, d and f) of the QDS-PECDs(n) in a short and open circuit, respectively, with different operation time (coloring time from top to bottom: 0, 5 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 60 s, 120 s, 180 s, 240 s, and 300 s respectively; discoloring time from the bottom up: 0, 1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 30 min for QDS-PECD(2), 45 min for QDS-PECD(4), and 50 min and 53 min for QDS-PECD(6)). n stands for the number of cycles for depositing CdS. (g and h) The response time for the coloring and discoloring process at 700 nm. All the data are collected under illumination. 
For further explanation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed in a frequency range of 105–0.1 Hz under AM 1.5 illumination. The applied bias and AC amplitude were set at −0.6 V and 10 mV, respectively. Fig. 8 shows the impedance spectra for the QDS-PECD. By fitting the Nyquist plot data to an electrochemical model,41Rct1 values of 14100 Ω, 6799 Ω, and 2225 Ω were obtained and these stand for the charge transfer resistance at the EC electrode/electrolyte interfaces of QDS-PECD(2), QDS-PECD(4), and QDS-PECD(6), respectively. Obviously, the charge transfer resistances are much larger than that of a copper conductor in the coloring process, resulting in a longer discoloring time.

We also fabricated a QDS-PECD without a redox couple. After coloring the device with external potential, it failed to discolor, which demonstrates that the reaction between [Fe(CN)6]3− and the WO3 electrode contributes to the discoloring process. On the other hand, the delayed response time with deposition cycles could be ascribed to the increase of intercalated charges that are photo-induced by the CdS QDs. To shorten the response time, optimizing the ratios of [Fe(CN)6]4−/3− and activating the EC electrode would be our further work.


3.5.4. Photocoloration efficiency. 
The photocoloration efficiency (phCE) of a PECD stands for the photoelectrochromic performance per unit light intensity illuminated per minute.10 It could be calculated by the following equation:9 (6)wherein f(λ) is the relative sensitivity of the human eye in the photopic state and T(λ) is the measured transmittance spectrum of the device. Using eqn (6), Tlum in the bleached state (Tlum,bleached) and Tlum in the colored state (Tlum,colored) at 5 min of QDS-PECD(6) are calculated to be 65.61% and 14.46%, indicating a contrast of 4.53:1. The contrasts for QDS-PECD(2) and QDS-PECD(4) are calculated to be 3.04:1 and 3.91:1, respectively. It indicates that QDS-PECD(6) performs better.
For further study, the phCElum for all the devices is calculated by following eqn (7):9 (7)with Tlum,bleached and Tlum,colored being the luminous transmittance in the bleached and colored state, respectively, ΔODlum being the change in optical density, GΓ being the total solar intensity for incidence normal to the device (in W cm−2), and t being the exposure time (in minutes). The phCElum values of all the devices as a function of coloration time are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the phCE values of the QDS-PECDs(n) increase as n increases and QDS-PECD(6) achieves the best photoelectrochromic performance as 6 layer CdS QDs provide more photoelectrons in an equivalent time. Compared to the conventional device, the QDS-PECDs demonstrate a higher phCE as all the devices undergo rapid coloration in seconds.

3.6. Photovoltaic conversion
To characterize the photovoltaic conversion performance, the current–potential (J–V) characteristics of the devices are measured. The samples have an effective square area of 0.55 cm2 and are tested under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The results are shown in Fig. 10. The open circuit voltage (Voc) of all the QDS-PECDs is measured to be around 0.33 V, and the short circuit current (Jsc) increases from 0.14 mA cm−2 to 0.88 mA cm−2 and the photovoltaic conversion efficiency increases from 0.001% to 0.12% with an increase of deposition cycles n from 0 to 6. All the devices demonstrate fairly poor performance in photoelectric conversion in comparison with conventional solar cells. This insufficient conversion may come from: (i) poor regeneration of the oxidized redox species in the cathode because most of the photocarriers generated in the PA are consumed in photoelectrochromic reactions; (ii) the unsuitability of the redox couple or the WO3 electrode for this type of quantum dot sensitized solar device; and (iii) low light absorption of the PA electrode for meeting the high transparency of QDS-PECDs. However, in spite of the poor results as a solar cell, all the devices have demonstrated an excellent performance as a PECD.

Besides, improvement of the photovoltaic function may be achieved in the future by (i) limiting the charge recombination at the interface of PA and electrolyte, (ii) optimizing the proportion of [Fe(CN)6]4−/3− or finding a more suitable redox couple, and (iii) lowering the charge transfer resistance between electrolyte and the electrodes.
4. Conclusions
Quantum dot sensitized photoelectrochromic devices, containing CdS quantum dots as a photovoltaic sensitizer and WO3 as an electrochromic electrode, have been fabricated and tested for their performances. Their optical properties can be tuned simply by changing the procedure for preparing the CdS/TiO2 photoanode. A transparency of about 81% and transmittance modulation of 70% have been achieved at wavelengths in the visible light region. Coloring of a device takes only 2–3 minutes, whereas discoloring takes more than half an hour, depending on the mechanism of charge transfer. The device based on 6 layers of CdS shows the optimized performance, as it achieves the largest optical contrast, photocoloration efficiency, and power conversion efficiency. This study has developed a self-powered electrochromic device by embedding quantum dots as the photon harvester, showing promise in applications of smart windows, displays, and transparent solar cells.
