1. Introduction
With the increasing requirements of reliable and environmentally friendly energy resources, electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems (such as batteries, supercapacitors (SCs) and water splitting) have attracted intense interest in the past decades,1–6 which promotes the discovery and optimization of new high-performance materials. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials have evoked extensive studies in electrochemistry due to their high specific surface area, unique structure and rich physicochemical properties. For example, owing to the superior electrical conductivity, high theoretical surface-to-mass ratio (∼2600 m2 g−1) and flexibility, graphene illustrates a promising potential to store electric charge and ions.7–9 Up to now, a wide variety of 2D materials have been successfully obtained with tunable intrinsic physicochemical properties, including transitional metal oxides,10,11 carbides,12–14 dichalcogenides15,16 and layered double hydroxides,17–20 which are regarded as excellent candidates for electrochemical energy storage and conversion.
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are typical inorganic layered materials which can be described by the general formula [MII1−xMIIIx(OH)2]z+(An−)z/n·yH2O, in which MII and MIII are divalent (e.g., Mg2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+, or Fe2+) and trivalent cations (e.g., Al3+, Fe3+, Cr3+ or Ga3+), respectively; An− is the interlayer anion compensating for the positive charge of the brucite-like layers. The easy tunability of metal ions without altering the structure as well as anion exchange properties of LDHs make them interesting alternatives for applications in catalysis,21–23 adsorption,24,25 biology,26,27 energy storage and conversion.28–30 Moreover, the high dispersion of active species in a layered matrix, the facile exfoliation into monolayer nanosheets and chemical modification open new opportunities for LDHs as multifunctional electrodes. Based on the intriguing features mentioned above, progress toward LDH-based electrodes has largely benefited from the increasing development of advanced materials with well-controlled compositions (including host layers and guest molecules), tunable nanostructures (from nanoparticles to hierarchical architectures) and hybrid nanocomposites.
In this review, we will comprehensively summarize recent progress in the strategies of electrode modification by using LDHs, including in situ growth, electrodeposition and layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly. Subsequently, various nanostructures of LDHs (e.g., microspheres and nanoplatelet arrays) as well as their nanocomposites (e.g. LDH/carbon and LDH/polymer) with excellent electrochemical performances in supercapacitors, batteries and electrocatalysis will be introduced. Current challenges and future strategies are also discussed from the viewpoint of the material design and practical application. It is anticipated that this feature article will focus more attention toward the electrochemical properties of LDH-based materials and encourage future work in this exciting area.
2. The preparation of LDH-based electrodes
In spite of large potential in electrochemical energy storage and conversion for LDH materials, the time- and cost-effective modification of electrodes is the first challenge to explore their fascinating electrochemical properties and broad applications. To date, a number of methods have been used for the deposition of LDH nanoparticles on the surface of conducting substrates. It is known that the pre-synthesized LDH nanoparticle suspension can be directly introduced onto the electrode by the traditional dipping or spin-coating method. However, these approaches usually lead to the aggregation of nanoparticles and thereby largely limit their electrochemical performances. In this section, we aim to briefly summarize several different routes for the fabrication of LDH-based electrodes with high disperse and ordered nanostructures by in situ growth, electrodeposition and LBL assembly methods.
2.1. 
          In situ growth
LDH nanoplatelet arrays with direct growth on the surface of conducting substrates (conducting glasses, papers, clothes or metals) have evoked increasing interest as a result of their largely improved conductivity, efficient exposure of active sites and simplified electrode manufacturing process, in comparison with LDH powdered samples. In situ growth of LDHs usually results in an oriented and rigid nanoplatelet array architecture, which allows an easy access of electrolytes to the entire nanosheets and thereby improves the overall performance of LDH-based electrodes. Liu et al.31 first reported a facile synthesis of CoFe-LDH nanowall arrays (NWAs) robustly built on a flexible Fe–Co–Ni substrate through a hydrothermal method. An ultrasonication test of 30 min toward the as-made CoFe-LDH NWAs has demonstrated their ultra-robust mechanical adhesion to the substrate (Fig. 1a and b). Zhang et al.32 prepared thin films of NiAl-LDH on Ni foil and Ni foam substrates by secondary (seeded) growth of the NiAl-LDH seed layer. The preparation procedure consists of deposition of LDH seeds from a colloidal suspension on the substrate via dip coating, followed by a hydrothermal treatment of the nanocrystals to form the LDH film. The secondary grown film is found to provide a higher crystallinity and more uniform composition of metal cations than the in situ grown film on the seed-free substrate under identical hydrothermal conditions. Han et al.33 further demonstrated a CoAl-LDH nanoplatelet array grown on a flexible Ni foil substrate by using urea as an alkali source and NH4F as a growth assisting agent. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CoAl-LDH film on Ni foil and the corresponding powdered sample scraped from the film are rather different. For the LDH film on a Ni substrate, the absence of [00l] reflections indicates a preferential orientation of LDH crystallites with their ab plane perpendicular to the substrate. Chen et al.34 presented a facile one-step method of growing CoNi-LDH films with ultrathin nanosheets and porous nanostructures for supercapacitors using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as an assisting agent but without any adscititious alkali (urea and hexamine) sources and oxidants. They indicated that the surfactant CTAB might selectively stabilize the exposed planes of nanosheets and finally improve the size uniformity of nanosheets through electrostatic interaction between the ionic head-groups of CTAB and the OH− groups of CoNi-LDH nanosheets. Our group35 synthesized NiMn-LDH on a carbon nanotube (CNT) backbone by the chemical modification of the CNT surface with functional groups (e.g., –OH−, –CO, –COO−) (Fig. 1c). It was found that the improvement of hydrophilic treatment by modification was crucial to the subsequent growth of LDHs. Similarly, Lu et al.36 fabricated 3D films of vertically aligned NiFe-LDH nanoplates loaded on nickel foam as electrodes for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by a simple hydrothermal method without using a growth assisting agent. As demonstrated above, the formation of the LDH crystal nucleus on the surface of substrates is a key step for the in situ synthesis approach, which can be achieved by directly activating metal substrates, introducing LDH seeds as well as creating molecular interaction between the LDH nucleus and the substrates.

2.2. Electrodeposition
The fast and facile electrochemical synthesis route has also been developed for the fabrication of LDHs electrodes.37–46 Generally, electrodeposition was developed using nitrate or sulfate solutions containing appropriate metal ions. Deposition can be achieved by reducing nitrate or sulfate ions to generate hydroxide ions that elevate the local pH on the working electrode, resulting in the precipitation of the corresponding LDHs: NO3− + H2O + 2e → NO2− + 2OH−(1) SO42− + H2O + 2e → SO32− + 2OH−(2) The deposition potential, pH value of the plating solution, metal type and M2+/M3+ ratio play a great role in determining the purity and crystallinity of the resulting LDH materials. Dennis et al.42 studied series nickel-based hydroxides by the electrocoprecipitation method from metal nitrate solutions in 1989. Yarger et al.43 investigated the preparation of ZnAl-LDH films by the electrochemical process. It was found that the optimum deposition potential for pure and well-ordered ZnAl-LDH films was −1.65 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 4 M KCl reference electrode at room temperature, using a solution containing 12.5 mM Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 7.5 mM Al(NO3)3·9H2O with a pH value of 3.8. Increasing and decreasing the aluminum concentration in the plating solution results in the formation of Al- and Zn-containing impurities, respectively. Gupta et al.44 reported a nanostructured CoNi-LDH onto stainless steel electrodes by the potentiostatic deposition method at −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl using various molar ratios of Co(NO3)2 and Ni(NO3)2 in distilled water. Li et al.45 prepared ZnCo-LDH films using zinc sulfate heptahydrate (ZnSO4·7H2O) and cobalt(II) sulfate. In order to partially oxidize cobalt(II) to cobalt(III), H2O2 solution was added to the bath solution. The as-deposited ZnCo-LDH films on Ni foil were composed of highly oriented nanowalls with the ab plane vertical to the substrate. Furthermore, Fe-containing LDHs with different divalent metal ions have also been obtained by using the electrosynthesis method (Fig. 2) by our group.46 The electrochemical synthesis is achieved by the reduction reaction occurring on the working electrode, in which the resulting OH− leads to the precipitation of MxFe1−x(OH)2. The as-synthesized MxFe1−x(OH)2 material presents a light green color; after exposure to air for ∼1 h, the sample color changes from green to a brownish one, indicating the occurrence of self-oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+. By using this method, ultrathin MFe-LDH (M = Ni, Co and Li) nanoplatelets (200–300 nm in lateral length; 8–12 nm in thickness) perpendicular to the substrate surface are directly prepared within hundreds of seconds (<300 s) under cathodic potential (Fig. 2b–d). Therefore, the electrosynthesis method provides a fast and effective approach for the preparation of LDHs films with controlled compositions and nanostructures. Moreover, various conducting substrates can be used for the fabrication of advanced LDH electrodes with prospective applications.

2.3. Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly
The LBL strategy has been effectively used to modify electrodes, since the nanometer scale control over the assembly process usually gives a high dispersion of electroactive species with uniform orientation. LDH microcrystals can be exfoliated into positively-charged 2D monolayer sheets, which are assembled alternately with various functional anions by the LBL technique.47–51 Recently, a large number of functional electrodes have been developed through alternating assembly of positively-charged LDH nanosheets and negatively-charged species (small molecules, metal complex, macromolecules or polymers) or anionic nanoparticles (Au, CdS or graphene oxides GO). For example, the exfoliated CoAl-LDH nanosheets were assembled alternately with negatively-charged iron(III) porphyrin on an ITO substrate.52 The LBL assembly process of the multilayer films is monitored by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy; the intensities of the absorption bands of iron(III) porphyrin correlate linearly with the bilayer number, indicating that almost equal amounts of guest molecules are incorporated into the films during each cycle. Moreover, the heterogeneous film thickness can be precisely controlled by simple manipulation. To date, several LDH/functional molecule ultrathin films have been prepared by using the LBL technique, including CoAl-LDH/naphthol green B, MgAl-LDH/cobalt phthalocyanine,53 CoAl-LDH/ruthenium(II) complex,54 NiAl-LDH/bi-protein,55 which display promising electrochemical activity. In addition, negatively-charged nanoparticles can also be used to assemble with LDH-based building blocks. Dong et al.56 fabricated multilayer films of CoAl-LDH nanosheets (CoAl-LDH-NS) and GO through electrostatic LBL assembly, which has demonstrated with exceptional uniformity and versatility. The resulting CoAl-LDH-NS/GO multilayer films exhibit a high specific capacitance and good cycle stability. Our group reported ZnAl-LDH/Au nanoparticle (AuNPs) ultrathin films fabricated by the LBL assembly technique.57 The results illustrate that the obtained ZnAl-LDH/AuNP films possess long-range order stacking in the normal direction of the substrate and a high dispersion of AuNPs on the surface of LDH nanosheets without aggregation. This guarantees their efficient electrocatalytic performance for the oxidation of glucose.
Recently, superlattice heterostructures composed of LDH monolayers and negatively-charged counterparts have been obtained by the electrostatic LBL assembly route. Yang et al.58 dispersed a Cl− intercalated FeNi-LDH into a GO aqueous suspension to obtain an FeNi-LDH/GO heterostructure. The mixture was magnetically stirred for ten days to ensure the exfoliation of LDHs and the subsequent assembly of GO with FeNi-LDH nanosheets. Our group reported a molecular-scale hybrid system based on the assembly of exfoliated CoNi-LDH nanosheets and the conducting polymer (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate), denoted as PEDOT:PSS) via an electrostatic interaction (Fig. 3).59 As shown in Fig. 3b–d, the resulting LDH/PEDOT:PSS material gives a well-ordered and layer-shaped structure. This as-synthesized organic–inorganic composite with molecular-scale distribution of active species shows a largely improved capacitance and rate capability. The LDH-based films or superlattice heterostructures obtained by the LBL self-assembly can successively inherit the intrinsic properties of both the LDHs and the counterpart; these LDH-based film materials can be constructed by rational control over the driving force, building unit as well as the substrate.

As demonstrated above, the three methods (in situ growth, electrodeposition and LBL assembly) have been demonstrated as effective strategies in the preparation of LDH-based electrodes. For the in situ growth method, rigid LDH nanoplatelet arrays with tunable composition can be prepared on the surface of various substrates (e.g., conducting glass, metal sheets, carbon fibers and nanotubes); however, this method normally suffers from harsh preparation conditions, such as high temperature and a time-consuming process. Alternatively, the electrodeposition method for the fabrication of LDH electrodes effectively accelerates the preparation process even within hundreds of seconds at room temperature, with the restriction of transition metal-containing LDHs (e.g. Co, Ni, Fe, Zn) on conducting substrates. The LBL assembly method is a recently developed approach, which enables preparation of LDH-based electrodes with nanometer scale control over superlattice heterostructures, uniformity and versatility. In most cases, however, the unsatisfactory surface area of LBL film materials limits their applications in large current devices, such as supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries.
3. The LDH-based electroactive materials
LDHs materials are typical pseudocapacitive active species due to their abundant redox active sites. However, these materials often suffer from a low power performance and poor cycle life since the redox kinetics is limited by the rate of mass diffusion and electron transfer. To solve these problems, two strategies have been taken into account: (1) well-defined micro/nanostructures with a high surface area and suitable pore-size distribution is urgently needed, in which all the electroactive species participate in faradic redox reactions and a fast mass and electron transfer is guaranteed; (2) combination of LDHs with conductive matrices with improved system conductivity and electron transfer ability. Recently, some efforts have been made to improve the electrochemical performances of LDHs by creating nanostructures and hybridizing with carbon materials or conducting polymers.
3.1. The hierarchical LDH nanostructures
Hierarchical LDH nanostructures, especially the hollow or core–shell spheres are of great scientific and technological importance because of their specific nanostructure, high surface area and abundant mesopores.60–62 Recently, stimulated by the promising electrochemical applications, a number of studies have been carried out on the synthesis of LDH microspheres by using templates or direct precipitation reactions. As an effective template, silica has been widely used to synthesize LDH microspheres, especially hollow structures. For instance, NiAl-LDH microspheres with a tunable interior architecture from core–shell to hollow structure have been obtained by LBL deposition of AlOOH on the surface of SiO2 followed an in situ growth technique (Fig. 4).63 It was found that the mesopores appeared gradually with the shrinking of the SiO2 core, which thereby improved their pseudocapacitance property. Xu et al.64 synthesized nitrogen-enriched carbon/NiAl-LDH (N–C@LDH) hollow microspheres by using SiO2@resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) as a template, which gave a satisfactory electrochemical performance due to the N-doping enhanced conductivity, a large specific area and a favorable porous structure. In addition, LDH spherical architectures have also been fabricated by using amorphous aluminum hydroxide (AAH) as a template.65 Growth of such a unique structure undergoes preorganization of primary nanospheres of colloidal AAH in solution, followed by the nucleation and crystallization of LDH from exterior to interior of AAH spheres via an in situ transformation mechanism. Recently, our group further demonstrated hierarchical MgFe-LDH microspheres with tunable interior structures synthesized by a surfactant-template method,66 which displayed a three-dimensional architecture with hollow, yolk–shell and solid interior structures, respectively. Interestingly, the hollow LDH microspheres present the maximum specific surface area and the richest mesopores distribution (2–6 nm), much superior to those of yolk–shell and solid LDH microspheres. Moreover, the hollow MgFe-LDH microspheres exhibit excellent electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol in alkaline solution, including high activity, long-term durability and cycling stability, owing to the significantly improved Faradaic redox reaction and mass transport. It is clear that the structure and morphology of LDH spheres synthesized by a hard or soft template depend on both starting raw materials and synthetic parameters including the reaction time, reaction temperature, and pH value.

3.2. The LDH-based nanocomposites

3.2.1. LDH/carbon. 
Although much progress has been made, the efficiency of LDH materials in the field of electrochemical energy storage and conversion is mainly limited by the relatively sluggish charge transfer properties. To solve this problem, LDH/carbon nanocomposites with superior charge mobility and high surface areas have been developed for efficient electrode materials, such as LDH/graphene,67–69 LDH/CNT70–74 and LDH/carbon quantum dots.75,76 Typically, graphene with a two-dimensional honeycomb-like crystal lattice shows several unique properties such as high electron mobility, a large surface area, and environmental stability, which are highly desirable as a 2D catalyst support.77 Recently, some attempts have been made to combine LDHs with graphene to enhance their electrochemical performance. Wang et al. synthesized a hybrid material composed of graphene nanosheets and NiAl-LDH platelets (GNS/NiAl-LDH) under mild hydrothermal conditions.78 The NiAl-LDH platelets were homogeneously anchored onto the surfaces of GNSs as spacers to keep the neighboring sheets separate, giving rise to improved specific capacitance and stability. Graphene/CoAl-LDH hybrid composites were also fabricated by using the hydrothermal procedure, demonstrating promising electrochemical properties.79 To further disperse LDH nanoparticles on the surface of graphene, Zhang et al.80 reported a novel NiFe-LDH/graphene hybrid prepared by means of defect-anchored nucleation and spatially confined growth of nanometer-sized NiFe LDHs into a mesoporous graphene framework (Fig. 5). It is found that the nitrogen dopant and topology-induced defects of graphene contribute to the adsorption and anchoring of metal cations; and the in-plane mesopores serve as nanoreactors for spatially confined nucleation and growth of NiFe-LDH. As a result, the hierarchical NiFe-LDH/graphene structure demonstrates an enhanced activity and durability for oxygen evolution under alkaline conditions.

In addition, a sandwich-structured rGO/NiAl-LDH composite with LDH nanosheet arrays grown perpendicular to the surface of graphene was prepared,81 which shows a high surface area and enhanced electrochemical performance (Fig. 6). The synthesis process for this hierarchical rGO/NiAl-LDH composite involves coating AlOOH colloids onto the surfaces of graphene and the subsequent in situ growth of NiAl-LDH nanosheet arrays via a hydrothermal process (Fig. 6a). As shown in Fig. 6b and c, the LDH nanosheet arrays are perpendicularly oriented on both sides of the graphene sheets, efficiently avoiding the stacking and aggregation of individual graphene sheets and leading to an interesting sandwich structure. The as-obtained hierarchical composite has a large specific surface area and typical mesoporous characteristics, which are favorable for achieving high pseudocapacitance performance.

Another feasible way of creating LDH/graphene nanostructures is using the exfoliated LDH nanosheets (LDH-NS) as building blocks to assembly with graphene. For example, Jin et al.82 demonstrated a CoAl-LDH-NS/GO composite by assembling two kinds of one-atom-thick sheets (carboxylated GO and CoAl-LDH-NS) for the pseudocapacitance application. Furthermore, assisted by the electrostatic attraction, the GO nanosheets with multifunctional oxygenic groups can be assembled with the exfoliated NiFe-LDH sheets in aqueous solution, forming a charge balancing interlayer in the resulting hybrid composite.83 The synergy between the catalytic activity of the NiFe-LDH and the enhanced electron transport arising from graphene gives rise to superior electrocatalytic properties of the NiFe-LDH/rGO hybrid toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
The exchangeable property of interlayer anions in LDHs evokes great interest in the construction of host–guest intercalation structures with desirable properties by using LDHs as host materials.84–86 By an ion-exchange process, various organic anions have been intercalated into the interlayer space of LDHs. Carbonization of these intercalated LDHs under inert conditions gives access to a variety of interesting carbonaceous nanocomposites, which provides another effective method for the fabrication of hierarchical nanocomposites based on LDHs and nanocarbon materials. Relative developments have been comprehensively reviewed by Zhang and Wei's group.87 Herein, we summarized the very recently reported carbon materials synthesized by using LDHs as “nanoreactors”. Yang et al.88 investigated a “bottom-up” synthesis of carbon nanorings (CNRs) by taking advantage of the confined space of the 2D interlayer galleries of the LDH host to limit the in situ growth of CNRs. The CoAl-LDH containing co-intercalated dodecyl sulfonate (DSO) anions and methyl methacrylate (MMA) (CoAl-DSO-MMA-LDH) was synthesized in a one-step reaction (Fig. 7a), followed by calcination in an argon atmosphere at 800 °C. During calcination, the thermal decomposition of the LDH host was accompanied by collapse and shrinkage of the interlayer galleries, resulting in a material with a reduced interlayer spacing of ∼1.3 nm (Fig. 7b). It was found that Co nanoparticles embedded in the amorphous product could effectively catalyze the growth of CNRs (Fig. 7c). A similar method has also been used in the confined synthesis of graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Lu et al.89 obtained single-layered GQDs by the hydrothermal treatment of intercalated citrate in the confined space of the MgAl-LDH gallery in the presence of ammonia at 180 °C for 8 h. The obtained solid MgAl-GQD-LDH was then etched with hydrochloric acid to produce the GQD colloidal solution.

3.2.2. LDH/conducting polymer. 
Conducting polymers (CPs) such as polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI) and poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) have attracted increasing interest as electrode materials due to their high electrical conductivity, efficient redox active sites as well as low cost.90–92 The rational design of novel electrodes based on CPs and LDHs is highly effective for achieving high performances in energy storage and conversion. It is found that the hydrophobically treated LDH nanoparticles can be directly used to adsorb CPs. Leuteritz et al.93 presented the dodecylbenzenesulfonate intercalated MgAl-LDH based on the regeneration method, which was further modified with PANI using the solution adsorption method. Despite some agglomeration of LDH/PANI nanoparticles, a continuous phase of PANI was not observed in this composite. This highly-dispersed PANI modified LDHs gave a desirable conductivity. To obtain a more ordered structure, the exfoliated ZnAl-LDH nanosheets/PANI multilayer films on silicon wafer substrates have been fabricated by using the LBL assembly method.94 The surface of the films is microscopic smooth and uniform with a thickness of 2 nm per bilayer. In addition, CPs can be directly deposited on the surface of LDH nanoplatelets to fabricate ordered hybrid electrodes to improve the conductivity and electrochemical performances. For instance, in order to improve the conductivity of the as-grown CoAl-LDH nanoplatelet array (NPA), a thin layer of PEDOT was coated onto the surface of LDH NPA via a potentiostatic electrodeposition method by our group (Fig. 8a–c).33 The resulting CoAl-LDH@PEDOT core–shell architecture provides a large specific surface area and excellent conductivity, which guarantees the effective redox reaction and fast electron transport between the electroactive center and the current collector. Practically, CPs usually suffer from a considerable volume change during the repeated intercalation and depletion of ions in the charge and discharge process, which largely decrease their mechanical stability.95,96 To solve this problem, we further used the PPy nanowires (NWs) as the core and CoNi-LDH nanoplatelets as the shell to fabricate a sophisticated nanoarray composite via a two-step electrosynthesis method (Fig. 8d–f).97 In view of this PPy@CoNi-LDH core–shell system, the PPy core serves as a conductive network to facilitate the electron collection and fast transport; while the LDH shell acts as a protection layer to inhibit the volumetric swelling/shrinking of PPy during long-term charge/discharge cycling.

4. The electrochemical applications
4.1. Supercapacitors
Supercapacitors (SCs) are considered as promising candidates for next-generation power devices because of their advantages of fast charging and discharging properties, high power delivery, and excellent cycling lifespans in comparison with conventional batteries and dielectric capacitors. On the basis of the charge storage mechanisms, electrochemical SCs are broadly divided into electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. In particular, pseudocapacitors entail reversible faradic redox reactions on the surface of an electro-active material for charge storage and have a higher specific capacitance value of 10–100 times that of EDLCs.98 Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as a typical class of 2D structure anionic clays have been reported as excellent candidates for pseudocapacitors owing to their high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, LDH materials often suffer from a low power density and cycle life because the redox kinetics is limited by the rate of mass diffusion and electron transfer. For example, a CoAl-LDH nanoparticle material synthesized by the traditional coprecipitation method only provides a limited specific capacitance (145 F g−1 at 2 A g−1).99 To solve the problem, some efforts have been made to improve the performance of LDH-based SCs by creating nanostructures (such as core/shell nanowires or microfibers, nanowall films) or incorporating with conductive graphene or polymers. As demonstrated above, the core–shell LDH microspheres with tunable interior architectures can be synthesized by using silica as a hard template.100 Interestingly, the specific capacitance of hollow NiAl-LDH microspheres reaches 735 F g−1 (at 2 A g−1), much larger than that of core–shell (406 F g−1) and yolk–shell (524 F g−1) microspheres as well as LDH nanoparticles (117 F g−1). In addition, the hollow microspheres show good cycle performance (the capacitance increases 16.5% after 1000 cycles at a high charge/discharge current density of 8 A g−1) and remarkable rate capability (75% capacitance is retained at a large current density of 25 A g−1). The enhancement of capacitance can be attributed to the large surface area and optimal pore-size of the hierarchical hollow microspheres, which guarantee the high specific capacitance and excellent cycle stability.
Development of LDH nanoplatelet on conductive substrates with well-defined architectures is an approach for enhancing ion and charge-carrier transport. It has been reported that CoNi-LDH arrays on a nickel foam electrode display a significantly enhanced specific capacitance (2682 F g−1 at 3 A g−1, based on active materials) and energy density (77.3 W h kg−1 at 623 W kg−1), as well as good stability (∼82% of its original capacitance after 5000 cycles).34 NiMn-LDH microcrystals grafted on a carbon nanotube (CNT) backbone can deliver a maximum specific capacitance of 2960 F g−1 (at 1.5 A g−1) and excellent rate capability (79.5% retention at 30 A g−1).35 CoMn-LDH growing on flexible carbon fibers (CF) via an in situ growth approach was also demonstrated by our group.101 The resulting CoMn-LDH/CF electrode delivers a high specific capacitance (1079 F g−1 at 2.1 A g−1) and excellent rate capability even at a rather high current density (82.5% capacitance retention at 42.0 A g−1). Furthermore, a flexible solid-state supercapacitor device fabricated by using the CoMn-LDH/CFs achieves a specific energy of up to 126.1 W h kg−1 and a specific power of 65.6 kW kg−1. Recently, the core–shell NiCo-LDH@CNT-based supercapacitor was presented with excellent performances: a maximum energy density of 89.7 W h kg−1 with an operational voltage of 1.75 V, and a maximum power density of 8.7 kW kg−1 at an energy density of 41.7 W h kg−1.72 Graphene, with high charge mobility and surface area, has been effectively used to support LDHs materials for efficient SCs. As a result, the NiAl-LDH/graphene composite exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 781.5 F g−1 and an excellent cycle life with an increased specific capacitance of 22.5% after 200 cycle tests.78 The CoNi-LDH/rGO superlattice composites show a high specific capacitance (∼500 F g−1) at a discharge current up to 30 A g−1, as well as excellent stability.102 In addition, Wu et al.69 reported a facile strategy to fabricate integrated porous CoAl hydroxide nanosheets (named as GSP-LDH) with dodecyl sulfate anions and graphene sheets as structural and conductive supports, respectively. Owing to the fast ion/electron transport, the GSP-LDH electrode exhibits remarkably improved electrochemical characteristics, including a high specific capacitance (1043 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), ultra-high rate performance capability (912 F g−1 at 20 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (∼84% of the initial capacitance retention after 2000 cycles).
In addition to the carbon materials, the construction of LDH/conducting polymer nanocomposites provides another effective route to obtain satisfactory overall supercapacitive performance, owing to the greatly improved charge transport in the electrochemical process. Recently, a molecular-scale hybrid system is constructed based on the self-assembly of CoNi-LDH monolayers and the conducting polymer (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate), denoted as PEDOT:PSS) into an alternating-layer superlattice.59 Owing to the homogeneous interface and intimate interaction, the resulting CoNi-LDH/PEDOT:PSS hybrid materials possess a simultaneous enhancement in ion and charge-carrier transport, which exhibit improved capacitive properties with a high specific capacitance (960 F g−1 at 2 A g−1) and excellent rate capability (83.7% retention at 30 A g−1). Moreover, CoAl-LDH nanoplatelet array modified by PEDOT shows a maximum specific capacitance of 649 F g−1 by cyclic voltammetry (scan rate: 2 mV s−1) and 672 F g−1 by galvanostatic discharge (1 A g−1).33 Furthermore, the hybrid CoAl-LDH@PEDOT electrode also exhibits excellent rate capability with a specific energy of 39.4 W h kg−1 (40 A g−1), as well as good long-term cycling stability (92.5% of its original capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles). A sophisticated nanoarray consisting of the PPy core and the LDH shell via a two-step electrosynthesis method was presented.97 The specific capacitance of the PPy@CoNi-LDH core–shell NWs array (2342 F g−1; current density 1 A g−1) is 2.1, 2.6, and 1.2 times higher than that of pristine PPy (1137 F g−1), CoNi-LDH (897 F g−1), and the summation of these two constitutes (2034 F g−1), respectively. The specific capacitance enhancement of PPy@LDH is attributed to the synergetic effect of the PPy core and the LDH shell. The all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device fabricated with PPy@CoNi-LDH electrode materials gives an energy density of ∼46 W h kg−1 (at 2.4 kW kg−1), a power density of ∼12 kW kg−1 (at 11.3 W h kg−1), and a long life time (20000 cycles). Recently, LDH-based SCs electrodes have been widely developed and the typical studies are summarized in Table 1.

4.2. Li-ion batteries
Compared with traditional lead-acid and Ni-based batteries, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) show advantages of high energy density, high operating voltage, long cycling life and environmental compatibility.111–113 However, the demands for batteries with higher power/energy densities and longer cycling lives for the development of newly emerging electronic devices are still unsatisfied; the promising electrode materials as one of the key issues for the high performance of LIBs are still urgent. The wide tunability of metal ions without altering the structure of LDHs, and the transformation of LDHs into the corresponding metal oxides via calcination make them highly-active anode materials for LIBs. Recently, a pure NiFe2O4 spinel has been prepared from a NiFe2+Fe3+-LDH precursor after calcination at 700 °C, which showed an initial discharge capacity of 1239 mA h g−1 and a reversible capacity of 701 mA h g−1.114 The major advantage of the LDH precursor method for the synthesis of NiFe2O4 is that it affords a spinel with a small particle size and uniform distribution of metal cations, which facilitates the active site exposure and the Li-ion intercalation. To enhance the performance of LDH derived spinel, carbon coated CoFe mixed oxide nanowall arrays were evolved from thermal decomposition of CoFe-LDH precursors and carbonization of glucose.115 The obtained carbon coated CoFe mixed oxide with improved electrical conductivity exhibits superior electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity and cyclability compared with a carbon-free sample.
Carbon materials themselves have been widely used in LIBs because of their high surface area, extraordinary electronic and mechanical properties and low cost. However, obtaining highly dispersed and ordered carbon materials with improved performance for LIBs is still a challenge. Recently, it was found that LDHs can be effectively used to direct the growth of carbon materials with controlled nanostructures. As a typical example, metal oxide nanoflakes derived from LDH precursors were employed as the template for the epitaxial growth of unstacked graphene via chemical vapour deposition.116 The unstacked graphene was used for high-power lithium–sulphur batteries with excellent high-rate performance due to the fast charge/discharge process.
Similarly, graphene microspheres (GMSs) with hierarchical porous architectures were further obtained by using calcined LDH microspheres as templates, which were employed as carbon scaffolds to accommodate sulfur for rechargeable lithium–sulfur batteries.117 As a result, an initial areal discharge capacity of 2.67 mA h cm−2 was obtained at a current density of 0.83 mA cm−2 on a flexible GMS paper electrode with an areal sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm−2. In addition, a facile method to fabricate carbon nanorings (CNRs) via catalytic growth in the confined space of LDHs was also developed.118 The CNR electrode shows a reversible specific capacity of 1263 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles and the Coulombic efficiency increases to nearly 100%. The specific capacities are 1216, 939, 758 and 508 mA h g−1 at current densities of 1, 4.8, 15 and 45 A g−1, corresponding to capacity retention ratios of 98%, 76%, 61% and 41%, respectively.
As discussed above, the LDH derived metal oxides/spinels and carbon materials synthesized by using the confined space of LDHs have demonstrated large potential for the advanced Li-ion batteries. The specific layered structure, tunable metal ions and intercalation properties give LDHs a good chance to directly accommodate metal ions. Unfortunately, the LDHs themselves used as electro-active materials to store cations for efficient energy storage devices have not been effectively investigated until now.
4.3. Electrochemical catalysis
Water splitting by direct electrolysis (2H2O → O2 + 2H2) provides a potential pathway for the production of clean, renewable H2 fuel for fuel cells and other energy devices.119–122 However, the efficiency of water electrolysis is limited by a high kinetic overpotential and a sluggish reaction rate which has become the bottleneck for the further development of these energy-related devices. Although IrO2 and RuO2 have shown satisfactory electrocatalytic properties in acidic and alkaline environments, respectively, the scarcity, high cost and low stability of the noble metal-based catalysts hinder their practical applications.123,124 Therefore, the development of efficient water electrolysis catalysts with earth-abundant elements and excellent stability has inspired years of research.
LDH-based materials containing transition metal cations, particularly Ni, Co, Fe and Zn-containing LDHs, have been widely used in electrocatalytic reactions, especially for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).45,46,58,80,125–144Table 2 summarizes the recently developed LDH-based OER catalysts and their electrochemical performances. Typically, Hu et al.126 obtained single-layer nanosheets of NiFe-, NiCo- and CoCo-LDH successfully by liquid phase exfoliation. The exfoliated LDH nanosheets show a significantly higher catalytic activity and better stability (∼95% at 10 mA cm−2 for 12 h) compared with their bulk phase, which is attributed to the increase of active site density and conductivity. It was found that NiFe-LDH nanosheets possess the best OER properties (with an overpotential of ∼290 mV in 1 M KOH at a current density of 10 mA cm−2). Boettcher et al.130 further discussed the active sites of NiFe-LDH. They demonstrated that Fe affects the local electronic structure of NiOOH and may serve as the active site. Up to now, various LDHs, such as CoFe-, CoNi-, ZnCo- and ZnNi-LDH, have been reported as OER catalysts. For example, compared with traditional monometallic Co(OH)2 and Co3O4 systems, ZnCo-LDH possesses a lower overpotential (by ∼100 mV) for the electrochemical oxidation of water, and its turnover frequency (TOF) is 10 times larger than that of Co(OH)2 and Co3O4 at the same applied potential.141 In addition to the composition, the nanostructure of electroactive species also plays an important role in improving the electrocatalytic performance. For instance, our group successfully fabricated NiFe-, CoFe- and LiFe-LDH arrays with a 3D architecture by a fast electrosynthesis method.46 Compared with the conventional 2D planar architecture, the as-obtained NiFe-LDH array possesses a much lower onset potential (∼1.43 V vs. RHE), a larger current density (44 mA cm−1 at an overpotential of 300 mV) and superior stability (∼100% at 1.55–1.75 V for 50 h).

Carbon-based materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene and carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have been widely used as catalyst supports in many heterogeneous reactions, due to their high specific surface areas, satisfactory mechanical strength, thermal stability and electronic conductivity. Incorporating carbon-based materials and LDHs into nanocomposites for high performance OER catalysts has attracted increasing interest. Dai and co-workers reported a NiFe–LDH/CNT hybrid which was assembled by direct nucleation and growth of ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanoplates on mildly oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes.125 The resulting NiFe-LDH/CNTs material exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution: in 1 M KOH, the OER onset potential decreases considerably to ∼1.45 V vs. RHE; and the Tafel slope is 31 mV dec−1, much smaller than that of the Ir/C reference sample. The NiFe-LDH/CNT catalyst shows a nearly constant operating potential at 5 mA cm−2. As a zero band gap semiconductor carbon-based material, graphene has been extensively investigated as a substrate to anchor LDHs for efficient OER catalysts. For example, Long et al.58 reported an OER hybrid catalyst by alternately stacking the NiFe double hydroxide cation layers with the negatively-charged GO layers, and the as-prepared NiFe-LDH/GO and NiFe-LDH/rGO hybrids exhibited advanced electrocatalytic activity and stability toward OER in alkaline solution. The overpotential of catalytic OER catalysts is among the lowest values of non-noble metal catalysts (as low as 0.195 V) and the Tafel slope is close to the Ir/C catalyst (40 mV dec−1). Recently, a novel composite based on the NiFe-LDH and nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene) framework by spatially confined hybridization has been reported.80 The superior OER catalytic performances, as evidenced by a remarkably decreased overpotential (∼337 mV required for 10 mA cm−2), a low Tafel slope (ca. 45 mV dec−1) and long-term stability, indicate that the proposed NiFe-LDH/N-graphene was favorable for superior electrocatalysis. In addition, NiFe-LDH combined with carbon quantum dots (denoted as NiFe-LDH/CQD) has also been reported with enhanced OER activity.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen by the direct use of sunlight is an ideal, renewable method of clean energy production that integrates solar energy collection and water electrolysis into a single photoelectrode. LDH materials have been employed to improve the photocurrent of PEC electrodes by facilitating electron–hole pair separation and improving O2 evolution kinetics. Our group fabricated well-aligned ZnO core@LDH shell hierarchical nanoarrays by direct deposition of LDH nanosheets onto ZnO nanowires (NWs) via a facile electrosynthesis method.66 The as-obtained ZnO@CoNi-LDH core–shell nanoarrays exhibit promising behavior in PEC water splitting, giving rise to a largely enhanced photocurrent density and stability, much superior to those of ZnO-based photoelectrodes.
As the core process of direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs), glucose biofuel cells (GBFCs) and bio-sensors, small-molecule electro-oxidation reactions (e.g., methanol, ethanol, hydrazine and glucose), have attracted considerable attention. However, the anodic electro-oxidation process is normally greatly constrained by high kinetic barriers (high overpotentials), sluggish reaction dynamics and instability of electrode materials. Even in the presence of state-of-the-art precious catalysts (such as Pt, Pd and Au), a substantial overpotential is still required to drive the oxidation of small molecules.145,146 Moreover, noble catalysts also suffer from their high cost and easy toxification. Recently, great efforts have been focused on the oxides/hydroxides of first-row transition metals as promising electro-oxidation catalysts. Attributed to the high intrinsic catalytic activity of the transition metals in the hydroxide layers of LDHs, they have been directly used as promising small-molecule electrocatalysts. For instance, the hierarchical NiAl-LDH microspheres present a significant electrocatalytic performance toward the oxidation of hydrazine with a linear response range (5.0 × 10−6–1.0 × 10−4 M) and high sensitivity (144 μA μM−1 cm−2).147 The hierarchical MgFe-LDH microspheres with tunable interior architectures (hollow, yolk–shell and solid interior structure) were further explored.148 The hollow MgFe-LDH microspheres display excellent catalytic activity and robust durability for ethanol electrooxidation compared with the yolk–shell and solid structures, which can be ascribed to the enhanced surface area and suitable mesopore distribution. In addition, 3D NiFe-LDH nanoarrays synthesized by an electrochemical method also show good electrocatalytic activity for hydrazine, methanol and ethanol.46
By virtue of the confined effect of the interlayer and external surface of LDHs, LDHs can serve as efficient supports to anchor and disperse novel metal nanoparticles (Pt, Pd, Au, etc.) or organic molecules for electrocatalysis. Our group reported a hierarchical Pd-based heteronanostructure with finely-dispersed Pd nanoparticles (NPs) anchored to vertically-aligned LDH-NWs by using an in situ spontaneous deposition route.149 The resulting Pd/LDH-NW heteronanostructure exhibits an excellent catalytic activity and robust durability for ethanol electrooxidation. A combined DFT calculation and positron annihilation study indicates that the LDH support stabilizes the Pd NPs via the formation of a Pd–OH bond, and the redistribution of charge density (electron transfer from LDH to Pd NPs) further facilitates the process of ethanol electro-oxidation. We further reported the fabrication of a glucose electrochemical sensor by alternating assembly of exfoliated LDH nanosheets and Au NPs on conducting substrates by using the LBL approach.57 The as-fabricated electrode displays remarkable electrocatalytic performance toward the oxidation of glucose with high sensitivity, a low detection limit as well as long-term stability. The results demonstrate that LDH nanosheets serve as promising materials for the immobilization of metal particles, which can be potentially applied in the fields of fuel cells and electrochemical sensors.
5. Conclusions and prospective
LDHs represent some of the most promising electrode materials due to their facile preparation/modification, good tunability and cost effectiveness. LDH-based electroactive materials have been rationally designed and synthesized by well-developed methodologies with enhanced mass diffusion and electron transfer; a large number of methods have been established to directly modify electrodes by using LDHs materials in order to give highly-dispersed and ordered nanostructures. The hierarchical LDH microspheres with large surface areas and suitable mesopore distributions facilitate the faradic redox reaction and the mass transfer of electrolytes, which thereby improve their electrochemical performances. Moreover, the LDH/carbon (graphene, CNTs, carbon fibers or carbon clothes) nanocomposites fabricated by in situ growth of LDH nanoplatelets on carbon materials or by assembly of LDHs with carbon counterparts can fully inherit the properties of both LDHs and carbon materials. In addition, some interesting nanostructures, such as carbon nanorings and graphene quantum dots, have been obtained by carbonization of interlayer anions of LDHs via the approach of confined synthesis. Besides carbon materials, LDH/conducting polymer (CP) composites also demonstrate a synergistic effect: the conducting polymers serve as the support for the dispersion of LDH nanoplatelets and provide satisfactory conductivity; while the electrochemically-active center in LDHs is excited extremely by virtue of the enhanced conductivity. Therefore, the LDH-based electroactive materials obtained by the rational design and controlled synthesis show significant potential in the electrochemical energy storage and conversion.
The fabrication of hierarchical LDH nanostructures and the construction of LDH-based nanocomposites are effective routes for improving the electrochemical performances of LDHs. However, it remains a challenge to precisely manipulate the LDHs into arbitrary nanoarchitectures, in order to achieve an accurate tailoring of the LDH electronic structure and architecture on multi-scale levels; and detailed insights into the electrochemical reaction processes are not well-developed. Recently, LDH materials have been proved with great opportunities as novel OER catalysts. However, new insights into their chemistry and physics are quite important to provide a general understanding for the catalytic reactions; and the relationship between the composition/structure and their properties needs to be revealed. Therefore, in the future, further design and synthesis of low-cost and high-quality LDH-based electrodes with precise control over their composition, structure and morphology are worth. Moreover, the understanding of the roles of active sites, the synergy between two or more active components of LDHs for the electron transportation and surface reaction is very challenging and significant. In addition, the application enhancement in the field of energy storage and conversion (e.g., supercapacitors and water splitting) would be welcome, by fully making use of the redox reactions and intrinsic catalytic properties of LDH-based materials.
