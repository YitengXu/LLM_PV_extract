    , Accepted 16th April 2020First published on 17th April 2020AbstractConstructing a particular nanostructure and improving electrical conductivity are two effective ways to improve the charge storage of LDH-based electrode materials. An asymmetric supercapacitor coupled with double-layer capacitance materials is the most promising strategy to improve the performance of a supercapacitor device. In this study, the ZIF-9@CoAl LDH compound was successfully synthesized by a “Ship in a Bottle” method. The conductivity of CoAl LDHs was improved by the introduction of 2D ZIF-9 micro-slices. The ZIF-9@CoAl LDH hybrid structure exhibited a high specific capacitance of 702.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 compared with that of the pure CoAl LDHs of 518.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and recorded a favorable rate capability of 73.8% when the current density is up to 20 A g−1 (56.1% of pure CoAl LDHs). Besides, the assembled ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor cell device worked synergistically to achieve a high energy density of 32.1 W h kg−1 with a power density of 1000 W kg−1 and a capacity retention of 75% after 5000 cycles. This work provides a simple strategy to improve the rate capability and energy storage performance of LDH-based materials.
1. Introduction
Environmental and energy-related issues caused by the over-exploitation of fossil fuels have aroused a lot of research interest on renewable resource conversion and energy storage, such as photovoltaic conversion,1 photochemical conversion,2–4 thermoelectric conversion,5 batteries6 and supercapacitors.7 As an important part of electrochemical energy storage, supercapacitors (SCs) or electrochemical capacitors have shown surprising advantages in electrical networks and portable devices due to their high power density, fast charge/discharge capability, long lifespan, environment friendliness and low maintenance cost.8–10
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) or hydrotalcite-like materials, a class of multi-metal clay materials constituted by octahedral brucite-like layers and interlayer regions mainly composed of anions and solvation molecules, have attracted much attention recently in the application of supercapacitors owing to their structural and compositional advantages.11 As one of the typical members, cobalt–aluminum LDHs have been reported to be used in supercapacitors in recent years. Almost all the works focus on solving the problems of easy aggregation and poor conductivity of CoAl LDHs. Yan's group reported a sandwich-like CoAl-LDH/polypyrrole/graphene nanocomposite, and the improved performance derived from the excellent conductivity and structural stability of the polypyrrole/graphene substrate.12 Wang's group introduced NiP nanorod conductive substrates to grow CoAl LDHs.13 Although these strategies improved the conductivity and structural stability of CoAl LDHs to a certain extent, there are still obstacles in the way to practical application due to the half the result with twice the effort of a complex improvement approach.
As a kind of porous crystalline materials, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have been arousing increasing attention in the field of energy storage due to the metal ions or metal clusters that can provide a reaction center for redox and the pore structure that provides the transport path of ions to store charge.14–16 However, the pristine ZIFs usually show little capacitance and low conductivity.15 Therefore, many studies have focused their attention on the improvement of the MOFs’ electrical conductivity and compounding with other materials.17–19 Recently, some 2-dimensional (2D) MOFs have been reported to possess high electronic conductivity due to in-plane charge delocalization and extended pi-conjugation.20–22 For example, Wu's group reported that 2D CuI-MOFs exhibited excellent electrochemical performance when acting as supercapacitor electrode materials.23 Therefore, we hope to improve the charge transfer performance of MOFs by reducing pristine MOFs into two dimensions, and further improve the charge storage properties by using LDH electrode materials.
Based on the above in-depth understanding of CoAl LDH and MOF materials, we hope to construct a hybrid material that possesses the merits of both simultaneously. In this work, we compare the performance of the ZIF-9/CoAl LDH composites synthesized by “Ship in a Bottle” and “Bottle around Ship” strategies, respectively. It can be seen that the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs synthesized via the “Ship in a Bottle” method show the best performance of electrochemical energy storage. The ZIF-9 in the ZIF-9@CoAl LDH composite is in the form of 2D square pieces, which facilitates the transfer of charge. Consequently, the ZIF-9@CoAl LDH composite displays a remarkable specific capacitance of 702.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 compared with the values of CoAl LDHs of 518.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and records a favorable rate capability of 73.8% when the current density is up to 20 A g−1. Besides, the assembled ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC device works synergistically to achieve a high energy density of 32.1 W h kg−1 with a power density of 1000 W kg−1 and a capacity retention of 75% after 5000 cycles.
2. Experimental
All the chemicals used in this work including cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), benzimidazole (C7H6N2), ammonia solution (NH3, 25–28%), ethanol and other reagents and solvents were reagent grade and used without further purification. The detailed synthesis process is shown in Scheme 1.

2.1. The preparation method of ZIF-9
The synthetic processes of ZIF-9 followed previous work.24–26 Typically, 1 mmol of C7H6N2 and 0.5 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 25 mL of deionized water. After 5 min stirring, 10 mL of ammonia solution was added to the above mixed solution, stirring evenly under magnetic force. Then, the solution was sealed in an 80 mL reactor for 6 h. The as-prepared carmine precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol, respectively, and dried at 70 °C overnight. The obtained ZIF-9 was ground evenly and collected for further utilization.
2.2. The preparation method of CoAl LDHs
CoAl LDHs were synthesized by an aqueous-phase coprecipitation route. Typically, 1.5 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.5 mmol of Al(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water and marked as solution A. Analogously, 4 mmol of NaOH and 1.5 mmol of Na2CO3 were dissolved in 15 mL of deionized water and marked as solution B. After each solution was evenly dispersed, solution B was slowly added into solution A dropwise. Then, the mixture was transferred to an autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 16 h. When cooled to room temperature within the furnace, the sediments were collected, washed and dried at 80 °C overnight.
2.3. Preparation method of ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs
The preparation of ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs was same as the preparation process of CoAl LDHs except for adding 0.1 g of ZIF-9 into solution A.
2.4. Preparation method of CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 and U-CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9
CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 was obtained by adding 0.1 g of CoAl LDHs in the preparation process of ZIF-9. U-CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 was obtained by adding 0.1 g of CoAl LDHs with ultrasonic treatment beforehand for 30 min in the preparation process of ZIF-9.
2.5. Characterization methods
The crystalline phase and morphology of the as-prepared electrode materials were measured by using X-ray diffraction (Rigaku RINT-2000, Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS EVO 10) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM1200EX JEOL). The chemical state and composition were detected by X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (ESCALAB 250Xi, Al Kα) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet Avatar 380, Thermo Electron).
2.6. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance of charge storage was measured in a three-electrode system and two-electrode system, respectively. During the preparation of electrodes, the prepared powder materials were mixed with acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 80:10:10 and dissolved in N-methyl-pyrrolidone, with stirring for 12 h to obtain a fully homogenous solution. Then, the slurry was spread on graphite paper in an area of 1 × 1 cm2. After overnight drying treatment at 70 °C, the testing electrodes were prepared successfully. The mass loading of the positive materials on each electrode is about 1.0–1.2 mg cm−2 and the mass loading of AC is about 1.6–1.8 mg cm−2. The electrochemical characteristics of the as-prepared electrode were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on an electrochemical workstation (CHI-760E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Limited Corporation, China) using a typical three-electrode set-up, in which the prepared electrodes acted as working electrodes, platinum foil acted as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl standard electrode was the reference electrode and 6 M KOH aqueous solution acts as the electrolyte. The mass specific capacitance (SC) was calculated from GCD curves according to eqn (1) referring to a previous reported study:27 (1)where C (F g−1) represents the mass specific capacitance. im (A g−1) is the current density.  is the integral current area of the discharge curve, where V is the potential with initial and final values of Vi and Vf, respectively.
Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) of CoAl LDHs//AC and ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC devices were assembled using CoAl LDHs and ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs as the positive electrode and active carbon (AC) as the negative electrode, respectively. The integrated device was assembled by pressing the two electrodes and filter paper with both sides applied with 6 M KOH solution. The device was vacuum sealed in a plastic bag for further collection of performance information. The CV, GCD and EIS results were also obtained using the CHI-760E electrochemical workstation. The mass ratios of the positive electrodes and negative electrodes were calculated according to charge balance eqn (2): (2)where m+ and m− represent the painting mass of the active substance and AC, C+ and C− represent the specific capacitance of the active substance and AC, and ΔV+ and ΔV− represent the potential window upon discharging of each electrode, respectively. The energy density (E, W h kg−1) and power density (P, W kg−1) of the ASCs were calculated based on the total mass of the positive and negative electrodes using eqn (3)–(5): (3) (4) (5)where CA is the specific capacitance of the ASC devices (F g−1) and M is the total mass of the active material on the positive and negative electrodes (g); Δt (s) represents the discharge time of the ASC.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD and FT-IR investigations
XRD was used to notarize the crystalline structures of the prepared electrode materials and the results are depicted in Fig. 1a. For the pure CoAl LDHs, the diffraction peaks at 11.4°, 23.1°, 34.3°, 59.9° and 61.3° corresponded to (003), (006), (012), (110) and (113) (JCFDS No. 51-0045), respectively, which confirm the successful synthesis of the hydrotalcite-like CoAl-LDH phase.12 For the blue curve, the XRD peaks at 9.4° and other peaks match well with ZIF-9 reported in previous works,24–26 also indicating the success of the prepared ZIF-9 electrode material. Furthermore, in the XRD pattern of the three compounds, the diffraction characteristics of ZIF-9 and CoAl LDHs appear simultaneously and ZIF-9 in ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs has the lowest degree of crystallization, which is due to the morphological changes of ZIF-9 during the hydrothermal synthesis of CoAl LDHs. In addition, according to the Debye–Scherrer formula (D = Kλ/(βcosθ)), the particle sizes of ZIF-9, ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs, CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 and U-CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 are about 492.6, 788.4, 525.4 and 563.0 nm on the basis of the peak at 8.6°, respectively. Obviously, the particle size of ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs is much larger than that of the other materials, resulting in a differentiation of morphology. FT-IR characterization was also performed to verify this tendency. The strong peak at about 3446 cm−1 and the sharp peak located at 1356 cm−1 are assigned to the O–H stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups and the ν3 vibration of CO32−, respectively, confirming the existence of OH− and CO32− in CoAl LDHs.28 In addition, the bands from 400 cm−1 to 650 cm−1 could be assigned to the Co–N bonds in ZIF-9. The peak located at about 745 cm−1 could correspond to the C–H out-of-plane bending vibration and the 1400 cm−1 peak could relate to the bending vibration of N–H⋯N, respectively.29 The infrared absorption characteristics of ZIF-9 and CoAl LDHs also appear simultaneously in the three compounds and ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs shows the weakest vibration of Co–N and C–H bonds, which is in good agreement with the XRD results. The XRD and FT-IR results indicate that the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs and CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 compounds were assembled successfully via “Ship in a Bottle” and “Bottle around Ship” strategies, respectively.

3.2. Morphologies and structures
The SEM morphologies of ZIF-9, CoAl LDHs and the three compounds are presented in Fig. 2. Specifically, Fig. 2a shows the SEM image of ZIF-9, which demonstrates a flower shape stacked by micro-sheets. As can be seen in the SEM image of pure CoAl LDHs shown in Fig. 2b, a mass of nanoslices with the fragments much smaller than those of ZIF-9 is stacked in disorder. Interestingly, the CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 synthesized by the “Bottle around Ship” method display a simple combination of micro-ZIF-9 pieces and CoAl LDH nanosheets and the CoAl LDHs show no morphological change during the formation of ZIF-9 (Fig. 2c). Even the ultrasonic treatment of CoAl LDHs causes no obvious morphologic change, which can be seen from the SEM image of U-CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 in Fig. 2d. However, the morphology of ZIF-9 shows an obvious change when the “Ship in a Bottle” strategy is used to assemble the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs compound. As shown in Fig. 2e, ZIF-9 presents a square microsheet of about 2–3 μm side length, which may be due to the structural reorganization during the hydrothermal synthesis process of CoAl LDHs. The line scan EDX pattern in Fig. 2f manifests that the CoAl LDHs distributed around the square ZIF-9 and a few CoAl LDHs are attached to the square ZIF-9. Thus, this special structure derived from the “Ship in a Bottle” strategy decreases the aggregation of CoAl LDH nanosheets and ZIF-9 itself concurrently, enabling the electrochemical characteristics of the CoAl LDHs to be fully play retained. Moreover, the conductivity of ZIF-9 was further improved by the two dimensional square morphology according to a previously reported work.20

Besides, N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were performed to measure the specific surface areas and pore size distributions of the electrode materials. Fig. 3a confirms that the five electrode materials are mesoporous in nature due to the type IV adsorption–desorption isotherms with a H2-type hysteresis loop. The average pore size of the five electrode materials is distributed between 11.18 nm and 20.14 nm. Combined with the pore size distributions in Fig. 3b, it can be determined that the prepared five materials are all mesoporous materials. The specific surface area (Table 1) of ZIF-9, CoAl LDHs, ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs, CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 and U-CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 is 10.89, 47.9, 19.4, 27.36 and 26.77 m2 g−1, respectively. Numerically, the specific surface area of the composite material is between that of the two monomer electrode materials. Particularly, the specific surface area of ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs is less than the specific surface area of CoAl LDHs and there is no visible difference between CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 and U-CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 in specific surface area.

The structure of the ZIF-9@CoAl LDH compound was further characterized by TEM and HRTEM measurements. A typical TEM image is shown in Fig. 4a. It can be clearly seen that ZIF-9 displays micro-pieces with thin thickness, while the CoAl LDH hexagonal nanosheets possess a thicker size. The distinct interface in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image differentiated clearly the ZIF-9 and CoAl LDHs, as shown in Fig. 4b. The (003) plane of the CoAl LDH phase with an interlayer distance of 0.76 nm can be observed in the HRTEM image, which matches well with the XRD results (Fig. 1a). Besides, as shown in Fig. 4c, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig. 4b) presents the well-defined diffraction rings corresponding to the (003) and (006) planes of CoAl LDHs, indicating the polycrystalline structure of the LDH nanosheets. In addition, elemental mapping was performed to identify the composition of the ZIF-9@CoAl LDH compound. It can be seen that the Co, Al, C, N and O elements are distributed uniformly in the surface of the hexagonal CoAl LDHs and the Al and Co elements around the hexagonal nanosheets distribute slightly (Fig. 4d). This phenomenon has good agreement with the SEM images. Thus, we definitely believe that the ZIF-9@CoAl LDH compound is formed by ZIF-9 slices and hexagonal CoAl LDH nanosheets.

3.3. XPS analysis
XPS measurement was further used to analyze the chemical composition of the prepared ZIF-9@CoAl LDH electrode material and prove the no valence state change of ZIF-9 in the process of CoAl LDH growth. The XPS survey spectra in Fig. 5a show that the Co, Al, O, C and N elements coexist in the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs, which is in good agreement with the elemental mapping results. As shown in Fig. 5b, the peaks of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 are located at 797.4 eV and 781.4 eV, respectively, with a spin-orbital doublet splitting of 4 eV and two broad satellite peaks located to the left of the two main peaks, indicating the presence of Co2+ in ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs.30 The spectrum of Al 2p is shown in Fig. 5c, and the peak located at 74.2 eV confirms the presence of Al3+.31 As shown in Fig. 5d, a deconvolution was performed on the O 1s spectrum to obtain three peaks centered at 533.1 eV, 532.1 eV and 531.2 eV. The peak at 533.1 eV is assigned to the C–OH/C–O–C group in CoAl LDHs and ZIF-9, respectively. The peak at 532.1 eV can be attributed to oxygen atoms having double bonds to carbon atoms. The peak at 531.2 eV is assigned to physically absorbed oxygen.32 The enlarged C 1s spectrum shown in Fig. 5e can be fitted into three peaks centered at 283.3, 285.1 and 284.1 eV, respectively. The binding energy peak at 283.3 eV can be attributed to carbonyl groups. The peak at 285.1 eV is assigned to sp2 carbon bonded with a nitrogen atom and the peak at 284.1 eV is related to CC in the benzene ring. The XPS spectrum of N 1s is illustrated in Fig. 5f. The peak centered at 399.5 eV corresponds to the N connected with the cobalt center and the peak at 398.8 eV is assigned to sp2-nitrogen bonded to two carbon atoms in the hexagon ring.33 Based on the above analysis, it is believed that the ZIF-9@CoAl LDH compound is composed of ZIF-9 and CoAl LDHs, and there is no change in the composition; just the morphology of ZIF-9 has changed by the “Ship in a Bottle” strategy.

3.4. Electrochemical performance in a three electrode system
ZIF-9, CoAl LDHs and their compounds as pseudo-capacitor electrode materials were evaluated by CV, GCD and EIS measurements using a three electrode system with 6 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The CV curves of the prepared five electrodes at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.45 V (versus Ag/AgCl) are displayed in Fig. 6a. The shape of the figures indicates that ZIF-9 has negligible performance in charge storage, while the electrodes involving the CoAl LDHs all show two redox peaks. ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs show the largest region of integration, indicating the maximum electron storage in the process of cyclic voltammetry testing. The calculated GCD results are shown in Fig. 6b, in which ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs also displays the maximum specific capacitance. The specific capacitance of ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs is 702.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is 1.35, 2.42 and 2.7 times higher than that of CoAl LDHs, CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9 and U-CoAl LDHs@ZIF-9, respectively. Furthermore, in order to clarify the dynamic transfer properties, the Nyquist plots of the five electrodes investigated in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz are shown in Fig. 6c, in which the intercept on the real axis and the semicircle in the high frequency region represent the equivalent series resistance (Rs) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), respectively.34,35 It is apparent that although the ZIF-9@CoAl LDH compound exerts a larger Rs, its Rct is the smallest. This helpful transfer of charge and electrolyte ions benefits from the ultrathin and dispersed ZIF-9 and more decentralized morphology of CoAl LDHs.

Based on the electrochemical comparisons of the five electrode materials, ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs were selected as the best candidate for a pseudocapacitive cathode material. Fig. 6d shows the CV curves of ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs under the scan rates of 5–100 mV s−1. All shapes exhibit a pair of oxidation and reduction peaks, which shifted to the opposite side with an increase of scan rate due to the polarization and quasi-reversible character.36 Moreover, the relationship of peak current and the scan rate is shown in Fig. 6e. The b1 (anode) and b2 (cathode) values of both 0.74 indicate that the ZIF-9@CoAl LDH compound undergoes a typical diffusion-controlled process in 6 M KOH electrolyte and the redox process was quasi-reversible, and the mechanism can be speculated as follows according to the previous studies:12,37 Co2+ + OH− ↔ CoOOH + H2O + e−(6)
In addition, the GCD curves of the ZIF-9@CoAl LDH electrode at various current densities are shown in Fig. 6f, and the clear discharge platform further confirms the above results. Consequently, as shown in Table 2, this ZIF-9@CoAl LDH compound electrode has excellent electrochemical properties compared with the CoAl LDH-based electrode materials reported previously.

In order to evaluate the cycling stability of the as-prepared compound electrode material, long time charge–discharge tests were carried out at the current density of 10 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 7a. Remarkably, ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs exhibited a capacitance of 71.7% after 5000 charge–discharge cycles, demonstrating excellent cycle stability of long time energy conversion. Concomitantly, the coulombic efficiency was maintained at approximately 100%, indicating the reversible redox reactions during the cycling processes. The differences of electrochemical property before and after the cycles were analyzed via EIS and the results are given in Fig. 7b. It can be clearly seen that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs after the cycles is larger than that before the cycles, while the equivalent series resistance (Rs) shows a slight decrease. This increase in transfer resistance reduces the energy storage capacity of the electrode material during the long time duty-cycle operation.

3.5. Asymmetric supercapacitor properties of the two-electrode system
In order to investigate the practical application performance of the prepared ZIF-9@CoAl LDH compound materials, commercially used AC was introduced to assemble the asymmetric supercapacitor cell (ASC). The electrochemical performance of AC was measured by using CV, GCD and EIS in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. Fig. 8a shows the CV curves at various scan rates from 5–100 mV s−1. The quasi-rectangular shape and −1 to 0 V (versus Ag/AgCl) potential window indicated its excellent electric double-layer capacitance, and the symmetrical triangular shape of the GCD curves shown in Fig. 8b also manifest the double-layer charge storage properties.42,43 The calculated specific capacitances of AC are 187.2, 179.0, 168.5, 160.0 and 148 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8c. The 79% capacitive retention rate proved the stability of the AC material when used in electrochemical capacitance. Besides, in Fig. 8d, the negligible Rct of 0.3 Ω and Rs of 0.8 Ω indicate the excellent charge transfer performance of AC.

(e) Digital photograph and (f) schematic diagram of assembled ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC device. 
A digital photograph of the prepared asymmetric supercapacitor ASC device is presented in Fig. 8e, which was vacuum sealed in a plastic bag to avoid evaporation of water in the electrolyte when the device works in the charge–discharge process. This ASC device is composed of a ZIF-9@CoAl LDH positive electrode, AC negative electrode, a separator made of filter paper and 6 M KOH electrolyte, and the inner structure is schematically displayed in Fig. 8f.
As shown in Fig. 9a, the voltage window of ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs and AC is from 0 to 0.45 V and −1 to 0 V, respectively at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Thus, the voltage window of the ASC device is predicted to be 1.45 V. To match the charge quantity between the anode and cathode, according to eqn (2), the calculated optimal positive/negative mass ratio is about 1.2 mg:1.8 mg. Furthermore, for the purpose of further confirming the practical operating voltage window of the ASC device, the CV curves of the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC device at different voltages were obtained and are shown in Fig. 9b. It can be seen from the CV curves that there is no obvious oxygen evolution reaction when the voltage increased to 1.8 V. Thus, 1.8 V acted as the optimal operating voltage window in device performance testing. Fig. 9c shows the CV curves at various scan rates from 5 to 100 mV s−1; the similar shapes indicate the good reversibility and high capacity retention.44 In addition, Fig. 9d presents the GCD curves of the ASC device under different current densities. The calculated specific capacitances of CoAl LDHs//AC and ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC are comparatively shown in Fig. 9e. The CoAl LDHs//AC ASC device can deliver a specific capacitance of 51.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 while the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC device can exhibit a specific capacitance of 71.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, combined with 77.4% capacity retention at 10 A g−1, indicating a good charge storage capacity and capacitance retention performance of the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC.

(b) CV curves collected in different voltage windows (1.5–2.0 V) at 50 mV s−1, (c) CV curves at different scan rates (5–100 mV s−1) and (d) GCD curves at different current densities (1–10 A g−1) of the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC device. (e) Comparison of the calculated specific capacitances between CoAl LDHs//AC and ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC devices and the (f) correspondingly generated Ragone plot. 
The energy density and power density of a supercapacitor are two important parameters to evaluate its practical application prospects. ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC exhibits a maximium energy density of 32.1 W h kg−1 with a power density of 1000.0 W kg−1 calculated by eqn (4) and (5), and CoAl LDHs//AC has a lower energy density of 23.1 W h kg−1 with a power density of 1170.4 W kg−1. The Ragone plot relating the energy density to the power density is shown in Fig. 9f. Compared with reported similar electrodes,13,45–48 the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC device demonstrates a superior performance of charge storage.
The long time cycle stability is another indicator to evaluate the application potential of the as-prepared ASC device. The cyclic stability of CoAl LDHs//AC and ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC devices was studied at a high current density of 8 A g−1 during 5000 successive GCD cycles and the results are shown in Fig. 10a and b, respectively. They display that the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC device maintains 88.2% capacitance after 5000 cycles, while the CoAl LDHs//AC ASC device maintains only 63.6% original capacitance. In order to explore the reason for the decay of specific capacitance, the EIS plots of both devices were obtained before and after the cycles. It can be seen from Fig. 10c that the Rct of both the devices decreased, which is due to activation in the cyclic processes. But, the Rs of both the devices increased with an increase in the number of cycles, leading to a decay of specific capacitance. Compared to CoAl LDHs//AC, ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC possesses a smaller Rct. Thus, the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC device shows more excellent stability. Befitting from the high energy and power expression of the ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC device, 30 red LEDs in parallel (Fig. 10d) can be successfully illuminated for 120 s (Video S1, ESI†) by two as-prepared ASC devices connected in series, supporting its outstanding energy storage/output performance.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we used a “Ship in a Bottle” strategy to construct a ZIF-9@CoAl LDH hybrid particular nanostructure. The conductivity of the CoAl LDHs is improved by the introduction of 2D ZIF-9 nanoslices. The ZIF-9@CoAl LDH hybrid structure exhibits a high specific capacitance of 702.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 compared with the pure CoAl LDHs of 518.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and records a favorable rate capability of 73.8% when the current is up to 20 g−1, while the pure CoAl LDHs only keep a 56.1% capacitance. Moreover, the assembled ZIF-9@CoAl LDHs//AC ASC device works synergistically to achieve a high energy density of 32.1 W h kg−1 with a power density of 1000 W kg−1 and a capacity retention of 75% after 5000 cycles. When the two devices are connected in series to light up 30 red LEDs, the performance of continuous glowing can be maintained for about 120 s. This study provides a simple strategy to improve the rate capability and energy storage performance of LDH-based materials.
