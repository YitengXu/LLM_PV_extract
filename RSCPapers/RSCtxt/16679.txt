    , Accepted 15th February 2018First published on 15th February 2018AbstractA new class of benzothiadiazole-oligo(3-hexylthiophene) flanked dicyanomethylenated quinacridone derivatives DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3) has been designed and synthesized in good yield by iterative bromination and Suzuki coupling reactions, followed by Knoevenagel condensation. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of the compounds have been fully investigated. They showed intense and broad absorption at the visible and near-infrared regions, a suitable LUMO energy level at about −3.7 eV, and the appropriate film-formation properties. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices based on the blend film of P3HT/DCNQA-BT-T1 (P3HT = poly(3-hexylthiophene)) showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.73% under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. Compared with the traditional P3HT/PC61BM (PC61BM = [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) device, the P3HT/DCNQA-BT-T1 device displayed intense absorption in the near-infrared region (650–750 nm) and effectively contributed to the photocurrent. These results indicate that DCNQA derivatives are promising non-fullerenes acceptors for the BHJ polymer solar cells.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn tremendous attention due to the unique advantages of low cost, light weight, and the potential opportunity for fabricating flexible devices by solution processing.1 Traditional PSCs generally use a heterojunction composed of a p-type conjugated polymer as a donor and an n-type small-molecular or polymeric material as an acceptor.2 Although fullerene derivatives (such as PC61BM and PC71BM), have been predominately utilized in high-efficiency PSCs, the low extinction coefficients of the fullerene derivatives in the red and near-infrared region limit their contribution to the photocurrent.3 Fullerene derivatives also suffer from several other drawbacks, such as tedious material purification, restricted variability of molecular and electronic structures, and a strong tendency to form large crystallites within the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blends that may result in device instability.4 In recent years, non-fullerene acceptors have emerged as promising alternatives due to the special advantages of easy synthetic accessibility, strong absorption ability, and tunable HOMO/LUMO energy levels. To realize the high-performance non-fullerene acceptors, three critical requirements should be fulfilled: (i) a matched energy level for sufficient charge transfer between donors and acceptors; (ii) intense absorption that is complementary to those of the donors; (iii) excellent solubility for solution-processing as well as forming an appropriate phase separation with the donor materials. A large number of small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors have been developed that are based on different electron-withdrawing moieties, such as perylene diimide (PDI),5 naphthalene diimide (NDI),6 rhodanine,7 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (INCN),8,9 dicyno-ethylene group,10etc.11–17 Among these, planar A–D–A type small molecules represent a class of promising non-fullerene acceptors, which have a ring-fused central donor unit flanked by strong electron-withdrawing units. In particular, INCN based acceptors that use extended fused-ring indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) or indacenothiophene (IDT) as a central donor unit have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) even exceeding 11%,9 which is comparable to those of their fullerene counterparts.
In previous studies, we have developed a class of dicyanomethylenated quinacridone (DCNQA) as non-fullerene acceptors for PSCs.18 The incorporation of strong electron-withdrawing dicyno-ethylene groups to quinacridone (QA) endows the resulting DCNQA core with a low-lying LUMO level and good electron transport properties. The device using P3HT as a donor and C8-DCNQA as an acceptor showed a PCE of 1.57%. Furthermore, DCNQA derivatives can be easily synthesized from the easily available QA pigment. The DCNQA skeleton is expected to be further modified at multiple active sites, thus providing more structural versatility. The energy levels and photophysical properties of the DCNQA derivatives are expected to be further tuned to afford more comprehensive absorption in the range of the solar spectrum. Recently, DCNQA acceptors that have a D–A–D structure have been reported by our group.18b We deduced that the “D–A1–A2–A1–D” architecture that with a second electron withdrawing group would have a more significant effect on the electron levels and photophysical properties of the compounds. Herein, benzothiadiazole, a commonly used electron withdrawing unit, was selected as the “A1” group.
In this contribution, we synthesized a class of benzothiadiazole–oligo(3-hexylthiophene) flanked dicyanomethylenated quinacridone derivatives DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3) via bromination and Suzuki coupling reactions followed by Knoevenagel condensation. The compounds show a much broader and red-shifted absorption compared with that of C8-DCNQA. The LUMO energy levels of the compounds located at −3.70 eV, which is ca. 0.2 eV higher than that of PC61BM. The BHJ devices based on the blend film of P3HT/DCNQA-BT-T1 (P3HT = poly(3-hexylthiophene)) showed a PCE of 0.73% under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. Compared with the traditional P3HT/PC61BM device, the P3HT/DCNQA-BT-T1 device displayed intense absorption in the near-infrared region (650–750 nm) and effectively contributes to the photocurrent. This study demonstrated that introducing a second electron withdrawing group to DCNQA can effectively tune their energy levels and absorption properties, which provides a new strategy to develop non-fullerene acceptors for polymer solar cells.
2. Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic procedure of the compounds is outlined in Scheme 1. The diiodoquinacridone 3 was synthesized following the previously reported procedure.18b Compound 4 was obtained by Suzuki coupling of the benzothiadiazole boronic esters 2 and 3. Then the repeated bromination by N-bromosuccinimide and the Suzuki coupling with 3-hexylthiophene boronic ester were performed to get compounds 6 and 8 with longer oligo(3-hexylthiophene) chains. Finally, Knoevenagel condensations of compound 4, 6 and 8 were carried out under catalysis of TiCl4 to afford DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3) in good yield.19 The compounds are well soluble in common solvents such as chloroform, toluene, and chlorobenzene at room temperature. Fig. 1 shows the 1H NMR spectra of the compound in CDCl3. The 1H NMR spectra indicated that DCNQA-BT-T2 and DCNQA-BT-T3 were pure head-to-tail regioregular isomers.20 The thermal stability of DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3) was investigated by thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI†). The decomposition temperatures with a 5% weight loss (Td) are 348 °C, 334 °C and 338 °C for DCNQA-BT-T1, DCNQA-BT-T2 and DCNQA-BT-T3, respectively. The high Td values indicate the good thermal stability of the compounds.

Optical properties
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the compounds in dilute solution are shown in Fig. 2a and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. DCNQA-BT-T1 in solution exhibits two strong and broad absorption bands at 650 nm and 425 nm with maximum extinction coefficients of 3.98 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 1.92 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Apparently, the new compounds show more intense and broader absorption than that of the PC61BM (λmax = 328 nm, ε = 2.86 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1). The photophysical properties of DCNQA derivatives have been well studied earlier by our group. The dicyno-ethylene groups rendered them narrow band gaps and strong absorption at the red and near-infrared region. Thus the long wavelength absorption of DCNQA-BT-T1 can be attributed to the π–π* transition of the DCNQA core. For DCNQA-BT-T2 and DCNQA-BT-T3, the maximum absorption of this band is almost unchanged, being located at 652 nm. On the other hand, the absorption band at 400–500 nm can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the oligo(3-hexylthiophene) and benzothiadiazole units. As shown in Fig. 2a, from DCNQA-BT-T1 to DCNQA-BT-T2 and DCNQA-BT-T3, this absorption band significantly red-shifted, indicating the stronger ICT with the increase of the thiophene numbers. The absorption edges of DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3) are 686, 690 and 692 nm, corresponding to band gaps of 1.81, 1.80 and 1.79 eV, respectively. Fig. 2b shows the normalized absorption of the compound and PC61BM in thin films. The compounds all exhibits strong absorption from 300 to 750 nm. The absorption maxima of the long wavelength region localize at 669, 676 and 678 nm, respectively, which is obviously red-shifted compared with those in solution. The absorption properties of these compounds suggest that incorporation of the benzothiadiazole–oligo(3-hexylthiophene) moiety has efficiently extended their absorption spectra, which can contribute to extending the absorption region of PSCs based on DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3). The fluorescence spectra of P3HT film and P3HT:DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3) blend films are displayed in Fig. 3. Both blend films of P3HT:DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3) show complete PL quenching of over 95% of P3HT, indicating that both the compounds are highly compatible with P3HT for non-fullerene acceptors. The absorption spectra of these blend films are shown in Fig. S2, ESI.† The absorption of P3HT:DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3) blend films cover a broader wavelength range than that of the traditional P3HT:PC61BM films, which should have a positive contribution on improving the current densities of the devices.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the compounds were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and the electrochemical data of the compounds are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 4, both DCNQA-BT-T1 and DCNQA-BT-T2 have a quasi-reversible reduction wave while DCNQA-BT-T3 has an irreversible reduction wave. Based on the onset reduction potentials, the LUMO energy levels are estimated to be −3.69 eV for DCNQA-BT-T1, −3.70 eV for DCNQA-BT-T2, and −3.65 eV for DCNQA-BT-T3. The LUMO energy levels of the three compounds are very close and are ca. 0.2 eV higher than that of PC61BM. That means they are suitable for acceptors in PSCs and should deliver a comparable open circuit voltage as the traditional device based on PC61BM.21 The HOMO energy levels of the compounds are calculated to be −5.43, −5.42, and −5.16 eV, respectively. Therefore, extending the oligo(3-hexylthiophene) chains gradually increased the HOMO energy levels of the compounds.

Molecular orbital calculations
To further understand the molecular geometries and electronic structures of these compounds, DFT calculations were carried out. The optimized geometry of DCNQA-BT-T1 is shown in Fig. S3, ESI.† The central DCNQA core is highly twisted, which is similar to those of the previously reported DCNQA derivatives. The dihedral angle between DCNQA and benzothiadiazole is about 35°. The HOMO and LUMO plots of the compounds are listed in Fig. 5 and the calculated energy levels are summarized in Table 1. For DCNQA-BT-T1, the HOMO orbital is delocalized on the whole conjugated backbone, while for DCNQA-BT-T2 and DCNQA-BT-T3, the HOMO orbitals are more predominated by the outer oligo(3-hexylthiophene) and benzothiadiazole units. The LUMOs of the three compounds are all composed of the π*-orbitals of the central DCNQA core. The HOMO energy level gradually increases upon increasing the thiophene numbers, while the LUMO energy level is almost identical for all these compounds, being located at around −3.1 eV. These results are consistent with the absorption and electrochemical experiment data.

Photovoltaic properties
Bulk-heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using P3HT as the electron donor and DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3) as the acceptor. The traditional device configuration of [ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/active layer/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm)] was employed. For DCNQA-BT-T1, the BHJ film with an optimized P3HT:DCNQA-BT-T1 weight ratio of 1:1 was cast from chlorobenzene. The active layer was then annealed at 170 °C for 10 min. The device based on DCNQA-BT-T2 or DCNQA-BT-T3 was fabricated under the same conditions. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation and in the dark is presented in Fig. 6a. The parameters of the device performance are listed in Table 2. The P3HT:DCNQA-BT-T1 device without annealing treatment only shows a PCE of 0.21% with a short circuit current (JSC) of 3.75 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.51 V, and a low fill factor (FF) of 23%. The 75 °C annealed device exhibited a much improved performance with a JSC of 3.75 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.51 V, a FF of 0.38, and a PCE of 0.73%. Therefore, the annealing process is important for the enhancement of device performance. The VOC of the three devices are nearly identical due to the similar LUMO levels of the three acceptors. However, the devices based on DCNQA-BT-T2 or DCNQA-BT-T3 only has a lower JSC of 1.60 mA cm−2 and 1.21 mA cm−2. Overall, the device exhibits a much poorer performance with PCEs of 0.23% and 0.20%, respectively. For comparison, the traditional P3HT:PC61BM device was also fabricated according to the reported procedure.23 Apparently, the performance of the devices based on DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3) fell behind that of the P3HT:PC61BM device. To further investigate the device performances with different acceptors, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were measured. The JSC values extracted from the J–V curves are consistent with those integrated from the EQE spectra (±0.5 mA cm−2). Fig. 6b emphasizes the significant contributions of the acceptors to the EQE in the range of 600–750 nm, reaching 15% at 700 nm for the DCNQA-BT-T1 device. The maximum EQE value reached 20% in the range of 300–500 nm, which can be attributed to the absorption of P3HT and DCNQA-BT-T1. The EQE values of the DCNQA-BT-T2 and DCNQA-BT-T3 devices are much lower, which are consistent with the low JSC values of the devices.

To investigate the morphology of the different active layers, atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterizations were carried out. The as-cast film presents homogeneous and uniform feature with root mean square (RMS) roughnesses of 2.57 nm, 2.02 nm, and 3.79 nm for P3HT:DCNQA-BT-T1, P3HT:DCNQA-BT-T2, and P3HT:DCNQA-BT-T3, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). After annealing at 170 °C for 10 min, the P3HT:DCNQA-BT-T1 film displays large crystalline grains with a RMS roughness of 17.2 nm, probably due to the self-organization of P3HT (Fig. 7a). In contrast, the annealed P3HT:DCNQA-BT-T2, and P3HT:DCNQA-BT-T3 films is almost unchanged with RMS roughnesses of 1.86 nm and 2.93 nm, respectively (Fig. 7b and c). It is known that the large crystalline grains are beneficial to the ordered structure and charge transport for P3HT based devices, which can explain the superior performance of the P3HT:DCNQA-BT-T1 device.22 We inferred that the longer oligo(3-hexylthiophene) chains in DCNQA-BT-T2 and DCNQA-BT-T3 hindered the self-assembly of P3HT during the annealing process. Thus the film morphologies can be effectively controlled by tuning the molecular structures of the acceptors, which has a great effect on their photovoltaic properties. The P3HT:DCNQA-BT-T1 based active layer shows a similar morphology to that of P3HT:PC61BM based active layer (13.5 nm, Fig. S5, ESI†). Thus the poorer performance of P3HT:DCNQA-BT-Tn compared to PC61BM cannot be attributed to the difference in the morphology. Our previous study has shown that the electron mobility of DCNQA derivatives is about one magnitude lower than that of PC61BM. We inferred that introducing flanked oligo(3-hexylthiophene) moieties would further decrease their electron mobility. Besides, the reported molecules are very twisted due to the large dihedral angles between the DCNQA, benzothiadiazole, and thiophene moieties (Fig. S5, ESI†). The twisted geometry is bad for compact molecular packing and intermolecular charge transfer. Therefore, the poor performance of P3HT:DCNQA-BT-Tn may be attributed to the low electron mobility and twisted molecular geometries.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized a class of benzothiadiazole and regioregular oligo(3-hexylthiophene) flanked dicyanomethylenated quinacridone derivatives DCNQA-BT-Tn (n = 1–3) by using iterative bromination and Suzuki coupling reactions, followed by Knoevenagel condensation. The compounds showed intense and broad absorption at both the visible and near-infrared regions, a suitable LUMO energy level at about −3.7 eV, and the appropriate film-formation properties. The bulk heterojunction PSCs based on the blend film of P3HT/DCNQA-BT-T1 (1:1, w/w) reached a PCE of 0.73% under the AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. Compared with the traditional P3HT:PC61BM device, the P3HT:DCNQA-BT-T1 device displayed intense absorption in the near-infrared region (650–750 nm) and effectively contributed to the photocurrent. The devices based on blend films of P3HT/DCNQA-BT-T2 and P3HT/DCNQA-BT-T3 exhibited lower PCEs of 0.23% and 0.20%, respectively. These results indicate that benzothiadiazole-oligothiophene flanked DCNQA derivatives are promising non-fullerenes acceptors in solution-processed BHJ solar cells. Though the device performance is unsatisfactory, our research has guiding importance for the further development of DCNQA-based and other kinds of non-fullerene acceptors for PSCs. The performance of the acceptors can also be improved by tuning the device architectures, donors, interfacial materials and so on. According to recent reports,8,9 we believe that adopting A–D–A molecules that using oligothiophene as the central unit and DCNQA as flanked unit should improve carrier mobility of the compounds. Besides, careful molecular structure modification is required to minimize the steric hindrance and give a more planar molecular geometry. Research on further optimizing the molecular structures and device architecture is now underway in our lab.

4.4 Device fabrication and characterization
The ITO-coated glass was pre-cleaned and treated with plasma for 5 min. A 35 nm PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) layer was spin coated and baked at 120 °C for 10 min. The device was then transferred to a nitrogen glove box. A blend of 10 mg P3HT and 10 mg acceptor was dissolved into 1 mL of chlorobenzene and stirred for 2 days. The solution was spin-coated onto the substrate at 500 rpm for 60 s, followed by thermal annealing at 170 °C for 10 min. Finally, 0.5 nm LiF and 100 nm Al were subsequently thermally deposited under a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The active area of each pixel was 2 × 2.5 mm2. The reference device was fabricated with the architecture of [ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/P3HT:PC61BM (110 nm)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm)]. A blend of P3HT (15 mg) and PC61BM (15 mg) was dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (1 mL) and stirred for 2 days. The active layer was formed by spin-coating at 700 rpm for 60 s. The film was dried in a covered glass petri dish and then annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. The solar cell performance of the device was tested under 1 Sun, AM 1.5 full spectrum solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech. Inc.) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell traced to the National Institute of Metrology, China. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under light and in the dark were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a Q Test Station 2000 (Crowntech Inc. USA) under ambient conditions. AFM (by Burker Dimension ICON) was carried out directly on the surface of the fabricated devices in the mapping mode under ambient conditions. The AFM images and RMS values were drawn and calculated by using the software program NanoScope.
