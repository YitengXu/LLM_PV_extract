    , Accepted 17th May 2019First published on 18th May 2019AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) perovskites are promising candidates for perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) due to their superior stability compared to their three-dimensional counterparts. While the effects of processing conditions, e.g. the choice of solvent, temperature and additives have been widely studied, fewer studies have been carried out to investigate the influence of underlying substrates on the growth of 2D perovskites. In this work, a thin poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) interface layer is applied on top of the hole transporting poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) layer to modulate the formation of 2D perovskite films with a nominal composition of PEA2MA3.5FA0.5Pb5I16 calculated from precursors. 2D perovskite films grown on the PFN layer have better surface coverage and reproducibility due to the improved surface wettability. We also discovered that the PFN layer reduces the formation of the n = 1 phase in the 2D perovskite films, resulting in an enhanced light absorption. Besides, the insertion of PFN reduces trap-assisted recombination, without affecting the charge extraction. The optimized planar-structured PVSCs with PFN exhibit the best PCE of 12.78%, which is a 24.3% enhancement compared to that of the devices without PFN. This work provides a new insight on improving the performance of 2D PVSCs by modifying the interface between the perovskite layer and hole transport layer in a p–i–n inverted planar structure.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials with a three-dimensional (3D) structure have been intensively studied for their applications in solar cells in the past decade. These efforts have brought the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) to over 23%, a level that can compete with those of their commercialized thin film counterparts.1–12 However, the instability of 3D perovskite solar cells remains a major obstacle to the commercialization of this technology. Therefore, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites with the chemical formula of  (A is the spacer cation, including CH3(CH2)3NH3+ (BA+), C6H5(CH2)2NH3+ (PEA+), NH3C4H9COO+, etc., A′ is CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+ or Cs+, B is Pb2+ or Sn2+, and n ≥ 2) are currently attracting enormous research interest due to their promising properties towards better stability.13,14 In order to make efficient PVSCs based on 2D perovskites, one of the key aspects is to grow high-quality 2D perovskite films with an out-of-plane orientation, due to the negative effects of organic spacers in 2D perovskites on charge transport. Up to now, processing with additives, hot-casting and solvent engineering have been proved to be effective in obtaining such 2D perovskite films, which result in a rapid increase of PCE over 15% for the state-of-the-art PVSCs using 2D perovskites.15–26
Besides the composition and processing method of their precursor solutions, the growth of perovskite films is also affected by the nature of the underlying surface. For example, Huang et al. reported that methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) grains grown on a non-wetting surface had a very large average aspect ratio of 2.3–7.9, which significantly improved the device performance.27 Recently, it has also been shown that introducing a thin poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) layer between 3D perovskites and charge transport layers can improve the spreading of the precursor solution and reduce interfacial losses.28–30 This led to efficient PVSCs with PCEs over 20% as well as perovskite light emitting diodes with external quantum efficiency over 14%.29,30 Nevertheless, to date, fewer studies have been dedicated to exploitation of the influence of underlying layers on the growth of 2D perovskites.
Inspired by the work done on 3D perovskites, in this work, we applied an extremely thin layer of PFN (<5 nm) on the hydrophobic poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) to assist the formation of high-quality 2D perovskite films, and achieved remarkably enhanced solar cell performance. Using the 2D perovskite PEA2MA3.5FA0.5Pb5I16 (PEA: phenylethylammonium, FA: formamidinium) with a ternary organic cation as an archetype, we investigated the effect of the PFN layer on the quality of 2D perovskite films and showed that the PEA2MA3.5FA0.5Pb5I16 perovskite films grown on PFN, a more hydrophilic substrate, are much smoother and have better coverage than those grown on pristine PTAA. Furthermore, the PFN layer also leads to the formation of 2D phases with a relatively larger n. The optimized planar-structured PVSCs with the PFN layer achieved a maximum PCE of 12.78%, which is 24.3% higher than the PCE of PVSCs without PFN (10.28%). This work provides a new insight on improving the performance of 2D PVSCs by introducing a PFN layer between the perovskite layer and hole transport layer in a p–i–n inverted planar structure.
2. Results and discussion
The PVSC with a device structure of ITO/(PTAA/PFN)/PEA2MA3.5FA0.5Pb5I16/PC61BM/BCP/Ag is schematically presented in Fig. 1a. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PVSCs based on PTAA and PTAA/PFN are shown in Fig. 1b. The relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The best PTAA device achieved a PCE of 10.28% in reverse scanning, with a current density (Jsc) of 13.31 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.14 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.68. The forward scanning on the same device gives a PCE of 9.75%, which is 5.15% lower than that of the reverse one. Compared to the PTAA devices, the PCE of PTAA/PFN devices in reverse scanning is significantly enhanced from 10.28% to 12.78%, due to the increased Jsc and FF (Voc remains constant). Besides, the PTAA/PFN device exhibits a lower hysteresis than that with PTAA, showing a 4.53% difference in reverse and forward scans. We also studied the effect of thickness of PFN on the device performance. As shown in Fig. S2†, the Jsc of the PTAA/PFN device decreases with increasing PFN thickness. Because of the insulating character of PFN, a thicker PFN layer will hinder charge transport, resulting in a decline in PCE. In our case, a thin PFN layer, less than 5 nm, is deposited on PTAA to fabricate the device. From Fig. 1c, we can see that the external quantum efficiency (EQE) response for the PTAA/PFN device is higher than that of the PTAA-based device in almost the whole spectrum range. The integrated current density (Jcal) from EQE curves (Fig. 1c) is 13.07 mA cm−2 for the PTAA devices and 14.12 mA cm−2 for the PTAA/PFN devices. A stable PCE output of 9.2% and 12.27% is obtained for the PTAA-based and PTAA/PFN-based devices, respectively, and the photocurrent remains stable for 300 s during the photocurrent measurement, as shown in Fig. 1d. We also analyzed the PCE histograms based on 30 individual devices for these two groups of solar cells. As seen from Fig. 1e, the PTAA/PFN devices show a narrower distribution of PCEs, suggesting a better reproducibility.

In addition to high PCE, good ambient stability is also an important indicator of device performance, so we performed a device stability measurement by storing the unsealed PVSCs under a humidity of 50 ± 5%. As seen in Fig. 1f, both devices maintain the initial PCE for 5 days. With the extension of testing time, the PCE of the PTAA-based device drops sharply retaining only about 45% of its original PCE after two weeks of storage. However the decay curve of the PTAA/PFN-based device decreases slowly over time, retaining more than 60% of its initial PCE after 30 days. To further study the stability of the two devices, we performed device stability testing under heating and illumination conditions (Fig. S3†). From Fig. S3†, the PTAA/PFN device exhibits better light and thermal stability than the PTAA device. From the XRD evolution of perovskite films before and after humidity, heat and light aging (Fig. S4†), it can be seen that both perovskite films on PTAA and PTAA/PFN exhibit high stability under these three conditions for two weeks. These results suggest that PFN-modified devices have better resistance to adverse external conditions.
In order to understand how PFN affects the energy level alignment between PTAA and the perovskite layer, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was conducted to get the energy levels for PTAA, PTAA/PFN and PEA2MA3.5FA0.5Pb5I16. The onset (Ei) and cutoff (Ecut-off) energy regions in the UPS of the surface measurement for the glass/ITO/PTAA and the glass/ITO/(PTAA/PFN) substrate are displayed in Fig. 2a and b. Obviously, two surfaces have the same values of Ei and Ecut-off, suggesting that their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are the same. That is to say, the introduction of the ultra-thin PFN layer does not influence the surface electronic structure of PTAA, which is well consistent with that from other reports.28 The energies of Ei and Ecut-off are 0.43 eV and 16.32 eV, respectively, and the HOMO level is calculated to be 5.3 eV using the equation φ = 21.22 − (Ecut-off − Ei). We can calculate the HOMO level of the PEA2MA3.5FA0.5Pb5I16 perovskite to be 5.6 eV according to the values of Ei and Ecut-off in Fig. S1†. The same matched energy levels between two substrates and the perovskite may result in a similar voltage output (Table 1). The energy-level diagram of the planar PVSCs with a structure of ITO/(PTAA/PFN)/PEA2MA3.5FA0.5Pb5I16/PC61BM/BCP/Ag is shown in Fig. 2c.

From the UPS measurement, we can conclude that the device performance enhancement is not due to better energy level alignment. Therefore, we assume such improvement is related to the effects of the PFN layer on 2D perovskite growth, and perform a series of characterization techniques on the substrates and the films obtained on the corresponding substrates. The contact angle reduced from 91.6° for the pristine PTAA film to 79.8° for the PTAA film coated with PFN, indicating improved wettability after coating with PFN (insets of Fig. 3a and b). The crystallinity and crystal phase of the PEA2MA3.5FA0.5Pb5I16 perovskite films deposited on PTAA and PTAA/PFN substrates were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Fig. 3e). We observed two dominant planes at 14.1° and 28.4°, which represented the (111) and (222) lattice planes of PEA2MA3.5FA0.5Pb5I16 perovskite, respectively. From Table S1†, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (111) peak narrows down from 0.25° (PTAA/PFN) to 0.24° (PTAA) and the peak intensity increases from 9.89 × 106 (PTAA/PFN) to 1.75 × 107 (PTAA), indicating the higher crystallinity of the perovskite films coated on PTAA. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3c and d) also showed that larger grains are obtained for the film prepared on PTAA without PFN. These results indicate that a hydrophobic surface (PTAA surface) will also promote the growth of 2D perovskites with large grains and high crystallinity, as is the case for 3D perovskites.28,31–33

Insets in (a) and (b) are photos of perovskite films and the contact angles of water based on PTAA and PTAA/PFN. X-ray diffraction patterns (e) of perovskite films on PTAA and PTAA/PFN. 
However, as shown by the digital image in the inset of Fig. 3a, a discontinuous 2D perovskite film was obtained on the PTAA layer without PFN due to the poor wettability. This means an over-hydrophobic surface can cause severe processing issues resulting in incomplete film coverage that is particularly detrimental to large-area devices. Furthermore, we also observed an obvious surface fluctuation from the top-view SEM and AFM images for this film (Fig. 3a and S5†). In our case, the additional PFN layer provides an effective balance between the high crystallinity and wettability. The 2D perovskite film grown on PTAA/PFN can homogenously cover the whole substrate with a smoother surface though the surfaces of PTAA and PTAA/PFN show similar roughness (Fig. S6†). This explains the better reproducibility of the devices made from PTAA/PFN. Moreover, continuous 2D perovskite films with a smooth surface are more difficult to be invaded by moisture when exposed to ambient air, which explains the enhanced storage stability of the PTAA/PFN devices (Fig. 1f).
In order to understand the increased Jsc values of the PTAA/PFN device, we further investigated the composition of the 2D perovskite films deposited on PTAA and PTAA/PFN by conducting photoluminescence (PL) and UV-Vis absorption measurements. On the one hand, although the perovskite was nominally prepared as “n = 5”, we observed the coexistence of multiple perovskite phases with different n values in both of the 2D perovskite films, which is well consistent with that from other reports.34,35 This can be confirmed by multiple emission peaks in Fig. 4a and b as well as the multiple absorption peaks in Fig. 4c. On the other hand, we can clearly see the difference in the distribution of 2D perovskite phases in the films prepared on PTAA and PTAA/PFN. The film grown on the PTAA/PFN layer shows lower PL intensity for the n = 1 phase and higher PL intensity for n > 1 phases, compared to the 2D perovskite film on PTAA. This is in line with the UV-Vis spectra, indicating that the film coated on the PTAA/PFN layer has higher absorbance in the range corresponding to the phases with n > 1 but lower absorbance in the range corresponding to the n = 1 phase. Therefore, both PL and UV-Vis measurements imply that the insertion of the PFN layer promotes the growth of 2D phases with n > 1 that can absorb more light and lead to an increase in Jsc. The n value depends on the local molar ratio of the components in the precursor solution.34 PEA+ has the strongest hydrophobicity among the components in the precursor solution, so PEA+ tends to aggregate on PTAA with a similar hydrophobic surface, which increases the concentration of PEA+ near the PTAA substrate. As a result, the n = 1 phase is formed on the PTAA side of the film. The coating of PFN onto the PTAA film reduces the hydrophobicity of the substrate, which decreases the concentration of PEA+ at the substrate. The formation of the n = 1 phase was consequently suppressed. It is worth noting that both films grown on PTAA and PTAA/PFN show a vertical distribution of 2D phases with different n values, with the small-n phases located near the glass side. As evidenced by the PL spectra, the peaks attributed to the emission of small-n phases are much stronger when the excitation beam is from the glass side. Such vertical distribution has been previously reported by other groups.34,35 Due to the aggregation of PEA+ on the PTAA surface, a small n phase forms on the PTAA side of the film and larger n phases are generated on the other side, resulting in vertical distribution of various n phases in perovskite films.

We also conducted time-resolved PL measurements on 2D perovskite films based on PTAA/PFN and PTAA substrates to investigate the effect of the PFN layer on trap states and charge transport (Fig. 5a). At sufficiently low fluences a mono-exponential decay is usually observed, indicative of an underlying non-radiative trap-induced recombination that gradually reduces the density of emitting species, and hence the PL signal.36 In terms of monoexponential carrier lifetime (τ), the value (163 ns) for the 2D perovskite film grown on PTAA/PFN is about twice as much as that of the one grown on PTAA (81 ns). The prolongation of carrier lifetime can be attributed to a substantial reduction of these interfacial losses between the perovskite and transport layers, reducing trap-assisted recombination,29 which may be confirmed by the J–V curves in the dark state of the devices (Fig. 5b). The PTAA/PFN-based device shows lower dark current than the PTAA-based one, which indicates reduced trap state density, resulting in an improved FF and lower hysteresis.37,38 Interestingly, the perovskite films grown on different substrates exhibited a similar and fast bi-exponential decay. As reported previously,39 the fast decay is regarded as a result of the quenching of free carriers in the perovskite domain through transport to the hole transport layer. Hence, the similarity in fast decay indicates that the introduction of the PFN layer does not harm the charge extraction from the perovskite layer to the PTAA layer.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the beneficial effects of the additional thin PFN layer on PTAA on the growth of 2D perovskite films. First, the PFN layer improves the surface wettability of PTAA in such a way that we can achieve 2D perovskite films with full-coverage of the surface but without significantly reducing the grain size and crystallinity. Second, the PFN layer reduces the formation of the n = 1 phase in the 2D perovskite films, resulting in an enhanced light absorption. Third, the insertion of PFN reduces trap-assisted recombination, without affecting the charge extraction. By virtue of these effects, using a 2D perovskite with a nominal composition of PEA2MA3.5FA0.5Pb5I16, we achieved the best PCE of 12.78% in PTAA/PFN devices, which is 24.3% higher than that in PTAA devices. Therefore, this work provides a new insight on improving the performance and reproducibility of 2D PVSCs by engineering the properties of the underlying surface where the 2D perovskite is grown.

All reagents and solvents were used directly if not specified otherwise. Other materials were used directly.
Device fabrication
ITO glass was cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, isopropanol, and ethanol successively, and each process is a 15 minute ultrasonic bath, followed by a drying process under nitrogen flow. They were also treated with ultraviolet ozone for 15 min before use. The thin layers of PTAA and PFN were sequentially spin coated onto the cleaned ITO at 6000 rpm for 45 s from PTAA solution in toluene (2 mg mL−1) and 3000 rpm for 30 s from PFN solution in methanol (0.5 mg mL−1), followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. PEAI, MAI, FAI and PbI2 were mixed in a molar ratio of 2:3.5:0.5:5 (n = 5) in a DMSO and DMF (7:3 by volume) mixed solvent with the concentration of 0.6 M (based on PbI2). Before spin-coating the perovskite layer, the perovskite precursor solution and PTAA/PFN substrates were heated to 70 °C on a hotplate. Then the hot precursor solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 45 s onto the PTAA/PFN layer and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. After that, PC61BM (7 mg mL−1 in chloroform) and BCP (0.5 mg mL−1 in absolute ethanol) were coated consecutively at 2000 rpm for 45 s and 3000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. At last, 100 nm Ag was deposited in a vacuum chamber with a high vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa to finish the device fabrication.
Measurements and characterization
The J–V measurement was performed using a solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech) along with the AM 1.5 G spectrum whose intensity was calibrated using a certified standard silicon solar cell (SRC-2020, Enlitech) at 100 mV cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) data were obtained by using a solar-cell spectral-response measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech). The UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained using a UV-2450 UV-Vis Shimadzu spectrophotometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured by using a Rigaku D/max-2550PC X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 nm). Surface morphologies and cross-sectional images of the films were obtained using a SEM (Quanta 400). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS) measurements were performed on an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo) system, and the incident light energy for UPS measurement was 21.22 eV. The steady-state PL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained with an FLSP920 Spectro fluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 470 nm and 405 nm, respectively. For humidity-stability measurement, the PVSCs were kept in a humidity-controlled cabinet (Hr = 50 ± 5%, Bossmen, PR1852(A)-SH). We performed a heat stability measurement by placing devices/films on an 85 °C hotplate in a glovebox, and conducted a light stability measurement via illuminating the devices/films under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) in an air environment. The thickness of PTAA and PTAA/PFN layers was measured by using a DektakXT Stylus Profiling System (BRUKER). The thickness of the PFN layer was determined by measuring the thickness variation of the PTAA film before and after PFN coating.
