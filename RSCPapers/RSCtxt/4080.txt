    , Accepted 20th May 2022First published on 20th May 2022AbstractAn Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction was grown on a Si single crystal substrate by subsequent thermal and plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) in situ. The band offsets of the heterointerface were then studied by consecutive removal of the layers by argon sputtering, followed by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of Al2O3 are found to be 1.1 eV below and 2.3 eV above those of ZnO, resulting in a type-I staggered heterojunction. An apparent reduction of ZnO to elemental Zn in the interface region was detected in the Zn 2p core level and Zn L3MM Auger spectra. This suggests an interface formation different from previous models. The reduction of ZnO to Zn in the interface region accompanied by the creation of oxygen vacancies in ZnO results in an upward band bending at the interface. Therefore, this study suggests that interfacial properties such as the band bending as well as the valence and conduction band offsets should be in situ controllable to a certain extent by careful selection of the process parameters.
I. Introduction
In recent years, the fabrication of nanoscale heterojunctions has gained much attention due to a broad range of technological applications, ranging from low-dimensional photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices to inorganic–organic transistors.1–4 These nanostructures are fabricated by alternating nano-sized layers of different materials with discrete thicknesses and individual optical and electrical properties.5–8 The investigation of their properties as well as the band alignment at the heterojunction interface plays a pivotal role in evaluating the efficiency of devices.9–12
Different methods have been applied for the deposition of oxide-based materials, including magnetron sputtering,13 sol–gel techniques,14 pulsed laser deposition,15 chemical vapor deposition,16 molecular beam epitaxy (MBE),17 and atomic layer deposition (ALD).18 The usefulness of these diverse methods for growing interfaces used in devices can be characterized by several criteria. One typical requirement of all these methods, except for sol–gel and ALD, is a high process temperature. However, films prepared by the sol–gel method at low temperature also need a post-deposition heat treatment at high temperatures up to 800 °C to minimize contamination of the films; yet, this step can create problems when delicate substrates are used, rendering the use of high-temperature methods challenging for device applications. In particular, these approaches cannot be applied when thermally sensitive organic materials and polymer substrates are used, e.g., in organic light-emitting diodes and flexible displays where low-temperature deposition is necessary.19
Among the aforementioned deposition techniques, ALD18 is an exceptional low-temperature deposition method that relies on self-limiting reactions between gas phase molecules and the solid surface in a well-defined cyclical fashion. This growth mechanism facilitates excellent film conformity and uniformity even over large areas as well as accurately controlled film thicknesses in the range from an atomic layer to several tens of nanometers,20 which is why this deposition method has already been utilized for the production of thin film electroluminescent display panels.21 Since then, ALD has been widely used for manufacturing many complex electronic devices.22 Furthermore, in plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) radicals and/or ions are introduced to react with the chemisorbed precursor molecules, thereby pre-activating the molecules and increasing chemical reaction rates at comparatively lower temperatures.23 Consequently, this modification widens the applicable ALD (i.e., temperature) window to the lower end, which is crucial for the deposition on thermally sensitive substrates. A beneficial side effect is that at a lower temperature interlayer diffusion rates are also decreased, suggesting the formation of sharper interfaces in heterostructures.
Among the transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), zinc oxide (ZnO) is a promising candidate in optoelectronic applications due to its large values for the direct band gap (∼3.3 eV),24 dielectric constant, thermal stability,25 electron concentration (>1019 cm−3),26 electron saturation velocity (3.2 × 107 cm s−1), critical electric field (3.5 MV cm−1),27 and exciton binding energy of 0.06 eV at room temperature.28 These are all motives for its wide implementation in the semiconductor industry, a use also owing to its abundance and lower cost compared to other TCOs, such as indium tin-doped oxide.29
The interface of ZnO with Ga2O3 has been investigated recently.17,30 The absence of p-type Ga2O3, like for most TCOs, has initiated studies of n-type heterostructures with different band gaps. These could serve as an alternative means to study the independent manipulation of carrier injection or carrier confinement. Junctions of this n–n type would be a way to circumvent TCO-based electronics that rely solely on Schottky-type rectifying, i.e., on devices like Schottky and metal–insulator semiconductor field-effect transistors (MISFETs),31 otherwise a sizable valence band offset (VBO) for MISFETs is decisive due to the high leakage current from Schottky emissions.32 According to the literature, in bare ZnO films zinc interstitials or oxygen vacancies are dominant and act as an n-type dopant.29 Therefore, either Al doping or deposition of Al2O3 materials could facilitate the tuning of the specific properties of ZnO-related structures, also drawing advantages from other excellent material characteristics of Al2O3 such as its high dielectric constant (∼9)33 and thermal conductivity (30 W m−1 K−1).34 The breakdown field for bulk Al2O3 has been reported to be 10 MV cm−1 and even increases to 30 MV cm−1 for thin films.35 The reported band gap values for ALD-prepared Al2O3 differ, so that wider band gap values of 6.7 eV (ref. 36) obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and of 7.1 eV inferred from electron loss spectroscopy37 are in contrast to the values of just ∼2.25 eV from transmittance measurements and ∼3 eV from ellipsometry.38 This may have its reason in the occurrence of an Urbach tail.39 Furthermore, thin films of Al2O3 in combination with other TCOs have widened the field of optical and electronic applications.40
In this context, ALD-prepared Al2O3/Zn0.8Al0.2O heterojunctions41 are very promising due to their low preparation costs, relatively high stability, and non-toxicity. However, it should be noted that, because of the chemical instability of the surface and the large surface electron concentration for ZnO, the electronic band structure and electrical properties of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction have to be studied in detail. Liu et al. investigated the interface between differently oriented surfaces of single crystalline ZnO bulk substrates and low-temperature (100 °C) ALD-prepared Al2O3 films.36,42 They found the largest VBO of 1.2 eV and the best electrical properties for the polar and oxygen-terminated ZnO (000) surface.42 In the present study, a different route yields a very similar VBO by applying solely low-temperature ALD for interface creation.
Al2O3/ZnO bilayers (nanolaminates) and Al2O3-surrounded ZnO quantum dots prepared exclusively by thermal ALD (TALD) were studied by Chaaya et al.43 and Viter et al.44 as well as by Li et al.45 While these studies mainly addressed the structural and optical properties, we here focus preferentially on the interface electronic properties resulting from a mixed TALD and PEALD process.
To this end, a high-quality Al2O3/ZnO thin film heterojunction was prepared using PEALD for the Al2O3 film and TALD for the ZnO layer. Both ALD processes were conducted at 200 °C, i.e., at a low substrate temperature (Ts). To investigate the band alignment, the valence and conduction band offsets (CBO) as well as the chemical composition at the heterojunction interface, XPS combined with ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) in the valence band region was employed. For this purpose, we reconstructed a chemical depth profile of the Al2O3/ZnO stack from a step-by-step quantitative XPS analysis in the bulk and at the interface. By utilizing data from XPS, UPS, and optical methods we find band alignment in the interface region (with the VBO and CBO of Al2O3 shifted by 1.1 eV and 2.3 eV with respect to ZnO), a type-I staggered heterojunction, and an apparent reduction of ZnO to elemental Zn in the interface region, suggesting a certain degree of tunability of the interfacial properties by adjusting the growth parameters.
II. Experimental
A. Sample preparation
Al2O3/ZnO films were deposited on a n-type (100)-oriented silicon substrate in a SI ALD reactor (SENTECH Instruments GmbH)46 equipped with an ellipsometer for in situ ALD real-time monitoring (SENTECH, ALD Real Time Monitor).47 The used multifunctional ALD system provides two different operation modes of either thermal ALD or PEALD. In this study, the TALD process was employed for the deposition of a 59 nm thick ZnO layer on top of the Si substrate using a diethylzinc (DEZ) precursor and H2O vapor. Each ZnO ALD cycle consists of a 40 ms pulse of DEZ, a 5 s purge pulse, an 80 ms pulse of H2O vapor, and a 5 s purge step. The through-reactor flow rates of high-purity (99.999%) N2 carrier (for DEZ) and purging gas and water were adjusted to 60 and 80 sccm. Subsequently, the deposition of a 10 nm thick Al2O3 film on top of the ZnO layer was performed by PEALD using trimethylaluminum (TMA) as an Al source and oxygen (O2) plasma as a co-reactant and applying a true remote capacitively coupled plasma source46 with a plasma power of 200 W. The flow rates of N2 as a carrier (for TMA) and purging gas and high-purity O2 (99.998%) as a PEALD co-reactant were adjusted to 40 and 150 sccm, respectively. The ALD cycle of Al2O3 comprises a 60 ms pulse of TMA, a 2 s purge pulse, a 4 s O2 plasma pulse and a 1 s purge step. During the deposition, the substrate temperature during both processes was fixed to 200 °C. The detailed ALD parameters are listed in Table 1.

B. Characterization
Data from in situ ellipsometry47 taken routinely during the growth of the films were used to determine the film thickness and homogeneity (cf. ESI section 1†).
Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements were performed to determine the crystallinity and thicknesses of the films (cf. ESI section 2†), the latter being confirmed by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the interface (cf. ESI section 3†). Further details are provided in the ESI.†
Chemical characterization of the prepared layers was performed with an XPS system equipped with a hemispherical analyzer (PHOIBOS HSA3500) using a Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) X-ray radiation source. The take-off angle of photoelectrons was set to 90°, i.e., normal to the sample surface. To avoid ambiguities arising from surface oxidation and contamination as well as performing depth profiling, the sample was sputtered from a cold cathode Ar+ ion beam source (ISE 5, Scienta Omicron) with an accelerating voltage of 2 keV at a pressure of 4 × 10−6 mbar. XPS was performed after each consecutive sputtering step where increasing time intervals were chosen until reaching the heterojunction interface region and afterwards the pure underlying ZnO layer. The survey scan and core level (CL) spectra were obtained at analyzer pass energies of 50 and 20 eV with energy steps of 0.5 and 0.1 eV, respectively. The collected XPS data were quantitatively analyzed using CasaXPS software to determine the depth-dependent chemical composition as well as to perform the peak decomposition of the CL spectra. Here, the measured peak intensities were weighted by the respective atomic sensitivity factors,48 which have additionally been corrected for the transmission function of the used analyzer49 as described in our previous work.50 Peak fitting was performed by assuming pseudo-Voigt (mixed Gaussian/Lorentzian) line shapes, subtraction of the secondary electron background by means of the Tougaard function, and constraining the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and peak position of the CLs to vary only within a narrow energy range. The XPS decomposition of the CLs and the determination of the Al2O3 band gap were performed after initially calibrating the binding energy (BE) scale using the C 1s CL with an energy position of 284.8 eV.
The high-resolution and surface-sensitive nature of UPS in combination with sputtering enables probing the valence band spectra of the bulk layers at the heterojunction interface. UPS measurements were carried out using the same system and sputter steps as in XPS; however, a He I (21.2 eV) radiation source and a pass energy of 10 eV were used. Prior to collecting the data, a calibration process based on the experimentally observed broadening of the Fermi edge of thermally evaporated pure silver (99.99%) was performed. From that, the resolution of the UPS spectra was estimated to be ∼0.1 eV. In UPS analysis, the valence band maximum (VBM) was determined by the extrapolation of a linear fit to the high energy flank of the valence band onset corresponding to the valence band edge.51 Here, the position of the Fermi energy was used to calibrate the binding energy scale in the valence band data.
III. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XPS survey spectra (−5 to 1100 eV) of the Al2O3-bulk, interface region, and ZnO-bulk, respectively. The photoemission signals as well as Auger lines are associated with the main components of Zn, Al and O, pointing to well-prepared and carbon-free layers. In all spectra the Ar 2p3/2 level appears at a BE of 243 eV, i.e., at 20 eV higher kinetic energy than the onset of the Zn L3MM Auger lines. It should also be mentioned that the weak Ar 2s signal detected at 320 eV is far from the Zn L3MM multiplet onset. Therefore, these Auger lines can be unambiguously used for analysis.
 Fig. 1  XPS survey spectra of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction obtained with Mg Kα radiation. The Al2O3 spectrum corresponds to 3 min sputtering, the interface spectrum to 24 min sputtering and the ZnO spectrum to 49 min sputtering. The Ar-related signals most likely originate from adventitious Ar implanted during sputtering. 
The XPS composition depth profile of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction is illustrated in Fig. 2. The presence of Al, Zn, and O without any distribution of residual carbon confirms the perfect ALD reaction at a Ts of 200 °C. The atomic percentage of oxygen slightly decreases from 72.4% in the bulk of Al2O3via 72.8% at the interface to 47.7% in the ZnO bulk layer. The metal to oxygen ratio is not ideal for the Al2O3 film, pointing to some excess oxygen not bonded to a metal cation, e.g., O–H groups, as discussed below. At the interface, in principle more than one component contributing to the O1s region may be expected; owing to our limited spectral resolution we cannot unambiguously distinguish between the different oxides, making it impossible to determine the individual chemical compositions of the film and the substrate at the interface. Furthermore, we note that Fig. 2 should be regarded just as a method to qualitatively locate the interface, whereas the exact chemical composition may deviate owing to the different probing depths of the individual core levels employed.
 Fig. 2  Elemental concentrations within the Al2O3/ZnO heterostructure depending on the sputtering depth as determined by XPS. The vertical dashed line marks the beginning of the interface region. 
Similar to the metal–oxygen ratio, the Al/Zn ratio is also seen to decrease when approaching the interface. The absence of carbon even between the oxide films most probably is a direct consequence of the consecutive in situ deposition of the oxide layers without breaking the vacuum of the reactor.

Fig. 3 shows the decomposition of the O 1s spectra recorded at various depths near the heterojunction. Each O 1s spectrum in the bulk and at the interface was separated into distinct components (two sub-peaks for Al2O3 as well as at the interface, and three sub-peaks for ZnO). Their relative intensities were analyzed and are shown in Fig. 3. In the Al2O3 and ZnO bulks, (after 3 min and 49 min sputtering, respectively) the dominating major peaks at 530.9 ± 0.1 eV have been assigned to oxygen bonded to metals (O–Al and O–Zn). The peak at a higher BE of 533.0 ± 0.5 eV corresponds to defects, vacancies, or, most likely, hydroxyl groups (O–H bonds).47 In addition, for ZnO the weak signal centered at 529.5 ± 0.1 eV is tentatively attributed to excess oxygen and probably arises from incomplete purging after the H2O co-reaction within the TALD of ZnO.52 The formation of O–H groups originates from the deposition process, in which the H2O oxidant in TALD and/or O2 plasma with higher oxidation potential in the PEALD process introduce side products as previously observed.53 The concentration of O–H groups might be reduced by increasing the Ts value, causing more complete reactions between the metal precursor molecules and residual O–H groups.54 However, a temperature increase might also trigger the formation of oxygen vacancies especially in the ZnO film, resulting in an enhancement of Zn interstitials as reported in the recent literature.55

The determination of the band gap using optical methods is often not possible when the deposited layers are very thin or when the band gap is indirect. An alternative method utilizing XPS core level spectra is to measure the peak position of a respective core level together with the onset of its inelastic energy loss.56 The investigation of this inelastic excitation onset is methodically related to loss spectroscopy. It complements other techniques such as optical absorption or electron energy loss spectroscopy and provides further information about the band-to-band electronic transitions as well as the presence and location of defect states in the bulk and/or at the interface.57,58
To investigate the inelastic loss features, one preferentially picks the most intense photoemission peak in the core level spectrum to obtain an appropriate signal-to-noise ratio. For our heterojunction the on-top deposited film is the thin Al2O3 layer, and in this case the largest signal corresponds to the O 1s core level (cf.Fig. 1) centered at 530.9 eV. The O 1s core level spectrum of the Al2O3 layer is shown in the inset of Fig. 4. Obviously, weak inelastic loss features can be observed in a broad region at higher BE marked by the rectangle. To find the band gap energy, the zero level was determined as the baseline, and a linear fit was applied to estimate the onset of inelastic losses, following previous approaches from the literature.59Fig. 4 (main panel) shows the enlarged selected region and illustrates the linear regression to the inelastic loss spectra in which the electron energy loss (EEL) was calculated by subtracting the measured BE in the O 1s region from the energy position of the O 1s “elastic” peak; afterwards it was plotted with respect to the measured intensities. The intersection point of the extrapolated linear fit with the zero-level baseline delivers the onset energy of the inelastic losses and was found to be 537.6 eV. Then, the band gap is given by the BE difference between the onset of inelastic losses and the elastic core level peak (here, Eg = Eloss − EO 1s = 6.7 eV). This value is in excellent agreement with the reported band gaps of ALD Al2O3 films determined by the same method,60 including ALD-grown amorphous Al2O3 deposited on a ZnO single crystal.36
 Fig. 4  Measurement of the band gap for the Al2O3 film by determining the onset of the electron energy loss in the O 1s core level region. Note that in the inset the BE axis has been reversed. 
It should be taken into account that in the O 1s loss region, the onset of the inelastic background is not very pronounced and the slope of the background is small, leading to some uncertainty in the value of the fundamental gap, which can be estimated for this linear fit analysis to be ±0.1 eV. Moreover, defect states in the Al2O3 layer (as showcased by XPS decomposition of the O 1s core level in Fig. 3c) have been reported to become stabilized in the vicinity of the VB edge and might induce dangling bonds. However, the abundance of this defect and associated in-gap states is lower than the electron density in the VB; nonetheless, they are observable in UPS. Consequently, their occurrence may lead to a slight shift of the onset of energy loss to higher BE.61 For the further discussion, we note that the value of the Al2O3 band gap does not change with sputter time.
For the determination of the band gap of bulk-like ZnO (after 49 min sputtering) the presence of a 22% intense side peak, most probably representing O–H bonds in the asymmetric O 1s core level of the ZnO layer (as shown in Fig. 3a), is an obstacle to ascertaining the onset of the loss spectrum. For TCOs with a smaller band gap (below ∼3.5 eV), the onset of the inelastic EEL spectra is located close to the onset energy of the highly-intense elastic peak and restricts the band gap determination.62,63 Therefore, based on the literature and with respect to the position of the Fermi edge, for the following analysis we estimated a band gap value of ∼3.3 eV for our ZnO film.64,65 This value is derived from a measurement of the valence band edge by UPS presented below. For a heavily n-type material the conduction band is within 50 to 100 meV of the conduction band minimum, as has been shown for Ga2O3.66 Therefore, the Fermi energy can be approximated by the conduction band minimum (CBM), which is close to the value (∼3.1 eV) determined from our ellipsometric data (not shown here).
To determine the VBO and CBO of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction, the data of XPS CLs and UPS VBM in the bulk layers as well as at the interface were analyzed. Fig. 5 shows the CLs of Al 2p and Zn 2p3/2 in addition to the position of the VBM in the bulk layers of Al2O3 and ZnO. For quantitative analysis, peak decomposition and linear fitting procedures were performed for the CLs and VBM in order to figure out the state of bonding in the CLs and the main position of the valence band leading edge, respectively. The energy separation of the Zn 2p3/2 and Al 2p CLs in the ZnO and Al2O3 bulks is illustrated in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b and c show symmetric profiles of the Zn 2p3/2 and Al 2p CLs, where both were fitted with single contributions located at 1022.4 and 76.2 ± 0.1 eV, and are assigned to metal oxygen bonds (Zn–O and Al–O) in the ZnO and Al2O3 bulk layers,67,68 where the VBM positions of 3.2 and 4.4 ± 0.1 eV were determined from UPS, correspondingly. The extracted parameters from Fig. 5 are summarized in Table 2.

An apparent presence of band tail spectra within the VBM edge extending to the Fermi level of the bulk layers is most likely associated with the emission bands of defects, which are produced through the sputtering process.69 In addition, intrinsic sources for band gap states are possible as reported for many TCOs. For example, these intrinsic states have been observed experimentally for Al2O3 and ZnO by resonant photoemission and are ascribed to polaronic, excitonic and charge transfer states.37,70 Furthermore, as UPS is very surface-sensitive, especially the TCOs with a smaller band gap around 3 eV are prone to forming electron charge accumulation layers at the surface. An example for OH-covered ZnO is given in the literature.21 Finally, He I satellites may be present and produce additional intensity in the gap.
The VBO of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction at the interface was calculated using the following equation based on the BE of the CLs and the position of the VBM:71 (1)where, [EZnOCL(b) − EZnOVBM(b)] is the BE difference between Zn 2p3/2 and the VBM of the underlying ZnO bulk layer,  is the BE difference between Al 2p and the VBM in the top Al2O3 bulk layer, and  is the ΔCLs of ZnO and Al2O3 at the interface, respectively, and the related values are represented in Table 2. According to eqn (1), a VBO of 1.1 ± 0.1 eV was determined at the interface of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction.
Accordingly, the CBO at the heterojunction interface of Al2O3/ZnO was ascertained based on the determined band gap and VBO, as follows: (2)where  is the difference in the band gaps of Al2O3 and ZnO, correspondingly. Pursuant to eqn (2), the CBO at the interface of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction was calculated to be 2.3 ± 0.1 eV.
The experimental uncertainty for the band alignment can be estimated from the FWHM of the peaks (100–200 meV as determined from UPS). It is therefore small (10%) in comparison with the size of band bending, which lies in the eV range. Furthermore, as we have confirmed that the sputtering process does not have a detrimental influence on our films (cf. ESI section 4†), it is very likely that the determined electronic structure is directly correlated with the sample heterostructure, especially since the results obtained far away from the interface agree with the published data of individual oxides.60,64,65 In addition, we ensured that our samples are structurally (cf. ESI section 1†) and chemically (repeated measurements on other regions of the 4-inch wafer) homogeneous. Considering the homogeneity of the heterostructure across the 4-inch wafer, we believe that the measurement of the electronic structure is representative for the investigated system.

Fig. 6 schematically demonstrates the band alignment of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction in which the CBM and VBM of the Al2O3 film are located higher and lower than their counterparts of the ZnO layer, hence resulting in a type-I band alignment. Band bending effects at the interface, which are not shown in Fig. 6 will, however, be discussed. Several sources of polarization, i.e. dipoles at interfaces and surfaces, exist. Single crystals used as substrates can have a polar face. It has been discussed for Al2O3 on different ZnO single crystal terminations that an oxygen polar ZnO (000) single crystal termination serving as a substrate leads to an upward band bending (BB) of Al2O3 and a downward BB at the ZnO side and induces negative charges at the heterojunction interface.42 For an Al2O3/m-plane ZnO (100) interface, where no polarization effects are present, the same authors have reported a smaller VBO of just 0.7 eV.36 Generally, the accumulation probability of electrons in the conduction band is more pronounced for the CBM of the n-doped ZnO film as it is located close to the Fermi level at the interface.72 Also, Lei et al.73 have previously discussed the effect of spontaneous polarization for interfaces of ZnO deposited on c-sapphire and have pointed out that due to the different spontaneous polarizations of Al2O3 and ZnO, negative charges are induced at the interface leading to an upward BB on the Al2O3 side, a mechanism also discussed for other systems.74 In our study, no polar single crystal terminations were used, instead amorphous (Al2O3) and polycrystalline (ZnO) ALD films (consistent with previous reports43,44) formed the heterojunction, respectively (cf. our GIXRD data in section 2 of the ESI†). Here, in principle, one could expect polarization contributions from nanocrystallites formed by ALD at 200 °C or strain-induced piezoelectric polarization at the interface. However, as alumina is amorphous, the major contribution to the polarization in the interface region will most likely stem from a different source, namely from the elemental Zn and the related vacancies, to be discussed below. Remarkably, we observed a similar VBO as found for polar ZnO surfaces.42

Our quantitative results significantly differ from some of the previous reports, suggesting that the type of interface creation by our sequential ALD in the same run and the surface properties play a role. As a minimal consensus with our results, all authors reported a type-I heterojunction, e.g., Lei et al. evaporated ZnO films by laser MBE on a c-sapphire single crystal with a large band gap of 9.0 eV, where a VBO of 3.59 eV and a CBO of 2.04 were reported.73 In contrast, an ALD Al2O3 layer on the ZnO (000) surface yields values (VBO = 1.2 eV, CBO = 2.1 eV)42 that are, taking into account our experimental accuracy, identical to our results. The authors ascribed the height of the VBO and the quality of the interface electrical characteristics to the fact that the reactivity of the precursors of the ALD with ZnO depends on the plane index of the surface. In particular, the chemical stability of ZnO (000) against their ALD reactants such as TMA and ozone is the highest, giving the lowest defect density and resulting in a larger VBO and better electrical interface properties. In this context it is remarkable that our interface preparation of amorphous (Al2O3) and polycrystalline (ZnO) films solely by in situ ALD produces similar results.
Further investigation of the band offsets in the Al2O3/ZnO interface region was carried out by monitoring the BE shift of the VBM and the CLs (Al 2p, Zn 2p3/2, and O 1s) in the bulk layers and at the interface. XPS depth profiling is widely used to characterize the surface BB relying on the detection of electrons photoemitted from different depths of the film.75,76 An inspection of the core level line shapes at different sputter times reveals a number of features. Beside their binding energy shifts to be discussed later, it is evident that some elements show an asymmetry at a certain sputter duration. While the line shape of the Al 2s and Al 2p levels is symmetrical for all sputter times up to 24 min (cf. ESI section 4 and Fig. S5†), the Zn 2p signal of the ZnO layer shows a clear asymmetry for sputter times of 12, 19, 21, and 24 min (i.e. in the interface region) that vanishes at 49 min (pure bulk ZnO), where both spin–orbit-split peaks become symmetric (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 core level line shapes after different sputter times. The scaling factors for the spectra for different sputter times of 12, 19, 21, 24, and 49 min applied are 80, 28.6, 22.9, 13.3, and 1.0, respectively. The emission at 1039 eV is most likely related to the Ar LMM Auger multiplet not affecting the analysis of the Zn 2p3/2 data. 
After calibrating the BE of the Zn 2p3/2 reference to the C 1s level, the asymmetric Zn 2p3/2 peak at the interface of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction (24 min sputtering) can well be decomposed into four components (as shown in Fig. 8).77 The weak peak located at a BE of 1019.2 ± 0.1 eV and the strong peak at 1020.5 ± 0.1 eV are attributed to Zn–Al and Zn–Zn bonds, respectively. The distinct peak at an energy position of 1021.7 ± 0.1 eV corresponds to Zn–O; the weak signal appearing at a higher BE of 1023.8 ± 0.1 eV is assigned to defects or most likely O–H groups,47 consistent with the represented O 1s decomposition (see Fig. 3). Alternatively, for Al2O3-surrounded ZnO quantum dots Li et al.45 reported an interface-related peroxide state Zn* that was shifted by 1.4 eV toward higher BE with respect to the Zn–O component; however, this finding is at variance with our shift of 2.1 eV, hence confirming the O–H assignment.
 Fig. 8  Peak decomposition of the Zn 2p3/2 CL of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction at the interface. 
To further investigate the Zn chemical environment, spectra of the Zn L3MM Auger were measured and are shown in Fig. 9. After 49 min sputtering, a pure ZnO layer is detected based on its Auger line shape exhibiting two peaks: a strong maximum at a kinetic energy of 988.1 eV and a shoulder at 991 eV, both characteristic for pure ZnO.78 In the interface layer region between 19 min and 24 min sputter duration, three peaks can be resolved: a small peak at 995.1 eV that is ascribed to metallic Zn, a second characteristic peak located at 991.6 eV representing metallic Zn, and a third peak at 987.6 eV attributed to ZnO. Comparing with the reference spectra,79 both peak energies and line shapes yield a very good match overall. A certain amount of Zn–Zn bonds appears in the interface region (see also Fig. 8). This means that in the interface region a substantial part of the Zn2+ ions in ZnO is reduced to Zn, which must be a property of the Al2O3/ZnO interface, since any signal of metallic Zn is missing in the data of the ZnO films recorded after 49 min sputtering, as described above. Based on extensive additional characterization, we exclude artifacts related to differential sputtering and assert that the observed CL and Auger results adequately reflect real changes in the chemical composition of the investigated samples (refer to the ESI, section 4 and Fig. S6†). Therefore, the Auger data fully support our findings from the core level spectra. The consequences for band alignment and interface properties will be discussed below.
 Fig. 9  Zn L3MM Auger spectra of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction at the interface and in the bulk of the ZnO layer. 
In Fig. 10 the change in the binding energy of the Al 2p, Al 2s, O 1s, and Zn 2p CLs as well as the position of the VBM are plotted versus sputter time. For the O 1s level, only the main peak ascribed to the oxygen–metal bond is shown. For the Zn 2p CL, only the ZnO related component is given for the sputter times of 24 and 49 min corresponding to the last spectrum of the interface region (with the highest and best detectable Zn–Zn and ZnO contributions, cf. Fig. 8) and the final CL position of the bulk ZnO film. For the other times (<24 min) the decomposition is more difficult due to weaker Zn signals. It is evident that all CLs show an upward BB when the sputter depth approaches the lower band gap material ZnO. Also a sizeable part of the BB is observed in the interface region. Since this interface is monitored by a stepwise removal of material, local fields must play an important role in the formation of the interface. These results are similar to the band alignment and BB at the n–n isotype hetero-interface obtained with α-Ga2O3 epitaxial layers grown on the a-plane ZnO (110) substrate and consecutive sputter steps as in our study.72
 Fig. 10  Dependence of core level binding energy and VBM position on sputter time. The core level binding energies have been shifted in energy to obtain a common mapping of band bending. 
In a simplified picture, the above-mentioned metallic Zn at the interface corresponds to O vacancies in the ZnO matrix leading to an enhanced electron concentration in the ZnO layer. This can be the reason for the upward BB in Al2O3 and the formation of a barrier for electrons to tunnel between the conduction bands of the constituents. This view is also corroborated from the above quoted results regarding the chemical composition at the interface, with oxygen-rich Al2O3 and Zn-rich ZnO. Furthermore, the observation of a constant Al2O3 band gap independent of the duration of sputtering is consistent with a parallel upward bending of the VB and the CB. The formation of aluminum-doped ZnO or zinc aluminum oxide at the interface with a band gap below 4 eV,80,81 and thereby undetectable by our band gap determination method, cannot be ruled out at the interface. However, the large constant value of the Al2O3 band gap points against such a significant alloying. Although it has previously been shown that ZnO/Al2O3 alloy films can in principle be grown with an arbitrary content of ZnO (i.e., 0 to 100%) by sequential ALD cycles,82 this does not seem to have been realized here since the band gap does not change.
Concerning the interface structure and morphology, our diffraction and microscopy data (ESI†) suggest a sharp interface that appears artificially broadened in the XPS data. This statement is based on the following facts: first, we observed that an interface is formed between an amorphous Al2O3 film and a polycrystalline ZnO layer (see the GIXRD data in the ESI, Fig. S2†); second, the ellipsometry map (ESI, Fig. S1†) and the XRR data (not shown) confirmed a higher roughness of the ZnO film and a lower roughness of the Al2O3 film; third, the SEM results showed an abrupt interface between Al2O3 and ZnO within the resolution of the method (ESI, Fig. S3†); and fourth, the polycrystalline ZnO film is conformally covered by the amorphous alumina film (ESI, Fig. S4†). Together, these effects give rise to a laterally varying chemical composition across the interface as evidenced by XPS.
Regarding the electronic structure and band alignment, the interface situation is found to be the same as for α-Ga2O3/ZnO,72 where, however, a different mechanism for interface formation was proposed. The interpretation of the authors of that work is that the epitaxial process promotes the out-diffusion of Zn from the ZnO substrate into the growing α-Ga2O3 layer. A solid-phase reaction at the interface also facilitates the formation of a ZnGa2O4 interfacial layer. A similar band-bending effect was also discussed for the Ga0.47Zn0.53O1.14/IGZO (IGZO: indium–gallium–zinc oxide) interface in terms of an interface charge model, where exchange reactions of Zn for Ga and Ga for Zn and their effect on doping and interface dipoles were the essential driving force.83
Our results differ from these and other preceding studies because of the presence of asymmetric Zn core levels clearly indicating reduced ZnO in the interface region, which was not observed in other works.36,72,73 Most likely, O is partially taken from ZnO to form alumina in the interface region as previously also reported for the ALD growth of alumina on ruthenium oxide84 and oxidized CH3NH3PbI3.85 This results in the formation of Zn-rich ZnO at the interface during the ALD growth. The rather high concentration of O–H groups (Fig. 3 and 8) indicates that these O vacancies are not fully healed in subsequent cycles.
From a more general perspective, our findings suggest that the method of forming interfaces solely by ALD in situ may indeed be useful in heterojunction engineering as the amount of metallic Zn, and thereby the electron concentration, could most probably be controlled by adjusting the ALD process parameters. Yet, as we have only investigated the Al2O3/ZnO pair so far, it is not clear at present whether the observed Zn accumulation is just a peculiarity of this particular combination or whether this concept may also be extended to other TCO interfaces, which makes further studies worthwhile.
IV. Summary and conclusions
An Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction produced solely by ALD in situ on a Si single crystal has been investigated by XPS and UPS. The chemical composition of the constituents was found to be close to the ideal stoichiometry, with negligible amounts of impurities like carbon but sizable contributions from hydroxyl groups to the CL spectra. The study yielded band gaps of 6.7 eV for the Al2O3 film and 3.3 eV for the ZnO layer, as well as a valence band offset of 1.1 eV and a conduction band offset of 2.3 eV for Al2O3 with respect to ZnO. Our results are within the error comparable to that of interfaces formed by the ALD growth of Al2O3 on ZnO (000) single crystals, i.e. the most chemical inert termination against ALD reactants such as TMA and ozone. It therefore shows that high-quality interfaces can also be achieved from amorphous/polycrystalline ALD-prepared films. These values differ, however, from previous studies where ZnO was evaporated on an Al2O3 single crystal (sapphire) with a VBO of 3.59 eV and a CBO of 2.04 eV, most probably owing to the larger band gap of around 9 eV for sapphire in comparison with the Al2O3 films (6.7 eV). Furthermore, elemental Zn, i.e., reduced ZnO, was detected in the interface region from the Zn 2p3/2 core level and the Zn L3MM Auger line.
As the Al metal is expected to partially break Zn–O bonds to facilitate its own oxidation at the interface, a picture emerges where the corresponding oxygen vacancies in the ZnO are doping ZnO with electrons, giving rise to the observed upward band bending in the interface region. This mechanism found in a purely ALD-prepared interface has not been described before and may present an alternative route toward tailoring the physical properties of the heterojunction by band-gap engineering as the ALD method promises a higher degree of control of the interface properties, especially of the band offsets. Accordingly, the selection of materials with different electronegativities and the intentional creation of a well-defined interface by suitably adjusting the ALD process parameters should enable the control of the band bending and, consequently, the device properties in relevant applications, e.g., as transparent emitter layers in solar cells and photodetectors.

 	Fig. 1  XPS survey spectra of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction obtained with Mg Kα radiation. The Al2O3 spectrum corresponds to 3 min sputtering, the interface spectrum to 24 min sputtering and the ZnO spectrum to 49 min sputtering. The Ar-related signals most likely originate from adventitious Ar implanted during sputtering.	 

 	Fig. 2  Elemental concentrations within the Al2O3/ZnO heterostructure depending on the sputtering depth as determined by XPS. The vertical dashed line marks the beginning of the interface region.	 

 	Fig. 3  Decomposition of the O 1s core level spectra of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction. The central component is assigned to oxygen–metal bonds, the left peak to hydroxyl groups, and the right component to excess oxygen (for ZnO bulk).	 

 	Fig. 4  Measurement of the band gap for the Al2O3 film by determining the onset of the electron energy loss in the O 1s core level region. Note that in the inset the BE axis has been reversed.	 

 	Fig. 5  CL spectra (Al 2p and Zn 2p3/2) and the VBM: (a) in Al2O3 and ZnO bulk layers, (b) in ZnO bulk, and (c) in Al2O3 bulk.

 	Fig. 6  Detailed energy band diagram of the Al2O3/ZnO type-I heterojunction.	 

 	Fig. 7  Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 core level line shapes after different sputter times. The scaling factors for the spectra for different sputter times of 12, 19, 21, 24, and 49 min applied are 80, 28.6, 22.9, 13.3, and 1.0, respectively. The emission at 1039 eV is most likely related to the Ar LMM Auger multiplet not affecting the analysis of the Zn 2p3/2 data.	 

 	Fig. 8  Peak decomposition of the Zn 2p3/2 CL of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction at the interface.	 

 	Fig. 9  Zn L3MM Auger spectra of the Al2O3/ZnO heterojunction at the interface and in the bulk of the ZnO layer.	 

 	Fig. 10  Dependence of core level binding energy and VBM position on sputter time. The core level binding energies have been shifted in energy to obtain a common mapping of band bending.
