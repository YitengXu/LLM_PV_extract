    , Accepted 3rd October 2016First published on 3rd October 2016AbstractTo overcome fatal shortcomings of organic phase change materials (PCMs), such as leakage during work, low thermal conductivity and shortage of multiple driving ways, we propose a novel strategy to synthesize structurally, mechanically, electrically and optically anisotropic graphene aerogels (AN-GAs) by using gaseous hydrogen chloride to in situ solidify ordered graphene oxide liquid crystals followed by chemical reduction, supercritical fluid drying and annealing in an Ar atmosphere in sequence. The confined pore space and aligned wall structure of the resulting AN-GAs have benefited crystallization of organic phase change molecules and thus highly efficient phase change composites (PCCs) are fabricated with long durability and good strength. The resulting PCCs can also be driven either by applying a small voltage (1–3 V) with high electro-heat efficiency (up to 85%) or by irradiating with weak sunlight (0.8–1.0 sun) with high photo-heat efficiency (up to 77%).
Introduction
Latent heat storage of phase change materials (PCMs) is considered as an extremely promising way to utilize thermal energy coming from the surrounding environment, solar irradiation, waste heat produced by vehicles and electronic products, etc.1,2 Multiple driven techniques are demanded for PCMs with fast-heating as well as slow-radiating characteristics to utilize latent heat in ever-increasing application fields.2–4 However, due to low thermal/electrical conductivity, pale color, and easy leaking in the melted state, neither electrical nor optical ways can be used to drive the organic PCMs.5 Recently, 3D conducting/light-absorbing porous networks, such as metal foams, carbon nanotube sponges and graphene aerogels, have been used to serve as hosts for organic PCMs to make phase change composites (PCCs),6–9 which gives the possibility to achieve latent heat storage driven either optically or electrically. However, all of these 3D porous networks were isotropic, which still significantly restricted the phase change performance of the resulting PCCs. In fact, electrically driven PCMs particularly need porous hosts with a higher conductivity along the fast heating direction, while optically driven PCMs particularly need porous hosts with a larger light-absorbing surface perpendicular to the light irradiation direction. All these urgent requirements have forced scientists to develop porous frameworks to serve as the PCM hosts with anisotropic electrical/optical properties.
Aerogels, an extremely important class of isotropic porous materials with extraordinary capillary force,10 have been ideal hosts for PCMs to prevent leaking during phase change transition.3,6,7,9,11–13 However, two critical issues should be overcome before aerogels can achieve practical applications in the multiple driven PCCs: (1) intrinsically low thermal conductivity of the aerogels themselves could not guarantee fast heating of the PCCs, and thus the aerogels with high thermal conductivity have to be developed, and (2) the intrinsically isotropic porous structure of the aerogels could not guarantee the best phase change performance of the resulting PCCs as mentioned above, and thus anisotropic aerogels have to be developed. Lately, Tsuguyuki Saito14 reported an anisotropic aerogel, for the first time, with a 3D ordered nanofiber skeleton prepared from a nanocellulose liquid crystal precursor; however the ordered aerogel still has heat-insulation and thus could not be applied in the field of latent heat storage. Recently, the discovery of graphene oxide liquid crystals (GO-LCs) and orientational ordering of graphene oxide sheets in aqueous dispersions have provided a great opportunity to design aligned porous architectures, such as films15 and fibers16,17 with excellent thermal, electric and mechanical properties.18–20 Nevertheless, the growth of ice and the absence of a sol–gel process have resulted in an inhomogeneous graphene framework.
To overcome fatal shortcomings of organic PCMs, such as leakage during work, low thermal conductivity and shortage of multiple driving ways, herein we have presented a novel strategy for the first time to synthesize structurally, mechanically, electrically and optically anisotropic graphene aerogels (AN-GAs) by using gaseous hydrogen chloride to in situ solidify ordered GO-LCs followed by chemical reduction, supercritical fluid drying and annealing in an Ar atmosphere in sequence, and then organic PCMs have been successfully filled into these AN-GAs to fabricate electron- and photo-driven PCCs with low drive, high efficiency and long durability. The aligned walls together with confined pores of the AN-GAs have directed preferential orientation of the organic PCMs with high crystallinity. The existence of the AN-GA frameworks can significantly enhance the mechanical strength of the PCMs regardless of direction (although there are differences in different directions). The work presented here, to the best of our knowledge, is the first report on anisotropic graphene aerogel-based multiple driven PCCs. Our work also gives much inspiration to design more anisotropic aerogels as hosts for multiple driven PCCs.
Experimental
Materials
Graphite powder (1 μm) was purchased from Qingdao Tianheda Graphite Co., Ltd, Qingdao, China. P2O5, K2S2O7, 30% H2O2, HCl (aq), HI and H2SO4 were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company. Paraffin and commercial PCC were obtained from Shanghai Joule wax Co., Ltd. Gaseous hydrogen chloride was obtained via the volatilization of hydrochloric acid (35–37 wt%).
Preparation of GO-LCs
Graphene oxide (GO) sheets were prepared from graphite powder by a modified Hummers method reported in our previous study.19 Liquid crystalline GO was prepared by centrifugation of the GO dispersion at high speed (10000 rpm) for about 3 h.
Preparation of the AN-GA
The resulting GO liquid crystal (∼25 mg mL−1) was loaded into a mould (plastic box) and was driven to have a long-range order via flowing (repeatedly tilting the plastic box containing the GO liquid crystal). The mould was aged in gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl (g)) for 6 h to obtain the GO hydrogel, after that the 10 wt% HI (serving as the reducing agent) solution (the volume of HI solution is the same as that of the GO-LC) was spread over the GO hydrogel and allowed to stand for 12 h at room temperature. Followed by washing at least 4 times with absolute ethyl alcohol to replace the water and the residual HI in the hydrogel network, supercritical drying with CO2 (40 °C, 10 MPa) for 12 h, and annealing at 600 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 3 h, the AN-GA was obtained.
Preparation of the AN-GA–paraffin composite
Both the AN-GA and paraffin were heated to 80 °C (above the melting point of paraffin, 48 °C) in a vacuum oven and were placed for 3 h for the AN-GA to infuse with paraffin. After the AN-GA was submerged in the melting paraffin, the system was allowed to cool until the paraffin was solidified, and then the excess paraffin adhered on the composite surface was removed with a knife. The paraffin loading in the composite was determined by measuring the weight difference of the AN-GA before and after infusion.
Electric-to-thermal energy conversion and storage
The cylinder-shaped samples (AN-GA and PCC) were connected to a regulated DC power supply (ATTEN, APS3005Dm) with two Cu wires, each wire was attached to the undersurface of the cylindrical sample with silver paste to ensure good electrical contact; silica coating was covered on the silver paste to insulate the heat in the axial direction. The temperature evolution of the sample was measured by using a thermocouple and recorded by using a data collection system using the same configuration.
Photo-to-thermal energy conversion and storage
The rectangular samples (AN-GA and PCC) were placed in a transparent and sealed plastic box, and then directly illuminated by simulated solar light from a tungsten–halogen lamp filtered by a IV cut-off filter (Eddmund Optics, 54047) and a daylight blue filter (HOYA LB120) using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The temperature evolution of the samples was measured and recorded with a thermometer (FLUKE, 54IIB).
Characterization
Raman spectra were recorded on a LabRAM HR Raman spectrometer with a 50 mW He–Ne laser operating at 632 nm with a CCD detector. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D8 Advanced spectrometer with a scanning rate of 0.05 s−1 over an angular range of 5–65° (2θ). The morphology of the samples was examined by SEM (Hitachi S-4800) with an acceleration voltage of 5–15 kV. The paraffin and the composite were coated with Au nano-powder under a current of 20 mA for 2 min. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) measurement was carried out on a Tecnai G2F20 S-Twin with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The pore size distribution and average pore diameter of the aerogels were analyzed by the BJH nitrogen adsorption and desorption method (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics, USA). The surface area of the aerogels was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, based on the amount of N2 adsorbed at pressures 0.05 < P/P0 < 0.3. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and DTG were carried out using a TG 209F1 Libra (NETZSCH) analyzer with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere. DSC analysis was performed on a DSC 200F3 NETZSCH with a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. Lateral thermal diffusivity was measured by using a Netzsch LFA 457 laser flash thermal diffusivity apparatus operating at room temperature. Thermal conductivity of the AN-GA and its composite was calculated from the equation λ = αρCP, where α is the thermal diffusivity, ρ is the density of the sample and CP is the heat capacity. The heat capacity of the AN-GA was measured by LFA; the heat capacities of the AN-GA–paraffin and pure paraffin were measured by DSC. The electric resistances of the aerogel and its composites were measured by using a CHIChief 600D electrochemical workstation, and the electric conductivity can be calculated by the equation: κ = IL/US where κ is the electric conductivity, I is the current which crosses the sample, U is the voltage applied in the sample, L is the length of sample the current goes through, and S is the cross area of current. The stress–strain curves were recorded by using an Instron 3365 tensile testing machine.
Results and discussion
Assembling the anisotropic graphene aerogels
The synthetic pathway of the AN-GA is shown in Scheme 1A. First of all, uniform GO-LCs with macroscopic and microscopic colorful textures (Fig. S1, ESI†) were obtained from the uniform GO suspension via high-speed centrifugation.21–23 According to Onsager's theory,19,24 the competition between orientational entropy and excluded volume entropy can promote the formation of stable liquid crystalline orders (Fig. S2†). When the GO-LC was aged in the presence of gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl (g)), the HCl (g) dissolved and diffused into the GO-LC slowly with immediate ionization, which restrained ionization of the carboxylic acid groups attached on GO sheets, and thus led to gradual formation of a dynamic hydrogen-bonding network due to the coupling effect. With the increase of hydrogen ions, the dynamic hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. S3†) was “in situ frozen” and the liquid crystal GO hydrogel with colorful texture (Fig. S4†) was obtained. After chemical reduction with HI, supercritical fluid drying with CO2 and annealing at 600 °C in an Ar atmosphere in sequence, the corresponding AN-GAs with different shapes and sizes as shown in Fig. 1a were obtained. The cutting section plane of the aerogel exhibited metallic shininess, indicating a high reduction degree and uniform macrostructure. Moreover, the anisotropic GO aerogels (AN-GOAs) with a uniform and smooth cutting section plane were also successfully obtained (Fig. S5†) by the supercritical CO2 drying of the LC-GO hydrogel, which indicated that the LC-GO hydrogel structure was stable. In addition, the AN-GOA can be transferred into the uniform GO solution just by mechanical agitation in deionized water (Fig. S6b†), which indicated that there was no other cross-linkers except hydrogen bonds.

The resulting AN-GAs as well as the AN-GOA were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption–desorption test and XRD. As shown in Fig. 1c and S7 and S8,† single- or few-layered graphene sheets exhibited a flat state with some straight wrinkles that evenly distributed over the whole sheets, reflecting the nature state of graphene sheets with some wrinkles in solution.25,26 All the edges of graphene sheets were clear and smooth, similar to graphene sheets in the liquid crystal which was observed by real-time confocal laser microscopy.19 Furthermore, we also observed from Fig. S7a† that two edges of the different GO sheets were half connected and half separated in parallel, which might attributed to the coupling effect of the carboxylic acid group.27 From nitrogen-sorption spectra, a steep increase in N2 uptake at low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.02) could be observed, (Fig. 2b and S9†), which suggested a microporous structure (0.35–0.7 nm) in the aerogel, and the ratio of micropore areas to total ones reached 9.6% (for the AN-GOA) and 12.7% (for the AN-GA), respectively (more details see Table S1 in the ESI†). We considered that the micropores derived from the nature wrinkle of the GO in solution with least partial overlapping. Moreover, the mesopores (∼4 nm) of the graphene-based aerogel with a type IV adsorption isotherm might be attributed to monolayer–multilayer adsorption. The XRD patterns of both the AN-GOA and AN-GA (Fig. 2c) have a sharp peak, further revealing the regular packing of graphene sheets with a longer correlation length in the anisotropic aerogel.15 Moreover, the decrease of interlayer spacing from 0.9 nm (2θ = 9.8°) of the AN-GOA to 0.35 nm (2θ = 25.4°) of the AN-GA indicates the elimination of functional groups in the reduction process.

The vapor diffusion method through HCl (g) to crosslink LC-GO promised the gelation without mechanical stirring, and thus allowed maintaining intrinsic ordering of liquid crystals in the resulting aerogel, which could be confirmed directly from the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) imaging. Along the axial direction (along the arrangements of graphene sheets and pore channels, Fig. 1b), the graphene sheets were piled up to form regular wrinkle-bands with aligned honeycomb-like pores (macropore diameter φ < 1 μm) and led to a folded zone (Fig. 1d–f and S10a–f†). Along the radial direction (normal to the arrangements of graphene sheets and pores, Fig. 1b), the aligned pore channels and the smooth pore walls were observed from the cross-section images (Fig. 1g–i and S10g–i†). All of these exhibited a totally different morphology compared to the common graphene aerogel (Fig. S11†). Furthermore, the SEM images also exhibited an open and tubular structure, and the cell walls were extremely thin with a translucent state, containing only single or few layers of graphene. The AN-GOA also showed a highly ordered lamellar structure with 3D ordered interconnected pores and walls (Fig. S6a†), which corresponded to orientational graphene nano-sheets of the GO-LCs.

Fig. 2a shows the Raman spectra of the anisotropic aerogel. The intensities of the G- and D-bands of the aerogel were 3–4 times higher in the axial direction than those in the radial direction. This meant that there was higher resonance in the axial direction, indicating an ordered alignment of graphene layers in the anisotropic aerogels.28–30 In addition, the increase of the intensity ratio of the D peak to G peak in the Raman spectra, from 0.99 of the AN-GOA to 1.42 of the AN-GA, suggested the recovery of the conjugated structure via the reduction process.
The anisotropic mechanical properties of the resulting aerogels were investigated as shown in Fig. 2e. For the axial direction, the curve could be divided into three linear regimes: the first (ε < 2%, Young's modulus E = 6.25 MPa) and the second (ε = 2–21%, E = 2.88 MPa) regimes were elastic deformation, and the third one was plastic deformation (ε > 21%, E = 0.41 MPa). The SEM image showed that compressing the aerogel in the axial direction resulted in conversion from initially flat pore-walls into a buckled fold (Fig. S12†), similar to the deformation of the aligned CNT array,31 which further reflected long-range uniform alignment of graphene in the axial direction. For the radial direction, the curve showed two regions, a linear elasticity region and a yield region as shown in Fig. S13,† similar to the regular graphene aerogel's behavior. In comparison with the axial direction (E = 6.25 MPa), the radial direction showed higher compressive modulus (E = 8.3 MPa) in the first linear elastic deformation, and both of them were higher than those of the graphene aerogels reported elsewhere.16,32 Based on SEM images of the AN-GA deformation under pressure in two directions, the deformation mechanisms were proposed as illustrated in Fig. S14.†
Thermal conductivity as a function of graphene orientation along two directions was described and is shown in Fig. 3a and b. Along the axial direction, the thermal conductivity (λ) of the AN-GA was as high as 1.71 ± 0.2 W m−1 K−1, about eight times higher than that in the radial direction (0.22 ± 0.05 W m−1 K−1), suggesting that the AN-GA was an excellent thermal conducting host for PCMs in comparison with a commercial SiO2 aerogel (0.018 W m−1 K−1)11 and nanocellulose/graphene oxide foam (0.021 W m−1 K−1).33 The λ value of the AN-GA in the axial direction was significantly above the value of the regular graphene aerogel (0.1 ± 0.01 W m−1 K−1)34 and comparable to that of the isotropic CVD-graphene foam (1.47 W m−1 K−1),6 which might be related to the thermal properties of graphene sheets and the aligned microstructure in the cell wall (Fig. 3a). The thermal conductivity in the radial direction was smaller and similar to that of the regular graphene aerogels, possibly due to the existence of air layers (0.01 W m−1 K−1) and more interface resistances between the wall and the air. The electric conductivity behaviors were also anisotropic. The electric conductivity could reach 341.3 S m−1 in the axial direction by a four-probe method, about 4–5 times higher than that of self-assembled graphene aerogels35 (∼87 S m−1), cross-linked graphene aerogels32 (∼1 × 102 S m−1) and emulsion-templated graphene aerogels34 (64 ± 2 S m−1), while the electric conductivity of our aerogel in the radial direction was ∼65–105 S m−1, comparable to that of the regular graphene aerogels reported elsewhere.32,34,35

Phase change composites based on the anisotropic graphene aerogel
Based on these results, the AN-GAs might be ideal hosts for PCMs with multiple means to drive latent heat storage. Thus, paraffin was used to fabricate a series of AN-GA derived PCCs (AN-GA–paraffin, see Scheme 1B). As shown in Fig. S15,† the well-maintained aligned graphene structure in the composite was unchanged after filling paraffin: the graphene sheets were wrapped by paraffin, and the massive crystals (induced lump-crystals of paraffin along aligned channel-like pores) also stood in the aligned pore channels, which was totally different from the crystal structure of the pure paraffin (Fig. S16†). According to the literature,36 the pores with a diameter of less than 13 μm should have enough capillary force to hold the PCM without leakage during phase transition. As the pore diameter of our aerogels was less than 1 μm, the AN-GA was therefore an effective host for fabricating PCCs without leakage during the phase change process. This could be demonstrated by heating AN-GA–paraffin and pure paraffin at ∼100 °C; as shown in Fig. S17,† the former remained stable without leakage, but the latter became fluidic. From compressive stress–strain curves as shown in Fig. 2f, the AN-GA–paraffin also exhibited excellent mechanical strength: the brittleness of the paraffin was reduced significantly in the presence of the AN-GA and the corresponding PCC was compressed with nearly fivefold strain in comparison with that of the commercial PCC.
The crystallization of paraffin and PCC was investigated by XRD. It is clearly shown in Fig. 2d that two sharp intensive diffraction peaks at 2θ = 21° and 24.2° were observed for the pure paraffin, which were attributed to the typical diffractions of (110) and (200) crystal planes of the monoclinic paraffin, respectively.37 However the intensity of the (110) in the AN-GA–paraffin composite (underwent 80 °C treatment during the filling process of the paraffin) enhanced significantly and that of the (200) decreased sharply, suggesting that preferential orientation of paraffin molecules with high crystallinity formed in the pore channel of the AN-GA. Furthermore, the 80 °C-treated paraffin possessed the same peaks but with significantly decreased intensities, indicating that the secondary crystallization of the paraffin was limited in the absence of ordered confined space.
Thermal stability of paraffin in the AN-GA was measured by TGA as shown in Fig. 3b and S18.† The degradation step occurring at temperature between 200 and 450 °C belonged to the thermal degradation of paraffin, and the remaining could be attributed to the AN-GA framework. This is because the AN-GA had a very high degradation temperature (Fig. S19†). The paraffin loading percentage in AN-GA–paraffin was up to 94% as calculated from the TGA result, which was comparable to the maximum loading amount reported recently (>90%)13 and much higher than that of the commercial PCCs (77%).
Phase change behavior was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as shown in Fig. 3d. The pristine paraffin melting curve showed an onset at 49.3 °C with a peak position at 58.2 °C. The DSC curve of the AN-GA–paraffin showed a lower melting onset (47.8 °C) and a similar solidification point of 46.05 °C. In addition, incorporation of a graphene network resulted in delayed peak temperatures of the heating and cooling of paraffin, which shifted from 54.4 °C and 40.75 °C, to 64.7 °C and 29.7 °C, respectively. For the pristine paraffin, the melting enthalpy (ΔHm = 207 J g−1) was higher than the freezing enthalpy (ΔHf = 192 J g−1) in the first cycle (1st) as shown in Fig. 3e, mainly due to the change of the crystal structure, but in the second cycle (2nd), the melting enthalpy (ΔHf = 190.2 J g−1) became lower than the freezing enthalpy (ΔHf = 193 J g−1), which was similar to that of most of the PCMs.13 The phase enthalpy of AN-GA–paraffin (ΔHm = 193.7 J g−1 and ΔHf = 198.2 J g−1) exhibited only a partial loss (∼6.4%) in comparison with paraffin (1st), nearly corresponding to the graphene loading percentage as calculated from the TG curve, but higher than that of the pure paraffin (2nd). Taking XRD analysis aforementioned into consideration, we could further confirm that the paraffin in the AN-GA possessed a higher crystalline degree. In addition, the 45 cyclic DSC curves of the AN-GA–paraffin were virtually identical as shown in Fig. 3f, which indicated the excellent cyclic stability of the composites. In comparison with the cyclic DSC curves of the pure paraffin and the commercial PCC (Fig. S20†), we could find that the AN-GA skeleton was not disrupted and the crystal structure of paraffin was well maintained during the cyclic solid–liquid transition process.
Since air in the AN-GA was replaced by paraffin (0.21 W m−1 K−1), with a paraffin loading of ∼94%, the thermal conductivity of the AN-GA–paraffin significantly increased up to 2.99 W m−1 K−1 in the axial direction as shown in Fig. 3b, which represented a nearly 15-fold increase in comparison with that of pure paraffin, and higher than that of the aligned CNT–n-eicosane (90 wt%) composite.9 The thermal conductivity of AN-GA–paraffin in the radial direction could reach ∼1.2 W m−1 K−1. The thermal conductivity difference between the axial and the radial directions was reduced to nearly three times as the air was replaced with the paraffin. Similarly, the alignment of graphene sheets in the composite also gave it a high electric conductivity in the axial direction and a large electric conductivity difference (axial/radial reached to ∼5) along different directions. To further study electrical properties, we measured the electric resistance of the AN-GA and AN-GA–paraffin in the axial direction by a current–voltage (I–V) test as shown in Fig. S21,† and the result indicated that the electrical resistance increased slightly after introduction of paraffin into the AN-GA, from 1.06 Ω of the aerogel to 1.22 Ω of the composite. The corresponding electric conductivities were 297 S m−1 and 258.7 S m−1, respectively, indicating that a slight structural deformation had occurred for the AN-GA being filled with paraffin. The resistance of a PCC with 94% paraffin content still approached that of a pure graphene aerogel, indicating that the paraffin introduction had played a negligible role in disturbing the original graphene network.
Electric-to-thermal energy conversion and storage
For an AN-GA placed at room temperature, applying a constant voltage of 0.5 to 3 V (electric circuit showed in Fig. 4a) caused an abrupt increase in sample temperature during the initial 60 s and reached an equilibrium state where heat dissipation from the AN-GA to the environment balanced input energy (Fig. 4b). Correspondingly, a larger voltage resulted in a higher equilibrium temperature. When the applied voltage was withdrawn, the sample temperature dropped sharply close to the environmental temperature. All these observations indicated that the AN-GA possessed a fast-response electro-thermal effect. When a similar voltage (1.0–3.0 V) was applied to the AN-GA–paraffin composite as shown in Fig. 4c, the temperature increased rapidly in the initial stage, until a plateau with a minimum slope that corresponded to start and termination of the paraffin phase change process was reached. After phase change finished, the composite temperature increased rapidly again until reaching the equilibrium state. When a lower applied voltage (e.g. 0.5 V) was applied, there was no inflection point in the temperature curve, indicating that the paraffin in the composite had not melted during this period. Thus a critical voltage for a complete phase change was about 1.0 V, which was a quite low critical triggering voltage. Under higher voltage, the melting process became more shortened; therefore heat loss from the heated composite (exposed to air) to the environment was reduced and thus resulted in an enhanced efficiency. The electro-to heat storage efficiency is about 50.5% under 1.5 V and 85.4% under 3.0 V as shown in Table S2,† exhibiting much better performance in electric-to-heat conversion in comparison with CNT sponge3 (40.6% under 1.5 V), anisotropic carbon nanotube array9 (38.9% under 1.7 V) and carbon aerogel7 (71.4% under 15 V). After withdrawing the applied voltages, all the curves immediately dropped to the freezing point of paraffin (∼48 °C), and the second plateau appeared in each curve, which was associated with the solidifying process of the PCM. The ratio of the plateau length of the solidifying process to the melting one was bigger under higher voltage, about 3 times under 1.5 V and 25 times under 3.0 V, suggesting that the thermal energy could be generated in a very short time and released very slowly for a long time. This indicated that AN-GA–paraffin was an excellent electron-driven latent heat storage composite in comparison with an aligned CNTA–n-eicosane composite.9

Photo-to-thermal energy conversion and storage
The AN-GA–paraffin could be considered as an excellent photo-capturer due to the following reasons: (1) the absorption of individual graphene layers was ∼2.3% of the white light,38 (2) large thermal interface between graphene sheets and paraffin molecules, and (3) the graphene–paraffin–graphene sandwich junction structure might act as a microcavity, which could enhance the light absorption.39–41 Consequently, a rectangular AN-GA–paraffin sample could adsorb sunlight vertically (radial direction) through the graphene basic plane (the wall of the aerogel pore) and a corresponding device for photo-to-heat energy conversion is illustrated in Fig. 4d. The sample was placed under simulated solar illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) with controlled intensities of 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0 sun, respectively. During the light radiation, the temperature of the AN-GA abruptly increased and reached a stable state with a equilibrium temperature (∼70 °C under 1.0 sun and ∼60 °C under 0.9 sun), as shown in Fig. 4e, suggesting that the AN-GA could be used as an ideal photo-capturer for solar–thermal-conversion of phase change composites. When the incident light was switched off, the temperature was quickly dropped with a manner similar to the withdrawal of voltage as shown in Fig. 4b. When an AN-GA–paraffin composite (∼92% loading of paraffin, 1.4 × 1.7 cm2) was exposed to light, phase change occurred at temperature close to 48 °C under light intensities of 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 sun, as could be seen from the plateau in each curve; no phase change was observed under 0.7 sun (Fig. 4f). Similarly, the heat release from the composite could be observed after turning off the light. The photo-to-thermal conversion efficiency was about 77% as calculated from stored-energy divided by the irradiating energy received by the sample over the working time (Table S3†). This indicated that the resulting AN-GA–paraffin was an excellent photo-driven latent heat storage composite in comparison with the literature reported elsewhere.42,43
Conclusion
In conclusion, 3D porous graphene aerogels with a highly anisotropic network originating from GO-LCs were prepared via combination of vapor diffusion and a sol–gel method followed by supercritical CO2 drying and thermal annealing in sequence. The resulting aerogels showed high thermal conductivity (1.71 ± 0.2 W m−1 K−1) and high electricity conductivity (341.3 S m−1) with outstanding anisotropy (∼8 times difference in thermal conductivity and 3–5 times difference in electrical conductivity investigated from two orthogonal directions). We have found that the confined pore space and aligned wall structure of the resulting AN-GAs benefited crystallization of the organic phase change molecules and thus highly efficient PCCs were fabricated with long durability and good strength. What's more, the resulting PCCs could be driven either by applying a small voltage (1–3 V) with high electro-heat efficiency (up to 85%) or by irradiating with weak sunlight (0.8–1.0 sun) with high photo-heat efficiency (up to 77%). Our work might offer a possibility to develop next-generation energy systems with smart performance for electric devices, solar energy utilization, thermal management, etc.
