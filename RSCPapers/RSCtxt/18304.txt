    , Accepted 8th June 2018First published on 11th June 2018AbstractOne challenge facing the development of high-performance cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is the fast degradation rate of cathodes due to poisoning by contaminants commonly encountered in ambient air such as CO2. Here we report a double perovskite PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+δ (PBCC) cathode with excellent ORR activity and remarkable CO2 tolerance under realistic operation conditions. When tested in a symmetrical cell in air with ∼1 vol% CO2 at 750 °C, the PBCC electrode shows an area specific resistance of ∼0.024 Ω cm2, which increases to 0.028 Ω cm2 after 1000 h operation. The degradation rate is ∼1/24 of that of the state-of-the-art La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) cathode under the same conditions. Impedance spectroscopy and in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy analyses indicate that the surface of the PBCC electrode is much more active for oxygen exchange and more robust against CO2 than that of LSCF, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The fast ORR kinetics and excellent durability of PBCC in air with CO2 highlight the potential of PBCC as a highly promising material for devices involving oxygen electrochemistry such as solid oxide fuel cells, electrolysis cells, or gas separation membranes.

Broader context
Perovskite materials with excellent ionic and electronic conductivity have been extensively studied as electrodes for efficient energy conversion and storage. They are ideally suited for electrochemical applications that involve oxygen electrochemistry such as fuel cells and membrane reactors. To make them economically competitive and commercially viable, however, several material challenges must be overcome. One of them is to significantly enhance the durability against contaminants in ambient air while maintaining high electro-catalytic activity under operating conditions. Here we report the rational design of a high-performance electrode with excellent durability when exposed to ambient air containing ∼1% CO2. Further, the concept and the materials developed may be applicable to other chemical and energy transformation processes, including metal–air batteries, electrolyzers, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.

Introduction
Regenerative solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have potential to be the most attractive option for efficient energy storage and conversion; they can also serve as an economic bridge for transition from the fossil-fuel to the hydrogen-fuel economy because of the excellent fuel flexibility.1,2 However, the cathodes of SOFCs still contribute the most to degradation in performance and efficiency loss in the existing systems.3,4 One technical opportunity is to dramatically enhance the durability of the cathode while maintaining high electro-catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in order to reduce the cost and prolong the operational lifetime.5–8
LaxSr1−xCoyFe1−yO3−δ (LSCF)-based perovskite materials have been extensively investigated as electrodes for high-temperature electrochemical devices due to their excellent ionic and electronic conductivity and good ORR activity in the temperature range 600–800 °C.9 One shortcoming of an LSCF electrode is that its ORR activity is likely limited by the sluggish surface exchange process rather than the bulk charge transport process.10,11 Another technical barrier for an LSCF electrode is its poor durability due to Sr enrichment or segregation to the surface,6,12 caused by electrostatic attraction of the positively charged oxygen vacancies enriched at the surface.13 The Sr-enrichment may induce the formation of secondary phases such as SrCO3, Sr(OH)2, or SrCrO4, which are detrimental to the surface electro-catalytic activity for the ORR, leading to continuous degradation in electrode performance.14–16
Accordingly, extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of new cathode structures and materials with enhanced ORR activity,17–19 improved surface stability13,20 and good tolerance against contaminant poisoning.21 For instance, Jiang et al. demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of enhancing Cr-poisoning tolerance by surface modification of the cathode with a coating of a simple oxide like BaO or a mixture of two phases such as yttria stabilizied zirconia (YSZ) and doped ceria.22–24 Recently, Liu et al. developed a unique surface modification of an LSCF cathode by deposition of conformal coatings via one-step infiltration; the coatings can suppress surface Sr segregation, thus further enhancing the durability or tolerance to contaminant poisoning.12,16,25 Recently, a cathode with high tolerance to air with 10% CO2 has been reported;26 a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical CO2-protective shell was deposited on a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF) cathode through infiltration followed by microwave plasma treatment. The hierarchical shell consisted of a dense thin-film substrate with cones on the top of the substrate. A single cell with this cathode demonstrated a power density of ∼0.7 W cm−2 at a cell voltage of 0.7 V at 700 °C in air with 10% CO2 (within 1 h). However, the cells were tested in a CO2-containing atmosphere for only 1 h. Long-term stability is vital to practical applications since SOFCs are supposed to run for thousands of hours. Also, it is noted that the cathode fabrication process is relatively complex to obtain the desired structure: multistep solution infiltration, firing, and microwave plasma treatment, which might not be applicable for large scale SOFCs.
While surface modification is effective, it is critical to develop cathode materials that are inherently tolerant to degradation or contaminant poisoning. For example, Sr-free cathode materials have been extensively studied. Perovskite, Aurivillius oxide based cathodes (Bi2Sr2Nb2MnO12−d),27 or Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskite-like materials (such as La(Ni,Fe)O3−δ, Nd2NiO4 and Pr2NiO4) were thus proposed and studied as candidate cathode materials for SOFCs.28,29 For instance, a new cathode composed of Ag, Sm0.2Ce0.8O2, and Bi2Sr2Nb2MnO12−d was developed,27 demonstrating good stability in air containing 10% CO2 in symmetrical cells at 700 °C for only 5 h. However, the single cell performance in air with CO2 was not shown, and there was no data on the long-term stability of the cells in air containing CO2. To date, unfortunately, none of these new cathode materials have sufficient durability under realistic operating conditions. In addition, the mechanism of CO2 tolerance is still unknown; mechanistic understanding is vital to achieving rational design of new materials and electrode structures tolerant to CO2 poisoning.
Here we report a layered double perovskite material PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+δ (PBCC), demonstrating high ORR activity and excellent durability in air containing CO2 under typical SOFC operation conditions. An anode-supported single cell with the PBCC cathode achieved a power density of ∼0.7 W cm−2 at 700 °C under a cell voltage of 0.7 V for ∼220 h when simulated air with ∼1% CO2 was used as an oxidant and humidified H2 (∼3% H2O) as a fuel. Careful characterization and analyses indicate that the surface of the PBCC electrode is much more active for the ORR and robust against CO2 than that of LSCF, suggesting that PBCC is a highly promising cathode material for low-cost, high-performance, and durable SOFCs. The mechanism of the remarkable CO2 tolerance of PBCC under realistic operation conditions has been unravelled using in situ SERS, impedance spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, providing information vital to achieving rational design of more efficient and durable cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells.
Results and discussion
Structure of PBCC
Shown in Fig. 1a is a schematic view of the crystal structure of PBCC as confirmed by XRD refinement (Fig. 1b), with a stacking sequence of Ba(Ca)O/CoOx/PrOx/CoOx/Ba(Ca)O. Shown in Fig. 1c is a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image of a PBCC grain, recorded with the electron beam along the [100] direction. The inset is the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern. The observation of the superlattice spots (due to the difference in the atomic number of ordered A-site cations) in the FFT patterns (insets) confirms the double perovskite structure of PBCC with Pr and Ba(Ca) cations ordered in alternating layers along the c axis, i.e., with a stacking sequence of [Ba(Ca)O]–[CoO2]–[PrO]–[CoO2]–[Ba(Ca)O]. Moreover, the layered structure can be observed clearly through the line scan (brightness) along the red line in Fig. 1c. The intensity difference shown in Fig. 1d clearly confirmed the layered structure. The distance between PrO or BaO planes is about 0.76 nm, consistent with XRD analysis. Such a layered structure is vital to rapid transport of oxygen vacancies and fast surface exchange of oxygen.30–34 For instance, the PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBCO)-based material offered faster oxygen ion diffusion and surface-exchange kinetics than LSCF.35 Dissociated oxygen species may diffuse through the pore channels within the PBCC bulk phase, as depicted earlier.32 Ca doping at the A site can suppress surface segregation of A-site cations, resulting in better long-term stability of the cathode.13,30

Electrochemical performance of PBCC in air
Shown in Fig. 2a are some typical electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the PBCC cathode determined using symmetrical cells with a configuration of PBCC|SDC|PBCC in ambient air at 600–750 °C. The interfacial polarization resistance (Rp) of PBCC is much lower than that of the LSCF cathode. For instance, Rp of PBCC in air at 750 °C is ∼0.024 Ω cm2, about 1/5 of that of LSCF (0.13 Ω cm2) under the same conditions.3 The PBCC electrode shows much faster surface exchange kinetics and a higher bulk diffusion coefficient than LSCF (Fig. S1, ESI†). The performance of the PBCC cathode reported here (Fig. 2b) is comparable to that of the best cathodes with reasonable stability reported recently, including Bi2Sr2Nb2MnO12−δ (BSNM),27 PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ (PBSC)36 or BSCF-Gd0.1Ce0.9O2−δ (GDC) nanofibers or mixture.37

Rp of some high performing cathodes such as BSNM,27 PBSC,36 and BSCF-GDC powder and nanofibers37 were also added for comparison. PBCC shows a lower activation energy (1.13 eV) than LSCF (1.48 eV), indicating a lower energy barrier for reaction; EIS (c) and distribution of relaxation time (DRT) (d) of PBCC as a function of oxygen partial pressure; (e) dependence of each Rp as a function of pO2. 
We have further investigated the kinetics of the PBCC cathode by measuring the impedance spectra at different oxygen partial pressure (pO2) as shown in Fig. 2c. The spectra were analyzed using distribution of relaxation time (DRT), a powerful tool for deconvoluting complex impedance data in order to separate or isolate some key steps involved in the electrode reactions.38 The characteristic frequency of a process is inversely proportional to the relaxation time of the electrode process. Thus, the lower the characteristic frequency, the longer the characteristic relaxation time of the electrode process. Thus, a down-shifting of the characteristic frequency for a specific process when the electrode is exposed to a contaminant (e.g., CO2) may indicate degradation in the kinetics of the electrode process (e.g., surface reaction) due to contaminant poisoning. Shown in Fig. 2d are the DRT plots of PBCC at different oxygen partial pressures (pO2). Each plot has a set of three distinct peaks; denoted as low frequency (LF), intermediate frequency (IF), and high frequency (HF), corresponding to at least three distinct electrochemical processes. The integral area under each peak represents the resistance of the process.39 The general dependence of Rp on pO2 can be approximated by the equation Rp = k(pO2)−n.
Shown in Fig. 2e is the dependence of each Rp on the oxygen partial pressure. The number adjacent to each line is the n value for each process. n = 1.07 for the peak at LF indicates that the LF peak corresponds to the impedance to mass transfer;40 while n = 0.46 for the IF peak indicates that the IF peak is likely associated with the dissociation of O2 to 2Oads.41–43 The insensitivity of the HF peaks has little dependence on pO2 (n = 0.01), suggesting that the high-frequency process is likely associated with O2− transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface.44 The individual steps of the ORR process involved here may have different sensitivity to contaminants such as CO2. Thus, analysis of impedance spectra using DRT may help us to gain more insights into the degradation mechanism, as to be elaborated below.
Durability of PBCC in air with CO2
In addition to high electro-catalytic activity for the ORR, excellent durability of the SOFC cathode is vital to commercialization of SOFC technology, especially when exposed to contaminants commonly encountered in ambient air such as CO2. Shown in Fig. 3a is the summary of the durability of PBCC and LSCF cathodes in air with different concentrations of CO2. The insets are the electrochemical impedance spectra of the PBCC electrodes determined using a symmetrical cell immersed in air with different concentrations of CO2 as a function of testing time. Clearly, the impedance of the LSCF electrode increased significantly with time in air containing CO2; the degree of degradation increased with the concentration of CO2. In contrast, the impedance of the PBCC electrode displayed much better stability under the same testing conditions. For example, the impedance of the PBCC electrode remained relatively constant when the concentration of CO2 was about 1%, consistent with the XRD analyses (Fig. S2, ESI†). When the concentration of CO2 was increased to 5% and 10%, the PBCC electrode did degrade, but at a much slower deterioration rate than the LSCF electrodes.

Insets are the EIS of PBCC in different concentrations of CO2: 10% (top), 5% (middle) and 1% (bottom); and (b) DRT plots of PBCC cathodes at different testing times under OCV conditions in air with different concentrations of CO2 (10 vol%, 5 vol% and 1 vol%). 
In order to gain some insight into the detailed electrochemical process evolution (as a function of operation time) of the PBCC electrode in air with CO2, we have also analyzed the impedance spectra using DRT (Fig. 3b). Similar to earlier analysis, it appears that at least three processes (dispersed in the frequency domain) contributed to the electrode impedance; they occurred at LF (mass transfer near the interface), IF (surface exchange processes), and HF (charge transfer). It seems that the characteristic frequency of the IF peaks shifted to lower frequencies when the PBCC electrode was exposed to air containing high concentrations of CO2 (5% or 10%), and the corresponding integral resistance increased continuously with time. Both changes suggest that high concentration CO2 may deactivate the surface exchange process (IF), but has little effect on the other two processes at LF and HF. However, when the CO2 concentration is 1%, the characteristic frequency and the resistance of the surface exchange process (IF) remained relatively constant, an indication of robust surface properties of PBCC against poisoning of up to ∼1% CO2.
Electrochemical performance of the PBCC cathode in single cells
To demonstrate the high ORR activity and excellent CO2-tolerance of the PBCC cathode in an actual fuel cell, we constructed a single cell using Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3 (BZCYYb) as the anode support (∼700 μm thick), a SDC electrolyte (∼30 μm thick), and the PBCC cathode (∼20 μm thick). Cross-sectional views of the cell components are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The test cells were evaluated in a homemade setup (Fig. S3, ESI†), where simulated air with different concentrations of contaminants can be readily controlled. Shown in Fig. 4c and d are some typical IVP curves and electrochemical impedance spectra of the single cells tested at 600–750 °C when humidified H2 (with ∼3% H2O) was used as a fuel and air as an oxidant. At 700 °C, a peak power density of ∼0.949 W cm−2 was achieved, which is higher than that of the single cells with an LSCF cathode (0.76 W cm−2)45 and comparable to the best performance ever reported (see Table 1),46 demonstrating the remarkable electro-catalytic activity of the PBCC cathode under realistic operating conditions (ROC). It is noted that the OCVs of our cells are higher than those of the cells using a ceria-based electrolyte reported by others,5 due largely to the formation of an electron-blocking layer on the surface of the SDC electrolyte during co-firing of the electrolyte and Ni-BZCYYb anode at high temperatures.45,47 Shown in Fig. 4e is the long-term stability of the cell at a cell voltage of 0.7 V at 700 °C using humidified H2 (with ∼3% H2O) as a fuel and dry air or air with ∼1% CO2 as an oxidant. The flow rate of the oxidant was controlled at 100 sccm. After the cell was operated for ∼50 h (black line), the oxidant was switched from clean air to air containing ∼1% CO2 (red line). As seen, the performance of the cell with the PBCC cathode showed stable power output, demonstrating excellent CO2 tolerance, which is consistent with our symmetrical cell measurements. It is well accepted that long-term stability is vital to practical applications since SOFCs are supposed to run for thousands of hours. Although some cathodes have been reported to have good tolerance to CO2 poisoning in symmetrical cells,26,27 the lack of long-term durability (over hundreds of hours of operation) of single cells may indicate that more development of the cathodes is still needed for real application. Also, it is noted that the fabrication process and the composition of cathodes are relatively complex to obtain the desired structure: multi-step solution infiltration, firing, and microwave plasma treatment.26 In our case, the cathode is fabricated by a solution combustion method, which is simple and widely used by others.48

Understanding of the excellent CO2-tolerance of PBCC
In order to gain deeper understanding of the robust surface properties of PBCC, we have fabricated dense PBCC thin films via pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and investigated the surface evolution as a function of exposure time to a gas mixture with 10% CO2 and 90% O2 using in situ Raman spectroscopy, which is a powerful tool for probing chemical and physical properties of electrode materials. By simultaneously performing electrochemical and Raman measurements, the chemical and structural evolution of electrode materials under practical operating conditions can be acquired as a function of external stimuli (e.g., current, voltage, partial pressure of CO2). However, the low signal intensity of Raman spectroscopy makes it difficult to detect the surface species present in trace amounts or to track the formation of surface species with short lifetimes. This problem becomes more severe when studying SOFCs materials under realistic operating conditions (ROC) because many ceramic phases possess weak Raman modes and all Raman peaks broaden at high temperatures. Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a promising solution to this problem. In addition, a model cell with a high quality thin-film working electrode was used for this fundamental micro-spectroscopic study since a well-controlled electrode geometry can rule out the uncertainties caused by variations in morphology. Schematically shown in Fig. 5a is the experimental set-up and the model electrode configuration for our in situ SERS measurements. Either a LSCF or PBCC thin-film electrode was deposited on a single crystal YSZ substrate using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique.3 Dense and flat PLD films (Fig. S4, ESI†) are expected to provide more reliable information on surface properties by excluding the uncertainties associated with morphology and crystal orientation. An SDC thin film buffer layer was applied to avoid possible reaction between the electrode and the YSZ electrolyte. The structure of LSCF or PBCC was probed as a function of time exposed to an atmosphere of pure O2 or O2 with 10% CO2 at 500 °C. The two samples were exposed to pure O2 at 500 °C before exposure to CO2. As shown in Fig. 5b, the Raman spectra of the LSCF film are featureless in pure O2, while the peaks of carbonates at ∼1060 cm−1 increased drastically after switching the gas from pure O2 to O2 with 10% CO2. However, the carbonate peaks in the Raman spectra of the PBCC sample were not observable, indicating that PBCC is inactive for the carbonate formation under the Raman measurement conditions even when the concentration of CO2 is as high as 10%. Shown in Fig. 5c are the SEM images of the LSCF and the PBCC thin films before and after exposure to 10% CO2 (taken from the Raman chamber). While the LSCF thin film became much rougher after exposure to CO2, the PBCC thin film remained almost unchanged. Fig. 5d is the variation in intensity of the carbonate peeks obtained from thin films of LSCF or PBCC at 500 °C as a function of time. It demonstrates that the PBCC electrode material is not affected by the exposure to CO2. We also prepared dense pellets of PBCC and LSCF using a traditional high-temperature sintering process and performed in situ SERS measurements under identical conditions. It is clearly shown that the trend of the Raman spectra evolution of the PBCC pellets is similar to that of the PLD PBCC thin films (Fig. S5, ESI†). These results clearly confirm that the PBCC surface is much more robust against CO2 than the LSCF surface, consistent with the XRD analysis and the electrochemical measurements of the PBCC electrode discussed earlier.

To gain more insight into carbonate formation on the LSCF and PBCC surfaces at the molecular level, we perform DFT calculations. Due to various metal-oxide terminations, we first performed a thermodynamic analysis by calculating the heats of reaction with available heat of formation data in the literature as compiled in Table S1 (ESI†). It shows that carbonate formation can more easily occur from Co and Fe ions (631.5–665.6 kJ mol−1) rather than Ca, Ba, or Sr ions (941.7–1028.6 kJ mol−1). However, these results could not explain the growth of the carbonate peak observed in SERS at ∼1060 cm−1. Accordingly, DFT calculations were carried out to precisely explain why PBCC is inactive for carbonate formation. In this study, the (010) surfaces were used as we applied the (010) plane of double-layered perovskite structures in which pore channels could be formed to enhance the bulk diffusion.3,53 Based on the bulk structures of LSCF and PBCC illustrated in Fig. S6 (ESI†), we calculated CO2 adsorption energies on the LSCF and PBCC surfaces. For these initial calculations, we considered the CoO-terminated PBCC surface and LaSrO- and CoFeO-terminated LSCF surfaces as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Surface energy calculations of LaSrO- and CoFeO-terminated LSCF shows that they are indistinguishable (−1.03 and −1.06 J m−2, respectively). Thus, we examined CO2 adsorption on the two terminations of LSCF. The side views of CO2 adsorption on the surfaces are illustrated in Fig. 6. As compiled in Table S2 (ESI†), the adsorption energy calculations show that PBCC has much weaker adsorption of CO2 than LSCF (−0.73 eV versus −1.25 eV, respectively). In addition to the adsorption energy comparison, we examined the geometrical change in more detail, as shown in Fig. 6. Only LaSrO-terminated LSCF(010) has complete carbonate formation, while other adsorptions on CoFeO-terminated LSCF and CoO-terminated PBCC surfaces are molecular CO2 adsorption. In addition, it was found that the oxygen vacancy affects the CO2 adsorption energy on LaSrO-terminated LSCF(010), leading to more complete carbonate formation. It increases the adsorption energy from −1.25 eV to −2.23 eV. On the basis of the surface calculations, we carried out further simulations to understand the growth of the characteristic Raman peak at ∼1060 cm−1 as a function of CO2 treatment time, as shown in Fig. 5. For this examination, the DMol3 module implemented in the Materials Studio package was applied. LaSrO-terminated LSCF(010) was chosen for the single-point energy calculations. As illustrated in Fig. S8 (ESI†), two surface coverages of CO2 adsorption (i.e., CO2 = 2 and 4), resulting in Raman activities of 0.13 and 0.51 A4 amu−1, formed at ∼1064 cm−1 and ∼1,056 cm−1, respectively. These characteristic Raman peaks were scaled by a factor of 0.8497 which was obtained by comparing the experimental characteristic Raman peak of bulk SrCO354 and the predicted value in this study (1069 cm−1versus 1210 cm−1, respectively). This result clearly supports the growth of the carbonate's Raman characteristic peak at ∼1060 cm−1. Since it is well known that the dopant Sr ions from LSCF are segregated to the surface rather than La ions, we simulated two layers of CO32− formation on LaSrO-terminated LSCF(010) (see Fig. 6e and Fig. S9, ESI†), resulting in the Raman activity 0.33 A4 amu−1 at ∼1062 cm−1. For this calculation, the La ions on the top-most layer were replaced by Sr ions. In summary, the growth of our SERS data at ∼1060 cm−1 results from carbonate formation by the strong interaction of CO2 and Sr ions segregated from the LSCF cathode materials, while PBCC is effectively designed to be CO2-tolerant under fuel cell conditions.

Conclusion
In summary, a layered double perovskite PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+δ (PBCC) cathode, with excellent ORR activity and CO2 tolerance, has been fabricated and evaluated in both symmetrical and single cell configurations under realistic operating conditions. The PBCC cathode exhibited high catalytic activity for the ORR with area specific resistance as low as 0.024 Ω cm2 at 750 °C. The analyses of electrochemical impedance spectra as well as in situ SERS indicated that the surface of PBCC is much more active for oxygen exchange but robust against CO2 poisoning than that of LSCF. The PBCC-based materials may also be applicable to other chemical and energy treasformation systems that involve oxygen electrochemistry, including electrolysis of CO2, gas sensors, oxygen pumps, oxygen separation, and membrane reactors.

Broader context
Perovskite materials with excellent ionic and electronic conductivity have been extensively studied as electrodes for efficient energy conversion and storage. They are ideally suited for electrochemical applications that involve oxygen electrochemistry such as fuel cells and membrane reactors. To make them economically competitive and commercially viable, however, several material challenges must be overcome. One of them is to significantly enhance the durability against contaminants in ambient air while maintaining high electro-catalytic activity under operating conditions. Here we report the rational design of a high-performance electrode with excellent durability when exposed to ambient air containing ∼1% CO2. Further, the concept and the materials developed may be applicable to other chemical and energy transformation processes, including metal–air batteries, electrolyzers, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.
