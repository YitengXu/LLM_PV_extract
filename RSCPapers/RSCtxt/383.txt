    , Accepted 1st December 2018First published on 4th December 2018AbstractThere is great interest in extending cellulosic platforms to applications in flexible, lightweight, low-cost and sustainable electronics. The critical need is the development of methods to confer electronic properties to these materials platforms (i.e., paper and fabrics). Here we report a highly conductive, pliable and foldable Cu/cellulose paper electrode enabled by a simple low-cost and scalable wet-processing method to coat a Cu nanoparticle (NP) layer on common cellulose paper, where polydopamine adhesion and electroless deposition were used to yield highly conductive paper with a sheet resistance as low as 0.01 Ω sq−1. This Cu/cellulose paper has excellent stability because of the strong adhesion between Cu NPs and cellulose, and because the methods are sufficiently mild to prevent damage to the paper substrate. This fabrication method results in the controlled deposition of Cu NPs and yields Cu/cellulose paper with highly hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and excellent electromagnetic interface (EMI) shielding effectiveness. This high-performance Cu/cellulose paper could have promising application potential for a range of emerging applications in flexible electronics and packaging.
Introduction
There are exciting opportunities for flexible electronics for applications that include sensors, actuators, batteries, displays, circuits, solar cells, electronic skin, and implantable medical devices; yet these emerging applications will require electronic materials with high conductivities and pliabilities. Plastic materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethersulfone (PES),1 and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)2 have emerged as the first-generation of substrate materials for a wide range of flexible electronics and have greatly advanced the development of this area. However, there are still some limitations to plastic substrates. For example, most plastics have a high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), which would induce large shape changes during thermal processing. More importantly, the non-renewability, low biocompatibility and potential toxicity of plastic materials are affecting their applications in bio-related fields and adding burden to the environment.3 This latter concern is becoming more and more prevalent with the rapid development of consumer electronics leading to large amounts of electronic waste.4,5
Alternatively, widely accessible bio-based materials such as cellulose paper with good biocompatibility, biodegradability, flexibility and foldability have recently attracted great attention for future green and disposable flexible electronics.5–8 Cellulose is thermally stable with a more than an order of magnitude lower CTE than plastics, most metals, and ceramics, which is important to maintain the dimensional stability under thermal processing conditions.9 Cellulose paper also has excellent mechanical properties and printability, it can be adapted to high-speed roll-to-roll printing, and it can be folded by common methods to form complex 3D structures (e.g., by paper origami and kirigami).10,11 For example, paper folding and cutting techniques are used to: increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries;12 enhance the efficiency of solar cells;13 or develop deformable photodetector arrays.14 More intriguing properties, for example high optical transmittance and tunable optical haze, have been found with nanocellulose paper.15–17
A variety of methods have been developed to confer electrical conductivity to paper. Typically, these methods involve depositing conductive materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and metallic nanowires onto a paper substrate by filtration, sputtering,18 airbrushing,19 a variety of printing methods (inkjet printing,20 Meyer rod coating, spray coating, gravure coating21etc.), or soak-polymerizing conductive polymers such as polypyrroles (PPy) in a paper matrix.22,23 Despite these substantial efforts, the sheet resistance of most current conductive paper (1–100 Ω sq−1) is still much higher than those of metal coils (1 mΩ sq−1–0.5 Ω sq−1) and even ITO glass (∼10 Ω sq−1). To our knowledge, the most conductive paper reported to date integrated the use of CNTs and Ag NWs and offered a sheet resistance of 1 Ω sq−1.24 These results demonstrate exciting possibilities for obtaining conducting paper; yet despite this progress there remains a need to develop inexpensive and stable fabrication methods that can complement the existing high-volume low-cost methods of conventional paper manufacturing.
Here, we report highly conductive, pliable and foldable Cu/cellulose paper, which was enabled by a simple, low-cost and scalable wet-processing method to coat a highly conductive metal film onto common cellulose paper using an adhesion method inspired from nature. In nature, marine mussels strongly adhere onto a variety of substrates in a wet environment due to the catecholic moieties (e.g. dopamine residues) in the mussel adhesive proteins.25 The catecholic amino acid dopamine is also susceptible to self-polymerization to form polydopamine (PDA) that can strongly adhere to virtually any substrates and chelate with metal ions.26–28 Although PDA has been intensively studied as a surface coating agent for broad applications in the past decade,26,29 its function in fabricating conductive nano-metal films has never been found. Herein, we selected copper (Cu) because it possesses the second highest electrical conductivity (σ = 5.96 × 107 S m−1) among metals and it is inexpensive with a price that is only 1% that of silver, and we observed that it can be electrolessly deposited onto cellulose paper that has been pre-functionalized with PDA as a functional interfacial layer. We report that our Cu/cellulose paper offers high conductivities with a sheet resistance as low as 0.01 Ω sq−1 and excellent stability due to the strong adhesion between the metal and cellulose substrates. In addition, the defined nano- and micro-structures of the copper coating confer highly hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and excellent electromagnetic interface (EMI) shielding effectiveness. We envision that this high-performance paper electrode would satisfy the demand for a broad range of applications such as flexible electronics, packaging, and medical applications.
Results and discussion

In situ growth of copper nanoparticles (NPs) on a cellulose substrate

Fig. 1A illustrates the fabrication approach for growing copper on a cellulose substrate (yarn, paper, or fabric). The cellulose substrate is first immersed in dilute aqueous dopamine solution (1 mg ml−1, 10 mM Tris, pH = 8.5) to assemble a thin adherent dopamine film through interactions between the catechol groups in dopamine and the exposed hydroxyl groups in cellulose paper, and the self-polymerization of dopamine under these mild alkaline conditions to produce an adherent polydopamine (PDA) coating. PDA contains both catechol and amine functional groups that can act as reducing agents and binding reagents and thus PDA has been found to be a versatile platform for secondary reactions.30–36 In the next step, the PDA-functionalized cellulose paper is sequentially dipped in a catalyst ((NH4)2PdCl4) solution and then a CuSO4 solution to initiate an electroless deposition (ELD) of copper.

(C) Different Cu/cellulose paper forms obtained by cutting, folding and rolling. (D) Conductive Cu/cellulose yarns and Cu/cellulose fabrics obtained using the same method. 
This fabrication method is a completely solution-based procedure that can be potentially applied for conventional roll-to-roll processing for mass production of paper-based electronics. In this process, the PDA interfacial layer performs two key functions: confers strong adhesion to the cellulose substrate and enables catalyst chelation for subsequent ELD. ELD results in a visible color change from the dark PDA coating to glossy metallic purple (Fig. 1B). The resulting Cu/cellulose paper still retains the form of cellulose paper, and can be easily cut, folded and rolled into various shapes and structures (Fig. 1C). This fabrication process is broadly applicable to cellulosics and can be extended from paper to yarn and fabric platforms. For instance, Fig. 1D shows stable lighting of blue light-emitting-diodes (LED) by the Cu functionalized cellulose yarn and fabric, and these electrical properties were not destroyed by twisting, knotting, bending and twining.
The successful deposition of Cu on the paper substrate is confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the composite (Fig. 2A), with the peaks at 43.40°, 50.41°, 74.34° assigned to the diffraction planes of (111), (200), (220) of face-centered cubic crystalline copper (JCPDS file no. 04-0836). In addition, the well-defined diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 14.80°, 16.50°, 22.62°, and 34.25° are assigned to the diffraction planes of (101), (10), (200), and (040), respectively, of semi-crystalline cellulose I.37

(D) Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum of the Cu coated filter paper. 
The Cu/cellulose paper was further examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2B and C), which shows evidence for the elements C, O and Cu. The peaks for O and C are assigned to cellulose, whereas the new peaks for Cu 2p result from the generation of Cu crystals. The Cu 2p spectra of the Cu/cellulose paper consisted of two individual peaks at ∼933.8 and ∼932.2 eV attributed to CuO and Cu2O binding energies, respectively, suggesting that the surface of a Cu nanoparticle was susceptible to oxidation, mainly forming a composite structure of Cu–Cu2O.38,39 Finally, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Fig. 2D) also quantitatively confirmed the Cu feature on the cellulose fibers.
The morphology of the Cu paper after 20 minutes ELD is shown in Fig. 3(A–C). The first observation is that Cu is organized onto cellulose as nanoparticles (NPs) that uniformly coat the cellulose fibers, and the morphology of blank paper can be seen in Fig. S1.† The SEM image in Fig. 3 indicates a binary structure (micro- and nanostructures) on the surface of the cellulose fiber. Specifically, on the surface, papillae with an average diameter of about 5 μm can be seen (yellow circles labelled in Fig. 3C) and the size of the papillae increased from dozens of nanometers to several micrometers with the increase of the ELD time from 5 min to 30 min (ESI Fig. S2†). Numerous sub-nm pins were observed to be distributed on papillae, and they were uniformly coated on the cellulose fiber when the papillae became dense (Fig. 3B). The uniform distribution of papillae on the surface ensures that the surface contact area available for water is very small while the hydrophobic nano-pins prevent the penetration of water, and this results in a large water contact angle (about 143°).40,41 According to previous research studies, the polymerization process and the structure of polydopamine are complicated, and the interactions of polydopamine are complicated due to the covalent bonds between the aryl rings of the monomers, and intra- and interchain noncovalent interactions including hydrogen bonding, π-stacking and charge transfer.42–46 The complicated structure of polydopamine may play an important role during the nucleation and growth of copper nanoparticles, leading to the special binary structure.47–53

(E–F) Self-cleaning test shows a stream of water readily removing dirt from the surface (see Movies S1 and S3 in the ESI†). 
The special binary structure of the Cu NP layer on cellulose endows the composite material with interesting highly hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties, as illustrated in Fig. 3D. This self-cleaning capability is illustrated by the dirt removal test in Fig. 3(E–G) which shows that a stream of water can clean the dirt from the surface of the Cu/cellulose paper. This water leaves the surface without wetting and shows excellent self-cleaning capabilities (see Movie S1 in the ESI†). Similar binary structure and properties of the Cu/cellulose fabric can be seen in Fig. S3 and Movie S2.† The fabric was removed from water and remained fully dry without any trace of contamination again suggesting superior self-cleaning properties.
Mechanical stability and resilience of Cu/cellulose paper
The mechanical properties of the Cu/cellulose paper were investigated to ensure that the metalization process does not destroy the paper's structural integrity. The decomposition pattern and thermal stability of blank paper and Cu/cellulose paper were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; Fig. 4A) and derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG; Fig. 4B). The decomposition process in the examined temperature range could be divided into three stages. The first weight loss (<100 °C) was attributable to desorption of moisture, the second weight loss (around 200 °C) was due to dehydration of cellulose to dehydrocellulose, and the third weight loss (around 340 °C) occurs due to cellulose pyrolysis. The percentage of pyrolysis residues of blank paper and the Cu/cellulose paper at 700 °C was 12%, 36%, 39% and 47% for 0, 10, 20, and 30 min of ELD, respectively, indicating that the Cu content increased with the ELD time. Consistent with the interpretation of the TGA results is the observation that the DTG peaks appeared at the same temperature for samples prepared at different ELD times. These results indicate that the stability of the cellulose paper is not damaged by metalization.

Mechanical properties of the Cu/cellulose paper: (C) stress–strain curves and (D) tensile strength for blank and Cu paper with different ELD times. Pliability tests of Cu/cellulose paper: resistance changes of the Cu/cellulose paper for (E) different bending directions and (F) complex folded structures (inset picture illustrates the conducting properties of folded paper). 

Fig. 4C presents the typical stress–strain curves for the Cu/cellulose conductive paper samples. Increases in the ELD time generally resulted in small increases in the tensile strength (Fig. 4D). Similar trends were observed for the Young's modulus (Fig. S4†), while the elongation to break showed no obvious change with the ELD time (Fig. S5†). These results demonstrate that the mechanical performance of the paper is retained after metalization.
Conductive stability is essential for high-speed roll-to-roll fabrication and device stability. The stability of the conducting properties imparted to the paper was evaluated by measuring the sheet resistance after repeatedly deforming the Cu/cellulose paper. During bending, one face of the conductive paper is strained in tension while the other face is strained in compression stresses. Both tensile and compressive loading conditions are very important for industrial applications for flexible electronics and hence different loading conditions were explored here.54Fig. 4E illustrates that bending results in compression (C) to one face and tension (T) to the other face. Despite the strains imposed by bending, both faces retained high conductivity (low sheet resistance) even after 1000 bending cycles. Besides, the sheet resistance shows negligible changes after 1000 cycles of bending with the bending radius as low as 5 mm, revealing that the conductivity of the Cu/cellulose paper is hardly affected by bending (see Fig. S6†).
As a final example illustrating the electrical stability of this flexible material, the Cu/cellulose paper was folded into a simple but compact origami structure (i.e., a paper airplane). The conductivity of this structure is illustrated by its ability to serve as a lead for a circuit that illuminates an LED bulb. To demonstrate the electrical stability, the Cu/cellulose paper was unfolded and re-folded multiple times and the resistance was measured. A small gradual increase in the resistance is observed over 40 folding cycles while a larger resistance was observed after 50 times folding suggesting damage to the cellulose fibers (Fig. 4F and Fig. S7†). Importantly, when the Cu/cellulose paper was scratched with a piece of steel, metallic luster could be observed. The scratching could not exfoliate the copper coating from the surface of the paper, and the sheet resistance remained unchanged (0.05 Ω sq−1). Besides, a tape adhesion test also showed the strong adhesion between Cu particles and cellulose paper (see Fig. S8†). These results demonstrate that the Cu/cellulose paper is flexible and the electrical properties are stable during rather extreme deformation.
Electrical performance of Cu/cellulose paper
Cellulose paper is not intrinsically conductive and has a sheet resistance of about 1015 Ω sq−1;22 thus conducting materials must be added to confer conductivity. Fig. 5A shows that the mass and thickness of composite Cu/cellulose paper increased with the increase in the ELD time. The assembly of Cu NPs confers conductivity to the cellulose paper reducing the sheet resistance (Rs) by 16 orders of magnitude to 0.07 Ω sq−1 after only 10 min of ELD (Fig. 5B). Increasing the ELD time to 60 minutes resulted in an extremely low Rs of around 0.01 Ω sq−1 (conductivity of 5 × 105 S m−1). This Cu/cellulose paper with high conductivity, light weight and high strength is ideal for applications as flexible connecting leads in circuits. It was demonstrated that a series of white LEDs (the lowest operating potential is 2.5 V) can be simultaneously illuminated using the Cu paper as a connecting lead as depicted in the inset of Fig. 5B.

(A) Mass and thickness increase of Cu/cellulose paper with the ELD time and (B) sheet resistance decrease with the ELD time (inset shows illumination of a series of LEDs by using the Cu/cellulose paper as a connecting lead). (C) Comparison of sheet resistances of conductive paper samples. 
Many researchers have reported conductive paper. ITO can be coated on cellulose paper by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, forming conductive paper with a sheet resistance of 12 Ω sq−1.15 Furthermore, some alternative conducting materials, including carbon materials, conductive polymers, metal grids, and metallic nanowires, have been extensively investigated for flexible devices.55 Carbon materials could be attached to cellulose paper by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), Meyer rod coating or filtration.15,56 The sheet resistance values of such materials were generally hundreds of Ω sq−1.22 In addition, low cost polymer based conductive materials (e.g., polypyrrole (PPy) and PEDOT:PSS) have also been used to confer conductivity by bar coating or polymerization in situ.22 PEDOT:PSS coated paper showed very low resistance when immersed in polar solvents. To further lower the resistance, Ag NWs, Au NPs and Cu NPs have been coated onto cellulose paper by bar/spin coating, evaporative deposition or electroless deposition, and this has led to sheet resistance values as low as 0.5 Ω sq−1.24,57–59Fig. 5C shows that the sheet resistance of the Cu/cellulose paper reported here is at least one order of magnitude lower than the values previously reported for conductive paper. Comparing with the other types of flexible Cu-electrodes, such as Cu/plastics and Cu foil, this Cu/cellulose paper is still competitive in conductivity, which is detailed in Table S1.†39,59–65 Importantly, these high conductivities were achieved using solution-processing methods, which are highly controllable, low-cost, and readily scalable. Therefore, we envision that Cu/cellulose fabricated by polydopamine modification will be competitive to other conductive paper both in terms of performance (i.e., conductivity and stability) and cost.
Electromagnetic interface (EMI) shielding property of Cu/cellulose paper
The rapid development of modern electronics packed with highly integrated circuits generates severe electromagnetic radiation, which leads to harmful effects on highly sensitive precision electronic devices and the living environment for humans.66,67 Thus, there is a need for lightweight and flexible materials with excellent EMI shielding performance for applications that include portable and wearable devices.68 The EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of unmodified cellulose paper is nearly 0 dB due to its insulating feature.69 When paper was coated with Cu NPs, the EMI SE increased due to a combination of three effects illustrated in Fig. 6A: reflection at the surface of the paper due to the impedance mismatch between Cu NPs and air; absorption by Cu coated cellulose fibers resulting in the energy dissipation of the electromagnetic microwave; and the multiple internal reflections between Cu coated cellulose fibers.70 The EMI SE of the Cu/cellulose paper samples, whose conductivity values are shown in Table S2,† is evaluated in Fig. 6B. The EMI SE of the Cu paper samples with ELD for 10 min was about 67 dB in the low frequency range of 10 MHz–1.5 GHz. A further increase in the ELD time resulted in higher EMI SE of the Cu paper. Importantly, the EMI SE value of Cu paper with ELD of 60 min remained at 90 dB in the high frequency range of 1.5 GHz–18 GHz. This SE value is far higher than the target value of the EMI SE required for practical applications (≈20 dB), indicating that this highly conductive paper can be used as an effective EMI shielding material.

Photothermal conversion property of Cu/cellulose paper
Photoinduced heating of nanoparticles using near-infrared (NIR) or visible light has attracted much interest in recent years for cancer therapy, sterilization, evaporation systems and other applications.71,72 In this work, Fig. 6C shows the diagram of the photothermal conversion measurement; Cu/cellulose paper was irradiated with an 808 nm infrared diode laser, and a thermometer was used to test the real-time temperature of the paper. Excellent photothermal conversion properties were established with this Cu/cellulose paper (Fig. 6D) and fabric (Fig. S9†). Both of the materials exhibited a sharp increase in temperature, and the temperature increase approached a plateau after about 40 s irradiation, indicating that the conductive paper and fabric could rapidly convert laser energy to environmental heat due to the electron–phonon and phonon–phonon processes, which may be potentially applied in photothermal therapy, desalination, fractionation and sterilization.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated highly conductive paper through Cu NP coating using a simple, low-cost and scalable solution-processing method based on polydopamine adhesion. The Cu/cellulose paper retains the intrinsic mechanical strength and pliability of paper, while achieving high electrical conductivities (Rs of 0.01 Ω sq−1) and outstanding bending flexibility and stability. Moreover, the conductive paper has excellent self-cleaning, photothermal conversion and EMI shielding properties, which could be used in wearable thermotherapy, self-cleaning or protective electronics. These results demonstrate that this low-cost and scalable fabrication method offers exciting opportunities for a range of applications in flexible and wearable electronics.
Experimental
Materials
Dopamine hydrochloride (DOPA, 98% purity) and ammonium tetrachloropalladate ((NH4)2PdCl4) (Pd ≥36.5%) were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd. Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (ACS, >99.8%) was obtained from Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. Copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) (AR, 99%), potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate (C4H4O6KNa·4H2O) (ACS, 99%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (AR, 96%) and formaldehyde (HCHO) (AR, 37%) were obtained from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.
Preparation of Cu/cellulose conductive paper
Filter paper or fabrics with a specific size were dried at 105 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. Then the dried paper or fabrics were immersed in dopamine solution (1 mg ml−1, pH = 8.5, 10 mM Tris buffer) at room temperature overnight to form a polydopamine layer on the surface of the substrates, followed by washing thoroughly with deionized water. These polydopamine coated paper/fabrics were soaked in a (NH4)2PdCl4 (0.2–1 mg ml−1) solution with stirring for at least 30 min, and then rinsed with DI water repeatedly. Finally, the ELD of Cu on paper/fabrics was performed with different times in a plating bath consisting of a 1:1 mixture of freshly prepared solutions A and B; solution A contained NaOH (12 g L−1), CuSO4·5H2O (13 g L−1), and potassium sodium tartrate (29 g L−1) in DI. Solution B was an aqueous HCHO (9.5 ml L−1) solution. After ELD, all the samples were washed with DI water and dried at 50 °C under vacuum.
Characterization
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results were using an AMICUS (Shimadzu, Japan) spectrometer with an X-ray source, using monochromated Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV). The crystal structure was measured using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray tube. The acquisition was performed in the range of 5 to 80° in θ–2θ mode with a scan angle of 0.5° and a step size of 0.02° at a scanning speed of 0.1° per step. The thermal stability of the composited paper was evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA Q500, TA, USA), in which samples were heated in an aluminium crucible at a rate of 10 °C min−1 from ambient temperature to 700 °C, continually flushed with a nitrogen flow of 25 ml min−1. A tensile test was carried out using a micro tensile tester (INSTRON, 5565, USA) with a 50 mm gauge length (dimensions 15 mm × 100 mm) at a tensile velocity of 2 mm min−1. The morphologies of the samples were studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, Japan) and a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, LEO 1530VP, Germany). The contact angle was measured by using a Ramé-Hart Model 100 Contact Angle Goniometer with a micro-syringe attachment (manual system). The resistance values (R, Ω) of the samples were measured using an ohmmeter (UT52, MULTIMETER). The sheet resistance (Rs, Ω sq−1) of the samples were measured by a four-probe method (RTS-8, 4 PROBE TECH, China). The corresponding volume conductivity (σ, S m−1) was calculated using the formula: σ = 1/(RSt), where t (m) is the thickness of the conductive paper. The EMI SE was measured at room temperature in the frequency range of 8–18 GHz using a WILTRON 54169A scalar measurement system. The samples were cut to a rectangular shape with a dimension of 140 mm × 140 mm to fit the waveguide sample holder. Photothermal conversion properties were tested using an 808 nm infrared diode laser with a power density of 4 W cm−2 (Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd) and a thermometer (UNI-T 1310, UNI-T Electronic Crop).
