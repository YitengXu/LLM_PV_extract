    , Accepted 19th November 2018First published on 19th November 2018AbstractMorphologies and optoelectronic/mechanical properties of semiconducting polymers are significantly affected by their configurations. In this study, thiophene units are introduced into the backbone of a semiconducting polymer in either a regular (PffBT-T4) or a random (PffBT-RT4) manner to determine whether the resulting semiconducting polymers are suitable for developing efficient polymer solar cells. The energy levels of both polymers are highly similar because they share the same ratio of subunits in their backbones; however, PffBT-RT4 has lower crystallinity than PffBT-T4 due to its random configuration. Microstructural analyses indicate that PffBT-RT4 exhibits a shorter π–π stacking distance than PffBT-T4. Since short π–π stacking distance benefits interchain charge transport, PffBT-RT4 shows higher space-charge-limited current mobility, and PffBT-RT4 solar cells exhibit higher power conversion efficiency (PCE; 8.84%) than their PffBT-T4 counterparts (7.25%). In addition, PffBT-RT4 solar cells with active layers, prepared using a green solvent without any additive, show an encouraging PCE of 7.23%. Moreover, flexible solar cells based on PffBT-RT4 are much more stable during bending cycles than PffBT-T4 flexible solar cells. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the random configuration approach is a promising design strategy to realize semiconducting polymers for efficient, green-solvent-processable flexible polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are popular because they are inexpensive, lightweight, large-area manufacturing compatible, and offer the potential for fabricating flexible solar cells.1–8 PSCs based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture comprising a p-type polymer and an n-type small molecule or polymer as the electron donor and electron acceptor, respectively, have led to dramatic advances in solar cell performance.9–12
In such a BHJ architecture, where p-type and n-type semiconductors are intermixed to enlarge interfacial areas for efficient exciton dissociation, the semiconductors must have appropriate energy levels to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE).13,14 In numerous cases, donor–acceptor (D–A)-type semiconducting polymers, whose energy levels can be easily tuned through a combination of electron-rich (D) and electron-deficient (A) units as shown in Fig. 1a, have been used as p-type semiconductors whereas fullerene derivatives have been used as n-type semiconductors.15–17 In addition to being easily tuned, the D and A units can be altered to enhance intrachain charge transport due to push–pull driving forces, which can facilitate electron delocalization over the conjugated main backbone (Fig. 1b).18 Therefore, recent progress in the PCE of PSCs has largely been driven by the development of high-performance p-type D–A semiconducting polymers.19

A common design strategy to optimize the performance of D–A polymers involves side-chain engineering because side chains can determine the packing mode and stacking distance between adjacent backbones. This has a significant influence on the interchain charge transport.20–23 Although this approach is effective for optimizing a polymer microstructure for efficient charge transport, finding an optimum side chain with a good balance between electrical properties and processability is difficult.
We previously reported that charge transport in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was improved by introducing side-chain-free thiophene units into the P3HT backbone via random copolymerization.24 Although the random introduction of side-chain-free thiophene units led to an increase in backbone disorder, a shorter π–π stacking distance that favored interchain charge transport was achieved. Recently, Zhou et al. observed the same trend using regioregular and random polymers containing 5-fluorobenzothiadiazole and thiophene units.25 In addition to making interchain charge transport easier, the abovementioned approach also enhances the mechanical robustness of the polymer. The increased backbone disorder resulting from introducing thiophene units in a random manner softens the conjugated polymer backbone.26 Moreover, the enhanced backbone disorder hinders regular lamellar packing which results in lower crystallinity, which is favorable for flexible or stretchable electronic applications.27–29
Considering these previous reports, we introduced thiophene units into popular D–A-type polymers, i.e., 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4-(2-octyldodecyl)-2-thienyl)-2,1,3 benzothiadiazole (ffBT)-based polymers, which have been proven to be promising polymeric semiconductors for efficient PSCs,30–32 in a regular (PffBT-T4) and random (PffBT-RT4) manner (Fig. 1c). To minimize the difference between their energy levels, the two polymers were prepared with the same ratio of ffBT and thiophene units. Properties such as crystallinity, solubility in a green solvent, microstructural features, and photovoltaic performance of PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4 were compared. Moreover, flexible PSCs based on both types of polymers were fabricated, and then their photovoltaic performances during bending cycles were also evaluated.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic schemes for PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4. Both polymers were prepared via Stille condensation of a dibrominated ffBT monomer with the corresponding thiophene monomers. As shown in Table 1, the molecular weights and polydispersity indices of both polymers are very similar, which is essential to avoiding molecular weight effects on chain aggregation and optoelectronic properties. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) profiles of PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4 are shown in Fig. S1.† To polymerize PffBT-T4, 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene was used as the thiophene monomer. Meanwhile, (5-bromothiophen-2-yl)trimethylstannane and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene were used to polymerize PffBT-RT4. Thiophene units can be randomly incorporated into the backbone because the (5-bromothiophen-2-yl)trimethylstannane monomer can react with both dibrominated ffBT and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene monomers as well as with another unit of (5-bromothiophen-2-yl)trimethylstannane monomer.

The polymers' chemical structures were investigated using 1H NMR spectroscopy, which confirmed the two polymers contain almost the same ratio of ffBT and thiophene units (Fig. S2, S3†). The deuterated solvent of choice was 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-D2 because its peak (δ 6 ppm) does not overlap with those in the aromatic region, especially in the 7.0–8.5 ppm range, where incorporating thiophene units causes the most significant changes (Fig. 2). In the 1H NMR spectrum of PffBT-T4, two sharp peaks, corresponding to the protons on the alkyl thiophene and thiophene rings, can be observed at 8.23 and 7.28 ppm, respectively. In contrast, the 1H NMR spectrum of PffBT-RT4 shows many peaks around 8.23 and 7.3 ppm, indicating random incorporation of thiophene units into the backbone. These results suggest that PffBT-T4 has a highly regular configuration, whereas PffBT-RT4 has a random configuration with a high degree of backbone disorder.
 Fig. 2  
1H NMR spectra of PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm. 
In addition, to confirm the reproducibility of the synthesis of PffBT-RT4, we repeated the synthetic procedure three more times under the same conditions, affording PffBT-RT4(#2), (#3), and (#4), respectively. As shown in Table S1, similar molecular weights and polydispersity indices were attained. Fig. S4† includes the GPC profiles of these polymers. Moreover, the number of side-chain-free units which were randomly incorporated into the backbone in each batch was compared using 1H NMR spectra, particularly in the range between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm. As shown in Fig. S5,† the three polymers exhibited similar values. These results demonstrate the high reproducibility of the synthesis of PffBT-RT4.
Thermal properties and crystallinity
The polymers' thermal properties were investigated via thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Although both polymers had highly similar thermal stability according to TGA measurements (Fig. S6†), their thermal properties such as melting temperature (Tm), recrystallization temperature (Tc), and enthalpy of fusion (ΔHf) obtained via DSC measurement were distinctly different (Fig. 3a). Table 1 summarizes the polymers' thermal properties.
 Fig. 3  (a) DSC thermograms and (b) tapping-mode AFM height images of polymer:PC71BM blend films based on PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4. 
In the DSC thermogram of PffBT-T4, Tm and Tc occurred at 267.7 °C (onset: 229 °C) and 251 °C, corresponding to endothermic and exothermic processes, respectively. PffBT-RT4 exhibited lower Tm and Tc than PffBT-T4, indicating decreased intermolecular interactions between polymer chains in the crystalline domains due to the random configuration hindering regular and robust chain packing. This phenomenon was associated with a drop in ΔHf (Table 1), which indicates considerably decreased crystallinity of PffBT-RT4 compared with PffBT-T4.
Phase-separation behavior is closely related to miscibility of polymer donors and small-molecule acceptors and significantly affects the performance of PSCs with BHJ architecture.33,34 Recently, L. Ye et al. reported a simple way to estimate miscibility of blends by measuring Tm depression using DSC.35 Therefore, we measured Tm of PffBT-T4:PC71BM and PffBT-RT4:PC71BM blends to compare their miscibility and observed that Tm of PffBT-RT4 considerably decreased after blending compared to PffBT-T4 (Fig. S7†). This clearly suggests PffBT-RT4 exhibits higher miscibility with PC71BM due to its lower crystallinity.
This behaviour was also observed in their atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. As can be seen in Fig. 3b, the AFM image of PffBT-T4:PC71BM shows more defined grain boundaries and a rougher surface (RMS = 10.7 nm) than that of PffBT-RT4:PC71BM (RMS = 5.78). A similar trend was observed in neat polymer films (Fig. S8†). These results indicate PffBT-RT4 is more suitable than PffBT-T4 for forming a desirable blend morphology that can facilitate exciton dissociation due to its lower crystallinity.
Optical and electronic properties
PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4 solutions in DCB were characterized using temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectroscopy to investigate how the different configurations affect optical properties when the two polymers have the same ratio of subunits in their backbones. Table 1 presents a detailed summary of their absorption properties. All absorption spectra were normalized to their respective A0–1 peaks to clearly show the relative intensities of the A0–0 shoulder peaks at approximately λ = 700 nm, which strongly depend on the degree of polymer aggregation.
At 25 °C, the UV-vis spectrum of the PffBT-T4 solution exhibits an A0–1 peak at around λ = 630 nm and a distinct A0–0 peak, suggesting a strong chain aggregation in the solution (Fig. 4a). In contrast, the UV-vis spectrum of the PffBT-RT4 solution shows an A0–1 peak at around λ = 560 nm and a much weaker A0–0 peak compared with the PffBT-T4 solution (Fig. 4b). This difference indicates PffBT-RT4 has a higher degree of backbone torsion in solution at 25 °C than PffBT-T4, which also results in limited backbone aggregation. In both polymer solutions, the A0–1 peaks were blue-shifted to around λ = 540 nm, and the intensities of the A0–0 peaks gradually diminished upon heating from 25 °C to 90 °C due to enhanced backbone torsion at a higher temperature and reduced aggregation, respectively.

The PffBT-T4 film gave rise to a spectrum nearly identical to that of the PffBT-T4 solution at 25 °C, suggesting no distinct changes in the chain conformation and aggregation of the PffBT-T4 solution occurred upon spin-coating (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, the PffBT-RT4 film spectrum also exhibits an A0–1 peak at λ = 630 nm and a distinct A0–0 shoulder peak, indicating that considerable backbone planarization and interchain packing occurred during the spin-coating process.
Cyclic voltammetry was performed to evaluate the two polymers' energy levels, which are summarized in Table 1. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were estimated from the oxidation onsets in the cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S9†). The HOMO energy levels of PffB-T4 and PffBT-RT4 were calculated to be −5.30 and −5.31 eV, respectively, using the energy level of ferrocene at −4.8 eV as an internal standard. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were derived from the HOMO levels and the optical bandgaps (ΔEg) determined from the absorption onsets. The LUMO levels of PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4 were calculated to be −3.69 and −3.68 eV, respectively.
Photovoltaic performance
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4 PSCs, we fabricated BHJ solar cells with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. Details of the device fabrication process are provided in the ESI.† We first prepared polymer:PC71BM blend films on top of a ZnO layer by spin-coating polymer solutions and PC71BM in DCB with 3 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive. In addition, we attempted to prepare blend films using the green solvent, 2-methylanisole (2MA) without additives. This green solvent, which is much more eco-friendly than commonly used nonhalogenated solvents, such as o-xylene, mesitylene, or 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, is safe enough to be used as a food additive and has been successfully used in green-solvent-processable, solar cell applications.36–40 However, PffBT-T4's low solubility in 2MA hampered preparation of the corresponding blend film; only PffBT-RT4:PC71BM blend films were prepared. This was, most likely, due to PffBT-RT4's low structural regularity, caused by its random configuration enhancing its solubility in 2MA. Accordingly, the absorption spectrum of the PffBT-T4 solution in 2MA, shown in Fig. S10,† is significantly blue-shifted compared with that in the DCB solution at 25 °C (Fig. 4a). This implies that only short polymer chains were dissolved in 2MA, whereas the PffBT-RT4 spectrum in 2MA exhibits a similar absorption maximum and onset to that obtained in the DCB solution at 25 °C (Fig. 4b). Moreover, a PffBT-RT4 film coated using 2MA showed a very similar absorption spectrum to that coated using DCB (Fig. S11†).

Table 2 and Fig. 5a show the best photovoltaic performance and current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal PSCs among ten devices, respectively. A PffBT-T4 PSC with the blend film, prepared using DCB and DIO (PffBT-T4:PC71BM-DCB), achieved short-circuit current density (JSC) = 14.63 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) = 0.71 V, fill factor (FF) = 0.70, and PCE = 7.25%, whereas a PffBT-RT4 PSC fabricated under identical conditions (PffBT-RT4:PC71BM-DCB) showed enhanced performance (JSC = 17.40 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.71 V, FF = 0.71, and PCE = 8.84%). We also fabricated photovoltaic PSCs based on PffBT-RT4(#2), (#3), and (#4) using identical conditions. Their J–V curves are shown in Fig. S12.† As can be extracted from Table S1,† good reproducibility of photovoltaic performances was achieved using PffBT-RT4(#2), (#3), and (#4).

 Fig. 5  (a) J–V curves and (b) EQE spectra of the devices. (c) SCLC mobilities of the neat polymer films. 
The relatively low PCE of PffBT-T4, compared to that previously reported by Y. Liu et al., is mainly due to its low molecular weight and broad molecular weight distribution.32 The PffBT-RT4-DCB PSC exhibited higher JSC and, consequently, higher PCE than the PffBT-T4-DCB PSC. This result is supported by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and SCLC mobility data, where the PffBT-RT4-DCB PSC and the corresponding film showed higher maximum EQE and mobility, respectively (Fig. 5b, c).
Surprisingly, the PffBT-RT4 PSC with the blend film, prepared using 2MA without additives (PffBT-RT4:PC71BM-2MA), showed a PCE comparable with that of the PffBT-T4-DCB PSC. This was a result of their comparable EQE value and SCLC mobility. Although the PCE of the PffBT-RT4:PC71BM-2MA PSC was lower than that of the PffBT-RT4:PC71BM-DCB PSC, this result is encouraging because PSCs processed using nonhalogenated solvents generally exhibit a significant drop in their PCE values.41–44 Zhao et al. recently reported that PSCs based on benzothiadiazole-containing polymers, fabricated using a nonhalogenated solvent and a suitable additive, showed higher PCEs than those fabricated using chlorobenzene and DIO. However, those processed without an additive showed much lower PCEs than those fabricated with the halogenated solvents.45 Therefore, our result demonstrates that the random configuration approach is a promising design strategy to realize efficient and green-solvent-processable D–A semiconducting polymers.
Morphology characterization
Since the morphology of blend films significantly affects their photovoltaic performance, polymer:PC71BM blend films based on PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4 were characterized using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). As shown in Fig. 6, all patterns show scattering rings arising from PC71BM.
 Fig. 6  GWAXS patterns of polymer:PC71BM blend films. 
In the GIWAXS pattern of a PffBT-T4:PC71BM-DCB blend film, several distinct scattering peaks can be observed, indicating well-ordered and long-range chain packing of the PffBT-T4 polymer chains in a regular and periodic manner. Among them, the distinct (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction indicates a high degree of π–π stacking. On the other hand, the patterns corresponding to PffBT-RT4:PC71BM-DCB and PffBT-RT4:PC71BM-2MA are almost identical and show less distinct and arc-shaped scattering peaks than the PffBT-T4:PC71BM-DCB pattern, which suggests that PffBT-RT4 exhibits lower crystallinity than PffBT-T4, as observed in the DSC measurement, and a random orientation of the crystallites. A similar trend was observed in the GIWAXS patterns of neat PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4 films, indicating that the BHJ architecture does not disturb the polymers' packing behavior (Fig. S13†).
The interchain distances of the blend and neat films were obtained using their GIWAXS spectra (Fig. S14†). The PffBT-T4:PC71BM-DCB film was found to exhibit both the shortest out-of-plane and in-plane lamellar packing distances (Table 3). Interestingly, PffBT-RT4:PC71BM blend films showed different π–π stacking distances depending on the processing solvent. The shortest π–π stacking distances in both out-of-plane and in-plane directions were achieved in the PffBT-RT4:PC71BM-DCB film, whereas PffBT-T4:PC71BM-DCB and PffBT-RT4:PC71BM-2MA films exhibited similar π–π stacking distances. A similar tendency was observed in neat polymer films (Table S2†). The trend of π–π stacking distances is well matched with the SCLC mobilities, confirming the popular notion that short π–π stacking distances are essential for efficient interchain charge transport because charge is transferred from one chain to another via π-orbital overlap between adjacent conjugated backbones.

Strain-dependent photovoltaic performance and microstructures
Polymers with lower crystallinity are more tolerant of mechanical deformation than those with higher crystallinity because cracks tend to begin at the crystalline domains' boundaries during mechanical deformation.26,46–48 Therefore, we used PffBT-RT4 to fabricate flexible PSCs using flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates, expecting the lower crystallinity of PffBT-RT4 to render it more tolerant of mechanical deformation. For the purpose of comparison, flexible PSCs based on PffBT-T4 were also fabricated. Blend films of PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4 PSCs were prepared using DCB and 2MA, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the J–V curves of the flexible PSCs as a function of bending cycles.
 Fig. 7  
J–V curves of flexible PSCs based on (a) PffBT-T4 and (b) PffBT-RT4 as a function of bending cycles. The bending radius was 4.5 mm. 
Both flexible PSCs exhibited very similar PCEs prior to bending. However, in the case of the PffBT-T4 flexible PSC, the PCE rapidly decreased during a bending test at a bending radius of 4.5 mm, reaching 0.87% after 100 bending cycles (Fig. 7a). In contrast, the PffBT-RT4 flexible PSCs' PCE nearly maintained its initial level even after 100 bending cycles (Fig. 7b). The decreased in the PffBT-T4 flexible PSC's PCE was attributed to the decrease in Jsc and FF, which suggests that the charge extraction from the active layer to the external circuit and transport become limited due to a morphology change as the number of bending cycles increases.49,50
Thus, we investigated the strain-dependent microstructural features of PffBT-T4:PC71BM-DCB and PffBT-RT4:PC71BM-2MA blend films as a function of the number of stretches. We applied tensile stress to the blend films, rather than bending stress, because the former is much more effective for monitoring changes in the polymers' microstructures.
After spin-coating solutions containing the corresponding polymer and PC71BM on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate, the obtained film was stretched to 50% strain using a stretching jig. After releasing the film, its microstructure of was characterized using GIWAXS. For the PffBT-T4:PC71BM-DCB film, the out-of-plane (100) peak intensity decreased significantly as the film was stretched five times and almost vanished after ten stretches (Fig. 8a). This indicates that the crystalline regions were destroyed or transformed into amorphous regions by stretching. Conversely, the intensity of the (100) peak for the PffBT-RT4:PC71BM-2MA film decreased only slightly even after 100 stretches (Fig. 8b), suggesting that PffBT-RT4 can dissipate applied energy more effectively than PffBT-T4.

These results indicate that the significant alteration of the microstructure of highly crystalline PffBT-T4 during the application of the bending cycles limits the charge extraction and transport with a concomitant significant decrease in PCE. Conversely, PffBT-RT4 with low crystallinity can dissipate external energy very well because coiled amorphous chains can aid energy dissipation when the polymer film is subjected to strain.26,27,51
Conclusions
We successfully introduced thiophene units into the backbone of an ffBT-based polymer in either a regular or random manner, producing polymers PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4, respectively. Although PffBT-T4 and PffBT-RT4 have highly similar energy levels, PffBT-RT4 PSCs showed better photovoltaic performance than their PffBT-T4 counterparts fabricated under the same conditions due to the shorter π–π staking distance between PffBT-RT4 polymer chains, which can facilitate interchain charge transport. Moreover, PffBT-RT4's lower crystallinity resulted in better solubility in a green solvent and improved its tolerance of mechanical deformation. Therefore, this study provides additional support for the notion that closer π–π stacking can lead to more efficient interchain charge transport. Further, semiconducting polymers with low crystallinity are more suitable for green-solvent-processable flexible electronics compared to highly crystalline semiconducting polymers.
