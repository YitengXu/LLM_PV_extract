    , Accepted 23rd July 2018First published on 23rd July 2018AbstractLattice defects of semiconductors have a tremendous influence on the photo-absorption and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs; thus the photocatalytic performance of a semiconductor can be modulated by creation of defects on/in it. In this work, WO3−X photocatalysts with oxygen vacancies were prepared from highly crystalline WO3 by vacuum heat treatment. The resulting WO3−X samples with defects were characterized by Raman, XPS, DRS, ESR and photocatalytic water oxidation experiments. The results revealed that the visible light absorption of WO3−X increased with increasing vacuum heat treatment temperature. The surface oxygen vacancies of WO3−X could significantly improve the photoelectric behaviour. WO3−X showed the maximum photocurrent density, which is 3 times higher than that of the pristine WO3, and a much higher photocatalytic activity than the pristine WO3. The surface oxygen vacancies on WO3−X played a more important role in the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and improvement of the photocatalytic activity than the bulk defects. These results indicated that controlling of the number and types of oxygen vacancies on WO3 is important to obtain high-performance WO3−X photocatalysts.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor photocatalysis has attracted enormous attention for its potential application prospects in environmental remediation and solar-to-fuel energy conversion. Hundreds of photocatalysts have been developed over the past few decades.1–7 Among them, nano-WO3, an important visible light n-type semiconductor photocatalyst, has been widely used in organic pollutant degradation,8–15 water decomposition16–20 and CO2 reduction21 due to its low toxicity, stability, and strong oxidizing properties. In order to enhance its photocatalytic activity, various nanostructures and morphologies of WO3 have been synthesized, such as nanosheeets,9 nanorods,6,22 nanowires,23 and nanoporous structures.24 However, the photocatalytic activities of these WO3 species under visible light are still low for practical application because there are two main factors that inhibit the visible light photocatalytic activity of WO3: (i) the band gap of WO3 is too wide to utilize most of the visible light (∼2.8 eV),17 and (ii) the photogenerated electrons and holes in WO3 easily recombine.12 Therefore, development of new methods to broaden the light absorption range and to enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers is still a significant research direction.
In recent years, defect engineering has been widely used in the materials community for improving the performance of metal oxide semiconductors. Both the theoretical calculations and the experimental characterizations have revealed that defects affect the optical absorption, separation and migration of photogenerated carriers, electrical conductivity, and surface properties of materials.25–28 However, the crystal defects can have both positive and negative effects on the photocatalysis. For example, bulk phase lattice defects tend to decrease the photocatalytic activity, while surface lattice defects generally increase the photocatalytic performance. It is considered generally that the bulk phase lattice defects play the role of recombination centres of electrons and holes,10,17 while the surface lattice defects improve not only the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs by temporarily capturing photogenerated charges, but also facilitate the adsorption of reactant molecules onto the surface.29 So creation of appropriate amounts of defects on a high crystallinity WO3 surface may be an effective strategy to enhance its visible light photocatalytic activity.
Herein, a simple and economical vacuum deoxidation method was used to create surface oxygen vacancy defects in WO3. The concentration of surface oxygen vacancy defects was controlled by the vacuum heat treatment temperature. It is showed that the surface oxygen vacancies are indeed advantageous in enhancing the light absorption and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs for WO3. This work provides an effective method to fabricate surface oxygen vacancy defects in WO3 for improving its photocatalytic performance.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials synthesis
The highly crystallized WO3 particles were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route followed by calcination in air. 1 g of NaWO4·2H2O and 20 ml of deionized water were added into a 100 ml of Teflon-lined autoclave, and then stirred for 10 minutes to achieve a transparent clear solution. Thereafter, 60 ml of HNO3 (2 mol L−1) was added into the above solution. After stirring for another 1 h, the autoclave was sealed and heated to 180 °C for 6 h. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the pale yellow products were washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and were dried at 60 °C in air. To obtain good crystals, the above yellow product was further calcined in air at 800 °C for 2 h and then ground into fine power. The nonstoichiometric WO3−X photocatalysts with oxygen vacancies were obtained by the following procedure: a glass cell was used to deposit the samples, which permitted the evacuation and heating of the sample. An all-glass vacuum system was used and could be evacuated down to 2.2 Pa. The pristine WO3 powder was loaded into the glass cell and evacuated in the all-glass vacuum system at 150 °C, 250 °C, 350 °C, 450 °C and 550 °C for 2 h, respectively. The pressure in the vacuum system was about 1.8–2.2 Pa. The obtained samples were marked as W150, W250, W350, W450 and W550 according to the treatment temperature.
2.2 Materials characterization
The crystalline structures of the photocatalysts were determined using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Cary 500), where pure BaSO4 powder was used as the reflectance standard sample. A field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; Hitachi) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; FEI Talos F200S) were utilized to detect the morphology and structure of tungsten oxide. Raman spectroscopy measurements were conducted using an inVia-Reflex micro-Raman spectroscopy system (IK Series He–Cd laser wavelength = 532 nm). The chemical element states of the samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were collected on a Bruker A300 paramagnetic spectrometer at room temperature in a vacuum.
2.3 Photoeletrochemical measurements
Photocurrent densities were measured through a conventional three-electrode system in a Pyrex glass cell using an electrochemical analyser (CHI650E, Shanghai Chenhua, China). A typical working electrode was prepared as follows: 10 mg solid power sample was dispersed in 1 ml ethanol by an ultrasonication method, 10 μl of the solution was dropped onto an FTO glass with an area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm, until the glass naturally dries, and then the above operation was repeated several times. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl electrode was treated as the reference electrode. In the photocurrent density tests, the three electrodes were immersed in an electrolyte of 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution, the working electrode was illuminated by a 300 W Xe lamp with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) and the intensity of the Xe lamp was 0.38 cm−1.
2.4 Visible light photocatalytic activity test
The photocatalytic performances of the pristine WO3 and oxygen-defected WO3−X samples were evaluated by photocatalytic water oxidation reaction under visible light irradiation by a 300 W Xe lamp (Perfect Light, PLS-SXE300C) with an ultraviolet cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) and the intensity of the Xe lamp was 0.38 cm−1. The photocatalytic O2 evolution reactions were carried out in a Pyrex reactor, which was connected to a vacuum system and a gas-closed circulation system. In a representative experiment, 100 mg catalyst was dispersed in 80 ml deionized water, and then 20 ml AgNO3 aqueous solution (10 mg L−1) as the photoelectron sacrificial reagent was added into the above solution. The amount of evolved O2 was determined using an online gas chromatograph (FULI 9790II, TCD, Ar carrier).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and formation scheme of nonstoichiometric WO3−X
The synthesis process of the WO3−X samples with surface oxygen vacancies is shown in Scheme 1. The precursor WO3·0.33H2O with high crystallinity was synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction of NaWO4·2H2O and HNO3 (Fig. S1†).30 The resulting WO3·0.33H2O was transformed into well-crystallized WO3 particles by calcination at high temperature in air. Finally, the oxygen-defected WO3−X samples were obtained by vacuum deoxidation at different temperatures.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration for the synthesis of WO3−X samples. 
The possible formation mechanism of the surface oxygen vacancies has been suggested by some authors.31 Under vacuum heat treatment conditions, a fraction of W–O bonds breaks and the oxygen atoms leave the surface lattice to form oxygen vacancies, along with the reduction of W6+ to W5+. According to the Kröger–Vink notation, the above process could be expressed as follows, (1) (2)
In eqn (1), O×O and V˙˙O represent the lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancy, respectively. In eqn (2), W×W and W′W represent W6+ and W5+, respectively. According to eqn (1) and (2), one oxygen vacancy is formed by two W6+ ions capturing two electrons to form two W5+ ions. So the whole process can be described by eqn (3): (3)
3.2 X-ray diffraction study

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the pristine WO3 and the WO3−X samples treated at 150 °C, 250 °C, 350 °C, 450 °C, and 550 °C. All the samples show a monoclinic phase structure according to JCPDS No. 43-1035,32 implying that the vacuum heat treatment doesn't significantly damage the bulk crystal structure of the pristine WO3. Fig. 1b is a partially enlarged view of Fig. 1a. It is clearly seen that the relative intensity of the (−112) peak (2θ = 28.615°) gradually increases, and the intensity of the (112) peak (2θ = 28.937°) gradually decreases. In other words, the intensity ratio of the (−112) peak to the (112) peak increases with increasing vacuum treatment temperature. In addition, the intensity ratio of the (022) peak (2θ = 33.266°) and the (−202) peak (2θ = 33.575°) shows a similar change to that of the (−112) peak and the (112) peak. This indicates that the crystal planes of (112) and (−202) are more easily damaged, that is to say, oxygen vacancies are more easily generated at the (112) and (−202) crystal planes.

3.3 UV-vis DRS study

Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples. It can be seen that the absorption band edge of the highly crystallized WO3 is at ca. 460 nm, and there is substantially no absorption of long-wave visible light in 460–800 nm. However, the absorption band edges of W150, W250, W350, W450, and W550 samples gradually shift to the long-wave visible light region, and the samples still maintain the absorption of UV light. The vacuum heat treated samples exhibit gradually enhanced visible light absorption in the 480–800 nm wavelength range with the increase in the treatment temperature. This may be ascribed to the change of the sample's colour and the increased number of oxygen vacancies. As shown in the inset, the sample's colour changes from yellow to light green and eventually to dark blue, indicating the enhanced absorption of visible light of WO3−X. The deeper the sample's colour, the higher the absorption of visible light of the sample. In addition, the change of the sample's colour may be attributed to the increase of oxygen vacancy number.33 This suggestion was confirmed by the XPS experiment. As can be seen in Table 1, when the vacuum heat treatment temperature increased from 150 °C to 550 °C, the proportion of W5+ on the photocatalysts gradually increased, which indicates that the defects increase as the vacuum treatment temperature increases. A large number of oxygen vacancies may form defective energy levels in the forbidden band of WO3−X, which narrow the band gap and enhance the visible light absorption.34–36 Therefore, the enhanced visible light absorption should be caused by the oxygen vacancies and the sample's colour.37

3.4 Morphology and structure of materials
The SEM images of the samples are showed in Fig. 3(a–f). It can be seen that vacuum heat treatment doesn't lead to an obvious increase in the size of the high crystallinity WO3 particles, and the particle diameters of all the samples are distributed in the range of 200–600 nm. This reveals that the prepared WO3 particles have good thermal stability.

In order to visually observe the formation of surface oxygen vacancy defects, we performed high-resolution transmission electron microscopy characterization of WO3 and WO3−X. According to the HRTEM images in Fig. 4(A–F), the high-crystallinity WO3 shows clear and perfect lattice fringes, but the surface of the vacuum heat treated samples shows an obvious disordered amorphous shell. The surface lattice disordered area thickness of W150, W250, and W350 samples is less than 1 nm. This shows that shallow surface oxygen vacancy defects are mainly generated when the vacuum treatment temperature increases from 150 °C to 350 °C. When the vacuum treatment temperature increases to 450 °C and 550 °C, the thickness of the disordered lattice regions in the W450 and W550 samples, respectively, increases to about 2 nm and 3.5 nm, which indicates that when the temperature exceeds 350 °C, the deep oxygen vacancy defects rapidly increase.

3.5 Raman spectra study
Raman spectroscopy is an effective method for studying surface molecular structures, so we used it to explore the effect of oxygen vacancy defects on the surface structure of the samples. As shown in Fig. 5, the stretching vibration of O–W–O bonds occurs at 806 cm−1, and the bending vibration peaks of O–W–O bonds for WO3 are located at 275 cm−1.38 Since Raman spectroscopy is an effective method to determine the concentration of defects, it is often used to characterize the oxygen vacancy content.39 By comparison of the Raman spectra of the samples, it can be seen obviously that the intensities of the characteristic Raman peaks of the samples become weaker and weaker from WO3 to W550, indicating that the number of oxygen vacancies increases with increasing vacuum heat treatment temperature.40

3.6 Surface chemical compositions of WO3−X
To further confirm the existence of oxygen vacancies on the surface of WO3−X, the chemical states of W were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The valence and composition of elements on the surface of the samples were investigated by means of XPS-peak-differentiation-imitating analysis. As shown in Fig. 6a, only two peaks belonging to W6+ are observed for the pristine WO3. However, for the vacuum heat treated samples (Fig. 6b–f), two new peaks ascribed to W5+ are observed, which indicates that oxygen vacancy defects have been successfully created on the surface of WO3. For example, the W 4f XPS spectra in Fig. 6b show that the W150 surface has two valence states of W species. The peaks at 35.57 eV (green line) and 37.72 eV (blue line) correspond to 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 of W6+, respectively. The other two peaks at 35.30 eV (orange line) and 37.45 eV (violet line) belong to 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 of W5+, respectively.33,40
 Fig. 6  W 4f XPS spectra of (a) the pristine WO3, (b) W150, (c) W250, (d) W350, (e) W450, and (f) W550. 
According to the fitting peaks of W 4f, the contents of W6+ and W5+ on the surface of the different samples were calculated, respectively, and are shown in Table 1. It is clear that the concentration of W5+ on the photocatalyst's surface gradually increased with increasing vacuum treatment temperature, which suggests an increase in the surface oxygen vacancies at higher vacuum treatment temperature.
3.7 ESR study
Another method to confirm the existence of oxygen vacancy defects is electron spin resonance (ESR) determination, which verifies the presence of surface oxygen vacancies and the overall oxygen vacancy defect concentration in WO3−X samples. As shown in Fig. 7, the treated samples show two distinct symmetrical ESR signal peaks at g = 2.002, whereas the pristine WO3 sample shows no signal peak. This indicates that the oxygen vacancy defects are successfully generated in WO3.41 In addition, the signal peak intensities of the samples increase from W150 to W550, indicating that the oxygen vacancy concentrations of the samples increase with increasing vacuum treatment temperature, which is consistent with the above characterization results.

3.8 Influence of vacuum treatment temperature on surface oxygen vacancy and bulk phase oxygen vacancy concentrations
According to the law of charge conservation, the formation of one oxygen vacancy would be accompanied by the formation of two W5+ around it, so the content of W5+ is twice that of oxygen vacancies. Therefore, we could obtain the surface oxygen vacancy concentration by analyzing the surface W5+ content. As a semiconductor surface analysis technology, the XPS analysis depth is a few nanometres. For this reason, we can analyze the surface oxygen vacancy concentration by calculating the surface W5+ content from the XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 8a, with the increase in vacuum heat treatment temperature from 150 °C to 350 °C, the surface W5+ content increases faster and faster. But when the temperature increases from 350 °C to 550 °C, the increasing speed of the surface W5+ content gets slower and slower. This phenomenon may be ascribed to the surface lattice oxygen atoms leaving at low temperature to form surface oxygen vacancies, but when the temperature is higher, the bulk phase lattice oxygen atoms break the chemical bonds and migrate to the surface to fill some surface oxygen vacancy defects, which slows the increase of surface oxygen vacancies. In Fig. 8b, the intensity of oxygen vacancy ESR signals quickly becomes strong with increasing temperature. This indicates that the overall oxygen vacancy concentration increases sharply with the increase of vacuum heat treatment temperature from 150 °C to 550 °C. Based on the above analysis, we can know that the samples mainly generate surface oxygen vacancies from 150 °C to 350 °C, but from 350 °C to 550 °C, bulk phase oxygen vacancies are mainly generated.

3.9 Photoelectrochemical characterization
The photocurrent density test results of WO3 and oxygen-defected WO3−X sample electrodes under visible light irradiation are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the photocurrent densities of the samples are in the order: W350 > W250 > W150 > WO3 > W450 > W550. With the increase of the vacuum treatment temperature from 150 °C to 350 °C, the photocurrent densities of W150, W250 and W350 increase gradually, and their photocurrent densities are about 2, 2.5, and 3 times that of WO3, respectively. This indicates that the surface oxygen vacancy defects make the WO3 semiconductor have a higher separation efficiency and migration rate for photogenerated carriers. When the vacuum treatment temperature increases from 350 °C to 550 °C, the photocurrent densities of W450 and W550 drop sharply and are even lower than the photocurrent density of WO3. This suggests that the bulk phase oxygen vacancy defects are the recombination centres of photogenerated charges, which inhibit the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Clearly, W350, which was prepared at 350 °C by vacuum treatment, shows a maximum value of photocurrent density. According to the XPS and ESR characterization tests, W350 has the shallowest surface oxygen vacancies compared to W150, W250, and W350. At the same time, the deep bulk phase oxygen vacancies in W350 almost have not been generated. Therefore, it is known that if more surface oxygen vacancies in WO3 are generated, while avoiding the generation of bulk phase oxygen vacancies as much as possible, WO3−X would have the largest photogenerated carrier separation efficiency.

3.10 Effect of oxygen vacancies on the photocatalytic activity of WO3
The photocatalytic activity of the pristine WO3 and vacuum heat treated WO3 samples was evaluated by photocatalytic water oxidation with Ag+ as the electron-acceptor scavenger under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). As shown in Fig. 10, the photocatalytic activity of oxygen-defected WO3−X first increases and then decreases with increasing vacuum deoxidation temperature. The average oxygen production activity of the WO3, W150, W250, and W350 samples within 4 h is 214.3, 233.5, 265.4, and 278.6 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. However, the average oxygen production activity of W450 and W550 within 4 h is only 37.7 and 18.4 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Obviously, when the vacuum treatment temperature is lower than 350 °C, the O2 evolution rate increases with increasing vacuum treatment temperature. This indicates that the surface oxygen vacancies can promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and then enhance the photocatalytic activity. When the vacuum treatment temperature is increased to 450 °C and 550 °C, the O2 evolution rates decline sharply and are even far lower than that of the pristine WO3. This suggests that the bulk phase oxygen vacancies severely inhibit the separation of photogenerated carriers and significantly reduce the photocatalytic activity. These results are in good agreement with the photoelectrochemical characterization, indicating that the separation of the photogenerated charges is the main factor that affects the photocatalytic performance of the WO3 semiconductor.

3.11 Photocatalytic mechanism of WO3−X
Generally, surface oxygen vacancies and low-valent ions, such as Ti3+ in TiO2 and W5+ in WO3, may lead to band gap narrowing.5,29,42 From the UV-vis and XPS spectra, the vacuum heat treatment at high temperature makes WO3 form oxygen vacancies and W5+. These defects narrow the band gap of WO3−X and enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, which leads to high photocatalytic activity. Based on the above studies and discussion, the mechanism of the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction is schematically suggested in Fig. 11. When the WO3−X semiconductor is illuminated by visible light whose energy is greater than the bandgap, electron (e−) and hole (h+) pairs are generated (eqn (4)). Some of the photogenerated electrons and holes recombine, and the others are transferred to the surface of the material under the driving force of photovoltage. Then the photogenerated electrons are trapped by the surface oxygen vacancy defects (eqn (5) and (6)). And then the trapped electrons are consumed by the surface adsorbed Ag+. Meanwhile, the holes oxidize the water molecules into oxygen (eqn (7) and (8)). The charges captured briefly by the surface oxygen vacancy defects are very easily transmitted to the reactant or sacrificial agent, so the surface oxygen vacancy defects are favourable for the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The whole process of O2 formation is summarized in eqn (9). WO3−X + hν → e− + h+(4) e− + h+ → recombination(5) e− + h+ → e−trap + h+trap(6) Ag+ + e−trap → Ag(7) 2H2O + h+trap → O2(g) + 4H+(8) (9)

4. Conclusions
To summarize, sub-stoichiometric WO3−X with different concentrations of surface oxygen vacancy defects were successfully prepared by evacuating WO3 at different temperatures. The treated WO3−X at 150–350 °C have more surface oxygen vacancies and exhibit higher photocurrent density and photocatalytic activity than the pristine WO3, while the treated WO3−X at 450 and 550 °C have more bulk defects that may inhibit the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and show lower photocurrent density and photocatalytic activity than the pristine WO3. This study demonstrates that surface oxygen vacancy defects not only broaden the visible light absorption range but also improve the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. This work reveals the effect of oxygen vacancies of WO3−X on the photocatalytic activity and provides theoretical guidance for the preparation of highly active WO3−X photocatalysts.
