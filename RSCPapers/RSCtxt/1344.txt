    , Accepted 14th July 2022First published on 14th July 2022AbstractLow-performance and instability severely limit photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting and organic synthesis of photoanodes. Electrolyte regulation as a facile and scalable route receives less attention, and always requires oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs). Herein, we report azide molecule mediated electrolyte regulation to achieve OEC-free selective PEC reactions over a BiVO4 (BVO) photoanode. pH-sensitive 5-aminotetrazolium (5AT) acts as not only a substrate for the PEC azo coupling reaction but also a “liquid phase cocatalyst” to substantially facilitate charge transfer at the photoanode-electrolyte interface. In 5AT/Na2SO4 electrolyte, the azo coupling reaction occurs at pH > 4, whereas the water splitting reaction takes place at pH < 4, and polyaniline passivated BVO (BVO-PANI) exhibits a photocurrent density of 4.22 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE with an onset potential of 0.34 VRHE and stable photocurrent density for 4 h. Meanwhile, 5AT as a “liquid phase cocatalyst” is universal for a variety of photoanodes, such as α-Fe2O3. Further, 5AT/NaVO3/Na2SO4 ternary electrolyte solution allows BVO-PANI to exhibit a photocurrent density of 5.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE with an onset potential of 0.27 VRHE and stable PEC performance for 10 h. This work opens up a new avenue of electrolyte regulation to promote PEC performance and stability of photoanodes.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting technology can effectively convert solar energy into green and sustainable hydrogen energy and is one of the most promising ways to obtain clean energy.1–5 The key to the development of PEC technology is to prepare highly efficient and stable photoelectrode materials to achieve high solar energy conversion efficiency. Since Honda first discovered in 1972 that TiO2 can be used as a photoanode to achieve overall water splitting,6 lots of metal oxides (such as ZnO, α-Fe2O3, WO3 and BiVO4 (BVO)) have been explored and used in PEC water splitting.7–11 BVO has a suitable band gap (2.4–2.5 eV), sufficient valence band (VB) position for water oxidation, and a large theoretical maximum photocurrent density (7.5 mA cm−2), making it one of the most promising photoanodes, and therefore, it has received extensive research attention.12–19 However, the pristine BVO undergoes severe recombination of bulk and interface photogenerated charges, which results in low photoelectric conversion efficiency and serious photocorrosion.16,20–22
In principle, the performance deprivation of BVO originates from the corrosive effect of photogenerated carriers on BVO, especially at the interface of a semiconductor and electrolyte.23–27 The introduction of oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs), such as NiOOH, FeOOH, CoPi and FeOOH/NiOOH, can greatly increase the transfer rate of photogenerated carriers at the interface and kinetically inhibit the corrosion of photogenerated holes, thus allowing BVO to exhibit excellent PEC performance and long-term stability.28–34 Coating an inert layer on the surface of BVO to prevent photogenerated carriers from directly reacting on the surface of BVO is also an effective means to improve the performance and stability of BVO. Chemically stable organic or inorganic semiconductor materials such as covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), polyaniline (PANI), TiO2 and ZnO have been used as the inert layer for decorating BVO and have attained outstanding passivation effects.35–38 Meanwhile, the inert layer can passivate the surface defects of the photoanode and inhibit the surface charge recombination, thereby promoting the charge transfer efficiency.
In addition to catalyst modification, electrolyte composition design has made great progress to improve the PEC performance and stability of BVO recently. Compared with the modification of photoelectrodes, the regulation of electrolyte composition is easier to realize and cost-effective. The anode photocorrosion can lead to the dissolution of V5+ in the BVO lattice, which makes the performance of BVO seriously deteriorate.23,39 In this regard, Lee et al. employed a V2O5 saturated electrolyte solution to inhibit the dissolution of V5+ in BVO, thereby greatly improving the stability of BVO decorated with OECs.23 There have been several research studies which report that adding NaVO3 into the electrolyte solution enabled the OEC-modified BVO photoanode to show high photostability.40,41 In addition, the long-term photostability was also achieved by the strategy of in situ regenerating the OECs on the surface of the BVO photoanode by adding Fe2+ into the electrolyte solution.30,39 Therefore, the design of electrolyte composition to promote photoanode performance and stability is of great significance for the practical application and development of PEC water splitting. However, so far, both the design of V5+-saturated electrolyte and the electrolyte modification strategy of catalyst regeneration require the participation of OECs. It is very challenging to develop an efficient strategy of electrolyte manipulation to accelerate the transfer of photogenerated carriers and enhance the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction in the absence of OECs.
5-Aminotetrazolium (5AT) can be used as a raw material to prepare a variety of high-energy materials with excellent properties. For example, sodium 5,5′-azotetrazolate (SZT) is an important industrial raw material and has a wide range of applications in the military and industrial fields42,43 and can be prepared from 5AT through a coupling reaction. There have been some reports on the preparation of SZT by a PEC reaction using 5AT as the organic substrate.44,45 In this work, we introduce 5AT in the electrolyte, which demonstrates a two-sided effect on the PEC reactions of BVO. On the one hand, 5AT can be used as an organic substrate for the PEC azo coupling reaction; on the other hand, the inhibition of the electrophilicity of the amino group in 5AT by decreasing the electrolyte pH (<4) makes it act as a “liquid phase co-catalyst” to promote the PEC water splitting performance of BVO. In 5AT/Na2SO4 solution, the photocurrent density of polyaniline passivated BVO (BVO-PANI) reaches 4.22 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE with an onset potential of 0.34 VRHE. In addition, both TiO2 and α-Fe2O3 photoanodes also show enhanced PEC performance in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution, suggesting the versatility of 5AT as a “liquid phase cocatalyst”. Furthermore, by adding NaVO3 to 5AT/Na2SO4 solution to form a three-component electrolyte system (5AT/NaVO3/Na2SO4), BVO-PANI finally acquires a photocurrent density of 5.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23VRHE with an onset potential of 0.27 VRHE and a stable photocurrent output within 10 h. The 5AT molecule acts as a “liquid phase co-catalyst” to accelerate the transfer of charges at the solid–liquid interface and improve the kinetics of water oxidation, while the addition of NaVO3 further advances the charge transfer; both in the electrolyte jointly promote the PEC performance and stability of photoanodes.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of BVO and BVO-PANI
First, 3.32 g of KI and 0.97 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O were added to 50 ml of deionized water and stirred for 30 minutes, and the pH of the mixed solution of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and KI was adjusted to 1.7 by adding a few drops of dilute HNO3 to form solution A. Then, 0.497 g of p-benzoquinone was dissolved in 20 ml of absolute ethanol to form solution B. Finally, solution A and solution B were mixed to form a precursor solution for preparing BiOI by electrodeposition. The BiOI precursor was prepared by electrodeposition in a three-electrode quartz cell by the constant potential method. In the preparation process, F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass was used as the working electrode, and the Ag/AgCl electrode and the platinum wire electrode are the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. BiOI was deposited on the FTO glass under a voltage of −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl for a deposition time of 300 s, and finally, brick red BiOI was formed. The prepared BiOI film was rinsed with deionized water and dried naturally. Next, 0.265 g of vanadyl acetylacetonate was dissolved in 2 ml of DMSO and then was uniformly coated on the surface of the BiOI film and sintered in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 2 h to obtain a BVO film. The BVO film needed to be soaked in 1 M NaOH solution for 30 minutes to remove excess V2O5. The finally obtained BVO film was rinsed with deionized water and dried naturally.
PANI was deposited on the BVO film using electrodeposition and photo-electrodeposition methods as above in the three-electrode system. First, 0.01 mol aniline was dissolved in 100 ml of water and sonicated for 30 minutes to form a uniform solution, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 3 with HCl and used as a deposition solution. The as-prepared BVO was used as the working electrode, the Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode, and the platinum wire was used as the counter electrode. During the deposition process, BVO was deposited under 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl and AM 1.5G illumination for 30 s, followed by electrodeposition at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 60 s. The prepared BVO-PANI photoelectrode was cleaned with deionized water and dried naturally.
2.2 Preparation of TiO2 and α-Fe2O3 photoanodes
TiO2 and α-Fe2O3 photoanodes were prepared by a hydrothermal method. 15 ml of deionized water, 15 ml of HCl and 0.5 ml of titanium tetrachloride were mixed into a uniform solution. FTO was placed in the above solution for the hydrothermal reaction at 150 °C for 12 h. The sample after the hydrothermal reaction was annealed at 450 °C for 2 h, and finally, the TiO2 photoanode was obtained. 25 ml of the solution containing 0.15 M FeCl3·6H2O and 1 M NaNO3 was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave with FTO glass and hydrothermally reacted at 100 °C for 12 h. The samples after the hydrothermal reaction were washed and annealed at 550 °C for 2 h to obtain the α-Fe2O3 photoanode.
2.3 Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) was employed to resolve the phase structure of the photoanodes. The morphology and structure of the photoanodes were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI NOVA NANOSEM 650). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and associated energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) images were acquired on a JEM-2100 (JEOL, Japan). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of these photoanodes were measured with a Cary 5000 (America Varian) spectrophotometer. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the reaction solution was collected on a spectrophotometer. The changes of the electrolyte solution before and after the reaction were detected on a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a C18 chromatographic column (Thermo-Fisher, Ultimate 3000). The specific test conditions are as follows: the wavelength of the UV detector is 230 nm, the mobile phase is acetonitrile and water (6:4), and the flow rate is 0.8 ml min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo-Fisher photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi).
2.4 Photoelectrochemical testing
The photoelectrochemical water splitting test was carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E) equipped with three electrodes. There are four electrolytes with different pH values: Na2SO4 (0.1 M, pH = 6.8), 5AT/Na2SO4 (0.1 M/0.1 M, pH = 3.2), NaVO3/Na2SO4 (0.1 M/0.1 M, pH = 2.4), and 5AT/NaVO3/Na2SO4 (0.1 M/0.1 M/0.1 M, pH = 2.4). A 300 W xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter was used as the radiation source, and an optical power meter was employed to determine the position from the light source to the surface of the sample where the light intensity was 100 mw cm−2. The photocurrent density–potential (J–V) curves were measured by scanning with a continuous voltage change at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The measured potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) according to the Nernst equation: (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.1976), where EAg/AgCl is the applied potential vs. Ag/AgCl and 0.1976 V is the standard potential of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode at 25 °C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed at 1.23 V vs. RHE, and the frequency range is from 105 to 10−1 Hz. The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) can be calculated using the following equation: (1)where J is the photocurrent density, V represents the applied bias voltage, and P is the light intensity of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). The charge injection efficiency (ηinj) was calculated by using the equation ηinj = JH2O/JNa2SO3, where JH2O and JNa2SO3 represent the photocurrent density of the photoelectrode with and without 0.1 M Na2SO3 in several different electrolytes, respectively. The charge separation efficiency (ηsep) can be calculated using the equation ηsep = JNa2SO3/Jabs, where Jabs represents the photocurrent density value that completely converts the photons absorbed by the electrode into current, which could be obtained by integrating the overlapping portion of the standard solar spectrum and the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the photoelectrode (Fig. S4†).46 The actual H2 and O2 production tests were carried out in a closed three-electrode PEC cell, and the electrolyte was 5AT/Na2SO4 solution, and the photoanode was BVO. Before the start of the PEC reaction, argon was continuously injected into the closed PEC cell for 30 min to exclude other gases. After the reaction started, a certain amount of gas was drawn from the closed PEC cell and injected into a gas chromatograph (GC 7900, Tianmei, Shanghai, argon carrier gas) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) every 30 minutes to detect the generated amounts of H2 and O2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structural characterization
In the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of BVO and BVO-PANI (Fig. S1†), all other peaks correspond to the monoclinic BVO (JCPDS #14-0688) except for the characteristic peak of SnO2 of FTO, indicating the amorphous structure of PANI. The microstructure and morphology of the prepared photoanode were carefully observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1a, pure BVO with a smooth surface structure is composed of interlaced narrow and long nanoparticles with a width of about 100 nm and a length between 300 nm and 500 nm. The BVO decorated with PANI shows a rougher surface and a thin film at the edge of the nanoparticles (Fig. 1b), which means that the PANI covered the surface of BVO. From the TEM image of BVO-PANI (Fig. 1c), it is clear that the thinner amorphous structure at the edge is PANI, which originates from its low crystallinity, while the regular black area (thicker part) is BVO. Furthermore, both the (040) plane of BVO and the amorphous structure of PANI are observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of BVO-PANI (Fig. S2†). The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping of BVO-PANI in Fig. 1d exhibits the signals of Bi, O, V, C and N elements, of which the five elements are uniformly distributed, demonstrating that the PANI film is uniformly distributed on the surface of BVO.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to probe the surface state and chemical composition of BVO-PANI. The elements in the XPS survey spectra (Fig. S3a†), including Bi, V, C and N, are all derived from the surface of BVO-PANI. As shown in Fig. S3b and c,† the characteristic peak pairs at 158.9 eV, 164.1 eV, 516.9 eV and 524.5 eV are assigned to Bi 4f7/2, Bi 4f5/2, V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2,47,48 respectively, suggesting the presence of Bi3+ and V5+ in BVO-PANI. The fine spectrum of C 1s comes from PANI and is deconvoluted into two peaks at 284.7 eV and 285.8 eV corresponding to C–C/C–H and C–N+/C–N+/CC, respectively (Fig. S3d†).49 Meanwhile, the two characteristic peaks of N 1s at 399.5 eV and 400.7 eV belong to imine nitrogen (–N) and amine nitrogen (–NH) of PANI, respectively (Fig. S3e†).50
3.2 PEC azo coupling and water splitting reactions
In our experiments, 5AT/Na2SO4 (pH = 3.2) is used as the basic electrolyte solution, and 0.1 M dilute H2SO4 and 0.1 M NaOH are used to tune the pH of electrolyte solutions (pH = 2, 4, 5 and 6). The PEC reaction is explored in these electrolyte solutions with different pHs using BVO as the photoanode. As shown in Fig. 2a, the onset potentials of the J–V curves of BVO in electrolyte solutions of different pHs are concentrated between 0.28 and 0.4 VRHE, and the photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE is 3.6 ± 0.4 mA cm−2. The onset potential and the photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE of BVO in electrolyte solutions with different pHs are recorded in Table S1.† From the J–t curves of BVO in different electrolyte solutions for 4 h (Fig. 2b), the deterioration of the photocurrent densities of BVO in the electrolytes of pH = 2, 3.2 and 4 is weak, and the photocurrent density after 4 h is maintained at about 2.7 mA cm−2, while the photocurrent density of BVO in the electrolytes of pH = 5 and 6 shows a large fading and drops to 2 and 1 mA cm−2 after 4 h, respectively. From the UV-vis absorption spectra of the electrolyte solutions at pH = 2, 3.2 and 4 before and after the reaction (Fig. 2c, S5a and b†), it is clear that there is no absorption peak at 420 nm. In contrast, obvious absorption peaks appear at 420 nm in the electrolytes of pH = 5 and 6 after the reaction (Fig. S5c †and 2d), and the absorption intensity gradually increases with time. In addition, it can be clearly seen that the electrolyte with pH = 3.2 before and after the reaction is a transparent and uniform solution (Fig. 2c), while the electrolyte at pH = 6 turns into a deep yellow solution after the reaction (Fig. 2d). The absorption peak at 420 nm and the color change of the solution suggest that SZT is generated by the PEC azo reaction in the electrolytes at pH = 5 and 6, but no PEC azo reaction occurs in the electrolytes at pH = 2, 3.2 and 4. In addition, the light absorption intensity of the electrolyte at pH = 5 after 4 h is greater than that of the electrolyte at pH = 6 after 4 h, which means that more SZT is generated at pH = 6, and the increase of pH is helpful for the PEC azo reaction. Correspondingly, the decrease of the photocurrent density of BVO in the pH = 6 electrolyte is much larger than that in the pH = 5 electrolyte, which is also because more 5AT is consumed by the coupling reaction at pH = 6. The above results suggest that the azo reaction can be inhibited by adjusting the pH of the electrolyte. From the perspective of the reaction process, the key to this azo reaction lies in the formation of the azo-NN-group, while amino dehydrogenation needs to occur in the reaction solution of pH > 4, because –NH2 will be protonated in an acidic solution (pH < 4), and the amino group changes from an electron-donating group to an electrophilic group and completely inhibits the progress of the azo coupling reaction. Further, we used liquid chromatography to explore the changes of 5AT in electrolytes with different pHs. As shown in Fig. S6a and b,† the peaks before and after the reaction of the electrolyte with pH = 3.2 hardly changed, which indicates that 5AT can exist stably in this electrolyte. Notably, the peak shape in the liquid chromatogram before and after the reaction at pH = 6 changes significantly; in particular, a new peak appears at 3.2 min, and the peak gradually increases with time, which is attributed to the SZT generation. The results of liquid chromatography demonstrate that the PEC azo coupling reaction occurs due to BVO in the electrolyte of pH = 6, while the PEC water splitting occurs in the electrolyte of pH = 3.2 due to the stable existence of 5AT. Finally, combined with the results of liquid chromatography and the UV-vis absorption spectrum, it is discovered that the pH of the turning point of the different PEC reactions in the 5AT/Na2SO4 electrolyte is 4, that is, the azo coupling reaction occurs when the pH of the electrolyte is larger than 4 (Fig. 2e), and the water splitting reaction occurs when the pH of the electrolyte is less than 4 (Fig. 2f).

3.3 Electrolyte composition regulation to promote PEC water splitting
Following the above experimental results, we further explore the PEC water splitting performance of BVO and BVO-PANI in Na2SO4 (pH = 6.8) and 5AT/Na2SO4 (pH = 3.2) electrolyte solutions. As shown in Fig. 3a, BVO and BVO-PANI have similar onset potentials in Na2SO4 electrolyte solution (∼0.6 VRHE), and the photocurrent densities at 1.23 VRHE are 1.23 and 1.51 mA cm−2, respectively. In contrast, the onset potentials of BVO and BVO-PANI decrease to ∼0.35 VRHE, and their photocurrent densities in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution at 1.23 VRHE reach 3.61 and 4.22 mA cm−2, respectively. It is clear that the addition of 5AT acts as a “liquid-phase cocatalyst” by improving the weaker water oxidation kinetics of BVO and BVO-PANI in Na2SO4 solution. The photoconversion efficiency of the photoelectrode under different bias voltages can be obtained by calculating ABPE, which is an important basis for evaluating the PEC performance of photoanodes. The optimal photoconversion efficiencies of BVO and BVO-PANI in Na2SO4 solution are only 0.15 and 0.16% at about 0.95 VRHE, respectively. In 5AT/Na2SO4 solution, the ABPE of BVO and BVO-PANI (Fig. 3b) increases to 0.88 and 1.01% at around 0.76 VRHE, respectively, demonstrating that this electrolyte modification method is beneficial to the improvement of the photoconversion efficiency of these photoanodes. Electrochemical impedance spectra are used to investigate the kinetics of charge transfer at the photoanode's interface. As shown in Fig. 3c, BVO and BVO-PANI have smaller arc radii in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution than in Na2SO4 solution, and the further fitting results (Table S2†) show that the interfacial charge transfer resistance values of BVO and BVO-PANI in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution are 116.8 Ω and 101.5 Ω, while those in Na2SO4 solution are 178.7 Ω and 169.1 Ω, revealing that 5AT in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution can accelerate the transfer of interface charges. Furthermore, charge separation efficiency and charge injection efficiency of BVO and BVO-PANI in different electrolytes are calculated by obtaining the sulfite oxidation J–V curves of BVO and BVO-PANI with Na2SO3 as the hole sacrificial agent (Fig. S7†). The charge separation efficiencies of BVO and BVO-PANI are 58.5% and 62.4% in Na2SO4 solution and 63.9% and 64.7% in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution, respectively (Fig. 3d). The small difference indicates that the addition of 5AT has little effect on the charge separation efficiency of the photoanode. However, the charge injection efficiencies of BVO and BVO-PANI in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution reach 79.5% and 91.1% at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively, which are much higher than those of BVO (29.8%) and BVO-PANI (33.7%) in Na2SO4 solution (Fig. 3e). The charge injection efficiency echoes the EIS test results, revealing that 5AT promotes the transfer of interfacial charges, which is the main reason for the improved performance of BVO and BVO-PANI in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution.

(a) J–V curves, (b) ABPE curves, (c) electrochemical impedance spectra (at 1.23 VRHE, AM 1.5G irradiation), (d) charge separation efficiency, (e) charge injection efficiency and (f) J–t curves at 1.23 VRHE for 4 h. 

Fig. 3f shows the J–t curves of BVO and BVO-PANI in two electrolytes at 1.23 VRHE for 4 h. In Na2SO4 solution, due to the sluggish kinetics of interfacial charge, the photogenerated holes cause severe photocorrosion of BVO, and its photocurrent density decays by 55.3% within 4 h. Benefiting from the passivation effect of PANI, the PEC performance of BVO-PANI in Na2SO4 solution is relatively less attenuated, and the photocurrent density decreases by 28.5%. In contrast, BVO and BVO-PANI not only have high photocurrent density but also maintain relatively stable PEC performance in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution, and the photocurrent density only drops by 24.5% and 11.5% for BVO and BVO-PANI after 4 h, respectively. This demonstrates that the introduction of 5AT largely improves the stability of the BVO-based photoanode. The existence of 5AT in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution accelerates the kinetics of the photoanode interface charge, which enables most of the photogenerated carriers to participate in PEC water oxidation, thus greatly inhibiting the corrosion of the photoanode by photogenerated holes for improving the stability of the photoanode. In addition, in order to exclude the effect of electrolyte's pH on PEC water splitting and further confirm the promoting effect of 5AT, the J–V and J–t curves of the BVO photoanode in Na2SO4 with pH = 3.2 (dilute H2SO4 acidification) are evaluated (Fig. S8a and b†). The photocurrent density of BVO in Na2SO4 solution is 1.34 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, and the photocurrent density decreased by 51.0% within 4 h, which is similar to the performance of BVO in Na2SO4 electrolyte with pH = 6.8. This result indicates that only changing the pH of the electrolyte has a negligible effect on the performance of the photoanode. Further, we test the actual H2 and O2 production of BVO in 5AT/Na2SO4 electrolyte, as shown in Fig. S9,† and the amounts of H2 and O2 produced by BVO after 2 h are 124.06 μmol cm−2 and 62.48 μmol cm−2, respectively, which approximately correspond to the theoretical ratio of H2 and O2 (2:1) produced by water splitting. The faradaic efficiency of O2 generation after the reaction of BVO in 5AT/Na2SO4 for 2 h is 96.3%, indicating that most of the photogenerated holes are involved in the PEC water oxidation, which also shows that 5AT exists stably in the electrolyte. In order to explore the universality of the current electrolyte modification for PEC improvement, the PEC performance of TiO2 and α-Fe2O3 photoanodes in Na2SO4 and 5AT/Na2SO4 electrolytes is investigated (Fig. S10a and b†). Through the introduction of 5AT in the electrolyte, the photocurrent density of TiO2 increases from 0.8 to 1.22 mA cm−2 (Fig. S10c†), and the photocurrent density of α-Fe2O3 increases by 8.3 times (from 0.16 to 1.15 mA cm−2) (Fig. S10d†), which illustrate that this strategy is universal and applicable to a variety of photoanodes.
Photocorrosion often leads to the dissolution of V5+ ions from the crystal structure of BVO, which is the main reason for the gradual decline of its performance during PEC water splitting. It has been reported that adding NaVO3 or V2O5 to the electrolyte can provide a saturated V5+ environment for the BVO photoanode to inhibit the dissolution of V5+, thus achieving improved stability of the BVO photoanode. Thus, 0.1 M NaVO3 is added to 5AT/Na2SO4 solution to prepare a ternary electrolyte. Note that the pH of the 5AT/NaVO3/Na2SO4 electrolyte is 2.4, which satisfies the conditions for protonation of the amino group of 5AT to ensure that PEC water splitting takes place in the electrolyte. Surprisingly, the performance of BVO and BVO-PANI is further improved in the 5AT/NaVO3/Na2SO4 electrolyte, and their onset potential decreases to around 0.27 VRHE, and the photocurrent densities reach 4.95 and 5.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, respectively (Fig. 4a). It should be noted that the performance of BVO-PANI in 5AT/NaVO3/Na2SO4 electrolyte is still among the best for photoanodes with electrolyte composition adjustment even if they are equipped with OECs (Table S3†). After 10 h of J–t test (Fig. 4b), the photocurrent densities of BVO and BVO-PANI decrease by 13.7% and 29.0%, respectively, indicating that the environment of saturated V5+ does improve the stability of BVO and BVO-PANI photoanodes. At around 0.71VRHE, BVO and BVO-PANI show the highest ABPE of 1.15% and 1.26%, respectively (Fig. S11†). Further, the charge separation efficiency and charge injection efficiency of BVO and BVO-PANI in the 5AT/NaVO3/Na2SO4 electrolyte solution are calculated (Fig. S12†). The charge separation efficiencies of BVO and BVO-PANI in the ternary electrolyte solution attain 75.5% and 74.5% at 1.23 VRHE, respectively, which is about 10% higher than that in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, the charge injection efficiencies of BVO and BVO-PANI in the ternary electrolyte reach 92.6% and 95.1% at 1.23 VRHE, respectively, which are 13.1% and 4.0% higher than those in 5AT/Na2SO4 solution, respectively (Fig. 4d). Obviously, the further increase in charge separation and injection efficiencies is responsible for the improved PEC performance of BVO and BVO-PANI in 5AT/NaVO3/Na2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, the photocurrent density of BVO in NaVO3/Na2SO4 solution at 1.23 VRHE is only 2.60 mA cm−2 (Fig. S13†), which is far inferior to the PEC performance in 5AT/Na2SO4 and 5AT/NaVO3/Na2SO4 solutions, revealing the irreplaceability of 5AT.

3.4 Mechanism analysis
Based on the above results, we propose a possible mechanism to illustrate the high performance and stability of BVO-PANI photoanodes in 5AT/NaVO3/Na2SO4 ternary electrolyte solutions (Fig. 5). First, the protonated 5AT acts as a “liquid phase co-catalyst”, which lowers the barrier for photogenerated holes to inject into the electrolyte and enhance the kinetics of interfacial charges. Second, the addition of NaVO3 additionally promotes the separation of photogenerated charges (both bulk and interface) and creates an environment saturated V5+, which further enhances the PEC performance and stability of the photoanode. Finally, PANI acts as a passivation layer to avoid direct corrosion of the photoanode by photogenerated holes. The above advantageous factors collectively contribute to the considerable improvement of PEC performance and stability of BVO.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we developed a facile method for the regulation of electrolyte composition and achieved high PEC performance and stability of BVO and BVO-PANI. The ingenious use of the molecular structure of 5AT realizes its role as a “liquid phase cocatalyst”, enabling BVO-PANI to achieve a performance of 4.22 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and maintain a relatively stable performance for 4 h. Furthermore, we find that the 5AT molecule is universal as a liquid-phase cocatalyst with a gain in PEC performance for other photoanodes. In view of the defect that the BVO photoanode is easy to dissolve V5+ ions, which leads to its performance degradation, NaVO3 is further added to 5AT/Na2SO4, forming the ternary electrolyte solution. Finally, BVO-PANI obtains a photocurrent of 5.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE in the ternary electrolyte solution and maintains excellent PEC performance for 10 h. Compared with the complex photoanode design, the control of electrolyte composition to achieve high performance of BVO is undoubtedly a simpler and more effective strategy. This work undoubtedly provides a new insight for the regulation of electrolyte composition to improve the performance and stability of photoanodes.
