    , Accepted 29th August 2019First published on 31st August 2019AbstractHalide perovskites are a family of semiconductor materials demonstrating prospective properties for optical cooling owing to efficient luminescence at room temperature and strong electron–phonon interaction. Moreover, perovskite based nanophotonic designs would allow for efficient optical cooling at the nanoscale. Here, we propose a novel strategy for the enhancement of optical cooling at the nanoscale based on optical resonance engineering in halide perovskite nanoparticles. Namely, the photoluminescence up-conversion efficiency in a nanoparticle is optimized via excitation of Mie-resonances both at emission and absorption wavelengths. The optimized theoretical photo-induced temperature decrease achieved for a hybrid halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) 530 nm nanoparticle on a glass substrate is more than 100 K under CW illumination at wavelength 980 nm and moderate intensities (∼7 × 106 W cm−2). The optimized regime originates from simultaneous excitation of a magnetic quadrupole and a magnetic octupole at pump and emission wavelengths, respectively. The combination of a thermally sensitive photoluminescence signal and simplicity in the fabrication of a halide perovskite nanocavity will pave the way for implementation of nanoscale optical coolers for advanced applications.
1. Introduction
Halide organometal perovskite materials have attracted a lot of attention owing to their outstanding photovoltaic properties and performance.1 Indeed, halide perovskite-based single-junction solar cells have demonstrated an increase of efficiency from 3.8% (ref. 2) to over 21% (ref. 3 and 4) in under a 10 year period. The efficiency and performance of perovskite based light-emitting devices are also rapidly growing,5 which make them prospective for applications in displays. However, halide perovskites suffer from a relatively low thermal conductivity,6 which results in the overheating of devices and might strongly affect their applicability. Thus, finding a way for efficient cooling of perovskite active layers in devices would overcome a number of technological limitations.
One of the possible solutions is optical cooling, when absorption of a photon with energy lower than that of the emitted one (so-called up-conversion) results in the absorption of an additional phonon for energy conservation. A low trap-state density7 and a high photoluminescence quantum yield,8 as well as pronounced excitonic states at room temperature in bulk halide perovskites resulted in a high efficiency of up-conversion, and, thus, in the decrease of the local temperature by 20 K upon laser irradiation.9 Further optimization of the optical cooling requires both an enhanced quantum yield of emission and improved absorption of incident light in the material. Therefore, nanophotonic structures with optical resonances can be beneficial in terms of optical cooling. The perovskites also have a fairly high refractive index (2.0–2.5), therefore showing promise for use in nanophotonic applications due to the ability of a single dielectric resonant nanoparticle (NP) to achieve a strong optical response and light localization,10 whereas the excitation of resonances in the nanocavities results in a sufficient enhancement of the emission rate.11 The combination of nanophotonic designs12 with a variety of functional properties of halide perovskites13 has already demonstrated great performance in boosting the photoluminescence efficiency from metasurfaces,14–18 tunability of luminescence19 and optical resonances,20,21 and outstanding properties of micro- and nanolasers.7,22–24
In this work, we theoretically propose enhanced optical cooling in a resonant perovskite MAPbI3 (MA stands for methylammonium – CH3NH3) NP. By supporting resonant optical modes both at pump and emission wavelengths, allowing absorption and radiation efficiency via the Purcell effect to be significantly enhanced, the NP demonstrates outstanding performance in laser cooling. As a result, the ability to maintain multiple high-order optical Mie resonances and simple fabrication processes12 for the studied material will pave the way for a new generation of highly efficient nanoscale cooling devices.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the mechanism of optical cooling of a perovskite NP supporting optical resonances both for absorbed and emitted photons.

The considered approach of laser cooling via phonon up-conversion photoluminescence25–29 consists of three main steps: (i) absorption of the incident pump, (ii) generation of the carriers, and (iii) emission. Since (ii) is mostly governed by the material and its properties, which was taken to be the same for bulk and NPs in this work, (i) and (iii) can be significantly enhanced by Mie-resonances and the Purcell factor11 in the NP, respectively, thus improving the cooling efficiency in total.
Photocarrier generation
The total carrier concentration at laser irradiation is given by a summation of equilibrium (n0 for n-type and p0 for p-type) and photogenerated (Δn and Δp) carrier concentrations: n = n0 + Δn(1) p = p0 + Δp.(2)
The radiation recombination rate (Rrad) per unit time and per unit volume is proportional to the product of electron and hole concentrations as follows:30 Rrad = −Bnp = B(n0 + Δn)(p0 + Δp)(3)where B is the bimolecular recombination coefficient. For lead halide perovskites, the photogenerated carrier concentration is larger than the equilibrium carrier concentration,7i.e. Δn ≫ (n0 + p0). In this case, the recombination rate can be evaluated as: Rrad = BN2,(4)where N = Δn = Δp is the laser induced electron–hole carrier density.
For non-radiative recombination, two processes occur: trap-assisted recombination and Auger recombination. The non-radiation recombination rate (Rnonrad) for this case is given by:30 Rnonrad = AN + CN3,(5)where A is the monomolecular recombination coefficient and C is the trimolecular recombination coefficient. Here, we don't take into account surface non-radiative recombination for simplicity. In halide perovskite films and nanograins, this value is not larger than that of monomolecular recombination governed by carrier trapping on the bulk defects.31 Estimation of the contribution of this recombination effect is shown in ESI Part VII.† Also, we make a realistic assumption that one fraction of luminescence immediately escapes the material, but the remaining fraction causes the reexcitation of electron–hole pairs and is reemitted subsequently. This is known as the photon recycling effect, which is the case for the MAPbI3 material.8
For steady-state conditions with continuum wave (CW) illumination at a given temperature, the laser induced electron–hole carrier density in the bulk material is obtained from the following equation:27–29 (6)where I is the laser intensity, ωi is the frequency of incident light, and α is the absorption coefficient. Therefore, we propose that the cooling could be significantly increased by enhancing the absorption term via Mie-resonances in a single nanocavity and increasing the radiation recombination term by boosting the spontaneous emission rate (BN2 term).
Absorption
The optical response and resonant properties of a nanocavity strongly depend on its permittivity. Since the considered wavelength region for photoluminescence upconversion is below the band gap energy of the MAPbI3 perovskite, the dispersion law for the dielectric permittivity ε(ω) of materials with an excitonic contribution can be given by the standard formula: (7)where ωexc is the central frequency of excitonic transition, f is the strength of a dipole oscillator, γ is the damping factor, and ε0 is the background dielectric constant. For MAPbI3 in this work, the parameter values were taken as follows:12ε0 = 6.1, γ = 0.076 eV, ωexc = 1.68 eV, and f = 0.02 (for more details, see ESI Part I†).
The normalized absorption cross-section σabs for spherical NPs is linked with the extinction and scattering cross-sections σabs = σext − σsca, where σext and σsca, according to the Mie-theory32 with the permittivity taken from eqn (7), were calculated for different diameters of the NPs and excitation wavelengths (for details, see ESI Part II†). The results of the calculation are shown in Fig. 2a. Three pronounced peaks are observed in the absorption spectra which correspond to magnetic-type modes, namely the magnetic dipole (MD) with λ/D = 2.67, the magnetic quadrupole (MQ) with λ/D = 1.85 and the magnetic octupole (MO) with λ/D = 1.43, where λ is the wavelength in a vacuum and D is the NP diameter. Thereby, the enhanced absorption by a single NP is directly related to the number of photogenerated carriers as shown in eqn (6).

(b) Analytically calculated Purcell factor for a spherical MAPbI3 NP of different diameters at emission wavelength λPL 770 nm with distinguished contribution from MD, MQ, and MO, as well as from other spectrally broad Mie modes. 
Emission rate
Another key parameter for optical cooling is the quantum efficiency η of emission from the material or nanostructure. Generally, from eqn (6), one can derive it as follows: (8)
The external quantum efficiency from a perovskite film is much lower than the internal one, because emitted light cannot escape the film with respect to the normal of the surface to surface owing to the strong reflection and re-absorption.8 One of the straightforward strategies for external quantum efficiency improvement is the enhancement of light scattering improving the probability of emission outcoupling.33
On the other hand, the luminescence quantum efficiency can be enhanced via the acceleration of spontaneous emission in a cavity τcav = 1/Rcavrad as compared with that in a homogeneous medium τ0 = 1/Rrad due to the Purcell effect determined as Fp = Rcavred/Rrad.11
For example, it was shown that for electric dipole transition in a dielectric spherical NP, the average emission rate acceleration can be calculated as described by Chew,34 which can be used in the case of relatively low losses,35 and was successfully applied for perovskites previously.17 Taking into account the Purcell effect, eqn (8) can be modified as follows: (9)
The results for the calculation of emission rate enhancement or the Purcell factor for MAPbI3 NPs at wavelength λ = 770 nm, which corresponds to the material fundamental photoluminescence wavelength λPL, are shown in Fig. 2b (see ESI Part III† for details regarding the calculations). Mode decomposition of the MAPbI3 NP emission rate demonstrates the dominance of the magnetic-type Mie modes similar to the absorption cross-section. The pronounced peaks correspond to the contributions of MD resonance with an approximate diameter D = 283 nm, MQ with diameter D = 410 nm and MO with diameter D = 530 nm at the emission wavelength. The contributing Mie-modes of electric type have much lower Q-factors, and, thus, they are not shown in Fig. 2b.
Optical cooling in air: an analytical study
The ability of nanostructures to support optical cooling is governed by the cooling ratio, which was introduced by M. Sheik-Bahae et al.27 as follows: (10)where ωPL is the PL frequency.
There are two ways to enhance optical cooling as it follows from eqn (10). Firstly, one can increase the external radiative quantum efficiency via decreasing the radiation lifetime. As shown in Fig. 2b, the emission rate undergoes a strong resonant enhancement at MD, MQ and MO modes. Secondly, one can decrease the frequency of the absorbed light by applying the pump sources in the near-IR. As shown in Fig. 2a, the resonant NP can still effectively absorb light in the near-IR at the red wing of the excitonic state. A balance of these two effects determines the NP cooling efficiency.
For a single NP, the kinetic eqn (6) is modified by taking into account a radiative recombination term and the Mie-enhanced absorption: (11)where σabs is the absorption cross section and V is the volume of the NP. Solving eqn (11) for a given nanosphere diameter and wavelength of the excitation gives the value of the light induced electron–hole carrier density N.
The cooling efficiency ηc is determined by the ratio of the cooling power (Plum − Pabs) and absorbed power (Pabs):36 (12)where the recombination constants (A = 1.4 × 107 s−1, B = 9.2 × 10−10 cm3 s−1, C = 1.3 × 10−28 cm6 s−1) were taken from elsewhere.37
In order to determine the temperature change of the NP under laser illumination, one should consider the stationary heat transfer equation and take into account only the radial heat distribution: (13)where κ is the thermal conductivity. Since the thermal conductivity of MAPbI36 is much larger than that of the surrounding air medium,38 the temperature distribution inside the NP can be considered as homogeneous. The expression for temperature variance inside the NP can be found by solving eqn (13) and appears to be as follows (for details, see ESI Part V†): (14)where κair = 0.022 W m−1 K−1 is the thermal conductivity of the air medium.

Fig. 3 shows the temperature for different diameters of MAPbI3 NPs and excitation wavelengths at a moderate laser intensity I = 5 × 105 W cm−2 calculated with eqn (14), where the black dashed lines correspond to the optical modes supported by the sphere at the emission wavelength and the gray dashed lines correspond to the optical modes excited in the absorption cross sections. The maximum values of laser cooling are observed at a diameter around D = 530 nm and a pump wavelength λ = 980 nm. This matches perfectly with the predictions above. Indeed, an NP of diameter D = 530 nm supports MO resonance at the fundamental MAPbI3 photoluminescence wavelength λPL, thus enhancing the emission rate, as shown in Fig. 2. Meanwhile, the very same NP possesses MQ resonance nearly the same as the excitation wavelength (λ = 980 nm). Such a bi-resonant case of magnetic modes ‘interaction’ at emission and absorption demonstrates that the temperatures decrease down to the lowest values possible. Thus, we reveal that the strongest temperature decrease is achieved when the nanosphere supports one optical mode at the absorption (incident light) wavelength and the other optical mode at the emission (photoluminescence) wavelength, but both of them are of magnetic nature. According to our simulations, the cooling of larger NPs (D > 600 nm) is possible, but the value of temperature change is less than that for the most optimal case (D = 530 nm).

The temperature of the spherical MAPbI3 NP with different diameters and pump wavelengths λ carried out analytically for intensity I = 5 × 105 W cm−2 in homogeneous air media using eqn (14). The black dashed lines depict modes supported by the NP at emission wavelength λPL = 770 nm and the gray dashed lines show the excited modes in absorption. 
It is worth noting that such kind of bi-resonant enhancement was also actively employed previously for harmonics generation both in subwavelength plasmonic39,40 and semiconductor41,42 NPs supporting Mie-resonances at fundamental and second-harmonic frequencies.
Optical cooling on glass: a numerical study
In order to prove the possibility of experimental observation of such bi-resonant optical cooling, a numerical model was constructed for plane wave irradiation of a single MAPbI3 NP on a glass substrate (see ESI Part VIII† for more details). Fig. 4a shows the numerical calculation of the normalized absorption cross-section for two wavelengths: 770 nm is the emission wavelength (blue solid line) and 980 nm is the pump wavelength (red dashed line) for an MAPbI3 nanosphere with different diameters. The optical properties such as extinction or absorption cross-sections of the NP are not changed significantly with the presence of the glass substrate under the NP43,44 as well as the spectral position of the resonances. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4, the resonant response remains unchanged at the same diameter D = 530 nm as is shown with analytical calculations in Fig. 3. Also, the numerically calculated electric field distributions for the wavelength of luminescence and pump reveal the strong field localization at the given wavelengths (Fig. 4b).
 Fig. 4  Optical properties of a perovskite NP on a glass substrate. (a) Numerical calculation of the absorption cross section of MAPbI3 NPs on a glass substrate at pump (red dashed curve) and emission (blue solid curve) wavelengths. (b) Numerical calculation of the electromagnetic field distribution of a 530 nm diameter NP at 770 nm and 980 nm wavelengths. 
Since the previous experimental studies revealed a negligible influence of the glass substrate on the Purcell factor of light-emitting dielectric nanoantennas,17,45 we assume that the Purcell factor can be taken from the analytical solution for simplicity. For instance, an emission rate of 530 nm MAPbI3 NPs at wavelength λ = 770 nm is Fairp = 2.9, as it follows from Fig. 2, whereas for the same nanosphere in a homogeneous glass medium with refractive index 1.45 it is Fglassp = 2.17 (for details, see ESI Part IV†); thus, we believe that the presence of a glass substrate from a single bottom side does not significantly affect the resulting emission rate.
According to eqn (14), higher laser intensity at given wavelength and NP parameters leads to the enhanced cooling effect. For example, the most optimal design of MAPbI3 NPs (D = 530 nm) yields the lowest temperature (ΔT ≈ −110 K) at laser intensity I = 7 × 106 W cm−2 (Fig. 5a). As shown in Fig. S3a in the ESI,† this intensity corresponds to the photogenerated carrier density N = 3 × 1018 cm−3, where the quantum efficiency of luminescence η exceeds 86% level (see Fig. S3b†). At higher intensities, the quantum efficiency decreases owing to an increase in the Auger recombination rate, resulting in a rapid temperature growth. The intensities lower than I = 7 × 106 W cm−2 can correspond to an even slightly better quantum efficiency, but the temperature change directly depends on the incident intensity according to eqn (14).

(a) The dependence of temperature change for a 530 nm MAPbI3 NP (blue solid line) and a 340 nm GaAs NP (red dashed line) on a substrate on laser intensity at wavelength λ = 980 nm. (b) The dependence of temperature change for an MAPbI3 NP on a substrate on its diameter upon illumination by a laser with intensity 7 × 106 W cm−2 and wavelength λ = 980 nm. (c) Temperature distributions for a 530 nm MAPbI3 NP under 980 nm laser illumination with 7 × 106 W cm−2 intensity and 340 nm GaAs NP under laser illumination with the same wavelength and 106 W cm−2 intensity. 
In order to prove that the diameter D = 530 nm of the nanosphere provides the most optimal condition, the dependence of temperature on the NP size (Fig. 5b) was analyzed numerically. Indeed, the best cooling from the room temperature of ΔT ≈ −110 K can be achieved for diameter D = 530 nm, where both the Purcell effect and absorption cross section at magnetic octupole and quadrupole, respectively, are contributed considerably. The steady-state temperature distribution for the MAPbI3 nanosphere with 530 nm diameter at 980 nm wavelength excitation with an intensity of I = 7 × 106 W cm−2 and emission at λ = 770 nm is shown in the upper part of Fig. 5c. Mostly, the temperature distribution appears to be homogeneous, whereas some temperature gradient occurs in the area of contact with the glass substrate.
Comparison
The developed numerical model allows us to directly compare the cooling efficiency for the NP and thin film of the same material. For example, we adopted the parameters from the experimental work on the optical cooling of the MAPbI3 film.9 Our calculations predict a temperature change of ΔT ≈ −16 K for the film (for details, see ESI Part X†), which is close to the experimentally measured values around 23 K. Remarkably, this is a much weaker cooling as compared with that for the MAPbI3 NP ΔT ≈ −110 K, confirming the importance of Mie resonances.
In order to compare the obtained results with those of the other materials, let's consider an NP made of another prospective material for optical cooling. Although net cooling has primarily been demonstrated in a Yb3+-doped fluoride glass,46 the laser cooling of direct-bandgap semiconductors, for example gallium arsenide (GaAs), is more appealing because semiconductors allow for more efficient light absorption, much lower achievable cooling temperatures and direct integrability into electronic and photonic devices.47,48 The lower part of Fig. 5c shows the temperature distribution for the GaAs nanosphere upon laser irradiation with intensity I = 106 W cm−2. However, the GaAs nanosphere with diameter 340 nm, supporting the MQ optical resonant mode at emission wavelength with a high Purcell factor, does not undergo any cooling (for more details, see ESI Part IX†). This happens due to the relatively low material internal quantum yield and non-optimal recombination constants.49,50
In addition to the above-mentioned advantages, halide perovskites allow for simple fabrication of resonant NPs on arbitrary substrates,17,19,51 implying that parasitic absorption in a substrate material can be eliminated. Moreover, according to the previous studies, not only perovskite spheres17,52 can be fabricated, but also nanocuboid,51 cylindrical23 and pyramidal53 shapes can be fabricated, which have various degrees of freedom for precise manipulation by Mie resonances.54,55 This opens up unique technological opportunities for the creation of highly efficient optical cooling designs.
3. Conclusion
We have demonstrated a resonant phonon-assisted up-conversion photoluminescence optical cooling approach based on the enhancement of the emission rate and photoexcitation with Mie resonances at pump and emission wavelengths. Numerical and analytical modeling have revealed that the highest cooling efficiencies for a halide perovskite spherical NP correspond to the excitation of magnetic-type Mie modes. Namely, the magnetic octupole at emission and the magnetic quadrupole at absorption allow for cooling a single nanocavity by ΔT ≈ −110 K under realistic conditions. We believe that the proposed mechanism will pave the way for a new generation of all-optical nanoscale cooling devices.
