    , Accepted 29th May 2016First published on 1st June 2016AbstractTo date, the fundamental question still remains regarding the role of chlorine (Cl) in the gas-phase growth process of CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) perovskites. Herein, we report an NH4Cl-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method for fabricating efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It was found that the elaborately introduced Cl has an obvious acceleration influence on the formation of perovskites through forming intermediate phase CH3NH3PbCl3 and volatile NH3 and HI, which may effectively reduce the reaction time from 2–4 hours to 50 minutes, and drastically decrease the reaction temperature from above 150 °C to 120 °C. As such, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskites was significantly enhanced from 10.86% to 12.2%, and an impressive 13.3% champion efficiency was successfully achieved in this study. Therefore, our finding readily overcame the bottleneck of common CVD approaches and was also helpful to understand the PbI2–CH3NH3PbCl3–CH3NH3PbI3 gas-phase growth kinetics of perovskites, which shows high potential for application in flexible PV devices.
1. Introduction
In recent years, PSCs have received considerable attention due to their large absorption coefficient, suitable direct band gap and long-range electron–hole diffusion lengths.1–5 Over several years, the PCE of PSCs has rapidly increased from the limited 3.8% to an unprecedented 20.1%.6,7 On account of their simple manufacturing processes and excellent optical-electric properties, PSCs have sparked an explosion in the field of PV research and show high potential as a cost-efficient alternative to the currently prevailing solar cells. In general, there are two main ways to prepare perovskite light absorbing layers: one is the most studied solution-based process and the other is vacuum thermal evaporation. The solution route includes one-step and two-step processes and has demonstrated highly efficient PV devices; however, this method always has large variations in the film morphology and its device performance and also shows poor reproducibility, in which the over-rapid intercalating reaction rate usually results in rough and porous perovskite layers with incomplete coverage.2,8,9 More recently, some effective measures have been taken to resolve those issues such as the new approach for forming PbI2 nanostructures together with high CH3NH3I concentration10 and the method of using a Lewis base adduct of PbI2.11 Inversely, high-quality perovskite layers could be readily produced through vacuum-based technology, but the high vacuum equipment investment hampers its large-scale applications.3,12,13 Thus, there is an urgent demand for research and development of cost-efficient technologies for PSCs preparation.
Last year, Yang et al. developed another vapor-assisted solution process (VASP) and successfully obtained smooth, full-covered perovskite films with grain size up to the microscale.14 Although the VASP method has been considered as a fruitful way to fabricate perovskite layers, the complicated glove box manipulations may hinder its further commercial applications. To solve this problem, low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), in situ tubular CVD, and other vapor-assisted routes were successively exploited to fabricate efficient PSCs by our group and other researchers.15–20 It is well known that the vapor-assisted CVD approach is one of the most cost-efficient technologies to uniformly deposit various types of semiconductor thin films over large areas. In our previous research, we found that the slow gas–solid (G–S) reaction in CVD can effectively overcome the blocking issue of an overly rapid intercalating reaction rate and generates compact, uniform, and pinhole-free perovskite layers with full coverage. As such, efficient and stable PSCs could be achieved under fully open-air conditions with a relatively high humidity.15,16 However, PSCs as-prepared by a conventional CVD approach could only provide a low 800–900 mV open-circuit voltage (Voc).14–18 Moreover, the slow feature of G–S reaction always leads to a long duration reaction time (2 to 4 hours) and a relatively high reaction temperature (>150 °C), which would increase energy consumption and limit flexible plastic substrate applications.14
Recently, adding Cl was demonstrated as an effective measure to enhance the crystallinity and charge transport property of CH3NH3PbI3 films.21–24 The critical role of Cl-based byproduct CH3NH3Cl on the formation of pure, pore-free CH3NH3PbI3 films during the vacuum-assisted thermal annealing process was revealed by Choy in a recent report.25 However, current studies regarding the beneficial effect of Cl on the nucleation and crystallization of perovskites are mainly focused on solution-based process.26–28 Herein, we present a novel NH4Cl + CH3NH3I mixing vapor-assisted CVD method to realize the low-temperature and rapid perovskite layer preparation with the critical Cl element successfully introduced into the CH3NH3PbI3 films during the G–S growth process. Note that Cl-incorporated perovskites are denoted as CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) in the following text. Strikingly, compared with the abovementioned vapor deposition methods, the reaction time and temperature in our strategy are tremendously reduced, and its total conversion from PbI2 precursor films to perovskite layers could be completed in just 50 minutes with an extremely low 120 °C reaction temperature. Moreover, the PSCs device PV performance, particularly the Voc and filling factor (FF), was also greatly improved, showing an average 12.2% PCE with an impressive champion 13.3% efficiency, which is significantly higher than that of conventional vapor-assisted methods.14–18 Thus, our method adopting the industry matured CVD technology and due to a low energy consumption advantage is very promising to be applied in the future commercial PSCs production.
2. Experimental
2.1. The preparation of mixing vapor source
The CH3NH3I power was synthesized by our previous reported procedures.15,16 Then, the CH3NH3I and NH4Cl power were mixed in a 3:1 weight ratio and milled in an agate mortar for 5 minutes. Finally, the mixture was loaded in a boat as the mixing vapor source for the CVD processing of perovskite layers.
2.2. The fabrication of perovskite device
Fluorine doped tin oxide glass substrates (15 Ω per square, Pilkington) were patterned by etching with Zn power and 2 M HCl diluted in deionized water. The substrates were subsequently ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol for 25 minutes each. The compact TiO2 was deposited onto pre-cleaned substrates by spin-coating a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol (350 μL in 5 mL of ethanol with 0.013 M HCl) at 2000 rpm for 30 seconds, which was then sintered at 500 °C for 45 minutes. Furthermore, the compact TiO2 was treated with 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 60 minutes at 65 °C and dried at 500 °C for another 45 minutes. The CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) films were fabricated by a tubular CVD method. Briefly, 1 M PbI2 dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was coated onto the compact TiO2 surface at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds and then heat treated at 100 °C for 30 minutes. The obtained PbI2 films and NH4Cl + CH3NH3I powder were both loaded into the quartz tube, and the reaction time and temperature were sequentially investigated: (1) heating to 120 °C with different reaction times of 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and 50 minutes; (2) separately heated to 100 °C, 110 °C, and 120 °C for 50 minutes, and the dark brown perovskite films were obtained. Then, the CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) films were annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 30 minutes in air. For comparison, CH3NH3PbI3 films were also prepared through reacting PbI2 films with pure CH3NH3I vapor at 145 °C for 120 minutes using our previously reported CVD method.16 After that, the hole transport material (HTM) solution composed of 72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD, 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsyfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) films obtained above at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds. Finally, the silver electrode was thermally evaporated at 10−6 bar. The active area of a single device was 0.12 cm2. All the devices were fabricated under fully open-air conditions with a high humidity around 45% at room temperature.
2.3. The characterization of PSCs
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a simultaneous thermogravimetric analyzer (STA449F3) with a 10 °C per minute temperature rising rate. The crystal structures of the CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) films were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO MPD) with Cu Kα radiation in the range of 10°–70°. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted by a VG ESCALAB250 surface analysis system equipped with a monochromatic Al X-ray (1486.6 eV) source. Raman spectroscopy was also measured by a Focal Laser MicroRaman Spectrometer (LABRAM-HR) with a 514.5 nm excitation at room temperature. Morphologies were investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Sirion200). The absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) films were analyzed by a UV-visible spectrophotometer (CARY 5000) in the 300–1000 nm wavelength range. The capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were obtained using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C) at different fixed frequencies of 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 3 kHz, 4 kHz and 10 kHz in the dark. Photocurrent density and voltage (J–V) were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G) provided by a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Sol3A 94023A). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with an IQE-200 equipment by focusing a monochromatic beam of light onto the devices.
3. Results and discussion
To simplify the device architecture for expanding its applications in the PV field, the current prevailing planar heterojunction PSCs were adopted in this research, with a structure of Glass/FTO/C-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3(Cl)/HTM/Ag. As shown in Fig. 1, CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) perovskite films were deposited through a mixing vapor-assisted CVD process. Briefly, PbI2 films are first spin-coated on the surface of a compact electron transport layer material C-TiO2, and then loaded into the furnace with NH4Cl + CH3NH3I blending powder to carry out the CVD process, and finally annealed in air ambient to obtain the desired CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) perovskite layers. Full details of the CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) film fabrication of are provided in the Experimental section mentioned above. Notably, since incorporation of Cl can significantly increase the electron–hole diffusion length,21–24 here we innovatively added NH4Cl into the conventional CH3NH3I vapor as a mixing gas source, and surprisingly discover that the introduction of Cl could effectively reduce the G–S reaction time and decrease the reaction temperature. As far as we know, this is the first time to apply the Cl-included mixing source into the preparation of PSCs via a vapor-assisted CVD approach.

To gain further insight into the special properties of the mixing gas source, the different mass loss behaviors of NH4Cl, NH4Cl + CH3NH3I, and CH3NH3I were examined by the TGA measurements. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the organic components, NH4Cl, NH4Cl + CH3NH3I, and CH3NH3I underwent 100% weight loss around 330–350 °C, and their sublimation temperatures decreased along with the increase of NH4Cl content, suggesting that the reaction temperature could be decreased by adding NH4Cl. Actually, from Fig. 2(b), we may see the same trend in the partial enlarged TAG details, where the starting temperatures for weight loss dropped drastically from 225 °C to below 200 °C. Moreover, the perovskite structural formation process of CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) films before annealing was also characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 2(c) shows the XRD patterns of PbI2 films reacted with NH4Cl + CH3NH3I mixing gas source at 120 °C with different reaction times of 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and 50 minutes, respectively. In general, during the common vapor-assisted approach, it usually takes two to four hours to complete the conversion from PbI2 to perovskites due to slow G–S reaction.14 As shown in Fig. 2(d), light brown films were obtained when PbI2 films reacted with pure CH3NH3I vapor at low temperature and short periods of time (120 °C, 50 minutes), which means the transformation from yellow PbI2 to dark brown CH3NH3PbI3 was incomplete at this stage. Surprisingly, with the addition of NH4Cl, the intercalating reaction proceeded very rapidly, and deep dark brown perovksite films were obtained, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The perovskite structure had formed in just 5 minutes based on the strong (110) diffraction of CH3NH3PbI3 at 14.09°, coexisting with the weak (001) peak of unreacted PbI2 at 12.64° and the starting appearance of the (100) CH3NH3PbCl3 crystal plane at 15.56°.4,29 After reacting for 15 minutes, the PbI2 phase disappeared and only two main CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbCl3 phases were observed. When the reaction proceeded for 50 minutes, all the other impurity phases vanished and fully converted into a single CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite structure, giving distinctive peaks at 14.10°, 28.41°, 31.83°, and 43.17°, which are separately assigned to the (110), (220), (310) and (330) planes, in agreement with previous reports.14,15 Furthermore, in the final perovskite films, the CH3NH3PbCl3 phase with characteristic XRD diffraction at 15.56° was not detected, which means Cl-incorporated compound had poor thermal stability and can be readily transferred into CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites.4,21,30 Yu et al. reported that too much CH3NH3+ will slow down the CH3NH3PbI3 formation reaction for solution-based methods, whereas the Cl function could release the excess CH3NH3+ through forming gaseous CH3NH3Cl with low-temperature annealing conditions.30 Herein, we also observe that Cl inclusion by the NH4Cl + CH3NH3I mixing gas could improve the reaction rate and reduce the reaction temperature in our CVD method, which might form intermediate phase CH3NH3PbCl3 and volatile NH3 and HI to accelerate the G–S reaction process. Thus, the PbI2–CH3NH3PbCl3–CH3NH3PbI3 phase-evolution process when PbI2 reacts with NH4Cl + CH3NH3I mixing gas might be as follows: PbI2 + CH3NH3I → CH3NH3PbI3(1) CH3NH3PbI3 + 3NH4Cl → CH3NH3PbCl3 + 3NH3↑ + 3HI↑(2) CH3NH3PbCl3 + 3CH3NH3I → CH3NH3PbI3 + 3CH3NH2 + 3HCl(3)

As a consequence, with NH4Cl assistance, the slow intercalating G–S reaction could be completed in just 50 minutes, and the key Cl element would play a crucial role in the film morphology evolution and is highly expected to improve the device performance.
Since the incorporation strategy for NH4Cl into vapor source could effectively reduce the reaction time, its effect on the reaction temperature in the CVD process was also investigated. Compared with the conventional high reaction temperature (>150 °C), three different lower temperatures, 100 °C, 110 °C, and 120 °C, were used here. Temperatures above 120 °C are adverse for saving energy consumption and applications in flexible plastic substrates. Before annealing, as shown in Fig. 3(a), when films were reacted at 100 °C, as in eqn (1) and (2), deducting from the substrate diffractions, there were three phases, namely, the main CH3NH3PbI3, PbI2 and the weak CH3NH3PbCl3 structures observed in XRD patterns, suggesting the low reaction temperature of 100 °C is not sufficient to fulfill the complete conversion from PbI2 to perovskites. Then, an elevated temperature of 110 °C was employed and the PbI2 peak disappeared and the (100) plane peak for CH3NH3PbCl3 was greatly enhanced, which indicated that reaction (1) was completed and the main reaction was proceeded according to eqn (2). At last, when the temperature was gradually increased to 120 °C, the intermediate CH3NH3PbCl3 phase totally transferred into the single perovskite phase, as shown in eqn (3). Therefore, the optimized lowest reaction temperature of 120 °C was obtained. Subsequently, with the PV devices assembled, their corresponding J–V curves measured by a reverse scan mode from 1.2 V to −0.1 V are shown in Fig. 3(b), and the device PV performance is also provided in Table 1. As can be seen, PSCs reacting at 100 and 110 °C had poor 4.04% and 6.75% efficiencies, respectively. Moreover, serious J–V roll-over phenomena in the voltage ranges from 0 to 1.3 V were apparent. We speculate that they may result from a PbI2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction, caused by the presence of PbI2 coming from the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 surface during the annealing process.16 Herein, perovskite films reacted at 100 °C and 110 °C accompanied with CH3NH3PbCl3 impurity should have a low thermal stability and easily decompose during the annealing process,29,31 leading to a more serious roll-over phenomenon in the 0–1.3 V voltage range, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Inversely, when the reaction temperature was increased to 120 °C, the special roll-over phenomenon almost disappeared, which can be clearly observed in Fig. 4(b) and indicates a relatively complete conversion from PbI2 to pervoskites under elevated temperature; thus, its PV performance was greatly enhanced. As a demonstration, a randomly selected cell shows a high efficiency of 12.99%, demonstrating an outstanding PCE. In addition, XPS spectra of CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) films before annealing prepared at different temperatures, 100 °C, 110 °C, and 120 °C, were also conducted to monitor the PbI2–CH3NH3PbCl3–CH3NH3PbI3 phase-evolution process and detect the presence Cl in the perovskites. From Fig. 5, the Cl signal is clearly shown in the perovksites spectrum at 110 °C. At an elevated temperature of 120 °C, no Cl was detected and only peaks for Pb4f and I3d were detected. These results are consistent with the abovementioned PbI2–CH3NH3PbCl3–CH3NH3PbI3 gas-phase growth kinetics process.

To further confirm our speculation about the PbI2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction and deeply research the J–V curves interesting roll-over phenomenon, the crystal structural evolution before and after annealing treatment and the stability of as-prepared perovskite films with different growth temperature were also scrutinized. Fig. 6 shows the Raman spectra of perovskite layers (a) before and (b) after annealing treatment at different growth temperatures. Except for the main peak at 96 cm−1, assigned to the CH3NH3PbI3 phase, PbI2 exhibited a strong peak at 216 cm−1.15,16,32 Before or after annealing, the PbI2 phase both existed in the films reacted at 100 °C and 110 °C. After annealing, the signal of PbI2 was enhanced, leading to serious roll-over characteristics in their J–V curves. Before annealing, we could not find the PbI2 peak in the films reacted at 120 °C, and only a weak signal of PbI2 was examined after annealing, which should be the cause of the disappearance of the roll-over characteristic. Fig. 6(c) shows XRD of as-prepared perovskite films with different growth temperatures, 100 °C, 110 °C, and 120 °C, after annealing treatment in air. Compared with that before annealing, as shown in Fig. 3(a), stronger diffraction peaks for PbI2 appeared in both the films reacted at 100 °C and 110 °C after annealing. This just confirms our initial speculation of the presence of a PbI2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction arising from the perovskite films decomposition during the annealing process, and it also well explains the reason why much more serious roll-over phenomenon was detected from the low-temperature deposited devices.16,32 From Fig. 6(d), we can directly observe that the films reacting at 100 °C and 110 °C are not stable and quickly decompose after exposure in air for 3 days, which might be caused by the incomplete conversion from PbI2 to perovskites, accompanied with PbI2 impurity and the unstable CH3NH3PbCl3 intermediate phase. At the same time, the CH3NH3PbCl3 peaks existing for the films reacted at 100 and 110 °C before annealing totally disappeared after annealing treatment, which proves that the intermediate CH3NH3PbCl3 phase was very unstable. On the contrary, the films reacted at 120 °C demonstrated excellent stability, as shown in Fig. 6(d). There was only a small amount of PbI2 present in the films after annealing, which plays a crucial self-induced passivation role and could boost its device performance.32

Through the inspection of reaction time and temperature, the morphologies of as-prepared films were then characterized. Fig. 7 shows the SEM micrographs of (a) as-coated PbI2 films and (b) CH3NH3PbI3 films by pure CH3NH3I vapor; (c) CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) films reacted at 100 °C, (d) 110 °C, and (e) 120 °C; and (f) PV device from CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) films reacted at 120 °C. Basically, perovskite absorber layers (300 to 600 nm) particularly in the planar type PSCs must have a high-quality film quality to avoid the shunting current arising from direct contact between TiO2 and hole-transporting material (HTM), and thus significant efforts were devoted to improve the pervoskite layers morphology.33–36 From Fig. 7(a) and (b), we can see that small PbI2 grains below 100 nm with irregular polyhedrons grew up to 200 to 300 nm after converting to CH3NH3PbI3 under CH3NH3I vapor at 145 °C for 120 minutes. When NH4Cl was added, more compact grains with the same size could be obtained at 100 °C for 50 minutes, which is shown in Fig. 7(c). Then, more CH3NH3PbCl3 small crystal nuclei shown in Fig. 7(d) were formed followed by the abovementioned reaction (2), as the temperature increased to 110 °C. Finally, they react with CH3NH3I as reaction (3) and uniform, compact and full-covered grains with big sizes up to ∼500 nm were obtained (Fig. 7(e)). Herein, we directly observe the PbI2–CH3NH3PbCl3–CH3NH3PbI3 phase transformation process through SEM morphology evolution, which provided strong evidence for the acceleration effect of chlorine in the perovskites gas-phase growth process. Based on the cross-sectional SEM of the PV device, as shown in Fig. 7(f), the thicknesses of C-TiO2, CH3NH3PbI3(Cl), HTM, and Ag layers were separately measured to be ∼80 nm, ∼490 nm, ∼230 nm, and ∼180 nm, exhibiting a typical well-compacted layer structure.

The optical property of CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) films reacting at 120 °C was examined by a UV-visible spectrophotometer in the 300–1000 nm wavelength range. Fig. 8(a) depicts the optical absorption spectrum of perovskite films inserted with the dark brown samples image with a 2 × 1.5 cm2 size, where the CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) films demonstrated a strong visible light absorption, extending over the entire visible spectrum up to 800 nm. Then, a 1.50 eV band gap (Eg) was also deduced as follows: αhν = A(hν − Eg)1/2(4)where hν is the photon energy and A is an arbitrary constant, which are in good agreement with previous reports.4,7 The C–V measurements in Fig. 8(b) were also performed to investigate the original Voc enhancement in PSCs, which could provide a valuable insight into the built-in potential of PV devices. Obviously, the C–V curves have the same trend at different frequencies. With increased frequency, the capacitance decreased abruptly, and a built-in 0.959 V potential at 4 kHz (green line) could be calculated out according to the intercept value between the back straight line and bias axis, which was quite consistent with the detected Voc (0.983 V).37,38

In the end, the PV performance of our CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) cells and CH3NH3PbI3 devices were both detected for comparison. As shown in Table 2, CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) devices had an average Voc of 0.993 ± 0.018 V, a short current density (Jsc) of 18.54 ± 1.53 mA cm−2, a FF of 66.37% ± 0.03%, and a PCE of 12.2% ± 0.95%. Compared with that of CH3NH3PbI3 devices, the Voc of CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) cells increased from 0.917 mV to 0.993 mV, with a 76 mV enhancement; the FF also improved from 58.39 to 66.37; and the average PCE was correspondingly enhanced from 10.86% to 12.20%, suggesting a significant 1.5% boosting of almost; only the Jsc decreased from 20.27 mA cm−2 to 18.54 mA cm−2. The PV performance of our CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) PSCs, including the Voc, FF, and PCE, were also tremendously improved even compared to the conventional vapor-assisted method.14–20Fig. 9(a) and (b) show the J–V curves and EQE spectrum of our champion cells inserted with the PSC image. Herein, the highest PCE of 13.33% under AM 1.5 G full-sun illuminations was achieved, with a Voc of 0.983 V, Jsc of 20.61 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.658. The high Jsc should be attributed to an efficient charge extraction over a large part of the visible spectrum with a broad EQE plateau (>71% between 420 and 750 nm). The big Voc and FF may be a result from Cl incorporation, which could greatly reduce the charge recombination in our device. Chen et al. insist that Cl incorporation can effectively improve the carrier transport across the heterojunction interfaces.21 Hence, the high PV performance of our cells should benefit from NH4Cl addition during the mixing vapor-assisted CVD process.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we present a novel NH4Cl + CH3NH3I mixing vapor-assisted method to fabricate efficient PSCs, and it is the first time NH4Cl was introduced into the perovskite films preparation by a vapor-assisted approach. With the aid of Cl, the slow G–S reaction that usually takes 2 to 4 hours may be fulfilled in just 50 minutes; moreover, the conventional high reaction temperature (>150 °C) also dropped to 120 °C. Further research determined that the addition of Cl could significantly enhance the device PV performance compared with conventional CVD, with an impressive 12.2% average efficiency of 12.2% and a best PCE of 13.3%. In addition, the novel PbI2–CH3NH3PbCl3–CH3NH3PbI3 phase-evolution process was also illustrated and first reported here. Therefore, our method demonstrates the possibility of rapid production of PSCs in a low-temperature CVD process, which is very promising to be transplanted to fabricating perovskite PV devices on flexible plastic substrates.
