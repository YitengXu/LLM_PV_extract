    , Accepted 24th June 2022First published on 13th July 2022AbstractProton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the most energy-efficient low-temperature electrolysis method, is promising for converting intermittent renewable energies into stable hydrogen chemical energy. However, the cumulative corrosive environment resulting from the acidic conditions required and the positive half-cell potentials imply that only materials having high intrinsic activity and stability can be used. Herein, we propose catalysts and a corresponding fabrication method that meets these requirements. A 3D dandelion spore-structured self-supporting IrNi electrocatalyst is directly fabricated on a porous transport layer through the adsorbed H-induced co-electrodeposition of a core–shell IrNi–Ir structure. Subsequent dealloying generates a highly porous nanostructured Ir-based framework robust to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a wide pH range. Specifically, it exhibited overpotentials of 248 mV (OER) and 15 mV (HER) at ±10 mA cm−2 in an acidic electrolyte with exceptional stability even after constant operation at 200 mA cm−2 for 50 h (OER) or 5000 potential cycles (HER). When used as a bifunctional catalyst (0.67 mg cm−2) for PEMWE, 6.5 A cm−2 was obtained at a cell voltage of 2.0 V. The degradation rate was only 1.58 mV h−1 under extremely harsh test conditions of 2 A cm−2 for 100 h, thus verifying the exceptional stability of a single cell. This is the first report of bifunctional catalysts with such high performance and stability fabricated using a simple method, and this work can aid the commercialization of PEMWE.

Broader context
Grid-adaptable stability of renewable solar and wind energies is achievable using a buffer energy storage system with large capacity and high conversion efficiency against the intermittency of renewable energies. Despite extensive and diverse studies on water electrolysis as a buffer system, electrochemical reactions on the electrode surface require high overpotentials. In addition, nano catalyst-based electrodes are challenged for their stability in corrosive operational environments. From this viewpoint, the existing performances of noble metal-based PEMWE (around 3–4 A cm−2@2 Vcell) are at a standstill, and the durability evaluation under mild condition (around tens to hundreds mA cm−2) is insufficient as an active answer to the commercialization of PEMWE. Therefore, we suggest an easy fabrication process of small precious metal amount universal water electrolysis catalysts with robust activity and stability. A simple two-step electrochemical method enabled the formation of a porous transport electrode composed of supportless nano-frame network IrNi catalysts with exceptionally high activity (6.5 A cm−2@2.0 Vcell), surviving extremely harsh tests of 2 A cm−2 for at least 100 h. We stress that the developed bifunctional catalysts overwhelm the existing PEMWE performances and inspire relevant works.

Introduction
Sustainable and CO2-free energy systems can be realized by using renewable energy resources such as solar and wind power. However, electricity from renewable sources can be obtained intermittently with supply fluctuation to the grid, making the power system unstable.1,2 One solution is to combine it with an energy storage system that provides energy storage and conversion flexibility. The high energy density and low self-discharge make hydrogen an ideal energy storage medium compared to other energy storage media.3–5
Water electrolysis is an eco-friendly technology that electrochemically converts water into oxygen and high purity hydrogen (>99.9%) without emitting pollutants. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) offers many advantages such as a compact system, higher current density, lower gas crossover, higher gas purity, and high-pressure operation compared to conventional alkaline electrolysis using 20–30% alkaline solutions (NaOH, KOH).6,7 However, PEMWE creates a strongly oxidizing environment, demanding component stability and scarce and valuable novel materials as catalysts.
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis follows a simple reduction mechanism involving two electrons, resulting in little overpotential with small amounts of Pt (∼1.0 mg cm−2).7 In contrast, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a complex oxidation mechanism involving four electrons in several electrochemical steps, including the breakdown of H–O bonds and formation of O–O bonds.8–10 Eventually, the OER kinetics become very sluggish, requiring a large overpotential with large amounts of precious metal catalysts, i.e., 2–4 mg cm−2 of Ir.7 Thus, the efficiency of PEMWE is largely governed by OER catalysts; therefore, developing innovative OER catalysts that are highly acid-resistant and performance-efficient while minimizing the overpotential and maximizing the catalyst utilization is important for large-scale hydrogen production applications.
In 2014, Danilovic et al. reported opposite trends in activity and stability, with the most active oxide (Au ≪ Pt < Ir < Ru ≪ Os) as an OER catalyst being the least stable (Au ≫ Pt > Ir > Ru ≫ Os) material in acids.11 Accordingly, many studies have focused on developing Ir-based catalysts, having balanced activity and stability. The intrinsic activity of Ir toward the OER can be enhanced through atomic-level doping or alloying with 3d transition metals. The transition metal controls the adsorption energy of the O* and OH* intermediates on the catalyst surface by adjusting the local electronic environment while reducing the use of Ir.12–15 In particular, selective etching or dealloying using a transition metal (e.g., Ni, Fe, Co) less noble than Ir to maximize the surface area-to-volume ratio is an effective structural engineering strategy for cost-effective Ir-based catalysts.16 For example, Lv et al. developed Ir-based multi-metallic catalysts (IrNi, IrCo) supported on carbon and evaluated the catalytic activity for the HER and OER. Due to the ligand effect of alloying with Ni or Co, the Ir-based catalyst (overpotentials of 293 mV (OER) and 25 mV (HER) at ±10 mA cm−2) showed better electrocatalytic activity than Ir/C (320 mV (OER) and 41 mV (HER) at ±10 mA cm−2).14 Nong et al. prepared IrNiOx supported on mesoporous antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) for the acidic OER, exhibiting better activity and stability than IrOx/C and IrOx/commercial-ATO by dealloying/oxidizing and accompanying effects.15
Most of the reported catalysts are powder-type catalysts supported on carbon or conductive metal oxide to improve OER activity by increasing the catalyst utility.12–15 However, powdered catalysts suffer from severe durability degradation due to corrosion of the supporting material.17 Moreover, electrode manufacturing using powder-type catalysts necessitates an extra coating procedure with a polymer binder, which lowers electrical conductivity while blocking the catalyst's active site, reducing electrocatalytic efficacy. Furthermore, due to vigorous gas evolution at high current densities, the catalysts physically coated to the substrate are peeled off, causing poor durability.18,19 Therefore, the mild long-term durability test protocols in existing studies, such as chronopotentiometry (CP) measurement at a constant current density of 1–10 mA cm−2 for 1–2 days, or repeated cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the OER potential range for up to 1000 cycles, are insufficient to verify the stability of powdered catalysts. Therefore, it is necessary to design efficient catalyst materials with prolonged high performance under substantially harsh test conditions, i.e., higher current density or voltage, for practical large-scale electrolyzers.
In contrast, self-supported catalysts without binders exhibit superior electrochemical properties and have many intrinsic/extrinsic advantages.18–20 The processing time is shortened as they are grown directly on the substrate, and the porous transport layer (PTL) in the PEMWE system, without post-coating, forms a porous transport electrode (PTE). Moreover, it has good electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical stability under vigorous gas-evolving conditions via chemical binding with the substrate. Furthermore, it is possible to engineer a three-dimensional (3D) structure in the catalyst layer and prevent PTL corrosion by forming a protective layer, thereby increasing the electrochemically active sites and enhancing electron/mass transport capability and durability.
We propose a strategy to simultaneously advance the activity and stability of a bimetallic electrocatalyst under practical and harsh conditions of PEMWE operation using the synergistic effect obtained through surface engineering and adjusting the electronic properties and nanostructures. We prepared a self-supported 3D Ir-based electrode via electrodeposition. Electrodeposition is a cost-effective and safe technique of synthesizing highly active and stable electrocatalysts without using toxic chemicals. In addition, stable self-supporting catalysts with an easy morphology and structural engineering can be constructed by direct deposition on PTL.21 The surface reconstruction of the catalyst by nanostructuring via successive dealloying can also withstand corrosion problems during catalysis in harsh acidic oxidative environments for ultimate material design with increased activity and long-term operational durability. The integration of porous structures, independent interconnected structures, and synergistic interactions of alloys allows using rationally designed nanoporous Ir-based catalysts in PEMWE as redox (HER/OER)-active bifunctional electrodes with both efficient performance and long-term durability.
Experimental
IrNi electrodeposition
A potentiostat (Metrohm, Autolab, PGSTAT302N) was used to perform IrNi electrodeposition (ED-IrNi) under a typical three-electrode system. We used a PTL of Ti fiber felt (BEKAERT, 2GDL08N-025) as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, CHI Instruments, CHI150) as the reference electrode, and a graphite rod as the counter electrode. Prior to electrodeposition, the Ti fiber felt substrate was treated with 5 wt% oxalic acid ((COOH)2·2H2O (Daejung, 5640-4400)) solution at 95 °C for 30 min to remove surface oxide,22 washed with deionized water, vacuum dried, and then mounted on a home-made Teflon cell exposing an area of 1.327 cm2 (d = 1.3 cm). The electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 0.01 M HCl (Daejung, 4090-4400), 0.1 M NH4Cl (Daejung, 1060-4100), 0.3 M H3BO3 (Daejung, 2036-4405), 0.05 M NiCl2·6H2O (Wako pure chemical industry, 141-01045) and 0.02 M Na3IrCl6·xH2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 288160) in deionized water (DI water, 18.2 MΩ), and stirring for 30 min. Then the electrolyte was purged by bubbling N2 gas for 30 min to remove the dissolved O2 before electrodeposition. The electrodeposition was carried out under ambient conditions at a constant potential of −2.8 VSCE for 15 min.
Dealloyed nanoporous IrNi preparation
The electrodeposited IrNi (ED-IrNi) was electrochemically dealloyed to prepare highly nanoporous IrNi (DNP-IrNi) using the chrono-potentiometric technique at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 2 h in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (Daejung, 7690-3705), then washed several times with DI water, and finally vacuum dried. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the potential is approximately 0.3 VRHE for the initial 35 min, where the Ni exposed on the surface is first dissolved to produce nanoporous metallic Ir. Oxidation occurs in succession, with the potential suddenly increasing to approximately 1.5 VRHE, providing complete oxidation for the next 85 min. This method is significantly different from the typical electrochemical dealloying methods, i.e., potential cycling within the range of 0.05–1.5 VRHE where the dissolution and oxidation of Ir occur simultaneously.23–27
Characterization of the catalysts
The surface morphologies of the prepared catalysts were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Carl Zeiss, Sigma) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were obtained using an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope (Themis Z, Thermo Fisher) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The composition of the catalysts and their elemental distribution were analyzed through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Noran System 7, Thermo Fisher). The crystal structure of the prepared samples was determined with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Bruker-AXS, New D8-Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418 Å) in the two-theta range of 20–80° and a scan rate of 2° min−1. The XRD was equipped with a Lynx Eye line detector. The changes in the electronic structure and oxidation state were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an Al Kα source (hν = 1486.6 eV; spot size = 400 μm). The binding energy of the C–C peak in the C 1s spectrum was calibrated to 284.8 eV. Valance band spectra (VBS) were recorded through XPS, and the upper level of integration was set to 15.0 eV for the Shirley background subtraction, and the intensity of the maximum peak was normalized to be equal.28 X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) was measured at the 8C nano-probe X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) beamline (BL8C) of Pohang Light Source (PLS-II) in the 3.0 GeV storage ring, with a ring current of 350 mA. The X-ray beam was monochromated by a Si(111) double crystal where the beam intensity was reduced by 30% to eliminate the higher-order harmonics. The X-ray beam was then delivered to a secondary source aperture where the beam size was adjusted to be 0.5 mm (v) × 1 mm (h). XANES spectra were collected in transmission or fluorescence modes. The obtained spectra were processed using the Demeter package. The Ir loading amount and atomic composition of the catalysts were analyzed through inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (5900 ICP-OES, Agilent Technologies).
Electrochemical characterization
The electrochemical measurements were performed in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution (pH = 0.5) at 25 °C using a three-electrode system connected to a potentiostat (Metrohm, Autolab, PGSTAT302N). The distance between the working and SCE reference electrodes was fixed at 0.8 cm. In addition to electrolysis in acidic solution, it was evaluated in neutral (1 M PBS, pH = 7.4) and alkaline (1 M KOH, pH = 13.5) solutions. For testing in alkaline solution, a mercury/mercurous oxide (Hg/HgO, RE-61AP) electrode immersed in 1 M KOH was used as the reference electrode. All the applied potentials were converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential (ERHE) as follows:ERHE = Eexp + E0ref + 0.0592 V × pH,where Eexp is the experimental potential with respect to the reference electrode, E0ref is 0.241 V for the SCE and 0.098 V for Hg/HgO, and pH is the pH of the electrolyte solution.
The half-cell activity of the IrNi catalysts was investigated by CV in the potential range 1.12 to 1.87 VRHE for the OER and 0.05 to −0.2 VRHE for the HER at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The measured current was divided by the geometric area (1.327 cm2) to obtain current density. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at 1.5 VRHE with an amplitude of 5 mV over the 106–10−2 Hz frequency range using a potentiostat (Wuhan Corrtest Instruments Corp. Ltd, CS310). The obtained solution resistance (Rs) for each electrolyte with different pH values was used for iR correction, while the Nyquist plot showed the OER kinetics of each sample. The mass activity (A g−1) was calculated with the Ir loading mass (m = 0.67 mg cm−2 for DNP-IrNi and 0.7 mg cm−2 for commercial IrOx (Com. IrOx)) and the measured current density (mA cm−2). The electrochemically active surface area of the catalyst is estimated from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), determined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a specific potential range at a scan rate of 1 to 10 mV s−1. The potential range was chosen to be a non-faradaic region for each sample. During the LSV, there is a time period to hold the potentials at both ends of the scan range for 10 s to fully charge/discharge the capacitor.29 An accelerated degradation test (ADT) for the OER was performed by repeating CVs 5000 times between 1.2 and 1.6 VRHE at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Similar conditions were used for an ADT of the HER, but the potential range was 0.05 to –0.2 VRHE. The long-term OER stability test of the catalysts was also conducted using the CP technique at current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm−2 for 50 h.
Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) preparation and single-cell operation
The MEA (an active area of 1 cm2) was prepared without hot-pressing by sandwiching the cathodes and anodes on both sides of the Nafion® 212 membrane (DuPont, 50.8 μm thickness). Three different cathodes were used: (1) the commercial Pt/C catalyst (40 wt%, Alfa Aesar, 047308) on carbon paper with a microporous layer (Sigracet 39 BB); (2) the DNP-IrNi on Ti fiber felt; and (3) DNP-IrNi on carbon paper (Avcarb MGL280). For the anode, Com. IrOx and DNP-IrNi on carbon paper or Ti fiber felt were used. Detailed information on the cathode and anode combination is presented in Table S1 (ESI†). The Pt/C catalyst ink was prepared by mixing Pt/C powder, DI water, isopropanol, and Nafion® D-521 dispersion (Alfa Aesar, 042117) at a weight ratio of 3:15:60:2230 and sonicated for 1 h. For the Com. IrOx anode, the catalyst ink was prepared by mixing IrOx powder (Alfa Aesar, 043396), DI water, isopropanol, and Nafion solution (5 wt%) in a ratio of 2:14:67:17. Then, the ink was sprayed onto carbon paper or Ti fiber felt of 4.5 × 4.5 cm2 with a targeted metal loading, from which 1 × 1 cm2 was cut for use. The PEMWE operation was performed in the range 1.35–2.3 Vcell with a 50 mV interval for 1 min per step by the potentiostatic method after activation for 20 min at 2.3 Vcell. For the PEMWE with a Com. IrOx/Ti fiber felt anode, the activation process was omitted owing to performance degradation caused by Ti PTL oxidation. As a reactant, the preheated DI water was supplied by a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 15 mL min−1 to the anode. The single-cell temperature was maintained at 90 °C during the entire operation.
Results and discussion
Prior to fabricating the binary IrNi structure, the characteristics of pure metal electrodeposition on Ti fiber were identified by electrodeposition of Ir100 and Ni100; the FE-SEM images are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The morphology of Ni100 shows an extremely porous hierarchical structure caused by the limited mass transport of Ni2+ ions and hydrogen bubble template31 due to an excess negative deposition potential of −2.8 VSCE (Fig. S3, ESI†). In contrast, Ir100 was hardly deposited despite the more positive standard reduction potential ([IrCl6]3− + 3e− → Ir(s) + 6Cl−E0 = 0.77 VSHE, Ni2+ + 2e− → Ni(s) E0 = −0.257 VSHE),32 even considering that the concentration of Ir ion (20 mM) was lower than that of Ni ion (50 mM). According to the mechanism proposed by El Sawy and Birss,33 the reduction of [IrCl6]3− is slow but is catalyzed by adsorbed H. Since the adsorption of H on Ti was too strong,34 the reduction of [IrCl6]3− hardly occurred on Ti fiber giving the morphology in Fig. S2c (ESI†). This enables the fabrication of the unique structures of our IrNi catalysts; the sequential procedures are shown in Scheme 1. First, porous Ni is electrodeposited on the pretreated Ti fiber felt, with subsequent H-adsorption on Ni (the standard Gibbs free energy of H-adsorption (ΔGH) on Ni is in the range of −0.27 eV to −0.23 eV35 implying more suitable adsorption of H for catalyzing Ir deposition than on Ti). Upon creation of an appropriate Hads environment, Ir deposition occurs along with continuous Ni deposition to form ED-IrNi. The EDS and XPS results in Table S2 (ESI†) show that the Ir distribution is more on the surface rather than evenly dispersed in bulk. The DNP-IrNi structure was further achieved by dealloying to remove Ni within the macroscopically porous ED-IrNi structures to give nanopores, subsequently controlling the oxidation state of Ir.

Steps I–III describe the fabrication of electrodeposited IrNi (ED-IrNi). IV describes the preparation of DNP-IrNi utilizing a dealloying strategy. The small circular images are the FE-SEM images of the corresponding catalysts, and the large ones are the STEM images. 

Fig. 1 shows the structural analysis results of ED-IrNi and DNP-IrNi. ED-IrNi shows macroscopically porous structures composed of round particles of ∼15 μm size (Fig. 1a), assembled on the Ti fiber maintaining its fibrous contour. The morphologies of ED-IrNi for shorter and longer deposition times are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The bulk composition of ED-IrNi examined by EDS is Ir1Ni18. The composition of DNP-IrNi (Fig. 1b) is drastically changed to Ir1Ni0.18 by the substantial dissolution of Ni. Accordingly, the relatively smooth surface of ED-IrNi particles (inset in Fig. 1a) is converted to a rougher morphology through the formation of cracks and nanopores on the surface during dealloying. A similar macroscopic morphology is observed after heat treatment of DNP-IrNi (HDNP-IrNi) (Fig. S5a–d, ESI†), while Com. IrOx coated on the Ti fiber felt exhibited a dense coating with agglomerated nanoparticles (Fig. S5e–h, ESI†).

For detailed restructuring characterization, high angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images, elemental mapping, and line scans were performed. HAADF-STEM images in Fig. 1c and d confirm that the assembled particulate structures of ED-IrNi and DNP-IrNi are composed of nanocrystals with dimensions of several tens of nanometers. The dense and compact ED-IrNi particles are converted to highly porous dandelion spore-like structures after dealloying (Fig. 1c, d and Fig. S6, ESI†). These nanoporous structures with bicontinuous ligaments were reported to facilitate mass transport,36 highly resistant to coarsening,37 and eliminate support-originated durability issues,38 providing substantial durability enhancement during electrocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, elemental redistribution before and after dealloying was examined by EDS elemental mapping and line profiling. In ED-IrNi, the elemental mapping (Fig. 1c inset) implies an Ir shell–IrNi core structure; the Ir shell is observed as a green annulus. The line scan (Fig. 1e) also presents typical core–shell profiles with high Ir intensities at the edges. The Ir shell structure originates from promoting Ir electrodeposition on the Ni surface (more precisely, H-adsorbed Ni surface). After dealloying, as shown in Fig. 1d and f, most of the Ni that is distributed inside the structure is leached out. The final DNP-IrNi structure consists of highly porous Ir frameworks with small amounts of Ni at the core. The atomic arrangement and crystal structure of the prepared catalysts were analyzed by HRTEM and XRD. The HRTEM and corresponding fast Fourier transform images (Fig. 1g) show that ED-IrNi has a polycrystalline structure of several nanometers, whereas DNP-IrNi (Fig. 1h) has a nanocrystalline structure with short-range order. In addition, the interplanar distances of 0.187 and 0.218 nm in Fig. 1g verify that it was well-matched with the Ir rich surface of IrNi alloy corresponding to (200) and (111) plane in the face-centered cubic structure. The (101) plane of Ni(OH)2 (0.231 nm) was present on the surface due to wet chemical deposition. In DNP-IrNi, the structure was composed of very small grains with the (200) plane of IrO2 corresponding to a lattice fringe of 0.225 nm.
In XRD patterns (Fig. 1i), the peaks of ED-IrNi at 44.27° (111) and 51.54° (200) show a slightly low angle shift from those of Ni (JCPDS No. 04-0850) to those of Ir (JCPDS No. 06-0598) indicating IrNi alloy formation. The rest of the peaks were from the Ti substrate. Composition estimation using the calculated lattice parameter and Vegard's law gives Ir1Ni15.4, which is in good accordance with Ir1Ni18 from EDS analysis (Table S2, ESI†). DNP-IrNi showed almost identical patterns as that of the Ti substrate. In combination with Fig. 1h, a nanocrystalline structure of DNP-IrNi is confirmed with the absence of long-range ordering (A commercially available amorphous iridium oxide purchased from Alfa Aesar, Com. IrOx, was compared). A slight appearance of rutile-IrO2 peaks (JCPDS No. 15-0870) at 28.05°, 34.71°, 54.02°, 57.94°, and 66.05° were observed in HDNP-IrNi, heat-treated under air at 450 °C for 1 h. The effects of heat treatment will be further discussed in the forthcoming section. The spectroscopic analysis in Fig. 1 suggests substantial structural changes in elemental distribution, nanopore formation, and crystallinity upon dealloying. The Ir-framework based highly porous nanocrystalline structure will be a key attribute contributing to catalytic activity and durability.
In addition to the physical restructuring of the catalysts, their electronic structures also need investigation. XPS was performed to validate the oxidation state of the catalyst surface before and after electrochemical dealloying. In the case of the Ni 2p spectrum of ED-IrNi catalyst (Fig. 2a), Ni(OH)2 at 855.78 eV dominates with small amounts of metallic Ni at 852.75 eV due to the water-based wet electrodeposition process. The presence of surface Ni(OH)2 was further verified from the OH ratio in the O 1s spectrum (77%) in Fig. 2c. For the Ir 4f spectrum of ED-IrNi catalyst (Fig. 2b), a metallic Ir peak at 60.64 eV dominates the surface composition. Electron movement from Ni to Ir due to the higher electronegativity of Ir (2.20) than Ni (1.91) and strain effects caused by the lattice mismatch shift the metallic Ni and Ir peaks from their reported values of 852.6 eV39 and 60.8 eV40 to 852.75 eV and 60.64 eV, respectively. This chemical shift confirms the bonding between Ni and Ir, contributing to alloy formation. In contrast, the Ni 2p spectrum of DNP-IrNi, dealloyed in an oxidative environment, exhibits very low intensities, with most metallic Ni peaks disappearing and minor amounts of oxidized species of NiO and Ni(OH)2 remaining. (Note that the surface of DNP-IrNi is mainly composed of Ir framework (Fig. 1d) due to Ni dissolution; thus, the intensities of Ni-species in DNP-IrNi are much smaller than those in ED-IrNi). Similarly, the Ir 4f spectrum of DNP-IrNi reveals that all surface metallic Ir is oxidized to IrO2 (61.81, 64.81 eV), with a tiny amount of metallic Ir (60.95 and 63.95 eV). In the O 1s spectrum of DNP-IrNi, four oxygen species, Ir–O, Ir–OH, Ni–OH, and adsorbates H2O, are observed at 530.5, 531.33, 531.86, and 532.9 eV,40 accounting for 65.2, 11.5, 6, and 17.3%, respectively; most oxygen combines with Ir to form IrO2. The spectrums of HDNP-IrNi are clearly distinguished from those of DNP-IrNi. First, further oxidation of both Ni and Ir occurs as given by the increase in the oxidation state of Ni and disappearance of the Ir metal peak. Second, there is an increase in the migration of Ni with lower surface energy to the surface,41 as seen by increasing surface Ni intensities. This confirms that the core of DNP-IrNi is composed of, at least, small amounts of Ni in the form of IrNi alloy. In the O 1s spectrum, the adsorbed H2O was released due to the heat treatment, while the ratio of Ir–O increased to 74.9%. Com. IrOx, as a comparison, shows a typical Ir 4f spectra in which Ir3+ and Ir4+ coexist, and O 1s spectrum in which surface OH accounts for a large proportion. Unlike the Com. IrOx and literature-reporting mixtures of Ir3+ and Ir4+ species of dealloyed Ir,23–25 the DNP-IrNi and HDNP-IrNi in this study exist mostly in the Ir4+ oxidation state, which is expected to be beneficial for chemical stability because Ir with a low oxidation state eventually converts into high valent Ir4+ under harsh conditions through a vigorous OER.42 For a more precise understanding of the oxidation states of bulk Ir and Ni, XAFS analysis on the ED-IrNi and DNP-IrNi was performed (Fig. S7, ESI†). The oxidation of the Ir L3 edge, where 2p–5d transition occurs, can be compared by using the white line area and its peak position. Since the white line area of ED-IrNi is not clear as shown in Fig S7a (ESI†), the peak position was compared with those of the reference spectra. As shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†) on Ir XANES, the peak position of ED-IrNi is identical to that of Ir foil, confirming the presence of Ir as a metallic phase. It also confirms the electron transfer from Ni to Ir through the decrease in the white line area when compared to that of Ir foil. The oxidation state of Ir in DNP-IrNi is reasonably expected to be +2 or +3 since the peak position and the white line area lies between those of Ir foil and IrO2. Considering this together with the XPS results, it is reasonably concluded that IrO2 exists on the surface of DNP-IrNi while the core contains metallic Ir. For the Ni K edge where 1s–4p transition occurs, the position of the rising edge can be compared. In this experiment, the rising edge positions of DNP-IrNi and NiO are clear. Ni XANES analysis shown in Fig. S7b (ESI†) presents a similar shape between ED-IrNi and Ni foil while the rising edges are slightly different. However, the big difference in onset energy makes the comparison of the rising edge position for ED-IrNi and Ni foil uncertain. Therefore, for the two samples, the first derivative maximum was compared, which is another general method of E0 determination for 3d/4d elements. A comparison of peak positions after the differentiation of pre-edges (8333 eV), Fig. S7c (ESI†), confirms the same peak positions, therefore the metallic phase of Ni in ED-IrNi. However, the oxidation state of Ni in DNP-IrNi is +2 since the rising edge (8340–8345 eV) of DNP-IrNi is identical to that of NiO. Physicochemical analysis reveals that the nanocrystalline DNP-IrNi catalyst having an alloy core and highly stable nanoporous Ir-rich oxide framework shell structure has been obtained through surface restructuring. This is further tested for water electrolysis.

An electrochemical investigation of the activity and stability of the developed catalysts to water electrolysis in acidic media was performed. The catalytic activity towards the OER recorded by CV is presented in Fig. 3a. The inactivity of the pretreated Ti substrate, Ni100, Ir100, and ED-IrNi to the OER was first established (Fig. S8, ESI†). The OER of ED-IrNi is far from the typical OER curve presenting oxidation currents in the potential range and more negative than the theoretical OER onset potential. This implies that the oxidation or dissolution of Ni occurs during the OER test. In addition, as shown in Fig. S2c (ESI†), pure Ir is hardly electrodeposited on Ti substrate without the aid of H-adsorbed Ni, leading to the insignificant activity of Ir100. The η10 from the iR-compensated i–V curves obtained in 0.5 M H2SO4 follows the order: DNP-IrNi (248 mV) < HDNP-IrNi (273 mV) < Com. IrOx (315 mV). At the potential of 1.5 VRHE, the OER current density of DNP-IrNi is 35.3 mA cm−2, approximately 4 and 9 times higher than those of HDNP-IrNi (8.9 mA cm−2) and Com. IrOx (3.9 mA cm−2), respectively. A comparison of the performance with previously reported Ir-based catalysts is presented in Fig. 3c and summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The overpotentials of most Ir-based catalysts are between 275 and 320 mV, validating the superior performance of DNP-IrNi.

The Tafel plots of the catalysts provided additional insight into the catalytic performance. In Fig. 3b, the Tafel slopes follow the order: DNP-IrNi (38 mV dec−1) < HDNP-IrNi (56 mV dec−1) < Com. IrOx (111 mV dec−1). The complexity in the multiple OER steps makes it difficult to deduce the mechanism with the Tafel slope alone, but the low value implies a smaller potential rise to deliver the same current density, indicating good electrocatalytic kinetics.8 The relatively high Tafel slope of Com. IrOx (111 mV dec−1) is due, partially, to the oxidation of Ti PTL43 originating from the incomplete and loose coating of Ti by physically adhered IrOx (Fig. S5e–h, ESI†) resulting in the exposure of Ti to an oxidizing environment. However, for the DNP-IrNi, where the entire Ti PTL surface was covered with densely electrodeposited IrNi (Fig. 1b), TiO2 formation might be minimized. The binding strength between the catalyst and reaction intermediates is a crucial factor determining catalytic activity.9 The d-band center of Com. IrOx estimated from the VBS28 is −3.71 eV, whereas the introduction of Ni tuned the d-band center of HDNP-IrNi (−3.65 eV) and DNP-IrNi (−3.39 eV) closer to the Fermi level (Fig. S9, ESI†). Thus, the binding strength with oxygen-containing reaction intermediates is enhanced while lowering the activation energy of binding with adsorbates.44,45 Besides, the Ni component activates the functioning of the bridging oxygen site as a proton acceptor during OER to accelerate deprotonation for faster kinetics.10,26,46 As shown in Fig. 3c, the reported Ir-based catalysts had a Tafel slope of 40 to 67 mV dec−1, implying that DNP-IrNi with a Tafel slope of 38 mV dec−1 has an excellent OER kinetics.
The Nyquist plot from EIS (Fig. 3d) shows variations in resistance components during the OER at 1.50 VRHE. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of DNP-IrNi is approximately 1.8 Ω, significantly lower than that of HDNP-IrNi (2.94 Ω) and Com. IrOx (16.8 Ω), indicating fast electron transfer of DNP-IrNi during the OER. Besides, DNP-IrNi exhibits slightly lower ohmic resistance (1.58 Ω) than HDNP-IrNi (1.64 Ω) or Com. IrOx (1.69 Ω) owing to the metallic characters or lower contact resistance between the PTL and catalysts layer; the latter is the advantage of the electrodeposition method over spray coating.
For insight into the intrinsic activity, each catalyst's electrochemically active surface area was calculated by measuring the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) in the non-Faraday potential range (Fig. S10, ESI†) at scan rates of 1 to 10 mV s−1 by LSV. The resulting linear plots about half the difference between anodic and cathodic current densities against the scan rate are shown in Fig. 3e, where the slope indicates the Cdl values of the catalysts. Cdl for DNP-IrNi, HDNP-IrNi, Com. IrOx, ED-IrNi, and Ti substrate are 567.33, 204.06, 529.97, 75.55, and 2.5 mF cm−2, respectively. Based on the general specific capacitance (Cs) of 35 μF cm−2 for metals29 and 60 μF cm−2 for metal oxides,47 corresponding Rf (roughness factor) values for DNP-IrNi, HDNP-IrNi, Com. IrOx and ED-IrNi are 9456, 3401, 8833, and 2158, respectively. The Rf of the DNP-IrNi catalyst is 4.4 times larger than that of ED-IrNi and even larger than that of Com. IrOx nanoparticle, implying significantly enlarged surface area through nanopore formation by dealloying, as indicated by the dandelion spore-like structures in the HAADF-TEM image (Fig. 1d). In HDNP-IrNi, Rf is 2.78 times smaller than that of DNP-IrNi, due to the thermal agglomeration of the catalyst particles. The larger surface area shows that the prepared DNP-IrNi electrocatalyst has a more catalytically active site for the OER. (It also suggests that the 3D porous dandelion spore-like structure can lead to the transport and removal of gas bubbles from the catalyst layer.)
In addition to addressing the electrochemical kinetics of the catalyst, its activity in terms of mass and area-normalization were identified to exclude the effects of mass loading and surface area of the active material. The mass and specific activities of DNP-IrNi, HDNP-IrNi, and Com. IrOx were calculated from Ir loading amounts and Rfs obtained from ICP and Cdl measurements, respectively (Fig. S11, ESI†). Fig. 3f shows a summary of the activity and follows the order Com. IrOx < HDNP-IrNi < DNP-IrNi. The mass activities of DNP-IrNi and HDNP-IrNi at an overpotential of 270 mV (specifically, the potential at 1.5 V vs. RHE) are 52.48 and 13.14 A g−1, whereas Com. IrOx exhibits 5.276 A g−1, meaning that the DNP-IrNi catalyst is 10 times more economically efficient than Com. IrOx. To objectively confirm the economic feasibility, it is necessary to compare these with reported catalysts. As stated in the introduction, the reported catalysts are mostly powdered catalysts whose activity is evaluated in rotating disk electrode (RDE) systems requiring a few micrograms of catalyst. In contrast, MEA systems require a few milligrams of catalyst.48,49 Therefore, it is inappropriate to compare the mass activity of DNP-IrNi, directly applicable to MEA, with that of others. For eliminating the surface area impact and validate intrinsic activity, the specific activity (normalized current density by the Rf) is compared in Fig. S11 (ESI†) and Fig. 3f. DNP-IrNi has the highest specific activity of 1.267 μA cm−2 at 1.5 VRHE, whereas HDNP-IrNi has 0.871 μA cm−2, approximately 8.8 and 6.1 times higher than Com. IrOx (0.143 μA cm−2), respectively.
Since the long-term stability or durability of OER catalysts is a prerequisite for application in real (commercial) systems, we evaluated durability using CV and CP. An ADT evaluates the stability of the developed catalysts with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for 5000 cycles between 1.2 and 1.6 VRHE. Fig. 3g shows the OER polarization curves of DNP-IrNi and Com. IrOx nanoparticles, initially and after 5000 cycles. After harsh potential cycling, the activity of the DNP-IrNi and HDNP-IrNi catalysts showed a slight increase in the potential to 12 mV and 13 mV, respectively, at 10 mA cm−2, demonstrating excellent durability. As previously mentioned, DNP-IrNi catalysts have the controlled oxidation state of Ir4+ through dealloying, exhibiting excellent durability, whereas the Com. IrOx catalyst shows a marked increase of the overpotential by 105 mV, presenting unstable OER performance at loading cycles under acidic conditions. The change in crystallinity (DNP-IrNi vs. HDNP-IrNi) has little effect on durability. For the Com. IrOx, the efficacy loss can be due to particle detachment by physical stress from continuous O2 bubble generation,50 oxidation, dissolution of IrOx,51,52 and agglomeration of nanoparticles.17 Particularly, bubble resistances due to the relative un-easy release of generated bubbles on the Com. IrOx catalyst surface is responsible for fluctuations in the i–V curve in Fig. 3g at potentials above 1.6 VRHE. However, DNP-IrNi presents an almost stable smooth polarization curve during the 5000 cycles indicating robust stability under harsh conditions.
Long-term stability tests are also performed at 0.5 M H2SO4 at 100 mA cm−2 by CP. This study used a remarkably high current density of 100 mA cm−2, contrary to 10 mA cm−2 in previous studies (Table S3, ESI†). In Fig. 3h, the initial potential of 1.92 VRHE for 100 mA cm−2 in the Com. IrOx catalyst rapidly increased from the beginning of the CP test. Even after 11 h of operation, the potential is 3.0 VRHE. The stability loss during the CP test, similar to the CV tests in Fig. 3g, can be linked to the deactivation phenomena such as dissolution, agglomeration, and bubble-related issues, gradually increasing the potential required to maintain a constant current density. However, DNP-IrNi and HDNP-IrNi exhibited remarkable stability during this high current operation. This agrees with the CV ADT test results in Fig. 3g, suggesting that the DNP-IrNi is extremely stable under power-varying conditions (such as fluctuation in the power supply when combined with renewable energy sources) and normal operating conditions (such as constant H2 production rate). After the durability evaluation at 100 mA cm−2 for 50 h, the physicochemical investigations were performed. Despite the highly corrosive conditions, the surface morphology (Fig. S12, ESI†), microstructure, elemental distribution, crystallinity (Fig. S13, ESI†), electronic structure (Fig. S14, ESI†), and charge transfer resistance (Fig. S15, ESI†) of DNP-IrNi were maintained. The atomic ratio of Ir and Ni through ICP-OES and EDS after the durability test were 91.0:9.0 and 92.6:7.4, respectively, exhibiting preferential dissolution of Ni during the durability test when compared with that of the as-made DNP-IrNi (87.2:12.8) (Table S2, ESI†). This is in good accordance with the results by Reier et al. reporting that the Ni content can be stabilized at around 6–15 at% through interaction with Ir in the mixed oxide matrix.53 In addition, there was a slight decrease in the surface area (Fig. S16, ESI†), which might be due to the detachment of some of the DNP-IrNi after the durability test (Fig. 1bvs. Fig. S12, ESI†); for Com. IrOx, the charge transfer resistance was significantly increased, while the surface area was drastically decreased by a third. Moreover, even at a high current density of 200 mA cm−2, the performance of DNP-IrNi remained stable for 50 h (Fig. S17, ESI†). As has been described in the earlier section, the constant current dealloying method used in this work is the key process parameter for the superior characteristics of DNP-IrNi. To confirm the effects of the dealloying methods on the characteristics of IrNi catalysts, cyclic voltammetry-based dealloying methods23–27 (dealloying of ED-IrNi by potential cycling in the range of 0.05–1.5 VRHE) has been used to make dealloyed IrNi. The OER activity test, ADT (both CV and CP) and XPS analysis for this catalyst were performed. As shown in Fig. S18a and b (ESI†), the overpotentials at 10 mA cm−2 before and after a CV ADT and the overpotential at 100 mA cm−2 after 50 h of operation were inferior to those of DNP-IrNi, due to the different oxidation state according to the dealloying methods (Fig. S18c, ESI†).
Ir has the optimum hydrogen adsorption strength as Pt; therefore, to uncover the bifunctional catalysis, the performance and durability of DNP-IrNi as an HER catalyst were compared to those of a commercial Pt/C catalyst (Pt/C of 0.7 mgPt cm−2 on Ti fiber felt) under identical hydrogen evolution conditions (Fig. 4a and b). DNP-IrNi had an overpotential of 15 mV similar to that of Pt/C (17 mV) at a low current density of –10 mA cm−2 but with drastic performance differences at high current densities over −20 mA cm−2 due to the structural superiority of bicontinuous nanopore. Additionally, the Tafel slope of DNP-IrNi is 28.4 mV dec−1, lower than that of Pt/C (32.5 mV dec−1), demonstrating outstanding catalytic activity towards the HER (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, the ADT for 5000 cycles was used to examine the stability; the overpotential of Pt/C increased by 55 mV at −10 mA cm−2, while the DNP-IrNi retained its original activity, demonstrating electrochemical stability under HER conditions. The results, compared with the reported bifunctional catalysts in Table S4 (ESI†), confirm the superiority of the bifunctional catalysis of DNP-IrNi. In addition to the acidic conditions, the performances of water electrolysis in a wide pH range were evaluated (Fig. S19, ESI†). Alkaline water electrolysis in 1.0 M KOH provided a low overpotential (η10) of 46 mV for the HER (Fig. S19a, ESI†) and 199 mV for the OER (Fig. S19c, ESI†). In addition, for neutral water electrolysis in 1.0 M PBS, low overpotentials (η10) of 78 and 263 mV were shown for the HER and OER, respectively (Fig. S19b and d, ESI†). Consequently, we demonstrated that DNP-IrNi has exceptional multifunctional properties and can be employed as an anode and a cathode in electrolytes with a wide range of pH values.

For commercialization, the performance of the developed catalyst is further evaluated under conditions reflecting industrial operation.54 To verify the feasibility of the DNP-IrNi electrode, it was employed in the cathode and anode of a PEMWE single cell. As shown in Fig. 5a, MEA was fabricated by sandwiching the cathode and anode with an area of 1 cm2 on both sides of the Nafion® 212 membrane without hot pressing. The polarization curves of PEMWE according to the electrode type were obtained by injecting preheated DI water as a reactant into the anode and maintaining the cell temperature at 90 °C. For comparison, the PEMWE containing Pt/C/carbon paper of 0.4 mgPt cm−2 as a cathode and Com. IrOx/Ti of 0.7 mgIr cm−2 as an anode showed a performance of 0.65 A cm−2 at 1.7 Vcell (Fig. 5b). In contrast, the PEMWE with DNP-IrNi/Ti anode (0.67 mgIr cm−2) has 1.42 A cm−2 at 1.7 Vcell, about twice that of PEMWE with the commercial electrode and even better than the PEMWE (1.035 A cm−2 at 1.7 Vcell) with three times higher loading of Com. IrOx (2.0 mgIr cm−2), demonstrating economic efficiency of DNP-IrNi. When replacing Pt/C/carbon paper cathode with DNP-IrNi/Ti, that is, bifunctional application of DNP-IrNi at both electrodes, the performance is further increased to 1.616 A cm−2 at 1.7 Vcell, meaning that DNP-IrNi is more suitable than Pt/C as a hydrogen electrode. For durability evaluation of PEMWE, the cell voltage was recorded while maintaining 2 A cm−2 for 50 h (Fig. 5c). The PEMWE with Com. IrOx/Ti anode showed a degradation rate of 3.82 mV h−1 for the remaining 50 h after an initial rapid increase in the voltage by approximately 64 mV from 1.969 to 2.033 Vcell during the first hour, whereas the PEMWE with DNP-IrNi/Ti anode exhibited increased durability with a low degradation rate of 1.86 mV h−1 for 50 h without significant initial performance loss (Fig. 5c). When the DNP-IrNi electrode was used as both electrodes (bifunctional), the PEMWE exhibited slightly better initial performance starting at 1.797 Vcell (Fig. S20, ESI†). The degradation rate was 2.32 mV h−1 for 50 h, which was still much better than that of Pt/C cathode and Com. IrOx/Ti anode case.

(e) Performance comparison of bifunctional DNP-IrNi/carbon paper embedded PEMWE with that reported in the literature using a current density at 1.7 Vcell and a cell voltage at 2 A cm−2. (The current density and cell voltage are indicated by a bar graph and symbol, respectively.) 
As an alternative to Ti PTL, high conductivity carbon paper PTL was also tested with various combinations of anode and cathode catalysts (Fig. 5d). The through-plane resistance of carbon paper is significantly smaller than that of Ti PTL,55 and carbon corrosion for a short period has no significant effect on performance. The PEMWE with DNP-IrNi/carbon paper anode showed superior performance of 1.88 A cm−2 at 1.7 Vcell, higher than that of 0.7 mgIr cm−2 Com. IrOx (1.35 A cm−2) and 2.0 mgIr cm−2 Com. IrOx (1.79 A cm−2) as in carbon paper PTL. Furthermore, the durability of PEMWE with DNP-IrNi/carbon paper anode, evaluated at 1 A cm−2 for 100 h, demonstrates a low degradation rate of 0.6 mV h−1 (Fig. S21, ESI†). The DNP-IrNi/carbon paper bifunctional electrode embedded PEMWE had an overwhelming performance of 2.24 A cm−2 at 1.7 Vcell than the previously reported PEMWE performance (Table S5, ESI†). This result validates the superiority of the DNP-IrNi electrode's bifunctional catalysis and demonstrates that the cathode component has room for improvement. The long-term stability test for this PEMWE using the DNP-IrNi/CP bifunctional electrodes was performed at 2 A cm−2 for 100 h exhibiting high stability with a degradation rate of 1.58 mV h−1 (Fig. S22, ESI†). In Fig. 5e, we compared the current density at 1.7 Vcell (which is equivalent to 83.9% of the energy efficiency) and cell voltage required to attain 2 A cm−2 with previously published research studies utilizing an Ir-based anode.56–65 Despite the differences in the operation temperature and membrane type, the comparison demonstrates the highest current density and lowest cell voltage of this work at the given operation parameters. It has often been reported as bifunctional catalysts used as two electrodes immersed in half-cell acidic electrolytes; however, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to explore the highly active and stable bifunctional electrodes of MEA-based PEMWE systems using solid electrolytes.
Conclusions and outlook
A dandelion spore-structured self-supporting IrNi was proposed as a bifunctional catalyst for PEMWE. The initially formed Ir shell-IrNi core structure by H-induced co-electrodeposition was restructured during a constant current dealloying step to give a highly porous Ir-based framework with a controlled oxidation state, namely the DNP-IrNi catalyst. The activity and stability of the catalysts were evaluated for the OER and HER in a wide pH range. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the most active and stable overall water electrolysis catalyst reported under acidic PEMWE operation conditions, suggesting a new design concept and simple fabrication strategy for a practically feasible water electrolysis system. Under acidic conditions, the DNP-IrNi catalyst exhibited a remarkably low OER overpotential of 248 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and maintained its activity for at least 50 h at a very harsh half-cell current of 200 mA cm−2. The characteristics of the dandelion spore structure of DNP-IrNi, such as enlarged surface area, enhanced binding strength with oxygen-containing intermediates, the controlled oxidation state of Ir4+, and resistance to coarsening, contributed to the robust activity and durability. Similar to the OER, very high activity of DNP-IrNi towards the HER was observed with a Pt-comparable overpotential of 15 mV at −10 mA cm−2 and 5000 potential cycle-endurable stability. Based on these half-cell results, DNP-IrNi was applied as a bifunctional catalyst in PEMWE single cells. By applying 0.67 mgIr cm−2 to both electrodes, an overwhelming performance of 6.5 A cm−2 at 2.0 Vcell with a degradation rate of only 1.58 mV h−1 for a 100 h stability test at 2 A cm−2 was achieved. The simple fabrication strategy of small precious metal amount bifunctional catalysts in this work can be directly used for mass-production of high-performance electrodes for PEMWE, but optimization is needed to ensure uniformity in manufacturing large-area electrodes.

Broader context
Grid-adaptable stability of renewable solar and wind energies is achievable using a buffer energy storage system with large capacity and high conversion efficiency against the intermittency of renewable energies. Despite extensive and diverse studies on water electrolysis as a buffer system, electrochemical reactions on the electrode surface require high overpotentials. In addition, nano catalyst-based electrodes are challenged for their stability in corrosive operational environments. From this viewpoint, the existing performances of noble metal-based PEMWE (around 3–4 A cm−2@2 Vcell) are at a standstill, and the durability evaluation under mild condition (around tens to hundreds mA cm−2) is insufficient as an active answer to the commercialization of PEMWE. Therefore, we suggest an easy fabrication process of small precious metal amount universal water electrolysis catalysts with robust activity and stability. A simple two-step electrochemical method enabled the formation of a porous transport electrode composed of supportless nano-frame network IrNi catalysts with exceptionally high activity (6.5 A cm−2@2.0 Vcell), surviving extremely harsh tests of 2 A cm−2 for at least 100 h. We stress that the developed bifunctional catalysts overwhelm the existing PEMWE performances and inspire relevant works.
