    , Accepted 18th March 2020First published on 19th March 2020AbstractIn this work, a nano-sized goethite and zinc oxide hetero-structure (FeOOH@ZnO) dispersed on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets was synthesized for the first time to construct a ternary composite (FeOOH@ZnO/RGO) via a stepped graphene oxide (GO) deoxygenation process. Ferrous ions (Fe2+) and metal Zn were employed as reducing agents, which were transformed into FeOOH and ZnO nanoparticles, respectively, to form a hetero-structure in the reaction. Particularly, the size of the nanoparticles could be controlled by limiting the growth kinetics in this work. As a result, a porous RGO architecture was constructed with well-dispersed hetero-structured nanoparticles consisting of encapsulated FeOOH and ZnO nanocrystals. The FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite exhibited unique lithium-ion storage properties as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Also, compared with the binary FeOOH/RGO and ZnO/RGO composites, the ternary FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite showed the best battery performance as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries and the best photo-Fenton degradation activity toward methylene blue (MB) degradation under simulated sunlight irradiation. The preparation route for the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite is straightforward, effective and has great potential to be scaled-up.
1. Introduction
Currently, energy crisis and environmental pollution are critical issues worldwide. The design and synthesis of advanced electrode materials with unique structures via simple routes is important for the next-generation lithium-ion batteries to ease the energy crisis.1,2 Transition metal oxides and metal oxyhydroxides (TMOs), such as goethite (FeOOH) with a theoretical capacity of 905 mA h g−1 (ref. 3 and 4) and zinc oxide (ZnO) with a theoretical capacity of 988 mA h g−1, have been investigated as alternative anode materials to the currently commercialized graphite counterpart.5–8 These materials also have the merits of low cost and environmental friendliness. However, the rapid capacity decay of these materials due to their natural particle agglomeration and low electronic conductance severely limit their potential application.9,10 Currently, the following strategies are widely accepted and investigated: (I) reducing the dimensions of TMOs to allow accelerated Li+ diffusion and alleviate the mechanical stress from volume changes; (II) stabilizing TMOs using a mechanically strong and electric conductive carbonaceous matrix to prevent their aggregation and improve both the electric and ionic conductivities of the corresponding composite; and (III) synthesizing hetero-structured TMOs consisting of two or more TMO components to strengthen their electrochemical properties.11,12
Water pollution from dyes and other organic compounds is one of the increasing environmental issues worldwide.13–15 Advanced oxidation processes have received tremendous attention because their highly reactive hydroxyl radicals exhibit oxidative ability towards contaminants.16,17 Among the advanced oxidation processes, the heterogeneous photo-Fenton process has attracted considerable interest because it can generate highly oxidizing ˙OH radicals for the non-selective oxidation of organic pollutants.18 Moreover, the process efficiency can be promoted in the presence of light and it has many advantages over the classic homogeneous Fenton reaction such as wide pH range, no sludge formation and the possibility to recycle the catalyst. For TMO-based photo-Fenton catalysts, such as Fe2O3 and FeOOH, their excellent degradation abilities are particularly attractive.19,20 In the study by Zhou et al.,21 a TiO2/β-FeOOH composite photocatalyst was synthesized, which exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than pure β-FeOOH and TiO2 under visible light irradiation. Based on the fact that ZnO possesses a similar band structure to that of TiO2 but with 10–100 times higher electron mobility, the synthesis of ZnO-based TMO hetero-structures is favorable for photo-Fenton catalysis.22
Due to the outstanding properties including high electric conductivity and high surface-to-volume ratio of graphene and its derivatives, such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), they are considered as an ideal carbon matrix to facilitate the charge transfer and maintain the mechanical strength of nano-sized TMOs, which result in an improvement in both the battery performances of the corresponding composite anodes for lithium ion batteries23–25 and composite catalysts for photocatalysis.26–28 Moreover, GO with rich oxygen-containing functional groups can provide active sites to combine metal ions through electrostatic attraction, which work as a precursor for TMO nanoparticles.29–31 As a result, TMO nanoparticles can be generated and anchored on the surface of RGO sheets to construct composite materials.
Currently, the commonly studied synthetic route for TMO/RGO composites is based on the hydrothermal method under the conditions of high operation temperature and pressure.32–34 However, the above synthetic conditions increase not only the cost of the fabrication devices, but also the energy consumption. The, the use of some reductive metals and metal ions to reduce GO under mild conditions provides an alternative protocol to prepare TMO/RGO composites.35–38 Our group recently succeeded in the synthesis of TMO/RGO composite materials with a designed structure for an improved lithium-ion storage performance based on the above principles.39–42
Among the studied reductive metals, Zn can effectively deoxygenate GO under ambient conditions in an aqueous suspension, but the formed ZnO crystals have a large particle size. The formation of large ZnO crystals is unfavorable for lithium-ion storage under high current densities and photo-Fenton degradation activity toward methylene blue (MB) degradation when combined with Fe-containing TMOs. Aiming to simultaneously control the growth kinetics of ZnO crystals and construct hetero-structures with Fe-containing TMOs in a simple and effective way, in this work, an FeOOH, ZnO and RGO ternary composite (FeOOH@ZnO/RGO) was prepared via a stepped GO deoxygenation process for the first time. Few-layered GO was firstly partially reduced by Fe2+ ions to engineer FeOOH nanoparticles on the surface of GO sheets, while the density of the GO oxygen-containing functional groups decreased in this step. Subsequently, the remaining oxygen-containing functional groups from the GO sheets were completely reduced by metal Zn and ZnO nanocrystals with a controlled particle size were generated accordingly. As a result, the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite exhibits a unique structure, where the porous RGO supporting architecture is constructed with well-dispersed nano-sized encapsulated hetero-structures consisting of FeOOH and ZnO crystals. The prepared FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite exhibited unique lithium-ion storage behavior, which was tested and interpreted using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Compared with the FeOOH/RGO and ZnO/RGO composites, the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite delivered the best cycling performance and excellent rate capability as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite also exhibited superior photo-Fenton degradation ability for methylene blue under simulated sunlight irradiation. The preparation route for the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite is straightforward, simple and has great potential to be scaled-up.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
Graphite flakes (+100 mesh) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Zinc foil, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O), anhydrous ethanol, NaNO3, H2SO4, H2O2, and KMnO4 were provided by Sinopharm. The above chemicals and reagents were used as received.
2.2 Sample preparation
The GO aqueous precursor was prepared followed our reported method.43 FeSO4·7H2O (250 mg) was dissolved completely in a GO suspension (1.0 mg mL−1, 60 mL) under ultrasonication. The suspension was placed in an oil bath under stirring for 3 h at a temperature of 95 °C. Brown-black flocculent aggregates gradually appeared in the suspension. Subsequently, the suspension was centrifuged to remove the liquid and the sediment was washed with DI water several times. The collected sediment was dispersed using a certain amount of DI water and was ready for use.
Zinc foil was polished to remove the surface layer and washed with anhydrous ethanol under sonication for 30 min before placing it inside the above suspension in room temperature. The brown-black flocculent solid gradually became a black sediment from the middle to the bottom in the system after leaving it undisturbed for 24 h. The zinc foil was removed from the system and the black solid was collected after a freeze-drying process, and designated as FeOOH@ZnO/RGO.
To prepare the control samples, the sediment after reducing GO with adequate FeSO4·7H2O at 95 °C was washed and then freeze-dried, and the obtained sample was designated as FeOOH/RGO. The sediment after reducing GO with zinc foil under ambient conditions was washed and then freeze-dried, and the obtained sample was designated as ZnO/RGO.
2.3 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Raman spectroscopy data was obtained on a Renishaw inVia Plus Micro-Raman spectroscopy system with a 50 mW DPSS laser at 532 nm. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were observed using a JEOL JSM-7800F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) accessory and a JEOL JEM-2100Plus transmission electron microscope (TEM). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were characterized using an Autosorb-IQ-MP/XR surface area and pore analyzer (Quantachrome). The specific surface areas of the samples were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model based on the N2 adsorption data obtained P/P0 = 0.05–0.35. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in air using a Mettler Toledo TGA-2 thermal gravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
2.4 Li+ ion storage measurements
CR2016 half-cells were assembled to test the lithium-ion storage performances of the prepared samples. A homogeneous slurry was pasted on copper foil as the working electrode, which consisted of the prepared samples (80 wt%), carbon black (10 wt%) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 10 wt%), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was used as the solution. Metal lithium chips were employed as both the counter and reference electrodes in the system. The electrolyte consisted of 1 M LiPF6 in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylmethylcarbonate (EMC) with a volume ratio of 1:1:1. A microporous polyethylene membrane was used as the separator between the two electrodes. Galvanostatic charge and discharge testing was carried out on a Neware battery testing system with a voltage window between 0.01 and 3.00 V (vs. Li/Li+). Cyclic voltammogram (CV) testing was conducted at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 in the range of 0.01 and 3.00 V on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation.
2.5 Photocatalytic degradation studies
In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 20 mg of photocatalyst was suspended in 200 mL of MB solution (10 mg L−1) with H2O2 (30 mM). The reaction proceeded at room temperature and the pH of the initial reaction solution was neutral. The mixture was irradiated under a xenon lamp (power was 300 W and the irradiation distance was about 30 cm) as solar simulation. At different intervals, 5 mL of suspension was withdrawn and analyzed using a 752N UV-vis spectrophotometer with the detection wavelength at 664 nm. The changes in maximum absorption versus irradiation time (C/C0versus time) were obtained, which reflected the decrease in the MB concentration. For comparison, the same operations were performed without H2O2 or light irradiation. Moreover, to assess the stability and reusability of the catalyst, 8 consecutive cycles were conducted with 120 min in each cycle of the heterogeneous photo-Fenton reaction.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the GO and FeOOH@ZnO/RGO samples. Before reduction, the GO sample displayed an obvious characteristic diffraction peak at 8.9°. After deoxygenation by Fe2+ ions and metal Zn, the diffraction peak of GO shifted to 11.8° with a significantly reduced peak intensity. Moreover, a broad characteristic diffraction peak at around 24° was observed due to stacked RGO sheets along the 002 direction. This result indicates that most of the oxygen-containing functional groups on the GO sheets were eliminated in the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO sample. Besides the diffraction peaks belonging to carbon species, the characteristic diffraction peaks matching crystalline FeOOH and ZnO were also observed, as identified by the corresponding PDF cards.

To investigate the component elements in the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO sample, the XPS technique was employed and the wide-scan XPS survey spectrum of the sample is shown in Fig. 2A. Obviously, the characteristic peaks belonging to the zinc, oxygen and carbon elements were detected, and weak characteristic peaks for iron were also be identified around the binding energies of 713 and 725 eV. The atomic percentages of these four elements on the surface are 80.46%, 16.14%, 2.32% and 1.08%, respectively. The low atomic percentage of the metal elements is probably due to the good immobilization effect of the RGO framework and because most of the metal oxide nanoparticles were encapsulated in the ternary FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite.

Fig. 2B illustrates and compares the C 1s spectrum of the GO sample, as the dash line, and the deconvoluted spectra the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite sample. The binding energies at 284.7, 285.1, 286.9, 287.7 and 288.9 eV for the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO sample correspond to the CC (sp2), C–C (sp3), C–O, CO and O–CO bonds, respectively.44,45 Compared with the outline of the C 1s spectrum of the GO sample, the peak at a higher binding energy, corresponding to the oxygen-containing carbon species, significantly decreased for the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite sample. These results indicate that most of the oxygen-containing functional groups on the GO sheets were eliminated after the stepped reduction.
The valence state of the metal elements in the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO sample was also revealed by the high-resolution XPS spectrum. The XPS spectrum of the Fe 2p orbital is shown in Fig. 2C. The binding energy peaks at 711.4 and 724.9 eV correspond to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, and the shake-up satellites at 719.5 and 733.2 eV are characteristic of the electronic structure of FeOOH.46 From the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Zn 2p in Fig. 2D, the binding energy peaks located at 1022.1 and 1045.1 eV correspond to Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively. The values of the binding energies and the energy gap (23 eV) from the spectrum illustrate that the Zn element is in the +2 oxidation state in ZnO.47
The specific surface area and corresponding pore size distribution for the ZnO/RGO@RGO sample were investigated via the nitrogen isothermal adsorption/desorption method, as shown in Fig. 2E. The sample showed a typical type IV isotherm with an obvious hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of a mesoporous structure in the composite. The BET specific surface area was measured to be 148.3 m2 g−1. The composite has a narrow pore size distribution with a size of about 3.9 nm, further confirming the existence of numerous mesopores (inset of Fig. 2E). This mesoporous structure is not only beneficial to supply Li+ transfer channels and adjust the volume change in the discharge/charge process, but also to enhance the adsorption ability of MB, which can provide a synergistic effect to remove MB in the photocatalytic degradation process.
The TGA curve of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO sample is illustrated in Fig. 2F. Initially, a minor weight loss of about 4.5% was observed below 150 °C, which is mainly attributed to the removal of the moisture in the sample. Subsequently, the weight loss of about 8.8% was detected at 150–250 °C, which is probably ascribed to the decomposition of FeOOH and the further deoxygenation of the minor oxygen-containing functional groups on the RGO sheets.48,49 Finally, the major weight loss of about 17.7% occurred at 250–600 °C, which is due to the carbon species being burnt off in the sample. Based on the TGA result, the RGO content in the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO sample was estimated to be around 17.7%.
FESEM and TEM were used to investigate and compare the morphology and structure of the ZnO/RGO, FeOOH/RGO and FeOOH@ZnO/RGO samples. The standard reduction potential of Zn/Zn2+ is about −0.76 V vs. SHE, indicating that metal Zn has high reduction capability toward GO. As a result, only several hours are required to complete the reduction of GO using metal Zn foil. According to the TEM image of the ZnO/RGO sample in Fig. 3A, large oval-shaped particles distributed on slightly corrugated thin RGO layers can be observed due to the fast reaction kinetics. No obvious aggregation of the nanoparticles was detected due to the excellent stabilization effect of the RGO framework. Also, an interplanar distance of about 0.28 nm can be observed in the nanoparticle zone in Fig. 3B, which corresponds to the (100) direction of the ZnO crystal. This result indicates that the nanoparticles anchored on the RGO sheet only consist of ZnO. For the FeOOH/RGO sample, in the TEM image in Fig. 3C, it is obvious that smaller bundle-structured nanoparticles are dispersed well on the RGO sheet compared with that in the Zn/RGO sample. Also, from the HRTEM image of an individual nanoparticle in the FeOOH/RGO sample in Fig. 3D, the obvious interplanar distance between the lattice fringes was measured to be about 0.41 nm, corresponding to the characteristic interlayer distances along the (110) direction of the FeOOH crystal. This result indicates that the nanoparticles anchored on the RGO sheet only consisted of FeOOH. By contrast, according to the TEM image of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO sample in Fig. 3E, not only bundle-shaped FeOOH nanoparticles can be observed with a similar size to that of the FeOOH nanoparticles in the FeOOH/RGO composite, but also oval-shaped ZnO nanoparticles with a remarkably reduced particle size compared with that in the ZnO/RGO sample. This can be verified by the different crystal interplanar distances in the HRTEM image in Fig. 3F. The reduced particle size of the ZnO crystals is probably ascribed to the reduced intensity of the oxygen-containing functional groups after the first step of Fe2+ reduction treatment of the GO sheets, which is favorable for the acceleration of Li+ ion diffusion inside the electrochemically active nanoparticles. Particularly, the ZnO and FeOOH nanoparticles may be close to each other to form hetero-nanostructures with the supporting RGO framework, which are beneficial for an improvement in lithium-ion storage properties. According to the FESEM images of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO sample in Fig. 3G and H, the composite sample consists of continuous porous corrugated RGO layers, which are decorated by well-dispersed nanoparticles with an average size of less than 100 nm. This result implies that the TMO nanoparticles are composed of an FeOOH and ZnO heterostructure and encapsulated by the porous RGO stabilizing framework, which is beneficial for not only lithium ion storage, but also expanding the photoactivity to the visible light region to effectively prolong the lifetime of photoinduced electrons and holes.18

3.2 Li+ ion storage performances

Fig. 4A shows the curves from the first five cycles of CV for the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO electrode in the potential range of 0.01 to 3.00 V (vs. Li/Li+). In the curve of the first cathodic scan, the first peak at 1.45 V corresponds to the conversion reaction of FeOOH with Li+ to form LixFeOOH.49 The most obvious peak at about 0.72 V can be attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and conversion reaction to form metallic Fe.50 The third cathodic peak located at 0.41 V is associated with the conversion reaction between ZnO and Li+ to form metal Zn and Li2O and the subsequent alloying reaction between the as-formed Zn nanocrystals and Li+ to produce LixZn alloys.9,51 In the anodic scan, the first four minor peaks located at 0.27, 0.36, 0.55 and 0.68 V correspond to the multi-step de-alloying process of LixZn.10 The peak at around 1.15 V may represent the reversible redox conversion reaction between Zn and Li2O to form ZnO.7,52 The most apparent anodic peak at 1.55 V and the following broad anodic peak at 1.86 V are related to the deconversion reaction of LixFeOOH.3 Therefore, the redox reaction between Li+ and the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite can be written as follows: FeOOH + 3Li+ + 3e− ↔ Fe + LiOH + Li2O(1) ZnO + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Zn + Li2O(2) Zn + Li+ + e− ↔ LiZn(3)
 Fig. 4  CV curves for the initial 5 cycles (A) and charge–discharge voltage profile (B) of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite. 

Fig. 4B shows the curves for the first three cycles for the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO electrode under a charge and discharge current density of 500 mA g−1 in the potential range of 0.01 and 3.00 V. In accordance with the CV testing results, two obvious plateaus can be observed at about 1.40 and 0.75 V in the first discharge process, corresponding to the conversion reaction to form LixFeOOH, metal Fe and the formation of an SEI, respectively. In the first charge process, a peak at about 1.5 V can be identified. Based on the mass of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite, the initial discharge and charge specific capacities were calculated to be about 1268 and 770 mA h g−1, respectively. Therefore, the coulombic efficiency for the ternary composite electrode is 60.7%. The capacity loss in this stage is highly related to the formation of an SEI layer on the surface of the electrode, which is caused by the decomposition of the electrolyte.53 Also, in the second cycle, the discharge and charge specific capacities are about 770 and 696 mA h g−1, respectively, with a coulombic efficiency of 90.4%. The coulombic efficiency was further improved to 94.8% in the third cycle. The improved coulombic efficiency indicates the formation of a stable SEI layer, which inhibited the irreversible reaction in the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite. After 100 cycles, the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO electrode still delivered specific discharge and charge capacities of about 656 and 654 mA h g−1, respectively, with a coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. This result implies the stabilized structure of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite to compress the large volume changes of the encapsulated nanoparticles.

Fig. 5A depicts the long-time cycling performances for the ZnO/RGO, FeOOH/RGO and FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite electrodes at a current density of 500 mA g−1. The FeOOH@ZnO/RGO electrode exhibited initial charge and discharge specific capacities of 771 and 1271 mA h g−1, respectively, with a corresponding coulombic efficiency of 60.7% originating from the formation of an SEI. In the following 30 cycles, the reversible capacity gradually decreased to 570 mA h g−1. Since then, the reversible capacity underwent a gradual increasing trend, which is attributed to the electrochemical activation of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite, and reached approximately 673 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. Also, the coulombic efficiency of the electrode gradually increased and stabilized above 99%. By contrast, the ZnO/RGO and FeOOH/RGO composite electrodes only delivered reversible capacities of about 468 and 505 mA h g−1 under the same current density after 200 cycles, respectively. The stepped GO reduction reaction using Fe2+ ions and metal Zn resulted in a ternary FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite with a hetero-nanostructure and the size of ZnO was greatly reduced compared with that of ZnO/RGO. These elements contribute to the best battery performance of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite electrode among the three composite electrodes.
 Fig. 5  Comparison of the cycling performances of the ZnO/RGO, FeOOH/RGO and FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite electrodes (A) and rate capability of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite electrode (B). 
The rate performances of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite electrode was also investigated at stepped current rates in the range of 0.1 and 10.0 A g−1. According to Fig. 5B, the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite electrode delivered average reversible discharge capacities of 725, 617, 527, 462, 380, 237 and 130 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 A g−1, respectively. When the current density was reversely returned to the initial value of 0.1 A g−1 from 10.0 A g−1, the electrode delivered average reversible discharge capacities of 241, 384, 480, 573, 690 and 781 mA h g−1. The increase in reversible capacity in each stage is ascribed to the gradual activation of the electrode against charging and discharging. Thus, the results indicate the good stability of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite electrode against cycling at different current densities.
The Nyquist profiles based on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and FESEM characterization were obtained to gain insight into the excellent Li+ ion storage performance of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO electrode. According to the Nyquist plot in Fig. 6A, after 100 cycles, the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO electrode showed a significantly decreased semicircle diameter in the high medium frequency region than that before cycling, suggesting that the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO electrode has reduced charge-transfer resistance (Rct) during gradual activation upon repetitive charge/discharge. This result is ascribed to the excellent mechanical strength due to the good immobilization from the RGO supporting architecture toward the nano-sized FeOOH@ZnO hetero-structure and the abundant generated Li+ ion diffusion channels. However, it can be observed that the ohmic resistance (Rs) increased after 100 cycles, which can be explained by the formation of an SEI layer during the initial discharging process. According to the FESEM images for the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO electrode after 100 cycles in Fig. 6B, it can be clearly seen that the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite still maintained its integrity and the immobilized nanoparticles by the RGO supporting framework can be clearly identified, but the surface of the electrode was coated with an SEI layer. Thus, these results correspond well with the improved battery performance of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite.

3.3 Photocatalytic degradation of MB
The photocatalytic activity of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite was investigated for the degradation of MB with the ZnO/RGO and FeOOH/RGO samples for comparison. Fig. 7A shows the time course of C/C0 of MB degradation by the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO catalyst under various conditions. It can clearly be observed that the MB species was almost 100% degraded within 120 min, while it took about 160 min for the complete degradation of the MB contaminant for the ZnO/RGO and FeOOH/RGO catalysts, indicating the superior catalytic efficiency of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO catalyst toward MB degradation under solar light irradiation in the presence of H2O2. Moreover, the efficiency of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO catalyst for MB degradation significantly decreased under the single condition of light or H2O2, where only 13% and 10% of MB could be decomposed after 120 min, respectively. Thus, the above results verify that high catalytic efficiency for MB degradation can be achieved in a photo-Fenton process for the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO catalyst. Inspiringly, a level of near 97% of MB decolorization after 8 consecutive catalysis cycles using the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO catalyst can be observed in Fig. 7B, implying the excellent stability of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite for photo-Fenton activity.

The superior photo-Fenton catalytic activity of the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO catalyst compared with that of the ZnO/RGO and FeOOH/RGO catalysts is mainly ascribed to the synergistic effects from the nano-sized ZnO/FeOOH heterostructure, which is immobilized by the supporting RGO architecture. Scheme 1 illustrates the possible catalytic mechanism for MB degradation: (I) the degradation of MB begins with the surface adsorption of MB molecules on the RGO sheets of FeOOH@ZnO/RGO through electrostatic interaction and π–π stacking. (II) When the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO and MB complex is exposed to light irradiation, electrons (e−) are excited to the conduction band of FeOOH, leaving an equal quantity of holes (h+) in the valence band. (III) Then the electrons transfer from the conduction band of FeOOH to that of ZnO, during which the RGO framework accelerates the electron transfer and the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is largely hindered, and thus the photocatalytic activity is enhanced.26 (IV) The Fe3+ ions on the surface of FeOOH@ZnO/RGO are photo-reduced to Fe2+ ions or directly reduced by electrons. Consequently, the formed Fe2+ ions accelerate the decomposition of H2O2 in solution and produce ˙OH and Fe3+ ions.54 Thus, the abundant ˙OH and O2˙− radicals produced in the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO + H2O2 + light system can degrade MB with high efficiency.

Conclusions
An FeOOH@ZnO/RGO ternary composite was synthesized for the first time via a straightforward stepped GO deoxygenation process of Fe2+ reduction, and subsequent metal Zn reduction. Fe2+ and metal Zn were transformed into the corresponding FeOOH and ZnO nanoparticles anchored on the surface of the formed RGO sheets after reduction, respectively. The size of the ZnO particles could be controlled by limiting the growth kinetics with a reduced density of functional groups on GO after the first partial deoxygenation of GO using Fe2+ ions. Due to the synergistic effects from the ternary components for the composite, the prepared FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite not only exhibited good lithium-ion storage capability as an anode material for lithium ion batteries, but also displays excellent photo-Fenton degradation activity toward methylene blue degradation under simulated sunlight irradiation. The synthesis route for the FeOOH@ZnO/RGO composite is simple, effective and has great promise to be scaled-up for wider applications.
