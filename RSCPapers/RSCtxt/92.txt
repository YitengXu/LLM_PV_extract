However, the practical performance of CdTe solar cells is often severely restricted due to the deficiency or excess of Cu diffusion, leading to a non-ohmic contact and electrical shorts and thus performance degradation. Herein, we demonstrate an innovative strategy for the fabrication of a Cu-free back contact by depositing CdTe quantum dots (QDs) on a CdTe layer using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique, and find that the average relative power conversion efficiency is significantly enhanced by ∼6.2%. More importantly, the as-prepared CdTe QDs are thermally stable and CdTe with CdTe QD/Au back contact devices show no sign of degradation during exposure to air even after nearly one year. This study provides new insight into the design and property modulation of CdTe-based photovoltaics.
Introduction
Thin-film solar cells such as amorphous and polycrystalline Si,1,2 CuInSe2,3,4 as well as the organic semiconductor,5 polycrystalline cadmium telluride (CdTe)6–10 have attracted considerable attention from both science community and industrial circles because of their great potential for low-cost solar energy production. Among them, CdTe, with a direct band-gap of ∼1.48 eV and a high absorption coefficient, has demonstrated long-term stability, low cost ($0.40 per Wp), and competitive performance in photovoltaic (PV) cells, and thus, takes the market share as the second largest after the silicon industry.11,12 To date, significant improvement in efficiencies has achieved up to ∼21.5% in CdTe cells10 and ∼18.6% in CdTe modules,13 which facilely surpass the best recorded high-efficiency Si-based passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) modules.14 However, the best efficiency of CdTe-based PV cells achieved was still greatly lower than the theoretical value of ∼29% because of the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit.15 In this rapidly developing field, one of the main technological barriers lies in the difficulty to make low-resistance electrical back contacts to the CdTe thin-film owing to its high work function (ϕ = EO − EF, where EO is the vacuum energy level and EF is the Fermi level) of 5.05–5.8 eV, depending on certain synthesis conditions.16,17
In general, Cu is often utilized to improve the electrical contact between CdTe thin-films and back electrodes to form a tunnel contact, and a p+ CdTe surface, leading to a low-resistance back contact between CdTe and the back electrodes in both laboratory investigations and commercial applications.18,19 Despite the essential role of Cu in obtaining high efficiency CdTe solar cells, it still has some obvious drawbacks.19,20 For instance, the question of how to realize a delicate control over the Cu content still remains a challenge for researchers.21 On the one hand, the deficiency of Cu usage will lead to a non-ohmic contact, which significantly affects the carrier transport behavior in the as-synthesized solar cell.22,23 On the other hand, excessive Cu content will cause electrical shorts due to the fast diffusion of Cu into the CdTe solar cells (∼3 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 at 300 K) from the back electrode to the front electrode,17 resulting in module efficiency degradation by ∼0.7% per year,24 especially the rapid degradation in efficiency appearing within the initial 1–3 years.25 In addition, the subsequent treatment in the cell fabrication process often results in an excessive diffusion of Cu into the neighboring CdS and transport conducting oxide (TCO) layers, which will deteriorate the performance of the CdTe cell.25 To address these issues, much effort has been devoted to utilizing various types of p-type semiconductor materials, such as Sb2Te3,26 ZnTe,27 MoOx,20,28 single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), etc.,7 to replace Cu as a buffer layer and then modify the barrier (work function) between the CdTe thin-film and metal electrodes. Therefore, the limitation of back contacts has still hindered the further development of CdTe-based PV cells, a challenge in novel Cu-free back contact design and fabrication still exists. Toward this end, using nanostructures such as QDs as back contacts may solve this challenging task. Particularly, semiconductor QDs have been applied in PV as QD-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs),29,30 and QD heterojunction solar cells,31 because of their tunable band-gap covering the optimal band-gap for single and multi-junction solar cells. Furthermore, QDs possess higher extinction coefficients with high radiative lifetimes,32 leading to facilitated electron fast transfer to the semiconductor. Then, CdTe QDs were expected to be promising candidates for realizing low-cost, Cu-free CdTe-based PV with high performance.
Conventional colloidal QDs as synthesized by solution-based methods using encapsulating ligand molecules usually suffer from the use of toxic wet chemicals,9,33 a time-consuming process and an additional transport barrier for photo-generated electrons due to the residue on the sample.33,34 All of these increase manufacturing complexities and costs.34 So, to develop a novel strategy for the synthesis of CdTe QDs without ligand/linker molecules is of high priority. Until now, several ligand-free QD synthesis approaches34,35 have been successfully developed to directly synthesize QDs, however, they are still associated with some disadvantages.36,37 Recently, the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique has been successfully demonstrated to synthesize and assemble CdSe QDs on ZnSnO4 nanowires (NWs) for PV applications.38 The clean and low-cost characteristics of the PLD technique, which could be exploited to synthesize new types of semiconductor QDs at low temperatures, have created great interest.39,40 Until now, the one-step PLD-derived CdTe QD assembly as a buffer layer to synthesize Cu-free CdTe solar cells with high-performance has not been performed. In this work, a novel CdTe thin-film/CdTe QD architecture, yielded an outstanding improvement in the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), efficiency (Eff), and fill factor (FF), which were all larger than the CdTe thin-film cell with the standard Cu/Au back contacts without purposeful optimization in the performance. This enhancement was ascribed to the contribution of CdTe QDs with a larger work function than that of bulk CdTe, which modifies the barrier height of the CdTe/Au Schottky junction and then forms a suitable buffer layer. To our knowledge, this is the first effort towards the fabrication of CdTe-based PV by using CdTe QDs as a buffer layer that will not only provide a convenient way to improve the performance of the CdTe-based PV, but also suggest new applications of CdTe QDs in solar cells.
Experimental
Materials
All the chemicals and reagents were purchased from Alfa Aesar, and used as received unless noted otherwise.
Synthesis of CdTe QDs
A KrF laser with a wave-length of 248 nm and a pulse repetition rate of 1 Hz was used for the PLD synthesis of CdTe QDs. In a typical synthesis process, the deposition of CdTe QDs was carried out using a laser beam with an intensity of ∼1 J cm−2 under a pressure of ∼10−7 Torr in a vacuum chamber. The laser beam was passed through a lens with a 30 cm focal length, and all the laser energy was focused on the CdTe target (Alfa Aesar, 99.999%). The distance between the CdTe target and the substrate was ∼6 cm, and the deposition time (t) was 10–40 s.
Characterization
The morphology of CdTe QDs was characterized by using a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM). Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a Hitachi SU8020. Elemental composition analysis was conducted using an energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDX) attached to the SEM with an Oxford energy-dispersive X-ray analysis system. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) characterization was carried out using a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54050 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using a K-Alpha X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) equipped with an Al source. All the binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak (284.6 eV) arising from adventitious carbon. The Raman spectra were collected on an HR 800 using a 633 nm laser as the excitation source. The laser beam was focused on a spot about 3 μm in diameter with a 50× microscope objective. The excitation intensities used were determined to be ∼0.325 mW.
Device fabrication
CdTe solar cells were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated soda lime glass substrates (NSG, North America). First, CdS:O layers were grown by RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature using a CdS target (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%). Then, CdTe absorber layers were deposited at 270 °C by RF magnetron sputtering using a CdTe target (Alfa Aesar, 99.999%). Next, the deposition of CdTe QDs by PLD was performed with a t ranging from 10–40 s. Then, Cl treatment was conducted in a CdCl2 and dry-air atmosphere at 400 °C for 60 min. After that, ∼4 nm Au was evaporated on the Cl-treated CdTe surface without an etching process, which was followed by a 45 min treatment at 170 °C in air. Then, the CdTe cell with CdTe QD/Au back contacts was fabricated. In addition, standard CdTe cells with Cu/Au back contacts were fabricated as reference cells following the same experimental conditions.
Solar cell performance measurements
Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) measurements were performed using a Nanoman VS utilizing a dual-pass technique in which each single-axis line scan was first recorded in Tapping Mode (TM) to produce the topographic image. The current–voltage (C–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2636A Source Meter under simulated solar light illumination (1-Sun, 100 mW cm−2) generated by using a Newport 96000 solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The light intensity was calibrated with a Newport 91150V reference cell before each measurement. The error in efficiency measurements is estimated to be below 3%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were conducted under chopped monochromatic light from an optical fiber in an underfilled geometry without bias illumination. The light source was provided by coupling the white light from a xenon lamp (Thermo Oriel 66921) through a monochromator into the optical fiber and the photocurrent was recorded using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research System SR830). Both current–voltage and EQE measurements were performed under an inert atmosphere.
Results and discussion
To characterize the crystal structure of the products, Raman measurements were performed. Fig. S1† demonstrates that the Raman characteristic peak located at ∼141 cm−1 was assigned to E(TO) mode for the sample with t = 10 s, a convincing indication for the formation of CdTe.41 In addition, the Raman band located at around 122 cm−1 reveals the presence of Te by identifying the occurrence of A1 mode.42 The XRD pattern exhibits a typical diffraction peak at 2θ = ∼39.4° (Fig. S2†), which can be ascribed to the (220) plane of CdTe (JCPDS, card no. 75-2086, space group F3m). The combination of the analysis of EDX (Fig. S3†) and XPS (Fig. S4a†) reveals an atomic ratio of Cd:Te = 1:1.06, which is in good agreement with the initial composition ratio of the CdTe target (Alfa Aesar, 99.999%), and also demonstrates a stoichiometric transfer from the target to CdTe QDs via the PLD technique. The presence of trace Te element, was also confirmed by XPS measurements (Fig. S4a†), probably due to higher saturated vapor pressure of Cd than that of Te and CdTe,43 consistent with previous Raman results. To gain more insight into the size distribution of the as-prepared CdTe QDs, TEM characterization was conducted on the samples directly deposited onto carbon-coated Cu grids with t = 10–40 s (Fig. 1a–d). Clearly, all the samples are typical QDs with narrow size distribution, 3.6 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 1a and the inset, 10 s), 4.1 ± 0.1 nm (Fig. 1b and the inset, 20 s), 5.6 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 1c and the inset, 30 s), and 7.1 ± 0.1 nm (Fig. 1d and the bottom inset, 40 s). Note that the average size (∼5–7 nm) of the QDs is smaller than the bulk exciton Bohr radius of ∼7.3 nm for CdTe, indicating that the as-prepared CdTe QDs possess a strong quantum confinement effect.44 Herein, it was found that an increase in t (from 10 to 40 s) mainly led to a denser QD coverage from ∼1.2 × 1012 to 3.8 × 1012 cm2, but had little influence on the size, which can be ascribed to the QD size regulation process via a self-sputtering formation mechanism using PLD.45 The upper inset in Fig. 1d displays the representative high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in which the lattice resolved image with a constant spacing of ∼0.325 nm could be assigned to the (111) plane of the CdTe phase. In terms of the growth mechanism of CdTe QDs, it is considered that the adatoms cannot move and combine with the surrounding ones within t = 10–30 s, following the Volmer–Weber (island) growth mechanism,46 and then isolated islands are formed. Further increasing t to 40 s causes the as-deposited CdTe QDs to gradually combine with those surrounding to form large size QDs and exhibits the characteristics of the typical Frank–Van der Merwe (layer) growth mode47 as revealed in Fig. 1d. In this process, it was speculated that when the grain size is smaller than the critical value,48 the as-prepared CdTe QDs remain unstable and can be easily sputtered away from the surface probably due to the high surface energy; however, there also exists a strong interaction between the substrate surface and the adatoms. When exceeding the critical size, the as-prepared CdTe QDs were stable, and thus, still remained on the surface.

The upper inset in (d) is the HRTEM image of CdTe QDs with t = 40 s (scale bar is 5 nm). 
Since the CdTe solar cells are required to pass a thermal treatment procedure,49 one may doubt the thermal stability of the as-deposited CdTe QDs, which will significantly affect both the dynamics of the interface barrier and the performance of the solar cell. Thus, to probe the thermal stability of the as-synthesized CdTe QDs is very crucial for its actual application. To clarify this, the as-prepared CdTe QDs were also treated at 170 °C for 40 min in air for subsequent TEM observations. Evidently, the as-prepared CdTe QDs were found to exhibit a slight increase of ∼4.1 ± 0.2 nm, 4.8 ± 0.2 nm, 6.9 ± 0.1 nm, and 8.1 ± 0.1 nm in the grain size, corresponding to a t of 10, 20, 30, and 40 s, respectively (Fig. S5† and insets of Fig. 1). The Raman characterization further demonstrates the high thermal stability of the CdTe QDs (Fig. S1†). Next, XPS measurements (Fig. S4b†) showed no obvious binding energy changes, further demonstrating that CdTe QDs are highly thermally stable in air. Interestingly, the thermal treatment procedure could eliminate the excess Te precipitates and then enable the atomic ratio of Cd:Te to be more close to ∼1:1 (Fig. S4b†).
Then, the CdTe QDs were applied as the buffer layer for CdTe solar cells to utilize their larger band-gap and higher work function in contrast with bulk CdTe.50,51 As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the structure of the CdTe solar cell is a superstructure of “Glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/CdS:O/CdTe/CdTe QD/Au”. In comparison, a conventional CdTe device with Cu as a buffer layer was also examined as a reference cell (Fig. 2b). Here, the p-type CdTe thin-film and n-type CdS layers were usually ∼2.3 μm and ∼100 nm, respectively, in both Cu/Au and CdTe QD/Au-contacted devices (Fig. 2c and d). The detailed growth parameters of CdS:O and CdTe are summarized in Table S1.† It is worth noting that the main purpose of this work is to investigate the role of CdTe QDs on the performance of solar cells, and thus no effort toward the optimization of the thickness of CdTe and CdS layers, the CdCl2 treatment conditions, or utilization of the low-iron glass to enhance the incident light transmission, has been performed. As a proof of concept, the typical current density response as a function of voltage (J/V) for CdTe cells using different back contacts are demonstrated in Fig. 2e, and the device characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Clearly, a conventional CdTe Cu/Au-contacted cell exhibited a J/V response with a JSC of 23.7 mA cm−2, but with poor VOC (760 mV) and efficiency (10.70%). Interestingly, when CdTe QDs (40 s)/Au were deposited onto the CdTe thin-film to replace the Cu/Au back contact, an enhanced FF value of 65.64, and an improved efficiency of ∼11.4% were achieved. More importantly, the average efficiency of CdTe solar cells with the QD (t = 40 s)/Au back contact is also improved in contrast with the standard CdTe solar cells based on the results of more than 15 cells (Fig. S6† and Table 1). Obviously, the enhancement in cell performance should be ascribed to the contribution of CdTe QDs, which functions in improving the light-to-current conversion efficiency. By far, the as-mentioned challenging task for CdTe solar cells has been well solved. Based on previous experimental results, it can be speculated that deposition of discontinuously distributed CdTe QDs as revealed in Fig. 1 and S5† by TEM, plays a similar role as Cu via a tunnel effect, which will not only decrease the conventional thickness of the space charge region, but also permits a fast carrier transfer, mediating the high-resistivity contact between the CdTe thin-film and the Au electrode. In addition, another challenge of the diffusion of Cu into CdTe layers will also be avoided. It is easy to understand that since a continuous QD film was formed, i.e., a new layer of the CdTe thin-film was constructed, it will combine with previously deposited CdTe absorber layers by RF magnetron sputtering as a whole. Then, no related quantum effect corresponding to QDs will be revealed owing to the formation of the film. In addition, QDs also affect the work function, which will be discussed later.

To further examine the effect of QD density on the cell performance, a series of devices with different deposition times were fabricated. Obviously, the cell performance is strongly dependent on the CdTe QD density, as revealed in Table 1. For instance, with the QD density increasing from ∼1.2 × 1012 to 2.4 × 1012 cm−2, the as-synthesized CdTe cells exhibited an increased VOC from 669 to 697 mV. Then, the thermal treatment further increases the VOC to 740–777 mV, and simultaneously results in a significant increase (∼7–15%) in the FF and a slight increase in the efficiency (from 7.20–7.75% to 10.24–11.30%). In contrast, the standard CdTe device with the Cu/Au back contact shows an efficiency of ∼10.7%, while a significant increase of ∼1.1% in the efficiency was achieved in the CdTe QD (∼1.7 × 1012 cm−2)/Au-contacted cell (∼11.80%). It is easy to understand that a suitable density of CdTe QDs will lead to a typical tunneling effect between the CdTe thin-film and Au electrodes, benefiting the fast carrier transfer process; while, a low QD density cannot induce an efficient carrier transfer, even though the quantum effect still exists. A high CdTe QD density will lead to the formation of continuous CdTe thin-films rather than QDs, which will only result in the formation of a Schottky barrier. Thus, it is easy to understand why further increasing the QD density (larger than ∼2.4 × 1012 cm−2) gradually leads to a deterioration in cell parameters, especially the VOC, probably owing to the QD aggregation that increases the recombination loss of the photo-generated carriers inside the interlinking structures of QDs and thus, deteriorates the efficiency of the solar cells (Fig. S7†). Moreover, 15 cells were measured to determine the average cell parameters including the efficiency, VOC, JSC, and FF of CdTe QD/Au-contacted cells as a function of the QD density, as shown in Fig. S6, S8–S10† and Table 2. Note that, the average power conversion efficiency was significantly enhanced by approximately 6.2% (ηAV = 10.77% for a CdTe QD/Au-contacted solar cell, and ηAV = 10.14% for a Cu/Au-contacted CdTe solar cell, and thus, ηen = (10.77–10.14)/10.14 = (0.63/10.14) × 100% = 6.21%). Before the thermal treatment, a typical rollover (Fig. S11†) was observed owing to a Schottky barrier formed at the back contact, probably induced by the Te precipitates in the as-deposited CdTe QDs (Fig. S4a†).

To obtain more insight into the carrier collection efficiency as a function of the wavelength, EQE measurements (Fig. 2f) were performed on the devices with CdTe QD/Au, and Cu/Au as the back contacts. Here, two EQE curves were similar to each other, suggesting that the carrier collection efficiency in CdTe QD/Au-contacted solar cells is essentially the same as that in the reference devices with the Cu/Au back contact. Notably, for the CdTe QD/Au-contacted device, the collection of carriers yielded at the long wave-length range (600–900 nm) is more efficient, indicating that a slower recombination process dominates these minority carriers yielded near the back contact. In addition, the decrease in the collection efficiency at the short wave-length range (350–550 nm) for QD/Au-contacted devices may be ascribed to the CdS thickness difference or sulfur diffusion into the back contact impeded by QDs.7
Subsequently, to further reveal the effect of the series resistance (RS) on the cell performance, we characterized the J–V feature of both CdTe QD/Au and Cu/Au-contacted cells as a function of the light intensity. Fig. 3a–c show the power-dependent efficiency, VOC and FF for the two setups of the cells, respectively. Distinctly, for the conventional Cu/Au device, the efficiency remains almost unchanged with the light intensity decreased from 100 to 50 mW cm−2 (Fig. 3a), indicating that the voltage drop across the RS is smaller than the bias voltage at these light intensities, as demonstrated in eqn (1):7 (1)where Jph is the photocurrent, JRS is the voltage drop across the series resistance, J0 is the reverse saturation current, k is Boltzmann's constant, and n is the diode quality factor. Furthermore, at a low light intensity range (below 50 mW cm−2), the efficiency decreased remarkably with the light intensity decreasing from 50 to 20 mW cm−2, probably owing to an increased RS related to a decreased photoconductivity in the CdS layer (Fig. S12†). Instead, the efficiency of the CdTe QD/Au-contacted cell is found to exhibit a typical linear function, as well as a constant over the range from 100 to 70 mW cm−2, and 70 to 20 mW cm−2, respectively. Notably, a ∼1.9% relative variation in the efficiency of CdTe QD/Au-contacted devices is observed, which is slightly higher than that of ∼0.9% for Cu/Au-contacted devices as the light intensity increased from 20 to 100 mW cm−2, suggesting a good weak light performance of the CdTe QD/Au-contacted solar cells.52 Clearly, the average efficiency of CdTe QD/Au-contacted devices surpasses that of the Cu/Au devices, indicating that the RS related to the lateral charge collection in QDs will not hinder the performance of the cell, perhaps due to a poor lateral conductivity induced by the separated CdTe QDs.53 Turning to consider the VOC data, the values of both CdTe QD/Au and Cu/Au-contacted devices show a strong dependence on the light intensity over the entire range, as shown in Fig. 3b. Here, one can comprehend the carrier recombination mechanism by comparing the values of ideality factors, as demonstrated in eqn (2):54 (2)where A is an ideality factor, j00 is the temperature-dependent current density, T is the temperature, and JSC is the short-circuit density. Here, if A, JSC, and j00 in eqn (2) are independent of T, a plot of VOCvs. T will yield a straight line and the extrapolation of this line to T = 0 K will give the activation energy (Ea).54 In general, if the deep-level dominates the charge transport in CdTe cells, A is expected to yield a value of ∼2, while the obtained ideality factor is close to 1, indicating that the minority carrier determines the recombination process.54 From Fig. 3b, we observe a similar ideality factor of ∼1.7 in both sets of the solar cells, fitted by eqn (2), suggesting that the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination process assisted by traps dominates the VOC probably owing to the passivation effect at the interface.55Fig. 3c demonstrates another significant parameter of FF as a function of the light intensity. Obviously, the smaller variation in the FF of the CdTe QD/Au-contacted device than that in the conventional CdTe cell with a Cu/Au contact reveals high thermal stability of the cell performance for the CdTe cell using QDs as the back contact. To further demonstrate this, we examined the VOC behavior of the QD/Au-contacted device as a function of temperature, ranging from 70 to 300 K as shown in Fig. 3d and S13.† According to eqn (2), in the case of T → 0 K, one can obtain the VOC as Ea/q and extrapolation of the VOC to 0 K leads to ∼1.3 eV (Fig. S13†), which is smaller than the band-gap of bulk CdTe (Eg ≈ 1.49 eV, Fig. S14†). Thus, it can be inferred that SRH recombination other than the interface determines the VOC in this study. In addition, Fig. 3d also provides information about other important cell parameters as a function of the temperature, including the JSC, FF, and efficiency. Distinctly, the CdTe QD/Au-contacted cells exhibit an excellent low temperature behavior with all the parameters revealing a slight change over the temperature range. On the basis of these intensity- and temperature-dependent IV data for the devices with QDs and Cu as buffer layers, it is speculated that the introduction of CdTe QDs can significantly reduce the role of the interfacial energetic barrier compared with that of the CdTe solar cell using Cu/Au as the buffer layer. One may consider how a low barrier contact is formed between CdTe QDs and the CdTe thin-film. Besides conventional Cu, several semiconductor materials have recently been utilized to contact the CdTe thin-film with Au, however, the diffusion of other metal elements including Cu, Hg, and Sb, is always required.56

To well understand the contact nature of the interfaces, we use the scanning Kelvin force microscope (SKFM, a Si-coated Pt/Ir tip with a force constant of 2.8 N m−1, a frequency of 75 kHz, and a diameter of 20 nm) to detect the surface potential. Fig. 4a and b show the SKFM mapping results of CdTe solar cells with Cu/Au and CdTe QD (t = 20 s)/Au as back contacts after thermal treatment, respectively. Clearly, a potential of approximately 150 mV higher than that of Au (Fig. 4a) is observed in CdTe, indicating that its work function is ∼150 mV higher than that of Au, corresponding to the values of 5.35 eV and 5.20 eV, respectively. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 4b, the work function of CdTe QDs with t = 20 s is ∼5.50 eV. On the basis of the data derived from Fig. 4 and ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS) results (Fig. S15†), we can deduce the schematic energy diagram as displayed in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a presents the corresponding energy levels with respect to the vacuum level of CdTe and CdTe QDs. As shown in Fig. 5b, the conduction band (EC) of CdTe QDs is higher than that of the bulk CdTe for ∼0.61 eV, while the valence band (EV) of CdTe QDs is ∼0.05 eV higher than that of bulk CdTe, forming a heterojunction. Thus, the photogenerated holes in CdTe move towards the CdTe/CdTe QD interface, while the photogenerated electrons in CdTe will be reflected by the CdTe QD/CdTe interface back to the CdS/CdTe junction region. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes in CdTe QDs move to the Au electrode and then the circuit completes, and the photogenerated electrons in CdTe QDs move toward the CdTe QD/CdTe interface and recombine with the photogenerated holes from the CdTe. Thus, we can infer that such an energy structure displays an increase in the performance owing to the band alignment at the interfaces that helps reduce the electron/hole recombination under illumination. As mentioned above, this also indicates that the introduction of CdTe QDs with a suitable work function contributes significantly to the carrier transfer process.

To further investigate the long-term stability of the CdTe QD/Au-contacted devices, we periodically tested an unpackaged device with CdTe QD/Au or Cu/Au as the buffer layer stored in air for nearly one year (Fig. S16†). Without encapsulation, the devices with the Au/Cu contact exhibited a reduced efficiency from ∼10.7 to ∼10.27%, suggesting slow Cu diffusion into the front contact. However, the unpackaged device with CdTe QDs showed no sign of device degradation, and the efficiency remained almost unchanged, which is 11.82%, (October, 2015), 11.79% (December, 2015), 11.81% (February, 2016), 11.81% (April, 2016), 11.82% (June, 2016) and ∼11.82%, (August, 2016), indicating that the band alignment at the CdTe QD/CdTe back contact was not affected.
Conclusions
Our finding illustrates the first case of utilizing CdTe QDs synthesized by PLD to form a direct, low-resistance electrical back contact to a CdTe thin-film without any purposeful modification, which achieves higher photocurrent conversion efficiency. Our strategy is expected to completely avoid the annoying inefficient/excessive Cu diffusion from the back contact to the junction. The CdTe QDs are responsible for improving the carrier collection within the CdTe layer. More importantly, the as-prepared CdTe QDs are thermally stable and the Cu-free device shows no sign of efficiency degradation as stored in ambient air for nearly one year without encapsulation. This CdTe QD-based solar cell holds great promise for the industrialization of cost-effective solar modules with high-performance and high stability.
