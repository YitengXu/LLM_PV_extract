    , Accepted 8th January 2016First published on 8th January 2016AbstractLow dark current is critical to realize high-performance near-infrared organic photodetectors (NIR-OPDs). In general, organic photodetectors (OPDs) are with vacuum-deposited metals as the top electrode. The deposition of such metal would inevitably form doping to the organic active layer and thus yield high dark current. Herein, we employ transfer-printed conducting polymer (tp-CP) as the top electrode instead of the vacuum-deposited metal electrode. The photodetector with tp-CP electrode exhibits over two orders of magnitude lower dark current density than the device with the vacuum-deposited metal electrode. The photodetector with tp-CP electrode displays a responsivity of 0.37 A W−1 at 850 nm and a low dark current density of 3.0 nA cm−2 at −0.2 V based on a near-infrared (NIR) active layer of PMDPP3T:PC61BM that absorbs photons up to 1000 nm. The detectivity of the NIR photodetector reaches as high as over 1013 Jones. Furthermore, the NIR photodetector is double-side responsive to incident light, either from the bottom or the top electrode, because the top tp-CP electrode shows similar transparency as the bottom indium-tin oxide electrode.
Introduction
Organic photodetectors (OPDs) as promising candidates for image sensors, digital photography, optical communication and environmental monitoring have received tremendous attention from both academia and industry.1–7 The reasons are mainly owing to their brilliant merits of low cost, light weight, solution-processable, large-area detection and mechanical flexibility.8–13 In addition, the absorption coefficient of many organic materials (>105 cm−1) at wavelengths above 700 nm, which are significantly higher than the corresponding values for silicon (<103 cm−1 above 700 nm), facilitate the OPDs to obtain higher sensor sensitivity in the near-infrared (NIR) range.14
Typically, OPDs operate in photovoltaic15–18 or photoconductive mode.19–23 Photovoltaic-mode OPDs are of particular interest due to low operating voltage and faster response. It is well known that dark current is a critical parameter in photovoltaic-mode OPDs. Dark current is the source noise in restricting the sensitivity of the OPD device. In addition, higher dark current means higher recombination losses and higher power consumption.24 To realize high performance NIR-OPDs, achieving low dark current plays a crucial role. Previous endeavors to reduce the dark current are generally focused on inserting blocking layers or thickness modulation of the active layer.15,25–27 In these devices, vacuum-deposited metals are used as the top electrodes. However, several groups have reported that metals would diffuse into pre-deposited organic semiconductor layers during the thermal deposition in high vacuum and significantly influence the performance of the semiconductor devices.28–30 For example, Hirose and co-workers reported that metals (indium, aluminum, silver and gold) will diffuse into 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) films.28 Pierre and co-workers obtained higher dark current density of OPDs with vacuum-deposited metal electrodes that was ascribed to the diffusion of evaporated metal into the active layer.29 To prevent the interdiffusion between semiconductor and metals, Nowicki proposed titanium–tungsten or tungsten as thin film ‘diffusion barriers’ to prevent the interdiffusion between gold and silicon.30
In this study, we introduce a transfer-printed conducting polymer (tp-CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) top electrode31 to realize a highly efficient and easy-to-process NIR-OPD. The device structure is shown in Fig. 1a. Our devices with the tp-CP electrode tactfully circumvent the semiconductor–metal interdiffusion problem. The devices exhibit significant low dark current density (3.0 nA cm−2 at −0.2 V) even without the hole or electron blocking layers. Furthermore, our OPD devices achieve double-side response and thus detect light from different incident directions owing to the high transmittance of the PEDOT:PSS electrode. A high EQE of 48% at 850 nm is achieved when illuminated from the bottom electrode. A comparable EQE of 46% is obtained when illuminated from the top electrode. The detectivity (D*) of the OPD device with the tp-CP electrode reaches 1013 Jones at −0.2 V, which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the device with vacuum-deposited metal electrodes.

Experimental section
Device fabrication
Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates (CSG Holding Co. Ltd, Shenzhen) were cleaned in sequential ultrasonic baths of detergent in deionized water, deionized water, acetone and 2-propanol. The substrates were blown dry by nitrogen flow and then transferred to a N2-filled glovebox. The ITO substrates were modified by spin coating a thin layer of polyethyleneimine ethoxylate (PEIE, Sigma-Aldrich) at 5000 rpm for 1 min from a 2-propanol solution (0.1 wt% of PEIE) that has been proved to effectively reduce the work function of electrodes.32 Then, the substrates were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, the low band gap active layer of PMDPP3T:PC61BM (1:3, weight ratio, synthesized as reported previously33) was prepared by spin-coating from a solution with the total concentration of 20 mg ml−1 in a mixed solvent of chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) (4:1, volume ratio) on glass/ITO/PEIE substrates at 1000 rpm for 1 min. The active layer was pumped for 10 min in the antechamber of the glove box and the thickness was measured to be 150 nm. Subsequently, the tp-CP electrode was prepared on top of the active layer via a transfer-printing method as we reported previously for solar cells.34,35 The schematic of the transfer-printing procedure is shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† First, a piece of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was adhered on a clean glass substrate and exposed to oxygen plasma for 50 s to tune its surface hydrophilicity. Furthermore, high-conductivity PEDOT:PSS PH1000 formulation (Heraeus) with 5 wt% ethylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 wt% surfactant (superwet-304, SurfyChem) was spin coated onto the PDMS at 1000 rpm for 1 min and dried in air for 6 min at 55% humidity. The PDMS with PH1000 was cut into finger-shaped electrodes. Before the PEDOT:PSS film transfer, substrates with the samples of glass/ITO/PEIE/PMDPP3T:PC61BM were exposed to a flash of oxygen plasma for about 5 s. Then, the PH1000 on top of PDMS was transferred onto the glass/ITO/PEIE/PMDPP3T:PC61BM with the PH1000 contacting the photoactive layer. Finally, the top PDMS was slowly peeled off and the top electrode was left on the active layer to finish the fabrication of the tp-CP electrode. For comparison, reference devices with MoO3/Ag electrodes were also fabricated wherein the electrode was deposited using a Mini-spectros (Kurt J. Lesker) system at a base pressure of 2 × 10−7 Torr.
Film and device characterization
The transmittance of the ITO electrode and tp-CP electrode were measured on a Spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments). The J–V characteristics were measured inside a N2-filled glove box using a Keithley 2400 source meter controlled by the LabVIEW program in the dark and under illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). Photodetector performance was measured using an Agilent B1500A semiconductor characterization system. The device was further covered with an aluminum cap to provide optical shielding. Monochromatic light-emitting diodes controlled by a functional generator (Agilent 33210A) were used as the light source. Light intensity was calibrated using a silicon photodetector (Newport 818-UV).
Results and discussions

Fig. 1a shows the device structure of the as-prepared organic photodetector wherein the top electrode is prepared by the transfer-printing technique. The delamination of the transfer medium from the tp-CP electrode is also shown in Fig. 1a. The active layer used in the NIR-OPD is PMDPP3T and PC61BM (chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1b). The PMDPP3T absorbs in the long-wavelength region up to 1000 nm and is a good candidate for NIR photodetectors. The PMDPP3T has also been demonstrated as a very efficient donor material used in organic photovoltaics for both single-junction structure as well as tandem solar cells.33,36,37 The mixture of PMDPP3T:PC61BM exhibits efficient charge transfer, separation and transport. Furthermore, the DPP-based polymer exhibits good air and morphology stability. The processing additive, e.g. 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), is not required during the processing. It has been known that the removal of the DIO additive is critical to the solar cell performance. The high vacuum pumping or solvent washing (e.g. with methanol) has been demonstrated to be able to effectively remove the DIO additive.38 Herein, the PMDPP3T:PC61BM mixture does not require the DIO additive and displays good air stability. The active layer is potentially compatible with the solution-processed tp-CP top electrode in air without the high-vacuum pumping procedure. With PEIE-modified ITO as the bottom electrode, the energy level of each layer is shown in Fig. 1c and indicates the potential for efficient charge collection in the device. For comparison, devices with thermally vacuum-deposited MoO3/Ag electrodes were also fabricated. The two types of devices are denoted OPD A and OPD B:
OPD A: glass/ITO/PEIE/PMDPP3T:PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS.
OPD B: glass/ITO/PEIE/PMDPP3T:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag.

Fig. 2 shows the J–V characteristics of the two types of devices in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination. Under illumination, the OPD A with the tp-CP electrode exhibits a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 10.1 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.6 V, a fill factor (FF) of 35.0% and a photovoltaic power conversion efficiency of 2.1%. For comparison, the reference device (OPD B) with a MoO3/Ag electrode displays a JSC of 13.2 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.63 V, FF of 55.7% and a PCE of 4.7%. The lower JSC of the OPD A is related to the lack of back light reflector. The poorer VOC and FF might be associated with the larger sheet resistance of the tp-CP electrode (200 ohm sq−1) than that of the MoO3/Ag (<1 ohm sq−1), and the interface contact between the active layer and the top electrode because of the different energy levels of the tp-CP electrode (work function: 4.9 eV)32 and the MoO3/Ag electrode (conduction band: 6.7 eV, valence band: 9.7 eV).39

For the application as a photodetector, it is inspiring that the OPD A with the tp-CP displays much lower reverse dark current than OPD B. The dark current density of OPD A is 2.98 × 10−9 A cm−2 at a reverse bias of −0.2 V, which is over two orders of magnitude lower than that of OPD B (5.99 × 10−6 A cm−2 at −0.2 V). As shown in Fig. 2a, the current under illumination of the OPDs (photovoltaic-mode) does not significantly change with the reverse bias from 0 to −1 V, unlike previously reported photoconductive-mode OPDs whose EQE significantly changes as function of reverse bias. However, the dark current increases when the reverse bias becomes higher and leads to lower detectivity. Herein, we calculate the detectivity of the OPDs at −0.2 V. The high reverse dark current of the OPD B is ascribed to the diffusion of the metal electrode (MoO3/Ag) into the organic active layer during the thermal evaporation.29 Instead, the transfer-printing is a non-invasive method for the active layer and provides a defect-free contact.40 The tp-CP electrode is processed from a water-based dispersion. It is difficult to diffuse into the hydrophobic active layer. Therefore, the device with the tp-CP electrode displays very low reverse dark current, while keeping comparable responsivity under illumination to the device with the MoO3/Ag electrode. It proves the effectiveness of tp-CP top electrode for an efficient OPD. We have also fabricated a device with a MoO3/PEDOT:PSS electrode. The device displays high reverse dark current (as shown in Fig. S2, ESI†) that is comparable to the reference device with a MoO3/Ag electrode. This implies the possible migration of MoO3 into the active layer during the thermal deposition.
In addition, the device OPD A demonstrates the characteristic of double-side responsiveness to the incident light, as the arrows denote in Fig. 1a. The tp-CP electrode shows similar transmittance to the ITO electrode. The transmittance of the both electrodes is around 80% in the spectral region of 400–1100 nm, as shown in Fig. 3a. With light illumination from the ITO electrode side or the tp-CP electrode side, the device OPD A exhibits a similar EQE (Fig. 3b). The EQE is 48% at 850 nm illuminated from ITO electrode, whereas 46% when illuminated from the polymer electrode side. It can also be observed that the photodetector is responsive up to 1000 nm from the EQE spectra with a peak value at 850 nm.

The blue line is the transmittance of the PEDOT:PSS polymer top electrode and the red line is the transmittance of the ITO bottom electrode. (b) EQE of light from different incident directions. The blue line is the EQE of light incidence from the PEDOT:PSS polymer top electrode and the red line is the EQE of light incidence from the ITO bottom electrode. 
Responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) are the important parameters to evaluate the performance of photodetectors. Responsivity is defined as the ratio of photo-generated current to incident-light intensity. R = Jph/Pin(1)where Jph is the photo-generated current density and Pin is the incident-light intensity density. R is calculated using eqn (1) to be 0.37 A W−1 at 850 nm when light is incident from the ITO bottom electrode and R is 0.35 A W−1 at 850 nm when light is incident from the tp-CP top electrode with light intensity of 0.31 mW cm−2 at −0.2 V. Assuming that shot noise due to the dark current dominates total noise current of the OPDs, the D* can be estimated as follows:41 (2)where R is the responsivity; q is the absolute value of electron charge (1.6 × 10−19 Coulombs); Jd is the dark current density; Jph is the photo-generated current density and Pin is the incident-light intensity density under its dedicated wavelength. Based on the eqn (2), the D* of OPD A is calculated to be 1.23 × 1013 Jones at −0.2 V when light is incident from the side of the ITO bottom electrode (Fig. 4a), whereas the reference device of OPD B shows a nearly two orders of magnitude lower D* of 2.96 × 1011 Jones.

The blue line is the detectivity of light incidence from the PEDOT:PSS polymer top electrode and the red line is the detectivity of light incidence from the ITO bottom electrode. (b) Current density of OPD A as a function of light intensity at 850 nm. 
Another figure of merit for photodetectors is the linear dynamic range (LDR). LDR is defined as42 follows:  where J and L denote the current density and input light irradiance, respectively. The upper limit of the LDR is given by the current value that deviates from linearity, and is defined by the slower carrier transit time. The lower limit of the LDR is governed by the detection limit of our equipment. The LDR we measured for OPD A was 120 dB (Fig. 4b), which is comparable to the LDR for a Si photodetector.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported a high-performance NIR-OPD employing tp-CP PEDOT:PSS as the top electrode to replace the commonly-used thermally vacuum-deposited metal oxides or metals. The use of tp-CP to fabricate the top electrode not only significantly lowers the dark current density by over two orders of magnitude than photodetectors with vacuum-deposited metals as the top electrodes, but also greatly simplifies the fabrication process of the OPD devices without the need for the high-vacuum deposition or insertion of blocking layers. The active layer containing the low band gap DPP-based material enables the photodetector to respond towards 1000 nm. This is also the first example of solution-processed polymer electrodes used in DPP-based polymer optoelectronic devices. The PEDOT:PSS polymer electrode is highly transparent and thus the NIR photodetectors are semi-transparent and able to respond to light from different incident directions. Therefore, the easy fabrication, high performance and double-side responsive properties of these NIR photodetectors enables promising use for broad sensing applications. Our results demonstrate that tp-CP PEDOT:PSS as the top electrode is an effective means of fabricating a high efficiency OPD and brings us a new perspective toward suppressing the dark current of OPDs.
