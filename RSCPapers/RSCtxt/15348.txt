    , Accepted 9th June 2015First published on 15th June 2015AbstractThe search for new candidate semiconductors with direct band gaps of ∼1.4 eV has attracted significant attention, especially among the two-dimensional (2D) materials, which have become potential candidates for next-generation optoelectronics. Herein, we systematically studied 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1−x (0 < x < 1) compounds in particular focus on the four stoichiometric Bx/2Nx/2C1−x (x = 2/3, 1/2, 2/5 and 1/3) using a recently developed global optimization method (CALYPSO) in conjunction with density functional theory. Furthermore, we examine more stoichiometries by the cluster expansion technique based on a hexagonal lattice. The results reveal that all monolayer Bx/2Nx/2C1−x stoichiometries adopt a planar honeycomb character and are dynamically stable. Remarkably, electronic structural calculations show that most of Bx/2Nx/2C1−x phases possess direct band gaps within the optical range, thereby they can potentially be used in high-efficiency conversion of solar energy to electric power, as well as in p–n junction photovoltaic modules. The present results also show that the band gaps of Bx/2Nx/2C1−x can be widely tuned within the optical range by changing the concentration of carbon, thus allowing the fast development of band gap engineered materials in optoelectronics. These new findings may enable new approaches to the design of microelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
In recent years, the large demands for a new and clean energy and the shortcomings of the current silicon solar cells have called for the exploration of new materials, which can make full use of the solar spectrum and possess better optoelectronic properties. Graphene, a zero-gap semi-metal with unique electronic properties,1–3 is attractive for demonstrating fundamental physics in materials and potential applications in next-generation electronics. However, the zero-gap nature of graphene prevents its use in optoelectronic applications. Monolayer MoS2 was found to have a direct band gap and can be used to construct interband tunnel field-effect transistors, which have lower power consumption than classical transistors.4,5 However, monolayer MoS2 is usually unstable and easily oxidized under normal conditions. To date, bulk silicon (Si), with a direct gap of ∼3.4 eV (ref. 6) and indirect gap of ∼1.1 eV is still the leading material in the current solar cell markets. However, Si is not optimal for optoelectronic applications because of its low conversion efficiency due to the indirect band gap.
Recently, Kim et al.7 synthesized an orthorhombic silicon allotrope (Si24) with a quasi-direct band gap of ∼1.3 eV via a chemical process, wherein a Na4Si24 precursor was synthesized at a high pressure. Moreover, a series of Si allotropes8–11 with quasi-direct band gaps have been proposed theoretically. However, there is still a lack of materials with direct band gaps around the optimal value of ∼1.4 eV (ref. 12) for solar conversion efficiency. This raises an important question: is it possible to design a new two-dimensional direct band gap semiconductor with an optimal gap value? Considering the zero-gap electronic structure of graphene and the large band gap of insulating single-layer h-BN and its ribbons,13,14 it may be feasible to combine both, due to the similarity of lattice parameters and atomic arrangements, to get direct band gap materials with any desirable value. Indeed, Ci et al.15 reported a systematic route of co-depositing graphene and BN domains to synthesize large-area atomic layers of h-BNC material, which consist of hybridized, randomly distributed domains of BN and graphene phases. Later, the same workers16 and another group17 reported a topological substitution reaction that converts graphene to h-BNC and then h-BN layers. These boron–nitrogen–carbon domains exhibit their structural features and band gaps distinct from pure BN and graphene and thus may possess excellent electronic properties, with potential for application in the optoelectronic industry. It is noted that a previous theoretical work systematically studied half-metallicity in hybrid BCN nanoribbons by performing first-principles electronic-structure calculations.18 Their results suggest that the BNC nanoribbons may be considered as potential spintronic devices.18 There is a theoretical study on BNC2 nanoribbon, which shows a rich variety of electronic and magnetic properties.19 Theoretical works20–22 show that BN-graphene domains prefer a triangular shape on a large scale, which is also observed in experiment.17 However, there is still no systematic theoretical or experimental study on 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1−x when the scale of the structure extends to a few angstroms. Therefore, an investigation of the 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1−x monolayer is required.
In this study, we have systematically explored the structures of 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1−x “alloy” monolayers using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique23,24 as well as the cluster expansion (CE) method.25 After establishing the hexagonal lattice type in Bx/2Nx/2C1−x by CALYPSO, we investigate these stoichiometries with the CE method on a hexagonal lattice. Both methods confirm the thermodynamic immiscibility of BN and C in Bx/2Nx/2C1−x. Our analytical results, based on the triangle geometry, further support that 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1−x tends to phase separate. Interestingly, the calculated electronic properties show that 2D BNC, BNC2, and BNC3 monolayers possess direct band gaps of 1.56, 1.60, and 1.04 eV, respectively, which are within the favorable optical range. Our extended study shows that other metastable stoichiometries also have direct band gaps and the values can be tuned by changing the concentration of carbon or BN. Our current results indicate that these novel materials could be promising candidates for microelectronic devices.
2. Results
2D structures and formation energy
Four different compositions of 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1−x (x = 2/3, 1/2, 2/5 and 1/3) are first considered using CALYPSO. The results show that the most stable structure for each stoichiometry has a planar honeycomb structure (Fig. 1). Fig. 1a shows the stable structure of BNC monolayer, which can be seen as isolated 1D armchair carbon chains embedded into an h-BN monolayer. This planar honeycomb structure character shows a clear trend toward phase separation into graphene and h-BN.

The C–C bond lengths in BNC are 1.41 and 1.43 Å, which are similar to those in graphene (1.42 Å). The B–N bond lengths are 1.44, 1.45, and 1.46 Å, which are also close to those of 1.45 Å in h-BN. The similarity of C–C and B–N bond lengths in BNC to those in graphene and h-BN, respectively, further supports the phase separation. The structure of 2D BNC2 is composed of 1D chains of edge-sharing hexagonal carbon and BN, which also shows the trend of phase separation. The C–C and B–N bond lengths in BNC2 are also similar to those in graphene and BN. As the concentration of carbon increases continuously, the inclusions of graphene become much more evident in BNC3. It is clearly seen that the BNC4 monolayer (Fig. 1d) consists of an armchair chain of B and N atoms and a large width of graphene. It can be noted that the ordering of the bond strength follows the sequence: B–N (4.00 eV) > C–C (3.71 eV) > C–N (2.83 eV) > B–C (2.59 eV) > B–B (2.32 eV) > N–N (2.11 eV).26 All structures maximize the number of stable bonds, such as B–N and C–C bonds, which further supports the phase separation. Overall, all the four stoichiometries show the phase separation trend with the common planar honeycomb structural character. This strongly suggests that other stoichiometric Bx/2Nx/2C1−x may also adopt the honeycomb structure motif. Therefore, we proceed to examine the energetics of Bx/2Nx/2C1−x with the CE25 method based on the honeycomb lattice, which allows us to easily investigate the structures with larger unit cells. Fig. 2 shows the computed formation energies of honeycomb 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1−x obtained with DFT and from the fitted CE Hamiltonian. As expected, mixing energies are positive, indicating phase separation into graphene and BN. While thermodynamically just metastable, some of the phases show remarkable dynamic stability in high-temperature MD calculations,27 which will be discussed later, and thus may indeed be regarded as metastable materials. We also calculated the formation energy of Bx/2Nx/2C1−x (x = 2/3, 1/2, 2/5 and 1/3) with respect to 2D boron, graphene, and N2 molecule, following previous work on boron–carbon fullerenes, which shows the tendency of boron to form patches.28 Our results indicate that the boron–nitrogen–carbon system is stable relative to 2D boron,29,30 graphene and N2 molecule. Although the boron–nitrogen–carbon system is metastable compared to graphene and h-BN, suitable substrates might stabilize some of the proposed structures.

The reference energies are graphene and 2D h-BN. 
It has been established in previous theoretical works that graphene or BN domains prefer a triangular shape at large scale.20,22 It is thus necessary for us to consider the triangular and other geometries (herein, it is nanoribbon) for different stoichiometries using the analytical method. The formation energies for the four predicted structures obtained from the analytical model are very close to those calculated by the DFT method, supporting the reliability of these analytical results (see Fig. 3). The formation energies are always above the energies of graphene and h-BN, again supporting the immiscibility proposed above. The analytical results show that the formation energy will decrease as the triangle size or nanoribbon width of graphene or BN increases, reflecting the fact that larger structures are closer to full phase separation than smaller ones in all stoichiometries, which is in agreement with experimental observations.

The solid black squares correspond to the calculated DFT data for the predicted structures, while the hollow black squares show the analytical results for the predicted structures. Other solid and hollow symbols show the analytical results for the assumed zigzag triangle and armchair nanoribbon geometries. Different triangle sizes (L) and armchair widths (d) are indicated in the figure. 
Electronic structures
It is well known that graphene is a zero band-gap semi-metal, while 2D hexagonal boron nitride is a representative insulator with a band gap of ∼6 eV.31 Therefore, it is expected that the band gap of Bx/2Nx/2C1−x will be smaller than that of 2D h-BN. Using the PBE functional, BNC is calculated to be a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.05 eV, as can be seen from the calculated band structure shown in Fig. 4a. It is well known that the screened hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE)32 usually gives more accurate electronic band gaps than that of the PBE functional. Using the HSE functional, the calculated band gap is 1.56 eV for BNC. Similarly, BNC2 and BNC3 (Fig. 4b and c) are calculated to have band gaps of 1.6 and 1.04 eV, respectively, with the HSE functional (1.06 and 0.67 eV with the PBE functional). BNC4 has a much smaller band gap of 0.86 eV (HSE) (0.49 eV, PBE), which is understandable considering the much higher concentration of carbon. Both the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of each band structure are located at the same k-point such as the Brillouin zone center for BNC and BNC4, which suggests that they have direct band gaps. The band gaps for Bx/2Nx/2C1−x (x = 2/3, 1/2 and 2/5) range from 1.04 eV to 1.6 eV, which is close to the onset of the visible spectrum. Based on these results, we extended our study to other stoichiometries. Band gap variations for more Bx/2Nx/2C1−x stoichiometries are shown in Fig. 5. Due to the great disparity of the band gaps of graphene and h-BN, one can potentially achieve great gap variability in the mixtures. The computed results present the possibility of gap tuning over a wide range of values, which is much better than the earlier results for the 2D transition metal dichalcogenide alloys Mo1−xWxS2 and MoSe2(1−x)S2x.33

 Fig. 5  Calculated band gaps of 2D boron–nitrogen–carbon compounds Bx/2Nx/2C1−x. The four green circles are those calculated by PBE for the four structures predicted by CALYPSO. 
According to the Shockley–Queisser limit, the maximum theoretical solar conversion efficiency of a single p–n junction cell is a function of the band gaps of the materials with a maximum of 33.7% solar energy that can be employed near a band gap of 1.34 eV.34 However, the current commercial silicon cells can only reach an efficiency of 15%–20%,35 due to the large difference in the conversion efficiency between direct and indirect band gap materials. Interestingly, the calculated band gap values for Bx/2Nx/2C1−x (x = 2/3, 1/2 and 2/5) fall into the optimum range. Thus, it is probable that the predicted 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1−x structures are potentially suitable for multiple p–n junction photovoltaic modules.
Structural stability
To investigate the dynamical stability of Bx/2Nx/2C1−x monolayers, we computed phonon dispersions for the predicted structures. As shown in Fig. S2,† no imaginary phonon modes are present, indicating that all predicted 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1−x structures are dynamically stable. We also performed first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the thermal stability of 2D structures using the canonical NVT (N-number of particles, V-Volume and T-temperature) ensemble. Supercells of 2 × 3 × 1, 5 × 2 × 1, 5 × 1 × 1, and 2 × 3 × 1 were used for BNC, BNC2, BNC3, and BNC4, respectively. For each stoichiometry, MD calculations were performed at temperatures of 300, 1000, 1500, and 2000 K. Each simulation consists of 10000 time steps with a time step of 1 fs. The results show that monolayer BNC4 is thermally stable at least up to 1000 K, while monolayer BNC, BNC2, and BNC3 can maintain their structural integrity even up to 2000 K.
3. Discussion
It is well known that sunlight can be directly converted into electricity in solar cells. The absorption range of the energy of sunlight is from ∼1.13 eV to ∼4.13 eV. A perfect candidate for optoelectronic applications should possess a direct band gap and the absorption band should also commensurate with the visible region. It is encouraging that all the predicted Bx/2Nx/2C1−x monolayers have direct band gaps and their band gap values can be tuned to any desirable value by adjusting the concentration of carbon or BN. This property is suitable for donor materials for solar cells in optoelectronic applications. To evaluate the optical absorption, we employed the HSE functional to calculate the absorption spectra (the imaginary part of the dielectric functions, ε). The calculated results are shown in Fig. 6.

According to the reference of air mass (AM) 1.5 solar spectral irradiance, the solar spectrum has the maximum intensity in the visible light range. It can be seen that the optical absorption spectra of BNC and BNC2 monolayers are located within the visible light range. For BNC and BNC2 monolayers, the maximum peak of the absorption band (∼2.26 and ∼2.25 eV) locates within the yellow light range. In comparison, the maximum absorption band of BNC3 (∼1.58 eV) is located in the red range, while that of the BNC4 monolayer (∼1.49 eV) is in the infrared light range. The theoretical results reveal that the four 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1−x stoichiometries may be promising candidates for nanoscale solar cell absorbers.
4. Methods
CALYPSO method for 2D system
For structure search, we employed the swarm intelligence based CALYPSO method and the code of the same name,23,24 which was unbiased against prior known structures. The method has been demonstrated to correctly predict the crystal structures of a diverse variety of materials.11,36–40 In this study, we considered four compositions in structure searches, viz. BNC, BNC2, BNC3, and BNC4. The population size is 50 and the number of generations is 50. Various supercell sizes are considered with up to 4 formula units. Initial random structures were constructed by generating atomic coordinates using crystallographic symmetry operations. The candidate structures are then fully optimized using the standard density functional theory (DFT) method. 60% of the best structures are selected through PSO to generate the next generation, while other structures are generated randomly to guarantee the structure diversity.
Calculation details
DFT method is used for structural relaxation and electronic structure calculation. The ion–electron interaction is treated by the projector augmented-wave41,42 technique, which is performed in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.43 In the DFT plane-wave calculations, we use the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof44 generalized gradient approximation. The 2D k-mesh was generated by the Monkhorst–Pack scheme and the density depends on the lattice constant. For each structure, the relaxation is considered to converge when the atomic forces are less than 0.001 eV Å−1. A vacuum distance of ∼15 Å is used so that the interlayer interaction is negligible. Since the semi-local DFT PBE functional is known to underestimate the band gap of predicted structures, the HSE functional,32,45 including exact exchange, was used to calculate the electronic and optical properties. To investigate the dynamical stability, we employed the finite displacement method as implemented in the PHONOPY code46 to calculate the phonon band structure.

Analytical results. 
For (BN)xC1−x mixing with fractions x of BN and 1 − x of graphene, we also obtained the formation energy from an analytical formula by taking the experimental observed triangle-shape BN in graphene (x ≤ 0.5) or graphene in BN (x ≥ 0.5) with a zigzag interface. For simplicity, we considered two triangles (one is just the inversion of the other). For the triangle-shaped BN in graphene, it is either B-rich or N-rich. Herein, the triangle is of size of L and L is in units of l, (l is 2.46 and 2.51 Å in graphene and BN, respectively), one can estimate the formation energy by the following expression: (1)where εC and εBN are the formation energies for pure graphene and pure BN (εC = −7.947 eV per atom, εBN = −7.086 eV per atom). The BN/C interface energies ΓA and ΓZ are 0.2231 and 0.52988 eV Å−1, respectively, which are taken from our previous paper.16

We also obtained the formation energy for the predicted structures by an analytical formula.
Both structures in Fig. 1a and d have an armchair interface, so the formation energy is (4)
Both structures in Fig. 1b and c have a zigzag interface, so the formation energy is (5)where m is the total number of carbon or BN ribbons in each primitive cell, Nt is the total number of atoms in each primitive cell, L is the length of the primitive cell parallel to the carbon or BN chain, which can be armchair or zigzag, and d is the width of carbon or BN.
In the CE formalism, the mixing energies of compounds are fitted by a multivariate polynomial expansion in discrete variables describing site occupancies of a lattice. The resulting Hamiltonian is presented in a compact form as a sum of n-tuple clusters of lattice sites. This permits the fast evaluation of mixing energies for different atomic configurations. The CE fitting of the mixing energies computed with DFT was carried out with the Alloy-Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) code.47 A total of 106 Bx/2Nx/2C1−x structures were used in the fitting procedure. The root-mean-square deviation of the CE-fitted mixing energies from the actual values (the cross-validation score) was 3 meV per atom, indicating a good fit.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, we performed a global search of the crystal structures of 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1−x (x = 2/3, 1/2, 2/5, and 1/3) compounds and also extended the search to other possible stoichiometries. All predicted structures have the common planar honeycomb character. Interestingly, many of the predicted structures possess direct band gaps with values that are in the optimal range for solar light absorption, as well as broad adsorption bands, hinting at high solar conversion efficiency. More importantly, one can tune the band gaps of Bx/2Nx/2C1−x to a desirable value by changing the concentration of carbon or BN. The dependence of the alloy band gap on concentration x can be roughly estimated by the equation Eg(eV) = 4.56x2. Although all the compounds show the trend of phase separation, phonon calculations on some stoichiometries suggest that they are dynamically rather stable and are also thermally metastable to at least 1000 K in MD calculations. The findings of this work may open a new route to design materials with excellent optical and electronic properties.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Predicted metastable (BN)x/2C1−x structures. Four structures for (a) BNC, (b) BNC2, (c) BNC3, and (d) BNC4 predicted with CALYPSO. B, C, and N atoms are denoted by orange, grey, and blue circles, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  Formation energy of predicted Bx/2Nx/2C1−x. Mixing energies of two-dimensional boron–nitrogen–carbon compounds Bx/2Nx/2C1−x as a function of concentration x obtained from the DFT and cluster expansion methods. Blue crosses mark the DFT results, while green circles show the cluster expansion fitting. Red horizontal dashes show fitted values corresponding to those obtained with DFT. The reference energies are graphene and 2D h-BN.	 

 	Fig. 3  Formation energies of (BN)x/2C1−x sheets as a function of x calculated with DFT and obtained from analytical expressions. Straight black line connects formation energy of graphene and h-BN. The solid black squares correspond to the calculated DFT data for the predicted structures, while the hollow black squares show the analytical results for the predicted structures. Other solid and hollow symbols show the analytical results for the assumed zigzag triangle and armchair nanoribbon geometries. Different triangle sizes (L) and armchair widths (d) are indicated in the figure.	 

 	Fig. 4  Electronic properties of predicted BNCx structures. Calculated band structures of (a) BNC, (b) BNC2, (c) BNC3, and (d) BNC4 using PBE (black line) and HSE (red line) functionals.	 

 	Fig. 5  Calculated band gaps of 2D boron–nitrogen–carbon compounds Bx/2Nx/2C1−x. The four green circles are those calculated by PBE for the four structures predicted by CALYPSO.	 

 	Fig. 6  Optical properties of predicted Bx/2Nx/2C1−x structures. Imaginary part of the dielectric functions (ε2) within the HSE functional for BCN, BNC2, BNC3 and BNC4 monolayer structures. The vertical red and blue color lines represent the energy of red and blue edges of the visible spectrum.
