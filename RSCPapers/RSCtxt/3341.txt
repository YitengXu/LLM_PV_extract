    , Accepted 20th December 2021First published on 21st December 2021AbstractAs important personal protective equipment (PPE), face masks play a key role in self-protection during disastrous pandemics caused by the COVID-19 virus and other respiratory viruses. On the other hand, the massive utilization of disposable face masks creates big challenges not only in recycling and sterilizing the used face masks, but also in terms of plastic pollution and resource-saving. So, the development of self-sanitizing reusable face masks is highly imperative. We report herein a covalent organic framework (COF)-based face mask. In this regard, a Ag NP loaded and quinolinecarboxylic acid-linked nanoscale porphyrin COF composite of Ag@DhaTph-COOH is constructed by a three-component one-pot in situ Doebner reaction and sequential solution impregnation and NaBH4 reduction. After mixing the hydroxyl-enriched COF NPs with isocyanate-terminated polyurethane oligomers, the obtained covalently cross-linked COF-dispersion is sprayed onto the outer layer of the non-woven PET fabric surface to yield a face mask with the deposited Ag@DhaTph-COOH NPs. Our face mask is reusable and exhibits solar-powered self-sanitizing ability with excellent antibacterial and antiviral performance via a triple-modal chemo/PDT/PTT synergistic treatment under natural sunlight irradiation.
Introduction
With the rapid global spread of the COVID-19 virus,1,2 respiratory infectious diseases have attracted wide attention. When we breathe, speak, cough, and sneeze, a large amount of respiratory secretions and saliva are released into the surroundings, resulting in microbial aerosols.3,4 These infectious aerosols are a collection of particles containing pathogens, which are most likely deposited in living spaces and infect susceptible populations, consequently leading to respiratory infectious diseases. Plenty of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi, such as H1N1, the COVID-19 virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and so on, have been proved to spread via aerosols in air. This will result in a rapid spread of the respiratory infectious diseases, especially in relatively closed spaces.3,5–7 More seriously, due to the continuous evolution of bacterial resistance and viral mutations, the existing drugs, vaccines, and antibiotics cannot effectively play a role. Therefore, ensuring personal protection from infection is a worldwide urgent yet challenging issue. Besides washing hands and maintaining a safe social distance, using personal protective equipment (PPE) is absolutely essential in preventing infectious diseases from spreading. In this regard, face masks are among the globally recognized PPE effective against infection by aerosols.8–10 However, commercial disposable face masks cannot inactivate pathogens but can cause viruses and bacteria to escape.11,12 In addition, excessive consumption of polymer-based disposable face masks not only results in petrol resource shortage and plastic pollution, but might also lead to a second infection resulting from improper treatment of the used face masks.13,14 So, the development of self-sanitizing reusable face masks is very significant and imperative for the current serious situation. So far, some impressive synthetic strategies12,15,16 have been applied to fabricate antibacterial and antiviral materials, and a variety of metal NP and metal ion,17,18 polyionic liquid,19 organic/inorganic photosensitizer,20–22 and photothermal and electrothermal material based PPE has been reported.23–26 However, studies on multifunctional materials, especially with a self-sanitizing function against respiratory infectious diseases, are still very rare.
Phototherapy, including photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), has captured widespread attention due to its promising antimicrobial and antiviral applications.27–30 PTT and PDT can respectively generate hyperthermia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce microbial damage under light irradiation.31,32 Compared with PDT or PTT monotherapy,33–35 the combined PDT/PTT phototherapy, however, can provide an enhanced biofilm ablation effect and therapeutic efficacy against the pathogen but with less side effect under shorter treatment time and decreased laser power conditions.20,36–38
In addition, as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent,27 silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) can act against over 650 microorganisms (including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses) by interacting with their cell membranes and enzymes.33,39–41 For example, Ag NPs have been widely used in the suppression of multidrug-resistant bacteria by incorporation of various supporting materials (including polyamides, polyelectrolyte multilayers, fiberglass, etc.) into hydrogels, membranes, coatings, and so on.42–44 Additionally, Ag NPs can enhance the PTT efficiency because of their inherent plasmonic nature in the visible light region of the electromagnetic spectrum.45,46 Besides, recent studies revealed that Ag NPs can also lead to plasmon-enhanced 1O2 production derived from near-field interactions between the photosensitizer (PS) and the enhanced local electric field at the metal NP surface.45,47
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)48 with permanent porosity, highly ordered and extended structure, and tunable functionality have recently drawn intense attention due to their potential applications in catalysis, adsorption and separation, sensing, energy, and nanomedicine.49–60 However, the most reported COFs with imine-linkages often suffer from poor chemical stability under certain conditions. Recently, we and others developed a multicomponent reaction (MCR)-based methodology which is an alternative way to access COFs with robust linkages and multi-functionality by one-pot in situ polymerization.61–65 On the other hand, as a porous class of materials, COFs, especially those with coordinating functional groups, can serve as carriers to load and stabilize metal NPs to access M@COF composite materials.66–76
In this contribution, we report, for the first time, a quinolinecarboxylic acid-linked and hydroxyl-enriched porphyrin-COF (denoted as DhaTph-COOH) via a three-component one-pot in situ Doebner reaction using 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-aminophenyl) porphyrin (Tph), 2,5-dihydroxylterephthalaldehyde (Dha), and pyruvic acid (PA) as the monomers. After Ag(I) loading and subsequent metal reduction, Ag NP-loaded Ag@DhaTph-COOH, which can be a triple-modal chemo/PTT/PDT nanoagent for enhanced antibacterial and antiviral treatment, was generated. In addition, a self-sanitizing reusable face mask was fabricated based on the Ag@DhaTph-COOH-polyurethane cross-linked disinfecting coating, and it displayed an excellent solar-powered biocidal performance against aerosols contaminated by bacteria and viruses with convincing activity and recyclability.
Experimental

All the reagents and chemicals were purchased from commercial sources without further purification. 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR and solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance-400 HD and AVANCE II 400 spectrometers, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a Bruker ALPHA spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on a Bruker maXis ultra-high resolution mass spectrometer. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements were performed on an IRIS Intrepid (II) XSP and Nu AttoM. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted on a Gemini Zeiss SUPRA scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEOL JEM-1400plus (120 kV). The X-ray diffraction patterns were collected on a D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å). Elemental analysis was performed on an Elementar UNICUBE elemental analyzer and a Flash EA 1112. Gas adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured on an ASAP 2020/TriStar 3000 (Micromeritics) at 77 K. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a METTLER TOLEDO TGA/DSC between 25 and 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere (60 mL min−1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained using a 300 W Al Kα radiation PHI-5000 Versaprobe II (VP-II) electronic spectrometer. UV-Vis spectroscopy was performed on a TU-1900 from Beijing PuXi. Singlet oxygen (1O2) generation was monitored through a 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) quenching approach. By using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) as the 1O2 trapping agent, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were obtained with a Bruker A300 EPR spectrometer. Contact angle measurement was conducted on an OCA15 contact angle analyzer (DataPhysics, Germany). The photothermal effect was evaluated using a Ulead K-type temperature measuring instrument equipped with a thermocouple. The real optical power density was measured using a Thorlabs PM100D digital display optical power meter. Laser scanning confocal fluorescence images were captured with a Leica TCS SP8 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. Microplate assays were carried out on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax i3x Multi-Mode Microplate Detection System. The OD value of the bacterial suspension for each sample was measured on an Eppendorf BioPhotometer D30 at 600 nm. A Calcein-AM/PI dual staining kit (US Everbright Inc.) was applied to intuitively inspect the state of the bacteria in each group by fluorescence observation, where Calcein-AM and propidium iodide (PI) were used to mark the live and dead cells with green and red colours, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy of the subcellular GFP signals in HeLa cells infected with VSV was performed with a Leica DMi8 inverted microscope.

The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (n-hexane/ethyl acetate, 1/1, v/v) to afford the model compound of 2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxylic acid as a brown-yellow solid in 89% yield (224 mg).

Synthesis of DhaTph-COOH
A mixture of Dha (26.6 mg, 0.16 mmol), Tph (54.0 mg, 0.08 mmol), pyruvic acid (35.2 mg, 0.4 mmol), TsOH (2.0 mg, 0.01 mmol) and HOAc (6 M, 0.2 mL) in o-DCB/n-BuOH (4.0 mL, 1/1, v/v) was heated at 120 °C for 7 days. After cooling to room temperature, the solids were collected by centrifugation, and successively washed with acetone, THF and ethanol, and then dried in a vacuum (100 °C for 24 h) to afford DhaTph-COOH as a brown black crystalline solid in 80% yield (71.1 mg). IR (KBr): 3348 (w), 2963 (m), 2878 (m), 1713 (m), 1596 (s), 1523 (m), 1473 (s), 1219 (s), 1182 (s), 1051 (m), 996 (w), 797 (m); solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR (400 MHz, δ): 167.5, 156.6, 151.7, 148.6, 147.1, 138.1, 136.5, 130.3, 128.1, 126.5, 123.8, 119.6; Anal. calcd for (C36H19N4O6)n: C, 71.63; N, 9.29; H, 3.17; found: C, 72.50; N, 10.79; H, 3.91.
Synthesis of Ag@DhaTph-COOH
A mixture of DhaTph-COOH (200 mg) and silver nitrate (425 mg, 2.5 mmol) was stirred in H2O/EtOH (25 mL, 1/1, v/v) for 12 h at r.t. The product was isolated by centrifugation and sequentially washed with H2O and EtOH. The collected brown black crystalline solid was mixed with NaBH4 (30 mg, 0.79 mmol) aqueous solution (30 mL) and stirred at room temperature for an additional 5.0 h to afford Ag@DhaTph-COOH as a black crystalline solid (189 mg). The obtained crystalline solid was washed with water and ethanol thoroughly and dried in a vacuum (60 °C, 10 h). ICP measurement indicated that the loading amount of Ag NPs in Ag@DhaTph-COOH is ca. 12.0 wt%.
Photodynamic behaviour
Generally, 5.0 mL of DhaTph-COOH (9.0 mg) or Ag@DhaTph-COOH (10 mg) dispersion in DMF was mixed with 5.0 mL of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) solution in DMF (5.0 mM) and irradiated with visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm) or natural sunlight (50–54 mW cm−2). The absorbance of DPBF at 414 nm in the sample was recorded at 15 s intervals, where 1.0 mL of the mother liquor was extracted, centrifuged, and diluted to 2.5 mL in a quartz dish for UV-Vis determination. For comparison, the absorbance of the sole DPBF solution under the same conditions was recorded. The UV-Vis spectra and the decay rate of DPBF solution induced by each sample under visible and sunlight irradiation were calculated via the attenuating absorbance intensity over time to evaluate and compare their 1O2 generation efficacy.
Photothermal behaviour
The PBS solutions of Ag@DhaTph-COOH with different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg mL−1) were placed under a 500 W xenon lamp (λ >400 nm), where the distance between the light source and the reaction bottle was fixed at 15 cm, and the power density measured with a power density meter was ca. 50 mW cm−2. The real-time temperature change of the sample was measured with a thermocouple thermometer and recorded with an infrared camera at each time interval. DhaTph-COOH (0.9 mg mL−1) and the sample-free PBS solutions irradiated under the same conditions were set as control groups. For the temperature cycling curve, the Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg mL−1) suspension was exposed to visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2) until the temperature did not change, and then the light was turned off to allow the dispersion to cool naturally. The temperature of the dispersion was recorded at 5.0 min intervals. The long-term temperature change of Ag@DhaTph-COOH under irradiation with visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm) or natural sunlight (50–54 mW cm−2) was measured with a thermocouple thermometer and recorded at intervals of 30 min over 3 h.
Antibacterial measurement

Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were chosen as the representative bacteria to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Ag@DhaTph-COOH with and without visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm) or natural sunlight irradiation. All the antibacterial experiments were repeated three times to eliminate experimental errors. Typically, in the light-irradiated groups, 500 µL of the above diluted bacterial solution in Luria–Bertani medium (1 × 108 CFU mL−1) was added into a 48-well culture plate containing an equal volume of PBS suspension of the sterilized Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg). For chemo/PTT/PDT treatment, the mixture was then treated with visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm) or natural sunlight (50–54 mW cm−2) irradiation for 30 min; for chemo/PTT treatment, the mixture was treated with NaN3 (10 µL, 25 mM) to scavenge the 1O2 generated during the visible light process (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm, 30 min); for chemo/PDT treatment, the mixture was placed at 25 °C to maintain a constant temperature and exposed to visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm, 30 min). In the dark groups, 500 µL of the above diluted bacterial solution in Luria–Bertani medium (1 × 108 CFU mL−1) was added into a 48-well culture plate containing an equal volume of PBS suspension of the sterilized Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg) or DhaTph-COOH (0.9 mg) which was placed in the dark for 30 min. Then, 100 µL of the suspension for each group was taken out and dispersed in sterilized tubes and diluted with a saline solution via a two-fold serial dilution method, respectively. Subsequently, 100 µL of the sample in a sterilized tube was seeded on a nutrient agar plate and the bacteria were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C to study the antibacterial performance and bacterial survival rate by visual observation and an agar plate count method. Furthermore, the Calcein-AM/PI dual staining kit (US Everbright Inc.) was applied to intuitively inspect the state of the bacteria in each group by fluorescence observation, where the Calcein-AM and propidium iodide (PI) were used to mark the live and dead cells with green and red color, respectively. For regeneration, the Ag@DhaTph-COOH was recovered by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol, and dried under vacuum for the next antibacterial cycle performed under the same conditions.
Antivirus measurement
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (H1N1) were chosen as the representative model viruses to evaluate the antiviral activity of Ag@DhaTph-COOH with and without visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm) or natural sunlight (50–54 mW cm−2) irradiation. All the experiments were repeated three times to eliminate experimental errors. Typically, in the light-irradiated groups, VSV solution (2 × 107 TCID50 mL−1, 500 µL) was added into a 12-well culture plate containing an equal volume of PBS suspension of the sterilized Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg). For chemo/PTT/PDT treatment, the mixture was then treated with visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm) or natural sunlight (50–54 mW cm−2) irradiation for 60 min; for chemo/PTT treatment, the mixture was treated with NaN3 (10 µL, 25 mM) to scavenge 1O2 generated during the visible light process (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm, 60 min); for chemo/PDT treatment, the mixture was placed at 25 °C to maintain a constant temperature and exposed to visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm, 60 min). In the dark groups, VSV solution (2 × 107 TCID50 mL−1, 500 µL) was added into a 12-well culture plate containing an equal volume of PBS suspension of the sterilized Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg) or DhaTph-COOH (0.9 mg) which was placed in the dark for 60 min. Then 100 µL of supernatant solution for each group was extracted respectively and diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 1% Pancreatin and 0% serum to infect HeLa cells that have been grown to 100% in advance in 96-well plates using a 10-fold serial dilution method with a fixed treatment time of 1.0 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove any residue virus species, and the adherent cells were cultured for another 12 h at 37 °C to study the cytopathic effect in each group by microscopic observation and cell counting, and western blotting. The level of infectious VSV expressed as a 50% infective dose (TCID50) in HeLa cells was determined by the Reed-Muench method. Of note, the anti-H1N1 assay was performed via the same procedure except using the virus-containing samples with a concentration of 2 × 104 TCID50 mL−1 and replacing HeLa cells with MDCK cells.
RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription PCR
Total VSV-RNA was isolated from HeLa cells with a Cell Total RNA Isolation Kit (RE-03111, Foregene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using HiScript II Q Select RT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd) according to the manufacturing protocols. β-Actin expression was detected in each sample and used for normalization of gene expression between different samples. The reaction conditions are as follows: 5 min at 95 °C, then 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C, and 30 s at 60 °C. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by melting curve analysis at the end of the amplification program (15 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 60 °C, and 15 s at 95 °C). The change-in-cycling-threshold method was used to calculate the relative gene expression levels. For total H1N1-RNA, it was performed with the same procedure except replacing HeLa cells with MDCK cells.
Western blotting
In order to more intuitively investigate the cytopathy of virus infected cells treated under different conditions, the cultured cells in each group were harvested by adding 150 µL of lysis buffer. After boiling the whole cell extracts in SDS protein sample buffer, equivalent samples were treated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then VSV-G protein levels were determined with the VSV-G-tag antibody (AB0053, Abways Technology). GAPDH was used as a housekeeping protein for internal control.
Hemagglutination assay
As a widely used assay for detecting the influenza virus, hemagglutination was performed against H1N1 virus according to the established method. Generally, 500 µL of H1N1 solution (2 × 104 TCID50 mL−1) was added into a 12-well culture plate containing an equal volume of PBS suspension of the sterilized Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg). The mixture was then treated with visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm) or natural sunlight (50–54 mW cm−2) irradiation for 60 min. Then, 100 µL of the supernatant solution of the virus sample after different treatments was serially diluted (2-fold dilution) and dispensed into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate. Next, 30 µL of 1.0% volume fraction of chicken red blood cell aliquots was added to each well and gently tapped to mix. The results were recorded by visual observation and captured by a camera after standing for 30 min at room temperature. In the absence of an enveloped virus, red blood cells precipitate at the bottom of the container, forming red-coloured dots due to the lack of agglutination.
Fabrication of the bioprotective face mask
The bioprotective face mask was fabricated by using the Ag@DhaTph-COOH-polyurethane cross-linked polymer as the functional coating to enable its antibacterial and antiviral ability. Briefly, 2.0 mg of isocyanate-terminated polyurethane oligomer (Mn = 3235 Da, PDI = 1.5) was dissolved in 3.0 mL of anhydrous chloroform, and 1.0 mg of the as-synthesized Ag@DhaTph-COOH was added to the above solution. After ultrasonic dispersion for 10 min, the reaction solution was carefully sprayed onto 1.0 cm2 of the commercial disposable face mask surface. It was allowed to dry at room temperature, followed by programmed heating in an air-circulating oven at 80 °C for 6.0 h to promote the cross-linking reaction and remove any excess solvent from the bioprotective face mask (denoted as Ag@DhaTph-COOH@M). A similar process was used for large-area face mask fabrication. The resulting Ag@DhaTph-COOH@M with a COF loading of 1.0 mg cm−2 was stored at room temperature for evaluation of its bactericidal and antiviral performance.
Face mask fabrication for biological protection
Air-borne S. aureus and H1N1-containing aerosols were selected as the model biological pollutants for mimicking the real air environment where viruses and bacteria are present. For the antibacterial test, the S. aureus-contaminated feed water (1 × 108 CFU mL−1) was pumped through a nebulizer with a flow rate of 200 µL min−1. After exposing the outer surface of the face mask (effective area = 300 cm2, equiv. to 300 mg of Ag@DhaTph-COOH) to the in situ generated aerosols for 5 min, the contaminated face mask was treated with sunlight irradiation for sterilization (measured power density of 50–54 mW cm−2). After that, the residual bacteria and virus were eluted with 20 mL of 0.9% (w/v) normal saline and quantified via OD600 measurement. The antivirus test was performed via the same procedure except using the H1N1-contaminated feed water (1 × 104 TCID50 mL−1). Accordingly, the virus survival rate of H1N1 was calculated by virus titer determination. For regeneration, the dead bacteria and virus debris on the face mask was removed by successively washing with water and ethanol. After vacuum drying, the next cycle was performed under the same conditions.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of DhaTph-COOH and Ag@DhaTph-COOH
Based on the model Doebner reaction between aniline, benzaldehyde, and PA (Scheme S1 and Fig. S1–S4†), the one-pot in situ polymerization of Dha, Tph, and PA in the presence of HOAc and TsOH under solvothermal conditions (o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB)/n-butanol (n-BuOH), 1:1 v/v, 120 °C, 7 days) afforded DhaTph-COOH as a dark brown crystalline solid in 80% yield (Scheme 1). Formation of the quinolinecarboxylic acid linkage was fully verified by FTIR and solid-state 13C-NMR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1a, the typical N–H vibration peaks at 3356 and 3217 cm−1 in Tph and the CO vibration peak at 1669 cm−1 in Dha completely disappeared after polymerization. Meanwhile, the new characteristic peaks for CN groups at 1596 and 1523 cm−1 demonstrated the formation of the quinolyl moiety in DhaTph-COOH. Additionally, the peak of 1713 cm−1 belonging to the carboxylic acid group was also observed. In its solid-state 13C-MAS NMR spectrum, strong peaks at ca. 167.5, 156.6, 148.6, and 136.5 ppm corresponding to quinolinecarboxylic acid and quinolyl carbons were clearly observed (Fig. S5†).

The observed powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of DhaTph-COOH (Fig. 1b) indicated that it was obtained as a highly crystalline material. Simulation of its PXRD pattern with Materials Studio (version 2018) suggested that DhaTph-COOH preferentially possesses a 2D net with an eclipsed (AA) stacking arrangement, and the Pawley refinement exhibited a negligible difference between the simulated and experimental PXRD data. It was assigned to the P4 space group with optimized parameters of a = b = 36.1 Å, c = 4.2 Å, α= β = γ = 90.0, Rwp = 2.67% and Rp = 1.71% (Table S1†), and a series of peaks at 3.5, 4.9, 6.9, and 7.8, respectively, associated with (110), (200), (220), and (310) facets were detected. Based on crystal structure analysis, the eclipsed 2D structure of DhaTph-COOH contains quadrilateral pores (d = ca. 2 nm).
Permanent porosity of DhaTph-COOH was verified via N2 adsorption–desorption measurements at 77 K, where the N2 adsorption profile was a type IV reversible adsorption–desorption isotherm (Fig. 1c). The N2 adsorption capacity and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area for DhaTph-COOH were determined to be 259.3 cm3 g−1 and 306.9 m2 g−1, respectively. The average pore size distribution of DhaTph-COOH was centered at 2.03 nm based on Barrett–Joyner–Halenda analysis, which is in good agreement with that of the simulated crystal structure (Fig. S6†). In addition, the 2D layered structure of DhaTph-COOH with an interlayer distance of 4.2 Å (calcd. 4.2 Å based on the simulated crystal structure) was further verified by its high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1d). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 1e) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis (Fig. 1f) revealed that DhaTph-COOH was obtained as a nanoscale material with its average size centred at 396 nm. As shown by PXRD patterns, as well as residual weight and surface area analyses before and after soaking in different media, DhaTph-COOH is chemically stable and can tolerate various organic solvents (MeCN, DMSO, THF, DMF, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, EtOH) as well as HCl (2 M), NaOH (2 M), and NaBH4 (1 M) aqueous solutions (Fig. S7–S9†).
The excellent chemical stability allowed DhaTph-COOH to be further functionalized. As shown in Scheme 1, the Ag NP loaded Ag@DhaTph-COOH was readily prepared as a black crystalline solid by successive solution impregnation (H2O/EtOH solution of AgNO3, 12 h) and metal reduction (NaBH4, H2O, 5.0 h, r.t.) steps. As indicated in Fig. 1b, the crystallinity and structural integrity of DhaTph-COOH were well maintained after Ag NP loading. Meanwhile, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Ag NPs at 37.7, 44.0, and 64.1 correspondingly belonging to the (111), (202), and (220) facets were clearly observed in Ag@DhaTph-COOH.77 The N2 adsorption isotherm of Ag@DhaTph-COOH indicated that its N2 adsorption capacity and BET surface area decreased to 224.6 cm3 g−1 and 259.3 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. 1c), which was undoubtedly caused by the partial pore occupation of Ag NPs. Accordingly, the pore size of Ag@DhaTph-COOH decreased to 1.83 nm (Fig. S6†). The loading amount of Ag species, as determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement, was up to 12.0 wt%. As shown in Fig. 2a, the oxidation state of the loaded Ag before and after reduction was confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). The Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 peaks at 368.5 and 374.5 eV with a spin energy difference of 6.0 eV demonstrated that the reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) was successful.78,79 Meanwhile, the characteristic peaks at 399.8 and 531.9 eV for N 1s and O 1s associated with quinolinecarboxylic acid were shifted to 400.8 and 531.1 eV, respectively, implying the interaction between quinolinecarboxylic acid and Ag NPs (Fig. S10†). The HRTEM image showed that the Ag NPs were highly dispersed in the COF matrix with a particle size of <5 nm, and atomic lattice fringes with an inter-planar spacing of 0.23 nm corresponding to the Ag (111) plane were observed (Fig. 2b). The SEM image and DLS data demonstrated basically no size change for COF particles after Ag NP loading (Fig. 2c, d). The uniform texture of Ag@DhaTph-COOH was further confirmed by SEM-EDX mapping, which showed a homogeneous distribution of the C, N, O, and Ag elements (Fig. 2e). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) traces revealed that both DhaTph-COOH and Ag@DhaTph-COOH were intact up to 200 °C, suggesting their good thermal stability (Fig. S11†). In addition, Ag@DhaTph-COOH was stable against different organic (DMSO, MeCN, CH2Cl2, THF, EtOH, and acetone) and aqueous media (H2O and PBS), which ensures chemical safety for their further bioapplications (Fig. S12†). In addition, as determined by the water contact angle (WCA), the hydrophilicity of Ag@DhaTph-COOH was enhanced after Ag NP loading (Fig. S13†).

PDT and PTT properties of Ag@DhaTph-COOH
As shown above, Ag NPs and photosensitive porphyrin are concomitant in Ag@DhaTph-COOH, so we wondered if it could provide enhanced 1O2 generation. Based on its UV-Vis absorption (Fig. S14†), the photodynamic behaviour of Ag@DhaTph-COOH was evaluated using 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as a 1O2 probe under low-power visible light irradiation.80–84 As shown in Fig. 3a, after the dispersion of Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg mL−1) in DMF (10 mL) was exposed to visible light (λ >400 nm, ca. 50 mW cm−2) for 1 min, the absorbance of DPBF at 414 nm was reduced to 18.7% of the initial value, suggesting its highly efficient 1O2 generation. Compared with DhaTph-COOH, Ag@DhaTph-COOH exhibited higher 1O2 generation efficiency under the same conditions (Fig. 3b), indicating that the 1O2 generation ability was enhanced by the co-existing Ag NPs.47 Of note, upon irradiation with natural sunlight (50–54 mW cm−2), Ag@DhaTph-COOH also displayed a high 1O2 generation efficiency comparable to that under artificial visible light irradiation (Fig. 3b and S15†). In addition, the light induced 1O2 generation of Ag@DhaTph-COOH and DhaTph-COOH was further confirmed by their electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping spectra,85 wherein the characteristic peaks of the 2,2,6,6-tetra-methylpiperidine (TEMP)-1O2 adduct were detected; meanwhile, no TEMP-1O2 signals were observed in the dark under the same conditions (Fig. 3c).

(b) Comparison of the decay rate of DPBF induced by DhaTph-COOH and Ag@DhaTph-COOH under visible light or sunlight irradiation in DMF. (c) EPR spectra of DhaTph-COOH and Ag@DhaTph-COOH with or without light irradiation in air. (d) Comparison of the temperature increase caused by equivalent DhaTph-COOH and Ag@DhaTph-COOH upon photoirradiation in PBS. (e) Temperature cycling curves of Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg mL−1 PBS) over five on–off cycles upon photoirradiation. (f) Real-time temperature examination of Ag@DhaTph-COOH in PBS (1.0 mg mL−1) under continuous visible light and sunlight irradiation. The temperature was measured with a thermocouple thermometer and recorded at 30 min intervals. Light source: 500 W xenon lamp (λ >400 nm, ca. 50 mW cm−2) or sunlight (50–54 mW cm−2). 
Besides excellent 1O2 generation, Ag@DhaTph-COOH also exhibited a concentration-dependent photothermal conversion effect (Fig. S16†). Upon irradiation with visible light (500 W xenon lamp, λ >400 nm, ca. 50 mW cm−2) for 30 min, the system temperature of Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg mL−1) in PBS increased from 25 to 42 °C (ΔT = 17 °C), while those of the pure PBS and the PBS solution of DhaTph-COOH (0.9 mg mL−1) increased by 5 and 14 °C, respectively (Fig. 3d). Thus, the combined effect of Ag NPs and porphyrin indeed led to higher photothermal conversion efficiency.45,46 Of note, Ag@DhaTph-COOH displayed a similar photothermal conversion effect upon natural sunlight irradiation (50–54 mW cm−2), and a temperature increase of ΔT = 18 °C was observed under the given conditions (Fig. S16†). As shown in Fig. 3e, Ag@DhaTph-COOH possessed excellent photothermal stability, and its photothermal heating efficiency remained intact after five irradiation (30 min, 500 W xenon lamp, λ >400 nm, ca. 50 mW cm−2) and natural cooling cycles; moreover, it could maintain the system temperature in the range of 41–43 °C for at least 3.0 h upon either visible light or sunlight irradiation (Fig. 3f). All the obtained results suggested that Ag@DhaTph-COOH is a promising nanoagent to achieve solar-powered combined treatment for the self-sanitizing application as needed.
Antibacterial ability
The antibacterial ability of Ag@DhaTph-COOH or DhaTph-COOH was first evaluated with Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a model strain against Gram-negative bacteria. The viability of bacteria was determined by the optical density at 600 nm (OD600). As shown in Fig. 4a, the antibacterial activities of Ag@DhaTph-COOH and DhaTph-COOH against E. coli (1 × 108 CFU mL−1) are concentration-dependent under visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm) irradiation, and the E. coli survival rates proportionally decreased with increasing dosage. Compared with DhaTph-COOH, the Ag NP loaded Ag@DhaTph-COOH showed a higher antibacterial activity. For example, the E. coli survival rate of the Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg) treated group decreased to 1% within 30 min, while an equivalent amount of the DhaTph-COOH (0.9 mg) treated group afforded a 30% survival rate under the same conditions. Therefore, the Ag NP loaded Ag@DhaTph-COOH is a more effective antibacterial nanoagent under the given conditions. In addition, the effect of Ag NP loading amount on antibacterial efficiency was investigated, where Ag@DhaTph-COOH with 3.3 and 6.1 wt% Ag NPs afforded decreased antibacterial efficiency compared with that of 12.0 wt% Ag NPs under the same conditions (Fig. S17 and S18†).

(b) Comparison of antibacterial efficiency against E. coli under different treatment conditions with equivalent Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg mL−1) and DhaTph-COOH (0.9 mg mL−1) (E. coli, 1 × 108 CFU mL−1, light irradiation time, 30 min). Agar plate count and live/dead bacterial fluorescence images of different groups against E. coli (c) and S. aureus (d) under different conditions. (e) Reusability of Ag@DhaTph-COOH against E. coli and S. aureus under sunlight irradiation (50–54 mW cm−2). 
To better understand the synergistic antibacterial behavior of Ag@DhaTph-COOH, a series of control experiments were conducted. As shown in Fig. 4b, the DhaTph-COOH and Ag@DhaTph-COOH treated groups in the dark gave 85 and 49% bacteria survival rates, respectively, within 30 min compared to the control group, confirming that the loaded Ag NPs had a certain chemo-antibacterial effect. After being treated with NaN3 (1O2 depletion agent), Ag@DhaTph-COOH, however, gave only a 42% E. coli survival rate under light irradiation within 30 min. On the other hand, when the experiment was performed at a constant temperature of 25 °C in visible light, the bacterial survival rate reduced to 5.0%. All the results implied that the combined chemo/PDT/PTT synergistic treatment was the most efficient approach in E. coli inhibition (survival rate, 1%).
To meet the requirements of practical application, the antibacterial activity of Ag@DhaTph-COOH was also assessed under natural sunlight (measured power density of 50–54 mW cm−2) irradiation. What is gratifying is that it exhibited comparable antibacterial activity to that under artificial visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 4b, the bacteria survival rate of E. coli decreased to 1.0% in sunlight within 30 min. For a more intuitive observation of the bacterial state, agar plate counting and live/dead microbial viability assays were carried out by co-staining with Calcein-AM (which marks the live cells green) and propidium iodide (PI, which marks the dead cells red). The bacteria in the Ag@DhaTph-COOH treated group under visible light and natural sunlight irradiation were red in the whole field of vision, while those in the sample-free and DhaTph-COOH treated groups with poor antibacterial effects were basically green (Fig. 4c).
The antibacterial generality of Ag@DhaTph-COOH was further verified against S. aureus, a typical Gram-positive bacterium. As shown in Fig. 4d, the survival rate of S. aureus (1 × 108 CFU mL−1) was reduced to 1.0% in the Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg) treated group under both visible and sunlight irradiation for 30 min (Fig. S19†).
In addition, the antibacterial recyclability of Ag@DhaTph-COOH was also examined. After each run, it could be readily recovered by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol, and dried under vacuum for the next antibacterial cycle. Notably, Ag@DhaTph-COOH was robust and could be used at least five times without loss of its excellent antibacterial activity against E. coli (≥97%) and S. aureus (≥96%) under the given conditions (Fig. 4e). The PXRD pattern indicated that its crystallinity and structural features were well maintained (Fig. S20†). Therefore, Ag@DhaTph-COOH could be a potential multifunctional and reusable antibacterial nanoagent against a broad bacterial spectrum under natural sunlight irradiation.
Antiviral activity
Antiviral function, i.e. killing or inactivating viruses, is another essential requirement for bioprotective materials, especially for the increasingly viral outbreak that the public is facing today. As is well known, the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is typically used to study the properties of RNA viruses and perform antiviral research.86 Meanwhile, the influenza A virus subtype H1N1(A/H1N1) is the representative respiratory infection-causing virus.87,88 So, they were selected as the model viruses to evaluate the antiviral performance of Ag@DhaTph-COOH. The survival rates of VSV and H1N1 were characterized and quantified by further infecting HeLa and MDCK cells, respectively. The number of infectious viruses expressed as the 50% infective dose (TCID50) in cells was determined by the Reed-Muench method. When the VSV sample (2 × 107 TCID50 mL−1, 500 µL) was treated with Ag@DhaTph-COOH at different dosages under light irradiation (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm), the virus amount was gradually reduced, and about 100% VSV was inactivated by Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg mL−1) in 60 min, while an equivalent amount of DhaTph-COOH gave only a ca. 78% antiviral efficiency under the same conditions (Fig. 5a). In addition, the antiviral efficiency had a positive relationship with the Ag loading amount in Ag@DhaTph-COOH under both visible light (ca. 50 mW cm−2, λ >400 nm) irradiation and dark conditions. (Fig. S21†). As indicated in Fig. 5b, DhaTph-COOH showed a ca. 6% antiviral efficiency in the dark, while Ag@DhaTph-COOH, exhibited a ca. 40% antiviral efficiency under the same conditions, implying that Ag NPs played their role in antiviral action. Upon visible light irradiation, Ag@DhaTph-COOH provided 53% (with NaN3) and 86% (at 25 °C) antiviral efficiencies, respectively, implying that the chemo/PTT and chemo/PDT combined treatments showed much better anti-virus capabilities, but they were all worse than that of the triple-modal chemo/PDT/PTT antiviral treatment (antiviral efficiency up to 100%, Fig. 5b).

(b) Comparison of the titers of VSV with different treatments. (c) Immunofluorescence assay of VSV-infected HeLa cells after treatment under different conditions. (d) Detection of VSV protein expression through western blotting. (e) VSV-RNA and H1N1-RNA under different treatment conditions. (f) Reusability of Ag@DhaTph-COOH against VSV and H1N1 viruses under sunlight conditions (50–54 mW cm−2). 
To our delight, Ag@DhaTph-COOH also showed an excellent antiviral effect upon natural sunlight irradiation, and VSVs were completely killed within 60 min (Fig. 5b). Fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that the GFP signals of the VSV infected HeLa cells treated with Ag@DhaTph-COOH were invisible in both visible light and sunlight, implying that all the VSVs were killed by Ag@DhaTph-COOH (Fig. 5c and S22†). In contrast, the green fluorescence of GFP in the DhaTph-COOH and Ag@DhaTph-COOH treated groups with single- and dual-modal treatments was still visible, further verifying that the combined chemo/PDT/PTT triple-modal treatment was more effective. This observation was also proved by the western blotting result. Compared with the control groups, Ag@DhaTph-COOH treated group in the dark, Ag@DhaTph-COOH treated group with NaN3 under light irradiation, and Ag@DhaTph-COOH treated group at 25 °C under light irradiation, no protein expression of VSV was detected in the Ag@DhaTph-COOH treated group under both visible light and sunlight irradiation (Fig. 5d and S23†).
Besides, the antiviral activity of Ag@DhaTph-COOH toward H1N1, a more infectious epidemic virus, was evaluated by determining the amount of H1N1 based on a standard hemagglutination assay (HA).89 After the virus-containing samples (500 µL, 2 × 104 TCID50 mL−1) were treated with the sterilized Ag@DhaTph-COOH (1.0 mg) in PBS (500 µL) under visible light (λ >400 nm, ca. 50 mW cm−2) and natural sunlight (50–54 mW cm−2) irradiation for 60 min, respectively, the diluted (100 µL) samples were then incubated with chicken red blood cells (RBCs, 30 µL, 1.0% volume fraction) in microtiter plates after 30 min at room temperature. The obtained agglutination patterns revealed that the RBCs formed red spots at the bottom of the well in the Ag@DhaTph-COOH treated groups under light irradiation, while the groups without Ag@DhaTph-COOH or light irradiation gave a cloudy appearance due to agglutination (Fig. S24†).
As a more accurate method of quantitative characterization, RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription PCR were conducted, and the relative gene expression levels of total VSV- and H1N1-RNA were calculated based on the manufacturing protocols (Fig. 5e). The obtained results were in good agreement with those determined from TCID50 measurement in both anti-virus assays against VSV and H1N1. In addition, Ag@DhaTph-COOH could be easily recovered by centrifugation. After washing with water and ethanol, and vacuum drying, it was reused for the next antiviral round. As shown in Fig. 5f, the antiviral efficiency of Ag@DhaTph-COOH against VSV and H1N1 still reached 96% in the fifth antiviral cycle under the given conditions without loss of its structural features and crystallinity (Fig. S20†).
Fabrication of the Ag@DhaTph-COOH-based face mask and its bioprotective application
The face mask with natural sunlight-triggered self-sanitizing functionality was prepared by depositing the nanoscale Ag@DhaTph-COOH onto the outer layer of the disposable non-woven face mask via a solution spraying approach. As depicted in Scheme 1b, after mixing the hydroxyl-enriched Ag@DhaTph-COOH NPs with the isocyanate-terminated polyurethane oligomers in anhydrous chloroform, the obtained dispersion was carefully sprayed onto the non-woven PET fabric surface with an effective contact area of 300 cm2. Upon drying in an air-circulating oven (80 °C, 6.0 h), the Ag@DhaTph-COOH-based elastic face mask (denoted as Ag@DhaTph-COOH@M) was fabricated. The reaction between the hydroxyl in Ag@DhaTph-COOH and the isocyanate on the polyurethane (PU) oligomer could readily afford the PU cross-linked hybrid coating, which was confirmed by the FTIR spectrum (Fig. S25†). The PXRD pattern of the Ag@DhaTph-COOH@M showed that the COF structural integrity and crystallinity were well maintained in the composite material (Fig. S26†). As the non-woven fibres and polymer matrix did not significantly contribute to the surface area, the Ag@DhaTph-COOH@M showed a decreased N2 adsorption capacity (50.7 cm3 g−1) and a lower BET value (69.6 m2 g−1) than those of Ag@DhaTph-COOH crystals (Fig. S27†). The good thermal stability of Ag@DhaTph-COOH@M was verified by TGA (Fig. S28†). As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the non-woven fibers were covered with a high-density Ag@DhaTph-COOH coating, and the Ag@DhaTph-COOH NPs homogeneously blended in the polyurethane matrix without any detectable interface boundary (Fig. 6c).

(g) Contaminating Ag@DhaTph-COOH@M using a nebulizer containing bacteria and virus aerosols. (h and i) Antibacterial and antiviral efficiency. (j) Reusability. 
In addition, the dense packing of the COF NPs was clearly observed in the cross-section image of the face mask cloth (Fig. 6d), and as depicted from the cross section of the stripped film, the COF-containing coating was about 10 µm in thickness (Fig. S29†). SEM-EDX elemental mapping indicated that the C, N, O, and Ag species were homogeneously dispersed in the outer layer of Ag@DhaTph-COOH@M (Fig. 6d). In comparison with the hydrophilic Ag@DhaTph-COOH (WCA <5.0°), the hydrophobicity of the Ag@DhaTph-COOH@M (WCA = 102 ± 2°) was significantly enhanced due to the involved hydrophobic polyurethane species and the rough surface structure (Fig. S30†). The hydrophobic face mask, however, would effectively prevent aqueous droplet adhesion, thus improving its long-term filtration performance. Fig. 6e and f show our Ag@DhaTph-COOH@M prototype prepared by the spraying method. For practical application, its bio-protective function was assessed. We selected airborne S. aureus and typical influenza A/H1N1-containing aerosols as the model biological pollutants for mimicking the real contaminated air environment where viruses and bacteria are present. When the S. aureus (1 × 108 CFU mL−1) and A/H1N1 (1 × 104 TCID50 mL−1) solutions were pumped through the nebulizer with a flow rate of 200 µL min−1, a continuous aerosol flow was generated which contaminated the external surface of the face mask (Fig. 6g). After 5 min, the contaminated face mask was exposed to natural sunlight (50–54 mW cm−2) for a self-sterilizing test. As shown in Fig. 6h,i, all the S. aureus and A/H1N1 species were inactivated within 35 and 60 min, respectively, under sunlight irradiation (Fig. S31†). In addition, due to the heavily loaded Ag NPs, Ag@DhaTph-COOH@M also exhibited certain bactericidal and antiviral capabilities in the dark. In comparison, most bacteria and viruses loaded on a commercial face mask (CM) maintained their viability under light irradiation and in the dark as assessed with OD600 measurement, a live/dead viability kit, H1N1-RNA determination, and a hemagglutination assay (Fig. 6h, i, S32 and S33†). In addition, the contaminated face mask could be easily regenerated by washing with water and ethanol, and vacuum drying; as such, it could be reused at least five times, and its antibacterial and antiviral efficiencies still reached 96 and 95% in the fifth run (Fig. 6j) without loss of structural integrity and crystallinity during the recycling process (Fig. S34–S36†). Besides, the static breathing resistance was examined using an automatic test device, and the exhalation resistance (ER) and inhalation resistance (IR) of our face mask were 67.5 and 90.2 Pa, respectively, which lie between those of disposable commercial (52.8 and 80.4 Pa) and N95 (76.1 and 92.2 Pa) face masks, indicating its good breathability.90
Conclusions
In summary, an Ag NP loaded and quinoline-4-carboxylic acid-linked and hydroxyl-enriched porphyrin COF was successfully constructed via a three-component one-pot in situ Doebner reaction and sequential solution impregnation and NaBH4 reduction. The obtained Ag@DhaTph-COOH exhibited multifunctional bactericidal and antiviral activity via a triple-modal chemo/PDT/PTT synergistic treatment under natural sunlight irradiation. More importantly, the hydroxyl-enriched Ag@DhaTph-COOH, together with the isocyanate-terminated polyurethane oligomer, can be used to fabricate a multifunctional and reusable face mask by a facile spray approach. We hope that this work will not only enrich the synthetic methodology and expand COF application, but will also provide some clues for the fabrication of other solar-powered reusable personal protective equipment (PPE). This would be especially significant for the current difficult situation caused by the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus and other respiratory viruses.
