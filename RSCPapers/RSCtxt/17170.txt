    , Accepted 18th February 2015First published on 24th February 2015AbstractThe use of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), especially those with a core/shell structure, for photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production from water is currently one of the hottest research fields. Although the ligand on the semiconductor NC surface is crucial to the optical and optoelectronic properties of the NC, the study of the ligand effect on the photocatalytic activity of H2 generation is rarely reported. Herein, we employ nearly monodispersed CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs as a model photocatalytic system, and three kinds of ligands with different numbers of functional thiol groups (i.e., poly(acrylic acid), 3-mercaptopropionic acid and 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) are selected as the ligands to investigate the effect of ligand on the efficiency of H2 photogeneration. The results show that the H2 photogeneration efficiency is highly dependent on the surface ligand of the NCs, and it increases with the increase of the number of the functional thiol groups in the ligand, and correspondingly, the photoluminescence intensity and average fluorescence lifetime, which are measured by steady state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements, are decreased. The surface trap-related charge separation efficiency, which is mediated by surface coating with different ligands, is supposed to cause the distinct ligand-dependent performance in the H2 evolution.
Introduction
The utilization of solar energy to produce hydrogen (H2), an environmentally benign energy source with the highest specific energy of combustion, from water is considered to be a promising route to solve the problems of energy shortage and air pollution.1–4 To realize efficient and cost-effective conversion, multi-component H2-producing artificial (HPA) systems, which are normally composed of a light absorber, a catalyst and a hole scavenger, have been intensively investigated.2,5–18 With the merits of superior photostability, consecutive tunable electronic states and optical properties and a large absorption cross-section over a broad spectral range,19,20 colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have been elected as good candidates for light absorbers. Among the heterogeneous semiconductor NCs, such as CdS/CdSe,18 CdSe/CdS21 and CdSe/ZnS15 core/shell quantum dots (QDs), CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod nanorods9,22–24 have gained specific interest due to its reduced charge recombination and improved charge separation behaviors, which eventually increase the overall H2 evolution efficiencies of the HPA systems.
To date, despite enormous efforts that have been made in the design of semiconductor NCs with different compositions as light absorbers to increase the H2 evolution efficiency of the HPA system, little consideration is given to the ligand effect of semiconductor NCs on the H2 evolution efficiency of the HPA system.25,26 It is known that ligand exchange with various types of ligands could significantly tune the photoluminescence, optoelectronic and charge transport properties of semiconductor NCs.27–34 We, therefore, suspect that chemical modifications of semiconductor NCs with different types of ligands may have pronounced effects on the H2 evolution efficiency of the corresponding HPA systems.
In this work, we systematically investigated the effect of the ligands on the H2 photogeneration efficiency of the QD-based HPA systems. CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs was chosen as a model system due to the significantly higher photocatalytic activity for H2 generation compared to that of the single-component CdSe QDs.21 The original organic ligand capped CdSe/CdS QDs were transferred to aqueous solution for water splitting by the reported methods with some modifications.35–38 Three types of ligands with different numbers of thiol functional groups (see Scheme 1) were employed in this study to investigate their influences on the efficiency of H2 photogeneration. The detailed analyses of the fluorescence intensity, decay kinetics measurements and electron transfer (ET) behaviors, coupled with the corresponding H2 photogeneration results, helped us to propose a possible mechanism to explain the strong ligand effect on the photocatalytic efficiency of the HPA system.

Experimental
Chemicals
Cadmium oxide (CdO, 99.998%), sulfur (99.5%, powder, 100 mesh) and NiCl2·6H2O (99.9998%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%) was obtained from Aladdin. Selenium (99.5%, 100 mesh), oleic acid (OA, technical grade, 90%), octadecylamine (ODA, 90%), 1-octadecene (ODE, technical grade, 90%), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA, average Mw = ∼1800), meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, ∼98%), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA, ≥99%) and Rhodamine 6G (R6G) (Dye content 99%) were purchased from Aldrich.

Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36%–38%) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≥96%) were purchased from Beijing Chemicals. Diethylene glycol (DEG, CP) was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. All the chemicals were used as supplied without any further purification.
Synthesis of CdSe core nanocrystals (NCs)
The synthesis was carried out according to a previous method.39 In a typical synthesis, 0.2 mmol of CdO, 0.6 mmol of OA, and 4 mL of ODE were mixed in a 25 mL three-neck flask, and then the mixture was heated until the solution became clear and colorless. Subsequently, the solution was cooled down to 160 °C, and at that temperature, 0.7 g of ODA was added into the flask. The solution was subsequently heated to 240 °C under nitrogen protection, and at this point, 1 mL of ODE solution containing 0.1 mmol of selenium and 0.11 mmol of TOP was injected. The solution was maintained at 240 °C for 10 min to complete the growth of the CdSe core. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature (R.T.) and then purified according to a reported procedure.40 The purified CdSe core was finally dispersed in hexane for further use, and its concentration was determined by the Lambert–Beer law.40
Synthesis of CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs
The hexane solution containing the CdSe core was added into the 25 mL three-neck flask with 1.5 g of ODA and 5.0 g of ODE. The solution was vacuum pumped, first at R.T. to remove hexane and then at 100 °C for 10 min to remove the residual air. At that time, the solution was heated to 240 °C under nitrogen protection for the injections. The concentration of the cadmium and sulfur solution used for the injections is 0.2 M. The amount of each injection was calculated via the successive ion layer adsorption and reaction method reported by Peng et al.39 After the reaction, the stock solution was allowed to cool to R.T., followed by dilution with hexane. Then, a certain amount of acetone was added to precipitate the core/shell NCs. The obtained product was dispersed in chloroform and precipitated again with acetone, and this process was repeated several times to remove excess amines and unreacted reagents. The purified product was finally dispersed in chloroform for further use.
Transfer of OA-capped NCs into water through the ligand exchange processes using PAA, 3-MPA and DMSA
The ligand exchange of NCs by PAA was achieved by a reported method with a slight modification.37 In a typical synthesis, 0.5 g of PAA was dissolved in 3 mL of DEG, followed by vacuum pumping for 30 min at 50 °C to remove the air and water. Then, 3 mL of OA capped NCs in chloroform was injected and the solution was heated to 180 °C. After the injection, the solution immediately turned turbid and then gradually became clear for ∼10 minutes, indicating that the ligand exchange was accomplished. After the solution was cooled to R.T., a certain amount of acetone was added to precipitate NCs. The NCs were washed several times and finally dispersed in water for further use. For 3-MPA capped NCs, 0.1 mL of 3-MPA was added to water, followed by the addition of NaOH aqueous solution to tune the pH to 10 to form an aqueous solution with a total volume of 5 mL. Then, 5 mL of OA capped NCs in chloroform was added, and the mixed solution was vigorously stirred overnight at R.T. The obtained product was washed with acetone to remove OA. Then, the 3-MPA capped NCs were dispersed in a small amount of water and precipitated again by adding an excess amount of ethanol. This process was repeated several times to remove the un-bonded 3-MPA. Finally, the NCs were dispersed in water for further use. The DMSA-capped NCs were obtained through a reported method with a slight modification.36 Typically, to a DMSA aqueous solution (20 mg mL−1, 5 mL, pH 10 tuned by NaOH aqueous solution), 5 mL of OA capped NCs in chloroform was added. The mixed solution was vigorously stirred overnight at R.T. The purification procedure was similar to that of the 3-MPA-capped NCs.
Hydrogen evolution measurements
The experiments were performed on an airtight inner gas circulation system connected to a gas chromatography instrument (Shimadzu GC-2014c with a 5 Å molecular sieve column and a TCD detector) that could realize the online quantitative detection of H2. The solution containing the semiconductor NCs, catalyst and AA was fixed at 50 mL and kept in the dark before measurements. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.2 by adding HCl or NaOH solution. Before the experiments, the solution was degassed for 30 minutes to remove the dissolved oxygen, and then it was vigorously stirred at 8 °C. Illumination was applied from the top of the reaction cell by a 300 W Xeon lamp equipped with a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm) or band-pass filters (λ = 500 nm, 520 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, 650 nm, and 700 nm).
Employing Pt instead of Ni-DMSA complex as the catalyst for the hydrogen evolution measurements
To the aqueous solution containing QDs capped with the three different ligands and AA, 0.13 mL of H2PtCl6·H2O (1 wt%) aqueous solution was added. The conditions of the testing solution were the same as those applied when Ni-DMSA was employed as the catalyst, and the same concentration of H2PtCl6 as that of Ni-DMSA complex (50 μM) was used. It was expected that PtCl62− ions would be reduced to atomic Pt by the photogenerated electrons from the excited QDs (after the absorption of the incident light, λ > 420 nm).41 Experimentally, due to their ultrasmall size, the fine Pt nanoclusters (or nanoparticles) cannot be distinguished efficiently in the TEM results (Fig. S1†) of the QDs capped with the three different ligands after illumination. The considerably smaller size of PAA-capped QDs than those capped with the two other ligands is due to the partial dissolution of the QDs by the HCl introduced to precipitate the particles.37
Calculation of photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of NCs capped with different ligands
The reference dye used in our study is R6G, which has an emission peak at 580 nm (PL QY = 95%) under the excitation of 488 nm. The PL QY of the NCs capped with different ligands is calculated according to the following equation:PL QY = (F × A′ × PL QY′)/(F′ × A)where F and F′ are the integrated fluorescence areas of the NCs and reference dye, respectively; A and A′ are the absorbances of the NCs and reference dye at the excitation wavelength, respectively; and PL QY′ is the PL quantum yield of the reference dye.
Calculation of the apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the HPA system
AQY is defined as the number of electrons involved in the reduction reaction divided by the number of incident photons. The number of the electrons is determined by the moles of H2 generated, and the number of incident photons is calculated from the light intensity and illumination time. The AQY is obtained by the following equations:12,16,18 (1) (2) (3)where c is the speed of the light (m s−1); h is the Planck's constant (J s); n is the number of photons; λ is the wavelength of the incident light; t is the time (s); qp is the photo-flux; and k is the average generation rate of hydrogen (mol s−1).
Characterizations
TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) measurements were performed on a FEI TECNAI F20 EM with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Samples were prepared by placing a drop of the NCs solution on a carbon-coated copper grid and drying under ambient conditions. UV-Vis results were obtained on a Cary 500 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer. Infrared measurements were carried out on a VERTEX 70 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Bruker). XPS results were recorded on a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using monochromatized Al Kα excitation. The fluorescence emission spectra were obtained on a Fluoromax-4 Spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin YVON, INc NJ, USA) at room temperature. The light intensity was measured by the FZ-A power meter (Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University). The pH of the solution was measured by a PB-10, Sartorius pH meter. PL decay results were measured by a steady state and time resolved fluorescence spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instrument, UK) at room temperature under the excitation of a 375 nm picosecond laser diode with a repetition rate of 1 MHz.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of CdSe/CdS QDs and ligand exchange
CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs were synthesized according to a previous reported method (see experimental section for details).39Fig. 1a–b represent the typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) results of the OA capped CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs. As shown in Fig. 1a, the obtained organic QDs are nearly monodisperse with a mean size of 8.1 nm (Fig. S2†). Furthermore, HRTEM characterization (Fig. 1b) reveals the good crystallinity of the CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs, which is considered to be important for efficient H2 evolution. The poor crystallinity-related defects of QDs could act as the centres of recombination with the photogenerated electrons,42 which would reduce the probability of electron transfers from the QDs to the catalyst, and thus ultimately decrease the overall H2 evolution efficiency of the HPA system.

The mean size of the CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs, calculated from the average size of 200 particles, is 8.1 nm; (c) FTIR spectra of the CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs capped with OA, PAA, 3-MPA and DMSA, respectively; (d) UV-Vis spectra of the CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs capped with OA (in toluene), PAA (in water), 3-MPA (in water) and DMSA (in water), respectively. 
To transfer the organic OA-capped QDs into the aqueous phase, three ligands, i.e., 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), with the varying number of thiol functional group from two to zero, which have been used successfully to stabilize NCs in water,36–38 were selected. The reason for the selection is that the thiol functional group has been found to have the ability to effectively quench the photoluminescence (PL) of semiconductor QDs,24,43–47 and we anticipated that this would significantly affect the charge transfer behavior, and thus the H2 photogeneration efficiency of the QD-based HPA system.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was first employed to characterize the change of the functional groups on the surface of the QDs after the ligand exchange. As shown in Fig. 1c, after the ligand exchange, the intensities of the bands corresponding to C–H stretching vibrations at 2923 and 2852 cm−1 (ref. 48) are gradually decreased compared to the original OA capped QDs, which is indicative of a structural change in the capped ligands. Moreover, for the PAA-capped QDs, the band at 1725 cm−1, attributed to the carboxylic acid groups, is significantly increased, and the bands between 1600 and 1000 cm−1, assigned to the various vibrational modes of PAA, appears37,48 However, for the mercapto-containing 3-MPA and DMSA-capped QDs, the characteristic band at 2370 cm−1, attributed to the S–H stretching mode, could not be observed, demonstrating that both 3-MPA and DMSA are bonded onto the surface of the QDs through the thiol groups.36 Besides, the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of a carboxylate group, at 1573 and 1373 cm−1 for DMSA-capped QDs and at 1564 and 1397 cm−1 for 3-MPA capped QDs, are also observed.49
In addition, an obvious increase of the atomic ratio of sulfur/cadmium obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements further confirms the successful replacements of OA on the QDs by 3-MPA and DMSA (see Table S1 in ESI†). All the above mentioned observations indicate that PAA, 3-MPA and DMSA successfully replace the original OA ligand and are bonded onto the surface of the QDs through the carboxylic acid or thiol group (carboxylic acid group for PAA and thiol group for 3-MPA and DMSA). Fig. 1d presents the UV-Vis results of the QDs before and after ligand exchange. As clearly shown, their first excitonic peaks are all located at 618 nm, which indicates that the electronic band structure of the resulting QDs is not affected by the ligand exchange process. In addition, no obvious tail is observed at the longer wavelengths (>650 nm) of the UV-Vis spectra, demonstrating the good water dispersity of the QDs after the ligand exchange.
Hydrogen evolution and PL quenching measurements
Recent work by us18 and other groups12,16 have demonstrated that the simple introduction of Ni2+ ions into the HPA systems with QDs capped with sulfur-containing ligands (such as S2−, DHLA and 3-MPA) could result in a significantly higher H2 photogeneration efficiency. We therefore adopted this QD-Ni2+ HPA system in this study to systematically and deeply investigate the ligand effect of QDs on the photogeneration efficiency of H2 from water using CdSe/CdS core–shell NCs with the three different ligands. The effect of the amount of Ni2+ ions on the H2 photogeneration activity of the QDs capped with the three different ligands was first investigated. The volume of the reaction solution employed in the measurements was fixed at 50 mL with the conditions of 0.144 μM QDs and 0.8 M ascorbic acid (AA) as the sacrificial electron donor and pH = 5.2 unless specified in the following discussions.
As shown in Fig. 2, under the illumination of visible light (λ > 420 nm), the HPA systems with QDs capped with three different ligands exhibit distinct H2 photogeneration performance when the concentration of Ni2+ ions is changed. For the HPA system with the DMSA-capped QDs, the photocatalytic activity is significantly enhanced with the increasing of Ni2+ ions, and it reaches the maximum initial rate of H2 photogeneration (rinit) of 7.13 mL h−1 at 50 μM of Ni2+ ion concentration. Moreover, for the system with the 3-MPA-capped QDs, only a maximum activity of rinit = 0.27 mL h−1 at 100 μM of Ni2+ ion concentration was reached, and for that with the PAA–capped QDs, nearly no activity could be observed by merely increasing the concentration of Ni2+ ions. As previously reported,12,18 the H2 photogeneration activity of the QD-based HPA system should originate from the formation of the catalyst by the complexing of Ni2+ ions with the sulphur-containing ligand (DMSA or 3-MPA) on the surface of the QDs. For the PAA-capped QDs, the result implied that Ni2+ ions cannot form an effective catalyst with carboxylic acid groups (sulfur-free) of PAA for H2 photogeneration, which is consistent with our previous results that both nickel and sulfur elements are indispensable for the high activity of the catalyst.18 Incidentally, the case of the PAA-capped QDs also demonstrates that Ni2+ ions cannot undergo complexation with the ionic-bonded sulfur (in the form of CdS shell) to form an efficient catalyst for H2 photogeneration.
 Fig. 2  The initial rate of H2 production by the QD-Ni2+ HPA systems with varied surface ligands versus the concentration of Ni2+ ions under the same conditions (QDs 0.144 μM, AA 0.8 M, pH 5.2, incident light λ > 420 nm). 
We further employed PL quenching method, which has been successfully used to monitor the ET efficiency from QDs to the molecular catalysts in the QD-based HPA system,6 for investigating the ET properties of the QDs with the three different ligands after introducing Ni2+ ions. As shown in Fig. 3a, the PL intensity of the DMSA-capped QDs was gradually decreased on increasing the concentration of Ni2+ ions, and the PL quenching percentage in the case of the DMSA-capped QDs (84.9%) is significantly higher than that of the 3-MPA–capped QDs (11.7%) and PAA capped QDs (1.9%) (Fig. 3b). These results indicate that the QDs capped with different ligands exhibit distinct ET behaviors after the introduction of Ni2+ ions, which results in the pronounced difference in H2 photogeneration efficiency among the HPA systems, as shown in Fig. 2. Two possible aspects are assumed to cause this significant difference: one is the different surface states of QDs induced by the ligands, while the other is the different activities of the catalysts formed by the complexation of Ni2+ ions with the different ligands, which may remain attached or dissociated from the surface of the QDs.
 Fig. 3  (a) PL intensity of the DMSA-capped CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs versus the concentration of Ni2+ ions; (b) PL quenching percentage of the CdSe/CdS QDs capped with the three different ligands versus the concentration of Ni2+ ions. 
Although it is rational to conclude that different active formulas/types of the catalyst would result in different H2 photogeneration activities, the effect of the ligands on the H2 photogeneration efficiency of the HPA system is yet to be identified in our study. Thus, a pre-synthesized catalyst was intentionally introduced to compare the H2 photogeneration efficiency of the HPA systems with QDs capped with the three different ligands under the same conditions. Previous results have shown that Ni2+ ions could complex with sulfur-containing precursors, such as thiolates or S2−, with the optimal ratio of nickel/sulfur around 1:2 to form a catalyst with high efficiency for H2 photogeneration.12,18 Therefore, we employed the Ni-DMSA complex (with molar ratio at 1:1) as an additional intentionally introduced catalyst in the experiments because the HPA system with DMSA-capped QDs has been demonstrated to exhibit the highest H2 photogeneration efficiency after the introduction of Ni2+ ions (cf.Fig. 2), and this could also rule out the possible effect of the destruction of an externally introduced catalyst by the ligand dissociated from the QDs on the efficiency of the HPA system in our study.16 The UV-Vis measurements of Ni2+ ions versus the amount of DMSA showed that the absorption curve possibly increases linearly with the increasing concentration of DMSA until the molar ratio of DMSA/Ni2+ reaches 1:1 (see Fig. S3†). Subsequently, the absorption characteristics of the solution are dramatically changed, indicating a probable change of the coordination structure between Ni2+ and DMSA, which is consistent with the previous results.12,18
When the Ni-DMSA complex was employed as the externally introduced catalyst, the HPA systems with the QDs capped with the three different ligands also exhibited different H2 photogeneration efficiencies under the same testing conditions. As clearly shown in Fig. 4a and c, the rinit of the HPA system with DMSA-capped QDs is 3.37 mL h−1, while for the HPA systems with 3-MPA and PAA–capped QDs, the rinit is 1.51 mL h−1 and 0.04 mL h−1, respectively. The results strongly suggest that the type of ligand on the QDs does have a significant effect on the H2 photogeneration efficiency of the HPA system, showing an efficiency trend of DMSA > 3-MPA > PAA. We also note that the rinit of the HPA system with the DMSA-capped QDs is just about 2 times higher than that with 3-MPA–capped QDs, which is considerably lower than in the case when only Ni2+ ions were introduced (without the introduction of additional Ni-DMSA) into the HPA system (cf.Fig. 2, ∼26 times). This difference is supposed to be attributed to the different activities of the in situ formed catalysts (Ni-DMSA and Ni-3-MPA) and the variations of the ET efficiency (discussed below). Interestingly, it is also found that the H2 production rate of the HPA system with PAA-capped QDs is gradually increased as the reaction proceeds, and finally it reaches the stable rate of H2 photogeneration (rstab) at 1.48 mL h−1. However, this does not happen for the HPA systems with 3-MPA and DMSA–capped QDs (Fig. 4a and c). On the contrary, their rstab values are maintained at 1.23 and 1.32 mL h−1, respectively, which are considerably less compared with their rinit values. The increase of the rate in the case of PAA–capped QDs is speculated to be caused by a possible partial replacement of PAA on the QDs by the thiol group of the Ni-DMSA complex. For the cases of the 3-MPA and DMSA–capped QDs, this may not occur easily due to the same functional group (thiol group) being bonded on the surface of QDs. Furthermore, the decrease in the rstab values of the HPA systems with the 3-MPA and DMSA–capped QDs (compared with their rinit values) might be attributed to the partial reduction of the active sites generated during the ligand exchange process.18

To further confirm the ligand effect on the H2 photogeneration efficiency of the HPA systems and whether the additionally added Ni-DMSA complex could partially replace the PAA on the QDs, we employed Pt as another externally introduced catalyst (instead of Ni-DMSA complex) to compare the efficiencies of the HPA systems with the QDs capped with the three different ligands. Pt is preferably used here because it is a well-known efficient catalyst for H2 photogeneration; moreover, because it has no functional groups, ligand exchange reactions between the QDs and the catalyst, which supposedly would affect the H2 photogeneration activity of the QDs, are not possible. As indicated in Fig. 4b & c, when Pt (with the same molar concentration as Ni-DMSA) is used as the catalyst, the rinit of all the HPA systems with all the types of QDs in our study are significantly enhanced compared with that employing Ni-DMSA, demonstrating the superior activity of Pt over Ni-DMSA. In addition, it is clearly seen that both the rinit and rstab of the HPA systems with the QDs capped with the three different ligands exhibit a similar trend of H2 photogeneration efficiency when employing Ni-DMSA as the catalyst, which further confirms the important role of the ligand of the QDs on the efficiency of the HPA systems. Furthermore, we found that unlike in the case of Ni-DMSA, no obvious enhancement of the rstab of the HPA system with PAA capped QDs compared with that of rinit was observed. The result therefore implies the occurrence of a ligand exchange reaction between the added Ni-DMSA complex and PAA on the QDs.

Fig. 4d presents the dependence of the apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the HPA system with the DMSA–capped QDs on the wavelength of the incident light and the UV-Vis spectrum of the DMSA–capped QDs in water. It is clearly seen that the AQY decreases with the increase of the wavelength of incident light, which is consistent with the absorption profile of the QDs. This implies that the H2 production of the HPA system is mediated by the light absorption of the QDs. More importantly, our result indicates that by employing the CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs as the light absorber, the response wavelength of the incident light of the HPA system for H2 production extends even to 650 nm, covering almost the entire visible region. This is highly desirable because it could utilize the incoming solar energy more efficiently.
Steady state PL intensity, lifetime measurements and ET studies
To get further insights into the ligand effect on the photocatalytic activity of the QD system, the fluorescence intensity and lifetime measurements, which have been proven to be effective methods for monitoring the change of surface states of QDs,26 were first carried out. As clearly shown in Fig. 5a, the different surface ligands have significant effects on the PL intensity of the QDs. Compared with the original OA–capped QDs, the PL intensities are all decreased after the PAA, 3-MPA or DMSA coating. Clearly, the PAA coating results in the smallest decrease in PL intensity, whereas DMSA coating leads to the largest quenching of the PL intensity. It should be noted that the lower-energy emission, which normally arises during the ligand exchange process,32,50 was not observed in our case. We attributed this to the efficient protection of the intrinsic emission property of the CdSe core by the CdS shell of the QDs.

The corresponding PL quantum yield (QY) is reduced from the original 64.8% (OA–capped QDs) to the final 4.8% (DMSA–capped QDs) (For data of other QDs see Table S1, ESI†). These results are in contrast with the trend of the H2 production rates of the HPA systems employing these QDs, where the DMSA coating exhibits the highest activity, while the PAA coating shows the lowest efficiency. Fig. 5b shows the PL decay results of the QDs capped with different ligands. For the original OA–capped QDs, the PL decay curve can be fitted with a single-exponential function with a fluorescence lifetime of 33.0 ns. Interestingly, after the ligand exchange, all the PL decay results are fitted into a bi-exponential decay function with the average fluorescence lifetime decreased from 30.5 ns for PAA coating to 27.7 ns for 3-MPA coating and 22.5 ns for DMSA coating (obtained from the data in Table S2†), which is consistent with the trend of the PL intensity results.
The PL intensity and lifetime have been recognized to be the ultimate expression of the competition between the non-radiative and radiative relaxations in QDs.26,30 Therefore, the magnitude of the decrease of the PL intensity and lifetime can be viewed as an indicator that reflects the status of the surface traps on the surface of the QDs.30 A previous work reported that 3-MPA ligand could generate surface traps for capturing holes due to its HOMO energy levels being higher than the valence band of semiconductor NCs, including CdSe and CdS, which results in the PL quenching of these materials.51 Due to the more significant PL quenching and the shorter PL lifetime for DMSA capped QDs than 3-MPA capped QDs in our study, we tentatively conclude that the HOMO levels of DMSA might be even higher than that of 3-MPA, which means that the photoinduced holes could transfer more efficiently to the surface traps for DMSA capped QDs than to the 3-MPA capped QDs. However, for the PAA capped QDs, it is suspected that the hole transfer may not occur easily, as proved by the insufficient PL quenching and the longer PL lifetime. Our results are consistent with the result reported by Banin et al. that thiolated alkyl ligands could induce more surface trapping states on CdS-Au nanorods than on other polymers without thiol groups.26
In addition to the variation of surface states induced by ligand coating, the corresponding ET efficiency from the QDs to the catalyst is considered to be another important aspect that may affect the overall H2 photogeneration efficiency of the HPA system. Therefore, we further investigated the ET behaviors of the QDs capped with the three different ligands after introducing Ni-DMSA catalyst by the PL quenching technique (Fig. 6). As shown, the PL quenching percentages for PAA, 3-MPA and DMSA–capped QDs are 11.5%, 76.4% and 58.9%, respectively. The results clearly reveal the influence of the ligands on the ET from the QDs to the catalyst (Ni-DMSA), where the 3-MPA–capped QDs possess the highest ET efficiency, while PAA–capped QDs possess a considerably lower value. We attribute this difference to the different lengths of the ligands, as the length of PAA is longer than that of 3-MPA and DMSA, which might hinder the ET from the QDs to the catalyst.

It is generally accepted that the overall H2 photogeneration efficiency of the QD-based HPA system is determined by the following three factors: (1) the separation efficiency of the electron–hole pairs generated in the QDs; (2) the ET efficiency from the QDs to the catalyst; and (3) the activity of the catalyst. Because the catalyst used in our study is the same for all the three cases (Ni-DMSA or Pt), the different H2 production rates of the HPA systems should be ascribed to the other two factors. It is noticed that the trend of H2 photogeneration efficiency of the HPA systems is different from that of the ET efficiency (cf.Fig. 6). Therefore, we consider that the distinct ligand-dependent H2 production performance of the HPA systems in our study is mainly attributed to the different charge separation efficiencies. Combined with the PL studies and explanations, we rationally conclude that the ability of surface traps to capture holes might affect the charge separation efficiency. As discussed above, the DMSA induced surface traps are supposed to possess the highest energy levels, whereas the PAA induced surface traps might have the lowest energy levels. This difference of energy levels would apparently affect the degree of hole transfer from the QDs to the surface traps because the surface traps with higher energy levels would provide a larger driving force for hole transfer, which is beneficial for increasing the charge separation efficiency of the QDs. Fig. 7 outlines the possible H2 photogeneration mechanism of our QD-based HPA system. As illustrated, it is suspected that the energy levels of surface traps induced by the ligands are located in between the energy levels of the valence band of QDs and the hole scavenger. Once the QDs are excited, the photoinduced holes quickly transfer to the surface traps and subsequently to the hole scavenger, whereas the electrons are transferred to the catalyst to facilitate the reduction of protons. Here, it should be noted that our conclusion appears contrary to that reported by Banin et al. They found that the good passivation of surface traps would result in the high efficiency of H2 production.26 However, both these conclusions are not in contradiction with each other in essence. The difference is attributed to the different types of QDs employed. In their study, CdS-Au nanorods were employed, which is actually a hybrid of a light absorber (CdS) and a catalyst (Au). Therefore, higher amounts of surface traps on the nanorods would apparently reduce the probability of transferring the photogenerated electrons in CdS to the Au tip for H2 photogeneration.

Conclusions
We have studied the ligand effect on the H2 photogeneration efficiency of the CdSe/CdS core/shell QD-based HPA system in water under the illumination of visible light. The results show that the HPA system with DMSA–capped QDs exhibits the highest efficiency of H2 production, while the 3-MPA and PAA coatings result in the intermediate and lowest photocatalytic activity, respectively. This ligand-dependent photocatalytic activity is considered to be mainly attributed to the variations in the surface traps and corresponding charge separation efficiencies of the QDs induced by surface coating with the different ligands. PL intensity and lifetime decay results reveal that the ability of surface traps to capture photoinduced holes, which is supposed to correlate with the charge separation efficiency of the QDs, is affected by the type of the ligand used. A more efficient charge separation caused by ligand engineering will result in a higher H2 production efficiency of the QD-based HPA system. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the surface ligand engineering of QDs to significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of the QD-based HPA system for H2 production, which is expected to provide a new clue for further increasing the photocatalytic efficiency of the QD-based HPA systems.
