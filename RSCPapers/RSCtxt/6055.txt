    , Accepted 5th June 2022First published on 6th June 2022AbstractTin halide perovskite (Sn-HPs) photovoltaics could potentially equal or exceed the performance of their more toxic Pb-based analogues if defect state densities, particularly originating from the presence of Sn4+, can be significantly decreased. Numerous additives are incorporated into Sn-HPs to minimize the amount of Sn4+, including SnF2, reducing agents such as hydrazine derivatives, and various antioxidants. Despite the frequent use of additives to reduce Sn4+ content, there is limited understanding of how they function and consequently limited guidance for the development of new additives. Herein, we use cyclic voltammetry to probe the redox behavior of SnI2, SnI4, Sn-HP precursor solutions, and 18 different additives. Through 119Sn NMR measurements we show that hydrochloride containing additives undergo halide exchange with SnI4 to form SnIxCly, which results in decreased Sn4+ concentrations and less p-type character in the Sn-HP films. We find that the most effective additive at lowering the Sn4+ content in FASnI3 is not capable of reducing SnI4 or forming SnIxCly, but rather it acts as a sacrificial and coordinating antioxidant. In general, when selecting additives for Sn-HPs it is important to account for the redox potential, coordination with Sn species, ability to react with oxygen, and the potential for halide exchange.
Introduction
Organic metal halide perovskite (HP) based solar cells (PSCs) are widely considered as the most promising materials for high efficiency and low-cost photovoltaics (PVs), with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Pb-based PSCs increasing from 3.8 to 25.2% within just over a decade of intensive research efforts.1,2 Nevertheless, these Pb-based PSCs face several impediments to widespread commercialization, one of which is the toxicity of Pb. Desire for less-toxic PSCs has motivated intense efforts to identify Pb-free HPs for PSCs, with Sn-HPs currently being the front-runners.3–6 Tin has a similar ionic radius (118 pm and 119 pm for Sn2+ and Pb2+, respectively),7 relatively high charge-carrier mobilities,8,9 and a near-ideal bandgap (∼1.3 eV) for reaching high PCEs.6,10 However, the highest certified PCE for Sn-based PSCs to date is 14.6%,4 which is much lower than the Pb analogues. Current understanding is that the biggest impediment to high Sn-PSC performance is the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+,3,6,11 which results in deformation of the perovskite structure, defect state introduction, and rapid degradation of device performance. Thus, a major challenge for Sn-PSC development is to minimize Sn4+ content.
Oxidation of Sn-HPs can lead to SnI4 formation and eventually I2 as degradation products, which perpetuates an oxidative degradation cycle that continuously deteriorates the material and device.12 Furthermore, SnI4 is present as an impurity in the SnI2 precursors used to form Sn-HPs.13 Eliminating or minimizing Sn4+ is critical and central to all reports of relatively high-performing Sn-PSCs. Strategies to eliminate Sn4+ include purifying SnI2 or synthesizing high purity SnI2 to minimize SnI4 content in the precursor,4,13 using reducing agents to reduce Sn4+ impurities to Sn2+,14 using antioxidants to prevent the formation of Sn4+,15,16 and adding bulky A-site cations to stabilize the resulting films.17,18 A combination of these strategies is often used to fabricate high-performing Sn-PSCs.4,19
Various additives have been explored to limit the amount of Sn4+ present in HPs, with the proposed mechanism based on either Sn4+ to Sn2+ reduction or retarding the oxidation of Sn2+.14–16,20,21 These additives include SnF2 and SnCl2,22–24 hydrazine and hydrazine containing compounds,14,21,25–29 metallic tin,30 and organic acids.15,16,20 Although these additives are highly important, the mechanisms of action often remain unclear. For example, the mechanistic understanding for even the most common additive for Sn-HPs, SnF2, continues to evolve.24,31,32 Previously, SnF2 was often regarded as a reducing additive; however, a detailed investigation by Pascual et al.32 showed that SnF2 does not reduce Sn4+ but instead undergoes a ligand exchange with SnI4 to form SnI2 and SnF4. Here, the authors attribute the improved PSC performance with SnF2 addition to the exclusion of Sn4+ from the FASnI3 crystalline grains.
In an early investigation, Song et al.21 reported that hydrazine (N2H4) vapor creates a reducing environment to suppress the formation of Sn4+ during tin perovskite deposition. Following this report, several groups used hydrazinium iodide and hydrazine dihydrochloride to reduce the amount of Sn4+ and further improve the PCE and stability of Sn PSCs.25–28 These reports suggest that hydrazine and its HI and HCl salts could reduce Sn4+; however, no direct proof was offered to show that Sn4+ reduction occurs. Importantly, the reduction and oxidation potentials of both the Sn species (e.g., SnI2 and SnI4) and the hydrazine derivatives may depend on the solvent, solution pH, and reactants present.20,33 Consequently, standard redox potentials reported in aqueous solutions may lead to incorrect predictions regarding redox activity in anhydrous organic solvents.
Metallic Sn, if appropriately removed from the precursor solution prior to HP film formation, can serve as an effective reducing agent for Sn4+ to yield improved PSCs.30,34 Here, metallic Sn undergoes a comproportionation reaction with Sn4+ to form Sn2+.30 Various acids have also been investigated as reducing agents and antioxidants, including hypophosphorous acid,35 formic acid,36 hydroquinonesulfonic acid potassium salt,15 ascorbic acid,37 and caffeic acid.16 These examples of organic acids appear to involve the additive acting as an antioxidant rather than a reducing agent. However, whether the additive acts as an antioxidant or reducing agent is ambiguous in many reports.
Despite the significant amount of investigation into decreasing the amount of Sn4+ in films, there is a dearth of mechanistic understanding on how different additives function and what aspects are most important. Additives may decrease the Sn4+ concentration via three primary mechanisms, which include acting as reducing agents to directly convert Sn4+ to Sn2+, preventing Sn2+ oxidation, or reacting with Sn4+ to make it more benign, as observed for SnF2 addition. In the case of antioxidants, these may react with O2 to prevent O2 from oxidizing the Sn-HP or they may coordinate Sn2+ at the film surface or at grain boundaries to make the Sn-HP less susceptible to oxidation.15,20,38 Occasionally, the terms “antioxidant” and “reducing agent” are used interchangeably in the literature, yet antioxidants are often incapable of acting as reducing agents for the species of interest. For instance, an antioxidant may react with oxidizing agents to prevent them from oxidizing the compound of interest or coordinate the compound of interest to reduce its susceptibility to oxidation.
The work presented herein seeks to improve our mechanistic understanding of how various additives diminish the amount of Sn4+ in thin films. Included in this investigation are additives that may reduce Sn4+, coordinate Sn2+ in solution without reducing Sn4+, act as sacrificial antioxidants, or facilitate a halide exchange with SnI4. First, we use electrochemistry to probe redox activity of the HP precursors in the typically used DMF:DMSO processing solution, including SnI2 and SnI4, as well as the redox potentials of a host of additives. This electrochemistry data provides a first assessment of the thermodynamic favorability of SnI4 reduction. Using a combination of CV, 1H and 119Sn NMR, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), we determine the impact of additives on the concentration of Sn4+ in solution and in thin films.
Results and discussion
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) provides a direct way to measure reduction and oxidation of Sn-HP precursors in solution. Herein, we focus our discussion on anodic (Ep,a) and cathodic (Ep,c) peak potentials, as the reduction potentials for some species cannot be determined due to the irreversibility of the electrochemical reaction. To ensure that the anodic and cathodic potentials reported are directly relevant to Sn-HPs, we measured CVs in both pure DMF and the commonly used DMF:DMSO (4:1) solvent system. Although DMSO can act as an oxidizing agent for SnI2,39,40 the CV spectra for the formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3) precursors in DMF and DMF:DMSO solutions are nearly identical, as shown in Fig. 1 and ESI Fig. S1.† Tin(II) iodide shows a Ep,c of −1.15 V (vs. Ag/Ag+), whereas Ep,c for SnI4 occurs at −0.72 V. Films of FASnI3 also show nearly the same onset for the cathodic wave of Sn2+ as is observed for SnI2 in solution, with an Ep,c of −1.20 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) (Fig. S2†). The E1/2 for SnI2 + 2e− ↔ Sn0 + 2I− is −1.02 V; however, with an irreversible reduction the E1/2 for SnI4 + 2e− ↔ SnI2 + 2I− cannot be determined. The commonly used additive SnF2 shows a more negative E1/2 than SnI2 at −1.13 V. Given the reduction behavior of SnI2 and SnI4, ideal reducing agents for reducing SnI4 to SnI2 should have redox potentials in the range of ca. −0.75 to −1.0 V vs. Ag/Ag+ when measured in DMF:DMSO. In this range SnI4 reduction to SnI2 is thermodynamically favorable, while further reduction to metallic Sn is not favorable. That is, the upper limit of this recommend range (ca. −0.75 V) is more negative than the Ep,c for SnI4 (−0.72 V) and thus reduction of SnI4 to SnI2 is favorable, while the lower limit (ca. −1.0 V) avoids reducing SnI2 to metallic Sn, as SnI2 shows an onset of reduction at ca. −1.04.

With the oxidation and reduction behavior of SnI2 and SnI4 in DMSO:DMF determined, we now turn to investigating the influence of the additives. To investigate the mechanism through which several reported additives for Sn HPs function and to identify new additives, the molecules and complexes shown in Fig. 2a were initially investigated with CV, as shown in Fig. 2b and c with results tabulated in Table 1. The additives investigated include quinones and hydroxyquinones, catechols and structurally related derivatives, hydrazine containing derivatives, and hydrochloride containing species. Specifically, the quinones and hydroxyquinones are selected for their large variation in redox potentials, the catechols for their anticipated abilities to coordinate Sn halides, and the hydrazine derivatives for their low oxidation potentials that make them amenable for use as reducing agents.

The CV data show three clusters of anodic peaks, with the dihydroxyanthroquinone derivatives (1,8-DHAQ and 2,6-DHAQ) and naphthoquinone (NQ) showing Ep,a near −1.0 V; the hydrochloride (HCl) salts including dopamine HCl (DHCl), benzylhydrazine HCl (BHzHCl), and hydrazine HCl (HzHCl) showing Ep,a near −0.6 V; and the catechol and hydroquinone derivatives displaying Ep,a close to −0.1 V. One additive, 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DHBQ), has Ep,a outside of these regions at −0.37 V. Based on these anodic peak positions and E1/2 values, HzHCl, BHzHCl, and DHCl are near the range where SnI4 to SnI2 reduction becomes favorable, while 1,8-DHAQ, 2,6-DHAQ, and NQ are in a range where SnI4 to SnI2 reduction is favorable with the possibility of SnI2 to metallic Sn reduction occurring. However, to act as reducing agents the additives must originally be in their reduced form, which is not the case with 1,8-DHAQ, 2,6-DHAQ, and NQ. A commercially available reduced form of NQ, DHNT, shows an anodic peak near 0 V and an E1/2 of −0.33 V, which is not appropriate for reducing SnI4. The fact that the electrochemically reduced form of NQ does not show an anodic peak at the same potential as DHNT indicates that NQ does not undergo a two-proton coupled electron transfer upon reduction in the DMF:DMSO solvent system, as it does in aqueous solution.41 Rather, the electrochemically reduced form of NQ is a singly charged anion.41
Several additives that were shown to decrease the amount of Sn4+ present in Sn-HPs, including caffeic acid (CA),16 potassium hydroquinonesulfonate (KHQSA),15 and 4-fluorobenzohydrazide (4-FBH),38 show Ep,a and E1/2 values that are far too positive to act as reducing agents for SnI4. The fact that all three of these additives have been shown to diminish the concentration of Sn4+ in Sn-HPs indicates that something other than SnI4 reduction is occurring, likely involving coordination to Sn2+ to prevent oxidation. Another additive that was demonstrated to decrease the Sn4+ concentration, HzHCl, has an Ep,a of −0.64 V and an E1/2 of −0.84 V, which is in the ideal range for SnI4 reduction without over reduction to metallic Sn. Additionally, BHzHCl and DHCl show similar anodic peaks of −0.63 and −0.65 V, respectively, suggesting that they may also be able to reduce SnI4 to some extent. To further probe the ability of selected additives to reduce SnI4 we carried out solution state 119Sn NMR measurements.
The 119Sn NMR shows clear and well separated peaks for SnI2 and SnI4. Here, SnI4 shows a signal at a chemical shift of −2025 ppm while SnI2 falls at −691 ppm. To probe for SnI4 to SnI2 reduction, selected additives were added to SnI4 in DMSO solutions at a 1:1 concentration and 119Sn NMR spectra recorded, as shown in Fig. 3 and S10.† No clear evidence of SnI4 reduction to SnI2 is observed for any of the additives investigated; although, it cannot be excluded that some of the peaks in the −500 to −700 ppm range correspond with complexes of SnI2. The three additives with Ep,a in the −0.63 to −0.65 V range all show the presence of several other Sn peaks; however, none of these peaks align directly with SnI2. Notably, all these additives (BHzHCl, DHCl, and HzHCl) contain HCl. All three display peaks at −606 ppm near that of SnCl4, as well as peaks at ca. −1030 and −1525 ppm, which we attribute to the presence of SnI2Cl2 and SnI3Cl, respectively.42,43 These products originate from halide exchange, similar to that observed between SnI4 and SnF2.32 This halide exchange does not depend on the oxidation potential of the additives, as it also occurs when methylammonium chloride is added to SnI4, as shown in ESI Fig. S10 and S11.† A series of 119Sn NMR and UV-Vis absorbance spectra were recorded with varying SnI4:MACl ratios to further support the NMR peak assignments and the formation of SnIxCly species, as shown in ESI Fig. S11.† Here, the 119Sn NMR shows that as the ratio of SnI4:MACl decreases the peak intensities corresponding with increased y values in SnIxCly increase, while the UV-Vis shows a decrease in SnI4 absorbance intensity and a blue shift in absorbance maxima as the amount of MACl increases. At a 1:4 ratio, where the moles of I and Cl are equal, Cl completely displaces I and results in the presence of only SnCl4 in the 119Sn NMR spectra. In accordance with the explanation for F exchange with I in SnI4,32 the Cl exchange can also be attributed to the increased stability of SnCl4 relative to SnI4 described by hard–soft acid–base theory. The formation of SnIxCly complexes is likely to have a significant influence on defect states in Sn-HPs, potentially leading to exclusion of the Sn4+ species from the FASnI3 crystalline grains or a change in the energies of the resulting defect states. Additionally, these species may evaporate from the film considering the relatively low boiling point of SnCl4 of 114 °C.44

In addition to the formation of SnIxCly, other products and complexes are also evident in the 119Sn NMR. Here, DHCl shows several additional strong peaks, including at −540, −558, −825, and −845 ppm. The 1H NMR of DHCl with SnI4 shows a large shift in the hydroxyl protons from a doublet centered at 8.83 ppm to a broad singlet at 6.8 ppm and a reduction in the integrated intensity. This combination of 119Sn and 1H NMR strongly supports that DHCl is forming a coordination complex with the Sn species through the hydroxyl groups, potentially with one of the hydroxyl groups becoming deprotonated. The coordination of Sn species is not unique to DHCl, as all additives investigated with hydroxyl or carboxylic acid groups show significant shifts and broadening of the hydroxyl and carboxylic acid protons upon SnI4 addition (ESI Fig. S14–S17†). The ability of these additives to coordinate Sn species in solution is also expected to have an impact on the amount of Sn4+ in HP films due to reduced reactivity of the coordinated Sn species. Aside from BHzHCl, DHCl, and HzHCl, the only other additive that shows a large decrease in the amount of SnI4 present is DHCA. When DHCA is added to SnI4 new peaks in the 119Sn NMR spectrum appear at −825 and −1238 ppm, the carboxylic acid proton shifts up field by 2.5 ppm, and the hydroxyl group protons shift down field by 0.5 ppm. These results indicate strong coordination between the Sn complexes and DHCA.
Further investigation into solution behavior of Sn species upon addition of various additives was carried out by recording cyclic voltammograms of SnI2 + FAI + SnI4 solutions with and without additives, as displayed in ESI Fig. S8.† When HzHCl, BHzHCl, DHCl, or DHCA are added to the Sn-HP precursor solutions with SnI4 there is a decrease in the current arising from SnI4 reduction (Fig. S8A and B†). This decrease in current may arise from a combination of the formation of SnIxCly species, as SnCl4 shows a significantly higher reduction potential than SnI4 (Fig. S8C†), and strong coordination between SnI4 and the additive that shifts the reduction potential of SnI4. Absorbance of SnI4 in solution with HzHCl, BHzHCl and DHCl additives show large (78, 48 and 55%, respectively) decreases in SnI4 absorbance at 400 nm (Fig. S9†), which agrees with the decreased SnI4 concentration observed in CV and NMR. The absorbance of SnI4 at 400 nm also decreases with DHCA. Although, the decrease is only 33%, suggesting either strong coordination between SnI4 and DHCA or partial reduction of SnI4 to SnI2. Based on the 119Sn NMR, if SnI2 is formed upon reaction with DHCA, the SnI2 is coordinated to DHCA.
We now shift to how solution behavior relates to the concentration of Sn2+ and Sn4+ in the FASnI3 films. We initially fabricated Sn-HP films with additive concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2.5% and recorded the UV-Vis absorbance and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, as displayed in ESI Fig. S3 and S4.† Nearly all additives show an enhancement in the PL intensity at all additive concentrations. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction spectra (ESI Fig. S5†) are similar for all FASnI3 films with 2.5% of the additives incorporated. All additives were thus incorporated at 2.5% for the XPS and UPS measurements to increase our ability to detect their effects on the FASnI3 films. Here, using XPS we probed the concentration of Sn4+ relative to Sn2+ for the FASnI3 films with various additives, as shown in Fig. 4 and ESI Fig. S6.† In the control FASnI3 sample with no additive the Sn4+ content is 6.9% and Sn2+ is 93.1%. Similar Sn4+ concentrations between 6.1 and 7.6% are found with 1,8-DHAQ, NQ, DHBQ, HQ, and 4-FBH. As may be expected, none of these additives show reduction potentials suitable for reducing SnI4. The three HCl containing additives, BHzHCl, HzHCl, and DHCl, all show a depressed concentration of Sn4+ relative to the control, with Sn4+ concentrations of 3.6, 4.5, and 5.1%, respectively. DHCA, which diminished the free SnI4 concentration based on the 119Sn NMR also shows a significant decrease in Sn4+ content at 4.1%.
 Fig. 4  XPS spectra of the Sn 3d region for FASnI3 films with fits to the Sn2+ and Sn4+ peaks for the films made with 2.5 mol% of varying additives. 
Surprisingly, DHNT displays the lowest Sn4+ concentration of 3.3% relative to Sn2+. We attribute this low Sn4+ content with DHNT to two methods of antioxidant behavior, including the reaction of DHNT with oxygen to prevent the reaction of oxygen with the Sn-HP and coordination to Sn species at the perovskite surface. The reaction of DHNT with oxygen is supported by 1H NMR measurements (ESI Fig. S16†), where DHNT shows a decrease in the hydroxyl proton intensity and massive broadening of the remaining proton signal following exposure to ambient atmosphere. The same behavior is also observed when SnI2 is present with DHNT at a 1:1 mole ratio.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy can also provide insight into the concentration of Sn4+, as the presence of Sn4+ leads to high concentrations of holes (p-type charge carriers) in FASnI3. Here, a more p-type film will, to a first approximation, be associated with a higher work function and a valence band onset that is closer to the Fermi energy (EF). The FASnI3 film without any additive shows a work function of 4.85 eV, which is similar to FASnI3 with the additives that showed comparable Sn4+ compositions (Fig. 5, ESI Fig. S7 and Table S2†). On the other hand, when the Sn4+ composition determined by XPS decreases, the work function also generally decreases and the valence band onset shifts further from EF. For example, DHNT shows the lowest work function and the lowest Sn4+ content and BHzHCl, DHCl, and DHCA all have lower Sn4+ content and work functions that are 0.3 to 0.4 eV lower than the control. These UPS results agree with the Sn4+ concentrations determined by XPS and support that increased Sn4+ content leads to more p-type character.

The various pathways through which the additives can influence the defect states present in Sn halide perovskites are summarized in Fig. 6. The ability of the additive to coordinate SnI2 and Sn species at grain boundaries and surfaces of FASnI3 films is one parameter that can significantly impact the amount of SnI2 present. For example, both the 119Sn and 1H NMR support that DHCA coordinates with Sn halide species in solution and reduces the concentration of Sn4+ in the FASnI3 films. Another important consideration is the ability of the additive to reduce SnI4 to SnI2, although reduction of SnI4 to SnI2 does not appear to be a primary mode of action for most organic additives used thus far in Sn-HPs. Identification of additives that can reduce SnI4 to SnI2 without over reduction to metallic Sn is a promising path forward; however, it may be important that these reducing additives be driven off during thermal annealing to prevent them from acting as charge traps in the Sn-HP films. Halide exchange with both SnF2 and chloride containing salts is a clear route for reducing the debilitating impact of Sn4+ on Sn-PSCs, and our work clarifies that halide exchange occurs with HCl salts that are currently applied to improve Sn-PSCs.28,45,46 Finally, the additive may act as a sacrificial antioxidant to impede the oxidation of Sn species in the solution or solid state. We propose that it will be necessary to consider multiple of these factors when designing additives, or combinations of additives, for Sn-HPs. For example, two additives with different primary functions may be necessary. In this case one additive could reduce SnI4 to SnI2 in solution and be driven off during Sn-HP formation, and another additive could coordinate Sn species at surfaces and grain boundaries to prevent oxidation after film formation.

Conclusions
In summary, the work presented here identifies an ideal range for the reduction potentials of additives to remove SnI4 impurities and shows that many commonly used additives do not fall within this ideal range. Identifying and applying reducing agents that can both fully reduce SnI4 to SnI2 and coordinate Sn at the Sn-HP surface to prevent further Sn oxidation is a promising path forward for improving Sn-based PSCs. We also show that SnI4 readily undergoes halide exchange when Cl− is present in solution, likely resulting in less harmful defect states in the Sn-HP film or evaporation of Sn4+ species (SnIxCly) from the film. This halide exchange may be a primary explanation for the success of several additives for Sn-HPs. Through UPS and XPS we show that the lowest Sn4+ content is found for an additive that does not reduce SnI4 or result in the formation of SnIxCly complexes. The ability of this additive, DHNT, to lower the concentration of Sn4+ in FASnI3 films is attributed to its reactivity with oxygen as a sacrificial antioxidant and its coordination to Sn. Overall, our work highlights that the reduction potential, coordination with Sn species, ability to react with oxygen, and the potential for halide exchange should all be taken into consideration when evaluating or designing additives for Sn-HPs.
