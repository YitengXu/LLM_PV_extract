    , Accepted 28th April 2009First published on 29th May 2009AbstractNanocrystalline silicon thin films were deposited on single-crystal silicon and glass substrates simultaneously by inductively coupled plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition from the reactive silane reactant gas diluted with hydrogen at a substrate temperature of 200 °C. The effect of hydrogen dilution ratio X (X is defined as the flow rate ratio of hydrogen to silane gas), ranging from 1 to 20, on the structural and optical properties of the deposited films, is extensively investigated by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy, UV/VIS spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Our experimental results reveal that, with the increase of the hydrogen dilution ratio X, the deposition rate Rd and hydrogen content CH are reduced while the crystalline fraction Fc, mean grain size δ and optical bandgap ETauc are increased. In comparison with other plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition methods of nanocrystalline silicon films where a very high hydrogen dilution ratio X is routinely required (e.g. X > 16), we have achieved nanocrystalline silicon films at a very low hydrogen dilution ratio of 1, featuring a high deposition rate of 1.57 nm/s, a high crystalline fraction of 67.1%, a very low hydrogen content of 4.4 at.%, an optical bandgap of 1.89 eV, and an almost vertically aligned columnar structure with a mean grain size of approximately 19 nm. We have also shown that a sufficient amount of atomic hydrogen on the growth surface essential for the formation of nanocrystalline silicon is obtained through highly-effective dissociation of silane and hydrogen molecules in the high-density inductively coupled plasmas.
1. Introduction
Nanocrystalline and amorphous silicon materials have recently been in the spotlight of extensive research efforts as useful thin-film semiconductors owing to their widespread industrial applications in photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, image sensors and thin film transistors.1–5 In thin-film PV solar cells, nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) has been reported to have a higher energy conversion efficiency compared to amorphous silicon.6–9 This is because nc-Si features a reduced light-induced degradation and an enhanced absorption in the near-infrared wavelength range.3,6,7
Nanocrystalline silicon thin films are commonly synthesized from highly H2-diluted SiH4 (e.g. H2:SiH4 > 16:1) reactant gases using capacitively coupled radio-frequency (rf) plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at a very low deposition rate (typically, a few angstrom per second).3,10,11 This severely retards the cost-effective production of nc-Si based solar cells. Furthermore, although higher hydrogen dilution indeed promotes non-epitaxial, nanocrysalline growth, excessive hydrogenation leads to a very high hydrogen content in the films which in turn leads to poor material performance (e.g., degradation upon light exposure, etc.) in solar cells and other applications.3,10
Recently, a couple of alternative approaches have been proposed to improve the deposition rate of nc-Si, for example, high-pressure depletion (HPD) method using conventional rf-PECVD,12 very high-frequency (VHF) PECVD,13 and hot filament chemical vapor deposition.14 However, these existing methods still suffer from a number of unresolved issues. For instance, the disadvantages of the HPD method are particulate and powder formation, gas-phase polymerization, and high gas consumption; the disadvantages for VHF PECVD are poor stability and reproducibility as well as non-uniformity of the film thickness over the substrate area; while those for hot filament chemical vapor deposition are radiative heating of the substrate, non-uniform film thickness, and significant contamination of the filament.
A number of previous experimental results have also shown that the density of atomic hydrogen flux and the energy of ion species impinging on the growth surface play an essential role in the formation processes of nc-Si thin films.15,16 A sufficient amount of atomic hydrogen on the growth surface can enable effective surface coverage by bonded hydrogen and also produce local heating through hydrogen recombination reactions.16,17 This increases the surface diffusion length of Si-based (i.e., SiHx (x = 1,2,3)) radicals and hence facilitates the formation of nanocrystals in the deposited Si thin films. However, a relatively high and uncontrollable ion energy originating from the stochastic fluctuations of large sheath potentials in the capacitively coupled rf plasma processes is considered to be detrimental to the quality of nc-Si thin films since it induces a very large number of defects and decreases the crystalline fraction of the nc-Si thin films.16,18
The very high dilution rates (e.g. H2:SiH4 > 16:1) commonly used in the overwhelming majority of the existing plasma-based techniques are most likely the consequence of the insufficient ability of the plasmas to produce atomic hydrogen. Here we demonstrate the possibility of achieving effective dissociation of hydrogen in the gas mixture of silane and hydrogen through the use of low-pressure, thermally non-equilibrium, low-temperature reactive inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs).19,20 In this way, the degree of hydrogen dilution can be reduced by more than one order of magnitude.
This paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we will present the details of the experimental method and the characterization techniques. The results on the effect of plasma-assisted hydrogenation on the structural and optical properties of the nc-Si thin films are presented in section 3. Section 4 is focused on the discussion of the possible physical plasma-related mechanisms that explain the obtained experimental results in section 3. The paper ends with the short summary in section 5.
2. Experimental
A low-frequency (460 kHz), low-pressure, thermally non-equilibrium ICP plasma reactor has been used to fabricate nc-Si thin films from the reactive silane precursor gas diluted with hydrogen. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental setup for the growth of nc-Si thin films. The plasma is generated in a cylindrical, stainless steel vacuum chamber with the inner radius R = 23 cm and height H = 30 cm. The top plate of the chamber is a fused silica disk, 50 cm in diameter and 1.2 cm thick, which forms a vacuum-tight dielectric window. An epoxy-bonded planar coil (17 turns and 45 cm in outer diameter) is located 3 mm above the quartz window. This coil serves as an rf antenna which transfers rf power across the quartz into the chamber to generate and maintain the discharge. A circular substrate holder is located along the center axis of the chamber and is kept 10 cm above the end-plate. A substrate heater is attached to the bottom of the substrate holder to provide a suitable temperature for the film growth. A 450 l/s turbo-molecular pump backed by a two-stage rotary pump is used to evacuate the plasma chamber. The typical base pressure of ∼1 × 10−5 Torr is routinely achieved. The inflow rate and pressure of the working gas are regulated by a combination of a gate valve and MKS mass-flow controllers.

The deposition parameters of the Si films prepared for this study are listed in Table 1. The hydrogen dilution ratio X in the gas mixtures is calculated as: X = [hydrogen flow (sccm)]/[silane flow (sccm)], where sccm denotes cubic centimeter per minute at standard temperature and pressure. The increase in the hydrogen dilution ratio X was achieved through an increase in the hydrogen flow rate while maintaining the silane flow rate at 4 sccm. The inductive rf power, substrate temperature, and deposition time were kept fixed at 1500 W (plasma volume ∼4.8 × 104 cm3, therefore the rf power density remained at a relatively low value of approximately 0.031 W/cm3),21 200 °C, and 30 min, respectively. The thickness of the deposited films ranged from 2 to 3 µm.

The samples were deposited on two different types of substrates simultaneously: (i) (100) oriented single-crystal Si substrates for Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses; (ii) quartz substrates for optical transmittance analysis. Raman measurements were carried out with a Renishaw micro-Raman system 1000 using a 514.5 nm Ar+ laser for excitation. The crystal structure of the films was analyzed through the use of a Siemens D5005 X-ray diffractometer, operating in a grazing angle mode, wherein the incident X-ray wavelength is 1.54 Å (CuKα line) at 40 kV and 40 mA. The angle between the incident X-ray and the surface of the film was fixed at 1°, and the diffraction pattern was obtained by changing the position of the counter. The IR absorption spectra were conducted using a Perkin-Elmer FTIR 1725X spectrometer in the mid-infrared range from 400 to 4000 cm−1. The surface morphology and cross-section of the deposited films were measured using a JEOL JSM-6700F field emission scanning electron microscope. The film deposition rate Rd was derived from the film thickness (measured by cross-sectional SEM) and deposition time. The optical transmission measurements were performed in the 500–1100 nm spectral range with a Cary 510 Bio spectrometer.
3. Results
In this section, the effect of hydrogen dilution on the structural and optical properties of the deposited Si films is systematically and extensively investigated using a broad range of advanced materials characterization tools. The Raman, XRD, FTIR, optical transmittance, SEM results are presented in sections 3.1 through to 3.5, respectively; whilst the competitive deposition rates obtained in this work are reported in section 3.6.
3.1 
          Raman spectroscopy

Raman measurements were performed to study the crystallinity of the deposited silicon films. Fig. 2 shows the Raman scattering spectra of the samples deposited at different hydrogen dilution ratios X. The dominant peak centered at approximately 520 cm−1 in all the spectra is attributed to the transverse optical (TO) mode of Si–Si vibrations in the crystalline phase.22,23 One can notice that this peak is asymmetric, with an extended tail towards small wavenumbers, which is ascribed to the defective part of the crystalline phase.23,24 Moreover, from the inset of Fig. 2, one can observe that with the increase of the hydrogen dilution ratio X, the peak position of the dominant peak shows a slight up-shift from ∼516 cm−1 at X = 1 to ∼518 cm−1 at X = 20.
 Fig. 2  
Raman spectra of the samples deposited at different hydrogen dilution ratios X. The spectra for different Xs have been shifted vertically for better clarity. The inset shows the slight shift of the dominant peak position more clearly. 
The Raman spectra are fitted with three independent Gaussian peaks: (i) a TO mode of the crystalline silicon narrow peak near 520 cm−1, attributed to silicon crystallites; (ii) an intermediate peak near 510 cm−1, attributed to a defective part of the crystalline phase, which originates from crystallites of diameters less than 10 nm, bond dilation at grain boundaries or a silicon wurzite phase resulting from twin boundaries; (iii) a broad peak at 480 cm−1, attributed to the amorphous silicon phase.23,25 A typical deconvolution of the Raman spectrum of the sample deposited at X = 1 is presented in Fig. 3. The crystalline fraction Fc can be deduced from the deconvoluted Raman spectra using the following equationFc = (Ic + Im)/(Ic + Im + σIa)where Ic is the integrated intensity of the crystalline peak near 520 cm−1, Im is the integrated intensity of the intermediate peak near 510 cm−1, and Ia is the integrated intensity of the amorphous peak at 480 cm−1, σ is the ratio of the integrated Raman cross-sections of the amorphous and crystalline phases. The ratio σ depends on the size of the crystallites (δ) and the excitation wavelength, and can be expressed as σ(δ) = 0.1 + exp[−(δ/250)], with δ in Å. In the nanocrystal size range of our interest, σ is of the order of unity.23,25
 Fig. 3  A typical deconvolution of the Raman spectrum of the sample deposited at a hydrogen dilution ratio of 1. 
The deconvoluted crystalline peak position, intermediate peak position, and the calculated crystalline fraction Fc for all the deposited films are shown in Table 2. One can notice that, with the increase of the hydrogen dilution ratio X, both the crystalline and the intermediate peak positions show a slight blue shift. This slight blue shift of the value of wavenumber may be caused by the crystallite size effect and stress within the material, i.e., the larger is the crystallite size, the larger is the wavenumber.23,25 Furthermore, one can observe that, with the increased hydrogen dilution ratio X, the crystalline fraction Fc shows a monotonous increase from 67.1% at a hydrogen dilution ratio of 1 to 78.2% at a hydrogen dilution ratio of 20. This observation is in good agreement with the work of Das et al.,26 who reported that, with the increase of the substrate temperature from 270 to 370 °C, the crystallinity of the deposited Si films was improved and the crystalline peak position shifted slightly from 516 to 518 cm−1.

3.2 
          X-Ray diffraction

The crystal structure of the deposited silicon films was studied by XRD. Fig. 4(a) shows the XRD spectra of the samples deposited at different hydrogen dilution ratios X recorded in the range 25–60°. It is evident from this figure that all the deposited films have three pronounced diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.4°, 47.3°, and 56.1°, which are attributed to (111), (220), and (311) crystallographic orientations of silicon, respectively.11,27 This suggests that nanocrystalline silicon can be formed even at a very low hydrogen dilution ratio of 1. One can also notice that all the samples have a preferential (111) growth direction. The preferential growth along the (111) direction may be due to the fact that the surface energy of the (111) crystal plane is the lowest among all the crystal planes.26

Fig. 4(b) shows the XRD patterns of the nc-Si films recorded in the range 26–30°. One can notice that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (111) peak narrows with the increased hydrogen dilution ratio X, suggesting that the crystallite size becomes larger. The mean grain size δ, calculated from the FWHM of the (111) peak using the Scherrer's formula, is plotted in Fig. 5 as a function of the hydrogen dilution ratio X. One can see that the mean grain size δ increases from 19 nm at X = 1 to 36 nm at X = 20. This increase of the mean grain size δ with the increased hydrogen dilution ratio X may be due to the enhanced coalescence of neighbouring nc-Si nuclei as a result of the reduction of the surface reactivity of the adsorbed SiHx (x = 1,2,3) radicals on the partially hydrogen-terminated growth surface at a higher hydrogen dilution ratio X.23 It needs to be pointed out that the XRD results agree well with the analysis of the Raman spectra, which show a slight blue shift of the crystalline peak position.

3.3 
          FTIR absorption spectroscopy

FTIR absorption measurements were conducted to investigate the Si–H bonding configurations and estimate the bonded hydrogen content CH in the deposited silicon thin films. Fig. 6(a) and 6(b) show the IR spectra of the characteristic wagging and stretching modes of Si–H bonding for the samples deposited at different hydrogen dilution ratios X, respectively. From Fig. 6(a), one can observe that the peak position of the wagging mode decreases slightly from 630 cm−1 at X = 1 to 625 cm−1 at X = 20. This slight decrease of the wavenumber at higher hydrogen dilution ratios X may originate from the increased rigidity of the Si–Si bonds. This is consistent with the results of the Raman and XRD analyses which suggest better crystallization at higher hydrogen dilution ratios X.25,28
 Fig. 6  
FTIR spectra of Si–H bonding for the samples deposited at different hydrogen dilution ratios X: (a) wagging mode; (b) stretching mode. 
It can be seen from Fig. 6(b) that the peak position of the Si–H stretching mode for all the deposited films is located at approximately 2090 cm−1. This value is different from the characteristic stretching mode of the Si–H bonds for the hydrogenated amorphous silicon films featuring a FTIR peak at approximately 2000 cm−1. This blue shift of the characteristic wavenumber of the Si–H bonds between the hydrogenated amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon films can be attributed to the formation of clustered SiH at inner surfaces of microvoids or grain boundaries during the formation of the nanocrystalline phase.25
The bonded hydrogen content CH (in atomic %) was evaluated from the peak corresponding to the Si–H wagging mode at ∼630 cm−1, shown in Fig. 6(a), using the following formula,  where Aw = 1.6 × 1019cm−2, α(ω) is the absorption coefficient, ω is the wavenumber in cm−1, and NSi is the atomic density of the crystalline silicon and equal to 5 × 1022 cm−3.26,28 The estimated bonded hydrogen content CH of the deposited films as a function of the hydrogen dilution ratio X is plotted in Fig. 7. One can see that all the deposited films feature very low hydrogen contents (less than 5 at.%), and the hydrogen content CH decreases from 4.4 at.% at X = 1 to 2.7 at.% at X = 20. Too high a hydrogen content in the films quite often leads to the formation of microvoids, and consequently, lower mass density.23,28 Previous reports show that hydrogen is a major factor to cause Staebler-Wronski effect, which leads to the significant degradation of the stability of the Si-based thin film solar cells.23,28 Therefore, the nc-Si films prepared by the ICP-assisted CVD are particularly suitable for photovoltaic solar cell applications since low hydrogen content in the films has been achieved in this process. The observed lower hydrogen content at a higher hydrogen dilution ratio X possibly originates from the stronger etching effect of the amorphous phase during the growth processes. This trend of decreasing the hydrogen content with the increase of the hydrogen dilution ratio X has frequently been observed in the synthesis of amorphous and nanocrystalline Si. For instance, Han et al.25 observed that the CH decreased from ∼12 at.% at X = 1 to ∼4 at.% at X = 10 using hot-wire chemical vapor deposition of nc-Si films at a substrate temperature of 250 °C, while Mukhopadhyay et al.23 found that the CH reduced from 23 at.% at X = 9 to 5 at.% at X = 32 using capacitively coupled rf PECVD at a substrate temperature of 170 °C.

          UV/VIS spectroscopy
        
The optical transmittance measurements were undertaken to deduce the optical bandgap of the deposited nc-Si films. The Tauc formulation  where α is the optical absorption coefficient, E is the photon energy, B is the joint optical density of states, was used to extract the optical bandgap ETauc from a linear fit.21Fig. 8 shows the deduced ETauc of the deposited nc-Si films as a function of the hydrogen dilution ratio X. One can see that the ETauc varies in the range 1.89–2.05 eV and exhibits a slight increase at higher hydrogen dilution ratios X.
 Fig. 8  The optical bandgap ETauc of the deposited silicon films as a function of the hydrogen dilution ratio X. 
It has been suggested by Bhattacharya and Das11 that the optical bandgap of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon films depends on two main factors: the hydrogen content CH and the crystalline fraction Fc. Specifically, a high hydrogen content CH and a large crystalline fraction Fc lead to a wider optical bandgap of the deposited silicon films, and vice versa. In our case, the observed trend of widening the optical bandgap with the increased hydrogen dilution ratio X is an overall result of two counteracting effects: the increased crystalline fraction Fc revealed by the Raman analysis and the decreased hydrogen content CH revealed by the FTIR analysis.
3.5 
          Scanning electron microscopy

The surface morphology and microstructure of the deposited Si films were studied by SEM. All the deposited films have a similar surface morphology and microstructure. Fig. 9(a) and 9(b) show the typical top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the sample deposited at a hydrogen dilution ratio of 5. As shown in Fig. 9(a), the surface morphology features smooth and homogenously uniform spherical-like nanocrystalline grains with a typical size between a few to several tens of nanometers. The SEM top-view image also reveals clear grain boundaries and voids between the crystals. One can observe from Fig. 9(b) that the crystal grains form columnar structures that extend vertically through the whole film thickness. These vertical columnar structures can provide effective channels for carrier transport in nanocrystalline silicon films.

3.6 Deposition rate Rd
The variation of the deposition rate Rd as a function of the hydrogen dilution ratio X is presented in Fig. 10. The Rd decreases slightly from 1.57 nm/s at X = 1 to 1.25 nm/s at X = 20. This slight decrease of Rd with the increase of the hydrogen dilution ratio X may be attributed to the enhanced surface hydrogen abstraction by the impinging H atoms and the enhanced scission and etching of the weak or strained Si–Si bonds by hydrogen atom insertion at a higher hydrogen dilution ratio X.10 However, these deposition rates, even at a high hydrogen dilution ratio of 20, are very competitive, compared with other techniques of fabrication of nc-Si thin films. For example, the maximum deposition rate obtained by Mukhopadhyay et al.23 was approximately 0.5 Å/s using capactively coupled rf-PECVD; while the maximum deposition rate achieved by Jadkar et al.14 was ∼6 Å/s viahot wire CVD.

4. Discussion
We now interpret the results obtained based on the unique properties of the high-density inductively coupled plasma source. One of the main findings in this work is that a high hydrogen dilution is not an essential prerequisite for the formation of nc-Si films in low-temperature, low-pressure plasma-based processes. As was mentioned previously, in the conventional rf PECVD processes based on capacitively coupled plasmas, nc-Si thin films are commonly prepared from highly H2-diluted SiH4 (e.g. H2:SiH4 > 16:1) reactant gases, leading to a very low deposition rate (typically, a few angstroms per second).3,10,11 Whereas, the nc-Si thin films with a high crystalline fraction of 67.1% and a high deposition rate of 1.57 nm/s can be achieved at an ultra-low hydrogen dilution ratio of 1 in the ICP-based processes used in this work.
In order to explain the formation processes of nc-Si thin films from the glow discharge of the gas mixture of silane and hydrogen, three main models have been proposed: a surface-diffusion model, an etching model, and a chemical-annealing model.14,29 All these three models assume that the density of atomic hydrogen flux impinging on the growth surface plays a crucial role in facilitating the crystallization of the silicon films. In other words, the atomic hydrogen flux must be large enough to enable the crystallization of the deposited silicon films.
It has already been shown in our previous works that the ICP source has the capability of producing high-density plasmas, a factor of 10–100 times denser than the plasmas produced by capacitive discharges.19,30 These high-density plasmas enable high dissociation degrees of the silane and hydrogen molecules through a range of strong inelastic interactions between electrons and silane/hydrogen molecules including the processes of excitation, ionization, and dissociation.19,20 This gives rise to a strong atomic hydrogen flux in the plasma even at an ultra-low hydrogen dilution ratio of 1. A large amount of atomic hydrogen in the plasma in our case can give rise to a higher surface coverage by bonded hydrogen, stronger local heating through hydrogen recombination on the growth surface, and higher etching rates to remove the disordered material.17,29 This causes a significant reduction of the surface diffusion activation energy, and therefore, a large surface diffusion length of SiHx (x = 1,2,3) radicals on the growth surface can be achieved.17 This highly-effective diffusion enables the adsorbed SiHx (x = 1,2,3) radicals on the growth surface to reach the most energetically favorable sites and hence a relaxed and ordered nanocrystalline structure can be formed even at a low hydrogen ratio of 1.23,29,31
Furthermore, the ion/radical fluxes and ion-bombarding energy on the growth surface can be independently controlled in the ICP-based processes.19,32 This makes it possible to achieve a large flux of reactive species while keeping the energy of impinging ions at a relatively low value (less than 10 eV).32 In this way, one can reach the optimum deposition conditions for the nc-Si thin films which require reduced ion fluxes/energies while having a sufficiently large ratio of hydrogen atoms to SiHx (x = 1,2,3) radicals. Under such conditions, the rates of crystallization can be competitive with the rates of etching and amorphous silicon deposition33 as well as with the rates of charged nanocluster formation in the gas phase; under certain conditions these nanoclusters provide an additional channel for nuclei formation required for the growth of nc-Si films.8
We stress that, with a further increase of the hydrogen dilution ratio X, the surface coverage factor of atomic hydrogen flux can be further increased. This further reduces the surface reactivity of the adsorbed SiHx (x = 1,2,3) radicals, enhances surface hydrogen abstraction by the impinging H atoms, and enhances scission and etching of the weak or strained Si–Si bonds by hydrogen atom insertion, and thus enlarges the surface diffusion length of adsorbed SiHx (x = 1,2,3) radicals on the growth surface, eventually resulting in a relatively high crystalline fraction Fc and a large mean grain size δ observed in the experiments.23,29 In this way, one can eventually obtain high-quality polycrystalline Si under reasonably low temperatures.34
5. Conclusion
In this work, we have investigated the structural and optical properties of the deposited silicon thin films under different hydrogen dilution ratios X, ranging from 1 to 20, by ICP-assisted CVD35,36 using silane precursor diluted with hydrogen. It is found that, with the increase of the hydrogen dilution ratio X, the deposition rate Rd and hydrogen content CH are reduced while the crystalline fraction Fc, mean grain size δ and optical bandgap ETauc are increased. Our experimental results clearly show that nc-Si thin films can be formed at a very low hydrogen dilution ratio of 1. The synthesized nc-Si features a high deposition rate of 1.57 nm/s, a very low hydrogen content of 4.4 at.%, a high crystalline fraction of 67.1%, an optical bandgap of 1.89 eV, and an almost vertically aligned columnar structure with a mean grain size of approximately 19 nm. On the other hand, the nc-Si thin films with a high crystalline fraction of 78.2%, a very low hydrogen content of 2.7 at.%, and a large mean grain size of 36 nm have been synthesized at a hydrogen dilution ratio of 20.
Furthermore, we have shown that a high hydrogen dilution is not an essential prerequisite for the formation of nc-Si films in the low-temperature plasma-based processes. The large amount of atomic hydrogen on the growth surface required for the formation of nc-Si can be obtained by the effective dissociation of silane and hydrogen molecules in the ICP-based processes even at a low hydrogen dilution ratio of 1. This highly-effective fabrication technique offers the possibility for up-scaling and high-throughput industrially-viable processes involving low-temperature fabrication of functional nc-Si layers.
