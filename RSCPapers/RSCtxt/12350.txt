, Accepted 13th June 2023First published on 14th June 2023AbstractDeveloping electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability at high current densities is crucial for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. However, the dissolution of electrocatalysts in oxidative acidic electrolytes results in performance degradation, especially at high current densities. Here, we report a chromium–iridium oxide electrocatalyst with strong coupling interfaces, endowing it with high activity and stability. The electrocatalyst has an ultralow overpotential of 425 mV to reach 2 A cm−2 for acidic oxygen evolution and operates stably for 100 h with a negligible degradation rate at 1 A cm−2. A proton exchange membrane electrolyzer using this catalyst needs only 1.63 V to reach 1 A cm−2 and 1.73 V to reach 2 A cm−2 under industrial conditions. The corresponding electricity cost of hydrogen production is calculated to be US$0.87 per kg of H2, which fulfills the requirement of the US Department of Energy by 2026 (US$2.0 per kg of H2). This work not only introduces a new strategy to produce efficient and stable electrocatalysts, but also indicates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.

Broader context
Green hydrogen produced by water electrolysis is key to realize global mission of carbon neutrality. Electrocatalysts used in hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that can work well at high current densities is a prerequisite for efficient green hydrogen production in water electrolyzers. However, developing highly active and durable OER electrocatalysts remains a dilemma due to strong anodic polarization effect and harsh acidic corrosion. To solve this problem, the key is constructing an active and robust electrode to improve both catalytic activity and the corrosion-resistant ability. Here we report a chromium-iridium oxide catalyst with high performance to address the above challenges. The catalyst has strong coupling between active IrO2 and corrosion-resistant CrO2, which can optimize the intermediate adsorption energy for OER and strengthen the Ir-O bond, hence endowing it with high activity and durability. As a result, this catalyst delivers ultrahigh current density at a low cell voltage and decent stability in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. The hydrogen production cost of this electrolyzer is lower than the DOE (US) targets in 2026. This work not only introduces a new strategy to produce highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts, but also allows their practical use in industrial electrolyzers.

1. Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) is an indispensable energy carrier for future carbon neutrality with the benefits of high energy density and environmental neutrality1,2 Water electrolysis powered by sustainable electricity offers a promising strategy to generate green H2 with negligible carbon emission3–5 Among various water electrolysis technologies, the proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer is promising due to its advantages of high-current–density operation, high energy conversion efficiency, and high hydrogen purity6–8 Developing high-performance electrocatalysts at high current densities is a prerequisite for the industrial use of PEM electrolyzer technology.9 Up to now, research on electrocatalysts for cathodic hydrogen evolution has made many advances in terms of activity and durability when operating at high current densities.10,11 However, the development of catalysts for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at high current densities is challenging, which is a bottleneck affecting the efficiency and lifetime of the PEM electrolyzers and hinders their industrial use.12
The OER with four-proton-coupled electron transfer requires a high overpotential to generate oxygen due to the sluggish kinetics, thereby decreasing the energy efficiency of H2 production in PEM electrolyzers.13 Besides, the stability of catalysts at high-current–density operation is another serious issue because of strong anodic polarization and acidic corrosion.14,15 Researchers have devoted great attention to catalyst design using various strategies including alloying,16–19 core–shell construction,20–22 doping,23–25 etc. Based on these strategies, different types of electrocatalysts have been developed, such as perovskite oxides and pyrochlore oxides, which show good activity at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.26,27 These electrocatalysts have high mass activity with low-noble-metal contents. However, most reported electrocatalysts have an excellent performance only at a low current density of 10 mA cm−2, and their performance at high current densities is unsatisfactory for industrial implementation.28,29 There are two key challenges to make robust acidic OER catalysts at high current densities. One is strong anodic polarization which destroys the active sites, causing a loss of catalytic activity. The other is the high local concentration of protons near the catalytic surface, which corrodes the active sites, resulting in poor durability of the catalysts. Recently, noticeable progress has been made in the acidic OER at high current densities (≥1 A cm−2). Li et al. have prepared a W–Ir–B alloy catalyst with ∼200 nm deep nanochannels,30 which delivers a current density of 2 A cm−2 with an overpotential of 497 mV, but its performance in a PEM electrolyzer remains unexplored. In another study, Li et al. have reported a binary oxide Co2MnO4 catalyst,31 which needs 670 mV to achieve 2 A cm−2 but loses performance after a 60 h stability test at 0.2 A cm−2 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Currently, the reported electrocatalysts have either good activity or good stability at high current densities but not both, and thus fail to meet the requirements of the US Department of Energy (DOE).32–34 To boost the OER performance at high current densities, the development of an active and stable electrode to improve both the activity and corrosion-resistance of the catalyst is needed. IrO2 is one of the most important active components since it has high intrinsic activity and is stable in acidic electrolytes. Due to the high cost of Ir, decreasing the Ir loading without sacrificing the performance is important for the goal of reducing the H2 production cost in PEM electrolyzers.35 The key for electrode design is to introduce an acid- and oxidation-resistant component, which can optimize the adsorption energy of intermediates and improve the ability of corrosion resistance.36,37 The question is how to design such an electrode structure.
In this work, we report a chromium–iridium oxide electrocatalyst produced by incorporating IrO2 in CrO2 pores. Taking advantage of the strong coupling between CrO2 and IrO2, the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst needs a low overpotential of 425 mV at 2 A cm−2 for the OER in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, surpassing that of the commercial IrO2 electrocatalyst. The amount of Ir loaded in the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst is only 50.0 μg cm−2, but the catalyst has a high mass activity of 762 A gIr−1. More important is that it operates stably at 1 A cm−2 for 100 h with negligible performance loss. A PEM electrolyzer using this catalyst has a cell voltage of 1.63 V at 1 A cm−2 and 1.73 V at 2 A cm−2 under industrial conditions, suggesting its clear industrial use potential.
2. Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst
We first synthesize porous chromium oxide on a porous titanium (Ti) foil by a hydrothermal method and calcination, and then disperse the Ir precursors on the chromium oxide and use electrochemical oxidation to obtain the chromium–iridium oxide electrocatalyst (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, S2, see details in the ESI†). The diffraction peaks in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern indicate IrO2 (JCPDS, No. 43-1019) and CrO2 (JCPDS, No. 09-0332)38,39 (Fig. 1b). Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) indicates that the atomic ratio of Cr/Ir is about 6.1 (Table S1, ESI†), so the electrocatalyst is denoted as CrO2–0.16IrO2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that it has a rod-like nanostructure with the rods covered by very small crystallites (Fig. 1c and Fig. S4, ESI†). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) shows that the IrO2 nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in the CrO2 pores (Fig. 1d), thus forming many interfaces between the two components. For example, interfaces between CrO2 (101) and IrO2 (110) (Fig. 1e and f) and between CrO2 (110) and IrO2 (101) (Fig. S6, ESI†) are produced. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental maps (Fig. 1g) show the uniform distribution of Cr, Ir, and O in CrO2–0.16IrO2, further showing the highly dispersed IrO2 nanoparticles in the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst. Overall, these results confirm the formation of highly dispersed IrO2 nanoparticles embedded in porous CrO2.

Electronic structure of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst
An XPS survey indicates that Cr, Ir, and O elements exist in the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst (Fig. S8, ESI†), which is consistent with the EDS results (Fig. S7, ESI†). Fig. 2a shows that there are two sets of doublet peaks for Cr 2p in the region between 572.0 eV and 592.0 eV. The primary Cr 2p peaks of CrO2–0.16IrO2 center at 577.3 eV and 587.4 eV,40 corresponding to Cr4+. The peaks show positive shifts of 0.8 eV compared to those of Cr2O3.41 This is because of the electrochemical oxidation of the original chromium–iridium oxide and is consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 1b and Fig. S5, ESI†). Fig. 2b shows two sets of doublet peaks for Ir 4f in the region between 56.0 and 72.0 eV,42,43 corresponding to Ir4+ and Ir>4+. It can be clearly observed that the Ir 4f peaks in the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst shift to a higher binding energy by 0.3 eV compared to the IrO2 sample,44 suggesting a higher valence state of the Ir sites in CrO2–0.16IrO2. This is caused by the electrochemical oxidation in the synthesis of the CrO2–0.16IrO2. To investigate the electronic structure of the CrO2–0.16IrO2, we perform X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements at the Ir L3-edge.45 Fig. 2c shows the Ir L3-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) for CrO2–0.16IrO2 and a reference IrO2 sample. A shift to a higher energy is observed at the white line peak for CrO2–0.16IrO2 compared to the reference IrO2 sample, suggesting a higher valence state of Ir, which is consistent with the XPS results (Fig. 2b). Fourier transforms of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) in the Ir L3-edge curves of CrO2–0.16IrO2 show a peak at 1.5 Å, which is quite close to that of IrO2 (Fig. 2d), and therefore attributable to the Ir–O bond in CrO2–0.16IrO2. These results suggest that the Cr4+ changes the electronic states of Ir in CrO2–0.16IrO2.

Acidic OER performance at high current densities
We then study the acidic OER performance of the chromium–iridium oxide electrocatalysts. All the electrochemical measurements are conducted in a typical three-electrode setup in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. We study the activity of chromium–iridium oxide electrocatalysts with different Cr/Ir ratios of 2:1, 6:1, and 10:1 (the electrocatalysts are denoted as CrO2-0.5IrO2, CrO2–0.16IrO2, CrO2-0.09IrO2) and find that the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst shows the best activity (Fig. S10, ESI†). Fig. 3a and Fig. S13 (ESI†) show that the overpotential of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst is only 425 mV at 2000 mA cm−2, which is much smaller than that of the commercial IrO2 electrocatalyst (845 mV @ 2000 mA cm−2), as well as IrO2 nanoparticles (944 mV @ 2000 mA cm−2) and CrO2 nanoparticles (1405 mV @ 30 mA cm−2) synthesized by the same template method. These results indicate a small energy barrier and superior catalytic performance of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst for high current density operation. The CrO2–0.16IrO2 has a smaller Tafel slope (41.5 mV dec−1) than IrO2 (70.3 mV dec−1) (Fig. S14, ESI†), suggesting the improved dynamics of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst. The indicator Δη/Δlog|j| is used to evaluate the catalytic performance at different current densities.46 In Fig. 3b, this ratio for CrO2–0.16IrO2 increases from 41.5 mV dec−1 at 100–101 mA cm−2 to 91.4 mV dec−1 at 102–103 mA cm−2 while the commercial IrO2 shows a dramatic increase (70.3 mV dec−1 to 283.9 mV dec−1) over the same current density range, suggesting fast kinetics in the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst at high current densities. The TOF value of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst is 0.88 s−1 at 1.53 V vs. RHE, suggesting its high intrinsic activity (see details in the ESI†). To provide a convincing assessment of the intrinsic activity, the mass activity of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst normalized by the mass of Ir loaded is shown in Fig. 3c. The corresponding value of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst is 762 A gIr−1 with an Ir loading of 50.0 μg cm−2, which is larger than that of the commercial IrO2 and most reported Ir-based electrocatalysts for the acidic OER (Fig. 3c and Table S3, ESI†). In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy curves show that CrO2–0.16IrO2 has a low charge transfer resistance of 1.95 Ω cmgeo2, which shows its excellent charge transfer (Fig. S15, ESI†). Double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is used to calculate the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 and Fig. S16 (ESI†) shows that it has a Cdl value of 79.1 mF cm−2, which is about 2.5 times higher than that of IrO2 (31.0 mF cm−2). A higher ECSA indicates that it has more exposed active sites. It also has a higher ECSA normalized activity than that of commercial IrO2 (Fig. S17, ESI†), confirming its high OER activity.

(h) Comparison of the test current density and corresponding degradation rate between this work and other electrocatalysts in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. 
To study the practicability of using the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst, we evaluate its long-term durability. It maintains a high activity with a negligible degradation rate (only 0.5 mV h−1) for 100 h at 1000 mA cm−2, indicating stable operation at a high current density (Fig. 3d). The amount of Ir dissolved during use is important for evaluating the stability of the catalysts, so we collect the H2SO4 electrolyte after the chronopotentiometry (CP) test every ten hours and measure the amount of dissolved Ir by ICP-OES (Table S2, ESI†). Fig. 3e presents the dissolution amount of Ir from CrO2–0.16IrO2 and commercial IrO2 electrocatalysts. The dissolution amount at 100 h of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst (8.8 ± 0.2 μg) is much lower than that of the commercial IrO2 electrocatalyst (54.7 ± 0.6 μg), showing its superior anti-corrosion ability at high current densities. At the initial stage, a small amount of Ir dissolved because they are isolated IrO2 nanoparticles without strong coupling interfaces. The remaining IrO2 nanoparticles are firmly anchored on the porous CrO2 substrate, and have high stability; therefore, the Ir dissolution amount shows nearly no change for the next 90 h. There are no obvious morphology changes (Fig. S21 and S22, ESI†), electronic structure changes (Fig. S23–S25, ESI†), or lattice changes (Fig. S26, ESI†) observed in CrO2–0.16IrO2 after a long-term CP test for 100 h, showing its durability in the acidic OER at high current densities. We also investigated the stability of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst under simulated conditions of wind/solar energy through a CP test (Fig. S27, ESI†). The range of the voltage changes from 1.45 V to 2.25 V to simulate the volatile renewable energy inputs. After a 24 hour operation, the performance of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst is maintained well, further demonstrating its excellent stability and application prospects.
To provide a comprehensive assessment of the excellent performance of CrO2–0.16IrO2 at high current densities, its activity is compared with other state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts in Fig. 3f (Table S4, ESI†) and Fig. 3g (Table S5, ESI†). Fig. 3f shows that the obtained current density of the most advanced electrocatalysts used in an acidic OER is lower than 500 mA cm−2, which is insufficient for industrial use in PEM electrolyzers. In contrast, CrO2–0.16IrO2 has a high current density of 2000 mA cm−2 and has an obvious advantage at 200 mA cm−2 with a competitive overpotential of 350 mV. Besides, we compare CrO2–0.16IrO2 with two recently reported OER electrocatalysts, which could also reach 2000 mA cm−2 in an acidic electrolyte. The CrO2–0.16IrO2 has much lower overpotentials under 1000, 1500, and 2000 mA cm−2 than the reported W–Ir–B30 and Co2MnO431 electrocatalysts (Fig. 3g), indicating a superior activity at high current densities. In addition, most current densities of stability tests reported in the literature are at a level of 10 mA cm−2 (Table S6, ESI†), which is far below industrial requirements even though it is regarded as the benchmark criterion for stability evaluation. We compared tests at current densities higher than 10 mA cm−2, and the corresponding degradation rates for our work and other state-to-the-art electrocatalysts using a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte and test times >24 h. The CrO2–0.16IrO2 is the only one that remains active above a current density of 1000 mA cm−2 with the current densities for other reported studies only measured at ≤200 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3h and Table S7, ESI†). The degradation rate of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst is 0.5 mV h−1 at 1000 mA cm−2, which is much smaller than those of other electrocatalysts at 200 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3h), indicating its superior stability to all current electrocatalysts. Overall, these results indicate the superior OER performance of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst at high current densities in an acidic electrolyte.
Theoretical understanding
Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was used to investigate the relationship between the strong coupling and electrocatalytic performance.47,48 There are two main interfaces in the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst according to the HRTEM images (Fig. 4a and Fig. S28, ESI†); one is the interface between CrO2 (101) and IrO2 (110) (denoted as CrO2–0.16IrO2 (101-110)) and the other is the interface between CrO2 (110) and IrO2 (101) (denoted as CrO2–0.16IrO2 (110-101)). It is clearly seen that there is a lattice mismatch when embedding IrO2 into CrO2 because of the difference in interplanar spacings at the interface. This structural feature may produce a change of catalytic activity and stability on the active sites. Fig. 4b shows the four-step reaction process for the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst based on the adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM), mainly involving the adsorption and desorption of OH*, O*, and OOH* intermediates.49 To further confirm the AEM pathway, we carried out operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) experiments with isotope 18O-labelling measurements. The DEMS results show that there is no lattice oxygen evolution during the OER, implying the AEM pathway in the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst (Fig. S29, ESI†). The corresponding free energy diagrams and the potential-determining steps are shown in Fig. 4c. The free energy increases of the potential-determining steps for the active sites of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 (101-110) and (110-101) interfaces are 1.776 and 1.891 eV, respectively, which are much smaller than that of IrO2 alone (1.970 eV) (Fig. S30, ESI†). Therefore, the incorporation of CrO2 effectively increases the OER activity, which is attributed to the local structural re-ordering and charge redistribution induced by strong coupling between IrO2 and CrO2. The density of states (DOS) comparisons (Fig. 4d) show that there are more peaks and overlaps corresponding to the bonding states between Ir 5d and O 2p orbitals in CrO2–0.16IrO2 compared to IrO2 from −10 eV to 5 eV. The increased overlap area of these orbitals indicates a stronger Ir–O bond, resulting in the shortening of the bond length.50 We also calculate the average bond length of the models between two major interfaces in the CrO2–0.16IrO2 and IrO2 electrocatalysts (Fig. 4e), and find a slight decrease of the average Ir-O bond length in CrO2–0.16IrO2 (1.94 Å) compared to IrO2 (2.00 Å). This result also indicates a stronger Ir–O bond in CrO2–0.16IrO2 than in IrO2 which is in agreement with the DOS and XPS results (Fig. 2b). These results show that strong coupling between IrO2 and CrO2 decreases the energy barrier and reduces the Ir–O bond length, thus optimizing the OER activity and stability, respectively.

Performance of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst in a PEM electrolyzer
Finally, we evaluate the PEM electrolyzer performance of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst at 80 °C, which is the simulated industrial condition and widely used in the literature. We make a PEM electrolyzer using the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst as the anodic catalyst and commercial Pt/C as the cathodic catalyst (Fig. 5a and b). The polarization curves in Fig. 5c indicate that the electrolyzer using CrO2–0.16IrO2 needs a cell voltage of 1.63 V to achieve 1 A cm−2 and 1.73 V to achieve 2 A cm−2, which outperforms the electrolyzer using the commercial IrO2 (1.93 V at 2 A cm−2) and other reported Ir-based electrocatalysts (Fig. 5d and Table S8, ESI†). Moreover, the PEM electrolyzer using CrO2–0.16IrO2 operates stably at 1 A cm−2 for 100 h with a negligible loss of activity (0.5 mV h−1). The faradaic efficiency of hydrogen generation in this PEM electrolyzer is nearly 100%. The Ir loading amount of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst is 0.59 mg cm−2 in the PEM electrolyzer, which is about 4 times lower than commercial usage and would lead to significant reduction in the capital costs of the electrolyzer. According to the calculations from the reported Ta0.1Tm0.1Ir0.8O2 and Ir/Nb2O5−x electrocatalysts, as well as the US Department of Energy (DOE),32–34 the estimated electricity cost per kg of H2 produced by this electrolyzer is about US$ 0.87 (see details in ESI†), which is much lower than the US DOE target of US$ 2.0 per kg of H2. The energy efficiency of the PEM electrolyzer (20% Pt/C‖CrO2–0.16IrO2) reaches 76.7% at 1 A cm−2. The corresponding H2 production rate is calculated to be 5.18 × 10−6 mol H2 cm−2 s−1. These results suggest the excellent performance of the CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst for green hydrogen production on a PEM electrolyzer.

3. Conclusions
We prepare a CrO2–0.16IrO2 electrocatalyst that has superior activity and stability for high current density acidic oxygen evolution. The strong coupling between IrO2 and CrO2 decreases the energy barrier of IrO2 sites for the OER and shortens the Ir–O bond length, improving the OER activity and stability. We also extend the lab-scale performance study of this electrocatalyst to a PEM electrolyzer, which achieves a current density of 2 A cm−2 with a low cell voltage of 1.73 V and operates steadily at 1 A cm−2 for 100 h. The electricity cost of H2 production is US$ 0.87 per kg H2, which meets the target set by the US DOE for 2026 (US$ 2.0 per kg H2), indicating the potential use of this electrocatalyst. The catalyst design strategy reported in this work can be extended to other material systems and electrochemical reactions, promoting their practical applications at industrially required high current densities.

Broader context
Green hydrogen produced by water electrolysis is key to realize global mission of carbon neutrality. Electrocatalysts used in hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that can work well at high current densities is a prerequisite for efficient green hydrogen production in water electrolyzers. However, developing highly active and durable OER electrocatalysts remains a dilemma due to strong anodic polarization effect and harsh acidic corrosion. To solve this problem, the key is constructing an active and robust electrode to improve both catalytic activity and the corrosion-resistant ability. Here we report a chromium-iridium oxide catalyst with high performance to address the above challenges. The catalyst has strong coupling between active IrO2 and corrosion-resistant CrO2, which can optimize the intermediate adsorption energy for OER and strengthen the Ir-O bond, hence endowing it with high activity and durability. As a result, this catalyst delivers ultrahigh current density at a low cell voltage and decent stability in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. The hydrogen production cost of this electrolyzer is lower than the DOE (US) targets in 2026. This work not only introduces a new strategy to produce highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts, but also allows their practical use in industrial electrolyzers.
