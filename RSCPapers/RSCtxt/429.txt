    , Accepted 31st July 2018First published on 4th August 2018AbstractEfficient charge separation of photo-generated electrons and holes is critical to achieve high solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. N-type doping is generally used to improve the conductivity by increasing the majority carrier density and enhance the charge separation in the photoanode. However, minority carrier transport is also very important in the process of charge separation, especially in materials that possess inadequate minority carrier mobility. Herein, we take a BiVO4 PEC water splitting cell as an example to demonstrate how to analyze the limiting factor and to formulate the corresponding solutions to improve the hole mobility. The benefits and problems caused by n-type doping (W-doping here) of BiVO4 are analyzed. Codoping with Ti further enhances the charge separation by improving the hole transport and leads to a cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset potential. A high charge separation efficiency (79% at 1.23 VRHE) in a compact BiVO4 photoanode has been achieved without any nanostructure formation. Theoretical results show that W–Ti codoping has decreased the hole polaron hopping activation energy by 11.5% compared with mono-W doping, and this has resulted in a hole mobility increase by 29%. The calculated adsorption energy and reaction Gibbs free energies indicate that the Ti site is energetically more favorable for water splitting. Moreover, the Ti site possesses a lower overpotential in the W–Ti codoped sample compared with the mono-W doped sample. The current study indicates that in order to improve the solar energy conversion efficiency, there should be a balanced charge transport of both majority and minority charge carriers. This can be achieved by simply choosing appropriate codoping elements.
1. Introduction
Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable and clean energy sources to overcome the environmental challenges caused by fossil fuel consumption. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar water splitting is one of the most promising solutions to convert solar energy into clean chemical energy.1–4 Efficient charge separation of photo-generated electrons and holes is critical to achieving high solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency. Doping is an effective way to improve the conductivity by increasing the majority carrier density and enhance the charge separation.5,6 However, minority carrier transport should not be neglected, especially for those having a poor transport ability. In principle, a well-balanced electron and hole transport is crucial for high efficiency;7 however, research in this area is still lacking.
Nanostructuring is known to be an effective strategy to shorten the carrier transport distance from where it is generated to the surface reaction site, which could effectively reduce the photo-generated carrier recombination.6,8–12 Creation of heterojunctions is another effective way to enhance the minority carrier transport, using the internal electric field formed between the junction to facilitate the charge carrier separation.13,14 A gradient-doped structure, in which the surface doping concentration is lower than the bulk concentration, is also an effective way to promote the minority carrier to diffuse to the surface.15,16 However, these strategies do not change the mobility of minority carriers. A fundamental understanding of intrinsic minority transport is still lacking.
In addition to bulk charge separation, surface charge injection to oxidize water is also a key step to the energy conversion efficiency. Due to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction and the presence of surface states, surface recombination is generally inevitable. Thus, these recombination losses lead to low charge transfer efficiency and high overpotential for PEC water oxidation. Numerous approaches including surface treatment or etching,17–19 overlayer coating,20–24 and electrocatalyst deposition6,25,26 have been applied to effectively suppress the surface recombination. However, there is a lack of understanding of the surface catalytic properties of both pristine and doped BiVO4 in the existing literature.
Here, we take a BiVO4 PEC water splitting cell as an example to demonstrate how to analyze the limitation factor for the energy conversion efficiency, as well as to formulate the corresponding solutions to improve the charge separation. Codoping was employed here to overcome the limitations on the basis of the reported enhancement.27–31 The surface catalytic properties of pristine and doped BiVO4 are analyzed from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. Monoclinic BiVO4 is one of the most promising photoanodes for PEC water-splitting. Its 2.4 eV optical bandgap corresponds to a theoretical conversion efficiency of 9.1%. It also possesses a favorable conduction band edge position for water splitting.6,16,32,33 In previous reports, W or Mo doping was found to be effective in enhancing the electronic conductivity.34,35 In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the limiting factor of BiVO4 and pointed out both the benefits and deficiencies caused by n-type doping (W-doping here). It is found that W doping increases the static dielectric constant which lowers the carrier mobility although it enhances the electron density. We find that W–Ti codoping into BiVO4 can lower the static dielectric constant, which enhances the hole mobility and further improves the charge separation efficiency to 79%. Moreover, this codoping has also caused a cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset potential by introducing active surface sites related to the presence of Ti. An impressively high charge separation efficiency (79% at 1.23 VRHE) and a simultaneous cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset potential has been realized by W–Ti codoping in a compact BiVO4 photoanode without any nanostructure formation.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of thin films
Bismuth trioxide, ammonium metavanadate, ammonium tungstate hydrate and titanium(IV) bis (ammonium lactato) dihydroxide solution were dissolved in ethylene glycol with an appropriate amount of nitric acid (100 ml solution containing 5 ml nitric acid) to form 0.03 M Bi, V, W, and Ti precursor solutions, respectively. These solutions were mixed according to the stoichiometric ratio for W doped BiVO4 and W–Ti codoped BiVO4. Citric acid (CA) was also added according to a stoichiometric ratio of CA:M = 1.5:1 (M is the total amount of cation including dopants). After mixing, 70 μl of the precursor solution were dropped on the FTO substrates (1 cm × 2 cm with half of the length covered with transparent tape for electrical contact). The samples were dried at 120 °C for 30 minutes, and subsequently calcined at 500 °C in a furnace for 30 min to obtain the thin films. An annealing temperature of 500 °C was chosen according to the TG-DTA results (Fig. S1†).
Co-Pi decorated W–Ti codoped BiVO4 was synthesized by electrodeposition. An electrochemical cell with a three-electrode configuration was employed for the CoPi electrodeposition. Pt foil was used as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode (in saturated KCl solution) was used as the reference electrode. 0.5 mM Co(NO3)2 was added to 0.1 M KPi solution to serve as the electrolyte, and the pH value was adjusted to 7. For the electrodeposition, a constant current density of 20 μA cm−2 was applied. The amount of CoPi was estimated to be 5 mC cm−2. After electrodeposition, the films were washed with deionized water.
2.2 Characterization
The morphologies were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7600F). Crystallinity was identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Shimadzu 6000 X-ray diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm), using a 2θ scan mode with a fixed incidence angle of 1°. The light absorption was obtained by measuring the reflectance and transmittance using a UV-visible spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere (Lambda 750S, Perkin-Elmer). Differential thermal analysis and thermo-gravimetric analysis were conducted using a Netzsch thermal analyzer (STA 449C). The chemical states of W and Ti were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Omicron EA125). The X-ray source we used is Al K-alpha monochromatic light. The binding energy was calibrated using the C1s peak (284.6 eV). Raman spectra were obtained using a confocal Raman microscope (Witec alpha300 SR) with a laser wavelength of 488 nm. The elemental composition was analyzed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) equipped with a field-emission scanning electron microscope with a transmission electron detector (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7600F).
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a three-electrode configuration (PCI4/300™ potentiostat with PHE200™ software, Gamry Electronic Instruments, Inc.), with a BiVO4 working electrode, Pt foil as a counter electrode and a reference electrode of Ag/AgCl. The light source for photoelectrochemical measurements was a solar simulator (HAL-320, Asahi Spectra Co., Ltd.) with a power intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a solar reference cell. The photocurrents of water oxidation were measured in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1. The photocurrents tested with a hole scavenger to obtain ∼100% charge transfer efficiency were measured in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution mixed with 0.1 M Na2SO3. The Mott–Schottky plots were obtained using an AUTOLAB Potentiostat-Galvanostat (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302 N) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution, and the frequency was set at 1 kHz according to reported studies.6,36–38
Transient absorption measurements were performed using a commercial EOS™ setup in a non-degenerate pump-probe configuration (Ultrafast Systems LLC). In the measurements, the pump and probe beams were incident on the sample with a small incident angle (<10°). The 400 nm pump pulses were generated from the second harmonic of the 800 nm laser beam using a barium borate (BBO) crystal. The 800 nm laser beam was generated from a 1 kHz regenerative amplifier (Coherent Legend™, 150 fs, 1 mJ). A mode-lock Ti-sapphire oscillator (Coherent Vitesse, 80 MHz) was used for the amplifier. The probe pulse was a white light continuum generated from a photonic fiber using a Nd:YAG laser (center wavelength: 1064 nm). A CMOS sensor was used to collect the probe light after passing through the samples and another one was used to collect the probe light before passing through the sample as the reference.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Analysis of the limiting factor of the BiVO4 photoanode for PEC water oxidation
The theoretical photocurrent of a photoelectrode under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) is shown in Fig. 1a, which is based on the assumption that 100% of the photons in the solar spectrum with energies beyond the bandgap is absorbed and converted.3 The theoretical solar to hydrogen efficiency of BiVO4 is 9.1%, corresponding to a photocurrent of about 7.3 mA cm−2.3 However, as shown in Fig. 1b, the photocurrent of pristine BiVO4 is only 0.27 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. To explore the reasons, each critical step in a PEC water splitting process should be analyzed. The water oxidation photocurrent is determined by three factors as expressed by the following equation:39 JH2O = J0 × ηabs × ηsep × ηinj(1)where JH2O is the total water splitting photocurrent, J0 is the theoretical solar photocurrent (7.3 mA cm−2 for BiVO4), ηabs is the light absorption efficiency, ηsep is the charge separation efficiency for photo-generated carriers, and ηinj is the interfacial charge transfer efficiency for water oxidation. When a hole scavenger is added to the electrolyte, the interfacial charge transfer efficiency can be assumed to be 100% (ηinj = 1).39 The photocurrent measured with the hole scavenger JNa2SO3 in the electrolyte can be determined using eqn (2):39 JNa2SO3 = J0 × ηabs × ηsep = Jabs × ηsep(2)where JNa2SO3 is the oxidation photocurrent of Na2SO3 and Jabs is the maximum photocurrent of a given photoanode based on its light absorption efficiency. The light absorption efficiency (ηabs) of pristine BiVO4 with a thickness of around 190 nm is shown in Fig. S2.† According to this light absorption efficiency, the Jabs is calculated to be 3.54 mA cm−2. We also measured the oxidation photocurrent of Na2SO3 (Fig. S3†). From eqn (1) and (2), the obtained charge separation efficiency of the pristine BiVO4 is 22%, while the interfacial charge transfer efficiency is 34% at 1.23 VRHE. It is concluded that the charge separation is the limiting factor for the PEC performance.

Fig. 1b shows front (the electrolyte side) and back (the FTO side) side illumination photocurrents of pristine and W doped BiVO4. Higher front illumination photocurrent indicates better electron transport. Otherwise, higher back illumination photocurrent indicates better hole transport (details in the ESI†). From Fig. 1b it can be seen that the photocurrent under front side illumination is much lower than that of back side illumination, which indicates poor electron transport in pristine BiVO4.10 The poor electron conductivity is the main reason that limits the separation efficiency.
W doping was then employed in this study, and the photocurrent was enhanced significantly (Fig. 1b). The calculated ηsep and ηinj of W doped BiVO4 at 1.23 VRHE are 42% and 52%, respectively. Although W doping greatly enhances both the charge separation (1.9-fold) and interfacial charge transfer (1.6-fold) efficiencies, the absolute photocurrent density is still low. Through W doping, the poor electron conductivity has been improved; however, the hole transport becomes a limiting factor determining the performance, which is reflected from Fig. 1b that back photocurrent is smaller than front photocurrent. In the following, we are going to improve the hole transport by codoping with Ti.
3.2 Effect of W–Ti codoping on the charge separation of BiVO4
W–Ti codoped BiVO4 films were prepared by the drop-casting method reported before.40 The crystallinity and evidence for successful doping was analyzed by XPS, EDX and Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S4–S7 and Table S1, details are given in the ESI†). We find that after Ti codoping into W doped BiVO4, the performance can be greatly enhanced. After optimization (Fig. S8†) of Ti codoping concentrations, a nominal 2%W and 2%Ti codoped BiVO4 shows much better performance than the W doped BiVO4, corresponding to almost 2 times that of W doped BiVO4 (Fig. 2a). For comparison, the photocurrent of Ti doped BiVO4 is similar to that of the pristine sample. This indicates that Ti mono-doping has no effect on the photocurrent improvement. This is understandable since the electronic conductivity is the limiting factor for pristine BiVO4 and Ti doping has no contribution to this. Based on the series comparison, we conclude that to obtain high solar conversion efficiency, the electronic conductivity has to be improved as the foundation, based on which further enhancement can be designed. Fig. 2b shows the photocurrent of CoPi decorated W–Ti codoped BiVO4, in which CoPi is loaded by electro-deposition with a loading amount of around 5 mC cm−2 according to a previous study.41 The photocurrent reaches to 2.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE by suppression of the surface recombination after the decoration of CoPi.

(b) Photocurrent of W–Ti codoped BiVO4 decorated with CoPi under 1 sun simulated AM1.5G illumination. Dark currents are shown in dashed lines. (c) Charge separation efficiencies of W doped BiVO4 and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 as a function of applied potential. (d) Photocurrents of W doped BiVO4 and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 with the same thickness (≈170 nm) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M Na2SO3 illuminated from the front side (electrolyte-BiVO4 side) and back side (FTO-BiVO4 side) with a 400 nm cut-off filter. 
It has been shown that W–Ti codoping does not alter the morphology, film thickness (Fig. S9†), and light absorption efficiency (Fig. S10†). We have also calculated the interfacial charge transfer efficiency ηinj of W doped BiVO4 and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 based on the hole scavenger Na2SO3 oxidation photocurrent (Fig. S11†). They are 52% and 54%, respectively. W–Ti codoping has resulted in a very small enhancement in the interfacial charge transfer. It is concluded that the great enhancement in the photocurrent by codoping with Ti is mainly attributed to the better charge separation process rather than surface charge transfer. The calculated charge separation ηsep values of W doped BiVO4 and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 obtained from eqn (2) are shown in Fig. 2c. At 1.23 VRHE, the ηsep of W codoped BiVO4 is 42%, while that of W–Ti codoped BiVO4 is 79%. Thus, Ti codoping has greatly enhanced the charge separation efficiency.
In order to understand how Ti codoping improves the charge separation efficiency, the photocurrent of W doped BiVO4 and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 with the same thickness (≈170 nm) illuminated from the front side and back side was measured (Fig. 2d). In consideration of the fact that FTO has light absorption in the UV region (Fig. S12†), which affects the light absorption of our photocatalysts by front and back illumination, we use a 400 nm cut-off filter to avoid the possible influence caused by FTO. To reflect the bulk transport properties, hole scavenger Na2SO3 was added. As shown in Fig. 2d, the photocurrent at 1 VRHE of W doped BiVO4 from front illumination is 60% higher than that from back illumination. This indicates a relatively poor hole transport property in W doped BiVO4. However, this disparity is narrowed in the W–Ti codoped sample, in which the front side photocurrent is 21% higher than the back side photocurrent. This implies that Ti codoping in W doped BiVO4 has greatly improved the hole transport. Considering that this method is a rough estimation on the electron and hole transport, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) is further employed to investigate the photophysics and carrier dynamics in the W doped and W–Ti co-doped BiVO4 films.

Fig. 3a and b show the pseudo-color transient absorption profiles of W doped and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 thin films. Fig. 3c shows the transient absorption profiles at a selected delay time of around 1 ns. For the W doped BiVO4 film, a distinct positive peak (ΔA > 0) can be seen at around 473 nm with a tail extending to beyond 700 nm, which is attributed to the photo-induced absorption (PIA) of the charge carriers (holes).42 To evaluate the hole transport ability after the codoping, we setup a transient absorption experiment to measure the hole diffusion lengths in the W doped and W–Ti codoped films. The schematic of the experiment is shown in Fig. 3d which follows the standard procedures in measuring photovoltaic materials.43,44 In the experiment, a strong hole scavenger Na2SO3 solution is used to extract the holes.45 The calculation of the hole population follows the one-dimensional diffusion equation: (3)where N is the hole density and z is the distance along the incident light direction (vertical to the film plane). At the quartz-BiVO4 interface, z = 0 and at the BiVO4–N2 (or scavenger) interface, z = L. D is the hole diffusion coefficient and τ is the hole lifetime without any scavenger. Given a perfect scavenging of the holes at the interface, the boundary condition would be N(z,0) = N0exp(−αLz); N(L,t) = 0(4)where αL is the absorption coefficient of the incident photon and L is the thickness of the film. The analytical solution of eqn (3) with the boundary condition of eqn (4) can be found elsewhere.44 Fitting the hole decay dynamics with and without the hole scavenger will generate the diffusion coefficient and the diffusion length of the holes. The hole absorption peak dynamics of the W doped and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 are shown in Fig. 3e. The decay dynamics cannot be described by a single exponential due to the involvement of multiple trapping and de-trapping of the charge carriers that usually occur in oxides and organic semiconductors.42,46,47 Here we simply use the effective lifetime (τeff) to represent the intrinsic hole lifetime τ0, where τeff is the time that the carrier population drops to the 1/e of the maximum. The effective lifetime for the W doped BiVO4 is around 276 ns and drops to 229 ns for the W–Ti codoped film. With the hole scavenger Na2SO3, the effective lifetime of the W doped BiVO4 drops to ∼43 ns and that of the W–Ti codoped BiVO4 decreases rapidly to ∼16 ns due to the efficient hole extraction. This also indicates that the improved performance is not from a supposedly longer lifetime; in contrast, the lifetime decreases after the codoping. Furthermore, the hole diffusion length is investigated to understand the better performance by codoping. The concept of the diffusion length based on the Einstein relation can be used to evaluate the hole transport ability: (5)where Dp and τp are the hole diffusion coefficient and lifetime, respectively. According to the model in eqn (3), such a decrease of lifetime with a hole scavenger corresponds to a hole diffusion length of around 250 nm and 370 nm for the W doped and W–Ti codoped films, respectively, which are comparable to the values reported by others.25,48 Although these values derived from the equation may not be exactly the actual diffusion lengths due to various estimations made in the calculation, the comparison of the values can reflect the relative hole transport ability. The improvement of the diffusion length indicates that the codoping dramatically increases the hole mobility which facilitates its transport.

In many metal oxides, carrier transport is expressed by a thermally activated small polaron hopping.48,49 If the phonon coupling is strong enough, the carrier transports by means of hopping. The phonon coupling coefficient αpc is an indicator for the carrier transport. Usually, hopping happens at αpc > 6. And the coupling coefficient is related to effect mass in eqn (6): (6)where, m* is the effective mass of the carrier. As reported, the electrons are transported by hopping in the BiVO4 lattice (doped or undoped).48,50 We have calculated the effective masses of pristine, W doped and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 (Fig. S13,† and to calculate the effective mass the electronic structure was calculated prior to the effective mass in Fig. S14†). The effective masses of holes are relatively larger than those of electrons (Table 1). Hence, the coupling effect of holes and phonons is stronger than that of electrons, which suggests that the transport of holes is dominated by hopping. The mobility μ of polaron is expressed as follows: (7)where WH is the polaron hopping activation energy, T is the temperature, and k is the Boltzmann constant. The hopping activation energy WH is given by (8)where q is the hole charge and ε∞ and ε0 are the high frequency and static dielectric constant, respectively. We calculated ε∞, which remains the same for all of the three samples, at about 0.45. However, ε0, is quite different: 4.1 for pristine BiVO4, 146.3 for W doping, and 3.8 for W–Ti codoping. These values are for comparison purposes only within the current study considering the discrepancy between the reported experiment values of ∼68.51 W doping causes an increase in the static dielectric constant, while W–Ti codoping lowers the value. Overall, the WH is lowered by 11.5% after W–Ti codoping compared with mono-W doping, which corresponds to the mobility increase by 29%.

3.3 Effect of W–Ti codoping on surface catalysis
In Fig. 2a, another feature from codoping with Ti is the photocurrent onset potential. Ti codoping causes a cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset by 100 mV (0.68 VRHE for W–Ti codoped BiVO4 and 0.78 VRHE for W doped BiVO4). In order to understand this, experiments and theoretical calculations are conducted for further analyses.
Mott–Schottky plots are shown in Fig. 4a. The flat-band potential VF of pristine BiVO4 is estimated to be −0.32 VRHE, while that of W doped BiVO4 is about −0.20 VRHE. There is a positive shift compared with pristine BiVO4. However, after codoping with Ti, the flat-band potential is about −0.31 VRHE, which is 0.11 V negative than that of W doped BiVO4. This flat-band potential change correlates nicely with that of the photocurrent onset potential (0.1 V in Fig. 2a). The flat-band potential is generally considered to be located just under the conduction band of n-type semiconductors.52 Thus, it is reasonable to deduce that the shift of band potential corresponds to the shift of the conduction band. Another feature caused by the W–Ti codoping is the carrier concentration change. From Mott–Schottky plots the carrier density is 1.2 × 1020 cm−3 for pristine BiVO4, 4.46 × 1020 cm−3 for W-doped BiVO4 and 4.89 × 1020 cm−3 for W–Ti codoped BiVO4. W doping has increased the density greatly, while Ti codoping almost has no further enhancement in the density. One would expect Ti to act as an acceptor as it has a valence state of 4+, and thus compensates the extra electrons provided by W6+. However, we find that this is not true from the experiment, which could possibly be ascribed to the fact that the doping elements are at a low level and far separate from each other. Thus, W-doping and Ti-doping do not interfere with each other. Rather, they are able to improve electron and hole transport simultaneously.

It has been reported that the photocurrent onset is closely related to the charging of the surface states which generally exist on the metal oxide surfaces.53 The open circuit potential also proves the existence of such surface states. In the dark, the equilibrium between the photoelectrode and the electrolyte dictates that the measured open-circuit potential reports on the position of the Fermi level.54 Under ideal conditions, in the complete absence of an overpotential, an equilibrium open-circuit potential of 1.23 V would be expected, because the H2O/O2 redox couple dominates the electrochemical potential of the electrolyte in the dark. It was found that the equilibrium potentials of pristine, W-doped and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 were almost the same at around 0.61 VRHE (Fig. S15†), and was far below 1.23 V. Thus, it is supposed that there exist some surface states on the BiVO4 surface. An equivalent circuit was employed here to analyze the photoelectrochemical processes.55 In the equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 4b), Rs represents the total resistance from the external circuit, Rtrap represents the resistance of the surface states trapping holes, Rss represents the surface charge transfer resistance from the surface states to oxidize water, Cbulk represents the space charge capacitance of the bulk hematite, and Css represents the surface state capacitance, which dominates charging of the surface states and has a close correlation with the photocurrent onset.53 The Css of pristine, W doped, and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 obtained from EIS data is given in Fig. 4b. The values for Css show a Gaussian behavior, and the charging potential follows the order pristine < W–Ti codped < W doped. The charging potentials of Css somehow also correlate with the photocurrent onsets except for the pristine one, which is possibly due to poor conductivity and large resistance. Further discussion will be made next.

Fig. 4c shows the Nyquist plots of pristine, W doped and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 at an applied potential of 1.23 VRHE, which are used to study the surface charge injection at the interface. The same equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 4b) was adapted for the analysis. The resistances of trapping holes by the surface states (Rtrap) of pristine, W doped and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 are 13320 Ω, 657 Ω and 35 Ω, respectively. Compared with doped BiVO4, the pristine one has a much larger hole trapping resistance, which requires a higher voltage to overcome the resistance. This explains why the pristine sample has a poor photocurrent onset, although it has a more negative conduction band and lower charging potential of the surface states as shown in Fig. 4b. The surface charge transfer resistances Rss of pristine, W doped and W–Ti codoped BiVO4 are about 3996 Ω, 2272 Ω and 2218 Ω, respectively. Thus, the doped samples have smaller charge transfer resistances than the pristine and W–Ti codoped BiVO4. This trend agrees with the calculated charge transfer efficiencies. To unravel how W–Ti codoping affects the charge transfer, it is important to explore the surface conditions in the BiVO4. It is known that hydroxyterminated surface states will be formed on metal oxide electrode surfaces in aqueous solutions.53,56–58 Thus, hole accumulation or trapping in these surface states can be treated as an oxidation process of these surface states, and thus these active surface states can be characterized by cyclic voltammetry scans, in which the current peak can be seen due to the reduction of these oxidized surface species.58 To verify our speculation, we carried out cyclic voltammetry scans of BiVO4 in Na2SO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 after holding the electrode at a potential of 1.8 VRHE for 120 seconds under 1 sun illumination. Fig. 4d illustrates the changes in the surface states of BiVO4 caused by mono-W doping and W–Ti codoping compared with the pristine one. For pristine BiVO4, no obvious reduction peak was observed. One obvious reduction current peak around 0.65 VRHE emerged for the W doped sample. For the W–Ti codoped sample, two obvious reduction current peaks at around 1 V and 0.5 VRHE were observed. These reduction current peaks are evidence of the surface states.59 As seen, the W–Ti codoped sample has more active surface states to participate in the water oxidation, which implies that W–Ti codoping favors the surface catalysis.
From Fig. 5a we can see that there are no obvious changes in the surface structure when doping with W or Ti in the V site. However, the PDOS in Fig. 5b shows that mono-doping on the surface will introduce unoccupied electronic states deep within the BiVO4 bandgap, which is reported to be resulting from the donated electrons to form small electron polarons via self-trapping.50 The deep level states are usually surface trap states, because α and β orbitals in the deep level states are asymmetric (Fig. S16†). Such trap states usually serve as recombination centers. However, no such kinds of trap states are found in the case of W–Ti codoping , which indicates that W–Ti codoping facilitates the surface catalysis.

(b) The corresponding partial density of states (PDOS) of pristine, W doped, W–Ti codoped and Ti doped BiVO4 (010) facets. (c) Free-energy profiles of the OER on different BiVO4 surfaces; the black line is for the ideal catalyst. The unit of Gibbs free energy is eV; (d) OER theoretical overpotential (η) volcano where each colored region is labeled by the step limiting OER performance when the scaling relation between ΔGOH and ΔGOOH is ΔGOOH = ΔGOH + 2.8. 
The calculated Gibbs free energies of the five surface sites during the OER process on the BiVO4 (010) surface are shown in Fig. 5c according to the adsorption of several key species (Fig. S17†), which shows different abilities for water splitting. Comparing the Gibbs free energies on different sites, it is found the Ti site is closer to the ideal OER catalysis process than other sites, indicating that the Ti site is energetically more favorable for water splitting. In order to further understand the surface catalytic ability, the overpotentials of different surface sites were also calculated, as shown in Fig. 5d. Compared with pristine BiVO4, no much improvement has been found in the overpotential in the Bi or W site. However, the Ti site possesses a lower overpotential in the W–Ti codoped sample (0.68 V). This well explains the observed photocurrent onset potential shift in W–Ti codoped BiVO4. Although the Ti site on the Ti doped surface also shows a low overpotential (0.44 V), the experimentally observed performance was poor. This is mainly due to the fact that the Ti mono-doped sample has poor electron conductivity and consumes more voltage to overcome the large resistance, which again proves that Ti doping can only become effective after the poor electron transport has been overcome by W doping.
4. Conclusions
Quantitative analysis shows that the low charge separation (22%) is the limiting factor for the poor performance of pristine BiVO4. W doping, which improves the electron conductivity, enhances the charge separation from 22% to 42% (at 1.23 VRHE). However, the photocurrent of W doped BiVO4 is far below the theoretical value. In this study, we find that W–Ti codoping enhances the photocurrent to about 2 times the one of W mono-doping, while Ti mono-doping has nearly no effect on the photocurrent improvement. This enhancement is mainly attributed to the better charge separation efficiency (79% at 1.23 VRHE). Furthermore, the enhanced charge separation is found to arise from the enhanced hole transport. Transient absorption spectroscopy shows that the hole diffusion length of W doped BiVO4 is around 250 nm, and it increases to around 370 nm for the W–Ti codoped BiVO4. This improvement of the hole diffusion length indicates that the W–Ti codoping dramatically increases the hole mobility which facilitates its transport. Theoretical results show that W doping increases the static dielectric constant which lowers the carrier mobility. W–Ti codoping lowers the static dielectric constant, and thus, the hole polaron hopping activation energy WH is lowered by 11.5% after W–Ti codoping. Moreover, W–Ti codoping causes a cathodic shift of photocurrent onset potential by 100 mV compared with W doped BiVO4. The calculated adsorption energy and reaction Gibbs free energies indicate that the Ti site is energetically more favorable for water splitting. Moreover, the Ti site possesses a lower overpotential in the W–Ti codoped sample (0.68 V) compared with the mono-W doped sample (1.68 V). The current study sheds light onto ways to identify the key factor(s) and to improve the charge separation and transfer efficiencies of a compact photoelectrode. It indicates that in a photo electrode system, the minority carrier mobility is also an important consideration. High solar conversion efficiency can only be obtained in a well-balanced electron and hole transport system.
