Finally, the existing challenges and future prospects in this emerging territory are proposed. This comprehensive review is anticipated to offer a powerful reference for the profound research and applications of piezoelectric and pyroelectric materials in the fields of the environment and energy by utilizing ubiquitous mechanical and temperature fluctuation energies.
1. Introduction
The global energy crisis and severe water pollution pose enormous challenges to the future survival and development of human beings and the maintenance of the aquatic ecological environment. Hydrogen production technology holds great promise for producing clean and sustainable energy to alleviate the universal energy shortage, in which solar energy or electrical energy is converted to chemical energy to generate H2 by the water splitting reaction by means of appropriate semiconductor catalysts or electrode materials.1–9 Besides, hydrocarbon fuel conversion strategies, such as CO2 reduction and biomass conversion, are promising as alternatives to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.10–17 On the other hand, the urgent water pollution problem has attracted great attention and various advanced treatment processes are exploited and utilized to facilitate the decontamination of refractory micropollutants, including physical adsorption, advanced oxidation, chemical precipitation, photocatalytic/electrochemical approaches, etc.18–23 In recent years, utilizing periodical mechanical vibration and temperature variation energy to trigger catalytic reactions has shown large potential based on the piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects of piezoelectric or pyroelectric materials.24,25 They are considered as available methods expected to counteract the energy crisis and environmental issues through collecting ubiquitous natural energy sources, such as wave fluctuation, the water droplet pressure and the water flow, diurnal temperature differences, industrial waste-heat, etc.
Piezoelectric or pyroelectric materials can produce an internal electric field to transfer free charge carriers in opposite directions when stimulated by mechanical pressure or temperature variation.26 The tremendous prospects of piezoelectric and pyroelectric catalysts have drawn immense research interest and helped in making progress in the fields of energy conversion and environmental catalysis.27–36 A variety of piezoelectric materials, including ZnO, BaTiO3, ZnSnO3, NaNbO3, LiNbO3, Na0.5K0.5NbO3, PbZrxTi1−xO3, BiFeO3, CH3NH3PbI3, Bi2WO6, BiVO4, BiOIO3, Bi4NbO8X (X = Cl, Br), Bi2O2(OH)(NO3), MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2, CdS, ZnS, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymers show remarkable catalytic performance in the field of H2 production from water splitting, wastewater decontamination and sterilization through the utilization of mechanical stress or temperature fluctuation energy. For instance, the ultra-fast piezoelectric catalytic reactivity of few-layer MoSe2 with a rhodamine B (RhB) decomposition efficiency of 90% within 30 s was reported by Wu et al., which was ascribed to the formation of an excellent piezoelectric potential and remarkable current output (250 pA) on the surface of MoSe2 supported by synthetic characterization results of piezo-response force microscopy (PFM) and tunneling atomic force microscopy (TUNA).37 For H2 evolution, two-dimensional (2D) wrinkled graphene-shaped black phosphorus presented great advantage in harnessing temperature-fluctuating energy through a polarization-modulated pyroelectric catalytic reaction, yielding a remarkable H2 generation efficiency of 540 μmol g−1 after 24 hot–cold alternation cycles (15–65 °C, 10 min per thermal cycle) in an aqueous solution with methanol as an electron donor (20 vol%).38
At present, there are several excellent reviews on the combination of piezoelectric or pyroelectric materials and the piezoelectric or pyroelectric effect and their catalytic applications.39–43 For instance, the latest developments in enhancing the catalytic properties of piezoelectric materials by a piezopotential-induced internal electric field were summarized by Wang et al.44 Li et al. described the research advances in nanostructured ferroelectric, pyroelectric, and piezoelectric materials for various catalytic processes.26 Wang et al. overviewed the characteristics and intrinsic principle of pyroelectric-induced redox processes by utilizing room-temperature alternation energy and approaches for facilitating the pyroelectric catalytic performance of typical pyroelectrics as well as their extensive applications in the fields of biotherapy, the environment and energy.43 Zhang et al. focused on the progress of pyroelectric catalysts for H2 production from water splitting and wastewater purification driven by cold–hot fluctuation stimulation.39 Besides, the critical role of sunlight irradiation in heightening piezoelectric catalysis of piezoelectric materials and its application based on the piezo-phototronic effect have been immensely studied.45–51 However, a systematic overview of pyroelectric or piezoelectric materials in renewable energy production and sewage purification is lacking at present.
In this review, we focus on the current advances in energy and environmental catalytic applications of piezoelectric and pyroelectric materials stimulated by stress and temperature changes. Based on the type of external driving energy, the essential mechanisms on movement behaviors and utilization processes of charge carriers within piezoelectric and pyroelectric catalysts and the corresponding redox reactions are discussed, namely the coupling mechanism of the piezoelectric or pyroelectric effect and electrochemistry. Further, piezoelectric and pyroelectric catalytic applications in environmental restorations and universal energy issues are thoroughly summarized based on the various piezoelectrics and pyroelectrics. Eventually, a summary and the future prospects for piezoelectric and pyroelectric catalysis are presented.
2. Fundamentals of catalysis driven by stress and temperature-variation
2.1. Intrinsic properties of piezoelectrics and pyroelectrics
Piezoelectric materials, as a significant category of non-centrosymmetric (NCS) crystals, manifest extraordinary performance in transducers, sensors, nanogenerators, etc. through imposing external energy stimulation. In this respect, the external compressive stress or tensile force functions as the driving energy source, which triggers the internal electric dipole change of the piezoelectric materials and redistributes the positive and negative charges in the inverse direction.26 As a subclass of piezoelectrics, pyroelectrics are characterized by spontaneous polarization even when there are no external mechanical force.24 Ferroelectrics represent polarized electric dipoles in the absence of external force and temperature fluctuations, and belong to a special subset of the piezoelectric and pyroelectric materials class (Fig. 1). The temperature fluctuation can give rise to the variation of polarization intensity within the pyroelectrics, which require the maximum applied temperature below the Curie temperature (TC).43,52 If the temperature is higher than TC, the pyroelectric or piezoelectric response will disappear owing to the existence of structural transformation from the ferroelectric phase to paraelectric phase of pyroelectric crystals.53,54 The polarization charge (Q) and potential difference (V) induced by pyroelectric materials (surface area: A, thickness: h) subjected to temperature variation (dT) can be quantified using the following two formulas (1) and (2), respectively.30,43 Here, p is the pyroelectric coefficient, ε33 represents the material relative dielectric constant and ε0 stands for the dielectric constant of the free space. Q = p × A × dT(1) V = p × h × ΔT/ε0 × ε33(2)

The above two pairs of positive correlations are obtained, between charge and the surface area and between the pyroelectric potential and thickness, which suggest the profound influence of structural regulation on the pyroelectric reactivity and feasibility of materials for various catalytic reactions such as water splitting, CO2 reduction and degradation processes. The piezoelectrics and pyroelectrics are stimulated by external mechanical stress or cold–hot alternation cycles, to yield the piezopotential and pyropotential, leading to the formation of a polarization electric field to accelerate the spatial separation and migration of charge carriers, which are known as the piezoelectric and pyroelectric effect, respectively. It is of great significance to trigger the electrochemical reactions with the participation of free positive and negative charges and to accelerate the catalytic reaction kinetics. Obviously, various forms of mechanical force (e.g. wind, water flowing, stirring, ultrasonication oscillation and ball-milling) and ubiquitous temperature variation energy (e.g. secondary waste heat in industrial operations, diurnal temperature changes, geothermal energy and artificial heat fluctuation) are infinite to access, which have inspired the increasing investigation of piezo/pyroelectric catalysts in the fields of energy catalysis and environmental catalysis by harnessing stress and temperature-variation energy.
2.2. Mechanism of piezoelectric catalysis and piezoelectric catalysis
Piezoelectric catalysis can be thought of as the incorporation of the piezoelectric effect and electrochemical reaction, while pyroelectric catalysis represents the coupling process of the pyroelectric effect and electrochemical reaction. Driven by an external stress, the deformation of the piezoelectric semiconductors results in a piezoelectric electric field and an elevated valence band position relative to the lowest vacant molecular orbital of the electrolyte and a reduced conduction band (CB) position relative to the highest occupied state of the electrolyte, which allows electron transfer between the piezoelectric material and the electrolyte.55,56 Then the charge carriers induced by the piezoelectric potential are transformed into reactive oxygen species (ROS), which directly facilitate redox reactions in solution, which is known as piezoelectric catalysis. In many piezocatalytic studies, discrete ultrasonic vibration offered by the ultrasonication cleaner always serves as a mechanical stress to activate piezoelectric materials and initiate subsequent chemical reactions involving generation of charge carriers and active species. The crucial effect of ultrasonic vibration on piezoelectric catalytic reactions is the acoustic pressure and strong blasting power exerted by the expansion and rupture of acoustic cavitation bubbles.57–59
Pyroelectric catalysis is similar to the above piezoelectric catalysis (Fig. 2).60,61 Temperature fluctuation can trigger the change in the thermodynamic equilibrium retained between the pyroelectric catalysts and ambient solution. The positive and negative charges induced by the pyroelectric potential can migrate to the opposite sides of the pyroelectrics and then be extracted by the surface adsorbed active species, such as hydroxide ions, protons, and free oxygen molecules. Under the stimulation of the exerted periodic mechanical strain variation or temperature fluctuations, the well-designed piezoelectric or pyroelectric catalysts have been developed for renewable energy conversion and environmental remediation.

3. Energy and environment catalysis driven by stress
At present, a great deal of great effort has been made in energy and environment catalysis driven by stress for alleviating energy shortages and environmental pollution problems by relying on the piezoelectric effect of piezoelectric materials. The following two parts summarize the energy and environmental applications of piezoelectric catalysts based on the modification strategies of microstructure design, element doping, composite construction and poling treatment (Table 1).
3.1. Catalytic production of renewable fuels by stress
A variety of piezoelectric materials are utilized for hydrogen generation and hydrocarbon fuel conversion from CO2 by applying external mechanical stress. For instance, the stress-triggered catalytic overall water splitting reaction was reported by Su et al. Typically, regular BaTiO3 nanocubes with a size of 10 nm were prepared via a unique solvothermal strategy (Fig. 3a), which demonstrated high monodispersibility in aqueous solution and a superb piezoelectric response. Under ultrasonication without the participation of any sacrificial agents, BaTiO3 nanocubes exhibited excellent H2 and O2 evolution rates of 655 and 316 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively (Fig. 3f and g).62 It was demonstrated that the hybridization of three phases (tetragonal polytype, orthorhombic polytype and rhombohedral polytype) in the BaTiO3 nanoparticles resulted in the reduction of the energy barrier and polarization anisotropy for increased piezocatalytic properties, as evidenced by atomic-resolution high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and Landau free energy model analysis (Fig. 3b–e). It is generally accepted that water splitting for the H2 production reaction is unfavorable for narrow bandgap BiFeO3 photocatalysts.63,64 However, BiFeO3 nanosheets with exceptional ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties were demonstrated to be capable of efficiently splitting water when subjected to the stimulation of mechanical vibration energy,65,66 on account of the tilt of the energy band caused by the internal electric field induced by the piezoelectric charges at the two opposite ends (Fig. 3i and j), namely the CB became more negative than the H2/H2O redox potential.67 In order to optimize the ultrasonic frequency to maximize the H2 generation performance, it is found that the optimal ultrasonic frequency is not the largest one, but the resonant frequency of the BiFeO3 nanosheets (45 kHz) (Fig. 3h). Sun et al. reported that the well-designed hybrid piezocatalysts of BiFeO3 and BaTiO3 were prepared via a hydrothermal method, and 0.7BiFeO3/0.3BaTiO3 nanoparticles had the more favorable energy band structure, which compensated for the inferior reactivity of pure BiFeO3. In addition, the formation of a strong built-in electric field promoted the dynamics of charge separation and transportation within the 0.7BiFeO3/0.3BaTiO3 hybrid piezoelectrics excited by mechanical stress, resulting in a considerable H2 evolution efficiency of 2.72 mmol g−1 in the first 3 hours under ultrasonication in a mixed solution system of water and methanol.68 Remarkably, low frequency mechanical vibration created by water flowing under magnetic agitation was shown to efficiently initiate the decomposition of various dye contaminants (RhB, methylene blue (MB), and methyl orange (MO)) through the coupling action of the piezoelectric effect and electrochemical reaction of the hybrid nickel foam anchored with the active 0.7BiFeO3/0.3BaTiO3 catalyst in the absence of light, which may open up the versatility of piezoelectric catalytic applications. Other ABO3 perovskites, such as Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (ref. 69) and tetragonal methylammonium lead halide CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), were also reported to generate H2 under ultrasonic irradiation.70 Besides, the synergy between photoexcitation and mechanical stress is considered to be efficient to dramatically improve piezoelectric catalysis, which is demonstrated by the study on the H2 evolution activity of tetragonal MAPbI3 nanomaterials synthesized by the antisolvent method. The piezoelectric response potential of the MAPbI3 catalyst was uncovered by PFM measurements. An optimal H2 evolution efficiency of 23.30 μmol h−1 was produced over a MAPbI3 powder catalyst in hydroiodic acid (HI) solution under ultrasonication (optimized ultrasonic power: 70 W) and visible light, which was approximately 7 times and 11 times higher than that under individual light (3.42 μmol h−1) and ultrasound conditions (2.21 μmol h−1), respectively. And the excellent recyclability was revealed through three cycle trials in 15 hours. In the catalytic process, the I− ion in the HI solution can effectively capture photogenerated holes and inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes, which plays a positive role in the catalytic hydrogen production of MAPbI3. The greatly enhanced H2 production activity is proposed to have resulted from the as-formed strongly polarized structure of MAPbI3 and the boosted electric field under light stimulation.

Defect creation is an effective approach to improve photocatalytic performance, as the defect sites can serve as charge trapping centers, which effectively prolong the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes by suppressing their serious recombination, thus facilitating the utilization efficiency of photon energy.71–74 However, there is a serious lack of research and discussion in relation to the influence of crystal defects on the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties at present. In particular, Wang et al. investigated the effect of the oxygen vacancy (OV) concentration on the ferroelectric properties of R3C LiNbO3-type ZnSnO3 nanowires and the H2 evolution efficiency via piezoelectric catalysis through varying the annealing process in a reducing atmosphere (Fig. 4g).75 The highest H2 production rate of 3453.1 μmol g−1 h−1 was obtained for the ZnSnO3 sample treated with H2 for 2 h (Fig. 4h). The band structure analysis suggested that the introduction of appropriate OVs is beneficial to the reinforced piezoelectric catalytic effect under the irradiation of incident light (Fig. 4f). Noteworthily, excessive OVs can reduce spontaneous polarization and ferroelectricity by affecting dipole alignment, which can be explained by imprint effects in ferroelectric materials.76,77 In another case, layered perovskite Bi2WO6 was proved to be capable of collecting vibration energy to form polarized positive and negative charges for an efficient catalytic reaction, which delivered an average H2 production rate of 191.3 μmol h−1 g−1 using triethanolamine (TEOA) as the capture agent of positive charges.78 The H2 production performance of Bi2WO6 was strengthened with increasing the ultrasonic frequency, which was considered to be attributed to the enhanced cavitation pulsation and mass transfer process.79,80

In addition to the catalytic utility of typical piezoelectrics and perovskite piezoelectric catalysts, 2D thin-layered materials also show an outstanding piezoelectric response and promising catalytic applications by harvesting mechanical force. For instance, Li et al. reasonably expounded the interrelation between the intrinsic piezoelectricity of three few-layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, MoS2, WS2, and WSe2) and the efficiency of water splitting via piezoelectric catalysis based on experiment and theoretical studies (Fig. 4b).81 The highest hydrogen production rate of 29.1 μmol g−1 h−1 was observed in the piezocatalytic system composed of hierarchical MoS2 nanoflowers through ultrasonic vibration stimulation with the presence of FeSO4 in the dark, and the WSe2 and WS2 nanosheets exhibited inferior catalytic activity (Fig. 4a). Moreover, the strong piezoelectric potential triggered by ultrasonic stimulation was believed to be the dominant driving force in promoting rapid separation and movement of charged charges (Fig. 4c). It is noteworthy that odd-layered TMDs possess a strong piezoresponse, which reaches the largest for the single-layer one, consistent with results in previous work.82,83 Furthermore, Lin et al. well-designed a highly-efficient hierarchical heterostructured piezoelectric catalyst via in situ growing MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of quartz microrods, and the as-prepared quartz microrods/few-layered MoS2 heterostructure manifested a considerable piezocatalytic activity for H2 evolution (∼6456 μmol g−1 h−1) and fast decomposition of RhB dye by applying ultrasonic wave oscillation at the same time.84 In this case, piezoelectric quartz microrods can generate an internal electric field to promote the generation of more polarization charge carriers on the MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. 4d), thus accelerating the proton reduction and pollutant oxidation reactions simultaneously. Recently, the dramatically enhanced H2 evolution performance with a rate of ∼5000 μmol g−1 h−1 was gained utilizing flower-like 1T- and 2H-phase MoSe2 hybridized catalysts through the combination of the unique piezoelectric properties and strong flexoelectric effect of thin layers with the assistance of methanol electron donors in the dark (Fig. 4e).85 It was revealed that large carrier density, fast electron mobility and abundant active sites for accelerating the catalytic reaction were acquired benefiting from the unique construction of the hybrid 1T- and 2H-phase MoSe2 thin-layers and the cooperation of piezopotential and flexoelectric polarization. The piezoelectric potential and flexoelectric potential of 2D TMDs were predicted on a theoretical and experimental basis (Fig. 5). This work opens up more possibilities for improving the efficiency of H2 production by harvesting natural clean mechanical energy without light irradiation.

Besides, Feng et al. reported that typical wurtzite ZnS nanosheets with a large piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 18 pC N−1) and energy harvesting region, abundant catalytic active sites and high flexibility served as a potential piezoelectric catalyst candidate for water splitting to yield H2 under ultrasonic oscillation.86 The atomic-level thickness ZnS nanosheets (∼2 nm) were synthesized by photocatalytic oxidation exfoliation at room temperature using ZnS(en)0.5 as the precursor, which displayed a H2 evolution rate of 1.08 μmol h−1 mg−1 without a sacrificial agent and cocatalyst (Fig. 6a and b). Iodide and terephthalic acid photoluminescence methods were used to verify the generation of other oxidation products H2O2 and ˙OH during the ultrasound-triggered catalytic process of ZnS nanosheets (Fig. 6c and d). Besides, an outstanding water decomposition performance with the H2 evolution efficiency of 1.690 μmol h−1 mg−1 was unveiled by Feng et al. using MoC quantum dot modified N-doped graphene (MoC QDs/NG) as an active catalyst when subjected to ultrasound wave excitation.87 During the ultrasonic-assisted catalysis process, the piezoelectric potential was generated from the deformed ultrathin N-doped graphene vesicles, which drove the rapid H2 production reaction with the coupled effects of conductive MoC quantum dots. A piezoelectric MoC QDs/NG catalyst was demonstrated to possess a large current response and low overpotential compared to unmodified NG according to a I–t test and polarization curve measurements (Fig. 6f and g), which revealed the significant influence of MoC QDs on the facilitated catalytic activity in the constructed unique structure (Fig. 6e and h). In addition to the traditional ferroelectric and perovskite-type piezoelectric materials, the huge potential applications for catalytic energy production of novel 2D layered materials are expected to be exploited with more efforts.

3.2. Catalytic environment remediation by stress
Based on the intrinsic principle of the combined piezoelectric effect and redox reactions, mechanical stress induced catalytic reactions have been used in environmental fields for decontamination treatment of hazardous aquatic or atmospheric pollutants.88–93 The applications in environment remediation are mainly classified into four categories, including the decomposition of organic dyes, mineralization of antibiotics, bacterial inactivation, and conversion of heavy metals, which will be discussed in the following.

3.2.1. Decomposition of organic dyes. 
So far, catalysis by harvesting mechanical energy has received enormous interest from many researchers in the removal of organic dye contamination using varieties of piezoelectric materials, such as ZnO, BaTiO3, few-layered MoS2, etc. As a typical piezoelectric oxide, wurtzite ZnO with a NCS crystal structure and superior structural flexibility has received immense attention for wastewater decontamination via piezoelectric catalysis.94 ZnO nanorods were synthesized via a hydrothermal method and applied for the purification treatment of acid orange 7 (AO7) dye solution by virtue of the piezoelectric effect and electrochemical process.95 Under the stimulation of ultrasonic micro-bubble bursting force, up to 80% of AO7 molecules were degraded by ZnO nanorods within 50 min, which was caused by the chemical reaction between the dye molecules and active species on the surface of ZnO formed by adsorbed molecules (O2 and H2O) and piezoelectric-induced charges. Ning et al. investigated the difference in the piezoelectric catalytic effect of ZnO catalysts with different microstructures prepared by a solid state reaction, and employed the finite element method to analyze the distribution simulation of piezoelectric potentials on bulk-shaped and rod-shaped counterparts.96 In comparison with bulk ZnO, the remarkable piezoelectric potential of ZnO nanorods under a given cavitation pressure elucidated the outstanding piezoelectric degradation efficiency of ZnO nanorods with a reaction kinetic constant of 0.00341 min−1 induced under ultrasound irradiation. Strikingly, ultrathin lamellar geometric ZnO/Al2O3 with an average thickness of 4.5 nm was well-designed by Nie et al. through a hydrothermal process with Zn–Al layered double hydroxide as the precursor followed by calcination treatment (Fig. 7a).97 The ultrathin ZnO/Al2O3 nanosheets exhibited an amazing catalytic activity with a MO maximized decomposition rate of 100% in 15 min under ultrasonication, whereas the sample with the average thickness of 21 nm took 120 min to reach a MO decolorization efficiency of 81.3% under the same conditions. It was revealed by finite element analysis (FEA) (Fig. 7b and c) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 7d–g) that the ultrathin 2D structure of ZnO/Al2O3 possessed plentiful OV sites, which led to the remarkable piezoelectric potential and fast electron migration rate. The analysis of reactive species validated that the conversion pathway of the superoxide radical (˙O2−) with the participation of electrons provided hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) for organic dye decomposition. Besides, doping engineering was demonstrated to be effective to increase the piezoelectric catalytic effect. Markedly, Laurenti et al. found that the Sb doping with a certain concentration has discrepant influence on the piezoelectric and photocatalytic performance of ZnO samples due to the different intrinsic mechanisms.98 With ultrasonic vibration in the dark, the optimal RhB decomposition ratio of 0.045 min−1 was delivered by the 1% Sb/ZnO piezocatalyst with excellent permanent ferroelectric polarization (Fig. 7i), while the 5% Sb/ZnO sample revealed the best photocatalytic decoloration activity under the same conditions (Fig. 7h). It is of great significance for the critical identification of the piezoelectric catalytic effect, which should not be confused with the photocatalytic process.

Ferroelectric-phase BaTiO3 with a strong piezoelectric response has become one of the most popular piezoelectric materials for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy for environmental remediation.99–102 The significant influence of the microstructure of the ferroelectric BaTiO3 material on the piezocatalytic properties was explored by Jin et al. by modulating the content of the precursor, the temperature and times of post-calcination treatment in the preparation process of BaTiO3 nanowires.103 The polycrystalline BaTiO3 nanowires with a smaller diameter were more beneficial to triggering deformation and displacement under ultrasonic stress stimulation and generating enough piezoelectric potential as demonstrated by FEA. The large specific surface area ensured sufficient reaction space between catalysts and organic pollutants. Accordingly, optimized BaTiO3 nanowires displayed a MO degradation rate of 38.2 min−1 mol−1 under a special ultrasound system. The correlation between the morphology of BaTiO3 and piezoelectric catalytic degradation activity of RhB was further uncovered by Liu et al. based on the cubic, granular and fibrous BaTiO3 materials prepared by three different synthetic procedures.104 A high decomposition activity with a degradation rate of 99% within 75 min and high stability were achieved in polycrystalline BaTiO3 nanowires by applying mechanical stress provided by ultrasonication, owing to their better flexibility, larger specific surface area and admirable piezoelectric response compared to the cubic and granular BaTiO3 piezocatalysts. The catalytic properties of BaTiO3 nanowires can be greatly elevated when the ultrasonic power was increased and the interference of the reaction independent ions (Na+, Cl−) was reduced. Based on the theoretical investigation of piezoelectric potential distribution toward a variety of geometric BaTiO3 models (Fig. 8a–f), the large piezoelectric potential along the polar axis was primarily responsible for the superior catalytic activity of BaTiO3 nanowires.59 Importantly, Wu et al. also found that increased free carriers had a positive effect on the piezocatalytic degradation of MO based on the defective BaTiO3 nanoparticles constructed by post-calcination treatment in different atmospheres (air, N2, and O2; 800 °C, 6 h). Wang et al. further elucidated the influence mechanism of OV on the piezoelectric catalysis of BaTiO3 nanobelts, and found that high-concentration OV was detrimental to the piezoelectric degradation process according to its volcanic tendency (Fig. 8g and i).105 The brilliant piezoelectric catalytic performance was attributed to the reinforced adsorption and activation of O2 in BaTiO3 nanobelts with OV, which were confirmed by the strong desorption signal and large adsorption energy for O2 according to the O2-temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) characteristics (Fig. 8h) and the theoretical calculations. However, the weak piezoelectric response of the sample with OV should not be disregarded, and it is very much worthy of in-depth study on the intrinsic mechanism of defect construction in the piezoelectric catalysis process for environmental applications. Besides, the BaTiO3 nanofibers compounded with (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3 were fabricated by the electrospinning and calcination process, which were employed for degradation of four dyes (AO7, MO, MB, and RhB) by harvesting mechanical force.106 The decomposition selectivity of the 0.93(Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3–0.07BaTiO3 (BNBT) catalytic system for target dyes was closely related to the electrical properties of the dyes in aqueous solution, and the positive surface of the BNBT catalyst was more conducive to the adsorption and further degradation of anionic dyes (AO7 and MO) compared with cationic dyes (MB and RhB) based on the electrostatic interaction and reaction with ROS (Fig. 8j). The maximum piezoelectric catalytic activity of the polycrystalline BNBT sample calcined at 650 °C for AO7 degradation was measured with a reaction constant of 0.0518 min−1 at the lowest ionic strength (without NaCl addition) and the optimized initial dye concentration (5 mg L−1) (Fig. 8k and l). In order to overcome the disadvantages of nanostructured catalysts with a piezoelectric response, including secondary contamination and weak recycling ability, the BaTiO3 obtained through the electrospinning method was used to prepare BaTiO3/PDMS porous structure foam for decomposing RhB dye molecules.107 When subjected to ultrasonic vibration, an optimal degradation efficiency of 94% was observed for 25.0 wt% BiTiO3/PDMS. The construction strategy had also been extended to preparation of efficient BiFeO3/PDMS and ZnO/PDMS composite catalysts for environmental applications.

As another typical perovskite ferroelectric, PbTiO3 nanomaterials were also manufactured by adding diverse surfactants (watermelon, lemon and orange) by a hydrothermal process and used for the piezoelectric decomposition of several dyes, including acid red 143, acid violet and acid black.108 The experimental parameters, such as the power of the ultrasound cleaner, the processing time, the ultrasonic pulse, etc., were demonstrated to affect the removal activity of acid red 143 dye on the optimal PbTiO3 sample modified with watermelon (PbTiO3-watermelon). After optimization, the degradation rates of acid red 143, acid violet and acid black reached 64.8%, 9.75% and 96.05%, respectively (ultrasonic pulse 3 s/1 s (on/off)). Attracted by the large piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 1500 pC N−1) of Sm doped Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–PbTiO3 ceramic,109 it was developed to be a piezoelectric catalyst for dye wastewater treatment under external mechanical force conditions.110 Significantly, the piezoelectric coefficient of Sm doped Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3/xPbTiO3 solid solutions can be regulated by altering the proportion of PbTiO3, and the close correlation between the great piezoelectric coefficient and rapid redox reaction kinetics or immense piezocatalytic degradation activity was unveiled (Fig. 9a and b). After polarization treatment (1.5 kV mm−1), the optimal 2.5%Sm doped Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3/0.29PbTiO3 catalyst delivered a greatly enhanced degradation activity for MO solution (Fig. 9c–e). Similarly, the Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 fibers prepared by a hydrothermal process were reported to be employed for the degradation of AO7 under mechanical vibration excitation in 2014,111 and the catalytic activity was further boosted via La element doping112 and compounding with BiFeO3.113 Extraordinarily, Feng et al. revealed that the degradation properties of spherical Pb(ZrxTi1−x)O3/BiFeO3 nanomaterials were facilitated by increasing the compressive stress intensity provided by the accelerated flow vortex velocity (Fig. 9f). This process can be considered to be a redox reaction involving free carriers triggered by the internal electric field and the piezoelectric material under applied mechanical stress, in which the polarized charges were not directly participated. It was of great significance that there is no straightforward correlation between the catalytic behavior and the morphology of piezoelectric materials.113 This work may be a critical reference for an in-depth understanding of substantial performance improvement and the underlying mechanisms of catalytic wastewater purification driven by water flow.

Inspired by the piezoelectric catalysis research studies of NaNbO3 and LiNbO3 in the field of sewage oxidation treatment,114,115 K0.5Na0.5NbO3 was further exploited to be an efficient piezoelectric catalyst.116,117 It was reported by Zhang et al. that the phase boundary existed between orthorhombic-phase and tetragonal-phase K0.5Na0.5NbO3 after the dopant Li element played a crucial role in the piezoelectric degradation of RhB molecules.117 When the doping content of Li reached 6 mol%, the modified K0.5Na0.5NbO3 showed a 3.2-fold enhancement in the piezoelectric degradation rate (25.16 × 10−3 min−1) compared to that of pure K0.5Na0.5NbO3. According to Landau–Ginsburg–Devonshire phenomenological theory and transient piezocurrent analysis, the flatness of the free energy profile and the increased separation and migration dynamics of the piezoelectric-induced electron–hole pairs at the phase boundary were responsible for the elevated catalytic performance of K0.5Na0.5NbO3. Besides, polycrystalline ZnSnO3 colloid nanoparticles had been developed for use as a potential candidate for removal of organic dyes through an ultrasound-assisted catalytic reaction.118 Under ultrasound stimulation, the curved energy band is favorable for the reaction of adsorbed species (water and oxygen) and electric charges to generate more crucial ROS (e.g. ˙OH). Thus, the ZnSnO3 colloid displayed an admirable decomposition efficiency of RhB molecules through the ultrasonic oscillation stimulus. Subsequently, the catalytic decomposition of dye wastewater by the ZnSnO3-based composite system by harnessing ultrasound oscillation energy was explored.119,120 In this respect, the ZnSnO3/Co3O4/PVDF composite was fabricated for high-efficiency piezocatalytic decomposition of the target mixture of RhB and MB (RhB:MB = 1:1) (Fig. 10d).120 The optimized catalytic degradation efficiency of the ZnSnO3/Co3O4/PVDF hybrid reached 100% within 20 min via modulating the component, where the two dyes were thoroughly changed to colorless secondary molecules (Fig. 10e). The moderate co-addition of ZnSnO3 and Co3O4 not only boosted the migration dynamics of charge carriers, but also increased the piezoelectric response of the PVDF matrix, which contributed to the dramatically reinforced piezoelectric degradation efficiency. The close contact of ZnSnO3 and Co3O4 with PVDF ensured satisfactory stability and reusability, which were disclosed by cycle measurements and structural characterization of the samples after ultrasonic treatment.

Remarkably, the determination of piezoelectric catalytic degradation activity may be disturbed by the electrostatic interaction between catalysts and pollutant molecules. For example, a significant degradation behavior of MO under ultrasonic vibration radiation was found over hydrothermally synthesized Bi2WO6 nanosheets by Kang et al., which resulted from the strong adsorption ability between positively charged Bi2WO6 and anionic MO dyes rather than the piezoelectric process. It was unveiled through the experiment of changing the pH value of the solution system for degradation.121 To avoid strong interference, Bi2WO6 samples prepared via an acid-assisted hydrothermal process were developed to decompose cationic RhB under ultrasonic wave vibrations, which gave a decomposition rate of 0.039 min−1. Besides, the piezocatalytic effect of Bi2WO6 flowers composed of nanosheets synthesized via a precipitation strategy has also been explored to optimize the degradation behavior of RhB.122 In another case, Bi2WO6 nanosheets prepared through a solid-phase chemosynthesis route showed an outstanding removal performance of MB dye with a decomposition efficiency of approximately 96% under ultrasound irradiation for 35 min (Fig. 10a and b), and the corresponding total organic carbon (TOC) analysis revealed a mineralization rate of 65% (Fig. 10c).123 Obviously, the Bi2WO6 catalyst displays a superior piezoelectric response and large practical potential for wastewater purification by harvesting mechanical energy. In addition, our group reported the effective ultrasonic-assisted removal of MO dye molecules using the Sillen–Aurivillius structured Bi4NbO8Br catalyst.124 It was found that 50% of MO was degraded over Bi4NbO8Br nanosheets by harnessing ultrasonic oscillation energy for 2 h. Notably, a large amount of ROS (˙O2−, ˙OH and H2O2) was evolved from Bi4NbO8Br and Bi4NbO8Cl under light, ultrasound and simultaneous light and ultrasound, respectively, unveiling their extensive catalytic applications in environmental and biological fields.

In 2015, the markedly piezoelectric catalysis of odd-layered MoS2 nanosheets was discovered by Wu et al., in which 93% of the RhB dye was decomposed after the ultrasound treatment for 60 s, much higher than that of the commercial MoS2 and P25 nanoparticles.125 Due to the large piezoelectric polarization of the MoS2 catalyst containing abundant odd layers,126 the construction of piezoelectric composites composed of MoS2 and other piezoelectric materials or semiconductors has been exploited as an effective strategy for improving the piezoelectric catalytic activity. In this respect, Lin et al. demonstrated the catalytic behavior of MoS2/PDMS hybridization involving the degradation reactivity of RhB dye, recyclability and its promising potential in the energy conversion of flowing sewage to electrical energy in the absence of light (Fig. 11a).127 However, a reduced degradation efficiency of only 67% was maintained for the MoS2/PDMS composite catalyst in the fourth cycle experiment, which can be caused by the shedding of the active MoS2 nanoflowers under imposing ultrasonic vibration, suggesting that its stability requires further enhancement (Fig. 11b). Interestingly, based on the conversion of triboelectricity and electricity, a large electrical output (23 V and 13 mA m−2) was realized by attaching the self-powered MoS2/PDMS film to the outlet pipe, which lit up to 9 LED lights in a simulated drainage system with a water flow rate of 20 mL s−1 (Fig. 11c). The as-prepared MoS2/PDMS material functioning as a self-powered nanogenerator can output electrical signals to detect and determine the flow situation of sewage in the pipeline at a non-zero flow rate, which provided more insights and utilizations for piezoelectric materials in environmental remediation applications. Besides, the high-efficiency piezoelectric catalysis for the degradation of three poisonous dyes (acridine orange, eosin Y, and ethidium bromide) was obtained by adopting the hybridization film of MoS2 nanoflowers and the β phase PVDF polymer as an active piezocatalyst.128 Notably, the PVDF/MoS2 hybrid film has strong piezoelectric polarization behavior owing to the self-poled characteristic of β-phase PVDF and piezoelectricity of MoS2 nanoflowers offered by external stress. Furthermore, the promoted piezoelectric potential rendered the rapid production of ROS and the kinetics of contaminant decomposition, resulting in an admirable degradation rate of more than 90% after 20 min of ultrasonic treatment. Intriguingly, the PVDF/MoS2 piezoelectric composite can be developed into nanogenerators based on its high output voltage (84 V) and charge density (47.14 mW cm−3) by collecting energy through finger tapping stress. In another case, combining with S, N-codoped graphene, the well-designed MoS2 heterostructure synthesized via an in situ hydrothermal process was unearthed to be a highly active catalyst for the decomposition of refractory contaminants stimulated by ultrasonication (Fig. 11d).129 In the preparation process of MoS2, the introduction of the as-prepared S, N-codoped graphene imposed restrictions on the aggregation of MoS2 nanosheets, resulting in more active Mo4+ exposed sites and boosted mobility of the charge carriers for the high-efficiency catalytic reaction. Moreover, a strengthened piezoelectric field with the surface potential of 29.3 mV on the sandwiched structure of the MoS2/S, N-codoped graphene catalyst was measured relative to that of the bare MoS2 (4.7 mV), greatly promoting the degradation performance against diverse target pollutants including bisphenol A (BPA), nitrobenzene (NB) and MB dye (Fig. 11e–m). As a result, the optimized S, N-codoped graphene composite with an optimal MoS2 amount of 12.52 wt% presented an outstanding piezoelectric catalytic activity, in which 100% MB was completely degraded after ultrasonic treatment for 2 min. MoS2/S, N-codoped graphene also demonstrated excellent catalytic activity for BPA oxidation and NB oxidation, with reaction dynamics constants of 0.037 min−1 and 0.136 min−1, respectively, much higher than that of an unmodified MoS2 catalyst (0.011 min−1 for BPA oxidation and 0.044 min−1 for NB reduction) (Fig. 11l). Benefiting from the reduced interfacial barrier level over MoS2 based heterostructures induced by ultrasonication stimulation, the MoS2/α-Fe2O3 piezoelectric catalyst was developed by adopting a hydrothermal strategy and utilized inefficient Fenton catalysis for AO7 decomposition under dark conditions.130 Besides, other effective modification strategies for the promoted piezoelectric catalytic efficiency of MoS2 are constantly exploited to propel the generation and transportation of piezo-induced electron and holes carriers to facilitate micropollutant decontamination by applying external mechanical stress, including metal element doping (e.g. Co doping131) and vacancy engineering,132 which drew great research interest in utilization of odd-layered MoS2 based piezoelectric materials in environmental purification applications.

3.2.2. Mineralization of antibiotics. 
With the development of piezoelectric catalysis in the field of environmental remediation, the degradation of some stubborn aquatic micropollutants (e.g. various antibiotics, pesticides, and heavy metals) or hazardous gases (formaldehyde) that are difficult to remove is attempted.133,134 Our group reported that diverse organic pollutants, including MO, BPA and tetracycline hydrochloride can be effectively degraded by ferroelectric Bi4Ti3O12 crystals under ultrasonic irradiation (Fig. 12a).135 In the presence of ultrasound wave oscillation and the Bi4Ti3O12 catalyst, large amounts of ˙O2− and ˙OH as powerful ROS were produced for the decomposition of the above contaminants. The piezocatalytic decomposition of BPA, tetracycline hydrochloride and MO was also observed using NCS Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) nanosheets under ultrasound stimulation, which are prepared via a sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS)-assisted hydrothermal route, achieving removal rates of 56.4% for tetracycline hydrochloride, 45% for MO and 30.3% for BPA after a 5 h catalytic reaction.136

Besides, an important means of efficiently degrading refractory micropollutants is the combination of persulfate activation and piezoelectric catalysis. In an ultrasound-assisted persulfate (PS) activation system, a 1.6-fold improvement in the decomposition performance for ibuprofen (IBP) was obtained on a BiTiO3 nanowire piezocatalyst with the rate constant of 0.0818 min−1 compared to the catalytic system without the addition of persulfate (rate constant of 0.0324 min−1) (Fig. 12b).137 Inspired by SO4− and ˙OH active species (Fig. 12c), it was elucidated that the IBP molecules evolved along three steps namely hydroxylation, decarboxylation/demethylation and the ring-opening process based on intermediate product analysis. This work showed great promise for incorporating multiple strategies to restoring refractory pharmaceutical and industrial effluents.
The degradation of ciprofloxacin over well-designed defective MoS2 nanosheets driven by periodic mechanical vibration stimulation was performed by Ma et al. (Fig. 12d–i).138 The majority of antibiotic targets (99%) was degraded within 30 s over defective MoS2 nanosheets, affording a higher decomposition efficiency (rate constant of 1.29 L mg−1 s−1) than pure MoS2 and their commercial counterparts (Fig. 12g and k). After 5 min of catalytic reaction, the mineralization rate of ciprofloxacin reached 56% based on TOC measurements. The piezoelectric potential accelerated the separation of charges, and the porous structure enabled exceptional adsorption ability to polar molecules. These advantages co-contributed to the outstanding piezoelectric decomposition properties of the defective MoS2 piezocatalyst. In another work, the enhanced piezocatalytic decomposition of tricyclazole was achieved by BaTiO3 incorporated with cocatalysts of Pt and RuO2.139 Intriguingly, the synergy of Pt and RuO2 exerted a significant effect on the outstanding catalytic efficiency of tricyclazole. This work may open a new avenue and provide understanding for the development of piezoelectric catalytic systems with multi-cocatalysts for wastewater treatment applications.


3.2.3. Bacterial inactivation. 
At present, great efforts have been made for advanced disinfection of water taking advantage of ample solar photonic energy or ubiquitous mechanical energy and intrinsic properties of semiconductor materials.140–144 During the piezocatalytic process for water disinfection, ROS can effectively facilitate the inactivation of bacteria by destruction of crucial biomacromolecules.145 Feng et al. reported outstanding piezoelectric catalytic properties of hydrothermally synthesized tetragonal BaTiO3 nanoparticles.146 It is worth noting that the collective effect of the physical destruction induced by ultrasonic stress and the electrochemical reaction facilitated by the piezoelectric potential was critical to the Escherichia coli (E. coli) cell inactivation process. As a result, an excellent catalytic performance for killing E. coli with a deactivation number of 2.72-log for 180 min was attained for tetragonal BaTiO3, which was much higher than that of the individual of BaTiO3 catalyst or ultrasound wave oscillation. Recently, the cell membrane destruction and impaired metabolic function of E. coli were measured via the catalysis of BaTiO3 anchored by Ag nanoparticle activated persulfate (PS) systems under ultrasonic vibration irradiation (Fig. 13h), by adopting fluorescence microscopy and the ATP concentration tracking technique.147 The Ag/BaTiO3 hybridization yielded a striking antibacterial activity (6.2log10 cfu mL−1) for E. coli inactivation after a short reaction time (5 min), and the reasonable disinfection mechanisms were presented based on well-revealed evidence from active species detection (Fig. 13g). It offered insight into practical applications of piezoelectric materials by harvesting mechanical energy for water purification. Besides, catalytic bacterial disinfection driven by stress was also reported for BaZr0.02Ti0.98O3 ceramics143 and polymer films,144 which offers more theoretical support for the practical use of industrial water disinfection.

In 2018, WS2 nanoflowers composed of rich monolayer nanosheets had been proved to have remarkable piezopotential according to the TUNA and PFM results, and served as an active piezocatalyst for inactivation of E. coli in water media subjected to mechanical stress.148 Up to 99.99% of E. coli bacteria were reduced after being treated with ultrasonic wave for 60 min, which manifested the superb piezoelectric antibacterial activity of the ultrathin WS2 nanostructure (Fig. 13a). Additionally, the composite film of few-layered MoS2 coated on carbon fibers (CFs) cloth was constructed, which was revealed to be an efficient and recyclable catalyst to disinfect wastewater by harvesting periodic mechanical vibration energy149 (Fig. 13b). The elevated inactivation performance of E. coli (99.999% within 45 min) was obtained on well-designed Au nanoparticles anchored with the MoS2/CFs composite driven by ultrasonic cavitation in comparison with unmodified MoS2/CFs hybridization (Fig. 13c), which was ascribed to the prolonged lifetime of piezoelectric-induced free carriers and the rapid generation kinetics of ˙O2 and ˙OH under the internal electric field triggered by piezoelectric polarization (Fig. 13d–f).


3.2.4. Removal of heavy metal ions. 
Advanced technologies for cost-effective removal of heavy metal sewage have been continuously developed, such as physical adsorption, membrane filtration, photocatalysis and piezoelectric catalysis.150–153 Wei et al. fabricated a BiVO4/Au catalyst by a urea-assisted deposition–precipitation strategy, which can piezoelectrically remove the organic dye 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) and the heavy metal Cr(VI) at the same time.154 Under ultrasonic wave oscillation for 2 h, hybridized BiVO4 particles with the optimal loading amount of Au (1 wt%) delivered high-efficiency Cr(VI) reduction and 4-CP oxidation performance with removal rates of 91% and 83%, respectively, which are attributed to the polarization electric field offered by BiVO4/1 wt% Au with an excellent piezoelectric response. It was observed that oxygen was essential for the removal of 4-CP and the reduction from Cr(VI) to Cr(III) through controlled experiments, while free radical capture experiments verified that H2O2 formed by the two-electron reduction route and ˙OH were the two dominant active species in the piezoelectric catalytic system (Fig. 14a and b). This work provides a potential direction for the development of new multifunctional catalysts to purify complicated industrial wastewater. In addition, the integration of MoS2 nanosheets and TiO2 nanowires was proved to be a favorable strategy to construct efficient piezoelectric catalysts for purification of aqueous solutions containing detrimental Cr(VI) ions.155 A possible piezoelectric catalytic mechanism of the MoS2/TiO2 heterojunction involving the migration path of charge carriers and band level bending was disclosed (Fig. 14c–f). The optimized MoS2/TiO2 heterostructure possess a tremendous carrier density (3.803 × 1015 cm−3) and superb conductivity compared to pure TiO2 (1.714 × 108 cm−3) and MoS2 (7.662 × 1010 cm−3). By virtue of Hall effect measurements, a significant removal efficiency of Cr(VI) (99%) after a 10 min catalytic reaction under drastic water flow agitation stress (600 r min−1) was found. The admirable electronic properties and plentiful active sites of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets may open more possibilities for designing efficient piezoelectric materials for heavy metal removal.

In short, harvesting mechanical energy to produce ROS presents great promise in varieties of catalytic reactions for solving the practical environmental problems based on efficient piezoelectric materials. Besides, catalytic formaldehyde degradation stimulated by ultrasound oscillating force had been explored using α-MnO2 with different microstructures as a piezocatalyst.156 The α-MnO2 nanowires with rich OVs revealed boosted activation of O2 molecules for accelerating the formation of ˙O2−, which was responsible for the 100% degradation efficiency against 125 ppm formaldehyde. More green sustainable practical developments are expected for the efficient remediation of the ecological environment and the improvement of human well-being through harnessing ubiquitous mechanical energy and piezoelectric effects of piezocatalysts.

4. Energy and environmental catalysis driven by temperature variation
In recent years, catalytic reactions induced by temperature fluctuation has become a promising alternative for the production of clean energy (H2 or carbonaceous fuels) and value-added chemicals (e.g. methanol, ethanol, etc.) and the removal of contaminants by applying the ubiquitous residual temperature energy and diurnal cold–hot alternation energy (Table 2), which benefits from the advantages of wide selection of pyroelectric materials (BaTiO3, Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3, PbTiO3, Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3, NaNbO3, (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3, BiFeO3, Bi2WO6, CdS, ZnS/Cu, and 2D black phosphorene), the high sensitivity of pyroelectric catalysts to thermal fluctuations and unlimited access to external light or power sources. The current developments of the pyroelectric catalytic effect concerning clean energy production and environmental purification applications under temperature fluctuation conditions were summarized in detail in the following.
4.1. Catalytic production of renewable fuels by temperature variation
In the past five years, the utilization of temperature-variation energy for catalysis has led to intense efforts based on experimental demonstration and theoretical analysis,157,158 which has been exploited for clean energy generation, mainly including H2 production from water splitting and the conversion of atmospheric CO2 molecules to hydrocarbon fuels, by capitalizing on the pyroelectric effect of pyroelectric materials and industrial waste-heat or natural temperature change energy.60,159 Extraordinarily, pyroelectric catalysis was revealed by Kakekhani et al. as a theoretically feasible and potentially viable option for water decomposition.158 Subsequently, pyroelectric materials have been gradually applied for pyroelectric catalytic water splitting to produce H2. Xu et al. prepared pyroelectric Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 cubic-shaped nanoparticles with an average size of 200 nm by a hydrothermal assisted sol–gel synthesis method, and exploited their pyroelectric catalytic H2 production activity. Pyroelectric Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 demonstrated a considerable H2 evolution rate of 1.30 μmol g−1 through each cold–hot alternant stimulation between 25 °C and 50 °C (10 min) with the presence of methanol consuming the pyroelectric-induced positive charges.159 Layered bismuth-based perovskite Bi2WO6 also shows great promise in the field of harvesting ambient energy variation owing to its superior ferroelectric and pyroelectric characteristics, especially high spontaneously polarization (P = 50 μC cm−2) and high TC (950 °C).160 Experimentally, the selective pyroelectric conversion of CO2 with a methanol generation efficiency of 55.0 μmol g−1 was accomplished by Xiao et al. using hydrothermally-synthesized Bi2WO6 nanosheets as the catalyst in the temperature range of 15–70 °C in a solution system containing 0.3 M Na2SO3, and the mechanism of pyroelectric catalytic CO2 reduction to methanol was proposed to unveil the specific reaction routes of polarized charge on the surface of Bi2WO6 and adsorbed species.60 Notably, the dilated temperature fluctuation range has a positive effect on improving the pyroelectric catalytic performance for CO2 reduction. In brief, the optimized pyroelectric catalytic efficiency that can be achieved at present is still far inferior to the practical application requirements, which is likely to be due to weak energy sources and lack of highly-active pyroelectric catalysts.
It should be noted that piezoelectric or pyroelectric responses do not appear in bulk black phosphorus with a centrosymmetric crystal structure,161 while a 2D black phosphorus layer possesses a NCS structure with the point group of m, which was selected by You et al. to explore its pyroelectric properties.38 The hysteresis loop in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) characterization confirmed the outstanding piezoelectric response of few-layer black phosphorus nanosheets (Fig. 15a). Additionally, benefitting from its appropriate CB position (Fig. 15c), the optimal pyroelectric H2 generation rate of 540 μmol g−1 was achieved via the reduction process between the polarized negative charge and proton after 24 hot–cold alternation cycles in the temperature range of 15–65 °C using methanol as the sacrificial reagent (Fig. 15b). In another case, the integration of CdS nanorods as a classic wurtzite-type pyroelectric with the organic molecule 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (CdS-2MBI) was reported to result in a highly-efficient H2 evolution catalyst driven by room-temperature energy changes (Fig. 15d).162 The nanostructured CdS-2MBI catalyst gained a 5-fold strengthened pyroelectric catalytic activity of H2 production rate of 4.3 μmol g−1 at average per thermal cycle compared to bare CdS (0.8 μmol g−1) in a 10 vol% lactic acid liquid system (Fig. 15g), which may be ascribed to 2MBI molecules bonded to the surface S atoms of CdS by thiol being beneficial to trapping positive charge due to the well-matched energy band between 2MBI molecules and CdS, further boosting the pyroelectric charge separation and transport (Fig. 15e and f).

4.2. Catalytic environment remediation by temperature variation
As a suitable perovskite crystal with a favorable pyroelectric coefficient of 90 μC m−2 K−1,163 rhombohedral BiFeO3 nanoparticles were developed by Wu et al. as a desirable pyroelectric catalyst to harvest the ubiquitous temperature variation energy for environment dye wastewater treatment (Fig. 16b and k) in 2016.164 The pyroelectric-catalytic behavior of NaNbO3 materials with different morphologies was elaborately studied, in which the rod-shaped catalyst presented obvious advantages in degrading RhB dye driven by cold–hot alternating energy compared with plate-shaped and particle counterparts (Fig. 16c–i).165 After 24 thermal fluctuation cycles between 23 and 50 °C (20 min each cycle), a remarkable degradation efficiency of 96% was yielded, which was attributed to the plentiful active sites offered by the large specific surface area of NaNbO3 nanorods and boosted adsorption and activation of dye molecules. The active species capture experiments demonstrated that ˙OH played a prominent role in the removing process of RhB. Intriguingly, both the mechanical vibration and temperature fluctuation energies have also been utilized by You et al. to achieve the high-efficiency decomposition of organic dye adopting NaNbO3 nanofibers as an active catalyst via the synergistic effect of pyroelectric and piezoelectric catalysis (Fig. 16a).166 Through the well-designed catalytic reaction for 80 min, NaNbO3 attained a high degradation efficiency of 86.5% under the integrated system of mechanical stress (ultrasonic frequency of 40 kHz) and cold–hot alternation (15–50 °C), highlighting its superiority relative to individual pyroelectric catalysis (63.3%) and piezoelectric catalysis (75.85%) (Fig. 16g). The results of free radical trapping experiments disclosed the key active species in this synergistic catalytic process (Fig. 16f). In another effort, the reinforced catalytic activity of pyroelectric (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 nanoparticles with the coexisting orthorhombic phase and tetragonal phase was unveiled after specific electrical poling treatment.167 To maximize the pyroelectric catalytic efficiency, the influences of various experimental parameters on the degradation activity of dyes were investigated in detail, including the poling electric field intensity, pollutant concentration, pH, and catalyst dosage (Fig. 17a). As a result, the polarized (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 crystal harvested a satisfactory decomposition ratio of 91.2% for RhB and benign stability under the polarized electric field of 4.5 kV mm−1 after the 100 cold–heat alternation stimulation process (30–60 °C), far exceeding the unpolarized counterpart (Fig. 17b).

Environmental remediation by utilization of widespread temperature variation energy was also intensively implemented using typical ferroelectric BaTiO3 materials to cope with the contamination issues of various wastewaters. In this respect, Wu et al. performed the pyroelectric degradation experiments of BaTiO3 nanowires against diverse dyes, including RhB, MB and MO, revealing the dependence of the decomposition performance on the charged features between dye molecules and the surface of the catalyst, which may explain the eminent decomposition activity against RhB (more than 95% with 80 thermal cycles) and the low activity for MO degradation (7%) excited by room-temperature variation in the range of 25 and 45 °C (Fig. 17c).168 The degradation pathways involving prime intermediate species were also analyzed by means of LC-MS with positive electrospray ionization (ESI) scan and chromatograms techniques (Fig. 17d and e) and the underlying mechanism of pyroelectric degradation of RhB was put forward (Fig. 17f). More importantly, the large pyroelectric potential of elongated BaTiO3 nanowires along the polar axis is critical for an efficient degradation catalytic process in comparison to the prepared BaTiO3 nanoparticles (48%) and commercial BaTiO3 counterpart (27%). Significantly, a recent investigation by Chen et al. found that the electric poling treatment with appropriate electric field intensity can modulate the arrangement of ferroelectric domains and largely strengthen the surface charge density of the BaTiO3 material, resulting in the remarkably promoted pyroelectric catalytic performance for the decomposition of RhB.169 Besides, noble metal modification was used as an effective means to improve the pyroelectric catalytic activity of BaTiO3 nanofibers, in which the dye pollutants were effectively degraded over BaTiO3 hybridized with noble metals such as Ag and Pd by varying the loading content of the noble metal under the stimulation of the collected temperature fluctuation energy.170 When the coating amount of Ag or Pd nanoparticles was 2.0 wt%, the pyroelectric catalytic activity of BaTiO3 was greatly promoted. The fabrication of the BaTiO3/noble metal hybrid allowed the full use of pyroelectrically-induced charge carries as Ag or Pd nanoparticles can function as positive charge trapping agents and speed up the separation and migration of positive and negative charges induced by the pyroelectric field. Similarly, it has been reported by Xu et al. that the combination of Ag nanoparticles and pyroelectric Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 is advantageous to overcoming the shortage of the single catalyst, hampering the recombination of pyroelectric-induced positive and negative charges and boosting pyroelectric catalytic activity.171 In the pyroelectric catalysis process, ˙O2−, ˙OH and holes have been shown to be the crucial active species for electrochemical redox reactions by using p-benzoquinone (BQ), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) as their capture agents, respectively. The optimum amount of Ag cocatalyst was 1.5 wt%, and almost RhB can be completely decomposed over the poled Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3/Ag hybrid catalyst after 50 thermal cycles fluctuating between 25 and 50 °C (Fig. 17h). In the whole system, the correlation of the pyroelectric effect and electrochemical redox process was reasonably proposed based on pyroelectric–catalytic performance and active species trapping experiments (Fig. 17g). Attracted by the investigation on the admirable decolonization activity of ZnO nanorods for RhB in an electrochemical process triggered by alternating heating and cooling ambient temperature in 2017,172 the BaTiO3/ZnO heterostructured pyroelectric-catalysts were prepared via hydrothermal and heat treatment by Wang et al. to efficiently degrade RhB under ambient room-temperature variation.173 With an optimum loading content (2.5 wt%) of ZnO, the BaTiO3/2.5 wt% ZnO composite showed a 4-fold increase in the dynamic rate of the pyroelectric catalytic reaction compared with the bare BaTiO3 nanowires in a cold–hot alternation environment (30–54 °C). The temperature-variation induced catalytic wastewater purification technique may show large potential in future with the development of various novel pyroelectric materials.174–176
5. Summary and perspective
In conclusion, this article provides an overview of the latest advances in energy and environmental applications of the catalytic reaction driven by stress and temperature variation in virtue of the piezoelectric/pyroelectric effects of the piezoelectric/pyroelectric nanomaterials. Initially, the essential characteristics of piezoelectric/pyroelectric materials and the catalytic process mechanism induced by polarity change under the stimulation of external strains or temperature fluctuation are introduced. Further, diverse applications for environmental decontamination and green energy production with extensive utility of various typical piezoelectric and pyroelectric materials are elaborately discussed. Finally, the challenges to be addressed and promising development insights of piezoelectric/pyroelectric catalysis are presented. This review is expected to shed light on new insights into the in-depth understanding and applications of piezoelectric/pyroelectric effects to address the energy crises and environmental deterioration through the harvesting of periodic mechanical stresses and temperature fluctuation energy.
Leading efforts for energy catalysis and environmental catalysis have provided many deep insights and shed light on the promising application of the collection and utilization process of periodic mechanical force and near room-temperature oscillation based on the polarization-modulated catalytic effects of pyroelectric and piezoelectric materials as summarized above. However, the implementation of high-efficiency catalytic activity driven by the piezopotential or pyropotential, depending on the continuous external driving force and efficient catalyst with benign durability, still has great challenges and future potential in the elementary period of this emerging field due to the modest utilization of charge carriers. With efficient extraction and utilization of polarization-modulated catalytic activity as the ultimate goal, future development may take into account the following three critical aspects.
First of all, the intrinsic mechanism of the piezoelectric or pyroelectric catalysis process should be of great significant concern, allowing for profound understanding and further maximizing the catalytic efficiency. The design of complex simulation systems and the development of advanced characterization are essential to uncover the actions of various possible influential factors of catalytic activity and to quantify the energy intake from mechanical stress or temperature changes, which are helpful for revealing the piezoelectric/pyroelectric basis, electric carrier distribution on the whole catalyst and their transfer dynamics, etc. The full use of theoretical research, such as density functional theory and the finite element technique, can simulate the energy changes of the whole catalyst or interface under temperature fluctuation simulation and analyze the intrinsic mechanism of complex systems. The advances in the above aspects are expected to elucidate the relationship among the structural characteristics, intrinsic polarization electric field and catalytic performance and recyclability of the piezoelectric/pyroelectric catalysts.
Secondly, the rational and precise design of piezoelectric and pyroelectric catalytic materials with indefatigable exploration is the foundation for the booming development and practical applications of catalysis driven by stress and temperature variation. In particular, it is highly anticipated to develop efficient piezoelectric and pyroelectric catalysts with many merits, such as large piezoelectric/pyroelectric coefficients, largely exposed surface with ample reactive sites, excellent energy collection capability, high cycling stability etc., by diverse manufacturing strategies, including microstructure regulation, noble metal loading, defect creation, heterojunction fabrication and incorporation of carbon-based materials or polymers. For example, the rational morphology design can effectively increase piezo/pyroelectric polarization and the utilization of mechanical energy and temperature fluctuation energy, thus accelerating the catalytic reaction process with the participation of charge carriers and adsorbed molecules. Creating defects presents great advantages in increasing the local charge density and providing more reactive sites for efficient catalytic reactions. It will not only enrich the material system of piezoelectric and pyroelectric catalysis, but will also provide feasible materials for future practical applications for energy catalysis and environmental catalysis. In particular, macroscopic polarization engineering shows great advantages in polarization enhancement and efficient ROS generation,45,177 which may bring a broad perspective for advanced catalytic development. Besides, the integration of active piezoelectric and pyroelectric catalysts and substrate materials with benign adsorption capacity displays significant advantages to ameliorate the poor retrievability and secondary contamination problems of powdered catalytic materials,107,120 which can greatly facilitate the development and utilization of mechanical stress and temperature variation-driven catalysis.
Thirdly, the collective stimulation of multiple energy sources is widely recognized as a promising and ideal solution to the discontinuous energy utilization dilemma in the unpredictable natural environment via piezoelectric/pyroelectric effects and redox reactions.178–180 For instance, the coupling of solar incident photons and piezoelectric/pyroelectric potential has been increasingly exploited for achieving high-efficiency renewable energy production and wastewater treatment.181 Under the irradiation of combined sources, multiple reaction processes occur simultaneously, which is expected to make full use of positive and negative charges without limitation to the addition of sacrificial agents, such as the combined reactions of heavy metal reduction and organic contamination oxidation.154 In addition, new catalytic applications of piezoelectrics and pyroelectrics will need to be broadened and explored to provide insights and practical versatility for applications by harvesting natural variation energy (tide, wind, geothermal energy, nyctohemeral temperature fluctuation, etc.), such as nitrogen fixing, biomedicine, and selective organic synthesis.
