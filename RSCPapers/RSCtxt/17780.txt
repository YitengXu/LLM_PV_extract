1. Introduction
Since the first discovery of laser oscillation nearly sixty years ago,1 lasing applications have spread over various areas, including scientific researches, pharmaceutical industries, telecommunications, etc. The development of materials plays a crucial role in advancing novel laser techniques.
Organic semiconductors have attracted immense attention in recent years owing to their large-area and low-cost manufacturing by solution processing, and tunable optoelectronic properties by the convenient molecular design, which make them potential materials for numerous applications such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),2–5 organic solar cells (OSCs),6–8 organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs)9,10 and organic solid-state lasers (OSSLs).11,12 A variety of organic semiconductors have been explored, which significantly promote the rapid progress of organic electronics. Particularly, extensive studies have been carried out to promote OLEDs into commercial applications as flat-panel displays and solid-state lighting emitters. OSSLs, especially organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs), the likely successor to OLEDs, as another important class of organic light emitters, have been a young and challenging research topic. A large amount of organic light emitters have been explored as gain media. Due to their facile processabilities, organic semiconductors are compatible with various optical resonators, and in many cases, the optical resonators can be integrated directly with organic gain media, leading to the versatile and relatively low-cost laser devices.
OSSLs can date back to 1967, when rhodamine 6G doped in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was reported as an organic gain medium.13 Whereafter OSLs based on anthracene in doped and non-doped single crystals were reported.14,15 In 1987, Tang and Van Slyke at Kodak reported the first thin-film OLED using tris(8-quinolinolato) aluminum(III) (Alq3) as the emissive layer.16 The significant advancements of OLEDs have revolutionized our understanding on the structure design and functions of organic materials, leading to remarkable progress in the development of OSLs. The first OSLs based on conjugated polymers were reported by Friend and Heeger in 1996 by using poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) and PPV derivatives as organic gain media.17,18 Since then, a number of reports on organic semiconductors based OSSLs have emerged. A majority of organic semiconductors are demonstrated with high optical gain, enabling their uses as optical amplifiers and laser media. The development milestones of organic gain media are summarized in Fig. 1.12–14,16–23
 Fig. 1  The development milestones of organic gain media. Soffer and McFarland firstly demonstrated the organic dye for solid-state laser in 1967.13 The first organic crystal laser using anthracene as gain media was reported by Karl in 1972.14 Tang and VanSlyke demonstrated the first OLED using Alq3 as the emitter in 1987.16 In 1996, the groups of Friend and Heeger reported the solid-state conjugated polymer lasers by using PPV and PPV derivatives as gain media, respectively.17,18 In 2008, a polymer laser pumped by LED was proposed by Samuel's group using a fluorene co-polymer as the emitter.19 Lai and co-workers in 2009 reported a deep-blue laser with very low lasing threshold and high slope efficiency using monodisperse starburst macromolecular semiconductors as gain media.12 In 2011, the first observation of lasing behavior in a living system with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was reported by Gather and co-workers.20 Most recently, Adachi's group reported the quasi continuous-wave (CW) lasers based on 4,4′-bis[(N-carbazole)styryl]biphenyl (BSBCz) emitters, and near-infrared (NIR) thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters (boron difluoride curcuminoid derivatives) as gain media.21,22 An electrically pumped organic laser based on BSBCz as gain medium has been demonstrated by Adachi in 2019.23 
A number of excellent book chapters and review articles focusing on various aspects of OSSLs have been published recently, covering topics including organic crystal lasers,24–28 light-emitting diode (LED) pumped lasers,29,30 innovative laser fabrication techniques and applications,31–33 the prospect of electrically-driven lasers,34etc. Although several reviews on OSSLs have been constructed by Samuel,35 Forget,36 and Gather,37 it should be noted that there is no review or book chapter by far to make a comprehensive introduction focusing on organic gain media. Consequently, a review that provides a clear panorama of organic gain media is highly desirable to build up a comprehensive overview and for those who may be interested in the field to get a quick understanding and appreciation of this exciting research direction. In this review, first, the architectures of organic lasers are briefly described, which require a definite selection of organic gain media. Next, a comprehensive overview of organic gain media is presented with the latest researches on organic lasers and gain media. The emphatic illustration is placed on the different types of organic gain media as well as the discussion of the development and challenges of OSSLs. The last chapter highlights the strategies and efforts to overcome the challenges accompanied with the electrically pumped OSSLs. A major goal of this review is to provide illustrative accounts on recent researches and systematize our knowledge in this field, building up the basic relationships between organic gain media and light amplified behaviors. The fundamental principles, extracted from diverse research topics, are vital for the rational molecular design of organic gain media for electrically pumped OSSL applications.
2. Organic semiconductor laser architectures
2.1 The building blocks of lasers
Like any other lasers, organic lasers are comprised of three principal building blocks, a pumping source, an optical feedback structure, and a gain medium. The organic gain medium, a π-conjugated organic molecule in most cases, is the basic characteristic of an organic laser. To fully explore the potentials of organic lasers, such as facile processing, mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility, organic molecules are widely investigated as optical gain media for organic lasers. Indeed, the gain media with specific shapes can act as optical feedback structures by themselves. As far as we are concerned, for the purpose of laser operation, light trapped within the feedback structure needs to be amplified, which is required to depress any loss involved in the whole process. As shown in Fig. 2, a classical laser design consists of two mirrors for optical feedback with organic gain media filling the space inside. A fraction of the spontaneous emission from organic semiconductors could be reflected back and forth between the mirrors. With the interactions of excitons in organic gain media in their excited states, light can initiate stimulated emission and thus be amplified. If the light amplification exceeds the optical losses that usually resulted from cavity defect and absorption of gain medium itself, a continuous photon avalanche will occur.
 Fig. 2  The principal building blocks of a laser: a pumping source, an optical feedback structure (formed by two curved mirrors), and a gain medium. 
2.2 Quasi four-level laser structure of organic semiconductors
In order to realize efficient lasing output from an integrated optical feedback structure, the construction of multiple level lasing system is necessary to achieve efficient population inversion. Organic gain media are generally advantageous due to their inherent quasi four-level lasing systems. As depicted in Fig. 3, organic materials are usually rich in energy levels, so many stimulated radiative channels are formed under the coupling of electronic vibration. Actually, most organic emitters are featuring with quasi four-level systems. In the case of optical pumping, the excitons are excited from the electronic ground state (S0, level 1) to the first electronic excited state (S1, level 2) followed by a rapid vibrational relaxation process to the lowest vibrational level of S1 (level 3). Due to the short lifetime from level 2 to level 3 (less than a picosecond), the population inversion usually occurs from level 3 to one of the higher vibrational levels of S0 (level 4). It is very fast for vibrational relaxation back to level 1, which prevents the construction of any significant exciton population in level 4. Considering the inevitable optical loss in the gain media and integrated optical devices, the inherent four-level system of organic emitters is thus much more favorable to ensure the initial sufficient optical gain for generating efficient lasing output.
 Fig. 3  Energy level diagram of an organic semiconductor, showing singlet excitons, triplet excitons and charges. 
There are various unfavorable losses, such as cavity scattering, ground-state self-absorption, charge absorption, triplet excited state absorption and so on. These losses can introduce absorption in the lasing/amplification wavelength region, thus reducing the lasing output energy and/or preventing the lasing output. As shown in Fig. 3, the singlet excitons may flip their spins to the lowest triplet excitation state (T1) through intersystem crossing (ISC), generally lower in energy, where they can accumulate because of the much longer triplet-state lifetime compared with that of S1. Unfortunately, the triplet–triplet absorption band is very broad and overlaps the singlet fluorescence emission band.38 The long lived triplet excitons can lead to optical losses for light amplification due to triplet–triplet absorption and the reduction of S1 population via singlet–triplet annihilation (STA). Charge absorption is another important absorption process potentially detrimental to lasing (see Fig. 3). As the absorption overlaps with the stimulated emission and the long lifetimes allow significant population build-up, the absorption from charge excited states could prejudice the stimulated emission and gain.32,39 The influences of charge absorption and triplet excitons under electrically-driven conditions will be discussed further in Section 4.
In most reports, fluorescent emitters are used as organic gain media, while triplet emitters with phosphorescence or TADF are rarely reported.22,40–43 Theoretically, population inversion could also be realized for triplet emitters by constructing quasi four-level lasing system. However, for most triplet emitters (phosphorescence or TADF emitters), the cross-section of the excited-state absorption (σex, T1 → Tn) is much larger than the maximum cross-section of stimulated emission (σem, T1 → S0). As a result, no stimulated emission occurs during the pumping process.44
2.3 Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)
ASE characterization is a simple and effective methodology to compare the gain characteristics of different materials without cavity effects. When the population inversion is established in the quasi four-level system, the stimulated emission amplification occurs in the gain medium without optical feedback structure. A photon avalanche called ASE will occur through further stimulated emission. ASE characterizations can be used to quantify the available gain excluding an optical feedback structure. Besides, ASE intensity is collected from the edge of the sample as a function of stripe length, which is referred to the variable stripe length (VSL) method. After firstly reported in nitrogen laser by Shaklee,45 VSL method has been widely used to evaluate the gain characteristics of organic gain media.11,46–55 The typical gains of organic gain media recorded with VSL method are in the range of 100–102 cm−1.
Actually, the gain could be evaluated by changing the lasing (or amplification) output or changing the stimulated emission-induced signals under different conditions.56–62 Another general method to study gains in organic gain media is by transient absorption measurement. The gain calculated from transient absorption measurement is from the changes in transmission due to the formation of stimulated emission during the short-pulse (typically 100 fs) lasing excitation. Transient absorption gives more insight into the factors controlling the gain and provides the gain dynamics. Very high gain is confirmed in this process. For example, the gain coefficients of methyl-substituted ladder-type poly(paraphenylene) (MeLPPP) and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO) were calculated to be 2 × 103 cm−1 and 1.2 × 104 cm−1, respectively, through the transient femtosecond pump/probe experiments.59,60 However, the gain lifetimes are usually short (within picosecond time scale). This means that a high pump rate is needed to maintain a population inversion, which may lead to exciton annihilation.
It is worth mentioning that ASE and some other effects are mistakenly interpreted as lasing characteristics, which complicates the unambiguous identification of organic lasing. Careful consideration should be given to the evaluation of lasing rather than ASE, especially in the case of electrical pumping conditions.63 Generally speaking, the threshold and the linewidth narrowing of ASE are less pronounced as compared with lasing. In general, the line width of ASE is a few nanometers, while that of single-mode lasing is less than 1 nm.63
2.4 Optical feedback structures
The design and manufacturing of optical feedback structures has been developing constantly since lasing was first demonstrated in 1960s. These designs have been widely used for constructing organic lasers. Due to the facile solution-processibility and the availability of simple device fabrication process of organic gain media, various optical resonator configurations have been demonstrated to be able to achieve efficient lasing output, including photonic crystals, microcavities, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators (including micro-disks, micro-cones, and micro-rings), diffraction configurations with optical grating structures, i.e., distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR) and distributed feedback (DFB), etc. An updated comprehensive review regarding the advances on optical feedback structures has recently been summarized by Kuehne and Gather.37
It is generally considered that the laser with incorporating an organic gain medium is “organic laser”. Actually, numerous examples of organic lasers consist of both organic gain medium and organic optical feedback structure. In some cases, the feedback structures are formed by the gain materials themselves, which are advantageous in simplifying the device manufacturing. In this section, we emphatically discuss the recent advancements of “organic” optical feedback structures.

2.4.1 Organic crystal-based cavities. 
Regular crystalline organic microcrystal can be acted as both active gain medium and optical feedback micro-resonator. In order to form optical feedback structures, one method is to use end crystal facets as Fresnel reflection in organic crystals. Fig. 4a depicts the schematic representation of the excitation direction and the Fabry–Perot resonator cavity constituted with the lateral facets of the crystal. The crystal has a group refractive index of up to ca. 3 and allows a cavity length in an order of magnitude of 100 μm. Although the Fresnel reflection at the interface between the crystal and air is only ca. 30%, the Q factor has been reported to be greater than 1000.64–66 Compared with the traditional microcavity, the cavity length in the crystal is a multiple of λ/2, thus enabling lasing output with wavelength of λ. Recently, similar crystal cavities have been integrated into microlaser arrays.67

In the polygonal crystal arrays, the square or hexagon has attracted much attention because of its good light confinement and total internal reflection characteristics (see Fig. 4b–e). Lasing oscillations have been observed in various small molecular crystals over recent years.68–73 Besides, these crystalline laser cavities are arranged into specific arrays, thus providing a method to realize multimode lasing with specific characteristics on a single substrate.74 However, the length of the resonator cavity length is uncontrollable. Therefore, it is still a challenge to simultaneously realize high-quality single-crystal resonators and the patterning of these cavities in a large area with a high spatial resolution at submicrometer level. From a few reports, the template-assisted75,76 and substrate-assisted methods77–79 are much helpful to fabricate organic crystal arrays with high crystal quality. These methods make it possible to design high-order large-area organic crystal arrays for flat-panel laser display applications.80,81


2.4.2 Organic nanowires (ONWs) and fibers. 
Free-standing semiconductor nanowires are attractive building blocks for creating electrically driven lasers, because their defect-free structures exhibit superior electrical transport characteristics in high-quality planar devices. One dimensional (1D) inorganic nanowires are emerging as promising candidates for integrated, subwavelength active and passive photonic devices, especially for electrically pumped lasers.61,82–84 Single nanowire can also be used as an independent gain medium and optical cavity. Microscopic dimensional Fabry–Perot resonators can be fabricated from wires and fibers, where the nanowires act as optical waveguides and the end-facets act as mirrors. ONWs with submicrometer diameters can be fabricated with various methods including electrospinning (ES), physical vapor deposition (PVD), solution self-assembly method and template wetting.85 As shown in Fig. 5a and b, a better insight into the waveguide capability and lasing performance could be achieved by collecting the photoluminescence (PL) signal from a single nanofiber tip, which is excited by a tightly focused laser beam.86,87 O’Carroll et al. observed the first single conjugated-polymer nanowire lasing by using template-wetting method.88Fig. 5c shows a fluorescence micrograph of random PFO nanowires. The microcavity effect in PFO nanowire was demonstrated by observing the emission spectrum collected from the tip rather than the bulk spectrum (Fig. 5d), and the mode spacing is linearly related to the reciprocal of the length of the ONW. In addition, lasing action with one dominated narrowed emission peak was observed above the lasing fluence of ca. 2.89 mJ cm−2 (100 nJ per pulse) (Fig. 5e). The lasing action was also observed in small-molecular single-crystal ONWs (2,4,5-triphenylimidazole, TPI) via adsorbent-assisted PVD fabrication. The microcavity behaviors were affected significantly by the wire dimensions.89

Because the solution self-assembly method is a simple alternative method for the preparation of ONWs, it is possible to use compounds that are easy to crystallize to prepare ONWs. Zhang et al. reported two-photon-pumped (TPP) blue lasing in 2-(N,N-diethylanilin-4-yl)-4,6-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (DPBT) ONWs.90 A THF solution of DPBT with the molecular packing preference along one crystal axis, was injected into an aqueous cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution, resulting in uniform single-crystalline ONWs with the assistance of the surfactant. ONWs were obtained with the lengths of several micrometers and diameters of less than 1 μm. TPP fluorescence was excited by femtosecond pulse laser on the wires. Upon cooling to 77 K, emission from exciton polariton emerged and lasing was achieved at threshold of 60 nJ per pulse. Recently, various compounds, such as N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-2,5,8,11-tetrakis(o-methylphenyl)-perylene-4:9,10-tetracarboxylic acid diimide (mp-PDI-2),91 1,4-chloride-2,5-di[4′-(methylthio)styryl-benzene] (CDSB),92 have been successfully fabricated into ONWs by using this method for constructing organic lasers.
ES shows many advantages for constructing photonic systems based on ONWs because of its ability for the control of ONW morphology and diameter. Camposeo et al. reported lasing emission from electrospun PMMA nanowires embedded with coumarin 334, rhodamine 6G, and Nile Blue A perchlorate, respectively.93 The fiber diameters were well controlled between 100 and 600 nm. Lasing was observed at a threshold of 60 μJ cm−2 from doped rhodamine 6G nanowire. Moreover, the electrospun fibers made of conjugated polymers can obtain the nonwoven fleeces consisting entirely of gain materials. By using room temperature nanoimprint lithography (NIL), Benedetto et al. prepared the electrospun conjugated polymer fibers with imprinted periodic structures, with significant waveguide enhancement along the fibers.86 Such a geometry can be used for the enhancement of nanofiber forward emission, but lasing was not demonstrated. Recently, nanowire lasing from perovskites were also reported.94,95


2.4.3 Organic quasi-periodic structures. 
The constructions of the quasi-periodic structures as feedback structures, based on organic materials themselves have become a hot topic in recent years. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs), also well known as coordination polymers, were first reported in the mid-1990's by Yaghi et al.96,97 It is a novel type of solid crystalline materials, which are able to combine the advantages of both traditional organic and inorganic photoluminescent materials, manifesting unique properties. MOFs have emerged as multifunctional materials for various applications, including catalysis, chemical sensing, gas storage and separation, biomedicine, and optical/electronic/magnetic applications.98 As host matrices, MOFs offer an unique platform to confine and stabilize functional species, leading to unique behaviors in the defined pore environments.99 By fixing the organic dyes into the MOF pore spaces, a Fabry–Perot cavity was constructed by using the top and bottom facets of the rectangular MOF crystal, which provides necessary feedback by efficiently reflecting the stimulated emission for lasing output. Yu et al. reported TPP microlasers by encapsulating the cationic dye (4-[p-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium (DMASM)) into the anionic bio-MOF-1 (Fig. 6a).100 The resulting bio-MOF-1⊃DMASM exhibited new fluorescence emission in orange to red region. The PL quantum yield (PLQY) of 25.9% was achieved for bio-MOF-1⊃DMASM, which is higher than that of DMASM solution and powder (Fig. 6b–e). The significantly enhanced fluorescence efficiency and the large two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-section of DMASMI dye (ca. 104 GM, 1 GM = 10−50 cm4 s photon−1 molecule−1) enabled bio-MOF-1⊃DMASM to be an outstanding TPP up-conversion laser emitter. A high-quality (Q ≈ 1500) Fabry–Perot cavity was built up using MOF crystals as reflectors. As shown in Fig. 6f, TPP lasing around 640 nm with a threshold of 18.8 mJ cm−2 (0.148 mJ per pulse) was observed in bio-MOF-1⊃DMASM pumped at 1064 nm. This study provides a new way to construct organic quasi-periodic structures, and opens a new application prospect for TPP microlasers with high efficiency for photonic integrated circuits. MOF crystal for three-photon-pumped (3PP) microlaser has been realized in ZJU-68⊃DMASM via the same strategy by He et al.101 By sequentially changing the polarity of the adsorbed solvents from water to toluene low-polarity, Wei et al. observed lasing behaviors with wavelength tuning over 40 nm in a single MOF (DASP+@bio-MOF-100) based microlaser.102 Recently, stimulated emission from MOF single crystals were reported, which will be discussed in Section 3.2.4.5.103

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as another kind of crystalline porous polymers, also first reported by Yaghi's group in 2005,104 provide specific spaces for the interactions among electrons, holes, photons, excitons and guest molecules, thereby exhibiting specific properties and functions.105–107 Some fluorescent 3D COFs have been explored and used for explosive detection,108,109 however, COFs themselves acting as quasi-periodic structures or gain media remain challenging.


2.4.4 Random lasers. 
Usually, laser actions occur in precisely configured resonant cavities. However, coherent laser actions may also occur in disordered systems, when excitation intensity exceeds a certain threshold, which is known as “random lasing”. Optical structures can be created in a random laser by utilizing the intrinsic disorders in organic/inorganic photonic materials. The lasing was ascribed to multiple scattering resulted from refractive index inhomogeneities (e.g., impurities, crystallites and morphology variations) that provided a closed light path for optical feedback without additional laser cavity. The primary competitive advantage of random lasers, compared with regular lasers, is cost-effective and facile processing. The high-precision approaches for generating ultra-precise microcavities/gratings are not demanded here. Additionally, the laser devices can be produced on large scales with high emission efficiency.110 Random lasers often show a multitude of narrow laser lines accordingly by changing the position and excitation density.111 Resonance in random lasers is generally obtained by multiple scattering with a random path and localized states in the ill-defined and disordered gain media.
The random laser can be easily manufactured on an industrial scale. The key point to realize random lasing is creating strong enough scattering, which determines the lasing process. Various optical gain media were reported with random lasing property, such as liquid laser dyes with scatterers,112–114 laser crystals and solid-state luminescent powders,115 alumina nanoclusters and scattering films,116 polymeric films with scatterers,117–119 porous media infiltrated with dyes and others,120–122etc. Owing to their advantages such as low cost, simple operation, strong robustness, random lasers have attracted much attention in both theoretical and experimental fields, and has potential applications in the fields of sensors,123 micrometer-scale laser sources,110 and laser imaging.124

2.5 Pumping sources
In most cases, the pumping source for organic lasers is an external, pulsed light source, which is used to directly pump the organic gain media. The pumping light sources could be lasers (in most cases), laser diodes,125–127 LEDs,19,29,30etc. Due to the low power densities needed for thresholds in some feedback structures, such as DFB gratings and photonic crystals, they are promising in achieving abundant exciton densities for lasing actions via electrical pumping. The typical electrical device structures to realize electric excitation are vertical OLED architecture and planar organic light-emitting transistor (OLET) geometry. A recent work reported an example of organic lasing from electrically pumped OLEDs with using electrical pumping source (see Section 4 for more details).23
Using the optical structures of various gain media, including TPP lasers, 3PP lasers and four photon pump lasers, the multi-photon pumped (MPP) frequency-upconversion lasers are also realized.128 The gain media of MPP lasers include organic dye solutions, dye-doped solid rods, crystals, optical nanowires/fibers, thin film waveguide structures, etc.
3. Organic gain media
Organic dyes dissolved in liquid solvents have been explored for lasing applications for decades.129 However, close packing of organic pigments often leads to self-quenching of luminescence. Alternatively, doping dyes into non-conjugated polymers, such as polystyrene (PS) and PMMA, are suitable for OSSLs. Actually, there are fundamental similarities between “organic dye lasers” and “OSLs”, so it is vital to classify these materials.
Historically, the distinction between dyes and organic semiconductors has been motivated by the pursuit of achieving electrically pumped lasers. At present, most of the pumping sources of organic lasers are still optical devices, and their semiconducting properties have not been fully studied. In those cases, it seems irrelevant to distinguish dyes from organic semiconductors according to their electrical properties. In this review, we follow the viewpoint of Samuel et al. to classify organic dyes and organic semiconductors.35 Three properties are proposed to make a division for organic semiconductors, i.e., (i) easy processing in the thin film fabrication, (ii) a high PLQY even in neat film, and (iii) capability of charge transport.
In this section, we will introduce the development of organic gain media, including organic dyes, fluorescent organic semiconductor emitters, triplet gain media, and others.
3.1 Organic dyes
In the historical and usual sense, an organic dye is a substance able to impart color to another one. Organic dyes have an absorption band in the spectral region from ultraviolet (UV) to NIR. All these molecules involve multiple conjugated double bonds, which strongly confine their spectral properties and their chemical reactivities. One of the significant causes for the rise of dye lasers is the huge panel of molecular structures, which able to act as laser dyes. The emission of laser dyes cover the whole visible spectrum, and even include the spectral region of near UV and NIR. More than 500 different dyes can be found on commercial websites, such as Luxottica|Exciton (website link: https://exciton.luxottica.com), with various absorption and emission bands. The categories based on their chemical structures are usually used as laser dyes. The main laser dye series are coumarins (1), xanthenes (2), and pyrromethenes (3).
The xanthene family has been widely used in history, especially the high efficiency rhodamine dyes (rhodamine 640, rhodamine 6G, etc.). Over the last decades, dyes have been more particularly explored for lasing applications with enhanced performance and photostability. Here, we briefly introduce some well-known laser dyes.
Coumarin dyes are an important family as their emission covering the wavelength range of violet to green. A generic coumarin is the alliance of a cyclobenzene with a pyrone, attached with various substituents on this basic core, as depicted in Scheme 1. The nature of these attached substituents strongly dominate the spectroscopic properties of coumarin dyes (the basic coumarin molecule is non-fluorescent). Seven samples (coumarins 153, 343, 521, 504, 460, 6 and 540) (1a–1g) are given in Scheme 1. Coumarins are relatively efficient as laser dyes, however, their very weak photostabilities limit their applications.130
 Scheme 1  Dye examples, including coumarin dyes, rhodamine dyes and pyrromethene dyes. 
Xanthenes are a class of dyes including rhodamines, eosins and fluorescein. These molecules emit with high efficiency and good photostability in the green to red spectral region. The basis core of rhodamine dyes (2a–2e) is two benzene rings associated with a pyran ring in the middle (see in Scheme 1). Among them, rhodamine 6G (2a) is extensively used and often selected as the benchmark for other laser dyes. The singlet–singlet absorption of rhodamine 6G is very strong with molar extinction coefficient of 1.1 × 105 l mol−1 cm−1 at 540 nm. But at the same time, as one of the major issues for organic lasers, triplet–triplet absorption (see Section 2.2) is also non-negligible.131 An attractive way for improving the efficiencies of dye lasers is to depress the triplet–triplet absorption, as discussed later.
Pyrromethene dyes (3a–3e) are a new category of laser dyes recently developed. Their chemical structures are depicted in Scheme 1. The basic unit structure consists of two pyrroles linked by a BF2 group and a methylene with high rigidity. Pyrromethene dyes exhibit good solubilities in organic solvents (or in polymer matrixes) and good thermal stabilities, high PLQYs (>0.9) and reduced rates of intersystem crossing, making them generally outperform rhodamine 6G (2a). Moreover, pyrromethene dyes provide a variety of functional positions, and the linked end-cappers have significant impacts on the characteristics of fluorescence and stimulated emission. Probably the most well-known pyrromethene dyes for lasing are 1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-2,6-diethylpyrromethene-difluoroborate (named as pyrromethene 567, 3a), where the two lateral end-cappers are C2H5, and 1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-2,6-di-t-butylpyrromethene-difluoroborate (named as pyrromethene 597, 3c), where the two lateral end-cappers are tert-butyles. The bulky tert-butyles in pyrromethene 597 (3c) may cause the enhanced steric hindrance, which makes the excited-state molecule non-planar, leading to a lower PLQY than Pyrromethene 567 (3a).132 Massive efforts have been made to demonstrate the 8-position (R2, symmetric to the BF2 group) substitution's influence by linking different functional groups, such as alkyl, aryl133 and some more complex groups.132,134–136 The novel pyrromethene dyes, named as PA-BODIPY (3d)135 and EDOT-BODIPY (3e),136 are listed in Scheme 1. The photostabilities of pyrromethenes were relatively weak in solution. In fact, the singlet oxygen generated at the 7,8 double bond of the central ring in the triplet states during exciting the molecule generally induces a metastable compound, and eventually destructs the dye structure.137 The degradation influence of oxygen could be limited by adding oxygen quenchers in deoxygenated solutions. The different 8 position substitutions also influence the photostabilities without sacrificing the intrinsic spectral characteristics.137 Interestingly, when incorporating pyrromethene dye into a solid-state matrix, the dissolved oxygen quantity is lower, leading to improved lifetime.
Additionally, there are some other laser dyes, including stilbene dyes (e.g., stilbene 420 (4),138 as shown in Scheme 2), cyanine dyes (e.g., LDS 698 (6),139 LDS 798 (7),140 and LDS 950 (8),141 as shown in Scheme 2), and oxazine dyes (e.g., Nile blue 690, as shown in Fig. 7). Scheme 2 also presents the chemical structures of 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostryl)-4H-pyran (DCM, 5a) and 4-dicyanomethylene-2-tert-butyl-6(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-pyran (DCJTB, 5b) that are extensively used for dye lasers.

As shown in Fig. 7a, organic dyes exhibit broad emission tunabilities covering the whole spectral region from UV to NIR. Mhibik et al. demonstrated very broadly tunable lasers within 230 nm range (from 440 nm to 670 nm), by using coumarin 460 (C 460, 1e), coumarin 540 A (C 540A, 1d), pyrromethene 567 (P 567, 3a), pyrromethene 597 (P 597, 3c), and a blend of rhodamine 640 and C 540A (1d) as the doped emitters.142 Continuous wavelength tunability (within 50 nm) for a given material is obtained by rotating the Fabry–Perot interferometer inside the microcavity. PMMA-coated film is selected as Fabry–Perot interferometer. When C 540A (1d) was used as a doped emitter, a clear lasing threshold of 8.46 mJ cm−2 (11 μJ per pulse) is detectable with a lasing slope efficiency of 8% and maximum output energy of 4.5 μJ per pulse. LDS798 (7) and LDS950 (8) are explored as NIR laser dyes. The ASE thresholds are ca. 12 μJ cm−2 and 0.22 mJ cm−2 for LDS798 (7) and LDS950 (8), respectively.140,141
The laser dyes can be doped in organic semiconductor materials to construct the guest–host systems. The organic semiconductor host could get rid of concentration quenching of laser dyes by physically separating the emissive units, and transferring efficient energy to the laser dyes via Förster energy transfer (FRET). A typical example is Alq3:DCM (5a).143–145 In this case, the host material with high-energy band gap absorbs the pump energy, and then transfers its energy to the guest with low-energy band gap (DCM, 5a) via FRET. Compared to the DCM (5a) doping system in a passive matrix, such as PS and PMMA, the guest–host energy transfer system enables a much higher pumping source absorption; the resulting guest–host system is also conductive for charge transport via Alq3 semiconductors. The enlarged Stokes shift consequently reduces self-absorption. Moreover, in the resulting guest–host system where the laser dye act as the guest, the device exhibit semiconductor characteristics.146–148 For example, Adachi's group recently reported deep-red ASE from a novel dye, named as cis-configured squaraine (cis-DCSQ, 9), under optical pumping.148 The chemical structure of cis-DCSQ (9) is shown in Scheme 2. By doping cis-DCSQ (9) into a 4,4′-bis(9-carbazolyl)-2,2′-biphenyl (CBP) host at a concentration of 0.5 wt%, a marked increase of PLQY is achieved in the doped film because of efficient FRET between CBP and cis-DCSQ and suppressed aggregation-induced quenching. The doped film exhibited stimulated emission with an ASE threshold of ca. 10 μJ cm−2 and emission peak at 687 nm.
Compared with organic dyes, organic semiconductors are much more favorable for lasing applications, due to their facile chemical functionalization, relatively low lasing thresholds, and semiconducting electrical properties. Various organic semiconductors have been explored and investigated for lasing applications, which will be discussed extensively in the next section. Owing to their facile synthesis, organic dyes are convenient and unique alternatives for generating tunable coherent radiation in the full visible and NIR spectral regions.149 Recently, based on doped laser dyes as the emitters, nanowire lasers,93,150 random lasers,113,114,151 and multi-photon pumped lasers152 have been reported.
3.2 Fluorescent organic semiconductor materials
In the late 1980s, Tang and Van Slyke at Kodak invented the first thin-film OLED with Alq3 as the emitter.16 The rapid progress of OLEDs has revolutionized our understanding on the relationship between molecular structures and optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductor materials, which has inspired the remarkable advancements in OSLs. So far, a number of materials have been reported as organic gain media. Fluorescence materials for OSLs can be primarily categorized into organic crystals, amorphous small molecules, dendritic starburst molecules, conjugated polymers, etc. The latest triplet gain media will be individually discussed in Section 3.3.
In the following sections, we present a summary covering the latest advances and highlight the fluorescent organic gain materials with outstanding behavior and high performance. According to data extracted from most reports, we summarize the emission wavelengths, required energy densities at thresholds (areal energy densities, areal power energy densities), and gain values of the gain media. We also discuss the gain materials with particular focus on the important optoelectronic parameters including PLQY, full width at half maximum (FWHM), ASE/lasing energy density at threshold, optical gain, and the mentioned relevant values.

3.2.1 Organic crystals. 
Lasing were recorded in doped and non-doped organic crystals by using anthracene (10) as the emitter in 197214 and 1974,15 respectively. Since then, organic crystals have drawn immense attention for their attractive applications as laser photonics.24,25,27
Compared with amorphous materials, organic crystals possess long-range molecular order, which provides advantageous high anisotropy of the crystals and well-defined crystalline structure to form self-laser-cavity, leading to better thermal and photochemical stabilities, superior charge-carrier transport properties, larger refractive indexes and polarized emission. Until now, ASE or lasing properties are quite inferior for most of the existing organic crystals, including oligothiophenes, oligophenylenes, thiophene–phenylene co-oligomers (TPCOs), oligophenylene vinylenes (nPVs), fluorene/phenylene co-oligomers, cyano derivatives, etc.25 For organic crystals, the crystal quality, molecular stacking, and intermolecular interactions could play important roles in amplification (or lasing) behaviors.24,25
3.2.1.1 Thiophene and phenylene based crystals. 
α-Linked oligothiophenes (11–13) are a typical class of materials for optoelectronic devices, especially crystal laser devices. Population inversion was firstly demonstrated in non-doped α-8T crystals (13).153 The linear α-8T molecules have quasi-planar all-trans conformation, and are all parallel to each other in crystal. The stimulated emission of α-8T (13) appeared initially with narrowed emission peak at 700 nm. With the further increase of pump energy, a second narrow emission appears at 640 nm. In α-4T (11) and α-6T (12) crystals, similar phenomena were also observed.154–156 The stimulated emission lines correspond to 0–1 and 0–2 vibronic transitions. The strong intermolecular interactions lead to low PLQYs (less than 9%) in unsubstituted oligothiophenes (α-nTs). Oligothiophenes with various functional groups or constructing fused oligothiophenes have thus been explored to enhance the PL efficiencies in solid state by depressing the intermolecular interactions. For example, functionalization with two ketones at the thienyl sulphur atom and adding some flexible chains in the rigid skeleton have significantly increased solid-state PLQYs (up to 37%) and tunable PL emission.157
Oligophenylenes (14–16) are another well-studied category of organic semiconductors, which exhibit high PLQYs in both solution and solid state. As a model compound, p-sexiphenyl (p-6P, 16) crystal was investigated extensively regarding the ASE and self-optical feedback properties.158–160 Blue lasing were observed in both single p-6P (16) nanofiber and close packed crystalline nanofiber film. A high net gain value of up to 103 cm−1 was detected in the nanofiber.161 ASE behaviors of the same material under femtosecond and nanosecond pumping conditions were different.162,163 The report by Losio et al. showed that under femtosecond lasing pulses excitation, there are dual-wavelength ASE at 427 and 450 nm in p-6P (16) bulk crystals; while excitation by nanosecond laser pulses led to only one peak at 450 nm. It suggested that the population inversion at 427 nm might has larger non-radiative loss compared to that at 450 nm.162 In fact, the sample morphologies significantly influence on ASE properties. The competitive dual-wavelength ASE at 0–1 and 0–2 transitions was also observed in other material system by varying the crystal thicknesses.164 The reabsorption process is considered to affect their net gain properties.
Another class of organic crystals with stimulated emission are TPCOs (17–27), in which the phenylene and thiophene are hybridized at the molecular level. In the past decade, a large number of TPCOs have been developed, including block and alternating co-oligomer, phenyl-capped oligothiophenes, thienyl-capped oligophenylenes, etc.165–172 As shown in Scheme 3, the extension of π-conjugated TPCO molecular backbones can be adjusted by varying the total numbers of ring and arranging the phenylene and thiophene units at the molecular level. For example, introducing a longer thiophene as the molecular block with biphenyl groups as end cappers, the bandgap decreased in the sequence of BP1T (22) > BP2T (24) > BP3T (26) (the chemical structures of BP1T(22), BP2T (24) and BP3T (26) are depicted in Scheme 3; the number of 1, 2, or 3 represents the number of thiophene groups in the corresponding molecular structures). For BP1T (22) crystal, ASE occurred at 466 nm,160 while the stimulated wavelength moved to 618 nm for BP3T (26).71 By extending the π-conjugated backbones, ASE emission shifted from blue- to red-spectral region in different TPCOs crystals. Moreover, the various molecular shapes in TPCOs, e.g., bent, straight, and zigzag, are beneficial for weakening the intermolecular interactions and enhancing the PL emission.64,173–176 Recently, Dong et al. reported dual-wavelength lasing behaviors of hexagonal shaped BP2T (24) microcrystals.177 A WGM resonator was constituted of the flat surfaces and smooth end facets of the hexagonal BP2T (24) microdisk, and provided efficient feedback for lasing oscillation. The vibrational structured fluorescence property of BP2T (24) microdisk brought dual-wavelength lasing corresponding to the 0–1 and 0–2 vibronic transitions. The lasing thresholds at 0–1 and 0–2 vibronic transitions were 27.2 μJ cm−2 and 31.8 μJ cm−2 with lasing peaks at 527 nm and 562 nm, respectively. Interestingly, under certain vibronic transitions, the dual-wavelength lasing could be reversibly switched by the modulation of the relative optical gain intensity by controlling the population via varying the operational temperatures. Also reported by Dong et al., by adding optical absorber (BP3T, 26) into BP1T (22) microcrystals, the output lasing wavelengths of BP1T (22) were switched across all vibronic bands (0–1, 0–2, 0–3, and 0–4) covering the entire emission spectrum.178 These studies provide potential routes for the rational miniaturized laser design.

3.2.1.2 
              nPV crystals. 
PPV materials play vital roles in the advance of polymer light-emitting diodes5 and polymer lasers.17,18 Correspondingly, their oligomers with different vinylene unit numbers (2PV (28), 3PV (29), 4PV(30)) are also important gain media for crystal lasers.179,180 Among nPV derivatives, trans-distyrylbenzene (DSB/2PV, 28) is the most typical model compound, and has been extensively explored as laser crystals. High efficient deep-blue emission is obtained in its dilute solution. The PLQY decreases sharply with obvious bathochromic shifted emission in solid state due to the formation of H-aggregates.181,182 Over the last few years, a number of distyrylbenzene derivatives (31–37, as shown in Scheme 4) with different substituents have been developed for allowing a unique platform to understand the structure–property relationships and exploring the applications of crystal lasers. In some unique dipole stacking motifs, such as cross dipole stacking (X-aggregate) and head to tail dipole stacking (J-aggregate), the fluorescence quenching could be suppressed and the fluorescence emission in solid state could even be enhanced.183 Spectral features and constants of PLQYs, lifetimes and radiative rates as a result of different DSB stacking systems are depicted in Fig. 8.

The substitutions of benzene with alkyl- and alkoxy-flexible chains, and the positions of benzene in the DSB phenyl units are important ways to achieve high solid-state PLQYs and low ASE thresholds. Kabe et al. reported two different position methyl-substituted DSB derivatives, named as 1,4-bis(4-methylstyryl) benzene (p-MDSB, 31) and 1,4-bis(2-methylstyryl)benzene (o-MDSB, 32).164 PLQYs of 54 ± 1% and 67 ± 1% were achieved for p-MDSB (31) and o-MDSB (32) crystals, respectively. o-MDSB (32) single crystal exhibited an ASE threshold of 14 (±2) μJ cm−2, which is reduced by two orders of magnitude compared with that of DSB (28) (2.2 or 4 mJ cm−2).181,184 Another methyl-substituted DSB (4mDSB, 33) with minimized π–π overlap was reported, in which the electronic structure was only slightly modulated by switching the herringbone stacking to a cofacial motif.184 Compared with the other DSB derivatives, the 4mDSB (33) crystal exhibited a lower ASE threshold (780 μJ cm−2) and a higher gain coefficient of 77 cm−1. The phenyl-substitutes were introduced into the DSB derivatives (PDSB, 34) to decrease the π–π overlap. The induced phenyl bridgeheads could perish the parallel molecular stacking, and formed X-/J-aggregate for high efficiency fluorescence.185 The resulting high quality films in the phenyl substituted DSB derivatives are favorable for the potential applications in OLEDs186 and crystal lasers.187–189 Fu's group tried other methods to build up new DSB crystals. The cyano67 and thiomethyl65 substitutes were added on the terminated benzene, named as CNMODSB (36) and MSMODSB (37), to form J-aggregate or weak H-aggregate. The low-threshold microlasers were achieved by the formation of CNMODSB (36) and MSMODSB (37) nanowires. The lasing thresholds were recorded as 1.09 μJ cm−2 and 0.1 μJ cm−2 for CNMODSB (36) and MSMODSB (37) nanowires, respectively.
DSB derivatives with substituted symmetrical di-cyano units at the vinylene points (DCS) are also remarkable candidates for crystal lasers. Various substituents, such as flexible chain, benzene, and diphenylamine, were selected to develop DCS derivatives.68,190–198 The reported DCS derivatives (38–46) for organic crystal lasers are shown in Scheme 4. The corresponding crystallographic and amplified emission properties are listed in Table 1. Since the substitutions impact largely the intermolecular interactions by secondary interactions including local dipoles and hydrogen bonding, the emission of DCS single crystals in solid state could be effectively adjusted by elaborate modulation of the substitution patterns. Directional non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, π–π interactions, induced crucial impact on the aggregation patterns, and thus significantly affected the ASE/lasing performance.196,197 Yoon et al. reported a range of systematically substituted novel DSB fluorophores with wavelength-tunable emission in the single crystalline state, named as α-MODCS (40), α-MODBDCS, β-MODCS and β-MODBDCS.192 Their chemical structures are depicted in Fig. 9a. All compounds crystallized with different degrees of π–π overlap and distance. The particular secondary bonding interactions, including multiple hydrogen bonds of C–H⋯N and C–H⋯O, donor–acceptor and local dipole interactions, etc., led to fluorescence emission wavelength tuning from blue- to red- spectral region (see Fig. 9a and b). The spectral bathochromic shift was correlative with the increased intermolecular coupling by a systematic transition from a J-type motif (α-MODCS, 40) towards an H-type stacking. In H-type aggregated single crystals (α-MODBDCS, β-MODCS and β-MODBDCS), significant π–π stacking gave rise to the pronounced intermolecular interactions and thus excimeric emission features. Only α-MODCS (40) with J-type aggregate exhibited ASE characteristic during optical pumping process. No spectral narrowing was observed in the H-type aggregated crystals due to the effective intermolecular vibronic coupling (as shown in Fig. 9c).

3.2.1.3 Other crystals. 
Apart from above-mentioned crystal materials, ASE can be observed in several other organic crystals, such as azacyclic crystals, anthracene derivatives, fluorene/phenylene co-oligomers, chalcone derivatives, etc. (Scheme 5). Wang et al. reported a new molecule, named as 4,4′-(thiazole[5,4-d]-thiazole-2,5-diyl)bis(N,N-diphenylaniline) (PTATA, 47).199 Interestingly, by varying the crystal growing conditions, the fluorescence emission of PTATA (47) crystal could be tuned from green to orange. The reason for the different wavelength emission properties is the slight differences in molecular stacking arrangements and crystal shapes, which were introduced by crystal growing conditions. Only green-light-emission PTATA (47) crystal exhibited low ASE thresholds. Additionally, novel bi-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives (BOXD-n, n = 1, 4) were designed by Qu et al.200 The different terminal flexible chains of BOXD-n dominated the molecular self-assembly. The slipped π–π stacking was achieved in BOXD-4 (48) single crystal with J-type aggregate, leading to highly polarized fluorescence and deep-blue ASE with threshold of 200 μJ cm−2 and peak at 403 nm.
 Scheme 5  The crystals in Sections 3.2.1.3 and 3.2.1.4. 
Fluorene and anthracene units are widely used to construct small-molecular, dendritic and polymeric gain media, for thin-film lasers. Due to their likelihoods of high PLQYs, large radiative decay rates, and superior quasi four-level system characteristics, a variety of single crystals (49–57) have been explored as gain media for crystal lasers.201–205 Recently, Kreiza et al. reported one of the lowest ASE threshold (3.5 μJ cm−2) in single crystals, by using two bifluorene compounds, FpF1 (50) and F2pF1 (51), as gain media.201 The low thresholds were ascribed to the negligible influences of photoinduced absorption (PIA) in the gain region, high radiative rates (ca. 1.5 × 109 s−1, along with inherent intramolecular property), and excellent wave-guiding properties of favorable oriented single crystals. By introducing some different bridging groups, such as acetylene, tolane, ethylene, and stilbene, into bifluorene, Baronas et al. synthesized the bifluorene crystals, named as BF-a (52), BF-t (53), BF-e (54), and BF-s (55).205 The rigid bifluorenes bridges enabled enormous increase of radiative decays with high radiative decay rates (ca. 5 × 108 s−1) in these single crystals, which are resulted from enhanced PLQYs (>70%) and short decay lifetimes (<2.5 ns). A rather low ASE threshold of 2.0 μJ cm−2 was achieved in BF-a (52) crystal, which was even lower than that in fluorene-based small-molecule amorphous neat films (see Section 3.2.2.1). The relevant optical data are summarized in Table 2.

Fluorophores with excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) property are important components in constructing long-wavelength organic fluorescent molecules due to their large Stokes-shifted emission. Park et al. reported a novel imidazole-based single crystal, i.e., hydroxy-substituted tetraphenyl imidazole (HPI-Ac, 58) with intense blue fluorescence and ASE.206 The large size (25 mm × 20 mm × 5 mm), well-defined and transparent HIP-Ac (58) single crystals were prepared from its dilute solution. The results showed that the four phenyl substituents on the HIP-Ac (58) imidazole ring limited the intermolecular vibrational coupling and non-radiative transitions, and reduced the possibility of fluorescence quenching by confining the excessively tight π–π stacking. Fluorescence spectral narrowing with threshold of 200 μJ cm−2 was observed in single crystal of HIP-Ac (58). 2′-Hydroxychalcone was selected to build up donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) skeleton, in which the intramolecular H-bond with ESIPT nature enabled its ASE/lasing applications.73,207 2′-Hydroxychalcone derivatives (HDDP-n, n = 1–3, 59–61) displayed relatively high PLQYs (0.25–0.32) with emission peaks above 680 nm.207 Among them, HDDP-1 (59) showed the lowest ASE threshold of 92 μJ cm−2 with NIR stimulated emission with peak at 714 nm. Through fabricating HDDP-1 (59) nanowires and microdisks, the HDDP-1 (59) microcrystals demonstrated shape-dependent resonator properties with the Fabry–Perot mode in 1D nanowire and the WGM resonator in two dimensional (2D) microdisk for lasing oscillation.73 The 2D microdisk of HDDP-1 (59) exhibited lower lasing threshold (0.43 μJ cm−2vs. 1.05 μJ cm−2) and only one high-Q mode (ca. 7500) compared with 1D nanowire of HDDP-1 (59). Expanded π-conjugated systems, 1-hydroxynaphthalen derivatives (DPHP (62) and DMHP (63)), were then explored for nanowire lasers.208,209 Interestingly, the dual-wavelength lasing at the 0–1 and 0–2 vibronic oscillations were also obtained for DMHP (63) nanowires with corresponding peaks at 660 nm and 720 nm.209 The short ONWs with lengths between 5 and 28 μm provided lasing action at the 0–1 vibronic oscillation with peak at 660 nm. For the nanowires with lengths longer than 48 μm with significant self-absorption effect, NIR lasing actions at the 0–2 vibronic oscillation with peak at 720 nm were achieved. Dual-wavelength lasing actions with peaks at 660 nm and 720 nm were obtained for the ONWs with lengths from 30 and 45 μm. Some ESIPT molecules, 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole (HBT, 64)150 and 2-(1,4,5-triphenyl-1H-imidazole-2-yl)phenol (HPI, 65),210 were explored for microcrystal lasing applications, and some other crystals, 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene (TPB, 66) and di(p-methoxyl-phenyl) dibenzofulvene derivative (DPDBF, 67), were reported with ASE and random lasing characteristics.211,212
3.2.1.4 Crystals for TPP lasers. 
Compact upconversion lasers have been extensively studied because of their massive variety of applications in the fields of lithography, optical communication, data storage, etc. TPP lasers can provide frequency-upconversion coherent light with excitation wavelengths in an extensively broad spectral region. TPP lasers in a small quantity of organic material systems were demonstrated in solutions213,214 and films.215,216 Up to now, efficient TPA properties are only reported in a few organic crystals, such as E,E-1,4-bis[4′-(N,N-dibutylamino)styryl]-2,5-dimethoxy-benzene (DBASDSB (35), as shown in Scheme 4),189 MSMODSB (37) (as shown in Scheme 4),217 (N-(4-(4-(4-diphenylamino)styryl)styryl)phenyl)-N-phenyl-benzene amine (αDPADSB (44), as shown in Scheme 4),193 1,4-bis[1-cyano-2-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)vinyl]benzene (αDPADCS (45), as shown in Scheme 4),198 1,4-bis(α-cyano-4-diphenylaminostyryl)-2,5-diphenyl benzene (βDPAPDCS (46), as shown in Scheme 4),218 and 2-(N,N-diethylanilin-4-yl)-4,6-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (DPBT (68), as shown in Scheme 5).90 The relevant optical data are summarized in Table 2. There is an enormous demand to explore novel crystal candidates, which are of low ASE/lasing thresholds and large TPA cross-sections, for high efficiency upconversion lasers.


3.2.2 Amorphous small molecules. 
Fluorescent small-molecular materials with well-defined molecular structures and high purities (i.e., without obvious catalyst residues, side-products, and chemical defects) can be obtained via column chromatography. Due to the small molecular weights (usually less than 1000 Da), the small molecular films can be fabricated by thermal evaporation. By incorporating proper solubilizing side groups, the resulting small molecules are well suited for forming amorphous smooth films by solution process with high uniform optical and waveguide properties.
In this section, traditional fluorescent small-molecular gain media will be discussed at length. The material design strategies for small-molecular gain media, which could reduce the effect of quenching, are summarized, such as functionalizing with branched chains and sterically demanding substitutions, constructing D–π–A architectures, etc. The triplet small-molecular gain media will be discussed in Section 3.3.
3.2.2.1 Fluorescent small molecules based on fluorene. 
Fluorene is a common fluorescent building block, which is easily functionalized with functional units and solubilizing groups by cross-coupling reactions, and thus reproduce a variety of fluorene-based molecules. Fluorenes are generally powders, even with alkyl chains functionalized at the 9,9′-position. Fluorene derivatives substituted with double branched long alkyl groups may exhibit viscous liquid-state and crystallize slowly. Fluorene homologues functionalized with siloxane groups (DF-SiO and TF-SiO) (69 and 70) were obtained as liquid oils. ASE thresholds of 1.4 μJ cm−2 and 22 μJ cm−2 were demonstrated in these fluorene dimers and trimers, respectively.219 The nonvolatile liquid-state fluorene derivatives exhibited hole mobilities less than 1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable with other glassy fluorene derivatives. On the other hand, with the increase of π-conjugated fluorene skeletons, the alkyl-functionalized oligofluorenes could act as solid-state gain media. Choi et al. reported a series of linear oligofluorenes with hexyl chains functionalized at each C9 position of fluorene units (the numbers of fluorene unit are 3, 5, and 7, named as TerF (71), PentaF (72), and HeptaF (73), respectively).220 The ASE thresholds measured in nitrogen environment were 1.3, 1.2, and 0.4 μJ cm−2 for TerF (71), PentaF (72), and HeptaF (73), respectively. TerF (71) film didn’t exhibit any ASE characteristic with excitation densities lower than 12 μJ cm−2 under ambient conditions. Typical ASE thresholds measured in air were 5 μJ cm−2 and 8 μJ cm−2 for PentaF (72) and HeptaF (73), respectively. High ASE thresholds and fast optical degradations under ambient conditions indicated the significant oxygen-induced fluorescent quenching (or degradation) in alkyl-functionalized oligofluorenes. Then, liquid 9-(2-ethylhexyl) carbazole was selected as a host and doped with HeptaF (73). Relatively efficient lasers were achieved by spreading the nonvolatile emitter blend on substrate containing DFB gratings. For a blend with 10 wt% HeptaF (73), the lasing threshold as low as 2 μJ cm−2 was demonstrated even for a laser repetition rate of 4 MHz, indicating the potential quasi-CW lasing applications.221
A pervasive method to improve ASE stability is dispersing small-molecular oligofluorenes in PS or PMMA. Kazlauskas et al. reported ASE properties and photostabilities of fluorene- and benzofluorene-cored oligomers (BF-Et (74), BF-Hex (75), F-Et (76) and F-Hex (77)) in organic matrices.222 The ASE thresholds were much lower in blended films (in PS) than those measured in oligomer neat films. The ASE photostability half-lifetimes (τASE1/2) of the blended samples were up to 104 pulses, much longer than those of the neat films. Another method to improve the stability of fluorene-based gain media is to incorporate C9-substituted alkyl pendant groups onto the fluorene unit or introduce spiro unit into the molecular architectures.
Ter(9,9-diarylfluorene)s (TDAFs, 79, 81, 82) are promising gain media with high glass transition temperature (>200 °C), excellent morphological, electrochemical and thermal stability, high PLQY, and excellent OLED performance due to the ambipolar transport with high hole and electron mobilities.223–225 Among them, TDAF-1 (79), with methylbenzene substituents on the C9 positions, has been extensively studied. Vacuum-deposited films became optically isotropic after annealing. As a result, the ASE threshold after annealing was higher than that of as-deposited film (14 μJ cm−2vs. 7 μJ cm−2).53 With a pump energy of 300 μJ cm−2, a gain coefficiency of 78 cm−1 was achieved for the as-deposited film; while after annealing, the net gain values became intrinsically lower with 15–30 cm−1 under the same laser energy densities. By using the same method (annealing the films), the DFB lasing wavelengths were adjusted from 447.2 nm to 430.5 nm with the grating period of 280 nm.226 Oyamada et al. reported ASE performance of bi(9,9-diarylfluorene)s (BDAFs) and other TDAFs.227 The chemical structures of BDAF-1/2 (78 and 80) and TDAF-2/3 (81 and 82) are depicted in Scheme 6. The optical and ASE results are summarized in Table 3. All of them showed inferior ASE performance compared with that of TDAF-1 (79) in the same excitation lasing system.

Pyrene was introduced to construct new organic gain media. Lai et al. reported pyrenyl-capped benzofiurene derivatives as gain media. Pyrenyl-capped benzofiurene was selected as molecular skeleton, and functionalized with different flexible alkyl chains on diaryl groups at each C9 position of fluorene units.228,229 The selected pyrenyl-capped benzofiurene derivatives (PFP-n, n = 1–3) (83–85) are shown in Scheme 6. PFP-3 (85), with phosphonate polar pendant groups at C9 position of the fluorene units, exhibited blue-shifted emission and much higher ASE thresholds, compared with that recorded from PFP-1 (83) and PFP-2 (84). PFP-1 (83) was selected to further investigate the lasing performance due to its higher PLQY, lower ASE threshold, and better photoelectrical property. By varying the film thicknesses, the lasing wavelength could be tuned within a range of 16 nm (from 456 nm to 472 nm) in the blue spectral region. The lowest lasing threshold of 1.4 μJ cm−2 was obtained with lasing peak at 456 nm.
The spiro concept, based on the connection of two molecular π-systems through a sp3-hybridized carbon atom with equal or different functions, has been used in the design of organic gain media. The use of such a linkage has been demonstrated to effectively depress the excimer formation and the ketonic defects, increase the thermal and spectral stabilities, and thus strongly enhance PLQYs and ASE/lasing properties. Due to the facile functionalization at C-2, C-7, C-10, and C-15 positions of spirobifluorene unit, various spiro-functional materials, including small molecules (as discussed in this section and shown in Scheme 7), dendrimers (see Section 3.2.3.3), and polymers (see Section 3.2.4.1), have been explored for lasing applications.
 Scheme 7  Spirobifluorene molecules as gain media. 
For example, Spehr et al. reported the lasing performance based on an active gain medium, spiro-terphenyl (Sp-TP, 86), in a second-order DFB structure.230 Sp-TP (86) showed ASE in the UV spectral region with emission peak at 381 nm. With DFB grating periods from 200 nm to 230 nm, the lasing wavelengths of thin-film devices were operated in a range of more than 30 nm between 362 nm and 394 nm. The minimum threshold of 8.9 μJ cm−2 with peak at 383 nm was achieved under optical pumping. By increasing the π-conjugated system (e.g., adding the phenyl numbers for Sp-HBP (87)) or linking acceptor units (e.g., linking oxadiazole for SP-SPO (88)), the ASE/lasing spectra of spirobifluorene molecules showed bathochromic shifts to the blue spectral region.231,232
Spirobifluorene molecules linked with donor or acceptor groups were studied as small molecular gain media. Donor units, such as diphenylamine or carbazole units, were usually used to construct donor–π–donor structures. The film of carbazole-functionalized spirobifluorene, named as Sp-Cz (89), showed an ASE threshold of 25 μJ cm−2 with emission peak at 396 nm.233 Molecular extension with phenylene–vinylene groups (Sp-SBCz, 90) increased the π-conjugated system, resulting in bathochromic-shifted amplification with a much lower threshold of 0.43 μJ cm−2. When doped into CBP host, the Sp-SBCz (90) blend film exhibited an ASE threshold down to 0.11 μJ cm−2, which represented one of the lowest ASE thresholds for organic emitters by far. More rotational freedom could be provided for the individual phenyl rings when the end-capped carbazole units are replaced by diphenylamine groups. The respective diphenylamine-functionalized spirobifluorene is Sp-DPA (93). The stimulated emission wavelength (at 452 nm) of Sp-DPA (93) showed a red shift compared with the ASE peak of Sp-BCz (92).234 The end-capped with diphenylamine phenylene-vinylene extended spiro-bifluorene (Sp-SDPA, 91) showed an ASE threshold of 2 μJ cm−2.234
3.2.2.2 Ladder-type oligo(p-phenylene)s and carbon-bridged oligo (p-phenylenevinylene)s (COPVs). 
Ladder-type poly(p-phenylene)s (LPPP) is a vital series of polymeric material system for OSLs, which will be discussed separately in polymer gain media part (see Section 3.2.4.2). Ladder-type oligo(p-phenylene)s also have been explored as gain media most recently. Lai et al. reported a novel set of D–π–A ladder-type oligo(p-phenylene)s with functional end-cappers of diphenyl-amino (donor) and fluorophenyl/fluorine (acceptor) units, named as nL-F (94, 96, 98) and nLPh-F (95, 97, 99) (n = 2–4), as gain media for lasing applications.235 The ASE thresholds decreased with the extension of the π-conjugated system for end-capper functionalized oligo(p-phenylene)s. In 4LPh-F (99) film with the largest π-conjugated system, relatively low ASE threshold of 1.97 μJ cm−2 was recorded. Excellent optical waveguiding properties with gain coefficient higher than 90 cm−1 and loss coefficient lower than 2.0 cm−1 were also demonstrated in 4LPh-F (99) film. 4LPh-F (99) showed good photothermal stability, and ASE could still be detectable even up to 280 °C. Lasing thresholds of 2.2 μJ cm−2 and 0.5 μJ cm−2 with corresponding peaks at 460 nm and 471 nm were demonstrated in 1D DFB lasers using 4L-F (98) and 4LPh-F (99) as gain media, respectively. Carbazole was also explored as end-capper in linear ladder-type oligo(p-phenylene)s, named as 4L-Cz (100), as a deep-blue gain medium.236 Blue ASE with a low ASE threshold of 0.53 μJ cm−2 and emission peak at 446 nm was demonstrated in 4L-Cz (100) film. A high gain value of 82 cm−1 and a low loss value of 3.9 cm−1 were recorded. The best 1D DFB laser device showed a threshold of 0.17 μJ cm−2 with lasing slope efficiency up to 5.9%. A lasing wavelength tunable window of 19 nm was achieved in the blue spectral region.
COPVs is another interesting type of all carbon skeleton materials. The synthetic method was firstly reported by Zhu et al. in 2009.237 The chemical structures of COPV-n (101–106) (n = 1–6) are shown in Scheme 8. As illustrated in Fig. 10a and b for COPV4 (104), the planar π-conjugated molecular skeleton was sterically protected from aggregation and degradation by incorporating bulky p-octylphenyl units, which also enabled good miscibilities with organic solid matrixes and good solubilities in organic solvents. The absorption spectra of COPV-n (101–106) showed obvious bathochromic shifts with the increase of the π-conjugated system, indicating the effective conjugations of COPV-n (101–106) have significantly increased in this process (Fig. 10c).238 The slope efficiency between energy bandgap and the reciprocal number of repeating units (1/n) was 1.76, much higher than that recorded in ladder-type oligo(p-phenylene)s239 and oligofluorenes.240 Very broad fluorescence emission range was observed in COPV-n (101–106) with different numbers of repeating units (n) (Fig. 10d). By fabricating DFB lasers, single mode lasing of COPV-n (101–106) doped in PS film exhibited remarkably low thresholds (7 μJ cm−2), tunable wavelength from deep-blue- to red-spectral region (408–591 nm) and long operational lifetimes (>3 × 105 pump pulses for oligomers with three to six repeating units) (Fig. 10e and f).241

3.2.2.3 Phenylamine and benzocarbazole derivatives. 
Triphenyldiamines, which are well-known as hole-transporting materials, have been widely used as one of the functional layers in OLEDs and OSCs. Also as an individual, triphenyldiamine is a fluorescent material with deep-blue emission. N,N′-Bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine (TPD, 107) is a well-studied triphenyldiamine derivative. When mixed TPD (107) into PS matrix with concentrations from 2.1 wt% to 70 wt%, the doped films showed tunable ASE spectra between 413 and 421 nm.242 A net gain value of 16 cm−1 was recorded for 20 wt% TPD-doped film. Spin-coated onto a DFB grating resonator with grating period of 270 nm, the 30 wt% TPD-doped film emitted lasing at 418 nm when the pumping energy density was above 537 μJ cm−2 (6 μJ per pulse).243 Other TPDs, including 1,4-bis(diphenylamino)biphenyl (DPABP, 108), N,N′-bis(3-methyl-phenyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-[1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′-diamine (BMT-TPD, 109), N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′′-diamine (NPB, 110), and N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-[1,1′:4′,1′′:4′′,1′′′-quaterphenyl]-4,4′′′-diamine (BMQ-TPD, 111) (Scheme 9), were explored as doped gain media by Ma et al.244,245 Among them, BMQ-TPD (111) showed the lowest ASE threshold (42 μJ cm−2), while there was no evidence of ASE in NPB (110) doped film. Molecular geometries were calculated to simulate the four-level system in these molecules. A series of energy sublevels were estimated in NPB (110) from various elongated low-frequency modes between 11 cm−1 and 689 cm−1 deriving from naphthyl unit, which are adverse to the construction of four-level system. For comparison, the strong elongated high-frequency modes from 1199 cm−1 to 1664 cm−1 deriving from benzene unit in TPD (107), DPABP (108), BMT-TPD (109), and BMQ-TPD (111) contributed to the evident vibronic band in the fluorescent emission, indicating an efficient four-level system for stimulated emission.
 Scheme 9  Phenylamine and benzocarbarzole derivatives. 
Triarylamine is mainly used as an electron-donating unit in the applications of OLEDs and OSCs. By linking various electron-withdrawing groups onto the triphenylamino core, multi-color emission from blue to red were observed through the combination of inter-branch electronic energy transfer and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).246 4-di(4′-tert-butylbiphenyl-4-yl)amino-4′-dicyano-vinyl-benzene (FVIN, 112), coupled to the triphenylamino core with dicyanovinyl units, was used as red-emitting organic gain medium.247 The non-doped FVIN (112) film exhibited an ASE threshold as low as 22 μJ cm−2 and an optical gain of 50 cm−1, indicating tremendously reduced quenching effects in comparison with classical dyes such as rhodamine 6G and DCM. Lasing in the red region at 647 nm with a threshold of 60 μJ cm−2 was obtained with a patterning DBR resonator. Triarylamine linked with other units, such as ethene-diyldibenzene, vinyl-carbazole, vinylquinoline, and vinylnaphthalene, named as SBD-n (113–117) (n = 1–5), were reported with ASE phenomena using CBP as the host in the guest–host system. The chemical structures of SBD-n (113–117) (n = 1–5) are depicted in Scheme 9, and the ASE properties are summarized in Table 3.248
CBP (118) is one of the most studied bipolar hosts in OLEDs and guest–host gain systems. The UV ASE were investigated by using CBP and its derivatives, 4,4′-bis(3-methylcarbazol-9-yl)-2,2′-biphenyl (mCBP, 119) and 4,4′-bis(3,6-dimethyl-carbazol-9-yl)-2,2′-biphenyl (dCBP, 120), as the emitters.249 For undoped CBP (118) films, ASE at 394 nm was observed with a threshold of 1.3 μJ cm−2. The red shifted ASE spectra centered at 401 nm and 406 nm were demonstrated in mCBP (119) and dCBP (120) films, with the corresponding thresholds of 1.7 μJ cm−2 and 1.5 μJ cm−2. The neat gains were strongly dependent on their chemical structures. CBP (118), mCBP (119), and dCBP (120) exhibited gain values of 13, 4.0, and 7.8 cm−1, respectively.
Bis-styrylbenzene derivatives are interesting laser materials as crystal gain media. The ASE characteristics of a series of bis-styrylbenzene derivatives end-capped with triarylamine and benzocarbazole (BSB-n, n = 1–3, and BSBCz, 121–124) doped into CBP host were reported by Adachi's group.248 Among them, the 6 wt% doped BSBCz (124) film demonstrated the lowest ASE threshold of 0.32 μJ cm−2. Since then, BSBCz (124) was used in quasi-CW operation of OSLs, due to its very high PLQY (nearly 100%), extremely weak population of triplet excitons via intersystem crossing, and inappreciable excited-state absorption in the lasing region.250,251 Recently, Adachi et al. reported the low-threshold quasi-CW DFB lasers (based on doped BSBCz (124) film) operating under long-pulse width of 30 ms as well as pulse repetition rate up to 80 MHz.21 CBP was used as host in the guest–host system. As shown in Fig. 11a, in order to greatly improve the DFB laser stabilities and efficiencies operating in the quasi-CW regimes, CYTOP was spin-coated onto the organic layers to encapsulate the devices. Mixed-order DFB grating was fabricated to provide a sufficient out-coupling of the laser radiation (Fig. 11b). Fig. 11c and d show the images of lasing oscillations in the encapsulated blended mixed-order DFB laser device under different pulse repetition rates captured by streak camera. The encapsulated blended mixed-order DFB laser device held the lowest thresholds (from 0.06 μJ cm−2 to 0.25 μJ cm−2) under the pulse repetition rate varying from 10 kHz to 80 MHz, and was the only live device after operating at 80 MHz (Fig. 11e). With the same tendency, a reduced lasing threshold was also observed in the encapsulated blended mixed-order DFB laser device in the quasi-CW regime at long-pulse photoexcitations (Fig. 11f and g). As shown in Fig. 11h, the ultra-high energy-induced thermal degradation of active layer led to the irreversible decreased laser intensity during operation in all devices. Noticeably, the device lifetime was greatly enhanced by encapsulation. Only 3% emission intensity decreased after 500 pulses (pulse width: 100 μs) in the encapsulated blended device. This work represented an important breakthrough toward the realization of organic solid-state CW laser technology.

Based on the same gain medium, an electrically pumped organic laser was reported by Adachi's group in 2019, which will be discussed further in Section 4.23
3.2.2.4 Thiophene-based small molecules. 
In Section 3.2.1, we have introduced the oligothiophene and TPCO crystals for lasing. Some thiophene-based amorphous small molecules were also reported as gain media (Scheme 10). For example, Huang et al. reported a novel material (DTBT, 125) based on the core of dithienylbenzothiadiazole and the end-cappers of 3,5-bis(1-naphthyl)-phenyl.252 DTBT (125) film exhibited ASE characteristics with a threshold of 380 μJ cm−2 and emission peak at 644 nm. DFB laser devices were fabricated by spin-coating DTBT (125) onto the grating with period of 410 nm. By varying the spin-coated film thicknesses from 410 nm to 560 nm, a lasing wavelength tunable window of 15 nm was present with the lowest lasing threshold of 118 μJ cm−2 (at 650 nm).
 Scheme 10  Thiophene-based small molecules. 
Fused thiophenes, for example, pentathienoacenes (PTA), are interesting for various applications due to the combination of the rigid planarity from acenes and the chemical stability from oligothiophenes in their chemical structures. Incorporating three PTA derivatives (PTA-1/2/3) (126–128) into host matrix PS with concentration of 10%, the doped films exhibited ASE thresholds of 100, 240 and 750 μJ cm−2 for PTA-1 (126), PTA-2 (127), and PTA-3 (128), respectively. Alternatively, guest–host gain systems were built up with incorporating PTA-2 (127) and PTA-3 (128) as guest and PTA-1 (126) as host, which yielded lower ASE thresholds than that in PS host by facilitating energy transfer from host to guest. In this way, ASE threshold of 370 μJ cm−2 with emission peak at 573 nm was observed for PTA-3 (128).253
3.2.2.5 Perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives. 
Perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives are mainly studied for OTFTs and OSCs, due to their facile chemical structure tunabilities, excellent thermal stabilities and optical stabilities, and strong electron acceptabilities.254–256 High fluorescent efficiencies (nearly 100%) of PDI monomers in dilute solution enable their applications in single molecule spectroscopy, optical sensing, and lasing. Nonetheless, in solid state, the strong π–π intermolecular interactions give rise to the formation of cofacially stacked H-aggregates in PDI molecules, quenching fluorescence emission unfavorably and strongly.257 The crystallization of PDI molecules is depressed by attaching alkyl or other bulky substituted groups, accompanying with the increased fluorescent efficiencies. PDI monomers are functionalized with various alkyl and aryl flexible solubilizing chains, e.g., PDI-C6, PDI-o, and b-PDI-C8 (129–131, Scheme 11).258–260 Incorporating N,N′-di-(1-hexylheptyl)perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI-C6, 129) into PS matrix with concentrations from 0.5 to 5 wt%, stimulated emission was determined with the optimized threshold as low as 120 μJ cm−2 at concentration of 0.5 wt% of PDI-C6 (129) in the matrix.260 The doped film onto DFB resonator manifested a lasing threshold of 160 μJ cm−2.259 The laser showed an operation lifetime of 3.1 × 105 pump pulses (more than 8 h) with pumped energy of 2.2-fold lasing threshold and pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz. The lasing characteristics of PDI-o (130) and b-PDI-C8 (131) are listed in Table 3.
 Scheme 11  Perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives. 
In another study, WGM hexagonal microdisk microcavity and nanowire of PDI molecules, named as N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-2,5,8,11-tetrakis(p-methyl-phenyl)-perylenediimide (mp-PDI-1, 132) and N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-2,5,8,11-tetrakis(o-methylphenyl)-perylene-3,4:9,10-tetraarboxylic acid diimide (mp-PDI-2, 133), were obtained via the reprecipitation method and solution self-assembly method.69,91 The hexagonal WGM microdisk of mp-PDI-1 (132) exhibited a PLQY of ca. 15%, a fast fluorescence decay time (ca. 0.05 ns), and a lasing threshold around 10.8 μJ cm−2.
3.2.2.6 Other small-molecular gain media. 
Like organic crystals, anthracene was studied as gain media for lasing applications.14,15 Since the first report on the high fluorescent efficiency and outstanding stability of 9,10-di-(2-naphthyl)anthracene,261 there are intense interests in exploring novel anthracene derivatives as promising candidates with deep-blue emission for OLEDs.262–264 Niu et al. reported two asymmetric 9,10-disubstituted anthracene molecules, named as An-Cz-1 and An-Cz-2 (134 and 135), as thin-film gain media.265 The molecular difference between An-Cz-1 (134) and An-Cz-2 (135) was the different units substituted on the anthracene 9-position, which are 3,5-bis(4-t-butylphenyl) phenyl and 3,5-bis(2,4-difluorophenyl) phenyl, respectively. An-Cz-1 (134) exhibited a lower ASE threshold (46.9 μJ cm−2vs. 68.8 μJ cm−2) and a higher gain value (23 cm−1vs. 19 cm−1) relative to An-Cz-2 (135). 1D DFB lasers of An-Cz-1 (134) with a minimum lasing threshold of 17.7 μJ cm−2 and a corresponding slope efficiency of 3.6% were achieved.
The ASE and lasing phenomena could be observed from oligophenylenes (p-nP) as crystals (see Section 3.2.1.1). But there was no gain-narrowing and light amplification even pumped with a high enough energy in p-nP thin films.266 Introducing peripheral naphthyl units onto the oligophenyls (npN, N = 1–3, 136–138) caused obvious sterical dimensions, weakened intermolecular interactions and suppressed π–π stacking. The amorphous 3pN–5pN (136–138) films showed PLQY values between 22% and 35%, manifesting common ASE performance.266
Generally, due to the notorious generation of excimers and exciplexes, most chromophores endure aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) in solid state, even with high fluorescence efficiency in dilute solution. An inverse effect known as aggregation-induced emission (AIE) was reported by Tang and co-workers in 2001.267 Since then, the research of organic fluorophors with AIE characteristics becomes a hot topic.268 AIE molecules as the emitters generally exhibit bright emission. Cheng et al. reported a UV lasing from tetraphenylethylene (TPE, 139), which was a famous and easily functionalized AIE fluorogen, doped in PMMA polymer nanowires.269 The polymer nanowires were fabricated by template wetting in the anodic aluminum oxide channels. Output lasing at 372 nm from individual nanowire with threshold of 55 mJ cm−2 was observed at 10 K. Another AIE molecule, named as 2,5,2′,5′-tetrakis(2,2-diphenylvinyl)biphenyl (TDPVBi, 140), also shows distinct ASE behavior.270 TDPVBi (140) film fabricated by vacuum-depositing process showed high PLQY (80%) and an ASE threshold of 60 μJ cm−2. These works suggest the possibility of AIE molecules for lasing applications.
Some other molecules, such as diarylboron diketonates (DBDK-1 and DBDK-2, 141 and 142)271 and dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene (DBO, 143),272 were reported with ASE phenomena. The chemical structures of DBDK-1 (141), DBDK-2 (142), and DBO (143) are depicted in Scheme 12. The optical characteristics are summarized in Table 3.

3.2.3 Dendritic starburst molecules. 
Dendritic starbursts are an important category of organic gain media, which are usually constituted by a central core and multiple functionalized π-conjugated arms. Combining the merits of small molecules and polymers, dendritic starburst molecules contribute to organic optoelectronics with well-defined molecular structures, good film-forming characteristics, excellent thermal- and optical-stabilities, and thus outstanding optoelectronic properties. The suppressed aggregates and self-quenching induced by the highly branched arms enable dendritic starburst molecules as promising candidates for OSLs. In the past decade, several reviews have comprehensively summarized dendritic starburst molecules and their applications for organic electronics and photonics.273–276 The recent advances in organic synthetic technologies make it possible to design and synthesize novel materials with bulky structures and complex branches, achieving excellent functional characteristics like well-defined small molecules and high-molecular-weight polymers. In this part, we confine the discussion on the recent reported starburst molecules as organic gain media and their lasing characteristics.
3.2.3.1 Oligofluorenes. 
PFO is an important commercial polymer, which has been widely used in laser physics, and regarded as the benchmark for organic gain media (see Section 3.2.4.1). Correspondingly, the fluorene oligomers, especially starburst oligofluorenes, also form an important class of organic gain media.
In 2007, Burn's group reported a series of bisfluorene-cored dendrimers for lasing applications.277,278 Different dendrimers are formed by attaching biphenyl (BP), biphenylcarbazole (BPCz), and E-stilbenyl (ESB) onto the bisfluorene core, named as BP-1 (144), BPCz (146), and ESB (147), respectively. The ASE peak occurred at 431 nm in BPCz (146), exhibiting a redshift emission compared with BP-1 (144) and ESB (147). The BP-1 (144) presented the lowest threshold with a value of 16 μJ cm−2 and the highest gain of 51 cm−1.278 With the development from the first generation (BP-1, 144) to the second generation (BP-2, 145), a rise in PLQY from 42% to 75% was observed. By using etched silica substrates DFB grating, BP-2 (145) exhibited an improvement in lasing performance compared with BP-1 (144). BP-1 (144) showed a lasing threshold of 90 nJ per pulse and a slope efficiency of 0.3%; while BP-2 (145) laser had a half lower threshold and more than 5-times higher slope efficiency. By using a soft lithographic technique called as solvent assisted micromoulding (SAMIM), a micromoulded BP-2 (145) laser with a very high slope efficiency of 14% could be achieved.277 In addition, a series of H-shaped oligofluorenes, bearing one rigid arm of diarylfluorenes and another arm of trifluorene with alkyl chains, have been developed in Huang's group.279 The H-shaped hybrid oligomers linking trifluorene, carbazole, and diarylfluorene groups, i.e., H– (148), H–CF3 (149) and H–Ph (150), exhibited very low ASE thresholds (Table 4) and excellent thermal stabilities. The ASE thresholds of samples increased by less than 3-fold annealing up to 200 °C under ambient conditions. An only 5.6-fold threshold increase with annealing temperature up to 250 °C was recorded for H–F (148). The key data of DFB lasers are listed in Table 4.

Traditional starburst oligofluorenes usually contain a central core and multiple functionalized arms of oligofluorenes. Various cores, such as benzene,280 truxene,12,281,282 pyrene,47 and 1,4-diketo-2,3,5,6-tetraphenyl-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP),283 have been used to construct a variety of starburst oligofluorenes (151–166) as organic gain media. The selection of central cores is important to construct dendritic architectures. For example, as three overlapped fluorene fragments, truxene provide an alternative core structure to construct 2D starburst oligofluorenes (154–156). The oligomers consisting of the central truxene core and oligofluorene arms could be virtually considered as uniform starburst oligofluorenes with homogeneous fluorene units.240,284,285 Some other cores, such as triazatruxene,286 triphenylamine,287 pyrene,47 and DPP,283 which act as electron donors or acceptors, could strongly modulate the spectral and electrical properties of oligofluorenes arms. It should be noted that pyrene-cored starbursts or pyrene-capped starbursts were reported as attractive gain media because of the high PLQY, excellent thermal stability, and high charge carrier mobility of pyrene unit. The details will be discussed separately in the next section. In this section, we discuss the construction of a series of pyrene-cored gain media system by ICT through the oligofluorenes arms to pyrene core.
Three-arms oligofluorenes based on benzene and truxene were explored as gain media by Skabara and coworkers.280–282 The three-arms oligofluorenes materials based on benzene (B2, B3 and B4, 151–153) and truxene (T3 and T4, 154 and 155) are shown in Scheme 13. The truxene dendrimers exhibited lower ASE thresholds (T3 = 8.4 μJ cm−2, T4 = 16 μJ cm−2) compared with the benzene-cored dendritic oligofluorenes (B3 and B4 = 18 μJ cm−2). The truxene dendrimers exhibited high PLQYs in solid state (78–87%); while the benzene-cored counterparts showed the values ranging from 36% to 86%. Among them, T3 (154) exhibited the highest optical gain of 38 cm−1 (Table 4), which was only half of PFO gain value (74 cm−1).49 The combination of these two family materials allowed for broad wavelength tuning of 70 nm (402–473 nm) in the deep-blue spectral part for the DFB lasers. Interestingly, pure T3 (154) material achieved very broad lasing spectra (51 nm) from the 1D and 2D DFB lasers with a range of film thicknesses. The lowest lasing threshold was 2.06 μJ cm−2 for DFB T3 (154) lasers.281 Six-substituted truxene-based oligomers (Tr6-n, n = 1–4) demonstrated highly efficient blue emission (0.50–0.90) in the solid state. In these six-substituted oligomers, the enhanced steric hindrance between the arms and core and the consequently low π-conjugated degree led to blue-shifted absorption and emission, as compared with the three-armed analogues.12,240,288 Low-threshold 1D DFB lasers (1.3 μJ cm−2) with tunable wavelengths from 421 nm to 443 nm were demonstrated for the resulting starburst oligomers Tr6-3 (156).12
 Scheme 13  Dendritic starburst molecular structures based on oligofluorenes. 
In the electron donor/acceptor cored dendritic starburst systems, the absorbed energy can be transferred from the arms, which act as absorbing antennas, to the core through ICT. The typical examples were sky-blue multi-armed molecules based on pyrene as core and oligofluorenes as arms (Py-2 and Py-3, 157 and 158, Scheme 13).47,289 The sufficient spectral overlap between the absorption of pyrene core and the emission of oligofluorene arms facilitates energy transfer to the central pyrene core efficiently. Both Py-2 (157) and Py-3 (158) showed very high solid PLQYs (>90%), low ASE thresholds (Py-2: 1.75 μJ cm−2; Py-3: 1.78 μJ cm−2), relatively high gain values (75–78 cm−2), and excellent lasing performances. ASE thermal stabilities were measured to evaluate the gain properties of Py-2 (157) and Py-3 (158) at high working temperature. For Py-3 (158), the ASE threshold still kept at a low level even heated up to 200 °C. The ASE thermal stabilities of Py-2 (157) and Py-3 (158) were much better than that of their polymer counterpart, PFO, mainly due to the stable glassy structures and relatively stable amorphous rubber-like structures formed upon increasing the heating temperature. 1D DFB grating lasers were achieved with lasing thresholds down to 0.16 μJ cm−2, lasing slope efficiencies up to 3.9%, and ca. 40 nm wavelength tuning in the blue- and sky-blue-spectral region. Impressively, the non-encapsulated devices survived even operating at 10-times threshold energy with more than 1.1 × 105 pulses operation lifetime. Another reported type of dendritic starburst gain media through ICT was the functionalized starburst molecules based on DPP core with four oligofluorene arms (DPP-star, 159, as shown in Scheme 13).283 Different from the fully π-conjugated system in pyrene-cored starbursts (Py-2 and Py-3, 157 and 158), the DPP-star (159) had a π-conjugated axis and a non-conjugated axis. To understand the effects of conjugated pathway, linear molecules with DPP unit as the central core in the conjugated orientation (linear-DPP-c, 160, as shown in Scheme 13) and the non-conjugated orientation (linear-DPP-nc) were synthesized and investigated as well. DPP-star (159) and linear molecules exhibited PLQYs lower than 6% when excited at the oligofluorene absorption bands; while a PLQY up to 20% was achieved when excited in DPP-core absorbed spectral region. The insufficient spectral (and energetic) overlap between the absorption of DPP core and the emission of oligofluorenes arms led to a rather unsuccessful energy transfer from the oligofluorenes arms to the DPP core. DPP-star (159) molecule didn’t exhibited the presence of ASE; while spectral narrowing was observed for linear-DPP-c (160), in particular pumping DPP core directly. The ASE thresholds are 106 μJ cm−2 excited at 355 nm (pumping the oligofluorenes arms) and 42 μJ cm−2 excited at 532 nm (pumping the DPP core). Triazatruxene, an electron-rich unit, was also used as the core skeleton to construct three or six armed oligofluorenes (TAT-2, TAT-3, TAT6-2, TAT6-3, 161–164).286,290 Compared with the corresponding truxene-cored counterparts (T-n and Tr6-n), TAT-n (n = 2 and 3, 161 and 162) and TAT6-n (n = 2 and 3, 163 and 164) exhibited nearly 30 nm bathochromic shifts of the fluorescence spectra, suggesting ICT occurred between the arms and the core. Levermore et al. reported the ASE performance of triazatruxene-cored oligofluorenes.291 The six-armed oligofluorenes (TAT6-2 and TAT6-3, 163 and 164) exhibited low ASE thresholds (≤5 μJ cm−2), and ordinary gain values (around 25 cm−1).
Recently, Lai et al. reported a novel donor–acceptor core for dendritic starburst design, in which triazine with electron-withdrawing nature and favorable electron-transporting ability was selected as the center, and carbazole and diphenylamine units with electron-donating nature were attached onto the triazine center to modulate the electrical properties by the construction of heterogeneous donor–acceptor core structure.292–294 Different π-conjugated oligofluorenes were again selected as the arms to construct dendritic starbursts, named as TF-1 (165) and TF-2 (166). The chemical structures of TF-1 (165) and TF-2 (166) are shown in Scheme 13. The six-branched TF-1 and TF-2 exhibited fluorescence emission in deep-blue region with PLQYs over 40%. The ASE thresholds of TF-1 (165) and TF-2 (166) samples were recorded as 4.3 μJ cm−2 and 10.3 μJ cm−2, respectively. Remarkably, TF-1 (165) and TF-2 (166) manifested enhanced ASE stabilities without significant spectral shifts (within 2 nm for TF-1 (165) and 1 nm for TF-2 (166)) and obvious changed ASE thresholds annealing up to 200 °C in air.
3.2.3.2 Starbursts with pyrene as the central core and/or the end-cappers. 
Owing to high PLQY, excellent thermal stability, and high charge carrier mobility of pyrene, pyrene derivatives have attracted much interests.295 Pyrene derivatives with large steric hindrance have been demonstrated as optional candidates for lasing applications. Generally, planar pyrene molecules in solid state tend to form π–π stacking and excimers, accompanying with red-shifted emission and reduced fluorescent efficiencies. The likelihood of pyrene aggregation can be reduced by the introduction of bulky groups and/or constructing dendritic starburst structures. In this section, we introduce the recently reported pyrene-cored or pyrene-capped dendritic conjugated starbursts as efficient emitters for OSSLs.
In 2010, Uchimura et al. developed a series of star-shaped molecules using pyrene as the central core and benzene, diphenyl, terphenyl or anthracene units as the substituted arms, named as PyP-n (n = 1–4) (167–170) and PyA-m (m = 1, 2) (171 and 172).296 By doping these pyrene derivatives into cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), DFB lasers were constructed. In this study, the chain lengths [–(CH2)n–] of the alkyl groups were fixed at n = 6 and 7, which ensured good solubilities and ordered films in CLCs to achieve CLC DFB lasers. Interestingly, the resulting lasing thresholds were very different. Taken PyP-3 (169) and PyP-4 (170) as examples, a lasing threshold of PyP-4 (170) was recorded of 245 μJ cm−2, but the lasing signal of PyP-3 (169) could not be detected under the same optical density (OD, OD = 0.16). Due to its better solubility, PyP-4 (170) could achieve lower threshold for CLC lasers (Eth = 43.3 μJ cm−2) with much higher OD (OD = 1). The corresponding data are summarized in Table 4. This work indicated that the flexible chains could play a crucial role in the design of organic gain media, coinciding with our previous work.228 Triazatruxene was also introduced to link the planar pyrene core at 1,6- and 1,3,6,8-positions (Py-2TAT, and Py-4TAT, 173 and 174) to construct monodisperse starburst architectures.297 Compared with the reference linear counterpart (Py-2TAT, 173), Py-4TAT (174) showed a much higher PLQY (66% to 16%) resulted from the steric starburst molecular structure. But Py-4TAT (174) exhibited inferior ASE/lasing properties, mainly due to the detrimental ICT between pyrene core and four triazatruxene substituents.
In Section 3.2.3.1, pyrene-cored starburst oligofluorenes (Py-n, 157 and 158) were introduced as gain media, which had relatively excellent hole-injection abilities (the highest occupied molecular orbital, HOMO levels), high PLQYs, low lasing thresholds, net gain values of ca. 70 cm−1, and superior thermal and environmental stabilities.47 But the low electron-affinity of pyrene would reduce the current density and hinder the potential application in electrically pumped OSLs. Electron-donating (or electron-accepting) groups, e.g., cyanophenyl298 and diphenylamine units,299 were incorporated onto the pyrene-based starburst oligofluorenes (PyFnCN, n = 1–3, 175–177; PyFnNPh, n = 1–3, 178–180) to modulate the electrical properties. For OLED devices, PyFnCN (n = 1–3, 175–177) and PyFnNPh (n = 1–3, 178–180) manifested enhanced electrical properties with lower turn-on voltages, superior current efficiencies and brightness in comparison with the electroluminescent properties of their starburst counterparts Py-n (157 and 158) without electro-active end-cappers. Without sacrificing the optical properties, they showed comparable ASE/lasing thresholds and optical gain properties as summarized in Table 4.
Pyrenyl-capped dendritic starbursts were also synthesized and designed for lasing applications. For example, Lai et al. reported a set of novel trigonal starbursts with a truxene core and three end-capped pyrene units (TrF1Py and TrF2Py, 181 and 182).300 Due to the well-defined and restricted π-delocalization of truxene core, the fluorescence emission of TrF1Py (181) and TrF2Py (182) were blue-shifted compared with the pyrene-cored starbursts. The ASE thresholds for TrF1Py (181) and TrF2Py (182) films were recorded as 11.2 μJ cm−2 and 6.3 μJ cm−2, with the corresponding stimulated peak at 449 nm and 445 nm. TrF1Py (181) exhibited relatively stable ASE performance with only 4.5-fold Eth increment during the subsequent thermal annealing from room temperature to 250 °C. In comparison, Eth of TrF2Py (182) film increased seriously with 17.6-fold annealing up to 200 °C. For TrF2Py (182) film, green fluorescent emission band ranging from 500 nm to 600 nm appeared after annealing at 250 °C; while the PL spectrum remained almost unchanged without green emission band for TrF1Py (181) after annealing. The existence of green emission band, originated from the excimer formation (from the π–π stacking fluorene units), explains the different ASE behaviors of TrF1Py (181) and TrF2Py (182) after annealing. The key data obtained from DFB lasers with TrF1Py (181) and TrF2Py (182) as the emitters are summarized in Table 4. This work indicated that the long oligofluorene arms may be not the optimized choice for contributing dendritic starbursts. Due to superior ASE performance of TrF1Py (181), the pyrene-capped fluorene arms were further selected to construct stable organic gain media. Lai et al. constructed four-armed starburst macromolecules as gain media, with spirofluorene and pyrene as the central core.301 The chemical structures of the four-armed dendritic starbursts (PyFPy and SpFPy, 183 and 184) are depicted in Scheme 14. PL spectrum of PyFPy (183) showed bathochromic shift (>40 nm) compared with that of SpFPy (184) in film, due to the efficient energy transfer between pyrene-capped arms and pyrene core. The two samples manifested high PLQYs (74% for PyFPy, 183 and 62% for SpFPy, 184), low ASE thresholds (5.4 μJ cm−2 for PyFPy, 183 and 6.6 μJ cm−2 for SpFPy, 184) and stable ASE behaviors. ASE could still be detectable for the two samples even upon annealing up to 300 °C. To further estimate the optical stability, standard ASE measurements were conducted after soaking the samples in water (80 °C) for 10 min and then drying by blowing and annealing in nitrogen environment. The ASE thresholds of PyFPy (183) and SpFPy (184) showed slight increase with 2.6-fold and 4-fold after 7 test cycles, respectively. As a reference, even after the first cycle, the ASE threshold of PFO substantially increased with nearly 140-fold from 7.7 μJ cm−2 to 1.06 mJ cm−2. Therefore, PyFPy (183) and SpFPy (184) exhibited outstanding optical stabilities under both air and water conditions. The tunable lasing region of 30 nm (PyFPy (183): 476–505 nm; SpFPy (184): 442–472 nm) were achieved in DFB resonates by varying grating periods and emission layer thicknesses. The minimum lasing threshold values of 3.85 μJ cm−2 (24 nJ per pulse) and 6.0 μJ cm−2 (16 nJ per pulse) for PyFPy (183) and SpFPy (184) were obtained, respectively. Correspondingly, the DFB lasers based on PyFPy (183) and SpFPy (184) showed good ambient stabilities even under water conditions.

3.2.3.3 Other dendritic starbursts. 
Generally, solid-state molecules suffer from concentration quenching, induced by intermolecular interactions. To address this challenge, multi-dimensional steric conformation based on spirobifluorene core was constructed to effectively prevent the molecular aggregation and improve the processability as well as the morphological stability. In 1998, Johansson et al. presented the spectral narrowing of blue-emitting spiro-linked oligophenylenes, named as Sp-P1 (185) and Sp-P2 (186),302 in amorphous films. The spectral narrowing with dramatic collapse (linewidths to 2.2–2.9 nm) were observed in Sp-P1 (185) and Sp-P2 (186) with an increase of pump fluence. The narrowing emission were associated with the 0–0 vibronic transition for Sp-P1 (185) and the 0–1 vibronic transition for Sp-P2 (186) in their emission spectra. Spehr et al. selected additional substitutions with four methoxy groups or two biphenyl groups attached onto spiro-sexiphenyl, named as Sp-P1 (185), Sp-P3 (187) and Sp-P4 (188).232 Four-carbazole-armed spiro-compound (Sp-Cz, 190) was also reported with ASE threshold down to 3 μJ cm−2 for the thin film prepared by vacuum vapor deposition. In 2005, Schneider et al. reported a spiro-material, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(p-fluoro-phenyl)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Sp-F, 189), as the emitter for thin-film UV OSSLs with a spectral range from 378 nm to 395 nm.303 DFB lasers based on this sample exhibited a minimum threshold of 62 μJ cm−2 at 382 nm. Output energy up to 6.8 W from the fabricated UV DFB laser was observed, rendering the resulting OSSL an efficient light source for biomarker spectroscopy. Minimum DFB lasing threshold was recorded as 0.32 J cm−2 at 478 nm from a guest–host optical gain system using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(2,2-diphenylvinyl)spiro-9,9′-bi-fluorene (Sp-DPVBi, 191) as an emitter doping in another spiro molecule, 2,7-bis(biphenyl-4-yl)-2′w,7′-di-tert-butyl-9,9′-spirobi-fluorene, at a concentration of 1.1%.304
In 2015, Ma et al. reported a set of truxene-cored starburst molecules linked with different π-conjugated arms (TrSp, TrTSp, and TrCSp, 192–194).305Scheme 15 shows the molecular structures of these starburst compounds. The truxene core and spirobifluorene end-cappers were linked through single bonds (TrSp, 192), or thiophene units (TrTSp, 193), or N-ethylcarbazole units (TrCSp, 194). Truxene-cored starburst with spirobifluorene substituents (TrSp, 192) showed an optical gain with lasing fluence above 156 μJ cm−2. The ASE threshold came down to 83 μJ cm−2 for TrTSp (193) with thiophene linking truxene core and spirobifluorene substituents. But ASE disappeared in TrCSp (194) with thiophene replaced by N-ethylcarbazole. The improved intermolecular vibronic coupling and suppressed low-frequency vibrational modes via incorporating the thiophene units were presented with density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The enhanced high-frequency modes and decreased low-frequency modes are favorable for the formation of effective quasi four-level energy system for stimulated emission. On the contrary, the embedded N-ethylcarbazole moieties induce abundant strongly elongated low-frequency modes, which ruin the quasi four-level energy system.
 Scheme 15  Other dendritic starbursts as organic gain media. 
A series of structural isomers of trigonal starburst molecules, containing a truxene core and quarter-dialkylfluorene arms with different locations of benzothiadiazole (BT) moiety (Tr-nBT, n = 1–5, 195–199), were presented by Skabara and Bradley.306 The optical properties from absorption and PL spectra could be adequately described in accordance with BT unit at the three different possible positions, corresponding to a Tr-1/4BT pair (195 and 198), a Tr-2/3BT pair (196 and 197) and Tr-5BT (199), rationalized on the basis of molecular symmetry. Dramatically, Tr-5BT (199) exhibited a very weak BT unit absorption, weak BT Raman scattering intensities centered at 1360 and 1547 cm−1, and a strong blue-shifted PL, as a direct consequence of the relatively weak amplitude of HOMO with occupied natural transition orbital (NTO) when BT unit is located at the arm end. It led to the formation of a fast relaxed excited state from the Franck–Condon (vertical transition) state created by photon absorption, which resulted in the absence of ASE even having a pumping energy of up to 500 μJ cm−2, and the accompanying low PLQY (ca. 27%). For Tr-nBT (n = 1–4, 195–198), the ASE thresholds were around 60 μJ cm−2, and the ASE saturation were observed above 200 μJ cm−2. The results indicated that any effect of changing the ground state polarization gradient may affect the performance of gain media in ASE and lasing. Recently, Lai et al. reported a novel set of monodisperse ladder-type oligo(p-phenylene)s starbursts, named as TrL-n (n = 1–3, 200–202).284 Compared with their linear counterparts, TrL-n (200–202) exhibited suppressed low-energy emission and enhanced optical stabilities. The rather low ASE thresholds, i.e., threshold of 1.60 μJ cm−2 for TrL-3 (202), were recorded for TrL-n, suggesting their promising prospects for use as organic gain media.


3.2.4 Conjugated polymers. 
Fluorescent polymers with π-conjugation are yielded from various monomers, ranging from randomly composed chains to highly oriented and defined chains. Polymers can possess various morphologies varying from disorderly amorphous to highly oriented crystalline. As far as we are concerned, the amorphous polymers usually exhibit good optical properties, while the crystalline polymers often manifest superior charge transport properties.
Particularly, polymers exhibit excellent film-forming abilities and attractive mechanical properties, thus rendering them highly attractive for flexible optoelectronic devices via solution processing.
3.2.4.1 Polyfluorenes. 
Polyfluorenes and their derivatives have been served as a significant kind of polymers for application in OSSLs. Various metastable morphologies are observed in polyfluorenes, and the specific morphology greatly relies on the fabrication process and/or the thermal history of the molecular film layer. There are a number of studies on the phases and photophysical properties of polyfluorenes with different side-substitutions. Among them, PFO (203) is one of the most widely known conjugated polymers, demonstrating particularly rich-phase behaviors. Among the fluorene-based polymers, the lowest lasing thresholds by far were recorded for those with β-phase morphology, in which individual oriented molecular chain had an extended π-conjugation without π–π stacking.307 Recent studies on the refractive index deviation of β-phase and amorphous phase polyfluorenes showed that attractive device geometries featuring with mixed morphologies can be constructed.308 In comparison to the amorphous morphology, the β-phase PFO (203) demonstrated an additional lower energy absorption shoulder (∼430 nm), resulted in a 1–2% refractive index increase in this spectral region. DFB lasers based on PFO (203) in β-phase via spin-coating manifested bathochromic shifts by a few nanometers compared with the output lasing from the amorphous polymer counterpart integrating with the same period DFB gratings.309
PFO (203) with various morphologies could be induced via spin-coating from various solvents, thermal cycling, exposure to solvent vapors, etc. Liquid crystalline phases could be processed by depositing PFO (203) onto the rubbed polyimide substrates.310 By nanoimprinting, DFB grating was imposed onto the PFO (203) layer. The wavelengths of lasing emission and the lasing thresholds could be tuned by controlling the PFO (203) chains orientation with respect to the nanoimprinted 1D DFB grating direction. In this way, the effective refractive indexes of PFO (203) could be adjusted to the oscillation geometry and lasing thresholds as low as 20 μJ cm−2 could be achieved. On the other hand, the polymer alignment could improve the charge carrier mobility. The combination of β-phase and amorphous-phase morphology of PFO (203) layer were achieved by spin-coating hot solution and then exposing in toluene vapor. Side-by-side PFO (203) layer with various morphologies were induced onto the grating.311 The metastable morphology could be eliminated by heating up to the transition temperature under the subsequent solvent exposure. Alexander et al. reported a novel polyfluorene with vinyl-ether-functionalized aliphatic side-chains (VE-PFO, 204).307,312 An extraordinary advantage of this polyfluorene was that the induced β-phase morphology could be fixed by cross-linking. The crosslinked VE-PFO (204) film don’t dissolve in the subsequent solvent processing without affecting the morphology patterns. With this strategy, a β-phase cross-linkable VE-PFO (204) layer was imposed with a DFB grating by using electron beam lithography. As followed, an amorphous layer of VE-PFO (204) on top was formed by spin-coating, resulting in a double-layered device with a stack of β-phase and amorphous morphologies. Both layers emitted laser radiation at the same time in such a layered device with mixed morphologies when the excitation energy densities exceeded these two thresholds. A lasing threshold as low as 0.4 μJ cm−2 was achieved from the β-phase cross-linkable VE-PFO (204) film. Recently, Lin et al. synthesized a model polyfluorene, namely, poly[4-(octyloxy)-9,9-diphenylfluorene-2,7-diyl]-co-[5-(octyloxy)-9,9-diphenylfluoren-2,7-diyl] (PODPF, 205), in which the octyloxy unit lied at 4-position of fluorene and diphenyl moieties substituted at the 9-position of fluorene units.313 The β-phase morphology of PODPF (205) film was achieved by spin-coating from toluene solution, and erased by the annealing process. The thin film of PODPF (205) exhibited outstanding spectral stability without obviously green fluorescent emission band even annealing at 200 °C for 12 h under ambient conditions. The ASE threshold of β-phase PODPF (205) for 461 nm was 15.7 μJ cm−2, and the lasing peak at 462 nm with a threshold of 42 nJ per pulse was achieved.
Modulating the lengths of side flexible chain has been proved to be an effective strategy to finely modulate the charge carrier mobilities of polyfluorenes. For example, dioctylfluorene was copolymerized with diethylhexylfluorene to improve the hole mobility of polyfluorene, and thus a homopolymer involving only dioctylfluorene (PFO, 203), and copolymers consisting of dioctylfluorene and diethylhexyl-fluorene with ratios of 4:1 (PFO-EH-1, 206) and 1:1 (PFO-EH-2, 207) were synthesized.11 The molecular structures of these polymers are depicted in Fig. 12a and Scheme 16. Decreasing the length of substituted flexible chain from octyl to butyl, the interchain distance was reduced with increased mobility and favorable light emission characteristic. The ASE wavelengths were around 450 nm for all polymers (Fig. 12b). As shown in Fig. 12c, the resulting copolymer materials exhibited enhanced hole mobilities (determined by time-of-flight (TOF)) (μhole ≈ 3–6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which were more than 100-fold higher than that of PFO (203). The increased mobilities were resulted from improved interchain charge hopping at the sites of diethylhexylfluorene monomer, where the distance between intermolecular polyfluorene skeletons was improved, compared with those with octyl-substituents that might isolate the polyfluorene chains. With 1D DFB grating, a lasing threshold (0.3 μJ cm−2) with a slope efficiency of 11% (Fig. 12d) was obtained for PFO-ET-1 (206) as gain media. Organic lasers with a 45 nm spectral window from 434 nm to 479 nm were achieved by varying the film thicknesses (45–160 nm) (Fig. 12e).

 Scheme 16  Polyfluorene derivatives as gain media. 
For blue-color-emitting polyfluorene polymers, one serious issue is their poor spectral stabilities caused by interchain interactions or the oxidative instabilities with fluorenone defects. Great efforts, such as constructing copolymer configuration, the introduction of other functional groups, spiro linkages, etc., have been made to overcome this challenge. Xia et al. reported a copolymer, poly(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene-co-9,9-di(4-methoxy)phenylfluorene) (PF8DP, 208) as gain medium,314 which exhibited similar PL spectrum, lower ASE threshold (6.25 μJ cm−2), and similar gain value (66 cm−1) compared with PFO (203). A novel polymer with spiroanthracenefluorene monomer, namely poly(9-spiro(10,10-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-10H-anthracene)-fluorene) (PEHSAF, 209), was reported as gain medium, which exhibited thermally stable stimulated emission in vacuum upon annealing up to 250 °C with moderate gain coefficient (38 cm−1) and ASE threshold (131 μJ cm−2).315 Functional groups, such as carbazole,316 bi-naphthalene,317 solfonyl,50 and dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide spacer units,318 were selected to construct statistical copolymers of polyfluorenes. The polymer structures of PFC (210), PFBN (211), PFSO (212) and PPFSO-n (n = 1–3) (213–215) are shown in Scheme 16. The corresponding data of ASE/lasing performance are shown in Table 5. Polyspirobifluorenes cross-linked with the use of oxetane functional groups were also explored and investigated, which exhibited mediocre ASE performance.319–321

3.2.4.2 LPPPs. 
The low carrier mobilities and poor oxidative stabilities in polyfluorene derivatives, which is generally caused by interchain-aggregation-induced energy transfer to fluorenone defects, have inevitably impeded their potential applications in electrically driven OSSLs. To overcome this problem, LPPPs with the design concept to fuse the conjugated backbone architectures have been proposed to explore organic emitters with great thermal and electrochemical stability, and prominent charge-carrier mobility. The investigation of synthesis and photophysical property of LPPP was firstly reported by Scherf and Müllen in 1991.322 Since then, a large number of ladder-type polymers have been designed and synthesized for organic electronics.323,324 Among them, the most well-known ladder-type polymer is MeLPPP (217), which has aroused intense photophysical investigations.46,60,322,325–327 It showed an ASE threshold of 20 μJ cm−2 at the peak of 489 nm. The bathochromic-shifted ASE peak, compared with PFO (203), was mainly due to the large planar rigid ladder-type conjugated backbone structure. A moderate gain coefficient of 16 cm−1 was detected by using VSL method in MeLPPP (217). Kallinger et al. reported the lasing performance based on MeLPPP (217) as the emitter. A low lasing threshold (4.8 μJ cm−2) was demonstrated.325
In 2008, Laquai et al. demonstrated the ASE performance of a number of blue-emitting LPPPs, namely, LPPP-1/2/3 (218–220).46 Carbazole was introduced to construct ladder-type polymers (PLC-1/2, 221 and 222). A fully arylated polyfluorene (PFP8, 216, as shown in Scheme 16) was selected as a reference for the comparison with the ladder-type polymers. The chemical structures of LPPP-1/2/3 (218–220) and PLC-1/2 (221 and 222) are depicted in Scheme 17. The ASE thresholds of carbazole-containing LPPPs (PLC-1/2, 221 and 222) were much higher, and no meaningful gain coefficient was recorded for the resulting carbazole-containing polymers. LPPP-1 (218), whose monomer with 3 bridged phenyl rings, demonstrated a low ASE threshold of 3 μJ cm−2 and a relatively high optical gain of 21 cm−1. As to indenofluorene copolymers, ASE thresholds close to that of LPPP-1 (218) were observed for poly(indenofluorene-cophenanthrene)s (4.5 μJ cm−2 and 17.5 μJ cm−2 for PIF-1 and PIF-2, respectively; 223 and 224).48 However, PIF-1 (223) demonstrated a very high gain value of 154 cm−1. More impressively, a TOF hole mobility of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for PIF-1 (223). In an OFET architecture, hole mobility up to 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved. Simultaneous optimization of stimulated emission and charge carrier mobility is generally required towards electrically pumped organic lasers.

3.2.4.3 Polymers contain BT units. 
As for other polyfluorene copolymers, poly(dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT, 225) is a popular conjugated polymer with yellow-green stimulated emission and moderate ASE threshold (28 μJ cm−2).314 By modulating the ratio of fluorene (F8) to BT units from 1:1 to 9:1, the ASE threshold of this novel material, named as 9F8–1BT (226), was significantly decreased with a value of 2 μJ cm−2.328 This improvement might originate from the isolation of polymer chains by the octyl side chains, leading to the efficiently suppressed exciton annihilation. With using 9F8–1BT (226) as the emitter, the first LED pumped OSSL was demonstrated by Samuel's group.19 The schematic diagram of the hybrid InGaN-semiconducting polymer laser is depicted in Fig. 1. The onset of DFB laser at 568 nm was achieved when the InGaN LED driving current above 144 A, corresponding to a lasing threshold of 6.5 μJ cm−2 (180 W cm−2). This work opened the gate of indirect electrically pumped organic lasers.18,26,27,125–127 With using F8BT (225) and 9F8–1BT (226) as gain media, Karl et al. recently reported the membrane-based, substrate-less and extremely thin DFB lasers for portable security tags application.329
Recently, Yu et al. developed a series of fluorene-based copolymers with yellow-green emission composed of the branched 2-methyl-butyl substituted fluorene-co-benzothiadiazole and F8BT monomer in different ratios (namely, nF1/4F8BT, 227–230, with n representing the ratio of 9,9-di(2-methyl)butyl (F1/4) in the copolymer).330 The chemical structures of nF1/4F8BT are depicted in Scheme 18. Doping nF1/4F8BT (227–230) copolymers into PFO (203), a systematic increase in PLQY was observed by increasing the ratio of the F1/4 monomers. Manifested as reduced ASE thresholds (2.8 μJ cm−2vs. 4.3 μJ cm−2) and increased gain values (32 cm−1vs. 22 cm−1) with respect to F8BT blends, nF1/4F8BT (227–230) blends exhibited superior optical gain properties. The branched F1/4 substitution in the copolymers hindered exciton annihilation. Ladder-type oligophenylenes were introduced to construct ladder-type poly(indenofluorene-co-benzothiadiazole)s to explore light amplified application.331,332 Ladder-type oligo(indenofluorene)s were incorporated with BT units and various indenofluorene chains with different lengths, denoted as LPBT-n (n = 1–3) (231–233). Compared with 9,9-dioctylfluorene units, the indenofluorene chains exhibited much more efficient energy transfer to BT units. Without blending, a low ASE threshold of 6.0 μJ cm−2 was achieved for LPBT-3 (233), with a high net gain value (84 cm−1).
 Scheme 18  Polymeric gain media with BT units. 
Lasing can also be observed in ternary copolymers. Ternary copolymer poly(fluorene-co-benzothiadiazole-co-thiophene-co-tri-phenylamine), known as Red F (234), was reported as a gain medium.314,333,334 A very broad tunable wavelength range (627–702 nm) was demonstrated in the resulting optically pumped 2D DFB lasers.333 The lowest lasing threshold was recorded of 1.1 μJ cm−2 for the operation at 698 nm. Optical switching in DFB lasers based on Red F (234) with red lasing emission was demonstrated by Xia et al., using optical control pulses (1.28 μm, 4 ps, 5 kHz).334 As a response to the optical control pulse, the reduction of the lasing output by more than 30 times can be used a new switch to provide effective wavelength conversion from silica to polymer optical fiber to regulate the communication wavelengths.
3.2.4.4 PPV derivatives. 
Besides the fluorene-based polymers, another important class of linear polymers are PPVs. The first polymer light-emitting diode (PLED) was reported based on PPV (235) by Friend and co-authors in 1990.5 Lasing emission from the polymer film was reported in 1996 by optically pumping PPV (235).17 Due to the insoluble nature of PPV (235), PPV (235) films were usually fabricated from the solution-processable precursor polymer. The precursor polymer converted into PPV (235) in films after thermal conversion.5,335 Various flexible chains were then added onto the phenylene units to enhance the polymeric solubility. Various PPV derivatives were reported with promising ASE/lasing performance, including poly(2-butyl-5-(2′-ethylhexyl)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (BuEH-PPV, 236),17 poly(2,5-bis(2′,5′-bis(2′′-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (BBEHP-PPV, 237),336,337 poly(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV, 238),338 poly((2-(2′,5′-bis(2′′-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene)-co-(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene)) (BEHP-co-MEH-PPV, 239),339,340etc. The polymer structures are depicted in Scheme 19.
 Scheme 19  PPV derivatives for polymer lasers. 
“Super Yellow” (240) is one of the most popular PPV derivatives as yellow emitters in PLEDs.341,342 PPV derivatives BBEHP-PPV (237) and MEH-PPV (238) have been extensively studied for green and red polymer lasers, because of their very low ASE/lasing thresholds and high optical gain values. For example, Rose et al. recorded the low lasing threshold of BBEHP-PPV (237) down to 0.04 μJ cm−2 (Fig. 13a–c), and demonstrated the sensing application to detect explosives based on the resulting organic laser device.336 The results showed that the resulting optically pumped attenuated laser device based on BBEHP-PPV (237) film displayed excellent sensitivity to the explosive vapors over 30 times higher, compared with the observation from PL emission (Fig. 13d and f). As sketched in Fig. 13e, in the existence of explosive vapors, the DFB lasing threshold increased and the chemical sensitivity was determined. Non-radiative deactivation pathways were induced by trace amount of explosive vapors of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), leading to the competition with stimulated emission. In other work, by mixing BBEHP-PPV (237) with 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol divinyl ether (CHDV) and spin-coating onto a DFB grating, the diluted BBEHP-PPV (237) film exhibited a high threshold of 1.1 mJ cm−2.337

Park et al. investigated the ASE performance of MEH-PPV (238) in 1999.343 Narrowed spectrum was recorded with an ASE threshold of 62.5 μJ cm−2 and emission center at 638 nm. The net gain of doped MEH-PPV film is ca. 70 cm−1.344 Since then, MEH-PPV (238) has been widely used as a standard red-color gain medium in organic laser physics. For example, a 2D DFB laser based on MEH-PPV (238) was demonstrated by Samuel and co-authors.345 A pumping energy threshold of 5.9 μJ cm−2 was recorded by the observation of the band-edge lasing at 636 nm. The laser exhibited an energy slope efficiency of 6.8%, with maximum output energy of 1.12 nJ per pulse at pumping energy of 20.4 nJ per pulse. A novel copolymer, named as BEHP-co-MEH-PPV (239), consisting of the monomers of BEHP-PPV and MEH-PPV, was found to be resistant to photodegradation with good solubility at room temperature. PL spectrum of BEHP-co-MEH-PPV (239) covered broad emission ranging from 550 nm to 625 nm, corresponding to the yellow-red emission characteristic of MEH-PPV, indicating efficient intramolecular energy transfer in the polymer skeletons. A low lasing threshold was achieved (9 μJ cm−2) in a single-defect microcavity structure, with emission peak at 607 nm.340
3.2.4.5 Other polymeric gain media. 
Hyperbranched polymers have been employed as efficient emitters in OLEDs,346,347 especially in white PLEDs.348,349 The molecular design provides a valuable platform to achieve high-quality white EL. As a part of the efforts, Lai et al. explored the fine modulation of the energy transfer process in different emission species of two novel star-shaped single-polymer systems.350,351 Two star-shaped models, tris(4-(3-hexyl-5-(7-(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)phenyl)amine (TN) and 7,7′-(5,5′-(9-(4-(3-hexyl-5-(7-(4-hexyl-thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)phenyl)-H-carbazole-3,6-diyl)bis(4-hexylthiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(4-(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (TM), were chosen as the central cores for saturated red emission. Star-shaped single polymers were framed by introducing BT units as green emissive dopants and polyfluorene as blue emissive moieties onto the red TN/TM cores. The chemical structures of star-shaped single-polymers (241–250) with different ratios of TN/TM and BT units are depicted in Scheme 20. Interestingly, ASE could be observed in these white emissive single-polymers. Due to the trace amounts of green and red emission units, the incomplete energy transfers could be achieved by ICT in these white emissive single-polymers. The ASE peaks were located at 448 nm, which were assigned to the stimulated emission of polyfluorenes. The large optical losses induced by abundant vibronic bands from the broad PL emission in these polymers led to much higher ASE thresholds (>10 fold) as compared with PFO (203).

Generally, physical blending strategy is an effective method to improve the optical gain properties. Mixing two different chromophores could effectively prevent concentration quenching. With this strategy, some less emissive materials could achieve relatively low ASE/lasing thresholds. For example, for thiophene-based polymers, lasing was recorded in microcavity resonator containing poly(3-(2,5-dioctylphenyl)thiophene) (PDOPT, 251) with relatively high lasing threshold of 2.4 μJ cm−2 (24 mW cm−2).352,353 But no lasing action was observed for poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, 252) even in high Q resonator configuration.354 By blending 10–20 wt% P3HT (252) with F8BT (225) films, efficient lasing from P3HT (252) with attractive optical gain properties were achieved.355 A threshold of ca. 60 μJ cm−2 with a corresponding high gain (50 cm−1) was recorded for the blended film with 15 wt% P3HT (252). The resulting 1D DFB lasers exhibited thresholds as low as 26 μJ cm−2, much lower than other thiophene-based polymers.
As discussed in Section 2.4.3, MOFs were selected as feedback structures for organic dye lasers because of their quasi-periodic configurations. However, the device stability is a key issue because of the short-term stability of the encapsulated dye. Chemically bridging the metal-nodes with chromophore-linkers would enhance the thermal stability compared to the physically doping strategy. Recently, Medishetty et al. reported two novel 3D MOFs, In-MOF (253) and Zn-MOF (254), which were derived from a well-established AIE dye, tetrakis[4-(4-carboxyphenyl)phenyl]ethane (H4TCPE), acting as a linker coordinating with In3+ and Zn2+ nodes (Fig. 14a and b).103 Pumped by femtosecond pulse laser, these MOF single crystals generated intrinsic blue stimulated emission with resulted ASE thresholds of 36 mJ cm−2 and 27 mJ cm−2 for In-MOF (253) and Zn-MOF (254), respectively (Fig. 14c, d and f). Besides, the emission lifetime of In-MOF (253) decreased from 900 ns to 500 ns for stimulated emission (Fig. 14e). Similarly, the decreased fluorescence lifetime from 1.2 ms to 380 ns was also shown in Zn-MOF (254) (Fig. 14g). It should be noted that there was no lasing occurring during the optical pumping, though in some cases, the MOF quasi-periodic structure could act as a Fabry–Perot cavity to realize lasing.100–102 The ASE thresholds were relatively higher compared with other organic materials. But still, this work proved that coordination network materials, such as MOFs, could act as novel optical gain media for lasing applications.

3.3 Triplet gain media and triplet sensitizers
Generally, there are mainly three emission mechanisms for organic light sources: fluorescence, phosphorescence,356 and TADF,2 currently available for achieving efficient light output. The existing organic gain media are dominated by fluorescent materials.
According to spin statistics, a 1:3 ratio for singlet and triplet excitons is expected in carrier recombination,357,358 indicating that 75% formed excitons are prevented for the contribution of the singlet population in fluorescent emitters. As a result, a maximum of 25% for internal electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (IQE) would be limited in organic light-emitting devices, such as OLEDs, under current injection. Phosphorescent and TADF materials are particularly interesting, in which theoretically all of the formed excitons, including singlet and triplet excitons, could be harvested as EL. As discussed in Section 4, extremely high current density (a few kA cm−2) is necessary for achieving electrically pumped OSSLs. Therefore, if the 75% triplet excitons could be effectively utilized, it would be much helpful to reduce the injected current density above lasing threshold for electrically pumped OSSLs. In most common cases, since the value of the excited-state absorption cross-section (σex, T1 → Tn) for phosphorescent (or TADF) emitter is much larger than the maximum stimulated emission cross-section (σem, T1 → S0), no ASE occurs in the pumping process.44
The only one example of phosphorescence laser was reported by Yu et al.40 Unlike most phosphorescent metal-complex molecules, the phosphorescence was achieved from a sulfide-substituted difluoroboron compound, (E)-3-(((4-nitrophenyl)imino)methyl)-2H-thiochroman-4-olate·BF2 (S-BF2, 255) (Scheme 21 and Fig. 15a). Compared with the non-substituted compound, (E)-2-(((4-nitrophenyl)vimino)methyl)-naphthalen-1-olate·BF2 (C-BF2) (Fig. 15a), S-BF2 (255) reversed the lowest singlet π–π* electronic transition by n–π* transition. In sharp contrast to the forbiddance of ISC from S1(π,π*) to T1(π,π*) in C-BF2, T1(π,π*) ← S1(n,π*) ISC was found with 100% efficiency in S-BF2 (255). ICT character was introduced in S-BF2 (255) with the assistance of the nitro moiety, leading to a moderate phosphorescence efficiency of 10%. S-BF2 (255) single-crystalline nanowires were fabricated via solution self-assembly method. As shown in Fig. 15b and c, the nanowires manifested strong yellow-red emission and acted as effective optical waveguide with bright PL from the end tips. A fast decay lifetime of 2.3 ns was monitored with PL peak at 510 nm (Fig. 15d), corresponding to fluorescence emission. Another emission peak of S-BF2 (255) nanowire was at 610 nm with a decayed lifetime of 9.3 μs (Fig. 15d), which was assigned to phosphorescence emission. Lasing output at 650 nm was recorded in the 30 μm length nanowire, mainly because of the construction of Fabry–Perot microcavity in the nanowire (Fig. 15e). The evolution from phosphorescence radiation to narrowed spontaneous emission started at 10.4 μJ cm−2, and further increasing the pumping energy above 12.8 μJ cm−2, lasing oscillation occurred (Fig. 15f and Table 6). FWHM of individual cavity mode was ca. 0.76 nm with lasing peak at 650 nm, obtaining a cavity quality factor Q ≈ 850. More modes in the nanowire lasing spectra were observed by increasing the nanowire lengths (Fig. 15g). A linear relationship was demonstrated in the value of mode spacing dependent on 1/L (L is the twice fold of nanowire length). This work made a big leap by exploring phosphorescence gain media for addressing the challenges towards OSL diodes (OSLDs).

Another type of triplet gain media were achieved in TADF emitters reported by Adachi's group.22,41–43 The first reported TADF examples as gain media are 5,9-diphenyl-5,9-diaza-13b-boranaphtho [3,2,1-de]anthracene (DABNA-1, 256) and 9-([1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl)-N,N,5,11-tetraphenyl-5,9-dihydro-5,9-diaza-13b-boranaphtho[3,2,1-de]anthracen-3-amine (DABNA-2, 257).41 Unlike typical TADF materials, DABNA-2 (257) held the strong π–π* characteristic, leading to a high PLQY (74%) and a quite narrow PL emission with FWHM less than 30 nm. The co-evaporated film of 6 wt% DABNA-2 (257) in CBP showed a rapid decrease of FWHM, corresponding to a nonlinear increase of output intensity, with increasing the excitation intensity, which clearly indicated the achievement of light amplification. ASE threshold of 1.6 μJ cm−2 with emission peak at 494 nm was recorded. Similar ASE characteristic was observed for DABNA-1 (256). Rigid core of DABNA maintained a small energy band gap between S1 and T1 (ΔEST), which appeared as the key to the gain for light amplification. But the rate of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) in DABNA-2 was very low (kRISC = 3.1 × 103 s−1), which significantly restricted the contribution of converted singlet excitons from triplet excitons to light amplification process.
NIR TADF emitters, boron difluoride curcuminoid derivatives, were then investigated as gain media.22,42,43 The boron difluoride curcuminoid derivatives, named as BDFC-1 (258) and BDFC-2 (259), contained triphenylamine donor and acetylacetonate boron difluoride acceptor. Compared with the one branch derivative BDFC-1 (258), BDFC-2 (259) possessed larger π-conjugated system and stronger charge transfer character with efficient NIR emission.22 As described in Fig. 16a, by increasing the BDFC-2 (259) concentration from 2 to 60 wt%, the blended samples (with CBP as a host) showed substantial spectral bathochromic shifts in NIR region, corresponding with PL peak from 706 to 782 nm. The PLQY of neat BDFC-2 (259) film was only ca. 3.2%. Decreasing the doping concentrations, the PLQY values of the BDFC-2 (259) blends gradually increased, and a maximum value of 70% was achieved for the 6 wt% BDFC-2 (259) blended sample (Fig. 16b). The streak camera image of 6 wt% CBP blended sample with BDFC-2 (259) exhibited prompt NIR and delayed fluorescence (Fig. 16c), which mainly originated from the emissive monomer states (with shorter-lived emission, at higher energy) and dimer states (with longer-lived emission, at lower energy) (Fig. 16d). NIR-TADF OLED devices were fabricated. The OLED architecture, including the schematic and energy-level diagram, is shown in Fig. 16e. The device with doping concentration of 6 wt% BDFC-2 (259) exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) approaching 10% with EL peak at 721 nm (Fig. 16f and g). This outstanding EQE value is well above the theoretical upper limit for conventional fluorescent OLEDs. A clear narrowed spontaneous emission was observed in the 6 wt% BDFC-2 (259) blended sample at high pumping intensity (Fig. 16h). The ASE threshold was 7 μJ cm−2, and FWHM of ASE spectrum was found to drop to ca. 10 nm (Fig. 16i). With increasing the BDFC-2 (259) concentration up to 10 wt%, the ASE thresholds quickly increased, mainly due to the concomitant decrease of PLQY values in this process (Fig. 16j).

By appending acetylacetone borondifluoride or carboxylate in the meso position of boron difluoride curcuminoid, another two different boron difluoride curcuminoid derivatives, named as BDFC-3 (appended acetylacetone borondifluoride in the meso position, 260) and BDFC-4 (appended carboxylate in the meso position, 261), were designed and synthesized.43 The chemical structures are depicted at Scheme 21. The two branched difluoride curcuminoid compound (BDFC-3, 260) exhibited bathochromic-shifted NIR emission exceeding 800 nm while keep high NIR PL property. A maximum EQE of 5.1% was achieved in NIR TADF OLEDs, with emission peak above 760 nm. ASE with thresholds lower than 100 μJ cm−2 were demonstrated in the doped films, keeping ASE spectral region between 801 nm and 860 nm. These studies represented important advances in NIR OLEDs and demonstrated the possibility of TADF emitters as gain media with broad spectral range for photonic and telecommunication applications.
Another strategy, i.e., adding “triplet sensitizer” into the fluorophore, is widely used to utilize the triplet excitons in OLED field. The management of triplet energy could be achieved by the conversion from triplet excitons to singlet excitons through energy transfer via FRET, which was firstly proved by Baldo and Forrest in 2000.147 Fluorescent OLEDs based on a triplet sensitizer (a phosphor or TADF) and a conventional fluorescent emitter were reported recently.359–363 The achievement of the “triplet sensitizers” in constructing efficient fluorescent OLEDs also suggested their potentials for light amplification.
Adachi et al. demonstrated this feasible method in light amplification by using TADF molecule as “triplet sensitizer”, which harnessed the triplet energy for population inversion by converting triplet excitons to singlet excitons and subsequently transferring the singlet energy to the laser dye.146 3-(9,9-Dimethylacridin-10(9H)-yl)-9H-xanthen-9-one (ACRXTN, 262) was selected as the triplet sensitizer, and 2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1,1,7,7,-tetramethyl-1H,5H,11H-10-(2-benzothiazolyl)quinolizino-[9,9a,1gh]coumarin (C545T) was used as the laser dye. The host material was CBP. The PL emission of the triplet blended film fitted well with the emission of C545T:CBP co-deposited film, indicating that the triplet sensitizer (ACRXTN, 262) just acted as a medium to pass its triplet and singlet energy to the laser dye (C545T) for radiative decay. A decreased ASE threshold of 0.8 μJ cm−2 was demonstrated in this three-component blend, compared with the sample without ACRXTN (262) with a value of 1.2 μJ cm−2. Unlike the OLED device without ACRXTN (262), the efficiency (maximum EQE of over 10%) increased significantly by adding TADF molecules. More importantly, the device with ACRXTN revealed the excellent efficiency stability with low EQE roll-off. The estimated threshold current density for lasing collapsed from ca. 2500 A cm−2 to ca. 200 A cm−2 in the device with triplet sensitizer, indicating the attractive application of this method towards OSLDs.
Recently, Lai et al. presented a novel concept by comprising iridium complexes as triplet sensitizers and a fluorescent conjugated polymer (F8BT) as gain medium to construct triplet–singlet guest–host gain systems for light amplification.364Fig. 17a shows the proposed FRET diagram from a phosphorescent sensitizer to a laser fluorophor. The selected three iridium complexes were named as (Dfpypy)2Ir(pic) (263), (Dfpypy)2Ir(dpm) (264) and (Dfpypy)2Ir(acac) (265) (as shown in Scheme 22). The PL spectrum of (Dfpypy)2Ir(pic) (263) overlapped well with the absorption spectrum of F8BT, indicating the expected efficient energy transfer from (Dfpypy)2Ir(pic) (263) to F8BT (Fig. 17b). Note that, in the blended systems possessing a phosphor as a host and a fluorophore as a guest, the energy transfer processes were Dexter transfer in most cases,365,366 occurring at short distances (typically within 1 nm). However, the long aryl-flexible chains (ca. 1.1 nm) in iridium complexes played important roles to eliminate the exchange interactions by the wavefunction overlaps of electron clouds between iridium complexes and F8BT (Fig. 17d). From a series of measurements, including PIA spectroscopy, PL excitation (PLE) spectra, and fluorescence transients (Fig. 17c), the direct triplet–singlet energy transfer process was confirmed and Dexter energy transfer was forbidden in these blended systems.

 Scheme 22  The triplet sensitizers. 
Successful light amplification were demonstrated with lower ASE threshold and much better lasing performance for the resulting triplet–singlet guest–host system compared with F8BT sample without triplet sensitizers. The lowest ASE threshold of 7.1 μJ cm−2 was recorded for (Dfpypy)2Ir(pic) blended sample (263) with 90% F8BT fraction, which was three-fold lower than that of F8BT itself (Fig. 17e and f). Similar phenomena were observed in blended films with (Dfpypy)2Ir(dpm) (264) and (Dfpypy)2Ir(acac) (265) as “triplet sensitizers”(Fig. 17g). For comparison, a blended system with confirmed Dexter energy transfer, containing Iridium [bis(4,6-difluoro-phenypyridinato-N,C2′)picolinate] (FIrpic) (with no flexible chain) and F8BT,365 was selected to understand the dependence of Dexter energy transfer process on light amplification. As shown in Fig. 17g, the FIrpic blended samples showed much higher ASE thresholds than F8BT itself. The narrowed spectral emission were only observed in FIrpic blended samples with F8BT fractions of 85%, 90% and 95%, while no ASE was recorded for FIrpic blended samples with F8BT fraction less than 85%. The results proved that the triplet–triplet annihilation in Dexter energy transfer provided exciton quenching, and was adverse to light amplification. At the same time, the fluorescent OLEDs with “triplet sensitizers” demonstrated with enhanced electroluminescent performance relative to those without “triplet sensitizer” (Fig. 17h). By integrating DFB into the blended film, a very low lasing threshold of 1.86 μJ cm−2 (0.37 kW cm−2) was manifested for (Dfpypy)2Ir(pic) blended film (263) with 90% F8BT fraction. For comparison, the DFB laser with F8BT as gain medium recorded a much higher lasing threshold of 8.66 μJ cm−2 (1.73 kW cm−2) at 566.1 nm (Fig. 17i). A ca. 30 nm tunable lasing spectral window from 561 to 590 nm was enabled in the blended film by varying the grating periods from 320 to 360 nm (Fig. 17j). The work suggests a general and effective methodology to utilize both triplet and singlet excitons for the contribution of light amplification, accompanying with excellent electroluminescent performance, providing an alternative route for electrically pumped OSLs.
3.4 Others
Perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation solar cell materials due to their tunable bandgaps, low-temperature processabilities, low recombination rates, and long electron–hole diffusion lengths.367 The archetypical semiconductors with nearly 100% defect free and crystalline films of perovskites yielded solar cells with over 20% efficiency, rivaling the performance of industry-standard silicon, due to the long-range charge transport and efficient charge collection.368,369 Definitive strides have also been made by perovskites as promising light-emitting materials in applications of LEDs,370,371 and tunable ASE and lasing.94,372
Strictly speaking, perovskites are inorganic materials; nevertheless, some of their qualities are similar to organic molecules and can be conveniently incorporated into organic optoelectronic devices. The rapid advances in perovskite LEDs and lasers, including materials development, device fabrication, operational stability, have been comprehensively reviewed by Veldhuis et al.373 Here we emphasize that perovskites are important gain candidates for electrically pumped lasers, mainly due to their high charge carrier mobilities and large crystalline domains that resulted from their crystalline nature in perovskite films,374,375 low thresholds (ASE threshold of 10 μJ cm−2 for MeNH3PbI3 perovskite),372 and broadly tunable emission (almost the entire visible spectrum).376 Recently, the perovskite nanowire lasers94,95 and perovskite WGM nanolasers were also reported.377–379
Recently, some new types of organic materials are used in the field of lasers, e.g., liquid crystal materials with high degree of self-arrangement.81,380 Liquid crystals represent a kind of soft matter that combines fluid-like behavior with crystalline-like solid ordering. Liquid lasers possess many remarkable features, such as large coherence area, wideband tunability, and multidirectional emission under some conditions. Most importantly, they have the potential of combining large output power with miniature laser oscillation dimension, even these two characteristics are contradictory in most cases. Additionally, they have diverse potential applications such as large-area holographic laser displays and miniature medical diagnostic tools.81
Fluorescent proteins represent a series of biologic fluorophores, whose fluorescence phenomenon can be traced back to 1962.381 The fluorescent proteins also find potential application as laser gain media. Gather and Yun firstly observed the lasing action in a living system.20 The gain medium, which was composed of a single mammalian cell with a diameter of 15 μm, transfected with a mutant form of GFP. Lasing was recorded by placing the cell suspension in a DBR resonator. The operational lasing threshold was around 1 nJ per pulse with tunable lasing wavelength region of 516–520 nm. The cells remained alive under lasing excitation, providing great potential of fluorescent proteins for biological imaging in the future.382
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) biopolymers doped with fluorophores have been previously demonstrated as efficient luminescent polymers. ASE were recorded in double-layer systems, consisting of a biopolymer based matrix loaded with organic dyes and photochromic polymers.383,384 The lasing action was achieved via DFB configuration in photochromic polymers. The exponential gain coefficient was over 10 cm−1. The results showed that low threshold could be realized by the utilization of suitable surfactant in the DNA biopolymer system to form an efficient energy transfer system. Together with the enhanced fluorescence in DNA, this strategy could further endow the biopolymer gain media with promising lasing properties.
3.5 Summary
In this section, we have comprehensively summarized the recent advances in the field of organic gain media, including organic dyes, fluorescent semiconductor emitters, triplet gain media, biological materials, etc. fluorescent semiconductor emitters constitute the vast majority of gain media. Promising optical properties including low ASE/lasing thresholds have been demonstrated based on some specific building blocks, such as fluorene units, ladder-type (p-phenylene)s, p-phenylene vinylenes, etc. However, there is by far no general principle available to tell whether a particular organic material is suitable as organic gain media for lasing applications. It is still highly desirable yet greatly challenging to develop effective strategies to explore robust gain media for OSSLs, especially for electrically pumped OSLs.
Essentially, stimulated emission is based on the construction of quasi four-level lasing system. The fundamental mechanism for stimulated emission could be studied by theoretical calculation.244,245,305 The vibrational levels of the electronic ground states are simulated to get insights into ASE phenomena. The low-frequency modes result in uncontinuous energy levels, corresponding to distinct sideband, which is disadvantageous to the formation of the quasi four-level energy system. Enhanced vibration strength and vibronic peak intensity of high-frequency modes benefit for population inversion and the decreased ASE threshold, resulted from the distinct quasi four-level energy system. The ratio of high-frequency modes to low-frequency modes would provide a new insight into organic gain media. Another parameter to assess the gain media is radiative decay rate (kr), which is calculated from PLQY and transient lifetime.248,249 Usually, high kr in the gain media is expected to achieve low ASE threshold, which is beneficial for the fast four-level transition cycle in lasing. However, this method can hardly explain why no ASE phenomenon exists in some highly efficient fluorescent emitters.
Gain coefficient is another important parameter to evaluate gain media. As we summarized, VSL method has been widely used to evaluate the optical gains of organic semiconductors. In most cases, net gains are around 50 cm−1 for fluorescent emitters. Over 90 cm−1 net gain values have been achieved in ladder-type emitters.48,235,236 High gain would be much helpful to compensate the optical losses in the integrated semiconductor devices. As a result, gain media holding high gain coefficients are extremely desired for realizing high-performance organic lasers.
For the application in electrically pumped organic lasers, there are several critical demands required for the gain media, i.e., very low threshold that means low current density is needed under electrically pumped conditions; high thermal/optical stability to ensure long-time device operation; high optical gain coefficient that compensates the optical losses in electrical pumping device; high PLQY; high charge carrier mobility, etc. but it still remains rather challenging to simultaneously achieve all of the requirements in one emitter. The greatest difficulty is to simultaneously achieve low threshold, high PLQY and high charge carrier mobility in organic gain media, which not only exists for organic amorphous films, but also for organic crystals. Typically, ambipolar OLETs based on organic single crystals and thin films exhibit high PLQYs (>10%) but quite low carrier mobilities <10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.34,385 In contrast, high mobility ambipolar OLETs based on organic single crystals and thin films (>1 cm2 V−1 s−1) are able to reach current density over 1 kA cm−2, but they generally show very low PLQYs.386,387 New molecular design strategies are required to address this challenge. The development of efficient triplet gain media and triplet harvesters may be helpful for achieving electrically pumped organic lasers, since 75% triplet excitons could be utilized for stimulated emission theoretically.
4. The challenges towards electrically pumping organic lasers
Since the first OSLs discovered by Friend and Heeger in 1996,17,18 intense efforts have been made in this field, including gain media design, the high-quality feedback structures, the encapsulation technologies, CW lasers, etc. Although optically pumped OSLs have been dramatically improved in the last twenty years, it is still a challenge to develop electrically driven OSLs. In 2019, Adachi's group claimed the achievement of electrically pumped OSLs.23 In the following section, we will discuss the challenges and highlight breakthroughs in the recent efforts in electrically-driven OSLs.
4.1 Device design and the effect of metal electrode
OLED is by far a state-of-the-art technology, and active matrix OLED displays are entering the lighting market.388 The EQE higher than 30% in OLED devices have been reported in recent years.389,390 The challenge of OLED as laser diode structure is that the excitons would suffer from many paths for non-radiative transition under the condition of high current injection.391 The excitons might be annihilated in the high electric field by polaron interactions, and can diffuse and quench in the presence of nearby metal electrodes. Also the OLED structure gives high potential for absorbing the emitted photons by the opaque metal electrode layer. The efficiency roll-off is observed in the OLEDs at high excitation density, contributed by all of these factors.392,393 Estimating the excitation density to reach the lasing threshold, injected current density as high as 1 kA cm−2 is required.35,391 However, the operational current density of most OLEDs is still far below 1 A cm−2. Due to the relatively low conductivity of organic semiconductors, OLED devices generate strong Joule self-heating under high current densities, which would lead to thermal breakdown of devices. The self-heating as well as the efficiency roll-off could be relieved by using high thermal conductive substrates, such as sapphire,394 or patterning of the OLEDs.393,395 Recently, Solwik et al. introduced a new OLED concept with restructured layer sequence to concentrate and maximize the current flow in the metal-free emission area.396 Thus, the parasitic absorption by the metal electrodes is avoided and the drastically reduced dissipation power is achieved. High current density over 1 kA cm−2 is reached, and the operation voltage up to 75 V is achieved with Alq3:DCM as the emitter. However, the potentials of this new concept still needs to be further investigated in resonator geometries, such as microcavities, and the feasibility of this device structure for electrically driven OSLs remains yet to be explored.
Another widely studied device for lighting is OLETs, which combine the capability of light generation and the high charge carrier mobility of a field-effect transistor in a single device.385,397 Compared with OLED structure, the OLET geometry holds a variety of advantages, such as higher channel conductivity, planar architecture that allows micrometer-size emission, minimized exciton losses, gate-tunable emission-zone positions and charge-carrier balance, and even higher EQE.398
The conductivity of the ambipolar OLET is several orders of magnitudes higher than that of OLED. Therefore, the significantly enhanced population of the injected charge carriers occur in the active channel for recombination. Indeed, the current density values of OLET have reached kA cm−2 order of magnitude.386,399–401 Extremely high current density of 128 kA cm−2 was reported in thin films of copper phthalocyanine.400 The accumulated holes and electrons are balanced during operation in ambipolar regime, and the recombination zone is driven in the transistor channel, separated from the metal electrodes. The distance between the recombination zone and the metal electrodes is more than 300 nm, even in the carrier imbalance condition. It means the diffusion of the formed fluorescence excitons to the metal electrode will not happen. Therefore, the exciton annihilation resulted from the electronic device structure can be resolved. Moreover, OLETs hold the capabilities of operating at high current density while maintaining the luminescence EQE, indicating their minimum exciton loss paths.398,402
4.2 The impact of dipoles and charge absorption
Carriers (dipoles) themselves are critical sources of loss for electrically pumped organic lasers. Because of their broad absorption band, which could cover the emission, laser photons could be absorbed or singlet excitons could be quenched.391 Quantified explanation about dipole absorption is still rare. Rabe et al. used the spiro-bifluorene as the hole-transporting material to precisely measure the dipole absorption cross-sections. They found that the value of dipole absorption cross-section was very low: from 560 nm to 660 nm, σ < 2.6 × 10−18 cm2.403 The results demonstrated the interactions between dipoles were mainly dipole-exciton quenching rather than direct absorption of photons.404 The existence of electrodes and dipoles lead to low mobilities of organic semiconductors. As for the amorphous organic semiconductors, the carrier mobility is approximately within the range of 10−5–10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which means that a large number of dipoles must be removed in order to obtain high current density. The influence of dipoles can be minimized by using OLET devices, in which the accumulated holes and electrons are recombined in a long distance.
Another serious optical loss combined with electrical pumping is the charge-induced absorption (polaron absorption) (see Section 2.2). The absorption from charge excited states could prejudice the stimulated emission and gain, due to the long lifetimes of the charges benefitting for significant population build-up, and the region overlapping of the charge-induced absorption and the stimulated emission.32,39,405 This process can be neglected in a short-pulse optically pumped device, but in an electrically-driven device, the carrier-induced absorption would make it much less effective. Tessler estimated 1000 times as many polarons as singlets for a material with a mobility of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.406 In the well-designed experiments with either optical or electrical excitation, the study of charge absorption shows that the polaron absorption with a typically broad region is a critical issue for lasing.407–409
4.3 Effects of triplet excitons
The greatest challenge to realize organic laser diodes is probably the existence of triplet excitons. Due to the spin statistics, the 75% formed excitons are triplets.357,358 The long-lived triplet excitons result in the quenching of light amplification through triplet–triplet absorption and the reduction of the S1 population via STA resulting from the overlapping of the broad triplet–triplet absorption band and the singlet fluorescence emission band.32 The problem caused by triplet excitons can be studied with long pulse optical excitation. The experiments by Giebink and Lehnhardt showed that, lasing was completely inhibited within tens of nanoseconds after the optical pumping began in the guest–host systems (Alq3:DCM and F8BT:MEH-PPV), suggesting that the triplet-singlet annihilation and triplet–triplet absorption were the dominant factors to optical losses in the electrically-driven devices.410,411
In order to eliminate the influence of triplet excitons, the general strategy is to remove the triplet excitons by adding triplet quenchers, e.g., small molecule triplet scavengers (e.g., cyclooctatetraene412 and anthracene derivatives),145 and metal nanoparticles embedded in the gain media.413 Alternatively, triplet gain media and triplet sensitizers may provide an alternative pathway to resolve this problem, as discussed in Section 3.3.
4.4 The demonstration of electrically pumped OSLs
An electrically pumped OSL has been most recently demonstrated in an electroluminescent device, which incorporates a mixed-order DFB grating into an OLED device with BSBCz (124) as gain medium.23 As introduced in Section 3.2.2.3, BSBCz (124) is one of the best candidates for electrically pumped OSLs due to its nearly 100% PLQY, extremely weak production of triplet excitons, and negligible triplet–triplet absorption.21,248,251 Mixed-order DFB grating was selected with an alternation of the first- and second-order Bragg scatting regions to provide a sufficient vertical out-coupling of the laser radiation. The architecture of OSLD is presented in Fig. 18a. The engraved DFB gratings on SiO2 layer, which was sputtered on indium tin oxide (ITO), were fabricated with electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching. The fabricated OSLD held an inverted OLED structure with ITO (100 nm)/20 wt% Cs:BSBCz (60 nm)/BSBCz (124) (150 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (10 nm)/Al (90 nm). MoO3 layer was used for hole injection, and doping BSBCz with Cs promoted electron injection into the emission layer. The ηEQE–current density of an OLED and OSLD under pulsed condition (voltage pulse width: 400 ns; repetition rate: 1 kHz) at room temperature is shown in Fig. 18b. The efficiency roll-off was suppressed in the OSLD under pulse operation, and a maximum value of 2.9% of ηEQE was achieved with pulse current density increasing above 200 A cm−2 (Fig. 18b). Related to the thermal degradation, ηEQE of the OSLD device decreased rapidly when the pulse current density was above 2.2 kA cm−2.

The narrowed EL spectra of OSLD were recorded by increasing current density (Fig. 18c and d). A definite threshold from the slope efficiency of the lasing output was determined at a current of 600 A cm−2. Meanwhile, strong spectral narrowing with FWHM less than 0.2 nm occurred at 480.3 nm, suggesting the emergence of lasing (Fig. 18c–e), when the current density increased up to 600 A cm−2. The dependence of output power on current density is depicted in Fig. 18f. A maximum output energy of 5.0 mW was achieved with current density at 3.3 kA cm−2. As we emphasized and summarized, three aspects significantly contribute to the achievement of OSLD, i.e., the separation of the lasing output wavelength region from triplet–triplet absorption and charge absorption; the low lasing threshold which allows the relatively low current-injection for lasing observation in BSBCz (124) gain medium; and the optimized DFB architecture. Nevertheless, the manufacturing success rate of OSLD devices claimed by the authors was only 5% (in 500 devices). And also the output energy and operational lifetime still need to be optimized.
4.5 Summary
Since the first OSL was realized two decades ago, the researches and the attempts to realize electrically pumped organic lasers have attracted extensive interest. With the aim to attempt electrically pumped organic lasers, several aspects should be taken into consideration, i.e., it is necessary to optimize the device structure, to reduce the electrode absorption, to reduce (or recycle) the triplet state, to select the appropriate feedback structure and the gain media with outstanding stability, and to achieve low lasing threshold, high gain, high carrier mobility and so on.
5. Conclusion and outlook
To conclude, we have comprehensively summarized the research in the field of organic solid-state gain media. A variety of gain materials have been reported, including organic dyes, fluorescent semiconductor emitters, triplet gain media, and biological materials, covering a wide spectrum from UV to NIR. Some gain media are already commercial available, including some laser dyes, i.e. TDAF-1 (79), PFO (203), F8BT (225), MEH-PPV (238), and so on. Great achievements have been made in the field of organic gain media, including high PLQYs, low ASE/lasing thresholds, good thermal/optical stabilities, high gain values, and improved charge carrier mobilities. The optically pumped OSSLs have shown a number of applications, e.g., on-chip spectroscopy, information and communication technology, biomedicine, and low-cost sensing.
Although the first optically pumped OSL was reported in 1996, the electrically-pumped OLSD was not realized until 2019. Despite prominent device structures and the potential feasibilities for direct integration on flexible substrates, efficient and robust organic gain media for achieving electrically driven OSLs are still extremely scarce. For the development of OSLDs, the gain media should possess the important characteristics, i.e., low lasing threshold, high gain, excellent stability, and high charge carrier mobility. All these issues require a more thorough understanding of the roles of the chemical structures on the optical and electrical properties. Some design strategies, such as incorporating specific functional groups (e.g., ladder-type (p-phenylene)s and bis-styrylbenzene), introducing branched flexible chains, constructing triplet gain media and triplet harvesters, may be beneficial to the development of robust organic gain media for OSLDs. We hope that in the future, intense efforts will be paid to explore various successful ways to realize electrically pumped organic lasers and promote their practical application, inspired by the recent advancements.

Soffer and McFarland firstly demonstrated the organic dye for solid-state laser in 1967.13 The first organic crystal laser using anthracene as gain media was reported by Karl in 1972.14 Tang and VanSlyke demonstrated the first OLED using Alq3 as the emitter in 1987.16 In 1996, the groups of Friend and Heeger reported the solid-state conjugated polymer lasers by using PPV and PPV derivatives as gain media, respectively.17,18 In 2008, a polymer laser pumped by LED was proposed by Samuel's group using a fluorene co-polymer as the emitter.19 Lai and co-workers in 2009 reported a deep-blue laser with very low lasing threshold and high slope efficiency using monodisperse starburst macromolecular semiconductors as gain media.12 In 2011, the first observation of lasing behavior in a living system with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was reported by Gather and co-workers.20 Most recently, Adachi's group reported the quasi continuous-wave (CW) lasers based on 4,4′-bis[(N-carbazole)styryl]biphenyl (BSBCz) emitters, and near-infrared (NIR) thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters (boron difluoride curcuminoid derivatives) as gain media.21,22 An electrically pumped organic laser based on BSBCz as gain medium has been demonstrated by Adachi in 2019.23
