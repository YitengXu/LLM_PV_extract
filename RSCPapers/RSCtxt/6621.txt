While huge importance is given either individually or concurrently to the three fundamental steps, namely, light absorption, charge carrier separation and diffusion and charge utilization at redox sites, many aspects that are practically helpful to improve the efficiency are not widely discussed and practised. Nonetheless, by adopting a number of small, but significant changes, solar hydrogen production can be enhanced. The present review discusses such different approaches employed for photocatalytic water splitting reported in the literature. For example, an increase of up to two orders of magnitude in solar hydrogen generation was observed with a film form compared to the particulate form of the same catalyst. Discussion on various approaches of enhanced hydrogen production under sunlight and one sun conditions is the main focus of this review, in particular with thin-film forms. The merits and demerits of thin film and particulate methods, respectively, are addressed in detail. Potential methods and successful stories on scalability are also discussed in the present review. In contrast to charge collection over a long distance in solar cell-based methods, a film-based method discussed shows that the local charge utilisation at a zero applied potential is an attractive feature for SWS. A comparison is provided between the PEC-WS and SWS for solar hydrogen generation, and how far we are from the reality to produce solar hydrogen on an industrial scale. We believe the presently practised diverse evaluation efforts may be truncated to fewer methods such as film-based evaluation and in a focussed manner to tackle the SWS issue towards sustainable production of solar hydrogen.Chinnakonda S.

1. Introduction
A simple survey was made in Scopus to explore the number of papers that appeared in the area of photocatalytic water splitting. Fig. 1a shows the number of papers that appeared between 2000 and 2020 (till July 2020) for three sets of search terms: (a) photocatalysis or photocatalytic, and (b) water splitting, in combination with either (c1) hydrogen (red), or (c2) oxygen (blue), or (c3) hydrogen and oxygen (black). All the search terms are necessarily in the combination of title-abstract-keywords of the articles to get the correct number of articles or close to that, and ignoring all other factors. A step increase in the slope for all three search combinations from 2014 onwards underscores an increasing number of research efforts in the area of water splitting (with and without sacrificial agents) around the globe. Another survey (Fig. 1b) shows the maximum hydrogen yield reported first by photocatalytic water splitting under sunlight or one sun conditions, without considering many factors such as, employment of sacrificial agents.1 However, the highest value reported is under UV light in a 6 L reactor.2 Although solar hydrogen generation reports have increased in number over the last two decades, we believe, the area is at its ripe infancy and highly concentrated efforts are necessary to reach the breakthrough point. In spite of the proof of concept work published on 1972,3 why did the solar light-driven photocatalytic water splitting (with and without sacrificial agents) stay stagnant in efficiency is an important question ? There are many scientific reasons listed in the reviews that appeared in the recent past, which include increase in the light absorption from different wavelength regions of sunlight, manipulation of the band-edge positions of photocatalysts, increase in the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers, incorporation of photocatalysts with suitable conducting materials or co-catalysts such as graphenes, metals or metal oxides.4a–j,5a–f,6a–h Readers interested in such aspects may refer the above-cited reviews and related articles. The present review focusses mainly on different approaches employed for photocatalytic water splitting reported in the literature, especially towards enhancing hydrogen yield and scalable to larger areas under direct sunlight or one sun conditions.

These data were collected from Scopus with a particular set of keywords (see text for details) employed as search terms. (b) Maximum hydrogen yield reported by water splitting versus the year of report. Samples 1–5 tested under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) [ref. 1a–e]; Sample 6 is included to indicate the maximum hydrogen yield reported under UV light [ref. 2] and in a big reactor with 6 L solution. 
Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier because of its features such as clean energy, efficiency, environmental friendliness. Conventionally, hydrogen is produced with low-cost natural gas (or methane) steam reforming, which, in fact, is associated with other greenhouse gases (CO2, etc.) as by-products. Paris agreement, signed on April 2016 by 196 countries, mandates the decrease in global warming by emission reduction and, hence, reduces risk of climate change. Therefore, it is important to shift to use resources that are inexhaustible in the nature to produce green and clean fuels. In this context, SWS reaction under direct sun light is being considered as one of the promising paths for the production of hydrogen. However, there is a really long road ahead to reach the commercial-level success. One such possibility was described by Domen et al. recently.7 It is proposed that to obtain one-third of the projected energy requirements of the world population from solar energy by 2050, 10000 solar plants (each with an area of 25 km2) with solar energy conversion efficiency of 10% under AM1.5G irradiation would be expected to be sufficient. The total estimated area of 250000 km2 corresponds to 1% of earth's desert area, and the solar plants are expected to produce 570 tons per day of H2. It is important to highlight that, the photocatalytic process that produces hydrogen is replicating natural photosynthesis, where chlorophyll is known to be serving as a light absorber. In order to produce efficient solar hydrogen, a plethora of photocatalyst materials are developed and used by many researchers for the last few decades. Entire literature is replete with photocatalyst materials which are in powder form and the hydrogen evolution rate (HER) is reported from few hundred μmol h−1 g−1 to 100 mmol h−1 g−1. Less than 1% of published articles report HER of more than 10 mmol h−1 g−1 with one of the sacrificial agents. A careful reading of the recent literature reports reveals the following points:8–11 (a) there is more light scattering, than light absorption, with photocatalyst suspension; nonetheless, even poor quality thin film seems to have overcome this problem to a good extent.9 Hence, this allows more charge carriers to be generated from the first stage of light absorption in photocatalysis experiment. (b) Like solar photovoltaic panels, thin films exhibits high potential to be scaled up to larger size panels (say m2) and, hence, will be preferred for large-scale hydrogen generation. A simple painting method could also be adopted to fabricate photocatalyst panels.10,11 (c) With some design aspects, stirring issues can be eliminated with thin film/panel approach, which leads to energy saving; this is also likely to minimize material disintegration as there will be no mechanical force applied to the catalyst films. In this respect, most of the problems associated with powder suspension can be addressed for improved hydrogen generation with films. Based on the different approaches of photocatalytic hydrogen generation available in the literature, the present review discusses in detail about the problems associated with the traditional method of carrying out the photocatalysis experiments, advantages associated with thin film/panel forms of photocatalyst, and the scientific aspects behind that.
2. Basics of water splitting reaction
In principle, the water splitting reaction involves several photophysical and photochemical steps and they depend on the surrounding medium. At first, photon absorption initiates the first step by generating an electron–hole (e−–h+) pair (exciton), i.e., excitation of electron to the conduction band (CB) from the valence band (VB). The prerequisite for this step to occur is that the light energy used must be greater than the sum of the band gap and overpotential of the photocatalyst. Besides, the energy levels of CB and VB should be positioned appropriately with respect to the redox potentials of the photocatalysis reaction. For instance, the position of the CB minimum (CBM) or the bottom level of CB should be at more negative potential than the water reduction potential of H+/H2 (0 V vs. RHE), while the top of VB (VBM) should be more positive than the water oxidation potential of H2O/O2 (1.23 V). Apart from the bandgap engineering of material, it is to be underscored that effective light absorption with minimum light scattering is the key aspect, in order to produce more number of electron–hole pairs.9,12a,b It is to be noted that particulate catalysts have inherent problem of significant light scattering rather than absorption. Finally, based on the electronic structure of the material, the electron–hole pair should be separated and diffuse towards the respective redox co-catalyst sites present along with photocatalyst. The electron and hole, thus produced, are utilized for the reduction and oxidation reactions respectively, with available chemical species on the photocatalyst surfaces. A large number (>90%) of charge carriers undergo recombination due to the combined effect of (a) low lifetime (≈ns) associated with charge carriers along with their fast (≤ns) recombination and (b) large time scales associated with chemical reactions (μs–s); this leads to poor net redox reaction, and this is one of the major issues of photocatalysis. It is to be underscored that the role of the photocatalyst is very crucial to harvest the light effectively, produce active and large number of charge carriers and utilize them in the shortest possible time for efficient water splitting.
Generally, in the time scale of ns–fs,13 the charge transfer would take place to the surface followed by its interaction with available chemical species, leading to HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as follows: 2H+ + 2e− → H2(1) 2H2O + 4h+ → 4H+ + O2(2)
Electron–hole pair separation and diffusion play a predominant role in improving the efficiency of SWS. It is to be reiterated that charge recombination is faster (≤ns) than charge utilization. In order to overcome this aspect, several materials and strategies have been developed by the research community.4–6 In the next section, different strategies adopted for improving the efficiency of SWS, particularly powder-based photocatalyst approach, will be briefly discussed.
2.1 Hydrogen production with sacrificial agents
As indicated earlier, it is crucial to decrease the extent of recombination by separating the electron–hole pairs and diffuse them towards the redox co-catalyst sites. In this context, one of the strategies involved is the use of sacrificial agents. In general, organic molecules are used as the sacrificial agents in order to consume the holes, generated upon light irradiation, by involving them in photo oxidation. In the literature, a plethora of sacrificial agents such as alcohols, amines, sulphides are used for better HERs.14 It is important to note that the selection of the sacrificial agent is very important in order to produce efficient HER. The choice of the sacrificial agent is not just random, but it is of matching energy levels (VBM and CBM) of light harvesting photocatalysts with sacrificial reagents in order to provide the facile electron/hole transfer between them. In this regard, most of the chalcogenide-based photocatalysts such as CdS, PbS, ZnS, and MoS2, which are also known to be visible light-active materials, employ Na2S/Na2SO3 for high HERs. However, TiO2 and titania-based composites use alcohol compounds such as methanol, ethanol, and glycerol for better hole utilization and therefore better HERs. In the case of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), which is known to be one of the fascinating materials that works as a visible light-active material with a bandgap of ∼2.4 eV uses triethanol amine (TEOA) as a sacrificial agent for improved HERs because of the suitable band edge positions.5f How much amount of hydrogen is being produced from the sacrificial agent and water is still under debate! Moreover, while using sacrificial agents, it is also necessary to be careful to evaluate the ratio of green hydrogen produced to that of the oxidized product, such as CO2.
2.2 Overall water splitting
An ideal way of producing hydrogen is using water as the only reactant around pH = 7 with a suitable photocatalyst under direct sunlight; this is known as overall water splitting (OWS). While the HER and OER occur, as given in eqn (1) and (2), the rate of HER is far lower than that with a sacrificial agent. In fact, the HER values reported from OWS are at least 2–3 orders of magnitude lower (μmol h−1 g−1) than that of values reported employing sacrificial agents (mmol h−1 g−1). Four electron processes involved in the OER (eqn (2)) lead to slow kinetics and brings down the overall rate of OWS. In order to improve the overall kinetics of OWS and therefore achieve efficient hydrogen generation, several catalyst materials have been reported in the literature. In this context, Domen and co-workers and many others have contributed through a Z-scheme approach towards efficient hydrogen generation.15–24 However, the efficiency (∼1%) that has been reported till date is very low compared to the expected STH (solar to hydrogen) conversion efficiency values (∼10% and above) for commercial-scale hydrogen generation. We believe by following different approaches such as the thin film approach that there is a possibility to improve the overall rate of OWS. There are two methods generally used to measure the conversion efficiency of solar energy into hydrogen. Eqn (3) can be used to estimate the apparent quantum yield (AQY) by considering the amount of H2 produced to that of the number of incident photons, without considering the photon wavelength. (3)
From the above equation, the number of incident photons can be measured using a radiant power energy meter, which considers the following equation (eqn (4)): (4)
In the above equation, E is the energy of incident light, n is the number of photons, h is Planck's constant (6.634 × 10−34 j s), c is the velocity of light, and λ is the wavelength of incident light. From the above equation, one can measure the number of incident photons (n) while using cut-off filters of particular wavelength (λ) at the corresponding intensity of incident light (E) that was measured using a radiant power energy meter. Alternatively, the number of photons for any given wavelength range (say every 20 nm) can be calculated and summed up over the entire range of wavelength employed. This leads to a more precise value, known as solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion.
2.3 Limiting factors from achieving the high efficiency of SWS
It is practically impossible for any single semiconductor material to be an efficient SWS photocatalyst and perform all the three main steps of (a) light absorption from the wide wavelength range of sunlight; (b) charge separation and diffusion to redox sites, followed by (c) actual redox reactions. Invariably, it is a photocatalyst composite with a minimum of two (e.g. Pt/TiO2), three (e.g. Au/rGO/TiO2) (reduced graphene oxide-rGO) or more (Z-scheme photocatalysts) components. Very few researchers attempted to integrate the three main steps of photocatalysis by suitable synthesis strategies.25,26,12a
One possible strategy of improving the activity is integrating the charge generation sites and charge utilization (or redox) sites in a seamless manner via charge diffusion.4d In order to achieve this, it is necessary to design a highly integrated single composite material for efficient hydrogen production from SWS. A systematic increase in the complexity of the photocatalyst design of Pt-gC3N4–AuTiO2 (HER = 1.4 mmol h−1 g−1) outperforms SWS kinetics from g-C3N4 (<1 μmol h−1 g−1), gC3N4/TiO2 (91 μmol h−1 g−1), Au-gC3N4/TiO2 and (221 μmol h−1 g−1).27 From no activity with titania alone, the HER of 525 μmol h−1 g−1 was observed with an integrated Au–N–TiO2–graphene composite.28 Electronic integration of an Au–Pt bimetal cluster with titania was highlighted to be the reason for improved activity with 1275 μmol h−1 g−1 and sustainable activity for 125 h.29 A similar observation was made with Au–Ag or Au-nanorod on titania.30,31 It has been recently reported32,33 that the presence of heterojunctions between native and non-native structures, such as the existence of the anatase, rutile and brookite phases in a single titania nanotube material, with Pt as the co-catalyst exhibited high HER activity (∼7.6 mmol h−1 g−1) from SWS under one sun conditions than anatase-rutile (∼2.5 mmol h−1 g−1) or bare anatase (∼0.15 mmol h−1 g−1) nanotube titania materials. The activity difference is attributed to the presence of bulk heterojunctions in a composite material that can help for efficient charge transfer between the interparticles compared to a single junction (anatase-rutile) or bare anatase nanotubes. Independent of the photocatalyst systems, the results described in this paragraph indicate an increase in SWS activity from an insignificant value to 7.6 mmol h−1 g−1.25–33 In spite of the presence of all the essential components of the photocatalyst, the HER values are really low. A common thread connecting all these results is the evaluation of HER in the particulate form of the photocatalyst composite. A simple comparison of photocatalyst suspension and the same photocatalyst made into a thin film and kept in the aqueous methanol solution reveals (Fig. 2) the poor light penetration with the former, while the latter shows large light penetration.34 Whatever the angle of light incidence, light penetration would be poor with photocatalyst suspension. With this arrangement, the HER was measured with an Au–Pd/rGO/TiO2 photocatalyst in a particulate form, as well as in a thin-film form by simple casting on a glass plate. HERs observed from thin-film and particulate forms are 21.5 and 0.50 mmol h−1 g−1, respectively. Moreover, 43 times higher HERs observed with the thin film than the powder form demonstrate its superiority in terms of performance, especially due to light absorption.

Although there are many factors hindering the achievement of high efficiency of SWS, a list of critical limiting factors of SWS and some of the possible strategies to tackle them are given below:
(a) Very different time scales of photophysical (such as, light absorption and charge recombination; ≤ns) and photochemical (such as reduction and oxidation; μs–s) processes, and how to bridge them is the top limiting factor. Too high charge recombination is due to this single factor. Structural and electronic integration of photocatalyst components are highly essential to maximize the charge carriers for effective diffusion as well as utilization of them for redox reactions. 2D-layered materials and quantum dots (QDs) would be helpful to address the above-mentioned factor. Ref. 4–6 address this issue to a significant extent, and more work needs to be carried out. It is also worth noting that the nanoscience has contributed hugely to the fast growth of light emitting applications, due to the involvement of only photophysical processes. Synthesis strategies that would lead to bulk heterojunctions within a photocatalyst composite are highly desired. Methods such as SILAR (successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction) help in assembling QDs in the pores of wide bandgap material and hence leading to bulk heterojunctions, which is described later in Section 4.1.1.4.
(b) In general, the efficiency of any of the photocatalyst system decreases drastically while scaling up the catalyst amount, even from 10 to 100 to 1000 mg at a laboratory level, mainly due to poor light absorption coupled with high charge recombination.35 The present review addresses this issue in detail, through a photocatalyst thin film or a panel with enhanced hydrogen production.
(c) In general, OWS is performed under highly acidic conditions and it is critical to be able to perform the experiments around neutral pH (pH ≈ 7). Indeed, more research work needs to be carried out in this direction.
(d) To the best of our knowledge, there is no rational thinking on the choice of a particular co-catalyst for a given semiconductor, while noble metals are often employed, which is not cost-effective. More work need to be carried out to explore cheaper and earth-abundant co-catalyst with an emphasis on rational selection. Good amount of electrochemical research efforts are required.
(e) Use of sacrificial agents such as methanol has to be replaced with eco-friendly and/or biomass-derived agents such as glycerol and cellulose. Utilization of sacrificial agents in water splitting can be a short-term solution and OWS will be the ultimate solution.
(f) Although CdS, PbS and other chalcogenide QDs are widely employed due to very high visible light absorption characteristics and the ability to tune the bandgap, they are also not environmentally friendly and photo-corrosion prone. More efforts should be directed on the oxide-based QDs.
Thus far, in the context of the SWS reaction for hydrogen production, significant efforts were directed towards developing efficient systems. However, none of the photocatalysts meet the real-world requirement of hydrogen production. Indeed, none of the powder catalyst system has been evaluated at a gram scale under sunlight or one sun conditions. Some of the top hydrogen generation activity values reported with different powder-based catalysts are presented in Table 1. The current review focusses on the other important parameters that help to enhance the overall efficiency of the solar light-driven water splitting. In contrast to the particulate-based research, adopted widely by many researchers around the globe, a thin film-based approach is beneficial to increase the efficiency and the same is emphasized in the present review along with the associated fundamental aspects.

2.3.1 Mechanical stirring is no good. 
To improve light harvesting, the powder suspension should be constantly stirred, and it is a challenge to evaluate the photocatalyst powder on a large scale. Mechanical stirring provided at such heavy loads is energy expensive. After completion of reaction studies with photocatalyst powders, the collection of the catalyst using filtration and centrifugation is another energy-expensive and time-consuming process. Above all, the fundamental idea of improved light absorption does not seem to occur with the increase in the photocatalyst quantity in the suspension. Furthermore, as the catalyst quantity increases, the turbidity of the solution itself prevents the light from reaching all parts of the solution. Above all, the cost of hydrogen produced by conventional steam reforming methods is $3-4 per kg and any new method should be at least comparable to that to be considered. Typical solar cell making by a thin film approach would be beneficial for improved light absorption. In this context, many advantages and difficulties associated with thin-film and particulate forms, respectively, of photocatalysts will be discussed in the next sections.


2.3.2 Loading effect. 
It is expected that for large-scale production of solar hydrogen, it is necessary to increase the loading of catalyst amount in the solution. In this regard, Maeda et al.,35 investigated the loading effect on the quantum yield of hydrogen on a Z-scheme photocatalyst, with Pt/ZrO2/TaON as the hydrogen evolution catalyst and Pt/WO3 as the oxygen evolution catalyst. It was found that with the increase in the total catalyst loading from 75 to 150 mg, the AQY decreases from 6.3 to 2.7%, respectively. In contrast to the expected increase in light absorption with the increase in the amount of powder catalyst loading under typical solution measurement conditions, only a fraction of particles get exposed to photons at a given time and the remaining particles are inactive. In addition, the recombination of H2 with O2 in the solution under irradiation conditions also leads to lower AQY. However, with a small amount of catalyst in the testing solution, most of the particles are exposed to photons and thus produce more number of charge carriers, which contributes towards high efficiency. This is directly supported from the work reported by Nalajala et al.,9 that testing of 25 mg powder Pd/TiO2 in 40 mL of aqueous methanol produces low amounts of H2 (9 mmol h−1 g−1), compared to 1 mg of the same catalyst loading under similar conditions (∼32 mmol h−1 g−1). It suggests that when the amount of catalyst is very small in the solution, majority of the particles are exposed to light due to low turbidity and hence produce more number of active charge carriers. Indeed, it is apparent that with a powder catalyst, one cannot produce a large amount of hydrogen by simply increasing the catalyst quantity by traditional evaluation methods. Water splitting experiments carried out with small amount of catalyst (∼1 mg) and HER results given as hydrogen yield (HY) per gram catalyst would appear to be very high in number (Table 2). Hydrogen yield is reported per gram catalyst, irrespective of the catalyst amount employed in the actual experiments, by predominant number of researchers, and hence, care must be exercised. It is the desired practice to report the hydrogen evolution rate for few different weights for a given quantity of water or aqueous solution, and this will help other laboratories to reproduce the results. Nonetheless, this leads to the inevitable question of possible ways to handle bulk quantity catalyst for SWS and what is the best form to employ? This will be addressed later.

2.3.3 Scale-up and disintegration issues of photocatalysts. 
To achieve the sustainable hydrogen production from SWS, the catalyst system should be intact under reaction conditions. Especially, the catalyst system is expected to be stable for continuous exposure to light and aqueous environment. Any successful photocatalyst system is expected to be sustainable for many months and more than that. Currently, many efforts are involved in the development of photocatalyst materials in the particulate form. Table 1 shows some of the highest hydrogen generation activities reported with different catalyst systems; however, they are chosen (a) for their sustainability demonstration for at least 10 h under one sun (direct sunlight or visible light) conditions and (b) catalyst quantity employed for actual experiments should be a minimum of 10 mg and above. Even though the presented catalysts found to be active, very few studies have shown the stability for 100 h or more.36,37 A simple comparison between the results listed in Tables 1 and 2 reveals a contrasting fact. Up to an order of magnitude, higher HER values were reported with 1 mg catalyst quantity from the actual measurements (Table 2), compared to those listed in Table 1, which employ 10–200 mg catalyst. As suggested from Fig. 2, it is impossible to increase the activity linearly with the increase in catalyst quantity in a suspension form. Furthermore, there are few reports that show the activity reduction within 10 h of reaction, hinting the possibility of catalyst disintegration.1e However, it is established by Schröder et al.,10 the activity and stability of the thin film for an active day-light period of 30 days (see later sections for detailed discussion). Goto et al.11 studied the films for 1000 h. A stable photocatalyst was expected to retain the HER activity over a long period of time.

3. Physical chemistry aspects of light absorption and scattering
Although there are numerous semiconductor materials with a suitable band gap and band edge positions are available for SWS, effective light absorption in their powder form is an important issue. The Beer–Lambert law dictates the attenuation of light as a function of material thickness and wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient. However, it is generally assumed that good light absorption in a typical UV-Vis absorption spectrum is sufficient for its efficient light absorption characteristics. However, in reality the good quality and smooth solid surface absorbs solar light efficiently than rough surfaces and very poorly in particulate form. In fact light absorption with high absorption coefficient in the relevant wavelength range by the semiconductor photocatalyst is the first and the necessary step to produce a large number of charge carriers towards the desired activity.
As presented in Fig. 3, light is predominantly scattered from all the sides of particles (in suspension) compared to predominant light absorption on thin films with relatively smooth surface with high absorption coefficient. Even the rough surface thin film (Fig. 3-middle image) shows better light absorption than its particulate counterpart. A 50–500 nm rough surface structuring6f,9 can actually enhance the light absorption with thin films, and perfect smooth surface would reflect more light and hence not desired. Very smooth surface would require anti-reflective coating, which is employed in solar cells. The uniform particle size of photocatalyst leads to more light absorption. It is expected that one can produce more number of charge carriers from the thin film-based photocatalyst compared to the particulate catalyst. In the case of solar cells and photoelectrochemical devices, it is essential to have a smooth surface thin film with good necking of particles for the effective charge transfer5c through the bottom conducting FTO/ITO plates. Readers are suggested to refer the review by Osterloh for more details.6f There is also an optimum thickness required for the maximum light penetration and subsequent absorption. Light penetration depth (or skin depth) is defined as the reduction in intensity (or power) of light to 37% (13%) compared to the intensity (power) at the surface of the material. Indeed, this aspect has been studied very well in the case of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and the same arguments apply here too. A thickness range of 8–12 μm is optimum to absorb the maximum amount of incident light. A film with less than 8 μm thickness leads to lower light absorption due to the smaller thickness of the material. Films with more than 12 μm thickness lead to more recombination, since the charge carriers have to diffuse through the extra layers of materials present near the bottom FTO/ITO plate for solar cell applications. However, photocatalysis being a local phenomenon and especially without the need of charge carriers to move several microns,9 an optimum film thickness of 8–12 μm is sufficient to achieve the maximum light absorption and hence SWS activity.

4. Towards enhanced hydrogen production with a thin-film approach
In this section, various approaches that are effective for SWS such as thin film approach, including the preparation techniques for large-scale thin films and their photocatalytic activities and stability aspects, and re-absorption of emitted light for improved activity are described.
4.1 Thin film approach
A significant number of issues related to the particulate form of catalyst can be overcome by depositing active photocatalysts as films over a fixed substrate. Since the catalyst is fixed on the substrate with a desired thickness, better light absorption can be expected than its suspended powder counterparts in the solution. Mechanical stirring and collecting powder catalyst via centrifugation are avoided. Thin films can be operated with small amounts of liquid for reaction and certainly it is a less time- and energy-consuming process. Furthermore, the minimum infrastructure (small amount of materials and no costly equipment involved) and, thus, the ease of scale up can make this approach a possibly commercially viable option for sustainable hydrogen generation.

4.1.1 Thin film preparation methods and scale up. 
It is well known that thin film technology has a wide range of applications in science and technology such as electronics, optics, magnetism, and solar cells. The advantages of thin-film devices are low material consumption, and often flexible substrates can be used; these are difficult to achieve when the bulk materials were used directly for application. It also needs to be highlighted that the properties/activity of thin films are, often, dependent on the type of the deposition method. In general, chemical methods are viable for the deposition of large-area thin films because of simplicity, low cost and convenience for the deposition of a variety of materials. Although many photocatalysts are available, it is necessary to translate the laboratory-scale discoveries to a large scale to produce solar hydrogen. There are few ways of producing thin films of size/area ranging from square centimetres to square metres. In this regard, few methods are reported in the literature to fabricate films of different sizes such as spray coating, slot-die coating, and screen printing.54 Among these methods, screen printing and slot-die coating methods are used for large-scale solar cells (∼100 cm2). However, the preparation of the solar cells involves very controlled experimental conditions to produce high-quality thin films. In the case of solar cells, it is very critical to prepare high-quality thin films since the electrons have to flow for several micron range distances before reaching the back contact electrode; poor quality thin films leads to predominant recombination and hence it becomes less efficient. Indeed, solar cells of size bigger than 25 cm2 employ silver for better electron collection. Thus far, very limited number of reports is available for the film preparation from particulate precursor photocatalysts. Some of the literature reports on thin film preparations (drop-cast, particle transfer methods) of different photocatalysts are presented in the following section.
4.1.1.1 Drop-cast method. 
Xiong et al. implemented a drop-casting technique to form a thin film of a Rh2−yCryO3/(Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) photocatalyst on a flat frosted glass substrate.55 In order to study the porosity and hydrophilic nature of thin films, the authors added the silica powder of various particle sizes (from nanometres to micrometres) to the photocatalyst. The photocatalyst powder (20 mg) was suspended in 200 μL de-ionised water and sonicated until the formation of a uniform suspension. In order to understand the effect of porosity and hydrophilic nature of the photocatalyst, 20 mg of silica powder was added to the above mixture and kept for sonication. Subsequently, the suspension was drop-casted onto the clean frosted glass plate and kept for drying on a hot plate at 323 K. This process was repeated for 10 times to form a uniform thickness of the film.
In another study by Schröeder et al.,10 a Pt@mp-CN (Pt co-catalyst on mesoporous carbon nitride) photocatalyst was immobilized on a stainless-steel plate by a drop casting methodology over different dimensions of substrates such as 3.5 × 3.5 × 0.25 cm3 for the laboratory reactor, and 30 × 28 × 0.1 cm3 for the demonstration reactor, as shown in Fig. 4(I). The photocatalyst panels were used for solar hydrogen generation under direct sunlight. It is to be highlighted that Pt nanoparticles, prepared separately by a microemulsion method, were deposited on carbon nitride due to the negative zeta potentials of both Pt and carbon nitride. More details are available in ref. 56.

Goto et al.,11 demonstrated a 1 m2 size SrTiO3–Al panel (Fig. 4(II)) for large-scale hydrogen generation by following a similar methodology, as that of Schröder et al.10 The study emphasized on various aspects to improve the activity of panel-type catalysts for water splitting reactions such as titling angle (10–20°), water layer thickness (1 mm and 5 mm); these parameters are very important to minimize the weight of liquid and thus minimize the pressure to achieve smooth release of gas bubbles. A 1 mm-deep layer of water was capable for releasing hydrogen bubbles without forced convection. Importantly, this study11 highlighted that the crack formation did not impede hydrogen generation; unlike PEC cells and PV-based electrolyzers, where photocatalyst sheets do not form a series circuit in the panels. The photocatalyst panels prepared were studied for H2 generation from pure water under an artificial light source as well as direct sunlight.
Very recently, Nalajala et al.9 have designed thin films of titania-based photocatalysts (Pd/P25) over glass plates, and they have evaluated them for hydrogen generation under direct sunlight. A drop-cast methodology was utilized for the preparation of different sizes/areas of thin films (Fig. 4(III)). In their study, P25 (TiO2) was used as a light-harvesting material along with Pd as a co-catalyst, and methanol as a sacrificial agent to produce hydrogen. In 1 mL of ethanol, 1 mg of photocatalyst (Pd/P25) was added and sonicated for 30 min to obtain a uniform dispersion of the catalyst. This catalyst dispersion was drop casted onto the glass plate (1.25 × 3.75 cm2 area) using a 100 μL micropipette and dried under ambient conditions for 12 h. Bigger size thin films (2.5 × 7.5 cm2) were also prepared, as shown in Fig. 4(III). Like an earlier study by Goto et al.,11 micron-size crack formation on the thin films was observed (see Fig. 9); however, it does not hinder the activity of the thin film.

4.1.1.2 Particle transfer method. 
The particle transfer (PT) method was introduced for the preparation of thin films from the suspension of powder catalysts. In this method, a mixture of photocatalyst powders were suspended in isopropanol and deposited on clean glass plates of 3 × 3 cm2 size. Soon after the deposition of the catalyst suspension, it was kept for drying at room temperature to obtain a thin layer of catalyst film over a glass plate (Fig. 5). After drying at room temperature, the contact layer to make contact with semiconductor particles was formed by a vacuum evaporation technique. Any of the metals (Au, Ag, Al, Ni or Rh) can be used as a contact layer. Thereafter, in order to achieve the sufficient conductivity and mechanical stability of the prepared film, an additional Au layer was deposited over the pre-formed contact layer of the film by a vacuum evaporation technique. The metal film that constitutes particulate photocatalysts was bonded to a second glass plate using a carbon tape followed by lifting off the first or primary glass plate. The resulting glass plate was ultrasonicated for few minutes to remove any excess particulates piled on the photocatalyst sheet. This PT method was extensively adopted and reported by Domen and co-workers for a variety of particulate photocatalyst materials.15–22,57 The PT methodology (Fig. 5) was employed to design a SrTiO3:La,Rh/Au/BiVO4 system; Au was used as the contact between SrTiO3:La,Rh as a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP), and BiVO4 as an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP).15 The details of the hydrogen activity comparison between thin films (or photocatalyst sheets) and powder counterparts are mentioned in the later section. A main concern with this method of preparation is a possible disruption of thin films while removing (lift-off) the primary glass plate. Moreover, complex equipment requirement to form the metal contact layer is to be noted, which is necessary to facilitate the conductivity between the HEP and OEP particles.
4.1.1.3 Screen printing. 
Screen printing is one of the robust techniques that provides large-scale thin films with maximum material utilization. The production capacity of screen printing was determined by a drying and/or sintering process, and not by a screen printing process itself. Hu et al. reported that the screen printing (Fig. 6a) can provide the cells of 10 × 10 cm2 size with an efficiency of 10% and demonstrated its light soaking stability for 1000 h, outdoor stability for 30 days and shelf life stability for one year.58 Wang et al., also established this technique for the preparation of large-scale thin films using a powder photocatalyst.16 In their study, the printing ink was prepared from the mixture of catalyst powder (SrTiO3:La,RhBiVO4:Mo), Au colloid solution and organic binders in ethanol. After evaporation of ethanol, the paste was screen printed on a glass substrate of ∼3 × 3 cm2. Moreover, a 10 × 10 cm2 photocatalyst sheet (Fig. 6b) can also be prepared by this technique with different amounts of Au (up to 40 wt%). The screen printed sheets are subjected to OWS under simulated sunlight. Therefore, this technique also demonstrated the potential to provide devices for the large-scale hydrogen production under direct sun light. It is to be mentioned that the screen printing method was employed to make large-area solar cells, especially for DSSCs.59
4.1.1.4 Doctor blade method. 
The doctor blade method is a well-known method and widely used to prepare a uniform coating of wide bandgap semiconductor layers to make dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A well-mixed slurry that consists of a suspension of target materials (semiconductor or light absorbing materials) along with additives (such as cellulose) in a solvent was placed on a suitable substrate (usually FTO or ITO plate), and a constant motion of doctor blade was applied on the substrate. The slurry spreads over the substrate and forms a high-quality thin film upon drying and subsequent calcination (at 400 °C for TiO2 films). Depending on the amount of materials, area of the substrate, and speed of doctor blade movement, one can obtain different thicknesses of thin films in the micron range. The use of appropriate solvents and additives under optimized conditions of slurry is likely to provide high-quality thin films. This method of preparation is efficient at a laboratory level for small size, up to 10 cm2. However, as mentioned above, it can be extended to a larger size, possibly in combination with other methods and it is worth exploring. Sivaranjani et al. reported on the fabrication of N-doped mesoporous titania films (TiO2−XNX) for DSSC applications.5c Patra et al.60,61 reported on the quasi artificial leaf device fabricated with AuTiO2 thin films by a doctor blade method; this is further sensitised with chalcogenides (CdS, PbS, and ZnS) by a SILAR method. A simple and controlled dipping of doctor blade-prepared mesoporous titania films in a cadmium nitrate solution followed by a sodium sulphide solution allows the preparation of a single monolayer of CdS in the pores of titania. By repeating this procedure few cycles, well-defined quantum dots of definite sizes in a narrow range can be prepared. In addition, it creates a high quality heterojunctions between CdS and the substrate (TiO2), which is critical for charge separation. Indeed, this opens up an area of in situ assembling of light absorbing quantum dots in the pores of host material;60,61 in our opinion, the SILAR method should be extended to assemble active catalyst components in porous supports, which is not possible with any conventional methods. Thus prepared films are subjected to solar hydrogen studies after the deposition of the co-catalyst layer, which is intact with a semiconductor material.60–64


4.1.2 Role of binders in thin films. 
Organic and inorganic binders are generally employed while making the thin films, to keep the thin films intact on the surface of the substrate as well as to avoid peeling off. However, employing binders can also lead to undesired properties/activities. Few possible scenarios are listed as follows: (a) organic binders, such as cellulose, used in the doctor blade method are normally removed due to high-temperature calcination.60,61,64 The removal of binders at high temperatures helps to maintain the porosity of the thin films. However, if an organic binder is not removed, it could lead to oxidation of them under application conditions due to the availability of reactive oxygen species.65 Nafion was used as a binder in order to obtain stable and homogeneous thin films;10 in fact, Nafion helps to avoid the detachment of meso porous carbon nitride (mp-CN) from the stainless steel substrates. It is also to be emphasized that Nafion provides efficient proton conductivity, which, in fact, minimizes the mass transfer resistance inside the catalytically active layer. (b) SiO2 nanoparticles of ∼20 nm were used as inorganic binders to obtain SrTiO2:Al thin films over glass substrates.11 The essential role of silica nanoparticles was to prepare thin films that strongly adhere to the substrate. The catalyst and silica (1:2) suspension was coated and dried; this cycle was repeated several times and finally calcined at 623 K to get 10-20 micron-thick films. (c) It needs to be highlighted that even without binders, thin films with good stability are possible, which can be subjected to hydrogen generation studies. In fact, we recommend this method for the evaluation of the efficacy of any photocatalyst in thin-film forms. After initial studies, the same may be extended with a suitable binder. It is expected that the addition of binders would improve the stability of the film, which is important for HER studies. The role of binder should not decrease the inherent activity, rather aid the activity, and hence should be chosen carefully. The binder, if present in the final photocatalyst thin film, should also be chemically inert and should not undergo any reaction with charge carriers and in an aqueous medium in the presence of light. Indeed, one binder need not work for all semiconductors or composites and the amount of binder added also has to be optimized for any photocatalyst system.


4.1.3 Photocatalytic activity of sheets and films. 
This section is focused on the activities of thin-film photocatalysts with and without sacrificial reagents.
4.1.3.1. Overall water splitting with sheets and thin films. 
Xiong et al.66 reported that photocatalyst panels of Rh2−yCryO3/(Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx); (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) and Rh2−yCryO3 were employed as photocatalysts and co-catalysts, respectively. In this study, the catalyst and silica (micron size) mixture was deposited over 25 cm2 frosted glass plates using different techniques such as squeegee and drop-casting methods. The measured HER from the OWS activity of the panel-type catalyst (∼9 μmol h−1 mg−1) is comparable to that of the conventional method of testing photocatalysts in powder form (11 μmol h−1 mg−1). It was also found that the addition of micrometer-sized hydrophilic SiO2 particles avoids the problem of transport of water and product gases through the interparticle void spaces. It is to be noted that the particle size range of photocatalyst is 200–400 nm, and without any silica, the photocatalyst layers make water diffusion difficult. The main advantages are the possibility of scaling up the thin films and minimizing the mass transfer problems.
Wang et al.15 demonstrated high activities with particulate BiVO4 (OEP) and SrTiO3:La,Rh (HEP) semiconductors, which are immobilized as thin films onto metal layers (refer Fig. 5) for z-scheme water splitting. It is found that the thin-film form of the photocatalyst with an Au layer between them exhibits an activity of 4.5 μmol h−1 cm−2, which is ∼6 and 20 times higher than those of their corresponding powder counterparts (0.8 μmol h−1) and without metal layers (0.2 μmol h−1 cm−2), respectively, for OWS reaction in the absence of redox mediators. The high performance of the prepared system is attributed to the facile electron transfer between BiVO4 and SrTiO3:La,Rh through the metal layer (Au). Moreover, a decrease in overpotentials of H+ and OH− has been reported, since both HEP and OEP are presented near to each other. Therefore, the study emphasized that one can improve the activity with film-based systems by providing effective charge transfer via metal layer between the photocatalysts of the HEP and OEP, which in fact provide proper contact as well as hold the particles intact with each other.
In support of metal layer-attached photocatalyst sheets with improved activity, Wang et al.,16 carried their investigations with La- and Rh-co-doped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3:La,Rh) and Mo-doped BiVO4 (BiVO4:Mo) particulates embedded into a gold (Au) layer. Above z-scheme catalyst systems exhibit 1.1% of STH conversion efficiency with AQY of ∼30% and monochromatic light of 419 nm at pH = 6.9. Moreover, it is established that the electron transfer of SrTiO3:La,Rh/Au/BiVO4:Mo can be tuned by annealing the system (an optimum value obtained by annealing at 573 K for 20 min) and side reactions can be minimized by the surface modification with Cr2O3. Since H2 and O2 are produced in close proximity, it causes a severe backward reaction and it has to be minimized for the better activity of the prepared photocatalyst sheet systems. Therefore, these problems can be addressed by using carbon as a conducting layer in place of Au. In another study, additional rGO was introduced as a conductive binder to enhance the water splitting activity of the photocatalyst sheets.22 It was proposed that RhCrOx/LaMg1/3Ta2/3O2N acts as the HEP and BiVO4:Mo as the OEP and they are embedded with Au along with rGO. rGO acts as an additional mediator to conducting layer (Au) to bridge the HEP and OEP photocatalysts and thus ensure facile charge transfer. The performance of the photocatalyst sheet (RhCrOx/LaMg1/3Ta2/3O2N/(Au,RGO)/BiVO4:Mo) was ∼3.5 times (0.42 μmol h−1 cm−2) that of rGO-free counter parts (0.11 μmol h−1 cm−2), and it demonstrates that rGO effectively enhanced the charge transfer between the photocatalysts. It is to be mentioned that the powder counterparts of this system exhibited very less activity than that of photocatalyst sheets.
Oxysulphides are of interest due to their visible light absorption and better solar hydrogen evolution, and hence reported to work as a promising HEP part of the Z-scheme photocatalyst. In this context, recently Sun et al.18 have demonstrated a photocatalyst sheet from the combination of La5Ti2CuS5O7 (LTC) and BiVO4 as the HEP and OEP, respectively. In this study, the activity of this system was further enhanced after p-type doping (Ga3+, Al3+, Sc3+, and Mg2+) at the Ti sites and after the formation of La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1S5O7 (LTCA) solid solution for the OWS reaction. No activity was observed with the powder form of LTC/Au/BiVO4 with pure water; whereas in the sheet form significant activity (0.47 μmol h−1 mg−1) was observed under visible light irradiation. Higher activity (2.2 μmol h−1 mg−1) was observed with Ga-LTCA/Au/BiVO4 compared to LTC/Au/BiVO4 in pure water under visible light. Among the p-type doping elements, Ga3+ is shown to be a better dopant to improve the activity of the sheet. Moreover, the authors employed Cr2O3/M; M = Pt, Ru, Rh as co-catalysts to study the activity of water splitting reaction and found that Cr2O3/Ru is the most effective co-catalyst for the prepared photocatalyst sheets.
Goto et al.,11 developed a panel type reactor, where the Al-doped SrTiO3 catalyst was deposited as a thin film on a glass plate by a drop casting technique and evaluated for OWS reaction. The importance of doping Al3+ into the starting material is to enhance the activity of SrTiO3 and to control the particle growth. The photocatalysts were used along with RhCrOx as the co-catalyst. An important parameter that was focused during the study is the hydrophobicity and the hydrophilicity nature of the inner side of the window that was covered over the reactor setup (Fig. 7). It is found that the hydrophobic nature of the window allows the formation and growth of gas bubbles (Fig. 7 – photo on right); however, it does not affect the overall activity of the panel. Therefore, it is suggested that the use of hydrophilic nature of the window (Fig. 7 – photo on left) would avoid the accumulation of potentially explosive H2 and O2 gas mixture bubbles inside the reactor. The 1 × 1 m2 flat photocatalyst panel exhibited the STH of 0.4% under natural sunlight from pure water. The high rates of H2 and O2 were observed with 5.6 mL h−1 cm−2, which is equivalent to STH of 10% with smooth release of bubbles from the panel. It is to be noted that the STH of 10% was obtained by elevating the light intensity.11
4.1.3.2. Water splitting activity with oxidizing sacrificial agents. 
In order to reduce the recombination times of generated charge carriers (electron–hole pairs), one of the strategies is to employ sacrificial agents. Due to the rapid oxidation of sacrificial agents with holes, a very significant decrease in electron–hole recombination and hence an increase in HER was demonstrated. The selection of the sacrificial agents is based on the VBM of photo absorbing (semiconductor) materials, i.e., matching oxidation potentials of sacrificial agents with the VBM of SC materials in order to facilitate the facile hole transfer. For example, the hydrogen production is more efficient when Na2S/Na2SO3 was used as a sacrificial agent for chalcogenides and titania. Similarly, TEOA is being employed as a sacrificial agent for graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4); many sacrificial reagents (e.g. alcohols) have been used for titania-based composites or hybrid counterparts reported for better hydrogen generation. It is to be underscored that all hydrogen from the organic molecules are stripped, and they contribute towards total hydrogen generation. For example, when methanol is used as a sacrificial agent, the 2:1 ratio of hydrogen molecules are produced from methanol and water, respectively.4j In this context, there are reports based on hydrogen production using thin film catalysts in the presence of water/sacrificial reagent mixtures.
Schröeder et al.10 reported on immobilization of Pt@mp-gC3N4 over stainless steel plates for hydrogen production under direct sunlight in the presence of TEOA as a sacrificial agent. Extended measurements were conducted for 30 days using a lab-scale reactor and a demonstration reactor under artificial light and natural direct sunlight conditions, respectively, and the results are shown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. It was observed that the demonstration reactor under direct sunlight exhibits a higher average rate of hydrogen generation (0.22 L k W h−1) than the laboratory reactor (0.19 L k W h−1) under one sun conditions. The reason is ascribed to the temperature difference; while laboratory reactor temperature is maintained at RT, a significantly high temperature was observed under direct sunlight irradiation with a demonstration reactor. Furthermore, the HER activity obtained from immobilized Pt@mp-gC3N4 on stainless steel plate is 7-15 times higher (0.6 L m−2 h−1) than that of powder counterparts (0.04–0.08 L m−2 h−1); the reason is attributed to an inhomogeneous dispersion of powder catalyst in the suspension.56,67 From this study, it is emphasized that even though STH values from the panel type reactors is low (3–5%), it can economically compete with PEC technology that has 10% STH; in fact the later demands the use of complex design techniques to make photoanodes, which are more expensive and difficult to scale up.
Recently, Nalajala et al.9 have reported interesting aspect of solar harvesting through water splitting with well-known materials (Pd–P25 TiO2) in powder and thin-film forms prepared by a drop-casting method on normal glass plates (Fig. 4(III)). It is to be underscored that the Pd–TiO2 system absorbs only UV-light present within the sunlight and converts into hydrogen. Visible hydrogen generation was observed from all over the film made with 1 mg of Pd/TiO2 (coated over 1.25 × 3.75 cm2) (refer the video given in ref. 9 supplementary information); the hydrogen yield observed with the thin film is 12 times higher than the conventional method of measuring HER with powder suspension (9.1 mmol h−1 g−1 with 25 mg in 40 mL of aq. methanol). A reference experiment carried out with 1 mg of Pd/TiO2 powder suspension, but under static conditions, shows 3 times higher hydrogen yield (∼30 mmol h−1 g−1) than that of the suspension under spinning conditions.
Based on the activity results, it is suggested that the thin-film form of photocatalyst can use light effectively by light absorption compared to the powder suspension, where light scattering is more prevalent. A minimum amount of material with maximum light exposure is, indeed, beneficial towards increasing light harvesting and consequently the AQY. It is also to be underscored again that measuring the HER activity with a small amount of catalyst (say 1 mg.) leads to high HERs, than a larger amount of powder catalyst (25 mg). The average thickness of the thin film was about 8 ± 0.5 μm with 1 mg material coated over 1.25 × 3.75 cm2 (Fig. 9). Attempts to increase the thickness with a larger (2 mg; 14 μm) amount of catalyst resulted in a marginal increase (10%) in hydrogen production. However, attempts to decrease the thickness with a smaller (0.5 mg; 5 μm) amount of material decreased the rate of hydrogen production substantially by 40%. Light penetration and light absorption occurs effectively within 8–12 μm thickness of material, which is also demonstrated for DSSC. The same principles apply to SWS. The SEM studies with a Pd–TiO2 thin film (Fig. 9a inset) show the appearance of 10–20 μm crack/gap over the films. Even though many cracks are visible, it does not hinder the hydrogen evolution from the thin film, and this is in good correspondence with the results obtained by Goto et al.11 Less than 1 μA cm−2 photocurrent observed indicates the poor quality of the device, reported in ref. 9; however, large hydrogen production with direct sunlight demonstrates the local utilization of charge carriers (within an area of few hundred square nanometres), which were being generated during the light harvesting. As the electrons are utilized in a small range of surface area, recombination is minimized, and hydrogen generation is observed all over the film in the movie (given in ref. 9). Indeed, it is an important finding, and different from PEC water splitting. Any gap/crack/break in the solar cell would affect the electron collection characteristics, which, in turn, hinders the hydrogen generation at Pt (or any other) counter electrodes. Unlike DSSC, PEC, solar cells where the charge carriers need to travel a relatively long distance (several microns) to reach the back/bottom-contact to produce more current, thin films provide instantaneous charge utilization and thus produce abundant and visible hydrogen bubbles throughout the film. Therefore, it is not an issue to prepare thin films of particulate photocatalysts even with cracks and therefore it can be scalable for large-scale hydrogen production. Nonetheless, drop-casting prepared films should be evaluated for sustainability and film stability for longer hours.9
Recently, Tudu et al. have demonstrated a similar thin film work, but with a cheaper co-catalyst. Thin films prepared with 1 wt% of Cu–Ni (Cu:Ni = 1:1) bimetal co-catalyst on TiO2 exhibited 24 times higher hydrogen yield (41.7 mmol h−1 g−1), than that of its powder counterpart (1.75 mmol h−1 g−1). Higher activity is attributed to improved absorption of visible light and an effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers at the interface of Cu–Ni/TiO2 leading to better charge carrier utilization.68 Lin et al.69 designed a floating sheet that comprises a carbon foam (CF), nano diamond-embedded Cu2O (NEC), and WS2 as the substrate, photocatalyst, and co-catalyst, respectively. The features of CF are hydrophilic in nature and light weight that can float on water. Moreover, the photocatalyst along with the co-catalyst can be integrated into this network to utilize light effectively and one can easily separate this system from water using a tweezer for recycling. This artificial photocatalyst system NEC/WS2/CF exhibited ∼13 times better activity (64.85 mmol h−1 g−1) than their powder dispersion photocatalyst system (4.9 mmol h−1 g−1) in the presence of a water/lactic acid mixture under AM1.5 irradiation. Moreover, the floating sheet activity was demonstrated for 33 h, indicating the sustainable character.


4.1.4 Quasi artificial leaf concept with a novel design of solar cell materials and devices. 
Artificial leaf concept is well known for water splitting; however, Trevisan et al.70 and Patra et al.60,61 utilised the quasi-artificial leaf (QuAL) concept, in which one of the charge carriers, electrons, are collected and utilised for hydrogen production at the Pt-co-catalyst site and holes are directly injected into the solution to oxidize sacrificial agents. Based on the QuAL concept, solar cell was fabricated with porous titania (or Au–TiO2) and Pt as the counter electrode.60 PbS and CdS quantum dots were assembled in situ in the pores of titania, by adopting a SILAR method. Distribution of PdS and CdS quantum dots in the solar cell from top to bottom layers of titania was demonstrated by FESEM-EDX chemical mapping method (Fig. 10). The main advantage of using the SILAR method (assembling QDs) in this device is to generate abundant bulk heterojunctions between chalcogenide quantum dots with a porous Au–TiO2 matrix. Even though the total content of chalcogenide is <3%, but they are distributed uniformly throughout the porous matrix in the photoanode, which helps to convert light very effectively into chemical energy through efficient charge dispersion. Porous titania also helps better light absorption due to possible internal scattering, within the QuAL device. A solar cell thickness of 8 μm (Fig. 10a) is optimum for light penetration and maximum absorption.

EDX result shows the uniform distribution of chalcogenides, and Au on TiO2 in Au–TiO2/PbS/CdS photoanodes. Reproduced from ref. 60. Copy right 2017 Springer Nature publishers. 
Two important advantages of the QuAL solar cell are listed below: (a) a combination of different band gap semiconductors along with nano gold absorbs the entire region of UV and visible light along with limited NIR range wavelengths. (b) QuAL device does not require any potential and works at zero applied potential. Here, 2 mg of photoanode material (AuTiO2/PbS/CdS) was coated over 1 cm2 produce 12 mL h−1 H2 under one sun conditions. A linear extrapolation of the results to large-sized photoanodes, say 23 × 23 cm2 and 46 × 46 cm2, could lead to 6 and 24 L h−1 H2, respectively.60
The QuAL concept was further extended to produce a larger amount of hydrogen by employing a novel idea by Patra et al.61 The efficiency of the photocatalyst is invariably low due to the large extent of charge recombination and often it leads to radiative emission and observed as fluorescence. Self-absorption of emitted light is a frustrating issue in light-emitting diode application, as it leads to lower efficiency. However, this problem was utilized as an advantage to generate more number of charge carriers for water splitting and hence more hydrogen production. In the QuAL approach, Mn-doped CdS quantum dots is assembled by the SILAR method in the mesopores of titania.61 The Pt or Ni–Cu alloy was used as a co-catalyst. Here, 16 mL h−1 (10.5 mL h−1) H2 was observed with the Pt (Ni–Cu) co-catalyst under one sun conditions. It is to be noted that not only HER is more compared to their earlier work with the Au–TiO2/PbS/CdS-based device, but the device is devoid of costly gold and PbS.61 Conclusive support was obtained from the photoluminescence analysis, and its comparison with UV-Vis absorption spectra is shown in Fig. 11. It is found that there is significant overlap in absorption and emission features (recorded with 420 nm excitation source); a small and big grey colour triangle shown in Fig. 11 indicates the same for TiO2/CdS and TiO2/Mn–CdS, respectively. White light-like emission was observed for TiO2/Mn–CdS, when the excitation source employed was 400 nm (Fig. 11 – inset).
 Fig. 11  Photoluminescence spectra of TiO2, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/Mn–CdS recorded with a 420 nm excitation source; emission features are normalized. UV-visible absorption spectra recorded for all three materials (given in dashed line in the same colour) are also compared with photoluminescence. An overlapping wavelength region between absorption and emission spectra is shown in the figure by a solid triangular area highlighting the secondary light source available for absorption by chalcogenides. About three times larger triangle area with TiO2/Mn–CdS than without Mn hints more reabsorption of emitted light. The inset shows the photoluminescence spectra of TiO2, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/Mn–CdS recorded with 370 nm excitation wavelength. Reproduced from ref. 61. Copy right 2019 RSC publishers. 

Fig. 11 demonstrates the possibility of self-absorption of emitted light as a secondary light source to produce more charge carriers and hence more H2 generation. Absorption of in situ emitted light is considered to be effective, as the solid lattice is at the emitting centre and it may be considered as equivalent to field effect associated with surface plasmon. In this context, the white light emission was demonstrated by Nag et al. by doping transition metal ions (Mn2+) in the CdS semiconductor host.71,72 In fact, the life time of the spin forbidden transition of Mn2+ d electrons was found to be of the order of milli seconds. Therefore, these long lifetime electrons lead to enhanced charge utilization to provide efficient hydrogen production under sunlight illumination with the Mn–CdS–TiO2 system described previously.61


4.1.5 Advantages with thin films over particulates for photocatalysis of hydrogen generation. 
It is necessary to highlight several advantages associated with a thin-film form over particulate form, which is likely to motivate the research community to consider conducting systematic studies with the former for efficient solar hydrogen generation. Following points are worth highlighting:
(i) Light absorption vs. light scattering: the very first step of effective light absorption in photocatalysis is more with films, rather than particulate suspension, as shown in Fig. 2 and 3. With effective and uniform light absorption, a large number of charge carriers are generated with thin films. In the case of thin films, the photocatalyst is fully and equally exposed to the photon source to the entire time period, and it paves the way to generate abundant charge carriers from the film. This is evident from the video representation of solar hydrogen, which is reported in the literature (supplementary video in ref. 9).
(ii) Minimum material, maximum activity and continuous process: it is to be underscored that in photocatalysis measurements with a particulate suspension with the increase in catalyst content, there is a severe reduction in hydrogen yield. Indeed, this is observed even at milligram levels (Tables 1 and 2) and it is very unlikely to be scaled up in a suspension form. However, with an optimum thickness (8–12 μm) of the thin film, high hydrogen yields are produced. Up to an order of magnitude higher activity observed with the same quantity of the material in the thin film form than the powder demonstrates the maximum activity with minimum material in the thin-film form. Furthermore, the thin film makes the process continuous, in contrast to the batch process with suspension.
(iii) Energy saving aspect: the operating cost of thin film-based panels is expected to be significantly low due to avoidance of mechanical stirring, which may be centrifugation for catalyst removal in the next batch/recycle. However, those will be associated with suspension and hence there is a cost/energy factor.
(iv) Running cost: it is also to be highlighted that 1 mm water (or solution) layer thickness is sufficient for solar hydrogen generation with thin films and hydrogen bubbles are released smoothly. However, the water layer thickness may be decreased further to a fraction of mm, through suitable engineering designs of the reactors. This will be important with highly efficient catalysts, which would produce continuous bubbles of hydrogen without any resistance. Low thickness of water layer facilitates the smooth/instant release of bubbles. It is to be noted that slow bubble growth hinders the light absorption by the catalyst, as bubbles tend to scatter the light significantly.
(v) Integration of various material components: artificial leaf and QuAL concepts offer to incorporate several components in one device, such as incorporation of different light absorbing quantum dots, co-catalysts for reduction and oxidation reactions. Hence, the (structural and possibly electronic) integration of several material components is taken care in this approach, whereas it is difficult to accommodate all of the above-mentioned factors in a uniform manner throughout the particulate bulk catalyst.
(vi) Mass transfer issues: mass transfer of reactant(s) uniformly throughout the film/panel device is more of an engineering challenge. However, as there is no pressure required and just a millimetre thickness of liquid water (with or without sacrificial agents) is sufficient to generate hydrogen, a simple tilting mechanism may be employed to circulate the solution with gravity force. In fact, tilting could be combined with solar tracking suitably, so that hydrogen yield can be maximized.

5. Commercial viability of solar hydrogen
It is predicted that the production of hydrogen using PEC technology is more expensive ($10.4 per kg) than from the particulate suspension ($1.6 per kg) for water splitting.73 The expensiveness of hydrogen production from PEC is ascribed to the high capital cost ($154.95 per m2), while it is only 1.5% that of PEC ($2.21 per m2) for particle suspension for a plant size of 1 ton per day (TPD) hydrogen net production.73 Due to large and poor light absorption with films/panels and powder/suspension, respectively, the above numbers may be revisited. Nonetheless, it is also underscored that the contribution for the fabrication of PEC cells is ∼89%, while it is only ∼19.8% for particles of the total capital cost. It is known that PEC technology is more expensive than particulate suspension, since the former constitutes multi-layers of different materials; semiconductor layer(s) for light absorption, co-catalyst for charge utilization to generate products, interface layers to provide contact between semiconductor and co-catalyst and finally proper integration of them towards efficient water oxidation. Moreover, to fabricate that many layers of photoelectrode materials with proper contact among them, the preparation method of photoelectrode demands the sophisticated/expensive techniques such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Even though the cost-effective hydrogen production is possible with particle suspension, severe barriers are to overcome, such as (i) light scattering and low absorption coefficient of light, and hence lack of understanding on solar flux utilization by the particles; (ii) uncertainty in plant operation because of safety issues due to cogeneration of H2/O2 gases, and (iii) poor access of solar light to deeper particles in the bed and it leads to poor performance of the system. In order to overcome many of the problems listed above, it is suggested to employ particulate catalysts in the film form for effective utilization of light. Moreover, the preparation methods of thin films of active particulates do not involve any sophisticated infrastructure and hence low capital cost would enable a significant reduction in cost of hydrogen production.
Even though the PEC method for solar hydrogen production with 10% of STH could be competitive compared to the conventional methane reforming, PEC-WS has to overcome many scientific and technical barriers, before it can be considered for large-scale operation.73 Some of them are as follows: (i) need to enhance the light absorption by the design of low-band gap material and by adding one more light absorbing layer over the photoelectrode. (ii) It is necessary to reduce light reflection from the photoelectrode by antireflective coating; (iii) need to engineer the nanostructural properties and doping levels in order to reduce the recombination; (iv) need for surface reconstruction and design of passivation layers to minimize the surface recombination; (v) finding the suitable materials with matching energetics for efficient charge separation; (vi) to overcome the stability issues, efforts are necessary to design protective layers, to tune the electrolyte compositions and semiconductor structures; (vii) the production methods of photoelectrodes at a commercial scale are really a challenge due to significant number of highly controlled experimental conditions along with high vacuum requirements. It needs to be highlighted that some of these barriers (i, iii, iv, and v) are also applicable to thin film photocatalysis, except the antireflective coating (ii), and the preparation of the electrodes (vii). In addition, the cost-effective SILAR method offers to assemble the light-absorbing components in the pores of wide-band gap semiconductor and minimizes the charge recombination and partially addresses point iv.
It has also been recently speculated that PEC of water splitting is heading towards obsolescence. It is indicated by Jacobsson et al. that the development of PEC-WS systems is no longer worth doing because remarkable development has been achieved in the field of silicon PV technology.74 An important reason for not to favor the PEC-WS is that the hydrogen production cost is much more even with 10% STH conversion efficiency than solar PV technology with 15% conversion. The ideal scenario for viable PEC-WS technology is to find the photoabsorber with all the desired features such as suitable bandgap, band edge positions and stability, which drive all the functions, such as light absorption to catalytic reaction. Practically, it is very difficult to find the photoabsorber with hydrogen production along with stability. It needs to be highlighted that thin-film photocatalysis with 3–4% efficiency may be economically competitive with PEC-WS with 10% STH conversion efficiency because of low material and equipment costs compared to the later. While the thin film approach is used in PEC, bias applied and material making by sophisticated methods increases the cost of such devices. It is to be emphasized that the simple approach, like artificial leaf, without any applied bias and simple (thin film) preparation methods is likely to lead to better results. While Jacobssen's view is intriguing,74 the Si PV production technology is a well-known highly polluting industry. Very soon, recycling of Si PV panels will become an environmental issue. In fact, the green energy tag associated with Si PV is realized by many to be the contrary. Hence, we need to keep working on finding the real green solar technology. It is also good to have competing energy conversion technologies, even at different price tags, for operational reasons.
6. Conclusions and future outlook
The present review discussed significantly different approaches with enhanced solar hydrogen production and emphasised on thin film-based methods. Various methods of improving the activity in case of photocatalytic water splitting were reviewed. Thin-film (or panel) forms of particulates would certainly be a better form of the catalyst and they are already demonstrated to be scalable, apart from activity. The films are capable of producing up to two orders of magnitude higher amount of hydrogen than their powder counterparts. The reasons are as follows: (a) effective absorption of light with low light scattering; (b) the local utilization of charge carriers in few hundred square nanometres for hydrogen generation through water splitting. In solar cells and DSSCs, the charge carriers generated need to travel several micron (8–14 μm) distance to generate current. In this regard, it is highlighted that the large-sized photocatalyst panels, described in the present review, may provide an alternative and sustainable route to generate hydrogen production. In contrast to photoelectrodes which require very expensive technology, the preparation of large-sized photocatalyst panels is cheap and its unique feature of local utilization of charge carriers is an added advantage.
It is to be noted that there is 3–4 orders of magnitude difference in H2 production between OWS and with sacrificial agent, with latter displaying the high rate of H2 production. Molecules like glycerol may be used for short-term applications, as it is available abundantly, due to biodiesel generation through transesterification. Nonetheless, focus should be on OWS and increasing its STH efficiency. Experiments conducted in direct sunlight increases the solution and catalyst temperature and it is prudent to take advantage of this fact to increase the rate of H2 production. In any case, water splitting experiments should ultimately be carried out in direct sunlight. It is also essential to make use of 4–5% UV light present in the sunlight. Ultimately improved device efficiency is the main driver for reducing the overall price. Hence, we suggest the practitioners of photocatalysis to carry out the future experiments with thin films under direct sunlight.
We believe that nanoscience is yet to make a real impact on solar light-driven photocatalysis. In spite of tremendous progress in nanoscience and materials science in the last few decades, how to make use of those results in a suitable way for solar hydrogen generation through photocatalysis is a real challenge. Some success stories are highlighted in this review, such as in situ assembling of light absorbing semiconductor quantum dots in the pores of substrate, which leads to efficient charge separation through heterojunctions. In our opinion, bridging the huge difference in the time scales of photophysical and photochemical processes can be possibly addressed by utilizing nanoscience and nanotechnology in a prudent manner. We also believe that there are plenty of ways to make use of nanoscience; concerted efforts are required, and it is likely to lead to a solution to economically viable and scalable water splitting to produce large-scale hydrogen.
