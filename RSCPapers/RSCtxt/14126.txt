    , Accepted 6th February 2019First published on 14th February 2019AbstractThe carrier type and concentration of a semiconductor are intimately associated with the kind and density of point defects possessed within itself. And two-dimensional SnS intrinsically exhibits a p-type semiconductor behavior, which is correlated with Sn vacancies. Here, we present tuning the hole concentration of SnS in a wide range of 1016–1019 cm−3 through a cationic lattice site vacancy engineering strategy, by simply changing the molar ratio of raw materials, i.e., SnCl2versus Na2S·9H2O. The thermoelectric properties of these Sn vacancy engineered SnS samples were investigated. Combining the significantly improved power factor due to the increased hole concentration with an intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity arising from lattice anharmonicity, a respectable zT value up to 0.8 at 873 K could be achieved in polycrystalline SnS. This work demonstrates that low-cost and easily fabricated SnS is a promising candidate for thermoelectric application, despite it usually being considered as a low-asymmetrical crystal with a relatively large band gap (∼1.1 eV).
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) crystals with strong in-plane bonding and weak out-of-plane interactions exhibit unique and anisotropic physical properties, leading to promising applications in diverse fields.1–6 Among the family of 2D materials, the low-temperature phase of SnS crystallises in orthorhombic structure (Pnma, below 858 K) with lattice parameters a = 11.18 Å, b = 3.98 Å, and c = 4.33 Å, which is built by covalently bonded double layers of alternative Sn and S atoms, while the adjacent layers are connected by weak van der Waals interactions and long-range electrostatic forces.3,4,7 The crystal structure of orthorhombic SnS viewed along the b-axis is shown in Fig. 1. The layered structural feature makes it a candidate for application as a high-capacity anode material in Li/Na ion batteries.8 And SnS with a tunable bulk band gap (∼1.0–1.35 eV for the indirect band gap and ∼1.3–1.6 eV for the direct band gap) shows a strong absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1), paving the way for application as an excellent absorber used in solar cells, photodetectors, active photocatalysts, etc.9–16 Also, the strong anisotropy of monolayer SnS leads to rich physical properties, such as giant piezoelectricity, strong ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity.17–21 Recently, owing to its electronic band structure being similar to that of SnSe with a low energy difference between the first and second valence band maxima (0.07 eV for SnS and 0.06 eV for SnSe), and the intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity originating from the strong lattice anharmonicity, low-cost and ecofriendly 2D SnS consisting of earth-abundant elements has been attracting increasing attention in the thermoelectric field.22–33

The energy conversion efficiency of a thermoelectric material is tailored by the figure-of-merit, zT = S2σTκtot−1, where S, σ, κtot, and T are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, total thermal conductivity, and absolute temperature, respectively. So an excellent thermoelectric material should be a result of the trade-off between a large Seebeck coefficient, a high electrical conductivity, and a low total thermal conductivity. As the low thermal conductivity and large Seebeck coefficient could be readily achieved in SnS, special attention should be paid to its inferior electrical conductivity due to its low-grade hole concentration (1016 cm−3), which results in an extremely low peak zT value of 0.16 at 823 K for nearly intrinsic SnS.32 Recently, the hole concentration of SnS has been successfully improved to ∼2.7 × 1018 and ∼2.0 × 1019 cm−3 by Ag and Na doping, respectively, which leads to a significantly enhanced peak zT value as high as 0.6 and 0.65 in the corresponding polycrystalline samples.30,31 Also a much higher value of zT up to 1.0–1.1 at ∼873 K has been realized in Na-doped single crystal SnS due to its relatively higher hole concentration and mobility.27,28 These achievements demonstrate that the 2D SnS is a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications.
Besides foreign element doping, the carrier concentration could be tuned by intrinsic defect modification. For example, Cu-deficiency or Cu/Bi dual vacancy modulation in BiCuSeO not only increased the hole concentration, which turns into an evidently improved electrical conductivity and power factor, but also dramatically lowered the lattice thermal conductivity, resulting in an enhanced peak zT value exceeding 0.8.34,35 Similarly, by introducing the Sn vacancies into the SnSe matrix, the hole concentration could be increased to 1019 cm−3, also achieving high peak zT values of 1.3–2.1 in polycrystalline SnSe.36,37 These results motivated us to increase the hole concentration in SnS by a cationic site vacancy engineering strategy.
In this article, we mainly focus on the p-type thermoelectric performance of chemically synthesized SnS nanoflakes. The hole concentration, strongly associated with Sn vacancies, could be systematically tuned from 1016 to 1019 cm−3 by simply changing the molar ratio of starting materials (SnCl2versus Na2S·9H2O) from 1.1 to 0.8. As a result, the electrical conductivity and power factor were significantly enhanced, leading to a high maximum zT value of 0.8 at 873 K in the Sn vacancy modulated samples with a hole concentration exceeding 1019 cm−3. SnS nanoflakes presented in this work are valuable for extending the scope of 2D SnS materials and for their great potential applications in thermoelectric or other fields.
Experimental
Materials and methods

Chemical reagents. 
Tin(II) chloride (SnCl2), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O), ethylene glycol (EG), and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O, 80%), were purchased from various sources. All of the chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification.


SnS nanoflake synthesis. 
SnS nanoflakes were synthesized via a glycol method, which is similar to a method reported in our previous works.38–40 For a typical synthesis, 50 mmol Na2S·9H2O and 50 mmol SnCl2 were dissolved in 200 ml and 300 ml of EG at 150 °C in a beaker and a 1000 ml-capacity three-neck round-bottom flask, respectively. Both of the solutions would become transparent in about 15 min. Once the Na2S–EG solution was poured into the flask, black precipitates formed immediately. Then 10 ml of N2H4·H2O was added into the reaction system. The flask equipped with a coiled inner tube Graham condenser was put on a heating mantle and maintained at 220 °C for 12 h under vigorous stirring, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The aged precipitates were collected after washing using absolute ethanol, and filtered, and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for several hours.
To adjust the concentration of Sn vacancies in the resultant SnS precipitates, the molar ratio of SnCl2 to Na2S·9H2O was orderly varied from 1.10 to 0.80 with a step of 0.05. And the corresponding samples are denoted as Snx (x = 1.1, 1.05, 1.0, 0.95, 0.9, 0.85, and 0.8).


Fabrication of bulks. 
The cylindrical bulk samples with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of ∼12 mm were fabricated from the powder samples using a spark plasma sintering (SPS; SPS-625, Fuji Electronic Industrial Co., Japan) technique at 550 °C for 3 min at ∼50 MPa in a vacuum (below 10 Pa). The as-sintered cylindrical bulk samples were processed into bars (∼2 × 3 × 9 mm3) and square slices (∼6 × 6 × 1.2 mm3) through cutting and polishing for electrical and thermal property measurements, respectively.

Characterization
The crystal structures of the samples were examined using a powder diffractometer (PANalytical X’pert Pro MPD, CuKα, λ = 0.154 nm) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The morphology of the as-synthesized powder samples was observed by field-emission scanning-electron microscopy (FESEM; Hitachi S-4800, Japan). High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) mapping were performed using a transmission electron microscope (Talos F200S, Czech) at 200 kV. The electrical conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficient (S) were measured by a static DC method (LSR-3, Germany) under a helium (99.999%) atmosphere. The carrier concentration (p) was examined using a domestic Hall measurement system under a magnetic field of ±1 T. The total thermal conductivity (κtot) was calculated from κtot = λdCp, where λ is the thermal diffusivity, Cp is the specific heat, and d is the volume density. The thermal diffusivity (λ) was measured by a laser flash method (LFA 457; Netzsch, Germany); the specific heat (Cp) was estimated based on the Dulong–Petit law; and the volume density (d) was determined by Archimedes’ method.
Results and discussion
Structure and morphology characterization
An ion–ion combination pathway is applied for the synthesis of SnS nanopowders using easily available SnCl2 and Na2S·9H2O in the medium of EG. The mechanism of such a reaction could be described as: SnCl2 = Sn2+ + 2Cl−(1) Na2S·9H2O = S2− + 2Na+ + 9H2O(2) Sn2+ + S2− = SnS↓(3)
In addition, we employed N2H4·H2O in the reaction system to make the reaction proceed under mild alkaline and reductive conditions, avoiding the formation of SnO and SnO2. And the high temperature (220 °C) could exclude the generation of SnS2, even when the molar ratio of SnCl2 to Na2S·9H2O was lowered to 0.7, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The chemical composition examined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis shows that the molar ratio of elemental Sn to S is close to the stoichiometry of SnS, taking powder sample Sn0.95 as an example, whose molar ratio is 1.07:1. So it is concluded that the synthesis method developed here for SnS nanoparticles could ensure relatively high purity when x is varied in a wide range (from 1.1 to 0.8), as demonstrated by the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2. It should be noted that the residual ions of Sn2+ or S2− were left in the solution and removed during the washing process.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of the as-synthesized powder samples Snx (x = 08–1.1). 
The XRD patterns (Fig. 2) show that all the as-synthesized SnS powder samples are in an orthorhombic structure (JCPD 01-073-1859), which belongs to the Pnma space group. The strongest peak for all the samples except Sn1.0 located at 32.01° could be indexed to the crystal facet (400), indicating the preferential growth along the b–c plane, which is consistent with the layered characteristic for the SnS crystal structure. It should be noted that the strongest diffraction peak for powder sample Sn1.0 is located at 31.58°, corresponding to the crystal facet (111), suggesting that its growth preference is different from others. And a switch of the strongest peak to the facet (111) is also observed in the additionally synthesized SnS powders (Sn1.01, Sn0.99, and Sn0.98), as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Thereby we reach the conclusion that the preferential growth direction could be altered by adjusting the molar ratio of the raw materials in the current reaction system, i.e., as the molar ratio of SnCl2 to Na2S·9H2O is close to 1:1 (0.95 < x < 1.05), the SnS nanoparticle prefers to grow along the [111] direction; otherwise, it prefers to expand along the b–c plane. The SEM images shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) for powder samples Snx could well support this inference. All the powder products mainly consist of flake-shaped nanoparticles except for sample Sn1.0, in which lots of polyhedral nanoparticles are present, as marked by blue ellipses.
The microstructures for typical powder samples Sn1.1 and Sn0.85 are shown in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3a–d, we can see that the powder sample Sn1.1 is mainly comprised of flake-shaped nanoparticles with a thickness of 10–30 nm and a lateral length up to several micrometers. And the surface of each nanoflake was interspersed with lots of tiny particles with only several nanometers. For the powder sample Sn0.85, however, the thickness of the nanoflakes increases to tens of nanometers and the average lateral length reduces to hundreds of nanometers; also the nanoparticle surface becomes smooth, without obvious sub-nanoparticles decorated on their surface. It is believed that the variation in size and morphology for samples Sn1.1 and Sn0.85 is related to the change in the molar ratio of SnCl2 to Na2S·9H2O, diversifying the nucleation and growth processes for the resultant SnS nanoparticles. As for sample Sn1.1 with 10% excess of Sn2+ compared to S2− in the solution, the concentration of initially formed nuclei is much higher than that in other cases, leading to a large number of sub-nanoparticles, and their sizes are retained at several nanometers with the aid of excess Sn2+. Also, a multitude of nuclei clusters could grow into flake-shaped nanoparticles with the lateral size ranging from hundreds to thousands of nanometers during the long-time aging process. And the sub-nanoparticles could be absorbed on the surface of the nanoflakes due to their large surface energy, and this effect probably leads to an ultrathin thickness of these nanoflakes. For the Sn2+-deficient reaction systems, however, the anisotropic growth style for the SnS nanoparticles is impeded to some extent, leading to a smooth surface, an increase in thickness, a decrease in lateral size, and even the occurrence of polyhedral shaped nanoparticles in the resultant powder samples, as shown in the SEM images in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
 Fig. 3  SEM, TEM, and HRTEM images of the samples Sn1.1 (a–d) and Sn0.85 (e–h). The crystal plane spacing of 0.34 nm could be indexed to the {110} of tetragonal SnO2 (JCPD 00-021-1250), and 0.29 nm for the crystal plane {011} of orthorhombic SnS (JCPD 01-073-1859). 
The EDS mapping images displayed in Fig. S4 (ESI†) show that oxidation could take place on the as-synthesized nanoparticle surface. And, the HRTEM images illustrated in Fig. 3d and h show the existence of two kinds of lattice arrangements, where an interplanar spacing of ∼0.34 nm could be indexed to the crystal plane {110} of the tetragonal SnO2 (JCPD 00-01-0625), and ∼0.29 nm for the crystal plane {011} of the orthorhombic SnS (01-073-2859). However, based on the XRD characterization results obtained for sample Sn1.0 with different developing histories (as-synthesized, as-sintered, and even after 3 times heating and cooling, the electrical properties of the sample were measured in the temperature range of 300–873 K), we could not identify any obvious diffraction peak of SnO2 in the corresponding pattern (Fig. S5, ESI†). Furthermore, we conducted oxidation experiments in air using the powder sample Sn0.95 and the result shows that obvious oxidation would take place in SnS only when the heat treatment temperature was raised above 573 K, as shown in the XRD patterns in Fig. S6 (ESI†). These results imply that the SnS-based material exhibits good thermal stability at relatively low temperatures.
Guided by the above fundamental characterization and analyses, it could be straightforward to synthesize SnS nanoparticles with controllable composition, size, and morphology, and further make these nanoparticles promising for applications in thermoelectric, optoelectronic, and other devices. In the present work, we focus on the thermoelectric properties of these synthesized SnS powder samples as discussed in the next section.
Thermoelectric properties
We firstly investigated the texture microstructures and anisotropic transport properties of our sintered polycrystalline SnS bulk samples. Taking Sn1.0 as an example, the XRD patterns collected from two typical pellets fractured along different directions show the shift of the strongest peak from the (111) to (400) crystal plane for the parallel (‖) and perpendicular (⊥) direction to the pressing pressure, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4a. And the cross-sectional SEM image of the bulk sample Sn1.0 fractured along the perpendicular direction could also confirm that these lamellar particles are inclined to lie flat along the ⊥ direction (Fig. 4b). This evidence could demonstrate that our chemically synthesized 2D SnS particles still maintained a strong preferred crystallographic orientation in the corresponding polycrystalline bulk sample. Also, the XRD patterns suggest that the sintered samples retained a relatively high degree of purity without the appearance of polysulfides such as SnS2, Sn2S3, or Sn3S4.29
 Fig. 4  (a) XRD patterns along different directions and (b) the cross-sectional SEM image along the perpendicular direction for a typical sintered sample Sn1.0. 
As expected, the polycrystalline SnS bulk sample (Sn1.0) exhibits strong anisotropic electrical and thermal properties, as shown in Fig. 5. The electrical conductivity along the ⊥ direction is almost 1.6 times larger than that along the ‖ direction. This striking disparity in the electrical conductivity could be attributed to the distinction in hole mobility in this textured polycrystalline SnS sample, as SnS exhibits a layered crystal structure and strong anisotropic effective masses (mkx* = 2.63me, mky* = 0.32me, and mkz* = 0.20me for the first valence band).24 A similar situation was also observed in the polycrystalline SnSe sample.37 Accordingly, the lattice thermal conductivity along the ⊥ direction is evidently higher than that along the ‖ direction because of the alleviated phonon scattering by the crystal interior interfaces, which are connected by van der Waals forces or long-range electrostatic attractions. As a result, the electrical conductivity and thermal diffusivity should be measured along the same direction to precisely calculate the zT values. The highest zT values along the ⊥ and ‖ directions are 0.52 and 0.44, respectively. As the higher zT values were obtained along the ⊥ direction, we present the thermoelectric properties of the Sn vacancy engineered samples along this direction in the following paragraphs.
 Fig. 5  Anisotropic thermoelectric properties of typical sample Sn1.0 along different directions: (a) electrical conductivity; (b) Seebeck coefficient; (c) power factor; (d) total thermal conductivity; (e) lattice thermal conductivity; (f) zT values. 

Fig. 6a shows the room temperature hole concentration as a function of the molar ratio of SnCl2 to Na2S·9H2O (x), which increases rapidly from 1.46 × 1016 cm−3 to 3.58 × 1018 cm−3 as x decreases from 1.1 to 1.0, and then increases slowly to 1.25 × 1019 cm−3 when x decreases further to 0.85; this corresponds to the increasing trend for the density of the Sn vacancies with decreasing x, yet it is arduous to identify the accurate density of the Sn vacancies in each sample. The highest room temperature hole concentration (1.25 × 1019 cm−3) attained in our Sn vacancy engineered polycrystalline SnS is slightly lower than that in Na-doped polycrystalline Sn0.98Na0.02S (2.0 × 1019 cm−3) and single crystal Sn0.98Na0.02S (2.3 × 1019 cm−3); nonetheless, it is nearly one-order of magnitude higher than the maximum hole concentration obtained in Ag-doped polycrystalline SnS (2.7 × 1018 cm−3).27,29,31 This demonstrates that the vacancy engineering at cationic sites is also an effective strategy for improving the hole concentration of SnS.

Fig. 6b shows the temperature-dependent hole concentration for samples Snx. For x ranging from 1.05 to 1.1, the polycrystalline SnS samples exhibit a low hole concentration of the magnitude of 1016 cm−3 at room temperature, which monotonically increases with rising temperature and reaches in the vicinity of 1018 cm−3. To be different, the hole concentration shows weak dependence on temperature for samples Snx (x = 0.8–1.0). This indicates that the effect of thermally excited holes is successfully suppressed by decreasing x, resulting from the significant improvement of extrinsic hole concentration.
The hole mobility is calculated using equation μ = σ/(pq), where μ is the hole mobility and q is the absolute charge of an electron. The values of temperature-dependent hole mobility for all samples Snx are located in the range of 0–20 cm2 V−1 s−1, as shown in Fig. 6c, which are comparable to the Ag/Na-doped polycrystalline SnS.30,31 Similarly, it shows an increasing trend with the rising temperature (below ∼500 K), since the carrier scattering is dominated by grain boundaries at low temperatures.30,41 However, the transition temperature of the dominated carrier scattering mechanism from grain boundaries to acoustic phonons is pushed to a higher temperature, even higher than 600 K, which is possibly due to the higher density of grain boundary for our chemically synthesized polycrystalline SnS compared with its solid-state synthesized counterparts.

Fig. 6d and e show temperature-dependent electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient for samples Snx, respectively. Expectedly, the electrical conductivity is significantly enhanced with decreasing x, arising from the striking increase of hole concentration in cationic vacancy engineered polycrystalline SnS samples. Accordingly, the Seebeck coefficient decreases with the increase of hole concentration or decreasing x. For example, the electrical conductivity is only 132 Ω−1 m−1 for sample Sn1.1 (3.58 × 1017 cm−3) at 473 K, which jumps to 1035 Ω−1 m−1 for sample Sn1.0 (4.12 × 1018 cm−3), and then further increases to 1851 Ω−1 m−1 for sample Sn0.85 (1.00 × 1019 cm−3). However the corresponding Seebeck coefficient drops from 606 to 420, and further to 284 μV K−1 for samples Sn1.1, Sn1.0, and Sn0.85, respectively. Additionally, the electrical conductivity shows a similar variation trend as a function of temperature. Taking a typical sample Sn1.0 as an example, the first increase stage of electrical conductivity with the rising temperature from 300 to 526 K is caused by the increase in hole mobility, whereas the hole concentration almost remains constant in this temperature range (Fig. 6b), as the boundary scattering is dominated.41 And then it decreases with the increase in temperature, exhibiting a metallic conducting behavior (526–725 K), as the acoustic phonon scattering is dominant, which usually leads to a diminished hole mobility. Therefore, there appears a peak at ∼600 K in the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity curve. And the shift of such peak for these bulk samples Snx (x = 0.8–1.0) could be attributed to the variation in the energy barriers at boundaries, which results from the fluctuation in the densities of the as-sintered samples (Table S1, ESI†) and the diversification in the average sizes of initially synthesized powder samples. When the temperature further increases, the electrical conductivity increases again because of the thermal excitation (above 725 K), which could be evidenced by the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient curve as its peak value is located at 725 K as well. Similar temperature-dependent variation trends for electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient were observed in Ag/Na-doped polycrystalline SnS.30,31
The power factor plotted with temperature for samples Snx is shown in Fig. 6f. It indicates that the power factor could be significantly enhanced due to the increase of hole concentration through cationic site vacancy engineering. And the peak value up to 0.46 mW m−1 K−2 is attained in sample Sn0.8 at 873 K, which is much larger than that achieved in Ag/Na-doped polycrystalline SnS, ∼0.30 mW m−1 K−2.30,31
The temperature-dependent total thermal conductivity and its lattice vibration contribution for samples Snx are plotted in Fig. 7. Here the lattice thermal conductivity is estimated by subtracting the electronic contribution part from the total thermal conductivity, i.e., κL = κtot − κe. And κe is calculated using the Wiedemann–Franz law, κe = LσT, where L is the Lorenz number, which could be estimated based on the single parabolic band (SPB) model as SnS has a relatively large band gap (1.1 eV), and fixes the phonon scattering exponent (r) to −0.5 providing that the acoustic phonon scattering is dominant. The result shows that the excess 90% part of total thermal conductivity is contributed by the lattice thermal conductivity. And the lattice thermal conductivity decreases with increasing temperature, basically obeying the T−1 law, indicates that the phonon scattering is dominated by the Umklapp process. It should be noted that a slight deviation from the T−1 law for temperature-dependent lattice thermal conductivity is probably due to the additional phonon scattering by grain boundaries, especially at low temperatures. Additionally, the large span of room temperature lattice thermal conductivity for samples Snx, from 0.9 to 1.4 W m−1 K−1, could be ascribed to the diversification in the size and morphology of the originally synthesized SnS nanoparticles and the fluctuation in the density of the sintered samples. Nevertheless, our polycrystalline SnS samples exhibit an extremely low lattice thermal conductivity, i.e., 0.43 W m−1 K−1 at 873 K, reaching the amorphous limit estimated by the Cahill model (0.45 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K).26,42 Such a low lattice thermal conductivity achieved in SnS is mainly due to its strong lattice anharmonicity, which is analogous to other orthorhombic crystals such as SnSe, GeSe, and GeS.26

Fig. 8a shows the temperature-dependent zT values of the samples Snx. The zT values are greatly enhanced as x decreases. Combining high power factor with intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity of SnS, a peak zT value up to 0.8 at 873 K is achieved in samples Sn0.85 and Sn0.8, which is much higher than that for Na/Ag-doped polycrystalline SnS, and single crystal Sn0.98Na0.02S in the a/c-axis, yet lower than the maximum zT value attained in single crystal Sn0.98Na0.02S along the b-axis (Fig. 8b).27,30,31 Moreover, the heating and cooling measuring cycles on the electrical properties suggest the good stability of thermoelectric performance for our polycrystalline SnS bulk materials (Fig. S7, ESI†). This work demonstrates that the enhanced thermoelectric performance of polycrystalline SnS could be realized through hole concentration optimization via cationic site vacancy engineering.

Conclusion
In summary, we synthesized flake-like SnS nanoparticles through a solution-based route employing an ionic reaction mechanism. And the hole concentration was successfully tuned in a wide range (1016–1019 cm−3) via Sn vacancy engineering, by simply changing the molar ratio of the starting materials. Due to the significantly enhanced power factor and its intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity, a respectable peak zT value up to 0.8 at 873 K was achieved in our Sn vacancy engineered polycrystalline SnS bulk samples (Sn0.85 and Sn0.8), much higher than the zT values attained in Ag/Na-doped ones. It is believed that the thermoelectric performance of Sn vacancy engineered polycrystalline SnS could be further improved through appropriate foreign element doping and texture modification for the optimization of hole concentration and mobility.
