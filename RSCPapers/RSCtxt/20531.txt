    , Accepted 8th September 2017First published on 8th September 2017AbstractSolid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) can directly convert CO2 to CO and O2 that are important building blocks for chemical production and other applications. However, the use of SOECs for direct CO2 electrolysis has been hampered mainly due to the absence of a stable, highly catalytically active and cost effective cathode (fuel electrode) material. Here we report a ceramic SOEC cathode material of perovskite-structured Sr1.9Fe1.5Mo0.4Ni0.1O6−δ for direct CO2 electrolysis. By annealing at 800 °C in H2, homogeneously dispersed nano-sized NiFe alloy nanoparticles are exsolved from the Sr1.9Fe1.5Mo0.4Ni0.1O6−δ perovskite lattice. The exsolved NiFe nanoparticles significantly enhance the chemical adsorption and surface reaction kinetics of CO2 with the cathode. SOECs with the novel cathode have demonstrated a peak current density of 2.16 A cm−2 under an applied voltage of 1.5 V at 800 °C and have demonstrated stable direct CO2 electrolysis performance during 500 h of operation under current density above 1 A cm−2 at 800 °C.
1. Introduction
Large scale global consumption of carbon-containing fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas has resulted in a substantial increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration that may be the primary cause for adverse climate changes and more frequent natural disasters.1 Although renewable and carbon-free energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, tidal and hydrothermal power have found rapid development and deployment, the intermittent nature of these renewable clean energy sources makes it challenging to meet the typical consumer energy demand.2,3 By the direct electrolysis of CO2 in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) electricity from renewable resources can be stored to produce CO in the cathode (the fuel electrode) that can be used as fuel for electricity generation, or as a feedstock for chemical and fuel production through the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, and O2 in the anode (the oxygen electrode) that can be used for the oxy-combustion process, life consumable products, or other industrial processes.4 Consequently, direct electrolysis of CO2 in SOECs can play a critical role in utilizing CO2, developing clean energy, alleviating the energy crisis and mitigating the environmental impact of CO2 to achieve a sustainable and carbon-neutral energy supply system.2 However, the use of SOECs for direct CO2 electrolysis has been limited, mainly due to the absence of a stable, highly catalytically active and cost effective cathode (the fuel electrode) material that can demonstrate long term cycle life under current densities necessary for economic viability.
Direct electrolysis of CO2 in SOECs using a Pt-based fuel electrode was initially studied to produce O2 as a life support for astronauts through in situ-resource utilization by NASA.5 However, Pt-based fuel electrodes are too expensive for large-scale SOEC applications.5,6 Ni–YSZ (8% yttria-stabilized zirconia) cermets, the state-of-the-art anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), have been studied as the fuel electrodes for CO2 as well as CO2-steam co-electrolysis.7,8 However, oxidation and sintering of Ni particles can occur when the fuel electrode is exposed to a pure CO2 or CO2–H2O atmosphere at elevated temperatures.9 In practice, a small amount of reducing gas (H2 or CO) must be supplied to the fuel electrode, which requires a more complicated and higher cost gas feeding system. In addition, SOECs with a Ni–YSZ electrode must be operated under mild conditions such as a current density below 1 A cm−2, otherwise irreversible structural degradation of Ni–YSZ can significantly limit performance and cycle life.10 Recent efforts have focused on exploring alternative fuel electrodes using mixed conducting perovskite-based materials such as La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3−δ (LSCM), La0.3Sr0.7Cr0.3Fe0.7O3−δ (LSCrF), La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+δ (LST), and Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ (SFM).11–15 However, these alternative fuel electrodes typically exhibit insufficient electro-catalytic activity for CO2 electrolysis, e.g., only 0.09 A cm−2 at 800 °C and 1.5 V for SOECs with LSCM-based fuel electrodes.14 We have recently found that nanostructured SFM catalysts can improve the electrocatalytic activity for direct CO2 electrolysis, e.g., 1.10 A cm−2 at 800 °C and 1.5 V.11 However, uniform distribution of SFM nanoparticles in the YSZ scaffold remains challenging since multiple infiltration steps are involved. According to our density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling studies,16,17 adding a small amount of active transition metals such as Ni to the SFM surface has been found to significantly enhance the overall electrochemical performance of SFM for hydrogen and carbon monoxide oxidation. More recently, Neagu et al. have reported that in situ grown metal nanoparticles on the anode substrates have demonstrated enhanced performance in SOFCs compared with those synthesized through a lengthy and intricate ex situ procedure such as infiltration.18 When active metals such as Ni, Fe and Co are doped into stoichiometric perovskites, A-site deficiency is expected to serve as a general driving force to trigger exsolution of reducible-cations in the B-sites to produce nanoparticles with superior surface coverage and strong metal/ceramic interaction.19 In this regard, Du et al. have reported that in situ exsolved NiFe metallic nanoparticles from 35% Ni doped Sr2FeMoO6−δ show excellent structural stability and resistance to coking in CH4.20 Based on these results, it is expected that enhanced performance and stability in direct CO2 electrolysis can be achieved by introducing active transition metal nanoparticles socketed on the perovskite electrode surface.
In the present study, we have designed and demonstrated a novel fuel electrode through tailoring the non-stoichiometry and in situ reduction of the perovskite oxide. The fuel electrode is derived from a molybdenum doped strontium ferrite (Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ) perovskite with the regular ABO3 stoichiometry. Nickel is doped to the B-site of an A-site deficient perovskite of Sr1.9Fe1.5Mo0.4Ni0.1O6−δ (SFMN). A NiFe@SFM electrode with NiFe alloy nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on the SFM matrix is obtained by annealing the A-site deficient SFMN in hydrogen at 800 °C.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials synthesis
Sr1.9Fe1.5Mo0.4Ni0.1O6−δ (SFMN) powders were synthesized using a citric acid–glycine combustion process. Sr(NO3)2, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (all the chemicals have purity of 99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China) in the appropriate ratio were dissolved in deionized water. Citric acid and glycine were used as the complexing agent and fuels with a molar ratio of citric acid:glycine:metal cations = 1.5:2:1. After being stirred for 2 hours, the solution was heated in a microwave oven until self-ignition. The combustion product, dark ash, was heat-treated at 1050 °C for 5 h in air to obtain pure phase SFMN. SFM (Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ) powders were also synthesized by the same method as SFMN. (ZrO2)0.92(Y2O3)0.08 (YSZ) powders were purchased from Tosoh Corporation (TZ-8Y, Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), while Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) powders for the fuel electrode and (La0.85Sr0.15)0.9MnO3−δ (LSM) powders for the air electrode were synthesized by a solution combustion method as described elsewhere.21
2.2 Cell fabrication
Single cells of SFMN–SDC|SDC|YSZ|LSM–YSZ studied in this work were YSZ electrolyte supported cells. YSZ electrolyte substrates were formed by dry-pressing YSZ powders uniaxially at 200 MPa, followed by sintering at 1450 °C for 5 h in air. A SDC buffer layer was applied on one side of the YSZ electrolyte through a drop-coating method and then sintered at 1200 °C for 5 h in air. Specifically, 8 wt% SDC (prepared by a co-precipitation method)22 with the mean particle size of 0.1 μm was dispersed in ethanol and ball-milled for 24 h. The SDC suspension was then drop-deposited on one side of the YSZ electrolyte and then sintered at 1200 °C for 5 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1, resulting in a bi-layer structure consisting of a gas-tight YSZ layer and a relatively dense SDC layer. The air electrode ink consisting of YSZ and LSM powders (weight ratio of 4:6) was applied to the other surface of the YSZ electrolyte by a screen-printing method. Subsequently, the fuel electrode ink consisting of SFMN and SDC powders (weight ratio of 6:4) was applied to the SDC surface. The cell was then co-fired at 1100 °C in air for 2 h. The thickness of the LSM–YSZ air electrode, YSZ electrolyte, and NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode is ca. 50 μm, 180 μm, and 50 μm, respectively. A Pt reference electrode (diameter of 1 mm) was placed in the same side as the oxygen electrode for impedance measurement in order to study the cathode impedance for direct CO2 electrolysis. To obtain NiFe@SFM, reduction of SFMN was performed by heating SFMN powders in humidified (∼3 vol% H2O) hydrogen with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to 800 °C and then held at 800 °C for 5 h. For comparison, similar electrolyte-supported cells with the configuration of SFM–SDC|SDC|YSZ|LSM–YSZ were also fabricated.
2.3 Characterization of physical properties
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a Rigaku D/Max 2100 powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The diffraction data were collected by stepwise scanning of 2θ in the range of 10 and 90° with a scan rate of 5 deg min−1. More detailed structural information was analyzed by the Rietveld method with the program GSAS (General Structure Analysis System) and the EXPGUI interface to determine the space group and to fit the lattice parameters.
The microstructure of the powders and the electrodes was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6700F), equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) setup for the determination of the chemical composition. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a JEM-2100F field emission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The high-resolution TEM, HAADF-STEM and the corresponding EDS mapping analyses were performed on a JEOL JEM-ARM200F TEM/STEM with a spherical aberration corrector.
H2-temperature programmed desorption (TPR) and CO2-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were performed using a Thermo Finnigan TPDRO 1100 apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The SFM and SFMN samples were treated with helium at 1000 °C for 30 min before H2-TPR. The 10% H2/Ar flow rate for the H2-TPR analysis was 10 ml min−1, and the temperature ramp rate was 10 °C min−1. The SFM and NiFe@SFM samples were pretreated at 400 °C in He for 1 h to eliminate adsorbed species, followed by purged adsorption of CO2 with a 5% CO2–He flow at 100 °C for 1 h. The CO2-TPD was conducted from 100 to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1 with pure argon as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml min−1.
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a Kratos Analytical AXIS 165 with a monochromatic Al Kα source to investigate the oxidation states of powder samples. The spectra were referenced to the C1s bonding energy at 284.6 eV. A nonlinear Shirley-type background method was used to analyze the core peaks. In the fitting, the peak positions and areas were optimized by the Lorentzian–Gaussian method.
2.4 Electrical and electrochemical performance evaluation
Electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) measurements were performed using the standard 4-probe technique. SFMN powders were mixed with PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) in appropriate proportions by ball milling in ethanol for 2 h. The powder mixtures were uniaxially pressed (300 MPa) and then sintered in air at 1350 °C for 5 h to obtain rectangular bar samples with dimensions of about 20 × 4.8 × 0.6 mm3. The density of the sintered samples measured by the Archimedes method and the geometrical density were well above 98% of the theoretical value. For comparison, SFM bar samples were also fabricated by the nominally identical method. The sample was fixed in a quartz tube. Electrical connections to the sample were established by silver wires. A silver conducting resin was used to improve the contact between the bar specimen and the wires. Before ECR experiments, the sample was annealed in hydrogen for 5 h. Then the conductivity was measured as a function of time following a step-wise increase of ambient oxygen partial pressure, which was performed by switching the gas stream from low pO2 (e.g., 2:1 CO/CO2, pO2 = 9.49 × 10−20 atm at 800 °C) to relatively high pO2 (e.g., 1:1 CO/CO2, pO2 = 3.79 × 10−19 atm at 800 °C) at a total gas flow rate of 200 ml min−1. Detailed descriptions of the ECR technique and the model used for data fitting are given in the ESI.†
Ag paste was applied on the surface of the fuel electrode and oxygen electrode as the current collector. Single cells were sealed to one end of an alumina tube using a conductive paste (DAD87, Shanghai Institute of Synthetic Resin). The cells were heated up to 800 °C in air. Prior to the flow of H2 to the fuel electrode, Ar was used to purge the fuel electrode side. The cell was held in humidified H2 (3 vol% H2O) at 800 °C for 5 h to ensure that the SFMN was fully annealed. Subsequently, the feeding gas was switched to pure CO2. The polarization curves at 800 °C were obtained using an electrochemical interface (Solartron 1287) by performing linear sweep voltammetry from 0 V to 1.6 V with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectra were measured in a three-electrode configuration, with the fuel electrode (working electrode) fed with pure CO2 (40 ml min−1) while the air electrode (counter electrode) and Pt reference electrode were exposed to ambient air, typically measured in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz with the AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV using an impedance/gain-phase analyzer (Solartron 1260). For comparison, similar electrolyte-supported cells with the cell configuration of SFM–SDC|SDC|YSZ|LSM–YSZ were also evaluated through identical methods. The compositions of the outlet gas were determined using a mass flowmeter and online gas chromatograph (FULI, GC9790II). The Faraday efficiency was calculated by assuming 100% current efficiency.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 
          In situ formation of NiFe@SFM
The as-prepared NiFe@SFM particles exhibit furry contours, where 20–50 nm sized NiFe alloy fine particles exsolved from sub-micrometer sized SFMN parent particles as shown in the bright-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, Fig. 1a and S1b.† In contrast to NiFe@SFM, only large particles can be found from SFMN, Fig. S1a,† suggesting that the fine particles observed in the surface of NiFe@SFM are exsolved from SFMN upon reducing at 800 °C in H2. The fine particles consist of Ni and Fe as indicated by the bright red and green images that are found in the same location of the EDS (energy dispersive spectroscopy) mapping in Fig. 1b and EDS elemental line analysis of the inset in Fig. 1c. Both figures suggest that almost all Ni has been exsolved from the surface of the SFMN particles during the reduction process. The exsolution phenomenon is further evidenced by the increase of surface elemental concentrations of Ni and Fe as shown by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis in Fig. S2 and Table S1.† For example, surface Ni concentration increases from 2.41% for SFMN to 4.97% for NiFe@SFM. These results are also in good agreement with the corresponding thermodynamic Gibbs free energy prediction (Fig. S3a†) and dynamic H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) analysis (Fig. S3b†).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that the fine particles are NiFe alloys grown on the parent SFM perovskite oxide, Fig. S4.† The as-prepared SFMN with A-site cation deficiency is indexed in an identical cubic perovskite structure as the stoichiometric SFM, indicating that NiO is successfully doped into the perovskite structured SFM lattice. In contrast, besides the cubic perovskite SFM phase, additional peaks indexed to the NiFe alloy with the cubic phase (JCPDS#47-1417) are found for NiFe@SFM, indicating the formation of the NiFe alloy through the exsolution of Ni and Fe from SFMN when it is annealed at 800 °C for 5 h in humidified hydrogen. The room temperature XRD Rietveld refinement is shown in Fig. 2a and b, based on a cubic structure (space group: Pmm, no. 221) and the refinement results are summarized in Table S2.† The reliability is determined by Rp, Rwp and χ2, indicating the goodness of fit. SFMN has a slightly larger lattice constant of a = b = c = 3.920 Å than SFM (a = b = c = 3.916 Å, Fig. S4†) since the larger Ni2+ (r = 0.69 Å) is doped into the smaller Fe3+ (r = 0.645 Å) lattice site as well as A-site deficiency. The oxide phase in NiFe@SFM retains the cubic structure and has the largest lattice parameter of a = b = c = 3.932 Å (Fig. 2b). The lattice expansion is probably due to the reduced average valence of Fe ions as well as the exsolution of NiFe (Fig. S2 and Table S1†). The fine particles are further confirmed to be the NiFe alloy formed on the SFM perovskite oxide from high-resolution TEM analysis, Fig. 2c and d. For instance, the lattice space for the big particle is determined as 0.272 nm, which is in accordance with the (110) plane of the cubic perovskite SFM. The lattice space for the fine particle is 0.206 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of the cubic NiFe alloy (Fmm, no. 225). Therefore, both the microstructure and crystalline investigations indicate that nanometer sized bimetallic NiFe fine particles are in situ formed from the stable SFM perovskite host, which is expected to improve the cell performance.

3.2 Enhancement of cell performance with NiFe@SFM for direct CO2 electrolysis
The electrochemical performances for direct CO2 electrolysis were compared for NiFe@SFM and SFM based composite fuel electrodes, i.e. NiFe@SFM–SDC (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9) and SFM–SDC, using single cells composed of a SDC barrier layer, dense YSZ electrolyte and LSM ((La0.85Sr0.15)0.9MnO3−δ)–YSZ oxygen electrode (SEM images in Fig. S5a–c†). A SDC interlayer is applied to prevent the potential reaction between SFM and YSZ during the cell fabrication and electrochemical performance measurement (Fig. S6a†). Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the applied voltage and current density of the two cells based on NiFe@SFM (also in Fig. S6b†) and SFM fuel electrodes at 800 °C for direct CO2 electrolysis. It was found that in situ exsolved NiFe alloy nanoparticles were effective in enhancing the cell performance for direct CO2 electrolysis. Assuming that a voltage at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 corresponds to the onset voltage, it can be seen in the inset in Fig. 3 that the onset voltage for direct CO2 electrolysis is 0.391 V for the NiFe@SFM–SDC based cells, which is 0.105 V lower than that for the SFM–SDC fuel electrode (0.496 V). Once the cell voltage exceeds the onset point, the cell with the NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode exhibits improved exponential growth in current density, compared to that of the cell with the SFM–SDC fuel electrode. A remarkable current density of 2.16 A cm−2 is achieved at 1.5 V at 800 °C, which is more than twice compared with that for SFM–SDC based cells (1.05 A cm−2). The cell performance of the NiFe@SFM fuel electrode is considerably higher than those of the cells using the well-established LSTMn-based fuel electrodes modified with Ni nanoparticles (0.10–0.43 A cm−2, Table S3†) and LSCM-based electrodes modified with Ni and Cu nanoparticles (0.20–0.25 A cm−2, Table S3†), and other previously reported fuel electrodes for direct CO2 electrolysis under similar test conditions without addition of a reducing gas such as H2 or CO (Table S4†). The performance is also enhanced in comparison with our recent study (1.10 A cm−2) for the nanostructured SFM–YSZ fuel electrode under the same testing conditions.11

3.3 Mechanism for enhanced CO2 electrolysis performance
Since the CO2 reduction in SOECs involves complex electrochemical and mass transport processes, the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) was used to understand the CO2 reduction process and the origin of enhanced performance. Fig. 4a shows the corresponding EIS plots at 800 °C under an overpotential of 0.3 V. Consistent with EIS data fitting, the ohmic resistance (Rs) is the intercept of the spectra with the real-axis at high frequency, indicative of the resistance of the YSZ electrolyte, CPE is the constant phase element, and the total polarization resistance (Rp) is the intercept of the spectra with the real-axis between high and low frequency, which mainly comes from the fuel electrode in the three-electrode configuration with NiFe@SFM–SDC as the working electrode and LSM–YSZ as the counter electrode. At 800 °C, Rs is almost identical for the cells with different fuel electrodes, while Rp decreases from 0.342 Ω cm2 for the SFM–SDC fuel electrode to 0.265 Ω cm2 for the NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode. Since the polarization impedance arcs are overlapped and it is difficult to distinguish the contributions from different sub-steps, the EIS data were analyzed by the distribution of relaxation time (DRT, ESI†) method to effectively separate the multiple time constants.23 The corresponding analysis result at 800 °C is shown in Fig. 4b. In the DRT plot, the area enclosed by a specific peak represents the polarization resistance for that sub-process. Overall, three peaks (P1, P2 and P3) are distinguishable in the frequency range of 1000–3000 Hz, 1–2 Hz and 0.1–0.3 Hz, respectively. Each peak is an indication of a sub-step for CO2 reduction. As shown, the area for the high-frequency peak P1 is similar for the cells with the NiFe@SFM–SDC and SFM–SDC fuel electrodes, respectively, suggesting that P1 should correspond to the sub-step of ion transportation at the electrolyte–electrode interface. The intermediate-frequency peak P2 and low-frequency peak P3 are much smaller for NiFe@SFM–SDC. The results suggest that P2 may be associated with the charge transfer process while P3 should be assigned to non-charge transfer processes such as adsorption and surface diffusion of active species. Both P2 and P3 are related to the electrode surface kinetics,22 which will be discussed in the following section. Based on the DRT analysis, the EIS plots should be fitted by the equivalent circuit model with a configuration of Rs-(R1CPE1)-(R2CPE2)-(R3CPE3) shown in the inset in Fig. 4a. The detailed fitting results are listed in Table S5.†R1 is similar for the two cells while R2 and R3 are much smaller for NiFe@SFM–SDC, indicating that the exsolved NiFe nanoparticles anchored on the SFM perovskite surface promote the CO2 reduction kinetics.

To further confirm that the enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the improved processes related to R2 and R3, CO2 adsorption and charge transfer behaviors on the fuel electrode surface were characterized. CO2 adsorption including the physical absorption and chemical adsorption, and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) is conducted on NiFe@SFM and SFM powders, Fig. S7.† As shown, the results indicate that NiFe@SFM absorbs more CO2 molecules, which is the prerequisite before the subsequent CO2 reduction reactions can take place at active sites.6 Both NiFe@SFM and SFM exhibit similar desorption behavior at 100–200 °C and 500–700 °C. The desorption peak at nearly 150 °C can be attributed to the physical desorption due to the weak van der Waals forces, while the wide peak at about 650 °C is mainly related to the chemical desorption of CO2 induced by a synergistic effect of metal and oxygen vacancy from the surface of perovskite oxide.24,25 It is reasonable to assume that the small peaks are mainly due to the existence of NiFe alloy nanoparticles. The activation energy (Ed) of the surface desorption can be calculated by the Chan–Aris–Weinberg method,26eqn (1). (1)where Ed is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, Tm is the temperature at the maximum peak, and W1/2 is the peak width at half of the maximum intensity. At 500–800 °C, the calculated Ed is 0.661 eV for NiFe@SFM powders, larger than 0.580 eV for SFM powders, indicating better CO2 adsorption ability for NiFe@SFM powders at 500–800 °C. The notable improvement of CO2 adsorption is in good accordance with the improvement of R3 (Fig. 4b and c). The remarkably enhanced CO2 adsorption may be ascribed to the rough surface morphology of NiFe@SFM, which can be clearly seen in Fig. S5c,† and a tuned synergistic effect of NiFe nanoparticles and oxygen vacancy from the surface of perovskite oxide.25 Besides, it is noted that the aforementioned R2 is the largest among the three impedance arcs, implying that the charge transfer is the rate determining process for CO2 reduction reaction. In this regard, the Butler–Volmer equation is applied to further explore the charge transfer between CO2 and the fuel electrode, as given below:27 (2)where J0 is the exchange current density, ηct the activation overvoltage, α the charge transfer coefficient and ne the number of exchanged electrons (ne = 2). Further, it could be simplified using the Tafel equation as (3)
According to the special CO2 adsorption and dissociation characteristics,28 combined with the Kröger–Vink notation, an overall CO2 electrochemical reaction process can be expressed as follows:5,29 CO2 (g) = CO2 (ad)(4) (5) CO (ad) = CO (g)(6)where e− is an excess free electron from the electrode (NiFe or SFM),  is oxygen vacancy provided by the electrocatalysts of SFM and/or the oxide ion conducting SDC phase, and  is an oxygen atom in the SFM or SDC lattice. Moreover, the charge transfer reaction corresponding to P2 in Fig. 4b, eqn (5) can be expressed by a one-electron-step reaction as
Step 1: CO2 + e− = CO−2(7)
Step 2: (8)where it is assumed that CO2− is the only intermediate product. The charge transfer coefficient α will be 0.5 if step 1 is the rate determining step, while it will be 1.5 for step 2.5,30 According to the Tafel slopes, α is determined to be 0.63 and 0.51 for NiFe@SFM–SDC and SFM–SDC, respectively, suggesting a stronger charge-transfer interaction between CO2 and NiFe@SFM–SDC than that of SFM–SDC, in good agreement with the improvement of R2. Furthermore, step 1 rather than step 2 is the rate determining step in the Tafel range and the enhanced charge transfer coefficient does not cause a change in the rate determining step. It has been reported that the one-electron reduction of CO2 to form CO2− is the rate determining step in aqueous media at metallic electrodes.31,32 Considering the above discussion, it can be concluded that the cell performance is enhanced through promoting the sub-steps related to R2 and R3, while R3 is predominantly influenced by the exsolved NiFe alloy nanoparticles and oxygen vacancy on the SFM surface.
3.4 Enhanced surface kinetics
In order to evaluate how surface kinetics play in the direct CO2 electrolysis with different fuel electrodes, surface exchange coefficient (Kex) measurements were performed using an electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) technique to study the surface-exchange properties of NiFe@SFM–SDC and SFM–SDC in a CO/CO2 atmosphere (see the Experimental section, Fig. S8 and Table S6†).33 When the atmosphere is changed from PO2 = 9.49 × 10−20 atm to PO2 = 3.79 × 10−19 atm at 800 °C, CO2 is reduced to establish new thermodynamic equilibrium between the gas and the solid phases. The re-equilibrium time decreases from 1900 s to 1120 s for NiFe@SFM–SDC compared to that of SFM–SDC, suggesting enhanced CO2 reduction kinetics associated with NiFe exsolution, as shown in Fig. 5a. The surface reaction rate constant, Kchem, at 650–800 °C obtained by fitting the measured ECR curves using eqn (6) (ESI†) is 1.01 × 10−4 and 7.15 × 10−5 cm s−1 at 800 °C for NiFe@SFM and SFM, respectively. Overall, NiFe exsolution results in about 40% increase in Kchem. Furthermore, Fig. 5b presents Arrhenius plots of Kchem at 650–800 °C, from which the NiFe@SFM–SDC possesses slightly lower activation energy (Ea) of surface exchange reactions than SFM–SDC, indicating that the corresponding reaction mechanism seems to be similar.

3.5 Performance stability for direct CO2 electrolysis
The short-term variations of current density recorded versus time with the corresponding applied voltages were also evaluated, Fig. 6. The current densities increase with the applied voltages, consistent with the performance curve shown in Fig. 3. The CO production rate, determined using an on-line gas chromatograph increases from 0.718 to 1.867 ml min−1 with the increase of the applied voltage from 1.0 V to 1.3 V. These values are also significantly improved, compared with those previously reported for the LSCM-based fuel electrode.34–37

The durability for direct CO2 electrolysis has been examined at above 1 A cm−2, a very harsh condition that is seldom achieved in the literature but highly desirable for commercial application.2Fig. 7a displays the variations of current density under a constant voltage load of 1.3 V. As it can be seen, there is only a slight drop in current density during the initial operation, probably due to slight oxidation of the NiFe alloy surface.38 Subsequently, a steady state is reached at 1.10 A cm−2 and the current density shows no observable degradation in a 500 h test, a very impressive stable cell performance under such harsh conditions. Graves et al. reported that the conventional SOECs with (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95MnO3−δ–YSZ electrodes exhibited fast degradation e.g., the cell voltage increased from 1.33 V to 1.73 V under such harsh conditions (at 1 A cm−2 and 800 °C) during a 420 h test. This fast performance degradation was ascribed to the microstructural damage near the oxygen-electrode/electrolyte interface, caused by a build-up of high internal oxygen pressure.7 In the present work, we used a higher level of A-site deficient (La0.85Sr0.15)0.9MnO3−δ and YSZ as the oxygen electrode, which is expected to inhibit delamination of the oxygen-electrode/electrolyte interface. As revealed from Fig. S5e and S5f,† no apparent delamination has been observed at the interface between the oxygen electrode and the YSZ electrolyte from the samples after high current (2 A cm−2) measurement for 10 h as well as 500 h long-term electrochemical testing. Furthermore, it has been reported that Rs increased by a factor of 2 (from 0.15 Ω cm2 to 0.45 Ω cm2) when operating the Ni–YSZ based SOECs under very harsh conditions for 68 h (2 A cm−2, 950 °C) due to sintering and relocation of Ni.10 Besides, it has been reported that the Ni–YSZ electrode can be easily oxidized (Ni to NiO) in a pure CO2 atmosphere,9 and the nanostructured NiFe alloy of the NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode could be even much more easily oxidized. However, the XRD pattern (Fig. S9†) of the post-test NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode after the long-term stability test of 500 h for CO2 electrolysis at 800 °C does not show any observable diffraction that can be ascribed to either nickel oxide or iron oxide. This is consistent with the results for direct CO2 electrolysis using an Ni–Fe–La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Mn0.2O3 (LSFM) fuel electrode reported by Wang et al., where no NiO peaks were detected from the XRD measurement.39 Both SFM40 and LSFM41 are mixed oxide ionic and electronic conductors that may possess excellent oxygen storage capacity as shown for SDC,42 and the relative high oxide ion conductivity in SFM and LSFM may likely impede oxidation of Ni in the NiFe@SFM–SDC and Ni–Fe–LSFM fuel electrodes. To further evaluate the performance stability and the potential oxidation of the NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode under a pure CO2 environment, cells were subjected to cyclic operation between CO2 electrolysis mode at 1.3 V and OCV mode for 10 cycles at 800 °C. As shown in Fig. S10a,† no detectable cell performance degradation was observed at a constant voltage of 1.3 V in CO2 electrolysis mode after the cell was left at OCV mode for 2 h. In the last cycle, the cells were held in the OCV mode for 5 h in a pure CO2 atmosphere at 800 °C. Upon cooling down to room temperature under the CO2 atmosphere, the NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode was ground into powder for XRD measurement. It can be seen from Fig. S10b† that the phases in the NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode are still SFM, SDC and NiFe alloy, and no diffraction peak related to nickel oxide or iron oxide can be observed, indicating that the oxidation of Ni may not be an issue for direct CO2 electrolysis using the NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode.

Fig. 7b depicts the stable CO production rate and Faradaic efficiency versus the elapsed time, revealing that CO is the dominant product during the entire testing period. This was also confirmed using Raman spectroscopy since no obvious peaks for the C–C bond were detected, as seen from Fig. 7c. Consequently, it is concluded that NiFe@SFM is an extremely durable fuel electrode for direct CO2 electrolysis in SOECs. The nano-sized NiFe particles are still homogenously dispersed on the SFM electrode matrix after the 500 h test under harsh conditions, as shown in Fig. S5d,† indicating that the SFM substrate can anchor the NiFe nanoparticles and prevent them from sintering at high temperatures and at high electrical currents. Similar results have also been reported for SOFCs, such as Co–Fe modified (Pr0.4Sr0.6)3(Fe0.85Nb0.15)2O7−δ anode for C3H8 oxidation and Ag modified Sr0.95Co0.9Nb0.1O3−δ cathode for oxygen reduction.43,44
The superior durability for direct CO2 electrolysis observed for the NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode could be ascribed to two crucial factors, sintering and coking resistances. The sintering-resistance of in situ formed nanoparticles on the perovskite substrates could be explained by an anchoring effect, based on a “strong metal–support bonding interaction” with high adhesion energy (Eadh) of metal nanoparticles to the oxide support.45Eadh can be reflected by the enthalpy formation of oxide support (−ΔHsup) to provide a simple quantitative prediction, which equals the average metal–oxygen bond energy (ABE) for oxides. As reported by Campbell et al., Eadh exhibits a negative correlation with −ΔHsup.44,46 According to the calculation of the ABE values (ESI†), −ΔHsup is much lower, ca. 334.70 kJ mol−1, for SFM than 544.45 kJ mol−1 for typical CeO2−x, which has larger Eadh than other reported oxides,47,48 indicative of larger Eadh between the NiFe alloy particles and SFM support. In addition, the sintering of metal nanoparticles can be mitigated or even completely suppressed by alloying, i.e., adding Fe (melting point: 1535 °C) to Ni (melting point: 1453 °C).45 The coking could be effectively suppressed through adjustment of the atomic orbital and electron cloud of Ni alloyed by Fe, which undermines the interaction between Ni 3d electrons and C 2p orbitals.49 Consequently, NiFe@SFM–SDC is a superior fuel electrode for direct CO2 electrolysis.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a novel NiFe@SFM fuel electrode consisting of an SFM perovskite matrix with uniformly dispersed Ni–Fe alloy nanoparticles for direct CO2 electrolysis in SOECs. A YSZ electrolyte-supported SOEC with a NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode and LSM–YSZ oxygen electrode exhibits significant performance increase as compared to SFM–SDC and other conventional fuel electrodes for direct CO2 electrolysis. The enhanced cell performance for direct CO2 electrolysis could be explained by the favorable accommodation for chemical adsorption and surface kinetics of CO2 on the NiFe@SFM–SDC fuel electrode. In addition, the Faradaic efficiency is close to 100%, indicative of the high selectivity of CO2 reduction to CO. More importantly, this SOEC achieved long-term stability for 500 h under high current operations due to the excellent sintering and coking resistance of the NiFe@SFM fuel electrode. These promising results will lead to new opportunities for efficient CO2 utilization.
