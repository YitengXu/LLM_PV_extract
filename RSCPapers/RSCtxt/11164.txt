    , Accepted 30th October 2012First published on 30th October 2012AbstractWe report a facile route for the fabrication of a unique configuration of carbon-doped strings of ZnO nanoparticles obtained by subjecting solvent vapor annealing followed by direct carbonization to reconstructed block copolymer inverse micelle arrays. The dual role of a carbon (C) moiety has been exploited in significantly enhancing the catalytic performance of C–ZnO nanohybrids under the illumination of visible light. The first role is to create a new energy level above the valence band of ZnO and the other is to act as a channel by which recombination of the excitons is effectively suppressed. The enhanced visible light active photocatalytic efficiency and recyclability of C–ZnO was demonstrated in terms of degradation of a target dye (p-nitrophenol) molecule. Photoelectrochemical water splitting was also performed using C–ZnO on ITO as the working electrode. A significant enhancement in the photocurrent density was obtained for C–ZnO compared with bare ZnO. A plausible mechanism to support the enhanced visible light activity of C–ZnO was proposed.
1 Introduction
Block copolymer (BCP) assisted fabrication of inorganic nanopatterns has drawn wide attention, since they self-assemble to form desired nanostructures under suitable environments.1–4 The self-assembly (SA) of BCPs into regularly sized and spaced nanoscopic elements makes them suitable candidates to create periodic matrices, whilst incorporation of specific nanoparticles (NPs) into the selective BCP domain leads to the formation of an organic–inorganic hybrid with distinct target properties.5–10 Such BCP induced nanoarrays composed of metal or metal oxide have found wide applications in areas such as sensor devices,11 photocatalysis12–14 and photovoltaic devices.15 Among the BCP assisted inorganic nanostructures, nanowire patterns were found to be attractive owing to their enhanced properties over their nanodot counter parts.16–18
BCPs consist of two chemically distinct polymers linked covalently at one end, which enable them to self-assemble into ordered periodic nanostructures with typical dimensions of 10–100 nm.16,17 When a block copolymer inverse micellar solution is spin coated on a substrate, hexagonally arranged nanodots with a soluble corona and an insoluble core are formed in a selective solvent for the corona constituent,6,8,10 whereas nanowires are obtained in a common solvent for both blocks.16,17 The size, shape and spacial features of the microdomains can be controlled by changing the chain length, volume fraction of each block and solvent annealing. The compatibility of the NPs with the BCP microstructure is an important factor in determining the stable inclusion of NPs into the BCP. Poly(styrene-block-2-vinylpyridine) diblock copolymer (PS-b-P2VP) and poly(styrene-block-4-vinylpyridine) diblock copolymer have been commonly used for the incorporation of NPs, since inorganic materials can be easily bound to the polar PVP domains via quarternization of nitrogen in the pyridine ring5,19,20 or by the mutual affinity between the inorganic precursor or pre-synthesized NPs and the PVP block.16,17,21
Nanostructured semiconductors such as ZnO and TiO2 are recognized as excellent materials for the photocatalytic process. Besides TiO2, ZnO has been extensively used due to its high photosensitivity, non-toxic nature, better exciton ability and low cost. Moreover various nanostructures can be easily prepared using ZnO than using TiO2. However, the photocatalytic activities achieved with ZnO have been very modest till now, because ZnO has a wide band gap limiting its absorption of UV light, which constitutes only 4% of the total solar spectrum. Therefore, it is a necessary and important task to modify ZnO in order to exploit the total solar energy. Dye sensitization,22,23 semiconductor coupling24,25 and metal or non-metal doping26–33 have been applied to develop visible light sensitive ZnO. Doping of ZnO with non-metals such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) can lead to the formation of intermediate energy levels in the band gap, thereby enabling it to absorb visible light.28,29,31,32 Among the non-metal dopants, C has been found to be very efficient for visible light induced photocatalysis owing to its additional advantages that it can promote the separation of photoelectrons and holes by channelizing the photo-excited electrons to the nanosized carbons on the surface of the catalyst, thereby reducing the rate of recombination.34,35 Various methods such as self-doping,32 vapor deposition36 and carbonization of solid organic compounds33 have been reported for the introduction of C into ZnO. Even though C is considered as a ubiquitous impurity, addition of an external precursor is necessary in most of the cases. Though various ZnO nanostructures were reported, controlling the morphology and ordered spatial arrangement of the nanostructures have been a commonly seen problem in conventional techniques such as hydrothermal or chemical vapor deposition methods. Liu et al. reported self-doped porous ZnO nanosheet-assembled flowers, but the obtained nanoflowers were of several micrometers in size.32 Although a series of well-defined ZnO nanostructures were prepared by Cho et al., the time taken for the degradation of the dye was more than 6 h.33 Therefore, it is necessary to develop a system having nanoscale dimensions with reasonable catalytic efficiency. Recently, simultaneous use of BCP as structure directing agent as well as carbon source was explored.37 Wang et al.37 reported the preparation of an ordered nanostructured carbon thin film by carbonizing the UV-stabilized monolayer of hexagonally arranged reverse micelles of PS-b-P2VP under an inert atmosphere. In our previous report visible light active C–TiO2 nanodots were developed using poly(styrene-block-ethylene oxide) as the structure directing template as well as the carbon precursor without the addition of any low molecular weight external carbon precursor or catalytic activation processes.14
In this work, a new approach to fabricate highly ordered arrays for ZnO NPs embedded on C nanowires driven by a solvent annealing technique is demonstrated. To this end, surface reconstructed monolayers of PS-b-P2VP inverse micelles were used as the template. The metal/metal oxide precursors can selectively bind to the reactive pyridine groups. Deposition of ZnO precursors followed by solvent annealing leads to the formation of highly dense nanowire patterns composed of strings of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in a polymer matrix. UV-stabilization followed by carbonization of these thin films results in the formation of carbon doped ZnO (C–ZnO), which can be used as a visible light active photocatalyst. Degradation of an environmental pollutant and photoelectrochemical water splitting were demonstrated.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of hybrid ZnO/carbon thin films
The PS-b-P2VP diblock copolymer was purchased from Polymer Source, Inc. and used without further purification. PS-b-P2VP with Mn (PS) = 50000 g mol−1, Mn (P2VP) = 16500 g mol−1, and a polydispersity of 1.09 was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to obtain 0.5 wt% polymer solution. Si substrates were cleaned by sonicating in 2% hellmanex solution for 15 min followed by washing with water 2–3 times and the cleaned wafers were dried using N2 gas. Even though THF acts as a common solvent for both the blocks, it has a relatively high affinity towards the PS block. This leads to the formation of quasi-hexagonally packed arrays of inverse micelles, when 0.5 wt% of PS-b-P2VP solution in THF was spin coated on the Si substrate. The dot morphology was then transformed into wire patterns by annealing the thin film under solvent vapor for 20 min in a glass chamber saturated with THF. The obtained reconstructed film on the substrate was dipped in 0.5 M zinc acetate solution for 2 h. ZnO nanoparticles in a necklace fashion were obtained by treating the film with oxygen plasma (50 sccm gas, 100 W, 30 s). This sample is named as undoped ZnO (ZnO). The partially removed polymer was then cross-linked by exposing UV light under vacuum followed by carbonization at 600 °C for 1 h under an inert atmosphere (Ar). This sample is described as C–ZnO.
In order to conduct photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical experiments the polymer solution was spin coated on quartz and ITO substrates, respectively, following the same steps that were used for preparing C–ZnO on Si substrates. The quartz substrates were cleaned before use by washing with water and ethanol, whereas ITO substrates were cleaned by sequential sonication in acetone, methanol and isopropyl alcohol for 30 min each. The cleaned substrates were dried under N2 gas.
2.2 Instruments and measurements
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed in the tapping mode (Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 scanning force microscope) to investigate the morphology of BCP and C–ZnO films. The crystal phase of the film sample was analyzed using X-ray diffraction with Cu-Kα radiation (D/max RA, Rigaku Co.). The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. Room-temperature micro-Raman scattering spectra were recorded using a McPherson 207 spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen-cooled charge-couple device (CCD) array detector. FTIR measurements were carried out using an FTIR spectrometer (Varian, Scimitar series). The luminescence properties were studied by PL spectroscopy using a DARSA, PSI Co. Ltd equipped with a He–Cd laser. The excitation wavelength was 325 nm. The chemical identity and surface properties of the film sample were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with AlK radiation (hv = 1486.6 eV) as the photosource. UV-vis absorbance and diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using a Sinco S-4100 spectrometer.
2.3 Photocatalytic activities
The photocatalytic degradation of the organic compound on C–ZnO was tested under visible light. 10 ppm of p-nitrophenol (PNP) was prepared in water. A quartz wafer (3 × 4 cm) coated with samples was suspended in 100 ml of PNP in a quartz container. The solution was kept under stirring. The experimental setup was irradiated using a Xe lamp (Newport Co. Ltd, Model 66984) equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter at a power of 450 W as a visible light source. The decrease in absorbance of a certain characteristic peak of PNP was measured at regular intervals using UV-vis spectroscopy (Varian Cary5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer).
Photocurrent measurements were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell using C–ZnO on ITO as the working electrode, a platinum foil as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The system was scanned at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1 in 1 M NaOH electrolyte deaerated by purging N2 gas into the electrolyte in the dark and with simulated sunlight from a Xe lamp with an intensity of 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2 at the sample interface). A Xe lamp having a continuous spectrum between 400 and 700 nm was used as the source of visible light for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical experiments.
3 Results and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation of the nanostructured C–ZnO film using the PS-b-P2VP template. The initial nanodot arrays of BCP inverse micelles, indicated by blue colored spheres, were transformed to strings of inverted micelle patterns with pores at the center of each micelle after solvent annealing.38 ZnO precursors were then introduced into the PVP domains of nanowires in a necklace fashion by dipping the film on the substrate in the precursor solution. ZnO NPs on the BCP matrix were obtained by oxygen plasma treatment. UV stabilization under vacuum followed by calcination in an inert atmosphere converts the BCP to graphitic carbon, resulting in the formation of strings of ZnO NPs embedded in thin carbon layers.
 Scheme 1  Schematic representation of the preparation of C–ZnO. The blue spheres represent the micelles of PS-b-P2VP, which was then converted to wires after solvent annealing. The yellow particles on the wires are the NPs of the ZnO precursor. The olive and grey areas represent the C–ZnO and carbon matrix of the ZnO NPs embedded polymer film after carbonization, respectively. 

Fig. 1 shows a series of height contrast AFM images obtained from each step involved in the preparation of C–ZnO nanostructures on the Si substrate. Fig. 1a is the image of the as-spin coated solution of PS-b-P2VP on the silicon substrate. Even though THF acts as a common solvent for the PS and P2VP blocks, a relatively high affinity towards PS blocks leads to the formation of inverse micelles in solution.38 After the exposure of the spin coated film to THF vapor in a closed chamber, the nanodot arrays are transformed into nanowire arrays induced by the extra mobility imparted by THF vapor (Fig. 1b). As a result, hills and valleys are formed with a regular periodic spacing of ∼24 nm, which is measured using a power spectral density profile of the AFM image (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The ZnO precursor can be coordinated with the pyridine group of P2VP through quarternization of nitrogen,19,20 which is clearly reflected as bright spots on the nanowire after immersing the film in the zinc oxide precursor (Fig. 1c). Conversion of the ZnO precursor to ZnO was attained through oxygen plasma treatment. The slight change in morphology (Fig. 1d) is the result of partial degradation of the polymer caused by oxygen plasma treatment. There is no obvious change in morphology after stabilizing the film using UV light under vacuum (Fig. 1e). After carbonization, the nanowires were shrunken and the nanoparticles were still firmly attached to the nanowires without any aggregation (Fig. 1f). A similar morphology was observed on quartz and ITO substrates (ESI, Fig. S2†).

The crystalline phase of C–ZnO was investigated using XRD. Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of ZnO, where the wurtzite crystalline phase of ZnO was retained in spite of the carbonization at higher temperature. The broad peak centered at a 2θ value of around 25° is assigned to the disordered carbon.39 Raman spectroscopy was used to study the nature of carbonaceous films, where the G band and D band are clearly seen (Fig. 3). The G peak is due to the bond stretching of all pairs of sp2 atoms in both rings and chains. The D peak is due to the breathing modes of sp2 atoms in rings.40–42 The position of the G band, observed at 1500–1600 cm−1 supports the presence of some nanocrystalline carbon and a high content of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms caused by the carbonization of the film and the D band at 1300–1400 cm−1 is an indication of less disordered carbon. The presence of the surface hydroxyl group, which enhances the oxidation of organic compounds,43 was confirmed using FTIR (ESI, Fig. S3†). The existence of such moieties is confirmed by the weak stretching mode of hydroxyl groups at around 3500 cm−1.

It was previously reported that the excited electrons in ZnO can be transferred to carbon nanotubes, graphene and carbon dots through an interfacial charge transfer process, which leads to quenching in emission.43–45 The green emission caused by oxygen vacancies with a peak maximum around 600 nm is a useful probe to study the charge transfer processes from the ZnO surface to carbon. This decrease in emission is a fingerprint of reduced charge recombination. In order to prove this rationale, we compared the photoluminescence (PL) of ZnO and C–ZnO in Fig. 4. The PL intensity of C–ZnO markedly decreased, confirming the assumption that the excited electrons from ZnO can be transferred to the carbon phase.

XPS was used to reveal the chemical environment of C–ZnO thin films on the Si substrate. The core level spectra of Zn (Fig. 5a) show two distinct characteristic peaks of Zn, i.e., Zn 2p3/2 at 1022.7 eV and Zn 2p1/2 at 1045 eV, respectively, which confirms the presence of ZnO moieties on the surface of the film. Fig. 5b shows the O 1s XPS spectra of bare ZnO and C–ZnO, where the red shift of the O 1s peak of C–ZnO compared with bare ZnO can be attributed to the change in the electronic state of oxygen and the significant drop in the intensity of the C–ZnO peak is probably due to the decrease of the oxygen content after carbonization. A high resolution XPS C 1s spectrum of C–ZnO (Fig. 6) was resolved into two constituents centered at 286 eV and 288 eV, corresponding to C–O and CO bonds, respectively. Here we assume that the Zn–O–C bond is formed via hybridization of O 2p and C 2p orbitals leading to the formation of an intermediate band above the VB of ZnO. This new energy level enables C–ZnO to absorb light in the visible region. The peak corresponding to CO probably may be originated from the unoxidized ZnO precursor, i.e., zinc acetate.

The efficiency of C-doping was studied using UV-vis absorbance and diffused reflection spectroscopy. The absorption spectrum of bare ZnO does not display any signs of absorption in the visible region, whereas that of C–ZnO was extended beyond 600 nm (Fig. 7a). This distinct difference in absorption characteristics proves that ZnO is effectively carbonized. The band gap energy was estimated from the tangent with the x-axis in Kubelka–Munk plot, the result of which is displayed in Fig. 7b. C–ZnO shows a reduced band gap energy (∼2.8 eV) compared with neat ZnO (∼3.2 eV) due to the presence of the new energy level, which allows it to absorb visible light.

In order to explore the ability of C–ZnO to absorb visible light, we demonstrated photocatalytic degradation of PNP by irradiation with visible light. For the catalytic measurements, the sample on quartz substrates (3 × 4 cm) was suspended in a quartz vessel containing 100 ml of PNP, which was then kept in the dark for 1 h in order to achieve absorption–desorption equilibrium of dye molecules on the surface of the catalysts before exposing the catalytic system to visible light. The spectral range of the Xe lamp used in this study is between 400 and 700 nm. The photograph of the experimental setup is given in the ESI (Fig. S4†).
The solution was kept under stirring and at regular intervals the decrease in the absorbance of a characteristic peak of PNP at 320 nm was monitored and plotted in Fig. 8a. ZnO shows essentially no catalytic activity under visible light, but 90% degradation of PNP was completed within 2.5 h on C–ZnO. The ratios of absorbance peak intensities at 320 nm after and prior to exposure to visible light for a specified amount of time (I/I0) are plotted against time (Fig. 8b). The first 1 h is used for the dark experiment, which is mentioned as ‘Dark’ in Fig. 7b. The part mentioned as ‘Light’ is utilized for the photocatalytic experiment using visible light. The pH of the initial solution was noted to be 6.5, which was then decreased to 5.5 during the experiment and remained constant till the end of the catalytic process. The catalytic test was repeated using C–ZnO to check the recyclability and stability of the catalyst, and it was found that there is no noticeable reduction in the catalytic activity of C–ZnO even after 4 cycles (Fig. 8c). The photodegradation of PNP without the catalyst was checked by exposing only PNP to light and the change in the absorption profile is measured (ESI, Fig. S5†). No obvious change in absorption intensity was observed during photocatalytic degradation of PNP in the absence of the catalyst. Therefore we assume that efficient degradation of PNP takes place only in the presence of C–ZnO. The corresponding reaction rate constants were calculated for PNP, ZnO and C–ZnO from the slop of log(I/I0) vs. time plot (ESI, Fig. S6†). The linearity of the plot indicates that the catalytic reaction follows pseudo-first order kinetics. The rate constant measured from the C–ZnO catalysts was found to be significantly larger than that obtained from the undoped ZnO.

Visible light induced photoelectrochemical water splitting was also studied using a three-electrode electrochemical configuration using C–ZnO on ITO substrate as the working electrode. Ag/AgCl and Pt wire were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode respectively. The potential was converted to RHE potential by using the equation E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.1976 V + 0.06 pH.46 The photocurrent density versus applied voltage curves were recorded in the dark and under irradiation with the AM 1.5 G simulated solar light (1 Sun, 100 mW cm−2) and are shown in Fig. 9. The nature of the spectrum is the same as that for photocatalytic experiments. The dark scan from −0.5 to 1.75 V versus Ag/AgCl showed almost negligible current for ZnO and C–ZnO, whereas under the illumination of standard simulated solar light, C–ZnO yielded a maximum photocurrent density of 0.8 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V.

J–V curves plotted for bare ZnO and C–ZnO in the dark and light at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in 1 M NaOH electrolyte in the dark and with simulated sunlight from a Xe lamp with an intensity of 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2 at the sample face). The potential was measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. 
The efficiency (η) for water splitting can be calculated using the following equation:46,47η = I(1.23 − Vapp)/Plightwhere, Vapp is the applied voltage, I is the measured current density, and Plight is the power density of the illumination. The maximum photoelectrode efficiency obtained with undoped ZnO is only 0.016%. Under the same condition a maximum photoelectrode efficiency of 0.18% was obtained with C–ZnO nanowires at applied voltage 1.2 V versus RHE, which is 11 times higher than that obtained with bare ZnO.
The mechanism of visible light activity of C–ZnO nanowire is illustrated through the schematic diagram (Scheme 2). Incorporation of C leads to the formation of carbonate species, which creates a new energy level above the VB of ZnO through the hybridization of O 2p and C 2p orbitals. Absorption of visible light by C–ZnO can be made possible because of the reduced energy band gap and the carbon networks on the surface may act as a channel to divert excitons from the CB of ZnO, thereby decreasing the rate of recombination.43–45 Under visible light irradiation, photogenerated electrons in the CB of ZnO can be transferred to the carbon on the surface of ZnO. Dissolved oxygen molecules react with the electrons on the surface of carbon to yield superoxide radical anions, ·O2−. The holes at the VB of ZnO were trapped by surface hydroxyl groups (or H2O) at the catalyst surface to yield ·OH radicals, which are considered as strong oxidizing agents to decompose organic molecules.43 Therefore incorporation of carbon species enhances the visible light absorption of C–ZnO and reduces the recombination of excitons, which in turn improves the catalytic performance of C–ZnO under visible light illumination.

The grey color part indicates that the polymer nanowires turned into carbon and olive color spheres represent C–ZnO. 
4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have suggested a facile preparation route to a unique configuration of C–ZnO nanowires by a simple BCP template protocol. When used as a photocatalyst, C–ZnO degraded PNP completely within 2.5 h and the catalytic efficiency did not decline after repeated cycles. A maximum photocurrent density of 0.8 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V was obtained on C–ZnO corresponding to 0.18% photoelectrode efficiency, which is 11 times higher than that of undoped ZnO. The enhanced photocurrent density and the associated photoelectrode efficiency under visible light illumination can be attributed to the efficiency of carbon doping on ZnO and the extra role of carbon as a channel in reducing the recombination of electron and hole pairs. As a whole, our work can be recognized as a novel route to produce hydrogen via photo-electrochemical water splitting under visible light through BCP assisted formation of C–ZnO nanowires.

 	Scheme 1  Schematic representation of the preparation of C–ZnO. The blue spheres represent the micelles of PS-b-P2VP, which was then converted to wires after solvent annealing. The yellow particles on the wires are the NPs of the ZnO precursor. The olive and grey areas represent the C–ZnO and carbon matrix of the ZnO NPs embedded polymer film after carbonization, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a) AFM height contrast image of as spin coated polymer solution on the Si substrate. (b) The evolution of nanowires after solvent annealing. (c) The image of the film after dipping in ZnO precursor solution. The bright spots on the nanowires are the ZnO precursor NPs. (d) After oxygen plasma treatment and (e) after stabilization of the film under UV light. (f) The image of the ZnO NPs embedded nanowires after carbonization.	 

 	Fig. 2  XRD pattern of the wurtzite phase of the C–ZnO thin film with the additional peak of carbon.	 

 	Fig. 3  Raman spectra of the C–ZnO thin film showing G and D bands.	 

 	Fig. 4  PL spectrum of ZnO and C–ZnO thin films showing the quenching of emission after carbonization.	 

 	Fig. 5  XPS spectra of Zn 2p (a) and O 1s (b) in the C–ZnO thin film.	 

 	Fig. 6  XPS spectrum of C–ZnO. The solid and dotted lines are the experiment and fitting spectra, respectively, and the dark line at the bottom is the base line.	 

 	Fig. 7  UV-Vis absorbance spectra (a) and Kubelka–Munk plot (b) of bare ZnO and C–ZnO.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Visible light driven photocatalytic degradation of PNP. (b) The plot of absorbance of PNP at 320 nm for a particular time after catalytic reaction (I) versus initial absorbance at 320 nm (I0). (c) Recyclability test of photocatalytic efficiency of C–ZnO.	 

 	Fig. 9  
J–V curves plotted for bare ZnO and C–ZnO in the dark and light at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in 1 M NaOH electrolyte in the dark and with simulated sunlight from a Xe lamp with an intensity of 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2 at the sample face). The potential was measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode.	 
η = I(1.23 − Vapp)/Plight

 	Scheme 2  The schematic elucidation of the new energy level created by the incorporation of carbon into ZnO and the additional role of carbon in improving the catalytic efficiency of C–ZnO. The grey color part indicates that the polymer nanowires turned into carbon and olive color spheres represent C–ZnO.
