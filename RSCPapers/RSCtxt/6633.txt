    , Accepted 14th July 2015First published on 30th July 2015AbstractPores and surface functional groups are endowed on graphene nanosheets (GNSs) to improve their electrochemical Na+ storage properties. An optimal capacity of 220 mA g−1 is obtained (at a charge–discharge rate of 0.03 A g−1) in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate mixed electrolyte containing 1 M NaClO4. Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques are employed to study the electrode charge storage mechanism. The results indicate that reversible surface redox reactions at the electrode surface are the predominant processes affecting charge storage in a potential range of 0.5–2.0 V (vs. Na/Na+), whereas Na+ intercalation/deintercalation between carbon layers occurs at lower potentials. When the charge–discharge rate was increased by >300 fold (to 10 A g−1), a capacity as high as 85 mA h g−1 is obtained, reflecting the excellent rate capability of the electrode. The physiochemical characteristics that affect the Na+ storage performance are explored. A highly promising GNS anode for sodium-ion batteries is proposed.
1. Introduction
Energy issues have become a significant global concern due to the threat of climate change and the decreasing availability of fossil fuels. Utilization of renewable energy has great potential to solve these problems. However, renewable energy (such as wind and solar power) is intermittent. Effective energy storage techniques are urgently needed to level the power output, which would increase the penetration of renewable energy into the electric grid.1 In this context, Na-based energy storage technologies have attracted a lot of attention because Na is low-cost, abundant, and easy to recycle.2 Na–sulfur batteries,3 Na–air batteries,4 and Na-ion batteries (NIBs)5 have been investigated. Among these, NIBs possess the advantages of high voltage, good safety, and great charge–discharge reversibility.6,7 Nevertheless, research on NIBs is in the early stages and NIB performance is still far from optimal. Further investigation is required to find more suitable electrode materials (and their synthesis methods) and to understand the underlying energy storage mechanisms, leading to cost-effective NIBs.
Electrode materials analogous to those in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been sought for NIBs.8 However, the typical anodes for LIBs, namely graphite-based materials, show unfavorable properties towards Na+ storage,9 because the highly crystalline and rigid graphitic layers with a d-spacing of 0.335 nm have a high energy barrier for the insertion of large Na+ (1.02 Å vs. 0.76 Å for Li+).10 There are two approaches for overcoming this limitation of carbon-based materials,11,12 which are more inexpensive, widely available, and durable than alloy and conversion types of NIB anodes.6 The first approach is to decrease crystallinity and the second is to reduce the particle size. Hard carbon, characterized by a distorted graphitic structure with a large interlayer d-spacing, is a promising NIB anode that can deliver a high capacity of more than 200 mA h g−1.11 However, this material is limited by its unsatisfactory rate capability13 and low charging potential (near 0 V vs. Na), which could result in the electrodeposition of metallic Na and consequently greater electrode instability and safety concerns.14 Reducing the material size can improve charge–discharge properties by increasing the electrode utilization and shortening the ion diffusion length.15 Carbon nanotubes,16 hollow carbon nanospheres,17 and hollow carbon nanowires10 have been synthesized for use in NIB anodes. Graphene nanosheets (GNSs), characterized by a two-dimensional (2D) architecture and excellent conductivity, have recently been studied.18,19 Due to their less rigid carbon layers and large accessible area (both favorable for hosting Na+), a promising capacity (>200 mA h g−1) with favorable high-rate performance has been found. Nevertheless, the charge storage mechanism of GNSs remains unclear, with no consensus in the literature. Chou et al. proposed that the adsorption of Na+ on the GNS surface is the dominant reaction.18 In contrast, Zhang et al. suggested that Na+ insertion occurs between carbon layers at above 0.1 V (vs. Na), and that Na+ fills the GNS micropores at lower potentials.19 Regarding these divergent opinions (with no solid experimental evidence), further systematic study on the Na+ storage mechanism is necessary before the advantages of GNS electrodes can be fully utilized.
To further increase the number of electroactive sites and efficient pathways for ion transport, holey GNSs have been synthesized for use in various energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and LIBs.20 The porosity of GNSs can be created via KOH activation,21 HNO3 oxidation,22 and template-assisted synthesis methods.23 Although promising electrochemical performance has been found, these preparation procedures are complicated. Moreover, the removal of the etching agents and template requires extra effort and cost. Any remaining residuals would deteriorate the electrode properties. The development of a more facile and scaleable strategy for fabricating holey GNSs with high purity and high performance towards Na+ storage is our goal. Endowing oxygen-containing functional groups on a carbon surface was found to be beneficial for increasing Li+ storage capacity.24 Reversible and fast redox reactions between the surface groups and Li+ have been proposed.25 Recently, surface functional groups have also been endowed on carbon fibers and carbon foams to improve the Na+ storage performance.26,27 Whether a similar phenomenon can occur for functionalized GNSs towards Na+ storage and if so, what is the mechanism, are studied in this work. The endowed porosity and surface groups are intended to improve Na+ charge–discharge kinetics, aiming to overcome the high-rate limitations (due to the large size of Na+) usually encountered for NIB electrodes.8
In the present study, an effective method is developed for synthesizing holey GNSs. The effects of the porosity and surface oxygen-containing groups, which can be quantitatively controlled by the synthesis conditions, on the electrochemical performance of the GNS electrodes are investigated. A promising NIB anode, especially for high-power applications, is proposed. The Na+ storage mechanism of various GNSs is examined by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV), together with ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Three potential-dependent sodiation/desodiation mechanisms, namely a double-layer charging/discharging reaction, a surface group redox reaction, and a Na+ intercalation/deintercalation reaction, are disclosed for the first time for GNSs. Based on the mechanisms and key material factors found to determine the electrochemical properties, further design of NIB electrodes with superior performance can be expected.
2. Experimental procedure
GNSs were synthesized using a modified Staudenmaier method; the preparation details can be found in our previous papers.28,29 Briefly, graphite oxide (GO), chemically oxidized from natural graphite (Alfa Aesar; particle size: ∼70 μm; purity: 99.999%), was reduced and exfoliated via heating in an Ar-filled tube furnace up to 300 and 1100 °C, respectively. It was found that ∼300 °C is the lowest temperature at which GNSs can be exfoliated. Two heating rates were adopted. (i) GO was placed in the furnace and then heated at a rate of 1 °C min−1. (ii) GO was quickly transferred into the furnace, which had been pre-held at the set-up temperatures. The heating rate for GO was estimated to be >100 °C s−1. After the thermal process, GNSs were obtained.
The microstructures of the samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; FEI Inspect F50) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL 2100F). XPS (VG Sigma Probe) was employed to study the surface chemical compositions. A Raman spectrometer (UniRAM MicroRaman) was used to examine the bonding structure of GNSs. The spectra were excited by using a diode-pump solid-state laser with a wavelength of 532 nm. The GNS thickness was evaluated using atomic force microscopy (AFM; Veeco/DI NanoMan D3100CL). XRD (Bruker D8 Advance, with a Cu target) was used to analyze the material crystallinity.
To prepare an electrode, a slurry, made up of 70 wt% active material powders, 20 wt% carbon black, and 10 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solution, was pasted onto Cu foil and vacuum-dried at 110 °C for 3 h. This electrode was then roll-pressed and punched to match the required dimensions of a CR2032 coin cell. On the 1.3 cm2 Cu substrate, the typical coating thickness and mass loading of various GNSs are all ∼10 μm and 0.5 mg, respectively, corresponding to a tape density of ∼0.38 g cm−3. Na foil and a Celgard polypropylene membrane were used as the counter electrode and the separator, respectively. The electrolyte was composed of 1:1 (by volume) ethylene carbonate (EC, 99 wt%, Alfa Aesar) and diethyl carbonate (DEC, 99 wt%, Alfa Aesar) with 1 M NaClO4 solute. Assembly of the coin cell was performed in an argon-filled glovebox (Innovation Technology Co. Ltd), where both the moisture content and oxygen content were maintained below 0.1 ppm. CV was performed using a Biologic VSP-300 electrochemical workstation between 0.01 and 2.0 V. The charge–discharge performance (in terms of capacity, high-rate capability, and cyclic stability) of the cells was evaluated at 25 °C (within a voltage range of 0.01–2 V) using an Arbin BT-2043 battery tester; the data were acquired after 5 cycles of conditioning (at a rate of 0.03 A g−1), at which point the electrode properties were stable.
For the ex situ XRD analyses, the electrodes were pre-set at various potentials for 1 h in the coin cells. The electrodes were then taken out from the cells and subjected to synchrotron XRD investigation (Beamlines 01C and 17A, National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Taiwan, operating with an electron energy of 1.5 GeV and a current of ∼300 mA). The 2D diffraction signals were collected using a Mar345 image plate detector for 5 minutes and then converted to one-dimensional patterns using Fit2D software. It was found that due to the low crystallinity and low quantity of GNSs on the electrodes, the in-house XRD apparatus with a low photon flux of X-rays was not able to record the structural variations upon potential changes.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows a SEM micrograph of the GNSs produced via heating at a rate of 1 °C min−1 to 300 °C. A flake-like morphology of exfoliated carbon nanosheets was observed (this sample is denoted as GNS-300 hereafter). The TEM image of the GNSs is shown in Fig. S1(a).† The wrinkles of the GNSs are related to the existence of sp3-hybridized carbon, which causes local surface nonuniformity.30 Fig. S2† shows the AFM analysis results, which reveal that the thickness of the nanosheet was approximately 4 nm, corresponding to 3–5 graphene layers.31,32 As shown in Fig. 1(b), with a high heating rate (>100 °C s−1 to 300 °C), holey GNSs were obtained (denoted as HGNS-300). The typical pore size was 50–100 nm. During the thermal reduction of graphite oxide (GO), the decomposition of the carbon–oxygen bonds produces gas, which builds up pressure between carbon layers.33 When the heating rate is sufficiently high, the accumulated gas not only exfoliates graphite but also punches holes through GNSs. GO sheets subjected to severe oxidation have many defective regions,34 which are locally weak and thus are preferentially damaged, leaving behind the holey structure.

A higher temperature of 1100 °C (with a heating rate of >100 °C s−1) was also adopted to prepare GNSs (denoted as HGNS-1100). As shown in Fig. 1(c), the morphology is similar to that in Fig. 1(b), again revealing that the rapid heating leads to pore formation (also see TEM images in Fig. S1†). Accordingly, the proposed process for synthesizing holey GNSs is effective and economical. The pore size distributions of HGNS-300 and HGNS-1100 are compared in Fig. S3,† revealing that the latter possesses slightly larger pores. It is noted that this facile method is template-free, residue-free, and should be easily scalable. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area values for GNS-300, HGNS-300, and HGNS-1100 are 550, 750, and 800 m2 g−1, respectively. Clearly, the pores created extra surface area on the GNSs. Moreover, a higher temperature promoted the decomposition of the carbon–oxygen bonds (and thus gas release), enhancing pore formation.
The chemical composition of the GNSs was evaluated using XPS; the obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 2. GNS-300 and HGNS-300 have similar O concentrations (∼12 at%), although these two samples have quite different morphologies (see Fig. 1). The O content is essentially independent of the heating rate. When the reduction temperature was increased to 1100 °C (for HGNS-1100), the oxygen signal significantly diminished (<3 at%), indicating that the amount of oxygen-containing groups was reduced. As demonstrated in the high-resolution C 1s spectra (Fig. S4†), C–OH, C–O–C, CO, and OC–O groups co-existed on the GNS surface, with HGNS-1100 showing lower concentrations of all species compared to those of GNS-300 and HGNS-300. The sheet resistance values of various samples are shown in Fig. S5.† The results indicate that a low O content of GNSs leads to a high electronic conductivity.

Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of various prepared GNSs. A D band (at ∼1350 cm−1) and a G band (at ∼1580 cm−1) can be clearly recognized. The former is associated with imperfect sp2 carbon bonding, while the latter results from the Raman-allowed phonon vibration of well-ordered graphite.35 As shown, the D-to-G band intensity ratios (ID/IG) of GNS-300 and HGNS-300 are 0.93 and 1.02, respectively. This can be attributed to the increased number of defect sites along the pore edges. It is noted that the ID/IG ratio of HGNS-1100 further increased to 1.28. The thermally induced removal of oxygen functional groups on GNSs created more defective regions (or more pores, as revealed in the BET analyses), increasing the D band intensity.

The crystallinity of various samples was examined by XRD; the obtained diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. 4. The graphite produced a distinct peak at 26.5°, which is attributed to the (002) plane reflection with a d-spacing of 0.335 nm (according to Bragg's law). After chemical oxidation, the resulting GO had the (002) peak shifted to 11.1°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 0.798 nm. The large number of oxygen-containing groups between the carbon layers is responsible for the lattice extension and low crystallinity of GO.36 As shown, after the thermal reduction, the diffraction peaks of the obtained GNSs weakened and broadened. This can be ascribed to the exfoliation of GO, which results in a decreased number of graphene layers of GNSs. The enlarged spectra shown in the inset of Fig. 4 reveal that GNS-300 and HGNS-300 have a similar (002) peak position of ∼23.7°, representing a d-spacing of ∼0.375 nm. When the reduction temperature was increased to 1100 °C (for HGNS-1100), the d-spacing reduced to ∼0.350 nm (peak located at ∼25.4°) due to a more complete removal of the oxygen groups between the carbon layers. These data are in line with the XPS results.

Fig. 5(a)–(c) show the initial five CV scans of various GNS electrodes. In the first negative scan, a clear irreversible peak emerged at ∼0.4 V for each electrode. This is associated with electrolyte decomposition and solid–electrolyte-interface (SEI) film formation.37 It is noted that the HGNS-1100 electrode exhibited a sharper peak with a higher current density. The larger number of defective sites in HGNS-1100 (as revealed in Raman analyses) is responsible for the higher first-cycle irreversibility. These results are consistent with the theoretical calculation, which indicated that the reactivity of the defects is much higher than that of the perfect basal plane of graphene.38 However, as shown, the redox behavior gradually became stable in the subsequent CV cycles for every electrode. Fig. 5(d) compares the saturated CV curves of the electrodes. All the curves are characterized by an approximately rectangular shape above 0.5 V and a distinct cathodic peak at lower potentials. As demonstrated, the GNS-300 and HGNS-300 electrodes show similar but clearly higher current density as compared to that of the HGNS-1100 electrode at a low CV scan rate (i.e., 0.1 mV s−1). The C/O ratio (related to the reduction temperature) seems to play a crucial role in determining the electrochemical Na+ storage capability.

To clarify the charge storage characteristics, CV scans with various cathodic potential limits (the anodic limit was fixed at 3.0 V) of the GNS-300, HGNS-300, and HGNS-1100 electrodes were obtained; the data are shown in Fig. 6. Irrespective of the electrode, with a cathodic limit of above 2.0 V, the CV curves are ideally rectangular. Moreover, the response current is independent of the potential scanning range. This indicates an electric double-layer charging/discharging behavior, which is associated with the physical absorption/desorption of Na+ on the GNS surface. When the potential lower limit was further extended (from 2.0 to 0.5 V), it was found that the cathodic current began to increase and the subsequent anodic enclosed area expanded. Certain redox reactions were triggered at low potentials, leading to the pseudocapacitive behavior. As shown in Fig. 6(d), the GNS-300 and HGNS-300 electrodes show considerably higher capacitances than that of the HGNS-1100 electrode in both potential regions. Although the BET value of HGNS-1100 is the highest, its electrolyte-accessible area was limited, probably due to easy restacking of the GNSs with a low oxygen content, resulting in the lowest double-layer capacitance. In the pseudocapacitive region (2.0 to 0.5 V), the surface functional groups seem to play a role, leading to the superior performance of the GNS-300 and HGNS-300 electrodes.
 Fig. 6  CV scans (after 5 cycles of conditioning) for (a) GNS-300, (b) HGNS-300, and (c) HGNS-1100 electrodes. Potential was scanned from a fixed potential of 3.0 V to various cathodic potential limits with a rate of 1 mV s−1. (d) Capacitances calculated from (a–c) with various cathodic potential limits. 

Ex situ XPS analyses were conducted to explore the reaction mechanism in the pseudocapacitive potential region. Fig. 7 shows the results of the HGNS-300 and HGNS-1100 electrodes sodiated at 0.9 V (to avoid interference of SEI formation at lower potentials) and then desodiated at 2.0 V. For the sodiated HGNS-300 electrode, a clear Na signal was detected. The Na 1s binding energy peak at 1073.5 eV indicates that Na–O–C is the main species on the electrode surface.39 There is no Cl signal in the obtained spectrum, which excludes the existence of residual NaClO4 at the electrode. This indicates the formation of chemical bonds between the HGNS-300 surface and Na+. As shown, upon desodiation, the Na signal was clearly suppressed, suggesting that this reaction is reversible. For the HGNS-1100 electrode, although a similar reversible sodiation/desodiation process was observed, the Na signal intensity was significantly lower than that of HGNS-300. Based on these experimental results, the following Na+ storage reaction is proposed, which is analogous to the reported Li chemistry:25 >CO + Na+ + e− ↔ >C–O–Na(1)
 Fig. 7  
Ex situ XPS spectra of (a) HGNS-300 and (b) HGNS-1100 electrodes sodiated at 0.9 V and then desodiated at 2.0 V. 
As also shown in Fig. 6, there is an additional reduction reaction below 0.5 V and a clear anodic current increase at the reverse CV scan. To determine what reaction had occurred, ex situ synchrotron XRD examinations were performed. Fig. 8(a) shows the obtained data for the HGNS-300 electrode (the GNS-300 electrode showed similar results; as presented in Fig. S6†). The noise peaks in the XRD patterns are ascribed to the residual salt from the electrolyte. When the potential was above 0.5 V, the (002) peak positions were not altered, indicating no crystallinity change. However, a clear peak broadening and a negative shift of the diffraction angle (reflecting an increased d-spacing) were observed at potentials below 0.5 V. This was associated with the intercalation of Na+ between the carbon layers, which led to the expansion and distortion of the lattices. It was also found that the (002) diffraction peak (both the angle and intensity) was restored when the applied potential was switched back to 2.0 V. A Na+ deintercalation reaction of high reversibility was thus confirmed. In Fig. 6, there are no distinct deintercalation peaks. Instead, hysteresis can be observed in the subsequent CV anodic scans. This is related to the existence of GNS defects, which may hinder the smooth release of Na+ from the electrodes.40Fig. 8(b) shows the results for the HGNS-1100 electrode. Under the same experimental conditions, the shift of the XRD peaks was insignificant. These results can be attributed to the smaller d-spacing (0.350 nm) of HGNS-1100, which is less favorable for Na+ insertion/desertion. It has been reported that in order to achieve better Na+ accommodation, the carbon interlayer spacing should be higher than 0.37 nm.10 Our data agree with this suggestion. This also explains the considerably smaller CV charge below 0.5 V for HGNS-1100 (compared to those of GNS-300 and HGNS-300) in Fig. 6(d). It should be noted that the XRD analyses were conducted when the applied potential was removed; therefore, the XRD peak shift upon potential change could be underestimated.

The first-cycle charge–discharge curves of various electrodes are shown in Fig. S7.† The coulombic efficiency of the GNS-300, HGNS-300, and HGNS-1100 electrodes was 26%, 22%, and 15%, respectively. The irreversible capacity loss is attributed to the electrolyte decomposition and SEI formation, as found in the CV analyses. Fig. 9 shows the charge–discharge curves of the three GNS electrodes recorded at a current density of 0.03 A g−1 (after 5 conditioning cycles). The reversible discharge (desodiation) capacities of GNS-300, HGNS-300, and HGNS-1100 were 220, 220, and 147 mA h g−1, respectively. The superior capacities of the former two electrodes can be attributed to the higher pseudocapacitances and the promoted intercalation/deintercalation reactions. This capacity value of ∼220 mA h g−1 is clearly higher than the reported values for graphite (32 mA h g−1),9 carbon fibers (200 mA h g−1),41 petroleum coke (100 mA h g−1),42 and disordered carbon (130 mA h g−1),43 since these conventional NIB anode materials have lower surface active areas and smaller d-spacings than those of the proposed GNS electrode.
 Fig. 9  Charge–discharge curves of various GNS electrodes recorded at a current density of 0.03 A g−1. 
The rate capability of the GNS electrodes was also evaluated. The charge–discharge data are shown in Fig. 10. As summarized in Table 1, the capacity retentions at 10 A g−1, compared to the capacities measured at 0.03 A g−1, were 39 and 30%, respectively, for the HGNS-300 and HGNS-1100 electrodes. The higher number of surface functional groups and the larger d-spacing for HGNS-300 facilitate Na+ uptake/release, resulting in the superior high-rate performance. Table 1 also indicates that although GNS-300 and HGNS-300 have similar capacities at relatively low rates (when mass transfer limitation of Na+ is not encountered), the latter electrode clearly shows better rate capability. This can be explained by the holey graphene structure, which increases electrolyte accessibility and shortens the Na+ diffusion path, improving electrode kinetics. The excellent high-rate capacity of the HGNS-300 electrode (160 mA h g−1@0.5 A g−1 or 85 mA h g−1@10 A g−1) clearly outperforms those of previously reported carbon-based NIB anodes, such as a hard carbon electrode (100 mA h g−1@1 A g−1),44 a hollow carbon nanosphere electrode (75 mA h g−1@5 A g−1),17 a hollow carbon nanowire electrode (149 mA h g−1@0.5 A g−1),10 a carbon-nanotube-based electrode (55 mA h g−1@0.1 A g−1),16 and a reduced graphene oxide paper electrode (60 mA h g−1@2.4 A g−1).45

Fig. 11 shows the cyclic stability of various GNS electrodes evaluated with a charge–discharge rate of 0.1 A g−1. As shown, the GNS-300, HGNS-300, and HGNS-1100 electrodes retain 70, 70, and 80% of their initial discharge capacities after 500 cycles. The capacity decays mainly occurred in the initial cycles and can be attributed to the trapping of Na+ inside GNSs, which reduces the number of active storage sites in the subsequent charge–discharge process. The GNSs synthesized at 300 °C with higher numbers of oxygen-containing surface groups could partially trap Na+ (to a higher extent), leading to higher capacity loss upon cycling. These arguments are supported by the relatively low charge–discharge efficiency of the GNS-300 and HGNS-300 electrodes in the initial cycles (see Fig. 11). Nevertheless, the coulombic efficiency of all electrodes gradually increased, approaching saturation (>99%) after approximately 20 cycles, at which point their capacities also stabilized. After the 500-cycle tests, the cells were opened and the GNS electrodes were subjected to postmortem SEM examinations. The results, shown in Fig. S8,† reveal the great structural integrity of all the electrodes. As shown, the flake-like morphology of GNSs was retained; no substantial electrode damage was observed. The satisfactory durability of the proposed GNS electrodes was thus confirmed.

4. Conclusion
The storage of Na+ in GNSs has three mechanisms, namely those involving a double-layer charging/discharging reaction at 2.0–3.0 V, a surface group redox reaction at 0.5–2.0 V, and a Na+ intercalation/deintercalation reaction at below 0.5 V. By reducing the thermal reduction temperature, the number of oxygen-containing functional groups on GNSs increased. These groups not only provide surface redox sites but also extend the inter-layer distances between carbon (002) planes, promoting Na+ accommodation. By using a high heating rate for synthesis, holey GNSs were obtained, which enhanced the electrolyte accessibility and shortened the Na+ diffusion path. As a result, the HGNS-300 electrode showed excellent reversible capacities of 220 and 85 mA h g−1 at rates of 0.03 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, this electrode can retain ∼70% of its initial capacity after 500 charge–discharge cycles. These properties endow this anode great potential for NIB applications. The reported favorable physiochemical characteristics for Na+ storage (e.g., large d-spacing, appropriate surface groups, and holey architecture) can guide future design of other electrode materials with enhanced properties for NIBs.
