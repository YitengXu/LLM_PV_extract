    , Accepted 14th February 2012First published on 14th February 2012AbstractThe champion dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on TiO2 nanoparticles nearly reach the limit of photo-current density using the black dye or zinc porphyrin dye as sensitizer. However, the way to make ordinary DSSCs more efficient as well as to understand the mechanism is still essential. Here we present an elegant UV irradiation treatment of TiO2 nanosheets to enhance the performance of DSSCs based on the TiO2 nanosheets via room temperature removal of inorganic surfactants and reconstruction of the (001) surface of TiO2 nanosheets, killing two birds with one stone. UV irradiation was utilized to remove the fluorine-surfactant on the surface of anatase TiO2 nanosheets with a high percentage of exposed {001} facets which were synthesized with the aid of hydrofluoric acid. The nanosheets treated with UV irradiation for 40 min had the advantage of improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs by 17.6%, compared to that without UV treatment when they were introduced into DSSCs as photoanode materials. The improved efficiency was ascribed to more dye adsorption. A theoretical calculation proposed that UV irradiation induced microfaceted steps on the TiO2 surface by two domain (1 × 4) reconstruction after UV irradiating the (1 × 1) (001) surface. The microfaceted steps increase the active surface area of the TiO2 nanosheets by increasing the exposure of titanium atoms and engendering active sites.
1. Introduction
The functional properties of materials depend closely on the nanostructures of the materials, including crystal size, orientation, morphology, aspect ratio and so on.1 In order to get special nanostructures, surfactants or structure-directing agents are generally used.1–12 However, the surface of the nanostructures is usually contaminated by the surfactants. So as to expose the functional clean surface, the surfactants must be removed. Calcinations are generally used to remove the surfactants or structure-directing agents.13–16 Nevertheless, the temperature of the calcinations is usually higher than 600 °C. Such a high temperature often induces the collapse and aggregation of the nanostructures,16 which disfunctionalized the materials. Since Keene et al. introduced ozone treatment for the removal of surfactants,17 UV/ozone or UV/H2O2 treatments have been developed to remove the organic surfactants.18–22 To our best knowledge, the UV irradiation method for the removal of inorganic surfactants has not been reported. A typical example is TiO2 nanosheets with higher-surface-energy {001} facets. The anatase TiO2 nanosheets with highly reactive {001} facets exposed are expected to exhibit fascinating chemical activities, such as when they are utilized as photoanodes material in DSSCs to improve their efficiency, unfortunately, they are disfunctionalized because these facets are usually covered by the fluorine-surfactant introduced during the nanostructures preparation.11 The fluorine-surfactants were generally removed by calcinations or washing with NaOH aqueous solution.23,24 Generally, the sintering temperature must be 600 °C at least to remove the fluorine-surfactant completely.11 It is much higher than 500 °C which is the sintering temperature limit for some technical reasons in DSSCs device assembly.25 Washing with NaOH aqueous solution is not adaptable for DSSCs due to the acidic nature of dyes.26 As a result, UV irradiation treatment can be an optional and elegant way to eliminate the fluorine-surfactant for DSSCs.
More dye-adsorption is also an important factor to improve the efficiency of DSSCs. In DSSCs, dye molecules anchor themselves to titanium atoms by carboxyl groups.27–29 On the basis of our previous work, the amount of dye adsorbed per unit surface area is about 3 × 10−7 mol m−2.30 For dye molecules, the adsorption area for each dye molecule is about 1.4 nm2.27 So, the coverage ratio between dye molecules and TiO2 surface is about 25%. According to the report of Lazzeri, the density of the fivefold-coordinated titanium atoms, on which dye molecules anchor, is 7.0 nm−2 on the anatase (001) surface.31 Thus, only 2.5% of titanium atoms on the TiO2 (001) surface have the opportunity to link with dye molecules for the single-bond anchoring between dye molecular and Ti atom. So, there is much scope to increase the amount of dye adsorption. When dye adsorption is increased, the thickness of the photoelectrode can be reduced to decrease carrier recombination.32,33 The general way to elevate the total amount of dye adsorbed is to increase the surface area by shrinking the particle size. But the density of dye adsorption cannot be increased. Moreover, an excessively small particle size will decrease diffusion coefficients of electrons, which is deleterious for DSSCs.34 So the key point is to enlarge the active surface area by increasing the density of active sites on nanoparticles. In our previous work, it was found that the increased surface oxygen vacancies could induce more dye adsorption to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency.30 It was proved that oxygen vacancies can act as one kind of active sites. The alternative way is to expose more Ti atoms on the surface considering that dye molecules usually anchor to titanium atoms. For instance, the TiO2 (001) and (103) faceted surface, which possesses the two highest densities of titanium atoms on the surface,31 can be an optional selection. Herman reported that an anatase TiO2 (001) surface can be reconstructed to form a microfaceted surface that exposes (103) and (03) surface planes.35 A similar situation was reported by Chambers et al.36 Additionally, the reconstructed surface with the faceted subsurface resembles the roughened surface, which exposes more titanium atoms than the smooth surface. Moreover, either the unreconstructed (001) surface or the reconstructed (103) surface exposes the two highest densities of titanium atoms, so they are expected to exhibit excellent performance in dye adsorption. The effect should be experimentally verified and the mechanism should be theoretically investigated.
It is well known that TiO2 strongly absorbs UV-light. The TiO2 surface can get much more energy from UV irradiation. In this case, the surface reconstruction effect is relatively easy to realize. In this work, UV irradiation is an elegant method to kill two birds with one stone, removing the fluorine-surfactant and increasing the active surface area of the TiO2 surface. A theoretical calculation was also given to explain the mechanism of the increased active surface area for dye adsorption.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of TiO2 nanoparticles
TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized as reported.12 Briefly, 25 mL of Ti(OBu)4 was added in a 100 mL Teflon pot and 3 mL of hydrofluoric acid was added dropwise under stirring. After stirring for 15 min at room temperature, the Teflon pot was sealed and kept at 250 °C for 24 h. Finally, the resulting precipitate was triply centrifuged and washed with ethanol to remove the hydrofluoric acid and organics, producing about 5.7 g of the white precipitate.
2.2. Preparation of the paste for DSSCs
The obtained TiO2 nanoparticles (3.0 g) and 0.6 g of acetic acid were ground in a mortar for 5 min. Then, 1 mL of H2O was added. The mixture was ground in the mortar until H2O almost evaporated. Another 1 mL of H2O was added and ground following the above step. This was repeated 2 additional times. Next, 1 mL of ethanol was added and then ground for 5 min. Then, another 1 mL of ethanol was added and then ground. This procedure was repeated until the mixture becomes a stabilized colloid. The colloid was treated with an ultrasonic horn for 2 h for dispersion. Terpinol (6 g) and ethyl cellulose (1.5 g) were added to the colloid. The mixture was treated with an ultrasonic horn for 30 min. Finally, the colloid was concentrated with a rotary evaporator for 2 h at 35 °C. Thus, a paste was obtained.
2.3. Preparation of the electrode for DSSCs
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass (15 Ω sq−1) was cleaned by being scoured with a surfactant, treated with ultrasonic washing, and swilled with deionized water. The UV irradiated clean conductive glass substrate was then coated with a thin layer of TiO2 by immersion in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min to prevent the short circuit caused by the direct contact between the electrolyte and the FTO. A 120 μm layer of the paste was coated onto the substrate using a doctor-blade technique. After being dried at 125 °C in the air, the double layer film was sintered at 500 °C in an air flow to remove the organic template (ethyl cellulose) which was used to form porous film. The organic template can be removed when the calcination temperature reached 450 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†). When being cooled to room temperature, the film was exposed to UV irradiation. The UV-light irradiator is a custom machine with low-pressure mercury lamps whose central wavelength is 254 nm. The UV-light intensity of the lamp is about 20 mW cm−2 (measured by a Newport power meter with a sensor of 818-ST-UV). The film was then immersed into N719 ethanol solution. The counter electrode was a magnetron sputter platinum mirror. The substrate, film, and counter electrode constituted a sandwich-like open cell. The electrolyte was composed of 1.0 M BMII, 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M GNCS in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 85∶15).
2.4. Characterization
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku Ultima III X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα) in the range of 20–80°. In order to exclude the effect of SnO2 crystals on the XRD patterns of TiO2, the sample film for XRD was prepared on the non-conductive side of the FTO. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis was conducted using a JEOL 3010 transmission electron microscope. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out with a PHI 5000 Versa Probe X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Al Kα). The test for photoelectric performance was carried out, with an active area of 0.132 cm2, on a Keithley 236 source measurement unit under AM 1.5 illumination cast by an Oriel 92251A-1000 sunlight simulator calibrated by the standard reference of a Newport 91150 silicon solar cell. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement was carried out on a Bruker EMX-10/12 EPR spectrometer. TiO2 powder, scrapped off from the porous TiO2 film irradiated by UV light for various times, was used for EPR measurement.
2.5. Theoretical calculation
Calculations were carried out using density functional theory (DFT)37,38 as implemented in the VASP code.39,40 Exchange–correlation effects were treated within the generalized gradient approximation (the PW91 functional).41 For O and Ti, the 2p and 3d orbitals were included as valence states respectively. A 500 eV cutoff of plane-wave expansion was used and the calculation of total energy is done using conjugate-gradient (CG) and quasi-Newton methods for geometry relaxation. The atoms positions are relaxed until the forces on all unconstrained atoms are less than 0.05 eV Å−1. A 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack mesh was used for all calculations.42
3. Results and discussion
3.1. X-Ray diffraction analysis
In order to identify the crystal phase of the TiO2 and the effect of UV irradiation on the crystal structure of the TiO2, XRD measurements were conducted. The results are shown in Fig. 1. Hereafter, UV0, UV10, UV20, UV40 and UV80 denote the samples with irradiation time of 0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 minutes, respectively. Compared with the standard XRD peaks of anatase TiO2 powder (JCPDS 84-1286, on the bottom of Fig. 1), it can be concluded that all the samples exhibit the pure anatase phase which is suitable for DSSCs.43 But the relative peak intensity is different, all the samples show an (001) orientation, which is caused by the selectively hindered growth because F− adsorbs onto the {001} facet and hinders its growth. The orientation index was obtained according to the following formula:44  where IO(hkl) is the orientation index of the (hkl), IS(hkl) is the diffraction peak intensity of (hkl) in the measured XRD pattern and IJ(hkl) is the diffraction peak intensity of (hkl) cited from the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards 84-1286 (JCPDS 84-1286). The orientation index of (001) and (101) was 5.636 and 0.614, respectively. It can be seen that the obtained TiO2 nanoparticles possess a high (001) orientation. To sum up, the obtained TiO2 nanoparticles are pure anatase phase and possess a high (001) orientation. The UV irradiation does not change the crystal phase of the TiO2 nanoparticles.

3.2. TEM images
In order to observe the morphology and nanostructure of the nanoparticles, TEM and HRTEM measurements were conducted, as shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the obtained TiO2 nanoparticles show morphology of nanosheets with about 35 nm square (001) facet and 5 nm thickness on average. The percentage of the {001} facet is about 75%, which is similar to the report of Kuang et al.12 It can be seen from Fig. 2b that the spacing between lattices is 0.235 nm, corresponding to the lattice spacing of (001) facets of anatase TiO2.12 According to Fig. 2c, the interfacial angle between (001) and (101) is about 68.3°, which is the same as reported.11
 Fig. 2  TEM images (a, c) and HRTEM image (b) of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The nanoparticles show morphology of nanosheets with about 35 nm square (001) facet and 5 nm thickness in [001] on average. The interfacial angle between (001) and (101) is about 68.3°. 
In summary, the XRD patterns and TEM images illustrate that the obtained anatase TiO2 nanosheets possess a high (001) orientation. The morphology was controlled by F− adsorbed onto {001} facets, which hinders its growth during the hydrothermal process.11 Meanwhile, the fluorated TiO2 surface was contaminated inevitably by the fluorine surfactant, which should be removed to obtain pure TiO2 with a clean surface.
3.3. X-Ray photoelectron spectra
To examine the effect of UV irradiation on the elimination of fluorine on the TiO2 surface, XPS experiment was carried out. The results are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the spectra are mainly composed of one peak at about 684.0 eV, which is ascribed to the main peak of F 1s. The F 1s signal is obvious to be seen in UV0 and its intensity attenuates when the irradiation time prolongs to 20 min. When the irradiation time prolongs to 80 min, the signal becomes so weak that it vanishes in the background noise. Thus, the amount of fluorine decreases as the irradiation time prolongs, which means UV irradiation can remove the fluorine contamination on the surface of TiO2.

3.4. Photoelectric performance
Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of six DSSCs (five for UV irradiation with different time and one for comparison sample P25) under AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination with an active area of 0.132 cm2 are presented in Fig. 4. The upper group of curves is measured under AM1.5, and the lower group of curves is measured in the dark. The parameters of the J–V curves are listed in Table 1, including open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) and the amount of adsorbed dye per unit surface area. It can be seen that the VOC (0.683 ± 0.013 V) and FF (75.7 ± 0.3%) are almost the same for the DSSCs irradiated for 0–80 min. While, JSC and η increase as the irradiation time prolongs when the time is shorter than 40 min. For almost the same thickness (12.5 ± 0.5 μm, see Fig. S5, ESI†), η is elevated by 17.6%, from 5.21% to 6.13%. The enhanced η is caused by the increased JSC, which is improved to 11.7 mA cm−2 from 10.30 mA cm−2, giving an improvement of 13.6%. The increased JSC is ascribed to the increased amount of the adsorbed dye per unit surface area, which is elevated by 24.4%, from 2.71 to 3.37 × 10−7 mol m−2. Because most of the TiO2 surface is not covered by dye molecules, the further increase of dye is reasonable. When the irradiation time prolongs to 80 min, all the parameters remain the same compared with UV40. These cells are also compared with the cell fabricated with the famous P25. The efficiency of UV0 is lower than P25 and higher than P25 after 10 min UV irradiation. In summary, the photoelectric efficiency increases as the irradiation time increases and saturates when the irradiation time reaches 40 min. The 17.6% increase of the efficiency is caused by the elevated amount of the adsorbed dye.

3.5. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis
In order to clarify the mechanism of the increased dye adsorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiment was carried out at 110 K under the full output irradiation of a 500 W xenon lamp, as is shown in Fig. 5. There are mainly five signals in the spectra, distributed at 3352, 3374, 3394, 3398 and 3448 Gauss. The broad signals at 3352 and 3374 Gauss (purple dashed lines) are assigned to the resonance line of the electrons trapped on the surface of anatase TiO2. The sharp signals at 3394 and 3398 Gauss (olive dashed lines) and the signal at 3448 Gauss (pink dashed line), corresponding g = 1.990 and 1.957, are ascribed to the perpendicular spin component and parallel component of the resonance lines of the electrons trapped in the lattice of anatase TiO2.45 It can be seen that the intensity of the line, corresponding to the electrons trapped on the surface, becomes stronger as the UV irradiation time increases. While the intensity of the line ascribed to the electrons trapped in the lattice attenuates with the increase of UV irradiation time.
 Fig. 5  EPR spectra of TiO2 without and with UV irradiation. The signals at 3353 and 3374 Gauss (purple dashed lines) become stronger and the signals at 3394 and 3398 Gauss (olive dashed lines) attenuate as the UV irradiation time increases. 
The detailed data of the EPR signal are listed in Table 2. The data for electrons trapped in the lattice decrease with the increase of UV irradiation time. At 40 min the intensity decreases from 7320 to 6699 Gauss. From 40 to 80 min, the intensity is almost unchanged at 6700 Gauss. The data for surface electrons increase with the increase of UV irradiation time. At 40 min the intensity increases from 3934 to 5245 Gauss but it is nearly unchanged when the time prolongs to 80 min, at about 5230 Gauss. To summarize, the signals attenuate for lattice electrons but enhance for surface electrons when the UV irradiation time is shorter than 40 min. However, they are almost the same when the UV irradiation time prolongs to 80 min, compared with the samples irradiated for 40 min. Thus, electrons trapped in the lattice decrease and electrons trapped on the surface increase as the irradiation time prolongs when it is shorter than 40 min. When the time is longer than 40 min, they are saturated.

3.6. Theoretical calculation
There is report that UV irradiation can induce oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface.46 Our previous work also reported that oxygen vacancies result in the increase of the signal ascribed to the electrons trapped on the surface.30 However, if the increased dye adsorption is induced by the increased oxygen vacancies, the signal ascribed to the electrons trapped in the lattice should not decrease. Moreover, the XPS data show that there are no obvious oxygen vacancies either before or after the UV irradiation treatment (see Fig. S2, ESI†). So, the increase of the signal ascribed to the electrons trapped on the surface should not originate from increased oxygen vacancies. To further reveal the deeper meaning of the EPR data and to investigate the change of the TiO2 surface, a theoretical calculation was conducted.
Using a dense k mesh, we first get the relaxed anatase TiO2 lattice constant: 3.78 Å and 9.51 Å for a and c, respectively, which agrees well with experiments.47 As shown in Fig. 6a, we considered a surface supercell containing 160 oxygen atoms and 80 titanium atoms, of dimension 2 × 5 in the [100] and [010] directions respectively, corresponding to an area of 7.57 × 18.52 Å2. In the [001] direction, eight TiO2 layers were used, in which the two lowest ones were fixed to bulk parameters during the relaxation. According to the report of Herman et al.,35 in order to build the reconstruction model, atoms between (103) and (03) in the top 3 layers were cut away to obtain a cave, resulting in 144 oxygen atoms and 72 titanium atoms (Fig. 6b). Fig. 6c is the supercell after relaxation. To avoid surface interaction, we use a vacuum of 20 Å on the top of the supercell, which is sufficient to get converged results. It can also be seen that the exposed titanium atoms on the reconstructed surface in Fig. 6c are 9, compared to 6 on the pure TiO2 surface in Fig. 6a. Because adsorbates anchor themselves to the titanium atoms, the increased exposure of titanium atoms increases the active surface area of TiO2.
 Fig. 6  Sketch of the supercell used for the calculation. (a) The pure anatase TiO2 surface. (b) The surface with 8 titanium atoms and 16 oxygen atoms caved. (c) The surface after relaxation. 
The calculated density of state (DOS) for the pure and reconstructed surface is shown in Fig. 7a. It can be seen that the essential features of the DOS for the two surfaces remain the same except for the conduction band bottom (CBM). A noticeable feature of the constructed surface (highlighted by the blue circle) reveals the existence of a localized state in the CBM, located about 1.5 eV above the Fermi level. Such a localized state can act as electron trap on the surface for TiO2. Although the reconstructed surface gives rise to the localized state, the band gap did not change. As can be seen in Fig. 7b, the valence band is dominated by O 2p states, and additional hybridization of Ti 3p and Ti 3d states is also evident. The conduction band is dominated by Ti 3d derived states, unlike the valence band O 2p, which means that the surface titanium atom is more active than the O atom, so the adsorbates (such as dye, pollutants and water molecules) prefer to interact with surface titanium atoms.36,48,49 In addition, the oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface, which also induce a prolongation to the band gap, can act as active sites for adsorbates.50,51 While the Ti 3d DOS of the reconstructed surface extended more to the band gap (highlighted by the blue circle), compared with the pure surface. In this sense, the reconstructed surface will attract more adsorbates, with the microfaceted steps as active sites for adsorption. To verify this effect, fluorated TiO2 and UV-irradiated TiO2 were utilized to degrade rhodamine B, the result is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The TiO2 irradiated for 80 min by UV light exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity, compared with the fluorated TiO2. Based on the degradation mechanism of rhodamine B, the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the finding that the clean and reconstructed surface obtained by UV-irradiation adsorbed more rhodamine B molecules.52
 Fig. 7  Density of state (DOS) of the pure and reconstructed surface (a) and partial density of state (PDOS) of the reconstructed surface (b). In (a), the black and the red lines denote the DOS of the pure surface and reconstructed surface. In (b), the red solid line and the blue, dark yellow, magenta dashed lines denote the density of overall, O 2p, Ti 3p and Ti 3d states on the pure surface. There is an obvious localized state on the reconstructed surface (highlighted by the blue circle in (a)). 
To associate with the EPR data, the signal designated to the electrons trapped on the surface enhances, which is caused by the increase of electrons trapped by the localized state at the conduction band bottom on the reconstructed surface. The attenuation of the signal for the electrons trapped in the TiO2 lattice can be ascribed to the process where oxygen vacancies relax to the surface during the reconstruction procedure. So, the theoretical calculation is in good accordance with EPR. Moreover, the decrease of the lattice oxygen vacancies will also benefit the electrons transportation in the film, which is a positive effect for DSSCs.53
To sum up, the UV irradiation can induce the reconstruction of the anatase (001) surface. More titanium atoms were exposed and microfaceted steps arose on the surface. The increased exposure of titanium atoms elevates the active surface area of TiO2. The microfaceted steps created during the reconstruction procedure can act as active sites for the adsorption of the adsorbates, which elevates the active surface area further. The reconstruction would have been observed by a scanning tunnel microscope, but we failed the experiment for equipment and technical reasons. However, the whole work we did would cast light on reconstruction for the specialized researchers who conduct experiments and theoretical calculations on TiO2 reconstruction.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, TiO2 nanosheets were synthesized with the aid of hydrofluoric acid. UV irradiation was utilized to remove the fluorine surfactant and to elevate active surface area for adsorbates on the TiO2 surface. Due to the removal of the surfactant and the reconstruction, which elevate the active surface area by increasing titanium atoms exposure and active sites, the UV irradiated TiO2 showed enhanced DSSCs performance. When the irradiation time was 40 min, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the DSSCs reached 6.13%, which was elevated by 17.6% compared with those without UV irradiation treatment. The enhanced efficiency was attributed to the increased amount of dye adsorbed on the increased titanium atoms exposed and active sites. From the theoretical calculation, the mechanism of the increased titanium atoms exposed and active sites is demonstrated as the two domain (1 × 4) reconstruction after UV irradiating the (1 × 1) (001) surface.
