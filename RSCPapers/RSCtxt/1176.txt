    , Accepted 29th January 2023First published on 27th February 2023AbstractThe lead-free metal halide perovskite materials are a potential candidate for optoelectronics and photovoltaic applications due to their promising and outstanding properties. Herein, we have tuned and improved the structural, electronic, and optical behaviour of the CsSnCl3 perovskite nanomaterial by incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for solar cell applications. The hot injection method has been used for the synthesis of CsSnCl3 and nanocomposites of CsSnCl3/rGO with varying rGO content (1%, 2%, 3%, 4% and 5%) and further material characterization has been done by using various characterization techniques for improvement of the quality and performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The lead-free halide-based inorganic CsSnX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite layer and rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite are synthesized by using a cost-effective hot injection method. The crystal structure of the as-prepared CsSnCl3 and rGO nanocomposites has been analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) confirms that both the CsSnCl3 and rGO nanocomposite have a direct bandgap of ∼3.24 eV and 3.19 eV, respectively. The photoluminescence (PL) confirmed that the rGO nanocomposite shows a high quenching phenomenon as compared to the pristine CsSnCl3 material, and such quenching is possibly due to the faster separation and transfer of charges of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In PL, a blue shift of 7 nm is observed by incorporating the rGO sheet with CsSnCl3 nanoparticles. Along with this, we have examined the surface morphology of the rGO, CsSnCl3, and rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite materials by field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), and it is observed that CsSnCl3 nanoparticles are a granular kind of structure and spread over the rGO sheet. A morphological study has been done for the CsSnCl3 and rGO nanocomposites by using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), and a study of the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern confirms that high crystallinity has been observed in pure CsSnCl3 compared to the rGO nanocomposites. In the present study, the incorporation of rGO in the lead-free halide-based perovskite absorber layer demonstrates highly promising properties to develop several photovoltaics and optical devices in the near future.
1. Introduction
Lead-free organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites show outstanding properties due to their promising optoelectronic properties and have found applications in photovoltaics, semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, and photodetectors (PDs).1,2 These metal halide perovskites adopt the ABX3 stoichiometry structure, where A is a monovalent organic species (CH3NH3+), or inorganic cation (usually Cs+, or Rb+), B is a divalent metal ion (usually Sn2+, Pb2+, Mn2+ or Ge2+) and X is a monovalent halogen (usually F−, Cl−, Br−, or, I−).3 These organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials behave as an outstanding absorber material for solar cell applications, have a tuneable bandgap, have an envelope from the visible to the near-IR range, and show a high value of absorption coefficient.4 Previous research shows the application of halide-based perovskites in electroluminescent (EL) diodes because of strong exciton-bound photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.5 Lead is a toxic material for the environment, so alternatives to this material must be found. Nowadays, researchers are working on lead (Pb) free materials, and we also have to make an effort to replace lead with tin (Sn) in PSCs.6 The inorganic perovskite CsSnBr3, CsSnI3, and CsSnCl3 materials are used as absorber materials in p-i-n type solar cell devices. The lead (Pb) free and cesium (Cs)-based perovskite CsSnX3 materials have been admired due to their superior thermal stability. Such perovskites have gained much attention due to their appealing optoelectronic properties and potential application in the field of infrared (IR) detectors, LEDs, lasers, and X-ray detectors. The literatures demonstrate that a mixture of tin-lead perovskite absorbers results in a tunable bandgap by varying the composition of Sn and Pb, which perfectly shows that Sn is a potential replacement of lead.7,8 In the literature, researchers have achieved an efficiency of 5.7% for CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx perovskite solar cells.9
The inorganic perovskites, e.g., cesium tin halide (CsSnX3, where X is Cl, Br, or I), show strong PL at room temperature and they are solution-processable at room temperature.10,11 There are limited studies that have been reported on optoelectronic properties based on tin perovskites. Certainly, the photocatalytic properties of CsSnCl3 are yet to be investigated.12 The fabrication of thermally stable CsSnCl3 nanocrystals with the desired morphology is quite challenging. Earlier research has shown that cubic nanocrystal fabrication of CsSnCl3 requires temperature-controlled mechanical milling and subsequent heat treatment for 12 hours.13 Phases I and II are also syntheses of CsSnCl3 perovskite although the synthesis technique demands high temperature to develop the high-quality perovskites.14 Additionally, nanocrystals of CsSnCl3 were synthesized from organic solvent-assistant treatment along with high energy absorbance post-synthesized annealing, which is not acceptable for time-saving and low-cost synthesis of halide perovskites.15,16 Accordingly, an easy and facile synthesis technique such as the hot injection technique is necessary to fabricate nanocrystals of CsSnCl3 with the required structure, surface morphology, and phase purity.17 Basically, this hot injection technique is widely used to synthesize lead-free CsSnBr3 and CsSnI3 nanocrystal perovskites.18,19
In the development of the lead-free halide-based perovskite devices, Shuangyi Zhao et al. reported the material synthesis of CsCu2Cl3 and Cs3Cu2Cl5 and their application in a highly stable white light emitting diode (WLED) for optoelectronic applications.20 Also, Baiqian Wang et al. developed a pressure-assisted cooling method to synthesize similar perovskites, which exhibit excellent stability for WLED and wireless visible light communication applications.21 Qionghua Mo et al. reported a newly developed air-stable hybrid lead-free halide like [Na (DMSO)2]3SbBr6, which exhibits high photoluminescence quantum yield and long-term PL decay of 3.1 μs, and such a material is useful for next-generation solid-state illuminations and optoelectronic applications.22 Furthermore, they improve the photoluminescence quantum yield and stability by incorporating Cl and varying the concentration of Sb in the same perovskites; thus, such work gives an insight into the development of Sb-based organic–inorganic metal halides for solid-state illumination and X-ray imaging.23
Now, to improve the optical, structural, and electrical properties, researchers used reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as an additive material. There is various research available using rGO and some of the research has been discussed here. In this literature, they have designed and fabricated a porous rGO with an N-doped nanoarray as a cofunction host for the Li anode and S cathode which are used in the Li–S battery.24 For the lead-based rGO nanocomposite, it was reported that after rGO incorporation in the pristine perovskite, a significant improvement was observed in absorption and photo-generated carrier transportation.25 This paper is regarding the fabrication of electrodes that are based on the papermaking technique with graphene oxide-modified fiber followed by rGO, which are used in a supercapacitor.26 This study confirms the defects in the graphene layer after the plasma irradiation strategy. These defects are monovalent and divalent.27 The low dimensional structures, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, are successfully acknowledged as suitable saturable absorbers for passive Q-switching mode.28 This paper considers an energy conversion from the pump laser field to the surface plasmon polaritons.29 The rGO-based nanocomposite is an effective way to load the semiconductor nanoparticles on the graphene sheet with no further aggregation and stacking of the graphene sheet. This will impact the optical and electrical properties. So, it is very interesting to study the combination of two excellent materials rGO and perovskite material for optoelectronic applications. The rGO nanocomposite enlarges the perovskite crystal size and affects the crystallinity.
In this study, we have explored the different properties of lead-free halide-based perovskites. Herein, to improve the properties of pristine CsSnCl3 perovskite, we used additive materials, like rGO, and studied the effect of this material on the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals, and made an attempt to improve the electronic, optical, and structural properties of the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposites. The crystal structure analysis study has been done by using XRD results. The morphological study has been done by using an HR-TEM to show the fringes and an SEM shows the high-resolution image of the nanocrystals. The optoelectronic properties are also studied and the bandgap of both of the materials was calculated (pristine CsSnCl3 and rGO nanocomposite); thus, the addition of rGO opens a new way to explore lead-free perovskites to improve the utility in optoelectronic applications.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Chemicals used during the synthesis
The required chemicals used during the synthesis were obtained from Sigma Aldrich company: caesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99%), tin chloride (SnCl2, 99%), 1-octadecane (ODE, ≥90%), oleic acid (OA, 90%), oleylamine (OAm, 90%), hexane (≥95%), and acetone (≥99.9%).
2.2 Preparation of Cs-oleate solution and synthesis of CsSnCl3 perovskite
In this paper, we have synthesized the perovskite material CsSnCl3 using the low-temperature hot injection technique.30Fig. 1 shows the pictorial representation of the synthesis steps of the Cs-oleate and CsSnCl3 perovskite material.31 Firstly, we start with the preparation of Cs-oleate (Cs-OL); 130.324 mg was added to a mixture of 15 mL of 1-octadecane (C18H38) and 1.25 mL of oleic acid (C18H34O2) in a 3-neck flask. After that, the mixture was vigorously stirred for 15 minutes at 1200 rpm and dried at 120 °C for 1 hour in a nitrogen (N2) environment. Subsequently, the resultant mixture was heated at 180 °C for 1 hour in a N2 environment, and finally, the precipitation of the desired Cs-oleate was collected. Before the use of this as-prepared Cs-oleate precipitate, it is necessary to heat it at 80 °C for 30 min.
 Fig. 1  Synthesis steps of the CsSnCl3 perovskite using the hot injection technique. 
Next, the synthesis of the CsSnCl3 perovskite material was performed as reported in the literature.12 16 mg of tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O), 10 mL of 1-octadecane, 1 mL of oleic acid, and 1 mL of oleylamine (C18H35NH2) are mixed together in a 3-neck flask and stirred by a magnetic stirrer at 1200 rpm for 1 hour at 120 °C under a N2 environment. After that, 2.25 mL of the Cs-oleate solution was transferred into a 10 mL beaker, and then the beaker was transferred into a furnace under an inert environment. After that, the solution was heated for 1 hour at 200 °C in a N2 environment. Next, the prepared chemical is cooled down by using an ice bath. Conclusively, the nanocrystals of CsSnCl3 were separated from the solution by using centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes and were washed multiple times with n-hexane. Before characterization, to obtain a powder, the sample was dried at 80 °C for 4 hours in a vacuum.
2.3 Synthesis of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
Graphite powder, hydrazine hydrate (N2H4), sulphuric acid (H2SO4), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by using the Modified Hummers’ method.32
We start with 500 mg of graphite flakes, 17 mL of H2SO4, and 380 mg of NaNO3, which were mixed together and stirred for 30 min at 900 rpm at room temperature. Then they were kept in an ice bath at 5 °C at 900 rpm for 2 hours. Thereafter, potassium permanganate (1 g) was added slowly to the mixture to oxidize the graphite flakes, and then the mixture is removed from the ice bath when the solution turns green. Then it was kept in a fume hood for 48 hours at 35 °C at 900 rpm. The piranha solution was prepared using 50 mL of DI water, 1.5 mL sulphuric acid, and 0.25 mL of hydrogen peroxide. Thereafter, both solutions were mixed, at 90 °C for 2 hours at 900 rpm. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged with DI water at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes multiple times, and the GO was collected.
After the successful synthesis of GO, to get the rGO, a mixture of 50 mg of GO powder is mixed with 100 mL of DI water.33 To make a dispersive solution, the solution needs to be stirred for 30 minutes. Next, we add 0.5 mL of hydrazine hydrate into the dispersive solution. After that, the mixture was heated to 120 °C for 24 hours at 900 rpm. After 24 hours, the solution was transferred into 6 different 100 mL centrifuge tubes to clean the prepared solution. The cleaning was done by using DI water and it was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes. This process is repeated at least 2–3 times and then kept in the oven at 80 °C for 4–8 hours to get a powder.
2.4 Synthesis of the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite perovskite
After the successful synthesis of the CsSnCl3 perovskite in liquid form and the rGO material, specific amounts of both materials are mixed together. After mixing both materials, the mixture is kept on a hot plate in silicon oil, and the temperature is set at 80 °C for 30 min at 900 rpm. After that, this mixture is placed in an ice cube jar for 5 min to form the nanocomposite rGO/CsSnCl3 crystal. After that, the solution is taken out and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min, and then washed with n-hexane multiple times. Then, the composite materials are kept in an oven at 80 °C for 4 hours.
2.5 Material characterization
The crystalline structure of the as-prepared CsSnCl3 perovskite sample was investigated by using a powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using a diffractometer (Smart lab, Rigaku Japan; XRD) with an X-ray tube with a Cu target, and an anode material wavelength (λ = 1.5418 Å) within a range between 10° and 80°. The XPS survey scan was used to analyze the chemical composition and identify the elements available on the surface of the sample using a Thermo Scientific NEXSA XPS with an Al-Kα X-ray source energy of 1486 eV (λ = 0.8343 nm). The angle between the surface of the sample and the analyzer was 90° with an analysis size of 400 nm in diameter, the source power is 72 W, the survey scan pass energy was 200 eV, and the pass energy for high resolution is 50 eV. The electron gun was used to perform charge compensation. Furthermore, to nullify the effect of peak shift due to charge accumulation in the non-conducting sample, the adventitious carbon line in the C 1s spectra at 284.8 eV was used. The absorbance spectra of the CsSnCl3 and rGO/CsSnCl3 material were examined using a UV-visible spectrometer (Cary 500 scan, Varian) in the 200–800 nm range. The optical properties of the samples were determined at room temperature using a photoluminescence (PL) measurement system (Fluorolog – 3, Horiba, Jobin Yvon) fluorescence spectrometer with a light source of a 450 W Xenon lamp having an excitation source wavelength of 300 nm. The surface morphology was determined by FEG-SEM (model: JSM-7600F) with a magnification of 25× to 1000k× at 4 × 5 photo size.
3. Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the rGO, the perovskite material (CsSnCl3), and the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 2(a). The diffraction peaks are found at 24.42° and 42.89° angles, which correspond to the (002) and (100) planes, respectively. Such peaks confirm the presence of rGO material. The displayed peaks for CsSnCl3 are found at 21.43°, 30.56°, and 54.42° with the indexing of these planes corresponding to (110), (200), and (220) (JCPDS card file no. 01-071-2023). The structure of the nanocrystal is found to be monoclinic with space group P21/n (14) for the CsSnCl3 perovskite, as shown in Fig. 2(a). After analysis of the powder method, the lattice parameters of the as-synthesis CsSnCl3 perovskite are a = 16.1000 Å, b = 7.4250 Å, c = 5.7480 Å, and α = 90°, β = 93.20°, γ = 90°, unit cell volume is 686.059 Å3 and z = 4 at room temperature.13 Further examination of the dominant (200) peak in the XRD results is shown in Fig. 2(b), where it is observed that the peak is shifted towards a lower angle for the 1% rGO nanocomposite and it shifts gradually towards a higher angle for the other samples as compared to the 1% rGO nanocomposite. The shift is observed to be ∼0.44° for 1% rGO as compared to CsSnCl3 and the reason behind this shift is an expansion of the lattice parameter after rGO incorporation, and for other % of rGO the peak shifts towards a higher angle because of lattice contraction after a further increase in rGO compositions.34 The phenomenon of the decrease in lattice constant after rGO incorporation is mainly because of the generation of compressive micro-strains, which affects the size of the lattice.35,36 Furthermore, if the rGO content increases, the hardness of the rGO nanocomposite increases, which affects the lattice parameters.37

The other parameters like FWHM, the crystallite size (D), and lattice parameters (a) are calculated from the dominant (200) peak and the plots are shown in Fig. 3. We can observe that the 3% rGO composite has a low FWHM and higher crystallite size, which is attributed to the high crystalline quality of the nanocomposites as compared with other rGO percentages.

FTIR was performed to find the composition, bonding analysis, and different functional groups present in the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite. The FTIR measurement was performed in the Attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode as shown in Fig. 4. The absorbance band is nearly at 1223 cm−1 due to stretching vibrations of CO (alkoxy).38 The new intense C–OH band at 1364 cm−1 indicates that GO material has been formed from the graphite oxidation.39 The absorbance band at 1733 cm−1 is because of the GO characteristic peak due to CO stretching vibration.40Fig. 4 shows that the intensity is increased for the absorption peaks located at 1223 cm−1, 1364 cm−1, and 1733 cm−1 after the incorporation of rGO, which originated due to oxygen-containing functional groups. Such peaks are reduced by increasing the wt% of rGO significantly.41 The absorber peak is observed at 1472 cm−1 due to the CH2 bending. The vibration bands at 2853 cm−1 (oleylamine) and 2918 cm−1 (oleic acid) are observed due to C–H stretching vibration at the methylene group of the precursors.42

XPS was used to analyses the chemical composition of the as-prepared perovskite material CsSnCl3 and their nanocomposite with rGO and the full survey XPS spectrum is obtained in Fig. 5(a). In the survey spectrum, the main peaks for Cs, Sn, and Cl were easily identified and confirmed the successful formation of the nanocrystals of the CsSnCl3 and nanocomposite with the desired chemical state. Strikingly, two more peaks correspond to the C 1s and O 1s orbitals in the nanocomposite with rGO. These peaks originated due to the molecular absorption of oxygen and carbon atoms on the surface of the as-prepared CsSnCl3 nanocrystal during the disclosure to the atmosphere. Such elements are found with a higher concentration in the rGO nanocomposites.43

Furthermore, the high-resolution XPS spectra of O 1s, C 1s, Cs 3d, Sn 3d, and Cl 2p are shown in Fig. 5(b–f), respectively. Two distinct main peaks were observed at the binding energy of 531.86 eV and 529.71 eV in the O 1s XPS spectrum.44 Three distinct peaks were observed at the binding energy of 283.41 eV, 284.27 eV, and 285.07 eV in the C 1s XPS spectrum.45 The core spectrum of Cs was distributed in two peaks at 724.39 eV and 738.34 eV that correspond to the Cs 3d5/2 and Cs 3d3/2 states, respectively, and it was observed that there is a peak shift corresponding to higher binding energy after incorporation of rGO, which is attributed to Cs–C complex oxide formation.46 Two distinguished peaks were observed at 486.58 eV and 494.96 eV that correspond to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively; we can observe that there is a peak shift toward higher binding energy, which results in a high probability of oxidation after the incorporation of rGO.47 The Cl 2p core spectrum of CsSnCl3 exhibits an asymmetric peak deconvoluted into two symmetric Gaussian peaks at the binding energy of 197.77 eV and 199.40 eV, which is analogous to Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2 in the as-prepared CsSnCl3 nanocrystals.48
The optical properties of CsSnCl3 and the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite were studied in the spectral range of 200 to 800 nm by conducting UV-visible absorption spectroscopy.
CsSnCl3 spectra show a higher absorption edge in the visible region as compared to the UV region. The redshifted absorption edge in the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite is due to the restoration of the π–π transition of the aromatic C–C bonds of the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite. For the calculation of the bandgap, Tauc's method is used as follows:49 (1)Here αν, h and Eg are the absorption coefficient, incident photon energy, and bandgap, respectively.n = ½ for the direct bandgapn = 2 for the indirect bandgapFrom the results, we can see that the energy bandgap of the CsSnCl3 nanoparticles is observed to be 3.24 eV, whereas it is 3.19 eV for the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite, as shown in Fig. 6. In addition, with the presence of rGO, the absorption is increased in the range of 400–800 nm, making it a potential material in solar cells.
 Fig. 6  The absorbance profile of CsSnCl3 and the nanocomposite with rGO and the inset shows the corresponding Tauc plot. 
The optical properties of the perovskite and nanocomposites were calculated by performing the PL study. In a comparison of the pure CsSnCl3 nanoparticles, the PL spectrum of the rGO nanocomposites is weak, which is due to the effective separation and transfer of the photo-excited charge carriers from the rGO nanocomposite.50 And the peak of the rGO nanocomposite showed a slight blueshift for 7 nm compared to the pure CsSnCl3 nanoparticles, which may have originated from the interaction between the CsSnCl3 nanoparticles and rGO sheets, and this is attributed to the Burstein Moss Effect, and the shift shown in Fig. 7.51

TCSPS is a statistical method that requires a repetitive light source to accumulate a required number of photon events for a required statistical data precision. This study is required to understand the charge carriers’ exciton behaviour and to show the stability of the perovskite material on the basis of the carrier's lifetime calculations. The fluorescence decay of the pure CsSnCl3 material and rGO nanocomposite is shown in the ESI† in Fig. S1(a anf b). The excitation source used a 440 nm Mai-Tai pulsed laser at room temperature.
The Fluorescence decay in the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite was significantly slower as compared to the pure CsSnCl3 material and the rGO nanocomposite has a longer lifetime and this shows that it is more stable as compared to pure CsSnCl3 material as we move from the 1st week to 5th week, as shown in the ESI† in Fig. S1(c). We have calculated more than one lifetime when the electron and holes are located in the different energetic structures.52 The decay is fitted by the double exponential model and the fitted data are shown in the ESI† in Table S1. Mostly, the fluorescence lifetime of the charge-transfer exciton is observed by the electron–hole recombination rates, which are controlled by the Coulomb attraction force.52,53
SEM was performed to examine the surface morphology of these nanocrystals of CsSnCl3, rGO, and the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite material. As observed in Fig. 8, the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals are in a spherical form and rGO shows sheets with wrinkles. The rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite shows that CsSnCl3 nanoparticles are formed in a granular kind of structure on the rGO sheet and some particles are aggregated, and some are entangled in the rGO sheet.

3.1 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), elemental mapping, and EDX
The morphological information of the CsSnCl3 and rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposites were investigated by using TEM, as shown in Fig. 9(a and d), respectively. Sphere-like CsSnCl3 nanoparticles are found in the agglomerated form. The rGO sheet is flat and transparent with some wrinkles on the surface, and CsSnCl3 nanoparticles are embedded in the rGO sheet.53 Furthermore, the HRTEM images in Fig. 9(b and e) show the crystal lattice fringes, and the d-spacings between two fringes are estimated to be 3.52 Å, 3.35 Å, and 2.07 Å, corresponding to the planes of (11), (220), and (331), respectively, for pure CsSnCl3. For the rGO nanocomposite, the d-spacings between two fringes are found to be 3.78 Å, 3.59 Å, 2.67 Å, and 3.74 Å, and the corresponding planes are (301), (120), (600), and (020), respectively. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of pure CsSnCl3 shows high crystallinity, as shown in Fig. 9(c), as compared to the rGO nanocomposite. Along with this, the corresponding planes are analyzed from the SAED pattern. In Fig. 9(f), the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite shows a well-defined diffraction pattern, which confirms the crystallinity of the nanocomposite after conjugation.53 The elemental analysis of CsSnCl3, rGO, and the rGO/CsSnCl3 nanocomposite was carried out by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) as shown in the ESI† in Fig. S2. The rGO nanocomposite confirms the presence of the Cs, Sn, Cl, C, and O elements, which represents the formation of the nanocomposite.

4. Conclusion
In this article, we have presented an Sn-based (lead-free) halide perovskite nanocomposite for the investigation of the structural, optical, morphological, and photophysical behavior after the addition of rGO. After the incorporation of rGO, a blueshift phenomenon of 7 nm was observed, which may be due to the interaction between the CsSnCl3 nanoparticles and rGO sheets. We can prove the successful synthesis of the CsSnCl3 nanoparticles and rGO nanocomposites from the XPS results. We have noticed that after the incorporation of rGO, the crystallinity of the rGO nanocomposite is reduced, and these results can be verified from the TEM image. Afterward, FEG-SEM justifies that CsSnCl3 granular kinds of structure particles are stuck into the rGO sheet. In summary, this lead-free halide-based experimental study represents the effect of rGO on optical properties. Furthermore, we confirm that the synthesis strategy of CsSnCl3 nanoparticles is very facile. This perovskite material is fascinating because of its nature and applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.
