, Accepted 26th February 2014First published on 26th February 2014AbstractA semi-transparent silicon-rich (Si-rich) silicon carbide (SixC1−x) based thin-film p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell is demonstrated, which is synthesized by hydrogen-free plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) with the conversion efficiency optimized by detuning plasma power and intrinsic layer thickness. The hydrogen-free PECVD process effectively decelerates the decomposition of hydrogen from the Si-rich SixC1−x films so as to facilitate the passivation of surface dangling bonds. When synthesizing at a fluence ratio of R = [CH4]/[SiH4]+[CH4] = 60%, the optical bandgap of Si-rich SixC1−x film is greatly red-shifted to 1.54 eV due to the enhancement of Si content. By reducing the RF plasma power to 20 W, the Si-rich SixC1−x enlarges its above-bandgap (λ= 0.4–0.8 μm) optical absorption up to 104–105 cm−1, which is even one order of magnitude larger than that of bulk crystalline Si. The incomplete dissociation of CH4 and SiH4 under low-power PECVD growth also helps to suppress the defects and improve the electrical properties of Si-rich SixC1−x. By doping with the PH3 and B2H6 fluence ratios of 5.8% and 2.1%, the resistivities of n-type and p-type Si-rich SixC1−x films are decreased to 0.87 and 0.12 Ω cm, respectively. Thinning the intrinsic Si-rich SixC1−x layer to 25 nm further promotes the conversion efficiency of the Si-rich SixC1−x based p–i–n photovoltaic solar cell. After annealing at 650 °C, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of the annealed Si-rich SixC1−x and amorphous Si based dual-junction thin-film photovoltaic solar cell are increased to 0.78 V and 19.1 mA cm−2, respectively, leading to a filling factor of 35% and a conversion efficiency of up to 5.24%.
1. Introduction
Semi-transparent silicon carbide (SixC1−x) material is known as a good window layer to reduce the reflection of a-Si:H based solar cell devices because of its wide bandgap.1–3 However, few reports have emphasized using the non-stoichiometric SixC1−x materials as an active layer of photovoltaic devices because the stoichiometric SiC exhibits relatively low absorption coefficient, extremely low carrier concentration and mobility, and high resistivity even after doping.4,5 Recently, Gao et al. reported that the a-Si1−xCx:H based n–i–p junction photovoltaic solar cell can be used as a semi-transparent solar cell in an optical transmittance modulator. However, such a device could only provide a conversion efficiency of less than 1%.6 Yunaz's group studied the use of hydrogenated intrinsic amorphous SixC1−x (i-a-SixC1−x:H) as a top cell in a triple junction photovoltaic solar cell.7 Such a kind of third-generation thin-film photovoltaic solar cell with full-band absorption spectrum usually requires absorbing layers of variable optical bandgap.8,9
This demand urges the research interest on developing the graded-index SixC1−x based multilayer tandem photovoltaic solar cells to approach the conversion efficiency higher than ever.
In our previous work, the non-stoichiometric SixC1−x materials have been successfully synthesized by changing the synthesizing parameters of the hydrogen-free plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process at low substrate temperature.10–13 The PECVD recipe for growing the non-stoichiometric Si-rich SixC1−x is somewhat similar with those for synthesizing silicon-rich (Si-rich) SiOx and SiNx materials.14–16 The variable optical bandgap of the non-stoichiometric Si-rich SixC1−x films is strongly dependent on the Si/C compositional ratio. Under the PECVD synthesis with dense hydrogen fluence, the hydrogen passivation can improve the crystallinity of SixC1−x film.17 However, the absorption coefficient of SixC1−x also suffers from slight degradation by such a hydrogen passivation effect. With the hydrogen-free PECVD system, the hydrogenated SixC1−x can be formed at a lower RF plasma condition due to the nonlinear dissociation of silane (SiH4) and methane (CH4) gaseous mixture. Concurrently, the absorption coefficient of the SixC1−x significantly enlarges to be comparable or even larger than that of the single crystalline SiC film.14 The Si-rich SixC1−x film exhibits a red-shifted optical bandgap accompanied with a broadened absorption spectrum at wavelengths between 400 and 600 nm when comparing with the crystalline Si (c-Si) material.18
In this study, the semi-transparent non-stoichiometric Si-rich SixC1−x based single and tandem p–i–n junction thin-film photovoltaic solar cells are demonstrated by using a completely hydrogen-free PECVD recipe at relatively low plasma power condition. This is the first demonstration of combining the non-hydrogenated SixC1−x with the amorphous Si (a-Si) to form a novel thin-film tandem photovoltaic solar cell. The intrinsic Si-rich SixC1−x film is employed as an absorbing layer to enhance the responsivity of photocurrent conversion. The Si-rich SixC1−x film with variable optical bandgap can be synthesized in the hydrogen-free PECVD by detuning the RF plasma power. In order to reduce the series resistance of photovoltaic solar cells, the resistivities of p-type and n-type SixC1−x films are optimized by tuning the doping concentration with changing the doping fluence ratios of Ar-diluted PH3 and B2H6 in the recipes. After thinning the thickness of the i-SixC1−x based absorbing layer, both the Si-rich SixC1−x based single p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell and dual-junction Si-rich SixC1−x/a-Si:H tandem photovoltaic solar cell with optimized conversion ratio are demonstrated.
2. Experimental
2.1. The synthesis of Si-rich SixC1−x film
Semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x films were deposited on a quartz substrate by using a hydrogen-free PECVD system with gaseous mixture of Ar-diluted SiH4 and CH4.19 The recipe of reactant gas fluence defined as (R = [CH4]/[SiH4]+[CH4]) was fixed at 60%. The base chamber pressure and the substrate temperature were set as 0.08 torr and 550 °C, respectively. The RF plasma power was controlled between 20 and 100 W at 40 W increment (with a maximal power density up to 560 mW cm−2) to detune the Si/C compositional ratio and the optical bandgap of semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x films. Later on, the n-type and p-type Si-rich SixC1−x films were synthesized by doping the additional PH3 and B2H6, respectively. The lowest resistivities of SixC1−x:P and SixC1−x:B films were optimized by finely adjusting the doping fluence ratios from 2 to 5.8% and from 1.3 to 2.1%, respectively. Afterwards, the post-annealing treatment in PECVD chamber at 650 °C for 30 min was employed to activate the dopants. The electrical properties of semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x films were measured by the four-probe and Hall measurements (Ecopia, HMS-3000). The semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x films with different Si/C compositional ratios were identified by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an Mg Kα-line radiation source at 1253.6 eV. The cross-sectional view image taken by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700) was used to measure the thickness of SixC1−x and a-Si films.
The schematic diagrams of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x based single p–i–n junction and dual-junction Si-rich SixC1−x/a-Si:H tandem photovoltaic solar cells are shown in Fig. 1. A solar light simulator source illuminates from the surface of p-type Si-rich SixC1−x film. The device structure of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x based p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell is defined as ITO/p-SixC1−x/i-SixC1−x/n-SixC1−x/Al. The thicknesses of p-type and n-type SixC1−x films remain as 25 nm. Whereas, the thicknesses of i-SixC1−x absorbing layer were detuned from 150 nm to 25 nm by changing the deposition time to find the optimization between the width of depletion region and the resistivity of Si-rich SixC1−x based photovoltaic solar cells. The bottom a-Si:H based photovoltaic solar cells were fabricated by using another ICP-PECVD system. The substrate temperature and chamber pressure were controlled at 140 °C and 0.7 torr, respectively. The RF plasma power density was also fixed at 135 mW cm−2. The recipe of reactant gas fluence defined as (Ra-Si = [SiH4]/[H4]+[SiH4]) was set at 9%. The fluence ratios of PH3 and B2H6 in the ([SiH4]+[H4]) gaseous mixture host were 5% and 13%, respectively. The thicknesses of p-type and n-type a-Si film were fixed at 12 nm and 20 nm, respectively. The thickness of the i-a-Si film was kept at 400 nm. This work is focused on the effect of the SixC1−x based single p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cells on the dual-junction SixC1−x/a-Si:H tandem photovoltaic solar cell, all parameters of the a-Si:H based p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cells were fixed and the conversion efficiency of a-Si:H based photovoltaic solar cells were not optimized. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the a-Si:H based p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell were 0.43 V and 14 mA cm−2, respectively, providing the conversion efficiency of 3.97% with the filling factor of 0.66. The current–voltage (I–V) response and conversion efficiency under an illumination with AM1.5G solar simulator were measured by a multimeter (Keithley 2420) and analyzed by homemade software.

2.2. The band diagram of Si-rich SixC1−x thin film photovoltaic solar cell
The optical transmittance and reflectance spectra of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x films ranging between 300 and 1200 nm were measured by using a Xeon light source (Oriel, 68147 + 68830) and a monochromator (CVI, DK240). Furthermore, the optical bandgap was obtained by fitting the absorption coefficient with the Tauc's equation.20 The band diagrams of the SixC1−x based single p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell and dual-junction SixC1−x/a-Si:H tandem photovoltaic solar cell are shown in Fig. 2. The optical bandgaps of p-type, intrinsic, and n-type SixC1−x are 1.84, 1.49, and 2.05 eV, respectively. The work functions of anode (Al) and cathode (ITO) are 4.1 and 4.7 eV, respectively.21,22

3. Results and discussion
3.1. The XPS spectral analyses the Si-rich SixC1−x film
The compositional bond intensity of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x films grown at different RF plasma powers of 20 W (Fig. 3(a)), 60 W (Fig. 3(b)) and 100 W (Fig. 3(c)) were characterized by the deconvolution of the C1s orbital electron related XPS spectra as shown in Fig. 3. When decreasing RF plasma power from 100 W to 20 W, the Si/C compositional ratio increases from 1.94 to 1.86 due to the lower dissociation rate of CH4 decomposed under lower RF plasma powers.23 Two main peaks of the C1s orbital electron related XPS spectra are attributed to the Si–C bonds (238.2 eV) and C–C graphitic (sp2) bonds (284.6 eV).24 The intensities of the C–C and Si–C bonds are suppressed from 280 to 120 counts and from 1600 to 960 counts, respectively, when the RF plasma power reduces from 100 to 20 W. Nevertheless, the Si–C/C–C bond intensity ratio can be enhanced from 5.7 to 8 by decreasing the RF plasma powers, which indicates a better SiC phase formed at lower RF plasma environment. In particular, the result of the semi-transparent SixC1−x film at the lower RF plasma power of 20 W with hydrogen-free deposition environment when comparing with the deposition under hydrogen diluted reactant gas recipe is similar. The SixC1−x film grown under the hydrogen-rich environment would favor the phase transformation from C–H to Si–H mode25 and thus suppress the Si–C formation due to the enhanced Si–Si in the SixC1−x film. Therefore, it is a compromised recipe by replacing the hydrogen diluted gas with the low RF plasma condition, and the dissociation process between the gaseous mixture of CH4 and SiH4 is incomplete during the deposition. Such a mechanism facilitates to reduce the dangling bonds in Si-rich SixC1−x films, which can rule out the need of hydrogen in the PECVD process. In addition, the lower RF plasma power also reduces the dissociation rate of CH4 to further decrease the optical bandgap of semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x film.26

3.2. The Raman and XRD characteristics of Si-rich SixC1−x film
Fig. 4 reveals that the Si–Si bond related Raman signal at 520 cm−1 has a decreasing trend with increasing RF plasma powers because the higher RF plasma power provides higher energy to enhance the dissociation of the CH4 molecules. The enlarged content of decomposed C atoms makes the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x gradually transform to a standard SiC. In contrast, the Raman peaks at 795 and 970 cm−1 related to the transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) modes of the Si–C bonds conversely enhance by enlarging RF plasma power up to 100 W. Moreover, the C–C graphitic bond related Raman signal at 1350 cm−1 appears when synthesizing the Si-rich SixC1−x film at higher RF plasma powers, corroborating the existence of the graphite clusters embedded in the Si-rich SixC1−x films grown at larger RF plasma powers.

Fig. 5 shows the XRD spectra of the semi-transparent Si-rich Si-SixC1−x films grown at different RF plasma powers. The (111)-oriented Si related XRD signal appears at 28.5°, which indicates the Si–Si bonds in Si-rich SixC1−x films. In addition, the (111)-oriented 3C-SiC related XRD peaks at 35.6° gradually enhances when the Si-rich SixC1−x film is grown with increasing RF plasma power from 20 W to 100 W. High RF plasma power enables the complete decomposition of CH4 molecules to increase the Si–C bonds in the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x film.

3.3. The bandgap and absorption characteristics of Si-rich SixC1−x film
Fig. 6 depicts the absorption coefficient spectra of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x films synthesized with the RF plasma power varying from 100 W to 20 W. The optical bandgap of semi-transparent SixC1−x films strongly depends on the Si–C content in Si-rich SixC1−x films. According to the XPS result, the Si–C bonds in the Si-rich SixC1−x film by decreasing the RF plasma power to 20 W are reduced due to the suppressed dissociation rate of CH4. This causes the optical bandgap of SixC1−x red-shifted from 2.4 to 1.4 eV. The broadband absorption spectra with the highest absorption coefficient can be obtained up to 1.3 × 105 cm−1 by synthesizing the Si-rich SixC1−x at the RF plasma power of 20 W. The higher absorption coefficient of semi-transparent SixC1−x can also be attributed to the hydrogenated SixC1−x obtained by the higher Si/C compositional ratio during the growth of the low RF plasma power under a hydrogen-free environment.14
 Fig. 6  The optical absorption coefficient spectra of c-Si film and Si-rich SixC1−x absorber layers synthesized at different RF plasma powers. 
The lower RF plasma power only leads to the more silicon content incorporated in Si-rich SixC1−x film such that the optical bandgap shrinks to induce a red-shifted band edge. When the RF plasma power reduces from 100 W to 20 W, the fraction index x of Si-rich SixC1−x film slightly enlarges from 0.63 to 0.66. The extended absorbance of semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x film is increased by decreasing RF plasma powers due to the higher amorphous Si (a-Si) content in Si-rich SixC1−x. The a-Si content in Si-rich SixC1−x film could improve the absorbance of Si-rich SixC1−x film to approach that of the a-Si at 400–700 nm.18 As evidence, the absorption band edge of the Si-rich SixC1−x grown at RF plasma power of 20 W reveals high coincidence with that of the a-Si. In particular, there is an extended absorbance below bandgap of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x film at the band edge, which shows a decreased phenomenon to indicate the contribution of the mixed a-Si and SixC1−x matrices. In latter experiments, the semi-transparent SixC1−x film with the highest absorption coefficient has been used as the intrinsic absorber layer in the SixC1−x based p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell.
3.4. Optimizing the resistivity of n-type and p-type Si-rich SixC1−x films by detuning the PH3 and B2H6 doping fluence ratio in reactant gas recipe
The n-type and p-type Si-rich SixC1−x films are optimized by varying the doping (defined as [B2H6]/[SiH4+CH4] and [PH3]/[SiH4+CH4], respectively). Moreover, the thicknesses of n-type and p-type Si-rich SixC1−x films are subsequently optimized. In Fig. 7(a) and (b), the resistivity of n-type SixC1−x films reveals nearly parabolic-curve like response with variable doping with the PH3 fluence ratio ranging from 2% to 9%. The resistivity of the n-SixC1−x layer reduces from 30 to 13 Ω cm by increasing the PH3 fluence ratio from 2.5% to 5.8%. After the annealing temperature at 650 °C, the resistivity of n-type SixC1−x films is decreased from 11.6 to 8.5 Ω cm. When decreasing the n-SixC1−x thickness from 150 to 25 nm, the minimal resistivity of 0.875 Ω cm for n-SixC1−x film is obtained with the optimized thickness of 25 nm.
 Fig. 7  The resistivity of as-grown and annealed n-type SixC1−x:P films versus (a) doping fluence ratio and (b) thickness. 
In Fig. 8(a), the resistivity of p-type SixC1−x films is grown by varying the doping with the B2H6 fluence ratio varying from 1.3% to 2.1%. After annealing, the resistivity of p-type SixC1−x films can decrease from 1.14 to 0.29 Ω cm. When the p-type SixC1−x thickness shrinks from 150 to 25 nm, the resistivity of the p-type Si-rich SixC1−x film with an optimized thickness of 25 nm minimizes to 0.12 Ω cm in Fig. 8(b). Note that the higher dopant fluence ratio would conversely degrade the electrical properties of n-type and p-type Si-rich SixC1−x films again. The over-doped impurity atoms in SixC1−x films inevitably cause the carrier scattering or trapping effect after activation.27,28 A phenomenon is similar with the effect of enlarged thickness on the resistivity of the Si-rich SixC1−x film. On the other hand, the thicker thickness also induces more defects originating from the numerous dangling bonds in Si-rich SixC1−x films.29 When the thickness decreases to 15 nm, the resistivities of p-type and n-type SixC1−x films slightly increase because of the lower dopant content in Si-rich SixC1−x film further decreasing the thickness.

3.5. The performance of single Si-rich SixC1−x based thin-film photovoltaic solar cell
The TEM analysis is added to show the detailed structure of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x p–i–n junction, as shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b). Fig. 9(a) reveals a zoom-in image of the p–i–n junction, whereas Fig. 9(b) only shows the zoom-in image of the semi-transparent single i-Si-rich SixC1−x layer. From TEM images, it is observed that the roughness of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x p–i–n junction structure depends on the roughness of the substrate surface. In principle, such a roughened structure could eventually contribute to a reduced shunt resistance of the Si-rich SixC1−x based photovoltaic solar cell, which further degrades the conversion efficiency as well. Nevertheless, such a surface roughened Si-rich SixC1−x based p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell could also lead to an anti-reflective effect to facilitate the optical absorbance. In previous works, similar textured structures have been extensively applied to all kinds of photovoltaic solar cells for enhancing their conversion efficiency. As a result, there might be a compromised set between the degraded shunt resistance and the improved surface anti-reflection.
 Fig. 9  (a) The TEM images of the Si-rich SixC1−x film with the p–i–n structure. (b) The TEM images of the intrinsic Si-rich SixC1−x film. 
After optimizing the electrical properties of n-type and p-type Si-rich SixC1−x films, the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x based single p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell with a device structure of ITO/p-SixC1−x/i-SixC1−x/n-SixC1−x/Al is characterized under the illumination of an AM-1.5G solar simulator with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The Al bottom anode and the ITO top cathode are used to approach the ohmic contacts. By improving the doping concentration in n- and p-SixC1−x, the depletion width in the n- and p-type regimes can be greatly shortened to prevent photocurrent generation from depletion region. The addition of the semi-transparent i-SixC1−x layer effectively broadens the absorption region to increase the conversion efficiency.30 However, the thicker i-SixC1−x layer may increase the series resistance of photovoltaic solar cell due to the high resistivity of i-SixC1−x film. Therefore, the thickness of i-SixC1−x absorbing layer is gradually reduced from 150 to 25 nm to concurrently optimize the series resistance and conversion efficiency of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x based single p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell.
Under AM-1.5G illumination, the I–V curves of as-grown and annealed Si-rich SixC1−x based single p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cells are shown in Fig. 10 and 11. When decreasing the semi-transparent i-SixC1−x layer from 100 nm to 25 nm, the Voc and the Jsc of the as-grown Si-rich SiC based photovoltaic solar cell is increased from 0.34 to 0.45 V and from 9.06 to 12.96 mA cm−2, respectively. With the filling factor around 0.23, the conversion efficiency is observed to enhance from 0.75% to 1.36%. After annealing at 650 °C, the Voc and the Jsc of the annealed Si-rich SixC1−x based photovoltaic solar cell with suppressing the i-SixC1−x layer from 150 nm to 25 nm is also enlarged from 0.31 to 0.47 V and from 11.5 to 14.1 mA cm−2, respectively. The conversion efficiency is observed to enhance from 0.89% to 1.7% with the filling factor around 0.25%. The thinner i-SixC1−x layer exhibits a lower series resistance and fewer defects, which facilitates the requirement of low series resistance and high shunt resistance for photovoltaic solar cells. In contrast, the enlarged i-SixC1−x thickness inevitably degrades the Jsc and Voc simultaneously, which indicates that the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x based p–i–n junction gradually approaches a resistor instead of a photovoltaic solar cell.

Furthermore, the dual-junction Si-rich SixC1−x/a-Si:H tandem photovoltaic solar cells are demonstrated for obtaining higher power conversion efficiency. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 12, the AM-1.5G illuminated I–V responses show that the conversion efficiency of the semi-transparent dual-junction Si-rich SixC1−x/a-SiC tandem photovoltaic solar cells significantly enhances by detuning the i-SixC1−x absorbing layer of the upper Si-rich SixC1−x based p–i–n junction thin-film photovoltaic solar cell. When reducing the i-SixC1−x thickness from 150 to 25 nm, the conversion efficiency of the semi-transparent dual-junction SixC1−x/a-SiC tandem photovoltaic solar cell improves its Voc and Jsc up to 0.78 V and 19.1 mA cm−2, respectively. This results in an optimized conversion efficiency of 5.24% with a filling factor of 0.35. By decreasing the i-SixC1−x layer, the I–V curves of the semi-transparent dual-junction Si-rich SixC1−x/a-SiC tandem photovoltaic solar cells apparently show the lower series resistance and higher shunt resistance at the forward and the reverse bias regimes. These results indicate that the thicker i-SiC layer becomes detrimental to the photovoltaic solar cell response even with the higher photocurrent productivity.

Consequently, the highest conversion efficiency of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x based single p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell and the dual-junction Si-rich SixC1−x/a-Si:H tandem photovoltaic solar cell are performed with the optimized i-SixC1−x thickness of 25 nm. This optimization is mainly attributed to the reduction on both the series resistance and the structural defect density in SixC1−x film. To approach a higher conversion efficiency of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x based photovoltaic solar cell, it is mandatory to deal with the parameters which limit the photocurrent, such as the optimization of the depletion width or resistance controlled by the i-SixC1−x and the n-type and p-type SixC1−x thickness. Moreover, the optical bandgap of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x could be changed by detuning the Si/C compositional ratio to migrate the interfacial barrier.31,32 Fortunately, these parameters can all be finely detuned by precisely controlling the fluence ratio during hydrogen-free PECVD synthesis, which decreases the bandgap, broadens the absorption region, and detunes the interfacial barrier at once with reducing R factor. More importantly, the hydrogen-free PECVD synthesis could also obtain the defect-reduced Si-rich SixC1−x films with the residual hydrogen atoms absorbed from the incompletely decomposed SiHx and CHx radicals. Opposite to the previous observation that the hydrogen-free synthesis inevitably enriches the surface dangling bonds and related defects to degrade the conversion efficiency of the semi-transparent SixC1−x based p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell, the accurate control of growth recipe under hydrogen-free environment can also benefit higher absorbance. The surface passivation of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x is also improved by a large amount of the SiHx and CHx radicals due to the non-linear dissociation rate of SiH4 and CH4 at low RF plasma growth. With appropriately parametric tooling, the incomplete dissociation facilitates the synthesis of nearly isolated and defect-free Si-rich SixC1−x film, thus enabling the future application of all SixC1−x based single-junction photovoltaic solar cells and dual-junction SixC1−x/a-Si tandem photovoltaic solar cells.
4. Conclusion
The semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x film synthesized with hydrogen-free PECVD at low temperature and threshold RF plasma conditions is employed to fabricate Si-rich SixC1−x based single p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cell and dual-junction Si-rich SixC1−x/a-Si:H tandem photovoltaic solar cell. With reducing the RF plasma power from 100 W to 20 W under the fixed fluence ratio of 60%, the Si/C compositional ratio of the semi-transparent Si-rich SixC1−x is increased from 1.86 to 1.94 because the dissociation rate of CH4 is scaled down to enlarge the Si content in Si-rich SixC1−x film, which also contributes to the optical bandgap red-shifted from 2.4 to 1.4 eV. Furthermore, the absorption coefficient at visible regime (λ= 0.4–0.8 μm) for Si-rich SixC1−x film is enhanced to 104–105 cm−1 when decreasing the RF plasma powers, which is even one order of magnitude larger than those of bulk c-Si and c-SiC. The incomplete dissociation of CH4 and SiH4 under low-power PECVD growth enhances the hydrogenation of SixC1−x film further to suppress the defects and improve the electrical properties of Si-rich SixC1−x. After thermal at 650 °C, the resistivities of n-type and p-type SixC1−x films with optimized thickness of 25 nm are decreased to 0.875 Ω cm and 0.12 Ω cm by doping with the PH3 and B2H6 fluence ratios of 5.8% and 2.1%, respectively. With the optimized i-SixC1−x thickness to 25 nm, both the semi-transparent Si-rich based single and tandem p–i–n junction photovoltaic solar cells approach the highest power conversion efficiency. When thinning the i-SixC1−x layer to 25 nm, the Voc and Jsc of the annealed Si-rich SixC1−x and amorphous Si based dual-junction thin-film photovoltaic solar cell are increased to 0.78 V and 19.1 mA cm−2, respectively, which provides a conversion efficiency to 5.24% with a filling factor of 35%. The appropriately parametric tooling benefits the synthesis of nearly isolated and defect-free Si-rich SixC1−x film from incomplete dissociation, thus enabling the Si-rich SixC1−x based single- and dual-junction thin-film photovoltaic solar cells with higher conversion efficiencies than ever reported.
