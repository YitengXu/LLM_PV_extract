    , Accepted 12th May 2017First published on 16th May 2017AbstractThe poor air and thermal stability of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells have hindered their real applications. Here we report the insertion of a chemical vapor deposited graphene between the Au electrode and spiro-OMeTAD in planar perovskite solar cells to block the diffusion of air and Au into the perovskite layer, where the single layer graphene is transferred into the devices by a simple laminated process. After ageing in 45% humidity air for 96 h or thermal annealing at 80 °C for 12 h, more than 94% PCE of the devices with graphene can be maintained, which is much better than that of devices without graphene (∼57%). The improved stability of devices with the graphene layer is attributed to the reduction of carrier recombination from decomposition of the perovskite layer in air or Au doping into the perovskite layer under annealing treatment. Therefore, graphene is a promising ultra-thin barrier against air and metal diffusion, and has potential applications in photovoltaic devices, integrated circuit chips and light emitting diodes.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies in recent years. In the past six years, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been rapidly improved from less than 4% to above 22%,1 which is comparable to that of commercialized Si-based solar cells while the cost of PSCs2 can be much lower due to their convenient fabrication process. Despite tremendous progress in improving the cell performance, the stability of PSCs is still an open issue to be addressed. In fact, PSCs are facing air (H2O and O2) instability,3 thermal instability4 and UV instability,5 which could dramatically restrict the future commercial application of PSCs. Owing to the hydrolysis property, CH3NH3PbI3 could be decomposed into PbI2 and CH3NH3I in air, associating a color change from dark brown to yellow. Regarding the thermal stability, the main degradation processes of PSC devices at high temperatures involve the decomposition of the perovskite layer or migration of metals into perovskite layers. Guerrero et al. have found that even noble metals, such as gold, can diffuse through hole transport layers to react with perovskite layers, producing irreversible degradation of PSCs.6 Recently, Domanski et al. also found that gold can migrate through the hole transport layer (HTL) into the perovskite layer, providing inferior doping even at low temperature and in a short time, which is the main reason for degradation of PSCs under thermal annealing treatment.7 More recently, Zhang et al. demonstrated that Ag atoms can also easily penetrate through the HTL and diffuse into the perovskite layer even under ambient conditions.8
Several solutions have been proposed so far to improve the air stability of PSCs. Habisreutinger et al. demonstrated an elegant approach to block water ingress in PSCs by using polymer-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) embedded in an insulated polymer, such as PMMA and polycarbonate (PC), as the HTL.9 It is found that the hybrid HTL embedded in the inert polymer offers unprecedented resilience against thermal stressing and moisture ingress. Wang et al. demonstrated that inserting an insulated polymer, such as polystyrene (PS), Teflon and polyvinylidene-trifluoroethylene copolymer (PVDF-TrFE), between the perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) in PSCs can also serve as an encapsulation layer to prevent the perovskite film from damage caused by moisture or water.10 However, the photogenerated charges in the above devices need to tunnel through these insulated polymers for transport, therefore the performance of PSCs is very sensitive to the thickness of polymers. In order to reduce the thermal instability caused by migration of metals (Al, Ag or Au) into the perovskite layer, several diffusion barrier layers are inserted to separate the metal electrodes and the perovskite layer, such as Cr2O3/Cr,6 Cr.7 However, because all the metals have the diffusion characteristic, these metal-based buffer layers may prevent the reaction between the metal electrodes and the perovskite layer in a short period of time, but cannot solve the long-term stability issue.11
Graphene has been used widely in organic12–14 and perovskite solar cells.15–17 It is composed of sp2-bonded carbons in an aromatic ring structure with only one atomic layer thick, which has high impermeability even to the smallest molecule. For example, Tsetseris et al. used the density-functional theory method to examine the impermeability of graphene. Their results demonstrated that graphene has large potential barriers of 4.2 eV and 5.5 eV for permeation of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, respectively, so under thermal equilibrium conditions, water and oxygen cannot pass through the graphene film.18 Chen et al. demonstrated for the first time the O2 impermeability of the graphene film to protect the surface of Cu or Cu/Ni alloy from air oxidation.19 Seethamraju et al. reported that a single layer graphene can reduce the polymer's water vapor transmission rate by up to a million-fold due to the high energy required to overcome the potential field of the graphene film.20 Kim et al. reported that graphene can serve as an effective metal diffusion barrier to prevent the reaction between metals (Al, Ni and Au) and silicon even at a high temperature (>600 °C).21 Wang et al. and Petersen et al. have separately demonstrated that graphene or graphene oxide can function as an efficient blocking layer toward metal penetration into organic molecules.22,23 Therefore, graphene can block or retard the migration of oxygen, water and metal into the adjacent phases. By virtue of the high impermeability of graphene in combination with its chemically stable and mechanically robust properties, graphene can be applied as an effective blocking layer to protect air sensitive devices and retard unwanted metal migration in devices.24
In this study, a single layer graphene was introduced into PSCs as an air and metal blocking layer to protect the perovskite layer, through a simple lamination and fumigation process. Graphene itself is electrically conductive, and can block the oxygen, water and gold migration into the perovskite layer (as shown in Fig. 1). Therefore, PSCs with a graphene layer showed a significantly enhanced stability under ambient conditions or thermal annealing treatment.

2. Results and discussion
A graphene film on copper foil is prepared by the CVD method.25 Raman spectroscopy is applied to evaluate its quality (Fig. S1†). The full width half-maximum (fwhm) of the 2D peak is 32, and the intensity ratio of the 2D band to G band (I2D/IG) is about 4.36. Both the I2D/IG and fwhm of the 2D band are consistent with those of monolayer graphene.26 In addition to the dense structure, hydrophobicity is another important advantage for graphene as the blocking layer, which readily inhibited the entrance of water molecules into the perovskite film to significantly enhance the stability of PSCs.27,28 As shown in Fig. 2a, the contact angle of water on the graphene film is 90°,29 while the contact angle of water on the spiro-OMeTAD film is 71°, revealing an affinity to moisture. Therefore, the hydrophobic graphene could retard the degradation of perovskite solar cells by preventing the moisture penetration into the perovskite layer more effectively, which will be proved by the following analyses.

Humidity can induce decomposition of dark brown CH3NH3PbI3 films into yellow PbI2, resulting in a declining PSC performance. The degradation process and decay mechanism of perovskites in humid air can be expressed as following equations:30,31 CH3NH3PbI3 + H2O ↔ CH3NH3PbI3·H2O(1) CH3NH3PbI3·H2O ↔ PbI2 + CH3NH3I + H2O(2) CH3NH3PbI3 + O2 ↔ CH3NH3 + PbI2 + ½I2 + H2O(3)
To obtain more direct evidence for the protecting effect of graphene on the perovskite film, the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD films with or without the graphene layer are exposed to ambient environment with a relative humidity (RH) of ∼45% for different periods. The XRD patterns at the beginning, 48 h and 96 h are shown in Fig. S2† and Fig. 2b, the diffraction peak (001) from PbI232 can be observed after ageing for 48 h and its intensity is shown to increase after 96 h, indicating that a larger amount of PbI2 is produced by degradation of CH3NH3PbI3. In contrast, no obvious PbI2 peak appears for the perovskite film with a graphene layer. According to the above results, the graphene evidently demonstrates its protecting ability to the perovskite layer in air. As we all know, the increased PbI2 will influence the light absorption of PSCs to decrease their performance. It is also found that PbI2 can restrict charge-carrier transport33 or act as a hole scattering center,4,34 the formation of such scattering centers would also accelerate the performance degradation of PSCs.

Fig. 3a shows a schematic illustration of transfer graphene in PSC as the blocking layer. The large-scale supporter-assisted transfer process consists of several significant steps. The first is to evaporate a 100 nm Au film on the graphene/Cu substrate. A support film such as thermal-release tape or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is then attached to the gold deposited on the graphene film. Copper foil is removed in a diluted FeCl3 solution and the supporter/Au/graphene film is transferred on spiro-OMeTAD of PSC without the top electrode. Then a special chlorobenzene-fumigation process is applied to enhance the contact between the graphene and spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S3†). In this process, the FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD substrate is placed on a pre-heated hot plate (90 °C) in a glovebox, and the supporter/Au/graphene substrate is laminated on the spiro-OMeTAD surfaces to obtain final devices. A pipette with chlorobenzene is placed to the side of spiro-OMeTAD, the spiro-OMeTAD can absorb chlorobenzene vapor and gradually turned from green to faint yellow (the same as the colour of the spiro-OMeTAD solution) from the edges toward the center in about 2 s, indicating dissolution of spiro-OMeTAD under a chlorobenzene vapor atmosphere, and then a Teflon rod is rolled with appropriate pressure on top of the device to enhance the contact between graphene and spiro-OMeTAD. After being fumigated for about 30 s, the device is transferred to another pre-heated hot plate (100 °C) and annealed for 10 min to remove the supporter layer. The cross-sectional images of devices before and after fumigation treatment are observed by SEM and shown in Fig. 3b. Before the fumigation treatment, some gaps highlighted with red arrows can be observed at the Au/graphene and spiro-OMeTAD interface. It is found that upon fumigation treatment, these interfacial gaps disappear, the absence of which is apparent in Fig. 3b.

In order to investigate the influence of fumigation treatment on the performance of devices with the graphene blocking layer, 80 separate devices with or without fumigation treatment are fabricated and tested. The histograms of the device efficiencies are presented in Fig. S4.† The devices with fumigation treatment exhibit a higher average PCE of 14.05% than 8.10% of the control devices without fumigation treatment. These results indicate that fumigation treatment can significantly increase the performance of PSCs. The improved efficiency is associated with the improved contact between the graphene and spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 3b), which can help facilitate the charge transport.
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices with or without graphene as the blocking layer are measured under a simulated AM1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2, which are presented in Fig. 4a. After optimizing the laminated process, the device with graphene shows a comparable PCE of 15.7% to the device without graphene (16.6%). To confirm these results, the photocurrent densities and PCEs as a function of time at the maximum power point (with graphene: 0.84 V and without graphene 0.86 V) were measured, as shown in Fig. S5,† which remained stable toward 550 s scan, and the stable PCEs of 15.7% and 16.6% were demonstrated for devices with or without graphene, respectively. The incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) for the devices with or without graphene are shown in Fig. S6.†

2.1. Stability in ambient air
The long-term air stability is an extensive focus for PSCs with an aim for commercial applications. Therefore, the efficiency versus time is investigated for all the PSCs. First of all, the unencapsulated devices with or without graphene are exposed to ambient environment with a relative humidity of ∼45%. For clarity, the PCEs of all of the cells are normalized (the initial PCEs of PSCs with graphene are 15.42 ± 0.24% and that of the PSCs without graphene are 16.10 ± 0.45%). As shown in the PCE-versus-time curves of Fig. 4b, PCEs of devices without graphene are quickly dropped to 57% of their initial value in 96 h while the PSCs with graphene demonstrated relatively higher stability maintaining over 95% of their initial PCE value. The degradation speed of PCE (η) can be defined as a function of time t by a(t) = d(η(t)/η(0))/dt, where η(0) and η(t) are the initial PCE and the PCE at time t, respectively. Therefore the devices without graphene show a degradation speed of α = 0.45% h−1. However, the devices with a graphene layer show α = 0.043% h−1, less than one tenth of that of the control device without graphene, indicating that the graphene layer can slow down the degradation speed of PSCs in air. J–V characteristics of PSCs with or without the graphene layer before and after ageing in air for 96 h are shown in Fig. S7.† For the J–V curves of the control device without graphene, a severe decay of the Jsc from 21.60 to 12.63 mA cm−2, a concomitant drop of the Voc from 1.08 to 0.95 V and an unnormal J–V curve with a pseudo FF (≈79%) are found. In contrast to that, the devices with graphene exhibit no significant degradation (degradated PCE <5%, Fig. 4b). These results demonstrate the success of our strategy by using graphene as the blocking layer to improve the air stability of PSC devices in ambient environment.
In order to further unravel the influence of the graphene layer on the charge transport properties of PSCs in air, chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is applied to monitor the device impedance as a function of frequency in the dark under a reverse potential of 0.85 V. The Nyquist plots of devices with or without graphene before and after ageing in air are illuminated in Fig. S8a and b† and Fig. 4c and d, respectively, which also include the corresponding fitted curves based on a relatively simple equivalent circuit model, shown in Fig. S9.† Based on the equivalent circuit model, the data in the Nyquist plot are separated into a series resistance (Rs) connected with two components for the contact resistance (Rco) at the HTL/perovskite and perovskite/ETL interfaces and the recombination resistance (Rrec) forming a parallel circuit with capacitors (Cco and Crec). According to the fitted parameters summarized in Table S1,† the recombination resistance of PSCs with graphene shows no significant change after ageing in air for 96 h. However, the device without graphene shows a much lower recombination resistance (1270 Ω) than that of the pristine device (2780 Ω) after ageing in air, and this trend is similar to the reported results.35 The Rrec is inversely proportional to the recombination rate of the device, the decreased Rrec of PSCs without graphene indicates more electron–hole recombination in the device. The increased recombination rate might be due to the presence of PbI2. Therefore, the graphene layer can effectively suppress the charge recombination in a PSC when the PSC is exposed to humid air. The EIS results of the PSCs with or without graphene are consistent with their air stability performance, as discussed before.
2.2. Stability under annealing treatment
To study the thermal stability of the device with or without graphene, all the devices are placed on a hot plate at 80 °C in a glovebox for annealing treatment. As shown in the PCE-versus-time curves of Fig. 5a, the efficiency of PSCs with the graphene layer can be maintained at 96% after annealing at 80 °C for 12 h. Thus, the newly developed PSCs with a graphene blocking layer possess excellent thermal stability. Surprisingly, the PCE of some PSCs with graphene can be improved to 105% of the initial value after annealing for 2 h. The initial increase in PCE is possibly related to improved interfacial properties; specifically the contact quality of spiro-OMeTAD and graphene is improved further. Again in striking contrast, the Jsc, Voc and FF of devices without graphene are severely dropped (Fig. S10b†), resulting in a PCE drop to only 46% of its initial value.

(b) XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 films with or without graphene after annealing at 80 °C for 12 h. Nyquist plot of PSCs with (c) or without (d) the graphene blocking layer after annealing at 80 °C for 12 h. 
The thermal degradation of PSCs has been extensively investigated by Domanski et al. and Brinkmann et al. Domanski et al. found that the Au electrode can migrate into the perovskite layer through the spiro-OMeTAD,7,36 resulting in undesirable doping in the perovskite layer, which is the main reason for degradation of PSCs under thermal treatment. Brinkmann et al. demonstrated that the CH3NH3PbI3 film can be thermally decomposed into PbI2, CH3NH3I and HI even under inert conditions, and the egress of CH3NH3I and HI out of the perovskite is the main contributor to the performance degradation of PSCs under thermal treatment. Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of annealing treatment on the perovskite film, XRD and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are applied to characterize the structure of the perovskite film and quantify the amount of Au diffused in the perovskite film after annealing at 80 °C for 12 h, respectively. XRD patterns of the perovskite film before and after annealing in a glovebox are shown in Fig. 5b. XRD analysis showed no correlation between perovskite decomposition and the annealing treatment (80 °C for 12 h), so the dramatic device performance loss is not due to the structural change of the perovskite film. On the other hand, ICP-MS measurement is done by removing the Au electrode and dissolving the perovskite layer of the devices (for more information, see the Experimental section). The measurement found a large amount of Au of about 568.6 ng in the sample without graphene, while the level of Au found in the sample with graphene was only 43.7 ng, as summarized in Table S2.† It means that the level of Au in the devices without graphene is about 13 times that of the devices with graphene after annealing. The diffused Au can produce shunts across the device, reducing the FF, and create deep trap states within the perovskite film, enhancing the charge recombination and consequently degrading Voc and Jsc.7 This is why the PSCs without graphene show much lower FF, Voc and Jsc than those with the graphene blocking layer after annealing treatment (Fig. S10†).
In order to pinpoint the observed degradation due to Au diffusion into the perovskite layer and explain the graphene effect on the thermal stability of PSCs, EIS is used to analyze the Rrec of PSCs with or without the graphene layer before and after annealing at 80 °C for 12 h, as shown in Fig. 5c and d and Fig. S11.† According to the fitted parameters summarized in Table S3,† a slight reduction of the Rrec for PSCs with graphene from 3100 to 2940 Ω may be due to the diffusion of Au from the side of graphene into the perovskite layer. However, the device without graphene shows a much lower Rrec (830 Ω) than that of the pristine device (3220 Ω), decreasing to ∼26% of its initial value, which leads to a significant decrease in current through recombination (Fig. S10b†). The decreased recombination resistance for the device without graphene may be due to the higher exciton quenching caused by gold that migrated into the perovskite film.7
3. Conclusions
In summary, PSCs with high air and thermal stabilities have been achieved by utilizing a CVD-graphene as an interlayer. The graphene layer is inserted in between the spiro-OMeTAD and metal electrode, which can not only protect the perovskite film from the damage of moisture in air, but also block the undesirable migration of the metal into the perovskite layer. The PSCs with graphene can retain 94% of their initial PCE in 45% humidity air after 96 h or under 80 °C thermal annealing treatment after 12 h. The performance is much better than that of the devices without graphene. These results provide the possibility of using two-dimensional materials as an effective blocking layer toward manufacturing highly stable PSCs.
4. Experimental
4.1. Fabrication of PSCs
The FTO/glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic bath in acetone, ethanol and water for 20 min, respectively. The substrates were further cleaned with UV-ozone treatment for 10 min. Subsequently, a 40 nm TiO2 compact layer was deposited on FTO via hydrolysis of TiCl4 according to a reported low-temperature solution procedure.37 After being deposited, the substrates were rinsed with ethanol, annealed at 180 °C for 30 min and then cooled down to room temperature in air. The glass/FTO/TiO2 substrates were treated by an UV-ozone treatment for 10 min before deposition of the perovskite films. The perovskite solution containing 1 mmol PbI2 (99.99%, Alfar Aesar), 1 mmol CH3NH3I (synthesized according to our earlier work38,39), and 1 mmol dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, Aldrich) was dissolved in 600 mg of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Alfa Aesar). The mixed solution was spin-coated on top of the TiO2 at 1000 rpm for 5 s and 4000 rpm for 45 s while dripping chlorobenzene onto the substrate during the second spinning step. All the samples were then heated at 100 °C for 10 min resulting in the formation of dark perovskite films. The spiro-OMeTAD (70 mM solution in chlorobenzene) doped with 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Sigma Aldrich) and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, Sigma Aldrich) is deposited by spin coating (4000 rpm for 20 s) as a hole transport layer on top of the perovskite film. For the device without the graphene layer, a 100 nm thick gold top electrode was directly thermal evaporated on spiro-OMeTAD by using a shadow mask to form an active area of 9 mm2. For the device with the graphene layer, a supporter/Au/graphene substrate with a size of 9 mm2 is laminated on the spiro-OMeTAD surface upon the fumigation and annealing treatment. At last, the devices were transferred to a pre-heated hot plate (100 °C) and annealed for 10 min to remove the supporter.
4.2. Preparing the aged samples for XRD and ICP measurement
After the PSCs with or without graphene were aged in air or by annealing treatment for different times, the Au and Au/graphene electrodes were removed from the PSCs with a piece of scotch tape. Subsequently, the samples were immersed in a bath of chlorobenzene three times to dissolve the spiro-OMeTAD. Then, the samples were rinsed with chlorobenzene and dried in a glovebox for XRD measurement or ICP analysis.
4.3. ICP spectrometry
20 samples with or without graphene prepared above were separately placed in a vial containing 10 mL of 4:1 HCl (37%)/HNO3 (67%) aqua regia and sonicated for 10 min, and the samples were left overnight for dissolution. The ICP analysis was performed with a Brooke M90 on the aqua regia solution diluted in a 1:100 ratio with water. The detection limit for Au was ∼0.05 ng in 1 mL of the solution. The active area of the device was 9 mm2, as defined by the overlap of Au (or Au/graphene) and FTO electrodes in the central part of the device.
4.4. Characterization
The cross-section images of PSCs with graphene before and after fumigation treatment were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI, SU-8020). The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of a standard AM 1.5 solar simulator with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G, SAN-EIELECTRIC XES-40S2-CE solar simulator), as calibrated with a NREL-traceable KG5 filtered silicon reference cell. The active areas of all solar cells were determined by using a 9 mm2 metal mask. All devices were scanned in a standard test procedure at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the PSCs were obtained by using a Q Test Station 500TI system (Crowntech. Inc., USA). The monochromatic light intensity for IPCE was calibrated using a reference silicon detector. Impedance spectroscopic measurements (EIS) were conducted by using an electrochemical workstation (IM6ex, Zahner, Germany) with the frequency range from 10 Hz to 4 MHz under 0.85 V in the dark.
