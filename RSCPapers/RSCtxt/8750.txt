    , Accepted 6th July 2022First published on 6th July 2022AbstractThe past few years have witnessed rapid progress of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), however, the simultaneous achievement of high open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) still remains a critical challenge. Herein, we used a random copolymerization strategy to develop a series of polymer acceptors named PY-X (where X stands for the molar ratio of two monomers) by polymerizing small molecule acceptor (SMA) monomers of SMA-C11 and SMA-DT with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene as the connecting unit. Upon random copolymerization, the optical and electronic properties of the polymer acceptors can be well tuned. Consequently, compared with PY-C11 and PY-DT, the random copolymer based all-PSCs exhibit improved PCEs. The best-performing device based on PY-82 produces a high PCE of 17.15% (certified as 16.7%), with a Voc of 0.950 V, a Jsc of 23.82 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.8%, representing the highest efficiency reported for the binary all-PSCs to date. This work suggests that random copolymerization is a promising synthetic strategy in developing efficient polymer acceptors.

Broader context
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received widespread interest owing to the advantages of being low-cost, light weight, flexible and solution-processible. The recent advances of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) lead to significant efficiency improvements of PSCs. Compared to SMA-based PSCs, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) consisting of both polymeric donor and acceptor materials, have excellent mechanical robustness and morphological stability, which are thought to be more desirable for the large-scale commercialization of PSCs. Although all-PSCs have made great progress in the past few years, there is still a large efficiency gap between all-PSCs and SMA-based PSCs. The simultaneous achievement of high open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) currently remains a key challenge for all-PSCs. To address this issue, herein, we applied a random copolymerization strategy for the design of high-performance polymer acceptors. By carefully manipulating the ratio of the monomers of SMA-DT and SMA-C11, we found that the optical and electronic properties of the resulting copolymers could be fine-tuned. Consequently, the best-performing PY-82-based binary all-PSC produces a record-high efficiency of 17.15% (certified as 16.7%), with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.950 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.82 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 75.8%. Moreover, the PY-82-based device exhibits excellent photostability. Our work shows that random copolymerization is a facile and highly efficient strategy for the synthesis of high-performance polymer acceptors.

Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their advantages of light weight, low cost and facile fabrication of flexible solar panels.1–4 Thanks to the development of small molecule acceptors (SMAs)5,6 in the past decade, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been rapidly boosted to over 19%.7–10 Different from SMA-based PSCs, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) consisting of both polymeric donor and acceptor materials, have more notable merits of excellent mechanical robustness and morphological stability, which are thought to have great potential for the large-scale commercialization of PSCs.11–14 Although all-PSCs are of growing interest, their PCEs still lag far behind those of SMA-based PSCs, mainly due to the lack of high-performance polymer acceptors.
In 2017, Li et al. proposed a strategy to synthesize polymer acceptors by polymerizing small molecule acceptors with a π-bridge linking unit (PSMAs). By using this strategy, the PZ1 acceptor afforded a PCE of 9.19%.15 After that, PSMAs became a mainstream design strategy to synthesize high-performance polymer acceptors.16–19 The recent success of Y-series SMAs has accelerated the development of PSMAs and a few representative PSMAs with PCEs over 16% have been reported.20–22 In the pioneering attempts of molecular optimization, much effort has been focused on the modifications of the SMA main building block,23 fluorinated end group, and π-bridge.24–26 Besides these approaches, the random copolymerization comprising three or more functional units in the backbone which can integrate the complementary advantages of each chromophore appears to be a very promising and feasible synthetic strategy for fine-tuning the optical and electronic properties of polymer acceptors.27–30 Meanwhile, the molecular crystallinity, morphological compatibility with the donor polymer, and charge transport behaviour can be also manipulated by judiciously tailoring the chemical nature and relative amount of the monomers involved in random copolymerization.31–34 Despite these attractive advantages, the random copolymerization has been rarely used to synthesize PSMAs.35,36
In our recent work, we reported an efficient polymer acceptor named PY-DT by modifying the beta position of the thiophene unit core with branched alkyl chains.22 It was shown that the branched alkyl chain modification of SMA-DT could lead to upshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and blue-shifted absorption spectra, and thereby an improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.949 V in the related photovoltaic device. Nevertheless, because of the blue-shifted absorption, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the PY-DT-based all-PSC is limited to 23.40 mA cm−2. To further improve the PCE, the device parameters of Voc and Jsc should be simultaneously improved; however, Voc and Jsc are usually in a trade-off relationship, and achieving both with high values is a critical challenge.23,37 Moreover, most all-PSCs suffer from a relatively low fill factor (FF) (typically <70%) compared to SMA-based devices.38–41 To address these issues, we herein applied a random copolymerization strategy for the design of efficient PSMAs. Upon the random copolymerization, SMA-C11 and SMA-DT have been employed as the monomers due to their difference in LUMO energy levels and absorption bands. Together with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene as the π-bridge, a series of PSMAs named PY-X (where X stands for the molar ratio of SMA-C11 and SMA-DT) were developed. Through subtly manipulating the molar ratios of SMA-DT and SMA-C11, the optical and electronic properties of the random copolymers can be well tuned. Among these random copolymers, PY-82 based all-PSCs exhibited more balanced charge transport, optimized fibril morphology and suppressed charge recombination. Consequently, the Jsc and FF of the PM6:PY-82 device were simultaneously improved in comparison with PY-DT and PY-C11-based all-PSCs and the Voc is similar to that of the PY-DT-based device. In detail, a high PCE of 17.15% with a Voc of 0.950 V, a Jsc of 23.82 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.8% is achieved, which represents the highest PCE reported for binary all-PSCs thus far.
Results and discussion
The chemical structure and synthetic route of the SMA-C11 monomer are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†), and the detailed synthetic conditions are described in the ESI.† SMA-DT was synthesized according to our previous work. SMA-C11 was characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectra (MALDI-TOF) (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). PY-91, PY-82, and PY-73 were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization of two Y6-series SMA monomers of SMA-C11 and SMA-DT, and the 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene unit. Besides, PY-C11 and PY-DT were also synthesized for comparison (Scheme S2, ESI†). All the polymer acceptors can be well dissolved in chloroform, chlorobenzene, and toluene. We also performed high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC) using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C (Fig. S3, ESI†). The averaged molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of PY-C11, PY-91, PY-82, PY-37, and PY-DT are 9.3 kDa/2.00, 8.6 kDa/2.01, 8.9 kDa/2.32, 10.7 kDa/1.97, and 7.2 kDa/1.98, respectively.
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PM6 and the polymer acceptors were measured in both diluted chloroform solutions and thin films. As shown in Fig. 1b, PM6 exhibits strong absorption in a broad wavelength range of visible spectra, and the polymer acceptors show main absorption bands between 600 and 900 nm in the solid state. The well-complemented absorption profiles of PM6 and the polymer acceptors is helpful to yield a high photocurrent in the photovoltaic cells (Fig. S4b, ESI†). Additionally, the main absorption peak of PY-C11 is mainly concentrated at 820 nm, while the main absorption peak of PY-DT is located at 808 nm. Therefore, with increasing the molecular ratio of SMA-DT, obvious blue-shifted absorption of PY-X acceptors can be observed. A similar trend of the absorption of PY-X acceptors in solution was also seen (Fig. S4a, ESI†). Subsequently, the cyclic voltammetry measurement was carried out to study the electrochemical properties of PM6 and PY-X (Fig. S5, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1c, the LUMO and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PM6, PY-C11, PY-91, PY-82, PY-73, and PY-DT were measured to be −3.50/−5.34, −3.90/−5.68, −3.89/−5.67, −3.88/−5.64, −3.88/−5.63, and −3.82/−5.59 eV, respectively. These results demonstrate that adjusting the amounts of SMA-DT in the random copolymers could subtly tune the optical and electrochemical properties of PY-X acceptors, which is beneficial to achieve a high Jsc and Voc in the resulting all-PSCs.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of PY-X acceptors, all-PSCs with a conventional device architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag were fabricated, where PM6 was used as the donor polymer and PNDIT-F3N was used as the electron transport layer. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 1d and the device parameters of the optimized all-PSCs are summarized in Table 1. It was found that the PM6:PY-C11 device yields a PCE of 16.31%, with a Voc of 0.941 V, a Jsc of 23.71 mA cm−2 and an FF of 73.1%. The PY-DT-based device shows a PCE of 16.57%, with a Voc of 0.953 V, a Jsc of 23.40 mA cm−2 and an FF of 74.3%. After random copolymerization, PY-91, PY-82, and PY-73 show enhanced photovoltaic performance and the best PY-82-based device exhibits a champion efficiency of 17.15% (certified as 16.7% by the National Institute of Metrology in China, Fig. S6, ESI†), with a Voc of 0.950 V, a Jsc of 23.82 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.8%. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE has been the highest efficiency value reported for the binary all-PSCs so far (Fig. 1g), even comparable to those of the best-performing ternary all-PSCs. The high efficiency is mainly ascribed to the integrated advantages of PY-C11 and PY-DT. The up-shifted LUMO level of PY-DT and the more broad absorption spectra of PY-C11 contribute to the high Voc and Jsc, respectively, for the PY-82-based all-PSC. The well-defined fibril morphology ensures efficient charge transport, and thereby a high FF in the device, which will be described in the following morphology section. This result indicates that a high Voc, Jsc and FF could be achieved simultaneously by elaborately optimizing the molar ratio of the monomers in the synthesis of random copolymerization. The statistical histograms of the PCEs of the all-PSCs reveals the reliability of these high-performance all-PSCs (Fig. 1f). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized all-PSCs were recorded using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (QE-R3011, Enlitech). As shown in Fig. 1e, the maximum EQE values reach 80% in the wavelength range of 450–600 nm and obviously decrease in the wavelength range of 650–820 nm. If the EQE values can be improved in this wavelength range, a Jsc over 24.0 mA cm−2 or even higher is anticipated, which needs further investigation.

In addition to PCEs, the photostability is also an important factor when evaluating the potential for future commercialization of PSCs. In this regard, the photostability of the developed all-PSCs was tracked under continuous illumination by using maximum power point (MPP) tracking methods. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the T80 values (the time required to reach 80% of the initial performance) are 269, 288, and 302 h for PM6:PY-C11, PM6:PY-DT and PM6:PY-82 devices, respectively. The better photostability of PY-82-based all-PSCs manifests that the strategy of random copolymerization can not only boost the efficiency, but also improve the device stability.
The hole and electron mobilities of the neat and blend films were measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S8, ESI†). The calculated hole (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Comparable μe values of the PY-X acceptors are obtained with the average values of 5.12 × 10−4, 5.33 × 10−4, 5.21 × 10−4, 5.07 × 10−4, and 5.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PY-C11, PY-91, PY-82, PY-73, and PY-DT, respectively. As for the blend films, the average μh and μe values were calculated to be 3.70 × 10−4/3.26 × 10−4, 3.66 × 10−4/3.27 × 10−4, 3.72 × 10−4/3.47 × 10−4, 3.74 × 10−4/3.42 × 10−4, and 3.65 × 10−4/3.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PM6:PY-C11, PM6:PY-91, PM6:PY-82, PM6:PY-73, and PM6:PY-DT films, respectively. It can be seen that, among the blend films, the PM6:PY-82 film possesses the lowest μh/μe of 1.07. The more balanced charge transport helps explain the high FF achieved in PM6:PY-82 devices.
The dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) was measured to investigate the charge generation and exciton dissociation behaviour of the all-PSCs. As shown in Fig. S9a (ESI†), the exciton dissociation probability P(E, T), determined from Jph under short-circuit conditions divided by the saturated photocurrent density (Jsat),42 was estimated to be 96.5%, 97.0%, 98.2%, 97.5%, and 97.3% for PM6:PY-C11, PM6:PY-91, PM6:PY-82, PM6:PY-73, and PM6:PY-DT devices, respectively. Furthermore, the dependence of Voc and Jsc on the light intensity (Plight) was measured to study the charge recombination in the devices. The relationship between Jsc and Plight follows the power-law equation of Jsc ∝ (Plight)α.43 The α values were calculated to be 0.97, 0.97, 0.99, 0.98, and 0.98 for PM6:PY-C11, PM6:PY-91, PM6:PY-82, PM6:PY-73, and PM6:PY-DT devices, respectively, which are almost close to unity, suggesting the negligible bimolecular recombination in these devices under short-circuit conditions (Fig. S9b, ESI†). Additionally, the Vocversus light intensity (Plight) of the all-PSCs is plotted in Fig. S9c (ESI†). In general, when the dominant mechanism is bimolecular recombination, a slope of kT/q (k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge) in the plot of Vocversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity is obtained. When trap-assisted recombination is involved, a higher dependence of the Voc on the light intensity (>kT/q) is expected.44 Herein, slopes of 1.36, 1.33, 1.12, 1.29, and 1.24 kT/q were calculated for PM6:PY-C11, PM6:PY-91, PM6:PY-82, PM6:PY-73, and PM6:PY-DT devices, respectively. The smallest slope value in the PM6:PY-82 device indicates that trap-assisted recombination was effectively suppressed. Thus, efficient exciton dissociation, balanced charge transport, and suppressed charge recombination account for the high photovoltaic performance achieved in PM6:PY-82 devices.
The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement was carried out to investigate the surface morphology of the neat and blend films. It is interesting to find that all PY-X neat films exhibit fibrillar morphology and the fibril network textures in the PY-82 and PY-73 films are much evident (Fig. S10, ESI†), which is favorable for efficient charge transport.45,46 Regarding the blend films, well-defined fibrillar morphology with small root mean square (RMS) roughness values varying from 0.95 to 1.26 nm for PM6:PY-C11 to PM6:PY-DT, respectively, can be also seen (Fig. 2). The fibril width was found to differ largely. We measured the fibril width (d) of PM6:PY-C11, PM6:PY-82, and PM6:PY-DT to make a distinct comparison, and the line profiles of the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the peaks in the AFM images are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The average d values are 10.19, 14.92, and 23.09 nm for PM6:PY-C11, PM6:PY-82, and PM6:PY-DT blends, respectively. These results suggest that the random copolymerization strategy can effectively optimize the morphology of the active layer and form an optimized fibril width to ensure efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed to investigate the crystallinity and packing behaviour of both the neat and blend films. 2D GIWAXS diffraction patterns and the corresponding line cut profiles are presented in Fig. S12 (ESI†) and Fig. 3, respectively. The quantitative analysis results are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The neat PY-X films adopt a preferred face-on orientation, evidenced by the obvious lamellar diffraction peaks at q = ∼0.39 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction and the strong π–π diffraction peaks at q = ∼1.60 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. The PM6 film shows q values of 0.29 Å−1 in IP and 1.67 Å−1 in OOP. The calculated crystal coherence length (CCL) values of the π–π diffraction peaks in OOP are 17.59, 17.59, 17.10, 16.84 and 17.53 Å for PY-C11, PY-91, PY-82, PY-73 and PY-DT, respectively. The similar GIWAXS profiles of the neat PY-X films suggest that the random copolymerization has almost no influence on the molecular orientation and the crystallinity of the polymer acceptors. In the blend films, the distinct diffraction peaks are located at q = 0.30 Å−1 in IP, which comes from the PM6 (100) diffraction. The result suggests that the crystallinity of PM6 in the blend films can be well maintained, which can ensure efficient hole transport. The results of the quantitative analysis of the blend films are collected in Table S3 (ESI†).

The energy loss (Eloss) of all-PSCs based on PY-X acceptors has been systematically investigated (Fig. 4). The detailed results are summarized in Table 2. The total Eloss was calculated according to the equation of Eloss = Egap − qVoc, where Egap is the optical bandgap that can be determined from the crossing point between the optical absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of blend films (Fig. S13, ESI†). The Eloss values were calculated to be 0.513 eV for the PY-91-, PY-82-, and PY-73-based devices, which is relatively smaller than those of PY-C11- and PY-DT-based devices (Table 2).

Generally, the Eloss in a solar cell can be divided into three parts: Eloss = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3, where ΔE1 and ΔE2 represent the radiative recombination loss (ΔVrad) above and below the bandgap, respectively. ΔE1 can be defined as Egap − qVSQoc, where VSQoc is the maximum theoretical Voc derived using Shockley–Queisser theory. As shown in Table 2, all the PY-X-based devices show comparable ΔE1 values.
ΔE2 is equal to qVSQoc − qVradoc. The Vradoc values were determined to be 1.111, 1.113, 1.116, 1.114, and 1.132 V for PM6:PY-C11, PM6:PY-91, PM6:PY-82, PM6:PY-73, and PM6:PY-DT devices (Fig. 4a–e), which correspond to ΔE2 values of 0.080, 0.083, 0.081, 0.084, and 0.084 eV, respectively. ΔE3 is the non-radiative recombination loss (ΔVnon-rad) and associated with the electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of the device. ΔE3 can be calculated from the equation of ΔE3 = qVradoc − qVoc = qΔVnon-rad = −kTln(EQEEL).47 As shown in Fig. 4f, the PY-X-based devices all exhibit high EQEEL values, and the ΔE3 values were calculated to be 0.186, 0.183, 0.185, 0.182, and 0.184 eV for PM6:PY-C11, PM6:PY-91, PM6:PY-82, PM6:PY-73, and PM6:PY-DT devices, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the ΔVnon-rad of ∼0.182 V in the PM6:PY-82 device is among the lowest non-radiative recombination loss reported for all-PSCs in the literature thus far (Fig. S14, ESI†). The ΔE3 values obtained from the equation of qVradoc − qVoc are also provided in Table 2, which agree well with those calculated from EQEEL with an acceptable mismatch.
We also compared the hole transfer efficiencies of the blend films using transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) with the pump light centered at 800 nm. As shown in Fig. 5a–c, the positive signals around 820 nm, close to the ground state bleaching (GSB) of acceptors in neat films (Fig. S15, ESI†), are assigned to the GSB of the acceptors. Since the pump light could not directly excite PM6 (Fig. S15a, ESI†), the appearance of the GSB signals in the range of 550 to 650 nm could be attributed to the hole transfer from the polymer acceptors to PM6. As the GSB signals of PM6 appear at 100 ps, the excited state absorption (ESA) signals around 750 nm, which are assigned to those of free polarons, are also formed.48 To compare the hole transfer efficiencies, the traces of the GSB and ESA signals of the different blends were normalized at the maxima of the polymer acceptors’ GSBs in Fig. 5d–f. The PM6:PY-82 and PM6:PY-C11 blends exhibit stronger GSB signals of donors and ESA signals of polarons than the PM6:PY-DT blend after the hole transfer process. These results suggest that the PM6:PY-82 and PM6:PY-C11 blends have higher hole transfer efficiencies relative to PM6:PY-DT, potentially contributing to a higher Jsc.

Normalized TA traces probed at (d) the GSB of the polymer acceptors, (e) the GSB of the PM6 and (f) the ESA of the free polarons. The traces are normalized at the maxima of GSB of the polymer acceptors to compare the hole transfer efficiency. 
To meet the requirement of the practical application of PSCs, we fabricated devices with different active areas (0.36, 0.64, and 1 cm2). The corresponding results are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†) and the J–V and EQE curves are displayed in Fig. S16 (ESI†). Devices with 0.36 and 0.64 cm2 yield PCEs of 16.68% and 16.31%, respectively. When the area reaches 1 cm2, the device still delivers a decent PCE of 15.67%, with a Voc of 0.947 V, a Jsc of 23.87 mA cm−2 and an FF of 69.3%. Additionally, flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) based on PM6:PY-82 were fabricated to investigate the mechanical robustness and morphological stability of this system. The device configuration of FOSCs is shown in Fig. S17a (ESI†). The mechanical stability of the flexible devices was evaluated by repeatedly bending the FOSC at a bending radius of 2.5 mm. As a result, after 1000 and 2000 consecutive bending cycles, the PCEs of the FOSCs remain 92.56% and 88.14% of the initial values, respectively. These results indicate that the FOSC based on PM6:PY-82 has excellent flexural endurance.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed a series of random copolymer acceptors by polymerizing SMA-C11 and SMA-DT monomers with a thiophene unit as the π-bridge. It is revealed that controlling the molecular ratio of SMA-DT can lead to tunable optical and electronic properties of the resulting polymer acceptors. Benefiting from the complementary advantages of SMA-C11 and SMA-DT, PY-82 shows excellent photovoltaic performance and the best-performing device yields a high efficiency of 17.15%, with a Voc of 0.950 V, a Jsc of 23.82 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.8%. The PCE of 17.15% represents the highest efficiency for the binary all-PSCs. Moreover, the PY-82-based device exhibits an extremely low non-radiative recombination voltage loss (0.185 V) and excellent photostability. We believe that, as a simple and effective strategy, the random copolymerization can be utilized to develop high-performance polymer acceptors to further improve the PCEs of all-PSCs.

Broader context
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received widespread interest owing to the advantages of being low-cost, light weight, flexible and solution-processible. The recent advances of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) lead to significant efficiency improvements of PSCs. Compared to SMA-based PSCs, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) consisting of both polymeric donor and acceptor materials, have excellent mechanical robustness and morphological stability, which are thought to be more desirable for the large-scale commercialization of PSCs. Although all-PSCs have made great progress in the past few years, there is still a large efficiency gap between all-PSCs and SMA-based PSCs. The simultaneous achievement of high open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) currently remains a key challenge for all-PSCs. To address this issue, herein, we applied a random copolymerization strategy for the design of high-performance polymer acceptors. By carefully manipulating the ratio of the monomers of SMA-DT and SMA-C11, we found that the optical and electronic properties of the resulting copolymers could be fine-tuned. Consequently, the best-performing PY-82-based binary all-PSC produces a record-high efficiency of 17.15% (certified as 16.7%), with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.950 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.82 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 75.8%. Moreover, the PY-82-based device exhibits excellent photostability. Our work shows that random copolymerization is a facile and highly efficient strategy for the synthesis of high-performance polymer acceptors.
