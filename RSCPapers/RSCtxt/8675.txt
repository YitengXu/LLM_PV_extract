    , Accepted 5th December 2008First published on 16th December 2008AbstractWe report the performance of low-bandgap polymers with a new ACTP acceptor in organic transistors (max. field-effect mobility 0.2 cm2V−1s−1), and solar cells (max. efficiency 1.4%).
Semiconductive polymers may offer a route to photovoltaic and electronic function when characteristics such as light weight, flexibility, and low-temperature processing are required, as in bendable displays, solar panels, and smart textiles.1,2 Key semiconductor material requirements for solar cells and transistors are:3 (i) high optical absorption at wavelengths >500 nm, where solar irradiance peaks;4,5 (ii) high field-effect mobility (µ) >0.1 cm2V−1 s−1,6,7 and (iii) low-cost processing.8 We report the performance of donor–acceptor copolymers designed to achieve these properties.
A donor–acceptor structure reduces optical bandgap, enables absorption down to the near infrared,9–12 and may raise power conversion efficiency (PCE) in solar cells through increased photocurrent.4,13 Benzothiadiazoles14–18 and thienopirazines19–26 are commonly used as acceptors. Of these, thienopyrazine (TP) is advantageous because it allows modification of the pyrazine ring without introducing steric effects directly into the polymer backbone. Thus, alkyl and aryl groups can be added at positions 2 and 3 to tune structural and electronic properties of the acceptor. In this work we introduce a rigid naphthalene moiety fused to the 2 and 3 TP positions. This gives a planar, electron rich π-face of acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine (ACTP), which may promote π–π stacking between polymer chains and lead to improved charge carrier mobility.

        ACTP monomer M1 was prepared from reaction of 3,4-diaminothiophene dihydrochloride and acenaphthenequinone, followed by bromination.27ACTP-fluorene copolymers (ACTP-F) were made via Suzuki coupling (Scheme 1).28 Five polymers were synthesized with different molecular weights (Mw) and side chains to study the effects of these variables on performance. The purified, dark-green powders were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (Table 1), differential scanning calorimetry, UV-vis absorption, and photoelectron spectroscopy, and have a low bandgap of ca. 1.6 eV, with an absorption onset of ca. 800 nm.

We fabricated top-contact organic thin-film transistors (OTFT) from 1–5 to measure mobility. We drop-cast ∼30 nm polymer films on heavily-doped n-type Si wafers with SiO2 (300 nm) treated with octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS). Films were annealed at different temperatures, and gold electrodes were deposited through shadow masks. Annealing at 200 °C in N2 yielded the best performance; lower temperatures gave lower mobilites, and higher temperatures caused film dewetting. Devices fabricated on phenyltrimethoxysilane treated surfaces did not dewet upon annealing, but their mobility was much lower.

Polymers
1–5 show p-channel transport, with mobility as high as 0.2 cm2V−1s−1, of the same order of magnitude as the best polymer semiconductors reported.29–34 The highest mobility was obtained with 1. Fig. 1 displays electrical characteristics of these OTFTs, under inert (a and c) and ambient conditions (b and d). There is no significant threshold voltage shift with changing environment, but mobility is higher in N2 (Fig. 1 a and b). The output traces (Fig. 1 c and d) show somewhat late saturation and do not scale as expected in N2, but improve in air. This behavior was found in all polymers, and may be due to their relatively high HOMO (∼−4.9eV) which makes them succeptible to oxygen doping.23 Transferring the devices back into N2 recovers the same I–V characteristics. The average and max. mobility values of our materials are listed in Table 1.

Mobility decreases with increasing Mw for copolymers 1–4. This is likely a consequence of differences in film microstructure.35 We found by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig. 2a–c) that the grains of annealed films shrink and become less defined as Mw rises. Fig. 2e displays corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, showing that 1, 3 and 4 have equal d-spacing, but the intensity of this signal decreases with increasing Mw, indicating a lower degree of crystalinity in the higher Mw films. The 22.66 Å out of plane spacing in our films suggests partial interdigitation of side chains,36,37 favoring the formation of lamellar and π-stacked sheets and enhancing charge transport.38 The inset shows slices of grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) spectra from 1 and 4. These show a reduction in film ordering with increasing Mw, evidenced in the greater intensity of diffraction spots and the presence of in-plane diffraction rods for film 1 (white arrows), compared to the weak out-of-plane spot and diffraction arch on film 4.

(e) XRD spectra of the films (log scale). The gradual disappearance of the peak at ∼22.66 Å indicates disorder increases with Mw (1–4) or with incorporation of bulky side chains (5). Insets are GIXD slices of 1 and 4 showing the same decrease in film order. 
The steric effects of the fluorene side chains largely impact mobility as seen in the case of 5, with branched chains. This material has Mw just 19% higher than 1 but its mobility is twelve times smaller than that of 1. We attribute such low mobility to decreased film order, manifested in the smoothed AFM of Fig. 2d, and the featureless XRD in Fig. 2e.
We also evaluated 1, 4 and 5 in bulk heterojunction solar cells made using indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass as substrate. First, 50 nm of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) were spin coated on the ITO, followed by spin-coating in N2 environment mixtures of polymer and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC[61]BM) dissolved in orthodichlorobenzene. Films were solvent-annealed in a closed Petri dish,39 and their typical thickness was ∼110 nm. Aluminum electrodes were evaporated onto the polymer blend, and I–V characteristics were recorded in the dark and under simulated 1 sun AM 1.5 G radiation. Using a 1 : 4 weight ratio of polymer : PC[61]BM we obtained the highest PCE for polymer 5 of 0.64%. Further optimization of cells from 5 by depositing ca. 1 nm LiF layer before the Al cathode to improve charge injection, resulted in a PCE of 1.38%. Fig. 3 shows the I–V characteristics of this cell, and Table 2 summarizes the solar cell performance of all materials.

We also investigated the diode hole mobility (µh) in devices from 5 as a function of blending ratio by the space charge limited photocurrent method.40,41 We found µh to be 1.73 × 10−6 cm2V−1 s−1 in a 1 : 1 (by weight) blend of 5 PC[71]BM and 1.34 × 10−4 cm2V−1 s−1 for a 1 : 4 blend. The µh of the optimized blend of 5 compares well with the µh in P3HT : PC[61]BM 1 : 1 blends (optimal ratio for that system), which is typically ∼3 × 10−5 cm2V−1 s−1.42 As noted in other bulk heterojunction systems,25,40,43 we also observe that µh of neat films of 5 (∼ 2.9 × 10−6 cm2V−1 s−1) is lower than that of the optimal blend. Despite its higher field effect mobility, polymer 1 had a lower PCE than 5, possibly because the high mobility of 1 was achieved only after thermal annealing, yet when annealing the solar cells we did not observe a systematic trend of PCE improvement. Morphological changes including phase segregation of the blend and degradation of PEDOT interfaces might be occurring during annealing. Indeed, so far the best PCE results were obtained on solar cells that were not annealed. Furthermore, PCE is influenced by several factors and we are investigating details of charge transport, morphology and thermal annealing in our polymer : PCBM blends to gain a better understanding of these systems.

        ACTP-F
        copolymers may have limitations in solar cells due to low absorption coefficients (α). For example, films from 5 have α ≃ 1.6 × 104 cm−1 at 600 nm, compared to ca. 1.8 × 105 cm−1 for P3HT.44 By integrating the absorption spectrum of 5 : PC[61]BM blends (1 : 4 by weight), a theoretical maximum short-circuit current density of 6.4 mA cm−2 should be possible, compared with the 5.35 mA cm−2 that we already achieved. This implies that the device performance is close to its theoretical maximum, and is limited by its low absorption. We suspect this is due to weak coupling of the donor and acceptor, which may be improved by tuning the substituents and their locations.
In summary, we report new ACTP-F copolymers with a planar fused ring structure in the acceptor. These polymers showed high transistor mobility (µ ≃ 0.2 cm2V−1 s−1) and moderate solar cell performance (PCE 1.4%). The ACTP acceptor promotes lamellar crystalline structure when combined with linear alkyl chains in the fluorene and Mw ≃ 10kDa. Solar cell performance is promising, although fine-tuning to improve absorption coefficients is needed. All the above shows that there are many parameters available for tuning the performance of organic semiconductors in electronics and photovoltaics.
