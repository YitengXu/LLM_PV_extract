    , Accepted 6th January 2022First published on 8th January 2022AbstractThe two-step crystallization method for perovskite film fabrication has been recognized as an efficient process to obtain high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, many issues related to the as-prepared lead iodide (PbI2) film have often been reported. Here, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets with optimized width and thickness via a hydrothermal synthetic method were incorporated into the PbI2 precursor solution, functioning as nano-scaffolds to delay the quick nucleation process of PbI2 and expand the physical volume of the PbI2 film with a nanoporous skeleton morphology. As a result, the penetration of the organic iodide is greatly improved, leading to an optimized surface perovskite crystal orientation with substantially reduced residual stress and trap density. Finally, a champion power conversion efficiency of 22.50% was realized by the MoS2-treated PSCs with improved stability, maintaining 87% of the original performance after 1200 h of ambient storage, 89% of the original performance after 600 h of thermal aging, and 85.1% of the original performance after 73 h of light-soaking aging. This work provides a new way to regulate the two-step crystallization process for fabricating high-performance and stable planar PSCs.
1 Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies, have drawn great attention due to the excellent optoelectronic properties of perovskite absorbers, such as high absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime, high carrier mobility, and adjustable bandgap.1–3 The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the resulting PSCs has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 25.5% in recent decades, through optimizing the precursor components, layer interfaces, device architectures, etc.4–13 These research studies have shown that planar PSCs have advantages over traditional mesoporous architectures due to their low-temperature fabrication process, showing great prospects for large-scale commercialization.14,15 However, many reports stated that the perovskite film of planar PSCs fabricated by a two-step solution process is rough and contains lots of fractured grain boundaries.16,17 The rough surface of the perovskite film easily leads to poor contact with the hole transport layer. On the other hand, the fractured grain boundary contains many kinds of defect, such as dangling bonds caused by discontinuous crystallization on the surface, which can lead to the non-radiative recombination of carriers and decrease the device's final PCE.18,19 In addition, these problems in perovskite films caused by the imperfect crystallization process will also cause the stability of the device to deteriorate.20–26 Therefore, it is imperative to improve the quality of the perovskite crystal morphology prepared by the two-step method to obtain high-efficiency and stable planar PSCs.
The two-step sequential perovskite deposition process can be quite accessible compared to the one-step antisolvent method. A thin lead iodide (PbI2) layer is first deposited on the substrate. Then, formamidinium iodide (FAI: HC(NH2)2I) and methylammonium iodide (MAI: CH3NH3I) are applied to the predeposited PbI2 to enable a conversion to the perovskite phase. This process involves crystal nucleation and growth of the perovskite phase, which transforms from the solution phase to the solid state through the reaction between PbI2 and organic iodides.27–30 Since the sequential reaction of organic iodine with PbI2 occurs from the surface to the inner crystalline regions of PbI2, the PbI2 film usually works as the growth template for the sequentially deposited perovskite film. In other words, its surface morphology and inner structure can determine the crystal quality of the final perovskite film. Recently, two problems have been found for the sequential deposition process on planar substrates: one is the incomplete conversion of PbI2 and the other is the uncontrolled perovskite physical volume and surface morphology.31 During the deposition of the PbI2 film, the evaporation of DMF solvent and the self-assembly formation of the PbI2(DMSO)x complex are both spontaneous reaction processes that are difficult to control through the simple spin-coating and annealing process, resulting in different sizes of PbI2 crystals on the substrate.32,33 While the large-size crystals of PbI2 can greatly decrease the accessibility of the organic iodide to the inner lead sites resulting in the incomplete conversion of PbI2 to perovskite, small-size PbI2 crystals usually lead to perovskite crystal grains with fractured boundaries and internal defect states.34,35 Thus, it is imperative to develop a PbI2 film with an appropriate skeleton morphology to allow the penetration of the organic iodide. Furthermore, the PbI2 film as the growth template of the sequential deposition process should also promote the oriented growth of perovskite crystals with enhanced crystallinity through its surface and physical morphology.
Lots of efforts have been devoted to the improvement of the first-step PbI2 film in this sequential deposition process.36,37 To ensure the penetration of the organic iodide into PbI2, researchers mainly suggest replacing some PbI2 with other Pb-based alternatives, which can either loosen the structure of the PbI2 layer for easier cation insertion in the second step or reduce the residual PbI2 content in the final film. For example, Chen et al. introduced a small amount of PbCl2 with PbI2 into DMF, where the PbCl2 additive inhibited the crystallization of PbI2 to complete its conversion and controlled the resulting MAPbI3−xClx film morphology, resulting in an efficiency of 14%.38 To improve and regulate the crystallization of the final perovskite film using PbI2 as a growth template, many non-perovskite additives were added into PbI2 solutions. For example, Seok et al. introduced a controllable amount of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) into the PbI2 precursor, producing a PbI2(DMSO) growth template with capabilities for molecular exchange with FAI, producing a uniform and dense PbI2 film and a certified efficiency exceeding 20%.39 Nevertheless, there are hardly any reports on simultaneously optimizing the morphology of PbI2 as a growth substrate and promoting an effective penetration of the organic iodide. Thus, a simple method to control the morphology of PbI2 film through the new additive approach is urgently required.
Recently, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanomaterials, especially molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have received great attention from researchers due to their unique optical and electronic properties. MoS2 has several advantages, such as high carrier mobility that enables fast transport of the charges and a tunable work function depending on the number of layers.40–43 In addition, MoS2 is chemically inert with no dangling bonds on the layer surface and has excellent thermal stability.44 Presently, MoS2 has been applied in PSCs, mainly as a charge-transporting layer or dopant in these layers. Appropriate inorganic charge-transporting materials can greatly improve the stability and photovoltaic performance of PSCs.45,46 For example, Tang et al. employed solution-process van der Waals epitaxial growth of MAPbI3 on exfoliated MoS2 film to increase its crystallinity and improve the hole extraction rate at interfaces, reaching the best PCE of 20.55%.47 Jiang et al. developed a modified spiro-OMeTAD layer using MoS2 with a 2H semiconducting phase to improve hole mobility and deliver an enhanced PCE of 20.18%.48 These studies indicate that the size and morphology of the prepared MoS2 nanomaterials are directly related to the perovskite crystal growth and the performance of PSCs. As far as we know, most MoS2 nanomaterials used in these devices were prepared by the liquid exfoliation method. However, in the liquid exfoliation process it is usually very difficult to control the size distribution of the obtained nanomaterials.47–52 Thus, optimal device results with MoS2 treatment are often difficult to reproduce. Fortunately, with the help of a recently developed one-step hydrothermal synthetic method, controllable preparation of the specific morphology and size of TMDC nanomaterials can be realized.53 For example, the MoS2 nanosheets prepared in our previous work with different layers and sizes through changing the type of hydrothermal precursor and adjusting the reaction conditions can achieve considerable photoelectric catalytic performance.54 Therefore, compared to the liquid exfoliation method, size-tunable MoS2 prepared by the hydrothermal process through our strategies may be more suitable for the controllable processing and crystal growth of PSCs.
Here, MoS2 nanosheets with optimized thicknesses and sizes, e.g. 1.2 nm thickness and 215.3 nm width, were synthesized by the hydrothermal method and introduced into the PbI2 layer. MoS2 as a nano-scaffold can decelerate the fast crystallization reaction of PbI2 happening at the interface and expand the physical volume of the PbI2 skeleton film to give sufficient room for organic salts to penetrate, resulting in oriented growth of perovskite crystals around its film surface along the (110) lattice plane. Correspondingly, the film surface residual stress and its trap densities were substantially reduced. As a result, our PSCs fabricated through the two-step deposition process showed a champion PCE of 22.50%, with an impressive Jsc of 23.99 mA cm−2 and a high fill factor of 80.84%. Moreover, the treated PSCs exhibit improved storage stability over 1200 h, thermal stability over 600 h, and ambient light-soaking stability over 73 h. This work demonstrates an optimized crystallization process for the two-step deposition of the perovskite film to construct highly efficient PSCs.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization of MoS2 nanosheets
The MoS2 nanosheets mentioned below were prepared via a concise one-step hydrothermal reaction with hexaammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O14·4H2O) and sodium ethyl xanthate (C2H5OC(S)SNa) as precursor materials, as shown in our previous work.55 First, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra are used to identify the crystal structure of the as-synthesized MoS2 nanomaterial powder, as presented in Fig. S1.† The diffraction peaks at 14.3°, 28.9°, 32.6°, 39.5°, and 58.3° are affiliated to the (002), (004), (100), (103), and (110) planes of 2H-MoS2 (PDF Card no. 37-1492), respectively. As seen from the unsharp peaks, the as-prepared MoS2 samples exhibit a weak crystalline structure, indicating that the products are amorphous MoS2 nanomaterials.56 Next, the as-synthesized MoS2 products can be separated into different thicknesses and sizes of MoS2 nanosheets through a gradient centrifugal process. The MoS2 products centrifuged at 3000, 6000, and 9000 rpm are abbreviated as MoS2-3000, MoS2-6000, and MoS2-9000 nanosheets, correspondingly. Atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements are performed to examine the morphology of the MoS2 nanosheet samples, as displayed in Fig. S2.† The thickness and width of MoS2-3000 nanosheets are about 9.5 nm and 63.5 nm, while the thickness and width of MoS2-6000 nanosheets are 1.2 nm and 215.3 nm, and the thickness and width of MoS2-9000 nanosheets are 0.79 nm and 92.9 nm, respectively. In addition, since the bandgap (Eg) of MoS2 is layer-dependent, the dimensions of the prepared MoS2 can be estimated by measuring its Eg value.57–59 Thus, Tauc plots of these samples calculated from optical absorption spectra are displayed in Fig. S3 and S4.† The Eg values of MoS2-3000, MoS2-6000, and MoS2-9000 nanosheets are 1.30, 1.41, and 1.90 eV, respectively, indicating that these MoS2 samples have different thicknesses consistent with the AFM results. Through this hydrothermal method and gradient separation process, MoS2 nanosheets with different thicknesses and sizes, named MoS2-3000, MoS2-6000, and MoS2-9000, have been successfully prepared. The following discussion will focus on the effect of these nanomaterials as new additives in the formation of the PbI2 skeleton layer and the crystallization process of the final perovskite film.
2.2 Intercalation of MoS2 as a nano-scaffold into the first-step PbI2 skeleton layer
The perovskite film is fabricated through a two-step crystallization process, where the perovskite precursor solutions involving PbI2 and the organic iodide are deposited by spin-coating sequentially. However, when the pre-annealed PbI2 layer (mainly composed of PbI2(DMSO)x) is immersed in organic iodide solution (FAI/MAI), the FAI/MAI molecules first undergo ionic interactions with PbI2, resulting in a rapid perovskite crystallization reaction at the surface region of the PbI2 layer. As a result, the organic iodides usually have difficulty in penetrating into the inner crystalline regions of PbI2 to complete the conversion to the perovskite phase, leaving unreacted PbI2 at the bottom and a rough perovskite crystal morphology at the top surface for two-step crystallization (Fig. 1a).60–62 To address this issue by a new approach, we introduce MoS2 nanosheets into the PbI2 precursor solution, as shown in Fig. 1b, to obtain a well-crystallized (CsPbI3)x(FAPbI3)y(MAPbBr3)1−x−y perovskite film from sequential deposition. From previous reports, MoS2 can induce high-quality crystal growth of perovskite films and promote effective carrier transport in PSCs.63,64 In our work, MoS2 nanosheets mainly function as nano-scaffolds to expand the physical volume of the PbI2 skeleton, which facilitates the penetration of the organic iodide into the inner crystalline region, correspondingly decelerating the quick reaction or crystallization process of the perovskite at the surface area, and finally promoting the complete conversion of the underlying PbI2 layer.

To study the interaction between MoS2 and perovskite, we applied density functional theory (DFT) to simulate the in situ chemical bonding effect between MoS2 nanosheets and MAPbI3. Fig. 1c and d display the optimized geometrical structure and charge density differences of MoS2 nanosheets coupled with the perovskite (001) surface model. The charge density distribution plots reveal that no obvious charge transfer occurs between the MoS2 and perovskite in the optimized stable geometrical model, suggesting that no direct chemical bonding between MoS2 and perovskite should be observed while van der Waals interactions are more likely to exist between them. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to analyze these processes as shown in Fig. 1e and f, and Table S1.† Here, the MoS2-6000 (0.043 mg mL−1, optimal modifying dose) modified perovskite film along with the control sample was applied for this XPS measurement. After incorporating the MoS2 nanosheets into the perovskite, both Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2, and I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2 peaks move to high binding energy values, which suggests the presence of additional negative charge around Pb and I atoms. This could be attributed to the transformation of the surface detected uncoordinated Pb atoms to the coordinated Pb2+ ions, through bonding with the uncoordinated I− ions after MoS2 treatment. Moreover, a relative increase in the electron affinity of I atoms could be caused by the increased concentration of coordinated I− ions compared to that of control films.65–67 This promoted conversion of free-state Pb/I atoms to Pb–I bonding connections can be regarded to be a result of the reduced bond length.68 Besides, even after multiple film etchings, no elemental signal related to MoS2 was detected in the modifying samples. A possible explanation can be that the optimal MoS2 amount is far below the detection limit of the instrument. However, these data are sufficient to reveal that there is no chemical bonding, while van der Waals interactions are more likely to exist between the as-prepared MoS2 molecule and perovskite, consistent with DFT calculation results. Furthermore, there is no direct chemical bonding between MoS2 and PbI2, indicating that the size of MoS2 nanosheets would be the main factor determining the structure of the PbI2 skeleton.
To clarify the relationship between the size of MoS2 additives and the morphology of the modified PbI2 film, we compared the properties of the films modified by MoS2-3000, MoS2-6000, and MoS2-9000 with those obtained from a conventional process. The results are mainly presented by top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of these films, as shown in Fig. 2 and S5.† The bare PbI2 layer is naturally dense and compact, as presented in Fig. 2a and b. After introducing the MoS2 additives, the morphology of the PbI2 film substantially changes. For the MoS2-3000 modified samples in Fig. S5a–c,† the SEM results show that there are wrinkles and a few pores on the surface of the PbI2 film. Furthermore, the upper part of the PbI2 film section has a compact morphology while the bottom presents a porous structure. A possible reason is that the MoS2-3000 nanosheets possess a relatively large size (9.5 nm thickness and 63.5 nm width) and mainly precipitate in the bottom part of the PbI2 layer during their film formation process. Thus, unexpected delamination occurs at the corresponding perovskite section (Fig. S5c†).69 For the MoS2-9000 modified films, the nanoporous structure inside the PbI2 film section is unevenly distributed, leading to lots of unwanted pores inside the perovskite film (Fig. S5f†). This may be due to the size of MoS2-9000 being too small to change the spontaneous crystallization process of PbI2, but its existence has disturbed the uniform crystallization of the perovskite film. In contrast, in Fig. 2d and e, the PbI2 film modified with a suitable size of MoS2-6000 presents a desirable skeleton structure, in which the nanoporous structure is uniformly distributed on both the surface and inside the PbI2 film, thus promoting the homogeneous crystallization of the perovskite film. Therefore, the effective control of the PbI2 film structure is mainly due to the controllable size of MoS2 additives prepared by the chemical hydrothermal method. It is also important to note that an initial PbI2 film with a thickness of ∼472 nm was expanded to ∼585 nm for the PbI2 film modified by MoS2-6000 (Fig. 2b and e), which means that a considerable volume expansion occurs after the MoS2 nano-scaffolds are intercalated into the PbI2 skeleton. In addition, after the insertion of the organic iodide into the PbI2 layer, a change in thickness was also observed in MoS2-6000 modified perovskite films as shown in Fig. 2c and f. The MoS2-6000 modified perovskite film is about 46 nm thicker than the control, which can be attributed to the modified PbI2 skeleton being more conducive to the penetration of organic cations. So, more of the inner crystalline PbI2 can be transformed into the perovskite phase, resulting in expanded physical volume and layer thickness.70 Conclusively, although MoS2 additives with sizes of MoS2-3000 and MoS2-9000 can affect the PbI2 film structure, only MoS2-6000 modification can obtain a desirable nanoporous skeleton structure in PbI2 for the effective penetration of the organic iodide and the homogeneous growth of perovskite crystal morphology.

2.3 Oriented growth of the perovskite film based on the MoS2 modification process
To examine the morphological information of the perovskite film surface, top-view SEM and AFM images of these samples with or without MoS2 modification were acquired, as presented in Fig. 3a, b, d, and e, and S6a, b, d, and e.† Compared to the control samples, the perovskite film modified by MoS2-6000 nanosheets exhibits a more compact and uniform structure with enlarged grain size. For MoS2-3000 modified films (Fig. S6a†), lots of pinholes have been created at the grain boundaries along with an enlarged grain size. This may be due to the unexpected delamination of perovskite crystals at their grain boundaries caused by the vertically inhomogeneous PbI2 film. On the other hand, the MoS2-9000 modified films have reduced perovskite grain size compared to the control samples (Fig. S6d†). This may be attributed to the uneven distribution of the nanoporous structure within the PbI2 film leading to a high concentration of perovskite nucleation sites, which would speed up the crystallization rate and lead to a heterogeneous perovskite film formation process. Therefore, compared with the control, MoS2-3000, and MoS2-9000 samples, the grain morphology of the perovskite film based on MoS2-6000 modified PbI2 is significantly optimized. To be more precise, the corresponding statistics of perovskite grain size for these SEM images are calculated in Fig. S7.† Upon applying the MoS2-6000 modification process, the average grain size increased from 700 nm for the control samples to 990 nm for the MoS2-modified samples. A more homogeneous grain distribution is also obtained for the MoS2-modified sample. Additionally, from the corresponding top-view AFM images, the average surface roughness of the MoS2-6000 modified perovskite film (root mean square (RMS): 30.9 nm) is reduced compared to that of the others (32 nm for the control, 33.8 nm for MoS2-3000, and 40.9nm for MoS2-9000), indicating that the perovskite film obtained through the MoS2-6000 modification process is smoother, and the fracture existing in the surface of crystal grains is reduced. Therefore, compared with the MoS2-3000 or MoS2-9000 modification process, only the MoS2-6000 treatment can make the surface morphology of the perovskite film more compact and uniform with enlarged grains, which is precisely achieved by the controllable size of MoS2 additives prepared through the chemical hydrothermal method. Conclusively, the MoS2-6000 nano-scaffold treatment shows an excellent control of the surface morphology of the final perovskite film.
 Fig. 3  Top-view SEM images (a and d), AFM images (b and e), and GIWAXS patterns (c and f) of the perovskite films. 
To clarify the modifying effect of MoS2 on the perovskite crystal growth in depth, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were conducted on the corresponding perovskite film, as presented in Fig. 3c and f, and S6c and f.† The GIWAXS patterns of the samples reveal strong diffraction rings at qxy = 10 nm−1, corresponding to the (110) crystal planes of perovskite. However, the intensity distribution ranges of the (110) lattice plane are at azimuthal angles of 90° and near 30–45° in the control, MoS2-3000, and MoS2-9000 samples at qxy = 10 nm−1. As we know, only the diffraction intensity appearing at an azimuthal angle of 90° at qxy = 10 nm−1 represents oriented growth of the perovskite (110) crystal plane along the qz direction.71 In contrast, the intensity distribution range at qxy = 10 nm−1 for MoS2-6000 modified perovskite films only appears at an azimuthal angle of 90°, and shows substantially increased intensity compared to that of the other films. Therefore, the data above uncovered that the MoS2-6000 treatment preferentially promoted an optimized crystal orientation on the surface of the perovskite films. In other words, the MoS2-6000 modified PbI2 skeleton film can promote the growth of perovskite crystals around the film surface along the (110) crystal plane effectively, thus leading to a uniform and enlarged grain size of the perovskite film. The mechanism is that the MoS2-6000 modified porous PbI2 film assists the diffusion and penetration of the organic salt molecules effectively, resulting in the formation of a uniformly distributed nucleus of perovskite. During the thermal annealing process, the nucleus can rearrange and coalesce via the Ostwald ripening process to attain thermodynamic stability owing to the surface energy minimization, which results in an increased crystal growth rate and optimized crystal orientation.72,73 Therefore, the sequential crystallization process can be effectively optimized by adjusting the controllable size of MoS2 nanosheets contained in the PbI2 solution. Conclusively, due to the difference in the size of MoS2 nanosheets, only the MoS2-6000 nano-scaffold treatment achieves homogeneous crystallization of the perovskite film with optimized crystal orientation.
To further investigate the influence of the MoS2 modifying treatment on the crystallinity of perovskite films, the corresponding surface residual stress in these films was measured. The residual stress in perovskite thin films was proven to be thermal stress that was balanced within multiple grains.74 To measure the average intensity of such stress, XRD and the sin2ψ–2θ method were applied.75 There typically exists biaxial residual stress (Φ = 0 and 90° orientations, corresponding to the lateral and longitudinal residual stress) in solution-processed perovskite films.76,77 First, the XRD full spectrum of each film at Φ = 90° is shown in Fig. 4a. Among these samples, all results display the same diffraction peaks at specific X-ray incidence angles, manifesting the unitary cubic perovskite phase with high crystallinity.78,79 The (012) lattice plane is chosen to calculate the lattice parameter since its highest multiplication factor contains more crystallization information as reported.74 The magnified (012) lattice plane diffraction peaks at different instrument tilt angles (ψ) in both biaxial residual stress orientations (Φ = 0 and 90°) for the control, MoS2-3000, MoS2-6000, and MoS2-9000 modified films are shown in Fig. 4b–e, S8, and S9.† The diffraction angle of the (012) lattice plane in the control sample is shifted to lower values as the ψ value increases at both Φ = 0 (Fig. 4b) and Φ = 90° (Fig. 4c), which means that the crystal lattice spacing along the in-plane direction is smaller than that in the out-of-plane direction, indicating the existence of in-plane tensile stress along with out-of-plane compressive stress in control films. After the MoS2-6000 nanosheet modifying treatments, there is a negligible shift of diffraction peak positions observed here, especially compared to that of the control, MoS2-3000 (Fig. S8†) and MoS2-9000 (Fig. S9†) modified films. These data manifested that the surface residual stress and the cylindrical symmetry of residual stress in the surface was reduced after the modification with MoS2-6000. Therefore, compared to the control, all these MoS2 treatments can have an effect on reducing the surface tensile stress of the final perovskite film, but the MoS2-6000 modification treatment has the best effect among them.

To quantitatively analyze the intensity of surface residual stress in these perovskite films, we calculated it using the following equation, where dΦψ is the interplanar spacing calculated from the peak position, d0 is the equilibrium interplanar spacing of (012) planes, E is Young's modulus (10 GPa), ν is Poisson's ratio along the (012) direction (0.3) and σΦ is the residual stress in the Φ direction.75,80–82 (1)
Thus, when plotting the d spacing of (012) planes (d012) against the sin2ψ value, the slope of the fitted line is proportional to the residual stress value. Also, the positive slope means an in-plane tensile residual stress and the stress is more intense as the slope increases. It can be inferred that the residual stress in all these samples is tensile. The results are as shown in Fig. 4f and g, and S10a and b;† the fitting lines of the MoS2-6000 modified film show the lowest positive slope compared to that of the control, MoS2-3000, and MoS2-9000 modified films, suggesting a significant decrease in biaxial residual stress after the film's modification with MoS2-6000 nanosheets. The corresponding specific film biaxial σR values were estimated from these d012–sin2ψ data. All results are presented in Fig. 4h. The lateral and longitudinal stresses of biaxial residual stress are 43.49 and 46.69 MPa for the control, 35.78 and 32.15 MPa for the MoS2-3000 modified film, 23.29 and 23.28 MPa for the MoS2-6000 modified film, and 37.61 and 41.23 MPa for the MoS2-9000 modified film, respectively. The residual stress σR for the MoS2 modified samples is substantially reduced compared to the control. In particular, the perovskite film modified with MoS2-6000 nanosheets shows the lowest biaxial residual stress. Besides, its residual stress values at Φ = 0 (lateral) and Φ = 90° (longitudinal) are nearly equal in the same sample with a deviation of less than 10%, indicating no shear stress in the MoS2-6000 modified perovskite films. Also, reduced residual stress in the surface region means that the lattice distortion of perovskite crystals has been mitigated.74,83 To intuitively explain the results related to the control and MoS2-6000 modified film formation process, a schematic illustration for the proposed mechanism is presented in Fig. 4i. The expanded physical volume of the MoS2-6000 modified PbI2 skeleton layer effectively delivers the organic iodide into the inner PbI2 region to allow the transformation of the inner PbI2 region into the perovskite phase with an expanded structure volume, which creates compressive stress (σc) inside the film to offset the surface residual tensile stress (σR). Meanwhile, this process substantially delays the quick perovskite crystallization process at the surface of PbI2, which also promotes the reduction of surface residual tensile stress compared to that of the control. All these improvements relieve the lattice extrusion and distortion existing in the sequentially deposited crystal's nucleation and growth process. Furthermore, the reduction of surface residual stress could also lead to a decrease in the defect density and an increase in the carrier mobility in the perovskite film, which would enhance the chemical stability of perovskite films and improve the photoelectrical performance for PSCs.84,85 Conclusively, compared to the control and other MoS2 treatments, the MoS2-6000 treatment realizes a homogeneous crystallization process of the perovskite crystal and eliminates the surface residual stress of the film effectively.
2.4 Device performance of PSCs based on MoS2 modifying treatment
After investigating the morphology and crystallization process of these perovskite films, we fabricated perovskite solar cells to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the devices based on MoS2 modifying treatment. The architecture of the device is FTO/SnO2/perovskite-MoS2/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, as shown in Fig. 5a. The corresponding cross-sectional images of the devices are shown in Fig. 5b. To optimize the performance of the MoS2-modified devices, PSCs modified with different amounts of MoS2 nanosheets separated through the gradient centrifugal process were fabricated and tested. The corresponding results are displayed in Fig. S11–13 and Table S2.† As shown in Fig. S14,† the optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) for MoS2-3000, MoS2-6000, and MoS2-9000 modified champion PSCs is 21.51%, 22.50%, and 21.14%, respectively. Therefore, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs with the MoS2 modifying treatment is better than that of control devices (19.51%).

Among these devices, the MoS2-6000 modified PSCs show a significant improvement in PCE of 22.50%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.99 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.16 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 80.84%. The forward scan of the same device shows a PCE of 21.37% with negligible hysteresis as displayed in Fig. S15.† The detailed photovoltaic parameters are displayed in Table S3.† As compared with the control devices in Fig. 5c, the significant improvement in the MoS2-6000 modified device performance is mainly attributed to the higher Voc (an increase from 1.10 to 1.16 V), Jsc (an increase from 23.48 to 23.99 mA cm−2), and FF (an increase from 75.53% to 80.84%). This could be attributed to the uniform crystallization of perovskite crystal films with improved quality promoted by the MoS2-6000 treatment. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and integrated current density (Jsc) of the corresponding devices are presented in Fig. 5d. The integrated Jsc is 23.63 mA cm−2 in agreement with the Jsc obtained from J–V curves (23.99 mA cm−2). Interestingly, the EQE spectral response of the MoS2-6000 modified PSCs has increased from 807.73 nm to 840.19 nm. The same observation can also be made from the UV-Vis (Fig. 6a) and photoluminescence results (Fig. 6b), which can be attributed to either below bandgap absorption or indirect bandgap absorption promoted by the increased layer thickness of MoS2-6000 modified perovskite films.86–96 In addition, Fig. 5e shows the stabilized PCE of the MoS2-6000 modified and control devices measured at their fixed maximum power point (MPP) voltage, respectively. After exposure to continuous one-sun illumination for 200 s, the MoS2-6000 modified devices can still maintain a steady-state Jsc of 21.09 mA cm−2, corresponding to a stabilized PCE of 21.52%, which is much higher than that of the control devices (18.86%). The PCE diagram based on the MoS2-6000 nanosheet modified and control devices for a total of 20 devices is summarized in Fig. 5f. The MoS2-6000 nanosheet modified devices show enhanced device reproducibility. Therefore, to clearly reveal the performance improvement resulting from MoS2 treatment of PSC devices, the following electrical properties testing of samples will mainly focus on control and MoS2-6000 treatments. In sum, compared to the control devices, the devices based on the modification of MoS2-6000 nano-scaffolds achieve a notable improvement in photovoltaic performance and reproducibility.

We clarified the inherent mechanism behind the superior photovoltaic performance in MoS2-6000 nanosheet modified devices. First, to verify the photophysics of these perovskite films, the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the control perovskite film and the perovskite film modified with MoS2-6000 were measured (shown in Fig. 6a), and the results confirmed that the perovskite thin films exhibit strong absorption from the visible range down to near-infrared wavelengths. Moreover, the inset plot revealed that the absorption onset is increased from 805 to 827 nm after the MoS2-6000 treatment, indicating that the MoS2-6000 additive can promote a red-shift of the optical absorption spectrum, consistent with EQE results. Second, to investigate non-radiative recombination, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these films deposited on glass substrates were recorded (shown in Fig. 6b). The perovskite film based on MoS2-6000 modifying treatment achieves the highest emission intensity, which means that carrier non-radiative recombination is effectively reduced and the defects are eliminated. Also, a redshift of PL peaks can be observed, showing the same trend as for the EQE and absorption results. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay transient spectra were also applied to investigate the charge transfer performance of these perovskite films deposited on a SnO2 substrate, as presented in Fig. 5c. The TRPL spectra can be well fitted using a triexponential fitting model, and the detailed fitting information is listed in Table S4.† The MoS2-6000 modified perovskite films displayed an average decay lifetime of 77.98 ns, which is lower than that of the control films (180.69 ns). The lowered carrier lifetime represents the improved charge extraction performance at the MoS2-6000 modified perovskite interfaces, contributing to the enhancement of the device's Voc.
To confirm the change of defect states or trap densities in the perovskite film related to the PSCs, first, electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurement was carried out to identify the charge transfer properties at the device interface or inside the perovskite, as presented in Fig. 6d. The fitting equivalent circuit of the PSCs is displayed in Fig. S16 and corresponding data are shown in Table S5.† After the MoS2-6000 modifying treatment, the series resistance (Rs) has decreased (from 133.8 Ω to 39.4 Ω) while the recombination resistance (Rrec) has increased (from 878.2 kΩ to 1831 kΩ), which indicates that this MoS2 treatment enhances the carrier extraction from the active layer to the transporting layer, and the carrier recombination resistance has increased apparently due to the suppressed defects or traps. Second, space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement was carried out to quantitatively estimate the electron and hole trap densities for the control and MoS2-6000 modified perovskite films, as presented in Fig. 6e and f. The electron-only devices were fabricated as FTO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag, while the hole-only devices were constructed as FTO/NiOx/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. As expected, by applying the MoS2-6000 modifying treatment, the electron trap densities are reduced from 1.84 × 1015 cm−3 for the control samples to 1.13 × 1015 cm−3 for the modified films. Correspondingly, the hole trap concentration is significantly decreased from 2.69 × 1015 cm−3 in the control samples to 1.84 × 1015 cm−3 in the modified ones. The lower electron and hole trap densities in the MoS2-6000 modified perovskite indicate that the treatment can effectively reduce the defects inside the perovskite film, contributing to the enhancement of the device's Voc. In addition, MoS2 semiconductor nanomaterials possess high charge mobility, which can carry out efficient charge transfer with the perovskite. To identify this, Fig. 6g shows the plane-averaged charge density difference of the optimal DFT model (Fig. 1d) along the Z direction. The positive values indicate electron accumulation and the negative values represent electron depletion.97,98 In our calculation results, the presence of different charge effects can be observed on both sides of the interfaces between MoS2 nanosheets and the perovskite, which is helpful for the separation of electrons and holes. All these observations indicate that the MoS2-6000 modifying treatment can passivate defects and reduce the trap densities of the final perovskite film, promoting efficient charge extraction from the absorber to the transporting layers, resulting in high photovoltaic performance.
Consequently, an improved crystalline morphology with reduced surface residual stress for the perovskite film can be achieved through this oriented crystal growth process with the help of MoS2-6000 nano-scaffolds, thereby reducing the defect concentration of the perovskite crystals. All these advancements eventually result in the significant promotion of photovoltaic performance.
2.5 Long-term and thermal stability of PSCs
Apart from efficiency, stability is also an important parameter in evaluating device performance. To investigate the potential of these PSCs in real applications, long-term stability and thermal stability testing was performed. All samples were stored in the dark to eliminate the light degradation effect on perovskite materials, and the device performance test process was carried out in ambient air (Rh = 30 ± 5%, T = 25 °C).99 In the long-term stability testing of PSCs, the unencapsulated PSCs in ambient air were aged at 30 ± 5% Rh at around 25 °C for 1200 h, as shown in Fig. 7a. Our device modified by MoS2-6000 can still retain 87% of its initial efficiency, which is much higher than that of the control devices with an efficiency retention of 62%. This can be ascribed to the fact that the MoS2 nano-scaffolds facilitate an efficient penetration of the organic iodide into the PbI2 skeleton, resulting in the compact and low roughness surface of the MoS2-6000 modified perovskite layer with reduced film defects, thus promoting close contact between all the layers and efficiently inhibiting water intrusion into the devices. Next, for the thermal stability testing, PSCs without encapsulation were aged on 85 °C hotplates in a nitrogen glovebox (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm) for 600 h, as presented in Fig. 7b. Here, our device based on MoS2-6000 treatment can retain 89% of its initial efficiency, while the control device can only retain 64% of its initial performance. This result shows the effectiveness of the MoS2-6000 treatment in improving the perovskite quality with substantially improved thermal stability. Since MoS2 nanosheets have been reported to possess high heat resistance, this modifying process together with the dense and uniform film can increase the thermal stability of perovskite itself.100,101 Lastly, for the light soaking stability testing, PSCs without encapsulation were aged under AM 1.5 G illumination with proper air cooling in ambient air (Rh = 30 ± 5%) for 73 h, as presented in Fig. 7c. Here, our device based on MoS2-6000 treatment can retain 85.1% of its initial efficiency, while the control device can only retain 52% of its initial performance. The enhanced photostability can be a result of the suppression of ion defects by the effectiveness of the MoS2-6000 treatment in improving the perovskite crystal quality. Consequently, there is a significant improvement of stability originating from this homogeneous perovskite crystallization process due to incorporation of MoS2-6000 nano-scaffolds into the PbI2 skeleton film.

3 Conclusion
In conclusion, MoS2 nanosheets with controllable sizes (e.g. MoS2-3000, MoS2-6000 and MoS2-9000) were synthesized by a chemical hydrothermal method and introduced into the PbI2 layer during the sequential deposition process of the perovskite film. First, the unexpected delamination of the perovskite film was observed for the MoS2-3000 modified PbI2 film due to its lack of porous structure. Second, an unevenly distributed nanoporous structure was found in the MoS2-9000 modified PbI2 film which led to lots of unwanted pores inside the perovskite film. It was only for the MoS2-6000 treatment that a desirable PbI2 skeleton layer with a uniformly distributed nanoporous structure both on the surface and inside its bulk was realized. In this case, MoS2-6000 with a suitable size can function as a nano-scaffold and intercalate into the PbI2 skeleton layer to expand its physical volume and provide an efficient pathway for the organic iodide to penetrate into the inner region of the PbI2 layer. Moreover, MoS2-6000 can also delay the quick crystallization reaction of the perovskite at the surface region, thus converting more inner PbI2 components to the perovskite phase with oriented growth and high crystal-phase purity. Benefiting from this, greatly reduced surface residual stress and decreased trap densities are also realized. Therefore, these advancements achieve a great improvement both in device performance and stability. As a result, the optimized device shows an encouraging PCE of 22.50% with increasing Voc (from 1.10 to 1.16 V), Jsc (from 23.48 to 23.99 mA cm−2), and FF (from 75.53% to 80.84%). Furthermore, the long-term, thermal, and ambient light-soaking stability of the devices is greatly improved owing to the highly crystalline morphology of the perovskite film provided by the MoS2-6000 treatment. In short, by employing controllable sizes of TMDC nanomaterials as additives to modify the two-step crystallization process of the perovskite film, substantial improvements in both efficiency and stability are observed for PSCs, taking these perovskite photovoltaic devices one step closer to practical application and commercialization.
