We report a co-deposited Al2O3–perovskite device annealed in under 2.5 seconds with a PCE of 10.0% compared to 10.9% for a 45 minute oven-annealed device.
Introduction
Solid-state organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells have recently been the subject of intense study owing to their low material cost and high performance.1 The path to these devices has spanned over two decades, beginning with Grätzel and O'Regan's work on sensitized colloidal TiO2 films leading to their widely-cited paper describing high efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) in 1991.2 Since then, work on improving molecular sensitizers, redox electrolytes and other cell components has seen DSC power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) increase to 13%.3 In 1998, Bach et al. published findings on solid-state hole transport materials4 as an alternative to the aggressive liquid electrolyte used in DSCs. Solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ss-DSCs) have since reached PCEs of 7.2% (ref. 5) using the solid organic molecule 2-7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as a hole transporter.
In 2009, Kojima et al. reported on organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites as a sensitizer akin to the dye in liquid DSCs with PCEs of up to 3.81%.6 These CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorbers were quickly matched with the spiro-OMeTAD hole transporter in 2012 by Kim et al.,7 and Lee et al.,8 achieving a PCE of over 10%. 2013 saw PCEs for perovskite cells reach 15.4% in a vapour-deposited device with no porous scaffold.9
Unlike DSCs and s-DSCs where dye molecules are adsorbed onto a metal oxide scaffold surface at room temperature, in perovskite solar cells the light absorbing material is activated by crystallisation upon thermal annealing. Typically, lab-scale perovskite devices are fabricated onto glass substrates coated with a layer of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as well as a compact layer of TiO2 (c-TiO2) to act as an electron collection layer.
A porous scaffold material may also be sintered to the c-TiO2 to increase surface area and improve charge injection. Historically, this layer consisted of a mesoporous network of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (m-TiO2). However, Lee et al. demonstrated that a mesoporous network of insulating Al2O3 nanoparticles may also yield high PCEs.8 In this case, electron transfer is facilitated entirely through the perovskite material itself, rather than slower transport through the m-TiO2 network. Work by this research group has shown that improvements to device performance can be achieved by simply adding Al2O310 and SiO211 nanoparticles to the perovskite precursor solution. The use of this single step deposition technique can remove the need for a discrete, separately deposited, scaffold layer.
Typically for device preparation, a solution containing CH3NH3I and a lead halide salt (PbCl2, PbI2 or PbBr2) dissolved in DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) is deposited onto the substrate through spin coating, followed by a heat treatment at T > 100 °C12 to evaporate residual solvent from the film, as well as to control the crystallisation of the perovskite material. Typically the annealing process takes between 5 to 120 minutes7,8,13–18 to achieve optimal crystallisation and this can be carried out in multiple or ramped stages.19,20 This lengthy process poses a potential bottleneck to the large-scale manufacture of perovskite solar cells on an industrial scale and is relatively unpredictable in terms of performance when performed under ambient conditions.
In this work, we present an alternative method of post-annealing perovskite films which reduces the time required to as little as 2.5 seconds whilst maintaining high PCEs. This was achieved by exposing the freshly deposited perovskite film to a short burst of near-infrared (NIR) radiation using commercially available NIR lamps. The NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum is situated between the visible and the infrared with wavelengths ranging from 700 nm to 2500 nm, peaking at 1000 nm. NIR sintering of porous TiO2 films has already been demonstrated for use in DSCs21,22 and much like the TiO2 precusor paste used to make DSCs the perovskite precursor solution has a relatively low absorbance in these wavelengths, as does the c-TiO2 layer beneath it. FTO absorbs NIR radiation far more readily, causing it to rapidly heat under irradiation.23 This fast heating of the FTO layer, combined with the relative transparency of the perovskite film to NIR radiation allows for rapid, indirect annealing of the device's active material. The absorption spectrum of FTO coated glass and constituents of the active layer (spin coated onto the glass) are shown in Fig. 1. The solvent (DMF) and perovskite precursors can be seen to overlay the FTO glass across the NIR region suggesting no additional contribution. Also shown in Fig. 1 is the NIR lamp irradiance at 80% power. Fig. 2 illustrates the transmission of NIR radiation through the wet perovskite precursor compared to conventional annealing in a hot air oven.

Experimental
Samples were prepared by spin-coating a solution containing 0.25 mM titanium(IV) isopropoxide in ethanol onto 3 mm thick FTO (sheet resistance 7 Ω □−1, Ra 12 nm) glass. The substrate was heated at 500 °C to sinter the c-TiO2 leaving a 50 nm layer. A mixed halide (CH3NH3PbI3−XClX) perovskite precursor was prepared in DMF with a 5 wt% Al2O3 nanoparticle addition as described elsewhere.10 The precursor was deposited in a single process onto the glass using spin-coating and was annealed under various NIR intensities and durations to give a film thickness of between 450–500 nm. The NIR equipment (Adphos Coil Lab LV2, tungsten filament halogen lamps) has an output spectrum in the region of 250–2500 nm, peaking between 800 and 1200 nm as can be seen in Fig 1 as well as elsewhere.24,25 At maximum power the lamps have a power density of 250 kW m−2. The lamp to sample separation is maintained at 10 cm throughout the experiment. The NIR output was controlled by varying the percentage lamp power and the duration for which samples were exposed to the radiation was controlled by varying the speed of a conveyor system passing beneath the lamp.
Samples were annealed at lamp power levels ranging from 55% to 85% at 5% increments. At each level, sample exposure time was gradually decreased by iteratively increasing the conveyor speed by 0.5 m minute−1; the total length of the NIR active region was 0.4 m. Samples were characterised by extracting RGB (red, green, blue) colour values from images taken of the samples under a calibrated light source. Fig. 3 demonstrates a series of samples imaged under the consistent light. Once annealed, a solution containing spiro-OMeTAD and additives (tBP and Li-TFSI) was deposited (200 nm) onto the annealed perovskite layer and capped with a gold contact evaporated at 10−4 torr.

Right: sampled RGB values for different conveyer speeds at different lamp power outputs for the sample's center and corners. Red lines indicate the optimal conveyer speed for each power level based upon the homogeneity of the sample's colour. 
Top view electron imaging analyses of NIR and oven annealed samples were collected using a JSM-7800F field emission gun electron microscope from Jeol (USA), with a 12 kV beam, 10 μA at approximately 6 mm working distance. X-ray diffraction analyses of the crystalline properties of the annealed films were carried out using a D8 Discover instrument from Bruker (Germany) with a CuKα beam at 40 kV and 40 mA and scan parameters of 0.1 s per step at 0.01° 2θ step size.
Results and discussion

Fig. 3 shows that upon exposure to heat perovskite films undergo a change in colour spreading inwards from the corners. This effect may be a result of film thickness inconsistencies due to the spin coating process, however, it seems more likely that the edges of the glass heat more rapidly than the center due to the poor thermal conductivity of air compared to that of glass.
The yellow discolouration in the longest exposed sample (Fig. 3, sample A) was thought to be the result of PbI2 formation due to overheating.17,26 Conversely, the transparent region in the least exposed sample (Fig. 3, sample F) was a result of incomplete solvent evaporation. We hypothesised that the optimal annealing parameters would be the ones that yielded the most homogeneously coloured sample; in the case of Fig. 3, sample E would be optimal.
Using image analysis software, the RGB colour values of the sample's center and corners (averaged value of 4 corners) were sampled so as to visually represent the degree of colour homogeneity. These values are seen in Fig. 3 with the red lines representing the optimal power and exposure parameters.
Once a trend between optimal NIR parameters and sample homogeneity had been established, full devices were fabricated using the NIR oven to anneal the perovskite light absorber at different speeds. NIR lamp power was fixed at 85% for this investigation, a power density approximately equal to 50 W cm−2. In addition, oven annealed devices were also made. The results of an analysis of the JV data produced is seen in Fig. 4. Overall the oven annealed devices show higher PCEs compared to NIR counterparts owing to increased VOC and fill factor. However, JSC appeared consistently higher in the NIR samples compared to the oven annealed counterparts. It can also be seen that whilst short-circuit current appears to be consistent with different exposure times, open-circuit voltage and fill factor are more sensitive to change. VOC and fill factor appear to increase up to exposure times of 2.47 s, after which a decrease is seen on account of resistive losses caused by incomplete crystallisation and solvent removal. Pockets of trapped solvent at the perovskite–spiro interface may also be thought to induce recombination losses, hence the lower fill factor. Fig. 4 illustrates that small fluctuations in annealing time can lead to changes in PCE. In upscaling this can be addressed by optimisation and expansion of the process window. Increased exposure duration whilst maintaining total energy density can be achieved by lowering the lamp output. The highest performing devices annealed using both oven and NIR have their JV curves shown in Fig. 5, both reaching PCEs ≥ 10%. Using infra-red thermal imaging, the temperature of the FTO layer immediately after NIR exposure was found to be approximately 200 °C for the 2.47 s exposed sample.

Further materials characterisation was performed to evaluate the impact of the annealing process on the properties of the perovskite light absorber. The top view electron imaging micrographs presented in Fig. 6 show a distinct difference in crystal size, shape and distribution between NIR and oven annealed films. Whilst the perovskite material appears in the form of a porous network of branched ca. 5–10 μm size uniformly spread agglomerates in the case of oven annealed samples, the NIR annealed films are characterised with large, up to 30 μm size, dendrite-like continuous structures. This is a rather surprising observation since fast material crystallisation kinetics (3.4 s NIR vs. 60 min oven) usually tends to favour nucleation over growth. Hence, it may be suggested that kinetics here is not the main factor influencing the formation of the perovskite films. Instead, it appears that in the case of NIR annealed films, the short but intense heat flow provided to the organolead halide wet precursor via the FTO substrate (illustrated in Fig. 2) promotes a substrate-driven nucleation and lateral growth of large crystals accompanied by an upward, vertical progression of the solvent evaporation. This vertical progression of solvent, for under-annealed samples, may have resulted in residual solvent pockets trapped at the top of the film, contributing to lower fill factors. In comparison, the uniform heat flow provided to the organolead halide wet precursor in the case of oven annealing seems to induce a bulk crystallisation phenomenon, with the perovskite precursor using the porous matrix of Al2O3 nanoparticles as a nucleation and growth scaffold. Finally, the branched porous discontinuous structures observed for oven annealed devices may explain the lower JSCs compared to NIR annealed counterparts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the oven and NIR annealed films shown in Fig. 7 confirm the crystalline nature of the lead halide perovskite material, in both cases identified as the tetragonal phase of CH3NH3PbI3 (I4/mcm), based on XRD data previously reported by Baikie et al.27 The much higher intensity of peaks related to NIR compared to oven annealed films correlates the difference in crystal size observed in Fig. 6. The high intensity of the peaks at 14.04° and 28.38° associated to the (110) and (220) crystal planes, relatively to other characteristic peaks of the CH3NH3PbI3, labelled as (112), (211), (202), (114) and (134) is indicative of the growth of large crystals with preferential orientation such as the (110) and (220) plane are oriented parallel to the substrate. The subfigure in Fig. 7, where the XRD spectra have been normalised to the (110) peak shows that the preferential orientation of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal lattice is more pronounced in the case of NIR annealed compared to oven annealed films. However, this observation does not seem to impact on the photovoltaic performance of the devices.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that it is possible to produce organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells with PCEs over 10% using an annealing process that is orders of magnitude faster than the traditional method widely used in literature. With this faster and less energy-intensive processing method, crystallographic analysis has shown a more preferentially oriented structure. We have also offered possible explanations for differences in VOC, JSC and fill factor in the two processing methods. Further optimisations of NIR annealing parameters will almost certainly improve PCEs and lead to the possibility of rapidly processed and commercially attractive perovskite based photovoltaic products.
