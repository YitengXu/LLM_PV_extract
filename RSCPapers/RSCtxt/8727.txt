    , Accepted 24th April 2012First published on 2nd May 2012AbstractOrganic ionic crystals carrying 4-cyano-4′-hydroxybiphenyl and imidazolium units were synthesized and applied as the electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The fabricated all-solid-state DSSCs achieved a cell efficiency of ∼5.11% at 55 °C under the simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illuminations at 100 mW cm−2 because of the enhanced light harvesting capability of the electrolyte. To further improve the cell efficiency, 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodine (PMII), was added into the electrolytes as a crystal growth inhibitor. These fabricated devices showed an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼6.55% at 45 °C under the simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illuminations at 50 mW cm−2, and a superior long-term stability. The cyanobiphenyl-functionalized ionic crystal based electrolytes have expanded our vision to explore new types of all-solid-state electrolytes for high-efficiency DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have recently gained wide interest because of their attractive advantages such as high-efficiency, low-cost and easy-handling fabrication.1–5 Though an overall photoelectric conversion efficiency of up to 12% has been reported for liquid electrolyte cells,6–10 some scientific and technological difficulties, such as solvent leakage and long-term instability, still need to be improved before the widespread commercialization of DSSCs. Quasi-solid and all-solid state DSSCs have been considered as potential candidates that may overcome the liquid electrolyte leakage problems. Previous attention to quasi-solid and all-solid-state electrolytes has been mainly focused on polymer electrolytes.11–15 However, the conductivity of polymer electrolytes is often low because the ion dynamics are limited by the polymeric backbone which is generally not mobile enough to achieve high conductivity. On the other hand, DSSCs with quasi-solid or solid-state electrolytes with high overall conversion efficiencies are still highly desirable for practical DSSC application.16,17 Therefore, it is still a challenge to design thermostable and efficient quasi-solid or solid-state DSSCs.
Ionic liquids are mostly organic salts with melting points below or near room temperature.18 They are attracting wide attention because of their negligible vapor pressure, high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical activity.19 Imidazolium-based ionic liquids have been the most popular materials used as electrolytes because of their high conductivity in DSSCs.20 However, most ionic liquids are liquid at room temperature. Therefore, the fluidity and potential leakage of ionic liquid-based electrolytes during long-term operation is still unavoidable, which limits their wide application in DSSCs. To overcome this problem here ionic crystals have been synthesized and applied as solid-state electrolytes for DSSCs.
Ionic crystals are a class of crystalline compounds that contain anions and cations. Their ionic character means that ionic crystals are ionic conductors and their properties differ significantly to conventional crystals. Furthermore, the use of ionic crystals could avoid the leakage problems of the device since they are solid at room temperature. It has been reported that biphenyl and 4-cyanobiphenyl are important core units for mesogenic molecules.21–27 Cyanobiphenyl-functionalized compounds can act as a kind of low light-transmitting and high light-scattering material and obtained a high light-harvesting efficiency when they were employed as an electrolyte placed at the back of the working electrode.28,29 In this work, organic ionic crystals carrying both 4-cyano-4′-hydroxybiphenyl and imidazolium units were synthesized. Addition of ionic crystals to electrolytes could enhance the light-harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 photoelectrode, and thus high performance DSSCs could be achieved. To further improve the cell efficiency, a room temperature ionic liquid, 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodine (PMII),30 was added as a crystal growth inhibitor of the electrolytes. The ionic conductivity, diffusion of I−/I3− redox couple of all-solid-state electrolytes and the device performances of the DSSCs were investigated.

Fabrication of the DSSCs
The fabrication of the DSSCs was as documented in the previous literature.20a,33 The cleaned FTO glass was covered at two parallel edges with an adhesive tape to control the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film. Two layers of TiO2 particles were deposited onto cleaned FTO glass and used as the photoelectrode. A 10 μm thick film of 20 nm sized TiO2 particles was deposited onto the FTO glass electrode by the doctor-blade technique. The film was dried at 125 °C for 5 min, then a second 5 μm thick layer of 200 nm light-scattering anatase particles were coated on the top of the first TiO2 layer. The resulting TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the obtained TiO2 electrode was immersed in 0.3 mM solution of Z907 in acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol at room temperature for 24 h. The dyed TiO2 electrode was washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried with nitrogen stream. To prepare the Pt counter electrode, two drops of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol was placed onto the cleaned FTO glass substrate, followed by drying and annealing at 400 °C for 15 min.
The solid electrolytes composed of EMII, PMII, ionic crystals and 0.10 M I2 were stirred at 80 °C for 12 h in a well sealed bottle to ensure homogeneity. After cooling down to room temperature, the all-solid-state electrolytes were formed. A typical liquid electrolyte was prepared by adding 1 M PMII, 0.1 M I2, 0.5 M TBP, and 0.1 M GuSCN in 3-methoxypropionitrile.
Solid DSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching the melted electrolyte between a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a pre-drilled Pt counter electrode with a 25 μm thick hot melt ring (Surlyn, DuPont). The fabricated devices were placed in vacuum under 80 °C for 24 h to remove the residual air and water to guarantee optimum filling and fine electrical contact. The concentration of iodine in the electrolytes could be kept constant under such experimental conditions.34 The produced devices were sealed with a Surlyn sheet and a thin glass cover by heating. Five devices of each sample were fabricated, and all the photovoltaic data were tested for five times and the average taken.
Characterization and photovoltaic measurements

1H NMR spectra were carried out on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer using chloroform-d (CDCl3) as the solvent. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data were conducted on Accurate-Mass TOF LC/MS. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the synthesized compounds were recorded on a Varian CP-3800 spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Absorption spectra were observed with a UV Lambda 750 UV/vis/NIR spectrometer. Thermal analysis was carried out on Universal Analysis 2000 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Samples were heated from 50 to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen flow. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a temperature range of −50 to 150 °C on DSC-Q200. Melting points of the compounds were measured with a Yanaco micro melting point apparatus MP model. Optical microscopy was carried out using standard glass microscope slides on an Olympus BX60 polarizing microscope (POM) equipped with a Mettler FP82HT hot stage and digital camera.
The conductivity of the electrolytes was characterized in an ordinary cell composed of a Teflon® tube and two identical stainless steel electrodes (with diameter of 1 cm) on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation. All the samples were equilibrated for at least 30 min at a given temperature. Steady-state voltammetry was tested on a conventional photoelectrochemical cell equipped with a radius of 5.0 μm platinum ultramicroelectrode (CHI107) as the working electrode, and a platinum foil as a counter and reference electrode, respectively. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs were shielded by an aluminum foil mask with an aperture area of ~0.1 cm2 and were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2612) under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2, respectively. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plotted as a function of excitation wavelength was recorded on a Keithley 2612 source meter under the irradiation of a Xenon lamp with a monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone™ 260 1/4). The photoelectrochemical parameters, such as the fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were calculated according to the previous reports.20a The apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) of I− and I3− was calculated from the anodic and cathodic steady-state currents (Iss) using the following eqn (1):35 Iss = 4nFDapprc(1)where n is the number of transferred electrons, F is the Faraday constant, r is the microdisk electrode radius, and c is the bulk concentration of the electroactive species.
Results and discussion
A facile strategy for the synthesis of ionic crystals carrying both 4-cyano-4′-hydroxybiphenyl and imidazolium units is presented in Scheme 1. The chemical structure and purity of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry (Fig. S1–S5, see ESI†). Fig. 1a shows the typical thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) curves of the synthesized ionic crystals which were recorded under a nitrogen flow from 50 to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to assess their short-term thermal stability. All the compounds showed weight loss at temperatures above 250 °C, indicating that all of these ionic crystals confer a high thermal stability, far beyond the range of interest for practical application in DSSCs. Fig. S6, see ESI†, shows the 1H NMR spectra of [C2BIm][Br] after being annealed at 150 °C for 0.5 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. It can be seen that the chemical structure of the compound is well retained, which further confirms the thermal stability of the synthesized ionic crystals. Fig. 1b shows the typical DSC analysis traces for the pure ionic crystals. It is can be seen that all the compounds show a melting point (Tm) above 70 °C. The crystal properties of the compound were confirmed by the representative POM images, as shown in Fig. 2.

It has been demonstrated that a relatively high conductivity and rapid diffusion of I−/I3− redox couple through the electrolytes are critical to the solar cell performance.36,37 Here, the ionic conductivity and steady-state voltammetry of I−/I3− in the EMII electrolytes containing various amounts of [C2BIm][Br] were studied first. The apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) of I−/I3− was calculated from the anodic and cathodic steady-state currents (Iss), and the results are summarized in Table 1. Upon the addition of [C2BIm][Br], both the values of ionic conductivity and Dapp of I−/I3− decreased as compared with pure EMII electrolytes (entry 1, Table 1). It is supposed that the addition of ionic crystal compounds increases the viscosity of electrolytes and thus hinders the ionic diffusion of I−/I3− in the all-solid-state electrolytes.38

It can be clearly seen that 20 wt% [C2BIm][Br] doped EMII electrolyte shows the highest ionic conductivity among the ionic crystal doped solid-state electrolytes at 25 °C (Table 1). The changing trends in Dapp of the I−/I3− redox couple were similar to that of the ionic conductivity, which shows a highest value of 20 wt% [C2BIm][Br] doped electrolytes. The slight decrease in the values of ionic conductivity and Dapp of I−/I3− might be due to the inhomogeneous electrolyte formed upon the excess addition of [C2BIm][Br].39 Based on the results discussed above, 20 wt% [CnBIm][X] (n = 2, 4, 6, X = Br, BF4 and TFSI) doped EMII electrolytes (see Table 2) were thereby chosen for the fabrication of the all-solid-state DSSCs in this work.

[CnBIm][X] doped EMII all-solid-state electrolytes were prepared for the DSSCs. For comparison, devices based on a liquid electrolyte were fabricated and characterized. Fig. 3a shows the typical thermal analysis traces for pure EMII and [CnBIm][X] doped electrolytes I–VI (EMII + 20 wt% [CnBIm][X], without I2) used in this work. It can be clearly seen that all of the electrolytes are solid below 60 °C (as typically shown in Fig. 3b). When the temperature increased, the solid would become liquid and this was helpful for the filling of electrolytes. The conductivity and Dapp of I−/I3− of the electrolytes were characterized, and the results are summarized in Table 2. All the solid-state electrolytes show a lower conductivity than that of the liquid electrolyte. It can be seen that the electrolyte, [C4BIm][Br]/EMII/I2, shows the highest conductivity and Dapp of I−/I3− of the solid state electrolytes. It is supposed that [C4BIm][Br] could form a well-ordered ion-conductive network in the electrolytes40 if compared with [C2BIm][Br] due to the relatively longer saturated carbon linkage chains. However, the [C6BIm][Br] doped electrolyte shows a lower conductivity and Dapp of I−/I3−, this might be due to the reduction of the ion-conductive layer number per unit length if the mobility of the ionic species in the layer is the same in the two salts.40

(b) A photograph of 20 wt% [C4BIm][Br] doped EMII electrolyte containing 0.1 M I2 at 60 °C. 
The photoelectrical parameters of the DSSCs containing different electrolytes at a variety of temperatures were investigated and the results are listed in Table 3. The corresponding J–V curves at 55 °C under 1 sun light intensity illumination are shown in Fig. 4a. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and FF for pure EMII electrolytes are 575 mV, 10.89 mA cm−2, and 62.6%, respectively, yielding an overall PCE of 3.92%, which is much lower than those of DSSCs with [CnBIm][X] doped electrolytes. However, it should be noted that [CnBIm][X] doped electrolytes have lower conductivity and Dapp values of I−/I3− compared to pure EMII electrolytes. Therefore, the enhanced photoelectrical parameters of [CnBIm][X] doped electrolytes should be due to the light-scattering properties of the cyanobiphenyl-functionalized [CnBIm][X] compounds.

Larger sized (∼200 nm) TiO2 particles have been widely used as the scattering layer for improving light-harvesting. However, there is still some light leakage through the dyed TiO2 photoelectrode.41,42 Therefore, it is still necessary to develop a functional electrolyte with light-harvesting properties. It has been reported that the cyanobiphenyl-functionalized liquid crystal-based electrolyte could act as a kind of low light-transmitting and high light-scattering material to obtain a high light-harvesting efficiency.26,28,29Fig. 5 shows the light transmitting and scattering properties of the [C4BIm][Br]-doped EMII electrolyte. A hypothesized operational scheme of such a device is shown in Fig. 5c. It can be clearly seen that most of the light is intensively reflected indicating that [C4BIm][Br] could effectively reflect the light leaked through the dyed TiO2 photoelectrode, which would result in a remarkable decrease of the light transmittance. The multi-reflection of the light in the electrolyte leads to an increase of light-harvesting efficiency of the dye adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 photoelectrode. For the ionic crystal doped EMII electrolytes, the optical thickness (σ(λ)) could be calculated from eqn (2):28,29 (2)where R(λ) and T(λ) are the reflectance and transmittance of the electrolyte, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 5a and b, the σ(λ) value of the ionic crystal doped EMII electrolyte III was higher than that of the pure EMII electrolyte I, which therefore enhanced the optical path length of the incident light, and consequently increased the light-harvesting efficiency.

The Voc reduction was detected for the solid-state devices based on the ionic crystals doped EMII electrolytes. The value of Voc for DSSCs with an iodine redox electrolyte can be represented by the following equation:43,44 (3)where k and T are the Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature respectively, Iinj is the injection current from dye to semiconductor, ncb is the electron density on the conduction band of the semiconductor, and ket is the rate constant for I3− reduction. According to eqn (3), the decrease in Voc of the ionic crystal doped EMII electrolytes could be due to the enhanced dark reaction.45 In the case of device III, the charge transport in the solid-state electrolyte was hindered by the addition of [C4BIm][Br], and the transportation of I3− ions from the dyed TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface to the counter electrode was slowed down. Thus, the recombination at the interface between nanoporous TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte was accelerated, which resulted in an increased dark current and a decreased Voc (see Fig. 4a).
Photovoltaic performance parameters of the devices measured at 25 °C under 1 sun illumination are also shown in Table 3. The short-circuit photocurrent increases with temperature up to 55 °C, mainly due to the lowered electrolyte viscosity which facilitates the mass transport of triiodide ions. Furthermore, high temperature may also thermally activate electron injection from occupied sensitizer states located near or slightly below the thermodynamic threshold.46 Here, the highest power conversion efficiency of 5.11% is obtained for device III operated at 55 °C (see Fig. 4b and Table 3).
The counter anions of [CnBIm][X] also affect the ionic conductivity and Dapp values of I−/I3−. It has been reported that the geometry of the counter anions heavily impacts the molecular structure and the solid state packing of the cations, which results in distinct molecular conformations and further affects the motion of the electroactive species and eventually influences the conversion efficiency of the DSSCs.47 For example, [C4BIm][Br] doped electrolytes show a higher ionic conductivity and Dapp values than those of [C4BIm][BF4] and [C4BIm][TFSI] (see Table 2). Therefore, it is not surprising that device III shows higher photoelectrical parameters than those of devices V and VI (see Table 3).

Fig. 6a represents the IPCE values of devices I–VI. All the cells display a broad spectral response over the entire visible spectrum with an IPCE value larger than 40% in the 430–630 nm wavelength range, and a maximum value of 45.8%, 56.9%, 72.3%, 65.9%, 69.0% and 64.9% is reached at about 530 nm for device I–VI, respectively. The IPCE values of these devices are consistent with PCE.
 Fig. 6  (a) IPCE vs. wavelength profiles for devices I–VI. (b) The evolution of normalized photoelectric conversion efficiency of different electrolytes based DSSCs with time during successive one sun light soaking with a UV cutoff filter at 55 °C. 
The long-term stability of devices I–VI was investigated via an accelerating aging test of sealed devices, as shown in Fig. 6b. During the first seven days, the efficiency of the devices is moderately enhanced due to an increase of the regeneration of dye Z907 and thus an increase of Jsc.48 All the devices with added ionic crystals retained around 90% of their initial conversion efficiency in this period, demonstrating that these devices are stable under the working conditions.
The photovoltaic performance parameters of the devices under different light intensity illumination are also studied and the results are summarized in Table 4. The DSSC based on electrolyte III displays a maximum PCE of 6.36% under 0.5 sun light intensity illumination. The corresponding values of Voc, Jsc, and FF of DSSCs are shown in ESI (Table S1, see ESI†). The differences in the photovoltaic performance under different simulated sunlight irradiations was attributed to the nonlinear behavior of photocurrent at higher light intensity. In the all-solid-state electrolytes, the photocurrent loss was observed under full sunlight illumination as the result of carriers transport limitation due to the solid-state of the electrolytes,13 indicating that the fabricated all-solid-state DSSCs could be used in a relatively low-light environment. Compared with the performance at 0.5 sun, the electronic recombination increased at 0.15 sun, which can lead to a lower voltage and decrease the efficiency.

High performance DSSCs based on [CnBIm][X]/EMII electrolytes could be achieved, however, as shown in Fig. 3a the [CnBIm][X]/EMII electrolytes are easily crystallized, which prevents the filling of solid-state electrolytes into the TiO2 porous structure and causes a decrease in the photovoltaic performance of devices.49,50 To further improve the cell efficiency, the crystal growth inhibitor PMII was thereby introduced into the prepared [C4BIm][Br]/EMII electrolyte (electrolyte III).30 DSC traces of [C4BIm][Br]/EMII/PMII electrolytes show that the crystal growth of the electrolytes could be effectively inhibited with the increase in PMII content (Fig. 7). It should be noted that 50 wt% PMII doped [C4BIm][Br]/EMII electrolytes could still exhibit a solid state below 49 °C. Therefore, device VII composed of [C4BIm][Br]/EMII/PMII electrolyte and 0.1 M I2 was characterized at 45 °C under 0.5 sun light intensity illumination. Compared to device III, the Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE values of device VII increased from 559 mV, 7.67 mA cm−2, 68.2% and 5.85% to 568 mV, 8.07 mA cm−2, 71.5% and 6.55%, respectively. The related J–V curves of device III and device VII are presented in Fig. 8. The photoelectrical parameters of device III and device VII under different light intensities and temperatures were investigated and listed in Table 5.

The long-term stability of device VII at 25 and 45 °C was examined and the results are presented in Fig. 9. The device retained around 95% of its initial conversion efficiency at 25 °C and 45 °C. For comparison, the long-term stability of device VII and the device based on liquid electrolyte was tested at 80 °C. Device VII kept about 85% of its initial conversion efficiency while the liquid device lost ∼60% after the 1000 h aging test. The results of the stability test demonstrated that all these solid-state ionic crystal/EMII electrolytes could suppress the leakage of organic liquid electrolyte under relevant temperatures, and therefore results in a high long-term durability of the devices.

Conclusions
In conclusion, cyanobiphenyl-functionalized organic ionic crystals, with light-scattering properties, were synthesized and applied as electrolytes for solid-state DSSCs. An overall PCE of ∼6.55% was obtained for the [C4BIm][Br] doped electrolytes under 0.5 sun light intensity illumination because of the enhanced light harvest capability in the electrolyte. Furthermore, the fabricated solid-state DSSCs show excellent long-time stability. These results demonstrate a feasible approach to high-efficiency solid-state DSSCs for practical application.
