    , Accepted 27th September 2017First published on 27th September 2017AbstractA full domain control model is established for impurity transportation in the liquid phase, gas–liquid interface and gas phase of silicon to analyze the dynamic mechanics of impurity removal. The results show that the overall mass transfer coefficient mainly depends on the temperature and the chamber pressure. Its value increases with the increase of temperature or the decrease of chamber pressure. Under the same melting condition, the order of the overall mass transfer coefficients for P, Al and Ca is kP > kAl > kCa, indicating that P is easier to remove by evaporation. Mass transfer in the gas phase is the rate-controlling step for volatile impurity removal at the temperature above the melting point of silicon. The rate-controlling step transits to evaporation on the gas–liquid interface then to mass transfer in the liquid boundary layer as the temperature increases. During electron beam melting, the removal of P is controlled by both evaporation on the gas–liquid interface and mass transfer in the liquid boundary layer, and the removal of Al and Ca is controlled by evaporation on the gas–liquid interface.
1. Introduction
As a key raw material for solar cells, crystalline silicon occupies more than 80% of the global photovoltaic market.1–3 Phosphorus (P) is one of the main impurities in silicon, which has a significant influence on the electrical properties of solar cells.4 As an element in Group V of the periodic table, P plays a role as an impurity donor in silicon to provide free electrons to change the resistivity and the minority carrier lifetime of the material, therefore, the P content should be controlled in a reasonable range. Generally, it is acknowledged that the P content in silicon should be reduced to less than 0.3 × 10−4 wt% to meet the requirement for solar cells. Aluminium (Al) and calcium (Ca) are main metal impurities in silicon, which also affect the electrical properties of solar cells, such as the resistivity, the minority carrier lifetime and the photoelectric conversion efficiency.5–7 It is generally acknowledged that Al and Ca should be reduced to less than 0.1 × 10−4 wt% to meet the requirement for solar cells.
P, Al and Ca are volatile impurities in silicon with large saturated vapor pressure, which can be removed by evaporation in a high temperature and high vacuum environment. Electron beam melting has been proved to be an effective method to remove these impurities from silicon.8–13 An electron beam with a high energy density bombards the surface of the silicon raw material, and the kinetic energy of electrons is converted to heat energy to heat and melt the material.14,15 The power and scanning pattern can be adjusted to retain the molten state at a relatively high temperature.16 Volatile impurities evaporate from the melt surface to the gas phase to reach a gas/liquid equilibrium state with impurities in liquid. Impurities in the gas phase condense on the surface of the condenser or are taken away by the vacuum system continuously to break the gas/liquid equilibrium state. As a consequence, impurities in molten silicon evaporate continuously so that silicon is purified.
The previous research studies show that the removal efficiency can be improved by increasing the beam power or the refining time, but it results in the increase of silicon loss. Therefore, the transportation and removal mechanisms of volatile impurities during silicon purification need to be clarified in order to determine reasonable refining parameters. In our previous work,17,18 a model was established with a consideration of only impurity evaporation on the gas–liquid interface, or combination of its evaporation and transportation in liquid. However, impurity transportation in the gas phase may affect its removal efficiency, especially in the area near the melt surface, where the pressure increases due to evaporation. In this study, a full domain control model was established for impurity transportation in the liquid phase, gas–liquid interface and gas phase of silicon to analyze the dynamic mechanics of impurity removal. The mass transfer coefficient was evaluated to determine the rate-controlling step. The theoretical value was compared with the experimental value to verify the applicability of the model.
2. Thermodynamics of impurity evaporation
As for the crude metal containing many kinds of impurities or the alloy with multiple elements, in a high temperature and high vacuum environment, the element with a high saturated vapor pressure can be evaporated firstly to enter into the gas phase and the element with a low saturated vapor pressure is retained in the liquid, which is the theoretical foundation for vacuum refining.19,20 Specific to silicon purification, the difference between the vapor pressure of liquid silicon and the dissolved impurity is the basic principle for vacuum separation of impurity from silicon. The vapor pressure above the melt of the pure element, p0i (Pa), is only a function of temperature, which can be expressed by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation: logp0i = AT−1 + BlogT + CT + D(1)where T (K) is the absolute temperature; A, B, C, and D are constants associated with the evaporating species, which can be found in the thermodynamics handbook.21 The vapor pressures of pure P, Al, Ca and Si can be estimated using the data listed in Table 1. The values of P, Al and Ca are far larger than that of silicon, indicating that these impurities can be evaporated from molten silicon.

Impurity atoms can evaporate from the free surface of silicon melt in a high temperature and high vacuum environment. However, silicon substrates can also evaporate with the evaporation of impurity. Since the impurity content in silicon is fairly low, the thermodynamic activity of impurity is much less than that of the silicon solvent. Therefore, the evaporation rates of impurity and silicon are different. As a consequence, the impurity element may be removed from the melt or enriched in the melt, which depends on the evaporation rates of the impurity element and matrix material.
Considering a melt only containing a (g) of matrix silicon and b (g) of impurity, and after vacuum melting for a certain time, x (g) of silicon and y (g) of impurity are evaporated. It is assumed that impurity evaporates from the melt in the form of monatomic gas, and then the following relationship can be obtained:22 (2)
The volatility coefficient, β, is used to evaluate the feasibility of removing a dilute solute element (P, Al or Ca here) from a molten metal (silicon here), which can be described as: (3)where MSi (kg mol−1) and Mi (kg mol−1) are the molar mass of silicon and impurity, respectively; γSi and γi are the activity coefficients of silicon and impurity, respectively. In a dilute solution, silicon (the solvent) will follow Raoult's law, so γSi is considered to be unity. Meanwhile, the impurity (the solute) at a sufficiently low concentration will follow Henry's law, so γi can be taken equal to γ0i, the activity coefficient in the infinite dilute solution. Thus, the volatility coefficient for impurity removal from silicon can be written as: (4)
If β < 1, matrix silicon is evaporated faster than impurity, resulting in the concentration of impurity in the silicon melt; if β = 1, silicon and impurity have the same evaporation rates, thus the content of impurity does not change; if β > 1, impurity is evaporated faster than silicon, resulting in the decrease of the impurity content in the silicon melt. Generally, it is believed that the impurities can be removed effectively when β is larger than 10.
The activity coefficients of P, Al and Ca in molten silicon are investigated by Miki et al.23–26 Hence, based on the vapor pressures of pure elements given by eqn (1) and the activity coefficients listed in Table 2, the volatility coefficient can be calculated, as shown in Fig. 1. The volatility coefficient of P, Al and Ca is calculated as larger than 10 in the temperature range of 1700–2500 K, indicating that they can be removed from silicon in a high temperature and high vacuum environment. The removal efficiency of P is more than that of Al and Ca due to the far larger volatility coefficient value of the former than that of the latter. The evaporation rate of impurity increases with the increase of temperature; however that of silicon also increases. As a consequence, the curves show a generally lowering tendency with the increase of temperature.

3. Mass transfer kinetics of the removal of volatile impurities
3.1. Model description
The electron beam melting process is shown in Fig. 2. The silicon raw material is put in a water-cooled copper crucible. The electrons are accelerated by high voltage electrostatic field to bombard the surface of the material. The kinetic energy of the electrons transforms into heat energy to make the materials melt completely. Impurity atoms evaporate from the free surface of the silicon melt in a high temperature and high vacuum environment.
 Fig. 2  Schematic diagram of the electron beam melting process. 
The migration path of impurity atoms during electron beam melting is shown in Fig. 3. Assuming that impurity evaporation from the silicon melt is not affected by that of other impurity elements. It is usually considered that the removal reaction consists of the following five steps:
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagram of the impurity atom migration path of during electron beam melting. 
(1) Transport of an atom through the melt into the liquid boundary layer;
(2) Transport across the liquid boundary layer to the melt free surface;
(3) Vaporization from the melt free surface into the gas phase above the surface;
(4) Transport across a gas phase in the chamber;
(5) Condensation on the chamber inner surface or gas being extracted by a vacuum system.
Based on the characteristics and conditions of electron beam melting, one or more of these steps may become the rate-controlling step for impurity removal. During electron beam melting, a high density electron beam irradiates directly on the surface of the molten pool, and the bottom contacts directly with the water-cooled copper crucible, resulting in an extremely heterogeneous temperature distribution in molten silicon. There is a strong flow in the bulk of the melt caused by the temperature difference so that the impurity content is almost uniform, so step (1) is not considered to be the rate-controlling step. Impurity evaporates from the melt surface, transports across the gas phase and then condenses on the surface of the condenser or is taken away by the vacuum system. Electron beam melting equipment has a very large cold surface of and the vacuum system runs continuously, so step (5) is also not considered to be the rate-controlling step. As a consequence, steps (2), step (3) and step (4) are considered to be the rate-controlling steps. The removal rate of impurity can be controlled by an individual step, a combination of two particular steps or all three steps, which will be discussed in the following.
After silicon is melted completely, the impurity content is considered to be homogenous in molten silicon. This content corresponds to an equilibrium partial pressure in the gas phase. However, the actual partial pressure is zero at the beginning, since there is no impurity atoms in the gas phase. The difference between the equilibrium partial pressure and the actual partial pressure becomes the driving force for the evaporation of impurities on the melt surface. After evaporating the impurities into the gas phase, the impurity content on the melt surface decreases to form a concentration gradient in the liquid boundary layer, which is the driving force for the impurity diffusion in the layer. Meanwhile, a pressure gradient forms in the gas phase due to impurity evaporation. The partial pressure of impurity in the area near the molten pool is larger than that in the area far from here. This pressure gradient is the driving force for impurity transportation in the gas phase. The vacuum system runs continuously, which is the driving force for impurity transportation, so that impurity can be removed continuously.
3.2. Mass transfer through the liquid boundary layer
The molar flux of impurity through the liquid to the melt interface can be calculated using the Machlin model. In step 2, the mass transfer rate of impurity from the bulk of the melt across the boundary layer to the melt free surface, Jmi (mol m−2 s−1), can be expressed as:27 Jmi = kmi(Ci − Csi)(5)where Ci (mol m−3) and Csi (mol m−3) are the impurity content in the bulk and at the evaporating surface of silicon melt, respectively, kmi (m s−1) is the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid boundary layer, which can be calculated by: (6)where rm (m) is the melt radius and vm (m s−1) is the melt surface velocity, which are related to the characteristics of the melt. Dmi (m2 s−1) is the diffusion coefficient of the element in molten silicon, which depends on the temperature of the melt. The diffusion coefficient of the solute element in molten silicon can be expressed as:28 (7)where, kB (1.38 × 10−23 J K−1) is the Boltzmann constant; ri (m) is the atomic radius; μSi (Pa s) is the viscosity of the silicon melt, which can be achieved by the relationship between silicon viscosity and temperature as follows:29 (8)
The diffusion coefficient of impurity in molten silicon can be calculated according to eqn (7) and (8), and then the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid boundary layer can be obtained by eqn (6). It can be seen from these equations that the coefficient depends on the temperature, velocity and dimension of the melt surface. Fig. 4 shows the influence of temperature on the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid boundary layer. The mass transfer coefficient values of P, Al and Ca are in the order of magnitude of 10−4 m s−1 in the temperature range of 1700–2500 K, which increases with the increase of temperature. Impurity transportation in the liquid boundary layer is controlled by diffusion. The higher the temperature, the larger the diffusion coefficient, and the larger the mass transfer coefficient. The order of values is kmP > kmAl > kmCa at the same temperature, which is the consequence of the diffusion coefficient.
 Fig. 4  Mass transfer coefficient in the boundary layer as a function of temperature. 

Fig. 5 shows the influence of melt surface velocity on the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid boundary layer. The values of mass transfer coefficient of P, Al and Ca are in the order of magnitude of 10−4 m s−1 in the velocity range of 0.01–0.6 m s−1, which increase with the increase of velocity. The melt surface velocity represents renewal frequency of the surface mass. The larger the velocity, the faster the surface renewal, so that it becomes easy for the liquid with a high impurity content to reach the melt surface to accelerate the impurity removal. Under the condition of vacuum induction melting, the velocity is in the order of magnitude of 10−2–10−1 m s−1;20,30 while, under the condition of electron beam melting, the velocity is in the range of 0.3–0.6 m s−1,31 which improves impurity transportation in the liquid boundary layer.

Fig. 6 shows the influence of the melt surface dimension on the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid boundary layer. The mass transfer coefficient values of P, Al and Ca are in the order of magnitude of 10−4 m s−1 in the radius range of 0.01–0.5 m, which decrease with the increase of the radius. At a certain velocity, the larger the melt surface dimension, the slower the surface renewal, which goes against the impurity removal. In actual production, a refining crucible with large dimensions is always used to enhance productivity. If the mass transfer through the liquid boundary layer is the rate-controlling step, a higher temperature needs to be achieved to improve the impurity removal efficiency.

3.3. Mass transfer by evaporation at the melt free surface
The evaporation rate of a substance at elevated temperature can be calculated using the Herz–Langmuir–Knudsen equation. In step 3, impurity atoms evaporate from the free surface of the silicon melt. Taking into consideration of the high vacuum in the chamber, the mass transfer molar flux, Jsi (mol m−2 s−1), can be expressed as:32 (9)where pei (Pa) is the equilibrium partial pressure of impurity in the gas phase, R (8.314 J mol−1 K−1) is the ideal gas constant. Parameter α is called the evaporation coefficient, which is attributed to the surface contamination. The value of α is smaller than unity; however, for clean melt it reaches unity. In the present study, since the melt is highly pure, it is assumed that α ≈ 1.
At a certain temperature, the equilibrium partial pressure is related to the Gibbs free energy changes of impurities evaporated from the melt surface. The Gibbs free energy changes of P, Al and Ca are shown in Table 3.24,25

When the reaction reaches thermodynamic equilibrium (10)where p0 (101325 Pa) is the standard atmospheric pressure, fi is the activity coefficient of impurity in molten silicon, [wt pct i] is the impurity content in mass percent, which can be converted to molar concentration: (11)where ρ (kg m−3) is the density of molten silicon. Mukai et al. investigated the density as a function of temperature and gave the relationship as follows:33 ρ = 2520–0.326(T − 1687)(12)
Thus, the maximum molar flux can be expressed by substitution of eqn (10) and (11) in eqn (9) as: (13)or Jsi = ksiCsi(14)where ksi (m s−1) is the mass transfer coefficient of evaporation, which can be expressed as: (15)
The mass transfer coefficients of P, Al and Ca evaporation can be calculated according to eqn (15), which depends on melt temperature, as shown in Fig. 7. The mass transfer coefficient values of P, Al and Ca increase with the increase of temperature in the range of 1700–2500 K. The value of P is close to that of Al, and both are in the order of magnitude of 10−7–10−3 m s−1; while, the value of Ca is in the order of magnitude of 10−9–10−4 m s−1. The order of values is ksP > ksAl > ksCa at the same temperature, which mainly depends on the Gibbs free energy changes of impurity evaporation from the melt surface.

3.4. Mass transfer in the gas phase
Mass transfer of the evaporated species above the melt occurs by diffusion and convection mechanisms. After evaporation from the melt surface into the gas phase, the total molar flux of impurity can be expressed as:34 (16)where Dgi (m2 s−1) is the diffusion coefficient of an element in the gas phase; psi (Pa) and pci (Pa) are the partial pressures of impurity in the gas phase near the melt surface and near the condensing surface, respectively; x (m) is a coordinate perpendicularly away from the melt surface; vg (m s−1) is the gas velocity along the x coordinate. It has been postulated that the diffusion mechanism is not significant under high vacuum conditions,35 and the diffusion mass transfer is negligible compared to the mass transfer by convection. Extending this result to the evaporated impurity from molten silicon and considering mass transfer by convection as the dominant mechanism, eqn (16) becomes: (17)
It is assumed that the partial pressures of impurity near the condensing surface pci = 0, when it reaches thermodynamic equilibrium, psi = pei, thus (18)or Jgi = kgiCsi(19)where kgi (m s−1) is the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase, which can be expressed as: (20)
As the gas phase mainly consists of silicon vapor, vg can be considered as the gas velocity obtained for the evaporation of pure silicon:20 (21)where pt (Pa) is the chamber pressure. The mass transfer coefficients of P, Al and Ca in the gas phase can be calculated according to eqn (20), which depends on temperature and chamber pressure. Fig. 8 shows the influence of temperature on the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase. The mass transfer coefficient values of P, Al and Ca increase rapidly with the increase of temperature in the range of 1700–2500 K. The value of P is close to that of Al, and both are in the order of magnitude of 10−8–101 m s−1; while, the value of Ca is in the order of magnitude of 10−10–100 m s−1. The order of values is kgP > kgAl > kgCa at the same temperature, which mainly depends on the Gibbs free energy changes of impurity evaporation from the melt surface.
 Fig. 8  Mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase as a function of temperature. 

Fig. 9 shows the influence of chamber pressure on the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase. The mass transfer coefficient values of P, Al and Ca decrease rapidly with the increase of chamber pressure in the range of 0.01–1 Pa. Under high vacuum conditions, the number of moleculars in gas phase is not much, so the mean free path enlarges to enhance the gas velocity. During electron beam melting, the chamber pressure is always kept at the order of magnitude of 10−2 Pa, far less than that during vacuum induction melting, which is more beneficial to improve mass transfer in the gas phase.

3.5. Overall mass transfer coefficient
Since impurity removal from molten silicon is a continuous process, so eqn (5), (14) and (19) should be equal to each other. Accordingly, the total molar flux is: Ji = kiCi(22)
Thus, the overall mass transfer coefficient, ki (m s−1), which is related to resistive steps for transportation across the boundary layer and evaporation on the melt free surface, can be calculated by: (23)
The removal of impurity from silicon may be controlled by one or more of the three steps, which can be determined by evaluating the relationship between the overall mass transfer coefficient and the mass transfer coefficient in each step. According to the above discussion, it is known that the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid boundary layer depends on the temperature, velocity and dimension of the melt surface; the mass transfer coefficient during evaporation depends on melt temperature; the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase depends on temperature and chamber pressure. As the combination function of the mass transfer coefficient in each step, the overall mass transfer coefficient is affected by all of these parameters. However, since the melt dimension has been determined during the melting process, and the influence of melt velocity on the mass transfer coefficient is limited, these two parameters can be negligible. Therefore, the overall mass transfer coefficient is considered to mainly depend on temperature and chamber pressure.
The mass transfer coefficients of P, Al and Ca in each step and the overall mass transfer coefficient as a function of temperature and chamber pressure are shown in Fig. 10. Temperature has a greater influence on the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase than that on the mass transfer coefficient during evaporation, and has little influence on the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid boundary layer. Besides, the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase is also affected by chamber pressure. At the same temperature, the order of the overall mass transfer coefficients of P, Al and Ca is kP > kAl > kCa, indicating that P can be more easily removed by evaporation. It can be seen from the figure, when the values of the three steps have a great difference, the step with the minimum value is the rate-controlling step. When the chamber pressure is kept at 0.05 Pa, mass transfer in the gas phase is the rate-controlling step at the temperature near the melting point of silicon; it changes gradually to mass transfer by evaporation then to mass transfer in the liquid boundary with the increase of temperature. At each transitional stage, there exists such a temperature range in which impurity removal is controlled by the combination of two steps. When the chamber pressure decreases to 0.01 Pa, the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase increases so that it is not the rate-controlling step any more, which changes only from mass transfer by evaporation then to mass transfer in the liquid boundary layer.
 Fig. 10  Mass transfer coefficients as a function of temperature: (a) P; (b) Al; (c) Ca. 
During electron beam melting, the chamber pressure is kept at 0.05 Pa and the temperature is over 1900 K, so mass transfer in the gas phase is not the rate-controlling step but the mass transfer by evaporation or the mass transfer in the liquid boundary layer. It can be seen from Fig. 11, as for P, the temperature for the rate-controlling step change is about 2100 K; as for Al and Ca, the temperature is over 2300 K. Therefore, the removal of P is controlled by the combination of mass transfer by evaporation and mass transfer in the liquid boundary layer; the removal of P is controlled only by mass transfer by evaporation.

4. Experimental verification
4.1. Experimental apparatus and procedure
The experiments were conducted in an electron beam melting furnace, as shown in Fig. 11. The experimental apparatus primarily consists of a chamber, an electron beam gun with an accelerating voltage of 30 kV and a maximum power of 30 kW, a water-cooled copper crucible, a circulation water cooling system and a vacuum pump system. Two independent vacuum systems are employed in this furnace: one is for the gun chamber with a pressure less than 3 × 10−3 Pa and the other is for the furnace chamber with a pressure less than 5 × 10−2 Pa.
Metallurgical grade silicon with an initial purity of 99.8% was used as the raw material in this experiment, and the initial contents of P, Al and Ca are 3.32 × 10−3 wt%, 4.05 × 10−3 wt% and 1.40 × 10−2 wt%, respectively. Prior to processing by electron beam melting, the raw material needs a pre-treatment. Hydrochloric acid with a molar concentration of 5% and hydrofluoric acid with a molar concentration of 1% were mixed according to the ratio of 1:1. The silicon raw material was washed sufficiently in the mixture for 15 min using a supersonic wave cleaner in order to remove possible solid residues and extraneous impurities from the surface. After that, the raw material was washed with deionized water several times until the residual acid was cleaned. The washed raw material was dried for 1–2 h.
300 g raw material was placed inside the water-cooled copper crucible, after which the furnace chamber was evacuated to a pressure less than 5 × 10−2 Pa and the gun chamber was evacuated to a pressure less than 3 × 10−3 Pa. The electron beam was irradiated on the surface of the raw material until it was melted completely and then was kept for a certain time, leading to impurity continuously evaporating from the melt free surface. The scanning pattern of the electron beam was chosen to be circular to ensure that silicon was heated homogeneously and steadily. A series of experiments were carried out with different powers and refining times. The experimental parameters used in this study are shown in Table 4. The refining time of zero was defined as the time at which silicon is being completely melted having the button shape in the crucible, and the time was stopped when the electron beam was shut down. The refining temperatures were set as 1941 K, 1964 K and 2051 K, respectively. The chamber pressure was kept at less than 5.0 × 10−2 Pa. The surface of the molten pool was irradiated with the electron beam with a circular pattern and the scanning frequency was set as 10 Hz. After electron beam melting, the obtained silicon ingots were cut and samples were chosen for chemical analysis. The impurity contents before and after electron beam melting were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

4.2. Measured values of the overall mass transfer coefficient
The time variations of impurity contents in electron beam melted silicon ingots are shown in Table 5. They have already been decreased and were different at the three powers when the refining time was defined as zero. This indicates that a large part of phosphorus had already evaporated before silicon was melted completely.

As the removal reaction of volatile impurity by evaporation follows first order kinetics, for a well-stirred batch system of volume, V (m3), and melt surface area, A (m2), the impurity content in the liquid phase can be expressed as a function of refining time, t (s): (24)
Considering C0 as the initial impurity content, integration between C0 at t = 0 and Ct at an arbitrary time t then gives: (25)
The value of ln Ct/C0 can be plotted as a function of refining time at different refining powers, so ki, the measured overall mass transfer coefficient, can be obtained from the slope of the straight line. In this experiment, the measured overall mass transfer coefficient values of P, Al and Ca at different temperatures are listed in Table 6. The value of P is larger than those of Al and Ca, indicating that P evaporates faster than Al and Ca. It increases with the increase of temperature, indicating that a high temperature can promote the removal of impurity from molten silicon.

4.3. Comparison of experimental and theoretical results
As the typical volatile impurities in silicon, the comparison of experimental and theoretical results of P, Al and Ca is shown in Fig. 12, including some results by vacuum induction melting, and the temperature and chamber pressure in these experiments are shown in Table 7.8,12,20,30,36–39 The measured value is consistent with the theoretical value, indicating that the theoretical model is feasible to predict the removal mechanics of volatile impurities from silicon by evaporation. However, there is a difference between experimental and theoretical values, resulting from the vacuum condition during the experiment and the raw material. In the theoretical model, impurity removal is considered to be carried out under a perfect vacuum condition and the temperature of the melt is considered to be homogeneous, but the actual situation is not like that. On the other hand, impurities in metallurgical grade silicon may influence each other, resulting in the deviation between experimental and theoretical values.

5. Conclusions
Based on the high temperature and high vacuum environment during electron beam melting, a full domain control model is established for impurity transportation in the liquid phase, gas–liquid interface and gas phase of silicon to analyze the dynamic mechanics of impurity removal. The results show that the overall mass transfer coefficient mainly depends on the temperature and the chamber pressure. Its value increases with the increase of temperature or the decrease of chamber pressure. Under the same melting condition, the order of the overall mass transfer coefficients for P, Al and Ca is kP > kAl > kCa, indicating that P can be easily removed by evaporation. The rate-controlling step changes gradually from mass transfer in the gas phase to mass transfer by evaporation then to mass transfer in the liquid boundary with the increase of temperature. At each transitional stage, there exists such a temperature range in which impurity removal is controlled by the combination of two steps. During electron beam melting, the removal of P is controlled by both evaporation on the gas–liquid interface and mass transfer in the liquid boundary layer, and the removal of Al and Ca is controlled by evaporation on the gas–liquid interface.
