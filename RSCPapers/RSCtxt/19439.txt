    , Accepted 29th September 2020First published on 7th October 2020AbstractFe-Doped Co–Mo–S microtubes were successfully synthesized through a multistep synthetic route, employing MoO3 microrods as the sacrificial template, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(SO4)2·7H2O as the metal sources, 2-methylimidazole (2-MI) as the ligand and thioacetamide (TAA) as the S2− ion source. The as-prepared products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), (high-resolution) transmission electron microscopy (TEM/HRTEM) and HAADF-STEM-EDS elemental mapping. Experiments showed that the as-obtained Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtube catalyst demanded overpotentials of ∼105 and 268 mV to afford the current density of −10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 10 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a durability of 60 h in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. In a two-electrode water-splitting device, the as-prepared Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes acted as both anode and cathode simultaneously. To deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, a cell voltage of 1.605 V was required in 1.0 M KOH solution. After continuously catalyzing the overall water splitting for 60 h, the overpotential hardly changed, implying remarkable long-term stability. Obviously, the present Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes have potential applications as bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of industrialization, the energy demand is dramatically growing. Since traditional fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, are running out, the energy crisis is becoming increasingly serious. Thus, it has become an urgent task to look for renewable, sustainable and green energies. Recently, some new renewable energy sources have attracted much attention, including solar energy, biomass energy, wind energy, hydrogen energy, and so on,1 especially hydrogen energy, which is recognized as clean energy with zero-carbon release.
At present, electrochemical water splitting has been one of the most important methods to produce hydrogen. Theoretically, a working voltage of 1.23 V is required to split water into hydrogen and oxygen by the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with two-electron transfer and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with four-electron transfer.2 However, the practical work voltage is usually far higher than the theoretic voltage owing to the presence of the huge energy barriers of H*/O* absorption/desorption process and mass transfer resistance during electrochemical water splitting.3–5 In particular, the OER reaction bears high overpotential (η) and is the major rate-limiting and sluggish step of the energy conversion system.6,7 Thus, the electrocatalyst is usually employed to promote water splitting reaction. The state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts and RuO2/IrO2-based catalysts are believed to possess high electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER,8 but their widely commercial applications are limited due to low earth content and high cost. Therefore, it is highly significant to find the robust catalysts with high catalytic activity, earth-abundance and low-cost to replace these noble metal catalysts in the practical application.
In recent years, transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have received considerable attention as important functional materials and water splitting catalysts due to their high conductivity, environmental kindness and cost-efficiency.9–11 Among various TMSs, cobalt sulfides are regarded as the highly active and promising alternative HER and OER catalysts.12,13 However, the slow ion migration kinetics of cobalt sulfides result in restricted performance and poor stability.14 Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is also paid considerable attention because of its interesting two-dimensional layered structure and outstanding HER electrocatalytic activity originated from the edges rather than the basal planes.15–17 Nevertheless, layered MoS2 has poor conductivity and limited active sites, which hamper electron transport and generate sluggish electrocatalytic kinetics,18,19 resulting in unsatisfactory OER activity. Distinctly, MoS2 merely exhibits a restricted performance for overall water splitting as the bifunctional electrocatalyst.20,21 Thus, it is still a challenge to develop a bifunctional electrocatalyst with distinguished HER and OER activity in chemistry and materials science fields.
Attractively, heterostructures usually display increased electrocatalytic activities over the single-phase counterpart due to the unique structural interaction and electronic transfer between the different components.9,22,23 Hence, constructing a heterogeneous structure with excellent HER and OER active materials will probably obtain a bifunctional electrocatalyst with outstanding electrocatalytic activity.24,25 Simultaneously, in order to regulate the electronic structure to enhance the conductivity of the catalyst, many strategies have been adopted, including element doping,26–28 electron modification,29 and semiconductor coupling,30 and so on. Among them, it is regarded as one of the most efficient approaches designing novel multicomponent materials by doping with foreign elements. Some studies have demonstrated that the electrocatalytic activity of metal sulfides could be improved by doping other transition metals (e.g., Fe, Co, and Ni) and regulating the electronic structures.26,28,31 In addition, the special hollow structures with low density and big surface area can probably improve the performances of the catalysts, too.32
Based on the above considerations, in this work, we designed a simple synthesis route to successfully prepare Fe-doped Co–Mo–S heterogeneous tubular microstructures. Experiments showed that as-obtained Fe-doped Co–Mo–S tubular microstructures possessed excellent electrocatalytic performances for HER and OER simultaneously. Overpotentials of ∼105/268 mV were needed to afford the current density of −10 mA cm−2 for HER or 10 mA cm−2 for OER with Tafel slopes of 50.3 and 79.3 mV dec−1, respectively. In a two-electrode device employing the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF as the anode and cathode simultaneously, only 1.605 V was required to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH solution; after continuous catalysis for 60 h, the overpotential hardly changed. Particularly, the present Fe-doped Co–Mo–S tubular microstructures exhibited the stronger electrocatalytic activity than commercial Pt/C–RuO2 catalysts at a current density of 158 mA cm−2, which have potential applications for overall water splitting as a bifunctional electrocatalyst.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals and materials
Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 99%), nitric acid (HNO3, 99%), cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%), methanol (CH3OH, 99%), ferrous sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O, 99%), 2-methylimidazole (C4H6N2, 2-MI, 99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99%), thioacetamide (TAA, 99%), and platinum on carbon (20% Pt/C) were purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) was bought from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. All reagents and chemicals were analytically pure and used without further purification. Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was obtained using a JL-RO100 Millipore-Q Plus water purifier and used throughout experiments.
2.2 Synthesis of MoO3 microrods
MoO3 microrods were obtained according to a previous report with minor modifications.33 Typically, 700 mg (∼0.57 mmol) of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and 2 mL of 98% HNO3 were added to 20 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring to form a uniform solution. After continuously stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the above solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated in an oven at 200 °C for 16 h. Subsequently, the system was cooled down to room temperature naturally. The white precipitates were washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol several times to remove the impurities, and dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h.
2.3 Synthesis of Fe-doped MoO3@ZIF-67 and MoO3@ZIF-67 microrods
In a typical experiment, the as-prepared MoO3 microrods (30 mg, ∼0.208 mmol) were added into 8 mL of Co(NO3)2·6H2O methanol solution (0.007 g mL−1) and then the as-obtained mixed system was ultrasonically treated for 15 min to form a homogeneous suspension. Next, 0.125 mL of FeSO4·7H2O methanol solution (0.011 g mL−1) was introduced into the above system under vigorous stirring at room temperature. Finally, 5 mL of a methanol solution of 2-methylimidazole (0.013 g mL−1) was added. The mixed system was continuously stirred at room temperature for 12 h to produce Fe-doped MoO3@ZIF-67 microstructures. The purple precipitates were washed with absolute ethanol several times to remove the impurities and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. Similarly, MoO3@ZIF-67 microrods were also prepared by the above method without adding FeSO4·7H2O methanol solution. It was worth pointing out that the optimum amount of FeSO4·7H2O methanol solution was determined by electrochemical tests. As shown in Fig. S1,† the product prepared from the system by adding 0.125 mL of 0.011 g mL−1 FeSO4·7H2O methanol solution possessed the best HER and OER catalytic activities.
2.4 Synthesis of Fe-doped Co–Mo–S and Co–Mo–S tubular microstructures
The above prepared Fe-doped MoO3@ZIF-67 or MoO3@ZIF-67 microrods were placed into an electric muffle furnace and calcined at 400 °C for 2 h in air at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. Fe-Doped MoO3@ZIF-67 or MoO3@ZIF-67 microrods were converted into Fe-doped MoO3@Co3O4 or MoO3@Co3O4 microrods. Subsequently, the as-obtained Fe-doped MoO3@Co3O4 or MoO3@Co3O4 microrods were dispersed into 30 mL of DMF and ultrasonically treated for 15 min. Then, 100 mg (∼1.33 mmol) of TAA was introduced. After continuously stirring for 30 min, the above suspension was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 20 h. Finally, the black precipitates were collected and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol several times to remove the impurities and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. The above preparation process is clearly illustrated in Scheme 1.

As controls, Mo–S and Co–S microstructures were also prepared. To obtain Mo–S microstructures, 30 mg (∼0.208 mmol) of MoO3 microrods and 100 mg (∼1.33 mmol) of TAA were introduced into 30 mL of DMF. The as-obtained mixed system was first ultrasonically dispersed for 15 min and then vigorously stirred for 30 min to form a homogeneous suspension. Finally, the suspension was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 200 °C for 20 h. To prepare Co–S microstructures, ZIF-67 polyhedrons were first synthesized by using 5.820 g (∼20.00 mmol) of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 6.568 g (∼80.00 mmol) of 2-methylimidazole as the reactants and methanol as the medium. The reaction to form ZIF-67 was carried out at room temperature by continually stirring for 12 h. Subsequently, the preparation process was similar to that of Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes.
2.5 Characterization
A Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154060 nm) was employed for the phase analyses of the products. The XRD patterns of the products were recorded in the 2θ range from 10° to 80° at a scanning rate of 0.2° s−1. FESEM images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope, operated at 5 kV. The EDX analyses were performed using a Hitachi S-8100 field emission scanning electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. TEM images of the samples were obtained using a Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscope employing an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. HRTEM images and SAED pattern of the samples were obtained using a JEOL-2011 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The elemental mapping images of the samples were obtained by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) using an FEI Talos F200X (Thermo Fisher Scientific). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to analyze the chemical state of the sample, which was carried out using a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi instrument with monochromic Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) at the power of 150 W. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent 7700s) was utilized to analyze the contents of various elements.
2.6 Electrochemical measurements
Before electrochemical measurements, the working electrodes were first prepared according to the previous report.34 Briefly, 70 wt% sample powders, 20 wt% carbon black and 10 wt% polymer binder (polyvinylidene fluoride, PVDF) were dispersed in n-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent to form a homogeneous slurry. A piece of Ni foam (NF, 1 × 2 cm2) was ultrasonically washed with ethanol and double distilled water for 30 min in turn. Then, the prepared slurry was pasted on the nickel foam (NF) and dried at 60 °C for 12 h under vacuum. The amount of active material loaded on the NF was ∼4 mg cm−2, which was calculated by subtracting the masses of NF, acetylene black and PVDF. In addition, as controls, the RuO2/NF and the Pt/C/NF electrodes were also prepared by a similar method.
All electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai, China) with a standard three-electrode system, employing the various NF-supported catalysts, the carbon rod and the Hg/HgO as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. According to the equation E(RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) + 0.927 V, the reference electrode for all measurements was calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale in 1.0 M KOH. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were conducted in 1.0 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 5.0 mV s−1 with 90% iR-compensation unless otherwise mentioned. The Tafel slope was obtained in a potential region at which the current was fully controlled by catalytic kinetics (non-mass transfer restriction), based on the Tafel equation: η = a + b·log(j). Where b is the Tafel slope, η and j are in turn the overpotential and the current densities, and a represents the intercept, which is related to the exchange current density. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in the scanning frequency region from 105 to 10−2 Hz with an amplitude of the sinusoidal voltage at 5 mV. The chronopotentiometric curves were continuously recorded for 60 h at a constant current density without iR-compensation. The electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) were determined from the double layer capacitances (Cdl), which was in proportion to Cdl, namely, ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs represents the specific capacitance assumed to be in the range of 0.022 and 0.130 mF cm−2 in the alkaline solution.35 The Cdl was measured through cyclic voltammetry in the non-faradaic potential region at the scan rates of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mV s−1, respectively. The Δj (= janode − jcathode) was calculated at 0.67 V (vs. RHE) for single CV cycle at each scan rate and then plotted against the scan rate. Then, a straight line was obtained and the slope of the line was two times as large as the Cdl.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and shape characterization
Fig. S2a† depicts the XRD patterns of the as-prepared MoO3 and Mo–S microrods. Although MoO3 has good crystallinity, Mo–S displays poor crystallinity. Nonetheless, a marked peak and a distinguishable weak peak appear at ∼9° and ∼18°, respectively. According to Yu and coworkers’ report, the above two peaks should be indexed as the (001) and (002) planes of a new unsolved MoS2 phase.36 To prove the formation of Mo–S after sulfurization, EDX analysis was employed. As seen in Fig. S2b,† the peaks of Mo, S, O and C elements were clearly visible and the atomic ratio of Mo/S was 1/2. The C peak should come from the conductive tape and the O peak should be attributed to the surface oxidized.37 The above results proved that MoS2 with poor crystallinity could be formed under the current experimental conditions through the reaction between MoO3 and TAA. Similarly, the formation of Co–S was also confirmed. As shown in Fig. S3a,† the purple ZIF-67 could be obtained and converted into the black Co3O4 by calcining at 400 °C in air. After Co3O4 was further sulfurized with TAA in DMF, the product with poor crystallinity was generated. The EDS analysis clearly displayed the presence of Co and S elements in an atomic ratio of 1:1 (see Fig. S3b†). The above facts demonstrated the amorphous nature of Co–S prepared under the current experimental conditions.

Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of the products before and after Fe-doping at various reaction stages. It is found that (b and c), (d and e) and (f and g) separately exhibit similar diffraction patterns, indicating that the integration of Fe atoms into the products prepared at various stages do not affect the microstructures of the products. Combining with the results shown in Fig. S1 and S2,† the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S and undoped Co–Mo–S with poor crystallinity can be formed under the present experimental conditions. Fig. S4† shows the EDS analyses of the final Co–Mo–S and Fe-doped Co–Mo–S. The peaks of Co, Mo, S, O and C elements can be detected in two products and their atomic ratios of Co/Mo/S are 1:4.34:9.91 and 1:4.59:9.45, respectively. The C and O peaks come from the conductive tape and the surface oxidized. No Fe peak is detected, implying an extremely low Fe-doping amount in the final product or failed doping. To prove successful Fe-doping, ICP-MS analysis was employed. As shown in Table S1,† only 0.4 atom% of Fe was integrated into Co–Mo–S.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the products before and after Fe-doping at various reaction stages. 
The morphological evolution of the products prepared at various stages was observed by the FESEM technology. From the low-magnification FESEM images shown in Fig. S5,† the products prepared at the former three stages presented similar long rod-like structures except the final product but the high-magnification images revealed that they had marked differences from each other (see Fig. 2a). Fig. 2a exhibits a typical FESEM image of original MoO3. Long microrods with smooth surfaces are clearly visible. After forming Fe-doped MoO3@ZIF-67, long microrods lose their smooth surfaces due to the loading of plentiful nanoparticles with ∼100 nm in size on MoO3 (see Fig. 2b). After further calcining in air at 400 °C for 2 h, the nanoparticles disappeared and microrods became smooth again (see Fig. 2c). However, the microrods presented obviously different outlines from the original smooth MoO3 microrods. A layer of new substances was coated on the surfaces of smooth MoO3 microrods, which originated from the formation of Co3O4. The morphology of the final product is displayed in Fig. 2d. Porous rod-like microstructures with openings in the ends can be readily seen (see white cycles in Fig. 2d), implying the hollow tubular structures. Moreover, Fig. S6† displays the typical FESEM images of undoped products obtained at various stages. One can readily find that undoped and Fe-doped products obtained at various stages possess same shapes, implying that the integration of small amounts of Fe atoms did not affect the morphology of the final product under the current experimental conditions. Moreover, Fig. S7† also exhibits the FESEM images of Co–S and Mo–S obtained by sulfurizing Co3O4 and MoO3 under the same experimental conditions. Obviously, after the components were separately sulfurized, the final M–S could not maintain the shape of the precursor well. The above facts show that the successful construction of MoO3@ZIF-67 hybrid structures results in the formation of the final Co–Mo–S microstructures with homogeneous morphology.

Fig. S8a–c† and Fig. 3a–c separately exhibit TEM, HRTEM images and SAED patterns of undoped and Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes prepared under the same experimental conditions. Both of them present hollow tubular microstructures constructed by numerous ultrathin nanosheets (see Fig. S8a† and Fig. 3a). In HRTEM images shown in Fig. S8b† and Fig. 3b, amorphous and crystalline regions can be readily distinguished. The d-spacing of neighboring planes in crystalline regions was measured to be ∼0.62 nm, which was very close to 0.61554 nm of the (002) plane of hexagonal 2H MoS2 by comparison with the data of JCPDS card files no.37–1492. Nevertheless, tubular microstructures still presented weak crystallinity, which was proven by the SAED patterns (see Fig. S8c† and Fig. 3c). Furthermore, several lattice dislocations/defects could be also observed in HRTEM images, which were labeled by red dotted lines. These lattice dislocations/defects should be induced by the interface engineering between Co–S and Mo–S, and could provide additional active sites for the electrocatalysis reactions. In addition, Fig. 3d shows the HAADF-STEM elemental mapping images of the as-constructed Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes. Fe, Co, Mo and S elements were detected and the distributions of various elements in the final products were homogeneous. The above elemental mapping analyses also further confirmed the successful integration of Fe atom into Co–Mo–S under the same preparation conditions.

The XPS technology further confirmed the formation of Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes. As shown in Fig. 4a, besides C and O peaks, Co, Mo, S and Fe peaks can be detected in the XPS survey spectrum of Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes. The C and O peaks are attributed to the adsorption of carbon species in air and the surface oxidation of metals, respectively. Fig. 4b shows the high resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p. Six peaks can be fitted. The peaks located at ∼778.6 and ∼793.6 eV correspond to Co3+ 2p3/2 and Co3+ 2p1/2 and those at ∼781.0 and ∼797.6 eV correspond to Co2+ 2p3/2 and Co2+ 2p3/2, which are associated with cobalt sulfide.38,39 The corresponding satellite peaks (labeled as “Sat.”) were located at ∼803.1 and ∼785.9 eV, respectively.39 Compared with those of the undoped microtubes shown in Fig. S9b,† the Co 2p peak sites of Fe-doped Co–Mo–S hardly change, implying that the integration of Fe did not affect the binding energy of Co. Fig. S9c† and Fig. 4c separately exhibit the Mo 3d XPS spectra of undoped and Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes. In two spectra, the peak at ∼225.6 eV is assigned to S 2s of MoS2,40 while the peaks at binding energies ∼228.1/228.2, 229.0/229.1, 231.3 and 231.9/232.0 eV are attributed to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of Mo4+.36,40–43 Moreover, the weak peak at ∼235.3 eV is attributed to Mo6+,44 which might be due to the oxidation of Mo4+ in the atmosphere or residual MoO3. The S 2p XPS spectra of the products before and after integrating Fe element also rarely vary (see Fig. S9d† and Fig. 4d). The peaks located at ∼161.0, 161.6, 162.2 and 163.2 eV correspond to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbitals of S2−,36,44,45 and the peak at ∼168.4 eV well match to the sulfur oxides (S–O) with a high valence state.46Fig. 4e depicts the Fe 2p XPS spectrum of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S. The peak at ∼714.2 eV is ascribed to the Fe3+ in the Fe3+–O,47,48 suggesting that Fe2+ has been oxidized in the final product.

3.2 HER performance of Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes

Fig. 5a depicts the LSV curves of various electrodes in 1.0 M KOH solution at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in a standard three-electrode system. The bare NFs exhibited a less-than-ideal electrocatalytic activity for HER. After the NFs were modified by various active catalysts, the HER electrocatalytic activity was markedly improved. At the current densities of −10 and −100 mA cm−2, the overpotentials of various modified electrodes were in turn 157 and 280 mV for the Co–S/NF, 165 and 224 mV for the Mo–S/NF, 118 and 193 mV for the Co–Mo–S/NF, 105 and 173 mV for the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF, and 31 and 117 mV for the Pt/C/NF electrode (see Fig. 5b). Compared to the Co–S/NF and the Mo–S/NF, the Co–Mo–S/NF electrode presented the obviously promoted catalytic activity, implying the existence of a synergistic effect between Co–S and Mo–S. Combining with the results of HRTEM analyses, many lattice dislocations and defects induced by the interface interaction between Co–S and Mo–S should provide additional active sites for the electrocatalysis reactions. Moreover, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF owned the stronger HER catalytic activity than the Co–Mo–S/NF, implying that the doping of Fe further increased the number of active sites and the intrinsic activity of the Co–Mo–S microtubes.

(d) Nyquist plots of the Co–S/NF, the Mo–S/NF, the Co–Mo–S/NF, and the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrodes recorded at the overpotential of −130 mV. (e) LSV curves of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode before and after 1000 cycles. (f) Chronopotentiometric curve of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode at the current density of −20 mA cm−2 for 60 h without iR compensation in 1.0 M KOH solution. 
Generally, the Tafel slope can reflect catalytic kinetics of a catalyst. A smaller Tafel slope often indicates more favorable HER kinetics of the catalyst. Fig. 5c displays the Tafel plots of the above various catalysts/NF electrodes from which the catalytic kinetics of various catalysts can be assessed. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, the Tafel slopes of various electrodes were separately 119.5 mV dec−1 for the Co–S/NF, 56.9 mV dec−1 for the Mo–S/NF, 54.6 mV dec−1 for the Co–Mo–S/NF, 50.3 mV dec−1 for the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF and 36.5 mV dec−1 for the Pt/C/NF. Obviously, besides the Pt/C/NF electrode, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode owned the smallest Tafel slope, implying its superior HER catalytic kinetics. At the same time, to further study the electrode kinetics and interface reactions, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses of the above various catalysts were performed. Generally, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) is related to the electrocatalytic kinetics. The small Rct value shows the beneficial electron transport at the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode. Fig. 5d shows the Nyquist plots of various electrodes. The order of the semicircle diameters for various electrodes from small to big is Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF < Co–Mo–S/NF < Mo–S/NF < Co–S/NF. Owing to the positive correlation between Rct and the semicircle diameter, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode owned the smallest Rct, indicating that the successful integration of Fe element into Co–Mo–S microtubes promoted the electrocatalytic activity of HER reaction. Also, the as-prepared Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode exhibited good cycle stability. As shown in Fig. 5e, the LSV curves before and after 1000 cycles in 1.0 M KOH solution almost overlap each other. Furthermore, a multi-step chronopotentiometric curve of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode is given in Fig. S10a.† Upon altering the current density of −10 mA cm−2 per 500 s, the potential immediately jumped and rapidly leveled off. Similar phenomena were repeated at the other steps within the region from −10 to −100 mA cm−2. Moreover, the presence of Fe-doped Co–Mo–S catalyst also presented good durability. As seen in Fig. 5f, the overpotential only slightly increased after continuously catalyzing for 60 h in 1.0 M KOH at the current density of −20 mA cm−2. The above experimental facts indicated that the present Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode possessed the excellent conductivity, mass transportation and mechanical robustness. Table S2† compares the HER catalytic performances of our electrocatalyst with some reported ones. The present as-prepared catalyst possesses close or stronger catalytic activity, indicating its potential in practical applications.
3.3 OER performance of Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes
It was found that the as-synthesized hollow Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes also presented good OER catalytic activity in the alkaline solution. Fig. 6a shows the polarization curves of the bare NF, the Mo–S/NF, the Co–S/NF, the Co–Mo–S/NF, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF and the RuO2/NF electrodes in 1.0 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Similar to the HER, the bare NF electrode displayed ignorable OER electrocatalytic activity and the catalyst-modified NF ones presented improved OER electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, at current densities above ∼168 mA cm−2, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF owned better catalytic activity than RuO2/NF. Fig. 6b compares the overpotentials of various electrodes required to drive the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2. In 1.0 KOH solution, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF separately needed 268 and 339 mV, lower than 366 and 459 mV of the Mo–S/NF, 330 and 441 mV of the Co–S/NF, and 302 and 413 mV of the Co–Mo–S/NF, and only higher than the 190 and 330 mV of the RuO2/NF. At 200 mA cm−2, however, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF merely required the overpotential of 391 mV, smaller than 410 mV of the RuO2/NF and 449 mV of the Co–Mo–S/NF. The above fact implies that the present Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes are the better OER electrocatalyst than the commercial RuO2 one at the high current density.

(d) Nyquist plots of the Mo–S/NF, the Co–S/NF, the Co–Mo–S/NF, and the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrodes recorded at the overpotential of 280 mV. (e) LSV curves of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode before and after 1000 CV cycles. (f) Chronopotentiometric curves of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode at the current density of 20 mA cm−2 for 60 h without iR compensation in 1.0 M KOH solution. 

Fig. 6c depicts the Tafel plots of various electrodes for OER. The Tafel slopes of the RuO2/NF, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF, the Co–Mo–S/NF, the Co–S/NF and the Mo–S/NF electrodes were in turn 123.4, 79.3, 94.1 102.7 and 109.6 mV dec−1. The Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode owned the smallest Tafel slope, indicating its rapid OER catalytic dynamics. Fig. 6d shows the Nyquist plots of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF, the Co–Mo–S/NF, the Co–S/NF and the Mo–S/NF electrodes, which were recorded under the overpotential of 280 mV in 1.0 M KOH solution. The Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode owned the smallest semicircle diameter, implying its smallest Rct. The above experimental facts clearly demonstrated that the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes also possessed the best OER electrocatalytic activity. Similarly, the as-prepared Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode also displayed excellent cycling stability and long-term stability. After 1000 CV cycles (see Fig. 6e) or continuously electro-catalyzing for 60 h at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6f), the overpotentials slightly increased. Moreover, a multi-step chronopotentiometric curve of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode for OER was also measured in 1.0 M KOH solution in the current density range of 10–100 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. S10b,† the potential was maintained for 500 s at the initial current density of 10 mA cm−2; and then increasing the current density of 10 mA cm−2 per 500 s, the potential immediately hopped and rapidly leveled off. A similar phenomena lasted upto a current density of 100 mA cm−2. The above facts uncovered that the present Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode had the excellent conductivity, mass transportation and mechanical robustness in OER. Furthermore, compared to some reported OER catalysts, the present Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode also presented close or stronger electrocatalytic performances (see Table S3†).
Fig. S11† displays the representative FESEM images of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes catalyst after continuously catalyzing for 60 h for HER and OER durability tests. Since some additives, including the carbon black, polymer binder (PVDF) and n-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP), were added while preparing the working electrode, some aggregated grains were observed. For HER, the configuration of the catalyst was well maintained except the slight surface corrosion (see Fig. S11a†). For OER, the morphology of the catalyst markedly retrograded (see Fig. S11b†), which should be ascribed to the oxidation of the catalyst during OER measurement. Nonetheless, the outline of the catalyst could be still distinguished. The above FESEM observations confirmed the excellent mechanical robustness of the catalyst, which resulted in outstanding cycling stability and long-term stability. Distinctly, it was very important for the practical application of the as-obtained the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode. Furthermore, the composition and valence state changes of the catalyst after 60 h of durability tests were also investigated by XPS technology. Fig. S12† depicts the survey and high resolution spectra of the catalyst after the durability test for HER. Besides the peaks of Co, Mo, S and Fe elements, the peak of F 1s is detected in the survey spectrum (Fig. S12a†), which should be derived from the PVDF added while preparing the working electrode. In high resolution XPS spectra of Co, Mo, S and Fe, the peak sites hardly varied against those before the durability test, implying no change in the composition. However, it was noteworthy that the peak intensity of Co 2p had slight differences before and after the durability test. After a 60 h HER test, the peak intensities of Co3+ decreased and those of Co2+ rose (see Fig. S12b†), implying the reduction of Co3+ ions in HER measurements. The survey and high resolution spectra of the catalyst after the durability test for OER were displayed in Fig. S13.† Compared with the spectra before OER tests, some obvious differences could be found. In the survey spectrum (Fig. S13a†), a strong peak of F 1s originated from PVDF and the Mo 3d and S 2p peaks dramatically weakened. In Co 2p spectrum shown in Fig. S13b,† the binding energy sites at ∼780.5 and 796.1 eV were attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co2+.49 Obviously, the peak positions of Co2+ shifted to the lower binding energy, indicating the oxidation of the surface Co2+ after continuous OER tests.50 The other four peaks centered at ∼779.5, 784.6, 789.0 and 794.6 eV corresponded to Co3+.49,51,52 In the Mo 3d spectrum shown in Fig. S13c,† the intensity decrease of Mo 3d after long-term OER tests suggested the reduction of Mo content53 and the peak at the binding energy of ∼231.9 eV was assigned to Mo4+ and the one at ∼235.3 eV was attributed to Mo6+.44 After the electrochemical test, the peaks at 161.0–163.3 eV corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of S2− disappeared (see Fig. S13d†) and only two peaks at ∼168.0 and ∼169.0 eV corresponding to oxidized sulfur were detected,54 implying the complete oxidation of S2− ions during OER measurement. Compared to the XPS analysis of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes before long-term OER test, the Fe 2p spectrum after the durability test rarely changed (see Fig. S13e†). The above XPS analyses uncovered that the oxides/hydroxides formed by in situ electrochemical oxidization acted as the electrocatalytical active species for OER.30
Generally, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is another important parameter to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of a catalyst. The catalyst with a big ECSA usually possesses more active sites and is favorable to the dissipation of the gas bubbles produced in the OER and HER, resulting in high electrocatalytic activity.55,56 To obtain the ECSA of a catalyst, the cyclic voltammetries (CV) in a non-faradaic region at different scan rates are first measured. Fig. S14† shows the CV curves of the Co–S/NF, the Mo–S/NF, the Co–Mo–S/NF, and the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrodes in the potential window of 0.62–0.72 V (vs. RHE) at the scan rates of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mV s−1, respectively. At the same scan rate, obviously, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode possessed the biggest current density. Fig. 7a displays the linear relation between the scan rate and the Δj (= janodic − jcathodic) value at 0.67 V (vs. RHE) for every electrode. Since the slope of the line is twice as big as the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), the calculated Cdl values of the electrodes were 7.63 mF cm−2 for the Mo–S/NF, 12.92 mF cm−2 for the Co–S/NF, 26.75 mF cm−2 for the Co–Mo–S/NF and the 41.43 mF cm−2 for Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF, respectively. Owing to the proportional relation between ECSA and Cdl expressed as ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs was assumed to be 0.040 mF cm−2 in the alkaline solution according to ref. 35, the as-prepared Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes catalyst had the biggest ECSA. The corresponding ECSA values were calculated to be ∼1036 and 669 for Fe-doped Co–Mo–S and Co–Mo–S electrodes, respectively. Based on the equation AElect = AGeom × ECSA (AGeom = 1.0 cm2),57 the specific surface areas of various electrodes could be obtained. Undoubtedly, the as-prepared Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtube catalyst exhibited the biggest specific surface area, demonstrating that the as-prepared Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtube catalyst could produce more ion-accessible sites for HER and OER than the other catalysts. Fig. 7b and c separately compares the LSV curves of Fe-doped and undoped Co–Mo–S/NF electrodes normalized by ECSA during HER and OER. The Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode presents the smaller overpotential at the same current density, indicating the better intrinsic activity of the as-prepared Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes.
 Fig. 7  (a) Correlations between the Δj (= janodic − jcathodic) and the scan rates of various electrodes; (b) LSV curves of Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF and Co–Mo–S/NF electrodes normalized by ECSA during HER; (c) LSV curves of Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF and Co–Mo–S/NF electrodes normalized by ECSA during OER. 
Since the as-prepared Fe-doped Co–Mo–S catalyst simultaneously possessed good catalytic performances for HER and OER, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode was used as both anode and cathode in a two-electrode setup for overall water splitting. As control, the Pt/C/NF(−)//RuO2/NF(+) electrode and the bare NF electrode were employed as the cathode and anode, too. Fig. 8a shows the LSV curves of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF(−//+), the Pt/C/NF(−)//RuO2/NF(+) and the bare NF(−//+) electrodes in 1.0 M KOH for overall water splitting at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The bare NF(−//+) electrode only exhibited an ignorable electrocatalytic activity and the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF(−//+) presented improved catalytic activity. The Pt/C/NF(−)//RuO2/NF(+) electrode exhibited stronger catalytic activity than the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF(−//+) one at the current density below ∼158 mA cm−2; above this value, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF(−//+) presented better electrocatalytic performance. The above fact suggested that our electrode was more suitable for use at higher current densities than that of the commercial Pt/C/NF–RuO2/NF electrode. Fig. 8b shows the overpotential histograms of various working electrodes at the current densities of 10, 100 and 200 mA cm−2, respectively. To drive a current density of 10 or 100 mA cm−2, the overpotentials of various working electrodes were in turn 220/555 mV for the Pt/C/NF(−)//RuO2/NF(+), 375/590 mV for the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF(−//+), and 653/895 mV for the NF(−//+) in 1.0 M KOH solution. A cell voltage of 1.605 V was needed for the present Fe-doped Co–Mo–S electrocatalyst to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2. At a higher current density of 200 mA cm−2, more importantly, the present Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF(−//+) electrode only needed the overpotential of 660 mV, which was superior to the Pt/C/NF(−)//RuO2/NF(+) one. The above results proved that the present Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode exhibited excellent overall water splitting electrocatalytic activity at higher current densities. Fig. 8c shows the chronopotentiometric curve of the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF electrode recorded in the two-electrode setup with 1.0 M KOH. At a constant current density of 20 mA cm−2, the voltage barely varied after continuous electrocatalysis for 60 h, implying that the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S/NF had good catalytic durability. Also, compared with some recent electrocatalysts reported in the literature (see Table S4†), the present Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtube catalysts presented close or better electrocatalytic performances for the overall water splitting. Furthermore, the present overall water splitting setup could be driven by a commercial solar cell panel of 1.5–1.6 V. As seen from Fig. S15,† a great deal of H2 and O2 bubbles escaped from the anode and cathode simultaneously. At the same time, a Hoffman apparatus instrument was employed for collecting the produced H2 and O2 gases (see Fig. S16†).58 At the current density of 100 mA cm−2, the collected amounts of H2 and O2 gases well matched with the theoretically calculated values, respectively, implying a faradaic efficiency of ∼100% (see Fig. 8d).

4. Conclusions
In summary, Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes with superb HER and OER electrocatalytic activity have been successfully synthesized through a multistep synthetic strategy. Owing to the interface engineering interaction between Co–S and Mo–S, the as-prepared Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes possessed many lattice dislocations/defects that could provide additional active sites for the electrocatalysis reactions. Also, the incorporation of small amounts of Fe improved the electronic conductivity and catalytic activity of Co–Mo–S microtubes. Experiments showed that the as-obtained Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtube catalyst demanded overpotentials of ∼105 mV or ∼268 mV to afford the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the HER or OER with long-term durability for 60 h in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. In a two-electrode water-splitting device, the Fe-doped Co–Mo–S microtubes could act as both anode and cathode simultaneously for overall water splitting, only requiring a cell voltage of 1.605 V to afford a 10 mA cm−2 of current density with remarkable long-term stability for 60 h. Intriguingly, the present Fe-doped Co–Mo–S tubular microstructures owned the stronger electrocatalytic activity than commercial Pt/C–RuO2 catalysts at the current density of above 158 mA cm−2. Obviously, the present Fe-doped o–Mo–S microtubes have potential applications as bifunctional electrocatalysts for full water splitting at the higher current density.
