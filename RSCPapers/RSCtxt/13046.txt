    , Accepted 25th June 2020First published on 20th July 2020AbstractThe near UV-visible light-absorbing organic carbon (OC) of ambient aerosols, referred to here as brown carbon (BrC), significantly influences the atmospheric radiative forcing on both regional and global scales. Here, we documented BrC absorption in the aqueous and methanol extracts of marine aerosols collected over the Bay of Bengal (BoB: September–October 2017) and a city, Visakhapatnam (May–June 2018), in southern India during the southwest monsoon (i.e., a transition period with weak continental impact). The absorption spectra of BrC over the BoB showed several peaks around 300–400 nm and differ from those observed over Visakhapatnam. The absorption coefficient of BrC over the BoB, unlike Visakhapatnam data, does not seem to covary with other chemical proxies of biomass burning (non-sea-salt or nss-K+) and coal combustion (nss-SO42−) in the continental outflows, suggesting a different source of BrC over the BoB. Besides, we observed higher proportions of water-insoluble organic carbon (WIOC/OC: 0.89 ± 0.02) and significant enrichment of Mg2+ over Na+ (i.e., relative to seawater) in BoB aerosols. This result and the backward air mass trajectories both hinted their major source of OC from marine-derived organic matter. In contrast, the absorption spectra of BrC over Visakhapatnam are like those from biomass burning emissions in the Indo-Gangetic Plain. This observation is further supported by the satellite-based fire counts and backward air mass trajectories. Therefore, our study underscores the BrC aerosols from the oceanic sources and southern India, hitherto unknown, and can improve our understanding of the regional climate effects of carbonaceous aerosols if included in models.

Environmental significance
Some organic carbon (OC) aerosols absorb sunlight in the near UV-visible region, so called brown carbon (BrC), and exert significant climate effects on both regional/global scales. We report here, for the first time, the presence of BrC over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the southwest monsoon (i.e., during weak influence from continents). The water/methanol-extracts of marine aerosols showed distinct peaks (∼300–400 nm), suggesting the presence of BrC. Besides, these aerosols have high proportions of water-insoluble organic carbon (89% OC) and a significant enrichment of Mg2+ over Na+ (i.e., relative to seawater). This means BrC-aerosols can originate from the ocean surface along with sea salts and contribute to regional radiative forcing of carbonaceous aerosols in the South Asian outflow.

1. Introduction
Light-absorbing organic aerosols (aka brown carbon: BrC) have recently gained considerable attention among the scientific peers due to their potential influence on both regional and global climate via direct (i.e. by their absorbing nature) and indirect effects (i.e. evaporating the clouds once dissolved and, thus, affecting cloud lifetime).1–4 BrC includes a class of organic compounds present in ambient air, which show prominent UV-visible light absorption (i.e. between 300 and 700 nm).5–7 These aerosols can be directly emitted from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, industrial processes, domestic heating, and biomass burning8–11 and secondarily formed by the oxidation of volatile organic compounds of anthropogenic and biogenic origins.12–17 Primary and secondary aerosols from biomass burning emissions are shown to be a major source of BrC on regional and global scales.6,15,18–21 Humic-like substances (HULIS) account for an important fraction of primary BrC.15 Their optical properties depend on various atmospheric processes (e.g., chemical reactions, changes in solar irradiation and relative humidity),22–24 which make the identification of individual BrC species very difficult.
Despite the ubiquitous occurrence of BrC aerosols, there is growing interest to study their sources, absorption characteristics, and transformations in detail over South and East Asia due to the current increase in anthropogenic activities (e.g., biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion).7,25,26 To this date, studies focusing on BrC aerosols over South Asia have been, in particular, limited to the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and its outflow to the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and the northern Indian Ocean (NIO) during the early and late northeast monsoon (December–April).20,27–34 These studies have mostly attributed the sources of BrC aerosols to postharvest crop-residue burning emissions in the northwest IGP (e.g., Punjab and Haryana). However, the BoB and NIO witness the impact of continental outflows mostly from the IGP, but with some contribution from coastal cities in the southern part of the Indian peninsula.35,36 Recent studies have documented the presence of coloured dissolved organic matter (aka CDOM) in the surface water of the BoB and these compounds have near UV-visible absorption between 300 nm and 600 nm similar to that of continental BrC.37,38
The oceanic CDOM can be incorporated into the sea salt aerosols and can be reinforced by the strong seasonal winds over the BoB, where their contribution could affect the overall absorption properties and radiative forcing of carbonaceous aerosols in the marine atmosphere. However, studies documenting the presence of marine-derived BrC over the BoB are so far lacking in the literature. In this study, our major goal was to ascertain whether such ocean-derived BrC contributes to atmospheric aerosols collected over the BoB and a coastal city, Visakhapatnam, during the southwest monsoon. Furthermore, the absorption spectra of BrC and other associated optical properties from this study were compared with those typically observed for the wintertime aerosols from the BoB and the CDOM data from the estuarine water draining into the BoB.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Site description and prevailing meteorology
The BoB is one of the two limbs of the NIO and is located on the eastern side of peninsular India. During the southwest monsoon, the BoB receives immense freshwater supply from mighty rivers such as Ganga and Brahmaputra. Consequently, a large amount of terrigenous particulate matter from these rivers, strong stratification of freshwater, and intense cloud cover during the southwest monsoon season make the BoB poorly ventilated and, thus, contribute to low primary productivity.39,40 In contrast, the cyclonic eddies often bring nutrient-rich subsurface water to the sunlit surface ocean during spring (April–May) and fall seasons (September–October) and, thus, help phytoplankton productivity thrive.41,42 Additionally, the BoB experiences a seasonal reversal of prevailing meteorology between winter/spring and summer/fall seasons. The continental outflow from the IGP acts like a conduit of air pollutants (and BrC) to the marine atmosphere of the BoB during the northeast monsoon (predominantly in winter).25–27,29 In contrast, winds blow mostly from the ocean to the land during the southwest monsoon season, and, hence, we could expect a lower influence from the anthropogenic emissions (or BrC) over the BoB.27,43
Recent studies have documented the abundance of CDOM in the coastal and offshore water of the BoB.37,38 In such a case, CDOM could be emitted along with sea-spray aerosols and, hence, contributes to the absorption of carbonaceous aerosols over the BoB. Therefore, we focused on whether there exists any such BrC-like material in the marine atmospheric boundary layer of the BoB during the southwest monsoon. This is achieved by looking at the BrC absorption signals in two sets of PM10 aerosols (i.e. aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm): (i) those collected onboard research vessel Sindhu Sankalp during the cruise in the BoB (SSK105: 23 September to 4 October 2017) and (ii) from a coastal urban location, Visakhapatnam in southern India (Fig. 1a).

Here, the colour scale indicates the height of air mass back trajectories expressed in meters. The red dots in panel (a) correspond to the midpoint latitude and longitude of cruise tracks used for PM10 collection in the BoB. 
2.2. Aerosol collection and analysis of WSOC
We collected eight PM10 samples from the BoB along with three field blanks on precombusted Tissuquartz filters (PALLFLEX®™, baked at 450 °C for 8 h) from 23 September to 4 October 2017. The PM10 air sampler (Envirotech, flowrate ≈ 1.0 m3 min−1) was installed on the front deck of the research vessel, Sindhu Sankalp, to avoid any potential contamination from the ship's exhaust and was operated only when the ship speed was more than 10–12 knots per h. The SSK105 cruise was conducted in the offshore water of the BoB and more details regarding the sampling times and other information are provided in Table S1.† Nine PM10 samples were also collected using the same PM10 air sampler that was set up on the rooftop of the five-storey building (∼20 m above MSL) of the National Institute of Oceanography Regional Center (NIORC) in Visakhapatnam (Fig. 1a) from 16 May to 4 June 2018. Of these samples, the first two filter samples were collected as pilot runs to see whether we could detect any meaningful BrC absorption signal or not by using a 24 and 12 h integrated high-volume aerosol samples during summertime over Visakhapatnam. After looking at the absorption spectrum of BrC from these aerosol filters, we decided to collect aerosol samples only during the nighttime to avoid or minimize the influences from local traffic. All other PM10 samples from Visakhapatnam were collected mostly during nighttime (18:00–06:00; Table S2†) when the air masses blow from the oceanic region (sea breeze).
After collection, aerosol filters were sealed in airtight Ziploc bags and stored at −20 °C until further analysis. For the measurement of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), ∼10.05 cm2 area of the filter cut was extracted with ultrapure deionized water (Milli-Q; specific resistivity > 18.2 MΩ cm). The extract was subsequently filtered using a precleaned 10 ml glass syringe connected to a disc filter (Millex-GV, 0.22 μm) and the filtrate was injected into a total organic carbon analyzer (Model TOC-Vcsh, Shimadzu) for the determination of WSOC as non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC). In the TOC analyzer, the dissolved organic carbon is catalytically oxidized under high temperature to CO2, which is quantified by using a nondispersive infrared detector (NDIR). The TOC instrument was calibrated using gravimetrically prepared potassium hydrogen phthalate standard dilutions.44
2.3. Absorption properties of BrC
A portion of the PM10 sample (∼45 mm dia.) was extracted with ∼35 ml of organic free ultrapure deionized water. Likewise, ∼4–6 circular filter punches of PM10 samples (∼20 mm dia.) were extracted with ∼25 ml methanol in precombusted glass tubes using ultrasonic agitation (10 min × 3 times). These solvent extracts were centrifuged and filtered through a 0.7 μm Whatman GF/F filter and the absorption spectra were recorded between 200 and 700 nm using a UV-visible spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-Vis 1800 model). However, we only showed the absorption spectra from 300 nm to 700 nm to consistently compare with the literature measurements. The absorbance of water- and methanol-extracts at 365 nm relative to 700 nm is used to estimate the absorption coefficient of water- and methanol-soluble BrC (babs-H2O/MeOH-BrC-365 nm; expressed in M m−1; M = 106).27,45 (1)
In eqn (1), A365 nm and A700 nm correspond to measured absorbances at 365 nm and 700 nm, respectively. Vextract refers to the volume of organic free ultrapure deionized water or organic solvent used for extraction and Vair is the volume of air filtered (expressed in m3), respectively. Likewise, l is the path length of the cell (i.e. 1 cm) used for light absorption measurement. Although the entire absorption spectrum between 300 nm and 700 nm was obtained, we only used 365 nm to quantify the babs-H2O/MeOH-BrC-365 nm to compare our results with the existing literature on BrC studies over South Asia and elsewhere. This implies that babs-BrC can be computed for other wavelengths also. The babs-H2O/MeOH-BrC values are somewhat dependent on the wavelength in a power relation (eqn (2)) and the power exponent is referred to as “absorption ångström exponent (AAEBrC)”.6,7,10,34,46–48 babs-H2O/MeOH-BrC-λ (M m−1) ∝ λ−AAEBrC(2)
The babs-H2O-BrC-365 nm is normalized with the mass concentration of WSOC would provide mass absorption efficiency (MAEBrC-365 nm, in the units of m2 g−1). (3) (4)
For this study, we have also measured the absorption spectra of solvent blanks (i.e., Milli-Q water and methanol) before measuring the aerosol extracts for BrC-absorption. No measurable absorption was found for the solvent blanks. The solvent extract-based BrC absorption properties are not directly representative of their particle characteristics in the ambient atmosphere. Hence, we cannot directly compare the absorption coefficient and mass absorption efficiency of water- or methanol-soluble BrC in ambient aerosols with that of other strongly absorbing particulate elemental carbon (EC).6 It is, therefore, a prerequisite to translate or convert the solvent extractable BrC optical properties to their ambient aerosol particles.6 For the Rayleigh regime (i.e. for small particles), Sun et al.49 have suggested a conversion factor (ξ) ≈ 0.7 where the size parameter of aerosols is far less than one (i.e. πd/λ ≪1; d = particle diameter). Alternatively, Liu et al.50 compared the Mie theory-based MAEBrC in the particulate phase with bulk solution derived BrC absorption properties and found that the latter approach (i.e. solvent-extractable BrC) significantly underestimates the MAEBrC by a factor of two. Given the broad disparity between these studies, the direct use of either of these conversion factors for upscaling/downscaling the measured BrC absorption from the solvent extract would affect reciprocally and may not alter the interpretations in this study. Accordingly, we have not scaled our MAEBrC values based on the water- and methanol-extracts (i.e. according to eqn (5), where ξ ≈ 1; for this study), but instead directly compared with MAEEC to estimate the imaginary component of the refractive index of BrC as well as relative radiative forcing efficiency of BrC over EC (see Section 3.5). MACaero-BrC(λ) = ξ × MAEBrC-MeOH/H2O(λ)(5)
The light-extinction caused by a BrC substance in the atmosphere can be well described by the complex refractive index (μ ≈ m + ik), where the real (m) and imaginary (k) parts refer to scattering and absorbing effects, respectively.49,51,52 The MAE of BrC at a measured wavelength (λ = 365 nm) from methanol and water-extracts of PM10 samples can, thus, be translated to estimate their imaginary refractive index of BrC according to eqn (6) and (7).50 (6) (7)
Here, ‘ρ is the density of BrC aerosols (expressed in g cm−3). Sumlin et al.53 reported ‘ρ’ values between 0.8 and 1.2 g cm−3 for biomass burning derived BrC particles. Rissler et al.54 estimated the particle density of light-absorbing OC in an urban atmosphere as 1.4 g cm−3. Likewise, Mok et al.55 have used a particle density of 1.2 g cm−3 for assessing the impact of BrC absorption from Amazonian biomass burning emissions on surface UV and ozone photochemistry. Reid et al.56 have determined the density of smoke particles (1.2–1.4 g cm−3) emitted from biomass burning emissions. In contrast, Shamjad et al.32 have used a somewhat higher value of particle density of organic carbon 1.5 g cm−3 for assessing the kBrC over the central IGP. Given the broad range of particle density values for the light-absorbing OC in the literature, we, therefore, used a ‘ρ’ value of BrC aerosols (1.4 ± 0.1 g cm−3) for assessing the kBrC.
2.4. Carbonaceous species-mass absorption efficiency of elemental carbon (EC)
We analyzed the mass concentrations of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) in PM10 samples using the thermo-optical transmittance (TOT) method on a semi-continuous Sunset carbon analyzer (i.e. operated in offline mode) at Chubu University, Japan, according to the procedures described in Miyazaki et al.57. The accuracy of the semicontinuous analyzer for the total carbon content was periodically assessed (i.e. within 10%) by using gravimetrically prepared sucrose and potassium hydrogen phthalate standards. Furthermore, we used the light-absorption data of EC from the semi-continuous Sunset carbon analyzer for determining the mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of EC according to the analytical protocol described by Ram and Sarin.58 Briefly, the laser transmission signal (here λ = 660 nm) from the Sunset carbon analyzer (or attenuation, ATN) can be used to estimate the MAE of EC using the following mathematical expressions. bATN-EC-660 (Mm−1) = ATNEC-660 × Afilter/Vair(8) babs-EC-660 (Mm−1) = bATN-EC-660 (Mm−1)/[C × R(ATN)](9)where bATN-EC-660 and babs-EC-660 are the attenuation and absorption coefficients, respectively, and M = 106. Vair is the volume of air sampled (i.e. expressed in m3) through a filter (Afilter: ∼405 cm2). To obtain the babs-EC-660, bATN-EC-660 needs to be corrected for the filter loading effect (R(ATN)) and the multiple scattering effect (C), respectively. R(ATN) is based on the empirical relationships initially suggested by Weingartner et al.59 for the Aethalometer and later used by Ram and Sarin58 for assessing the MAEEC based on the light attenuation and mass concentration of EC.58 The parameter C is due to the lensing effect of sulfate and organics on EC as this causes enhancement in the absorption, whereas R(ATN) is the reduction in absorption of EC embedded in the filter depths across the light path of the aerosol filter. Ram and Sarin58 have suggested a ‘C’ value between 2.1 and 5.0 for the externally and internally mixed type of EC, respectively. As samples were collected from distant locations and also EC is likely a mixture of both internally/externally mixed types, we chose an intermediate value of 3.6 for C. Besides, R(ATN) is calculated based on the following mathematic expression. (10)
Weingartner et al.59 have proposed to use an ‘f’ value of 1.103 and 1.14 for the presence of internally and externally mixed EC aerosols. For this study, we used an ‘f’ value of 1.103 for the samples with ATN more than 10% (i.e., because aerosols were collected over the BoB) and ‘f’ ≈ 1 for ATN < 10%.58 We estimated the MAEEC-660 by normalizing the babs-EC-660 with the mass concentration of EC (in μg m−3) as described in eqn (11) given below. MAEEC-660 (m2 g−1) = babs-EC-660 (Mm−1)/[EC (μg m−3)](11)
Uncertainty analysis was also conducted for the optical properties of BrC based on the Monte Carlo simulation of error propagation (MCEP). For this, we used the external precision of absorbance (<20%), air volume filtered (<3%), and WSOC and OC concentrations (<10%) as errors in the MCEP-based calculation of babs-H2O/MeOH-BrC-365 nm, MAEH2O/MeOH-BrC-365 nm and kBrC-H2O/MeOH (Table S3†).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Backward air mass trajectory analysis
The air mass backward trajectory analysis provides crucial information about the likely contribution of source emissions to BrC aerosols collected over the BoB and Visakhapatnam. We computed 7 day isentropic air mass backward trajectories (BTs) for the sampling days at the midpoint of cruise tracks using archived meteorological data sets from the NOAA Air Resources Llaboratory on a PC-based hybrid single particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory model (HYSPLIT, version 4.0).60 The BTs were computed at 100 m above sea level during the SSK105 cruise mostly showed marine origin (Fig. 1b; i.e. from the NIO), indicating the likely influence of organic matter associated with seasalt aerosols. It is also worth mentioning that the height of BTs for the PM10 samples collected during the SSK105 cruise when passing over southern India was increased to ∼500–1500 m (Fig. S1†) and, hence, less likely influenced by the ground-level emissions of biomass burning (BB). Likewise, the 7 day isentropic air mass BTs over Visakhapatnam showed a mixed influence of oceanic and continental sources (Fig. 1c), in particular, originated from the northwestern IGP. Coincidently, the sampling period overlaps with the occurrence of postharvest crop-residue burning emissions (e.g., wheat-crop-residue: late April–early May) over the IGP. Therefore, we have examined the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite-based fire count data for the sampling period (Fig. 1d). Combining the BTs and MODIS fire counts, we could expect that aerosols over Visakhapatnam during May–June 2018 have been influenced by the wheat residue burning emissions in the IGP. Therefore, the observed BrC aerosol absorption over Visakhapatnam (if any) could likely be contributed by these open biomass burning events.
3.2. Absorption spectra of BrC – relationship with chemical tracers
The absorption coefficient of BrC at 365 nm assessed from the water and methanol extracts of aerosols (babs-BrC-H2O-365 nm and babs-BrC-MeOH-365 nm) collected over the BoB was lower than that observed over Visakhapatnam (Table 1). This implies that PM10 samples from Visakhapatnam have abundant and different chromophores compared to those from the BoB. Besides, the absorption coefficient of water/methanol-soluble BrC over the BoB (Fig. 2a and b) showed several peaks across the measured wavelength range (300–700 nm) unlike those observed over Visakhapatnam (Fig. 2c and d). This observation also suggests a likely difference in contributing sources of BrC aerosols between the BoB and Visakhapatnam. This argument is further strengthened by the similarity in the wavelength-dependent absorption spectra of BrC from Visakhapatnam with the biomass burning influenced aerosols from the IGP/IGP-outflow (Fig. S2†).25,61 Coincidently, air mass BTs, the MODIS-VIIRS fire count and absorption spectra of BrC altogether over Visakhapatnam suggest a contribution from biomass burning emissions.

 Fig. 2  Wavelength dependence of the absorption coefficient of water-soluble BrC (a, c) and methanol-soluble BrC (b, d) in aerosols (expressed in m−1; M = 106) collected over the Bay of Bengal and Visakhapatnam, respectively. 
In this study, we noticed that BrC absorption from methanol extracts in most of the PM10 samples over both geographical domains was lower than that of the aqueous extracts (Fig. 3). This feature is in sharp contrast to those documented from the wintertime biomass burning emissions in the IGP in South Asia61,62 as well as those reported for anthropogenic emissions (e.g., biomass burning and fossil-fuel combustion) over other parts of East Asia.63–67 Mostly, studies focusing on BrC absorption from the water and methanol extracts of ambient aerosols have only discussed the broad spectral features and emphasized that the water-insoluble fraction of BrC is more absorptive in nature. Therefore, the prevailing differences in the BrC absorption from the solvent extracts between this study and the others in the literature could be due to two plausible reasons. First, the BrC aerosols over the BoB during the southwest monsoon season could have a contribution from a different source other than the continental pollution (i.e., air mass BTs showed maritime influence) and contain BrC-chromophores that are more soluble in water than methanol. Second, there could be significant photobleaching effects of different constituent chromophores associated with WSOC or WIOC in our summertime PM10 samples.

The babs-H2O-BrC and babs-MeOH-BrC showed significant temporal variability over the BoB and Visakhapatnam (Fig. 3). The temporal trends of babs-H2O/MeOH-BrC over the BoB are not comparable with other chemical tracers of continental outflows including nss-K+ and nss-SO42− (i.e. a proxy for the impact of biomass burning and coal combustion, respectively). In contrast, some similarity persists in the temporal variability for the Visakhapatnam data between babs-H2O/MeOH-BrC and these anthropogenic tracers (Fig. 3), suggesting an influence from biomass burning emissions on ambient BrC. As the air mass BTs during the SSK105 cruise originated mostly from the Indian Ocean, detectable EC concentration (0.8–1.2 μg m−3) in these samples suggests somewhat a mixed influence of continental and oceanic sources. Several studies from the continental outflows to the BoB and NIO revealed significant positive linear relationships between WSOC and OC with higher slopes > 0.60.58,68 This is because of the oxidation of biomass burning organic aerosols from the IGP/SE Asia during long-range transport. Nevertheless, we found no significant linear relationship of WSOC and EC with OC over the BoB. This observation suggests that these carbonaceous components have a different origin other than the continental outflow over the BoB during the SSK105 cruise. In contrast, there exist significant linear relationships of WSOC and EC with OC in PM10 sampled over Visakhapatnam together with the air mass trajectories and MODIS-VIIRS fire count data (Fig. 1c and d), suggesting their common source-emissions or long-range transport. Therefore, a lack of similarity in the temporal trends between babs-H2O/MeOH-BrC and other chemical tracers used here (nss-K+, nss-SO42−, and OC) during the SSK105 cruise altogether indicates the contribution of BrC-like substances from non-biomass burning sources.
In the neritic water, humic substances delivered through peninsular rivers and other major rivers to the BoB also usually absorb light in the near UV-visible region with a monotonous decrease of absorption towards the visible wavelength similar to BrC aerosols.38 This class of organic compounds in the surface seawater is CDOM. The absorption coefficient of CDOM (babs-CDOM) is usually expressed in m−1 and is defined as given below.38,69 babs-CDOM(λ) = A(λ) × ln(10)/l(12)
Here, A(λ) is absorbance measured across the wavelength range of 300–700 nm and ‘l’ is the path length of the cell used for the absorption measurement. Recently, Sarma et al.69 documented the absorption spectra of CDOM (i.e. similar to ambient BrC) from the surface seawater samples collected from the mouth of the Gautami-Godavari estuary, which is draining into the BoB, during 6–19 May 2011 (Fig. S3†). Therefore, BrC-like organic compounds could be transported from the surface water along with the SSAs, contributing to PM10 during the inter-monsoon period.
O'Dowd et al.70 have found that SSAs are largely composed of water-insoluble organic carbon (WIOC) and contain mostly insoluble colloidal aggregates and phytodetritus.52,53 Therefore, if marine-derived organic matter contributes to ambient aerosols, we can expect a much higher fraction of water-insoluble organic carbon (WIOC ≈ OC-WSOC) in total OC measured in aerosols. Accordingly, we found high mass ratios of WIOC/OC (89 ± 2%) in PM10 sampled over the BoB during the SSK105 cruise (Fig. 4). Likewise, organic aerosols influenced by the biological activity in the surface ocean are more enriched with Mg2+ relative to Na+ than in seawater (i.e. (Mg2+/Na+)aerosol > (Mg2+/Na+)seawater).71–73 Here, the Mg2+/Na+ ratio in seawater is apparently constant irrespective of the salt content of world oceans. Therefore, we computed the enrichment factor of Mg2+ (EFMg2+ = (Mg2+/Na+)aerosol/(Mg2+/Na+)seawater) for the PM10 samples from the BoB and Visakhapatnam. Higher EFMg2+ values (i.e. >1) over the BoB than Visakhapatnam indicate a greater influence of marine-derived organic aerosols during the SSK105 cruise. The riverine supply is a source of humic substances to the seawater and is a significant contributor to the WSOC pool. This means we could expect higher values of the absorption coefficient of BrC in the water extracts than methanol extracts. Consistently, the babs-H2O-BrC/babs-MeOH-BrC ratios (i.e. the size of the circles in Fig. 4) over the BoB are higher than those observed at Visakhapatnam. This probably means that marine-derived BrC (i.e. CDOM like material) could cause such high babs-H2O-BrC/babs-MeOH-BrC ratios observed over the BoB.

3.3. Comparison of absorption properties
We also compared the absorption properties of water-soluble BrC (babs-H2O-BrC-365 nm, MAEH2O-BrC-365 nm, and AAEH2O-BrC) from the SSK105 cruise (i.e. late southwest monsoon) with that from the SS259 cruise (i.e. northeast monsoon; Fig. 5).27 There exists a marked difference in the origin of air masses between these two cruises in the BoB.27 The air masses sampled during the SSK105 cruise (September–October 2017) are mostly of oceanic origin, whereas those collected during the SS259 cruise (November 2008) have continental influence.27 The babs-H2O-BrC-365 nm (Fig. 5a and b) over the BoB during the southwest monsoon season (this study) is lower by a factor of two than those observed during the continental outflow (i.e., SS259: November 2008). This observation suggests a greater source strength of BrC emissions from the continental sources during SS259 compared to those emitted along with sea salt aerosols during SSK105. Furthermore, the spectra of babs-H2O-BrC-λ over the BoB showed a highly variable peak maximum (Fig. 2a) compared to those typically observed monotonous relationships in marine and/or continental aerosols during the northeast monsoon (Fig. S2†).27,28,31–33,74
 Fig. 5  Spatial variability of the (a and b) absorption coefficient (babs-H2O-BrC-365; M = 106), (c and d) mass absorption efficiency (MAEH2O-BrC-365) and (e and f) absorption angström exponent (AAEBrC) of water-soluble BrC aerosols collected over the Bay of Bengal between southwest monsoon (SSK105; left panels: a, c, and e) and northeast monsoon (SS259: November 2008;27 right panels: b, d, and f). 
The MAEH2O-BrC-365 nm is also comparable between both cruises (i.e. SSK105 & SS259; Fig. 5c and d) as well as to those reported from other studies in the IGP and its outflow to the NIO during the northeast monsoon (Table 2 and Fig. S2†). This observation, thereby, emphasizes an overall considerable influence of BrC-like organic matter emitted from the BoB during the southwest monsoon. Here the comparable MAEH20-BrC-365 nm values between the southwest monsoon season (this study) and the winter cruise (SS259) are likely because of the distinct and characteristic BrC-absorption signals of the WSOC fraction between two source emissions (marine and continental). The marine-derived organic matter was associated with seasalt aerosols containing less BrC-absorption and lower WSOC than those influenced by the wintertime continental outflow to the BoB.

The AAE values obtained from the wavelength dependence of BrC absorption (babs-BrC ∝ λ−AAE) in ambient aerosols provide useful information about their contributing sources.75–77 From the absorption spectra of water- and/or methanol-soluble BrC data from SSK105 and Visakhapatnam, we, therefore, deduced AAEH2O/MeOH-BrC based on the linear regressions between logλ and log(babs-H2O/MeOH-BrC-λ). We observed significant differences in the AAEBrC values between the southwest monsoon (SSK105: 3.1 ± 1.1) and northeast monsoon cruise datasets (SS259: 5.8 ± 1.5) from the BoB, possibly related to compositional differences in the water-soluble BrC chromophores (Fig. 5e and f.). Organic compounds containing conjugated double bonds (or aromatic character) and substituted with electron-donating (e.g., –OH and –NH2) or electron-withdrawing functional groups (e.g., –NO2 and –COOH) absorb towards longer wavelengths besides the near UV-visible region and, thus, can have lower AAEBrC.78,79 Because of the prevailing maritime air masses and lack of correlations between anthropogenic tracers (nss-K+, nss-SO42−, OC, WSOC and EC) and babs-H2O-BrC-365 nm during the SSK-105 cruise (this study), the BrC aerosols could have originated from the organic matter associated with seasalt aerosols (Fig. 3e). In contrast, the rapid photobleaching of BrC-chromophores during the wintertime continental outflow to the BoB (ageing effect) could weaken the visible absorption and result in increased AAE26 (i.e., the case for the SS259 cruise; Fig. 3f).
3.4. Relationship between the refractive index of BrC and EC/organic matter
The imaginary component of the refractive index of BrC (kBrC) is a key input to a global climate model for predicting the radiative impacts of organic aerosols.8,15,32 Based on the controlled laboratory combustion of several wild fuels, Saleh et al.1 have proposed that the BrC absorption is strongly linked with the EC content in aerosols emitted from the biomass burning. Furthermore, Saleh et al.1 have shown that kBrC positively correlated with the mass ratio of EC to organic matter (OM). In this study, the air mass BTs and MODIS fire count data over Visakhapatnam hinted the influence of wheat-crop residue burning emissions in the IGP (Fig. 1c and d). Therefore, we looked for any such prevailing positive covariability between kBrC-365 nm and EC/OM (here OM ≈ OC × 1.4 (ref. 80 and 81)). However, we could not observe any significant relationship between kBrC-MeOH/H2O-λ and EC/OM (Fig. 6). Our findings are consistent with similar reports from the IGP and the IGP-outflow to the Indian Ocean during the northeast monsoon in terms of lack of relationship between kBrC-MeOH/H2O-λ and EC/OM.25,74 This observation, therefore, warrants a further investigation on controlling factors that change the optical properties of ambient BrC, e.g., photochemical ageing processes occurring in the atmosphere.
 Fig. 6  Scatter plot of the refractive index of BrC from water and methanol extracts and methanol extracts versus the mass ratio of EC/OM (i.e., OC × 1.4) in PM10 samples collected over the BoB and Visakhapatnam, respectively, as a function of absorption ångström exponent (AAEBrC) and the ratio of absorbance at 250 nm to that at 365 nm. 
To examine whether there exists any other influential factor related to source-emissions and processing effects on the BrC absorption we overlapped the AAEBrC values75 and the ratio of absorbance at 250 nm to 365 nm (A250/A365) in Fig. 6. This is to understand the relative differences in the characteristics of constituent chromophores of BrC (viz., strongly or weakly absorbing tendency, more or less aromatic, and high/low molecular weights) from the BoB and Visakhapatnam. The AAEMeOH-BrC values over the BoB (5.5 ± 3.0) and Visakhapatnam (5.3 ± 1.3) during the southwest monsoon season are somewhat higher than the AAEH2O-BrC (3.1 ± 1.1 and 3.5 ± 0.5, respectively). Similar to our study, Cheng et al.65 observed higher AAEBrC for the methanol extracts than the water extracts of some aerosol samples collected over Beijing. Zhu et al.82 also noticed higher AAE values for methanol-soluble BrC (8.2 ± 1.4) than water-soluble BrC (6.7 ± 0.8). Dasari et al.26 have suggested that AAEBrC increase from source-emissions in the IGP (Patiala: 5.3 ± 2.0;20 Delhi: 5.1 ± 2.0;30 Kharagpur: 6.0 ± 1.1 (ref. 28)) to the Indian Ocean (BoB: 9.1 ± 2.5 (ref. 27) and Maldives: 7.2 ± 0.7 (ref. 29)) during the continental outflow due to ambient photochemical transformations (i.e., secondary BrC). Such high AAEBrC values in the methanol extracts suggest that the water-insoluble fraction of BrC over the BoB and Visakhapatnam is mostly of secondary origin and the constituent chromophores are more absorptive at shorter wavelengths (<365 nm). In contrast, the low AAE values for the water extracts over the BoB and Visakhapatnam indicate that the BrC-chromophores are more absorptive at longer wavelengths (>365 nm).
The A250/A365 ratio can be used to understand the prevailing differences in the aromatic character and molecular weights of BrC chromophores.83–85 Duarte et al.86 have documented an inverse relationship between A250/A365 and aromatic character/molecular weights of constituent chromophores in atmospheric aerosols. The A250/A365 ratio (aka E2/E3 in the literature) is somewhat lower for water extracts (2.3–10.2; av. 4.4 ± 2.6) than methanol extracts (7.0–25.6; 11.8 ± 6.5) for PM10 samples collected over the BoB (Fig. 6, see the colour scale). A similar feature is observed for the Visakhapatnam samples, where the absorbance ratios of A250/A365 for water-soluble BrC (2.3–4.8; av. 3.5 ± 0.8) were lower than those of methanol-soluble BrC (2.4–8.4; av. 5.4 ± 2.1). These results suggest that BrC chromophores in the water-extracts of PM10 aerosols collected over the BoB and Visakhapatnam are enriched with aromatic structures with higher molecular weight compounds than methanol-soluble BrC chromophores.
3.5. Relative radiative forcing of BrC over EC
The fraction of solar radiation absorbed by water-soluble BrC compared to that of EC (aka RRFBrC) over Visakhapatnam was estimated according to methods described in earlier publications.28,30,87,88 For assessing the RRFBrC, we need the wavelength-dependent fraction of solar emission flux absorbed by the BrC (or the light-absorbing WSOC) and EC aerosols. This can be approximated by using their wavelength-dependent MAEλ (i.e., MAEλ0 × (λ/λ0)−AAE) and Lambert–Beer's law as given in eqn (13) and (14). (13) (14)
Here, we assumed the boundary layer height (BLH) as 2000 m as the aerosol samples from this study belong to the summer season. When MAEBrC-H2O and MAEBrC-MeOH were used in eqn (13), accordingly we used WSOC and OC concentrations, respectively, for representing water-soluble and water-insoluble light-absorbing organic matter in aerosols. We further used the MAEEC-660 nm and MAEBrC-365 nm from each sample for this calculation. However, we chose a value of 1.0 for the AAE of EC in this study to have consistency for comparing the estimated RRFBrC between this study and previous studies from the South Asian outflow. In the above eqn (13) and (14), the λ0 corresponds to 365 nm for the light-absorbing WSOC and 660 nm for EC. Likewise, [WSOC] and [EC] refer to their mass concentrations and ‘λ’ is any wavelength between 300 nm and 2500 nm (i.e. the range of the available full scan spectrum of solar absorption data). Levinson et al.89 have recently provided the solar emission flux (I0(λ)) using a clear sky Air Mass 1 Global Horizontal (AM1GH), a solar irradiance model. By combining this solar emission flux (I0(λ)) and the output from eqn (13) and (14) to eqn (15), we have estimated the fraction of solar radiation absorbed by the light-absorbing water-soluble BrC relative to that of EC in marine aerosols collected over the BoB and Visakhapatnam. (15)
In a way, the numerator and denominator of eqn (15) correspond to the fraction of solar radiation absorbed by BrC and EC, respectively (Fig. 7). Because these ‘f’ values are the fraction of BrC absorbing sunlight relative to that of EC, it is commonly reported in their percentage of EC absorption. Our estimates of RRFBrC over the BoB during September–October 2017 (1.8 ± 1.2%; N = 5) were significantly lower (two-tailed t-test; t-score = 5.5, df = 11; p < 0.05) than that sampled during November 2008 (12 ± 4%; N = 8)40 as well as those sampled over Visakhapatnam. Likewise, no such significant differences (t = 0.5, df = 14, p-value > 0.05) were observed between water (av. 5 ± 3%; N = 8) and methanol soluble BrC (av. 7 ± 11%; N = 8) aerosols over Visakhapatnam. However, our RRFBrC values over Visakhapatnam are comparable to those reported over the IGP (∼40% over Patiala;20 3–11% over Delhi;30 ∼30% over Kanpur;32 2–34% over Kharagpur28). Our study highlights the ubiquitous presence of water and methanol soluble BrC over Visakhapatnam as well as BrC-like aerosols over the BoB.

4. Summary and conclusions
We observe detectable levels of BrC absorption from the water and methanol extracts of PM10 samples collected over the BoB and Visakhapatnam (a coastal city in southern India) during the southwest monsoon, a transition period with a less continental influence than the winter season. The absorption spectra of BrC between 200 nm and 700 nm over the BoB showed several peaks compared to a monotonous decrease observed over Visakhapatnam. We found that the air mass BTs over the BoB mostly originate from the sea-side, indicating the marine source of BrC. The impact of marine-derived organic matter over the BoB is also evident from the high levels of WIOC/OC (%) and high enrichment factors of Mg2+ (i.e. biogenic origin from the sea) in aerosols collected during the SSK105 cruise. Coincidently, the surface water samples collected from the Gautami-Godavari estuary draining into the BoB showed the presence of CDOM, which has a characteristic near UV-visible absorption spectrum similar to that of ambient BrC. This observation suggests a significant contribution of marine-derived BrC over the BoB during the southwest monsoon. In contrast, the absorption spectra and optical properties of BrC over Visakhapatnam are comparable to those reported for the biomass burning events in the IGP. Besides, the air mass BTs and fire count over Visakhapatnam revealed the impact of long-range transport of BrC from the biomass burning emissions in the IGP. Therefore, the fraction of BrC-like substances emitted from the ocean surface to ambient marine aerosols seems to be important for assessing the regional radiative forcing of light-absorbing organic compounds.

Environmental significance
Some organic carbon (OC) aerosols absorb sunlight in the near UV-visible region, so called brown carbon (BrC), and exert significant climate effects on both regional/global scales. We report here, for the first time, the presence of BrC over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the southwest monsoon (i.e., during weak influence from continents). The water/methanol-extracts of marine aerosols showed distinct peaks (∼300–400 nm), suggesting the presence of BrC. Besides, these aerosols have high proportions of water-insoluble organic carbon (89% OC) and a significant enrichment of Mg2+ over Na+ (i.e., relative to seawater). This means BrC-aerosols can originate from the ocean surface along with sea salts and contribute to regional radiative forcing of carbonaceous aerosols in the South Asian outflow.
