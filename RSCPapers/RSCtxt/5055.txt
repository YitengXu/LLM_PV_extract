    , Accepted 14th January 2014First published on 14th January 2014AbstractCombination of metal oxides and carbon has been a favourable practice for their applications in high-rate energy storage mesoscopic electrodes. We report quasi 1D Fe2O3–carbon composite nanofibers obtained by the electrospinning method, and evaluate them as anodes for Li ion batteries. In the half-cell configuration, the anode exhibits a reversible capacity of 820 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 0.2 C up to 100 cycles. At a higher current density of 5 C, the cells still exhibit a specific capacity of 262 mA h g−1. Compared to pure electrospun Fe2O3 nanofibers, the capacity retention of Fe2O3–C composite nanofiber electrodes is drastically improved. The good electrochemical performance is associated with the homogenous dispersed Fe2O3 nanocrystals on the carbon nanofiber support. Such a structure prevents the aggregation of active materials, maintains the structure integrity and thus enhances the electronic conductivity during lithium insertion and extraction.
Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the commercialized rechargeable batteries, have been under research focus in the past decade due to their extensive applications in portable electronics, electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).1 Commercial LIBs are made of LiCoO2 positive electrodes and graphite/carbon negative electrodes. Graphite can form a LiC6 compound during lithiation and has a Li-storage capability of 372 A h kg−1, which poses a storage limitation for high-energy applications. Besides the capacity limitation, the graphite anode also faces severe safety problems of lithium plating during high current operation. Thus there is an increasing demand for the development of new anode materials with high specific capacity and power density from durable, nontoxic and inexpensive materials.
Transition metal oxides (e.g., MnO2, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, Co3O4, etc.) have been studied as a candidate for the anode materials, in view of their large theoretical capacity.2–6 The lithium storage mechanism here is the ‘conversion reaction’ in which the transition metal oxides react with lithium ions leading to reversible in situ formation and decomposition of LiyX (where X is O, S, F, or N).2,7 High reversible capacities ranging from 400 to 1100 mA h g−1 between 3.0 V and 0.001 V vs. Li/Li+ can be generated from the reaction. Among the intensively studied transition metal oxides, Fe2O3 is an appealing anode material owing to its high theoretical capacity, high density (5.24 g cm−3vs. 2.23 g cm−3 for graphite), low cost, earth abundance, environmentally friendly and high resistance to corrosion.8–10 Fe2O3 can accommodate up to 6 moles of Li uptake/extraction per formula unit due to its high coordination number, leading to its high capacity of 1007 mA h g−1. On the other hand, iron oxide anode materials are limited by a large capacity fading during cycling because of large volume change11 and unavoidable thick solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film on the Fe2O3 surface,12–15 which results in pulverization, loss of electrical connection at high current rates and large irreversible capacity (consumption of large amount of Li+ by SEI film). Furthermore, there is a significant hysteresis between Fe2O3 charge and discharge potentials above around 1 V. To overcome these problems, several strategies have been employed including carbon addition and nanoarchitecture control. Bruce and co-workers16 compared the Li-cycling of nanosized, mesoporous, mm sized α-Fe2O3 particles and concluded that nanosized particles with a sufficient amount of added carbon (30 wt%) are essential to ensure high performance. Nanoparticles enhance the Li transport as well as ease the strain of the conversion reaction, and the added carbon improves the electronic transport to and within the nanoparticles.16 Lou and co-workers17 showed that addition of carbon, CNT and various coatings could enhance the Li-storage performance of oxide materials; a very stable capacity of 800 mA h g−1 for 100 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1 can be obtained on the carbon coated Fe2O3 nanohorns on carbon nanotubes. Another issue with carbon–Fe2O3 is that the high temperature (≥600 °C) treatments can cause reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe.14,18 In short, while it is rather necessary for iron oxides to form composites with carbon, it still remains a challenge to fabricate nanostructured iron oxide and carbon in the form of uniform composites.
Compared to other synthesis methods such as forced hydrolysis, sol–gel synthesis, template methods, molten salt process, spray pyrolysis, hydrothermal method, co-precipitation technique,19–26 electrospinning is a versatile, low cost and high-yield fabrication technique to pattern 1D nanofibers27,28 for various applications such as dye-sensitized solar cells,29,30 photocatalysis,29 photodetectors,31 supercapacitors32,33 and lithium ion batteries.34–37 Here, we report the synthesis of Fe2O3–carbon hybrid ultralong nanofibers by the well-established electrospinning technique. After calcination, Fe2O3 nanocrystals are formed and dispersed uniformly on the carbon fibers. The electrochemical properties of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers are evaluated as Li-ion battery anodes, which indeed show dramatically, an enhancement in cyclic stability compared to pure Fe2O3 particle fibers without the carbon matrix.
Experimental
Synthesis of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN, Mw = 150000), iron(III) acetylacetonate (Fe(AcAc)3, > 99.9%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
In a typical process, 0.8 g of PAN was added into 20 mL DMF and stirred at 60 °C for 8 h. After that, 2.4 g of Fe(AcAc)3 was slowly added into the above solution and stirred continuously for 8 h to yield homogeneous solution. The prepared homogeneous solution was then loaded into plastic syringes (10 mL) with a needle of 22 G and subsequently placed into a commercial electrospinning setup (Electrospunra, Microtools Pvt Ltd Singapore). A high-voltage power of 20 kV was applied to the needle tip. The flow rate of fluid was set to 1 mL h−1. The humidity level inside the electrospinning chamber was 55 ± 5%. The nanofibers were collected on aluminum foil wrapped around a flat plate placed 12 cm below the needle tip. The as-electrospun Fe(AcAc)3–PAN composite nanofibers were first stabilized at 280 °C for 3 h in air. The as-stabilized sample was carbonized at 500 °C for 3 h in Ar. The heating and cooling rate was set to be 2.5 °C min−1.
Pure Fe2O3 nanofibers were also synthesized by electrospinning for comparison. The precursor solution consisting of Fe(AcAc)3, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 100000, Aldrich), and ethanol was loaded into a plastic syringe and a 20 kV DC voltage was applied to the single nozzle spinneret. The flow rate was set to 1 mL h−1. The collector was grounded and placed at a distance of 12 cm below the spinneret. The as-spun samples were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h in air with a heating and cooling rate of 2.5 °C min−1.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction measurement was carried out using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation between 20° and 80°. The morphological features and chemical composition were examined with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL-6701F). Particle morphology of the synthesized composites was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 3010) with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) attachment and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Specimens were prepared by ultrasonically dispersing Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers in ethanol followed by dropping the suspension on a carbon-coated copper grid. Raman spectrum was recorded by a Dilor model OMARS 89-Z24 microprobe spectrometer, under excitation of an Ar+ ion laser of 514.5 nm. The surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method (BET, Micromeritics Tristar 2000). The sample was degassed under nitrogen gas at 300 °C for 10 h prior to BET measurements (under standard protocols at 77 K). The details of degas process and measurements are given in our previous study.29,36
Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical studies were conducted in two-electrode coin cell (CR 2016) configuration. The composite anode was prepared by mixing the active material (Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers), the conductive additive (super P) and the binder (polyvinylidene fluoride, PVDF) in the mass ratio 70:15:15. This mixture was coated on an etched Cu foil (thickness 10 μm), which serves as a current collector, and subsequently dried at 85 °C overnight before conducting cell assembly in an Ar-filled glovebox (MMM Ensaca). The circular electrode area and weight were 2 cm2 and ∼2.5 mg, respectively. The coin cells were assembled by lithium metal foil (Kyokuto Metal Co., Japan) as a counter electrode, a glass microporous fiber filter (Whatman, cat. no. 1825-047) as a separator and 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)–diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 by volume, DAN VEC) as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) traces were performed using an Arbin automatic battery cycler at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s−1 between 0.005 and 3.0 V. The galvanostatic discharge–charge cycling of the cells was carried out at different current densities between potentials of 0.005 and 3.0 V by the Arbin automatic battery cycler. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Solartran 1260 + 1287) technique was used to measure impedance in the frequency range from 0.003 Hz to 180 kHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV.
Results and discussions
The surface morphology of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers was characterized using FESEM. The as-spun Fe(AcAc)3–PAN composite nanofibers are randomly oriented, continuous with smooth surfaces as shown in Fig. 1(a). The Fe(AcAc)3 counterpart in the composite nanofibers is amorphous. The diameter of the as-spun Fe(AcAc)3–PAN composite nanofibers is in the range of 450–1200 nm. The inset is the optical image of as-spun Fe(AcAc)3–PAN composite nanofibers deposited on aluminum foil. It can be peeled off readily from the aluminum foil as a free-standing nanofiber mat. Fig. 1(b) shows the stabilized composite nanofibers mat after heating at 280 °C in air. During the stabilization process, the PAN counterpart was converted to an aromatic cyclized ladder type structure by cyclization, dehydrogenation, aromatization and crosslinking, which convert the CH2 and CN groups to infusible CN and C–H groups.38 The as-stabilized composite nanofibers mat was further transformed to Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers after a further calcination process. During this process, N was removed in the form of N2, and the chains joined into graphitic planes. The morphology of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers mat is shown in Fig. 1(c) and more detailed images are shown in Fig. 1(d)–(f). The average diameter of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers became smaller, in the range of 220–600 nm, as a result of the weight loss from the removal of various components during carbonization. Also, the surface of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers became rough (Fig. 1(f)) because of the presence of Fe2O3 nanoparticles crystallized on the nanofiber surface.

The microstructure of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers was further examined by TEM. Fig. 2(a) shows the typical microstructure of a single Fe2O3–C composite nanofiber. The Fe2O3 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed along the nanofibers. A close-up view of the composite fiber in Fig. 2(b) reveals that most of the Fe2O3 nanocrystals are embedded within the carbon fibers, and some remain on the surface. The Fe2O3 crystals have a size range of 18 ± 8 nm, measured from the imaging software attached to TEM. The corresponding diffraction rings of (104), (110), (113), (024) and (116) in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 2(c)) confirm the formation of polycrystalline α-Fe2O3 in the composite nanofiber. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the high-resolution TEM image reveals the lattice fringes from the α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an interplanar spacing of 0.37 nm, corresponding to the (012) plane of the hematite phase. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping analysis of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers is illustrated in Fig. 2(e)–(h). The EDS analysis revealed the molar ratio of Fe and O to be about 2:3 for the composite nanofibers, which is in good agreement with the stoichiometric ratio of Fe2O3. The corresponding EDS mapping images for the elements of C, O and Fe illustrate clearly a homogeneous distribution of Fe2O3 crystals and carbon throughout the composite nanofibers.

More crystal structural and phase characterizations were conducted using XRD and Raman studies. The XRD pattern of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers is shown in Fig. 3(a). The diffraction peaks match well with the rhombohedral phase of hematite Fe2O3 (JCPDS 33-0664). In addition, the diffraction peaks observed at 2θ = 31.7°, 45.6° and 55.6° indicate the presence of maghemite Fe2O3 with the spinel structure. The amount of γ-Fe2O3 was calculated to be 11%. The intensity of the XRD peaks are strong, indicating a high crystallinity. The lattice parameters of α-Fe2O3 were evaluated from Rietveld refinement using TOPAS 3 software to be a = 5.034 Å and c = 13.74 Å. The average crystallite size was calculated using Scherrer formula to be 22.9 nm, quite close to the TEM analysis result. The specific surface area of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers was estimated to be 46 m2 g−1, according to the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherm (data shown in ESI, Fig S5†). The Raman spectrum of the Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers between 800 and 2000 cm−1 is shown in Fig. 3(b). The broadened characteristic frequencies at ∼1350 and ∼1580 cm−1 correspond to the D band and G band of the carbon matrix, respectively. The D-band (disorder-induced phonon mode) can be attributed to defects and disordered portions of carbon (sp3-coordinated), whereas the G-band (graphite band) is indicative of ordered graphitic crystallites of carbon (sp2-coordinated).39 The intensity ratio of D and G bands (ID/IG) provides useful information about the amount of carbon defects: a higher intensity ratio means a higher concentration of defects in the graphite comprising sp2 hybridization. The intensity ratio ID/IG of our Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers is found to be 1.09, indicating a relatively high amount of disordered sections and defects.

We now present the results of electrochemical properties. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was first carried out to investigate the electrochemical reaction process of the electrode made from Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers. Fig. 4(a) shows the first five cycles of the CV trace of the composite nanofibers electrode at room temperature between 0.005 and 3.0 V. In the first cathodic sweep, the well-defined current peak was observed at 0.67 V vs. Li+/Li, which is ascribed to the complete reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(0), the formation of Li2O and the irreversible reductive reaction of the electrolyte to form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film.20,40,41 In the first anodic scan, two board overlapping current peaks at 1.62 V and 1.85 V correspond to reversible oxidation of Fe(0) to Fe(II) and Fe(II) to Fe(III). For the second cycles, one cathodic peak appears at 0.98 V with decreased intensity, while two anodic peaks remain unchanged, indicating the irreversible phase transformation with the formation of the SEI film in the first cycle and good reversible reaction of Fe(0) to Fe(II) and Fe(II) to Fe(III), respectively.42 It is noteworthy that the current of the anodic and cathodic peaks remain nearly the same for subsequent cycles, suggesting good reversibility and structure stability during Li+ intercalation and extraction processes. The pure Fe2O3 nanofibers electrode also exhibits a similar kind of redox reaction (see Fig. 4(b)), except for the difference in the peak intensity and a shift in the reduction peak from 0.83 V to 0.69 V from the 2nd cycle to the 5th cycle. Compared to the CV trace of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers, the large deviation in the current peaks of the Fe2O3 nanofiber electrode suggests a larger capacity fading during cycling.

Galvanostatic cycling profiles of Li/Fe2O3–C composite nanofiber half-cells were performed to provide the electrochemical performance of reversibility and cyclability. The typical signature of the charge–discharge curves for first two cycles of Li/Fe2O3–C cells are given in Fig. 5(a). The first discharge curve can be divided into three regions labeled as I, II, III. First, the cell was discharged from open circuit voltage (OCV) 2.8 V to intercalate lithium ions into the Fe2O3 matrix (eqn (1)).22 In region I, a plateau can be observed at 1.1 V with a wide slope, which is attributed to the phase transformation from hexagonal LixFe2O3 to cubic Li2Fe2O3 (eqn (2)).3,22 In region II, a distinct plateau can be observed at 0.85 V due to the complete reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(0) (eqn (3)).3,22 The Fe nanocrystals were dispersed into the Li2O matrix. In region III, the electrolyte was reduced below 0.8 V and the SEI film was formed, which led to further lithium storage via an interfacial reduction at the metal–Li2O boundary. Thus, the initial specific capacity of 1214 mA h g−1 exceeds the theoretical capacity of 1007 mA h g−1 (6 mol of Li per 1 mol of α-Fe2O3) and corresponds to an uptake of 7.2 mol Li per mol of the α-Fe2O3–C composite. Fe2O3 + xLi+ +xe− → LixFe2O3(1) LixFe2O3 + (2 − x)Li+ + (2 − x)e− → Li2Fe2O3 (cubic)(2) Li2Fe2O3 (cubic) + 4Li+ + 4e− → 2Fe + 3Li2O(3)

When the cell was charged to 3 V, a smooth voltage profile was observed at 1.5 V, followed by a sloping plateau at 2.5 V and a steep up to 3 V. The first charge capacity was 875 mA h g−1, corresponding to an irreversible capacity loss of 28%. During the second cycle, a sloping plateau in the range of 0.8–1.05 V appeared, and the specific capacity decreased to 856 mA h g−1, indicating the irreversible nature of the amorphous Li2O matrix. The galvanostatic cycling profiles of subsequent cycles are nearly the same, indicating good stability during charge and discharge cycling.
The cycling performance of Li/Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers and Li/pure Fe2O3 nanofibers cell cycled between 0.005 and 3 V at 0.2 C is presented in Fig. 5(b). The pure Fe2O3 nanofibers were synthesized also by electrospinning. The composite nanofiber cell shows a rather stable capacity throughout the cycling process. Furthermore, it is obvious that, after a few initial cycles, the Columbic efficiency was found to be over 96%. The cell displays a discharge capacity of 820 mA h g−1 even after 100 cycles, which corresponds to a 96% capacity retention. For comparison, the capacity of pure Fe2O3 nanofiber cells fades rapidly to 482 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, corresponding to a 50% capacity retention. The improved cycle stability and reversible specific capacity of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers are attributed to the uniform composite fiber structure in which Fe2O3 nanocrystals are well dispersed on the carbon matrix. This structure has the following advantages: the carbon matrix prevents the pulverization and aggregation of the Fe2O3 nanoparticles, accommodates the large volume change of Fe2O3 particles during cycling. The carbon improves the electronic conductivity and electrical contact with the active materials (see below). The one dimensional characteristics of the nanocomposite also provides a good mechanical integrity of the electrode.
Rate capability measurement was carried out on the Fe2O3–C composite nanofiber cells at various current densities (Fig. 5(c)). The discharge capacity is 973 mA h g−1 when cycled at a small current density of 0.1 C for 15 cycles. When increasing the current density to 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C and 5 C, the corresponding specific capacity values are 871, 770, 631, 455, and 262 mA h g−1, respectively. Importantly, the reversible capacity of 982 mA h g−1 was still retained when the current density returned to 0.1 C after 75 cycles. This high rate capability is related to the thickness of the SEI film, the interfacial charge transfer and lithium ion diffusion in the nanocomposite materials. The presence of the carbon component is beneficial for the high rate performance of the cell for prolonged cycling.
In order to validate the mechanism of the difference in electrochemical performance between Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers and pure Fe2O3 nanofibers, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted. The Nyquist plots are present in Fig. 5(d). The EIS spectra of pure Fe2O3 and composite nanofibers have a similar shape, which consists of a semicircle in the high frequency range and an inclined line in the low frequency range. The EIS data were fit by an equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. 5(e). Re is the ohmic resistance, which represents the total resistance of the electrolyte, the separator and the electrical contact. The semicircle in the high-frequency region is attributed to the lithium ion migration resistance through a SEI film (Rsf) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct). CPEsf and CPEdl are the constant phase elements, which represent the charges accumulated on both sides of the electrode/electrolyte interface when lithium ions cross. The inclined line corresponds to the lithium diffusion kinetics in the solid-state called as Warburg impedance (Wz).43 The fitting results were summarized in Table S1 (see ESI).† It can be observed that Rsf and Rct of Fe2O3–C composite nanofibers were 67 and 159 Ω, respectively, and different from those of pure Fe2O3 nanofibers (112 and 192 Ω). The SEI resistance and charge-transfer resistance are reduced by the introduction of carbon into the 1D composite nanofibers. As expected, the carbon component uniformly distributed in 1D nanofibers improves the stability of the SEI film, the rate of charge-transfer and the Li+ kinetics, which result in a higher rate capability and improved cycling performance.
Conclusion
A new type of Fe2O3–carbon composite 1D nanofiber mat has been prepared by a facile and scalable electrospinning route for the application as the LIB anode material. The Fe2O3 nanocrystals are uniformly distributed on the carbon fiber matrix. Such composite nanofiber electrodes demonstrate an improved cycling stability, good reversibility and rate capability compared to pure electrospun Fe2O3 nanofibers. The enhanced electrochemical performance is ascribed to the unique structure of the fiber mat with a stable structural integrity and improved electrical conductivity rendered by the carbon fiber network. Given the simple fabrication and outstanding performance, the Fe2O3–C nanocomposite fiber mats could be prospective high-performance anode materials for LIBs. In addition, there is no limitation for the electrospinning route to other composite fibers with various metal oxides such as Co3O4, MoO3, MnO2, NiO for durable and flexible battery electrodes.
