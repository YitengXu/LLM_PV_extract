    , Accepted 18th June 2014First published on 19th June 2014AbstractA ladder-type angular-shaped dithienonaphthalene (aDTN), an isomer of ladder-type linear-shaped dithienonaphthalene (DTN), was designed and synthesized as an electron-rich unit to construct donor–acceptor copolymers with deep-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. Benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) with various substituents were used as electron deficient units for synthesizing the target copolymers (PaDTNBTO, PaDTNBTH, and PaDTNBTF) via the Stille coupling reaction. Incorporating different substituents onto the BT moiety has significant effects on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the copolymers, as well as on the roughness of the polymer/PC71BM blends. With four solubilizing alkyl chains on the aDTN unit, all its three copolymers have good solubility in common solvents. The synthesized copolymers exhibit deep-lying HOMO energy levels, leading to high open circuit voltages (Voc ≥ 0.90 V) of the resulting polymer solar cells. The bulk heterojunction solar cell based on the aDTN-containing copolymers (PaDTNBTO) shows an improved efficiency of 6.44% and an increased Voc of 0.92 V compared to that based on the linear-shaped DTN containing counterpart (efficiency = 4.78%, Voc = 0.86 V). Whereas, under the same device fabrication conditions, PaDTNBTH- and PaDTNBTF-based devices exhibit efficiencies of 5.22% and 1.73%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that aDTN is a better building block in constructing p-type copolymers for high open circuit voltage devices compared to the linear-shaped DTN.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising alternative for producing green and renewable energy, because of their low-cost, light-weight, and great potential for fabrication as large-area flexible devices.1–10 Efficient PSCs have been made using a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, which comprises p-type polymers blended with n-type fullerene derivatives (such as PC61BM and PC71BM). Recently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have reached up to 9.35% for single-junction devices and 10.6% for tandem cells, mainly thanks to the innovation in tailor-made photoactive materials as well as device processing technologies.11,12 For the p-type materials, the most common and successful strategy currently is to design and synthesize D–A (electron donor–acceptor) copolymers,8,13,14 owing to their small band gaps, deep-lying HOMO energy levels, and high hole mobilities.15–18
Planarization and rigidization of polyaromatic conjugated skeletons may facilitate a better π-electron delocalization, reduce the energetic disorder of the resulting polymers, and induce strong intermolecular interactions between the polymer chains for efficient charge transportation.19 Moreover, an extended π-conjugated aromatic molecule with a multi-ring fused framework endows a broader, more intense absorption band, leading to an enhanced solar light harvesting.20,21 Based on these guidelines, ladder-type structures, which are constructed by fastening or fusing adjacent aromatic units such as benzene or thiophene via a bridging atom, have attracted significant attention for photovoltaic applications. Besides their intrinsic properties, good solubility of these rigid rod-like polymers can be anticipated through the incorporation of various alkyl chains into the bridging atoms. Recently, a number of conjugated polymers based on ladder-type molecules have been reported by some research groups as well as by us.19,20,22–37 For example, ladder-type indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-based polymers were used to fabricate PSCs with PCEs up to 7.51%.37 And PSCs with a Voc as high as 1.06 V have been fabricated, based on ladder-type oligo-p-phenylene containing copolymers.20 All these exciting achievements suggest that ladder-type molecules are an excellent class of building blocks for high performance copolymers in photovoltaic applications.
The isomeric phenomena generally originate from the position difference of the heteroatoms/functional groups or the bond connection styles of the molecular moieties.38 They are very common in fused aromatic hydrocarbons. Recent studies indicate that the structural isomerization has a significant impact on the properties of organic electronic materials. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, picene has a better chemical stability and device performance than its isomer pentacene in air.39 Takimiya et al. discovered that angular-shaped naphthodithiophenes (NDTs) showed deeper HOMO energy levels and larger band gaps than their linear counterparts. Interestingly, in comparison with their linear counterparts, angular-shaped NDT-based copolymer PNDT3BT could lead to a more ordered molecular packing, which facilitates an efficient carrier transport.40,41 Similar results were also found by Müllen et al. regarding the investigation on the influence of backbone curvature on charge-carrier mobilities.42,43 Recently, we reported a series of D–A copolymers based on ladder-type dithienonaphthalene (DTN) units. PSCs based on one of these DTN-containing copolymers (PDTNTBT in Fig. 1) exhibited a PCE of 4.78% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.86 V, indicating that DTN is a promising donor unit for constructing high performance conjugated copolymers.19 Similar to other fused aromatics, DTN also contains different isomers, such as linear- and angular-shaped analogues (aDTN) (Fig. 1). Considering the abovementioned dependence of material electronic properties on its chemical structure, we expect that aDTN-based polymers may exhibit different properties in comparison with their linear-shaped analogues.

Herein, we design and synthesize aDTN as a donor unit for constructing D–A conjugated copolymers. Similar to our previous studies,19 benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) is chosen as an acceptor unit because of its strong electron-accepting ability.44,45 At the same time, two thiophene groups are flanked on both sides of the BT group to reduce the steric hindrance, if any, between the donor and the acceptor units. In order to further modulate and optimize the performance of the aDTN-based copolymers, two electron-donating hexyloxy groups and two electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms are introduced onto the BT heterocycle, generating 5,6-bis(hexyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole (BTO) and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTF). Using these three monomers, three D–A copolymers (PaDTNBTH, PaDTNBTO, and PaDTNBTF in Scheme 2) are synthesized. The optical, electrochemical, and electrical properties, as well as the preliminary photovoltaic performance of these copolymers, are investigated. The results reveal that these copolymers possess deep-lying HOMO energy levels below −5.34 eV, with medium band gaps in the range of 1.79–1.90 eV. PDTNTBT differs from PaDTNBTO in the chemical structure of the donor unit for D–A copolymers. DTN is used for the former, whereas aDTN is used for the latter. However, the PaDTNBTO-based device exhibits a PCE of 6.44% with a Voc of 0.92 V, which is higher than that of the PDTNTBT-based device (efficiency of 4.78% with a Voc of 0.86 V).
2. Experimental
2.1. Material
Reagents were purchased from Aldrich Inc., Aladdin-Reagent Inc. or Adamas-beta Ltd. and used without further purification unless otherwise specified. Compounds 1, 9, 10, and 11 were prepared according to the literature procedures.46–49 Column chromatography was conducted with silica gel (200–300 mesh).
2.2. Instruments

1H and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AVANCE-400 spectrometer operating at 400 and 100 MHz in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 with the TMS reference. High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) measurements were performed on an IonSpec 4.7T spectrometer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was conducted in THF on a Waters 1515 system. The absorption spectra of the copolymers in chlorobenzene (1 × 10−5 M) and in thin films on glass substrates were measured by a Lambda 35 UV/vis spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI 700E electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system in a solution of 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The copolymer films were coated on a Pt plate electrode by dipping the electrode into the corresponding solutions and then drying. A Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgNO3 was used as the reference electrode. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed by a Veeco Multimode NS3A-02 Nanoscope III atomic force microscope. Blended films for AFM were prepared on PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates prepared in identical fashion to those prepared for the device fabrication.
2.3. Fabrication of conventional PSCs
PSCs were fabricated in the traditional sandwich structure by using PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVPAI 4083) as the anode buffer layer. Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was sequentially cleaned by ultrasonication in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 30 min each and then dried in an oven at 130 °C overnight. The ITO/glass substrates were first treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min, then PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the substrates at 3000 rpm for 1 min, and later the substrates were dried at 130 °C in air for 30 min. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating the polymer:PC71BM blends at 1000 rpm for 1 min in a glove box, and the devices were kept at room temperature for 12 h. Before the aluminum deposition, a conjugated polyelectrolyte PIFB was introduced as an interlayer to facilitate efficient electron injection. PIFB was prepared according to our previous report.19 The PIFB layer (∼1 nm) was obtained by spin-coating a methanol solution (0.3 mg mL−1 containing 30 eq. of acetic acid) on the top of the active layer. Ultimately, about 80 nm of aluminum was deposited on the top of the PIFB layer through shadow masks by thermal evaporation. The active area of the devices was fixed at 6 mm2. All polymer:PC71BM blends were dissolved in mixed solvents of chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene (4/1, v/v) at the concentration of 20 mg mL−1. The blend ratio was fixed at 1:4 (polymer–PC71BM by weight).
2.4. Measurement of PSC devices
Device characterization was performed under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) on an Oriel sol3A simulator (Newport) with a NREL-certified silicon reference cell. The current density–voltage curves were measured by a Keithley 2440 source measurement unit.
2.5. Mobility measurements
Hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au) and electron-only devices (ITO/Al/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al) were fabricated in order to estimate the hole and electron mobilities of these polymers by the SCLC method. The hole-only devices were prepared following the same procedures used in photovoltaic device fabrication, except that the PIFB/Al cathode was replaced by the Au (40 nm) electrode. For the electron-only devices, Al (5 nm) was thermally evaporated on the pre-cleaned ITO; further, the BHJ film was coated using the same method as that used for the solar cell fabrication. Finally, Ca (20 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited on the BHJ film. The current density (J) was measured by an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer. The SCLC carrier mobilities were calculated according to the following equation: (1)where ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer (assumed to be 3, which is a typical value for conjugated polymers), μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device (V = Vappl − Vr − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, Vr is the voltage drop due to the contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes, and Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the difference in work function of the two electrodes), and L is the polymer thickness. The thickness of the film was measured by the Bruker Dektak XT surface profilometer.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes for the monomer (8) and the copolymers are depicted in Schemes 1 and 2. All compounds were synthesized similarly to the method previously reported by us except for the key intermediate 1,5-dibromonaphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic (2). Compound 2 was obtained by using a simplified procedure, which started from 1,5-dibromo-2,6-dimethylnaphthalene through a three-step process successively involving benzylic radical dibromination to 1,5-dibromo-2,6-bis(dibromomethyl)naphthalene, hydrolysis into the corresponding 1,5-dibromonaphthalene-2,6-dicarbaldehyde, and then oxidation into the corresponding carboxylic acid, to give a 73% overall yield. Compound 3 was obtained by an esterification reaction under the catalytic action of SOCl2 in a 94% yield. The Stille coupling reaction between compound 3 and tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane gave compound 4 in a 90% yield. Compound 4 was hydrolyzed to compound 5, which was subsequently converted into an acid chloride derivative by reacting with oxalyl chloride. Further, intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation of the acid chloride derivative afforded a ketone (6) in a 98% yield. Compound 7 was obtained after a Wolf–Kishner reduction of compound 6 in a 92% yield. The alkylation of compound 7 afforded aDTN with four 2-ethylhexyl groups. Compound 8 was synthesized in a 89% yield by the lithium–hydrogen exchange on aDTN and by reaction with trimethyltin chloride. Stille coupling reactions between monomer 8 and 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(hexyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (9), 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (10), and 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (11) using palladium tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) (Pd(PPh3)4) as the catalyst gave the D–A copolymers PaDTNBTO, PaDTNBTH, and PaDTNBTF in 89%, 79% and 62% yields, respectively. These copolymers were purified by precipitation from methanol and subsequent Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform in sequence. Due to the four 2-ethylhexyl chains being introduced into both sides of the aDTN unit, all copolymers show good solubility in chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of PaDTNBTO, PaDTNBTH, and PaDTNBTF, are 54.5 kg, 25.5 kg, and 15.7 kg, respectively, with relatively narrow polydispersity indices (PDIs) in the range of 1.58–1.83 (Table 1), which were estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the internal standard.

3.2. Optical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of the copolymers in chlorobenzene solutions (1 × 10−5 M) and in thin films are shown in Fig. 2 and the optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. All the three copolymers exhibit one main broad absorption band in both dilute solutions and thin films. As shown in Fig. 2a, incorporating different substituents onto the BT unit have significant effects on the optical properties of the copolymers. For example, the absorption maximum of PaDTNBTH in chlorobenzene is located at 591 nm. After introducing two electron-donating hexyloxy groups, the absorption maximum of PaDTNBTO blue-shifts about 26 nm (λmax = 565 nm). Interestingly, by adding two F atoms onto the BT unit, PaDTNBTF also shows a blue shift of about 5 nm compared to the nonfluorinated copolymer PaDTNBTH, indicating that the fluorine substitution on the BT unit has a certain influence on the optical properties of the resulting D–A copolymers. Similar results have also been found in some other fluorinated copolymer systems.12,51–54 In going from solution to a solid film (Fig. 2b), negligible changes were observed in the absorption profiles, except that there are 10–32 nm red-shifted absorption peaks for the films. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) deduced from the absorption edges (λedge) of the polymer films are 1.90, 1.79, and 1.81 eV for PaDTNBTO, PaDTNBTH, and PaDTNBTF, respectively.

3.3. Electrochemical properties
The molecular frontier orbitals of the target copolymers were investigated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method in films on a Pt disk working electrode in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solutions at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Under this condition, the onset oxidation potential (E1/2ox) of ferrocene was −0.02 V versus Ag/Ag+. The CV curves were calibrated using ferrocene as the standard, whose HOMO energy level was set at −4.80 eV. Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammetry for these copolymers. From the onset oxidation (φox) and the reduction potentials (φred) versus Ag/Ag+ in the cyclic voltammogram, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, as well as the band gaps (Eecg) of the copolymers, were estimated according to the following equations, with the detailed data summarized in Table 1. EHOMO = −(φox + 4.82)(eV)(2) ELUMO = −(φred + 4.82)(eV)(3) Eecg = (φox − φred)(eV)(4)
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the copolymer films on a platinum electrode at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. 
As shown in Fig. 3, all the three copolymers exhibit reversible anodic oxidation and irreversible cathodic reduction curves in cyclic voltammetry measurements. For PaDTNBTH, the φox and the φred are 0.52 V and −1.24 V, respectively, corresponding to a HOMO level of −5.34 eV and a LUMO level of −3.58 eV. After adding two F atoms, PaDTNBTF exhibits a relatively deeper HOMO level of −5.38 eV, whereas the LUMO level (−3.59 eV) is almost unchanged. Similar trends in the HOMO level change have also been found in some other fluorinated copolymer systems.55,56 Interestingly, when the F atom was exchanged to the hexyloxy group, PaDTNBTO shows a deeper HOMO level of −5.40 eV and an equivalent LUMO level of −3.57 eV compared to that of PaDTNBTF, which could be attributed to the decreased charge transfer from the donor moiety to the acceptor moiety (BT) with the incorporation of two electron-donating hexyloxy groups. Clearly, the HOMO energy levels of all copolymers are low enough to ensure good stability and a high Voc in PSCs. As we know, Voc is positively correlated with the offset between the HOMO energy levels of donor materials and the LUMO energy levels of acceptor materials.57 Meanwhile, the LUMO level difference between the polymers and PC71BM (−4.3 eV) are ∼0.7 eV, which means that electron transfer from the polymers to PC71BM is energetically favorable. The band gaps calculated from the difference between the onset oxidation and reduction potentials are 1.83, 1.76, and 1.79 eV for PaDTNBTO, PaDTNBTH, and PaDTNBTF, in that order. The results are in agreement with its optical band gaps, within experimental error.
3.4. Hole mobilities and photovoltaic properties
The hole mobilities of the copolymers were investigated by using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM/Au (40 nm). The linear fits for the plots of J0.5versus V (V = Vappl − Vr − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, Vr is the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes, and Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the difference in work function of the two electrodes) are shown in Fig. 4 and the data are collected in Table S1.† The hole mobilities are estimated to be 2.81 × 10−5, 3.69 × 10−5, and 7.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the blends of PaDTNBTO, PaDTNBTH, and PaDTNBTF with PC71BM, respectively. Obviously, as donor materials, PaDTNBTO and PaDTNBTH will have some advantages in the photovoltaic application compared to PaDTNBTF, due to their higher hole mobilities.

The photovoltaic properties of the resulting copolymers were investigated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM/PIFB/Al (80 nm). Here, a thin layer of PIFB was employed as the cathode interlayer.19 PC71BM was chosen as the electron acceptor due to its broader and stronger absorption in the visible region, which is complementary to the absorption valley of the polymer and beneficial for high efficient PSCs.58 The active layers were prepared by spin coating the polymer:PC71BM blends from mixed solvents (chorobenzene–o-dichorobenzene = 4:1, v/v) on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer without any further treatment. The measurements were performed under simulated AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination with an active area of 0.06 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these PSCs are shown in Fig. 5 and 7, and the device parameters such as Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are summarized in Table 2.

The donor–acceptor (D–A) ratio plays an important role in the performance of PSCs, because a balance in the hole and electron transport is necessary to avoid any accumulation of charge and thus to facilitate the charge transport process during the photon-to-current conversion.37,59 Therefore, we fabricated PSC devices based on PaDTNBTO:PC71BM with different blend ratios to optimize the device performance. Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices with different blend ratios (D–A = 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5), with the detailed parameters summarized in Table 2. In Table 2, the device parameters of the PDTNTBT-based solar cell are listed as a reference.19 It should be mentioned that the only difference in PaDTNBTO and PDTNTBT is the donor unit (Fig. 1 and Scheme 2). However, the device based on PaDTNBTO (blend ratio of 1:4) gives the best PCE of 6.44% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 10.91 mA cm−2 and an FF of 64.1%, which is higher than the best PCE of 4.78% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 10.29 mA cm−2 and an FF of 53.8% for the PDTNTBT-based device. The EQE spectra (Fig. 5b) show that the device with the 1:4 blend ratio has higher EQE values in the range from 360 to 610 nm, compared to those of the devices with other blend ratios. In order to reveal the impact of D–A ratio on the photovoltaic parameters, the Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE data are plotted in Fig. 6a–d as functions of the blend ratio. It can be seen that the blend ratio significantly affects the Jsc and FF, although the Voc is nearly unchanged regardless of the blend ratio. For example, when the blend ratio increases from 1:2 to 1:4, the Jsc of the devices gradually increases from 10.13 to 10.93 mA cm−2, and the FF of the device increases from 51.6% to 64.1%, while a high Voc of 0.92 V is retained. This effect is probably due to the more balanced hole and electron mobilities in the blend films with high PC71BM contents, which prevents the accumulation of charges. Moreover, the active layer of high PC71BM content devices may have a bicontinuous phase separation with the appropriate domain size, which affords efficient exciton diffusion and charge separation. When the blend ratio further increases from 1:4 to 1:5, both the Jsc and FF of the devices decrease, leading to a reduced PCE of 5.01%. Therefore, the blend ratio of 1:4 was chosen as the optimal blend ratio for the other polymer blends.
 Fig. 6  The photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs based on PaDTNBTO:PC71BM with different blend ratios. 
In order to verify the above hypothesis, the morphology of the polymer blends with different blend ratios (D–A = 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 1:5) were investigated using tapping mode AFM. According to the topography images of the blend films, as shown in Fig. S4,† the root-mean-square (RMS) values of the PaDTNBTO:PC71BM blends at weight ratios of 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 1:5 are 0.52, 1.37, 1.87, and 2.15 nm, respectively. The larger RMS value in the blend films with higher PC71BM contents is probably attributed to the higher degree of PC71BM aggregation. For low PC71BM content film (D–A = 1:2, Fig. S4b†), PC71BM is dispersed into the polymer phase, and thus, the blend film did not form phase separation with an ideal domain size. In the case of the 1:5 blend ratio (Fig. S4h†), the phase separation is not optimal because of the over-dominant PC71BM in the polymer blend. For the blend films with D–A = 1:3 (Fig. S4d†) and 1:4 (Fig. S4f†) ratios, the films exhibit phase separation with an optimal domain size of 10–20 nm, which is favorable for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Moreover, we measured the electron and hole mobilities by using the SCLC method to investigate the charge transport properties of the blend films with different blend ratios. Fig. S3† shows the dark current density–voltage (Jdark–V) characteristics of the hole-only devices and the electron-only devices with different blend ratios, with the detailed results summarized in Table S2.† It could be found that the hole and the electron mobilities are simultaneously improved with an increase in the PC71BM content in the PaDTNBTO:PC71BM blend films (D–A ratio from 1:2 to 1:4). When the PC71BM content was further increased (D–A = 1:5), the electron mobility continues to increase but the hole mobility starts to decrease. Finally, the electron and hole mobilities of the blend are more balanced at the weight ratio of 1:4, and are 5.26 × 10−5 and 2.81 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. When the FF values of the PSC devices are correlated with the blend ratios, it can be concluded that D–A ratios in the blend film play an important role in realizing balanced hole and electron mobilities, which is the key to achieving a high FF.
Under the same blend ratio of 1:4, as shown in Fig. 7a, the PSC device based on PaDTNBTF exhibited a quite low PCE of 1.73% with Voc = 0.91 V, Jsc = 3.99 mA cm−2, and FF = 47.8%. However, dramatically improved photovoltaic performance was achieved for the device based on PaDTNBTH, which exhibited a Voc of 0.90 V, a slightly increased FF of 51.8%, and a significantly improved Jsc of 11.17 mA cm−2, resulting in a moderate PCE of 5.22%. The best photovoltaic performance was obtained for the device based on PaDTNBTO, which showed a further improved FF of 64.1%, Voc of 0.92 V, and a slightly decreased Jsc of 10.91 mA cm−2, leading to a high PCE of 6.44%. It should be noted that such a promising performance was achieved without the use of any pre- and/or post-treatments, such as thermal annealing, solvent annealing, or processing additives. In our case, utilization of the different treatment methodologies only has negative effects on the device performance for the PaDTNBTO-based devices. The device parameters for all the devices fabricated in the different conditions are shown in Fig. S2 and Table S3.†
 Fig. 7  (a) J–V characteristics and (b) EQE curves of BHJ solar cells based on the three copolymers. 
It was found that the Jsc and FF values of the PaDTNBTH- and PaDTNBTO-based devices are much higher than those based on PaDTNBTF, which could be ascribed to the optimal morphology with an appropriate domain size of the active layers based on PaDTNBTH and PaDTNBTO, as well as their higher charge carrier mobilities that promote charge transport in devices. As shown in Table 2, an increase in the molecular weight of PaDTNBTO leads to an improved device performance. When the Mn increases from 10.3 kg to 54.5 kg, maximum PCE increases from 5.03% to 6.44%, mainly due to the higher FF (64.1% versus 52.2%). These results have also been observed in previously reported literature.60 Considering the fact that the molecular weight plays an important role in the device performance, we believe that there is still room to further improve the performance of the devices based on these copolymers through an optimization of their molecular weights. As we expected, devices based on aDTN-containing copolymers show a relatively higher Voc in the range of 0.90–0.92 V compared to those based on linear-shaped DTN-containing copolymers (0.75–0.87 V),19 which can be attributed to their deeper-lying HOMO energy levels.
3.5. External quantum efficiency
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the polymer-based devices under monochromatic light illumination are shown in Fig. 7b. As shown in the figure, the EQE curves for all the devices are rather flat in the wavelength range from 400 to 600 nm. The device based on PaDTNBTO exhibits a similar average EQE value to that based on PaDTNBTH (44.4% versus 44.7%) in the range of 300–750 nm, and both of them are much higher than that based on PaDTNBTF (16.5%). This result is consistent with the higher Jsc for the PaDTNBTO- or PaDTNBTH-based devices compared to that for the PaDTNBTF-based device. In addition, the photoresponse ranges for the devices based on PaDTNBTH and PaDTNBTF are slightly broader compared to that for the PaDTNBTO-based device, which is in agreement with the optical absorption spectra of the corresponding polymer:PC71BM blends in the same blend ratio (Fig. S1†).
3.6. Morphology
For polymer solar cells, the morphological control of the BHJ active layer is of great importance in charge generation, separation, and transport, which could influence final device performances. In this work, the surface morphological structures of the polymer–PC71BM (1:4, w/w) blend films were evaluated by using tapping mode AFM. The AFM topography and phase images are shown in Fig. 8. As can be seen in Fig. 8, phase separation was clearly observed for all the three polymer blends. Due to the structural differences in the three copolymers, the phase separation images for the blended films look different. For example, the film of the PaDTNBTF:PC71BM blend does not show uniform phase separation with many domain sizes over 40 nm, which is much larger than the typical exciton diffusion length of ∼10 nm.1,61 This can be accounted for by the low FF of 47.8% found in the PaDTNBTF-based device. The phase image of the film from PaDTNBTH blended with PC71BM displays a very smooth surface without any clear phase separation, which is also unfavorable for effective charge separation and transportation. In the case of the PaDTNBTO:PC71BM blend, a more clear phase separation could be observed with a domain size of ∼20 nm. This is beneficial for the efficient exciton diffusion to the donor-acceptor interface, and thus contributes to the high FF of 64.1% for the PaDTNBTO-based device. The obtained root-mean-square roughness (RMS) values are 1.87, 0.72, and 0.25 nm for the blend films of PaDTNBTO:PC71BM, PaDTNBTF:PC71BM and PaDTNBTH:PC71BM, respectively. The difference in the RMS value can be attributed to the different substituents in the BT unit. Because the longer and bulkier side chains will create more disorder in the film self-organization, it is not surprising that the film based on the copolymers with two hexyloxy groups is the coarsest, and that based on the copolymers without any substitutes is the smoothest.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel ladder-type angular-shaped electron-rich unit (aDTN) has been designed and synthesized. Three D–A copolymers based on aDTN exhibit medium band-gaps in the range of 1.79–1.90 eV, along with deep-lying HOMO levels below −5.34 eV. As a result of the deep-lying HOMO level, BHJ photovoltaic devices derived from these polymers have a relatively high Voc over 0.9 V. In particular, the photovoltaic device based on PaDTNBTO exhibits the best efficiency of 6.44%, which is higher than that of the device based on linear-shaped DTN-containing copolymers (PDTNTBT).19 These preliminary results demonstrate that aDTN is a more promising electron-rich building block in constructing p-type copolymers for solar cells with high open circuit voltages compared to the linear-shaped DTN. Compared with other large band-gap materials such as P3HT, PaDTNBTO shows an improved performance in Voc, which makes it a promising candidate for the short wavelength absorbing materials used for tandem PSCs.
