    First published on 16th January 2020AbstractThe development of metal complexes for optoelectronic applications is a fertile area of research. In contrast to the rigorous development of mononuclear metal complexes, dinuclear species have been less well studied and their fundamental chemistry and applications are under-explored. However, dinuclear species present special properties and functions compared with mononuclear species as a consequence of tuning the bridging ligands, the cyclometalated ligands or the two metal centers. More recently, dinuclear species have enabled important breakthroughs in the fields of OLEDs, photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction, DSPEC, chemosensors, biosensors, PDT, smart materials and so on. Here we present an overview of recent developments of dinuclear metal complexes, their multifunctional properties and their various applications. The relationship between structure and property of dinuclear species and important factors which influence device performance are discussed. Finally, we illustrate some challenges and opportunities for future research into dinuclear metal complexes. This review aims to provide an up-to-date summary and outlook of functional dinuclear metal complexes and to stimulate more researchers to contribute to this exciting interdisciplinary field.

1. Introduction
The continued development of organometallic complexes is a very important and intriguing topic due to their established applications in optoelectronic devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),1–6 light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs),7–12 electrochemical luminescence (ECL),13–18 chemosensors,19–23 biosensors,24–28 and photodynamic therapy (PDT),29–33 as well as emerging areas including photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction,34–44 dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPEC),45–49 and smart materials.50–54 Compared with the rigorous development of mononuclear metal complexes, dinuclear metal complexes have been less well studied and in many ways are in their infancy. The major challenges are as follows: (i) obtaining dinuclear complexes can require complicated synthetic processes that give low production yields.55–57 (ii) Dinuclear complexes are often obtained as a mixture of diastereomers which are very difficult to separate.58–62 (iii) Complicated inter- and intra-molecular electron and energy transfer processes can make their properties hard to predict.63–67 (iv) Dinuclear complexes often feature poor optical properties with low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and short excited state lifetimes due to the large contribution of non-radiative excited states from the bridging ligands.59,68–71 (v) Stable true-blue phosphors, especially blue electroluminescene (EL), is still difficult to obtain in dinuclear systems due to the more conjugated structure compared with their mononuclear analogues.72 (vi) Dinuclear complexes have relatively large molecular weights so they generally cannot be thermally evaporated to form thin films when making optoelectronic devices, requiring solution processing instead.73–77 Therefore, it is not surprising that dinuclear systems have attracted less attention than mononuclear counterparts. Nonetheless, important progress has been made with dinuclear metal complexes in optoelectronic applications, as summarised in Fig. 1. These studies clearly reveal that dinuclear species are viable for practical applications, and a better understanding of their structure–property relationships will accelerate the development of more efficient materials and devices.

This review article presents important advances in dinuclear metal complexes and their various applications, with emphasis on recent developments. Fundamental studies on these complexes are also discussed. The aim of this review is to provide an in-depth understanding of the structure–property relationships of dinuclear complexes and to highlight key aspects for improving their photoelectronic performance. It is our intention to stimulate more researchers to enter into this fascinating field.
2. Basic properties of dinuclear complexes
Several important questions immediately arise when considering dinuclear systems and their optoelectronic properties, such as: (i) diastereoisomers or geometrical isomers usually exist in the dinuclear systems: is there any tendency for one isomer to predominate over others? What is the structure–property relationship within such isomer systems? Can these isomers be separated? (ii) What are the mechanisms of electron/energy transfer in the dinuclear systems? (iii) What is the influence on the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) when another metal atom is introduced in the same molecule? (iv) When combining two individual metal components in one molecule, are the properties essentially a summation of those of the individual components, or are they very different? In this section, questions (i) and (ii) will be discussed in detail based on recent progress in dinuclear metal complexes. Questions (iii) and (iv) will be discussed in the next section.
2.1 Isomers of dinuclear metal complexes

2.1.1 Diastereoisomers. 
Diastereomers mixtures of meso (ΛΔ) and rac (ΔΔ/ΛΛ) isomers are usually present in dinuclear metal systems due to the chiral nature of the metal centers. The most fundamental example of the genre is [M(CL)2]2(BL), where CL is a cyclometallated ligand such as bidentate 2-phenylpyridine (ppy), and BL is a symmetrical bridging ligand including a flexible bis-atoms bridge and a rigid aromatic bridge (Fig. 2). The separation of diastereomers is crucial for understanding their detailed structure–property relationships and for further applications. However, until now, only a few cases have been reported of complete separation of diastereomers.85,91–96 Hua and von Zelewsky first reported a successful way for the selective preparation of isomerically pure dinuclear complexes by using an enantiomerically pure chiral building block for Ru complexes.91 Keene et al. developed chromatographic methods for separation of Ru enantiomers by ion-exchange chromatography, using chiral eluents.92 Ye et al. have recently developed a useful tactic for avoiding the formation of diastereomeric mixtures via a chiral precursor strategy using L- or D-proline as an auxiliary ligand.95 The direct synthetic routes for pure enantiomers, ΛΛ and ΔΔ, are shown in Fig. 3. This strategy has also been applied to the larger enantiopure multimetallic Ir(III) systems.97,98 Until recently, the separation of diiridium diastereomers was achieved by facile fractional crystallization, silica column chromatography without chiral eluents, or a combination of the two techniques.94,96 The ratios of diiridium diastereomers are still hard to predict: for example, the meso-isomer is usually favoured over the rac-isomer in a diiridium system with diarylhydrazide bridging ligands. However, opposite results were obtained from the parent diiridium dimers [Ir(ppy)2(μ-Cl)2]2, where the ratio of rac-isomer is higher than meso-isomer.99,100 These different results are probably induced by the interligand steric interactions.

Meso (ΛΔ) and rac (ΔΔ/ΛΛ) isomers often exhibit distinguishing photophysical properties due to their different molecular conformations. For example, Williams and Lincoln et al. had successfully reported a series of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes isomers via a chiral precursor strategy. The photoluminescent properties of these complexes upon binding to DNA has been studied.101–108 In aqueous solution, the luminescence of dinuclear Ru(II) complex 3 ([μ-(11,11′-bidppz)(phen)4Ru2]4+; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 11,11′-bidppz = 11,11′-bi(dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazinyl)) is essentially quenched at ambient temperatures, probably by protonation of the phenazine nitrogen by water.101 However, a dramatic increase in luminescence intensity, referred to as the “light-switch” effect, with higher quantum yield was observed when complex 3 is bound to poly(dA–dT)2.102,103,105 The quantum yield for rac-ΔΔ was measured to be 9%, which is approximately 7–8 times higher than that found for the meso-ΛΔ and rac-ΛΛ isomers with 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively. This suggests that the nitrogens of the bidppz ligand of the ΔΔ isomer may be shielded from protonation.103 A similar variation in quantum yields was also observed for Δ-compared to Λ-[Ru(phen)2(dppz)]2+ due to a difference in location of the DPPZ ligand within the intercalation pocket. Interactions between closely bound complex ions may also play a role.106 The final binding geometry studies of the three stereoisomers of complex 3 in poly(dA–dT)2 suggested that the bidppz ligand is intercalated between the nucleobases in an anti conformation, with a small rotation around the central pivot bond. The complex intercalates asymmetrically, with one of the Ru(phen)2 moieties deeply intercalated from the minor groove side103,105 (Fig. 4).

2.1.2 Geometrical isomers. 

cis–trans isomerism, also known as geometric isomerism or configurational isomerism, is a standard term in organic chemistry. For dinuclear complexes, cis indicates that the functional groups are on the same side of the two metal centers while trans conveys that they are on opposing sides (Fig. 5). Recently, we reported a series of aggregation induced phosphorescent emission (AIPE)-active dinuclear Ir(III) system with Schiff base bridging ligands, and their applications in anion detection, chemo/bio-sensors and information storage (Fig. 6).50,85,109–111

 Fig. 6  Molecular structures of 4–12 (top) and X-ray crystal structures of 4-cis and 4-trans (bottom). The anions and solvent molecules are omitted for clarity. 
For ionic dinuclear Ir(III) complexes, cis–trans isomeric mixtures were found in the complexes 4, 5, 7 and 9 with phenyl in the bridging ligands. However, cis–trans isomerization was not observed in the complexes 6, 8 and 10 with biphenyl in the bridging ligands. Indeed many studies had pointed out that the isomeric mixtures could be predicted by the conjugated bridging chain length in the dinuclear systems. A short conjugated bridging ligand could induce isomeric mixtures,112–115 but this is not the case with a longer conjugated bridging ligand.68,116–118 Our work revealed no cis–trans mixtures in the neutral dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 11 and 12 with short conjugated bridging ligands; only the stable trans isomer was observed.109,110 Therefore, it seems that cis–trans isomerization is induced not only by the length of conjugated bridging chains, but also by a counter ion effect.
The cis–trans isomers in the complex 4 with ClO4− counter ions were separated by fractional crystallization and their crystal structures were obtained (Fig. 6). The ratio of cis–trans isomers in 4 was calculated as 2.58/1, which is higher than in the analogous complex 5 with PF6− counter ions. This result reveals that the isomer ratios are induced by the counter ions, and can be tuned by the counter ion exchange process. For instance, the ratio of cis isomer increased when ClO4− was added to a solution of complex 5·PF6. Furthermore, 4-cis isomer showed significantly higher PLQYs (31%) than the 4-trans isomer (13%) in solution. The reason may be the distorted geometry in the 4-trans isomer that would favour non-radiative processes, whereas the more planar geometry (4-cis isomer) would increase radiative processes, as observed previously.119

2.2 Photoinduced electron and energy transfer in dinuclear metal complexes
Photoinduced electron and energy transfer processes commonly occur in dinuclear metal systems, such as Ru(II)–Rh(III),120,121 Ru(II)–Os(II),122–128 Ru(II)–Ni(II),129 Ru(II)–Zn(II),130 Ru(II)–Cu(II),131 Ru(II)–Ru(II),64,67 Ir(III)–Ru(II),125,132,133 Ir(III)–Pt(II),129 Ir(III)–Eu(III),134 Ir(III)–Ir(III).56 Therefore, bimetallic complexes are popular choices as donor–bridge–acceptor (D–B–A) systems for investigations of photoinduced electron and energy transfer process. As shown in Fig. 7, the electron transfer usually occurs via two fundamentally different mechanisms: the coherent tunneling or incoherent hopping mechanism.65,135 The tunneling mechanism is often described by the superexchange model,136 which requires the donor and acceptor at either ends of the bridge to be energetically well separated from the bridge states. In this situation the bridge is neither reduced nor oxidized but merely functions as a coupling medium for the transfer process. In contrast, the incoherent hopping mechanism involves real intermediate states that actively transport the electron or hole along the bridge. For energy transfer, through-space (Förster) or through-bond (Dexter) are the two main mechanisms (Fig. 8).137 Thus, understanding the mechanism of photoinduced electron and energy transfer is crucial for further design of functional dinuclear metal complexes and their applications in optoelectronic devices. In this section, representative dinuclear complexes have been chosen to illustrate various approaches taken to investigate energy and electron transfer.

2.2.1 Effects of the selection of bridge ligand on intramolecular electron transfer processes. 
In early work on electron and energy transfer, a Ru(II)–Rh(III) system was first studied by Scandola and coworkers.120 The hetero-dinuclear complex 13 consists of two structurally similar components, namely, metal tris(po1ypyridine) complexes, linked by a flexible ethylene chain (Fig. 9). The Ru(II) component acts as the donor (D), and the Rh(III) component unit as the acceptor (A). A wide range of techniques such as picosecond laser spectroscopy, nanosecond single-photon counting (emission lifetimes), Raman spectroscopy and transient absorption measurements were applied to investigate the mechanism of electron and energy transfer between the two metal components. The cyclic voltammogram of 13 showed a Ru(II)/(III) oxidation potential at 1.13 V vs. SCE, Rh(III)/(II) reduction potential at −0.92 V and two ligand–ligand’ reduction potentials at −1.45 V and −1.66 V, respectively, which showed a superposition of the corresponding curves of the single Ru(II) component and the Rh(III) component. This result indicated that the interaction between the two polypyridyl centers is insignificant, thus metal–metal interaction takes place via a hole transfer through-bond superexchange process in the ground state (Fig. 10b).138 The UV-vis absorption spectrum of 13 is an exact superposition of the spectra of the isolated mononuclear species, without a new band arising. Interestingly, although a weak intercomponent interaction was demonstrated by both UV-vis absorption and electrochemical results, the emission of 13 demonstrated 90% quenching in comparison with the mononuclear Ru(II) complex. Based on the spectroscopic and redox data given above, both electron transfer to the Rh(III) moiety and energy transfer from the Ru(II) to the Rh(III) center are thermodynamically allowed and could be responsible for the quenching process. To further investigate the intercomponent quenching process, i.e. energy vs. electron transfer, transient absorption spectroscopy was performed. The energy level diagram of 13 and the two individual mononuclear components is shown in Fig. 11. At room temperature, in acetonitrile solution, both 3*Ru(II)–Rh(III) and 3Ru(II)–*Rh(III) states could be quenched by the two electron-transfer processes, leading to a Ru(III)–Rh(II) state and subsequently to the ground Ru(II)–Rh(III) state. In theory, 3Ru(II)–*Rh(III) → 3*Ru(II)–Rh(III) energy transfer could also occur (ΔG° = −0.61 eV) at room temperature. However, the lack of observed energy transfer might be attributed to more efficient competition by the faster electron quenching process from 3Ru(II)–*Rh(III) → Ru(III)–Rh(II). By contrast, at 77 K or in a more rigid environment, this energy transfer is favourable, where both electron transfer quenching processes are blocked as a consequence of restricted solvent repolarization.

The hetero-dinuclear Ru(II)–Rh(III) complexes 14–16 consisting of two terdentate ligands (based on 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine, tpy), bridged by the rigid phenylene spacers of differing lengths, which gives variable metal–metal distances (11, 15.5 and 20 Å for n = 0, 1 and 2, respectively) were reported by Sauvage and coworkers (Fig. 9).121 The mechanisms of photoinduced electron and energy transfer in these complexes were discussed in detail. Interestingly, excited state 3Ru(II)–*(MC) Rh(III) → 3*(MLCT) Ru(II)–Rh(III) energy transfer was found to be efficient for all the complexes at both 77 and 150 K. However, electron transfer quenching did not occur for all the complexes at 77 K which is in line with the previous opinion of Scandola et al.120 Electron transfer quenching was observed at 150 K only in complex 14 (n = 0), and not in 15 and 16 (n = 1 and 2). This data indicates that electron transfer from excited Ru(II) to Rh(III) is efficient for 14 but not for the 15 and 16. The following rate constants for electron transfer from excited Ru(II) to Rh(III) were obtained: 14, 5 × 106 s−1; 15, 1 × 105 s−1; 16, 4 × 104 s−1. These results were rationalized in terms of more favourable electronic factors and smaller reorganizational energies for 13.


2.2.2 Förster energy transfer in phenylene bridged systems. 
In 2004, Vos et al. reported a series of Ru–Ru, Ru–Os and Os–Os dinuclear complexes 17–22 with triazole-based bridging ligands and m- or p-phenylene substitution (Fig. 12).123 The homo-dinuclear complexes 17, 19, 20 and 22 showed a similar redox potential corresponding to their mononuclear species. However, the hetero-dinuclear complexes 18 and 21 presented an exact superposition of the redox potentials of the isolated mononuclear Ru and Os components. This result indicated that the electronic interaction is insignificant between the two metal centers. The most interesting observation is that both hetro-dinuclear complexes 18 and 21 present dual emission at 77 K corresponding to their Ru(II) and Os(II) components, respectively (Fig. 13). The Ru emission parts in 18 and 21 are only 6% of the intensity in their homo-dinuclear analogues 17 and 20. The quenching of Ru(II) emission by the Os(II) center originates from the energy transfer mechanism. Excited state lifetime results revealed that both hetro-dinuclear complexes 18 and 21 showed much shorter lifetimes than the homo-dinuclear complexes. These results again demonstrated that energy transfer occurred from the Ru(II) component to the Os(II) component, consistent with the emission results above. An estimation of the energy transfer rate and the observation of temperature independent energy transfer rates for all complexes supported dipole–dipole (Förster) energy transfer as the dominant mechanism, rather than a through-bond Dexter mechanism via activated interligand hopping or superexchange which should show a strong temperature dependence. It is worth noting that the mechanism of energy transfer in protonated 18 (18H) at 293 K can be assigned to Dexter energy transfer because it is both protonated and para-substituted, which combine to enhance electronic coupling between the chromophores, favouring through-bond energy transfer.

2.2.3 Dexter energy transfer in phenylene bridged systems. 
To investigate the relationships between energy transfer and structural features a series of hetero-dinuclear Ru(II)–Os(II) complexes 23–26 (Fig. 14) connected by different conjugated lengths of para-phenylene bridging ligands (n = 2, 3, 4, 5) was reported by De Cola and coworkers in 2005.127 Basic photophysical data revealed energy transfer between the higher energy Ru(II) and the lower energy Os(II) components in all the complexes, which is consistent with the previous results of similar Ru–Os complexes with n-hexyl substituted bridging ligands.128 A schematic energy-level diagram for 23–26 is shown in Fig. 15a. The higher spin-allowed 1MLCT excited state was estimated from the UV absorption bands, and the spin-forbidden 3MLCT excited state was estimated from the 77 K emission for their mononuclear species. The triplet (3MLCT) energies of the Ru and Os components are 2.10 and 1.73 eV, respectively, thus the energy transfer process can be induced by an exergonic G = −0.37 eV. Time-resolved emission and sub-picosecond transient absorption spectroscopy were performed. The emission of the Ru(II) component is strongly quenched by the Os(II) component due to a very efficient energy transfer process. The energy transfer rate constants can be calculated from eqn (1), (1)where τ and τ0 are the lifetimes of the quenched and unquenched ruthenium based luminescence, respectively. In order to establish the role of the bridging ligands in the energy transfer process, similarity structured Ru–Os complexes with n-hexyl substituted bridging ligands were selected for comparison.128 The only difference in the two systems is that complexes 27–29 show an increased dihedral angle distortion of 65°, compared to 20° for 23–26. Thus, the presence of the bulky alkyl chains increases the tilt angle between the phenyl rings and therefore reduces the electronic communication along the phenylene spacers between the donor and acceptor moieties. The energy transfer rate constants are shown in Table 1. The rates are dramatically influenced by the conjugated chain length (n) and minor geometrical changes. The rates decrease for both dinuclear systems with the increased conjugated chain length (n). For n = 3, there is 90-fold increase for 24 with good planarization of the bridging ligand compared to 27. The difference in the energy transfer rates became smaller with the longest spacer with 5 phenylene units, with only 50-fold increase for 26 compared to 28. The above results indicated that the Dexter mechanism of energy transfer (superexchange mechanism between two chromophores). The observed faster energy transfer in 23–26 than in 27–30 can be attributed to the good co-planarity of the phenylenes in 23–26 since the distance between the chromophores is the same for both series of complexes.

Following the previous Ru–Os work, De Cola et al. reported a series of similarly structured hetero-dinuclear Ir(III)–Ru(II) complexes 30–33 (Fig. 14) with different conjugated length of p-phenylene bridging ligands (n = 2, 3, 4, 5).133 The Ir(III) and Ru(II) components act as donor and acceptor, respectively, thus, the energy transfer was observed from the Ir(III) to the Ru(II) component in the photophysical results.
The energy-level diagrams for 23–26 and 30–33 shown in Fig. 15 reveal an energy transfer route from the higher excited 3MLCT state of the Ir component to the lower excited 3MLCT state of the Ru component. The emission of the Ir(III) component is strongly quenched by the Ru(II) component, and the emission intensity and lifetime of the Ru(II) component in all the complexes 30–33 are not affected by the different lengths of the bridging ligands. Time-resolved emission and sub-picosecond transient absorption spectroscopy probed the mechanism of energy transfer. The energy transfer rates decreased slightly as the bridging ligand's length increased, which showed a different trend compared with the previously reported Ru–Os series (Fig. 16). This result indicated an incoherent hopping mechanism (almost independent of the donor–acceptor distance) due to good orbital overlap between the donor and the phenylene chain. The authors envisaged that for the [Ir–(C6H4)n–Ru]3+ series, the triplet energy transfer is effective over a very long distance (i.e., >20 nm) due to the long-lived excited state of such systems.

2.2.4 Intramolecular energy transfer in metal-center exchanged systems. 
Baitalik et al. reported two new hetero-dinuclear Ru(II)–Os(II) complexes 34 and 35 (Fig. 17)126 in which the metals are exchanged in the two subunits. However, no Ru unit emission is observed in the complexes which revealed that the quenching originates from the Ru(II) to the Os(II) and is not controlled by the ligands. The excited state energies of the Os based component in 34 and 35 were calculated as 1.81 eV and 1.88 eV, respectively, estimated from the energies at the intersection point of the UV-vis absorption and emission spectra in acetonitrile solution at room temperature. The excited state energies of the Ru based component in 34 and 35 are 2.30 eV and 2.17 eV, estimated from the E0–0 of their mononuclear complexes, respectively. Thus, the free energy change for energy transfer from the excited Ru-based component to the excited state of the Os-based component is −0.49 eV and −0.29 eV for 34 and 35, respectively (Fig. 18) which makes the intramolecular energy transfer process (*RuIIOsII → RuII*OsII and OsIIRuII* → OsII*RuII) thermodynamically favourable. Furthermore, the electronic quenching processes in both complexes were also considered. However, both photoinduced oxidative quenching (*RuIIOsII → RuIIIOsI) and reductive quenching (*RuIIOsII → RuIOsIII) are thermodynamically unfavourable. In addition, experimental excited lifetime results indicated an efficient and very fast (∼109 s−1) intramolecular energy transfer in both complexes.

2.2.5 Intramolecular energy transfer through structural modification of the peripheral ligands. 
To investigate the energy transfer from ruthenium to osmium by substituent control, Constable et al. reported two structurally similar Ru2–Os trinuclear complexes 36 and 37 (Fig. 19).122 The pendant thienyl ligands on 37 enhance the lifetime of the ruthenium 3MLCT state. For 36 and 37 the Ru and Os components are the donor and acceptor moieties, respectively. At room temperature, no energy transfer is observed for both complexes based on the emission spectra, which showed the signatures of the individual components. However, at 77 K, both complexes exhibited obvious energy transfer from Ru→Os; the Os unit emits strongly whereas the Ru unit emission was quenched to only 1% compared to its mononuclear complex. From time-resolved measurements the energy transfer rate constants were evaluated as 5.8 × 108 and 2.8 × 107 s−1 for 36 and 37, respectively, i.e. 20-fold higher in 36 than 37. Furthermore, temperature independent energy transfer revealed that the dipole–dipole Förster energy transfer mechanism was dominant for the Ru→Os energy transfer step within 36 and 37, which is in accord with Vos's opinion.123

2.2.6 Conformational effect on electron transfer processes. 
How the torsion angle affects the extent of long-range electronic coupling in D–B–A systems was first studied by Harriman and co-workers.139 As shown in Fig. 20, the complexes 38–41 are linked by an ethynylene-substituted biphenyl bridge that incorporates a constraining tether. The strap is intended to function as a ratchet giving access to a wide range of dihedral angles while keeping a fixed D–A distance. Triplet energy transfer rates were measured in a low temperature organic glass matrix to prevent any undesirable rotation from occurring. The results displayed a pronounced conformational dependence of the transfer rates between phenylene rings held at 0° and 90°. The electronic coupling was largest when the phenyl units were close to coplanar (φ = 30°). By contrast, at the largest dihedral angle (φ = 90°) the electronic coupling decreased drastically, resulting in a transfer rate that decreased by a factor of 80.
 Fig. 20  Molecular structures of complexes 38–41. 
In conclusion, these representative examples have illustrated the role played by the bridge, metal centers and peripheral ligands in the photoinduced electron and energy transfer processes. It has been shown that the electron and energy transfer is strongly influenced by the triplet excited state energy of the individual components, the length of the bridge and the conformation of the bridge. However, it is still difficult to predict the charge transfer mechanism in a polynuclear complex based on current knowledge. For example, a hopping mechanism was confirmed in the Ir–Ru system, rather than a superexchange mechanism in the Ru–Os system which possesses the same bridging ligands.127,133 Careful design of molecular structure can afford precise control of distance, energy gap and conformational effects which can promote future investigations of the photoinduced electron and energy transfer processes and the development of molecular-based devices.65

3. Optoelectronic devices
3.1 OLEDs and LEECs
Organic lighting and display devices including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)2,140–143 and light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs)7,144–147 have been exploited in the emerging technologies of solid-state lighting and flat panel displays. Classical multilayer OLEDs and simpler LEEC structures are shown in Fig. 21. The operating principle of OLEDs is: (1) electrons and holes are injected from the cathode and anode, respectively, under an external electrical field, (2) electrons and holes transfer through an electron transfer layer (ETL) and a hole transfer layer (HTL) respectively, via a hopping mechanism and arrive at the interface of the emission layer (EML), (3) electron–hole pairs form when electrons and holes accumulate at the LUMO and HOMO of the emissive material, leading to exciton generation, charge recombination and emission. For the fabrication of the emission layer in OLEDs, several techniques are available, such as vacuum deposition,148 conformal elastomeric masking,149 cold welding,150 thermal imaging,151 organic vapor jet printing,152 or solution processing.153 In the case of LEECs, two operational models, namely the electrodynamic (ED) model147,154–156 and the electrochemical doping (EDC) model157–160 have been proposed (Fig. 22). The fundamental difference is that the ED model assumes good carrier injection due to the accumulation of ions at the electrode interface, whereas the ECD model assumes carrier injection is promoted by the formation of a p–i–n junction upon doping of the organic semiconducting materials into the electrodes.146,161 For the fabrication of the emission layer in LEECs, solution processes (e.g., spin-coating or inkjet-printing techniques) are commonly used.

Since Thompson and coworkers reported the first phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) in 1998,3 electroluminescent materials have mainly focused on transition metal complexes, especially iridium complexes, which utilize singlet and triplet excitons to realize nearly 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) in the device.9,162–165 In contrast to PHOLEDs, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have recently emerged as new generation organo-electroluminescent materials for exciton harvesting in OLEDs.166–170 OLEDs based on TADF materials have even shown superior performance compared to the traditional PHOLEDs.1,171–174 In this section, a series of luminescent dinuclear complexes and their applications in OLEDs and LEECs are summarized.

3.1.1 Phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes. 
Since the seminal work by Watts and Güdel in the 1980s,177 phosphorescent cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes have attracted great interest due to their wide applications especially in the field of organo-electroluminescence. This is due to their extraordinary properties, namely: high phosphorescence quantum yields at room temperature from triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) states, suitable triplet state lifetime (in the order of μs), high thermal and photochemical stability for fabrication by vacuum deposition techniques, and a broad range of emission colors which can be tuned by modifying the structure of the ligands.178–180 Since Forrest and coworkers reported the first PHOLEDs based on an Ir(III) complex emitter in 1999,181 mononuclear Ir(III) complexes have received most attention due to their ease of synthesis and tuning of emission across the entire visible spectrum. Their structure–property relationships are now well understood.5,10,182,183
In contrast to the rigorous development of mononuclear iridium complexes, the fundamental chemistry and applications of dinuclear iridium complexes are under-developed. However, the dinuclear complexes invariably present special photophysical properties and functions compared with mononuclear species through tuning the bridging ligands and the cyclometalated ligands. For example, in the solid state, highly efficient emission, with aggregation-induced emission and mechanochromic luminescence properties, can be simultaneously realized in a dinuclear iridium system via selection of a flexible Schiff base bridging ligand.50,109,110 Furthermore, single-molecule white-light emission has been realized in a dinuclear iridium polymer through selection of two individual emitting color Ir(III) cores with a bulky conjugated bridging ligand.184 Therefore, it is of great significance to develop novel dinuclear iridium complexes.
Recently, a series of luminescent dinuclear Ir(III) complexes and their applications in OLEDs and LEECs have been reported.72 The highest EQE of diiridium-based PHOLEDs is 27.6% with green electroluminescence.78 The main challenge for diiridium-based OLEDs and LEECs is the to achieve efficient and stable blue and red electroluminescence, and to obtain white electroluminescence. Indeed, true-blue emissive diiridium complexes are very rare. In this section, representative luminescent Ir(III) complexes are presented with particular focus on their application in PHOLEDs. Furthermore, some guidelines for the future design of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes and their use in electroluminescent devices are provided based on more fundamental studies.
3.1.1.1 Sky blue/green-emitting dinuclear Ir(III) complexes. 
Obtaining a true-blue phosphor based on dinuclear Ir(III) complexes is still a huge challenge. A series of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes with sky-blue or green emission is shown in Fig. 23. Their photoluminescent and electroluminescent properties are listed in Table 2. A similar structural feature in all the complexes is the short conjugated bridging ligands that connect the two iridium centers which may increase the excited state energy gap to give the green or sky-blue emission.

Among these dinuclear Ir(III) complexes, N^O-type bridged derivatives commonly show bright green or sky-blue emission. In 2011, two neutral dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 42 and 43, bridged by the versatile dianionic terpyridine dicarboxylate ligand were reported by Mazzanti and coworkers.59 Both the solution 1H NMR spectra and DFT calculations revealed that ΛΛ and ΛΛ enantiomers co-exist in both complexes 43 and 43, whereas the meso form was not observed, which may be attributed to the interligand steric interactions. The UV absorption spectra of both complexes showed an intense absorption around 260 nm which was attributed to the spin-allowed ligand-centered (1LC) transitions, whereas the weak absorption at >400 nm was attributed to the singlet metal to ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) transitions. The absorption tail between 400–500 nm arises from the formally spin-forbidden 3MLCT transitions. Overall, both 42 and 43 showed absorption features that are similar to their analogous mononuclear species, which indicates a negligible contribution of the bridging ligand in the absorption process. Complexes 42 and 43 showed bright green or blue-green emission at room temperature with maximum emission wavelength at 538 and 477 nm, respectively. The photoluminescent quantum yields (PLQYs) of 42 and 43 are Φ 17.7% and 4.8%, respectively. The excited state lifetimes of 42 and 43 are 0.09 and 0.15 μs, respectively, which indicated the emission of both complexes is from 3MLCT states. The significant blue-shift of 43 compared to 42 can be attributed to the introduction of the F-substituents, which increases the HOMO–LUMO energy gap by lowering the energy level of the HOMO.
In 2011, Hajra et al. reported a new dinuclear Ir(III) complex 44 containing a pyrazine dicarboxylate bridging ligand.5844 showed bright green emission (PLQY = 38%) in dichloromethane solution at room temperature with maximum emission wavelength at 500 nm. DFT calculations showed that the HOMO of 44 is mainly centered on the cyclometallated ligands and metal d orbitals, whereas the LUMO is mainly centered on the bridging ligand. Thus, the emission of 44 can be attributed to the 3MLCT state.
In 2013, Sünkel et al. reported a new dinuclear Ir(III) complex 45, bridged by an oxamidato ligand.61 The crystal structure analysis revealed only the meso diastereoisomer (ΛΔ), which is in contrast to most reported crystal structures of chloride- or methoxide-bridged dinuclear Ir(III) complexes where the enantiomeric pair (ΛΛ and ΔΔ) is observed. In the emission spectrum of 45 two peaks were observed at room temperature: the main emission peak at 523 nm can be attributed to the 3MLCT, whereas the shoulder peak at around 560 nm can be attributed to the 3LC. This structureless emission is more obvious at 77 K. The PLQY of 45 is as high as 60%, suggesting that this kind of dinuclear Ir(III) complex could be used in future optoelectronic devices.
Subsequently, M’hamedi et al. reported two new dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 46 and 47 with oxamidato-type bridging ligands and investigated their electroluminescent properties in OLEDs.185 The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 46 and 47 revealed that both the meso and racemic forms (two enantiomers, ΛΛ and ΔΔ) as a diastereomeric mixture (ratio = 3:2) exist in both complexes. Whereas the μ-dichloro-bridged precursor of 46 and 47, showed only faint emission in solution, 46 and 47 are highly emissive (ΦPL 73% and 63%) with short excited state lifetimes of τp 0.84 and 1.16 μs, respectively. Inspired by the superior photoluminescent properties, the electroluminescent properties of 46 and 47 were investigated. The PHOLED structures and energy levels of component materials are shown in Fig. 24. PEDOT:PSS is a hole-transport layer, poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is the host material, OXD-7 and TPBi are electron transporting materials to optimize charge balance and confine excitons in the emitter layer. The electroluminescent performance is shown in Fig. 24 and Table 2. Very bright green electroluminescence was observed for both 46 (533 nm) and 47 (533 nm) with Lmax > 25000 cd m−2 which is among the brightest PHOLEDs fabricated using dinuclear Ir(III) complexes. The maximum EQEs of 46 and 47 are 2.95% and 3.46%, respectively.

In 2013, Graf et al. reported a new dinuclear complex 48 with an unprecedented N,N′:O,O′-type bridging ligand.186 The X-ray crystal structure revealed two N donor atoms coordinated with one iridium center in a four-membered chelate ring, whereas two O donor atoms coordinated with the other iridium center in a six-membered chelate ring. At room temperature, complex 48 exhibits bright green emission in both solution state and doped into poly(methy methacrylate) (PMMA) (ΦPL 27% and 55%) with short excited lifetimes (0.7 μs and 1.5 μs) respectively. These results indicated this kind of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes is promising for future applications in OLEDs.
In 2014, Zheng et al. reported three new dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 49–51, bridged by diarylhydrazide ligands.96 Similar to the previously reported dinuclear Ir(III) complexes, the meso (ΛΔ/ΔΛ) and rac (ΛΛ/ΔΔ) diastereomeric mixtures were found in this system. The diastereomers were readily separated by using their different solubilities to give pure 49 (ΛΔ/ΔΛ, 41% yield) and 50 (ΛΛ/ΔΔ, 30% yield). Both complexes 49 and 50 showed very bright green emission at room temperature with a peak at 521 nm and 523 nm, respectively, high PLQYs of 71% and 88%, and short excited lifetimes (1.45 μs and 1.44 μs) respectively. Solution-processed OLEDs were fabricated in the simple architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS (50 nm)/PVK:PBD (40%):Ir complex (5%) (90 nm)/Ba (4 nm)/Al (100 nm). (PBD is an electron-transport material). The electroluminescent performance of complexes 49 and 50 is shown in Fig. 25 and Table 2. The parent Ir(III) dimers [Ir2(ppy)4Cl2] and [Ir2(flpy)4Cl2] were selected for comparison. Both complexes 49 and 50 showed obviously better electroluminescent properties than their parent Ir(III) dimers. The best device performance was for 50 with peak CE, PE and EQE of 37 cd A−1, 14 lm W−1 and 11%, respectively. These superior data compared to 49 were attributed to the better solubility of 50 than 49. It is worth noting that the electroluminescent performance of 49 and 50 is higher than the benchmark PHOLED based on the mononuclear green [Ir(ppy)3] complex, using a solution processed emitter layer. This work proved that dinuclear Ir(III) complexes are a viable strategy to obtain highly efficient OLEDs.

Recently, a follow-up study on complexes 52–59 examined the effects of substitution on the bridging and cyclometalating ligands.94 The diastereomers which formed in all these complexes were cleanly separated due to their different solubilities. Thus, their photophysical properties were investigated individually. Complexes 52–55 are almost non-emissive in both the solution state and in PMMA films at room temperature. However, the emission of both complexes can be detected at 77 K, thus the behaviour at room temperature can be explained by considering thermal population of low-lying non-emissive MC excited states.187 Complexes 56–59 showed faint emission in the solution state, which was attributed to the non-radiative quenching through motion of the bridging unit. By contrast, they showed bright green emission with a peak at 493–515 nm, and PLQYs of 42–68% in the PMMA state. Overall, it can be concluded that both the bridging and cyclometalating ligands play a significant role in the photophysical properties for all the complexes.
More recently, Congrave et al. developed a new series of diarylhydrazide-bridged diiridium complexes 60–68188 that showed highly efficient emission in the both solution and doped film states, high kr, relatively short τp and in some cases notably sharp emission. Especially, complexes 66–68 exhibit sky-blue emission which is rare for diiridium complexes. A combination of X-ray molecular structures and computational studies revealed that the strong intramolecular π–π interactions (Fig. 26) between bridging ligand and cyclometalated ligand play a vital role in the observed excellent photophysical properties of the complexes. Furthermore, it was evident that the intramolecular π–π interactions are promoted by the introduction of fluorine substituents onto the phenyl rings of the bridging ligand. This work offers a new method for the future development of deeper blue emitting diiridium complexes.

In 2009, Tennyson et al. reported a novel dinuclear complex 69, bridged by an N-heterocyclic carbene ligand.6269 displayed blue-green phosphorescence with a peak at 497 nm; the PLQY and excited state lifetimes were 11% and 0.79 μs, respectively. Solution electrochemistry revealed no observable electronic communication between the two Ir units. Furthermore, the similar emission properties of 69 compared to its analogous mononuclear complex indicated that benzimidazolylidene coordination to an [Ir(ppy)2] fragment neither perturbs the emissive state nor facilitates interaction between the sub-units.
In 2015, Sánchez and coworkers reported a series of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 70–74 with doubly alkynyl bridging ligands.189 The structural characterization revealed that unique diastereoisomers (ΛΛ/ΔΔ) were observed in complexes 70–72 and 74, whereas two diastereoisomer (ΔΛ and ΛΛ/ΔΔ) mixtures were obtained in 73. All the complexes 70–74 were non-emissive in the solid state which can be attributed to the typical aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ), whereas they showed relatively stronger emission in the 505–515 nm region in degassed solutions. The PLQYs were in the range of 0.7 to 2.4%, which are higher than the parent chloride-bridged dimer due to the introduction of the strong-field alkynyl group. The low quantum yields for 70–74 in solution can be attributed to the relatively fast σ/π alkynyl exchange between the Ir centers which could favor an efficient radiationless decay pathway.
In 2012, a series of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 75–79 with N^N-type bridging ligands were reported by Omary and coworkers.190 Electrochemical studies revealed weak interaction between the two Ir units in complex 77, bridged by ethylene-based ligands, which was shown by the appearance of two oxidation waves. In contrast the metal centers are electronically isolated in 75 and 76 in which the bridging ligands are based on ethane and propane linkers.
A one-electron reduced species located on the diimine-based bridging ligand was observed in 78 as revealed by the presence of two reversible reductions. No interaction was found in 79 where the electronic conduit is interrupted by the ethylene spacer in the bridging ligand. The emission spectra of 75–79 in acetonitrile are shown in Fig. 27. Complexes 75 and 76 have similar structured emission at 480 and 510 nm with a shoulder at 548 nm, which can be attributed to the mixed 3LC and 3MLCT states. The PLQYs of 75 and 76 are 45% and 48%, respectively. By contrast, broad and unstructured emission was observed in the complexes 77–79, which can be attributed to the mixed 3MLCT and 3LLCT states, supported by the DFT calculations. The PLQYs of 77–79 are 41%, 51% and 12%, respectively.

In 2016, Ye et al. developed a useful tactic for avoiding the formation of diastereomeric mixtures in dinuclear Ir(III) complex via a chiral precursor strategy, using L- or D-proline as an auxiliary ligand.95 Thus, the enantiomers 1 (ΛΛ) and 2 (ΔΔ) with a dipyrimidine bridging ligand were synthesized separately. The emission spectra of 1 and 2 were similar: both complexes showed structured blue emission with a peak at 436 nm and a shoulder at 465 nm in DCM solution. These two dinuclear complexes show the bluest emission of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes reported to date.
Recently a milestone study on a series of diiridium complexes 80–83 bearing novel 2-pyrazolyl-6-phenyl pyridine chelate and bidentate phenyl imidazolylidene chelate ligands was reported by Chi and co-workers.78 All these complexes exhibited highly stable and efficient emission with near-unity PLQYs in both the solution and solid film states. In stark contrast to most of the previously reported solution-processed OLEDs based on diiridium complexes, the good volatility of complexes 80–83, enabled their OLEDs to be fabricated by vacuum evaporation. The devices showed impressive performance (Fig. 28), especially the green emissive complex 81 gave a record high EQE for a diiridium complex of 27.6%. This value is also comparable to the top-tier green OLEDs using mononuclear Ir(III) dopants. However, further optimization of the device structures to avoid obvious roll-off at high luminance is desirable.

3.1.1.2 Yellow/orange-emitting dinuclear Ir(III) complexes. 
The archetypal parent iridium dimer, [Ir(ppy)2μ-Cl]2 (84) has been widely used as a precursor in the synthesis of mono- and multinuclear iridium complexes, following the initial report by Watts et al. in 1993.191 Ir(III) dimer 84 is a green emitter with λmax at 517 nm, and a very low efficiency (ΦPL = 0.5%) that limits its application in OLEDs. Following Watts’ protocol, a series of luminescent dinuclear Ir(III) dimers with atomic bridges were developed by other researchers, and they commonly showed yellow to orange emission (Fig. 29).
 Fig. 29  Dinuclear Ir(III) complexes with yellow or orange emission. 
In 2012, a series of luminescent chloro-bridge Ir(III) dimers 85–89 developed by M'hamedi et al.74 all showed brighter yellow emission, compared to the parent dimer 84. The PLQYs of 85–87 are in the range of 21–41%, whereas the lower luminescence of 88 and 89 may be due to the different electronic structure induced by the position of the substituent group on the pyridine ligands (4-substitution in 88 and 89). Devices were fabricated in the simple structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK–PBD (40%)–complex (5%)/Ba/Al. The detailed photophysical and device performance data are shown in Table 3. The device based on complex 85 showed yellow electrophosphorescence with a maximum brightness of ∼2200 cd m−2 and EQE of 4%. These results further challenged the well-established view that dinuclear species are not viable as dopants for electrophosphorescent OLEDs. The follow-up studies used these chloro-bridged Ir(III) dimers as precursors to obtain a series of novel isocyanate-bridged Ir(III) dimers 90–92 and investigated their photophysical and electroluminescent properties (Table 3).74 Their photoluminescent and electroluminescent spectra were consistent with their precursors 85–87 with bright yellow emission. However, the device performance based on 90–92 dopant showed obvious improvement with a maximum brightness and CE of ∼3700 cd m−2 and 10.3 cd A−1, respectively.

In 2015, four new luminescent chloro-bridged Ir(III) dimers 93–96 were reported by Zysman-Colman and coworkers.76 Their photophysical properties were investigated in detail. The key findings were: (i) compared to the parent dimer 84, a red-shift in emission for all complexes within the range of 563–611 nm can be attributed to the introduction of formyl groups into the structures. (ii) A gradual increase of PLQY was observed as the numbers of formyl groups increased. This can be attributed to the more extensive hydrogen bonding interactions, which resulted in a large decrease in knr. OLEDs were fabricated with the structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/CBP:PBD:Ir complex (60:30:10, w/w)/B3PYMPM/Ca/Al. (B3PYMPM is an electron-transport material). The device based on 96 as dopant showed the best performance with maximum brightness of >6000, CE of 9.9 cd A−1, PE of 2.16 lm W−1 and EQE of 2.59% (Fig. 30 and Table 3). The poor device performances based on 93 and 95 dopants were suggested to originate from either incomplete host-to-guest energy transfer (93) or exciplex emission (95) (Fig. 31). For 94 and 96 the emission was nearly independent of the current density, demonstrating highly efficient host-to-guest energy transfer and no significant exciplex contribution.

In 2012, Ding et al. synthesized a novel methoxy-bridged Ir(III) dimer 97 by reacting chloride-bridged Ir(III) dimer with the mixtures of sodium methanolate and N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)methacrylamide ligand in DCM under dinitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 48 h.192 At room temperature in DCM, 97 showed strong emission with a peak at 539 nm and weak shoulders at 447 and 474 nm. However, upon storing the solution under visible light overnight the peak at 539 nm disappeared, whereas the two weak shoulders at 447 and 474 nm strengthen and dominate the spectrum. This data suggested that 97 has poor photostability.
In 2012, Chandrasekhar et al. reported three new heterobridged Ir(III) dimers 98–100 by reacting chloride-bridged Ir(III) dimer with mixtures of sodium methanolate and 3,5-diphenylpyrazole (Ph2PzH) ligand.193 Cyclic voltammetric studies indicated that 98–100 showed quasi-reversible redox process. For example, complex 98 showed two consecutive one-electron oxidation waves with the oxidation peaks at 0.62 and 0.95 V (Fig. 32), whereas no reduction process was observed. The two oxidation processes can be assigned to the stepwise oxidation of the two Ir(III) centers, i.e., Ir(III)–Ir(III)/Ir(III)–Ir(IV) and Ir(III)–Ir(IV)/Ir(IV)–Ir(IV) couples. The presence of two sequential redox waves clearly indicates electronic coupling between the two Ir centers which are effectively mediated by the hydroxyl bridge, supported by the DFT and TDDFT calculations. Photophysical studies demonstrated that 98–100 are phosphorescent emitters with λmax at around 550 nm at room temperature in DCM solution. The PLQYs range from 11–17%.

In 2012, Bruce, Williams et al. obtained a series of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 101–106 bridged by the 1,1,2,2-tetraacetylethane (tae) ligand.194 Two diastereomeric forms (meso and rac) were observed in all the complexes in 1H NMR studies, and diastereomers of 101 and 104 were successfully separated by column chromatography, but no further structural characterization confirmed which isomer is which. All the complexes showed intense emission in the green-yellow to orange regions in DCM solution at room temperature. The PLQYs of all the complexes are ca. 50% which is even higher than typical Ir(III)–acac complexes with simple ppy ligands. Interestingly, complexes 102, 104, 105 and 106 (Table 4) are mesomorphic liquid-crystalline materials, showing a columnar hexagonal mesophase (Fig. 33), whereas 101 is not mesomorphic due to the low coverage of the dimer periphery by alkoxy chains. Furthermore, the morphology is a delicate function of the substitution position of the chains as 103 is not mesomorphic, whereas 104 is mesomorphic.

In 2010, a new neutral dinuclear Ir(III) complex 107 with a bis(β-diketonato) bridging ligand was reported by Do's group.118107 showed a weak emission band at 615 nm with low quantum efficiency (ΦPL = 2.3%) in degassed CHCl3 solution, whereas bright orange emission with λmax at 597 nm was observed in the solid state. This indicates that 107 may be aggregation-induced emission (AIE) active. X-ray crystal-packing analysis suggests that the AIE mechanism could derive from the strong π–π intermolecular interactions between adjacent pyridine rings of F2ppy ligands.
N^N-type bridged Ir(III) complexes with long conjugated chains commonly show yellow to orange emission. In 2000, Campagna et al. developed a new synthetic approach by applying nickel-catalysed coupling reactions to a [Ir-(ppy)2(Cl-phen)]+ precursor to give the dinuclear Ir(III) complex 108.195 Cyclic voltammetric studies of 108 indicated two-electron reductions occurred in the two phenanthroline units of the bridging ligand which may be induced by the non-planar bridging structure, because of the strong steric constraints. Complex 108 showed orange-red emission with λmax at 617 nm (ΦPL = 12.3%, τ = 0.39 μs) in deaerated acetonitrile solution at room temperature, originating from the 3MLCT state, supported by the electrochemical and UV absorption studies.
In 2003, De Cola and coworkers synthesized two oligo-p-phenylene bridged ionic dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 109 and 110 by a standard Suzuki coupling reaction.196 At room temperature, both 109 and 110 exhibited orange-red emission with peaks at 608 and 606 nm and lifetimes of 72 and 75 ns, respectively, in equilibrated acetonitrile solution. The mononuclear species [Ir(ppy)2bpy] which was studied for comparison (Fig. 34), gave an intense absorption band in the 400–550 nm region, with a weaker band at 650–800 nm. Such bands can be attributed to the population of the 3MLCT state and showed a lifetime around 60 ns. However, for dinuclear complex 110, a wide band that covered the entire 400–850 nm region was observed which can be assigned to the Ph4 substituted bpy. This result indicated that the emission of complexes 109 and 110 originates from mixed 3MLCT and 3LC states. PHOLEDs showed a low efficiency with maximum CE and EQE values for 110 of 0.23 cd A−1 and 0.1%, respectively.197

The introduction of F atoms into the cyclometalating ligands induces a blue-shift in the emission with a peak at 546 nm for complex 111 compared to complexes 109 and 110.56 Similar transient absorption spectra of 111 to the complexes 109 and 110 again suggested that the emission is from mixed 3LC and 3MLCT excited states. A longer decay within ca. 86 μs measured by transient absorption spectra do not agree with the fluorescence lifetimes in this case, suggesting that the 3LC excited state may be partly formed by direct excitation of the bridging ligand and a rapid intersystem crossing facilitated by the presence of the heavy atom.
In 2010, Bolink and Martín et al. reported two cationic dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 112 and 113 featuring an oligo-p-(phenyleneethynylene) bridge and ethylene units which break conjugation between the two Ir centers.117 The PLQYs of both complexes were extremely low at around 9 × 10−3. The detailed photophysical properties and theoretical calculations indicated that the lowest triplet excited state is located on the conjugated spacer (3LC) which is below the 3MLCT/3LLCT emitting states and, therefore, favours a non-radiative transition. This unfavourable energy alignment explains the low PLQYs observed for dinuclear 112 and 113 with respect to the mononuclear complexes. Their electroluminescent properties were also investigated as the emitter in LEECs fabricated with the structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (100 nm)/complex 112 or 113/ionic liquid (IL) (molar ratio = 1:1) (80 nm)/Al; ionic liquid (IL) is known to improve the performance of LEECs. Upon applying a bias of 3 V, the luminance and current density increased in a typical time-delayed response and reflected the mechanism of device operation for which the PF6− counter-ions have to reach the interface of the electrodes to enhance the charge-injection process (Fig. 35). The devices showed faint EL (<10 cd m−2) with λmax at 596 nm and 540 nm, respectively for 112 and 113. The maximum EQEs for 112 and 113 are very low at 0.16 and 0.13%, respectively. These values are close to the theoretical maxima of 0.20 and 0.16% estimated from the PLQY data, indicating that self-quenching in the devices had been minimized.

In 2012, Harvey and coworkers reported two dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 114 and 115, employing a diyne moiety at the 5-position of the bipyridyl bridged ligand.1131H NMR results indicated a diastereomeric mixture, which was not separated, in both 114 and 115. At room temperature, complex 115 showed yellow emission with λmax at 558 nm in 2-MeTHF solution which is significantly blue-shifted compared to 114 with λmax at 647 nm due to the presence of the electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms on 115 which decreases the HOMO level and effectively increases the energy gap. A DFT and TDDFT study revealed that the emission process is dominated by mixed 3MLCT/3LLCT states.
In 2013, to realize two-photon-excited-phosphorescence (TPEP) probes for F− ions, Zhao et al. designed and synthesized a new cationic dinuclear Ir(III) complex 116, featuring a D–A–π–A–D conjugated oligomer as the bridging ligand and dimesitylboryl groups on the cyclometalated C^N ligands (Bpq).198116 showed an optical absorption intensity twice that of the corresponding mononuclear analogue. Furthermore, complex 116 showed an intense absorption band at λmax 448 nm with a molar extinction coefficient (ε) as high as 104, which is rare for Ir(III) complexes. Complex 116 showed an intense orange-red emission upon excitation at 400 nm with a peak at around 606 nm in DCM (Fig. 36a). The PLQY and lifetimes are 13% and 0.6 μs, respectively, indicating classical one-photon-excited-phosphorescence (OPEP). In consideration of the large conjugated structure and the charge-transfer properties of 116, the TPEP properties were also investigated. As shown in Fig. 36a, upon femtosecond excitation at 800 nm, 116 showed emission features that are almost identical with the OPEP which was excited at 400 nm, revealing classical TPEP. The mechanisms of OPEP and TPEP are depicted in Fig. 36b. In view of the previously reported results that F− ions can be recognized by arylborane ligands due to the strong B–F interaction, sensing of F− ions was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 36c and d, upon excitation at 442 and 800 nm, respectively, the emission intensity of 116 gradually decreased with an increasing concentration of F− ions, revealing that F− can be efficiently detected by both OPEP and TPEP processes. It is worth noting that complex 116 was the first reported TPEP probe for F− ions.

In 2015, Chao's group reported a series of dinuclear complexes 117–123 with bright orange emission.87 The PLQY and lifetimes of these complexes in DMSO/PBS solution were in the range of 9.8–33.6% and 380–607 ns, respectively. In this work, 118–123 were firstly shown to serve as mitochondrial imaging dyes with low cytotoxicity and high resistance to the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential characteristics. Furthermore, 119 and 122 were further developed for tracking mitochondrial morphological changes during the early stages of apoptosis.
In 2015, we developed a series of cationic dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 4–8, featuring versatile Schiff base bridging ligands.50,85 They all showed faint emission in the solution state, whereas bright orange phosphorescence was observed in the aggregated state demonstrating classical AIPE behaviour. Furthermore, due to the good flexibility of the Schiff base bridging ligands, the molecular arrangements are relatively loose and can be easily destroyed by the force of manual grinding in a mortar and pestle, resulting in mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) with a change from orange to red emission clearly observed. Upon organic vapour treatment, or heating of the ground samples, the emission color reverted to the original orange, revealing reversible MCL. In summary, the flexible Schiff base bridging ligand plays an important role in achieving AIPE and MCL simultaneously. Benefiting from these combined properties, a perchlorate anion phosphorescent sensor and a phosphorescence re-writable data recording device were successfully fabricated.
In 2017, we disclosed two new neutral dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 11 and 12, bearing two N^O-type Schiff base bridging ligands.109,11011 and 12 are bright yellow (587 nm, ΦPL = 20%) and orange (608 nm, ΦPL = 24%) emitters, respectively, in the solid state. As expected, both complexes showed AIPE and MCL simultaneously. In view of the highly efficient emission of both complexes in the solid state due to AIPE, an efficient second-level anti-counterfeit trademark and highly selective organic vapour sensors were fabricated using 11 and 12 as the active materials, respectively.
In 2017, a new cationic dinuclear Ir(III) complex 124, bearing triazole–pyridine moieties linked with a flexible bridging chain was reported by our group.86 Complex 124 showed faint emission (571 nm, ΦPL = 6.2%) in pure acetonitrile solution, whereas stronger emission (550 nm, ΦPL = 20%) was observed in CH3CN/H2O solution (v:v = 1:9) indicating the occurrence of AIPE. A highly sensitive and selective “turn-off” sensor for 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) was fabricated using 124 as probe. The sensing mechanism was attributed to the efficient photoinduced electron transfer and strong electrostatic interaction between 124 and TNP.
In 2011, two Ir(III) soft salts formed from dinuclear cationic and mononuclear anionic complexes, bearing a carbazolyl (125) or p-phenylene bridge (126) were reported by Meyer and coworkers.75 The photoluminescence peaks for 125 and 126 in the solid state are at 594 and 557 nm, respectively. OLEDs using soft salts as emitters were fabricated for the first time with the simple structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/PVK (20 nm)/125 or 126/Ca (300 nm)/Al (60 nm). The devices showed electroluminescence peaks at λmax 570 and 621 nm, respectively. The highest CE and PE are 0.44 cd A−1 and 0.17 lm W−1 for 125 and 0.06 cd A−1 and 0.03 lm W−1 for 126, respectively. The poor device performances for both complexes may be attributed to self-quenching effects, and/or to the electron/energy transfer to the conjugated bridging ligands. The higher device performance for 125 may be due to the better charge-carrier injection and transport ability of the carbazole moiety compared with the phenylene spacer in 126.
In 2016, a series of C^N-type bridged Ir(III) dinuclear complexes 127–132 with short conjugated bridging ligands (2-phenylpyrimidine derivatives) were reported by Zhou and coworkers.114,115 The corresponding mononuclear complexes were also obtained. All the mono- and dinuclear complexes were successfully separated by column chromatography due to their different molecular dipole moments. The dinuclear complexes 127–132 showed intense orange phosphorescence (τ = 0.18–0.48 μs) red-shifted relative to the corresponding mononuclear analogues. The PLQYs of 127–132 are in the range of 36–68% in CH2Cl2 solution, which are high values for an orange-red diiridium complex. Solution-processed OLEDs based on all the dinuclear complexes were fabricated with a simple device structure. The detailed performance of the devices is summarized in Table 3. Complex 130 (8 wt%) gave outstanding electroluminescent performance (Fig. 37) with the peak luminance, EQE, CE and PE of 46206 cd m−2, 17.9%, 52.5 cd A−1 and 51.2 lm W−1, respectively (Fig. 38).

3.1.1.3 Red-emitting dinuclear Ir(III) complexes. 
Red-emitting Ir(III) complexes are important for achieving highly efficient multi-component white emission with good color purity. Generally, a small energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels is needed. Compared with mononuclear Ir(III) complexes, dinuclear Ir(III) complexes are more suitable candidates for red emitters by tuning the conjugation length of the bridging ligands or by attaching electron-withdrawing moieties onto the bridging ligands.
In 2001, two dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 133 and 134, and their corresponding mononuclear analogues were reported by Campagna's group.116 The UV-vis absorption spectra revealed that the MLCT band is significantly more intense in 133, which features an asymmetric bridging ligand, compared with 134. This suggests that the CT transition from the Ir center to the bridging L–C(O)O unit of 133 has a stronger oscillator strength than to the bridging L–OC(O) unit of 134. Furthermore, the molar absorption coefficient of the MLCT band of 134 is almost twice that of the corresponding mononuclear complex.
This indicates that the second metal center promotes light absorption. Both 133 and 134 showed red emission with λmax at 638 and 620 nm, respectively, in CH2Cl2 solution. The corresponding PLQYs and excited lifetimes are 4%, 0.17 μs for 133, and 4.5%, 0.19 μs for 134. Compared with 134, the significant red-shift of 133 can be attributed to the photo-induced intramolecular energy transfer from the MLCT (Ir→L–OC(O)) to MLCT (Ir→L–C(O)O) across the asymmetric bridging ligand.
In 2004, Tsuboyama et al. reported a neutral dinuclear Ir(III) complex 135 that exhibited red phosphorescence in both solution and solid states.199 The emission λmax is at 665 nm in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran; the corresponding PLQY and lifetimes are 4% and 2 μs, respectively. By contrast, no emission was observed for the cationic dinuclear Ir(III) complex 136, which was reported by Zysman-Colman et al. in 2013.60
In 2007, Auffrant et al. reported three red emitters 137–139.69 Importantly, the three isomers were separated by using [n-Bu4N][Δ-TRISPHAT] as a resolving agent. The tris(tetrachlorobenzenediolato)phosphate(V) anion (TRISPHAT) is well established as a powerful resolving agent for chiral cationic organometallic complexes. The luminescent properties of 137–139 are essentially identical to one another with weak emission in the red region (λmax = 654 nm, ΦPL ∼ 0.6%, τ ∼ 0.05 μs).
In 2014, two new ionic dinuclear Ir(III) Schiff base complexes 9 and 10 were reported by our group.111 Both complexes showed faint emission in the solution state, whereas intense emission was observed in aggregated or solid state. Adding the poor solvent water into dilute solutions of the complexes, led to a remarkable increase in the emission intensity when the water fraction exceeded ca. 60% (Fig. 39a). These were the first examples of dinuclear ionic Ir(III) complexes that display aggregation-induced phosphorescent emission (AIPE). The mechanism of AIPE can be attributed to the restriction of intermolecular motion (RIM) through the intermolecular interactions (Fig. 39b), which are seen by X-ray crystal structure analysis and TD-DFT calculations. In a neat film state, both complexes 9 and 10 exhibited intense red emission with λmax at 644 and 692 nm, respectively. Complex 10 is among the most red emissive ionic Ir(III) complex to date. The corresponding PLQYs are as high as 37% and 26% for 9 and 10, respectively. These data indicate that highly efficient ionic transition metal complexes (iTMCs) can be realized by designing AIPE-active ionic dinuclear Ir(III) complexes.

In 2008, Williams et al. reported two dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 140 and 141 that feature two cyclometalating terdentate ligands in the structure.68 In CH3CN solution, both complexes showed similar emission properties (λem = 632 nm, ΦPL ∼ 2.7%, τ ∼ 0.14 μs).
In 2014, two isomeric dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 142 and 143, bridged by a terdentate N^C^N ligand were reported by Kozhevnikov and coworkers.200 The luminescent properties of the two complexes are essentially identical to one another, with red phosphorescence at λmax 625 nm in CH2Cl2 solution. The PLQYs are as high as 65%, which are amongst the best values for red phosphorescent emitters known to date. This work supported a new strategy for obtaining highly efficient diiridium complexes and further application in OLEDs. Moreover, this new class of complexes are also highly desirable candidates as sensitisers in both dye-sensitised solar cells and in photocatalysed water splitting due to their strong absorption in the orange-to-red region.
In summary, highly efficient green and yellow/orange emitting OLEDs based on diiridium complexes emitters have been achieved in the past three years by both solution processing and vacuum evaporation, which challenges the previous misconception that dinuclear complexes are poor phosphors and usually show unsatisfactory performance in OLEDs. However, some challenges still remain in the future work: (i) unlike their monoiridium analogues, highly stable and efficient deep-blue emissive diiridium complexes are still absent: further ingenious molecular design and a short conjugated bridge unit may solve this issue. (ii) Red emissive diiridium complexes can be easily designed by installing long conjugated bridging ligands between the iridium centers. However, highly efficient red emissive diiridium complexes are still rare. Modified designs that avoid intramolecular energy processes from MLCT to LC (bridging ligand center) states may enhance the emission. (iii) Further optimization of device structures to improve the EL performance with low roll-off is still needed. It is worth noting that the AIPE-active diiridium complexes which exhibit intense emission in the solid and pure film states are potential candidates in non-doped (neat film) OLEDs. Particularly, the first non-doped OLEDs based on AIPE-active mononuclear Ir(III) species with extremely simple device structures have been fabricated by Shan and co-workers, with a high current efficiency and EQE of 25.7 cd A−1 and 7.6%, respectively.201


3.1.2 TADF-active Cu(I) complexes. 
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, which utilize up-conversion of triplet excitons to the singlet excited state by reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) to efficiently harvest both singlet and triplet excitons (Fig. 40) have emerged as third-generation organic electroluminescent materials.169,202,203 In 2009, Adachi et al. reported a Sn(IV)–porphyrin complex as a TADF material that utilized both singlet and triplet excitons in an OLED.140 Since then, various TADF materials have been designed and synthesized, such as organic small molecules,167,203,204 Cu(I) complexes,168,205,206 Au(I) complexes,1 organic exciplexes,207 organic polymers,202 quantum dots208 and CDs@zeolite.166 TADF-active Cu(I) complexes can exhibit advantages with respect to the other kinds of TADF materials,205,209,210 such as: (i) Cu(I) complexes often have a small energy separation between the lowest singlet S1 and triplet T1 states due to the transitions of distinct metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character; (ii) Cu(I) complexes can show pure TADF emission without a small amount of prompt fluorescence contributions due to the strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC), in contrast to the pure organic molecules; (iii) dual emission (TADF and phosphorescence) is usually observed in Cu(I) complexes, and this could effectively decrease transient singlet or triplet exciton concentrations and further restrict singlet–triplet and triplet–triplet annihilation (STA and TTA, respectively) which normally exist in PH and TADF-based OLEDs. Numerous TADF-active mononuclear Cu(I) complexes have been reported.205 However, mononuclear Cu(I) complexes often suffer from the structural distortion in the excited state which reduces PL and EL efficiency. Accordingly, dinuclear Cu(I) complexes which possess more a rigid molecular conformation have attracted much attention in recent years.211,212 Dinuclear Cu(I) complexes show three advantages with respect to the mononuclear analogues:205,209,211 (i) dinuclear Cu(I) complexes usually exhibit a smaller energy gap between S1 and T1 states, and a small ΔEST is regarded as the most important criterion for achieving high TADF efficiency; (ii) the more rigid conformation of dinuclear Cu(I) complexes can effectively restrict non-radiative channels and give high PL and EL efficiencies; (iii) introduction of another metal atom can effectively enhance the SOC and further realize phosphorescence and TADF dual emission. In this section, representative progress in TADF-active dinuclear Cu(I) complexes will be discussed.

3.1.2.1 TADF-active dinuclear Cu(I) complexes. 
Most investigations of dinuclear Cu(I) complexes are focused on halogenido-bridged systems because they usually show small ΔEST.205 The ΔEST data of representative examples are summarized in Fig. 41 and Table 5. This kind of complex is usually synthesized via classical solution-based reactions or through the evaporation of the organic ligand together with CuI to further obtain CuI-based dinuclear complexes.209

In recent years, Yersin's group have extensively developed the photophysics of TADF-active Cu(I) complexes. In 2013, a series of halogenido-bridged Cu(I) complexes 144–148 with chelating ligands exhibiting N and P donors were synthesized.213,214 The emitting states of the complexes were attributed mainly to the singlet excited state corresponding to a TADF process at ambient temperature. It is worth noting that the complexes 146 and 147 exhibited rare blue emission among halogenido-bridged Cu(I) complexes with a maximum emission peak at 464 and 465 nm, respectively.
In 2014, the TADF mechanism of 149 was studied by Yersin et al.211 At 77 K, 149 showed long-lived phosphorescence with a decay time of 2200 μs, whereas a short-lived decay time of 3 μs can be observed at room temperature. A small ΔEST of 600 cm−1 (74 meV) calculated from the emission spectra at 298 and 77 K indicated that the emission of 149 at room temperature originated from TADF. The short-lived TADF lifetime (∼3 μs) showed that this kind of Cu(I) complex is promising for applications in OLEDs.
In 2015, three new Cu(I) complexes 150–152 with high PLQYs in the range of 52–92% at room temperature were reported by Yersin's group.206 The detailed photophysical investigations indicated that the emitting states for all complexes at room temperature originate from combined TADF and fast phosphorescence. For example, the ratio of TADF:phosphorescence for complex 150 is 80%:20%. Thus, the overall emission decay time for the complex is reduced when compared with the pure TADF emission. This work represented a very promising way for engineering novel dual emissive Cu(I) complexes.
In 2016, Yersin et al. reported a Cu(I) complex 153, bearing iodine bridges and an additional bidentate ligand (N∧P), which exhibited the smallest ΔEST (270 cm−1; 34 meV) so far reported in a Cu(I) complex (Fig. 41 and Table 5).209 The small ΔEST facilitates highly efficient TADF with a short decay time of 5 μs. Introduction of an additional bidentate ligand (N∧P) can not only significantly improve stability, but also induces a high PLQY (≈100%) by rigidifying the structure of the complex. All the above advantages favour this kind of Cu(I) complex as an emitter for highly efficient OLEDs (Fig. 42).
 Fig. 42  Chemical structures of the TADF-active dinuclear Cu(I) complexes. 
More recently, a new three-fold bridged dinuclear Cu(I) complex 154 that exhibits sky-blue emission peaking at 488 nm in the solid state at ambient temperature has been reported by Yersin's group.215 Benefiting from the rigid molecular structure, high PLQY (≈85%) was observed for 154 in the solid state. In-depth photophysical studies explained the temperature-dependent luminescent behavior in the range of 1.3–300 K. As shown in Fig. 43a and b, below T ≈ 10 K, the steep decrease of the emission decay time with increasing temperature is a consequence of splitting of the T1 state into substates and increasing the population of triplet substate III. Significant zero-field splitting (ZFS) energy of ΔE(III–II, I) ≈ 2.5 cm−1 will lead to an additional decay component that results from the direct effect of spin-lattice relaxation (SLR). The radiative rate k(III) is calculated to be 20 times higher than for the substates I and II. Thus, two decay components are observed. When focusing on the temperature range of ∼20 ≤ T ≤ ∼80 K, steady decay with an average decay time of 55 μs can be assigned to the transitions from the three triplet substates to the ground state. In the temperature range of ∼80 ≤ T ≤ 300 K, the decay time decreases obviously from 55 to 7 μs at room temperature. The ambient-temperature emission of 154 is assigned to the combined TADF (87%) and phosphorescence (13%). The combined emission shows a shorter decay time than the pure TADF emission (8 μs) (Fig. 43c). Accordingly, dual emissive Cu(I) complexes represent attractive candidates for highly efficient OLEDs by decreasing the population time of the excitons.

The insets show energy level diagrams displaying the ZFS of the T1 state (a) and the singlet–triplet splitting (b) with state-related decay times/rates.

To obtain blue emission from a Cu(I) complex is still a big challenge. Recently, Kato's group synthesized a series of deep-blue emitting dinuclear Cu(I) complexes 155–157, using both the traditional solution method and the recently developed solvent-free thermal method.216 At room temperature, 155–157 showed bright emission in the range from 435 to 452 nm. These data represent the bluest emission in Cu(I) complex systems so far reported. The detailed TD-DFT investigations revealed all three complexes possess relatively small ΔEST in the range of 1500–1700 cm−1 (0.19–0.21 eV). The short decay times within 5 μs for all three complexes at room temperature indicated TADF in each complex. It is worth noting that the complex 155 showed the shortest decay time of 2.25 μs in TADF-active Cu(I) complexes reported so far.
Recently, a series of atypical dinuclear Cu(I) complexes 158–162 without halogenido-bridges has been synthesized by Kato and co-workers. TADF was identified as a plausible mechanism for luminescence with high PLQY of >50% at room temperature, whereas at low temperatures phosphorescence was observed.217,218 Notably, 158–160 were synthesized via a novel solvent-assisted mechanochemical method which involved grinding complex 161 with halogenated potassium in the presence of a trace amount of water. Cu4 and Cu6 cluster structures were also obtained.218
In 2016, Steffen's group reported a series of dinuclear Cu(I) NHC–picolyl complexes 163–166 with high PLQYs of >50%.219 The detailed photophysical and TD-DFT investigations indicated complexes 163–165 are TADF materials, whereas complex 166 is a phosphorescent emitter. Cuprophilic interactions between two Cu centers supplies strong SOC to ensure highly efficient T1 ↔ S1 and T1 → S0 processes, resulting in highly efficient emission, either by TADF or by fast phosphorescence.
In 2016, three tetraphosphane bridged dinuclear Cu(I) complexes 167–169, terminally chelated by a borate diimine anion, were synthesized in good yields by Lu's group.220 A small ΔEST (322–644 cm−1; 30–80 meV) observed in these complexes indicated TADF emission at ambient temperature. Slight blue-shifts in the emission were observed on cooling solid samples of 167–169 from 293 to 77 K. This observation is unusual for TADF emission which usually red-shifts on cooling. The blue shift was tentatively explained by a distortion from a tetrahedral ground-state to a more flattened excited state after MLCT excitation, leading to a larger energy gap.
In 2017, Chen et al. reported three halogenido-bridged Cu(I) complexes 170–172221 with emission colors from yellow to blue in the solid state at room temperature with low quantum yields (Φ < 0.01%). The low PLQYs for all these complexes were attributed to the unfavourable rigid environment around the copper centers.
3.1.2.2 Dinuclear Cu(I) complex based OLEDs. 
OLEDs based on Cu(I) complexes are usually fabricated by the solution spin coating of the emitter layer due to the poor thermal stability of the Cu(I) complex. The detailed device performance data of dinuclear Cu(I) complexes are summarized in Table 6.

In 2007, Tsuboyama et al. reported three halogenido-bridged Cu(I) emitters 153, 173 and 174.222 The solution-processed OLED using 173 as dopant showed a maximum EQE, PE and CE of ∼4.8%, 4.2 lm W−1 and 10.4 cd A−1, respectively. However, a possible TADF mechanism was not discussed.
In 2010, a highly emissive bis(phosphine)diarylamido dinuclear Cu(I) complex 175 was reported by Peters and co-workers.223 The high PLQY can be attributed to the less distortion in the excited state of 175 which was established by a relatively small Stokes shift and TD-DFT calculations. Temperature dependent decay times combined with time-resolved spectra indicated complex 175 is a TADF material. Vapour-deposited OLEDs based on 175 as dopant gave remarkable EL performance with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 16.1%. These data demonstrated that both singlet and triplet excitons originating from TADF can be harvested effectively in the device.
In 2013, Baumann and co-workers reported TADF-active Cu(I) complexes with N^P bridging ligands and PPh3 substituents on copper, represented by structure 176.224 Emission colors were tuned from yellow to blue by using electron-rich (e.g. imidazole, triazole) or electron-poor (e.g. pyridine, oxadiazole) heterocycles as part of the bridging ligand. 176 was tested in solution-processed OLEDs. The poor EL properties can be attributed to the nonoptimized device construction, resulting in leakage of an excess of holes/electrons or radical cations/anions at the emission layer.
To further optimize the OLED construction and obtain superior device performance, in 2015, Baumann and co-workers reported a green emissive dinuclear Cu(I) complex 177 which exhibited very high PLQY in both the solid state (≈88%) and host doped film (≈92%) at room temperature.174 A small ΔEST of 830 cm−1 (0.10 eV) and temperature-dependent decay profiles proved that the emission of complex 177 mainly originated from TADF. Solution-processed OLEDs based on 177 were fabricated. The detailed device structures are summarized in Table 6. 3TPYMB and PLEXCORE UT-314 were chosen to avoid quenching by energy transfer because of their high triplet energies. Benefiting from the efficient TADF, high EQE of 23% and CE of 73 cd A−1 were obtained for 177 devices. Moreover, the turn-on voltage was as low as 2.6 V. This is the best reported EL performance based on Cu(I) emitters and is even comparable with leading green phosphorescent OLEDs using iridium or platinum. The obvious “roll-off” phenomenon in the device (Fig. 44a) can be attributed to the loss of charge balance at high injection.

In 2016, the EL properties of three TADF-active Cu(I) complexes 178–180 with blue-green emission were studied by Liu and co-workers.225 The device structures are summarized in Table 6. The device A1 based on complex 178 achieved the best EL performance, with a maximum EQE of 10.1%, CE and PE efficiencies of 32.9 cd A−1 and 19.9 lm W−1, respectively (Fig. 45). The device 3 exhibited a low turn-on voltage (3.9 V) and relatively low efficiency roll-off compared with devices 1 and 2, suggesting that holes and electrons were confined completely in the EML.

In summary, research on TADF-active dinuclear Cu(I) complexes has become increasingly significant due to their potential applications in electroluminescent devices. Especially, the strong SOC of Cu(I) complexes ensures highly efficient emission with short decay time, either by TADF or fast phosphorescence comparable with all-organic TADF molecules. Superior EL performance based on a dinuclear Cu(I) complex dopant has been realized with high EQE up to 23%. However, studies of OLEDs of Cu(I) complexes that usually show pure TADF or dual emission with short decay times are still at an initial stage. Further development of highly efficient blue and red emissive dinuclear Cu(I) complex and optimisation of device structures to achieve high EL performance are highly desired.

3.2 Electrochemical luminescence (ECL)
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL, also known as electrogenerated chemiluminescence) is a process whereby species generated at an electrode interface undergo electrochemical reactions to form an electronically excited state that emits light upon relaxation to a lower-level state. Specifically, as one of the most important bioanalytical detection methods, ECL has been widely used in clinical diagnostics and environmental assays due to its extremely low detection limit, high sensitivity and fast rate of sample analysis.226 Generally, ECL can be produced through two dominant pathways, namely the annihilation and co-reactant pathways.227 The most ubiquitous and famous ECL luminophore is the mononuclear species, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) (Fig. 46) first reported in 1972 by Tokel and Bard.228 Since then, many attempts have been made to decorate the ligands of Ru complexes so as to improve the ECL efficiency and sensitivity.17 Alongside the well-studied mononuclear complexes, dinuclear or multinuclear Ru(II) complexes are considered to be a promising approach to enhance ECL properties because of their multiple redox centers.229–231 Furthermore, ECL color switching can be tuned by application of a range of potentials in a binuclear heterometallic complex.84 In this section, some representative ECL chromophores based on dinuclear or multinuclear Ru(II) complexes connected with different kinds of bridging ligands, such as benzene ring, alkyl chain, symmetrical aryl-diamide or oligothiophene rigid bridge, amino acid lysine (Lys), etc. will be discussed in detail.
 Fig. 46  Chemical structures of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes. 
In 1998, the ECL properties of dinuclear Ru(II) complex 181 with a 1,4-bis(4′-methyl-2,2′-bipyridin-4-yl)benzene (bphb) bridging ligand in acetonitrile (MeCN), 50:50 (v/v) MeCN/H2O, and aqueous solutions were studied by Bard and co-workers.232 As a reference, the corresponding mononuclear Ru(II) complex was also studied. The cyclic voltammetry traces of 181 in MeCN/0.1 M Bu4NPF6 are shown in Fig. 47. The two, one-electron, reduction processes at −1.051 V and −1.203 V can be assigned to stepwise one-electron reduction processes on the bridging ligand, as shown in equations (2) and (3). [(bpy)2Ru(bphb)Ru(bpy)2]4+ + e− → [(bpy)2Ru(bphb−)Ru(bpy)2]3+(2) [(bpy)2Ru(bphb−)Ru(bpy)2]3+ + e− → [(bpy)2Ru(bphb2−)Ru(bpy)2]2+(3)

Furthermore, a two-electron reduction process observed at −1.575 V (not shown in Fig. 47a) was proposed to occur at the bpy ligands. For the oxidation process, a two-electron oxidation wave at +1.573 V can be assigned to the two Ru(II→III) centers, and is consistent with negligible electronic coupling between the two Ru centers.
For the corresponding mononuclear complex (bpy)2Ru(bphb)2+, as shown in Fig. 47c, three one-electron oxidation waves can be assigned to the first reduction on the bphb ligand (eqn (4)) followed by sequential bpy-based reductions (eqn (5) and (6)). An oxidation process was assigned to Ru(II→III). [(bpy)2Ru(bphb)]2+ + e− → [(bpy)2Ru(bphb−)]1+(4) [(bpy)2Ru(bphb−)]1+ + e− → [(bpy−)(bpy)Ru(bphb−)]0(5) [(bpy−)(bpy)Ru(bphb−)]0 + e− → [(bpy−)2Ru(bphb−)]1−(6)
Intense orange ECL was observed for both 181 and its mononuclear analogue with λmax at 624 nm at the working electrode surface in MeCN solution. This emission is identical to that obtained upon photoexcitation, indicating that the ECL for both complexes can be attributed to the 3MLCT state formed by the redox process. The ECL efficiency of 181 is as high as 0.16, which is comparable to its photoluminescent efficiency (0.158), revealing that the overall yield of excited states formed during the annihilation reaction is close to unity. Importantly, 181 exhibited much higher ECL efficiency than its mononuclear analogue (0.0006), and three times higher than the classic Ru(bpy)32+ (0.05). Furthermore, the ECL properties for both 181 and Ru(bpy)32+ through coreactant pathways in 50:50 (v/v) MeCN/H2O and aqueous solution were investigated. The relative integrated ECL intensities of 181 with coreactant tripropylamine (TPrA) are 2.5–3 and 2 times that of the Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA system in partially aqueous solution and purely aqueous solution, respectively. This work demonstrated that adding another metal center to form a dimetallic system is a promising way to improve the ECL efficiency in the both annihilation and coreactant pathways.
In 2006, ECL properties for two dinuclear Ru(II) complexes 182 and 183, bearing an asymmetrical or a symmetrical tetrazole-based bridging ligand were studied by Bard and co-workers.233 Electrochemical results showed two, one-electron, oxidation processes for asymmetrical 182 which were assigned to the two nonequivalent Ru centers mediated by the electronically asymmetric bridging ligand. In contrast, the single, two-electron, oxidation process for 183 was assigned to the two Ru(II→III) centers. UV-vis-NIR spectroelectrochemistry for both complexes exhibited an obvious intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) band, indicating metal–metal electron coupling existed in the both complexes. The magnitude of the coupling energies for 182 and 183 are 500 and 313 cm−1, respectively, according to the Hush model.234 The ECL efficiencies of 182 and 183 are 150% and 40% relative to Ru(bpy)32+, respectively, in 1 mM MeCN solutions and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as supporting electrolyte.
In 2011, Wei et al. reported a new dinuclear Ru(II) complex 184 connected by a pyrazolyl-pyridyl-based bridging ligand.235 The corresponding mononuclear analogue was studied as a reference. Both the mono- and dinuclear complexes exhibited intense orange emission (λmax 603–608 nm) with lifetimes in the microsecond range in the solid state, revealing that the emission for both complexes can be attributed to the 3MLCT state. Similar redox behaviour was observed for both complexes with one, two-electron, Ru(II→III) oxidation process and two, one-electron, reduction processes of the bipy ligands. The ECL efficiency of 184 is higher than its corresponding mononuclear complex, but both are lower than that of Ru(bpy)32+ reference under identical experimental conditions. It is worth noting that the ECL intensity of 184 decreased significantly in the presence of diuretic furosemide, which provided a novel ECL method for the determination of diuretic furosemide with a low detection limit of 1.2 × 10−8 mol L−1.
In 2003, De Cola et al. reported an electroluminescent device with a doped emissive layer composed of a semiconducting poly(phenylenevinylene) (PPV) derivative and the dinuclear Ru(II) complex 185.236 The chemical structures are shown in Fig. 46. This device showed reversible color switching between red and green emission under forward and reverse biases, respectively (Fig. 48). Upon application of a low positive voltage (<5 V), red emission originating from the excited state of 185 was observed due to the electroluminescent reaction between the oxidized and the reduced ruthenium complexes. [Ru(ph)4Ru]2+ + [Ru(ph)4Ru]6+ → *[Ru(ph)4Ru]4+ + [Ru(ph)4Ru]4+(7)

Interestingly, under reverse bias (−4 V), green emission originating from PPV was observed, and the proposed mechanism of light generation is presented in Fig. 49. At the ITO electrode, reduction of the ruthenium component is not centered on the metal units, but on the polyphenylene bridging ligand. The bipolaronic reduced species that is formed is stabilized by the presence of the polyphenylene units and the Ru2+ cation in its proximity. Then, either the oxidized PPV accepts an electron from the reduced species to produce the excited state of the PPV, or PPV− is formed by a stepwise electron transfer from the ruthenium component. With either mechanism, green light can be generated at reverse bias. It is worth noting that the reversible color switching was not observed in dinuclear ruthenium complex 186 under the same conditions. These results establish that the reversible color switching in electroluminescence is determined by the choice of bridging ligand.

In 2009, the ECL properties of a series of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes 187–189 bridged by alkyl chains of different length (n = 3, 5, 8) were studied by Peng's group.229 The study was carried out in 0.1 M phosphate buffer with co-reactant TPrA or 2-(dibutylamino)ethanol (DBAE) at different working electrodes. The important findings are: (1) the ECL intensity increased with the increasing length of alkyl chain in the complex. Especially, in the presence of 5 mM TPrA or DBAE, complex 189 (n = 8) exhibited remarkable ECL enhancement (∼25 times) at a Pt electrode when compared with Ru(bpy)32+. (2) The log of ECL intensity exhibited a linear increase with increasing log of the concentration of 189 at a glassy carbon electrode with coreactant TPrA. The detection limit is as low as 0.1 fM, which is a remarkable increase in sensitivity compared to Ru(bpy)32+ (200 fM). Furthermore, the TPrA needed with 189 is only 20% of that in the [Ru(bpy)3]2+/TPrA system.
In 2015, Sun et al. reported three heterodinuclear Ir/Ru complexes linked by long alkyl chains (n = 10, 12, 14).84 Interestingly, their electrochemiluminescence color can be tuned by scanning over a potential range from 0.55 to 1.6 V. As shown in Fig. 50a, for complex 191 a weak emission centered at 543 nm can be observed with an applied potential at 0.55 V. When the potential was increased to 0.95 V, a new emission peak centered at 618 nm appeared and the corresponding ECL intensity increased gradually, resulting in a linear response of the ECL intensity ratio (I618nm/I543nm) within the scanning potential range from 0.55 to 0.95 V (Fig. 50b). When the applied potential was further increased from 1.0 to 1.25 V, the I618nm from the ruthenium moiety increased sharply, while the I543nm from the iridium moiety was almost unchanged. Furthermore, the effective overlap between the peaks of the iridium and ruthenium moieties indicated that efficient resonance energy transfer occurs from the iridium to the ruthenium. Consequently in 191 the ECL intensity from ruthenium is higher than that of iridium. Upon further increasing the potential from 1.25 to 1.6 V, the ECL intensity from the ruthenium moiety decreased sharply, and exhibited a linear relationship (Fig. 50d) between the ECL intensity and the scanning potential. Finally, this work developed a general methodology to control ECL color changes and on–off switching. This has potential bioanalytical applications by a ratiometric ECL detection method.

In 2009, Kim et al. reported a series of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes 193–204 with ester-bridged bis(bipyridine) ligands.237 Their photophysical and ECL properties were studied, and the key findings are: (1) the maximum emission wavelength of symmetrical dinuclear complexes 199–204 with symmetrical BL3 and BL4 ligands is in the range of 623–628 nm, while the complexes 193–198 with asymmetrical BL1 and BL2 ligands showed blue-shifted emission (586–598 nm). (2) The ECL intensity of asymmetrical complexes 195–198 showed a remarkable enhancement compared to the others. All the results indicated that the photophysical and ECL properties of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes can be tuned by the bridging ligands.
In 2013, Kim et al. designed two new bridging ligands, namely non-conjugated BL5 and conjugated BL6, coordinated with two ruthenium centers to form complexes 205–210.238 The ECL intensity for 208–210 bearing a conjugated bridging ligand was much higher than that of 205–207 containing a non-conjugated bridging ligand. It is worth noting that, similar to the previous work in 2009,237 the complexes with a L3 ligand showed higher ECL intensity than that of complexes with L1 or L2 ligands.
In 2006, Sun et al. reported three dinuclear Ru(II) complexes 211–213 with symmetrical aryl-diamide bridging ligands.239 ECL studies established that 211–213 showed emission with the peak at λmax 570 nm, and with relative intensity much higher than the classical reference Ru(bpy)32+. Especially, 213 showed the brightest emission with 11.5 times enhancement compared to Ru(bpy)32+. The high efficiency of ECL was attributed to the combination of amide bonds and the central aromatic unit.
In 2008, Sun et al. reported two dinuclear Ru(II) complexes 214 and 215 bearing conjugated thienylenevinylene bridging ligands.240 The ECL studies indicated that the ECL intensity of both complexes was lower than that of the reference Ru(bpy)32+. The intensity decreased with the increasing number of thienylenevinylene units.
In 2003, a series of multinuclear Ru(II) complexes bridged by the amino acid lysine (Lys) ligand was reported by De Cola's group.241 The ECL intensity of 216 and the corresponding trinuclear complex increased 30% with respect to the mononuclear reference complex. Heterogeneous ECL immunoassay studies indicated that the ECL signal can be proportionally enhanced upon increasing the number of ruthenium units bound to the dendritic structure that labels a biological molecule (e.g. antigen, antibody).
In summary, the key findings are: (1) dinuclear Ru(II) complexes bearing asymmetrical bridging ligands usually show higher ECL intensity than symmetrical analogues. (2) Most dinuclear examples exhibited enhancement of ECL intensity compared to the corresponding mononuclear Ru(II) complexes and reference Ru(bpy)32+. However, several challenges still remain for this system when used as ECL labels: (1) the poor water-solubility of most complexes of this type limits their use in bioanalytical detection. (2) Most examples suffer from the quenching of emission by dioxygen and by interactions with the environment. Recently, De Cola's group reported a water-soluble Pt complex, which showed highly efficient ECL efficiency in aqueous solution (72%) and procell (51%), respectively.242 Aggregation-induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) of a Pt complex through the self-assembly process was considered as a reasonable strategy for higher ECL efficiency.242 Therefore, this finding may promote highly efficient AIE-active dinuclear metal complexes for use as labels in future bioanalytical detection.
4. Photocatalysis
4.1 Photocatalytic water splitting
The development of renewable green energy sources is one of the most important challenges currently facing society. In this regard solar energy is widely considered to be highly promising for future economic and environmental development.243 Water splitting with sunlight to produce H2 and O2 (eqn (10)) is of considerable importance as one way to solve energy shortfalls.244 Photocatalytic water-splitting is a highly endothermic four-electron process, which can be divided into two half-reactions: water oxidation and reduction to produce O2 (eqn (11)) and H2 (eqn (12)).245 2H2O → 2H2 + O2 ΔE0 = 1.23 V(10) 2H2O → 4H+ + 4e− + O2 E0 = +1.23 V vs. NHE, pH 0(11) 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2 E0 = 0 V vs. NHE, pH 0(12)
At present, the photocatalytic performance of H2 or O2 generation is mainly evaluated by the turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values. A higher TON reflects a better durability of the photocatalytic system. A higher TOF value reflects a more active catalyst. In recent years, center metal-free organic dyes and metal complex chromophores as photosensitizers (PSs) have been widely studied in the application of photocatalytic water splitting. However, both metal-free organic dyes and mononuclear metal complex chromophores typically suffer from short operational lifetime due to photodecomposition of the PSs.44 Therefore, the development of novel supramolecular photocatalysts, comprising only one bi- or multi-metallic complex connected by the different metal components, that function as both a light absorber and catalytic center, has been a popular subject in the field of photocatalytic water splitting. In this section, some representative bi- or multi-metallic photocatalysts and their photocatalytic performance will be discussed.

4.1.1 H2 generation. 
Hydrogen produced from photocatalytic water splitting is a desirable process to replace fossil fuels in society.246 The general requirements for the design and construction of efficient metal complex chromophores for solar H2 generation are as follows. (i) Metal complex chromophores should exhibit a high molar extinction coefficient (ε) with a very broad absorption range, especially in the visible light region. (ii) Suitable redox potentials of chromophores are needed for the efficient electron transfer from the sacrificial reductant to the catalyst. (iii) Metal complex chromophores should exhibit an excited state lifetime in the millisecond regime to ensure the charge transfer reaction. (iv) The photostability of the metal complex chromophores should be sufficiently high to guarantee long-term operation in the solar H2 generation.44 In consideration of the above requirements, Ru(II) complexes show particular advantages in solar H2 generation in comparison with alternatives such as Ir(III), Pt(II), Cu(I), Co(II) complex chromophores.
The key components of photocatalytic H2-generating systems are shown in Fig. 51. In contrast to the typical two-component systems (Fig. 51a) for H2 production which consist of a sacrificial reductant (SR), a PS (e.g. metal-free organic dyes or mononuclear metal complex chromophore), and a water reduction catalyst (WRC), a dinuclear or multinuclear supramolecular photocatalyst which acts as both light absorber and catalytic center is an alternative system (Fig. 51b) due to its good photostability. Furthermore, electron or energy transfer between the photoactivated center and the catalytic center can be easily controlled by decorating the peripheral ligands or the bridging ligands, to give hydrogen in high yields.44

4.1.1.1 Ru–M supramolecular photocatalysts. 
Most investigations of supramolecular photocatalysts are based on a Ru–M system: some representative Ru–Pt/Pd/Rh/Co photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 52. In 2006, Sakai's group first studied a supramolecular photocatalyst for H2 production using the Ru–Pt dinuclear complex 217.247 Upon irradiation with visible-light after 10 h in the presence of EDTA as the sacrificial reductant, a relatively low TON of 4.8 was observed. No hydrogen was formed in the multi-component system consisting of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and K2PtCl4. Furthermore, no colloidal platinum dispersion formed, based on in situ dynamic light scattering measurements during the H2 production reactions. These data suggest that the Ru–Pt photocatalyst acting as both photosensitizer (Ru component) and the catalyst (Pt component) is essential for the observed photocatalytic H2 production. Subsequently, it was shown that three new Ru–Pt complexes 218–220248 do not behave as photocatalysts for H2 production, indicating that good intramolecular electron transfer from the 3MLCT excited state of the Ru component to the Pt component maybe a crucial factor for the formation of H2 from the reduction of water.
 Fig. 52  The chemical structures of bi- and multi-metallic Ru-metal photocatalysts for H2 production. 
Recently, Huijser and co-workers focused on the effect of peripheral ligands on the photocatalysts. A series of Ru–Pt or Ru–Pd di- or multi-nuclear complexes 221–226 (Fig. 52),249 and their photocatalytic performance are summarized in Table 7. The key findings are: (1) introduction of carboxyethyl ester units on the peripheral ligands of the light-harvesting Ru center leads to a huge increase of both the TON and TOF values. A TOF value of 200 h−1 obtained in this work is the highest reported for a supramolecular photocatalytic system. (2) No obvious change in the photocatalytic performance was observed when the Pt center was replaced by Pd.

More recently, the dinuclear photocatalyst 227 with more bulky ligands was reported by Pryce's group.250 The relatively higher TOFs of 227 when compared with 221 bearing dipyridyl ligands can be attributed to an extended excited state lifetime of 227 Furthermore, the modest photocatalytic performance may be due to the absence of an excited state equilibrium of the complex which is supported by transient absorption (TA) and excited state absorption (ESA) data.
Recently, a series of Ru–Pd/Pt/Ru complexes 228–232 was reported by Rau and co-workers. Among these complexes, only 228,251229252 and 230253 exhibited modest photocatalytic performance, whereas 231 and 232254 exhibited very poor performance. The relatively high catalytic efficiency of 228 using a Pt component as the catalytic center with a TON value of 7 was explained by its superior photostability. However, the higher TON value observed from 229 using a Pd component as the catalytic center was attributed to the formation of Pd colloids under the catalytic conditions. This alternative mechanism of H2 production was also proposed by Johansson's group.255 Upon illumination, Pd is released from the complex 233 as evidenced by XPS and TEM measurements, and the appearance of Pd0/colloids strongly correlates with the formation of H2.
In 2007, the first multi-nuclear Ru–Rh photocatalyst 234 for H2 production was reported by Brewer's group.256 The Rh(III) species 234 does not directly produce H2. However, upon LED lamp irradiation, the newly formed Rh(I) species [{(bpy)2Ru(dpp)}2Rh]5+ (dpp = 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine) is the key intermediate for H2 production, this active species is obtained through photoinitiated electron collection by [{(bpy)2Ru(dpp)}2RhCl2]5+ in the presence of dimethylaniline (DMA) as the electron donor. Furthermore, the excellent stability of the Ru–Rh photocatalyst in this system was proved by the good linear relationship between the volume of H2 production and irradiation time. To further improve the photocatalytic performance, the new Ru–Rh photocatalysts 235 and 236 were synthesized with the peripheral bipy ligands of 234 replaced by the more sterically bulky Ph2phen ligands.257235 and 236 exhibited TON values of 150 and 610, respectively, significantly outperforming related Ru–Rh–Ru photocatalysts such as 234 (TON 30) and single-component systems.
More recently, two new photocatalysts 237 and 238 have been studied by Brewer and co-workers.258 Heptametallic 238 exhibited better photocatalytic performance with a TON value of 300 when compared with tetrametallic 237 that has a TON value of 40. This difference in photocatalytic activity was attributed to the differences in the electrochemical and photophysical properties. The LUMO of 237 is mainly localized on the bridging ligand. However, for 238, the LUMO is predominantly on the Rh center. The transient absorption experiments suggested that heptametallic 238 undergoes excited state electron transfer, whereas this transfer does not happen in tetrametallic 237. The facile reduction of the Rh center in the excited state of 238 is clearly advantageous for the photocatalytic ability.
In 2008, the first Ru–Co photocatalysts 239–242 were reported by Artero et al.259241 exhibited the best performance with a TON value of 104 in the presence of TEA as the sacrificial reductant and [Et3NH][BF4] as the proton source. The data are comparable with previously reported TON values using Ru–Pt or Ru–Pd species.
In 2009, two new Ru–Co photocatalysts 243 and 244, bearing a conjugated and non-conjugated bridging ligand, respectively, were reported by Sun's group.260 The better photocatalytic performance of 244 with a TON value of 48 was attributed to the restricted back electron-transfer reaction that was controlled by the non-conjugating methylene group in the bridging ligand.
4.1.1.2 Other supramolecular photocatalysts. 
In 2010, self-assembled Ir–Co species 245–248 (Fig. 53) for H2 production in the presence of TEOA as the sacrificial reductant in CH3CN:H2O (1:1) were first studied by Otsuki and co-workers.261 In particular, complex 246 exhibited higher photocatalytic performance (TON = 20) when compared with the corresponding multi-component counterpart with the identical component concentrations. This work initiated a new way for the photocatalytic H2 production by using a self-assembled supramolecular photocatalyst.
 Fig. 53  The chemical structures of bi- or multi-metallic photocatalysts for H2 production. 
In 2012, photocatalytic H2 production using the new Ir–Pt and Ir–Pd photocatalysts 249 and 250 (Fig. 53) in the presence of TEA as the sacrificial reductant were studied by Vos's group.262 Under 350 nm light irradiation, the relatively low TONs of 65 and 16 were obtained for 249 and 250, respectively. In comparison, higher TONs of 308 and 254 were observed with irradiation at 470 nm. Furthermore, the relatively low photocatalytic efficiency of the Pd catalytic center in comparison with the Pt analogue was attributed to unwanted electronic transitions from the Pd center to the bridging ligand in the 350 nm region, which inhibits the formation of H2.
In 2015, Yu et al. reported that the Ir–Pt complex 251 (Fig. 53) is a highly efficient photocatalyst for H2 production with a high TON of 1672 after 60 h of visible-light irradiation.79 The good linear relationship between H2 generation and irradiation time indicated excellent photostability of 251. However, the catalytic mechanism for this process was unclear.
In 2009, the Os–Rh photocatalysts 252 and 253 (Fig. 53) bearing a light harvesting Os center and a catalytic Rh center were studied by Nishibayashi's group.263 Both 252 and 253 exhibited high activity and stability during photocatalytic H2 production. In particular, upon visible-light irradiation in a 1:1 CH3CN–H2O solution for 240 h, 252 exhibited a high TON of 594.
Noble-metal-free complexes have been studied by Song's group (254)264 and Sun's group (255 and 256),265 respectively (Fig. 53). All of these complexes exhibited poor ability for photocatalytic H2 production. However, the development of cheap photocatalysts using earth-abundant metals is a promising topic for future studies.
In summary, research on supramolecular photocatalysts for H2 production is still at a fundamental stage, and the complicated photocatalytic mechanism is not fully clear. However, it is clear that H2 production performance is influenced by several factors, such as redox potential, excited-state lifetime of the light absorber, molar absorptivity and luminescence properties. Further investigations of supramolecular structure–performance relationships are needed. New noble-metal-free photocatalysts for efficient H2 production is a promising topic of research.


4.1.2 O2 generation. 
Water splitting to produce O2 is a challenge due to the high thermodynamic and kinetic demands of the process (eqn (11)). Many studies have addressed the development of efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) to conquer this bottleneck, mainly including metal oxides266,267 and transition metal complexes.268,269 Over the past three decades, a series of Ru complexes has been successfully exploited as WOCs for O2 production.270–278 since the pioneering example reported by Meyer et al. in 1982.279 It is extremely important that the ligands used to bind the metal center are kinetically robust with regard to oxidation, otherwise the ligand will degrade.271 Generally, a robust water oxidation catalyst can be generated by self-assembly from two mononuclear complexes to yield a dinuclear species during the catalytic process, or by directly design and synthesis of a dinuclear species.269,276 Over the past few years, a few successful examples of di- and multi-nuclear Ru catalysts for photocatalytic O2 production have been reported. Two different photocatalytic strategies are presented: (1) two-component systems, including a supramolecular photocatalyst (acting as both photosensitizer and catalyst) and a sacrificial electron acceptor (SEA). (2) Three-component systems, including a PS, a molecular catalyst and a sacrificial electron acceptor. The catalytic mechanism can be attributed to the intra- or intermolecular O–O bond formation that can occur via the so-called water nucleophilic attack (WNA) or interaction of two M–O units (I2M) mechanism271,280,281 (Fig. 54).
 Fig. 54  The chemical structures of photocatalysts for O2 production. 
4.1.2.1 Two-component systems. 
In 2012, two trinuclear Ru supramolecular photocatalysts 257 and 258 with two light-harvesting sites and one catalytic site for water oxidation in the presence of Na2S2O8 as SEA were studied by Sun's group.282 Complex 257 displayed enhanced photocatalytic activity (TON = 38, TOF = 4.71 min−1) after 70 min compared with a conventional multicomponent system (TON = 8) consisting of [Ru-(bpy)3]2+ as photosensitizer and [RuL(pic)2] as catalyst. The superior activity for 257 was attributed to the expected intramolecular electron transfer between the [Ru(bpy)3]3+ units and the catalytic center that are generated through the oxidative quenching of the excited state [Ru(bpy)3]2+* by S2O82−. In contrast to 257, no O2 generation was detected in the system containing 258, and the O2 formation was observed only upon addition of [Ru(bpy)3]2+. This difference indicated poor electron transfer between the photosensitizer unit [Ru(tpy)2]2+ and the SEA, since the lifetime of the [Ru(tpy)2]2+ excited state is significantly shorter compared to that of [Ru(bpy)3]2+.
In 2014, three new supramolecular photocatalysts 259–261 based on dinuclear Ru complexes connected by different linkages were reported by Sun's group.283 The photocatalytic water oxidation performance of 259–261 follows the order 261 > 260 > 259 (Table 8). The enhanced photocatalytic ability of 261 with a flexible linkage was explained by the beneficial electron transfer and charge separation induced by adjusting the distance between the catalytic unit and the PS unit. Furthermore, an electrochemical study indicated that the higher oxidation potential of the PS unit (ca. 1.3 V vs. NHE) than the onset potential of the water oxidation catalytic unit (ca. 0.95 V vs. NHE) could provide a driving force for the water oxidation.

In 2012, Thummel's group reported a new supramolecular photocatalyst 262 for water oxidation.284262 exhibited effective catalytic ability with a TON of 134 after irradiation for 6 h, and 22 times higher than its mononuclear analogous (TON = 6) in the presence of photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)3]2+. Interestingly, in the absence of light, a small amount of O2 was also formed in the presence of 262 and the strong oxidant Na2S2O8. However, an explanation for this was not presented.
4.1.2.2 Three-component systems. 
In 2015, Llobet's group reported two new molecular catalysts 263 and 264 for water oxidation in the presence of a photosensitizer and a SEA.80263 exhibited very high TONs and TOFs of 5300 and 11.1 s−1, respectively, after three successive catalytic runs. This result represents a new benchmark for homogeneous light-driven water oxidation. Based upon detailed electrochemical and photophysical investigations, an integrated photocatalytic mechanism in this three-component system was proposed (Fig. 55).

In 2015, Laine et al. investigated a new dinuclear catalyst 265.285 at pH = 7.2 and 6.2. The results indicated that 265 exhibited better catalytic ability at pH = 6.2 with a TON of 890 than at pH = 7.2 (TON = 500). This can be attributed to the photosensitizer decomposition at higher pH. The high catalytic ability of 265 was ascribed to the negatively charged ligands that stabilize the metal centers in high-valent redox states.
Sun's group had stated that 266 is a highly efficient catalyst for water oxidation with CeIV as an oxidant in their previous work.286 More recently, light-driven water oxidation in a three-component system including a PS, 266 and a SEA was explored.287 Interestingly, the catalytic ability of 266 obviously enhanced with an increase of CH3CN content in the buffer solution from 20% (TON = 57) to 60% (TON = 215). Furthermore, the corresponding photocatalytic rate increased from 0.07 to 0.33 s−1. This result indicated that CH3CN not only promoted the O2 production, but also accelerated the photocatalytic rate. Finally, in optimised conditions, 266 exhibited highly efficient O2 production with a TON of 638.
In summary, a series of multinuclear Ru(II) complexes as supramolecular photocatalysts or molecular catalysts have been studied for O2 production. At present the three-component systems show consistently enhanced photocatalytic ability over the two-component systems. However, further design of new supramolecular photocatalysts for the highly efficient production of O2 is desired due to the better durability of photocatalysis when compared with combined PS and molecular catalyst systems.

4.2 CO2 reduction
Reduction of CO2 into energy-rich compounds is an important topic that can simultaneously tackle the shortage of fossil-fuel resources and global warming.36,40,42,288 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction utilizing solar light as an energy source has been widely investigated as a key technology for the conversion of abundant solar energy to chemical energy, so-called artificial photosynthesis. Rhenium polypyridine complexes are known to act as photocatalysts and electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 to CO.289 A major problem with these photocatalysts is the lack of an extended absorption into the visible region. The present approach is to fabricate supramolecular photocatalysts, similar to the photocatalytic H2 or O2 production systems. Supramolecular photocatalysts used in the reduction of CO2 act as both the light absorbing center and the catalytic center. Two distinct reaction mechanisms that use supramolecular photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2, are oxidative quenching (OQ) and reductive quenching (RQ).290 As shown in Fig. 56, for both mechanisms, the reduction of CO2 proceeds via the reduced form of the catalyst. Since the first supramolecular Ru–Ni complex used for the photochemical reduction of CO2 was reported by Kimura et al. in 1992,291 huge efforts had been devoted to the design of new bi- or multi-metallic analogues. Ishitani's group have recently described the development of supramolecular photocatalysts for the photochemical reduction of CO2,290 including Ru(II)–Re(I), Ru(II)–Ru(II), Ru(II)–Ni(II), Ru(II)–Co(III), Ir(III)–Re(I), Os(II)–Re(I), Pd(II)–Re(I), Zn(II)–Re(I), Fe(III)–Re(I), Co(II)–Re(I) and Cu(II)–Re(I) systems. Their chemical structures and photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance are presented in Fig. 57, 58 and Tables 9, 10. Therefore, in this section, we will mainly focus on the latest development of novel asymmetrical trinuclear supramolecular photocatalysts and their performance to supplement the recent review.290

Recently, Ishitani's group synthesized two trinuclear supramolecular photocatalysts 319 and 320 (Fig. 59) containing three different metal centers Os(II)–Re(I)–Ru(II) for the first time316via stepwise Mizoroki–Heck reactions. The energy transfer processes in these complexes were studied in detail. The key findings are: (1) highly efficient intramolecular energy transfer from an excited Re unit to an excited Ru unit was observed for both complexes, and the emission occurs mainly from excited Ru and Os units. (2) The faster energy transfer rate observed from the Re to the Ru unit, compared with from the Ru or Re to the Os unit, can be attributed to the different energy transfer mechanisms. For example, Furue et al. had reported that the intramolecular excited energy transfer in a Ru–Os dinuclear complex proceeds by a Förster mechanism,317 whereas the excited Re→Ru energy transfer proceeds via a Dexter mechanism.318 (3) In contrast to 319, the intramolecular excited Ru→Os energy transfer in 320 proceeded very slowly or did not occur, which can be attributed to the longer distance between the Ru and Os units in 320. Referring to supramolecular photocatalysts,290 dinuclear Ru–Re or Os–Re systems exhibit the best photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance reported to date for bimetallic systems. Inspired by this, two trinuclear complexes 319 and 320 were compared with their dinuclear Ru–Re and Os–Re analogues. As shown in Fig. 60a, both 319 and 320 can be used as supramolecular photocatalysts for the highly selective formation of CO. Importantly, both 319 and 320 exhibited superior catalytic ability and great durability in the CO2 reduction process. The TONs for 319 and 320 reached 3552 ± 461 and 4347 ± 421, respectively, after 35 h irradiation, which are higher than the summation of their parent dinuclear Ru–Re and Os–Re complexes. These two trinuclear complexes exhibit the highest TONCO for all reported photocatalytic reactions. The reason for this outstanding performance has been investigated by UV absorption measurements. As shown in Fig. 60b, upon irradiation at λ > 500 nm for 1 h, the spectrum of 319 showed a slight decrease in the band at ca. 420 to 500 nm. The spectral shape was maintained for 6 h. On the contrary, in the case of the Ru–Re analogue, the absorption band at 460 nm sharply decreased in intensity with continuous irradiation (Fig. 60c), which mainly reflects the decomposition of the Ru unit. The corresponding time courses of the absorbance changes at 460 nm for 319 and for dinuclear Ru–Re are shown in Fig. 60d. The change in the absorption intensity matched well with the time courses of photocatalytic CO formation for both catalysts (Fig. 60a). Therefore, this result indicated that the photocatalytic stability can be effectively improved by the introduction of the Os unit into the Ru–Re system.

In summary, introduction of an additional photosensitising Os unit into Ru–Re systems to give trinuclear complexes 319 and 320 has two main advantages in comparison with the parent dinuclear complexes: (1) a wider range of visible light up to 730 nm can be strongly captured by the trinuclear complexes. (2) Photocatalytic durability of 319 and 320 is improved by 27% and 55%, respectively, compared with their parent dinuclear complexes.
4.3 Dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical/photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPECs)
Photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) assembled with an n-type semiconductor TiO2 single-crystal electrode for the photoassisted (under UV irradiation) electrochemical water oxidation were first reported by Honda and Fujishima in the 1970s.319 Since then, inorganic semiconductor materials have been widely studied as photoanodes for water splitting.320,321 However, this kind of photoanode still suffers from a lack of broad wavelength light absorption due to its wide band-gap. For example, only 5% of the solar energy (predominantly UV light) can be absorbed by TiO2 photoanodes, which leads to a very low energy transfer efficiency.321 Additional challenges arise from rapid electron–hole recombination which reduces efficiencies.46 Inspired by dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),322 the development of dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical/photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPECs) is a promising strategy for water-splitting and carbon dioxide reduction.83,323–326 As shown in Fig. 61a, solar-driven water oxidation occurs at the photoanode, and proton or water reduction occurs at the cathode. The photoanode usually comprises nanocrystalline films of TiO2 derivatized by adsorption of a chromophore that is capable of absorbing solar energy, and a catalyst for water oxidation, or chromophore–catalyst supramolecular photocatalysts.323Fig. 61b shows photocathodes in tandem cells for CO2 reduction. The two electrode compartments are separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM) which allows for proton diffusion and charge balance.323 The working mechanism of a DSPEC can be summarized as follows: (1) light absorption to produce an excited state of the chromophore; (2) electron or hole injection into electrodes; (3) electron transport to a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrode for ohmic delivery to a cathode or photocathode; (4) catalyst activation, catalytic water oxidation or water/CO2 reduction.

The first DSPEC reported by Meyer's group in 1999 was used for dehydrogenation of iso-propanol to acetone.327 In 2009, Mallouk and co-workers first reported a DSPEC with nanoparticles of IrO2 as the water oxidation catalyst for water splitting.328 In 2016, Ishitani's group developed a DSPEC for CO2 reduction using a photocathode comprising a Ru(II)–Re(I) supramolecular photocatalyst and a NiO electrode.83 Although DSPECs are far less developed than semiconductor-based PECs, significant progress has been achieved in recent years. In this section, some representative DSPECs based on di- or multi-nuclear supramolecular photocatalysts for water-splitting and carbon dioxide reduction will be discussed.

4.3.1 DSPECs for water-splitting. 
How to assemble chromophores and catalysts onto a semiconductor surface is a prime consideration in the construction of a DSPEC. Multiple strategies have been explored, including co-deposition,329 “layer-by-layer” deposition assemblies with Zr(IV)-phosphate bridges,330 electroassembly by reductive vinyl coupling,331 and adsorbing pre-synthesized covalently-linked chromophore–catalyst systems by a simple solution-soaking procedure.332 For the selection of supramolecular photocatalysts, inspired by DSSCs, carboxylic acid (–COOH) derivatives have been initially studied to bind onto metal oxide films in DSPECs. However, carboxylates typically hydrolyze and desorb from the surface in water, especially at high pHs. The most widely reported supramolecular photocatalysts are phosphonic acid derivatives (–PO3H2) which bind with higher stability than carboxylates in aqueous solution,323 as shown in Fig. 62. In this section, some representative supramolecular photocatalysts as photoanodes for water splitting will be discussed in detail.

Meyer's previous work had demonstrated electrocatalytic water oxidation by a surface-bound mononuclear Ru(II) complex on ITO.333 The mechanism is a stepwise process: (1) proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) activation to RuIVO2+, (2) further oxidation to RuVO3+, (3) O-atom attack on water to give an intermediate peroxide, and (4) finally further oxidation to release O2. In 2011, possible photoinduced generation of catalytically active species (RuIV and RuV) at the remote Rub site in a supramolecular photocatalyst 321 in a DSPEC was studied.334321 was adsorbed on TiO2 in methanol solution through a soaking procedure. The maximum coverage of 321 on the TiO2 interface was ∼7.2 × 10−8 mol cm−2 in a film of ∼6 μm thickness. The electrochemical properties of the TiO2 surface-attached 321 are shown in Fig. 63. Stepwise oxidation from ITO–RuIIa–RuIIb–OH22+ to ITO–RuIIa–RuIIIb–OH23+ (E1/2 = 0.82 V), to ITO–RuIIa–RuIVbO2+ (E1/2 = 1.26 V), and to ITO–RuIIIa–RuIVbO3+ (E1/2 = 1.65 V) was observed. Transient absorption spectra provided evidence for the generation of TiO2 (e−) with a long-lived, positive absorption feature at 950 nm. Upon 532 nm laser excitation, the electron injection from surface-bound 321 to TiO2 is mainly dominated by two processes: (1) the remote dπ(RuIIb) → π*(BL) transition, and further electron injection to the TiO2 surface (eqn (13)). However, the large spatial separation and weak electronic coupling between π*(BL−˙) and the TiO2 interface may induce a low injection rate from this excited state. The previous work had identified ultrafast injection rates and high efficiencies from surface-bound MLCT excited states, whereas low injection rates and efficiencies were observed from remote states.335 (2) Injection from surface-bound RuIIIa → 4,4±-(HOOC)2bpy−˙ MLCT excited states (eqn (14)), which is known to occur rapidly and with high efficiency. Furthermore, electron injection by ITO–RuIIa–RuIIIb–OH23+ that is generated on the surface by electrolysis at Eapp = 1.1 V (vs. NHE) was also investigated. In this case, RuIIa is the only intense light absorber, which shows a combination of dπ(RuIIa) → π*(BL) and dπ(RuIIa) → π*(4,4′-(COOH)2bpy) transitions. The 532 nm laser excitation would result in predominantly bridging ligand-based excited states, followed by intramolecular PCET to form –RuIVbO2+ at the remote site (eqn (15)). (13) (14) (15)

It is worth noting that the injection efficiencies for both forms of the assembly are lower than those for [Ru(bpy)2(4,4′-(PO3H2)2bpy)]2+ bound to TiO2 (TiO2–Ru2+), whereas the back electron transfer rates, TiO2(e−1) → RuIIIb–OH23+ and TiO2(e−1) → RuIVb–O2+, are significantly decreased when compared with TiO2(e−1) → Ru3+ back electron transfer.
In 2012, Hanson et al. reported a layer-by-layer self-assembly strategy for the preparation of the chromophore-catalyst 322 on nanostructured metal oxide substrates by immersing nanocrystalline TiO2 films in three separate aqueous solutions of HClO4 with chromophore Ru unit, ZrOCl2, and the catalytic Ru unit.330 The resulting structures showed rapid intralayer energy and electron transfer.
In 2012, a new di-Ru photocatalyst 323 bearing a synthetically flexible saturated bridging ligand was reported by Ashford et al.336 The key findings are: (1) electron injection efficiencies are wavelength dependent. For example, a higher injection efficiency of ∼30% was observed for 323 when excited at 440 nm, and [RuIIa–]4+ dominates the absorption. A decreased injection yield of ∼12% was observed when excited at 532 nm with the major light absorber being [–RuIIb–OH2]4+. Rapid electron injection occurs on the subnanosecond time-scale. (2) Back electron transfer from TiO2(e−) to the oxidized Ru(III) site was dependent on pH, increasing from 6 μs (pH = 1) to 35 μs (pH = 4.5).
In 2013, Wang et al. examined by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy the ultrafast dynamics of the initial photoactivation step in a supramolecular photocatalyst 324 anchored to TiO2.337 The key findings are: (1) ultrafast electron injection from the light absorbing –RuIIa– site to TiO2 was observed with a time scale ranging from ∼100 fs to several 100 ps. The injection efficiency is as high as 95%. (2) Following the ultrafast electron injection into TiO2, the electron transfer from catalyst [–RuIIb–OH2]2+ to the chromophore [–RuIIIa]3+ occurs on the time scale of 145 ps. (3) Back-electron transfer TiO2 → oxidized [RuIIa–RuIIIb–OH2]5+ was observed on a microsecond-millisecond time scale.
In 2013, Alibabaei et al. first reported photocatalyst 325 bound to the surface of a “core–shell” nanoparticle, as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting.338 The core structure consists of a nanoparticle film of either tin-doped indium oxide (nanoITO) or antimony-doped tin oxide (nanoATO) (generically transparent conducting oxides (TCO)), deposited on a fluoride-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. The shell consists of a conformal TiO2 nanolayer applied by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The “core–shell” nanostructure was proved by TEM experiments, which showed a thin TiO2 shell with a thickness of 3.6 nm (Fig. 64a). In this configuration, effective excitation and rapid electron injection into the nanostructured TCO on the nanosecond timescale was observed. H2 evolution and photocurrent measurements using this photoanode and a Pt cathode were carried out. As shown in Fig. 64b, upon weak light irradiation (7.8 mW) at 445 nm and applied voltage bias (0.2 V vs. NHE) in aqueous pH 4.6 solution (20 mM acetate/acetic acid buffer, 0.5 M LiClO4) at 22 ± 1 °C, the current decreased from 175 to 20 μA. The decrease in photocurrent with time was attributed to the unstable TiO2–[RuIIIa–]3+ assembly. The photon conversion efficiency was 4.4% at the peak photocurrent. The faradaic efficiency for H2 production was estimated as ∼86%. The observed photocurrent provided evidence for O2 production. However, a quantitative investigation was not reported in this work.

In 2014 photoanodes consisting of a mononuclear Ru complex (PS) and dinuclear Ru complex 326 with a planar “bda” ligand (bda is 2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-dicarboxylate) or mononuclear Ru complex (WOCs), bound to TiO2 were presented by Sun's group for light-driven water splitting.339 The changes of photocurrent density with longer-term light irradiation (100 s) are shown in Fig. 65a. Photocurrent density of TiO2–(PS + 326) exhibited a sharp peak and then decays slowly from 1.1 mA cm−2 to 0.7 mA cm−2. By comparison, photocurrent density of TiO2–(PS + mononuclear Ru catalyst) displayed a similar trend, but with lower decays from 0.6 mA cm−2 to 0.45 mA cm−2. Water-splitting performances of DSPECs with the photoanode TiO2–(PS + 326) or TiO2–(PS + mononuclear Ru catalyst) are shown in Fig. 65b. Gas chromatography (GC) results indicated that H2 and O2 can be produced in both the DSPECs. The amount of hydrogen generated by TiO2–(PS + 326) is 1.41 μmol, which is higher than that by TiO2–(PS + mononuclear Ru catalyst) with 0.85 μmol. The corresponding faradaic efficiencies were calculated to be 80% and 72%, respectively. Similar to the trend observed in hydrogen generation, the higher oxygen generation of 0.66 μmol was observed in TiO2–(PS + 326) compared with that of TiO2–(PS + mononuclear Ru catalyst) with 0.40 μmol. The corresponding faradaic efficiencies were measured to be 75% and 68%, respectively. All of the results in this work indicated that the dinuclear WOC shows better catalytic performance than the mononuclear WOC for the light-driven water splitting.

In 2015, based on the previous report of a “core–shell” photoanode, Alibabaei et al. proposed a new strategy for the stabilization of binding to a photoanode surface by adding an inert oxide overlayer of TiO2 or Al2O3 by ALD.81Fig. 66 shows the TEM results for the resulting multi-layered photoanode, the corresponding cross-section image of the photoanode, and the chemical structure of the supramolecular photocatalyst 327. Upon irradiation (15.1 mW cm−2) at 455 nm, this new configuration of the photoanode showed an obvious improvement for the photocurrent density (0.79 mA cm−2) compared with that of the simple “core–shell” ITO–TiO2 (0.1 mA cm−2) or SnO2–TiO2 (0.48 mA cm−2) photoanodes. The experiments used a Pt counter-electrode at 200 mV vs. NHE (0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) bias at pH 4.6 in 0.5 M LiClO4 with 20 mM acetate/acetic acid buffer. With optimization of the thickness of the Al2O3 overlayers (0.55 nm), the photocurrent reached 1.97 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the DSPEC based on SnO2/TiO2 (4.5 nm)–327 (0.3 nm Al2O3) photoanode operated at pH 7 in phosphate buffers at room temperature, with an applied bias of 600 mV vs. NHE, and illumination at 455 nm. The faradaic efficiencies for H2 and O2 generation after 100 s were 57% and 41%, respectively.

In 2015, Sherman et al. reported a novel electrochemical procedure for the photosensitizer–catalyst assemblies on oxide electrode surfaces. The supramolecular photocatalyst 328 attached on core/shell SnO2/TiO2 nanoparticle surfaces was obtained by reductive vinyl coupling to form the central C–C link in the bridge.331 The photoanode produced O2 with a faradaic efficiency of 22% after illumination with 100 mW cm−2 white light with a 400 nm cutoff filter from 60 to 960 s for 5 min in 0.1 M H2PO4−/HPO42− at pH 7, with an applied bias of 0.4 V vs. SCE. Furthermore, upon LED (14 mW cm−2) illumination at 450 nm for 10 min, the solar efficiency for DSPEC production of hydrogen was ∼0.3%.
In 2016, Yamamoto et al. reported a Zn–Ru dinuclear supramolecular photocatalyst 329 assembled on a TiO2 electrode for visible-light driven water oxidation.340 Because of the Zn–porphyrin component, DSPEC with 329 showed a broader wavelength absorption response (up to 620 nm) compared to conventional ruthenium-based sensitizers. Water oxidation efficiency using 329 was higher than the reference systems with co-adsorption of the individual Zn–porphyrin and Ru units. Initial incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCE) of 18% and 6.4% were observed under monochromatic illumination at 424 nm and 564 nm, respectively.
In 2016, Sherman et al. reported a tandem DSPEC (based on a TiO2–330 photoanode) with a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) for water splitting.341 The versatility of this novel DSPEC–DSSC assembly offers significant advantages for applications in solar driven water splitting: (1) the solar absorption spectrum can be easily tuned by the two light-absorbing electrodes, enabling much higher efficiencies for oxygen and hydrogen production compared to single-absorber systems. (2) The achieved photocurrent can be tuned by easy modification of the dye, or the redox mediator, and by selection of the semiconductor support.
In 2017, a covalently linked photosensitizer–catalyst assembly 331 was reported for solar water splitting by Concepcion and co-workers.342 With illumination by a 100 mW cm−2 white light source for 30 s, a maximum photocurrent of ∼0.85 mA cm−2 was achieved for the core–shell electrodes in a 0.1 M acetate buffer, 0.5 M in NaClO4 at pH 5.7. The faradaic efficiency for O2 generation after 5 min illumination was 74%.
In 2017, Wang et al. reported a new core–shell photoanode configuration by the introduction of an Al2O3 layer between the antimony-doped tin oxide Sb:SnO2 (ATO) and TiO2 layers, to control internal electron transfer within the core–shell structure.343 The generated photocurrent density of 332 was improved up to 300% when the thickness of the Al2O3 blocking layer was changed from 0 (27 μA cm−2) to 0.55 nm (76 μA cm−2). However, further increase in the thickness of Al2O3 above 0.55 nm led to a decrease of photocurrent densities.
More recently, Wang et al. devised a novel “bottom-up” surface-ligand exchange strategy for immobilizing pyridyl-substituted Ru(II) catalysts at the surface of a photoanode (Fig. 67).344 Surface-bound pyridine can be exchanged by immersion for 12 h in a methanol solution of the pyridyl-substituted Ru complex. Based on this approach, a series of pyridyl-substituted Ru complexes with a planar “bda” ligand that usually shows lower overpotentials for driving water oxidation, were easily stabilized at the surface of the photoanode. Furthermore, this strategy allows for rapid screening of layer-by-layer surface-bound assemblies, for example, 333 prepared by the immersion of a TiO2–Ru–Zr(IV)–pyridine electrode in a 1 mM solution of the Ru catalyst solution for 4 h. After 10 min photolysis periods, the photocurrent density and faradaic efficiencies are 103 μA cm−2 and 61%, respectively, by using the resulting photoanode of the DSPEC.

In summary, research on DSPECs for water splitting is still in its infancy. There are some key challenges to be overcome. (1) To develop a DSPEC that can be used in light driven water splitting with a high photocurrent density by applying a small external bias, or even no bias. (2) To enhance electron injection efficiency by expanding the light absorption wavelength into the IR or NIR regions. (3) To achieve a DSPEC for water splitting with long-term stability.


4.3.2 DSPECs for CO2 reduction. 
A schematic diagram of a tandem DSPEC for light driven CO2 splitting into CO and O2 is presented in Fig. 61b. The photocathode plays a key role for the CO2 reduction. Generally, water reduction of CO2 to CO is driven at −0.12 V (vs. NHE) and ECB (TiO2) ≈ −0.1 V at pH 0. The absence of a suitable p-type oxide photocathode has greatly limited progress in implementing DSPECs.323 In 2015, Ishitani's group reported a novel hybrid photocathode consisting of a Ru(II)–Re(I) supramolecular photocatalyst and a NiO electrode for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction in a nonaqueous solution.345 However, light driven photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction using water as a reductant became a prime target. Consequently, in 2016, a tandem DSPEC with a NiO–RuRe (334) hybrid photocathode and a CoOx/TaON photoanode was reported by Ishitani's group.83 Upon irradiation at λ = 460 nm, a photocathodic response was clearly observed starting at approximately −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a CO2-purged aqueous solution containing 50 mM NaHCO3 (pH = 6.6). This photoresponse can be attributed to the electron transfer process from the valence band of the NiO electrode to the excited Ru photosensitizer unit in RuRe. Therefore, photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction in the aqueous solution occurs at the NiO–RuRe photocathode.
Photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction data obtained using various electrodes under different applied biases are summarized in Table 11. It can be seen that the formation of CO occurs only when using a NiO–RuRe photocathode with an applied bias. Small amounts of H2 formation are derived from photocatalysis of the degraded product of the Ru photosensitizer, due to the similar results observed in the NiO–Ru system. Water oxidation at a CoOx/TaON photoanode was also investigated in a NaHCO3 aqueous solution (pH = 8.3) under an Ar atmosphere. The photocurrent was observed at −0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl under irradiation at λ = 400 nm; O2 formation was also observed in the liquid phase under these reaction conditions. The Faraday efficiency after 5 min of irradiation was 89%. Subsequently, the authors studied a tandem DSPEC consisting of a NiO–RuRe cathode and a CoOx/TaON photoanode for the CO2 reduction using water as a reductant. The photoanode and photocathode were separated by a Nafion membrane. As shown in Fig. 68, upon irradiation at λ > 400 nm, the transmitted light was received by the CoOx/TaON photoanode through the backside of the NiO–RuRe photocathode and the Nafion membrane. To accelerate the reaction, a bias of −0.3 V vs. CoOx/TaON was applied to NiO–RuRe. Furthermore, a chemical bias of 0.10 V was simultaneously generated from the pH difference between the two electrodes. Finally, this tandem DSPEC showed activity for visible-light-driven catalytic reduction of CO2 in the aqueous solution to generate CO and O2 for the first time. The formed O2 was detected in the liquid phase in the CoOx/TaON photoanode with a faradaic efficiency of 68% after 60 min of irradiation. Simultaneously, the formed CO was also captured in the gas phase in the NiO–RuRe photocathode chamber with a TONCO of 17. The low catalytic performance of the system was suggested mainly to arise from the photocathode. The NiO cathode suffers from slow hole transport and unfavorable interfacial kinetics, resulting in poor catalytic ability and durability in the system. Therefore, further improvements in catalytic ability of NiO photocathodes and exploring new semiconductor oxides are necessary for achieving highly efficient photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction.

5. Chemo/bio-sensors and photodynamic therapy
5.1 Chemosensors
Luminescent chemosensors are of great importance due to their applications in numerous fields, such as chemistry, biology, environmental monitoring and national and personal security.21,346–348 In comparison with conventional fluorescent sensor systems, phosphorescent sensors based on transition metal complexes such as Ir(III), Ru(II), Pt(II) and Au(I) offer advantages such as large Stokes shifts, high chemical- and photo-stability and longer excited state lifetimes (ca. microseconds). Their relatively long lifetimes can be easily distinguished from fluorescent backgrounds (ca. nanoseconds), resulting in higher signal-to-noise ratios in the sensing process.23 Furthermore, the photophysical properties of phosphorescent materials can be fine-tuned via rational modification of the ligand structures and the metal centers.23 Review articles have summarized numerous mononuclear metal complexes for the sensing of different kinds of analytes.23,349–351 However, the development of phosphorescent sensors based on dinuclear metal complexes is still overlooked and will be discussed in this section. Moreover, some key advantages of dinuclear metal complexes will be summarized in comparison with mononuclear counterparts.

5.1.1 Phosphorescent chemosensors for metal cations. 
Metal cations play important roles in biological, environmental and life processes. Consequently, great effort has been devoted to the development of effective chemosensors for the detection of various metal cations.348,352 In this context, representative dinuclear metal complexes are shown in Fig. 69. As a classical strategy, host–guest chemistry of crown ethers has been used to sense guest cations via the formation of non-covalent interactions.353,354 Yam's group have pioneered dinuclear Au(I) complexes for these applications. In 1998 complexes 335–338 with bridging diphosphines (dppm = bis(diphenylphosphanyl)methane; dcpm = bis(dicyclohexylphosphanyl)methane) and benzocrown ether functionalized thiolate ligands were reported.355,356 All these complexes showed bright emission in the range of 492–580 nm in dichloromethane solution at room temperature, originating from a S→Au ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited state. These complexes served as luminescent sensors for metal cations, with specificity depending on the size of the crown ether pendants. For example, 335 and 336 with the smaller crown ether sense K+, whereas 337 and 338 with the larger crown ether sense Cs+. Upon addition of metal cations into a solution of 336, the emission at λmax 520 nm dropped in intensity and a new band appeared at 720 nm (Fig. 70). This new band was suggested to originate from a thiolate ligand-to-metal–metal charge transfer (LMMCT) excited state due to the enhanced intramolecular Au⋯Au interaction in the cation complex.

As an extension of this work, Yam et al. reported two new Au(I) complexes 339 and 340 with different bridging dithiolate ligands.357 Upon addition of various metal cations, UV-vis absorption results indicated that both complexes exhibited preferential binding towards K+ over Na+. The X-ray crystal structure of 340–Na (Fig. 71) showed an intramolecular sandwich binding of the Na cation and the two crown ether units with a 1:1 stoichiometry, in agreement with ESI-mass spectrometry results. Furthermore, the intramolecular Au⋯Au distance was only 3.0825 Å.

In 2004, a new dinuclear Au(I) complex 341 connected by a benzocrown ether functionalized ethynyl bridge was synthesized by Yam's group.358 This complex showed intense phosphorescence in both the solid and solution states, which originates from the [σ(Au–P)→π*(CC)] or metal-perturbed [π→π*(CC)] IL excited states. UV-vis absorption results indicated that 341 specifically recognizes Na+ in CH2Cl2–MeOH (1:1 v/v) at room temperature.
As another sensing strategy, calixarene crown ethers have been widely studied as ion receptors that can hold smaller molecules or ions.359,360 In 2003, a series of luminescent dinuclear Au(I) alkynylcalix[4]crown-5 complexes 342–346 was synthesized by Yam et al.361 All the complexes exhibited orange emission in dichloromethane solution with a band at 578–585 nm originating from metal-perturbed IL or [σ(Au–P)→π*(phosphine)] triplet excited states. All the complexes showed a binding response to K+ and Na+ in the order 345 > 346 ≥ 343 ≥ 342 > 344 and 346 ≥ 342 > 343 > 344 > 345. This order was attributed to the different calixcrown cavity size that was induced by the subtle steric effects of the substituents on the phosphine ligand. For example, smaller-sized 345 represented the largest binding constant for Na+ and the smallest binding constant for K+. Furthermore, the K+/Na+ selectivities of complexes 342–345 are 3 × 105, 1.8 × 102, 1.9 × 102 and 13, respectively.
In 2009, He et al. reported the dinuclear Au(I) complexes 347 and 348.362 Both complexes showed bright emission with bands centered at ca. 448–478 nm in dichloromethane solution at room temperature, assigned to mixed metal-perturbed intraligand (IL) and alkynyl-to-aryl isocyanide (LLCT) excited states. Upon addition of various metal cations, the complexes showed specific binding ability for K+ and Cs+, respectively. A new emission band at 600 nm was attributed to a Au⋯Au interaction induced via a sandwiched binding mode (Fig. 72), resulting in a reduced HOMO–LUMO energy gap.

In 2006, a novel dinuclear Pt(II) alkynylcalixcrown complex 349 was studied for the specific recognition of metal cations by Lo et al.363 Upon excitation, 349 showed a faint emission band at 738 nm, accompanied by a long-lived phosphorescent lifetime in the microsecond range in acetonitrile solution. The emission of 349 originated predominantly from 3MLCT [dπ(Pt)→π*(t-Bu3-tpy)], and probably mixed with some 3LLCT [π(CC)→π*(t-Bu3-tpy)] transitions. The weak emission of 349 was ascribed probably to quenching of the emissive 3MLCT excited state by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the electron-rich alkoxy-substituted calixcrown moiety to the platinum terpyridyl unit. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 73, upon addition of various metal cations, complex 349 showed a specific turn-on response for K+, with selectivities of 102–104-fold greater than for other cations.

In 2013, Chao's group proposed a new strategy for the highly selective and sensitive sensing of Cu2+ ion in aqueous media, in vivo and in vitro by a dinuclear Ru(II) complex 350.364 As shown in Fig. 74, upon addition of various cations, complex 350 exhibited an almost complete quenching response to Cu2+, whereas almost no quenching was observed for other cations. The detection limit for Cu2+ was as low as 3.33 × 10−8 M. Interestingly, 350 showed two-photon luminescence with a significant two-photon absorption cross section (400 GM). Two-photon detection of Cu2+ was also realized by complex 350 when two-photon excitation at 850 nm was applied. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 75, one-photon or two-photon detection of Cu2+ was also realized in living cells with low cytotoxicity, good water solubility, and good membrane permeability.

5.1.2 Phosphorescent chemosensors for anions. 
The selective detection of anions is vital because of their important roles in various chemical, biological, and environmental processes.346,365,366 Ye's group reported in 2012 that complex 350 not only demonstrates a specific response towards Cu2+ cations, but also is an effective probe for CN− anions in water.367 Upon addition of various anions, the emission of 350 was quenched in a specific response to CN−. Moreover, the response to CN− was also observed in mixtures of CN− and other anions. The detection limit for CN− was determined to be 5 μM. The specificity for CN− was attributed to hydrogen bonding to CN− of N–H and phenyl C–H bonds of complex 350 based on heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectra.
In 2010, two dcpm-containing Au(I) thiolate dinuclear complexes 351 and 352 (Fig. 76) with different urea receptors were synthesized by Yam's group.368 Complex 351 showed high selectivity and sensitivity for F−. As shown in Fig. 77, upon addition of 0–1 equivalents of F−, the absorption band at 358 nm decreased gradually in intensity, while two new bands at ∼288 nm and ∼370 nm appeared, demonstrating the formation of hydrogen-bonding interactions between F− and 351. With addition of more F−, a new band at ∼490 nm grew in intensity, with two isosbestic points at 314 and 428 nm, and accompanied by a color change from yellow to red, attributed to the deprotonation of 351. UV-vis absorption and 1H NMR results indicated a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between F− and 351. Furthermore, complex 351 exhibited higher binding affinity for anions compared with that of complex 352, probably because of the higher acidity of the urea moieties as a result of the introduction of the NO2 group in 351.

Subsequently, a new urea-containing Au(I) thiolate dinuclear complex 353 demonstrated highly selective detection of F−, evidenced by decolorization of the yellow solution, and drastic changes of emission and NMR spectra369 Interestingly, the sensing mechanism was attributed not to H-bonding interactions (as occurs in 351 and 352) but instead to irreversible P–N bond hydrolysis, which was confirmed by the ESI-MS spectra (Fig. 78). Cl− was shown to bind to the urea moiety of 353 and not to cleave the molecule.

In 2013, Chao's group reported dinuclear iridium(III) complex 354 for the highly selective and sensitive turn-on detection of sulphite/bisulphite in both living cells and in vitro.370 Complex 354 is non-emissive due to the electron-withdrawing azo bridge quenching the MLCT excited state. However, as shown in Fig. 79, a remarkable enhancement of phosphorescent intensity was observed when 354 was treated with sulfite or bisulfite (26-fold and 27-fold enhancement, respectively). Almost no change was observed when 354 was treated with other anions. The detection limits were determined to be 0.24 mM for sulphite and 0.14 mM for bisulphite. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the sensing mechanism can be attributed to a reaction at the azo group, resulting in the formation of a 354–HSO3− adduct.

Intramolecular energy transfer in the hetero-dinuclear Ru(II)–Os(II) complexes 34 and 35 has been discussed in Section 2.2.4. It is also worth noting that both these complexes can be used as a probe for sensing F−, CN− and AcO− anions.126 The UV-vis absorption and the emission spectra of 34 and 35 red-shift in the presence of F−, CN− and AcO−. Spectrophotometric titrations suggested that these anions induce deprotonation of the imidazole NH group, which is consistent with 1H NMR results showing that the intensity of the NH signal gradually decreased with the addition of F−.
As discussed in Section 3.1.1.2, dinuclear Ir(III) complex 116 showed a specific response towards F−via both OPEP and TPEP processes.198
In 2015, we reported a rapid, highly selective ‘‘turn-on’’ phosphorescent probe for sensing ClO4− anions in aqueous media and living cells by using a novel AIPE-active dinuclear Ir(III) complex 5·2PF6.85 As shown in Fig. 80, complex 5·2PF6 essentially showed faint emission in the HEPES buffer (10 mM in CH3CN/H2O, 1:4, v/v, pH 7.4) with a short decay time (0.02 μs). However, upon addition of different anions and shaking the sample by hand for a few seconds, complex 5·2PF6 responds specifically toward ClO4− with turn-on phosphorescence with a long decay time (0.24 μs) under UV excitation. The detection limit for ClO4− was as low as 0.05 ppm. Importantly, under sunlight, the change in the solution from clear to turbid can be easily observed by naked eyes in a few seconds, which provides a convenient strategy for the sensing of anions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed that nanoaggregates gradually increased in size with the addition of more ClO4− (Fig. 81). 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF negative-ion mass spectra indicated that partial anion exchange has occurred from PF6− to ClO4−. X-ray crystal structure analysis revealed that 5·2ClO4 has a more rigid structure compared with 5·2PF6 which may affect the solubility of the complexes, and induce aggregation in the solvent. Also the increased rigidity of 5·2ClO4 is responsible for the enhanced phosphorescence. To the best of our knowledge, this represented the first example of anion sensing based on AIPE. Further work is needed to determine if this “anion-exchange induced AIPE” process is a general strategy for the selective phosphorescence-based detection of anions.

5.1.3 Phosphorescent chemosensors for explosives. 
In the 21st century, the security of human society has been seriously threatened by an increased frequency of terrorist bomb attacks and the use of land-mines. Consequently, rapid and highly effective detection of explosives has become an issue of paramount importance.371–374 Photoluminescence detection of explosives by using organic fluorescent molecules375–377 and phosphorescent transition metal complexes378,379 has attracted considerable attention owing to their rapid response time, low cost, and high selectivity and sensitivity. However, both fluorescent and phosphorescent materials usually suffer from ACQ, which limits their practical applications at high concentrations or in aggregated states. Therefore, AIE or AIEE-active phosphorescent materials with highly efficient emission in the aggregated and solid states are ideal candidates for the detection of explosives, in comparison with ACQ-active chromophores.
In 2017, two di- and trinuclear AIEE-active cationic Ir(III) complexes 355 and 356 (Fig. 82a) were synthesized by our group for the rapid, highly selective and sensitive sensing of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) which shows enhanced explosive power compared with that of well-known 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).86 Indeed, the selective sensing of TNP among other nitro-aromatic explosives is a challenge owing to their similar electron affinities.380 Both complexes 355 and 356 showed an emission peak at around 571 nm in the pure CH3CN solution (Fig. 82b) with low PLQYs of 0.062 and 0.041, respectively. However, the obviously enhanced emission which was observed in mixed CH3CN/H2O solution (v/v = 1:9) with higher PLQYs of 0.20 and 0.088, respectively, identified both complexes are AIEE materials. Taking advantage of this AIEE behaviour in aqueous solution, both complexes exhibited a specific response to TNP with phosphorescence quenching, whereas no quenching was observed upon the addition of other nitro-explosives. The Stern–Volmer (SV) plots (Fig. 83) were used to analyze the luminescence quenching efficiency, and the estimated Ksv values for 355 and 356 are 49749 M−1 and 96178 M−1, respectively, which are among the highest values reported for luminescent sensors.375,379,381,382 The detection limits for 355 and 356 as phosphorescent sensors for TNP are 0.51 and 0.39 μM, respectively. All the above results demonstrated that AIEE-active complexes can be highly selective and sensitive detectors of TNP in aqueous solution. Since the LUMO energy of 355 and 356 (−2.43 eV) is higher than that of TNP (−3.89 eV), the electron transfer may occur from the higher energy LUMOs of 355 and 356 to the lower energy LUMO of TNP. It is worth noting that compared to the reported AIE- or AIEE-active mononuclear phosphorescence Ir(III) complexes used for detection of TNP,379,381,382 dinuclear complexes 355 and trinuclear 356 exhibit lower LUMO levels due to their more conjugated structures. This reduced LUMO level is closer to the LUMO level of TNP, but is lower than other nitroaromatic explosives, which may facilitate highly efficient selectivity for the detection of TNP. Furthermore, in aqueous media, strong electrostatic interactions can be formed between ionized TNP with a negative charge and cationic complexes 355 and 356. Therefore, the quenching mechanism of these complexes towards TNP is due to a combination of strong electrostatic interactions and efficient electron transfer processes.

In summary, phosphorescent sensors based on di- or multi-nuclear transition metal complexes have significant potential advantages over mononuclear complexes, such as: (1) deep-red emission is easily obtained by introduction of a longer conjugated bridging ligand in the bimetallic complexes;72 this is a great advantage in biological sensing. (2) “Turn-off” sensors usually suffer from limited sensitivity due to competing luminescence quenching by heavy metal ions.383 Therefore, “turn-on” sensors are highly desired. Dinuclear metal complexes are good candidates in this regard, because most dinuclear complexes have lower emission efficiency due to the intramolecular energy transfer from the luminescent 3MLCT state to the bridging ligand-centered excited state which is less emissive.72 However, upon addition of analytes, enhanced emission may be observed due to the new electronic structure of the complex that is induced by a strong interaction between the bridging ligand and the analyte. (3) Highly efficient detection of analytes in aqueous solution or solid state, rather than in organic solvent, is highly desired. Recently, luminescent detection of analytes by AIE or AIEE materials has become popular because of their highly efficient luminescence in aqueous solution, and even in the solid state through the formation of aggregates.373,381,382,384 In principle, AIE or AIEE materials can be easily obtained by designing new di- or multi-nuclear complexes bearing Schiff-base or flexible chain-type bridging ligands.50,85,86,109–111

5.2 Biosensors
Luminescent imaging or sensing of biomolecules and living cells is of great significance in facilitating the study of biological processes in real time.385,386 Phosphorescent transition metal complexes have attracted much attention in applications such as O2 sensing, mitochondrial imaging and tracking, and DNA imaging and sensing,349,387–390 due to the excellent photophysical properties of the complexes, such as: (1) large Stokes shifts that reduce the excitation beam and inner filter effects. (2) Long excited lifetimes that can effectively discriminate the long-lived imaging signals from the short-lived background autofluorescence. (3) Synthetic versatility to optimise photochemical and physicochemical stability. (4) Inherent triplet excited state phosphorescent emission could provide excellent sensitivity to molecular dioxygen, enabling hypoxia imaging.391–393 In this section, the key advances in phosphorescent biosensors by employing dinuclear transition metal complexes are introduced.

5.2.1 O2 probes. 
The quantitative determination of oxygen concentration is of critical value for life sciences and environmental sciences.394–396 The basis of oxygen sensing is via phosphorescence quenching which occurs by energy transfer from the triplet excited state of the phosphorescent chromophore to the triplet ground state of molecular O2.390,397,398 Phosphorescent complexes such as Ir(III), Ru(II), Pt(II) and Pd(II) have been widely studied for O2 sensing due to their high quantum yield (Φ), long decay lifetime, good solubility, and high stability.395,396 However, studies on bimetallic complexes for the sensing of O2 are very rare. This is surprising as compared with mononuclear complexes, bimetallic systems have a great advantage for O2 sensing in living cells due to the relative ease of obtaining deep-red emission.72 It is well known that the lower energy deep-red or near-infrared emission is highly desirable in biological applications for minimizing photodamage to biological samples.399
Recently, Zhao's group synthesized the red-emitting dinuclear Ir(III) complex 357 bearing a 2-pyrimidine-benzimidazole bridging ligand (Fig. 84a).400 The mono-cationic structure of 357 is beneficial for enhanced emission, compared to the low quantum yields of most dicationic Ir complexes. Complex 357 showed red phosphorescence in dichloromethane solution with peaks at 619 and 659 nm, which are red-shifted by 85 nm relative to the corresponding monoiridium complex. DFT calculations indicated that the emission of 357 originated mainly from the 3ILCT state located on the bridging ligand. Ir(III) complexes with 3ILCT character are known to possess longer phosphorescent lifetimes and better oxygen sensitivity than those with 3MLCT character.401 As shown in Fig. 84b, the emission intensity as well as the lifetime of 357 gradually decreased with the incremental increase of O2 concentrations. The Stern–Volmer plots with excitation at 405 nm showed a linear relationship between O2 concentration and I0/I (I = the emission intensity, and I0 = emission intensity without oxygen) indicating that 357 can be used as a phosphorescent probe for the quantitative determination of oxygen. Importantly, intracellular O2 levels in HeLa cells were successfully detected by the probe signals based on both emission intensity and phosphorescence lifetime using time-resolved luminescence imaging (TRLI) techniques. As shown in Fig. 85, the phosphorescence intensity of 357 gradually increased as the O2 concentration dropped from 21 to 2.5%, and was accompanied by an enhanced lifetime. These results suggest that new red-emitting dinuclear Ir(III) complexes are a a promising strategy for obtaining efficient oxygen probes.

Most reports of O2 sensing in living cells are focused on probes in the cytoplasm. There is a strong need for probes which can function in the key organelles.398,402,403 For example, mitochondria are one of the prime targets for O2 sensing as they are the centers of oxygen metabolism, which directly reflect the cell's health. In 2014, a binuclear Ru(II) probe 358 which is bridged across a mitochondrial penetrating peptide (MPP) (Fig. 86) was developed by Keyes's group.404 Complex 358 exhibited excellent cell permeability with rapid, irreversible uptake, and accumulation in the mitochondria. The cytotoxicity of 358 is moderate in the dark, and more than 40% of cells remain viable over 24 h under conditions used for imaging. As expected, the change in O2 concentration within live HeLa cells was successfully monitored by complex 358.

5.2.2 Mitochondrial probes. 
Mitochondria are well known as the powerhouses of the cell. Tracking mitochondrial dynamics is critical for understanding their physiological and pathological processes.405–407 Commercial mitochondrial fluorescent dyes are not suitable for this purpose because due to their poor photostabilities they are unable to monitor life processes over a long time-frame.408 Development of phosphorescent dyes is thus highly desired. In this context complex 358 (see Section 5.2.1 can be used for mitochondrial imaging. Complexes 359–364 (Fig. 87) reported by Pisani et al. in 2010 provided the first examples of dinuclear species acting as delocalised lipophilic cations that preferentially accumulated in the mitochondria.409 The lipophilicity of the complexes was found to increase with the increasing number of methylene groups, thereby allowing greater cellular accumulation. Concomitantly, the cytotoxicity of the complexes increased with the increasing number of methylene groups.
 Fig. 87  The chemical structures of complexes 359–364 (left) and 118–123 (right). 
As mentioned in Section 3.1.1.2, the dinuclear complexes 118–123 serve as mitochondrial imaging dyes via a clathrin-mediated endocytotic pathway, without requiring prior membrane permeabilization or replacement of the culture medium.87 More importantly, 119 and 122 were further developed for tracking mitochondrial morphological changes during the early stages of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 88, upon exposure to cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), the reticulum-like mitochondria were gradually transformed to small and dispersed fragments, which is consistent with previous reports. CCCP acts as an uncoupler that causes rapid acidification of mitochondria and reduces the ability of ATP synthase, resulting in the decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential.

5.2.3 DNA probes. 
The development of optical probes for DNA within the cell nucleus is of great importance for understanding the role of DNA in genetic disease and tumorgenesis.410,411 In 1990, Barton et al. reported the first case of a mononuclear Ru(II) complex 365 (Fig. 89) as a molecular “light switch” for DNA structures in vitro. No photoluminescence was observed in aqueous solution at ambient temperatures, but emission was dramatically enhanced in the presence of DNA, referred to as the “light-switch” effect, owing to intercalation between the Ru(II) complex and DNA.412 Since then, numerous charged mononuclear Ru(II) complexes have been developed to display excellent water solubility and to bind to DNA with high affinities through an intercalative mechanism.383,413–417 In 1993, Carson et al. reported the first cases of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes with high binding affinity for DNA: they also described that the binding affinity can be highly dependent on the ancillary ligands of the metal centers.415 Since then, much effort has been devoted in the development of dinuclear Ru(II) complex systems for DNA binding.101–108,418,419 Interestingly, in contrary to the mononuclear Ru(II) complex system, most dinuclear Ru(II) complexes bind to DNA via a groove binding mechanism: an initial groove-bound and a final intercalated geometry.24 For example, Lincoln and Nordén found that the complex 3 rearranges from a groove-binding to an intercalative geometry that is reached by threading one of the Ru(phen)2 moieties through the DNA duplex, thereby intercalating one of the bridging dppz ligands between the DNA base pairs and thus placing one metal center in each groove.102 Lincoln, Nordén and colleagues also reported a novel type of chiral bis-intercalating Ru(II) complex 366 with extremely high binding affinity (K > 108 M−1) for DNA via a remarkable bis-intercalative binding mode, that is around two orders of magnitude higher than that of the mononuclear complex 367.413, 417 The binding ability with duplex and quadruplex DNA of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes 368–370 (Fig. 90) was firstly investigated by Thomas’ group in 2006.420 Interestingly, both complexes 368 and 369 exhibited enhanced binding ability for quadruplex compared to duplex DNA, which is accompanied by a distinctive “quadruplex light-switch” effect: i.e., highly enhanced and sufficiently blue-shifted emission away from the normal duplex phenomenon. This system showed unique advantages as in vivo quadruplex probes. In 2008, Lutterman et al. showed that intercalation was not required for 369 to act as a molecular “light switch” for DNA based on relative viscosity measurements.421

Although numerous probes for DNA have been developed in vitro, studies involving direct imaging of DNA in living cells are still rare, and are limited by the poor membrane permeability of probe molecules.403,422,423 In 2009, dinuclear complex 368 was used for directly imaging nuclear DNA of living cells by Gill and co-workers.424 The inherent hydrophilicity and high charge of 368 would imply that the molecule will not freely diffuse across the cell membrane. Therefore, the mechanism of cellular uptake of the complex was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 91a, after incubating MCF-7 cells with solutions of 368, it was found that 368 mainly located within the nucleus of the MCF-7 cells with high concentration. A relatively lower concentration of 368 is located throughout the cell cytosol. Remarkably, as highlighted in Fig. 91b, the absence of 368 from endosomal and lysosomal compartments confirmed that cellular uptake of 368 is via active transport rather than an endocytotic pathway. 368 has been investigated as a luminescent probe for DNA. As shown in Fig. 91c, 368 enables visualization of characteristic structural changes in nuclear DNA as cells progress through the cell cycle.

As emerging “functional imaging” techniques, fluorescence (FLIM) and phosphorescence (PLIM) lifetime imaging microscopy make it possible to monitor the changes of some specific biologically relevant microenvironmental parameters and DNA transformations characteristic of different cell cycle stages via reporting of lifetime.425 Particularly, PLIM presents the key advantage over FLIM of a dramatic increase in contrast and probe selectivity due to the possibility of rejecting scattered excitation light and short-lived autofluorescence via long-lived luminescent labeling (τ > 100 ns).426 By far the majority of studies in this field involve PLIM for sensing of parameters such as pH and biological oxygen, however, the sensing of biologically important molecules (such as DNA and RNA) is still very rare.427 In 2011, the Δ- and Λ-enantiomers of mononuclear Ru(II) complex 371 (Fig. 90) were presented to investigate the diastereomeric interaction inside the cell and cell nucleus in fixed and live CHO cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and PLIM techniques by Svensson et al.428 CLSM images indicated that the Δ-enantiomer showed brighter emission in the nucleus and weaker emission in the nucleolus than the Λ-enantiomer. Since both enantiomers exhibited similar affinity to DNA, such a significant difference in the cell staining patterns was attributed to the higher quantum yield of the Δ-enantiomer over that of the Λ-enantiomer when bound to DNA. Live cell PLIM and intense imaging indicated that the cell membrane was impermeable to both enantiomers unless photoactivation aided the uptake. Upon photoactivated internalization, the Δ-enantiomer exhibited the most intense emission with the longest lifetime in the nuclei, while the Λ-enantiomer showed more intense emission in the cytoplasm but longer emission lifetime in the nuclei.
In 2014, PLIM technology was exploited for DNA targeting by Thomas's group.88 This process is independent of probe concentration, whilst providing information on the micro-environment of the probe itself. Furthermore, the large timescale of PLIM, within hundreds of nanoseconds to microseconds, can avoid common problems of biomolecular autofluorescence. In this work, dinuclear complexes 369 and 370 were found to show two-photon absorption for the first time. It is well known that the lower energy two-photon absorption can facilitate luminescence-based deep tissue imaging. Thus, by combining the advantages of longer phosphorescent lifetime and two-photon absorption 369 and 370 were exploited as probes for cellular DNA. As shown in Fig. 92, 2P-PLIM images presented luminescence decay kinetics from live MCF-7 cells labeled with 369. The emission predominantly originated from the cell nuclei with a lifetime of 165 ± 16 ns (left). A similar emission lifetime from the nucleus (176 ± 11 ns) was observed when focusing upon a single cell (right). The capability of 369 and 370 to act as high-resolution 2P-PLIM DNA stains was further studied. Fig. 93 shows 2P-PLIM (left) and confocal (right) imaging of HeLa metaphase spreads labeled with 369. Similar PLIM intensity and lifetime images of the chromosomes are observed from both the metaphase and interphase nuclei (182 ± 12 ns and 182 ± 4 ns, respectively). Furthermore, the observed small region of short-lived emission (Fig. 93, location c) was attributed to a precipitate of 369. This work indicates that 2P-PLIM for DNA targeting may be a promising probe for specific sub-cellular targets even in deep tissue in the future.

In 2014, two new dinuclear Ir(III)–Ru(II) complexes 372 and 373 (Fig. 94) which function as luminescent nuclear DNA-imaging agents for confocal microscopy were presented by Thomas's group.429 Complexes 372 and 373 showed unstructured emission with peaks at 660 and 675 nm, respectively in acetonitrile solution, which arise from a Ru(II)-based 3MLCT state. Cellular-imaging experiments using 372 and 373 were carried out. The key findings are: (1) both complexes exhibited superior cellular uptake properties in comparison with Ru(II)–Ru(II) analogues, which is due to the lower charge of the Ir(III)–Ru(II) system, and hence increased lipophilicity. (2) Fluorinated derivative 373 exhibited rapid and enhanced nuclear staining in HeLa cells compared to 372 (Fig. 95). This indicates that fluorination can promote cellular uptake of transition-metal bioprobes.

In 2017, two new dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 374 and 375 (Fig. 96) were reported by Kim's group.430 Both complexes exhibited an appreciable affinity for single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA in vitro. Specifically, 374 displayed a unique G-quadruplex DNA binding affinity with larger enhancement of emission, but 375 did not. The reason was attributed to the more extended planar structure in 374 that more easily intercalates into G-quadruplexes. However, cellular imaging experiments indicated that cell nucleus stains were not observed for both complexes, which were localized only in the cytosol of HeLa cells.

In contrast to the rigid, planar and hydrophobic linker in 374 and 375, Liu et al. reported the dinuclear Ir(III) complex 376 (Fig. 96) with a flexible pentamethylene linker. 376 showed specific binding to G-quadruplex DNA in vitro due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the complex and G-quadruplex DNA.431
Specific recognition of mismatched DNA is of great importance for cancer diagnosis and therapy, since DNA mismatches are associated with oncogenic transformation.432–434 In 2016, Che's group reported a series of luminescent mono- and dinuclear Pt(II) complexes with out-of-plane bulky ancillary ligands. These complexes showed a specific binding affinity towards intracellular mismatched DNA.387 As shown in Fig. 97, dinuclear Pt(II) complex 377 showed faint emission in the presence of well-matched DNA of HCT116 cells, whereas greatly enhanced emission was observed in the presence of mismatched DNA of HCT116N cells. This difference was attributed to the specific binding between the complex and mismatched DNA via cooperative π-stacking and a groove binding interaction (Fig. 97a), since the mismatched sites possess larger binding pockets. Pt(II) complexes with out-of-plane bulky ancillary ligands are, therefore, promising candidates for cancer diagnosis via simple emission spectroscopy measurements.

In summary, the study of phosphorescent probes for dynamic imaging and monitoring of biomolecules, especially in living cells, is a new research field that is gaining momentum. Generally, the cellular uptake is influenced by the overall charge, size, hydrophobicity and structure of the conjugated moiety of the complex. Dinuclear metal complexes as biosensors show several advantages over their mononuclear counterparts, such as: (1) ease of obtaining deep-red emission by introduction of a longer conjugated bridging ligand. Red emitters are important for biological sensing in living cells and in deep tissue. (2) Dinuclear complexes usually exhibit better photostability when compared with mononuclear analogues via introduction of a bulky conjugated bridge to enhance the coordination strength between the metal center atoms and the bridging ligand. High stability is beneficial for long-time imaging and tracking. (3) Dinuclear metal complexes have been used as a selective probe for DNA by the rational design of symmetric/asymmetric chemical structures of dinuclear complexes to control the different modes of groove binding. Therefore, further developments of new biosensors based on dinuclear complexes are expected.

5.3 Photodynamic therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive medical technique comprising a photoactivated process to destroy malignant cells via the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) while sparing the normal tissues. Singlet oxygen (1O2) as a primary toxic ROS is produced by energy transfer from the triplet excited state of photosensitizers to the ground state of O2.435–438 Series of fluorescent porphyrin-based439 and BODIPY-based440 photosensitizers have been developed to generate 1O2 for the treatment of cancer cells. However, these kinds of photosensitizers usually suffer from the poor conversion rate of singlet oxygen, and need a long irradiation time which can result in harmful side-effects on human skin. Phosphorescent photosensitizers based on transition metals, such as Ru(II) and Ir(III), are promising candidates for PDT, and they show several advantages compared with fluorescent photosensitizers,441,442 such as: (1) rapid and efficient triplet excited state generation owing to the strong SOC of the complex, which can promote the formation of 1O2. (2) The longer triplet excited lifetimes of complexes is beneficial to the efficient production of 1O2. (3) Deeper tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light can be obtained via specific functionalisation of the chelating ligands and the bridge that surround the metal atoms. Currently, most reported phosphorescent photosensitizers for PDT are focused on mononuclear metal complexes, with only rare examples of dinuclear species.
Recently, a series of dinuclear complexes 378–382 (Fig. 98) acting as PDT photosensitizers toward human SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells in vitro was reported by Sun's group.443 The rigid π-conjugated linkers of the complexes served to expand the visible absorption region and to enhance the molar extinction coefficients. The octyl chains were attached to the central fluorene unit to enhance the penetrability of the cell membrane. 378–382 exhibited orange-red emission with λmax 580–620 nm. The transient absorption spectra and DFT calculations indicated that triplet states were predominantly 3π,π* (centered at the terpyridyl bridging ligand) for 378 (τ = 3.1 μs) and 381 (τ = 48 μs), and 3CT for 379, 380, and 382 (τ = 1.7–2.7 μs). The significantly enhanced lifetime of 381 compared to 378 was attributed to the stronger ligand field of the C^N^N ligand that contains the stronger σ-donating 6-phenyl ring, resulting in a large energy separation between shorter lifetime 3CT and longer lifetime 3π,π* states. Before studying the PDT effect of 378–382 for human SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells, the dark toxicity was investigated. Complexes 379 and 381 exhibited greater dark toxicity than complexes 378, 380 and 382. The PDT effects of all the complexes under different visible and red light sources were evaluated. Upon irradiation with red light (625 nm), the photocytotoxicities of all the complexes are very weak and showed no obvious change compared with the cytotoxicity in the dark. However, under visible light all the complexes showed an obvious PDT effect via1O2 generation: the PDT efficiency is in the order 380 > 378 > 381 > 382 > 379. Thus, 380 with nanomolar photocytotoxicity and the highest phototherapeutic index (PI) of 288 is the most promising photosensitizer for PDT. Cellular imaging experiments of all the complexes, with or without light treatment, were performed to probe the cellular uptake by SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells. As shown in Fig. 99, in the dark only 378 appeared to be readily taken up into the cells. However, upon treatment with visible light (50 J cm−2) excitation, the observed phosphorescence from all five complexes suggested photoactivated cellular uptake. 379 and 381 were located at the cytoplasm and multiple nucleoli; 380 and 382 were distributed throughout the cell, whereas only cellular debris was observed for 378.

More recently, a series of deep-red emissive Ir(III) complexes 383–385 with different numbers of iridium centers, and the corresponding nanoparticles (NPs) (Fig. 100a) have been studied as photosensitizers for PDT in vitro and in vivo by our group.90 The assembly of NPs is shown in Fig. 100b, comprising the iridium complexes as the core which were encapsulated by a biocompatible 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[maleimide(poly(ethyleneglycol))-2000] (DSPE-PEG-MAL), and with the HIV-1 transactivator (RKKRRQRRRC) as the surface functionalization group. HIV-1 Tat is the cell penetrating peptide, which can effectively enhance the cell penetrability of the NPs. Complexes 383–385 are AIE materials, which show enhanced emission in water–THF mixtures compared to that in pure THF solutions. In contrast to the relatively weak emission observed from complexes 383–385 with PLQYs in the water–THF mixtures of only 11%, 5% and 8%, respectively, their corresponding NPs (NP1–3) showed a remarkable enhancement with PLQYs of 33%, 15% and 35%, respectively, in water solution. The NPs are deep-red emitters with λmax 652 nm, 671 nm and 690 nm, respectively. The 1O2 generation ability was found to increase with the increasing of numbers of Ir centers for both the PSs and the NPs; this was evaluated by measuring the absorbance of indocyanine green (ICG) upon light irradiation. The PDT effect of the PSs 383–385 and their derived NPs for HeLa cells in vitro were investigated. As shown in Fig. 101A–D, all the NPs showed negligible dark cytotoxicity. However, as expected, all NPs showed strong photocytotoxicity under light irradiation (20 mW cm−2) for 30 min. The photocytotoxicity increased incrementally with the numbers of Ir centers, with NP3 exhibiting the best PDT performance. In contrast to the impressive PDT properties of the NPs, all the PSs exhibited a poor PDT effect. Cellular uptake experiments indicated that NP3 showed significantly stronger emission in comparison with PS3 which was located at the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Tumor inhibition experiments using NP3 with or without light were carried out in vivo. As shown in Fig. 101E and F, in the groups 1, 2 and 3 without either light or NP3, the relative tumor volume increased 8–9 times after 14 days of feeding. In sharp contrast to the groups 1–3, in the group 4, treated with both light and NP3 simultaneously, the tumor volume was significantly reduced, indicating that NP3 is a promising photosensitizer for PDT in vivo.

In summary, the development of photosensitizers based on dinuclear or multinuclear complexes for PDT is still a largely unexplored topic. However, this kind of photosensitizer has exhibited better PDT performance compared with their corresponding mononuclear complexes, with clearly increased 1O2 generation ability. The reasons may be attributed to the wider absorption range of multinuclear complexes in the visible light region, and the greater production of triplet excitons which is induced by the increased numbers of Ir centers, accompanied by enhanced spin–orbit coupling.
6. Smart materials
Mechanochromic luminescent (MCL) materials are a class of “smart” materials whose emission colors can be changed when an external force (such as grinding, crushing, rubbing, or extrusion) is applied, leading to either a chemical or a physical structural change.444,445 The physical mechanisms of MCL are mainly ascribed to the phase transformations from a crystalline state to a different crystalline state, or from a crystalline state to an amorphous state. These transformations are accompanied by a change in the mode of molecular packing and molecular conformation, which affects the HOMO–LUMO energy levels and consequently alters the luminescent properties. Generally, this force-triggered luminescent change can be reversed and the original emission is restored via a recrystallization process when the treated material is heated or exposed to organic solvent/vapour. A variety of MCL materials have been developed, including organic small-molecules,446–448 metal clusters,449–451 metal complexes,54,452,453 carbon dots,454 polymers,455–457 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)53,458 and perovskites.459,460 There is huge potential for MCL materials in applications such as sensors, memory chips and security inks. The development of metal complexes in this context is a significant topic due to their excellent phosphorescent properties. The MCL mechanism in metal complexes is considered to originate from intramolecular conformational folding or twisting, as well as from variations in intermolecular π–π, C–H⋯π, metal–metal, or hydrogen-bonding interactions.461–465 In this section, recent advances in mechanochromic dinuclear metal complexes will be discussed.
6.1 Au(I) complexes
In recent years, Ito's group, Liu's group and others have investigated mono- and dinuclear Au(I) complexes with MCL properties.51,462,466–472 The MCL mechanism is mainly attributed to changes in the intra- or intermolecular Au⋯Au interactions upon application of external force stimuli (Fig. 102).
 Fig. 102  The chemical structures of dinuclear Au(I) complexes. 
In 2008, Ito et al. reported a dinuclear Au(I) complex [(C6F5Au)2(μ-1,4-diisocyanobenzene)] (386) which showed intense blue emission in the solid state.473 As shown in Fig. 103, upon gentle grinding of 386, the emission color changed to yellow. After treatment of the ground 386 with drops of dichloromethane, the emission reverted to the original blue color, demonstrating reversible MCL behaviour. XRD results (Fig. 104b) indicated that 386 undergoes a phase transformation from a microcrystalline state to a metastable amorphous state during the grinding process. The IR spectrum (Fig. 104a) indicated that upon grinding obvious changes occur in the coordination mode of the isocyanide ligand to the Au(I) atom, giving rise to the red-shifted emission. The crystalline structure of 386 is shown in Fig. 104c; the shortest Au⋯Au distance of 5.19 Å is far beyond the range of significant aurophilic bonding (2.7 Å to 3.3 Å). However, upon grinding, it was considered that the aurophilic interaction is enhanced via rearrangement to molecular stacking in the amorphous phase, leading to the observed yellow emission.

In 2013, Reber and Raithby et al. investigated the MCL mechanism of 386via applied hydrostatic pressure on the molecule.474 Contrary to the previous conclusion of Ito et al.,473 crystallinity was retained throughout, and the absence of obvious intermolecular interactions indicated that the MCL mechanism of 386 is due to the altered molecular geometry and crystal packing under hydrostatic pressure, with rotation of the central phenyl rings out of the plane of the terminal pentafluorophenyl rings, rather than enhanced aurophilic interactions.474 These different mechanisms may be attributed to the different nature of the applied external stimuli, for which hydrostatic pressure is unidirectional, whereas grinding is multidirectional.
In 2012, Liang et al. reported a series of dinuclear Au(I) complexes 387–391 with various aromatic bridging ligands.475 Upon grinding, complexes 387 and 388 exhibited a redshifted (∼100 nm) emission from blue to green color. In contrast, complex 389 exhibited a relatively smaller redshifted (∼25 nm) emission. No MCL behaviour was observed for 390 and 391. XRD results indicated that, upon grinding, a phase transformation from crystalline to metastable amorphous state was observed for 387–389, whereas no phase transformation was observed for 390 and 391. This work demonstrated that the MCL properties of these complexes are significantly affected by the bridging ligand structures.
In 2015, Seki et al. reported that the dinuclear Au(I) isocyanide complex 392 with pyridyl end groups exhibited interconvertible tetracolored emission.476 As shown in Fig. 105a, 392 exhibited four individual solid state emissions (blue, green, yellow and orange) from the samples named as 2B, 2G, 2Y and 2O, respectively. The as-synthesized solid sample of 392 is 2Y. Soaking 2Y in acetone solution (step i in Fig. 105c) lead to the blue-emitting solid sample 2B which immediately transforms to a green-emitting sample 2G upon drying in the air (step ii in Fig. 105c). No further color change was observed even under reduced pressure for weeks. When 2G was mechanically ground in a ball-mill at 4600 rpm for 10 min (step iii in Fig. 105c), the yellow emission of 2Y was recovered. After grinding for an additional 5 min (step iv in Fig. 105c), orange emission was observed, corresponding to the formation of 2O. PXRD patterns showed obvious crystalline states of 2B, 2G and 2Y, whereas the ground 2O was amorphous. Single crystal and PXRD analyses indicated that aurophilic interactions were not present in 2B and 2G, but were present in 2Y. The amorphous 2O phase is suggested to contain aurophilic interactions with the shortest Au⋯Au distance.

More recently, Seki et al. reported that 393, which is a meta-substituted isomer of 386, exhibits pseudopolymorphs with different emission properties via different solvent crystallization procedures.466 The corresponding emission peaks are in the range of λmax 488–519 nm. XRD results indicated that distinct crystal structures are responsible for the different emission properties. Upon grinding, all samples underwent redshifted emission with a new peak at λmax 540 nm upon formation of an amorphous state. This phase transformation was reversible via heat treatment of the ground samples.
In 2015, Chen et al. reported a fluorene-based dinuclear Au(I) complex 394, which showed AIE and MCL simultaneously.477 As shown in Fig. 106, complex 394 is faintly emissive in pure DMF solution, whereas intense yellow emission is observed when a large ratio of H2O was added into the mixtures, indicating that 394 is AIE active. Upon grinding, 394 exhibited obvious MCL properties with green emission changing to yellow. This change was reversed to the original green emission upon treatment of the ground sample with dichloromethane or heating at 100 °C for 30 s. XRD results attributed the reversible MCL behaviour of 394 to a phase transformation between the crystalline and amorphous states.

Subsequently, Chen et al. reported a series of carbazole-based dinuclear Au(I) complexes 395–397 which showed AIE and MCL properties simultaneously.478 XRD results indicated that the MCL mechanism of all complexes was due to a phase transformation from a crystalline state to an amorphous state. Interestingly, upon grinding, complex 395 showed reversible MCL behaviour, while irreversible MCL behaviour was observed for complexes 396 and 397. The X-ray crystal structure analysis revealed strong intermolecular aurophilic interactions in 397, with the shortest Au⋯Au distances of 3.040 Å. Upon grinding, the intermolecular aurophilic interactions may be further enhanced, making it difficult to revert to the original state.
To study the effect of o-, m- and p-isomerization on MCL properties, complexes 398–400 were synthesized.479 All these complexes exhibited AIE activity. The o-isomer 398 exhibited reversible MCL behaviour; the m-isomer 399 displayed reversible mechanical force-induced luminescence enhancement behaviour; whereas no MCL behaviour was observed for p-isomer 400. Furthermore, two new m-substituted complexes 401 and 402 also showed reversible mechanical force-induced luminescence enhancement, which is consistent with the data for 399.480
More recently, Chen et al. reported a new bipyridine-bridged dinuclear Au(I) complex 403, which showed AIE and MCL properties simultaneously.481 An SEM image (Fig. 107) revealed rod-shaped aggregates due to the self-assembly of 403 in the DMF:H2O (1:9 v/v) mixture. Synergistic effects of intermolecular Au⋯Au interactions and restricted intramolecular rotation were suggested as the cause of self-assembly of 403. Aggregated 403 exhibited high emission efficiency (Φ 56%, λmax 553 nm) in DMF:H2O (1:9) mixture. Reversible high-contrast phosphorescent mechanochromism was observed for solid samples of 403.

In 2016, 2,2′-binaphthyl-bridged dinuclear Au(I) complex 404 was synthesized by Ito's group.482 As shown in Fig. 108, crystals of racemic [(rac)-404] and homochiral [(S)-404] exhibited distinct emission colors with different crystal packing arrangements. Upon grinding, both crystals transform into amorphous powders with essentially the same red-shifted emission spectra and enhanced PLQYs, compared to the parent crystals.

In 2015, a series of dicationic dinuclear Au(I) cyclophane complexes 405–409 with various counteranions (X−) was reported by Deák et al.483 Interestingly, the emission colors varied from yellow to red, depending on the different counteranions. All the complexes exhibited reversible thermochromic (room temperature to 77 K) and MCL properties. XRD results indicated a crystalline-to-amorphous phase transformation occurred during the grinding process. The authors proposed that N–H⋯X interactions played a significant role in the observed MCL properties, while the intermolecular Au⋯Au interaction was effectually precluded by the introduction of the bulky diphosphine ligands. The dicationic structure could also disfavour Au⋯Au interactions due to Coulombic repulsion, although the authors do not comment on this.
In 2016, Yagai et al. reported the new complex 410 with flexible triethylene glycol (TEG) side chains.484 As shown in Fig. 109, before grinding complex 410 exhibited structured emission peaks at 427 and 452 nm. Upon grinding of 410 for only 1 s, yellow emission with λmax at 564 nm appeared. Further repeated grinding of 410 gave green emission with λmax at 536 nm. Polarized optical microscopy (POM) revealed three different phases of 410 during the grinding process. As shown in Fig. 110, the green-emitting and blue-emitting phases were found in a birefringence crystalline domain, which is characteristic of a crystalline state. However, no birefringence was presented in the yellow-emitting phase, indicating an amorphous state. These results indicated that the MCL mechanism of 410 was attributed to a rare crystal-to-crystal transformation mediated by a transient amorphous state.

In 2014, three dinuclear Au(I) complexes 411–413 bearing glycol bridges of different lengths were reported by Liang et al.485 All complexes showed obvious AIE properties in different solvent–water mixtures. However, in the solid state, 411–413 showed very low PLQYs of <1% with emission at λmax 485 nm for 411 and 480 nm for 412 and 413, respectively. Upon grinding, the emission for all the complexes showed a dramatic increase of intensity accompanied with a red shift in the emission spectra of >15 nm. The PLQYs of ground 411–413 are 67.5%, 44.9% and 31%, respectively. The MCL mechanism was attributed to the formation of aurophilic interactions and the changes in multiple intermolecular interactions, such as C–H⋯F, C⋯F and weak π–π.
6.2 Ir(III) complexes
The first example of an Ir(III) complex with MCL properties was reported by our group in 2012.453 Since then, various mono- and dinuclear Ir(III) complexes with MCL have been developed.50,109,110,463,486–493 Interestingly, in most of the cases, AIE and MCL activity are observed simultaneously. This is consistent with the opinion first expressed by Chi's group, that AIE materials may be a key treasure source for mechanochromic luminescence.445 There are four different types of MCL Ir(III) complexes based on the structure of the ancillary ligand, including alkyl chains,486–491 dendrimer-like,492 Schiff base50,109,110 and rigid aromatic ring.463,493
In contrast to mononuclear Ir(III) complexes, dinuclear Ir(III) analogues with MCL properties are very rare. Only four examples are known, namely complexes 7, 8, 11 and 12, all with Schiff base bridging ligands, reported by our group (Fig. 111).50,109,110 The ionic complexes 7 and 8 show faint emission in dilute solution, while bright orange emission with λmax at 612 nm and 627 nm, respectively, was observed in the solid state,50 indicating their AIE nature. Upon grinding, both 7 and 8 exhibited obvious MCL behaviour with a red-shift of the emission by ca. 20 nm to λmax 635 nm and 648 nm, respectively. This emission change can be rapidly reversed to the original emission by exposure of the ground samples to CH2Cl2 vapour due to the vapour-induced recrystallization. Based on detailed single-crystal structure analysis and XRD measurements, it was proposed that phase transformations from the crystalline to the amorphous state occurred in the grinding process and the flexible imine units of the bridging ligand play key a role in achieving simultaneous AIE and MCL properties. Taking advantage of the AIE and reversible MCL of complex 8, a rapidly re-writable phosphorescence data recording device was successfully constructed (Fig. 112).

In 2017, two new neutral dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 11 and 12 were presented by our group.109,110 Similar to the previous ionic complexes 7 and 8, both 11 and 12 exhibit AIE and MCL properties simultaneously. These combined properties of 11 were exploited in the design of a simple, convenient and efficient technology for optical data encryption and decryption. As shown in Fig. 113a, in the encryption stage, the characters ‘NENU’ were written on a filter paper with an orange-emitting fluorescent material selected from the literature as MASK. Next a sample of ground 11 (abbreviated as G) that showed a similar emission color to the Mask was carefully spread on the paper with the letters ‘AIPE’. Under UV irradiation, the emission from G was hidden by the Mask with an identified orange emission. In the decryption stage, when DCM solvent was sprayed onto the as-prepared letters ‘NENU’, the intense yellow security letters ‘AIPE’ appeared, originating from the emission of unground complex 11. This reversible encryption and decryption cycle was performed several times. This work suggested that AIE and MCL-active Ir(III) complexes are promising candidates in the practical applications of anti-counterfeit and optical data encryption.

Furthermore, taking advantages of mechanochromic and vapochromic properties of complex 12, a device for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was fabricated. As shown in Fig. 113b, the ground complex 12 gave no obvious response to low polarity organic vapors, showing only faint emission. However, remarkably enhanced emission was observed when 12 was treated with various low polarity organic vapors. The device can be reversibly switched between the ON or OFF states via organic vapor fumigation and grinding processes, due to the phase transformations between the crystalline and amorphous states.
6.3 Other metal complexes
In 2015, a Zn(II)-salen helical complex 414 (Fig. 114a) was reported by Mizukami et al.494 As shown in Fig. 114b, the crystals of 414 exhibited intense green emission, while light-blue emission was observed after crushing the crystals into a powder (Fig. 114c). This MCL behaviour was assumed to be the result of a crystal phase transition with the blue-shifted emission attributed to weakened intermolecular π–π interactions.

In 2016, a dinuclear Pt(II) complex 415 with bis-salen ligands and an isobutenylene linker (Fig. 115) was reported by Achira et al.495 The crystals of 415 exhibited intense yellow emission (Fig. 115d) which is similar to its mononuclear analogue (Fig. 115a). Upon crushing, crystals of both mono and dinuclear complexes showed enhanced intensity of emission, but without any color change (Fig. 115b and e). However, when the crushed microcrystals were smeared into thin films on a glass slide, complex 415 exhibited an obvious color change from yellow to orange (Fig. 115f) whereas no change in emission was observed for its mononuclear analogue (Fig. 115c). These data indicate that dinuclear complex 415 exhibits enhanced pressure sensitivity which the authors suggest to arises from the introduction of the semiflexible linker, which contributes to the fragility of the molecular packing in the crystals of 415 under shear stress.495

Recently, Lu et al. reported four dinuclear Cu(I) complexes 416–419 bearing hexadentate macrocyclic N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands (Fig. 116).496 Crystal structure analysis revealed a co-crystal comprising two molecules of 417a and one molecule of 417b. The crystals of the acetonitrile-free complexes 418 and 419 were obtained by slow vapor diffusion of diethyl ether into a solution of heated 416 and 417 in a mixed solvent (CH3OH/acetone and CH3OH/ether, respectively). The as-prepared 418 showed a red-shifted emission spectrum with a higher PLQY of 93%, when compared with 416, 417 and 419. These properties were attributed to the strong intramolecular cuprophilic interaction of 418 in the triplet excited states. Upon grinding (Fig. 117), 416–419 exhibited an obvious color change (with a red-shift of the emission of 20–28 nm). XRD results indicated that a phase transformation from the crystalline to the amorphous state occurred in the grinding process. The mechanism of MCL was attributed to strong intramolecular cuprophilic interactions with a short Cu⋯Cu distance induced by grinding.

In summary, a range of MCL-active dinuclear metal complexes including Au(I), Ir(III), Zn(II), Pt(II) and Cu(I) complexes has been presented. The structure–property relationships as well as the MCL mechanisms have been discussed. In the bimetallic systems, MCL behaviour can be obtained via introduction of flexible bridging ligands between the two metal centers. The MCL mechanisms are widely assigned to variations in intermolecular π–π, C–H⋯π, intra- or intermolecular metal–metal, or hydrogen-bonding interactions.54,445 However, there is still scope for further insights into the detailed MCL mechanisms. Dinuclear metal complexes with MCL properties are still very rare. Further design and synthesis of new families of MCL-active dinuclear metal complexes remains a very active topic. Tang et al. stated that the restriction of intramolecular motions (RIMs) in AIEgens plays an essential role in their mechanochromic effects.497 When a stimulus is applied to RIM-dominated AIEgens which have relative loose packing modes, the weak inter- or intramolecular interactions (e.g. π–π, C–H⋯π, metal–metal, or hydrogen-bonding interactions) can be modified or destroyed, resulting in MCL. Furthermore, Chi et al. have stated that the existence of a relatively stable crystalline state is a prerequisite for mechanochromism. AIE compounds with strong crystallizability or non-crystallizability are generally unsuitable as mechanochromic luminescent materials.445 Notably, series of AIE-active dinuclear Au(I) and Ir(III) complexes have been shown to exhibit MCL behaviour, therefore, AIE-active metal complexes are expected to become a rich source of MCL complexes.
7. Conclusions and outlook
In this review, we have summarized recent advances in the chemistry of dinuclear metal complexes and their applications. Many of the studies have been motivated by exploring their fundamental structural and optoelectronic properties. Early work focussed on dinuclear analogues of the paradigmatic Ru(II) complex [Ru(bpy)3]2+. Research then extended to a wide range of other metals, such as Re(I), Rh(III), Ir(III), Pt(II), Au(I), Os(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) in combination with a vast array of tailored ligands. Importantly, as a result of judicious molecular design (and some serendipity) many bimetallic complexes are now known to display specific photophysical properties and enhanced device performance exceeding that of their mononuclear metal complexes. These recent exciting findings should encourage chemists to further explore bimetallic chemistry. Moreover, this review article has systematically discussed the relationships between electronic structures and luminescent properties, which provide insights into the excited state character and intramolecular electron or energy transfer process in these complexes. However, it remains difficult to predict the charge transfer mechanism in a di- or poly-nuclear complex based on current knowledge. There is still no universal rule to explain the accurate structure–property relationships of different kinds of dinuclear metal complexes in all their diverse applications. Ongoing systematic variation of molecular structures allows the detailed investigation of the effects of bridge distance, energy gap and conformation on electronic coupling. These factors will promote future investigations into the photoinduced electron and energy transfer processes, and the development of molecular-based devices. Thus, the field is wide open for the rational design of new luminescent bimetallic systems with fine-tuned and desirable physical and chemical properties. Further breakthroughs can be anticipated in the fields of OLEDs, photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction, DSPEC, chemosensors, biosensors, PDT and smart materials.
It is well known that organic luminescent materials usually suffer from the notorious ACQ phenomenon, which can greatly limit their practical applications. However, the anti-ACQ property of AIE can overcome these difficulties. Recently, numerous AIE-active organic molecules have been developed and they show particular advantages when compared with ACQ-active materials in various optoelectronic applications such as non-doped OLEDs, real-time pressure mapping, high-level security devices, biological probes and photodynamic therapy.497–502 By contrast, AIE-active metal complexes have been less studied. We anticipate significant developments of novel AIE-active bimetallic complexes, which will impact the future of optoelectronic technology. For practical applications we particularly highlight the following two areas which are at the forefront of exciting advances in dinuclear metal complexes.
(i) Non-doped organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)
While OLEDs based on transition metal emitters via host–guest doping methods have been extensively exploited, the development of non-doped OLEDs is still highly desired due to their easier preparation, superior reproducibility of manufacture, lack of unwanted host–guest interactions and potentially enhanced device stability. The combined advantages of AIE and excellent phosphorescent/TADF properties from dinuclear metal complexes, should lead to highly efficient and stable non-doped OLEDs. In contrast to mononuclear metal complexes, the larger size of di- or multinuclear metal complexes not only reduces intermolecular triplet–triplet annihilation, but also retards the attack of nucleophiles on the complex, which is believed to be the reason for the higher stability of the devices.503,504 In addition, design and synthesis of new AIE-active dinuclear metal complexes with bipolar characters via decoration of cyclometalated ligands or bridging ligands may further facilitate improved device efficiency.
(ii) Photodynamic therapy (PDT) under hypoxia
Currently, PDT investigations are mainly performed under normoxia conditions where oxygen supply is sufficient, which is the opposite to hypoxic solid tumor cells.441 Therefore, development of new photosensitizers for efficient PDT under hypoxia is of great significance. Because of the strong SOC accompanied with good ability to generate triplet excitons, transition metal complexes possess superior oxygen sensitivity. However, most luminescent transition metal complexes usually suffer from ACQ in the aggregated state, which greatly limits the production of triplet excitons. Therefore, AIE-active materials are ideal candidates. In contrast to the mononuclear species, di- or multi-nuclear AIE-active transition metal complexes may be a better choice due to their enhanced SOC and triplet exciton generation derived from the introduction of another metal atom in the molecule. Furthermore, easily obtained long wavelength emission in dinuclear species has great potential applications in deep tissue imaging therapy.
