    , Accepted 8th October 2018First published on 9th October 2018AbstractWe report a series of conjugated molecules containing an IDT/IDTT core and BI-H/NI-H end groups, which tend to self-assemble to supramolecular J-aggregates either directed by intermolecular multiple hydrogen bondings (IDT-BI-H, IDT-NI-H, IDTT-BI-H) or promoted by π–π interactions between the end groups of the adjacent molecules (IDTT-NI-H), as revealed by single-crystal structure analysis combined with spectroscopy studies. The J-aggregates absorb high energy visible light and convert to low energy delocalized excitons due to the coherent resonance of the transition dipoles of the monomers. The thin films of these J-aggregates are used as interlayers in inverted polymer solar cells between the ZnO layer and the active layers. The delocalized excitons in the J-aggregates transfer more energy to the active layer that compensates for the energy loss caused by the interlayer absorption, which results in quite similar external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the absorption region of the J-aggregates (400–550 nm). Furthermore, some of these J-aggregates show enhanced electron collecting and transporting properties that result in obviously increased EQE in 550–750 nm, which might be attributed to the improved contact between the interlayers and electron acceptor ITIC for similar A–D–A type molecular structures. The results clearly indicate the promising strategy for high performance interlayers by designing J-aggregates of dye molecules.
Introduction
In the past several years, great progress has been achieved in polymer solar cells (PSCs) with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼15%, due to the quick development of novel light-absorbing active materials and device engineering.1–7 Among the known optimizations, the cathode interlayer is of importance to improve the performance of inverted polymer solar cells (i-PSCs), which can help to form ohmic contacts between the active layer and the electrode, prohibit charge recombination, tune the energy levels and alter the morphology of the active layer.8–13 One of the commonly accepted rules for the design of high performance cathode interface materials is to keep high transparency, in order to avoid the possible energy losses caused by the absorbance of the interface layer.14–17 For this reason, the investigations on cathode interlayer materials have been mainly focused on wide-band gap or non-conjugated small molecules and polymers. For example, wide-band gap polyelectrolytes with UV-light absorbing fluorene units (PFN and its derivatives) and non-conjugated ethoxylated polyethyleneimine (PEIE) have been widely applied as cathode interlayer materials in the past decades.18–20 These materials usually possess low electron mobility and conductivity due to the large band gap or the insulating nature. In principle, if the excitonic energy could be transferred to the active layer efficiently, the absorption of the interlayer would not be a problem. In this context, a large number of low band-gap materials which possess high electron mobility properties could be considered as candidates for high performance cathode interlayer materials.21–24 Most recently, visible light absorbing polyelectrolytes and hybrid materials were reported as cathode interlayers.25–30 The absorbed visible light greatly enhanced the overall performance, especially the conductivity of the interlayers, and as a result, the device performance was increased obviously.21,28–30 In a very rare example, the absorption of the cathode interlayer was proved contributing to the short-circuit current in devices.31
Luminescent solar concentrating materials that absorb high energy visible light and transfer to low energy excitons have been widely investigated to enhance the PCEs in multiple junction solar cells.32–36 Organic conjugated molecules possess a four-energy-level characteristic that enables wide-range absorption and largely red-shifted emission, which is beneficial for application as luminescent solar concentrators.37 In addition, the proper intermolecular orientation may enhance fluorescence resonance energy transfer within molecular aggregates.38,39 According to the transition dipole interaction models, parallel molecular stacking with slipping along the transition dipole direction, i.e. J-type aggregates, may promote exciton energy migration due to the large orientation factor.39 The long distance exciton migration of J-aggregates inspires us to apply these kinds of J-aggregates as electron transporting layers in PSCs, since the absorbed photons might be transferred to the active layers with high energy transition efficiency. In our previous studies, perylene bisimide J-aggregates were successfully used as cathode interlayers to modify ITO and enhanced device performance was achieved.21,28–30 Long-range ordered supramolecular J-aggregates not only afford a certain waveguide for enhanced absorption, but also contribute to the electron transition for enhanced electron collection from the active layers. Recently, J-aggregates have been attracting attention as excellent solar concentrators and light absorbing media, owing to their unique spectral response in the OPV devices.40–42 The conversion of higher excitation contributes to the increasing absorption of the active layer and higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the device.
In this work, we designed and synthesized four acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type molecules, which could easily self-assemble into supramolecular J-aggregates. Here, indacenodithiophene (IDT) and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) were used as electron donor units, and benzimide (BI-H) and naphthalimide (NI-H) were used as electron acceptor end groups. The A–D–A structure enables these molecules to show a very high absorption coefficient in the sky-blue light region. Due to the multiple N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds, together with steric effects between the core and end groups, the four molecules (IDT-BI-H, IDT-NI-H, IDTT-BI-H and IDTT-NI-H) formed J-type molecular stacking as revealed by single-crystal structure analysis and spectroscopy investigation. These light-absorbing J-aggregates were used as solar concentrating interlayers to modify the ZnO surface in i-PSCs. Most importantly, quite similar EQE values in the absorption region of the J-aggregates (400–550 nm) clearly indicate that the absorption of the J-aggregates does not induce energy loss. In addition, increased EQE values in 550–750 nm were obtained, which is attributed to the enhanced electron extracting and transporting properties of the J-aggregate interlayers. The results clearly demonstrate that the construction of J-aggregates is a novel strategy to develop multi-functional interlayer materials.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The chemical structures of IDT-BI-H, IDT-NI-H, IDTT-BI-H and IDTT-NI-H, which were synthesized via multistep reactions as given in the ESI (Scheme S1†), are shown in Chart 1. The detailed synthesis procedures can be found in the ESI.† The target products were characterized by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The detailed spectra and thermodynamic properties are shown in the ESI.† The easy formation of intermolecular hydrogen bondings was investigated by concentration-dependent 1H NMR and FT-IR. As shown in Fig. 1, the NMR signals of the hydrogen atom from N–H protons (marked in red) shifted from high δ to low δ with the increase of concentration, which corresponds well to the formation of intermolecular N–H⋯O bonding.43 FT-IR measurements were used to further attest the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the solid state as shown in Fig. S3.† Thermal characteristics of the four molecules were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S1†). All molecules exhibited good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) above 450 °C, and no signs of glass transition under 300 °C. These four molecules are well soluble in protic solvents like tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dimethylformamide (DMF) for the elimination of relatively strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, while they are poorly soluble in nonprotic solvents such as toluene, dichlorobenzene etc (Fig. S2†). The different solubilities of these molecules facilitate layer-by-layer solution procession of multiple layered devices by using orthogonal solvents.

Single-crystal structures and film morphology
The four molecular single crystals were prepared in a mixture of chloroform and ethanol using the liquid–liquid diffusion method. X-ray diffraction on single crystals was processed to study the molecule structures, the solid state packing and intermolecular interactions of IDT-BI-H, IDT-NI-H, IDTT-BI-H and IDTT-NI-H. Fig. 2 and 3 show the oak ridge thermal ellipsoid plot (ORTEP) structures and intermolecular stacking structures of the four molecules, respectively. Crystal data and structure refinements are listed in Table S1.†

The conformations of four molecules in crystals were quite different especially the twisting angles between the core structures and the BI-H/NI-H groups as shown in Fig. 2. Obviously, NI-H units promote more twisted molecular structures due to the steric effect. The symmetrical conformations were observed in IDT-BI-H and IDT-NI-H, with dihedral angles of 8.26° or 47.68° between the BI-H plane or NI-H plane and the IDT cores. When the IDT core was π-extended to the IDTT core, both IDTT-BI-H and IDTT-NI-H showed asymmetrical conformations with dihedral angles of both sides of 10.97°/13.30° and 68.73°/71.56°. The geometrics and electronic properties of IDT-BI-H, IDT-NI-H, IDTT-BI-H and IDTT-NI-H in the optical ground state were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level, which could be found in the ESI.†
As discussed above, IDT-BI-H possesses a rather planar molecular conformation in the crystal. As shown in Fig. 3a, the IDT-BI-H molecules form a planar network in two dimensions through multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Along the molecular long axis direction, the IDT-BI-H molecules are linked to molecular chains through two parallel N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds with an interaction distance of 2.05 Å. The molecular chains are connected through interchain C–H⋯O hydrogen bonds with interaction distances of 2.75 Å and 2.63 Å, respectively. As the side alkyl chains are twined around each other, it leads to the π-distance of over 8 Å that means negligible π–π interaction between the IDT cores. As for IDT-NI-H (Fig. 3b), the double N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds are also observed between the NI-H units with an interaction distance of 2.03 Å. In addition, the π–π interaction between NI-H units is also observed with a π-distance of 3.37 Å. The large twisted angle between the IDT and NI-H units makes it possible to form weak intermolecular π–π interaction with the π distance of 4.07 Å between the IDT cores. Assisted with both intermolecular hydrogen bonds and π–π interactions, the IDT-NI-H molecules are packed parallelly with a slip angle of 32.3°, which means the formation of J-type aggregates in the solid state.
It shows more complicated stacking modes for IDTT-BI-H and IDTT-NI-H due to their asymmetric conformations and intermolecular tortuosity. Assuming the BI-H/NI-H unit with a smaller twisted angle as the head and the other larger one as the tail, IDTT-BI-H exhibited the head-to-tail overlap with the typical brickwork arrangement, while IDTT-NI-H exhibited alternately head-to-head and tail-to-tail overlap of NI-H units. In the IDTT-BI-H crystal, the slip angles were around 23° and 18° and the π-distance was 3.4–3.5 Å in the brickwork plane. In addition, hydrogen bond linking was observed by the connection of head BI-H to tail BI-H units between the brickwork plane, and the N–H⋯O interaction distances are 2.07 Å and 2.11 Å. As for the IDTT-NI-H, the large twist conformation and side alkyl chains hinder the stacking of the IDTT core with a vertical distance of 7.06 Å, however the IDTT core became the H donor and interacted with the carbonyl of the adjacent NI-H unit. Besides, the head NI-H and tail NI-H units became H donors and acceptors alternatively, accompanied by π stacking with NI-H units, and thus forming the supramolecular fibrous configuration. The C–H⋯O interaction distances are given in Fig. 3d.
The GIWAXS patterns of IDT-BI-H, IDT-NI-H, IDTT-BI-H and IDTT-NI-H thin films are shown in Fig. 4. The crystal planes could be indexed based on the information of single crystals. As for IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H, π planes were parallel to the (011) and (020) crystal planes respectively, indicating the π plane face-on orientation. The large and flat π network was beneficial for electron transfer and collection. In contrast, the (001) crystal plane was perpendicular to the IDT core for IDT-NI-H in single crystals. The edge-on arrangement for IDT-NI-H and a low degree of crystallinity for IDTT-NI-H counted against the channel for electron transfer, which was confirmed in device investigations as discussed below.

Optical properties
The ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the four molecules in THF and thermally annealed thin films (80 °C for 10 min) are shown in Fig. 5, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S2.† The maximum absorption peaks of IDT-BI-H, IDT-NI-H, IDTT-BI-H and IDTT-NI-H in THF are located at 471, 479, 485, and 488 nm, respectively, while in annealed thin films, new absorption bands emerged at the low energy side of the spectra for IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H, and the bathochromic shifts are around 35 nm and the spectra show more distinct structures as shown in Fig. 5a and c. The spectral evolution clearly indicates the formation of J-aggregates in the annealed thin films of IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H.

IDT-NI-H also exhibited similar absorption spectral evolution with a bathochromic shift of 54 nm from the solution state to the annealed thin film as shown in Fig. 5b. However the less structured absorption spectra were observed, which might be attributed to the less ordered molecular stacking in thin films for weak intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the adjacent molecules in the J-aggregates as demonstrated in the crystal structure. As shown in Fig. 5d, a small bathochromic shift of only 6 nm was observed for IDTT-NI-H from a monomer to a thin film, indicating the negligible coupling between neighboring molecules. The weak intermolecular coupling of IDTT-NI-H is consistent with its amorphous state in thin films as revealed by GIWAXS experiment (Fig. 4d). The PL spectra of the four molecules mainly located at the 550–750 nm region, and the quantum yields were measured to be 13–24% in annealed films, as listed in Table S3,† which indicated relatively high radiative transition. The HOMO energy levels were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement, and the LUMO energy levels were determined from optical band gaps which can be found in the ESI.†
In order to investigate the dynamics of aggregate formation of the J-aggregates, temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded in toluene/MCH mixed solvents as shown in Fig. 6. The four molecules in toluene/MCH mixed solvents at 90 °C exhibited a similar absorption to that in dilute toluene solutions (Fig. 5) indicating that the molecules dissolved at high temperature. As the temperature decreased, the absorption bands for monomers were observed decreasing step-by-step, while the J-aggregate absorption bands emerged and the absorption intensity increased gradually which indicates the formation of aggregates at low temperature. The red shifts were 58 nm, 92 nm, 41 nm and 70 nm for IDT-BI-H, IDT-NI-H, IDTT-BI-H and IDTT-NI-H, respectively, compared with monomer absorption peaks. The aggregate absorption peak positions of IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H correlate well with those in the thin films; however, those of IDT-NI-H and IDTT-NI-H do not correlate well with the absorption in thin films. The less ordered molecular stacking of IDT-NI-H and IDTT-NI-H in thin films corresponds to the wide and unstructured spectral characteristics. In addition, both J-type coupling and H-type coupling are non-negligible in the disordered molecular stacking in the film state, which may lead to the broad and less shifted spectra of thin films relative to solutions.44

Photovoltaic properties
The IDT-BI-H, IDT-NI-H, IDTT-BI-H and IDTT-NI-H J-aggregates were used in nonfullerene i-PSCs. The device configuration is ITO/ZnO/J-aggregates/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Al. The control device with bare ZnO as the cathode interlayer was also fabricated as a reference. The J-aggregate layers were spin-coated onto ZnO films from 1 mg mL−1 THF solution of each molecule. The thickness of the organic J-aggregate layers was determined to be ∼10 nm. The introduction of J-aggregates effectively lowered the work function of the ZnO layer, as investigated by the Kelvin probe (Fig. S6†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves, EQE curves of the i-PSCs under AM 1.5G irradiation at 1000 W m−2 and in the dark are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S7,† and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1. The related optimizations, including modifier layer thickness and annealing temperatures, are summarized in Tables S4 and S5.† The best PCE values of 10.65% and 10.53% were achieved in the IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H based i-PSCs, which showed about 6.8% and 5.3% enhancement compared to that of the bare ZnO based device, while i-PSCs based on IDT-NI-H and IDTT-NI-H interlayers showed moderate PCEs.

Compared with the device based on the bare ZnO interlayer, the introduction of IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H J-aggregates in the i-PSCs can obviously increase the PCEs, which is mainly attributed to the increased Jsc and FF, while the introduction of IDT-NI-H and IDTT-NI-H layers shows a little bit negative effect on the device performance. It should be noted that although the introduced organic interlayers may absorb visible light, the Jsc values of the devices are at the same level or even higher than the bare ZnO based device. In detail, the average Jsc of the bare ZnO based device is 16.39 mA cm−2, and those of the devices with organic J-aggregate layers are in the range of 16.14–17.09 mA cm−2, which means the absorption of the organic interlayers does not induce energy loss. Indeed, from the EQE curves as shown in Fig. 7b, we can clearly see that for all the four organic J-aggregate interlayer based devices, EQE values in the absorption region of the J-aggregates (400 nm–550 nm) are quite similar to that of the device based on bare ZnO. We propose that the absorbed high energy photons by J-aggregates transform to low energy delocalized excitons which migrate to the interface between the interlayer and the active layer and then split to electrons and holes, and thus compensate for the energy loss caused by the interlayer absorption. It should be noted that the EQE values in the region of 550–750 nm in the devices based on the J-aggregate interlayers are obviously increased when compared with the device based on bare ZnO. Since the absorption of ITIC is mainly located in the long wavelength region, we propose that the increased EQEs in the region of 550–750 nm are corresponding to the enhanced electron extraction ability of the J-aggregate layers from ITIC. The solar concentrating function of J-aggregates and the enhanced intermolecular electron migration between J-aggregates and ITIC contribute to the increased Jsc of the devices.
Here, the J-aggregates could be regarded as multi-functional interlayers.
Space-charge limited current (SCLC) methods were adopted to measure the electron mobilities of the i-PSCs with or without J-aggregates, and the device configuration is Al/ZnO/(w/o J-aggregates)/PBDB-T:ITIC/Ca/Al. The current–voltage (J1/2–V) curves are shown in Fig. S8.† The electron mobilities were calculated and are listed in Table 1. The IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H based i-PSCs showed increased electron mobility when compared with that of bare ZnO based i-PSCs, and the enhancement is about 40%, while the IDT-NI-H and IDTT-NI-H based devices showed reduced electron mobility. The different electron mobilities of the devices are consistent with that of the single-crystal structure, that is the planar molecular structures of IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H and the very strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds are favorite for electron mobility while the twisted molecular structures of IDT-NI-H and IDTT-NI-H and their relatively disordered stacking would reduce electron mobility.
In order to further investigate the functions of the J-aggregates in the devices, the analysis of charge recombination dynamics and the charge extraction process in the i-PSCs were performed. Fig. 8 shows the transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) curves for these devices. As in Fig. 8a, the IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H based devices showed increased charge carrier lifetimes of 1.88 μs and 1.62 μs when compared with the bare ZnO based devices (1.37 μs), while the IDT-NI-H and IDTT-NI-H based molecules showed decreased charge carrier lifetimes of 1.23 μs and 1.30 μs. The longer carrier lifetime indicated the reduced recombination in devices. Fig. 8b shows the TPC measurement results, and the charge extraction times for IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H based devices were determined to be 0.21 μs and 0.23 μs which are shorter than those of the bare ZnO based devices (0.24 μs), while they are increased to 0.29 μs and 0.26 μs for IDT-NI-H and IDTT-NI-H based devices. The increased charge lifetime and decreased charge extraction time for IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H based devices were the main reasons for increased FF value and PCE.

Conclusion
New kinds of light absorbing materials were designed and synthesized, which tend to form J-aggregates easily due to the existence of N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds and the steric effects between the core and end groups. The J-aggregates of the four molecules were used as interlayers between ZnO and the active layer in nonfullerene i-PSCs. The organic J-aggregate layers absorb high energy photons and then transfer to low energy excitons, which transfer more energy to the active layer. As a result, EQE loss was observed to be negligible in the absorption region of the J-aggregates. The enhanced intermolecular electron extraction of J-aggregates from ITIC contributed to the obvious EQE enhancement at the long wavelength visible light region. The planar molecular structure of IDT-BI-H and IDTT-BI-H and strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds endow their J-aggregates with relatively high electron mobility, which facilitates the electron extraction and transportation from the active layer to the cathode. The results clearly demonstrate that the construction of light-absorbing J-aggregates is a new strategy to develop high performance multi-functional interlayers.
