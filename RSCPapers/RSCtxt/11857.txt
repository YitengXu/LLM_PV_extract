    , Accepted 17th May 2021First published on 19th May 2021AbstractEfficient charge generation and transfer are crucial for organic solar cells (OSCs) to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE). The ternary strategy is commonly used to expand the absorption range of the device by utilizing complementary absorptions of three materials. However, the role of balanced electron transfer and hole transfer in ternary OSCs is rarely reported, although it is essential to improve the performance of the device. Here, we achieved balanced photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and photoinduced hole transfer (PHT) processes in PBDB-T:PC71BM:IT-M ternary OSCs, which is identified by the absorption, internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements. In addition, the VOC of ternary OSCs is found to increase with an increase in the ratio of IT-M, which is in good accordance with the “alloy model”, as revealed by the increased ECT estimated from the EL measurements. The enhanced PHT from IT-M to PBDB-T is supposed to be a result of the improved blend film phase morphology and material crystallization of the active layer under the optimal condition, as revealed by the GIWAXS and TEM studies. Thus, the charge generation and transportation of the ternary device are improved, increasing the JSC and FF of the devices. The findings here are of great importance to understand the origin and role of balanced dual charge generation pathways in ternary OSCs, providing potential methods to further improve the performance of materials and devices.
Introduction
In the past decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility and transparency, which are important when compared to inorganic solar cells.1–8 However, due to the properties of organic semiconductors, such as low charge carrier mobility and unbalanced carrier transport, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs is relatively low. Recently, the performance of OSCs has been enhanced achieving new milestones with PCE exceeding 18% in single-junction or ternary devices.9–18 These high PCEs are mainly achieved by the new non-fullerene acceptors and new donors.19 Ternary OSCs are also effective devices to improve the device performance by utilizing a complementary spectrum of different materials.1,20 Ternary OSCs usually consist of two donors and one acceptor (D1:D2:A1)21–23 or one donor and two acceptors (D:A1:A2).24–26 Compared with binary OSCs, these three components can not only provide a wider absorption spectrum to generate more photogenerated excitons but also have other functions, such as promoting the dissociation of excitons and optimizing the morphology of the film.27–29 As a result, the performance of ternary devices can be improved by increasing the short-circuit current (JSC) without sacrificing the open-circuit voltage (VOC).30,31 In recent years, studies on ternary OSCs that use non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) as the third component to supplement light absorption have gradually increased.32 By using a combination of non-fullerene and fullerene acceptors, the light absorption of the device from near ultraviolet to near infrared can be increased,21,33 and the morphology of the active layer is also optimized through the interaction of the three materials,34,35 which is crucial for improving the short circuit current density (JSC) of the devices. In addition, the effective energy level of carriers in the device can also be adjusted to a certain extent, which can provide an important way to improve the VOC of the device.23,36 However, most of the researches have not paid attention to the influence of the ternary strategy on the charge transportation processes of the device, although it is very important for the physical research of the device and the development of new materials.
There are usually two charge transfer channels that may cause exciton dissociation in OSCs.37 One is the photoinduced electron transfer process (PET), in which the donor is initially photoexcited by incident lights and then the excited electrons are transferred from the donor to the acceptor (as shown in Fig. S1(a), ESI†).38,39 In the other channel, the acceptor material is photoexcited first and then the electron is transferred from the donor to the acceptor, which is named photoinduced hole transfer (PHT), as shown in Fig. S1(b) (ESI†). To the first order of approximation, the efficiencies of the PET and PHT are governed by the energy offset, which can drive the separation of electron–hole pair into free carriers.40 The offset of the electron affinity (EA) of the donor and acceptor (usually equal to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy) is defined as ΔEc1 = EAA − EAD, where EAA and EAD represent acceptor electron affinity and donor electron affinity, respectively. The offset of the ionization potential (IP) of the two materials (usually equal to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy) is defined as ΔEc2 = IPA − IPD, where IPA and IPD represent the acceptor ionization potential and the donor ionization potential, respectively.
Here, we used PBDB-T as the donor, and PC71BM and IT-M as acceptors to fabricate ternary OSCs, and conducted an in-depth study on the charge transfer mechanism for the PET and PHT processes. We demonstrated that, in this ternary system, the PHT charge separation from IT-M to PBDB-T is greatly improved as compared to the PBDB-T:IT-M binary device, as revealed by the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) characteristics. Therefore, more balanced PET and PHT processes are formed in the device to facilitate charge transfer and photocurrent generation when the ternary component ratio is 1:0.8:0.2 (PBDB-T:IT-M:PC71BM). As a result, due to the balanced high PET and PHT, an average IQE greater than 70% in the main absorption range from 400 nm to 850 nm has been achieved. The increased efficiency of PHT from IT-M to PBDB-T is speculated to be due to the optimized film morphology of the active layer and the formation of an “acceptor alloy” of the two acceptors.
Experiment section
Materials
Electron donor material PBDB-T and electron acceptor PC71BM and IT-M were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. We used them as received without any purification. ZnO layers were made from a precursor solution using the following reagents: 1 g zinc acetate, 10 ml ethylenediamine methanol and 280 μl ethanolamine. These materials were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Fabrication of inverted ternary OSCs
The inverted ternary blend device structure is: ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:PC71BM:IT-M (100 nm)/MoO3 (5–10 nm)/Ag (80–100 nm), as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The blend solutions of the donor polymer and acceptors were prepared (D/A = 1:1 by weight, with a total concentration of 20 mg ml−1) in chlorobenzene (CB) with 0.5% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and heated at 60 °C for 12 h. The ITO substrates were pre-cleaned with isopropyl alcohol, detergent, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min in sequence. After drying in the oven at 70 °C overnight, the ZnO solution was spin-coated on the ITO-glass at 2600 rpm for 40 s and then heated at 200 °C for 1 h. The thickness of the ZnO layer was in the range of 30–40 nm. After the heating process finished, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen filled glovebox. Following the deposition of the ZnO interlayer, the PBDB-T:PC71BM:IT-M active blend layer, with a nominal thickness of ∼80–100 nm, was prepared by spin-coating a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (99%:1% by volume) solution (with a total concentration of 20 mg ml−1) at 2500 rpm for 2 min. The films were kept in the high vacuum chamber for more than 1 h to wipe out the additive. Devices with different fullerene/non-fullerene acceptor (A1/A2) ratios were fabricated to figure out the variation of VOC. Finally, to complete the assembly of the devices, the top electrode was thermally evaporated with an 8 nm MoO3 layer, followed by a 100 nm Ag film at a base pressure below 4 × 10−4 mbar. The effective area of the devices is 0.16 cm2, defined by the shadow mask.

Characterization and measurement
The absorption of PBDB-T, PC71BM and IT-M were attained using a 3600 ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer. The J–V characteristic curves of the solar cells were measured on a Keithley 2400 source equipment unit under AM1.5G simulated solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. EQE/IQE measurements were performed using a QE/IPCE Measurements Solar Cell Scan (QE-R 3011 Enlitech Inc.) system equipped with a calibrated silicon photodiode as the reference cell. We estimated ECT in our BHJ solar cells via EL measurements and Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS). The temperature was approximately 25 °C. The characteristics of the solar cells were statistically analyzed by testing over 10 cells. The PL characteristics were measured using a Fluorolog-3 (HORIBA Scientific).
Results and discussion
The typical J–V characteristics of the devices with different IT-M composition ratios from 0% to 100% in acceptors are shown in Fig. 2(a), and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. The best PCEs of the two binary devices with the combination of PBDB-T:PC71BM and PBDB-T:IT-M were 6.77% (VOC of 0.84 V) and 8.88% (VOC of 0.93 V), respectively. At the optima ratio of 80 wt% IT-M in total acceptors in ternary devices, the best PCE of 10.16% was achieved with the highest JSC of 16.44 mA cm−2. The variation trends of VOC and JSC with the ratio of IT-M are shown in the Fig. S2(a) and (b), respectively (ESI†).

To investigate the relationship between the photocurrent and the charge transfer pathways in PBDB-T:PC71BM:IT-M ternary OSCs, the EQE measurement was carried out, which reveals the overall efficiency of the conversion of incident photons to electrons.39 As shown in Fig. 2(b), as the ratio of IT-M in the ternary OSC changes, the shape of the EQE curve of the device changes significantly. When the proportion of IT-M in the receptor is 80%, the EQE of the device is sufficiently improved, particularly in the range from 650 nm to 800 nm, which is attributed to the absorption of IT-M. As a result, when the IT-M ratio increased from 0% to 80%, the JSC of the corresponding devices continuously increased from 11.99 mA cm−2 to 16.44 mA cm−2. Moreover, the tendency of VOC to increase with an increase in the IT-M ratio suggests that the VOC of ternary OSCs is not pinned to the energy level of any combination of the binary blends, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S2(b) (ESI†). It is further found that the VOC of the ternary device has a quasi-linear relationship with the component ratio of IT-M, which is consistent with the other work mentioned above.23
To study the origin of the variation of VOC with the composition ratio of the active layer, we carried out the charge transfer (CT) energy level study of the device by electroluminescence (EL) measurements according to the method proposed by Tvingstedt et al.41 All the EL data were obtained at +80 mA. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the EL peak values of the PBDB-T:PC71BM and PBDB-T:IT-M binary devices are estimated to correspond to energy of 0.90 eV and 1.25 eV, which are the energy level positions of ECT in the devices. Since the LUMO levels of PC71BM and IT-M are around 4.30 eV and 3.98 eV, respectively,42,43 the difference of the ECT of the two binary BHJ indicates that the energy levels of the CT states in the two systems are almost correspond to the LUMO level difference. As the IT-M ratio in the device increases, the CT energy shows an increase consistent with the above-mentioned VOC results. Thus, the VOC was found to be related to the ECT of the devices herein. Based on the Gaussian distribution theory and the linear energy equation for an alloy, the VOC of ternary blends can be calculated by the following equation according to the “alloy model”:44–46 VOCternary = VOCbinary,1 × f1 + VOCbinary,2 × f2(1)The schematic of the alloy model is shown in Fig. 3(b). According to the above-mentioned discussion, we speculate that by changing the donor–acceptor ratio in the PBDB-T:PC71BM:IT-M ternary device, the ECT energy level in the device can be adjusted, which ultimately affects the VOC in the device. Therefore, this ternary system used here conforms to the “alloy model”.

To verify the influence of the ternary strategy on the charge transfer in the device, the active layer photoluminescence (PL) quenching study was carried out. A laser pulse at 580 nm is first used as the excitation light source to excite the donor in active layer films. When the donor and the acceptors (PC71BM or IT-M) are mixed to form a binary system, the obvious PL quenching phenomenon occurs (>95%), which indicates that the excitons in PBDB-T can easily be transferred to the acceptors, as shown in Fig. 4(a). In the ternary film with the highest device efficiency (PBDB-T:PC71BM:IT-M = 1:0.2:0.8), the PL quenching efficiency of the donor is also very high, which means that the charge transfer process from the donor to the acceptors in the ternary film is also very efficient. In order to confirm whether there is charge or energy transfer between the two acceptors, the PL quenching of the films in which the two acceptors were blended separately was studied. The result shows that the intensity of the IT-M excitation peak (around 750 nm) is almost linearly related to its proportion in the film, as shown in Fig. 4(c). Therefore, we believe that there is no obvious charge transfer between the two acceptors. Simultaneously, we also found that the PL quenching of the IT-M acceptor is very efficient in both the binary system and the ternary system, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Furthermore, after normalizing the PL spectra of the films, we found that the relative PL peak (around 670 nm) intensity of the donor is smaller than that of the two binary films, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Considering that the component ratio of the donor in all films is the same, it is reasonable to conclude that the ternary system is more conducive to the charge dissociation from the donor to acceptor according to the above discussion.

(d) The PL spectra of PBDB-T and blend film of PBDB-T:IT-M, PBDB-T:PC71BM, PBDB-T:IT-M:PC71BM (1:0.8:0.2) excited at a pump wavelength of 680 nm. 
To eliminate the influence of optical effects such as interference and parasitic absorption to gain a more in-depth understanding of the influence of the ternary devices on the PET and PHT processes, we further obtained the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the device by combining the EQE and reflection spectrum of the device,47 as shown in Fig. 5. According to the method proposed in previous studies, the charge collection efficiency is independent of the energy of incident photons.48–51 Thus, IQE can be divided into three different parts: exciton diffusion, charge transfer, and charge collection:52 ηIQE = ηEDηCTηCC(2)In this relationship, the efficiency of charge transfer is closely related to the efficiency of PET and PHT. Since PHT and PET processes usually result in the same CT state, any difference in IQE spectra can be due to the difference in the efficiency of converting excitons to the CT state. The spectral shape of IQE should be related to the spectral shape of the charge generation efficiency. Therefore, IQE is essential for exploring the contribution of PET and PHT to charge generation.40 As shown in Fig. 5, the donor PBDB-T has strong light absorption in the range of 500–650 nm, and the PET process mainly occurs in the corresponding range in the IQE curve. It is worth noting that the absorption coefficient of the ternary film (PBDB-T:PC71BM:IT-M = 1:0.2:0.8) in the range of 600–750 nm is significantly lower than that of the binary (PBDB-T:IT-M) film. However, the IQE of the ternary OSCs corresponding to this range is higher than that of the binary devices. This indicates that the efficiency of the PHT process dominated by it is higher, though the total content of IT-M is lower in ternary devices as compared to that in the binary device. This is attributed to the fact that the “acceptor alloy” formed by the two acceptors in the ternary device has a deeper common HOMO energy level than IT-M, so a larger ΔEc2 is formed between the donor and the acceptors, thereby increasing the efficiency of the PHT process.

The blend film phase morphology and material crystallization of the active layer can also have an important influence on the PET and PHT of the device,53,54 so we carried out the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations to study the morphology features of the active layers. The brighter diffraction peaks of the π–π stacking (010) reflection can be found in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction located at around 1.76 Å−1 for the PBDB-T:PC71BM:IT-M layer with the optimal D–A ratio (1:0.2:0.8) film, as shown in Fig. 6(b) and (c), which can be identified as a stronger ordering of the face-on population aggregates.43 The stronger crystallinity and face-on orientation of the donor in the active layer under this condition can thus be confirmed. Moreover, the micro-structure of the PBDB-T:PC71BM:IT-M layer with the optimal D–A ratio shows a moderate phase separation and better blend structure, as shown in Fig. 6e–l, which is more favourable for efficient charge separation and transport in the device. The above optimized film morphology features could be the main causes for the higher efficiency of the PET and PHT processes and could also result in higher hole mobility, as has been discussed below.

To investigate the relationship between the carrier transportation and the device performance, we also studied the carrier transport characteristics of the devices. The detailed data of carrier mobility are shown in Fig. S6 and Table S4 (ESI†). The hole mobility significantly increased as the ratio of IT-M increased and reached a maximum value of 5.36 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the optimal composition ratio (PBDB-T(1):PC71BM(0.2):IT-M(0.8)) ternary device, which could be a result of the more balanced PET and PHT processes as well as the higher crystallinity of the donor in the active layer, as revealed by the previous GIWAXS studies. This again could be partially responsible for the photocurrent enhancement in the devices. The charge lifetime (τ) in the devices is further measured by transient photovoltage (TPV) techniques.55 A distinctly slower decay signal is observed for devices under the optimal blend ratio compared to other devices, indicating a longer carrier lifetime, as shown in Fig. S4 and Table S2 (ESI†). Furthermore, through the studies of the light intensity dependence of VOC and the light intensity dependence of JSC, it is found that the bimolecular recombination in the ternary device is also reduced to a certain extent, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The above carrier transport features are consistent with the higher JSC and FF of a device under the same conditions.
Conclusion
In summary, we studied the PET and PHT processes in the PBDB-T:PC71BM:IT-M ternary OSCs, and found that the ternary strategy can improve the efficiency of the PHT process from IT-M to PBDB-T to a certain extent, as revealed by the IQE and absorption studies. The improved blend film phase morphology and material crystallization of the active layer in the optimal condition are presumed to be the main causes of the more balanced PET and PHT processes in the device. In addition, a lager ΔEc2 value that is conducive to the PHT process may also be formed due to the formation of the “acceptor alloys” in the device considering the fact that PC71BM and IT-M form “acceptor alloys”, as revealed by the quasi-linear relationship between the VOC and the composition ratio of the blend. However, more in-depth studies are still needed to provide more direct and convincing evidence to prove this new conclusion in the future. Nevertheless, our studies herein have verified the origin of the enhanced PHT process in the ternary OSCs and provide potential methods to improve the efficiency of the PET and PHT processes in the OSCs.
