    , Accepted 23rd February 2019First published on 25th February 2019AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials with exotic semiconducting properties have become inevitable candidates for next-generation electronic devices. Very recently, a low dimensional nanostructure of the perovskite materials has attracted the scientific community due to its enhanced performance in optoelectronics as compared to its bulk counterparts. Herein, a facile method was developed for the scalable, room-temperature synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) nano/microtubes by direct conversion of lead iodide (PbI2) microtubes through a solution-phase method. At first, the PbI2 microtubes were synthesized by the anti-solvent crystallization process and subsequently converted to CH3NH3PbI3 nano/microtubes by the addition of CH3NH3I (MAI) precursor directly in the solution phase. The corresponding photodetectors (PDs) in the lateral metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) configuration of the PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes on glass substrates were investigated systematically. Compared to the PbI2 based PDs (557 mA W−1, 3.65 × 1012 Jones, 0.251 s/0.252 s), the MAPbI3 based PDs exhibit higher photoresponsivity, specific detectivity, and faster response time (25 A W−1, 9.9 × 1013 Jones, 49 ms/20 ms) under irradiation with 4.6 μW cm−2 intensity light of the 532 nm laser at a bias of 5 V. The proposed method is a low-temperature process, easy to apply in large scale synthesis, and finds potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic/inorganic lead halide perovskites (CH3NH3X3, X = Cl, Br, I) with their exceptional optical and electrical properties have attracted considerable attention for their applications in next-generation optoelectronic devices.1,2 The exploration of a nanostructure fabrication strategy of lead halide perovskite materials has gained intense research interest in the recent decade due to their unique optical, electrical, and optoelectronic properties, apart from their bulk properties.3 In the beginning, polycrystalline perovskite thin film structures were used in solar cells, photodetectors, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).4,5 However, the introduction of many defects and trap sites is unavoidable in bulk thin film structures. Therefore, subsequently, researchers demonstrated the perovskite materials in the form of 0-D quantum dots, 1-D nanowires or nanorods, and 1-D and 2-D nanoplates.6–8 Compared to their bulk counterparts, nanometric scale perovskite structures showed better performance because of the quantum confinement effect, minimized defect sites, and flexibility in the construction of device geometry. As one of the low-dimensional materials, nanorods or nanowires have unique advantages as compared with other forms such as single crystalline nature, large surface to volume ratio, higher quantum efficiency, and longer diffusion length.9 For example, CH3NH3PbI3 nanowires have been used to construct high performance photodetectors, image sensors, and lasers.10–12 Till now, fabrications of MAPbI3 nanowires or nanorods were done via substrate-oriented growth and template-guided growth.10,13 However, the above methods are unfit for large-scale synthesis of nanowires or nanorods, which is essential for the production of industrial grade optoelectronic devices.
Meanwhile, another important class of nanostructures, which is rarely studied by researchers, is the inorganic nano/microtubes.14 Tube structured inorganic materials have been of very special interest since they offer contact access to inner and outer surfaces as well as to both ends, and they are attractive for developing functional electronic devices.15,16 It is generally believed that layered crystal structures are necessary for the formation of tube-like structures, which limits the research progress and subsequent potential applications in devices.17 Various methods were developed for the fabrication of tube-like structures in layered inorganic materials such as MoS2, WS2, and GaS.18–21 As an important precursor for lead-halide perovskites, lead(II) iodide (PbI2) is a direct band gap semiconducting material with a hexagonally close-packed layer of lead ion sandwiched between two layers of iodide ions with unit cell dimensions of a = 4.557 Å and c = 6.979 Å. For the layered PbI2, strong covalent bonding exists in plane but weak van der Waal's interactions dominate between the adjacent layers, which facilitate the formation of 1-D nanostructures and 2-D layers.22 Up to now, mostly PbI2 was utilized in devices in the form of bulk crystals, 2-D layers, and 2-D flakes.22 Additionally, flexible devices based on PbI2 nanowires and nanosheets have been reported.23,24 To our knowledge, the detailed study on tubular structured PbI2 and MAPbI3 was not reported till now.
Herein, for the first time, we present a simple and versatile method to synthesize neat PbI2 and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes by utilizing the anti-solvent crystallization (ASC) method. This work provides a simple, template-free, controllable, and facile strategy to fabricate perovskite based tubular structures. Our experimental data showed that the networks of PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes are capable of harvesting visible light and show robust photocurrent generation. The unique structure allowed the fabrication of a high performance photodetector with lower dark current, high photocurrent, and fast response time in the visible region.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2) with purity of 99.9985%, methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) with purity of ≥99.5%, and anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Alfa Aesar, while IPA were purchased from TG Chem, P.R. China.
2.2 Synthesis of PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes
In a typical synthesis, 0.22 M of PbI2 (0.5198 g) was dissolved in DMF (5 mL) and stirred for 15 min. Then, equal amount of IPA (5 mL) was added into the above precursor slowly under magnetic stirring. Within a few seconds, the solution became turbid and PbI2 microtubes were crystallized. The products were precipitated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min, rinsed with n-hexane several times, and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C.
The above synthesized PbI2 microtubes were re-dispersed in IPA. Afterwards, the stoichiometric amount of CH3NH3I was added into the suspension under magnetic stirring at room temperature. After stirring for 2 h, the products were centrifuged, washed with n-hexane and IPA several times, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C overnight.
2.3 Device fabrication
The PDs were constructed in the Au/PbI2 (or MAPbI3)/Au structure based on the PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes. Firstly, glass substrates were cleaned by ultra-sonication in ultra-pure water, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, and ethanol for 30 min each and dried in N2 flow. Au electrodes were thermally evaporated in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 4.5 × 10−4 Pa through a shadow mask defining the channel width and length of 88 μm and 973 μm, respectively, in the interdigitated pattern. The as-synthesized samples (PbI2 and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes) were drop-casted on the pre-patterned electrode carefully and dried naturally in ambient conditions.
2.4 Characterization
The XRD patterns of the samples were obtained using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were acquired by a ZEISS Sigma 500 field emission SEM operated at an accelerating voltage up to 30 kV. The morphologies of the samples were studied using HR-TEM JEM 2100 operated at 200 kV. The optical UV-absorption spectra were measured with a spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 750). Photoluminescence spectra of the samples deposited in glass substrates were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, F-4600). The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 4200-SCS unit. A laser diode with wavelength of 532 nm was used as the light source for the photodetector measurement, while the power of the incident radiation was tuned and measured with a power meter.
3. Results and discussion
The schematic of the synthetic strategy is shown in Fig. 1a and the photographic images of the as-synthesized PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes powdered samples are shown in Fig. S1.† The detailed synthetic procedure is provided in the Experimental section. Fig. 1b shows the typical X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) of PbI2. All the peaks can be readily indexed to the hexagonal PbI2 [space group: Pm1(164)], which is consistent with the standard of PbI2 (hematite, JCPDS file no. 07-0235). The high intensity and sharpness of the diffraction peaks confirm the good crystalline nature of PbI2 and extra peaks due to impurities were not seen. The XRD pattern displayed the diffraction peaks at 12.77°, 26.04°, 34.36°, 39.66°, 38.69°, 41.74°, 45.29°, 47.97°, and 53.32°, which correspond to the (001), (002), (102), (003), (110), (111), (103), (112), and (004) lattice planes of the 2H poly-type of PbI2 crystals, respectively, as seen in the spectrum.25 MAPbI3 was synthesized by simply adding the stoichiometric excess of CH3NH3I (MA) to the PbI2 dispersion in isopropanol (IPA) directly. After the addition of CH3NH3I (MA), the light yellow coloured PbI2 microtubes were turned to dark brown coloured products due to chemical transformation. The resulting products were collected by centrifugation and dried at 40 °C under vacuum for 24 h. Fig. 1e depicts the XRD pattern of MAPbI3, indicating the well crystalline nature. The predominant strong peaks observed in the MAPbI3 sample at 14.06°, 19.88°, 23.43°, 24.47°, 28.37°, 31.76°, 34.88°, 40.43°, and 43.09° correspond to the reflections of the (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (222), (312), (224), and (314) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure, respectively.26 We believe that the absence of low angle peaks confirmed the complete conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3.27

Fig. 1c and d reveal the typical field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of PbI2 synthesized in 15 min and Fig. S2† displays the optical microscopic images of the PbI2 synthesized in different time durations. As shown in Fig. 1c, PbI2 was crystallized into triangular microtubes with faceted geometry. The length of the tubes varied from 10 μm to several micrometers. It is clearly seen that the growth-rate of the microtube length is very slow and the effect of growth time is weak for the PbI2 microtubes, as shown in Fig. S3.† It is evident that the anisotropic crystallization of PbI2 microtubes occurred immediately after injecting IPA and further growth of the tubes was inhibited. The as-synthesized PbI2 microtubes possessed perfect triangular cross-section with face width of 700 nm and wall width of 100 nm, as shown in Fig. 1d. The statistical distribution of average diameter of the microtubes is given in the inset of Fig. 1c. However, with large fractions of microtubes, few microrods with triangular faceted geometry also appeared (see Fig. S4†). At the same time, Fig. 1f and g display the FE-SEM images of MAPbI3 at different magnifications, showing that the MAPbI3 nano/microtubes are really in large scale and, aggregated and conglutinated. It should be noted that we have not used any surfactant for the synthesis. The absence of surfactant led to the aggregation of the tubes. It is clearly seen that the tube ends were sealed after the reaction and we could not observe the open end in the SEM images. The nano/microtubes have a length of more than 10 μm with diameter of 200–700 nm. The diameter distribution of the MAPbI3 nano/microtube is presented in the inset of Fig. 1e. Also, the nano/microtubes showed a rough surface morphology, as indicated in Fig. 1g and its inset. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum was taken by dispersing the samples on SiO2/Si substrates, and it is shown in Fig. S5.† The elemental composition and distribution of the PbI2 microtubes were studied by the FESEM-EDX mapping analysis. From here, one can see that the Pb and I map shows a homogeneous elemental distribution. Fig. S6† reveals the Pb, I, and C mapping of the MAPbI3 nano/microtubes, which confirms the homogeneous distribution and stoichiometric presence of the corresponding elements. The Pb:I ratio of the as-synthesized PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes was found to be 2.72 and 3.03, respectively, which is consistent with their stoichiometric composition. The detailed growth mechanism of PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes will be discussed later.
Furthermore, structural analysis of PbI2 and MAPbI3 samples were carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HR-TEM). Fig. 2a–c show the TEM images of the as-synthesized PbI2, and one can see that they have a smooth surface morphology and hollow nature with several micrometers of length but possible breaking of the tubes occurred due to the ultrasonic sample preparation method employed for TEM analysis. This structural instability is commonly observed in perovskite nanostructures.12 Also, long exposure to the electron beam could damage the nanotubes, as indicated in Fig. S7.† The low-magnification TEM image of the MAPbI3 nano/microtubes is displayed in Fig. 2d, showing long, broken tubes and also, one can clearly see the whiskers-like small nanorods grown uniformly on the surface of the nanotubes (see the inset of Fig. 2d). The clear magnified TEM image of the MAPbI3 nanotubes in Fig. 2e confirms the formation of nanorods on the nanotubes. The diameter of the nanorods was found to vary from 40 nm to 60 nm and the length was ∼150 nm (see Fig. S8†). This significant feature of the nanotubes decorated with nanorod structures makes our experimental results very unique as compared with other previously reported perovskite based nanorods or nanowires.10,28,29

(e) High magnification TEM image of MAPbI3 microtubes showing clearly the rough surface morphology. 
In order to get a close insight into the formation of the PbI2 and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes, the HR-TEM study was carried out and the results are summarized in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows the triangular cross-section at one end. The inner tubular structure is not clearly observed due to the thickness of the nanotube under TEM characterization. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern was taken along the length of the PbI2 microtube at different locations from one face of the triangular geometry. To a large extent, the similarity of the diffraction spots indicated the single crystal nature of the microtubes along the growth direction (see Fig. 3a). By carefully analyzing the diffraction spots, it is clearly seen that the growth direction is the [001] crystallographic axis, labelled as “A” in Fig. 3a. While considering the electron diffraction pattern, as indicated in the area “A”, bright diffraction spots are observed and labelled as the [100] direction. Along with the bright spots, weak spots are also observed, as indicated by the arrows, and they represent the substructure. Unlike the ring pattern indicating the polycrystalline nature, well separated diffraction spots reveal an ordered orientation of the crystal planes along the nanotubes. Meanwhile, the SAED pattern of area “B” shows a perfect superstructure reflection. Such type of superstructure is commonly observed in layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and other alkali metal oxides.30,31 Because of twinning, this incommensurate superstructure occurs in most diffraction patterns in all three directions. As expected, one can observe clearly that the first- and second-order superstructure reflections are stronger and the higher-order ones are much weaker due to the thicker wall of the nanotube. Again, as indicated in area “C”, the diffraction pattern shows the well-ordered bright spots and successive superstructure reflection spots than the diffraction pattern in area “A”. The angle between the substructures are measured to be 30.32°, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3a (see the ED pattern in area “C”), which indicates the twinning of the crystal planes. In general, instability of PbI2 under high energy electron beam may hinder the precise HR-TEM observation of the lattice fringes. Fortunately, here we were able to observe the lattice planes with maximum accuracy. Fig. 3b depicts the HR-TEM image and it clearly shows the lattice fringes with d-spaces of the (110) and (004) planes of the hexagonal PbI2. Moreover, as expected, the superlattice-like structure is observed and the interlayer spacing is measured to be 6.9 Å, which is in good agreement with the (001) plane spacing of the hexagonal lattice.32 The twinning of the crystal planes is visualized clearly with the angle of 28.81°, which is in agreement with the ED pattern. Additionally, the clear HR-TEM image of the crystal plane substructure on the nanotube is depicted in Fig. S8.† It should be noted that the random orientation of the diffraction spots in the area “A” and area “C”, as compared to area “B”, are due to damage either by the electron beam or the processing of the nanotubes in solution phase. The schematic diagram of PbI2 microtubes and atomic model of PbI2 with layered structure viewed along the (110) plane is displayed in Fig. 3c. From the above experimental evidences, one can see that the observed triangular cross-sectional PbI2 microtubes have several unique features: (1) the shape and crystallographic facets are well defined; (2) the face of the microtubes has the single crystal nature along the whole length of the tube; (3) the PbI2 crystals may grow mainly along the hexagonal (001) surface due to the low surface energy attributed to the large planar density;24 (4) the twinning of the crystal planes occurred at a few regions; (5) the PbI2 microtubes are formed by layer-by-layer arrangement of the crystal planes.

(e) Atomic resolution HR-TEM image of area “B1”. (f) Schematic diagram of a MAPbI3 microtube and atomic model of MAPbI3 showing the layered structure along the (100) face. 

Fig. 3d illustrates the HR-TEM image of MAPbI3 nano/microtubes. Unlike the PbI2 microtubes, the tubular nature is evidently observed with a wall thickness of 72 nm and inner diameter of 54 nm. The SAED of the MAPbI3 samples was taken along the nanotube axis at different locations as indicated by area “A1”, “B1”, and “C1”. The electron diffraction shows the complex pattern with slightly deformed hexagonal symmetry. The similarity between the diffraction patterns suggests a perfect orientation of the crystal planes along the nanotube axis. Moreover, the ED pattern follows the trend of PbI2 microtube ED pattern. Fig. 3e shows a detailed crystalline phase of MAPbI3 at the interface between the outer wall and the inner space. From here, the interface is clearly seen and the inter-planar distance is 0.31 nm, which corresponds to (001) plane. As indicated, the nanotube wall contains the superlattice-like structure same as that of the PbI2 nanotube with interlayer of 7.0 Å, which corresponds to the interlayer distance between the successive crystal planes. The schematic diagram of the MAPbI3 nano/microtubes and atomic model of the MAPbI3 layered structure is shown in Fig. 3f.
Based on these experimental results, the possible nano/microtubes growth mechanism can be proposed as following: in general, the solvent can significantly affect the final structural morphology and drive the crystallization kinetics during the solution-processed nanostructure synthesis.33 The main role of the anti-solvent is to reduce the solubility of the solute and consequently to generate a supersaturated condition to accelerate the crystallization process. According to literature, the 1-D anisotropic morphology of inorganic materials could be achieved in solution by tuning the reaction time, temperature, and supersaturation condition. In our case, the reaction time and temperature do not have significant influence but the saturation condition plays a vital role. We believe that there are two causes attributed to the formation of the PbI2 microtubes: dislocation-driven crystal growth and nanoscale Kirkendall effect. It is postulated that the catalyst-free, template-free formation of the hollow tubes is a signature of the dislocation-driven crystal growth.12,34 Also, the nanoscale Kirkendall effect is another reason responsible for the formation of hollow nanostructures in the solution phase.35 Firstly, low supersaturation condition induced by IPA in the PbI2-DMF homogeneous solution enables the formation of PbI2via anisotropic crystal growth at the specified concentration of 0.22 M. The deviation from the specified concentration of 0.22 M leads to nanocrystals rather than anisotropic nanostructures.36 To support this fact, with a large fraction of microtubes, few faceted microrods were also observed in our sample (see Fig. S7†). Afterwards, the phenomenon of the Kirkendall effect plays the role in the hollow tube formation. The formation of the Kirkendall void is due to the non-reciprocal mutual ionic diffusion, i.e., unequal flow of core and shell materials generates a net inward vacancy diffusion, which leads to voids and eventually hollow structures.37 Here, under the supersaturation condition, Pb2+ and I− ions undergo an outward and inward diffusion, respectively. Since the outward diffusion coefficient of Pb2+ ions is higher than the inward diffusion coefficient of I− ions, vacancies or voids will be formed. As the reaction proceeds, more Pb2+ ions are diffused outwards and react with the I− ions at the interface and form the shell.35 Consequently, the generated vacancies condense together and form multiple voids, which become larger and larger as time proceeds. Finally, the voids condense together and give rise to hollow tubular structures.
Furthermore, the PbI2 microtubes are directly converted to CH3NH3PbI3 nano/microtubes by the direct reaction of CH3NH3I in IPA solution. After the addition of CH3NH3I to PbI2 microtubes, the colour of solution turns to brownish black colour within few seconds. Due to the hollow nature of the PbI2 microtubes, the complete chemical transformation occurred effectively, as indicated by XRD and HR-TEM. Interestingly, the 1-D morphology of PbI2 was preserved after the chemical transformation. But deformation from the triangular cross-section is evidently observed. This disparity in the morphology of the converted CH3NH3PbI3 is due to the dissolution-recrystallization process. After the chemical transformation, the release and dissolution of the organic components (CH3NH3+) in IPA leads to the formation of a rough surface morphology, which is clearly identified in the HR-TEM image.38 Also, the twinning of the crystal planes will act as the seed for the whisker-like nanorods’ growth, which is clearly observed in the HR-TEM image (see Fig. S8†). We believe that this synthetic strategy can be extended to other perovskite materials.
The optical band gap of the samples was determined using diffuse reflectance UV-Vis measurement, as shown in Fig. 4a. For the PbI2 samples, the diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) show absorption onset at 545 nm and low intensity absorption edge at 356 nm. The band gap energy calculated on the basis of the corresponding absorption edge is 2.27 eV.22 The MAPbI3 nano/microtubes yielded the typical absorption spectra spanning from ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR) region and strong absorption edges were observed at 799 nm and 484 nm, which are in agreement with earlier reports.39,40 Among these, the second absorption peak at 799 nm could be assigned to the direct band transition from the valence band maximum (VB1) to the conduction band minimum (CB1), which is equivalent to the band gap of 1.55 eV. However, the absorption peaks at 484 nm might have come from the transition from intermediate valence band maximum (VB2) to the conduction band minimum (CB1), which is nearer to 2.56 eV.39,41 The steady-state PL spectra were measured at the excitation wavelength of 320 nm and sharp photoluminescence emission was observed at 644 nm (see Fig. S10†). Fig. 4b shows the time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the MAPbI3 nano/microtubes with a PL peak of 645 nm. The PL decay spectra were fitted by the bi-exponential profile, which gives the PL life time with a fast decay of τ1 = 8 ± 1 ns and slow decay of τ2 = 105 ± 2 ns, associated with the surface and bulk recombination, respectively.42 The structural and optical characterization of the MAPbI3 nano/microtubes described above demonstrate the superior optical properties, which help to realize good optoelectronic devices.

As a proof of concept application, these as-synthesized PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes were used as the active layers in visible-light PDs. The current–voltage (I–V) measurements were carried out at ambient conditions to investigate the electrical properties of the fabricated PDs with metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) configuration of Au/PbI2 (or MAPbI3)/Au in dark and under illumination with a 532 nm laser diode. Fig. 4c displays the optical microscopic image of the PDs fabricated on the interdigitated Au electrodes by drop-casting the corresponding nano/microtube suspensions. The gap between the two electrodes was 89 μm and the length was 980 μm. It was found that the layer of the nano/microtube network was dispersed between the electrodes uniformly. This type of photodetector, especially employing the planar architecture, is widely investigated because they combine facile fabrication and high performance.43Fig. 4d and e illustrate the I–V curves of the device based on the PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes at radiations of different light intensity from 4.6 μW cm−2 to 205 μW cm−2. The linearity and symmetry of the I–V curve indicated the good ohmic contact between the active layer and the metal electrodes. One can clearly see that remarkable increase of photocurrent was observed upon light illumination both in the PbI2 microtube PDs and the MAPbI3 nano/microtube PDs. The difference in the photocurrent enhancement between PbI2 and MAPbI3 can be distinguishably seen. The time dependent photoresponsive behaviour of the PDs at different light intensities is summarized in Fig. 5. The measurements were performed under a bias of +5 V. One can see that the curves exhibit a prompt reproducible response to the light in ON/OFF cycles, indicating the good cyclic stability of the PDs. Also, the photocurrent increases sharply with increasing bias because of the increased drift carrier velocity (see Fig. S11†). As expected, the measured dark current for the PbI2 based device is 6.16 × 10−11 A, while the MAPbI3 based PD exhibits the lowest dark current of 1.69 × 10−10 A. Under illumination, a drastic increase of the photocurrent up to 9.04 × 10−9 A under 205 μW cm−2 irradiation was obtained for the PbI2 microtube PD and its ON/OFF ratio varies from 35 to 145 for 4.5 μW cm−2 to 205 μW cm−2, while for the MAPbI3 nano/microtube PDs, the ON/OFF ratio was 579 at 4.5 μW cm−2 and it reached 4750 at 205 μW cm−2. The speed of the photodetector is judged from its rising and falling response time. The rising time (from 10% to 90% of the photocurrent as light is switched from OFF to ON) and falling time (from 90% to 10% of the maximum photocurrent as the light is switched from ON to OFF) illustration for PbI2 and MAPbI3 PDs are shown in Fig. 5b and d, respectively. For the MAPbI3 PDs, the rising and falling time are estimated to be 49 ms and 20 ms, respectively. The photoresponse time of the MAPbI3 PDs is almost three orders of magnitude shorter than that of the CH3NH3PbBr3 porous nanorods reported previously (∼120 ms, 86 ms).38 On the other hand, for the PbI2 PDs, the rising and falling time were estimated to 251 ms and 252 ms, respectively, which are superior than those of the PVT-synthesized PbI2 nanowire PDs.44

(f) Illuminated light intensity-dependent photoresponsivity of the photodetectors under 532 nm illumination at a bias of +5 V. (g) Illuminated light intensity-dependent specific detectivity of the photodetectors under 532 nm illumination at a bias of +5 V. 
Furthermore, the PDs were characterized by plotting the light intensity-dependent photocurrent curves under 523 nm light illumination at +5 V bias, as shown in Fig. 5e. From here, one can see that the photocurrent increases with increasing illumination intensity from 4.6 μW cm−2 to 205 μW cm−2. The good linearity of the I–V curves indicates that the photocurrent is determined by the photogenerated carriers under illumination. Fitting the plotted curves by the power law Iph ∝ Pγ, and setting the γ value to 0.58 for MAPbI3 and 0.38 for PbI2, we can determine the response of the photocurrent to the light intensity. The non-unity exponent value suggests the complex process of photogenerated charge carrier recombination, existence of intrinsic defects and charge impurities of both PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes. Notably, the higher γ value for the MAPbI3 PD than that of the PbI2 PD reveals the reduction of the recombination centers in MAPbI3 as compared to PbI2. An important figure of merit for a photodetector is photoresponsivity (R), which can be defined by: R = Iph/PS(1)where Iph is the photocurrent under illumination, P is the incident power intensity, and S is the effective area of the device.45 Also, the specific detectivity (D*) is another critical figure of merit for a photodetector, which is defined by: (2)where R is the responsivity, A is the effective sensor area, q is the electronic charge, and Id is the dark current. Fig. 5f and g show the calculated R and D* of the photodetectors at different light intensities. For the PbI2 based PDs, R reduced from 557 mA W−1 to 51 mA W−1 with increasing light intensity from 4.6 μW cm−2 to 205 μW cm−2, while the responsivity decreased from 25 A W−1 to 4.6 A W−1 for the MAPbI3 based PDs. As expected, the MAPbI3 PDs exhibit superior R than that of the PbI2 PDs. Also, as shown in Fig. 5f, the behaviour of R to the light intensity is attributed to the trap states, and defects in the bulk or on the material surface. Under low intensity of illumination, the photo-generated electrons are mostly captured by the trap states and the electron–hole recombination is reduced.11
On the other hand, at high illumination intensity, relatively low ratio of the photo-generated electrons will be captured by the trap states. Therefore, the device was more sensitive to low incident light intensity.46,47
The plot of specific detectivity D* versus the light intensity follows the same trend as R, as shown in Fig. 5g. One can see that D* can reach up to 3.65 × 1012 Jones (@ 4.6 μW cm−2) from 3.38 × 1011 Jones (@ 205 μW cm−2) for the PbI2 microtubes PD. After converting to the MAPbI3 nano/microtubes, D* was increased to 9.9 × 1013 Jones (@ 4.6 μW cm−2) and 1.8 × 1013 Jones (@ 205 μW cm−2). From the above results, one can see that the MAPbI3 nano/microtubes based PDs show better device performance. Though the PbI2 microtubes PDs show relatively low performance due to the low light absorption above 500 nm (see absorption spectra in Fig. 4a) but it is comparable or superior than the reported results (see Table 1). The high R of the MAPbI3 nanotubes and PbI2 nanotubes based PDs may be attributed to the unique high surface area, high number of active sites for photo-generation, and fast carrier mobility towards the electrodes. The photodetector performances of our PDs are highly comparable to those of the state-of-the-art PbI2 and MAPbI3 based PDs as reported in the literature (Table 1).

4. Conclusion
In summary, for the first time, we have developed a facile method to synthesize the PbI2 microtubes by the simple solution-phase method at low temperature. Furthermore, the MAPbI3 nano/microtubes were formed through the solution conversion of the PbI2 microtubes. The structural characterization confirms that the growth of the PbI2 microtubes follows the screw dislocation-driven growth mechanism and the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. The as-synthesized PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes were used as the active materials in two-terminal PDs and achieved excellent photoresponse in the visible region. The high performance photodetector based on the MAPbI3 nano/microtubes demonstrated a high responsivity of 25 A W−1 at ultralow light intensity of 4.6 μW cm−2, response time of 49 ms/20 ms, and specific detectivity of 9.9 × 1013 Jones. The remarkable performance is attributed to the 1-D nano/microtubes with lesser degree of hierarchical nanorods, which provide high surface area, more active sites, and enhanced absorption of light. This study paves a new avenue for the synthesis and application of both PbI2 microtubes and MAPbI3 nano/microtubes. Also, we believe that the proposed strategy can be extended to other perovskite related materials to improve the performance of optoelectronic devices.
