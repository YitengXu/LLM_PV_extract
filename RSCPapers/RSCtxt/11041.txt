    , Accepted 19th November 2018First published on 20th November 2018AbstractThe self-assembly of arrays of metal ions with bridging ligands has evolved during the last twenty years as a powerful approach for the construction of cages and capsules with well-defined shapes and cavities. There has been of late an increasing exploration of photoactive supramolecular cages in which at least one component, either the metal ion or the ligands, themselves incorporating metal complexes (metalloligands), are phosphorescent. Desirable photophysical properties such as emission tuning and encapsulation-assisted energy and electron transfer have been achieved by integrating phosphorescent d-block Ir(III) and Ru(II) complexes into the backbone of metallosupramolecular cages and capsules. Such cages have been used in sensing applications, photocatalysis and in the context of solar fuels production. This feature article summarises the recent work on cage assemblies containing Ir(III) and Ru(II) metal complexes as photoactive units, highlighting our contribution to this growing field and bringing together our key results.

Introduction
Coordination cages and capsules, formed through the self-assembly of arrays of metal ions and bridging ligands, have been one of the main areas of interest in supramolecular chemistry over the last two decades.1 Coordination-driven self-assembly, which is based on metal–ligand coordination chemistry, has rapidly matured as a powerful approach for the construction of discrete two-dimensional (2-D) metallocycles and three-dimensional (3-D) metallocages and capsules with well-defined shapes, geometries and cavities.2 In this context, the groups of Lehn,3 Stang,4 Fujita,5 Raymond,6 Newkome,7 Nitschke8 and others9 have successfully pioneered a number of methodologies to construct numerous topologically trivial metallosupramolecular architectures. They have shown that the relatively strong and highly directional metal–ligands bonds can program the coordination-driven self-assembly process towards defined shapes and topologies of the resultant structures, frequently in high yields and short reaction times. The self-assembly between palladium(II) or platinum(II) metal ions and ligands containing specifically positioned distal pyridine moieties, first demonstrated by Fujita and co-workers,10 is one of the most popular and successful strategies to prepare molecular cages and capsules.1c,8,11 The first example of a coordination-driven molecular cage was a small [M6L4]12+ tetrahedron, where M is either a Pd(II) or Pt(II) metal ion located at each vertex of the tetrahedron and L is a bridging ligand, specifically the electron-poor 2,4,6-tris(pyridin-4-yl-1,3,5-triazine), spanning each of the six edges.10,12 More recently, by assembling bis-pyridyl bridging ligands characterized by extended curvatures with Pd2+ ions, large [Pd12L24]24+,13 [Pd24L48]48+,5 and huge [Pd30L60]60+ “nanospheres”14 have been rationally designed (Fig. 1). Such cages represent a fascinating synthetic challenge as they illustrate how, with careful control of the bridging ligand geometry and the type of metal ion, remarkably elaborate and highly symmetric structures can be successfully formed using self-assembly.1a,c,8,11f

As the field of coordination cage assembly has matured, the focus has more recently shifted increasingly towards the design of cages with defined function and the investigation of their properties.1d,11f,15 Small guest molecules have been shown to be selectively sequestrated inside the cavities of these cages and their host–guest interactions have been exploited in diverse applications such as “artificial enzyme” catalysis,16 for hazardous chemical capture and reactive intermediate stabilization,17 for drug delivery and release,18 as well as in molecular sensing19 and biology.20 The functional properties of these cages are frequently derived from the incorporation of functional groups into the organic building blocks.21 For example, Stang and co-workers have successfully introduced various functional moieties, such as ferrocene,22 crown-ethers23 and dendrons24 at the vertex of building blocks, which enabled the construction of a series of functional metallomacrocycles. Lutzen and co-workers introduced 2,2′-dihydroxy-1,1′-binaphthyl (BINOL) as chiral units into molecular cages of composition [Pd4L8]8+, [Pd6L12]12+ and [Pd12L24]24+.25 Yoshizawa and co-workers introduced electro- and magneto-chemical dihydrophenazine derivatives that can form stable radical cations by single-electron oxidation under ambient conditions into cage compounds of the composition of [Pd2L4]4+.26 Clever and co-workers27 have reported a series of [Pd2L4]4+ coordination cages, but featuring endohedral functionalities consisting of two electron-withdrawing substituents (CO2R and/or CN) attached to an electron-rich backbone via a double bond that behave as push–pull molecular rotors. Lutzen, Clever and co-workers28 have also recently reported a [Pd6L12]12+ cage containing a luminescent BODIPY-based bis(3-pyridyl) ligand that possesses a rotaxane-like cage-in-ring arrangement.
A recent area of considerable interest is the design and development of photoactive cages and capsules in which either the metal ion or the bridging ligand is luminescent.21a,29 Such cages provide both a high concentration of chromophores and defined cavities to govern the host–guest optoelectronic interactions. This immediately opens the door to many possible applications such as sensing and photocatalysis involving bound guests that can photophysically interact with the emitting hosts. Indeed, incorporation of fluorescent emitters such as porphyrins and BODIPYs,19a,30 π-conjugated organic compounds,31 and more recently thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters (TADF)32 into the ligand backbone of cages and macrocycles have been shown to give rise to luminescent cages and macrocycles.29b,30c,33 Less studied are supramolecular cages incorporating d-block transition metal complexes such as ruthenium(II), iridium(III), platinum(II), rhenium(I), gold(I), silver(I), rhodium(III) and osmium(II) complexes. Of these metals, the majority of recent interest has focused on the investigation of photoactive supramolecular cages incorporating luminescent Ir(III) and Ru(II) metal complexes. The resulting cages have been shown to possess a highly desirable set of optoelectronic and physical properties including wide color tunability, relatively high photoluminescence quantum yields (ΦPL) with short phosphorescence lifetime (τPL) and high chemical stability. They have been primarily used as sensors and as supramolecular photocatalysts for cavity-directed chemical transformations of bound guests and for hydrogen production. This feature article provides a summary of the development of these increasingly popular supramolecular cages based on Ru(II) and Ir(III) phosphorescent complexes, giving special emphasis to their photophysical properties and their potential in downstream applications. We highlight our contribution to this research area, bringing together our key results while discussing relevant work from other research groups.
Cages based on d-block ruthenium(II) and iridium(III) transition metal complexes
Ruthenium(II) cages
Ruthenium(II) polypyridine complexes have enjoyed a rich history in photocatalysis and as redox-active materials.34 The use of Ru(II) complexes in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC),35 water splitting,34b,36 biological labelling37 and as anticancer agents38 is also prominent. However, Ru(II) complexes are generally poorly emissive, their emission energies fall within a narrow range and thus their use as luminophores is limited.39 Many examples have nevertheless been reported where ruthenium(II) complexes have been incorporated into polymers,40 metal–organic frameworks41 and discrete 2-D metallamacrocycles.42 Recently, examples of 3-D supramolecular cages incorporating Ru(II) complexes as structural components or as metalloligand scaffolds have also been reported. These cage structures are summarized below.
Cook and co-workers43 recently reported Ru4L6-type truncated octahedron, RuC1, by assembling the tpt ligand 1 with cis-bis(2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (Fig. 2).

The photophysical properties of RuC1 were investigated in MeCN both at room temperature and at 77 K. Cage RuC1 exhibited a broad emission centred at λPL = 577 nm at room temperature, with a very low ΦPL < 0.1% and bi-exponential excited state lifetime of τPL of 2, 790 ns, where the 790 ns component contributes roughly less than 10% to the τPL of RuC1. This emission was red-shifted and strongly quenched compared to the room temperature emission of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 (λPL = 613 nm, ΦPL = 5%, τPL = 821 ns).43 Surprisingly, the 77 K emission of RuC1 was also red-shifted at λPL = 689 nm compared to the emission observed at room temperature. Although population of the 3ML(bpyπ*)CT state was the origin of the room temperature emission of RuC1, thermal population of this higher energy excited state no longer occurs at 77 K. Instead, the lower energy 3ML(TPTπ*)CT was predominantly populated and accounted for the red-shifted emission observed for RuC1 at 77 K. The electrochemical properties of RuC1 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry in MeCN. Multiple oxidation waves, corresponding to multiple RuII/III redox couples were observed, with the first occurring at Eox = 0.56 V (versus Ag/AgNO3), which was significantly cathodically shifted compared to the same redox couple in [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 at 1.05 V.43 The remaining oxidation waves of RuC1 ranged from Eox = 0.61 V to 1.08 V. RuC1 exhibited a single reduction wave at Ered = −1.29 V corresponding to the reduction of the bpy ligand, which was anodically shifted compared to the reduction of bpy in [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 at −1.64 V. This anodic shift is ostensibly a function of the presence of the electron-poor tpt ligand, which contributes to a reduction of the electron density on the Ru centre. Cage RuC1 is therefore both a more powerful photoreductant (Eox* = −1.59 V vs. −0.97 V) and a more powerful photooxidant (Ered* = 0.86 V vs. 0.38 V) than [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2. Stern–Volmer quenching studies were performed to probe the efficiency of RuC1 as a photoreductant using cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate as the quencher. However, identical bimolecular rate constants (kq) of 1.2 × 108 s−1 were calculated for the electron transfer from both RuC1 and [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 donors to the cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate acceptor, an indication that the same percentage of effective quenching collisions exists for both chromophores in the presence of cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate.
A highly symmetric Ru terpyridine-based spherical cage, RuC2, was synthetized by Newkome and co-workers45via the coordination of four tridentate ligands 2 and six Ru2+ ions (Fig. 3).

The geometry of the energy-minimised structure of RuC2 (Fig. 3) revealed a highly symmetric spherical structure in which the centres of four tridentate ligands 2 form a tetrahedron, and the six Ru2+ ions form a regular octahedron of Td symmetry. The longest distance between two Ru2+ centres is 3.2 nm and the inner volume is approximately 4000 Å3. The nanostructure of RuC2 was probed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) upon deposition on carbon-coated grids. The size of the nanostructure was found to be ca. 4.1 nm and matched with the diameter obtained for the optimized molecular model of the cage. The emission properties of cage RuC2 were not investigated.
So far, we have discussed two ruthenium metallocages where the Ru(II) complexes are used as metallic tectons within the supramolecular assembly. However, Ru metalloligands or ligand scaffolds appended with ruthenium complexes have also been used to prepare photophysically- and redox-active supramolecular cages.
A nanosized Pd–Ru heteronuclear metal–organic cage was reported by Su and co-workers.46 As illustrated in Fig. 4a, the combination of the spatially triangular C3-symmetric racemic metalloligand rac-Ru1, bearing three terminal 3-pyridine units, with coplanar spatially square D4-symmetric naked Pd(II) ions gave rise to the formation of a [Pd6(rac-Ru1)8]28+ cage, rac-RuC3, mediated by N(pyridine)–Pd coordination. Single crystals of rac-RuC3 were obtained by co-crystallizing rac-RuC3 with the heavy coordinating molecule [Ir(ppy)2(dc-bpy)](NO3), Ira (ppy is 2-phenylpyridinato, dc-bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid), yielding red crystals of the composition of [rac-RuC3(Ira)4](NO3)24, with the Ira molecules situated outside the structure of cage rac-RuC3. rac-RuC3 possesses a truncated-octahedral geometry with eight rac-Ru1 metalloligands occupying the eight faces of the cage, six PdN4 planes truncating the six vertices of the octahedron, and twelve rhombic windows alongside each octahedral edge (Fig. 4a). The dimensions of the cage are 3.1 × 3.4 × 3.4 nm3, where the six Pd vertices are separated by approximately 29 Å and a large cavity of 5350 Å3 exists. Cage rac-RuC3 was capable of encapsulating neutral non-polar aromatic compounds such as phenanthrene, pyrene and anthracene in a 1:1 mixture of DMSO-d6/D2O as a function of the hydrophobic character of its cavity. Molecular dynamic simulations of rac-RuC3⊃phenanthrene revealed that a maximum of seven phenanthrene molecules could reside within the cavity of the cage while an additional seventeen phenanthrene molecules could be accommodated in the “doorway” of twelve cage windows, allowing as many as twenty-four phenanthrene guests to be trapped (Fig. 4b). In addition, rac-RuC3 also exhibited the ability to encapsulate and protect against UV-light radiation three common light-curing agents widely used in inks and paints: 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA), 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (HCPK) and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (HMPP). While these free molecules photodecomposed upon irradiation at 365 nm for 12 h, no photolysis of the guest molecules was observed after photoirradiation at 365 nm of rac-RuC3⊃DMPA, rac-RuC3⊃HCPK and rac-RuC3⊃HMPP for 120 h.

Enantiopure metalloligands Λ- and Δ-Ru1 were also prepared in three steps following chiral resolution of rac-[Ru(phen)3]2+ with K2[Sb2[(+)-tartrate]2]·3H2O, oxidation of Λ- and Δ-[Ru(phen)3]2+ to yield Λ- and Δ-[Ru(phendione)3]2+, which were finally reacted with 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde in the presence of ammonium acetate in acetic acid.47 When Λ- and Δ-Ru1 were reacted with Pd2+ ions, enantiopure cages of composition Λ8- and Δ8-RuC3 were, respectively, obtained. The enantiopurity and absolute configuration of metalloligands Λ-, Δ-Ru1 and metallocages Λ-, Δ-RuC3 were, respectively, confirmed by CD spectroscopy and established by X-ray single crystal analyses. The single crystals of Λ- and Δ-RuC3 were grown from their MeCN solutions in the presence of R-BINOL and S-BINOL, respectively. Both Λ- and Δ-RuC3 crystallized in the chiral space group I422 (D4 symmetry) (Fig. 5a). In Δ-RuC3, eight Δ-Ru1 metalloligands are assembled with six Pd2+ ions to form [Pd6(Ru1)8]28+ with Ru1 in the ΔΔΔΔΔΔΔΔ homochiral configuration, and eight S-BINOL molecules captured in the cage window pockets. Similarly, Λ-RuC3 integrated eight Ru1 metalloligands with the ΛΛΛΛΛΛΛΛ homochiral configuration and co-crystallised with eight R-BINOL molecules likewise assembled in the cage window pockets. The stereoselective inclusion of chiral molecules of C2 symmetry such as BINOL, 3-bromo-BINOL, 6-bromo-BINOL and 1,1′-spirobiindane-7,7′-diol, and chiral molecules characterised by a chiral carbon centre such as Naproxen, 1-(1-naphtyl)ethanol and benzoin into the cavity of cages Λ- and Δ-RuC3 were examined by 1H NMR enantiodifferentiation experiments in a 1:5 mixture of DMSO-d6:D2O at 298 K. Homochiral cages Λ- and Δ-RuC3 exhibited poor stereoselectivity towards the chiral compounds Naproxen, 1-(1-naphtyl)ethanol and benzoin (encapsulating R- and S-enantiomers with a ratio of ca. 50:50). However, through the same separation process, a pair R- and S-BINOL atropisomers were successfully resolved, with the ee values reaching approximately 34% and 36%, respectively, with Δ-RuC3 (encapsulating R-/S-BINOL with a ratio of 67/33) and Λ-RuC3 (encapsulating R-/S-BINOL with a ratio of 32/68). Relatively low enantioseparation results were obtained for R- and S-(3-bromo-BINOL) with an ee value of approximately 8%. The chiral resolution was greatly improved for the chiral discrimination of R- and S-(6-bromo-BINOL) enantiomers. Indeed, by using Δ-RuC3 the resolved product contained 77% of the R-isomer and 23% of the S-isomer, giving an ee of approximately 54%, while an ee of 62% for the S-isomer was obtained by using Λ-RuC3. Similarly, Δ-RuC3 showed preferable stereoselectivity towards R-(1,1′-spirobiindane-7,7′-diol) with an ee value of approximately 34%, while Λ-RuC3 incorporated primarily the S-isomer with an ee value of 44%. In general, Δ-RuC3 showed a preferable selectivity towards the encapsulation of the R-isomers, while Λ-RuC3 preferred the encapsulation of the S-isomer for all chiral guests of C2 symmetry.

In a subsequent work the same group reported the use of the cage rac-RuC3 as a molecular flask to promote cavity-directed photodimerization of 2-naphthol and 3-bromo-2-naphthol, forming racemic mixtures of S- and R-[4-(2-hydroxy-1-naphtyl)-1,2-naphthoquinone] and of its 3-bromo derivative (Fig. 5b).48 Importantly, when the photodimerization reaction of 3-bromo-2-naphthol was conducted in the cavity of the enantiopure cages Λ-, and Δ-RuC3 (5 mol% loading of cage), an enantiomeric excess of 58% ee (product R/S ratio: 79/21) and 54% ee (product R/S ratio: 23/77) was, respectively, obtained, albeit in low isolated yields of 9%. Although examples of self-assembled cages as molecular flasks to induce photochemical transformations of encapsulated guests have been previously reported,16a with relevant examples involving [2+2] photodimerization of olefins,49 [2+2] cross-photodimerization,16d,50 cyclisation of α-diketones,51 and photochemical oxidations of alkanes and alkynes,52 this work showed for the first time that chiral photoactive cages can be used to efficiently promote regio- and enantioselective photo-transformations of bound guests.
During the last decade, research into solar fuels has greatly accelerated, mostly in the area photocatalytic water splitting to generate cleanly hydrogen gas.34b Remarkable progress has been made since the development of intramolecular photochemical molecular devices (PMDs) by integrating chromophoric photosensitizers, catalytic centers and electron relay components into a single photocatalyst.53 For example, many photoactive multimetallic PMDs36a have been developed as photocatalysts for hydrogen production including: trinuclear Ru–Pt2;54 Ru–Pt2;55 and Ru–Rh–Ru;56 or tetranuclear Ru2–Ru–Pt;57 and Ru–Pt355 complexes. The best examples of these have achieved up to 870 turn-over numbers (TON) after 46 h.56 Cage rac-RuC3 is a highly organized structure that is composed of eight Ru2+ photocenters connected to six catalytically active Pd2+ centers through a phenanthroline (phen) bridging ligand and a benzimidazole-pyridine (biim-py) peripheral unit. Importantly, this system mimics the composition of PMDs (Fig. 6).58

The metalloligand rac-Ru1 and cage rac-RuC3 showed similar emission spectra with maxima at ca. 610 nm, which correspond for both rac-Ru1 and rac-RuC3 to the emission from Ru(phen)3-centred triplet 3MLCT states. However, compared to that of rac-Ru1, the emission intensity of rac-RuC3 was reduced by ca. 32% due to intramolecular charge transfer from Ru(phen)3 to the Pd(pyridine)4 moieties. Both DFT calculations and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy were employed to elucidate the electronic structure of rac-RuC3. The photoexcitation of the [Ru(phen)3]2+ chromophore at 400 nm populates the 1MLCT state, which is rapidly followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) to populate the 3MLCT state involving the phenanthroline. The subsequent excited state relaxation occurs via an intraligand charge transfer (ILCT) process from phen to biim-py, and finally, a much slower process of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) takes place from biim-py to the Pd catalytic center (Fig. 6). The photocatalytic hydrogen production exhibited by cage rac-RuC3 in a closed gas circulation and evacuation system upon irradiation with visible light (λexc > 420 nm) was found to be efficient. Indeed, under optimised conditions (100 mL DMSO solution with 22 μM rac-RuC3, 0.34 M H2O and 0.75 M triethanolamine), the reaction rate for H2 production was found to be 380 μmol h−1 with a turnover number of 635 after 48 h. The efficiency of H2 production by using rac-RuC3 as a photocatalyst is comparable to those observed for H2 production with photoactive multimetallic PMDs.36a
Beves and co-workers59 designed the Ru(II) complexes Ru2 and Ru3 featuring a [Ru(tpy)2]2+ core (tpy is 2,2′,6′,2′′-terpyridine) decorated at the 4′-position with a 3,5-disubstituted benzene containing 4-pyridyl groups capable of coordinating to square-planar Pd metal centres (Fig. 7). Reaction of Ru2 with two equivalents of [Pd(dppp)](OTf)2 (dppp is 1,3-diphenylphosphinopropane) in nitromethane at room temperature immediately afforded a single major species in solution, the composition and purity of which were ascertained to be [(Pd(dppp))8(Ru2)4](PF6)24 (RuC4 in Fig. 7a) by ESI-mass spectrometry and 1H- and 31P-NMR spectroscopy. The analogous reaction of complex Ru3, which features alkyne spacers between the phenyl and pendant pyridyl rings, and [Pd(dppp)](OTf)2 gave rise to a trimeric, rather than a tetrameric structure as observed for the assembly of Ru2, of the composition of [(Pd(dppp))6(Ru3)3](PF6)18 (RuC5 in Fig. 7b). The simulated structure of RuC5 is illustrated in Fig. 7b. RuC4 crystallized in the P space group and exhibits a box-like structure of dimensions of ca. 21 × 21 × 32 Å, with Pd(II) centers located at each end of the box forming almost perfect squares (Pd–Pd–Pd angles of 86.0°–92.8° and Pd⋯Pd distances of 13.2–13.4 Å). The center of the cage is occupied by [Ru(tpy)2] units with alternating Ru⋯Ru distances of 11.82 Å and 8.78 Å. Preliminary investigation of the photophysical properties of RuC5 and RuC6 revealed that their emissions are similar to those of the corresponding metalloligands Ru2 and Ru3. All the species exhibited weak emissions at λPL = 640 nm from 3MLCT states centered on the [Ru(tpy)2] chromophores with very short mono-exponential excited state lifetimes of 1.59 ns, 2.04 ns, 1.95 ns and 2.53 ns, respectively, for Ru2, RuC4, Ru3 and RuC5. The photophysical properties of Ru2, RuC4, Ru3 and RuC5 are also comparable to those previously reported for the related [Ru(4′-tolyl-tpy)(bis-tpy)]2+ complex (tolyl-tpy is 4′-(p-tolyl)-2,2′;6′,2′′-terpyridine), bis-tpy is 1,4-di-[(2,2′;6′,2′′-terpyridin)-4′-yl]benzene.60

More recently, the same group synthetized four dinuclear ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes appended with terminal 3- and 4-pyridyl groups.61 However, among this series of complexes only the reaction between the dimeric complex Ru4 (Fig. 8) and [Pd(NCMe4)](BF4)2 (0.6 equiv.) in MeCN-d3 gave an identifiable clean product, RuC6, rather than polymeric structures as observed for the other three complexes. The composition of the assembled structure RuC6 was identified by ESI-mass spectrometry as [Pd2(Ru4)4]20+. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the simulated geometry of RuC6 resembles a cage-like structure with a distance between the Ru(II) centres within the same dinuclear metalloligand of approximately 13 Å. The size of the simulated structure of RuC6 is in good agreement with the measured diffusion data obtained by 1H DOSY NMR spectroscopy (hydrodynamic radius, rs = 2 nm). RuC6 was, however, noted to not be emissive.

Our group has recently reported a phosphorescent cage of the form of [Pd4Ru8]24+, RuC7, which was formed by assembling the metalloligand [Ru(dtbubpy)2(qpy)]2+, Ru5, where qpy is 4,4′:2′,2′′:4′′,4′′′-quaterpyridine and dtbubpy is 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine, with Pd2+ ions (Fig. 9a).62 X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that cage RuC7 is constructed such that two Ru5 ligands doubly bridge adjacent Pd(II) centres in a crown-like fashion disposing the four palladium ions in a square arrangement. RuC7 has a diagonal distance of 38.4 Å and an internal volume of 4900 Å3 which makes it the largest X-ray structure reported to date of a Ru(II) cage assembled with Pd2+ ions.

The near-infrared emission exhibited by RuC7 in DCM (λPL = 710 nm) is broader and red-shifted compared to that of Ru5 (λPL = 674 nm, ΦPL = 7.3%), and with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 6.9% (Fig. 9b). Notably, the ΦPL of RuC7 is one of the highest reported among ruthenium cages and it is remarkably high considering its emission at 710 nm. The red-shifted emission of RuC7 compared to Ru5 is the result of the coordination of the Lewis acidic Pd(II) ions to the ruthenium complex, which essentially stabilises the π*qpy orbital levels involved in the emission, and thus lowers the energy of the triplet state. Both RuC7 and Ru5 exhibit bi-exponential photoluminescence decay kinetics with τPL of 324, 1047 ns and 151, 700 ns, respectively (Fig. 9b). As a result, similar radiative rate constants, kr, of 6.97 × 104 s−1 and 9.86 × 104 s−1, and non-radiative rate constants, knr, of 8.85 × 105 s−1 and 13.30 × 105 s−1 are obtained for RuC7 and Ru5, respectively. Thus, the Pd(II) ions in RuC7 do not adversely affect the photophysical properties of Ru5. This observation is rather unusual considering that the emissions of the vast majority of metal complexes assembled within cage structures, including those of RuC3, RuC4, RuC5 and RuC6, are often partially or fully quenched by the presence of Pd(II) ions due to the population of low-lying dark states involving the donor and Pd(II) acceptor units. The fact that, in this specific case, the photoluminescence of Ru5 is not quenched in the cage indicates that the radiative process in RuC7 is sufficiently fast to compete with internal conversion to the lower-lying dark states.
Beves, Moore and co-workers63 have recently designed linear Ru(II) metalloligands that contain a central photoactive [Ru(phen)2(bpy)]2+ structure with the bpy unit functionalized at the 5 and 5′ positions with peripheral metal binding sites such as 2,2′-bipyridine (in Ru6) or picolinaldehyde (in Ru7), Fig. 10. When metalloligand Ru6 was self-assembled with Fe(II) ions, the tetrahedral cage RuC8 was formed (Fig. 10a), while the condensation reaction between Ru7 and the capping ligand tris(2-aminoethyl)amine in the presence of Zn(II) ions gave rise to the tetrahedral cage RuC9 (Fig. 10b). In MeCN, cages RuC8 and RuC9 exhibited weak emissions at 640 nm and 660 nm, respectively, which were at the same energy as those of their respective parent metalloligands Ru6 and Ru7. Unfortunately, the ΦPL and τPL values of the complexes were not reported.

Metallosupramolecular 3D assemblies of heterodimetallic Zn4(Ru8)2 (RuC10), and heterotrimetallic Fe2Zn2(Ru8)2 (RuC11) were recently reported by Newkome, Wang and co-workers (Fig. 11).64 As illustrated in Fig. 11a, RuC10 was prepared by assembling the ruthenium metalloligand Ru8 (1 equiv.), possessing four uncomplexed terpyridine units, with Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (2 equiv.). When Ru8 was treated with one equivalent of FeCl2·4H2O, it spontaneously generated the dimeric stable intermediate Ru9 (Fig. 11b), which was then reacted with one equivalent of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O to obtain the trimetallic RuC11 supramolecule. There is, however, no comment on the photophysical properties of these assemblies despite the presence of photoactive but poorly emissive bis(terpyridyl) Ru metalloligands.

Ward and co-workers65 reported a heterometallic cage of composition [Ru4Cd4L12](ClO4)16, RuC12, Fig. 12, (L is the pyrazolyl–pyridine ligand shown in Fig. 12) by reacting the metalloligand [RuL3](PF6)2, Ru10, with Cd(ClO4)2. Both Ru10 and RuC12 exhibited a single reversible Ru2+/Ru3+ oxidation wave respectively at +0.85 V and +0.96 V. The presence of the Cd ions in RuC12 partially removes electron density from the Ru(II) centres and therefore the oxidation of RuC12 resulted shifted at a higher potential when compared to that of Ru9. The emission properties of Ru10 and RuC12 were not discussed.

As exemplified by cages RuC3, RuC4, RuC5 and RuC6, the emissions of Ru metalloligands often are partially or completely quenched when the Ru complexes are situated in a close proximity to Pd2+ ions, which is due to the formation of non-emissive charge-transfer states involving the ruthenium and the palladium centres. This problem can be avoided by electronically isolating the emissive Ru(II) metal complexes from the Pd(II) metal ions. In this context, there have been reports of functionalized cages generated from ligands appended at their exohedral66 or endohedral67 faces with photoactive complexes. Additionally, there have been only a few examples reported wherein the photoactive complex is installed via post-synthetic modification of the inert metallo-supramolecular species.68
Crowley, Gordon and co-workers recently reported [Pd2L4]4+ metallo-supramolecular cages constructed from a tripyridyl-1,2,3-triazole backbone exo-functionalized with Ru(II) complexes.67b In particular, they used copper(I)-catalysed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) “click” reactions66c to append the chromophoric moieties [Ru(bpy)2(az-py)](PF6)2, Ru11, and [Ru(bpy)2(az-bpy)](PF6)2, Ru12, (bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine, az-py is 3-(1-methyl-1H-1,2,3-trazol-4-yl)pyridine and az-bpy is 5-(1-methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine) to the concave bipyridine ligand scaffold used to form the exo-functionalized Pd2L4 cages (Fig. 13).

Cages RuC13 and RuC14 were prepared in good yield (>70%) by simply stirring metalloligands Ru11 and Ru12 with [Pd(NCMe)4](BF4)2 in MeCN (Fig. 13). In degassed DMF at room temperature RuC13 and RuC14 exhibited ruthenium-based 3MLCT emissions centred, respectively, at 620 nm and 638 nm, with ΦPL of 0.2% and 2.6% and τPL of 20 ns and 659 ns, respectively. The ruthenium complexes Ru11 and Ru12 exhibited identical emission maxima compared to the corresponding metallocages RuC13 and RuC14 and similar ΦPL of 0.2% and 6.5% and τPL of 21 ns and 943 ns, respectively. These results indicate that the Pd2L4 cage and the ruthenium chromophores in RuC13 and RuC14 are electronically isolated. Electrochemical investigation also revealed minimal perturbation of the ground state redox properties of the Ru chromophores Ru11 and Ru12 when incorporated into RuC13 and RuC14. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements carried out in degassed DMF evidenced four consecutive quasi-reversible reduction processes for both Ru11 and Ru12. The electrochemistry of Ru11 closely resembled that of the structurally similar [Ru(bpy)2(pytri-Bn)]2+ complex69 (pytri-Bn is 2-(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridine), with the first two reduction processes at Ered = −1.28 V and Ered = −1.36 V associated with the bpy ligands and the remaining two reductions at Ered = −1.64 V and Ered = −1.80 localized on the pytri-Bn ligand. Similarly, the first three reductions of Ru11 at Ered = −1.17 V, Ered = −1.39 V and Ered = −1.65 V were assigned the reductions of the bpy ligands and matched with the potentials for the reductions of bpy in [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 in DMF.69 The forth reduction process of Ru12 at Ered = −1.80 V was attributed to the reduction of the bis-triazole ligand.70 For both Ru11 and Ru12 a chemically reversible RuII/III oxidation was observed at Eox1/2 = 1.31 V and Eox1/2 = 1.32 V, respectively. The electrochemical behavior of RuC13 and RuC14 mirror those of the respective complexes Ru11 and Ru12 (For RuC13: Ered = −1.27 V, 1.36 V, 1.64 V and 1.80 V; Eox1/2 = 1.33 V; For RuC14: Ered = −1.18 V, 1.40 V, 1.69 V and 1.80 V; Eox1/2 = 1.31 V). DFT calculations and Raman spectroscopy further confirmed minimal electronic communication between the Pd2L4 cage unit and the exo-appended Ru(II) chromophores. As a result, the exo-functionalization of metallo-supramolecular cages opens the possibility of aggregating photophysically and redox active moieties, via cage assembly, without compromising their photophysical properties.
Casini, Kuhn and co-workers71 also reported Pd2L4 cages exo-functionalized with Ru(II) pyridine complexes via coordination-driven self-assembly. They coupled two Ru(II) complexes of the composition of [Ru(tpy)(tpy-4-CO2H)](PF6)2 and [Ru(bpy)2(bpy-alk-CO2H)](PF6)2 (tpy is 2,2′;6′,2′′-terpyridine; tpy-4-CO2H is 2,2′;6′,2′′-terpyridine-4′-carboxylic acid and bpy-alk-CO2H is 3-(4-methyl-[2,2′-bipyridin]-4-yl)propanoic acid) with the amine-based ligand scaffold 3,5-bis(pirydin-3-ylethynyl)aniline using 2-chloro-1-methyl pyridinium iodide (CMPI) as the coupling reagent and DMAP as the base, forming complexes Ru13 and Ru14 (Fig. 14).

The coordination cages RuC15 and RuC16 of the composition of [Pd2(Ru13)4]12+ and [Pd2(Ru14)4]12+ were assembled by mixing the respective Ru metalloligands Ru13 and Ru14 with [Pd(NCMe)4](BF4)2 in DMSO at room temperature for one hour. The optimised structure, obtained from semi-empirical calculations, of RuC16 exhibited a Pd⋯Pd distances of 1.1 nm, a distance between the opposing inner C-atoms of 1.2 nm and a span of 5.0 nm. The metallocages RuC15 and RuC16 showed distinct emissive properties, demonstrating that the luminescence of the cages is either increased or decreased by altering the molecular structure of the ligand framework. The complex Ru13 and the corresponding cage RuC15 are not emissive. However, upon irradiation of metalloligand Ru14 and cage RuC16 at 260 nm, strong orange phosphorescence at λPL = 640 nm were observed with unusually high ΦPL values for Ru-based luminophores of 88% and 66%, respectively, for Ru14 and cage RuC16. These results demonstrated that the electronic separation of the Ru-based chromophores from the coordinating bis(pyridyl) ligand using an alkyl spacer can give rise to the formation of highly emissive ruthenium cages. To the best of our knowledge RuC16 exhibited one of the highest ΦPL reported for supramolecular coordination cages. However, such an unprecedentedly high ΦPL value contrasts with the those reported for analogous ruthenium(II) complexes, which generally exhibit ΦPL values below 20%.39a
In summary, cage compounds incorporating ruthenium complexes generally maintain the redox properties associated with the ruthenium chromophores. We have described that ruthenium cages can act both as photooxidants and photoreductants and can be efficiently used as photocatalysts for hydrogen production and in chemical reactions. As exemplified by cage RuC3, the cavity of cage compounds coupled with the intrinsic chirality and photoactivity of ruthenium complexes make ruthenium cages very interesting photocatalysts that can encapsulate guest compounds and promote their transformations in enantioselective fashions. On the other hand, the emission properties of ruthenium cages are not very tunable and fall within a narrow range in the red/deep-red region of the visible spectrum, similar to their metalloligands. As a result, the use of ruthenium assemblies as light-emitting materials remains very limited.
Iridium(III) capsules and cages
Cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes exhibit efficient phosphorescence, have a capacity to have their emission energy modulated across the visible spectrum, and show high chemical and thermal stability.72 They have been employed within many applications such as in sensing,73 bio-imaging,74 photoredox catalysis,75 solar fuels76 and in electroluminescent devices.77 The use of iridium complexes as luminescent components in discrete cage-like structure has recently become increasingly popular.78 In this section we comprehensively summarize the preparation and the optoelectronic properties of photoactive Ir(III) capsules and cages.
The first example of a 3D luminescent Ir(III) octahedral capsule, IrC1, of composition of [(Ir(ppy)2)6(tcb)4](OTf)6 (tbc is 1,3,5-tricyanobenzene), Fig. 15, was reported Lusby and co-workers.79 Firstly the racemic rac-[Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 was resolved into its enantiopure Λ,Λ- and Δ,Δ-stereoisomers through chromatographic resolution of serine-based complexes, the amino acid acting as a chiral ancillary ligand. The subsequent treatment of Λ,Λ- and Δ,Δ-[Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 with tcb quantitatively yielded the enantiopure capsules Λ6- and Δ6-IrC1. The racemic and enantiopure capsules were characterized by 1H, 19F NMR and CD spectroscopies and ESI-mass spectrometry. In addition, the geometry of the enantiopure Δ6-IrC1 capsule was elucidated by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The solid-state structure supports the solution structure, [(Ir(ppy)2)6(tcb)4](OTf)6, which is a truncated octahedron with triflate anions located in each of the octahedron windows. Compared to the bis(benzonitrile) reference complex [Ir(ppy)2(NCPh)2]OTf, which exhibited a weak emission (ΦPL < 1%) at λPL = 525 nm in deaerated tetrachloroethane, the emission of capsule IrC1 in the same solvent was broad and red-shifted at 575 nm, with an unusually enhanced ΦPL of 4%.

Duan and co-workers reported the multicomponent self-assembly of two pentanuclear Ir(III)–Zn(II) (IrC2)80 and Ir(III)–Co(II)81 (IrC3) heterometallic polyhedral capsules via imine bond formation. Polyhedron IrC2 was obtained by reacting fac-tris(4-(2-pyridinyl)phenylpyridinato)iridium (Ir1) and 2-formylpyridine via a subcomponent self-assembly in the presence of Zn(BF4)2·6H2O in acetonitrile under nitrogen (Fig. 16a). Similarly, polyhedron IrC3 was formed by mixing Ir1 with 2-formylpyridine in the presence of Co(ClO4)·6H2O in a 2:6:3 ratio in acetonitrile (Fig. 17a). Suitable single crystals for X-ray diffraction of both IrC2 and IrC3 were obtained by slow vapor diffusion of diethyl ether into MeCN solutions of the polyhedra. X-ray crystallography analyses revealed the formation of discrete cages of composition of Ir2M3 (where M is Zn in IrC2 and Co in IrC3) that possessed a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. In both structures, the three M atoms form the equatorial plane and the two iridium atoms occupied the axial positions.

Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are enzymes that contain active Zn2+ sites that are coordinated to three histidine residues and a water or hydroxide molecule. In Nature, these enzymes catalyze the reversible hydration of CO2 to CO32−.82 As IrC2 exhibits an adequate hydrophobic cavity and coordination geometry around the Zn atoms to mimic the active site of natural CAs, its ability to convert CO2 to CO32− was investigated. Interestingly, vapor diffusion of diethyl ether into a MeCN solution of IrC2 under a CO2 atmosphere yielded single crystals of IrC2⊃CO32−. X-ray crystal structure analysis revealed that a molecule of CO2 was successfully converted into CO32− and encapsulated into the cavity of IrC2 (Fig. 16b). IrC2⊃CO32− exhibited the same polyhedral structure as IrC2 with each of the three Zn atoms coordinating to one mono-dentate oxygen atom from CO32− forming a [Zn3(μ3-CO32−)] core, with CO32− protected inside the cavity of the polyhedron. IrC2 was found to be able to encapsulate also SO2 and convert it into SO3−. The X-ray crystal structure of IrC2 encapsulating SO32− (IrC2⊃SO32−, Fig. 16b) was obtained. Similar to IrC2⊃CO32−, in IrC2⊃SO32− the three Zn atoms coordinates to one mono-dentate oxygen atom from SO32− forming a [Zn3(μ3-SO32−)] core, which was encapsulated inside the cavity of IrC2. The formation of the host–guest systems IrC2⊃CO32− and IrC2⊃SO32− was observed not only in the crystal state but also in MeCN solution by 1H NMR spectroscopy and ESI-mass spectrometry. Photoluminescence spectroscopy provided further evidence for the encapsulation of CO32− within IrC2. As an example, upon pumping gaseous CO2 into the MeCN solution of IrC2, the Ir(III)-centered emission at 508 nm was gradually quenched within 18 minutes, the result of the formation of IrC2⊃CO32−.
The treatment of capsule IrC3 with one equivalent of carbonate dianions in MeCN solution promoted the formation of the host–guest assembly IrC3⊃CO32−, as observed both by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 17) and ESI-mass spectrometry. Interestingly, the empty cage IrC3 was able to convert in high yield (86–96%) 2-aylpyridines to their α-trichloromethylated products when the system was photoirradiated using a 26 W fluorescent lamp (Fig. 17b). However, when IrC3⊃CO32− or only the single components Ir1 or Co(ClO4)2·6H2O were tested as photocatalysts, no conversion was observed (Fig. 17c). These results unequivocally demonstrate the photoconversion of 2-aylpyridines into their α-trichloromethylated products is only promoted when the Ir(III) chromophores are assembled with the coordinatively unsaturated Co(II) centers. In IrC3, the Ir(III) complexes are rigidly maintained in close proximity to the Co(II) metal ions, increasing the effective reaction concentration within the local micro-environment, and thus promoting high photoconversion of the substrates.
Ir(III) homochiral supramolecular cages of composition Λ8-, Δ8-, and rac-[Ir8Pd4]16+ were recently reported by our group83 through the self-assembly between two families of enantiopure84 and racemic Ir(III) metalloligands of the form of Λ-, Δ-, and rac-[Ir(C^N)2(qpy)]BF4 and Pd2+ ions (Fig. 18a and b; C^N is mesppy = 2-phenyl-4-mesitylpyridinato in Ir2, and dFmesppy = 2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)-4-mesitylpyridinato in Ir3). The assembly of rac-Ir2 and rac-Ir3 with Pd2+ afforded racemic cages of composition rac-[Pd4Ir8]16+ (rac-IrC4 and rac-IrC5, respectively), while the assembly between Λ- and Δ-Ir2 and Λ- and Δ-Ir3 with Pd(II) ions gave rise to the enantiopure cages Λ8- and Δ8-[Pd4Ir8]16+ (Λ-, Δ-IrC4 and Λ-, Δ-IrC5, respectively). The chirality of the iridium metal did not impact the overall self-assembly process. Indeed, when either homochiral cage Λ- or Δ-IrC4 was mixed with the homochiral cage Δ-IrC5 at 85 °C for 12 h, metalloligand exchange was observed, promoting the formation of a statistical mixture of heteronuclear cages of composition [Pd4(Λ,Δ-Ir2)n(Δ-Ir3)m](BF4)16 (n + m = 8, from Λ-,Δ-Ir2:Δ-Ir3 = 8:0 to Λ-,Δ-Ir2:Δ-Ir3 = 0:8).

The photophysical properties of the metalloligands rac-, Λ-, Δ-Ir2 and rac-, Λ-, Δ-Ir3, and metallocages rac-, Λ-, Δ-IrC4 and rac-, Λ-, Δ-IrC5 were investigated both in DCM solution and in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) doped films (Fig. 19). The emissions of cages rac-, Λ-, Δ-IrC4 and rac-, Λ-, Δ-IrC5 in deaerated DCM were red-shifted, respectively, at 655 nm and 561 nm, with lower ΦPL of 5% and 14%, and shorter τPL of 202 ns and 825 ns, compared to those of the corresponding metalloligands rac-, Λ-, Δ-Ir2 and rac-, Λ-, Δ-Ir3 (e.g., rac-Ir2: λPL = 620 nm, ΦPL = 14%, τPL = 300 ns; rac-Ir3: λPL = 527 nm, ΦPL = 34%, τPL = 1000 ns). In the PMMA-thin films the emissions of Ir2, Ir3, IrC4 and IrC5 were blue-shifted, respectively, at 564 nm, 518 nm, 643 nm and 531 nm (Fig. 19), with enhanced ΦPL of 28%, 41%, 10% and 16% and longer multi-exponential τPL compared to their photophysical behavior in DCM. This is the result of the less polar environment and the rigidification of Ir2, Ir3, IrC4 and IrC5 conferred by the PMMA polymer host. The emissions of the cages IrC4 and IrC5 in both DCM and PMMA-doped films are red-shifted compared to the corresponding metalloligands as a result of the coordination of the Lewis acidic PdII to the qpy ligand of Ir2 and Ir3, thereby lowering their LUMO energies and giving rise to smaller optical gaps.85

The red-emitting cage IrC4 (Fig. 18b) exhibited a diameter of approximately 18.8 Å (corresponding to the Pd⋯Pd distance) with an internal pocket volume of approximately 3480 Å3, which was of adequate size to include mononuclear Ir(III) complexes. We therefore investigated the encapsulation of the anionic blue-emitting NBu4[Ir(dFppy)2(CN)2] complex (Ir4) and the subsequent photoinduced energy transfer between the blue-emitting guest donor Ir4 and the red-emitting cage IrC4 acceptor (Fig. 20a). The binding of Ir4 within the cavity of IrC4 in IrC4⊃Ir4 was confirmed by 1H, 1H DOSY and 19F NMR investigations along with computational calculations, revealing an association constant K of 3.9 × 106 ± 0.2 M−1 for IrC4⊃Ir4.

The 3LC emission exhibited by complex Ir4 in deaerated DMSO had two maxima at 458 and 483 nm and a shoulder at 515 nm (blue line in Fig. 20b), a ΦPL of 52%, and a τPL of 2915 ns. When cage IrC4 was titrated into a degassed DMSO solution of Ir4 at 298 K, the blue emission of the donor Ir4 was gradually quenched while the emission intensity of cage IrC4 at 666 nm was gradually enhanced, showing an isosbestic point at 565 nm (Fig. 20b). Upon photoexcitation of IrC4⊃Ir4 at 360 nm, efficient Dexter energy transfer from the blue-emitting Ir4 to the red-emitting IrC4 was therefore promoted with a calculated quenching rate constant (kq) of 1.44 × 109 M−1 s−1 and a Stern–Volmer constant (KSV) of 4.20 × 103 M−1. The CIE diagram in Fig. 20d shows the change in the emission colors observed during the emission titration. Titration 5 (Fig. 20d) shows CIE coordinates of (0.36, 0.30), which are close to the CIE coordinates of pure white light (0.31, 0.33).
Unlike the previous examples where the Ir-based metalloligands self-assemble in the presence of exogenous metal ions, Hardie, Zysman-Colman and co-workers86 reported the self-assembly between two CTV-type ligands (CTV is cyclotriveratrylene), (±)-tris(isonicotinoyl)-cyclotriguaiacylene (3), and (±)-tris(4-pyridyl-methyl)-cyclotriguaiacylene (4), with rac-[Ir(ppy)2(NCMe)2]+, forming metallo-cryptophane cages of compositions [(Ir(ppy)3)3(3)2](BF4)3 (IrC5) and [(Ir(ppy)3)3(4)2](BF4)3 (IrC6, Fig. 21). In these cages, it is the iridium centres themselves that act as vertices of the cages. Single crystals of IrC5 suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained (Fig. 21b) upon slow addition of diethyl ether to a nitromethane solution of IrC5. Cage IrC5 exhibits three pseudo-octahedrally coordinated Ir(III) centers, each bearing two ppy ligands and two pyridyl groups from two ligands 3 disposed in a cis-arrangements. The two ligands 3 are bridged between three Ir(III) centers, acting as vertices. Interestingly, the cage exhibits homochiral self-sorting. Indeed, despite the reaction mixture containing both the iridium-centered Λ- and Δ-enantiomers and the M and P enantiomers of the CTV ligands, thereby potentially generating twelve possible stereoisomeric cages, only the enantiomeric MM-ΛΛΛ and PP-ΔΔΔ cages were observed both in the X-ray structure of IrC5 and by NMR in solution after several months, where the self-sorting was found to be very slow. The self-sorting of the racemic cages IrC5 and IrC6 in nitromethane solution was accelerated by the presence of chiral guests such as R-camphor or S-camphor but the self-sorting rate was not affected by the presence of an achiral adamantane guest. The self-assembly in MeNO2 between the matched pair Δ-[Ir(ppy)2(NCMe)2]+ and P-3 or Λ-[Ir(ppy)2(NCMe)2]+ and M-3 yielded in less than five hours homochiral cages of composition Δ3, M2-[(Ir(ppy)3)3(3)2](BF4)3 and Λ3, P2-[(Ir(ppy)3)3(3)2](BF4)3, the formation of which was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

The emission properties of cages IrC5 and IrC6 in solution, as bulk powders and in PMMA-doped films (Fig. 22a and b) were investigated. IrC6 exhibited a vibronic 3LC emission at similar energies in DCM, as a powder and in PMMA-doped films (Fig. 22b) with ΦPL, respectively, of 15%, 1.6% and 10% and biexponential τPL, respectively, of 523, 887 ns; 141, 1175 ns and 688, 3042 ns. IrC5, on the other hand, exhibited a red-shifted emission (λPL = 648 nm) in the powder compared to that in DCM (λPL = 604 nm). In both media low ΦPL of 1% and short bi-exponential emission decays were observed (τPL = 59, 129 ns in DCM and τPL = 55, 203 ns). The acyl linker in IrC5 increased the conjugation of the iridium chromophore into the CTV scaffold resulting in a red-shifted emission compared to that observed for IrC6, but with similar photophysical properties compared to the monomeric reference complex [Ir(ppy)2(4-pyCO2Et)2]+ (4-pyCO2Et = 4-ethyl isonicotinate) (λPL = 560 nm; ΦPL = 2%).87 As a result of the attenuation of non-radiative vibrational motion in PMMA-doped thin films, the emission of IrC6 in thin film was blue-shifted and more structured at λPL = 514 nm with a higher ΦPL and longer τPL (ΦPL = 5.5%, τPL = 634 ns, 2319 ns) compared to those collected in DCM.

In a follow-up report the groups of Hardie and Zysman-Colman88 reported a series of five iridium cages of the form of [(Ir(C^N)2)3(L)2]3+ where the C^N ligands are 2-phenylpyridinato, 2-(4-methylphenyl)-pyridinato or 2-(4,5,6-trifluorophenyl)pyridinato and L are two CTV ligands functionalized with 3- or 4-pyridyl-azo-phenyl units (Fig. 23). Interestingly, photoirradiation of these cages with a high-power laser result in E → Z photoisomerization of the pyridyl-azo-phenyl groups with up to 40% of groups isomerizing. The isomerization was found to be reversible upon exposure of the cages to blue light. Thus, the cages show reversible structure-switching while maintaining their compositional integrity (Fig. 23b).
 Fig. 23  (a) Synthesis of [(Ir(C^N)2)3(L)2]3+ cages and (b) energy-minimized models of [(Ir(ppy)2)3(L)2]3+ with three and six azo-units in cis (Z) conformation. Adapted with permission from ref. 88 – Published by The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
All cages exhibited similar deep blue structured emissions in DCM with maxima between 410 nm and 414 nm, albeit with low ΦPL of around 1%. These emissions are significantly bluer compared to those of IrC5 and IrC6, which showed, respectively, yellow/orange emission and cyan emission in DCM (Fig. 22). Similar to complexes of composition [Ir(C^N)2(bpy-AZB)]+, where bpy-AZB is a 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) bearing azobenzene groups at the 4,4′-positions,89 the HOMOs of the azo-cages are located on the [Ir(C^N)2] moieties while the LUMOs lie on the high-energy azobenzene fragment. Therefore, the presence of the azobenzene units attached to coordinating pyridines implicate large HOMO–LUMO gaps and account for the deep-blue emissions exhibited by these cages. These cages exhibited the bluest emissions reported to date for iridium-based metallosupramolecular cages. On the other hand, their low ΦPL values are probably the result of concomitant population of emissive π* orbital involving the azobenzene ligand, access to non-radiative higher-lying metal-centered (MC) d–d states, which are located at similar energies, and non-radiative pathways associated with the conformationally flexible CTG-based ligands.90
In contrast to the weak red emissions exhibited by ruthenium assemblies, iridium(III) cages exhibit highly tunable emission colors which span from deep-blue to orange. The emission properties of these cage structures strongly depend on the nature of the iridium(III) complexes used in the self-assembly. We have herein illustrated that cages incorporating high-energy LUMO iridium complexes bearing azo-benzene fragments exhibit deep-blue emission, whereas cages incorporating lower-energy LUMO iridium complexes bearing a quaterpyridine ligand scaffold are yellow or orange emissive. This high degree of color tunability coupled with the relatively high ΦPL and short τPL exhibited by these iridium species make this class of compounds very interesting both as supramolecular photocatalysts and as emissive materials for lighting applications.
Conclusions
The self-assembly of arrays of Ru(II) and Ir(III) transition metal complexes in coordination metallocages clearly offers the great potential of combining the inherent guest-binding abilities of cage compounds with the redox- and photo-activity of phosphorescent metal complexes. In this feature article we have shown that such photoactive cages can be used as photocatalysts for hydrogen production and catalytic regio- and enantioselective photo-transformations of bound guests. Furthermore, the encapsulation of photoactive guests within phosphorescent cages permits a further modulation of the optoelectronic properties of the assemblies as a function of their photophysical interactions. This give rise to assemblies that exhibit emergent photophysical properties that are difficult to obtain in conventional molecular materials. Our contribution to the field has involved the investigation of four families of supramolecular cage compound containing Ru(II) (one family) and Ir(III) (three families) luminophores. We have investigated the photophysical properties of these systems both in solution and in the solid-state, and shown that the cages exhibit red-shifted emissions often with slightly lower ΦPL and shorter τPL compared to the corresponding phosphorescent metalloligands. In the examples of heterometallic cages containing Ru(II) or Ir(III) metalloligands complexes to Pd(II) ions, partial emission quenching is due to the formation of lower-energy charge-transfer states that involve both the photoactive metalloligand and the Pd centers. On the other hand, when the phosphorescent metal complexes are electronically isolated from the ligand frameworks involved in the self-assembly process, the photophysical properties of the luminescent complexes are generally maintained also in the assembled structure. Ligand design and control and preservation of the luminescent properties of the metal arrays in the assembled structures remain a major challenge to meet in order to expand the scope and use of photoactive cages. There is, however, little doubt that cage structures based on photoactive noble metals will continue to attract increasing attention and will play active roles in both functional supramolecular chemistry and in material science.

Diego Rota Martir
	Diego Rota Martir obtained his MSc degree “cum laude” in chemical sciences at the University of Milano-Bicocca in 2013. After having worked at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia@NEST in Pisa on nanoparticles for biomedical applications, he completed his PhD in 2018 at the University of St Andrews working with Dr Eli Zysman-Colman on self-assembly of photoactive materials, including luminescent cages and coordination polymers. Diego is presently an R&D scientist working in the area of luminophores for solid-state lighting at cynora GmbH.

Eli Zysman-Colman
	Eli Zysman-Colman obtained his PhD from McGill University in 2003 under the supervision of David N. Harpp as an FCAR scholar where he conducted his research in physical organic sulfur chemistry. He then completed two postdoctoral fellowships, one in supramolecular chemistry with Jay Siegel at the Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Zurich as an FQRNT fellow and the other in inorganic materials chemistry with Stefan Bernhard at Princeton University as a PCCM fellow. He joined the Department of Chemistry at the Université de Sherbrooke in Quebec, Canada, as an assistant professor in 2007. In 2013, he moved to the University of St Andrews where he is presently a Reader in Optoelectronic Materials and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry. His research program focuses on the rational design of: (I) luminophores for energy-efficient visual displays and flat panel lighting based on organic light emitting diode (OLED) and light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEEC) device architectures; (II) light harvesting dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and organic photovoltaics; (III) sensing materials employed in electrochemiluminescence; and (IV) photoredox catalysts for organic reactions.
