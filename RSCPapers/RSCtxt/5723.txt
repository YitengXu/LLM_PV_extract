    , Accepted 29th June 2021First published on 30th June 2021AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) material-based heterojunction solar cells have attracted significant interest due to their potential in low-cost photovoltaic applications. Herein, a novel MXene/GaAs heterojunction solar cell with high efficiency and excellent stability has been achieved via a facile one-step method of drop casting for the first time. The high work function of the transparent MXene and the enhanced interfacial interaction between the MXene and GaAs contribute to the formation of a high-quality Schottky diode, resulting in a high initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.69%, surpassing those of other reported 2D material/semiconductor heterojunction solar cells. Moreover, after the deposition of a ZnS/MgF2 composite coating, the as-prepared MXene/GaAs heterojunction solar cell exhibits an average PCE of 12.5% with stability over 30 days in air. This work is of great importance for obtaining high-efficiency and air-stable solar cells for light-harvesting for sustainable development.
1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials with high optical transmittance and conductivity provide a wide platform for designing novel optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, transistors, memory arrays, etc.1–4 In particular, 2D material/semiconductor heterostructures, with the merits of 2D materials as well as the high light absorbance of semiconductors, have been a hot topic for low-cost solar cells,5–9 where 2D materials serve as transparent conductive electrodes and active layers to separate and collect the photoexcited carriers from semiconductors. Among all of the 2D materials, was the first discovered and has been the most studied.10,11 However, the fabrication of graphene-based solar cells is complex, including the high-temperature growth of graphene,12 the etching of the Cu substrate13 and the removal of PMMA.14 In addition, the residual Cu and PMMA from the transfer of graphene are difficult to remove, which weakens the performance of the solar cells.15 Therefore, exploring novel 2D materials is essential to promote the development of high-efficiency and low-cost heterojunction solar cells.
As a novel family of 2D materials, MXenes have attracted much attention since they were reported in 2011.16,17 MXenes are commonly expressed as Mn+1XnTx (M refers to a transition metal, X is carbon and/or nitrogen and T represents various surface functionalities with –OH, –O and –F). MXenes possess a FoMe (the ratio of direct current conductivity to optical conductivity) of 15, which is higher than that of graphene and its derivates.18 In addition, MXenes and their films can be easily prepared via facile low-temperature solution-processing methods, promoting the large-scale application of these 2D materials. More importantly, the work function of MXenes can be adjusted flexibly by changing the surface groups and the types of MXene,19 which facilitates the excellent matching of them with various light absorbing materials to enhance the transportation of photo-induced carriers.20–22 These superior properties make MXenes promising candidates for energy conversion and storage, such as solar cells,20,22–24 photoelectrochemical water oxidation,25 supercapacitors18,26 and batteries.27 In the photovoltaic field, MXenes are mainly applied in perovskite, organic and silicon solar cells.28 However, elaborate processes must be considered to obtain the outstanding stability of perovskite and organic solar cells. For silicon solar cells, although the highest PCE of ∼11% was exhibited by introducing Ti3C2Tx MXene as the electrodes, no attempt has been made to improve the stability of the devices.20,24 In contrast to Si, GaAs has a direct bandgap of 1.42 eV, approximately the optimum to harvest sunlight,29 a high optical absorption coefficient and a high electron mobility of 8000 cm2 V−1 s−1.30 Therefore, a Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterostructure is promising to realize a higher PCE for solar cells.
Herein, we placed MXene (Ti3C2Tx solution) on a GaAs substrate to develop a heterojunction solar cell with an initial PCE of up to 9.69%, which is higher than that of any other reported 2D material/semiconductor heterojunction solar cell, due to the high work function of the transparent Ti3C2Tx films and the high quality of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs Schottky junction. With chemical doping treatment, the PCE of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cell was further improved to above 10% due to the significantly reduced series resistance. Furthermore, a ZnS/MgF2 composite coating, with an appropriate refractive index and anti-oxygen property, can remarkably improve the current density and stability of this type of solar cell in air, resulting in an average PCE of 12.5%. This work introduces a novel type of solar cell with high efficiency and stability to the family of emerging solar cells.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the Ti3C2Tx colloidal solution
The Ti3C2Tx colloidal solution was prepared based on previous reports.31 Firstly, LiF (1.6 g) was added to 9 M HCl (20 mL) with continuous stirring at 500 rpm for 10 min to obtain the etchant. Then, 1 g of Ti3AlC2 was immersed into the etchant and stirred for 24 h to etch the Al atoms. Afterward, the obtained mixture was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min and washed with deionized (DI) water until the pH of supernatant was about 6. The sediment was dispersed in DI water and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 1 h after ultrasonic treatment. Finally, the supernatant was collected to prepare the Ti3C2Tx colloidal solution.
2.2 Fabrication of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction solar cells
A 3 μm GaAs base and a 50 nm InGaP BSF layer were grown on a 350 μm GaAs wafer. The GaAs base, InGaP back surface field (BSF) layer and GaAs wafer were doped by Si, and the doping concentrations were about 1 × 1017, 2 × 1018, and 2 ×1018 cm−3, respectively. Au was evaporated onto the back side of GaAs as the rear contact. Subsequently, the substrate was treated with a rapid thermal processing (RTP) process and annealed at 350 °C for 30 s. The substrate was washed by acetone, ethanol and DI water to dissolve the organic residues, and immersed in 10 wt% HCl solution for 5 min to remove the oxide. A 100 nm Al2O3 insulation layer and a 120 nm Ag grid mesh were fabricated on the substrate by photolithography and electron beam evaporation. The width of the grid lines and the spacing distance between each line were 10 and 300 μm, respectively. The illumination area was 9 mm2, defined by the grid mesh. The Ti3C2Tx colloidal solution, of various concentrations, was dropped on the substrate and dried at 80 °C for 3 min under N2 flow to fabricate the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cells.
2.3 Chemical treatments and deposition of the composite coating
A drop of 2% HCl was placed on the Ti3C2Tx layer in the active area for 15 s, according to the previous literature.20 20 mM bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (TSFA) (≥95.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 mM HAuCl4 (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in nitromethane and spun onto the surface of the MXene flake at 2500 rpm. The ZnS/MgF2 (55/100 nm) composite coating was deposited onto the top of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction solar cells by electron beam evaporation.
2.4 Characterization
The work functions of Ti3C2Tx and GaAs were measured by UPS (ThermoFisher, Escalab 250xi). The transmittance and reflectance spectra were obtained for the wavelength region between 300 and 1100 nm using a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (Lambda950). The surface morphologies, chemical compositions and crystal structures of the as-prepared and chemically treated Ti3C2Tx films were characterized by SEM (Hitachi, SU-70), XPS (E4991A) and Raman (HJY LabRAM Aramis) spectroscopy, respectively. The thicknesses of the as-prepared Ti3C2Tx films were measured by TEM (FEI Talos F200X). The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the solar cells were recorded with a Keithley 2400 digital source meter and a 3A solar simulator (Oriel, Newport) under AM 1.5G conditions with a radiation power of 100 mW cm−2, calibrated by a standard Si solar cell. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the devices were obtained by an EQE measurement system (Enlitech, QE-R3011, Taiwan).
3. Results and discussion
The Ti3C2Tx solution, prepared by chemically etching the Ti3AlC2 parent phase, was drop-casted on the GaAs base layer to fabricate the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cells, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Here, the GaAs base layer was grown on a 4 inch GaAs wafer with an InGaP interlayer; the details on the doping concentrations and thicknesses of each layer were summarized in the Experimental section. The InGaP BSF layer can reduce the combination of carriers induced by long-wavelength photons and thus enhances the PCE of the solar cells from 3.46% to 6.09% (Fig. S1†). Note that the concentration of the Ti3C2Tx colloidal solution used here is 0.05 mg mL−1 and the optimal concentration will be discussed in later parts. Subsequently, a grid mesh with 100 nm-thick Al2O3 and 120 nm-thick Ag was deposited on the GaAs substrate to reduce the series resistance of the solar cells. The width of the grid line and the spacing distance between each line were 10 and 300 μm, respectively, and the illumination area was 9 mm2, defined by the grid mesh, as shown in Fig. 1b.

The band structure of the Ti3C2Tx/n-GaAs heterostructure is investigated to elucidate the work mechanism of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction solar cells. According to the UPS spectra given in Fig. 2a, the calculated work function of Ti3C2Tx is 5.5 eV, which is slightly higher than the reported value20,32 due to the surface groups and water adsorption.19,33 Typically, the work function of graphene, ranging from 4.5 to 5.0, is lower than that of Ti3C2Tx in our work.5,34 It is well known that a higher work function of 2D materials leads to a higher barrier height (ΦB) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the solar cells, thereby enhancing the PCE of solar cells.14,35 In addition, the work function and the energy difference between the Fermi level (EF) and valence band top potential of n-GaAs are calculated to be 3.97 and 1.54 eV, respectively. Therefore, the valence band maximum and the conduction band bottom potential of n-GaAs are about 5.51 and 4.09 eV, respectively, which agrees well with the previous report.36 Based on the above analysis, the band schematic of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs Schottky junction is proposed in Fig. 2b. The work function difference between GaAs and Ti3C2Tx contributes to the formation of a Schottky junction with a ΦB as high as 1.41 eV, which accelerates the separation of photo-excited carriers at the interface between GaAs and Ti3C2Tx and promotes the collection of carriers by Ag and the Au electrode. To further emphasize the importance of Ti3C2Tx, we also measured the photovoltaic properties of the GaAs solar cell without Ti3C2Tx. As shown in Fig. S2,† one can see that the device without the Ti3C2Tx layer yields a negligible photo-current density of 0.0034 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage of 0.0021 V. This poor performance is ascribed to Al2O3, with excellent electric insulation properties, preventing the migration of photo-induced carriers from GaAs to the Ag electrode. Therefore, Ti3C2Tx, as the active layer, can endow the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction solar cells with superior photovoltaic properties.

Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves under AM1.5G illumination for the devices with the highest efficiencies fabricated with various concentrations of Ti3C2Tx solution. The photovoltaic parameters for the devices are listed in Table 1. As the concentration of Ti3C2Tx decreases from 0.1 mg mL−1 to 0.005 mg mL−1, the short-circuit current density (JSC) is improved from 6.96 to 16.26 mA cm−2 and the fill factor (FF) is reduced from 79.40% to 51.59%. The increased JSC is mainly attributed to the improved optical transmittance of the Ti3C2Tx films, as shown in Fig. 3b. The optical transmittance of the 0.1 mg mL−1 Ti3C2Tx film is about 24.47% at a wavelength of 500 nm and then reaches 93.24% when the concentration of the Ti3C2Tx solution decreased to 0.005 mg mL−1, as well as the color of the Ti3C2Tx solution changing from dark green to light green (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, the FF of the device is degraded with a decrease in the Ti3C2Tx solution concentration. FF is mainly related to the series resistance (RS) and ideality factor (IF).37 Generally, a lower RS and IF result in a higher FF. The RS of a solar cell can be extracted as the slope of the linear fitting of dV/dlnI as a function of I,38 and IF can be extracted via fitting the J–V curve, measured under dark conditions, by eqn (1), (1)where J is the current density, J0 is the reverse saturation current density, q is the electron charge, n is the IF of the Schottky junction and k and T are the Boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3c, the devices fabricated with a Ti3C2Tx solution with a lower concentration exhibit higher RS. Furthermore, the IF of the device is also increased from 1.31 to 2.48 with a decreased concentration of the Ti3C2Tx solution. The increased RS originates from the increased sheet resistance of the Ti3C2Tx films (Fig. S3†) and the elevated IF is due to the increased interfacial carrier recombination between GaAs and the thinner Ti3C2Tx films. In addition, the VOC of devices fabricated with thicker Ti3C2Tx films are smaller because more carrier recombination occurs in the thicker films that leads to the higher reverse saturation current (Fig. S4†). In solar cells, VOC is determined by eqn (2), where JSC is the short circuit current density. The device prepared with a concentration of 0.01 mg mL−1 possesses the highest VOC because it combines a high JSC and a lower saturation current density. (2)

As a result, the optimum Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cell with 0.01 mg mL−1 Ti3C2Tx has excellent transparency, conductivity and quality of the Schottky junction, leading to the highest PCE of 9.69%. It is known that the device reproducibility is important for the practical application of devices. As shown in Fig. 3d, the PCE values of 18 pieces of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction solar cell are in the range of 8.5–9.75%, exhibiting the good reproducibility of the devices. Fig. 3e shows the TEM and corresponding mapping images of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction interface prepared with 0.01 mg mL−1 Ti3C2Tx solution. It can be clearly observed that the thickness of the Ti3C2Tx film with the 2D lattice is about 2 nm. The thin thickness of Ti3C2Tx film contributes to the high light transmittance and the enhanced current density of the solar cell. In addition, the corresponding SEM image of the optimum Ti3C2Tx/GaAs in Fig. 3f shows the clear structure of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, indicating that the thin film ensures the smooth transport of photon-generated carriers. The thickness of the Ti3C2Tx film made by the drop-casting method varies in different parts, which is also confirmed by TEM image, as shown in Fig. 3e. The volume of the Ti3C2Tx solution changes in different sites due to the presence of the surface tension of water, which can be responsible for the non-uniformity of the MXene film. However, the difference (in nanometers) of the thickness of the Ti3C2Tx film has little impact on the reproducibility of the devices, as shown in Fig. 3d. Therefore, the effect of the uniformity of the Ti3C2Tx film on the GaAs substrate is negligible on the application of the solar cells. Furthermore, 6 and 3 μL Ti3C2Tx solution were also employed to investigate the effect of the volume of Ti3C2Tx on the photovoltaic performance (Fig. S5†). As the volume decreases, the device has an 24% enhancement of JSC, while its FF and VOC show a 26% drop. Finally, the PCE of the solar cells is decreased from 9.69% to 9.41%.
It is noteworthy that the ΦB calculated from eqn (3) (A* is the Richardson coefficient of n-GaAs (8.16 A cm−2 K−1)39) is 0.98 eV, and the calculated value is lower than the difference between WM and χ (1.41 eV), which is attributed to the following factors. (3)
On the one hand, due to the absorption of oxygen and water, the measured work function of the Ti3C2Tx film is higher than that of the inner Ti3C2Tx nanosheets bonded with GaAs.32 On the other hand, GaAs is oxidized by the H2O molecules after the Ti3C2Tx film is coated on GaAs (Fig. S6†), which introduces carrier recombination centers and thus reduces the ΦB.40 Furthermore, charge transfer between Ti3C2Tx and GaAs will also decrease the barrier height.37 However, the ΦB of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction solar cell is still higher than that of graphene/GaAs heterojunction solar cells, ranging from 0.76 to 0.83 eV,35,40,41 resulting in a higher VOC.

Table 2 compares the PCE of typical semiconductor/2D material heterojunction solar cells.8,9,20,42 Obviously, the initial PCE of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction solar cell exceeds that of other heterojunction solar cells due to the high work function of the transparent Ti3C2Tx film and the high-quality Schottky junction (the IF is as low as 1.57). It is well known that IF is a key indicator to evaluate the quality of a Schottky junction and the IF of an ideal Schottky junction is close to unity. Typically, the IF of graphene/GaAs is in the range of 1.93–4.03.40,43 Therefore, the quality of Ti3C2Tx/GaAs in this work is higher than that of the reported graphene/GaAs Schottky junctions as a result of the high ΦB and enhanced interfacial interaction between Ti3C2Tx and GaAs. Furthermore, the chemical doping and composite coating construction for the GaAs/MXene solar cell have been also investigated to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability for commercialization.

Chemical doping is an effective way to enhance the optoelectronic properties of 2D material based solar cells due to the improved conductivity and work function of the 2D materials.6,14 In this work, 2% HCl doping of Ti3C2Tx films is employed in the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction solar cells.20 Fig. S7† shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p in the as-prepared Ti3C2Tx films. The peaks observed at 455 eV and 461.11 eV are assigned to Ti–C 2p3/2 and Ti–C 2p3/2, respectively. The peaks located at 454.87, 456.01, 457.25, and 458.64 eV correspond to Ti–C, Ti–X, Tix–Oy and TiO2, respectively. After HCl was introduced to he Ti3C2Tx film, the Ti 2p peaks are nearly the same, as shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. S8† shows the SEM image of the HCl treated Ti3C2Tx films. The surface morphology of the Ti3C2Tx film remains almost the same. The results of XPS and SEM show that HCl has a slight effect on the structure and morphology of the Ti3C2Tx film. However, the Raman spectra show that the Eg mode at 297 cm−1 has a red shift to 286 cm−1 (Fig. 4b), indicating that HCl can weaken the in-plane motion of OH functional groups.44 The same phenomenon is also observed in the device treated with HAuCl4 (Fig. S9†). The HCl doped Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cell has an improved JSC of 21.01 mA cm−2 and FF of 63.95%, as shown in Fig. 4c. In addition, the PCE of the solar cell is boosted to 10.08%. Meanwhile, the RS of device has a 2.7 fold drop, reflecting the increased conductivity of the Ti3C2Tx film (Fig. 4d). A reasonable explanation for the decreased RS is that HCl provides transportation channels for carriers and thus reduces the resistance.45 In previous reports, TSFA9,14 and HAuCl446 have been widely used as p-type dopants of graphene due to their strong oxidizing property. However, they are not suitable for the doping of Ti3C2Tx. As illustrated in Fig. S10a,† 20 mM TSFA damages the Ti3C2Tx films, which is detrimental to the collection of photo-generated carriers. Furthermore, the Ti 2p and Ga 3d XPS spectra show that TSFA leads to the oxidation of the Ti3C2Tx films and GaAs substrate (Fig. S10b and c†). However, TSFA has no effect on the vibrational properties of Ti3C2Tx (Fig. S9†). Compared to TSFA, 5 mM HAuCl4 weakens the device slightly, as shown in Fig. S10d–f.† Interestingly, HAuCl4 is largely reduced to Au nanoparticles and covers the surface of the Ti3C2Tx film (Fig. S10g†). Meanwhile, the Eg mode at 297 cm−1 has a red shift to 286 cm−1 due to the presence of HCl (Fig. S9†). In terms of the photovoltaic performance of the devices with chemical treatments, TSFA increases the JSC of the device from 14.83 mA cm−2 to 16.52 mA cm−2 and decreases the VOC and FF to 0.67 V and 63.78%, respectively (Fig. S10h†). The improved JSC of the doped Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cell can be ascribed to Ti3C2Tx being vulnerable to oxidation to TiO2, which can serve as an antireflection coating.47 For 5 mM HAuCl4, all the photovoltaic parameters of devices are degraded (Fig. S10i†). In particular, the decreased JSC could be attributed to the radiation damping effect of the dense Au nanoparticles.9 There is a competition between Au and TiO2 for the JSC. Therefore, moderate dopants should be considered for Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cells.37

(d) The series resistance values extrapolated from dV/d(lnI) versus I curves of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cell before and after HCl doping. 
To enhance the utilization of the incident light, a ZnS/MgF2 (55/100 nm) composite coating was deposited on top of the devices due to its appropriate refractive index.8 The optical paths of the interference rays reflected from the different interfaces is shown in Fig. 5a. The incident light and reflected light possess opposite phases, leading to a lower reflectivity. Fig. 5b shows the reflectance of the device with three different treatments. The reflectance of the GaAs substrate shows a relatively high reflectance of more than 35% under wavelengths of 400–800 nm. After the Ti3C2Tx film is introduced, the device has a slight decrease in the reflectance. Interestingly, the reflectance of the solar cell coated with a ZnS/MgF2 film is less than 16% in the same region. Meanwhile, the ZnS/MgF2 film coated Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cell shows an elevated JSC of 22.83 mA cm−2 and an enhanced PCE of 12.16% compared to the pure Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cell (15.87 mA cm−2, 8.87%) due to the increased light absorption (Fig. 5c). According to the EQE data shown in Fig. 5d, the integrated current density of the device without the ZnS/MgF2 film is 15.81 mA cm−2 and it is increased to 22.03 mA cm−2 after the deposition of the ZnS/MgF2 film, which is in accordance with the measured values. More importantly, ZnS and MgF2 can be deposited with a relatively lower energy than commonly used antireflection coatings such as Al2O39 and ZrO2,40 which could reduce the damage to the Ti3C2Tx films. Fig. S11† shows another 4 devices with the ZnS/MgF2 composite coating. The solar cells exhibit PCE values in the range of 12.12% to 12.69%, with the average value of 12.5%, indicating that the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cells still have excellent reproducibility after the deposition of the ZnS/MgF2 composite coating.

(c) J–V curves of the devices with and without the ZnS/MgF2 composite coating under AM1.5G illumination and (d) their EQE spectra and the corresponding integrated current densities. 

Fig. 6a shows the retention of the performance of the devices with and without the ZnS/MgF2 composite coating in the air (the temperature was in the range of 20 °C to 25 °C and the humidity was in the range of 50% to 60%). For the devices without the composite coating, the PCE degradation is as high as 37.98% after 30 days due to the decreased FF (from 75.26% to 50.94%). Previous literature has shown that the oxidation of Ti3C2Tx could increase the sheet resistance of Ti3C2Tx films.32 In this study, the oxidation of Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 6b) results in a dramatically elevated RS (231.26 Ω) of the device and a degraded FF. On the other hand, the PCE of the device with the composite coating remains stable after 30 days. The excellent stability of the solar cell is mainly attributed to the anti-oxidation property of ZnS and MgF2. In addition, a slightly increased RS (from 35.56 to 42.52 Ω) is also a response to the negligible oxidation of Ti3C2Tx. Fig. S12† shows the J–V curves of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs solar cells with HCl doping and the ZnS/MgF2 composite coating. The current density shows an enhancement of 35.44%. However, the FF is decreased from 63.95 to 52.99%. This can be attributed to the evaporation of HCl under vacuum and the interfacial reaction between HCl and ZnS.48 In future, we believe that an optimal combination of a stable dopant and the ZnS/MgF2 composite coating will lead to a higher PCE of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction solar cell.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction solar cell has been demonstrated by simply dropping Ti3C2Tx films on a GaAs substrate, exhibiting a high power conversion efficiency of 9.69% due to the high transparence of Ti3C2Tx and high quality Schottky junction, which is the highest value so far among 2D material/semiconductor heterojunction solar cells. The PCE of the solar cell can be further enhanced to above 10% by doping with 2% HCl, owing to the dramatically reduced RS. Finally, a ZnS/MgF2 coating can significantly improve the current density of the as-prepared solar cell, as well as resulting in an average PCE of 12.5% and over 30 days stability in air. It is expected that the PCE of the Ti3C2Tx/GaAs heterojunction solar cell can be further boosted by the passivation of GaAs and employing appropriate dopants.
