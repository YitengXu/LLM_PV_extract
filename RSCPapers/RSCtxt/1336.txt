    , Accepted 20th May 2021First published on 9th June 2021AbstractThe ternary strategy is promising to enhance the photovoltaic properties of organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, it is full of challenges when this approach involves only small molecules. Herein, a fullerene derivative, ICBA is introduced as the third component to improve the photovoltaic performance of BTR-Cl:Y6-based all-small-molecule (ASM) OSCs. The significant performance enhancement mainly results from reduced bimolecular and trap-assistant recombination, prolonged carrier lifetime and facilitated charge extraction. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the ternary strategy and pave an alternative way for third component selection.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) can be processed by solution, and have the advantages of being ultralight, ultrathin, ultraflexible, and are emerging as a promising candidate for next-generation photovoltaic technology and facile manufacture for portable and translucent generators.1 Compared to polymer fragment, all-small-molecule (ASM) OSCs have become a priority for commercial production, owing to the advantages of small molecules (SMs), such as accurate chemical structures, facile purification, and outstanding repeatability.2 In the era of fullerene acceptors, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ASM OSCs was just over 10%. With the advent of non-fullerene acceptors, the PCE of ASM OSCs skyrocketed to over 14%. Nevertheless, SMs are more inclined to accumulate and form stronger crystallization, leading to excessive donor/acceptor phase segregation. Therefore, in terms of the PCE, ASM OSCs still lag far behind OSCs based on polymers which possess nearly 19% efficiency and tandem structures over 17% efficiency.3,4 Hence, further improving the PCE of ASM OSCs is required for prospective industrial applications.
The ternary strategy is a simple, economical and effective means to obtain outstanding photovoltaic performance, enabled through incorporating a third component into active layer materials based on a binary system to compensate absorption, and optimize phase separation – enhancing voltage (VOC), current intensity (JSC) and fill factor (FF).5,6 Two pivotal avenues have proven effective on account of ternary ASM OSCs:7 one is adding a compatible donor that possesses similar crystallinity to obtain the finely-tuned morphology of the active layer. For instance, Wei et al. add similar donor M1 into a M2/PC71BM system to tune the phase separation, resulting in significantly improved charge transport, carrier mobility, carrier lifetimes and device performance.8 In our previous work, we added a third component BTR-OH into a BTR/PC71BM system, which has a similar structure and enhanced photovoltaic performance successfully;9 a second avenue is adopting a fullerene acceptor to optimize the morphology and compensate for absorption. The booming advance of nonfullerene acceptors has allowed nonfullerene-based ASM OSCs to become the best-performing systems, thus many researchers employ the aforementioned second approach to promote the photovoltaic properties of ASM OSCs.7 For instance, Beaujuge et al. demonstrated that PC71BM could be evenly dispersed in the DR3TBDTT:IDIC (described as DR3:ICC6 in the reference) system as a third component to tune the active layer morphology, which lead to significantly improved device performance.8 Zhu et al. reported that a hierarchical morphology can be constructed by synergizing fullerene and nonfullerene acceptors.9 In this scenario, the CT state can be suppressed to reduce the energy loss and improve charge transport, thus contributing to the FF enhancement. What’s more, the addition of NITI can compensate for the absorption of BTR/PC71BM in the range from 680 nm to 850 nm, resulting in significant JSC improvement. However, in most cases, the fullerene derivative PC71BM is the only choice, thus developing a suitable third component for nonfullerene-based ASM OSCs is of significance towards high-performance ASM OSCs.
Herein, a fullerene derivative, indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) is enabled with a third component to fine-tune the morphology of BTR-Cl:Y6 ASM OSCs and achieves a PCE of 14.7%, which stands among the top values of best-performing ASM OSCs. Considering ICBA can be easily synthesized, and possesses better solubility in chloroform and stronger visible absorption than PCBM, it becomes a promising replacement of PCBM as the third component for nonfullerene-based ASM OSCs.10–13 The PCE enhancement (10%) soundly proves the effectiveness of ICBA as the third component and paves an alternative way to elevate the photovoltaic properties of ASM OSCs.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a depicts the molecular structure of BTR-Cl, Y6 and ICBA, and their corresponding energy level and absorption profile are shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/AL/Phen-NaDPO/Ag, where ITO is indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS (here as 4083) is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) utilized hole transport layer (HTL), AL is active layer, Phen-NaDPO is phenyl(2-naphthyl)diphenylphosphine oxide utilized electron transport layer (ETL). The detailed fabrication process and testing methods for the devices are depicted in the ESI.†Fig. 2a summarizes the reported work of ASM OSCs with the best PCE from 2015 to 2021.14–21 The incorporation of 5% ICBA elevates the PCE of BTR-Cl:Y6-based devices, and stands among the 14.7% efficiency values of ASM OSCs. Table 1 summarizes the figures of merit of the BTR-Cl/Y6 (control) and BTR-Cl/Y6/ICBA (optimized)-based ASM OSCs. Meanwhile, device optimization parameters for the fabrication process using different ratios of ICBA are listed in Table S1.†

Fig. 2b depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the control and optimized devices, the introduction of ICBA increases the VOC from 834.2 to 843.0 mV, enhances the FF from 69.34% to 73.88%, improves the JSC from 23.24 mA cm−2 to 23.55 mA cm−2, and improves the PCE from 13.4% to 14.7%. The improvement of VOC based on optimized devices is attributed to the lower HOMO of ICBA (−5.8 eV) compared with Y6 (−5.7 eV). Fig. 2c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the control and optimized devices. The EQE response range of both devices is the same with a similar shape, but the optimized device presents a stronger photoresponse compared with the control device in the range of 460–600 and 700–850 nm, which is attributed to the increased JSC. The JSC values of BTR-Cl:Y6 and BTR-Cl:Y6:ICBA-based devices calculated from the EQE curves are 23.03 mA cm−2 and 23.39 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the JSC values measured from the J–V measurement system (within a 1% error, as listed in Table 1).
The FF was determined by the carrier mobility, charge recombination, charge transport, charge extraction and carrier lifetime. The largest contribution to PCE enhancement of the optimized device is from the FF. Firstly, the enhanced and more balanced hole and electron mobility data are in line with the improvement of the device performance (Table 1 and Fig. S1†). In addition, the dynamic process of the carrier is characterized. The recombination losses for the carrier are normally quantified by calculating the dependence of JSC and VOC on different light intensities. As shown in Fig. 3a, α values of 0.979 and 0.994 are obtained for control and optimized devices, respectively, both devices have negligible bimolecular recombination losses. As depicted in Fig. 3b, n values of 1.27 and 1.04 are obtained for the control and optimized devices, respectively, implying that the incorporation of ICBA can reduce the trap-assisted recombination.18 The carrier lifetimes (τ) (Fig. 3c) are measured from the TPV decay dynamics under 1 sun. The addition of ICBA increases the τ value of 0.98 μs to 1.47 μs, which is consistent with the weaker recombination in the optimized device. In addition, the photocurrent decay time under short-circuit conditions is 0.80 and 1.29 μs for the control and optimized devices, respectively, illustrating that the introduction of ICBA can effectively facilitate charge carrier extraction.

The phase separation is a critical factor for morphology optimization. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was adopted to characterize the surface morphology of the control and optimized films. As demonstrated in Fig. 3e and f, the root mean square roughness (Rq) value of 2.31 nm was obtained in the control film compared with that of the optimized film with an Rq value of 1.75 nm. Thus, the optimized film presents a more uniform and smooth surface morphology, resulting in fine phase separation of the active layer, which is beneficial for charge separation and transport, and thus contributes to the remarkably enhanced FF and enhanced device performance (Table 1).22–26
3. Conclusions
In summary, we adopt a simple, efficient method by incorporating ICBA as a third component into the BTR-Cl:Y6 ASM OSCs, and successfully enhanced the PCE from 13.4% to 14.7%. We found that the introduction of ICBA lead to: (i) reduced trap-assistant recombination, and thus prolonged the carrier lifetime and facilitated the charge extraction; (ii) more uniform and smooth morphology, which contributed to the remarkably enhanced FF. Our findings highlight the ternary strategy with the fullerene derivative as the third component and provide an alternative method to improve the photovoltaic properties of high-performing ASM OSCs.
