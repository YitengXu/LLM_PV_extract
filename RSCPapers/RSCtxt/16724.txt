    AbstractElectrodes made of vertically-aligned ZnO nanorods (NRs) have been prepared and analyzed in dye sensitized solar cells (DSC). We report a ∼20% power conversion efficiency increase during the first hours of solar cell testing at 1000 W m−2 (AM 1.5). The latter has been attributed to the physisorption/chemisorption of the N-719 dye on the ZnO NRs induced by UV-light irradiation. The ZnO NRs were grown by the hydrothermal method for 6 h obtaining a ZnO layer thickness of about 1.8 μm. The highest solar cell efficiency obtained was 0.69% after UV light irradiation (at 72 °C, 0.63 V, 2.85 mA cm−2, 0.39 FF). The effect of UV light has been monitored by UV-VIS, IV-curves and IPCE analyses with time, and has been related to the solar cell performance.

Broader context
ZnO is a promising semiconductor oxide to be employed in dye sensitized solar cells, and beyond. The possibility to obtain this material in a wide variety of nano-forms through easy and scalable synthesis techniques has already been demonstrated by many research groups. Power conversion efficiencies of 5–6%, have been achieved when applied in dye sensitized solar cells. Thus, the subsequent step is the study and understanding of ZnO behavior under different conditions. The latter will allow us to tune its properties to improve DSC efficiency but specially to fabricate long-lasting devices. In this work, we report the effect of different testing conditions on dye sensitized solar cells based on vertically-aligned ZnO nanorods (NRs). We describe the many different conditions that affect ZnO NR synthesis and, as a consequence, the impact on final device performance. Especial emphasis is made on the effect that UV light has on power conversion efficiency and solar cell lifetime.

Introduction
The application of ZnO in excitonic solar cells, XSCs, (organic, dye sensitized and hybrid) has been rising over the last few years due to its similarities with the most studied semiconductor oxide, TiO2. ZnO presents comparable bandgap values and conduction band position as well as higher electron mobility than TiO2.1,2 It can be synthesized in a wide variety of nanoforms3,4 applying straight forward and scalable synthesis methodologies.5,6 Particularly, the application of vertically-aligned ZnO nanostructures it is thought to improve contact between the donor and acceptor material in organic solar cells (OSCs), or improve electron injection in dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs).7 To date, DSC based on ZnO have achieved promising power conversion efficiency values of ∼6%.8,9 Yet, ZnO is not an easy material. It is a semiconductor oxide, the properties of which are greatly influenced by external conditions like synthesis methods,10–15 temperature,16,17 testing atmosphere (air, vacuum),18–21 or illumination.22–25 For example, minimal changes in the shape of the ZnO (nanoparticles, nanorods, nanotips, etc), can produce different properties26–28 (e.g. wettability) which in turn, affects the interface with any organic semiconductor or dye molecule. Moreover, the modification of properties like hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity,23,24 or the amount of chemisorbed species on the ZnO surface25 have already been reported to be affected by UV irradiation. In DSC, a major drawback is associated with the interaction between dye molecules and ZnO itself. Dye loading on ZnO must be carefully controlled in order to obtain the optimal power conversion efficiency for every specific system.29–31 An excess in loading time results in the formation of aggregates made by the dissolution of the ZnO and the formation of [Zn+2-dye] complexes.29,32,33 In order to resolve these problems, research is currently focused on the study of new metal-free photosensitizers and the introduction of new anchoring groups.34–36 Nevertheless, very recent reports indicate that the application of organic dyes could also be affected by factors like high concentration of Li+ ions in the electrolyte or the photoinduced dye desorption.37 As early as 1978, V. J. Norman demonstrated that the absorption of organic dyes, like uranine and rhodamine B, on ZnO can be enhanced under light irradiation. A three- and two-fold increase on the amount of uranine and rhodamine B adsorbed on ZnO, respectively, was observed after UV-light exposure.25 The latter presents important implications in ZnO-based devices, like solar cells or diodes, since nanostructured layers of ZnO are increasingly being used on these devices, and some research groups have reported on the beneficial effect of exposing ZnO-based devices to UV irradiation.38–40
In this work we present our most recent studies on the effect of UV-light irradiation on ZnO-based DSC with time and the improvement observed on photovoltaic properties. The study was performed on DSCs made of vertically-aligned nanorods (NRs) of ZnO sensitized with the N-719 dye and a comparison of solar cell efficiency, IPCE analyses and UV-Vis absorption tests at different periods of time up to 500 h was carried out. We observed a ∼20% solar cell efficiency increase when the DSC was irradiated with UV light under simulated light intensity of 1000 W m−2 (AM 1.5). This efficiency increase is not observed for solar cells applying UV filters that cut wavelengths below 400 nm. The highest solar cell values obtained for the DSC at 1000 W m−2 were 0.63 V, 2.85 mA cm−2, 0.39 FF and 0.69% power conversion efficiency.
Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals were commercial materials and used without further purification: methanol (99.8% Aldrich), ethanol (99.5% Panreac) zinc acetate dehydrate (99% Riedel-de Haën), KOH (Na < 0.002% Fluka), hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) (99% Aldrich), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) (98% Sigma-Aldrich), Diethanolamine (≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich). Indium-tin oxide (ITO) slides were purchased from Solems (R = 50 ohms, ITO layer produced by magnetron sputtering – thickness 1000 Å, 1 mm thick glass). The electrolyte used is Iodolyte AN-50 (50 mM tri-iodide in acetonitrile), the dye (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2-(NCS)2] (Ruthenium 535-bisTBA also known as N-719), the Pt-paste, Pt-catalyst T/SP and a hot melt sealing foil (SX1170) from Solaronix. All the aqueous solutions were prepared using double distilled and ion-exchange water.
Preparation and characterization of ZnO nanorod (NRs) films
ITO (indium-tin oxide) slides were washed with acetone, ethanol and mili-Q water, dried under N2 flux and finally cleaned for 18 min in a UV-surface decontamination system (Novascan, PSD-UV) connected to an O2 gas source. ZnO NRs electrodes were prepared on the ITO substrates by the following procedure: first, a dense ZnO buffer layer from sol–gel solution was prepared by spin coating at 1500 rpm. The ZnO sol–gel was prepared using the method previously reported.18,41 Briefly, 2.0g of zinc acetate and 1.07g of diethanol amine (DEA) were dissolved in 10 mL of isopropanol and heated at 60 °C for about 10 min until total dissolution, then the solution was diluted with ethanol (1:1) and filtered through a 0.45 μm pore membrane (Albet). The substrates were sintered at 450°/2 h to form a dense ZnO layer of about 80 nm. ZnO nanoparticles were used as seeds to grow the ZnO NRs, and were deposited on top of the dense ZnO layer. The preparation of the ZnO nanoparticles was carried out following the method described by Pacholski et al.42 Briefly, a solution of 0.03 M KOH in methanol was added dropwise in a refluxing mixture of zinc acetate dehydrate 0.01 M in methanol at 65 °C. After 2 h of refluxing the solution was allowed to cool and 3 layers were made on the ITO substrate by spin coating at 1000 rpm,43 thermal treatments were applied to the substrates at 150 °C for 10 min between the deposition of each layer. To grow the ZnO NRs the samples were placed face-down in a glass beaker, in an equimolar aqueous solution of 25 mM zinc nitrate hexahydrate and HMT,6,14 at 96 °C between 1 h and 6 h. After synthesis, the samples were rinsed with deionized water, dried in air and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air. Pt-counter electrodes were prepared by covering an FTO slide with Pt-catalyst T/SP paste by the doctor blade technique; the substrates were then sintered at 450 °C/30 min in air.
Characterization of the ZnO nanoparticles and nanorods was carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI-S-570) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, 120 KV- JEOL 1210 equipped with EDS analyzer LINK QX 2000 X). X-ray powder diffraction analyses between 5 and 120 degrees were carried out in an XRD, RIGAKU Rotaflex RU200 B instrument, using Cu-Kα1 radiation. UV-visible analyses of solutions and thin films were made in a Shimadzu 1800 spectrophotometer.
Solar cell fabrication and characterization
Once prepared, the ITO/ZnO NRs substrates were sensitized in a 0.5 mmol L−1 solution of (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2-(NCS)2] (N-719 dye) at different times and temperatures in order to obtain the optimal dye loading conditions. Platinized FTO counter electrode was then bounded thermally together with the NRs electrode using a hot melt sealing foil (SX1170, Solaronix), the latter ensures the same spacing between electrodes for the electrolyte filling. In the case of long-term measurements, DSC were hermetically sealed with the hot melt sealing foil (SX1170, Solaronix) applying vacuum to introduce the liquid electrolyte by capillary forces. A small piece of glass was then applied to close the filling hole. The solar simulation was carried out with a Steuernagel Solarkonstant KHS1200. Light intensity was adjusted at 1000W m−2 with a bolometric Zipp & Konen CM-4 pyranometer. Calibration of the sun simulator was made by several means applying a calibrated S1227-1010BQ photodiode from Hamamatsu and a mini spectrophotometer from Ava-Spec 4200. The AM1.5G reference spectrum was according to ASTM G173 standard. IV-curves were measured using a Keithley 2601 multimeter connected to a computer and software. The temperature of the experiments was measured constantly with a digital thermohygrometer (HD2301/01, Afora). IPCE analyses were carried out with a QE/IPCE measurement System from Oriel at 10 nm intervals between 300 and 700 nm. The results were not corrected for intensity losses due to light absorption and reflection by the glass support.
Results and discussion
Electrodes of ZnO NRs were grown on ITO substrates at different periods of time from 30 min to 22 h. We have been able to grow ZnO NR as large as 3.5 μm (at 22 h growth time) without the use of any additives. For the purpose of this work, however, we use NRs grown at 6 h which results in vertically-aligned ZnO NRs of 1.6–1.8 μm long as shown in Fig. 1a–b. NRs length increase with increasing reaction time in well agreement with already reported work.6,7 Longer NRs with smaller diameters can be obtained by the careful control of the distance between the ITO substrate and the bottom of the reaction flask.7 Thus, we fixed this distance to be between 6 to 8 cm. The diameter of the majority of the NRs can be found to be around 40 nm, although a few NRs with larger diameters can be observed by SEM analyses (Fig. 1c–d). The image of Fig. 1a also shows a 80 nm thick ZnO dense layer, required to work as buffer layer in a DSC. X-ray diffraction analyses (not shown) of the ZnO nanorods show the presence of ZnO in its wurtzite phase. The [002] peak indicates preferential orientation due to the vertical growth of the NRs on the ITO substrate. TEM analyses confirmed the good crystallinity of the ZnO NRs.

For the fabrication of complete DSCs, ZnO NRs electrodes were sensitized with the Ru(II) complex dye, (Bu4N)2Ru(debpyH)2(NCS), also known as N-719. Dye loading time is known to depend on ZnO NRs length, thus 10 min, 1 h and 2 h were the optimized times found for best solar cell performance for ZnO NRs grown for 2 h (∼0.6 μm), 4 h (∼1.1 μm) and 6 h (∼1.6 μm) respectively. Longer immersion times resulted in a decrease in solar cell efficiency as also observed by other groups. The latter has been attributed to the formation of dye aggregates made by the interaction between the N-719 dye and Zn2+.32,34 An effect also observed for other Ru-based dyes like N3.29,33

Fig. 2 shows the power conversion efficiency of unsealed ZnO-based DSCs depending on ZnO nanorod length (Fig. 2a) and the IV-curves for the best solar cell obtained for each ZnO grown time (Fig. 2b). The photovoltaic performance of ZnO–based DSC is detailed in Table 1. Power conversion efficiency, Voc and Jsc increase with increasing ZnO NR length, as expected. FF is maintain between 35% and 37%. Devices exhibit a semi-transparent appearance in all cases.

We have noticed that many preparation and testing parameters influence final solar cell performance. This behaviour is not surprising since ZnO properties have been reported to be affected by many testing conditions like synthesis methods,10–15 temperature,16,17 testing atmosphere (air, vacuum),18–21 or illumination.22–25 The solar cells reported in this work have been analyzed at 72 °C. Our results, however, show that photovoltaic properties improve when the working temperature decreases from 72 °C down to 25 °C (see supplementary information†). A certain degree of irreproducibility is also observed which we attribute to many factors, for example, the hydrothermal synthesis method. In this case, NRs will never be in the same position and density of the NRs on the ITO substrate. The latter can be envisaged by the error bars included within the graphs in Fig. 1 (dimensions) and Fig. 2 (efficiency). Similar responses have been reported by other authors.37 Another critical factor is relative humidity (RH %) of the testing environment, which seems to have an important effect on solar cell performance: in general, the higher the RH % the lower the solar cell efficiency. More related to the fabrication process of the device is the sealing of the solar cell. We have observed that the power conversion efficiency of the devices decreases on devices that have been filled with electrolyte applying vacuum (filling by capillary forces). For example, the DSC grown for 6 h and shown in Table 1 (efficiency of 0.53% ± 0.04) decreased its performance down to 0.41% efficiency when sealed (see Table 2). Thus, to minimize variations, results shown in each section of this work are the result of the measurement of several solar cells (up to 12) that were fabricated at the same time and conditions, and analyzed under the same testing parameters for each experiment.

In order to analyze the effect of UV light on the performance of ZnO-based DSC we carried out analyses at 1000 W m−2 and 1800 W m−2 and compared the results with similar samples applying a UV filter (<400 nm).

Fig. 3 and Table 2 show the response of three sealed DSC samples, two devices were analyzed at 1000 W m−2 and 1800 W m−2, a third one was analyzed at 1000 W m−2 applying a UV filter. Samples were analyzed at different periods of time while keeping the devices in the dark between measurements. Samples exposed and not-exposed to UV-light at 1000 W m−2 show a difference of about 20% in power conversion efficiency. Increasing light irradiation from 1000 W m−2 to 1800 W m−2 (no UV filter) also leads to an increase in solar cell efficiency. In general, the higher the light irradiation the larger the increase in efficiency, as expected (Fig. 3a). The behaviour of the sample applying the UV filter was characterized by good stability with null efficiency variation for the first 50 h of testing. On the contrary, when the UV filter was not applied, the behaviour of the samples was similar: an initial increase in power conversion efficiency is observed, followed by a stabilization period at about 180 h and, finally, a decrease in solar cell performance after the first ∼200 h of testing (not shown). Reproducibility of these results was observed to be within ±5%. The effect that UV light has on ZnO has been linked to the chemisorption of organic molecules23–26,28 which agrees with the observed solar cell efficiency increase.

IPCE analyses performed on the DSCs revealed two maxima (Fig. 4), the first one at ∼370 nm and a second one at ∼520 nm in good correspondence with the UV-vis analyses of the N-719 dye and in good agreement with previous reported results.32,44,45 IPCE values as high as 23% at 370 nm and up to 16% at 520 nm were found. We observed that different series of measurements gave different IPCE values. The latter has also been observed before,32 and it is not surprising taking into account that ZnO-based DSC present some irreproducibility (see error bars in Fig. 1 and 2) and that solar cell performance varies with time, as discussed before. Moreover, we have not observed the latter response in DSCs using TiO2, suggesting that this behaviour is linked to the ZnO itself. The difficulty of finding direct correlation between IPCE and power conversion efficiency of the solar cells is probably due to the balance between the two IPCE peaks. Fig. 4 shows IPCE values observed for DSC made with ZnO NRs grown over 6 h. The analyses were made at different periods of time: freshly prepared, once the efficiency increased after 24 h, and once the device was completely degraded at 720 h. A general trend in IPCE was a slight initial increase of the ∼370 nm maximum, which stabilizes with time, and the gradual disappearance of the maximum at ∼520 nm. It is particlarly remarkable, however, that the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell increases after UV light irradiation, while the IPCE peak at 520 nm decreases and the one at 370 nm increases.

In order to understand IPCE changes, and to correlate these processes with the solar cell performance and lifetime observed before, we carried out UV-vis studies of the interaction between the N-719 dye and the ZnO. The analyses were made to a N-719 dye/ZnO NRs dispersion made by mixing 0.002g of ZnO NRs (scratched from the ITO surface) in 3 ml of a 0.01 mM of N-719 dye in absolute ethanol (99.95%). We choose to work in these conditions (instead of using a ITO/ZnO/dye electrode) to monitor the evolution of the dye/ZnO NRs dispersion excluding the possibility of external effects like the presence of the electrolyte used for the DSC. The as-prepared dispersion was separated in 3 parts and each part was stirred constantly during the experiment. The dispersions were kept sealed (in air) in the UV-cuvette during the time the experiment took place (about 1 week). One part of the dispersion was kept in the dark (a) as a reference, the other two were irradiated under the sun simulator at 1000 W m−2 with (b) and without (c) the application of an UV-VIS filter (<400 nm). UV-Vis analyses were performed at different periods of time from 0 to 192 h. The samples (b) and (c) were kept in the dark between measurements and subjected to irradiation under the sun simulator for 5 min under constant stirring before each measurement.

Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis spectra obtained at different periods of time for the three samples: a) kept in the dark, b) irradiated applying an UV-filter and c) irradiated without UV-filter. For comparison purposes the UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye and the ZnO suspension are also included. Two absorption bands corresponding to the N-719 dye are observed at ∼380 nm and ∼525 nm, ZnO NRs absorb at ∼375 nm as also shown in Fig. 5. The absorption bands of the dye have already been attributed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer, specifically the absorption at ∼380 nm corresponds to intraligand (π–π*) charge transfer transition.46

At the start of the experiment, the two absorption bands initially observed, stay unaltered for a period of about 24 h for the sample kept in the dark (Fig. 5a). In the case of the samples irradiated with the application of a UV filter, the maximum at 580 nm increases slightly and stabilizes for about 24 h (Fig. 5b). In the case of the sample irradiated with UV light (Fig. 5c) the absorption bands were observed to be unaffected for only 5 h but then, the maximum at ∼380 nm starts to increase in intensity while the maximum at ∼525 nm remains unchanged. After this, a sudden blue-shift of the peak at ∼525 nm is registered for all the samples, moving from ∼525 nm down to ∼505 nm, until the complete suppression of the peak with time, especially noticeable for the sample irradiated with UV light. Regardless of the sample, we observed similar changes for all the dye-ZnO NRs suspensions with time which are similar to that observed by Keis et al. who defined these processes as steps between agglomeration, dissolution and [Zn+2-dye] complex formation.32
These changes are clearer if we analyze each absorption band separately as shown in Fig. 6 where the evolution with time of each of the two absorption bands is shown. The absorption band at ∼380 nm presents a slight blue shift towards ∼370 nm but no significant changes are observed for any of the 3 samples. In the case of the absorption band at ∼525 nm changes are more evident: strong blue shift is observed for the 3 samples with time, especially for the sample subjected to UV light for which absorption band disappears completely after 50 h of testing. The disappearance of this peak is linked to the formation of a deprotonated form, weak electron coupling and the detachment of the SCN- group of the N-719 dye.47,48 H. G. Agrell et al., reported similar results when analyzing a TiO2/N-719 dye electrode in air.46 Also worth mentioning is the fact that in that work, both dye absorption bands at ∼400 nm and ∼550 nm are suppressed after 840 h when exposed to air and light, and the UV-VIS spectra is shown to be featureless at the end of the experiment.46 In our case, the peak at ∼380 nm does not disappear, it initially increases in absorption intensity and then stabilizes with time. These differences are clearly linked to the semiconductor oxide used, TiO2 or ZnO. On TiO2 the dye is degraded completely (in air) and both dye absorption bands disappear from the UV-vis spectra.46 In the case of ZnO, the degradation of the dye is accompanied by the dissolution of the ZnO and the formation of a new compound: a [Zn+2-dye] complex. The peak at ∼380 nm is observed to shift slightly to lower wavelengths (Fig. 6a) approaching the ZnO maximum at ∼374 nm which supports the formation of a new [Zn+2-dye] compound. These changes are observed regardless of the sample and type of treatment (dark, UV light or vis light), with the only difference that the process is faster for the sample subjected to UV irradiation. The latter indicates that UV light enhances dye chemisorption and ZnO solubility, to greater extent than visible light. Our results also confirm that even storage of the solar cells in the dark can lead to degradation of the ZnO with time. The UV light induced dye chemisorption has a great influence on solar cell efficiency increase and has also been observed by other groups.39,40 Moreover, changes observed in the UV-vis analyses have good correlation with the analyses of the DSC with time shown in Fig. 3, and also with the IPCE analyses of the devices show in Fig. 4. A 10-fold efficiency increase has been reported for TiO2-based DSC when irradiated by UV light and applying the E322 dye.48

Conclusions
In this work we report a 20% solar cell efficiency increase due to the effect of UV-light irradiation on ZnO vertically-aligned nanorod electrodes applied to DSC. The interaction between the N719 dye and the ZnO nanorods seem to take place in 3 well-defined steps: dye diffusion, dye chemisorption and [Zn+2-dye] complex formation. We report a direct correlation of these processes to the lifetime of the DSC and IPCE analyses. We have also observed that these processes occur regardless of the application or not of a UV filter or if the device is stored in the dark. The only difference is the time at which each process takes place, the sample irradiated with UV light being the one showing faster degradation. Current research is being performed on the interaction of ZnO with different dyes, polymers and electrolytes.

Broader context
ZnO is a promising semiconductor oxide to be employed in dye sensitized solar cells, and beyond. The possibility to obtain this material in a wide variety of nano-forms through easy and scalable synthesis techniques has already been demonstrated by many research groups. Power conversion efficiencies of 5–6%, have been achieved when applied in dye sensitized solar cells. Thus, the subsequent step is the study and understanding of ZnO behavior under different conditions. The latter will allow us to tune its properties to improve DSC efficiency but specially to fabricate long-lasting devices. In this work, we report the effect of different testing conditions on dye sensitized solar cells based on vertically-aligned ZnO nanorods (NRs). We describe the many different conditions that affect ZnO NR synthesis and, as a consequence, the impact on final device performance. Especial emphasis is made on the effect that UV light has on power conversion efficiency and solar cell lifetime.
