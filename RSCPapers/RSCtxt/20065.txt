    , Accepted 21st September 2021First published on 24th September 2021AbstractThe III–V semiconductor GaN is a promising material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells, however the large bandgap of 3.45 eV is a considerable hindrance for the absorption of visible light. Therefore, the substitution of small amounts of N anions by isovalent Sb is a promising route to lower the bandgap and thus increase the PEC activity under visible light. Herein we report a new chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process utilizing the precursors bis(N,N′-diisopropyl-2-methyl-amidinato)-methyl gallium (III) and triphenyl antimony (TPSb) for the growth of GaSbxN1−x alloys. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements show crystalline and homogeneous thin films at deposition temperatures in the range of 500–800 °C. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) combined with nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) shows an incorporation of 0.2–0.7 at% antimony into the alloy, which results in a slight bandgap decrease (up to 0.2 eV) accompanied by enhanced sub-bandgap optical response. While the resulting photoanodes are active under visible light, the external quantum efficiencies remained low. Intriguingly, the best performing films exhibits the lowest charge carrier mobility according to time resolved THz spectroscopy (TRTS) and microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements, which showed mobilities of up to 1.75 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.2 × 10–2 cm2 V−1 s−1, for each timescale, respectively.
Introduction
In pursuit of alternative ways to generate renewable fuel sources, solar driven water splitting has gained great scientific interest in recent years. Photoanodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting applications require a semiconducting material with a bandgap in the range of 1.7 to 2.2 eV. Additionally, the band edges need to straddle the H2/O2 redox potentials.1 A highly promising material in this regard is GaN, which shows high stability during photoelectrolysis and exhibits matching band edges. However, it features a wide (direct) bandgap of 3.45 eV and therefore only absorbs light in the UV region.2 In order to overcome this issue, the bandgap can be engineered toward more desired, lower values by alloying GaN with other materials. This way ternary and quaternary compounds can be formed, which exhibit more favourable electronic properties, while retaining encouraging properties, like PEC stability from their parent compound. To this end, several reports have been published during the last decade. For example GaON3 and GaN:ZnO4 have been investigated as potential photoabsorbers in the visible light range. Interestingly, the ternary material InxGa1−xN is the most explored among the GaN derivatives.5–7 While it was possible to narrow the bandgap to a desired value of approximately 2 eV, the required amount of In was found to be over 50 at%. This resulted in a considerable increase in material cost and a tendency toward phase segregation of the alloy.8,9 Instead of substituting the cations of GaN, isovalent anions, like As, Sb and Bi, can be used as dopants with bandgap narrowing effects.10–13 Due to the considerable size difference compared to N, the resulting materials are referred to as highly mismatched alloys (HMAs).10–13 This particular kind of anion substitution can influence the electronic band structure of the material to a larger degree than conventional alloying, due to the band anticrossing (BAC).14,15 Hence, HMAs are reported as promising materials for PEC water splitting, as their relatively narrow bandgaps compared to GaN, enable the absorption of a greater fraction of the sunlight, while their band edges remain at energies sufficient for water splitting.10 According to the BAC model, smaller amounts of Sb than As are necessary in order to narrow the bandgap to the desired value, indicating that a larger mismatch in terms of anion size in the photoactive material is beneficial.16,17
Theoretical reports on GaNxSb1−x in the dilute nitrogen region show electronic bandgap narrowing to negative values for ∼8 at% N.1,18–21 On the other hand, for the dilute antimony regime, reported theoretical work is scarce.22 Experimentally, Sunkara et al. fabricated GaSbxN1−x in the dilute antimony regime via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) utilizing the highly volatile but hazardous precursors trimethyl gallium (TMG) and trimethyl antimonide (TMSb). They show that even low Sb contents in the range 1–8 at% reduce the observed bandgap values to approximately 2 eV, while simultaneously retaining the desired band positions straddling the potentials of the water splitting reaction.23,24 The fact that the observed bandgap reduction is presumed to originate primarily from the shift of the valence band edge to higher energies, shows the great potential for optimization of the bandgap energy in this manner.24 A considerable challenge in the fabrication of this material system is the comparably low degree of crystallinity, which leads to high rates of recombination.25 Increased deposition temperatures may counteract this issue, however the induction of phase segregation and maintaining of a sufficient Sb incorporation, have been shown to be problematic at higher temperatures, using the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique.26
MOCVD is a promising technology to fabricate III–V semiconductors, as this technology enables superior interface quality to the underlying substrate, is readily scalable and results in high quality thin films. GaN based thin films have been mainly deposited using the alkyl class of precursors, like TMG and triethyl gallium (TEG), which are pyrophoric and therefore difficult to handle.27,28 In our previous work, we have identified bis(N,N′-diisopropyl-2-methyl-amidinato) methyl gallium (III) [Ga(Me)(dpamd)2] [1] as a suitable precursor for the deposition of Ga2O3via MOCVD, which is non-pyrophoric.29 Referring to a matching antimony precursor, there are complexes which are already known and have been applied in CVD based techniques. Like other group III elements, the most common Sb compounds are the alkyls. Trimethyl antimony (TMSb) for instance is well known and has already been applied in the synthesis of GaSb and GaNxSb1−x thin films.23,30,31 However, due to its pyrophoric and toxic nature32 and high volatility, TMSb is not suitable for this study, especially since only small amounts of Sb are to be incorporated in the film. Therefore, triphenyl antimony (TPSb, [2]), which exhibits a much lower vapor pressure was the precursor of choice in this study.
Herein, we present the synthesis of alloyed GaSbxN1−x thin films via a CVD approach in the dilute antimony regime, using the precursor compounds TPSb, and [Ga(Me)(dpamd)2]. The precursors were analysed via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). GaSbxN1−x films were analysed regarding their structure, composition and morphology via X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry combined with nuclear reaction analysis (RBS/NRA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. Films deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) and quartz were investigated regarding the optical and PEC properties via UV-Vis spectroscopy and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements. Furthermore, the charge carrier mobility was investigated employing time resolved THz spectroscopy (TRTS) and time resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements.
Results and discussion
For the investigation of the thermal properties of compounds [1] and [2], and to evaluate the optimum conditions to employ them in a CVD process, TGA studies were performed under inert conditions. Comparing the TGA curves of both compounds, Fig. 1a reveals promising thermal properties and the results are summarised in Table 1. Evidently, both compounds evaporate in a single-step mass loss with very low residual masses. The onset of volatilization (1% mass loss) was determined for the gallium and antimony precursor at 95 and 174 °C respectively. The endothermic events in the DSC curves at 104 and 57 °C can be assigned to melting points of [1] and [2] respectively. As the dopant-delivering precursor, TPSb exhibits a considerably higher onset of evaporation and therefore a lower evaporation rate at similar temperatures. To quantify this difference, stepped isothermal studies and vapor pressure estimations were conducted. The resulting Clausius–Clapeyron plots are shown in Fig. 1b.33

As a measure of comparison, the temperature necessary to generate a vapor pressure of 1 Torr is frequently used as a benchmark (T1 Torr). This value is estimated to be 104 °C for [1] and 175 °C for [2]. Similarly, the molar evaporation rates at a given temperature can be deduced from these experiments. For a temperature of 90 °C, which is later used as evaporation temperature during CVD experiments, the molar evaporation rates of [1] and [2] are found to be 100 nmol min−1 cm2 and 11 nmol min−1 cm2 respectively.
To validate [1] as a precursor for CVD, depositions of binary GaN using NH3 as a co-reactant were conducted. Structural and compositional analysis of the binary GaN host thin films can be found in the ESI (Fig. S1 and Table S1†), showing that compound [1] enables deposition of GaN thin films between 500 °C to 700 °C. In this temperature range, the as-deposited GaN thin films are polycrystalline (Fig. S1†). The purity of the layers is high, with approximately 5 at% carbon impurities in the thin films grown in a temperature range of 500 °C to 600 °C (Table S1†).
Based on this binary process, TPSb was introduced from a second precursor reservoir, while temperature and flow rate variations were conducted. The thicknesses of the deposited films were estimated via spectral reflectivity, utilizing a GaN model. The data are summarized in an Arrhenius plot in Fig. 2a depicting the film thicknesses and corresponding growth rates. For the films deposited at an NH3 flowrate of 70 sccm, an increasing growth rate from 8 nm, over 39 nm to 265 nm is observed between 400 °C to 600 °C. The linear increase in the Arrhenius plot may hint to a kinetically controlled growth regime. At higher temperatures (600 °C–700 °C), the film thickness remains nearly constant, (∼200 nm) independent of NH3 flow rate except for the layer deposited at 800 °C and an NH3 flow rate of 30 sccm.

Asterisk denotes substrate reflections and detector effects. 
To investigate the elemental composition of the alloyed thin films, RBS/NRA was employed. Table 2 gives an overview of the material composition and the respective amount of alloyed antimony as a fraction of the anionic species. Almost all films are gallium rich exhibiting a Ga/(N + Sb) ratio of 1 to 1.5, increasing with decreasing temperature. This can be explained by the simultaneously rising oxygen incorporation, as the ammonia decomposition kinetics proceed considerably slower at lower temperatures, thus resulting in a high oxide contribution, probably due to minor reactor leaks. These oxide contributions may possibly result in additional GaO or GaON phases inside the deposits. The antimony contents of deposited GaSbxN1−x thin films were estimated to be in the range of 0.2 to 0.7 at% with respect to the deposited N species. Even though the Sb incorporation is considerably smaller than in the reports by Sunkara et al., the band narrowing effect should still be observable on this scale of doping.23 The fact that the Sb content increases with higher ammonia flowrates, indicates that the GaN and GaSb deposition reactions are not competing. Instead, ammonia appears to enhance the reactivity of the TPSb precursor. Apart from films grown at 400 °C and 800 °C with 30 sccm NH3, a low carbon contamination of below 5 at% was detected. For the outliers, incomplete precursor decomposition may be the reason probably caused by low temperature or the low amount of reactive gas.

The deposited films were analysed using XRD to identify their structure. The XRD patterns of the GaSbxN1−x thin films are depicted in Fig. 2b and c, showing four dominant reflections of Wurtzite type GaN. Particularly, the (100), (002), (101) and (110) at 32.5°, 34.6°, 36.6° and 58.1° reflections respectively. There are no reflections present which could be assigned to cubic GaSb, attributed to the small concentration of antimony inside the GaN thin films. This is in line with other studies considering the dilute antimony level.16 Interestingly, a shift of the (002) reflection, as described by Sunkara et al., could not be detected, and the reflection shifts would likely be small for such dilute incorporation.23 At low growth temperatures (400 °C–500 °C) no reflections could be observed. This could either be an effect of low film thickness or a low degree of crystallinity or even a combination of both. At 600 °C and 700 °C, the (100) reflection is the most prominent, with the (110) and (101) reflections showing less intensity. Interestingly, at 800 °C the growth mode appears to change, and the previously observed reflections vanish, while the (002) reflection arises simultaneously. When the NH3 flow rate is reduced at a deposition temperature of 600 °C, the reflection intensity reduces simultaneously along with the reduction in film thickness. For the NH3 flow reduction at 800 °C, another change in growth mode can be observed as the (110) reflection becomes more prominent again. This indicates a higher structural similarity to the films deposited at lower temperatures.
To investigate the microstructure of the alloyed thin films, SEM images depicted in Fig. 3 were recorded. From the top view images, polycrystalline layers were formed which is in accordance with the findings in XRD. No clear crystallite shapes corresponding to the wurtzite structure could be observed. Interestingly, a decreased NH3 flow rate (Fig. 3b and c) during the deposition results in more flake like features.

Evidently, at higher temperatures (800 °C) the crystallite size increases drastically, resulting in more defined crystallites (Fig. 3d). From the cross sections (inset), the film thicknesses are in accordance with estimates via spectral reflectivity. Furthermore, all the films appear to be dense and columnar grain growth can be observed for the films deposited at 800 °C (Fig. 3d).
Optical properties of the thin films deposited on FTO-glass at 600 °C were analysed by UV-Vis spectroscopy and assuming the direct character of the optical transition.34 The fundamental bandgap energy estimated from the Tauc plot was 3.4 eV for the electrode deposited at 30 sccm NH3 and therefore containing the lowest amount of Sb (0.4 at%, I) as well as the highest oxide contribution. Films deposited at higher NH3 flow rates and therefore higher Sb content of 0.6 and 0.7 at% (II & III) showed a red shift of the fundamental bandgap energy by about 0.2 eV (see Fig. 4 and Table 2). Notably, all layers reveal a significant absorption shoulder with a Tauc gap at ca. 2.8 eV. This shoulder might be due to a GaON contribution originating from oxygen impurities.35 Accordingly, films deposited at higher NH3 flow rates (II, III) appear yellow to the naked eye, while the one deposited at 30 sccm NH3 (I) is white. Given the comparable thicknesses of the films (Fig. 2a), this effect could be explained by the weak light absorption properties for the latter film as confirmed by relatively low absorption coefficient compared to the thin yellow films (Fig. S2†). Interestingly, the IPCE and corresponding photocurrents recorded in the presence of sodium sulphite as a sacrificial electron donor are the highest for the white-appearing photoanode I for both the electrolyte (front side, FS) and the substrate (back side, BS) sides of irradiation over the UV and Vis range (Fig. 5 and Fig. S3†). FS-IPCE for all three electrodes are higher than BS-IPCE values suggesting that the hole transport limits the performance of the compact films. Notably, at the whitish photoanode I (30 sccm NH3) the difference between the IPCE values recorded under the BS and FS is not that large compared to the two yellowish films deposited at higher NH3 flow rates (II, III). This suggests that the improved hole transport properties in film I are responsible for its overall superior PEC performance. Since the photocurrent onset potential corresponding roughly to the conduction band edge is comparable for all three films (approx. 0.7 V vs. RHE, Fig. S4†), we conclude that the photocurrent response is negatively influenced by modification of the valence band and the hole transport properties due to the substitution of N by Sb.

Although the film deposited at 30 sccm NH3 with the lowest doping level of Sb exhibits the weakest optical absorption in the visible (Fig. 5), it shows the highest IPCE values due to better hole conductivity. Note that the spike-like behaviour of the photocurrent transients (Fig. S3†) typically indicates significant surface and/or sub-surface recombination. Interestingly, the spike-like behaviour could be reduced by increasing the substrate temperature to 800 °C under 50 sccm NH3 flow (deposition on glassy carbon due to instability of FTO at such high temperatures). However, the overall quantum efficiencies and photocurrents decreased (Fig. S5†).
In addition to the stationary photocurrent measurements, we performed contactless time resolved photoconductivity measurements in the picosecond (ps) to microsecond (μs) range to gain more insight into excited carrier lifetime and photocarrier transport mechanism. The early time window was addressed with TRTS and the later window with TRMC.

Fig. 6a shows the TRTS transients of the three films grown at 600 °C on non-conducting quartz substrates using the same deposition parameters as for FTO.

Fig. 6b depicts the real and imaginary part of the TRTS mobility spectra collected at a delay time of 5 ps between the fs laser excitation pulse and the ps THz probe pulse. The mobility is depicted as the product of ∑μ and φ, which represents the absorbance-normalized quantum yield. The highest mobility of 1.75 cm2 V−1 s−1 was found for the film deposited at 50 sccm NH3 (0.7 at% Sb) although the film deposited at 70 sccm NH3 (0.6 at% Sb) looks quite similar. Extrapolation of the real part of the mobility towards lower THz frequencies suggests a DC mobility of around 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1. These values are slightly better than for most low bandgap metal oxides but remain poor compared to pure III–V compounds.36,37 Deposition with 30 sccm NH3 flow rates and therefore lower Sb ratio leads to a further decrease in mobility. The frequency response of Fig. 6b shows the real part of the conductivity increasing towards higher frequencies and the imaginary part decreasing with negative values which can be typically described by the Drude–Smith mode.38–40 The model is characteristic for trapped or bound carriers combined with a thermally activated charge transport mechanism. The low IPCE values support this assumption.
The decay dynamics exhibit only small differences on the ps to ns time scale with an initial loss of conductivity of around 50% already in the first few ps and a slow decaying conductivity part that persists beyond 1.5 ns. The measured photoconductivity Δσ is proportional to the product of the density of photoexcited electron–hole pairs neh and the sum ∑μ of the combined electron and hole mobility, μe and μh: Δσ = eneh(μe + μh) = eneh∑μ.(1)
TRMC transients measured in a longer time window from ns to ms are shown in Fig. 7a for the same three films on quartz as described above. Like in the TRTS experiments, the microwave conductance is given by the product of the charge carrier generation yield and combined electron and hole mobility. The maximum TRMC mobility is obtained from the conductive transient peak assuming no major recombination losses at this early time. The ns decay dynamics follow a similar trend as found in the ps-resolved THz measurements with the highest mobility value of around 1.2 × 10–2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the film deposited with 50 sccm NH3 flow (0.7 at% Sb). The transients drop by about 50% of their initial value within 50 ns and then cross over into small longer-lived tails that decay on the μs scale. Fig. 7b displays the TRMC peak mobilities derived at the maximum of the transients in dependence of the laser excitation intensity. The drop-off towards higher excitation photon-flux is indicative of higher order carrier-carrier recombination effects induced by the intense laser pulse.
 Fig. 7  (a) TRMC photoconductivity transients for GaSbxN1−x layers containing 0.6 at% (red), 0.7 at% (blue) and 0.4 at% of Sb (green), excitation with 1013 photons per cm2 per pulse; (b) Peak mobility dependence on laser intensity. 
Again, assuming no recombination losses in the available THz time window (see Fig. 6a), the mobility has declined to about 10% of its initial maximum value at a delay time of 1.5 ns. Due to lower time resolution, the peak mobility of 1.2 × 10–2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the microwave experiment is measured roughly 10 ns later with respect to the THz conductivity peak. This means that almost an order of magnitude of photoconductivity within the non-addressable time range between the two techniques is lost. Together with the higher DC mobility of ∼0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, extrapolated from the THz mobility spectra (Fig. 6b) at early times when recombination is expected lowest, suggests that the mobility retrieved by TRMC is even much lower according to formula (1). The TRTS and TRMC transients thus suggest multiple trapping/recombination processes occurring on all different time scales with a decrease of mobility and carrier recombination loss in parallel. However, at the current stage it is not possible to discern between the two decay mechanisms. As mentioned above, the film with the lowest doping level of Sb exhibits the highest IPCE values but not the highest mobility measured by TRTS and TRMC. The discrepancy may be possibly attributed to differences in bulk (i.e., grain boundaries) and reduced surface carrier lifetime. This suggests that IPCE could potentially be improved with future effective surface modification to reduce recombination combined with enhanced absorption properties and mobility of GaSbxN1−x films with higher Sb content.
Conclusion
A new MOCVD approach for the deposition of GaSbxN1−x thin films in the dilute antimony regime is reported. The deposited layers are crystalline and exhibit a rough surface morphology as revealed by XRD and SEM respectively. Under optimized process conditions, the antimony content was found to be in a range of 0.2 to 0.7 at% for thin films with a thickness of ∼200 nm after a deposition time of 30 min, exhibiting reasonable carbon impurities as determined via RBS/NRA. Rather poor quantum efficiencies even in the presence of the sacrificial electron donor and low charge carrier mobilities are attributed to the suppressed hole transport through the films, which therefore could in future be addressed by nanostructuring of the films or by further reducing the defect density e.g., by epitaxial growth. In order to enable efficient water oxidation to dioxygen, further optimization steps should also include the deposition of proper cocatalysts.41–44 The film with the lowest Sb incorporation resulted in the highest IPCE, while charge carrier mobility measurements indicate the opposite trend. Whether these poor functional properties are an effect of the Sb doping or originate from oxygen impurities will be the subject of future studies.
Experimental
Precursor synthesis and characterization
[Ga(Me)(dpamd)2] (1) is a known compound and was firstly used as precursor for the deposition of gallium oxide via MOCVD.29 It was synthesized following the literature synthesis steps. TPSb (2) is commercially available and was used as received from Sigma Aldrich.
TG analysis was conducted on a Netzsch STA409 PC/PG at ambient pressure situated in an Ar filled glovebox (sample size 15 mg). A heating ramp of 5 °C min−1 and nitrogen (AirLiquide, 99.998%) flow rate of 90 sccm was employed. Simultaneous DSC allowed the determination of the melting points. The 1 Torr vapor pressure temperatures and molar evaporation rates were deduced from stepped isothermal measurements. Approximately 50 mg of the precursor was heated over a ramp of 10 K min−1 to the individual step with a step size of 10 K. Each step was held for 15 min. Calculation of the aforementioned variables was conducted according to literature.33
Thin film deposition
Film depositions via CVD were performed in a custom-built horizontal cold-wall reactor with a base pressure of the order of 4 × 10–5 mbar.45 Prior to film depositions, the 1 cm2 Si(100) substrates (Microchemicals GmbH) or FTO coated 1.5 × 2.5 cm2 Pilkington TEC Glass (Xop glass, sheet resistance 12–14 Ω □−1) were cleaned using a sequence of sonication in 2–propanol (HPLC grade) and water (HPLC grade) to remove surface contaminations. The evaporation temperatures were set to 120 and 90 °C for the Sb and Ga precursor reservoirs respectively. Nitrogen (99.999%) was used as carrier gas, and all depositions were performed in the presence of dry ammonia as co-reactant (50 sccm). GaN and alloyed GaSbxN1−x layers were grown in a temperature range from 500 to 800 °C with a carrier gas flow rate of 100 sccm, transporting the precursors simultaneously (for GaN thin films, no Sb precursor was employed) into the reaction chamber. The deposition time was set to 60 min.
Thin film characterization
Film thicknesses were determined using a FILMETRICS F20 spectral reflectivity refractometer. To investigate the crystallinity and phase evolution of the films, XRD analyses were performed with a Bruker AXS D8 Advance Diffractometer (θ–2θ Bragg Brentano geometry) by using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, 2θ = 20–60°). The film morphology was analysed by SEM with a JEOL JSM-7200F field-emission SEM. Imaging was performed using a backscattering electron detector (BED) and secondary electron detector (SED). To determine the film composition, RBS/NRA was performed at RUBION, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. The RBS detector was placed at 160° in Cornell geometry. For NRA measurements a deuteron beam with an energy of 1 MeV was guided onto the samples tilted by an angle of 7°. Protons emitted due to nuclear reactions with light elements were detected at an angle of 135° by a detector in IBM geometry, which was shielded with a 6 μm Ni foil to eliminate elastically scattered deuterons. The resulting RBS/NRA spectra were analysed with the program SIMNRA.46 The UV-Vis spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer, equipped with a 50 mm integration sphere, allowing to measure diffuse reflectance and diffuse transmittance spectra with a reference to BaSO4 and FTO-glass respectively. Absorption coefficients of the materials were calculated using the following formula:  where A is absorptance and d is the film thickness. The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded in standard three-electrode configuration consisting of a photoanode working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) reference electrode by employing a photoelectric spectrometer (Instytut Fotonowy Sp. z o.o.) equipped with a tuneable monochromatic light source provided with a 150 W Xenon lamp and a grating monochromator with a bandwidth of ∼10 nm. The value of photocurrent density was the difference between current density under irradiation and in the dark in steady-state conditions with a wavelength sampling interval of 10 nm. The IPCE value for each wavelength was calculated according to equation:  where iph is the photocurrent density, h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light, P is the light power density, λ is the irradiation wavelength, and q is the elementary charge.
Terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS) was based on a THz spectrometer (home-built) that was driven by a Coherent RegA femtosecond laser system comprising a Vitara Ti:sapphire oscillator seeding a 150 kHz regenerative amplifier.47 The amplified pulses with typical autocorrelation length of 70 fs (FWHM) and a maximum energy of 7 μJ at a wavelength of 800 nm were used for both sample excitation and THz probe pulse generation via optical rectification. The samples were excited by frequency doubled laser pulses at 400 nm. THz detection was performed via electro-optic sampling. The obtained signal with sub-ps time resolution is proportional to the photoconductivity at THz frequencies.
TRMC measurements were performed using a diode-pumped Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (EKSPLA NT230-50-SH/SF) as the excitation source driving a wavelength tuneable optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The wavelength was tuned to 400 nm and the pulse length was ∼3 ns. A detailed description of the TRMC setup as well as data analysis can be found elsewhere.48
