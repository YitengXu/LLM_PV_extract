    , Accepted 26th August 2018First published on 29th August 2018AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have many advantages, but the use of expensive platinum counter electrodes (CEs) limits their industrial applications. In this work, a Co–Ni/carbon aerogel composite with a unique three-dimensional network structure and high specific surface area was prepared through simple ion exchange and carbonization of low-cost sodium alginate supramolecular hydrogels. Using this metal/carbon aerogel composite as the CE (hereafter denoted as CAE) of ZnO-based DSSCs, a photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.08% was obtained. This value was 94.44% of the PCE obtained using Pt. Analysis of current–voltage curves, cyclic voltammograms, and electrochemical impedance spectra revealed that the fabricated CAE had higher catalytic activity than a Pt CE and comparable charge-transfer ability. The adhesion of the CAE onto FTO was also strong with carbon paste as an adhesive.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been extensively researched for more than 20 years. Some of these studies have focused on identifying replacements for the expensive Pt counter electrode (CE),1 which has relatively negative redox potentials and is susceptible to corrosion caused by I−/I3− redox shuttling. These features lead to substantially decreased Jsc and Voc. To produce low-cost CE materials with high conductivity and excellent electrocatalytic activity, various substitutes for the Pt CE such as carbon materials,2–4 metallic compounds,5–7 alloys,8–10 and conductive polymers11–13 have been tested. Aerogels with network nanostructures, large surface areas, and good mechanical properties have very promising applications in energy-storage devices. In 2011, Tan et al.14 used carbon aerogels as CEs for DSSCs for the first time. They obtained 9.06% efficiency, which is close to that obtained using platinum. In 2014, Jie et al. synthesized15 a nanotube/graphene aerogel and used it as Pt-free transparent CEs in DSSCs. The power-conversion efficiency (8.31%) of these DSSCs was higher than that using Pt (7.56%). In 2015, Chen et al.16 reported the use of carbon aerogels with ultralow density and three-dimensional network nanostructures as electrocatalysts for the reduction of tri-iodide in DSSCs. Their catalyst showed superior catalytic activity over that of Pt. In 2012, Xinliang Feng et al. used graphene aerogel supported nano-Fe3O4 as an efficient catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction for the first time, and demonstrated the advantage of a 3D metal or metal oxide/graphene-based catalyst. In 2018, Ning Wang et al.17 fabricated a CNT aerogel for the first time and then immobilized CoS2 into this aerogel by the process of hydrothermal synthesis. The obtained carbon nanotube aerogel–CoS2 hybrid catalytic CEs achieved a maximum PCE of 8.28%, which exceeded that of the conventional platinum (Pt)-based DSSC (7.20%). These composites have the conductivity of carbon in combination with the catalytic activity of metals, which are the dual requirements of CEs. Based on the above conclusions, we forecast that metal/carbon aerogel composites would be a very suitable material for CEs.
In this work, a Co–Ni/carbon aerogel composite with a unique three-dimensional network structure and high specific surface area was prepared through simple ion exchange and carbonization of low-cost sodium alginate supramolecular hydrogels. The obtained Co–Ni/carbon aerogel was used as the CE (hereafter denoted as CAE) of ZnO-based DSSCs for the first time, and its photovoltaic performance was studied.
Experimental details
Materials
The main chemicals used in this work were obtained from Aladdin, such as acetic ether, LiI, LiClO4, etc. The sodium hydrate and zinc nitrate used to fabricate ZnO nanorods and the carbon ink used as an adhesive were purchased from Shenzhen Dong Da Lai Company. N719 dye and the electrolyte were purchased from GreatCell Solar Company (Dyesol company).
Methods

Co–Ni/carbon aerogel preparation. 
First, sodium alginate was dissolved to give a 1 wt% solution. Then, 90 mL of sodium alginate solution was added dropwise to 150 mL of a 5 wt% Co(NO3)2·6H2O and NiCl2·6H2O aqueous solution to final Ni2+/Co2+ molar ratios of 0:4, 1:3, 1:1, 3:1, and 4:0.18 After stirring for 1 h, the mixture was centrifuged, washed thrice with water, and freeze-dried. The mixture was transferred into a tube furnace in an Ar atmosphere and calcined using a temperature-programmed technique described as follows: (1) the temperature was increased to 256 °C at 2 °C min−1 and maintained for 1 h, and (2) the temperature was increased further to 700 °C at 5 °C min−1 and maintained for another 1 h.19 After calcination, the mixture was cooled naturally to room temperature. The obtained porous Co–Ni/carbon aerogel composite was labeled as CoxNiy (x and y are the values corresponding to the Ni2+/Co2+ molar ratio, respectively).


Fabrication of CAEs. 
A 2 mL grinding pot containing 0.04 g of Co–Ni/carbon aerogel, 0.14 g of carbon slurry,20 1.3 g of zirconia balls, and 0.24 mL of ethyl acetate was fixed on a shaker and milled at 1500 rpm for 2 h to prepare a slurry. The doctor-blade technique was used to uniformly spread a small amount of the prepared slurry composed of the Co–Ni/carbon aerogel onto FTO conductive glass. After drying, the sample was annealed at 250 °C and CAEs were obtained. To compare the adhesion ability, another CE was prepared by the same method but ethyl cellulose was the adhesive used (this CE was denoted as CH-EC). The fabricated electrodes were dried at 150 °C for 0.5 h. The scraped active area, measured to be 7 × 7 mm2, was then annealed in a nitrogen atmosphere at 400 °C for 1 h. For comparative studies, Pt CEs were fabricated by pyrolyzing H2PtCl6 on FTO glass as previously reported. The ZnO paste with 60 nm particle size was prepared using a solid-state reaction,21 and the doctor-blade technique was used to fabricate ZnO photoanode films (active area = 5 × 5 mm2). Then, the ZnO photoanode was sensitized with 0.5 mM N719 dye in ethanol solution at 60 °C for 1 h. The electrolyte for the solar cell was composed of LiI (0.03 M), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (0.6 M), I2 (0.03 M), 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M), and guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile (0.1 M). The architecture of the DSSCs was assembled by sandwiching the electrolyte with the sensitized ZnO photoanode and a CE. The reference CE used was CH-EC.22

Characterization
Raman spectra were recorded on a Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution, HORBIBA). The structure was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with CuKα irradiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The morphologies and microstructures were observed by field-emission gun-scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM; JSM-7600F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JSM-2010). The elemental distribution was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) attached to the FEG-SEM system.
The current–voltage (J–V) curve of the solar cell with an active area of 0.25 cm2 was obtained under AM 1.5 standard irradiation (CHFXM-500W). Its light intensity was calibrated using a reference monocrystal silicon cell (CEL-RCCN). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out using a three-electrode system in an argon-purged acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 0.1 M LiClO4, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted using a two-electrode system in the dark at an open voltage bias of −0.7 V, with the frequency range varied from 0.1 MHz to 0.1 Hz at 10 mV fixed amplitude perturbation. The obtained spectra were analyzed and fitted using ZView software with equivalent circuits.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(A) shows the XRD patterns of the Co–Ni/carbon aerogel powder with a Co2+/Ni2+ molar ratio of 1:1 (labeled Co1Ni1) carbonized at 700 °C under an argon atmosphere. The characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 44.4°, 51.8°, and 76.3° were observed and can be ascribed to the reflection of the (111), (200), and (220) planes, respectively, of Co and Ni metals or the Co–Ni alloy.22 Notably, the specific peaks of NiO, Co3O4, or NiCo2O4 were not found in the XRD patterns, indicating that the active metal species were uniformly dispersed throughout the carbon aerogel matrix. To further confirm the carbon structure, Raman analysis of Co1Ni1 was carried out. The results (Fig. 1(B)) showed two typical overlapping peaks: the D peak at about 1360 cm−1 was assigned to the defects of the disordered structures, and the G peak at around 1580 cm−1 represented the ordered, graphitic structures.23 The height ratio of the two Raman peaks (I(D)/I(G)), which is usually used to describe the nanostructure ordering, increased because of the increase in the order of amorphous and disordered carbons. Based on Fig. 2(B), I(D)/I(G) was calculated to be 1.052, which means that the prepared carbon aerogel matrix had a certain degree of graphitization.24

The SEM images (Fig. 2(A) and (B)) show that the prepared Co1Ni1/carbon aerogels had a hydrangea-like shape. After ball milling, they exhibited a spherical structure with an average particle size of 5–100 nm and good dispersibility. The EDS data indicated the presence of C, Co, and Ni elements in the Co–Ni/carbon aerogels (Fig. 2C). The EDS elemental mapping of C, Co, and Ni (Fig. 2D–F; integrated onto the TEM image of the same region as in Fig. 2B) illustrated a homogeneous distribution of C, Co, and Ni species in the Co–Ni/carbon aerogels. Based on the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(G) and (H)), an identified core–cladding structure was confirmed as the Co–Ni alloy coated with the carbon material.25,26 Lattice spacings of 0.339 and 0.202 nm correspond to the (002) crystal plane of graphite and the (111) crystal plane of the Co–Ni alloy, respectively. To further understand the structural relationship between the alloy particles and carbon, 12 M HCl was added to the Co–Ni/carbon aerogel. After 24 h of vigorous stirring, the material remained magnetic, indicating that some Co particles were covered with carbon such that they cannot be dissolved by HCl. This phenomenon was consistent with the HRTEM analysis results.
Porosity was investigated by using the nitrogen-adsorption technique, and the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of the prepared Co–Ni/carbon aerogel (Co1Ni1) is shown in Fig. 3. A distinct hysteresis loop in the medium- and high-pressure regions (P/P0 = 0.45–1) was observed, and the specific surface area of the carbon aerogel was determined to be 151.76 m2 g−1. Based on the inset image in Fig. 3, the prepared Co–Ni/carbon aerogel had a typical B-type mesoporous structure, with a pore size of 4–5 nm.

Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves of DSSCs based on the prepared CAE and the Pt CE, and Table 1 summarizes the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. The photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) was greatly affected by the Co2+/Ni2+ molar ratio and reached the optimum value of 5.08% at a Co2+/Ni2+ molar ratio of 1:1. This value was 94.44% of the PCE obtained using the Pt CE (5.35%). Jsc is related to the number of photons effectively applied in a photoanode. In this work, the same ZnO photoanodes were used for all cells, so the differences in the Jsc values were due to the differences in the CE characteristics. The order of Jsc is Co1Ni1 (13.90) > Co1Ni3 (12.19) > Co3Ni1 (12.06) > Co4Ni0 (11.74) > Co0Ni4 (9.96). At a Co2+/Ni2+ molar ratio of 1:1, Jsc reached a maximum of 13.90 mA cm−2, which indicates fast electron mobility in this series of CAEs. This result is different from the work of Yu et al.,27 and the difference is considered to be attributed to the nano-size effect.28 In the work of Yu, the CoNi0.25 alloy shows the best performance from a macroscopic view. Meanwhile, in the Co–Ni/carbon aerogel, Co1Ni1(Co0.5Ni0.5) having a size of 5–100 nm shows the best performance.

Photovoltaic performance can be analyzed using CV.29,30Fig. 5 shows that all CV curves had two pairs of redox peaks ranging between −0.2 and 1.0 V, and the left redox peak can be assigned to the reduction of I3− to I−. The distance between the oxidation and reduction peaks was related to catalytic activity (EPP). Moreover, the distance between the oxidation and reduction peaks was 353 mV for the Pt CE but 319 mV for the CAE (Co2+/Ni2+ molar ratio = 1:1). This value for the CAE corresponds to the standard electrochemical rate constant in the I3− and I− reactions and means that the CAEs had higher catalytic activity than the Pt CE for the reduction of I3−.

EIS measurements were used to further examine the electrochemical behavior of CAEs.29 The recorded electrochemical impedance spectra are shown in Fig. 6(A), and the corresponding electrochemical parameters are summarized in Table 1. For the Pt CE, the spectrum had two typical semicircles attributed to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the Pt/electrolyte interface (left semicircle) and the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) in the electrolyte (right semicircle). The equivalent circuit diagram is shown in the inset of Fig. 6(A)(a). For the CAEs, three characteristic arches were observed from the EIS data, and these arches represented Rct at the CAE/electrolyte interface (left semicircle), the Nernst diffusion impedance (Npore) stemming from redox diffusion through the porous structure (middle) and the ZN (right) (left semicircle), which come from the porous structures of carbon aerogels.29 The values of Rct are Co4Ni0 (15.24) > Co0Ni4 (14.17) > Co3Ni1 (10.64) > Co1Ni1 (9.84). We find that the order of the values is in negative correlation with the order of Jsc. Because of the highly active catalyst, the process of I3− to I− will become easy to proceed at the aerogel/electrolyte interface, which reduced the value of Rct. This result demonstrates that Jsc depends upon electrocatalytic performance. In contrast to the Pt CE, an almost equal Rct value was obtained on the CAE with a Co2+/Ni2+molar ratio of 1:1, indicating that this CAE had excellent charge-transfer ability close to that of Pt. The serial resistance (Rs) was also determined based on the sheet resistance between the CAEs and the FTO substrate. Fig. 6(A) and Table 1 show that the CAE with a Co2+/Ni2+ molar ratio of 1:1 had the minimum Rs value of 24.65 Ω in the series of CAEs. This value was larger than that of Pt. Fig. 6(B) and (C) reflects the relationship of the spectra between the Nyquist (left) and Bode (right) plots.

Based on the analysis of the J–V, CV, and EIS data, we can conclude that the CAEs had higher catalytic activity than the Pt CE and comparable charge-transfer ability. The lower Jsc can be attributed to the lower electrical conductivity, which led to fewer electrons being abstracted. In addition, the conduction mechanism of the DSSC is shown in Fig. 7. After mixing ethyl cellulose as a binder with the carbon aerogels, we tested the adhesion of CAE on FTO and found that the aerogels were easily peeled off (Fig. 8). Conversely, when conductive carbon paste and ethyl cellulose were used as adhesives, no obvious peeling occurred, which is required for the practical application of CEs.20,31

Conclusions
By using inexpensive materials and simple, highly efficient techniques, Pt-free Co–Ni/carbon aerogels were prepared and used as CEs of DSSCs. The CAE performance was close to that of Pt as a CE. Adhesion tests were further conducted using Gauss tapes to CEs of DSSCs. The CAE exhibited good adhesion. Considering the abundant charge-transfer channels, large specific surface areas, and large number of exposed active sites, the CAEs showed excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of I3−. With conductive carbon paste as an adhesive, the adhesion of CAEs onto FTO was effectively improved.
