    , Accepted 28th July 2011First published on 30th August 2011AbstractChemical looping combustion is a novel technique with inherent separation of the greenhouse gas CO2 from atmospheric nitrogen in combustion of gaseous fuels. The selection of a suitable oxygen carrier which circulates between two fluidized bed reactors is a key issue for the performance of this technology. In this work, high surface area perovskite-based oxygen carriers, LaCoO3, LaCeCoO3 and LaMnO3, were synthesized by the reactive grinding method (S. Kaliaguine, A. van Neste, US Pat., 6 017 504, 2000; Applied Catalysis, A, 2001, 209, 345-358). LaMnO3 was also prepared by another method designated as nanocasting. The perovskites were characterized using different methods such as XRD, SEM, N2 adsorption, H2-TPR, TPD-O2 and finally the reactivity and stability of the carrier materials were tested in a CREC fluidized riser simulator using multiple reduction–oxidation cycles under two conditions: with low and high amount of CH4 (0.5 and 10 ml) as a feed. It was found from TPD-O2 and H2-TPR studies that the LaMnO3 perovskite, particularly the one prepared by the nanocasting method (LaMn-NC), has a high amount of available α-O2 (surface oxygens) and high density of surface anion vacancies. Moreover, the Mn-based perovskites showed easier reducibility compared to the Co-based oxygen carriers. The results obtained under two different conditions of CH4 pressure confirmed the strong dependency of the CLC results on this factor. Higher stability and no CO formation during the multiple redox cycles were indeed observed while using low pressure of CH4. Higher reactivity of the carriers was however obtained while using higher CH4 pressure but CO was detected in the products in this case. The higher reactivity of Mn-based perovskites could not only be due to the higher amount of surface oxygen and reducible sites present in the sample but also to the higher specific surface area of the perovskite. The formation of lanthanum and manganese silicate was observed for LaMn-NC which could be the reason for the reduction in CH4 conversion observed between the eighth and tenth redox cycles. This compound could be as a result of interaction between remnant silica in the sample with La and Mn from the perovskite lattice. No coke formation was detected on the oxygen carriers however, some agglomeration of the particles occurred, as confirmed by SEM images, XRD data and N2 sorption tests. Furthermore, XRD patterns confirmed that the structure of all perovskites remained unchanged after multiple redox cycles.

Broader context
In recent years, emissions of CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels particularly with increase in global electricity demand have increased drastically and may lead to an accelerated global warming effect. In this contribution, a series of nanostructured LaCoO3 and LaMnO3 perovskite materials are investigated as new potential oxygen carriers for chemical-looping combustion (CLC). The concept of chemical looping combustion is based on oxidation of a fuel using oxygen from a solid oxygen carrier. This process provides several advantages for instance for power plants, which produce electricity through combustion of fossil fuels, as these are considered to be a major source of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. In the CLC, the produced CO2 and H2O are not diluted with N2 originating from the combustion air and then pure CO2 can be obtained without an energy-consuming separation step. Indeed, the elimination of costly gas separation steps makes the chemical looping combustion process to operate with much higher efficiency by having lower exergy destruction compared to conventional methods of CO2 sequestration. An additional environmental advantage with the chemical-looping combustion process is that no NOx is generated during combustion. Thus, CLC is a process with great environmental prospects, which could allow reducing the cost of CO2 sequestration.

1. Introduction
Today, the problem of greenhouse gas emissions which lead to global warming has caused many concerns all over the world. Among industrial emissions contributing to global warming, CO2 constitutes the largest emission by volume. The average atmospheric concentration of CO2 was increased by 30% from the pre-industrial value of 280 ppm to the current level of 360 ppm today.1 It has been predicted by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) that by the year 2100, the atmosphere may contain up to 570 ppm of CO2, causing a rise of mean global temperature of around 1.9 °C and an increase in average sea level of 3.8 m.2
About one-third of the total CO2 emissions results from fossil fuel combustion. Fossil fuels currently supply 90% of the world's energy requirements.3 However, it is believed that we depend upon the fossil fuels as the dominant source for the world's energy at the current state of development as the levels of risks and cost of non-fossil fuel energy alternatives such as nuclear, biomass, solar energy, etc. cannot meet our need for energy production. Thus to meet mid- to long-term CO2 reduction targets, cost-effective CO2 capture from fossil fuel uses and subsequent sequestration options need to be developed.3
Most of the CO2 separation techniques such as post-combustion absorption using liquid alkaline solutions (e.g. amine) or solid adsorbents,4 oxy-fuel combustion and pre-combustion which are used in industry at the present time suffer from large energy penalty and high costs for the separation of CO2 from the rest of the flue gas components, resulting in a significant decrease in the overall combustion efficiency and as a result in a price increase of the energy because of the cost for CO2 capture. One type of post-combustion CO2 capture technology called Calcium-Looping Cycle is considered as a promising technique in the cement manufacture industry.5 The pros and cons for each of these conventional CO2 capture technologies are discussed in a recent review by MacDowell et al.6 Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) offers a solution for CO2 separation without energy penalty. Chemical looping combustion is a new combustion technology with inherent separation of CO2. Metal oxides are circulating between two interconnected fluidized bed reactors: a fuel reactor for fuel oxidation using oxide lattice oxygen and an air reactor for metal oxides re-oxidation by contact with air (Fig. 1). The complete combustion products CO2 and H2O are obtained in a stream separate from the oxygen-depleted air stream. Thus, pure CO2 is achieved in the fuel reactor exhaust stream after condensation of water without further gas separation. Finally, the free-of-water CO2 can be sequestrated at lower expenses or/and used for other applications. The outlet gas stream of the air reactor contains nitrogen and unreacted oxygen. These gases can directly be released to the atmosphere with minimum environmental effects. The reduced metal oxides are transported to the air reactor where they are re-oxidized and then re-circulated back to the fuel reactor for the next cycle.7,8 CLC is especially interesting in the context of large combustion processes such as those in power plants which need solutions for CO2 sequestration. The latter process involves both CO2 capture and underground sequestration. The cost of capture represents 80% of the whole CO2 management process when air burners are used. The potential savings associated with CLC are therefore quite significant. In addition by controlling the temperature of the air reactor it is possible to reduce significantly NOx emissions compared to flame combustors.
 Fig. 1  Principle of chemical looping combustion (MexOy = oxidized metal oxide, MexOy−1 = reduced metal oxide). 
The reaction between the fuel and oxygen carrier in the fuel reactor may be endothermic as well as exothermic depending on the metal oxide used, while the reaction in the air reactor is always exothermic. The CLC does not bring any enthalpy gains, thus, the total heat evolved in the reduction-oxidation reactions is the same as that of normal combustion in air. Its main advantage, however, is the inherent separation of both CO2 and H2O from the flue gases. In addition, since air and fuel go through two separated reactors and combustion takes place without a flame, NOx formation is avoided.9
The application of CLC at large scale highly depends on the availability of a suitable oxygen carrier material. Important criteria for oxygen carriers are high reactivity in both reduction by fuel gas and oxidation by oxygen in the air, high stability under repeated reduction–oxidation cycles at high temperatures as well as high resistance to attrition, fragmentation, and agglomeration. Additionally, it is also an advantage if the metal oxide is cheap and environmentally friendly. A number of different transition-state metals and their corresponding oxides have been investigated in the literature as possible oxygen carriers: Cu, Ni, Mn, Fe and Co. Generally, these metal oxides are combined with an inert solid such as Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, NiAl2O4 and MgAl2O4, which acts as a porous support providing a higher surface area for reaction and as a binder for increasing the mechanical strength, attrition resistance and fluidizability.10–12 In a recent work, Li et al.13 have investigated the role of TiO2 support addition on the performance of iron based oxygen carriers. They noted an improvement in reactivity and recyclability of supported oxygen carriers due to enhanced oxygen anion diffusivity in the presence of this support.
Ni-based carriers have been studied in great detail in the literature.8,10,11,14–16 Ni-based carriers possess good redox and mechanical properties and relatively high chemical stability for CLC. They have shown good regeneration property and mechanical durability with no signs of sintering in the temperature range of 850–950 °C. They also seem to have the highest reduction rate when compared to other transition metal oxygen carriers, however, thermodynamic restrictions for full conversion of hydrocarbon fuels (e.g. CH4) lead to the formation of undesirable products, such as CO and H2 in the gas outlet of the fuel reactor.8,10 These limitations could make it necessary to include some process modifications to reduce the amount of non-condensable gases in the CO2 compression and condensation stages. Other disadvantages of Ni-based oxides are high cost and health issues. Adánez et al.17 studied the use of a binary blend of CuO–NiO oxygen carrier for CLC which allows the full conversion of CH4 to CO2 and H2O in a batch fluidized bed reactor during the reduction period. Another shortcoming of Ni-based oxygen carriers is the interaction of nickel oxide and the support material (e.g. Al2O3) which leads to the formation of a hard-reducible spinel, NiAl2O4.10,18 The use of binary systems CoO–NiO/YSZ19 and CoO–NiO/Al2O318 was investigated for minimizing the formation of nickel aluminate species which decreases the reducibility of the carrier. Recently, Rydén et al.20 have investigated the use of NiO/Mg–ZrO2 oxygen carrier for CLC and they reached very high conversion of methane as well as a good control of selectivity toward combustion or partial oxidation products by altering the degree of particles reduction.
It has been reported in the literature that Fe-based carriers possess weak redox characteristics, particularly with respect to reaction rates, even when they are mixed with inert support materials.10,21–23 Moreover, they exhibited strong tendency for sintering and formation of agglomerates at temperatures in excess of 800 °C. However, they are still considered an attractive option for CLC applications due to their low cost and environmental compatibility.
Copper has several desirable properties compared to other oxygen carriers such as nickel and iron. Cu-based oxygen carriers are highly reactive in both reduction and oxidation cycles, CuO reduction is favoured thermodynamically to reach complete conversion using gaseous hydrocarbon fuels (methane). Both reduction and oxidation reactions over Cu-based oxygen carriers are exothermic which eliminates the need of energy supply in the reduction reactor and Cu is one of the cheapest metals that can possibly be used in the CLC processes.24,25 Despite these advantages, CuO has not received significant attention due to its tendency to decompose at comparatively low temperatures.26,27 Cu is also prone to agglomerate at fluidized bed conditions given its relatively low melting point, however a recent work28 showed that the problem of morphological instability of CuO and its tendency to agglomerate could be solved by using a mixed oxide system of Fe2O3/CuO with MgAl2O4 as an oxygen carrier.
The Co-based and Mn-based carriers have not received great attention for CLC application as they have limited conversion capabilities. In both cases, chemical instability has been reported since the interaction between the metals and alumina support is occurring and deteriorates the redox properties of the carriers.22,29
The above review provides a brief summary of the works which have been undertaken to develop a suitable oxygen carrier under conditions pertinent to chemical looping combustion. There has been significant progress in recent decades in this area. However, none of the transition metal oxides investigated in the previous studies can satisfy all the characteristics desirable for CLC application.
In this study, the investigation has been aimed at developing a perovskite-based oxygen carrier for CLC fluidized beds. Perovskites are mixed oxides with general formula ABO3, where A is an alkali, alkaline earth or rare earth metal and B is an element in the transition series or in the main groups III, IV or V.30 Several synthetic routes exist for the formation of perovskite structure. The choice of employing one of these methods depends on the use of perovskites as it directly affects the morphology and properties of the solid. The effect of the method of synthesis has been highlighted in studies of the perovskites La1−xSrxMnO331 and LaCo1−xFexO3.32 These works have shown that the method of synthesis affects the catalytic activity of perovskites for methane oxidation. Readman et al.33 have studied the feasibility of La1−xSrxCo1−yFeyO3−δ perovskites as a potential oxygen carrier for chemical looping combustion. They applied in situ powder X-ray diffraction to investigate the structural properties of the perovskites under both oxidative and reductive atmospheres. Their results suggested that La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ has the redox properties required for chemical looping. Reduction and re-oxidation of the perovskite take place quickly enough for CLC, and the structural stability has been confirmed under the oxidative and reductive conditions. However, this optimal solid displayed a low oxygen carrying capacity. Rydén et al.34 have reported the use of LaxSr1−xFeyCo1−yO3−δ as oxygen carriers for CLC or chemical-looping reforming (CLR) in a fixed bed quartz reactor at 900 °C. They found that LaxSr1−xFeO3−δ perovskites provided very high selectivity towards CO/H2 and should be well suited for chemical-looping reforming. The authors have also observed that La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.5Co0.5O3−δ has properties that result in high conversion of CH4 into H2O and CO2 in the beginning of each reduction period. Substituting La by Sr could increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the perovskite, but reduced the selectivity towards CO/H2 and the reactivity with CH4.
The perovskites used in the present work were synthesized by the reactive grinding method developed by Kaliaguine and Van Neste.35 The great advantage of this method compared to the conventional methods is its ability to eliminate the thermal treatment in the crystallization step; thus the perovskites produced by this method possess higher specific surface area. The details of the synthesis, properties and applications of the perovskites prepared by this technique are found in previous works.32,35-42 These studies provide knowledge necessary in controlling the morphology of the perovskites in a manner suitable for the design of CLC oxygen carriers. It should be noted that the perovskites prepared by this technique can provide high rates of reduction due to their high specific surface area. Besides, the reduction of these nanoperovskites is reversible and the re-oxidized material has almost the same structure as the initial perovskite.41 These materials will be then compared with a perovskite obtained by nanocasting (which provides an interesting new alternative). It could be stated that in line with the requirements of the CLC oxygen carriers, the nanoperovskites will provide the following properties: high oxidation and reduction rates at lower temperature, high oxygen mobility for CLC reactions due to the grain boundaries volume in their specific structure,42 high oxygen storage capacity,39 low tendency for carbon deposition due to their higher oxidation rates and lower oxidation temperature, high stability and durability in multiple successive reaction cycles due to the avoidance of crystal structure and morphology changes since perovskites are known to allow high oxygen vacancy concentrations and high mechanical strength as they are prepared by grinding in a ball mill.
For many years perovskites have been considered expensive materials, only produced at the few grams scale. This is not exactly true anymore. For example, the Québec firm Nanox used to run a 15 t y−1 demonstration reactive grinding unit. The overall production cost was estimated to be below US$30 per kg. Not only the production at a large scale would significantly reduce this cost, but we believe that new technologies based on nanocasting will allow large scale perovskite production at even lower cost.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of oxygen carrier materials
The LaCo-RG, LaCeCo-RG and LaMn-RG carriers were prepared by the reactive grinding method using the single oxides (La2O3, CeO2, Co3O4 and Mn2O3) as reactants. The synthesis was performed in two steps. The oxide precursors were first calcined at 600 °C for 24 h and then introduced in a vial having 5 mm thick wall with 3 balls. The vial and the balls are made with tempered steel. The vial was inserted in a SPEX laboratory grinder (rotation speed = 1040 rpm). At the end of this step, the single oxide conversion into perovskite is complete. The second step of grinding proceeded by adding an additive (ZnO or NaCl) to increase the specific surface area of the perovskites. After this step, the obtained compound (perovskite + ZnO) or (perovskite + NaCl) was washed repeatedly with dilute NH4Cl or distilled water respectively, to eliminate the additive from the perovskites. The additive for LaCo-RG and LaMn-RG was ZnO and NaCl for the LaCeCo-RG sample. Finally, the perovskites were calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. More details about the grinding conditions can be found in ref. 35.
The LaMn-NC sample was prepared via the nanocasting method. The solid template used in this method was KIT-6, a 3-D cubic large pore mesostructured silica. The template was synthesized according to ref. 43 and 44. The nitrate precursors of La and Mn along with citric acid were incorporated into the template through the wet impregnation process. In a typical synthesis, 1.73 g of La(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.7g of Mn(NO3)2·xH2O were dissolved in an ethanol solution containing the citric acid. The molar ratio of total metal ions to citric acid was adjusted to be 2:1. Then, the transparent solution was added dropwise to the suspension of 1 g of KIT-6 in 10 ml water. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and then the solvent was removed under vacuum in a rotary evaporator. The powder was further dried at 80 °C for 24 h and calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. Impregnation was repeated to achieve higher loading. The final powder was calcined at 700 °C for 6 h. The silica template was then removed by treating the composite 3 times with 2 M NaOH at room temperature. Then, the product was washed with water and ethanol repeatedly and dried overnight at 80 °C. The final product was calcined at 550 °C for 6 h.45
2.2 Characterization of carrier materials
Phase identification of the prepared carriers was carried out by X-ray diffraction on a SIEMENS D5000 using the Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.5406 Å). X-Ray diffractograms were recorded with a step scan of 0.05° for 2θ between 15° and 75°. Phase recognition was obtained by comparison with JCPDS files. Particle sizes (D1) were evaluated by means of the Scherrer equation D = Kλ/(βcos θ) after Warren's correction for instrumental broadening. K is a constant equal to 0.86 and λ is the wavelength of the X-ray used. β is the effective line width of the X-ray reflexion, calculated by the formula β2 = B2 − b2, where B is the FWHM and b is the instrumental broadening determined by the FWHM of the X-ray reflexion of quartz, having particles larger than 150 nm, at 2θ ≈ 27°. Specific surface areas were calculated by the BET method from N2 sorption isotherms recorded at −196 °C using a Quantrachrome instrument. Before adsorption, samples were evacuated at 200 °C for 6 h in order to remove physisorbed water. Sample compositions were established by ICP using a P40 instrument from Perkin-Elmer after dissolution of the catalyst in diluted HCl at 60 °C. SEM micrographs were obtained on a JEOL JSM-840 with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. The samples were first dispersed on an aluminium stub and coated with an Au/Pd film. The coke analysis was performed in a CNS-2000 of LECO instrument. The sample was completely combusted at 1350 °C, then the produced CO2 was quantified using an infra-red cell.
A RXM-100 multicatalyst testing and characterization system (Advanced Scientific Design Inc.) was used to perform oxygen thermo-desorption and reduction by hydrogen (TPD and TPR) tests. For H2-TPR experiments, 30 mg of solid was placed in a quartz reactor, pre-treated under a flow of 20 ml min−1 (20% O2 in He) at 550 °C for 2 h and cooled down to room temperature under the same gas flow. The TPR was carried out under a 10 ml min−1 flow rate of 5% H2 in Ar. The temperature was increased from 25 to 900 °C with a ramp of 5 °C min−1. The consumption of hydrogen was monitored and quantified using a TCD. For TPD-O2 the same pre-treatment was performed as for the TPR experiments. The solid (100 mg) was treated under the following conditions: 10 ml min−1 He, temperature from 25 to 900 °C with a ramp of 5 °C min−1. To obtain a complete desorption the solid was maintained at 900 °C for 10 min. A TCD was used for the quantification of oxygen. The amount of oxygen liberated was determined by deconvolution and integration of the desorption profile.
2.3 Reactivity and stability tests of oxygen carriers in the CREC riser simulator
The reactivity and stability of the prepared oxygen carriers were tested using the Chemical Reactor Engineering Center (CREC) riser simulator under turbulent fluidized bed conditions. The CREC riser simulator is a bench scale (volume of 50 cm3) mini-fluidized bed reactor, developed at CREC-UWO.46 A schematic diagram of the CREC riser simulator, along with the gas injector and anemometer location, is illustrated in Fig. 2. The CREC riser simulator consists of two sections: the upper shell and the lower shell. The lower shell includes both the injection port and catalyst basket. The catalyst basket is designed to fit inside the annular space of the bottom shell. Each of the shells has its own set of heaters to provide the necessary heat for combustion. An impeller is located in the upper section and upon rotation of the impeller at high speed (up to 5000 rpm), the gas is forced both outward in the impeller section and downwards in the outer reactor annulus, causing the solids catalyst to become fully fluidized.
 Fig. 2  Schematic diagram of the CREC Riser Simulator experimental setup.39 
For each reaction experiment in the CREC riser simulator, the required amount (maximum 1 g) of solid oxygen carrier was first loaded into the reactor basket and the reactor was then closed. The desired temperature for combustion reaction was set and the system was heated under flowing argon to ensure that the reactor system was free from oxygen (air). Once the reactor reached the desired preset temperature, the argon flow was stopped and the pressure in the vacuum box was brought down to 17.2 kPa (2.5 psi) using a vacuum pump. The impeller was then turned on and the feed (CH4) was injected into the reactor using a preloaded syringe. At the end of the pre-specified reaction time, a valve isolating the reactor and the vacuum bottle was opened and the contents of the reactor were transferred to the vacuum bottle. This caused an abrupt decrease of the reactor pressure, confirming that most of the reactant/product species were removed from the reactor almost instantaneously and that no further reaction took place. Finally, the product species were analyzed using a gas chromatograph. Before the next cycle, the oxygen carrier was regenerated by flowing air at a specified temperature and during a preset reaction time.18 This reduction–oxidation cycle was repeated for 10 times to check the stability of the solid oxygen carriers under CLC conditions.
3. Results and discussions
3.1 Physical properties
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the prepared LaBO3 (B = Co, Mn) oxygen carriers (Fig. 3) confirmed the formation of the perovskite structure. The LaCo-RG perovskite presented intense reflexions attributed to the rhombohedral LaCoO3 structure (JCPDS card 48-0123) with no signals for La2O3 and Co3O4. One can note that the formation of perovskite is complete after 8 h of ball milling (Fig. 3). However, a weak signal corresponding to ZnO was observed after calcination of the sample at 550 °C (designated by * in Fig. 3). The amount of Zn2+ cation remaining in the sample was about 8% in this sample. The cerium-substituted sample (LaCeCo-RG) presented pure perovskite phase, without any CeO2 or La2O3, but some peaks attributed to Co3O4 were observed in the sample. A very small reflexion of remnant sodium was also detected in this sample. The LaMn-RG and LaMn-NC manganese-based samples presented the rhombohedral LaMnO3.15 perovskite structure (JCPDS card 50-0298). This oxygen excess, δ in LaMnO3+δ, was often reported in the literature, when samples were prepared in air.33 A small bump at 2θ = 25–30° in the LaMn-NC sample is observed that may be attributed to the residual amorphous silica. It should be noted that the amount of silica remaining in this sample is about 10%.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the oxygen carriers (nc: not calcined; C 550: calcined at 550 °C; ‘*’: ZnO; ‘●’: Na; ‘○’: Co3O4; ‘+’: SiO2). 
The crystal sizes, calculated from X-ray line broadening (D1 in Table 1), were varied between 11.1 nm (LaCeCo-RG) and 40.2 nm (LaMn-NC). In the case of LaCoO3, no significant effect of the substitution by Ce was observed on the crystal size, which varied between 13.7 nm (LaCo-RG) and 11.1 nm (LaCeCo-RG). These values correspond well with previous values reported for LaCoO3 prepared by reactive grinding.37,39 The LaMnO3 prepared by reactive grinding possesses a greater crystal domain size of 24.2 nm and the LaMn-NC sample had the largest crystal domain size of about 40.2 nm.

Fig. 4 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the four prepared oxygen carriers. The BET specific surface areas (SBET) of the samples were calculated from the isotherm analysis in the relative pressure range from 0.05 to 0.2 and the total pore volumes were calculated at P/P0 = 0.945. These values are reported in Table 1. It can be seen that the substitution of 5% La by Ce leads to an increase in the specific surface area from 26 m2 g−1 to 35 m2 g−1. The La–Mn based perovskite showed higher SBET than La–Co based perovskite which was also observed in previous works.39,47 The LaMn-NC carrier before calcination at 550 °C demonstrated the largest SBET about 170 m2 g−1 which is the highest surface area ever reported for perovskites.45 The SBET of this sample remains high after calcination at 550 °C (see Table 1). For comparison, Royer et al.39 reported specific surface areas of 13.1 m2 g−1 and 6.6 m2 g−1 for LaMnO3 and LaCoO3, respectively, prepared by the conventional citrate complexation method. These low specific surface areas of samples prepared by the conventional methods are attributed to the sintering of particles due to the high calcination temperature during the perovskite synthesis.

3.2 Temperature-programmed reduction by H2
The reducibility properties of the oxygen carriers were investigated by H2-TPR. The H2-TPR profiles of the perovskite-based oxygen carriers are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2. All the profiles show two major peaks attributed to two reduction steps. Since La3+ is non-reducible under the conditions of H2-TPR, the observed H2 consumption peaks in the TPR profile of the perovskites are due to the reduction of the Con+ or Mnn+ cations. For LaCoO3 perovskites, the first peak is ascribed to the reduction of the metallic cation Co3+ into Co2+ following the reaction:39,48,49 LaCo3+O3 + ½H2 → LaCo2+O2.5 + ½H2O(1)

The second peak corresponds to the reduction of the Co2+ into its metallic state Co0 and leads to the destruction of the perovskite structure:50 LaCo2+O2.5 + H2 → ½La2O3 + Co0 + H2O(2)
For Co-based perovskites, we have shown previously that a fraction of cobalt was reduced to Co0 at the end of the first reduction step.38,39,51 According to reaction (1), for complete reduction of M3+ to M2+, 0.5 mol of H2 is consumed during the first step of reduction; however by integration of the TPR profiles, the amount of hydrogen consumption was found to be higher than 0.5 mol per atom M. These values are reported in Table 2. From the excess hydrogen consumption a percentage of conversion of Co2+ → Co0 was calculated. The LaCo-RG and LaCeCo-RG samples showed 13.1% and 20.8% conversion to metal at the end of the first reduction step, respectively. This metallic cobalt formation could be attributed to the reduction of some Co2+ in the grain boundaries of the perovskites without any change in the morphology. This is associated with the very high mobility of oxygen in these grain boundaries, as discussed by Echchahed et al.38
The partial substitution of La by Ce in Co-based perovskites induces some modification of the redox behaviour. One can note that the percentage of metallic cobalt formation which corresponds to the reduction of some Co2+ in the grain boundaries is increased. The first reduction step occurred at a temperature around 445 °C in both Co-based perovskite oxygen carriers. In the literature, this temperature has been reported to be lower for 10% Ce substituted perovskite in comparison to LaCoO3 perovskite.50 The second reduction was found to be more difficult since the second signal was shifted to higher temperature on LaCo-RG compared to LaCeCo-RG.
The results of the temperature-programmed reduction by H2 obtained for the LaMnO3 carriers are also reported in Fig. 6 and Table 2. It can be observed that the first reduction signal shifts to lower temperature in both LaMn-RG and LaMn-NC solids as compared to the Co-based perovskites, thus an easier reduction is expected for these perovskites. The small shoulder before the first peak of reduction (Fig. 6) and the excess of H2 consumed during the first step of reduction, as observed in Table 2, can confirm the presence of some Mn4+ cations in the structure. Indeed, the shoulder and the first peak around 350°C can be attributed to the reduction of Mn4+ into Mn3+ and also the reduction of some Mn3+ from the surface into Mn2+. During the second reduction step which was observed at 547 and 745 °C for LaMn-RG and LaMn-NC respectively, Mn3+ reduces to Mn2+. Thus, at the end of the second peak all manganese should be under Mn2+ form.39,51 For the LaMn-NC sample, the amount of hydrogen consumption was found to be significantly high which reflects a high capacity of reducibility in this oxygen carrier.
3.3 Temperature-programmed desorption of O2
The TPD-O2 experiments on the four oxygen carriers present two types of desorbed oxygen which can be observed on the profiles shown in Fig. 7. These two kinds of oxygen which can be distinguished by their desorption temperatures, were discussed in detail in our previous works.36,37,39,49 The α-O2 which is desorbed below 700 °C is usually assigned in the literature to oxygen bound to the surface of the perovskite. The second peak, β-O2, is detected above 750 °C and attributed to lattice oxygen and its desorbed amount is often considered as an indicator of the mobility of oxygen in the structure.36,52 The desorption temperature of α-O2 is strongly dependent on the temperature of calcination so that when calcination is performed at 550 °C oxygen desorption peaks are observed at 600–650 °C.36 It can be observed from Fig. 7 that for all samples under study, this temperature is in the range of 600–700 °C. The amount of α-O2 desorbed was calculated from the peak area by deconvolution of the O2 desorption curves using Lorentzian peak shapes in a computer peak-fitting routine. Assuming that one monolayer of oxygen amounts to 4 μmol m−2, the number of moles of α-O2 desorbed is also reported in terms of desorbed monolayer (Table 3). The large amount of desorbed α-O2 for Mn-based perovskites (superior to one mono layer) could be the evidence of the presence of Mn4+ cations, as discussed in ref. 51. The amount of released α-O2 for LaMn-NC is extremely high, about 434 μmol g−1 (2 times higher than one monolayer) while this amount is comparatively lower for LaCo-RG and LaCeCo-RG samples. The amount of α-oxygen available is an important factor to initiate the oxidation reaction. Indeed, the large amount of α-O2 desorbed for the Mn-based perovskite prepared by the nanocasting method could be due to the formation of a high concentration of oxygen vacancies or attributed to oxygen released from grain boundaries of the perovskite domains. It presents a significant amount of available oxygen that can be used for chemical looping combustion. The amount of β-O2 released from Co-based perovskites, 132 and 145 μmol g−1 for LaCo-RG and LaCeCo-RG respectively, is also found to be lower as compared to the Mn-based perovskites (190 μmol g−1). The desorption temperature of this type of oxygen is in the range of 790–856 °C.

 Fig. 7  TPD-O2 profiles of the oxygen carriers. 
From the H2-TPR and TPD-O2 results, it can be said that the abundance and availability of the reducible sites in perovskites to produce the anion vacancies is much higher for the LaMnO3 samples especially for the one prepared by the nanocasting method. This factor is one of the essential parameters for oxidation reactions.
3.4 Reactivity and stability tests in CREC riser simulator
The reactivity and stability of the perovskite based oxygen carriers were investigated in the CREC Riser Simulator using methane as a reducing gas for combustion and air for regeneration of the reduced carriers. The combustion and regeneration processes were carried out at 650 °C and under atmospheric pressure. The contact time between fuel and oxygen carriers was adjusted to be 50 s. The exit gas stream from the CREC riser simulator was analyzed using a MicroGC. When the combustion is complete, one can find unreacted methane and carbon dioxide as the sole products in the gas stream but in some cases slight amounts of CO might be also observed. The possible reactions in the fuel reactor are listed as follows:
Reduction: CH4 + 4MO ⇄ CO2 + 2H2O + 4M(3) CO + MO ⇄ CO2 + M(4) H2 + MO ⇄ H2O + M(5)
Reforming: CH4 + H2O ⇄ CO + 3H2(6) CH4 + CO2 ⇄ 2CO + 2H2(7)
Water gas shift: CO + H2O ⇄ CO2 + H2(8)
Thus two parameters can be defined and calculated, the total methane conversion and specific methane conversion to CO2 during the combustion period: (9) (10)where γCH4 and γCO2 are defined as the total conversion of CH4 and specific methane conversion to CO2, respectively and Ci is the measured molar concentration of component i.
At first, reactivity study of the oxygen carriers prepared by the reactive grinding in the CREC riser simulator was started using a low amount of feed about 0.5 ml of methane for 1.0 g of perovskite. Analysis of the gases in these conditions exclusively showed the presence of CO2 and H2O as products. No side product such as CO was detected using these carriers (γCH4 = γCO2). The results of methane conversion as a function of the number of reduction–oxidation cycles on three reactive grinding prepared oxygen carriers are demonstrated in Fig. 8. The average methane conversion on the LaCo-RG, LaCeCo-RG and LaMn-RG is 78, 78 and 81%, respectively. In the case of using an LaMn-RG carrier, the methane conversion reached as high as 93% after 7 cycles. The results reported in Fig. 8 show that these oxygen carriers, particularly the Co-based perovskites, displayed a stable conversion during the first 10 reduction–oxidation cycles. Fig. 9 represents the effect of partial pressure of CH4 on the conversion. These results were obtained with the LaCo-RG oxygen carrier. It could be observed that an increase in the amount of CH4 injected results in an augmentation of conversion which confirms the dependency of the reaction rate to the partial pressure of methane.

 Fig. 9  CH4 conversion for different volumes of injection of methane over fresh samples (T: 650 °C; initial argon pressure: 1 atm; Wcarrier: 1 g). 
The results of methane conversion versus the number of reduction–oxidation cycles on the Mn-based perovskite carrier prepared by both methods (LaMn-NC, LaMn-RG) are shown in Fig. 10. The combustion was performed using 40 mg of the carrier for 10 ml of methane as a fuel. The analysis of the gas product from the CREC riser simulator showed the presence of CO2 and H2O as the main products; however slight amounts of CO were also detected. The average total conversion of methane was found to be 77% over both Mn-based carriers, however LaMn-RG could provide higher and more stable methane conversion during the 10 repeated cycles. One can note that the values of the γCO2 are slightly lower compared to the γCH4, since some CO was produced during the combustion process. After two cycles of reduction–oxidation, the total and specific methane conversions showed stability over the multiple redox cycles which in turn confirms the stable behaviour of these two oxygen carriers for the CLC process. These results of the methane combustion in the CREC riser simulator confirm the high oxygen capacity and mobility of the Mn-based oxygen carriers since the amount of α-O2 was found to be extraordinarily high. A comparison of the results with those reported by Hossain and de Lasa18 is possible since these authors used also a Riser Simulator to study Co–Ni/Al2O3 carriers under exactly the same experimental conditions. Both methane conversions (≅75%) and stability over multiple redox cycles (10 cycles) were found to be quite similar to the ones shown in Fig. 10. It should be noted that only in these conditions can methane conversions obtained by different researchers with different materials be compared. The CO and CO2 selectivity terms were calculated, according to eqn (11) and (12). (11) (12)

The selectivities of CO and CO2 for the combustion of CH4 under CLC conditions in the CREC riser simulator as a function of the number of cycles for both Mn-based perovskites are reported in Fig. 11. It can be seen from this figure that the quantity of CO formed is very small and remains stable and the average selectivity toward CO is 22% and 11% for LaMn-NC and LaMn-RG, respectively. The CO2 selectivity for LaMn-RG carrier was found to be higher and more stable. It can be concluded that formation of CO in CLC conditions using the perovskite oxygen carriers is strongly dependent on the experimental conditions of the process such as the partial pressure of feed, contact time between the oxygen carrier and gas reactant. In the case of LaMn-RG carrier, CO formation occurred at high CH4 partial pressure. These results confirm the significance of methane partial pressure and mass of oxygen carrier used on the results and performance of the carrier materials in CLC conditions. These two parameters could have some influence on the external and internal diffusion effects which lead to limitations to heat and mass transfer from the bulk gas to the external layer of the particle bed and transfer through the particle bed in gas–solid reactions. Rydén et al.34 have examined perovskite-based oxygen carriers in a fixed bed quartz reactor at 900 °C for chemical looping combustion (CLC) and chemical looping reforming (CLR). They observed a high selectivity toward CO and H2 formation over La0.5Sr0.5FeO3−δ and La0.8Sr0.2FeO3−δ.

Coke formation may occur during combustion of methane in CLC depending on the type of oxygen carrier and reaction conditions such as availability of oxygen, reaction time, temperature and pressure of reaction.27,53 The two possible reactions leading to carbon formation in CLC are: CO ⇄ 0.5C + 0.5CO2(13) CH4 ⇄ C + 2H2(14)
The coke deposition could be an obstacle which would limit the efficiency of the total CO2 separation.54 Therefore, it is important to minimize its formation by selecting an appropriate oxygen carrier and adjusting the reaction conditions. Regarding the coke formation on the perovskite-based oxygen carriers used in this work, all carriers were tested to check the amount of carbon deposited during the reduction reaction. The results are obtained after 10 redox cycles on the reduced forms of the carriers and reported in Table 4. It can be observed that the measured amount of carbon deposited on the oxygen carriers after the 10th reduction step (see Table 4) is negligibly small, thus it may be claimed that these perovskite-based oxygen carriers are resistant against coke formation under CLC conditions. Indeed, metallic formation of Co or any other transition metals can catalyze the carbon formation.26 There was no metallic Co detected in the samples; thus this can explain the absence of carbon deposition over these oxygen carriers. Rydén et al.34 have also observed no carbon formation on the LaxSr1−xFeO3−δ perovskite oxygen carriers which were suitable for chemical looping reforming, however Bjørgum55 observed a loss in performance after reduction for LaxSr1−xFeO3−δ perovskite and this was concluded to be probably a result of permanent deactivation of the carrier by the occurrence of solid carbon. Regarding the carbon formation observed using oxygen carriers based on supported transition metal oxides, Cho et al.10 have confirmed the formation of carbon on Cu-based oxygen carriers. Adánez et al.17 who applied the Ni-based oxide and mixed Ni–Cu oxide oxygen carriers have observed carbon deposition during the reduction in both cases, and the formation of CO and CO2 was detected during the oxidation process.

3.5 Physical properties of the used oxygen carriers
The properties of the oxygen carriers having been tested in 10 reduction–oxidation cycles for chemical looping combustion application were examined. To this end, the used oxygen carriers after 10 redox cycles in such conditions were characterized by XRD, N2 sorption and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 12 shows the XRD patterns of all oxygen carriers used in the CREC riser simulator after 10 cycles. It can be observed that the crystalline structure of all perovskites remained unchanged after being used for 10 reduction–oxidation cycles under CLC conditions. It should be mentioned that an intense signal of ZnO was found in the case of LaCo-RG sample reflecting the high amount of remnant additive in this sample. In both Co- and Mn-based oxidized carriers a very weak signal of metal oxide, Co3O4 and Mn3O4, respectively, were detected after 10 redox cycles (last step: oxidation). In LaMn-NC oxygen carrier, some reflexions of lanthanum silicate and manganese silicate complexes at 2θ = 27.01°, 28.14°, 30.82° and 30.14° were observed which can be due to the interaction of lanthanum and manganese in the structure with SiO2 which remained after the preparation of the oxygen carrier by the nanocasting method. These compounds have high-temperature stability and could be the reason for a slight decrease in the conversion level of methane, particularly in the last CLC cycles in the CREC rise simulator. The structure of LaMn-RG while using 10 ml of methane after 10 repeated cycles was completely unchanged which shows high stability of this oxygen carrier under even tough CLC conditions. The specific surface areas (SSA) of the used oxygen carriers after 10 CLC cycles were measured and reported in Table 5. There is a significant reduction in the specific surface area of the oxygen carriers after being used in 10 redox cycles, which is much less for LaMn-RG while using small amount of methane. This reduction could be due to the agglomeration of the particles at high temperature during CLC redox cycles. The fact that this lowered specific surface area is not accompanied by a diminution of methane conversion should not be interpreted as an indication that the initial surface area of the carrier is not important for the rate of oxidation. This rate is indeed associated with oxygen mobility in the perovskite particle but it was established that in reactive grinded materials the oxygen in grain boundaries is much more mobile than in the bulk (see for example refs. 38 and 39). The dependence of oxidation rate to specific surface area is therefore quite complex and associated with the complex relationship between lattice defects and surface area. The agglomeration of the particles could be also confirmed by an increase in the crystal size of the perovskites as calculated by means of Scherrer equation and XRD data (compare Tables 1 and 5). Only LaMn-NC showed no increase in the crystal domain size even after repeated redox cycles. Fig. 13 shows SEM images of used oxygen carriers. The morphology of the samples remained unchanged even though the particles appear more agglomerated compared to the fresh samples (see Fig. 5).

4. Conclusions
A series of perovskite-based oxygen carriers for CLC application were prepared by two novel methods: reactive grinding (LaCoO3 and LaMnO3) and nanocasting (LaMnO3). These two methods of preparation produced perovskites with high specific surface area and oxygen mobility. The H2-TPR and TPD-O2 studies showed LaMnO3 oxygen carrier presented easier and higher reducibility as well as higher surface density of α-O2 which are the essential factors for the oxidation reactions. These factors are more highlighted for the LaMnO3 prepared by the nanocasting method.
The reactivity and stability of the oxygen carriers were investigated in a CREC riser simulator which is a batch fluidized bed reactor. The Co- and Mn-based perovskites prepared by the reactive grinding method showed high conversion of CH4 and high stability during 10 reduction-oxidation cycles; however the reactivity of these oxygen carriers was limited at low methane pressure. While using higher amounts of CH4 and therefore at higher methane pressure, these oxygen carriers demonstrated high reactivity as well as high stability but some slight amount of CO was formed in these conditions. The LaMnO3 oxygen carrier prepared by nanocasting demonstrated high reactivity during the 10 reduction–oxidation cycles under CLC conditions. The selectivity of methane combustion toward CO2 was affected significantly as more CO was produced in this case. The LaMn-NC oxygen carrier also demonstrated good stability under the repeated redox cycles although for the last cycles a weak reduction in methane conversion was observed. This reduction could be due to the formation of a stable lanthanum silicate compound, whose presence was confirmed by the XRD data of the used oxygen carrier. This compound likely forms through the interaction of remnant silica in the sample with the lanthanum in the lattice. The partial substitution of La by 5% Ce has not shown any modification on the performance of the oxygen carrier. The results of TPD-O2 (Table 3) also show that this substitution did not result in an increase in oxygen adsorption capacity commensurate with the increase in the specific surface area. These facts underline the complex relationship between oxydo-reduction extent or rate and the characteristics of the carrier. This complexity is indeed related to the diversity of reactivity and mobility of the various oxygen species involved in the oxydo-reduction process (various adsorbed Oads as well as β-oxygens from the bulk or the grain boundaries).
The XRD data and SEM images confirmed the structural stability of the perovskite-based oxygen carriers as the carrier materials preserved their crystal structure and morphology after being used in 10 reduction–oxidation cycles. As mentioned above, negligible carbon deposition was measured but some limited agglomeration was observed by SEM. Some increase in the crystal domain size of the perovskites and the reduction in the specific surface area of the used samples were also noted.

Broader context
In recent years, emissions of CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels particularly with increase in global electricity demand have increased drastically and may lead to an accelerated global warming effect. In this contribution, a series of nanostructured LaCoO3 and LaMnO3 perovskite materials are investigated as new potential oxygen carriers for chemical-looping combustion (CLC). The concept of chemical looping combustion is based on oxidation of a fuel using oxygen from a solid oxygen carrier. This process provides several advantages for instance for power plants, which produce electricity through combustion of fossil fuels, as these are considered to be a major source of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. In the CLC, the produced CO2 and H2O are not diluted with N2 originating from the combustion air and then pure CO2 can be obtained without an energy-consuming separation step. Indeed, the elimination of costly gas separation steps makes the chemical looping combustion process to operate with much higher efficiency by having lower exergy destruction compared to conventional methods of CO2 sequestration. An additional environmental advantage with the chemical-looping combustion process is that no NOx is generated during combustion. Thus, CLC is a process with great environmental prospects, which could allow reducing the cost of CO2 sequestration.
