    , Accepted 30th November 2019First published on 2nd December 2019AbstractThe hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) is a promising material for developing novel optoelectronic devices. Due to its intrinsic non-layered crystal structure, it remains challenging to synthesize two-dimensional (2D) single-crystalline CH3NH3PbX3 with nanoscale thickness. Here, we report a bottom-up approach to fabricate large CH3NH3PbX3 2D crystals via liquid-phase growth on a mica substrate. The strong potassium-halogen interactions at the perovskite/mica interface decrease the interface energy, driving the striking in-plane growth of the perovskite. The grown 2D CH3NH3PbBr3 crystal was characterized as 8 nm in thickness and hundreds of micrometers in lateral size. Weak exciton binding energy was crucial for improving the photoelectric performance of 2D CH3NH3PbBr3. A visible-light photodetector with a metal/insulator/perovskite configuration was finally achieved with a photoresponsivity of 126 A W−1 and a bandwidth exceeding 80 kHz. Our work proves that the liquid-phase growth on mica is a controllable method to grow 2D hybrid CH3NH3PbX3 perovskites, which can facilitate both device applications and fundamental investigations.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have recently emerged and attracted tremendous attention in opto-electronic applications.1,2 These materials are composed of several earth-abundant elements and can be fabricated via various low-cost methods;3 the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OIHP cells has exceeded 23.2% at present,4 approaching that of commercial silicon solar cells. Therefore, OIHPs are low-cost alternatives to silicon solar cells; however, they also play a key role in next-generation batteries, lasers, high-energy radiation detectors and many more devices.5–7 In addition to OIHPs, two-dimensional (2D) materials are a rapidly expanding field in materials science and condensed state physics. Crystalline materials with atomic thickness, such as graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), phosphorene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), exhibit unique properties different from those of their bulk counterparts.8–11 However, to date, no 2D materials have shown excellent opto-electronic properties that are comparable to those of OIHPs. Although monolayer MoS2 is a direct bandgap semiconductor,12 its optoelectronic performance is limited by its weak light absorption and very high exciton binding energy (EB) as well as its fast carrier recombination.
Recent advances in perovskites suggest that two-dimensional OIHPs are suitable candidates for addressing the deficiency of 2D materials in optoelectronics.13 According to their crystalline structures, 2D OIHPs are classified into two types. One is non-layer crystal-structured 2D OIHPs, whose bulk counterparts are formed by the 3D framework of the [PbX6]4− octahedra; the other is layer-structured OIHPs,14 in which the [PbX6]4− framework is split into a layer structure by organic long-chain cations. For the layer crystal-structured OIHPs, the inorganic [PbX6]4− layers are sandwiched by organic long-chain cation layers and interact with the adjacent layers via van der Waals forces; moreover, the [PbX6]4− layer thickness can be controlled via the organic chain length.15 However, the organic chains can also induce some unfavourable characteristics: (i) the dielectric confinement effect arising from the low dielectric constant of the organic chains enhances the exciton EB, which is a disadvantage for photoelectric conversion;16 (ii) the organic spacer decreases the carrier mobility and causes charge accumulation and radiative recombination losses;17 and (iii) the long chain molecules confine the crystalline size; as a consequence, it is difficult to synthesize 2D OIHP films with a large size.
The non-layered structured OIHPs, which possess small EB values and long carrier diffusion lengths, are the most promising materials for photovoltage applications;18 meanwhile, the intrinsic non-layered crystal structure poses a challenge for large-size 2D single-crystal growth. Various fabrication technologies, including solution-phase growth and vapor-phase epitaxy, have been developed to obtain 2D OIHP nanocrystals and thin films. For example, traditional solution-phase methods can be used to rapidly synthesize 2D perovskite nanoplates with controllable thicknesses;19,20 the space-confined solution method achieved growth of large-size single-crystalline thin films on various substrates.21,22 2D OIHPs were also synthesized via vapor-phase reactions of layered lead halide nanostructures with gaseous MAI23 or direct vapor-phase growth on a single-crystal substrate.24–26
Especially, previous work on high temperature ionic epitaxy of perovskite on mica and NaCl crystals27,28 demonstrated that the ionic surface of a substrate provides a new kinetic route for controlling 2D perovskite growth. Here, we report a low-cost wet-chemical strategy to achieve liquid-phase growth of 2D OIHPs on a mica substrate. The strong ion interactions between potassium (K) and the halogens decrease the mica/perovskite interface energy and promote the in-plane growth of 2D perovskites on the mica; meanwhile, oleic acid (OA) is used as an inhibitor to confine the vertical growth. Finally, 2D MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3+, X = Cl−, Br−, I−) with thicknesses of 8 nm and lateral sizes exceeding hundred micrometers was grown on the mica substrate. A visible light photodetector was fabricated based on the as-grown 2D MAPbBr3 with the metal–insulator-semiconductor configuration.
Results and discussion
In order to grow 2D OIHPs, the critical factor is to achieve anisotropic crystal growth, i.e. promoting the in-plane growth and suppressing the out-of-plane growth.29 The designed 2D MAPbX3 growth procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1A. The precursor solution was dipped into a slit channel, which was composed of two stacks of freshly cleaved mica, and then rotated at 4000 rpm for 30 s to remove the excess solution. After that, the growth system was placed onto a hot plate and heated at the crystalline temperature for several hours. Because the vertical growth was restricted, with solvent evaporation, 2D perovskite sheets grew slowly on the mica surface. Similar to the reported space-confined method,21 the perovskite thicknesses under physical confinement were limited to several tens of nanometers (Fig. S1†). To further decrease the thicknesses, moderate oleic acid (OA) was added to the precursor solution as a surface modifier; it attached to the perovskite surface and inhibited the increase of thickness (Fig. 1B inset).30 The perovskite thicknesses were controlled by the OA amount (Fig. 1B). Finally, 2D MAPbBr3 single-crystal sheets thinner than 10 nm were obtained on mica (optical images are shown in Fig. 1C and S2;† the AFM image and height profiles are shown in Fig. 2A and B). Its lateral size, up to several hundred micrometers, is among the largest reported for 2D MAPbX3 single crystals to date.31 Other 2D perovskites, including MAPbCl3 and MAPbI3, as well as the inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 were also obtained (Fig. S3–5†).

The XRD data suggest the highly crystalline quality of 2D MAPbBr3 perovskite. 
Selective-area electron diffraction (SAED) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) demonstrated the phase purity and well-defined crystalline nature of the grown 2D MAPbBr3 perovskite (Fig. 2C and D). The diffraction peaks (Fig. 2D) could be indexed to the (001), (002), (003) and (004) faces of a cubic crystal,32 suggesting that the grown 2D MAPbBr3 perovskites are highly c-axis-oriented. The rocking curve of the (002) peak (Fig. S6†) had a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.154°. This value was larger than that of bulk MAPbBr3 crystal due to the structure relaxation of 2D perovskites.32,33 The chemical composition of the 2D MAPbBr3 perovskite was analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S7†). The ratio of Pb and Br ions was about 1:3.2, which is consistent with the theoretical value of MAPbBr3.
To understand the growth mechanism of 2D MAPbX3 perovskites on mica, we designed various special growth processes and conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the kinetics details of the liquid-phase growth. Mica is a typical van der Waals crystal, so it is an ideal substrate for 2D material growth;34 thus, we sought to determine whether the driving forces of crystal growth were van der Waals interactions between the organic molecules and the mica. We grew all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites without MA molecules. As shown in Fig. S5,† CsPbBr3 exhibited similar 2D growth characteristics to the hybrid perovskite. The grown CsPbBr3 perovskite had a thickness of 14 nm and a size of tens of micrometers, indicating that the driving force of growth was not the van der Waals force.
To determine the influence of the growth substrate, we grew 2D MAPbBr3 on silicon, quartz glass and ITO glass. However, we found that the MAPbBr3 perovskite preferred to crystallize in solution rather than epitaxially grow on these substrates (Fig. S8 and Video S1†), in sharp contrast to mica (Video S2†). These experimental results suggest that the 2D growth of MAPbBr3 on mica should be attributed to the special crystal structure of mica. The high temperature ionic epitaxy of perovskite on the mica and NaCl single-crystal substrates suggests that high mobility of the ions, such as potassium and sodium ions, enabled epitaxy growth of perovskite in these materials even with great lattice mismatches.27,28
Our DFT calculations proved that the favorable kinetics for 2D MAPbBr3 growth on mica was due to the strong alkali and halide interactions at the perovskite/mica interface. The interface was stimulated as the (001) face of perovskite absorbed an equal stoichiometric ratio of K ions. Fig. 3A illustrates the interface structures before and after the lattice relaxation. The DFT results revealed these facts: (1) the adsorption of K ions was exothermic (Table S1†) and, therefore, the perovskite interface was energetically favorable to be passivated by the K ions of the mica, which is highly consistent with recently reported experimental measurements;35 (2) the bond length of Pb–Br (the terminal Br atom) was expanded from 3.095 Å of the bulk lattice to 3.31 Å of the interface; (3) the K–Br distance was about 3.25 Å, which is exactly equal to that of the ionic crystal KBr,36 suggesting strong K–Br interactions at the interface.

(A) Schematic of the structure relaxation of the perovskite/mica interface before and after K ion absorption.

(E to G) 3D AFM images exhibiting the surface morphologies and high profiles of three MAPbBr3 perovskite sheets with thicknesses of 8 nm, 35 nm, and 1000 nm. The rms values of the three sheets are ∼8 Å, 5 Å and 14 Å, respectively. Scale bar, 7 μm. 
To confirm the DFT calculations, two perovskite sheets with thicknesses of 50 nm and 7 nm were respectively probed using macroscopic XPS to investigate their K2p, Br3d and Pb4f core levels. As shown in Fig. 3B, the binding energies (B. E.) of the K 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 core level peaks were located at 296.3 and 293.4 eV for the 7 nm perovskite, respectively; this is consistent with those of mica crystal,37 indicating that most X-ray photoelectrons were derived from the mica substrate. With increasing perovskite thickness, the photoelectrons from the mica were substantially suppressed; in contrast, those originating from the interface were enhanced. For the 50 nm perovskite, the K2P core level peaks decreased in intensity; more importantly, the B. E. values shifted to the lower energy side at 296.1 and 293.2 eV, which coincides exactly with the XPS fingerprint of K–Br bonds in ionic crystal KBr.38 This provides solid evidence of the K–Br interactions between the perovskite and mica substrate. On the other hand, for the 50 nm sheet, the Pb 4f7/2 core level peak located around 138.6 eV (Fig. 3C) corresponded to the B. E. of Pb–Br bonds;39 the Br 3d peak at 68.6 eV (Fig. 3D) corresponded to the B. E. of Br with Pb.40 With decreasing thickness, the B. E. values of the Pb and Br valence electrons both shifted to higher energies, which can be attributed to relaxation of the mica/perovskite interface.18
Strong K–Br interactions enhance the thermodynamic stability of the mica/perovskite interface, which is beneficial for driving the 2D morphology and layer-by-layer growth of films.41 The calculated formation energy of the mica/perovskite interface was negative, about −19.8 to −43.2 meV per atom (Table S1†); this suggests that the interface is more thermodynamically favourable than the bulk lattice. The lateral growth of perovskite on mica was larger than the nucleation rate of the second layer.29 Therefore, the surface morphologies of the grown perovskites were atomically flat (Fig. 3E–G, Fig. S3–5† for MAPbI3, MAPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 sheets). As shown in Fig. 3E and F, the root mean square roughnesses (rms) of the surfaces were ∼5 Å and ∼4 Å for the 8 nm and 35 nm MAPbBr3 perovskites, respectively, and their edges were sharp; this exhibits a typical layer-by-layer growth mode. When the perovskite thickness increased to 1 μm, the surface roughness increased and the rms increased to ∼14 Å, suggesting that island nucleation occurs. In addition, no steps or spiral-islands were found in the perovskite surface, indicating that there are few crystallographic defects in the grown 2D perovskites.
The 2D MAPbBr3 perovskites grown on mica have high-quality crystalline structures, such as atomically flat surfaces, uniform thicknesses, lack of spiral growth-steps, and vertical sharp edges; these are beneficial for yielding uniform PL emissions in plane, as shown in Fig. 4A–C. The optical emission and absorption of 2D MAPbBr3 are shown in Fig. 4D and E. Both the optical absorption edge and PL emission of 2D MAPbBr3 exhibited blue shifts compared with the bulk crystals. The optical bandgap estimated from the absorption spectrum was 2.44 eV for 2D MAPbBr3, which was blue-shifted by 0.30 eV from that of the bulk crystal (2.14 eV). DFT calculations suggest that only a 0.17 eV blueshift in the bandgap is caused by the lattice relaxation of monolayered MAPbBr3, which is smaller than the experimental measurement and indicates the dominance of quantum confinement for the 2D MAPbBr3 perovskite.42 With increasing bandgap, the PL emission of MAPbBr3 shifted from 545 nm for the bulk crystal to 519 nm for the 2D counterpart. The lifetimes of the PL emissions could be deconvoluted into two components, the fast part of 6 ns and the slow part of 50 ns (Fig. 4F). The former was attributed to carrier recombination dominated by the interface trap states, and the latter was governed by recombination arising from the bulk phase.43 The exciton binding energy (EB) of 2D MAPbBr3 perovskite could be estimated using the Elliott model;44 it was 30 meV, which is smaller than the reported hundreds of meV for 2D layered perovskites.45 This small EB is attributed to the high permittivity of inorganic components in 2D non-layered perovskites,46 which increase the exciton dissociation efficient, resulting in high photoelectronic conversion.

Using the grown 2D MAPbBr3, a photodetector was fabricated using a shadow mask pattern. The thickness of the perovskite was about 20 nm, and 50 nm Au metal was deposited as electrodes with a 100 μm gap. The effective area of the device was about 50 × 100 μm2. Less than 5% of the 450 nm monochromatic light illuminating the effective area was absorbed by the 2D MAPbBr3 perovskite. The device configuration is illustrated in Fig. 5A, and a photograph of the device is shown in the inset of Fig. 5A. A bias was applied through two Au electrodes under various laser illuminations. MAPbBr3 crystal is a p-type semiconductor whose work function is about −5.63 eV;32 therefore, the contact of perovskite/Au should be ohmic. However, the measured I–V curves of the devices exhibit clear rectifying behaviour under all optical excitations (Fig. 5B). The distinction may originate from an insulator layer between Au and 2D MAPbBr3 crystal, such as residual OA. In contrast, the device fabricated using 2D MAPbBr3 grown without the addition of OA exhibited linear character of the I–V curve (Fig. S9†). The band diagram of the 2D MAPbBr3-OA-Au interface is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 5B. A metal–insulator-semiconductor (MIS) configuration is realized, where the insulator functions as a resistive barrier to block the thermal carrier injection; as a result, the device has an extremely low dark current of ∼10−12 A.

(B) I–V curves of the 2D perovskite-based photodetector measured in the dark and under various light illuminations, respectively. The inset is the energy diagram of the 2D MAPbBr3-OA-Au interfaces. 
The carrier mobility of the 2D MAPbBr3 perovskite was estimated to be 36.5 cm2 V−1 S−1 using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 6A).47 The photoresponsivity was measured under biases of 5 V and 10 V, as shown in Fig. 6B. The photoresponsivity increased with increasing bias voltage. A high photoresponsivity of 126 A W−1 was achieved. Using an oscilloscope, the temporal response of the 2D MAPbBr3 photodetector was measured under a constant bias voltage of 5 V with an incident light intensity of 1.0 mW. As shown in Fig. 6C and D, the device showed an on/off current ratio as high as 104. Most importantly, achievement of fast response to radiation was demonstrated, with a rise time and decay time of ∼5 and 4.1 μs, respectively. The maximum −3 dB bandwidth (f−3 dB) of the device could reach 80 kHz; additionally, in the experiments, the f−3 dB value of the device even exceeded the bandwidth of a lock-in amplifier (0.1 MHz), which suggests that further device optimization would improve the device performance. The large optical absorption, small exciton binding energy, and long carrier lifetime combined with the resistive barrier gave rise to excellent performance of the 2D MAPbBr3 perovskite. Therefore, we practically proved that the 2D MAPbBr3 perovskite shows better photoelectronic performance than a pristine monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide photodetector (Table S2†).

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a bottom-up technology for fabricating large-size 2D perovskites with a non-layered crystal structure, including organic–inorganic hybrid CH3NH3PbX3 perovskites and all inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites. An ionic interaction mechanism was proposed to elucidate the unique 2D-growth mechanism of the perovskites on mica. The strong K-halogen interactions promote the thermodynamic stability of the perovskite/mica interface, resulting in layer-by-layer growth of the perovskite. Hence, the 2D perovskites possess high-quality crystalline structures. With high permittivity, the as-grown 2D CH3NH3PbX3 perovskites exhibited superior optical and photoelectrical properties with respect to the layered perovskites; therefore, a photoresponsivity of 126 A W−1 and a bandwidth exceeding 80 kHz in visible light were achieved. Liquid-phase growth on mica was demonstrated to be a generalized and low-cost route to grow 2D perovskites, which provides a novel material platform for device applications and fundamental investigations.
Experimental
The liquid-phase growth and device fabrication of 2D MAPbX3 perovskites
The single-crystalline growth solution was prepared using the crystallization techniques described in our previous work,48 which was demonstrated to be an effective precursor solution to grow high-quality bulk crystals. For the MAPbBr3 preparation, the first step was methylamine bromide synthesis by reacting methylamine, 40 wt% in aqueous solution, with bromic acid (HBr), 48 wt% in water. Typically, a mixture of 7 ml HBr and 9 ml methylamine was taken in a round bottom flask and stirred at 0 °C for 2 h; then, the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator until white MABr powder crystallized. The obtained salt was washed and filtered three times with diethyl ether. In the second step, the prepared MABr powder was mixed with PbBr2 in a 1:1 mol ratio in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The mixed solution was stirred for 12 h until the solids dissolved completely; then, oleic acid (OA) was added in different amounts. For MAPbCl3, MAPbI3 and CsPbBr3 crystallization, the solvents were dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and DMF, respectively. All the reactants were purchased from Alfa-Aesar.
Ultrathin 2D perovskite sheets were grown on freshly cleaved mica substrates using a liquid-phase method. First, the mica was cleaved into two pieces using a surgical blade. One piece was used as the substrate, and the other was used as a cover to confine the vertical growth of the perovskite. The prepared MAPbBr3 solution (dissolved in DMF at a concentration of 0.2 M) was dipped on the freshly cleaved surface of the mica substrate; then, this substrate was covered with the other piece of mica. The combination was fastened using tape and spun at 3000 rpm for 3 s in order to decrease the solution thickness. Then, the combination was placed on a heating stage for 2 h, and ultrathin 2D perovskite sheets with thicknesses on the nanometer scale and sizes of several micrometers were obtained on the mica substrate. The OA in solution could attach to the surface of the grown perovskite, which confined the crystal growth at the molecular level. Finally, a 50 nm-thick gold electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation with a shadow mask. The completed devices were stored in a nitrogen environment for further use.
Structure and morphology
The bright field and fluorescence images of the 2D perovskites were observed with an Olympus optical microscope (BX53-fluorescence). The fluorescence mode of BX53 uses a fluorescence filter with a medium sized band-pass excitation filter (450 to 490 nm) and a long-pass barrier filter (515 nm cut-on). The thickness and surface morphology of 2D perovskites were measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM, WITec Alpha 300 A) in tapping mode. The as-grown 2D perovskites were identified using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku MAX-RD). The electron diffraction pattern of the crystal lattice was analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL, JEM-1011). TEM samples were prepared using a lacey carbon Cu grid to scratch the surface of the mica substrate. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB250Xi instrument with a mono-chromated Al X-ray source. The power was 150 W and the spot size was 50 micrometers.
Optical characterization
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured with a confocal micro-Raman system (WITec, Alpha 300 A). The sample was excited with a fiber-coupled laser source with a 405 nm wavelength. The laser beam was focused by a microscope into a small focal volume on the surface of the sheets. The typical spot size was about 2 μm. The laser power was maintained at less than 1 mW to avoid laser-induced damage on the sample surface. Time-resolved PL spectra were acquired using time-resolved confocal fluorescence microscopy (PicoQuant, MicroTime 200). The steady-state optical absorption was determined with a micro-spectrophotometer (CRAIC, 20/30 PV Tm). To eliminate the influence of the mica substrate, we calibrated the results by measuring the absorption spectra of the same mica substrate. All experimental measurements were carried out at room temperature.
Device characterization
The 2D perovskite-based photodetector was characterized using a home-built photocurrent analyzer. The monochromatic light at 450 nm wavelength was provided by a semiconductor diode laser (Thorlabs, LP450-SF15), and the light intensity was calibrated using an optical power meter (Thorlabs, S121C). The photocurrent of the detector was first amplified by a low noise current preamplifier (Stanford, SR570); then, the output signal was recorded using a digital source meter (Keithley, 2612B). The time-dependent photoresponse signal was recorded using a digital oscilloscope (National Instruments, PXI-5122) with 50 Ohm input impedance. The 3 dB bandwidth was measured using a lock-in-amplifier (Stanford, SR830). All measurements were performed using a probe station on a floating table to minimize vibrational noise.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
The electronic structures of the perovskite crystal and the perovskite/mica interface were determined using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were used for the electronic exchange correlation potential. The cutoff energy of the wave functions was set to 400 eV. The exchange–correlation potential was described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The vdW-DF dispersion correction was introduced to describe the van der Waals interactions of the organic molecules. The convergence criterion for the ionic relaxation was set at 10−4 eV per atom, and the remnant force of each atom was smaller than 3 × 10−3 Å−1. For the estimation of the perovskite/mica interface, the perovskite (001) slab model contained four layers, and the vacuum distance was set to be 25 Å to eliminate interactions with the adjacent layer. Due to the large lattice mismatch, it was difficult to construct the interface model of the perovskite and mica. In this work, the equilibrium K atoms (about 1.5 K atoms per unit cell of the perovskite) were placed on the perovskite (001) surface to serve as a model of the mica (001) surface. Consequently, we performed the calculations with various K adatoms adsorbed on the perovskite surface. The K adatoms and the top Pb–Br octahedra layer were allowed to relax, while the three bottom layers were fixed. The Monkhorst–Pack set of a 9 × 9 × 1 k-grid was used to sample the Brillouin zone (BZ) for the geometry optimization, and a denser sampling of 15 × 15 × 1 was used for the electronic structure calculations.
