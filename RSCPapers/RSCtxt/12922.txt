    , Accepted 31st July 2022First published on 2nd August 2022AbstractCopper selenide (Cu1.8Se) and silver selenide (Ag2Se) have garnered unprecedented attention as efficient absorber materials for cost-effective and sustainable solar cells. Phase pure preparation of these exotic materials in a nano-regime is highly desirable. This account outlines a simple and easily scalable pathway to Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se nanocrystals using novel complexes [Cu{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}]4 (1), [Ag{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}]6 (2) and [Ag{2-SeC5H3(Me-5)N}]6·2C6H5CH3 (3·2C6H5CH3) as single source molecular precursors (SSPs). Structural studies revealed that the Cu and Ag complexes crystallize into tetrameric and hexameric forms, respectively. This observed structural diversity in the complexes has been rationalized via DFT calculations and attributed to metal–metal bond endorsed energetics. The thermolysis at relatively lower temperature in oleylamine of complex 1 afforded cubic berzelianite Cu1.8Se and complexes 2 and 3 produced orthorhombic naumannite Ag2Se nanocrystals. The low temperature synthesis of these nanocrystals seems to be driven by the observed preformed Cu4Se4 and Ag6Se6 core in the complexes which have close resemblance with the bulk structure of the final materials (Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se). The crystal structure, phase purity, morphology, elemental composition and band gap of these nanocrystals were determined from pXRD, electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), EDS and DRS-UV, respectively. The band gap of these nanocrystals lies in the range suitable for solar cell applications. Finally, these nanocrystal-based prototype photo-electrochemical cells exhibit high photoresponsivity and stability under alternating light and dark conditions.
Introduction
Semiconductor transition metal chalcogenide nanocrystals are attractive functional materials for addressing the concern arising due to diminishing fossil fuel reserves and pollution associated with burning of the same.1–3 In particular, coinage metal selenides exhibit outstanding performance in energy related applications resulting from their excellent intrinsic properties, tuneable direct band gaps (Eg = 0.15–2.0 eV),4 high absorption coefficients and charge concentration and low thermal conductivity.5 Moreover, having environment compatibility, high abundance and low cost, they have been projected as potential alternatives for materials based on toxic elements (Cd and Pb) and scarce elements (Ga and Te). In this context, the functional properties and band gaps of coinage metal chalcogenides can be tuned to optimize their performance for solar cells.6,7 Moreover, these materials also find widespread applications in high performance thermoelectric devices8,9 and photocatalysis.10,11 Coinage metal chalcogenides, in their nano-form, have also emerged as potential candidates for new-generation energy storage devices12,13 and biomedical applications.14,15
Owing to the multi-dimensional applications of coinage metal chalcogenides, several synthetic protocols have been adopted to access these materials. Among them, solution phase soft chemical routes to nanocrystals exhibit many distinct advantages over traditional ceramic routes such as lower temperature synthesis of nanocrystals with high homogeneity.16,17 Solution phase pathways can be classified as a single source molecular precursor (SSP) route and a dual source precursor route. Unlike the SSP route where constituent elements of nanocrystals are present within the molecule, the dual source route employs a complex mixture of reagents, often including environmentally hazardous chemicals to access the desired nanocrystals. Moreover, SSPs offer several distinct advantages over the dual precursor route in terms of lower defect concentration and ability to produce nanomaterials under milder conditions and with better control over their stoichiometries with good reproducibility.18,19 Despite this, only a handful of SSPs have been developed and utilized to produce coinage metal chalcogenides.20–27
Some early reports on the preparation of copper selenides through molecular precursors include the utilization of metal chalcogenolates, selenocarbamates, phosphine diselenolates, etc. For instance, Brennan and co-workers utilized copper selenolates [Cu(2-SeNC5H4)]4 and [Cu(3-Me3Si-2-SeNC5H3)]4 to prepare the Cu2−xSe material.27 Similarly, Gupta et al. used a copper phenylselenolate complex for the preparation of Cu6Se4.5 which was further used as a catalyst for cross-dehydrogenative coupling of tertiary amines with terminal alkynes.23 Diisopropyldiselenophosphinato and diselenocarbamato complexes of copper have also been explored for the facile preparation of copper selenides as reported by Malik et al. and Dhayal et al., respectively.21,22 Hsu et al. have reported the synthesis of copper selenides utilizing an SSP [Cu4{Se2P(OiPr)2}4].28 Unlike copper selenides, very few reports on the development of SSPs for silver chalcogenide materials can be found in the literature. They include the decomposition of [Ag{SeC4H(Me-4,6)2N2}]6·6MeOH·H2O to prepare Ag2Se as reported by Sharma et al.25 and the utilization of [Ag4(TFA)4(tBu2S)4] for synthesizing the Ag2S material by Gahlot et al.29
Previously, we have extensively utilized metal complexes with internally functionalized hemilabile chalcogenolate ligands to afford high quality nanocrystals and thin films which have been evaluated for their photo-responsive behaviour and energy storage applications.30–32 Extending our quest to molecular precursors for coinage metal chalcogenides, in this article, we present the synthesis and characterization of novel air stable copper and silver complexes with 5-methyl-2-pyridylselenolate and 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridylselenolate ligands. The utility of these complexes as suitable SSPs for the preparation of highly photo-responsive phase pure copper and silver selenide materials has been successfully demonstrated by low temperature thermolysis of the same. The results of this work are described herein.
Experimental
Materials and methods
Anhydrous cuprous chloride (CuCl), silver nitrate (AgNO3), oleylamine (OAm) and analytical grade solvents were procured from commercial sources. Bis(5-methyl-2-pyridyl)diselenide, {SeC5H3(Me-5)N}2 [1H NMR (CDCl3) δ: 2.29 (s, Me), 7.36 (d, 8 Hz, H-4), 7.70 (d, 8 Hz, H-3), 8.28 (s, H-6); 77Se{1H} NMR (CDCl3) d: 451.7 ppm] and bis(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)diselenide, {SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}2 [1H NMR (CDCl3) δ: 2.25 (s, 3H, 4-Me); 2.52 (s, 3H, 6-Me); 6.77 (s, 1H, H-5); 7.48 (s, 1H, H-3); 77Se{1H} NMR (CDCl3) δ: 433.9 ppm] were prepared according to literature methods.30,33
Elemental analyses were carried out on a Thermo Fischer Flash EA-1112 CHNS analyzer. The 1H, 13C{1H} and 77Se{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-II NMR spectrometer operating at 300, 75.47, 57.24 and 111.92 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts are relative to the internal chloroform peak for 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra and external Ph2Se2 (δ: 463 ppm relative to Me2Se) in CDCl3 for 77Se{1H} NMR spectra. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Netzsch STA 409 PC-Luxx TG-DTA instrument, which was calibrated with CaC2O4·H2O. The TG curve was recorded at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under the flow of argon. X-Ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained on a Philips PW-1820 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis on the samples were performed at 4064 eV photon energy on the PES-BL14 beamline (BARC) at Indus-2, RRCAT, Indore, India. As an internal reference for the absolute binding energy, the C-1s peak (284.5 eV) was used. All the deconvolutions and fittings were done by the CasaXPS software. Optical diffuse reflectance measurements in the range 200–1800 nm (0.68 to 6.2 eV) was conducted on a two-beam spectrometer (V-670, JASCO) with a diffuse reflectance (DR) attachment consisting of an integration sphere coated with BaSO4 which was used as a reference for the same. Measured reflectance data were converted to absorption (A) using the Kubelka–Munk remission function.34 The band gaps of the nanostructures were calculated by extrapolating the linear portion of the plot to X (energy) axis. SEM and EDS and 2-D elemental mapping measurements were carried out on ULTRA 55 FESEM of Zeiss and Oxford Inca instruments, respectively. A Zeiss Libra 200 FE transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV was used for bright field TEM studies. The samples for TEM were prepared by placing a drop of sample dispersed in chloroform on a carbon coated copper grid.
X-ray crystallography
The intensity data for [Cu{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}]4 (1), [Ag{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}]6 (2) and [Ag{2-SeC5H3(Me-5)N}]6·2C6H5CH3 (3·2C6H5CH3) were collected at room temperature (298 ± 2 K) on a XtaLAB Synergy, Dualflex, HyPix four-circle diffractometer with a micro-focus sealed X-ray tube using a mirror as a monochromator and a HyPix detector. The unit cell parameters determined from the analysis are given in Table 1. The diffractometer was equipped with a low-temperature device and used Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). All data were integrated with CrysAlis PRO and a multi-scan absorption correction using SCALE3 ABSPACK was applied.35 The structures were solved by iterative methods using SUPERFLIP and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods against F2 usingSHELXL-2017/1.36 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. The hydrogen atoms were refined isotropically on calculated positions using a riding model with their Uiso values constrained to 1.5 times the Ueq of their pivot atoms for terminal sp3 carbon atoms and 1.2 times for all other carbon atoms. Molecular structures were drawn using ORTEP.37

Computational studies
All calculations were carried out using the ab initio molecular orbital theory based LCAO approach as implemented in the GAMESS software.38 Geometry optimization (without any symmetry constrain) was done using the hybrid B3LYP39,40 exchange correlation energy functional. The notation B3 implies three parameter Becke exchange functional and the LYP indicates correlation as described by Lee–Yang–Parr. A standard split-valence with polarization functions (6-31G(d))41 was employed as the basis set for all low Z elements, and the SBKJC42 standard basis set was used for Copper and Silver.
Syntheses of copper and silver selenide nanostructures
Copper selenide nanostructures were prepared utilizing [Cu{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}]4 (1) while silver selenide nanostructures were synthesized employing both [Ag{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}]6 (2) and [Ag{2-SeC5H3(Me-5)N}]6·2C6H5CH3 (3·2C6H5CH3) as molecular precursors. All the nanostructures were synthesized by thermolysis employing the heat-up method and OAm was chosen as the reaction solvent. In a typical heat-up method, 10 mL of OAm was taken in a three-necked round bottom flask along with 300 mg of each precursor in three different set of experiments. The reaction mixture was then degassed at 120 °C under nitrogen flow for 30 min to remove residual moisture. Subsequently, the temperature was elevated to 200 °C and the reaction was continued for 10 minutes while maintaining the temperature, after which the heat source was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to 60 °C followed by the addition of 5 mL of methanol to ensure the complete precipitation of nanostructures. The synthesized materials were collected after repeated washing with methanol and toluene mixture followed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove the excess capping agent. Finally, all the nanostructures were isolated as black residue.
Photo-electrochemical cell experiment
The photo-responsivity of the nanostructures was measured in a photoelectrochemical cell prepared by using silicon/Cu1.8Se or silicon/Ag2Se geometry as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter and pseudo reference electrodes, respectively and Na2S (0.6 M):Na2SO3 (0.8 M) (1:2) as the electrolyte. The working electrode (silicon/Cu1.8Se or silicon/Ag2Se) was prepared by drop casting a colloidal solution of Cu1.8Se or Ag2Se nanostructures in toluene on the rough surface of n-type Si wafer of (100) orientation having thickness of 200 μm and resistivity of 1–10 Ω cm. The drop cast film was dried at 150 °C for 2 h. The process was repeated many times until a uniform coating was obtained on the silicon surface. Fluorescent white lamp (36 W, UV content <3%) was used as the radiation source with light intensity at the cell being 200 μW cm−2.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and spectroscopy
Treatment of CuCl with sodium 4,6-methyl-2-pyridylselenolate, NaSeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N and reaction of AgNO3 with both sodium 5-methyl-2-pyridylselenolate, NaSeC5H3(Me-5)N and sodium 4,6-methyl-2-pyridylselenolate, NaSeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N in methanolic solution yielded the corresponding selenolate complexes: [Cu{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}]4 (1), [Ag{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}]6 (2) and [Ag{2-SeC5H3(Me-5)N}]6·2C6H5CH3 (3·2C6H5CH3) (Scheme 1). The NMR spectra of the complexes were recorded in CDCl3 where the 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra shows expected resonances and peak multiplicities. The 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra of 1 and 2 exhibited two separate resonances for methyl groups due to non-equivalence of the same of the bridging 4,6-methyl-2-pyridylselenolate ligand. In all the three complexes, the signals for the pyridyl ring protons are shifted to up field as compared to the same in the corresponding diselenide. The 77Se{1H} NMR spectra of all the complexes displayed single resonances which are considerably shielded with respect to the 77Se{1H} signal for the corresponding diselenides (ESI Fig. S.1–S.3†). The appearance of single resonance peak in all the complexes confirms the absence of any other selenium containing species which in turn complements the purity of the complexes.

The complex 1 crystallizes with the unit cell (Z = 4) having a monoclinic crystal system with the space group P21/C. The complex comprises of a distorted tetrahedral core of four copper atoms connected to each other through Cu–Cu bonds along with bridging 4,6-dimethylpyridylselenolate ligands. Each copper atom adopts a bicapped tetrahedral configuration43 defined by the pyridyl nitrogen atom, two bridging selenium atoms and three adjacent copper atoms. Each copper atom is linked to the other three copper atoms with the Cu–Cu distances ranging between 2.5731(9) and 2.8773(8) Å. These distances are well within the range as reported for some analogous tetranuclear pyridine-2-selenolatecomplexes: [Cu{SeC5H3(R-3)N}]4 [R = H (Cu–Cu = 2.68 Å), SiMe3 (Cu–Cu = 2.73 Å)];27 [Cu{2-SeC5H3(Me-5)N}]4 (Cu–Cu = 2.68 Å);20 [Cu{SeC5H3(Me-3)N}]4 (Cu–Cu = 2.66 Å)44 and can also be compared with some dissimilar tetranuclear copper complex viz. [CuI(py)]4 (Cu–Cu = 2.69 Å).45 However, these bond distances are considerably shorter than the same reported for hexanuclear pyridine 2-thiolate complexes of the type [Cu{SC5H3(R-3)N}]6 [R = SiMe3 (Cu–Cu = 3.14 Å);46 H (Cu–Cu = 2.95 Å)47] and few halogen-bridged tetranuclear cubane type copper complexes with phosphorus donors, having a Cu4X4 core, [CuX(PR3)]4 (X = Cl or Br; Cu–Cu = 2.99–3.98 Å).48 Moreover, the average Cu–Se (2.38 Å) and the Cu–N (2.00 Å) bond distances are also in agreement with the same reported for complexes having Cu–Se and Cu–N bonds, e.g. [Cu{SeC5H3(Me-3)N}]4 (Cu–Se = 2.40 Å and Cu–N = 2.00 Å)49 and [Cu{Se2P(OiPr)2}]4 (Cu–Se = 2.38 Å).28 The crystal packing diagram of 1 along the b-axis (ESI Fig. S.4a†) shows that the [Cu{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}]4 asymmetric units are held together in the 3D structure through short contacts between two neighboring molecules involving Se2 atom of one asymmetric unit and H20A atom another unit creating an infinite chain of bonded network (C20–H20A⋯Se2 = 2.992 Å). The view along the c-axis (ESI Fig. S.4b†) depicts that these infinite chain assemblies are interlocked to the adjacent chain through C21–H21C⋯Se2 (3.010 Å) and C21–H21B⋯C4(π) (2.893 Å) interactions. Both the C20–H20A⋯Se2 and C21–H21C⋯Se2 distances are shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two atoms involved (3.1 Å) indicating the presence of strong non-bonding secondary interactions, whereas the C21–H21B⋯C4(π) distances are comparable with the sum of the van der Waals radii (2.9 Å) indicating comparatively weak interactions.
The complexes 2 and 3 crystallizes in monoclinic (Z = 2) and triclinic (Z = 1) crystal systems with the space group P21/n and P, respectively. In both the complexes, each ligand is bonded to three different silver atoms, the coordination pattern being, nitrogen atom bonded to one silver atom while the selenium atom is bridging the other two metallic silver atoms. Interestingly, each silver atom in the molecule is also coordinated by three different ligands. The six silver atoms in both the cases are arranged in a highly distorted hexanuclear fashion forming the Ag6 core. Each silver atom is connected to the next silver atom through the bridging selenium atom from the ligand and Ag–Ag intermetallic bonds. Alternatively, these structures can also be described by two six-membered mutually parallel Ag3Se3 rings adopting a staggered conformation (Fig. 2). In each ring, silver and selenium atoms are alternatively arranged. These two staggered Ag3Se3 rings are interconnected to each other through Ag–Ag intermetallic linkages forming the Ag6Se6 core, which exhibit different bonding patterns in 2 and 3. In the case of 2, each silver atom is bonded to two bridging selenium atoms, two neighbouring silver atoms and one nitrogen atom from the ligand which compels each silver atom to adopt a distorted square pyramidal geometry. On the contrary, the molecular structure of 3 features two hepta-coordinated and four hexa-coordinated silver atoms. The local coordination around the two hepta-coordinated silver atoms can be considered as capped trigonal prismatic, generated by four neighbouring silver, two selenium and one nitrogen atoms whereas the coordination environment of the four hexa-coordinated silver atoms are bicapped tetrahedron, designated by three neighbouring silver, two selenium and one nitrogen atoms. To the best of authors knowledge, very few of these kinds of homoleptic multinuclear silver cluster complexes with a bridging chalcogenolate ligand have been reported so far25 and the compound [Ag{2-SeC5H3(Me-5)N}]6·2C6H5CH3 (3·2C6H5CH3) is probably the first example of such complexes where in a single molecule, silver atoms exhibit diverse coordination geometry. The Ag–Se bond distances lie in the range 2.5681(4)–2.5896(4) and 2.5535(6)–2.5980(6) Å whereas the Ag–N bond distances range from 2.303(3) to 2.307(3) and 2.311(4) to 2.339(4) Å for 2 and 3 respectively. These distances can be compared with the same reported for some similar type of complexes viz. [Ag{SeC5H3(SiMe3-6)N}]6 (Ag–Se = 2.5943(14)–2.6044(13) Å and Ag–N = 2.320(6)–2.386(6) Å)50 and [Ag{SeC4H(Me-4,6)2N2}]6·6MeOH·H2O (Ag–Se = 2.5337(10)–2.6158(11) Å and Ag–N = 2.329(5) Å).25 The Ag–N bond distance observed in the present study can also be compared with the same observed for the hexanuclear silver thiolate complex [Ag(SC5H4N)]6 (Ag–N = 2.367(5) Å) and polymeric [Ag6(μ3-SC5H4N)4(μ4-SC5H4N)2]n (Ag–N = 2.277 (15) Å).51 The Ag–Ag intermetallic distances for 2 and 3 are in the range 2.5681(4)–2.9656(4) and 3.2958(5)–3.2958(5) Å which are considerably shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of two silver atoms (3.4 Å). This confirms the presence of strong argentophilic interactions between them. These distances can also be compared with those found in other silver chalcogenolates, e.g. [Ag(SC5H4N)]6 (Ag–Ag = 2.959(2)–3.369(3) Å)51 and [Ag8{SeC6H2(iPr-2,4,6)3}8] (Ag–Ag = 2.885(2)–3.258(1) Å).52 Moreover, due to the difference in bonding nature and coordination environment around the silver atoms in 2 and 3, the Ag–Ag–Ag bond angles also exhibit contrasting features in both the complexes. In the case of 2, all the Ag–Ag–Ag bond angles are comparable and fall in the range 72.714(11) to 75.482(11)° whereas the same for 3 shows two categories of Ag–Ag–Ag bond angles which are distinctly different and are in the range 56.226(12)–63.269(13) and 87.809(14)–92.192(14)°. The Ag–Ag–Ag angles in 2 are comparable but the same in 3 are quite different from that observed in the reported complex [Ag{SeC4H(Me-4,6)2N2}]6·6MeOH·H2O (average ∠Ag–Ag–Ag = 72.27(3)°).25 The different bonding pattern in the Ag6Se6 core is also manifested in the Ag–Se–Ag bond angles which is longer in 2 (average ∠Ag–Se–Ag = 87.268°) than that of 3 (average ∠Ag–Se–Ag = 76.204°).

From the crystal packing diagram of 2 along the b-axis (ESI Fig. S.5a†), it can be understood that the individual [Ag{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}]6 units are connected to each other through short contacts involving Se2 and C18–H18 atoms of neighboring units (C18–H18⋯Se2 = 3.032 Å). Along with these interactions, there are several weak π interactions also (C18–H18⋯C8(π) = 2.889, C18–H18⋯C9(π) = 2.719, C21–H21C⋯C18(π) = 2.877 Å). The perspective view of crystal packing diagram along the a-axis reveals that these networks are held together in three dimensional structures through strong non-bonding secondary C2–H2⋯Se2 (3.014 Å), C6–H6B⋯Se3 (3.072 Å) and C11–H11⋯Se3 (3.033 Å) interactions (ESI Fig. S.5b†). The complex 3 crystallizes with two molecules of toluene which make its crystal packing diagram (ESI Fig. S.6†) quite different from that of 2. The view along the c-axis reveals that the asymmetric units form an infinite network featuring short contacts between Se2 and C18–H18 atoms of neighboring units (C18–H18⋯Se2 = 3.032 Å). These assemblies are interlinked to the successive assemblies through toluene molecules. The packing is achieved to construct the 3D structure via weak C20–H20⋯C10 (2.856 Å) and C11–H11⋯C25 (2.850 Å) π interactions. These distances are almost comparable with the sum of their corresponding van der Waals radii referring to weak but ample interaction between them.
It is worth mentioning that the structural diversity of these kinds of chalcogen bridged homoleptic complexes of coinage metals with internally functionalized hemilabile ligands depends to a great extent on the nature of the ligand attached to them. For example, copper produces tetranuclear complexes with 2-chalcogenolate ligands containing the pyridyl moiety,25 whereas the same with the pyrimidyl moiety always results in a hexanuclear complex irrespective of the nature and number of substituents.20,37,43,48 On the contrary, the silver complexes with similar type of ligands always yield exclusively hexanuclear complexes.25,50–52 To establish a suitable rationale behind this observation, theoretical investigation was carried out.
Computational studies
Computational studies were carried out to establish the argument behind the ligand dependent nuclearity of the Cu and Ag complexes. For this purpose, reaction enthalpy for the complexes has been calculated by total energies in the following manner (M = Metal, L = Ligand):4M + 4L → (ML)4 + ΔH (enthalpy per metal ligand unit → ΔH/4)6M + 6L → (ML)6 + ΔH (enthalpy per metal ligand unit → ΔH/6)

Table 3 shows the calculated reaction enthalpy for tetranuclear and hexanuclear complexes of copper and silver. In line with the experimental results, it is found that while silver energetically favours hexanuclear complexes, on the contrary copper energetically preferers tetranuclear complexes. Thus, nuclearity of the complexes appears to be controlled by the energetics. Furthermore, it is observed that the average Ag–Ag distance in silver complexes is almost ∼12% higher than the Cu counterpart as shown in Table 2. It is worth mentioning here that for bulk silver metal (lattice constant: 4.09 Å, cohesive energy 2.95 eV per atom) lattice parameters are also ∼13% longer than respective bulk Cu (lattice constant: 3.61 Å, cohesive energy 3.49 eV per atom). Shorter metal–metal bonds lead to higher binding/cohesive energy of bulk copper in comparison with bulk silver. In the present case of complexes also, shorter metal–metal bonds in copper complexes lead to higher reaction enthalpies in comparison with the silver counterpart. Even though the energetics of complex is joint manifestation of both metal–metal and metal–ligand interactions, nuclearity of complexes is expected to have crucial role of metal–metal interactions and balanced outcome of energetics decides the overall stability of complexes. The higher metal–metal bond strength of Cu–Cu bonds (shorter Cu–Cu bonds) in comparison with the silver counterpart is attributed for preferred energetics and in turn observed nuclearity in their respective complexes.

Thermal studies
To have an insight into the thermal stability of the complexes, thermogravimetry (TG) analysis was performed. TG study and the subsequent weight loss calculations also provide valuable information about the composition of the residue formed during the decomposition which, in turn, can validate the suitability of a precursor for the preparation of the corresponding metal chalcogenide material. From the TG and DTG plots presented in Fig. 3a, it is inferred that the complex 1 is stable up to 280 °C. Beyond that point, it undergoes a single step decomposition and the weight loss observed (85.02%) can be assigned to the formation of CuSe (calculated weight loss 85.34%). To further ascertain the nature of the TG residue obtained from 1, pXRD of the same was recorded which reveals the formation of hexagonal CuSe (JCPDS 27-0185) (ESI Fig. S.7a†). The silver complex 2 undergoes two-step decomposition whereas in the case of 3, single step decomposition behaviour was observed. Both the silver complexes decompose in the temperature range 340–360 °C (Fig. 3b and c). The weight loss observed in 2 and 3 is 85.02 and 82.9% respectively which are well in agreement with the calculated weight losses for their complete conversion into Ag2Se (calculated weight loss for the formation of Ag2Se from 2 and 3 are 83.9 and 84.2% respectively). The pXRD patterns of the TG residue obtained from 2 and 3 further confirm the formation of Ag2Se (JCPDS 24-1041) (ESI Fig. S.7b and c†). These pXRD patterns differ in their peak intensity ratio, which may be attributed to the presence different ligand systems in the precursors. Furthermore, in all the three cases, it was also observed that there was a gradual weight loss up to 800 °C which may be due to the loss of Se. Previously, it has been reported that Se volatilizes at higher temperatures which results in such TG signatures in metal selenolate complexes.53

Preparation and characterization of metal selenide nanostructures
From the thermal decomposition behaviour of the complexes, it is evident that these complexes get rid of their organic counterparts at elevated temperature to yield the corresponding metal selenides. Thus, it was inferred that complexes 1, 2 and 3 can serve as single source molecular precursors for the synthesis of technologically important copper and silver selenide materials. Moreover, it will be interesting to understand the effect of different bonding features observed in complex 2 and 3 (refer to Fig. 2) on the composition and morphology of the final thermolyzed product.
Accordingly, these complexes were thermolyzed in oleylamine (OAm). The solvent OAm was primarily chosen due to the fact that it can perform as a high boiling reaction solvent (boiling point 350 °C), strong coordinating or capping agent and catalyzes the thermally induced decomposition of complexes at temperature lower than their decomposition temperature.54 All the nanostructures were synthesized by the heat-up method at 200 °C for 10 minutes. In all the three cases, it was noted that below 200 °C, the complexes decomposes partially while around ∼200 °C, complete decomposition of the complexes takes place. Moreover, another important point to note that above 220 °C, the silver complexes, 2 and 3 decomposes to produce silver mirror which could have caused the incorporation of Ag impurities in the final product. Considering these observations, 200 °C was set as the thermolysis temperature for all the three precursors. It is to be noted that the thermolysis temperature (200 °C) is significantly lower than the decomposition temperature as inferred initially from TG analysis which indicates that OAm facilitates the decomposition by acting as a catalyst in the thermolysis of the complexes.
The phase purity and crystal structure of the synthesized nanostructures was evaluated by pXRD analysis (Fig. 4). The Bragg's reflections at 2θ = 27.2, 31.4, 44.8, 53.0 and 65.2 in the pXRD pattern of the nanostructures produced by the thermolysis of 1 can be indexed to the reflections originating from (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes of the cubic Cu1.8Se material (JCPDS 71-0044) while the same originating from the pXRD analysis of nanostructures produced by the thermolysis of 2 and 3 can be assigned to the formation of the orthorhombic Ag2Se material (JCPDS 24-1041). The appearance of sharp reflection peaks in pXRD indicates the formation of a perfectly crystalline phase in all the nanostructures while the absence of any reflections from individual elements or any other phase/composition of copper and silver selenides in their respective nanostructures confirms the phase purity of the synthesized materials. The average crystallite sizes as deduced from the Scherrer equation55 were found to be ∼39.8, 53.2 and 50.2 nm for Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se nanostructures synthesized from 1, 2 and 3 respectively. At this point it is worth mentioning that the Scherrer equation is often used to estimate the crystallite size by correlating the scattering domain size and the line broadening in the pXRD pattern. However, there are other factors that could contribute in peak broadening observed in pXRD patterns, including crystal distortions and defect sites. To have a better insight into the composition of synthesized nanostructures, EDS analysis was carried out (ESI Fig. S.8†). The study revealed that the atomic ratio of Cu:Se is 1.76:1 (63.8:36.2) confirming the formation of Cu1.8Se from the thermolysis of 1 whereas the atomic ratio of Ag:Se was found to be 2.11:1 (68.1:31.9) and 2.09:1 (67.7:32.3) for materials produced from 2 and 3 respectively supporting the fact that in both the cases, Ag2Se is formed. In order to confirm whether the constituent elements are homogeneously distributed in the samples, 2-D elemental mapping was performed which showed the uniform distribution within the nanostructures (ESI Fig. S.9†).

(e) Simulated XRD pattern of orthorhombic Ag2Se (JCPDS 24-1041). 
These nanostructures were further characterized by XPS analysis for a better understanding of their purity and oxidation states. The Cu 2p XPS spectra as presented in Fig. 5a show splitting due to the presence of both Cu+ and Cu2+ ions. These peak positions are consistent with those reported in the literature for the mixed-valent Cu1.8Se material.56 The occurrence of the prominent satellite peak is due to the presence of paramagnetic Cu2+.57Fig. 5b and c show the Ag 3d spectra of the Ag2Se nanostructures synthesized from 2 and 3. Both the spectra feature 3d doublets with peaks at 373.6 and 367.7 eV having spin–orbit separation of 5.9 eV. These values can be well matched with those reported for the Ag2Se material.58 The XPS spectra of selenium in all the three cases represent a peak at 53.9 eV (Fig. 5d, e and f) corresponding to Se 3d and confirms that the only selenium species present in all the samples is Se2−, which are in agreement with literature values.59 Furthermore, from the analyses, it is also inferred that there is no indication of selenium oxidation in the samples (ESI Fig. S.10†) and the low intensity peak ∼532 eV may be attributed to adsorbed oxygen.60

The morphology of the Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se nanostructures was studied by electron microscopic techniques. The SEM image of the Cu1.8Se nanoparticles (Fig. 6a) synthesized from 1 reveals a polygonal shaped morphology featuring both soft and sharp-edged particles. Interestingly, the SEM micrographs depict the formation of spherical Ag2Se nanostructures from both 2 and 3 precursors, even though they exhibit a different kind of bonding in their molecular structure (Fig. 6b and c). These observations were well corroborated by the TEM analysis where polygonal shaped particles with both soft and sharp-edges and spherical nanocrystals were observed for Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se synthesized from 1, 2 and 3 respectively (Fig. 6d, e and f). Distinct spots along with concentric rings appeared in the corresponding selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (ESI Fig. S.11†) which reveals the nanocrystalline nature of all the nanostructures. A comparison of the observed morphologies and composition of the materials obtained from the precursors under the present work with those reported earlier is given in Table 4.

Upon careful inspection, a close resemblance among the Cu4Se4 core in molecular precursor 1 and Ag6Se6 cores in molecular precursors 2 and 3 can be visualized with the bulk crystal structure of cubic berzelianite Cu1.8Se and orthorhombic naumannite Ag2Se materials, respectively. This resemblance has been pictorially presented in Fig. 7. Fig. 7a shows the tetrahedral arrangement present in Cu1.8Se (which is indeed expected from its space group Fmm) and its resemblance with the Cu4Se4 core present in the molecular precursor 1. In the case of orthorhombic Ag2Se, along the ‘a’ direction there is an extended polymeric zig-zag chain of Ag atoms. Viewing these multiple linear chains along the ‘a’ direction collectively gives close resemblance with the stacked molecular precursor Ag6Se6 core as shown in Fig. 7b and ESI Fig. S.12.† Overall, the observed close resemblance in “Cu4Se4” and “Ag6Se6” cores of the precursors with the respective crystal structure of Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se is expected to facilitate the low-temperature synthesis of phase pure coinage metal chalcogenides.

In the crystal structure of cubic Cu1.8Se, fractionally occupant Cu atoms inside Cu tetrahedra have been omitted for clarity of presentation. 
Optical properties
Cu1.8Se nanostructures exhibit impressive performance in optoelectronic, nonlinear optics and photovoltaic devices owing to the suitable narrow band gap along with efficient absorption and sensitivity.61 Ag2Se nanostructures, owing to their good chemical stability and excellent emission in the second near-infrared region (II-NIR, 1000–1400 nm), have found unprecedented applications in bio-medical fields such as the bio detection of cancer cells or in vivo imaging.62 Moreover, these materials in nano-regime find relevance in solar cells, thin-film transistors, optical detectors, infrared sensors, optical filters, etc.63 The bulk direct band gap of Cu1.8Se is 2.1 eV (ref. 64) while the same for Ag2Se is 0.15 eV.63 Considering the influence of optical band gap in nanoelectronics, the optical properties of the synthesized nanostructures were investigated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and the optical band gaps of these materials were determined by using a plot of Kubelka–Munk function, F(R) as expressed in the following equation:[F(R)hν]n = A(hν − Eg)where hν is photon energy, A is a constant, Eg denotes the band gap, and n depends on the nature of optical transition.
The direct band gap was calculated using Tauc's model (n = 2). It was observed that the direct optical band gaps of Cu1.8Se synthesized from 1 were 2.62 eV (Fig. 8a), whereas the same for Ag2Se prepared from 2 and 3 was evaluated to be 1.16 and 1.19 eV (Fig. 8b and c), respectively. These observed band gap values are well comparable with those reported in the literature for similarly sized Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se nanoparticles. For example, the band gap value in the range 2.74–2.86 eV for Cu1.8Se nanoparticles with average crystallite size of 31–42 nm have been reported by a number of research groups,20,65 whereas Chougale et al. have observed a direct band gap value in the range 1.1–1.3 eV for Ag2Se nanocrystals having particle size 63–75 nm.66 The direct band gap values observed in the present study for Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se are distinctly blue shifted as compared to their bulk counterpart (Eg = 2.1 and 0.15 eV for bulk Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se respectively). A blue shift in the direct band gap is either due to lattice distortions or surface lattice defect or quantum confinement or surface effect of the carriers.67 It is to be noted that the theoretically calculated exciton Bohr's radii of Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se falls in the range of 6–8 nm.68,69 Thus, to exhibit quantum confinement, the particle size of these materials should be in the range 12–16 nm. Since in the present case, the average crystallite size of both Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se nanoparticles are quite larger than this value, the presence of quantum confinement is ruled out and the blue shift in band gap values compared to bulk is attributed to either lattice distortion or surface lattice defects.

Photoresponse measurements of the Si/Cu1.8Se and Si/Ag2Se based liquid junction photoelectrochemical cell
The photo-response of the as-prepared Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se nanostructures were evaluated by fabricating prototype photo-electro-chemical cells with a three electrode system. The working electrode was fabricated by spin coating a toluene suspension of Cu1.8Se or Ag2Se nanostructures over a 1 × 1 cm2 Si substrate followed by evaporation of the solvent to give a thin film of the materials. In the present scenario, since both the silver complexes 2 and 3 yield the Ag2Se material with not much difference in morphology and band gap, the one obtained from 2 was selected as a representative material and photoresponse of the same was investigated.
The photoresponsivity and photo-stability are two important criteria to select an absorber material for photovoltaic and photodetector applications. In the present PEC study, the electrode made from Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se shows nonlinear (non-Ohmic) I–V characteristics with a good increase in current under illumination relative to dark current due to the photo-generated carriers (Fig. 9a and b). The photoresponse of both the nanostructures as a function of time was measured under a white light intensity of 200 μW cm−2 with a bias voltage of −1.5 V. Under illumination, the current is increased and number of cycles is repeated to check the photostability. In the case of Cu1.8Se after few cycles increase in current is observed while in the case of Ag2Se stability continue several cycles (Fig. 9c and d). The middle (8th) cycle has been chosen to calculate the rise time (the time required for the current to increase from 10% to 90% of the peak value) and fall time in both cases. The rise times for both Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se are found to be same as 13 s while the fall time is 17 s and 10 s, respectively (Fig. 9e and f). The difference in rise times and fall times may be due to the involvement of trap states or defects in the switching process. The average photocurrent (Ipc = Ilight − Idark) observed for Cu1.8Se is 98 μA, whereas the same for Ag2Se is 42 μA. The photoresponsivity (R) or photocurrent generation efficiency is the ratio of generated photocurrent and incident optical power (R = Ipc/PS) which is expressed as the photocurrent (Ipc) generated by the light power density (P = 200 μW cm−2) on the effective area of a photodetector (S = 0.785 cm2 in the present case). In this study, the photoresponsivity was calculated to be 624 mA W−1 for Cu1.8Se and 266 mA W−1 for Ag2Se.

The findings of the PEC studies can be compared with the reported studies. Kou et al. have achieved enhanced photoelectric properties for Cu2−xSe by applying a voltage of 10 V which finally resulted in 4.2 times increase in photocurrent compared to the dark condition.70 Qu et al. reported potential application of Ag2Se nanocrystals for photodetection. A photoresponse of ∼40 nA was shown when near-IR laser of 25 mW power was illuminated under repeated cycles of on–off experiments.71 The nice photoresponsivity of these coinage metal selenides can be realized from their really high stability and absorption coefficient of ∼108 m−1.72 A comparison of the findings of the current study with some previous studies have been given in Table 5. Additionally, according to a report by Liu and co-workers, Cu1.8Se being sub-stoichiometric analogue of Cu2Se, it consists of multivalent Cu atoms. These copper vacancies within the crystal lattice also enhance their performance in solar cells, gas sensors and photo-detectors.73 In the current study, the above advantage of Cu1.8Se, coupled with uniform morphology and narrow size distributions, leads to better electron transport and hence result in higher photoresponsivity.

Conclusion
Air and moisture stable copper and silver pyridyl selenolate complexes have been synthesized and characterized and their molecular structures have been determined from scXRD. The rationale behind the observed structural diversity in these complexes is assigned to metal–metal bond endorsed energetics as inferred from computational studies. The utility of the complexes as efficient single source molecular precursors for the preparation of cubic berzelianite (Cu1.8Se) and orthorhombic naumannite (Ag2Se) nanocrystals at relatively lower temperature was demonstrated. The preformed Cu4Se4 and Ag6Se6 core in the precursors having close resemblance with the arrangement of the constituent atoms of Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se materials, respectively, dictates the low temperature synthetic pathway. The SEM and TEM micrographs of the materials show that Cu1.8Se has a polygonal morphology while Ag2Se exhibits a spherical shape. The band gap value of ∼2.6 eV for Cu1.8Se and ∼1.3 eV for Ag2Se indicates that these nanocrystals can potentially be used as an efficient absorber material in solar cells. The as-synthesized materials exhibit high photoresponsivity and photo-stability under alternating light and dark conditions. The technique used to obtain Cu1.8Se and Ag2Se is simple and cost-effective, and has great potential for scale up with exquisite control over the elemental stoichiometry in the final products.
