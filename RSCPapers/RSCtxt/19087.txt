, Accepted 26th June 2023First published on 28th June 2023AbstractHalogenation of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) is a general and effective strategy to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Although end-group halogenation has achieved great success, central-unit halogenation has not been systematically studied due to the lack of substitution points in traditional Y-series acceptors. Herein, based on recently developed quinoxaline (Qx)-series acceptors, a series of NFAs, Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl, were developed by changing the substitution positions of fluorine atoms on the central unit and the type of terminal halogen atoms. These isomeric fluorinated central units and different end groups result in altered local dipole moments, thus affecting molecular stacking modes and photoelectronic properties of NFAs. Qx-p-4Cl with the para-fluorinated central unit and chlorinated end groups exhibits red-shifted absorption, decreased energy loss, ordered molecular packing, and a favorable blend morphology, which are conducive to charge generation and transport. As a result, OSCs based on PM6:Qx-p-4Cl exhibit a high PCE of 18.06%, which could be further improved to 18.78% by interface optimization. This work underlines the importance of selective halogenation of central units and end groups in manipulating molecular packing and boosting the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

Broader context
With the emergence of high-performing photovoltaic materials and the progress of device engineering, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have increased and now exceed 19%. Halogenation of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has been regarded as an effective and essential strategy for improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. However, the effect of central-unit halogenation on molecular packing behaviors and photoelectronic properties lacks systematic study. Herein, we investigate the influence of halogenation of both central units and end groups on physicochemical properties, molecular packing behaviors, charge generation/transport dynamics, and the resulting device performance, by studying the relationship between the local dipole moments and molecular packing modes. Consequently, Qx-p-4Cl with both the para-fluorinated central unit and chlorinated end groups exhibited a more ordered molecular packing and favorable morphology when blended with PM6, exhibiting a remarkable PCE of 18.78% for binary OSCs.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been regarded as one of the most promising next-generation photovoltaic technologies owing to their solution processability, light weight, semi-transparency, and flexibility.2–8 Recently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction OSCs have exceeded 19%,9–13 by virtue of the emergence of high-performing photovoltaic materials as well as the progress of device engineering. Among them, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) represented by Y-series materials exhibited high tunability in chemical structures, optical properties, energy levels, and intermolecular stacking behaviors,14–20 which play crucial roles in boosting the device performance. Despite the massive efforts made in chemical modifications of NFAs, how to develop rational structural design to manipulate the molecular packing precisely and balance the trade-off between open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF) still remains a great challenge.
Generally, Y-series NFAs are composed of an electron-rich “donor–acceptor–donor (DA′D)′′ central core, electron-deficient terminal units, and stretched side chains.16 Numerous strategies, including central subunit replacement (D or A′),21–25 end-group modification,26–29 and side-chain engineering,17–19,30 were developed to optimize the properties of NFAs. Among these design strategies, halogenation (e.g., fluorination and chlorination) on NFAs has been proven to be an effective approach for improving their photovoltaic performance,24,31,32 which contributes to (i) tuning the physicochemical properties (e.g., energy levels and absorption spectra);33,34 (ii) decreasing energy loss;35,36 and (iii) modulating molecular packing behaviors and crystallization and thus optimizing film morphology.26,31 However, the halogenation of Y-series NFAs was extensively directed at end groups mainly due to the lack of reactive sites on the benzothiadiazole central unit. Considering the indispensable role of central units besides end groups in forming distinctive intermolecular packing modes,37,38 more studies have been focused on the construction of novel heteroaromatic central units, such as the quinoxaline (Qx)-based fused core,24,25,39 which provide additional modification sites. Therefore, to eliminate the trade-off mentioned above, it is necessary to unravel the effect of halogenation of both central units and end groups on physicochemical properties, molecular packing behaviors, film morphology, charge generation/transport dynamics and even the resulting device performance.
In this contribution, we designed and synthesized a set of A–DA′D–A-type NFAs (Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl, see Fig. 1a) with three isomeric (ortho-, meta-, and para-) fluorinated central units and two different halogenated end groups, to systematically study the influence of halogenation on molecular stacking and thus further improve the performance of OSCs. Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that the substitution positions of central fluorine atoms could significantly alter the physicochemical properties, especially the local dipole moments, leading to distinct molecular packing modes, thereby affecting the related device performance, where para-fluorinated NFAs show superior charge generation/transport. In addition, end-group chlorination further broadens the absorption spectra and optimizes molecular aggregation, leading to increased JSC and reduced energy loss, which help in minimizing the trade-off between JSC and VOC. Consequently, when blended with donor PM6, Qx-p-4Cl with both a para-fluorinated central unit and chlorinated end groups achieves a champion PCE of 18.06%, with a VOC of 0.879 V, a JSC of 25.63 mA cm−2, and an FF of 80.17%, which could be ascribed to the ordered molecular packing and favorable film morphology and thus efficient charge transport. Impressively, the maximum PCE of PM6:Qx-p-4Cl-based devices has been further improved to 18.78% by replacing the PEDOT:PSS layer with the self-assembled monolayer 2PACz.40 Our work reveals the essential role of simultaneous halogenations of central units and end groups in regulating molecular packing behaviors and paves a promising way toward achieving high-performance OSCs.

Results and discussion
The detailed synthetic routes and procedures of Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl are described in Scheme S1 (ESI†). All four NFAs exhibit good solubility in common processing solvents, including chloroform, toluene, and chlorobenzene, which is beneficial for device fabrication. The UV-vis absorption spectra of these four NFAs in dilute chloroform solution and film state (Fig. 1b and c) were recorded to investigate the molecular optical properties and the corresponding data are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). In the solution state, Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, and Qx-p-4F possess similar absorption profiles with the maximum absorption peaks at 741, 737, and 739 nm, respectively, while Qx-p-4Cl shows clearly red-shifted absorption (754 nm), which may be associated with a stronger conjugation effect caused by larger atomic orbitals of chlorine atoms.41 From solution to the film state, significant red-shifted absorption (>50 nm) is observed for all four NFAs, suggesting strong intermolecular π–π interactions in these films. Moreover, the optical band gaps (Egopt) were determined to be 1.44, 1.45, 1.47, and 1.41 eV for Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl, respectively. The chlorinated Qx-p-4Cl exhibits a much broader absorption spectrum, which may contribute to a higher current density in the resulting photovoltaic devices. These results demonstrate that the halogenation of central units and end-groups significantly impacts the optical properties of NFAs.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the four NFAs (Fig. S1, ESI†). Based on the oxidation and reduction onsets, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl were calculated to be –5.73/–3.92, –5.69/–3.82, –5.76/–3.91, and –5.65/–3.96, respectively. The energy level diagrams of PM6 and the four NFAs are displayed in Fig. 1d. Compared with para- and ortho-substituted isomers, the meta-substituted Qx-m-4F displays obviously elevated energy levels, suggesting that fluorination of the central unit on different positions will influence their electrochemical properties. Besides, Qx-p-4Cl exhibits an upshifted HOMO energy level and a downshifted LUMO energy level in comparison with its fluorinated counterpart, which is consistent with its red-shifted absorption and a reduced band gap.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to understand the molecular structure properties of these NFAs. For simplicity of the calculations, all the alkyl chains of the four NFAs were substituted with methyl groups. From the optimized geometries (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†), the dihedral angles between the fluorinated phenyl ring and the Qx core are 48.42°, 40.71°, 39.79°, and 40.07° for Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl, respectively. The smaller dihedral angles for meta- and para-substituted acceptors suggested enhanced molecular planarity, and thereby a potentially stronger molecular interaction. To further understand the effects of central fluorination positions and end-group chlorination on the molecular packing patterns of these NFAs, the local dipole moments of central units and end groups were also investigated (Fig. 2a). The local dipole moment of the molecule is closely related to the polarity of the molecular fragment. For both Qx-o-4F and Qx-m-4F, the vector of the local dipole moment of the central donor unit is along the direction from the Qx group to the fluorinated phenyl ring, implying that the electron-withdrawing 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) terminal group is more likely to interact with the fluorinated phenyl rings. However, in Qx-m-4F, the local dipole moment is very small, indicating that the interaction between the IC terminal group and the fluorinated phenyl rings is negligible. Therefore, the IC group prefers to interact with the electron-donating thienothiophene (TT) unit. Interestingly, the opposite directional local dipole moment is observed in Qx-p-4F and Qx-p-4Cl, suggesting that the IC terminal group is more likely to interact with the central Qx moiety (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). Furthermore, both the central unit and the IC terminal group of the chlorinated Qx-p-4Cl have a larger dipole moment, which may lead to a stronger end-group/central-unit (E/C) interaction. These results show that different fluorination positions could change the strength and direction of local dipole moments for central units, thus affecting the E/C interaction and then regulating the intermolecular packing modes in the solid phase.

For the sake of clarity, the dipole moment vectors in red are magnified six times, and the dipole moment vectors in green are reduced by half. The central core and end group were marked with blue and red areas, respectively. (b and c) Single-crystal packing diagrams, intermolecular dimeric packing, and stacking distances of (b) Qx-o-4F and (c) Qx-m-4F (the alkyl chains have been omitted for clarity). 
To understand the influence of the local dipole moment on the intermolecular packing behaviors, single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted. The detailed crystal parameters are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). As illustrated in Fig. 2b and c, Qx-o-4F exhibits a honeycomb pattern of molecular packing. Along the molecular packing direction (a-axis), there are four dimers with different molecular overlaps. The largest overlap (dimer 1) comes from the strong π–π interactions between the terminal IC group and the electron-donating TT unit. Due to the large local dipole moment from the Qx group to the fluorinated phenyl ring, the molecular stackings between the IC group and the fluorinated phenyl rings also appear (dimers 2 and 3). However, limited by the large steric hindrance of the non-planar phenyl ring, the π–π interactions are relatively weak. Furthermore, there is a molecular packing between the IC groups (dimer 4), where the overlap between the adjacent molecules is very small. Consequently, Qx-o-4F cannot form a well-connected framework along the stacking direction (Fig. S6, ESI†), which is unfavorable for effective charge transport. In contrast, in Qx-m-4F, along the c-axis direction, it exhibits a very good one-dimensional (1D) arrangement with a large overlap between the IC group and the TT unit. The strong π–π interaction favors better charge transport along the molecular packing direction. These results are in good agreement with the calculations of the local dipole moments. In addition, some attempts have been made to grow single crystals of Qx-p-4F and Qx-p-4Cl by the solvent diffusion method. Regrettably, the grown crystals are difficult to characterize due to their low crystal quality. Nevertheless, from the above results, we suggest that the IC terminal groups in Qx-p-4F and Qx-p-4Cl prefer to stack with the planar Qx core rather than the sterically hindered phenyl ring, forming a better charge transport network, thus facilitating more efficient charge transport and affording higher JSC and FF.
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of these analogous NFAs, OSCs were fabricated with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:NFAs/PNDIT-F3N/Ag (Fig. 3a). The device optimization conditions and results are shown in Table S3–S6 (ESI†). The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of champion OSCs are depicted in Fig. 3b, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Qx-o-4F yields the highest VOC (0.928 V) in devices, but the lowest JSC of 23.64 mA cm−2 and FF of 75.46% lead to an inferior PCE of 16.55%. As shown in Fig. 3d, such an imbalance also exists in Qx-m-4F-based devices, where a higher JSC of 24.55 mA cm−2 and a slightly improved FF of 76.89% are realized, but a decreased VOC of 0.898 V is delivered, resulting in a moderate PCE of 16.95%. Due to a decent JSC of 24.89 mA cm−2 and an excellent FF of 79.46%, despite the lowest VOC (0.877 V), Qx-p-4F-based devices deliver a superior PCE of 17.34%. These results suggest that the fluorination of the central unit on different positions could dramatically affect the optoelectronic properties of NFAs, where para-fluorinated acceptors show the best device performance with increased JSC and FF due to potentially better molecular packing. When substituting the fluorine atoms on the end group with chlorine atoms, Qx-p-4Cl-based devices maintain the advantage of decent FF (80.17%), achieve a VOC (0.879 V) comparable to its fluorinated counterpart despite the much lower Eg, and further improve JSC (25.63 mA cm−2) owing to the red-shifted absorption spectrum, leading to a champion PCE of 18.06%. In addition, the self-assembled monolayer 2PACz was used as the hole transport layer (HTL) to enhance light utilization of the optimal system.40 Ultimately, the PCE could be further improved to 18.78%, which can compete with the state-of-the-art performance of binary OSCs.

Fig. 3c displays the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized devices, which coincide with the absorption spectra of the corresponding blend films (Fig. S7, ESI†). Both devices based on Qx-p-4F and Qx-p-4Cl show high EQE responses with a maximum value of 88% at 560 nm, while the Qx-p-4Cl-based device shows a broader photocurrent response than the Qx-p-4F-based device, leading to increased JSC. Importantly, it can be observed that the EQE response of 2PACz-based devices is enhanced in the range of 500–840 nm, which could be attributed to their higher optical transmittance (Fig. S8, ESI†). Furthermore, the integrated current densities from the EQE curves are in good agreement with those measured from the J–V tests (within the 5% error range). To further confirm the effect of central-unit fluorination on the device performance, two NFAs (Qx-m-4Cl and Qx-o-4Cl) with ortho- or meta-fluorinated central units and chlorinated end groups were also synthesized. Significantly, the resulting device showed the same trend in photovoltaic parameters, with the PCE value increasing from 16.79% for Qx-o-4Cl-based devices to 17.26% V for Qx-m-4Cl-based devices (Fig. S9 and Table S7, ESI†).
The dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on effective voltage (Veff) was investigated to understand the exciton dissociation and charge generation processes of these OSCs, as shown in Fig. 3e. When Veff > 2 V, it is assumed that all the excitons are dissociated, and the resulting free charges are collected, obtaining the saturated current density (Jsat).42 Under short-current conditions, the exciton dissociation efficiencies (ηdiss) of the devices can be estimated using the Jph/Jsat values, which were extracted to be 97.8%, 97.6, 98.1%, and 98.6% for Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl-based devices, respectively. The highest value of Qx-p-4Cl-based device indicates the most efficient charge generation therein, which partially accounts for its higher JSC.
Then the J–V curves under various light intensities (Plight) were measured to study the charge recombination behaviors of these four devices. The relationship between JSC and Plight follows the function of JSC ∝ (Plight)α, where the α value refers to the degree of bimolecular recombination in the devices.43 As depicted in Fig. S10 (ESI†), all the devices exhibit an α value of around 0.99, suggesting negligible bimolecular recombination in the four devices. Besides, the ideal factor (n) fitted from the plots of VOC versus ln(Plight) can reflect the extent of trap-assisted charge recombination (Fig. 3f).43 The n values were calculated to be 1.03, 1.08, 1.08, and 1.05 for Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl-based devices, respectively, demonstrating the slightly reduced trap-assisted recombination in Qx-p-4Cl-based devices.
Furthermore, the transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were studied to probe the charge carrier dynamics. As shown in Fig. 3g, Qx-p-4Cl-based device possesses the shortest charge sweep-out time of 17.84 ns (30.43, 27.58, and 24.32 ns for Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, and Qx-p-4F-based devices, respectively), indicating its highest charge extraction ability. Meanwhile, the carrier lifetimes obtained from the TPV tests are 24.57, 27.51, 55.86, and 59.05 μs for Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl-based devices, respectively (Fig. 3h). The prolonged carrier lifetime for the Qx-p-4Cl-based device suggests the suppressed recombination in the corresponding devices. The more efficient charge extraction and weaker recombination mentioned above support the higher JSC and FF of the Qx-p-4Cl-based device.
To evaluate the charge transport properties of the neat acceptor films and their corresponding blend films, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was used to measure the carrier mobilities (Fig. S11 and Table S8, ESI†). The electron mobilities of neat acceptor films are increased from 2.32 × 10−4 to 2.65 × 10−4 to 3.09 × 10−4 and to 4.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl, respectively. A similar trend can be observed in the blend films (Fig. 3i). The calculated hole (μh)/electron (μe) mobilities are 5.72/2.66, 5.98/2.91, 6.12/3.30, and 6.93/5.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with the μh/μe ratios of 2.15, 2.05, 1.85, and 1.38 for Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl-based blends, respectively. The Qx-p-4Cl-based films exhibit the highest and most balanced charge transport mobilities, which are also in good agreement with the improved JSC and FF of the related devices.
To investigate the molecular packing behaviors of these NFAs in the film state, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization was performed. The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns of pristine NFA films and the corresponding 1D profiles are presented in Fig. 4a and b. All the pristine acceptor films exhibit a dominant face-on orientation but possess distinct packing modes. Specifically, the Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl pristine films show π–π stacking (010) peaks at 1.71, 1.75, 1.67, and 1.71 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, corresponding to the π–π stacking distances (dπ) of 3.67, 3.59, 3.76, and 3.67 Å, respectively. The diverse dπ for fluorinated acceptors could be associated with their distinct intermolecular packing modes caused by different local dipole forces. Then the crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) of π–π stacking (010) peaks were calculated to be 16.49, 32.50, 17.78, and 18.85 Å for Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl, respectively. The increased CCLs of Qx-p-4F and Qx-m-4F relative to that of Qx-o-4F suggest stronger crystallinity in relevant films, which could be partly attributed to their better molecular planarity as shown by DFT calculations. Meanwhile, Qx-p-4Cl shows larger CCL than Qx-p-4F, indicating that chlorination of the end group could result in more ordered molecular packing. By comparing the crystal patterns extracted from single crystal and GIWAXS data, the diverse stacking patterns of the Qx-m-4F pristine film were understood (Fig. S12, ESI†). Besides the π–π stacking peak (010) in the OOP direction, Qx-m-4F pristine film shows two additional scattering peaks, including a (110) stacking peak at 0.52 Å−1 and another stacking peak at 0.72 Å−1. The latter is not found in the single crystal, indicating the packing difference in spin-coated thin films and single crystals. In contrast, the Qx-p-4F pristine film exhibits a sharp scattering peak at 0.66 Å−1, while Qx-o-4F and Qx-p-4Cl pristine films exhibit no other peaks in the OOP direction. Moreover, both Qx-p-4F and Qx-m-4F pristine films display two lamellar peaks at 0.25–0.50 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction (0.35/0.44 Å−1 for Qx-p-4F, 0.27/0.52 Å−1 for Qx-m-4F), while the Qx-o-4F pristine film shows only one lamellar peak at 0.39 Å−1, demonstrating the stronger crystallinity of Qx-p-4F and Qx-m-4F. The above observations imply that different fluorination positions of the central unit have a great influence on the crystallization properties of NFAs.

(b) the corresponding 1D line-cuts along the in-plane (dashed lines) and out-of-plane (solid lines) directions. (c) AFM height images of PM6:Qx-o-4F, PM6:Qx-m-4F, PM6:Qx-p-4F, and PM6:Qx-p-4Cl blend films. 
To further explore why the central fluorination positions can affect the FF values, the 2D GIWAXS patterns of pristine PM6 and blend films were also acquired (Fig. 4a and Fig. S13a, ESI†). The corresponding 1D profiles are presented in Fig. 4b and Fig. S13b (ESI†). Interestingly, after adding the donor PM6, the blend films exhibit quite different stacking features from pristine films. The detailed GIWAXS parameters are summarized in Table S9–S11 (ESI†). Apart from the similar (010) peak at q ≈ 1.70 Å−1, the scattering peaks at low q region in the OOP direction vanish in PM6:Qx-p-4F blend film, whereas a small peak at 0.71 Å−1 remains in PM6:Qx-m-4F blend film, and two new scattering peaks at 0.50 Å−1 and 0.70 Å−1 emerge in PM6:Qx-m-4F blend film. In contrast, Qx-p-4Cl film presents similar packing features before and after blending, which implies a better ability to preserve molecular stacking. Moreover, the CCLs for the (010) π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction are changed to 21.34, 20.87, 18.30, and 22.18 for Qx-o-4F, Qx-m-4F, Qx-p-4F, and Qx-p-4Cl-based blend films, respectively, suggesting that the differences in crystalline properties of four acceptors are diminished in the blend films, which could be related to the self-aggregation effect of the donor PM6. Although the PM6:Qx-o-4F blend film shows higher CCL than the Qx-p-4F-based blend films, the resulting device performance is inferior, which may be ascribed to the unfavorable stacking peaks at 0.50–0.70 Å−1 in the OOP direction, and similarly for the PM6:Qx-m-4F blend film. Importantly, the Qx-p-4Cl-based blend film exhibits the largest CCL, demonstrating the most ordered intermolecular stacking and the highest crystallinity in films, facilitating charge transport and thus obtaining high JSC and FF.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were also carried out to investigate the surface and bulk morphology of blend films. As shown in AFM images, a fibrillar network morphology can be seen in all blend films (Fig. 4c), which is conducive to charge transport.44 The PM6:Qx-p-4Cl blend film shows the smoothest morphology with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.27 nm (1.78 nm for the PM6:Qx-o-4F blend film, 2.68 nm for the PM6:Qx-m-4F blend film, and RMS = 2.39 nm for the PM6:Qx-p-4F blend film), which is favorable for charge extraction. In addition, a similar trend is observed in the TEM images (Fig. S14, ESI†), where the Qx-p-4Cl-based blend film exhibits suitable phase separation with smaller alternating dark and light regions, providing more donor–acceptor interfaces for efficient charge dissociation. The variation in the morphology could be attributed to the distinct aggregation of NFAs (Fig. S13c, ESI†). Qx-p-4F- and Qx-m-4F-based blend films exhibit much coarser surface and larger phase separation, which match well with the strong crystallinity of pristine films demonstrated by GIWAXS characterization.
Surprisingly, despite the similar energy levels of Qx-p-4F and Qx-o-4F, the resulting devices yield significantly different VOC (0.877 vs. 0.928 V), which probably means that a greatly reduced energy loss (Eloss) is achieved in Qx-o-4F-based devices. Therefore, detailed energy loss analyses were conducted to investigate the impact of the central unit and end group modification on Eloss of OSCs. Based on the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit, the Eloss can be divided into three parts: ΔE1, ΔE2, and ΔE3, where ΔE1 is the inevitable radiative energy loss above the band gap, ΔE2 represents the radiative recombination loss below the band gap, and ΔE3 is the non-radiative recombination loss.45 The details of the calculation method are described in ESI† and the corresponding results are summarized in Fig. S15a,b and Table S12 (ESI†). For the four types of OSCs, the Eloss is gradually reduced from 0.560 eV for Qx-p-4F-based device to 0.549 eV for Qx-m-4F-based device, to 0.535 eV for Qx-p-4Cl-based device, and to 0.522 eV for Qx-o-4F-based device. Given the almost identical radiative loss, the differences in energy losses mainly originate from the changes in non-radiative loss, which can be calculated by measuring the electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of the relevant OSCs. As shown in Fig. S15c (ESI†), Qx-o-4F-based device exhibits the highest EQEEL of 4.08 × 10−4 compared to its isomers with para- and meta-substitution (1.44 × 10−4 for Qx-m-4F-based device, 7.41 × 10−5 for Qx-p-4F-based device), corresponding to the lowest ΔE3 of 0.202 eV, which may be related to the suppressed aggregation induced by larger steric hindrance. Additionally, the Qx-p-4Cl-based device shows enhanced EQEEL (1.52 × 10−4) than its fluorinated counterpart Qx-p-4F, leading to a reduced ΔE3 value of 0.225 eV (0.246 eV for Qx-p-4F-based device), which is the main reason for their comparable VOC despite the narrower Eg of Qx-p-4Cl.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of Qx-based NFAs have been rationally designed and synthesized by adopting central-unit fluorination and end-group chlorination strategies, to investigate the impact of different substitution positions and peripheral halogen atoms on the physicochemical properties, molecular packing behaviors, and even the device performance of OSCs. Compared with the ortho- and meta-substituted acceptors, the para-substituted acceptors show favorable molecular stacking due to enhanced local dipole moment force. Moreover, the acceptor with chlorinated end groups displays a narrower band gap and lower energy loss than its fluorinated counterpart, contributing to balancing the trade-off between VOC and JSC. Among them, Qx-p-4Cl with both a para-fluorinated central unit and chlorinated end groups exhibits more ordered molecular packing and a favorable morphology when blended with PM6, which promote charge transport and collection. As a result, Qx-p-4Cl-based devices exhibit a PCE of 18.06% with a VOC of 0.879 V, a JSC of 25.63 mA cm−2, and an FF of 80.17%, which could be further improved to 18.78% by interface engineering. This work highlights the synergetic effect of central and end-unit halogenation and provides insight into the design of novel NFAs for high-performance OSCs.

Broader context
With the emergence of high-performing photovoltaic materials and the progress of device engineering, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have increased and now exceed 19%. Halogenation of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has been regarded as an effective and essential strategy for improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. However, the effect of central-unit halogenation on molecular packing behaviors and photoelectronic properties lacks systematic study. Herein, we investigate the influence of halogenation of both central units and end groups on physicochemical properties, molecular packing behaviors, charge generation/transport dynamics, and the resulting device performance, by studying the relationship between the local dipole moments and molecular packing modes. Consequently, Qx-p-4Cl with both the para-fluorinated central unit and chlorinated end groups exhibited a more ordered molecular packing and favorable morphology when blended with PM6, exhibiting a remarkable PCE of 18.78% for binary OSCs.
