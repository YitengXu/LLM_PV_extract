    , Accepted 9th April 2018First published on 11th April 2018AbstractPollution triggered by highly toxic heavy metal ions has become a worldwide issue of concern, and has aroused increasing research interest, but it is still a challenge to carry out its trace detection in the organic phase using inorganic fluorescent colloidal nanocrystals (NCs). Herein, we report fully inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), which were synthesized via a hot-injection method, as a fluorescent probe for the selective detection of copper ions in hexane. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of CsPbBr3 PQDs is significantly quenched within several seconds after the addition of Cu2+ due to effective electron transfer from the PQDs to the added Cu2+, which is experimentally verified via analyzing absorption spectra and PL decay lifetime. The sensor, in turn-off mode, has a detection range from 0 to 100 nM with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.1 nM, indicating great potential for practical applications. This study paves the way for PQD-based fluorescent probes for heavy metal detection in the organic phase.
1. Introduction
Contamination caused by heavy metal ions poses a severe serious threat to the environment and even human health due to its high toxicity, carcinogenic effects, and ability to accumulate in ecological systems and human bodies.1–3 In particular, Cu2+ plays essential roles in various biological processes, such as being a catalyst for heme synthesis and iron absorption, but excess Cu2+ can exert many adverse effects on humans, such as gastrointestinal disturbance, liver or kidney damage, and neurodegenerative disease.4–6 Therefore, the quantitative determination of Cu2+ in the environment and drinking water is still of great significance.7 Traditional methods for the accurate determination of copper concentration in the environment and biological samples have been limited to the laboratory sphere because of tedious pre-treatment, time-consuming processes, and high cost. Currently reported fluorescent probes based on dyes or QDs have been widely developed for the trace detection of metal ions due to the advantages of excellent specificity and high sensitivity over traditional methods,7,8 but they are aimed at metal ions in aqueous solution and are not suitable for the trace detection of metal ions in the organic phase.
In the past number of years, a new type of semiconductors, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (APbX3, where A is an organic ammonium cation, and X is a halide anion or mixture), has shown highly promising potential for light-absorbing and light-emitting direct-bandgap semiconductors. In term of being an absorber layer, they have already exhibited outstanding performance when applied to solar cells as light harvesters, with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 20%,9,10 and to highly sensitive solution-cast photodetectors in the ultraviolet-visible spectrum region.11 What's more, owing to their bright PL, the application of organometallic halide perovskites has extended to use in a new class of light emitting materials in light-emitting diodes (LEDs),12 low threshold lasers, etc.13 However, they still suffer from the easy decomposition of the organic part as well as reduced stability against temperature and heat.
In 2015, Protesescu et al. reported the facile synthesis of all-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (CsPbX3), with a quantum yield (QY) reaching 40–90% and a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) ranging from 10–40 nm.14 In comparison with organic–inorganic complex perovskites, they provide flexible tunability for fluorescence emission, which benefits from quantum-size effects and compositional control as well as the reaction temperature. At the same time, the tunability of their emission spectrum can also be achieved via a fast anion-change method.15 Furthermore, profiting from the substitution of the organic part with Cs+, the instability of traditional organic-cation based perovskites could be avoided to a large extent.16 Consequently, CsPbX3 PQDs have shown very great potential in optoelectronic materials. As light-emitting semiconductors, they have exhibited significant advantages in LEDs, with an external quantum efficiency as high as 6.27%17 and low-threshold amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) down at ∼5 μJ cm−2,18 Also, they have been applied to other fields such as memory devices and environment monitoring sensors.19,20 Zhu et al. synthesized CsPbBr3 NCs encapsulated into a monolithic superhydrophobic polystyrene fiber membrane through an electrospinning method as a rhodamine 6G sensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).21 Chen reported the use of CsPbBr3 PQDs as a fluorescent probe for the detection of gaseous HCl with a minimum detectable concentration as low as 5 ppm.22 CsPbBr3 NCs encapsulated into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) fiber membrane through an electrospinning method were applied to the fluorescence detection of trypsin, Cu2+, and pH in aqueous solution after surface functionalization.23 Although these CsPbBr3 NC-based probes can realize the ultrasensitive detection of Cu2+ with satisfactory selectivity, they are used in aqueous solution. There is, however, an increasing need for metal ion detection in the organic phase, such as petrol, edible oils, or lubricating oils.24 To the best of our knowledge, there seems to be few published articles studying all-inorganic PQDs as selective probes for the detection of metal ions in organic media. Inspired by the advantages of QD-based fluorescent probes for metal ions and considering the bright PL in combination with good stability of all-inorganic PQDs in organic media, it is expected that CsPbX3 PQDs could be used as a luminescent probe for the ultrasensitive detection of metal ions in the organic phase.
In this study, all-inorganic CsPbX3 PQDs with bright PL were prepared through a hot-injection method. CsPbBr3 NCs, exhibiting a cubic shape with an average edge length of 15 nm and a high QY of up to 90%, are used as a luminescent probe for the detection of Cu2+ in hexane with ultrasensitivity and good selectivity. The PQD-based probe possesses an ultralow LOD, down to 0.1 nM, and a fast time response of within 10 s, showing exciting potential for future implementation into practical situations.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99%), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.9%), oleic acid (OA, 99%), oleylamine (OAM, 70%), technical grade 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), and sodium oleate were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Water was acquired utilizing a Milli-Q system. Other chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
Synthesis of CsPbBr3 PQDs
All-inorganic CsPbBr3 PQDs were synthesized through a hot-injection method via the following steps. A Cs-oleate solution was prepared by dispersing 100 mg of Cs2CO3 into 4 mL of octadecene (ODE) with 0.6 mL of oleic acid (OA), followed by heating to 120 °C for 1 h under a N2 atmosphere. 10 mL of ODE and 0.376 mmol of PbBr2 were loaded into a 50 mL 3-neck flask, heated to 120 °C under a nitrogen flow for 1 h before raising the temperature to 150 °C. Then, 1 mL of OAM and 1 mL of OA were swiftly injected into the mixture. After the complete solubilization of PbBr2, 0.8 mL of the as-prepared Cs-oleate solution was injected into the flask, which was cooled using an ice-water bath after 5 s. For the purification of CsPbX3 NCs, the crude solution underwent centrifugation; the supernatant was discarded and the precipitation was redispersed into hexane. After three rounds of centrifugation, the CsPbX3 NCs were dispersed in hexane, forming a long-term stable solution.
Preparation of the metal ion solution
Copper oleate was prepared through a replacement reaction. In a typical run, 0.1 mmol of copper sulfate was mixed with 0.5 mL of water in a 10 mL tube, followed by centrifugation for 10 min to obtain a transparent solution. A H2O–ethanol solution (v:v = 1:1) containing 0.25 mmol of sodium oleate was added into the above tube, followed by ultrasonic treatment for 10 min. The above mixture was centrifuged, with the precipitate washed with water and ethanol subsequently followed by drying at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum drier. Then, a stock solution (2 μM) was prepared by dissolving copper oleate into hexane. The other stock solutions of metal oleates were obtained via the same method.
Detection of Cu2+ in the organic phase
The as-prepared CsPbBr3 PQDs (0.4 mg), dispersed in 1 mL of hexane, were mixed with different volumes of copper ions in hexane (0.2 μM), then diluted with hexane to 4 mL. The mixture, loaded into a cuvette, was analyzed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer after shaking for one minute to ensure complete reaction between the QDs and quencher (Cu2+ ions).
Characterization
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), CsPbBr3 PQDs were deposited onto copper grids with a carbon support by slowly evaporating the water at room temperature. TEM images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectra were acquired using a thermal field emission transmission electron microscope (ZEISS LIBRA 200 FEG) and thermal field emission scanning electron microscope (ZEISS MERLIN compact), respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Nicolet IS5 FTIR spectrometer through the KBr pellet method. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and PL spectra were recorded via an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Cary 60, Agilent Technologies) and fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cary Eclipse G9800A), respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (Empyrean, PANalytical). The PL QY of the NCs in hexane was calculated by comparing their integrated emission with that of pure hexane. The fluorescence lifetime studies were conducted using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), with an FLSP980, Edinburgh Instruments. A supercontinuum laser (405 nm) was employed for the lifetime measurements. The PL emission decay was measured at the PL emission maximum for each sample.
3. Results and discussion
Optical properties and characterization of CsPbBr3 PQDs
The CsPbBr3 PQDs were synthesized in the presence of OAM and OA, as the co-solvent and hydrophobic ligand, through a procedure slightly modified from the literature,14 taking advantage of the ionic nature of the chemical bonding in these compounds.12 From Fig. 1a and Table S1 (ESI†), it can be seen that the CsPbBr3 NCs have an apparent excitonic absorption peak at 508.11 nm (2.44 eV), and a sharp emission centered at 518.05 nm (2.39 eV) with a narrow FWFM (∼10 nm) and small Stokes shift (50 meV). Upon varying the excitation wavelength from 370 to 460 nm, there is no change in the emission wavelength and little change in the PL intensity of CsPbBr3 NCs, which is an indication of the independence of the emission wavelength from the excitation energy (Fig. S1, ESI†). The small Stokes shift observed, as well as the independence of the excitation wavelength, implies that exciton recombination is responsible for the PL emission. The remarkable PL of the CsPbBr3 NCs could also be observed from the inset of Fig. 1a, where the NCs emit a bright green color under irradiation from a 365 nm ultraviolet lamp (right), while they are pale yellow under a daylight lamp (left). This is also confirmed by their high QY of up to 90%, comparable or even better than core–shell cadmium-based chalcogenide QDs.25,26

A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 PQDs was obtained, as shown in Fig. 1b, from which it can be seen that the CsPbBr3 PQDs are arranged in an orderly fashion without any aggregation, presenting a cubic shape with a uniform average edge length of ∼15 nm (Fig. S2a, ESI†), as estimated from statistics relating to the particles in the TEM image, which is consistent with previous studies.27 The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in the inset of Fig. 2b reveals the well-resolved lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of about 5.8 Å, which coincides with the (100) plane and demonstrates the highly crystalline nature of the QDs.14,21 The EDS spectrum indicates the existence of Cs, Pb, and Br, with a molar ratio of 0.8:1:3, close to the stoichiometry ratio (Fig. 1c), which is also confirmed using XPS spectra in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is known that CsPbBr3 perovskites crystallize in tetragonal, orthorhombic, and cubic phases of the perovskite lattice.28–31 In our study, the XRD pattern of the CsPbBr3 QDs in Fig. 1d indicates the cubic perovskite phase of CsPbBr3 (PDF#54–0752), with the space group Pm3m, stemming from the combined effects of a high synthesis temperature and contributions from the surface energy, similar to that reported by Chen and co-workers.22 This typical cubic crystal structure is displayed in a diagram in Fig. S2b (ESI†), with a three dimensional framework of corner-connected PbBr6 octahedra inside cubes with Pb centered in the octahedra, Br anions standing at the centroids of the cubes, and Cs+ cations located at the vertexes of the cubes.32,33

An FTIR spectrum was recorded to check the surface modification of the CsPbBr3 PQDs, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The strong broad absorption band at 3450 cm−1, relating to the bending vibration of –OH, originates from a carboxyl group, indicating the presence of carboxyl groups on the surfaces of the NCs.34,35 The transmittance peaks at 2950 cm−1 could be attributed to asymmetric stretching vibrations of –CH3, while the peaks centered at 2920 and 2850 cm−1 stand for the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of C–H, respectively. The CO–O stretch is responsible for the band at 1464 cm−1, A CC stretch results in the absorption peak centered at 1634 cm−1. These are the typical absorption characteristics of PQDs with OA as a ligand, while no absorption peaks from OAM were observed for the reason that during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs, OAM contributes to solubilizing lead bromide (PbBr2) in the octadecene solvent, while OA serves as a hydrophobic ligand, enabling the resulting nanoparticles to disperse in nonpolar solvent.36,37 The characterization above evidences the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs with excellent optical properties, well-defined crystal structures, and outstanding dispersity in a nonpolar solvent, establishing a foundation for highly sensitive fluorescent probes for metal ion detection.
The detection of Cu2+ ions
The easy preparation and outstanding optical properties allow CsPbBr3 NCs to be used as a highly sensitive fluorescent probe for metal ion detection. So, they are used as a Cu2+ sensor in hexane. Typically, different volumes of copper ion stock solution (0.2 μM) were added to test tubes loaded with the as-prepared CsPbBr3 QDs in hexane (0.4 mg mL−1, 1 mL), followed by dilution with hexane to 4 mL. The mixture, loaded into a cuvette, is analyzed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer after shaking for one minute to ensure complete reaction between the QDs and quencher (Cu2+ ions). The reaction between the CsPbBr3 PQDs and Cu2+ ions is so fast that it is completed within ten seconds, as shown in Video S1 (ESI†). Therefore, one minute is a suitable time to shake the mixture for further PL measurements.
The PL dependence of the sensing system on the copper(II) concentration is displayed in Fig. 2a, in which the successively decreasing PL intensity upon an increase in the copper(II) concentration from 0 to 100 nM is observed. On the other hand, in this process no shift is observed in the emission wavelength, hinting that the quenching mode is not caused by a displacement of QD cations by added cations via a cation-exchange process.7,8 The relationship between I/I0 at the peak wavelength and the Cu2+ concentration is well described via the following eqn (1), as plotted in Fig. 2b: I/I0 = A + Ksv[Q](1)Herein, I and I0 are the PL intensity values of the probe in the presence and absence of Cu2+ ions, respectively. A and KSV represent the intercept and sensitivity (slope), respectively, and [Q] is the final Cu2+ concentration in the probe solution. The relationship between the PL intensity and copper(II) concentration can be well expressed via two linear plots with the fitting values displayed in the inset of Fig. 2b. Both possess good R2 values (>0.99), and linear calibration ranges are obtained from 0–30 nM and 30–100 nM, with corresponding regression equations of I1/I0 = 1.0098 + 11.65 × 106[Q] and I2/I0 = 1.23367 + 4.46 × 106[Q]. An ultralow LOD, based on 3σ/KSV1 (σ is the standard deviation of the blank signal, n = 11), down to 0.1 nM, is achieved for the present nanosensor. Table 1 shows a summary of QD-based fluorescent probes for Cu2+, showing the QD, ligand, LOD, and solvent.38–50 From the table, it can be seen that most QD-based probes focus on Cu2+ in aqueous solution. To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports concerning fluorescent QD-based probes for Cu2+ in organic solution. What's more, the LOD in this study is much lower in comparison with those listed in the table.

Quenching mechanism
Several mechanisms have been developed to explain the fluorescence quenching behavior of QDs induced by metal ions, including FRET, cation exchange induced by exotic metal ions (static quenching), and electron transfer.51–54 It has been observed that increasing the concentration of Cu2+ leads to a progressive decrease in the PL intensity of the QDs, clearly demonstrating quenching behavior resulting from added Cu2+. In the presented experiments, no shift is observed in the emission and absorption spectra and there is no appearance of any new absorption band (Fig. 2a and 3a), which confirms the absence of conformational change in the QDs, and that the QDs do not aggregate or get etched in the presence of Cu2+, ruling out a cation exchange mode involving ground-state complex formation between a fluorophore and quencher, which is always accompanied by a wavelength shift.53 In the case of FRET (a kind of dynamic quenching mode), an overlap is needed between the absorption spectra of acceptors and emission spectra of donors,52 but from Fig. 3b, no overlap is witnessed between the absorption spectrum of Cu-oleate and the PL spectrum of the sensing system, which excludes a FRET-induced PL turn-off mode, leaving an electron transfer process as the only possibility.
 Fig. 3  (a) Absorption spectra of CsPbBr3 PQDs with different concentrations of Cu2+ ions; (b) a PL spectrum of CsPbBr3 PQDs and UV-vis spectrum of copper oleate; (c) an EDS spectrum of as-obtained CsPbBr3 aggregate and the corresponding elemental ratios (inset) after centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 5 min, the inset shows the elemental ratios of Cs, Pb, Br and Cu; and (d) the time-resolved PL decay curves of CsPbBr3 PQDs with different concentrations of Cu2+ ions (emission at 520 nm, with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm) and the corresponding average lifetimes (inset). 
For experimental verification of an electron transfer-induced quenching mode, EDS was applied to explore the elemental composition of the sensing system. For the complete removal of unreacted Cu2+, the probe solution in the presence of a fixed concentration of Cu2+ underwent centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 5 min before EDS analysis was conducted. The EDS spectrum in Fig. 3c evidences the existence of Cu along with Cs, Pb, and Br in the sediment, while no Cu signal is seen in the probe without added Cu (Fig. 1c), implying that quenching behavior is somehow due to the added Cu2+ ions. To gain a deeper insight into the turn-off mechanism, time-resolved PL decay curves are recorded using TCSPC. The PL decay curves in Fig. 3d are well fitted using a triexponential kinetic function, with the corresponding parameters shown in Table S2 (ESI†). From Fig. 3d, it can be observed that the average PL lifetime of the sensing system in the absence of copper ions, calculated according to ,55 is 80.84 ns, coinciding with that from previous studies,56 while in the presence of 50 nM and 100 nM Cu2+, this drops to 71.83 ns and 60.92 ns, respectively, while there is little change in the presence of other metal ions (Table S3, ESI†). The reduced PL lifetimes in combination with the existence of Cu2+ clearly indicate that an electron transfer process from the PQDs to Cu2+, resulting in faster exciton decays and shorter fluorescence lifetimes, is responsible for the quenching mechanism, further excluding a cation-exchange quenching mode,52,57 in which the PL lifetime of the NCs is always not affected by added metal ions. Informally, electron transfer behavior (a kind of dynamic quenching mode) allows probe behavior to be fitted to a straight linear plot. However, in the present case, the dependence of the probe on Cu2+ concentration is expressed via two linear functions, reflecting that quenching is accompanied by some sort of steric/charge shielding process when Cu2+ is present at high concentrations (>30 nM), which limits the fluorophore's accessibility to quenchers or binding interactions that involve the association of some fraction of quencher, thereby reducing free quencher concentration.57 Such an electron transfer quenching mode can also be seen in other studies.58,59
Selectivity
To evaluate the practical application potential of the probe, the selectivity of assays was also explored: the PL intensity ratios (I/I0) of the probe are analyzed after the addition of different metal ions at the same concentration (100 nM), including In3+, Ag+, Cd2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Na+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+, into the sensing system, with the results displayed in Fig. 4. It can be seen that only Cu2+ produces effective quenching effects on the probe, while the other cations exert almost no significant quenching behavior. This is attributed to the special d9 electron configuration of Cu2+, making Cu2+ receive an electron more favorably to form a d10 full stable structure when compared with the other cations;60,61 this can be further validated experimentally through analyzing average lifetimes (Table S3, ESI†). As discussed above, in the presence of 100 nM Cu2+, τav drops from 80.84 ns to 60.92 ns, while in the presence of other metal ions, it changes a little, an indication of the occurrence and almost non-existence of electron transfer in the presence of Cu2+ and other metal ions, respectively. Hence, the electron transfer mode and special electron configuration of Cu2+ endow the probe with high selectivity to copper ions. Benefiting from Cu2+ selectivity, the CsPbBr3 PQD-based sensing system is specific to Cu2+, which gives the probe great practical application potential in the organic phase.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we report all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PQDs, prepared via a hot injection method, as a fluorescent probe for Cu2+ detection in the organic phase. The PL intensity of the sensor is significantly quenched by Cu2+ in the range of 0–100 nM, owing to an electron transfer quenching mechanism. The probe has an ultralow LOD of 0.1 nM and high sensitivity in the order of 107 M−1. Although CsPbBr3 PQDs exhibit better stability in comparison with organic–inorganic hybrid PQDs, they are still not sufficiently stable for practical applications. Future work will concentrate on seeking solutions to endow CsPbBr3 PQDs with excellent long-term stability via coating or doping. Even so, this study still paves the way for PQD-based fluorescent probes for heavy metal detection in organic media.
