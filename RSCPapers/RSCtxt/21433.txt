Despite the importance of understanding the surface characteristics of ZnO in DSSC applications, most of the studies relevant to ZnO-based DSSCs are focused on the synthesis of unique nanostructures of ZnO. In this study, we not only introduce a novel disk-shaped ZnO nanostructure, but also provide insight into the distinctive surface properties of ZnO and its influence on DSSC performance. When utilized in DSSCs, the mesoporous ZnO nanodisk yields 60% better power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to commercial ZnO nanoparticles, which is attributed to less surface and bulk trap densities as concluded by an in-depth open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Another aspect that contributes to the higher PCE is the better connectivity of primary particles that join together to form secondary disk-shaped particles. Furthermore, a 40% improvement in the PCE was observed by coating the mesoporous ZnO nanodisk with TiO2, which results from the passivation of the surface defects that aid in suppressing the interfacial charge recombination.
Introduction
Since the introduction of high-efficiency DSSCs,1 many semiconducting materials have been tried as a mesoporous layer in efforts to boost the PCE. Among these materials, TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2 are the most widely studied materials.2–7 ZnO was one of the first materials to be used as an electron transporting wide-bandgap semiconductor in the early DSSCs and has since been explored in various applications, such as light emitting diodes,8 quantum dot solar cells,9–11 and polymer solar cells,12,13 which utilize its excellent electron transporting properties. It was the first material examined to produce conclusive experimental evidence that irreversible electron transfer is possible from organic molecules into the conduction band states of a semiconductor with a wide bandgap.7,14
The anisotropic growth and ease of crystallization of ZnO have fostered the creation of a wide variety of nanostructures, which can be achieved through diverse synthesis approaches.5,7 ZnO has been synthesized in various morphologies (nanowires,15–17 nanorods,18 nanotubes,6 hierarchal aggregates,19–23 and nanosheets24,25) using a wide range of synthetic techniques including the hydrothermal method,15 spray pyrolysis,20 chemical bath deposition, electrodeposition,26 and chemical vapor deposition.27 A common motivation to use ZnO as a mesoporous layer in DSSCs is the higher bulk carrier mobility in ZnO compared to TiO2. Despite some advantages of ZnO over TiO2, the PCE of ZnO-based DSSCs is still lower than that of its TiO2-based counterparts, which primarily stems from the inherent lower chemical stability of ZnO. In addition, despite the high bulk carrier mobility, electron mobility in nanostructured ZnO has been observed to be similar to that in TiO2.7 Therefore, it is essential to form ZnO into a hierarchical nanostructure that can offer a large surface area and good connectivity between primary particles for high electron mobility.
The basic nature of ZnO coupled with the fact that most dyes have an acidic nature due to the presence of carboxylic groups leads to the poor chemical stability of ZnO in the dye solution. This results in the formation of dye aggregates in the form of carboxylates on the surface of ZnO. These dye aggregates hinder visible light absorption and can significantly retard the injection of excited electrons into the conduction band of ZnO.28 During dye adsorption, the surface of ZnO undergoes some degree of dissolution that can reduce the contact between the individual nanoparticles forming the mesoporous network.28–30 Another factor that has been associated with the poor performance of ZnO is the low relative permittivity. The lower relative permittivity of ZnO compared to TiO2 produces stronger electrostatic interactions between the excited electrons and oxidized dye, which can lead to relatively low injection efficiencies in the ZnO-based DSSCs.28
Many theoretical31–33 and experimental34–37 studies have concluded that the transport of electrons through the electrolyte-filled mesoporous network of semiconducting oxides is controlled by the trapping and detrapping mechanisms through surface traps. It has been suggested that electrons move through the network of interconnected particles by random walking, during which they become trapped by the surface traps and are released after a few nanoseconds.32 Under illuminated conditions, electrons on average pass through 106 traps,16,32 resulting in a millisecond-order transit time of electrons being injected into the conduction band and being collected at the electrode.17 The slow nature of electron transport via trap mediation provides sufficient time for some of the excited electrons to recombine with the oxidized species in the electrolyte. Fortunately, due to the even slower nature of the two-electron reduction kinetics of I3−, the collection of electrons at the conducting electrode is the dominant phenomenon. However, many excited electrons are still lost through the back transfer recombination process. Hence, the control of trap densities in ZnO by nanostructuring and surface treatment is very important to improve the electron transport in the mesoporous oxide network and to suppress recombination.
For these reasons, we have synthesized a new nanostructured ZnO through the pyrolysis of a Zn-based metal organic complex. Nanodisk-shaped ZnO (nanodisk-ZnO) was employed as the mesoporous layer in DSSCs, and the results were compared with those of commercially-available ZnO nanoparticles (comm-ZnO). In order to elucidate the surface properties of nanodisk-ZnO, a comprehensive trap density analysis was performed by fitting the mathematical model developed by Bisquert and coworkers38,39 on the electron lifetime calculated from OCVD analysis. Lower bulk and surface trap densities were observed in nanodisk-ZnO compared to comm-ZnO. The surface trap density of nanodisk-ZnO was further reduced by coating the surface of nanodisk-ZnO with TiO2 using a TiCl4 treatment. A TiO2 coating on nanodisk-ZnO also reduced the direct contact between the ZnO surface and dye molecules, which improved the chemical stability of ZnO. The nanodisk-shaped ZnO particles also showed superior electronic conductivity compared to comm-ZnO nanoparticles because of the better connectivity of individual crystallites, which was supported by the in-depth EIS analysis.
Experimental
Synthesis and solar cell fabrication
To synthesize the Zn-based complex, an aqueous solution of zinc acetate (100 mM, 25 ml) was added to a 100 ml flask and heated on a hot plate at 70 °C for 15 min with mild stirring. Then, 30 ml of a 200 mM aqueous solution of 2-methylimidazole was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 150 rpm. After 2 h, the flask was removed from the hot plate and cooled to room temperature. The product was washed three times with methanol and dried in an oven at 70 °C. The as-obtained precipitate was heated to 400 °C at a ramping rate of 3 °C min−1 and held at 400 °C for 50 min to obtain the nanodisk-shaped pure ZnO nanoparticles.
ZnO paste was prepared by a previously published protocol with some modification.40 For this, 0.125 g of ethyl cellulose (30–70 mPa s, 5% in toluene/ethanol 80:20 (25 °C), Sigma-Aldrich #46080) and 0.125 g of ethyl cellulose (5–15 mPa s, 5% in toluene/ethanol 80:20 (25 °C), Sigma-Aldrich #46070) were mixed with 1 ml of ethanol in a small plastic container, which was placed in a conditioning-mixer (Thinky, AR-100) for 5 min to dissolve ethyl cellulose and produce a viscous solution. Next, 0.5 g of ZnO powder and 1.7 ml of α-terpineol were added and mixed for 15 min in the conditioning-mixer. The final paste was obtained by grinding in a mortar grinder (15 min) until a uniform paste of adequate viscosity was obtained.
The ZnO paste was screen-printed onto cleaned fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) glass by a previously reported method in order to obtain a 15 μm-thick film.41,42 The screen-printed ZnO film was heated at 400 °C for 1 h in a box furnace to obtain a mesoporous nanostructure. To perform the TiCl4 treatment, the ZnO film was dipped in a 40 mM TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 70 °C and sequentially rinsed with water and ethanol. After drying at room temperature, the ZnO film was further subjected to heat treatment at 450 °C for 30 min. To adsorb the N719 dye, the mesoporous ZnO was dipped in a 0.5 mM solution of N719 in ethanol for 1 h. To remove the loose dye molecules, ZnO was rinsed with ethanol and dried at room temperature. A sandwich-type cell was assembled with sputtered Pt as the counter electrode and an iodide redox couple (Dyesol, EL-HPE) as the electrolyte. Steel clips were used to hold the cell together.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the Zn-complex and ZnO were collected using an X-ray diffractometer from Rigaku (D/Max-2500/PC). A BELSORP-mini II (BEL Japan) was used to record nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77.4 K. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific area and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method was used on desorption branches to determine the pore size distribution. Scanning electron micrographs were obtained using a field-emission electron microscope from Hitachi (S-4800). High-resolution transmission electron micrographs and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained using a JEOL 2010F electron microscope. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a SDT-Q600 (TA Instrument) at a scan rate of 5 °C min−1 under air flow in a temperature range of 25–500 °C. A UV-vis spectrophotometer (SCINCO S-3100) was used to estimate the amount of dye adsorbed onto the various ZnO films.
The photoluminescence (PL) lifetime was measured using a homebuilt inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, IX-70). The excitation beam (380 nm, 100 μW) was generated using a picosecond pulsed diode laser operating at 80 MHz (PicoQuant, LDH-P-C-375B) with a FWHM of ∼50 ps. This beam was reflected using a dichroic mirror and focused onto the sample using a 63× TIRF oil immersion objective (NA 1.45 Zeiss). The fluorescence from the sample was collected by the same objective, separated from the excitation beam by a band pass filter (Chroma, ET665LP), and directed to a GaAs photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu, H7422-40). The resulting photon streams from the detector were registered using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) board (Timeharp260, PicoQuant, PICO model).
A Keithley 2400 source meter was employed to measure the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves when a solar cell with an active area of 0.188 cm2 was illuminated with a solar simulator (HAL-320, Asahi Spectra). A standard silicon diode (CS-20, Asahi Spectra) was used to calibrate the light intensity of the solar simulator to AM 1.5G conditions. The same solar simulator and source meter were used to record OCVD curves. Matlab was used to perform curve fitting on the OCVD data in order to extract various parameters. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a custom-designed apparatus equipped with a xenon lamp and monochromator from Newport and a source meter. EIS analysis was performed under dark conditions in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz on an electrochemical workstation by Gamry Instruments (REF 600-25049). Curve fitting of the EIS data to an equivalent circuit43,44 was performed using Gamry Echem Analyst.
Results and discussion
Zinc ions coordinate with four nitrogen atoms from four 2-methylimidazolate molecules to form bridges and create a dense, nanodisk-shaped framework, which will hereafter be referred to as a Zn-complex. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1A) of the Zn-complex is similar to the patterns reported for this type of structure.45 The N2 physisorption isotherm analysis (Fig. 1B) of the Zn-complex shows that there is no significant porosity in this organic complex of Zn, indicating the dense nature of the Zn-complex, which is in agreement with previous reports.45 TGA was performed to monitor the decomposition reaction of the Zn-complex in air (Fig. S1, ESI†). The organic part of the Zn-complex starts decomposing at ∼400 °C and is completely decomposed at ∼500 °C. During the decomposition process, the Zn ions present in the Zn-complex react with the oxygen in air to form ZnO.45,46

The open symbols in the isotherms represent the adsorption curves and the solid symbols represent the desorption curves. The inset of (B) provides the pore size distribution of nanodisk-ZnO and comm-ZnO. 
Based on the TGA results, the Zn-complex was heated at 400 °C under air for conversion to ZnO. To avoid any possible collapse of the nanodisk structure due to fast decomposition of the organic part of the Zn-complex, a slow heating rate of 3 °C min−1 was used to reach 400 °C. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1A) indicates that all of the Zn-complex was converted to a pure ZnO phase without any carbon residue. Commercial ZnO nano-powder (comm-ZnO) was purchased from Alfa Aesar to compare its performance with nanodisk-ZnO as the mesoporous layer in DSSCs. The grain sizes, as calculated from the peak broadening of the XRD data, of nanodisk-ZnO and comm-ZnO were ∼32 nm and ∼31 nm, respectively, which indicates that both ZnO powders have similar crystallinity.
As previously mentioned, the as-synthesized Zn-complex has a very dense structure, with a BET surface area of only 12.7 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.024 cm3 g−1 (Fig. 1B). Upon conversion to ZnO, the organic binder decomposes, creating significant porosity, which resulted in doubling of the surface area to 24.75 m2 g−1, and the total pore volume increased to 0.094 cm3 g−1. Comm-ZnO not only has a greater BET surface area (34.35 m2 g−1) than nanodisk-ZnO, but also has a significantly larger pore volume of 0.30 cm3 g−1. The pore volume distribution (inset, Fig. 1B) shows that most of the pore volume of comm-ZnO consists of a pore diameter of ∼100 nm, which contributes to the larger pore volume. However, nanodisk-ZnO has nearly uniform volumetric pore distribution ranging from 10 to 100 nm, which might result in better packing of the mesoporous film and better mechanical stability.
As shown in Fig. 2A and B, the Zn-complex consists of well-formed nanodisk-shaped nanoparticles, and this unique structure was retained after the conversion of the Zn-complex to ZnO by pyrolysis (Fig. 2C and D). The secondary nanodisk-ZnO particles are composed of well-connected primary spherical nanoparticles with a size less than 50 nm. Alternatively, comm-ZnO is composed of random agglomerates of ZnO nanoparticles (Fig. 2E and F). The TEM images (Fig. 3) further confirm the presence of well-formed nanodisk-shaped secondary ZnO particles. These ZnO particles are polycrystalline (inset, Fig. 3C) and consist of ∼40 nm primary nanoparticles, as estimated from the TEM images. The high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 3D provides additional evidence of the presence of a pure ZnO phase, as the lattice spacing (2.81 Å) matches well with the (100) family of ZnO.

Nanodisk-ZnO was employed as the mesoporous oxide layer in DSSCs, and its performance was compared with that of comm-ZnO (Fig. 4A and Table 1). It must be noted that during the process of making the mesoporous film, the nanodisk structure was retained and did not collapse as a result of heat treatment for removal of the organic binder (Fig. S2A and B, ESI†). Nanodisk-ZnO showed 60% better PCE compared to comm-ZnO. While nanodisk-ZnO showed increased open-circuit voltage (VOC) compared to comm-ZnO, the main contributions to the increase in PCE were the increase in short-circuit current density (JSC) and improved fill factor (FF). It should be noted that the dye loading of nanodisk-ZnO (5.8 × 10−6 M cm−2) was slightly less than that of comm-ZnO (6.14 × 10−6 M cm−2); hence, the increase in the photocurrent of nanodisk-ZnO DSSCs was a result of its morphology and unique surface properties, which will be further discussed with the aid of detailed OCVD and EIS analyses.

TiCl4 treatment is known to improve the dye loading capacity of mesoporous oxide films.47 Hence, to overcome the lower dye loading of nanodisk-ZnO, TiCl4 treatment was performed at 70 °C for 30 min on the nanodisk-ZnO films, which improved the contacts between individual ZnO particles (Fig. S2C and D, ESI†) and increased the overall electrode surface area (Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†). These improvements further enhanced the PCE by 40%. The increase in the PCE of nanodisk-ZnO–TiCl4 samples resulted from the improvements in all three key parameters of the J–V curve, specifically JSC, FF, and VOC. The TiO2 coating on ZnO may have reduced the direct contact between the ZnO surface and dye molecules, which can help in reducing the formation of dye aggregates.48 Better relative permittivity of TiO2 could also help in reducing the electrostatic interaction between the excited electrons and oxidized dye molecules, which could eventually improve the injection efficiency as being proved in the IPCE and PL lifetime measurements (Fig. 4B, Fig. S4, and Table S2, ESI†).7,49,50 The above-mentioned features combined with the factors of enhanced dye loading (8.43 × 10−6 M cm−2) and improved connectivity of the individual particles due to the deposition of small TiO2 particulates lead to greater JSC and better FF in the nanodisk-ZnO–TiCl4 DSSC. The TiO2 film on the ZnO surface also helps in passivation of the surface traps and reduction of recombination, which contributed to a significant improvement in the VOC in the nanodisk-ZnO–TiCl4 samples.
Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD)
Bisquert and coworkers developed a model using OCVD data to calculate various physical and electronic properties of DSSCs.38,39 This model can be used to calculate the different trap densities of oxide semiconductors. During OCVD measurements, the excited electrons from the photoanode recombine with oxidized species in the electrolyte solution (Scheme 1). The electronic states that participate in these recombination processes are the conduction band states and trap states. The energy states of the oxidized species in the electrolyte follow a Gaussian distribution (Scheme 1). The recombination of excited electrons with oxidized species is fast if the mismatch between the energy level of electrons and the maxima of the distribution of oxidized species in the electrolyte is relatively narrow. The most suitable candidate for these energy levels would be the surface trap states. Hence, the distribution and density of trap states in ZnO play a major role in controlling the recombination in ZnO-based DSSCs.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the recombination of electrons with the electrolyte through various electronic states during OCVD. The right side shows the Gaussian distribution of the density of states of oxidized species in the electrolyte, with peaks at Eox with a half width of λ, which is called reorganization energy. EC is the conduction band position, EF0 is the equilibrium Fermi level, EFn is the quasi-Fermi level, and Eredox is the redox potential of the electrolyte. The green arrows show the recombination with the electrolyte through conduction band states. The blue arrows show the path of a trapped electron that is detrapped by thermal energy and recombines through conduction band states. The orange arrows show the path of trapped electrons that recombine through surface states after thermal detrapping.38 
The conduction band states, which are also known as extended states, have fast electron transfer properties, and the volumetric concentration of these states can be given as (1)where NC is the effective density of states in the conduction band, EF is the quasi-Fermi level, EC is the conduction band edge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The trap states, which are localized states, can be divided into two parts: the bulk states that lie deep within ZnO and the surface trap states that lie near or on the surface. The distribution of these trap states can be given as (2) (3)where gb(E) and gs(E) are the distributions of bulk and surface traps in ZnO, respectively. T0 and T1 are the characteristic parameters for the exponential distributions of bulk and surface traps, respectively. Chemical capacitance (Cμ) can be used to measure the variations in the Fermi level due to the changes in electron density. The chemical capacitances pertaining to different types of electronic states are given as follows.
For conduction band states: (4) For bulk trap states: (5) For surface trap states: (6)The chemical capacitances for the bulk and surface traps use the Fermi–Dirac distribution with zero temperature approximation. Another factor that needs to be considered is the probability of electron transition (eiox(E), where i is the surface or bulk traps) from bulk or surface traps to the fluctuating energy levels in the electrolyte. (7)where kit is the rate constant, cox denotes the concentration of oxidized species in the electrolyte, Eox is the most likely position of the oxidized species, and λ is the reorganization energy. Unlike the distributed nature of the trap states, the electron transfer from the conduction band states produces a constant lifetime, which is defined as (8)Knowing all these parameters, the electron lifetime from OCVD can be given as (9) Fitting this equation to the electron lifetime calculated from the OCVD measurements of the ZnO-based DSSCs can provide insight into the electronic properties of the solar cells (Fig. 5). In particular, the parameters that are valuable in creating correlations between the varying performance of comm-ZnO and nanodisk-ZnO based DSSCs are the surface and bulk trap densities in each ZnO. As summarized in Table 2, nanodisk-ZnO has fewer bulk traps compared to comm-ZnO. Nanodisk-ZnO also possesses fewer surface traps with a relatively narrow distribution. The TiCl4 treatment, which deposits a thin TiO2 film onto the ZnO particles, helped improve the performance of nanodisk-ZnO DSSCs. It is interesting to note that, after the deposition of the TiO2 film on nanodisk-ZnO, the surface trap density was further reduced, which indicates that the thin TiO2 layer acts as an effective passivation layer.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
The OCVD analysis revealed that nanodisk-ZnO has fewer trap densities, which would be beneficial to suppress recombination of charge carriers. EIS analysis was employed to obtain more insight into the recombination dynamics in the solar cells utilizing comm-ZnO and nanodisk-ZnO. An equivalent DSSC circuit (Fig. S5, ESI†) developed by Bisquert and coworkers was used to extract important physical parameters by fitting to the EIS spectra (Fig. S6, ESI†).43,44 To neutralize the effect of series resistances from wiring and the counter electrode, the voltage drops across the solar cells due to resistance (VS and VCE, respectively) were subtracted to obtain the displacement in the Fermi level, known as the Fermi voltage (VF = Vapp − VS − VCE). As previously mentioned, VF is a measure of the displacement in the Fermi level from the equilibrium position (VF = (EFn − EF0)/q, where q is elementary charge) and has a direct relationship with the chemical capacitance, which can be measured by EIS (Fig. 6A). Chemical capacitance as a function of the conduction band position (ECB) and displacement in the Fermi level (EFn) is given as43,44,51,52 (10)Here, kB and T are the Boltzmann constant and the temperature, respectively. Cμ follows the trend nanodisk-ZnO–TiCl4 > comm-ZnO > nanodisk-ZnO; on the other hand, VOC follows the trend nanodisk-ZnO–TiCl4 > nanodisk-ZnO > comm-ZnO. The VOC of the DSSCs is given by the difference in the EFn of ZnO/TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte and in a good performing cell under illumination, the EFn level should lie very close to the ECB band of ZnO/TiO2. Hence, two parameters are important to assess the VOC trend: the position of the ECB and the density of states in the conduction band. Now as stated earlier (eqn (10)), Cμ increases with the decrease in the difference between ECB and EFn, but the EFn position is fixed by the application of an external bias. Hence, a higher capacitance in comm-ZnO would lead to a lower ECB level that could lead to a lower VOC. However, the case of nanodisk-ZnO–TiCl4 is different due to the presence of TiO2 on the surface of ZnO. There are two reasons that could explain this discrepancy. (1) The presence of TiO2 will lead to a change in the equilibrium concentration of conduction band states that would change the pre-exponential factor in the calculation of Cμ. (2) Cμ is a sum of chemical capacitances due to conduction band states and trap states. And as discussed above in nanodisk-ZnO–TiCl4, the trap states are passivated efficiently, hence a decreased capacitance from the trap states might have contributed to the increase in the total Cμ.

To compare various photoanodes with different energy level configurations for various physical parameters (e.g., recombination resistance (Rr) and electron lifetime (τn)), all solar cells should have a similar number of electrons in the conduction band. This condition can be fulfilled if there is an equal distance between the Fermi level and the conduction band of all the photoanodes; eqn (10) emphasizes that, to ensure the above mentioned criteria, all of the solar cells should have equal chemical capacitance. Hence, the voltage scale is shifted to produce an overlap in the chemical capacitance (Fig. S7A, ESI†). This condition is called an equivalent conduction band (Vecb).
As shown in Fig. 6B, nanodisk-ZnO has better recombination resistance than comm-ZnO, and it was further improved by the TiCl4 treatment of the nanodisk-ZnO film. The increase in recombination resistance results in an improved VOC for the solar cells employing nanodisk-ZnO. The recombination resistance increases in the order nanodisk-ZnO–TiCl4 > nanodisk-ZnO > comm-ZnO, which follows the same trend as VOC. The electron lifetime as measured by EIS also showed an improvement in carrier lifetime in the solar cells utilizing nanodisk-ZnO (Fig. 6C and Fig. S8, ESI†). It is worth noting that, even though the nanodisk-ZnO has a lower dye loading, it still showed a higher current compared to comm-ZnO. This increase is attributed to improved carrier lifetime and higher recombination resistance. This improvement of recombination resistance might be the result of fewer surface and bulk traps in nanodisk-ZnO. The surface traps in nanodisk-ZnO were further reduced by passivation as a result of the TiCl4 treatment. This conclusion was further supported by the OCVD analysis, which showed a decrease in surface trap density in nanodisk-ZnO after the TiCl4 treatment.
The electron conductivity of the ZnO film can be calculated as follows: σn = L × A/Rtr, where L is the thickness, A is the area of the ZnO film, and Rtr is the transport resistance that was determined by the EIS analysis. Nanodisk-ZnO showed better electronic conductivity (Fig. 6D), which may be a result of better connectivity between individual crystallites. The linkage between individual particles was further improved by the TiCl4 treatment, which aided in improving the FF. In order to determine if there were any diffusion limitations on the performance, the electron diffusion length (Dn) was calculated (Dn = L2/CμRtr, Fig. S7B, ESI†). All of the solar cells showed very long electron diffusion lengths (∼1 mm, Fig. S7C, ESI†), which were much longer than the thickness of the ZnO films employed to fabricate the photoanodes. This indicates that the performance of these ZnO solar cells is not diffusion-limited. Both OCVD and EIS analyses show that the solar cells based on nanodisk-ZnO exhibit better recombination dynamics because of the unique properties and favorable trap densities. Nanodisk-ZnO, which possesses interconnected crystallites, provides better pathways for electron transport, which leads to a superior FF.
Conclusions
We developed a simple, scalable, two-step process to synthesize nanodisk-shaped ZnO nanoparticles with unique surface properties. The nanodisk-shape ZnO particles are composed of interconnected primary particles that foster electron transport to the conducting surface when employed in DSSCs. In addition, the lower trap densities in nanodisk-ZnO contribute to suppressing the recombination and increasing the electron lifetime. The lower trap densities are also beneficial for electron transport because the transfer of electrons to the conducting surface via randomly packed particles is primarily governed by the trapping and detrapping mechanisms. Additional improvements in the performance of nanodisk-ZnO based DSSCs were attained by improving the dye loading and further reducing the surface trap density (achieved by the TiCl4 treatment). This surface treatment contributes to the higher recombination resistance and, as a result, substantially increased the VOC.
