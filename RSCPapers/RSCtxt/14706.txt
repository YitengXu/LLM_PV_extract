ChinaReceived 4th July 2013, Accepted 9th September 2013First published on 10th September 2013AbstractThe photooxidation of water using faceted Ag3PO4 was investigated, guided by theoretical modelling. Firstly, theoretical calculations were performed to predict the optimum morphology for solar energy conversion by probing the surface energies of three primary low index facets of Ag3PO4: {100}, {110} and {111}. It was elucidated that the {111} facet possessed considerably higher surface energy (1.65 J m−2) than either {110} or {100} (0.78 and 0.67 J m−2 respectively). We therefore attempted to fabricate Ag3PO4 crystals with {111} facets. Tetrahedral Ag3PO4 crystals, composed of {111} facets, were then successfully synthesised using a novel kinetic control method in the absence of surfactants. In comparison to rhombic dodecahedron {110} and cubic {100} structures, tetrahedral crystals show an extremely high activity for water photooxidation, with an initial oxygen evolution rate exceeding 6 mmol h−1 g−1, 10 times higher than either {110} or {100} facets. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that the internal quantum yield for water photooxidation is almost unity at 400 nm, and greater than 80% from 365 to 500 nm, achieved by {111} terminated tetrahedrons. The excellent and reproducible performance is attributed to a synergistic effect between high surface energy and a small hole mass, leading to high charge carrier mobility and active surface reaction sites.Broader contextControlling the percentage of exposed facets on crystal surfaces can lead to a dramatic change in reactivity and also yield unique surface/bulk properties. Facet engineering has been demonstrated on certain photocatalysts with activity markedly improved. Very recently, visible light responsive photocatalysts, in particular Ag3PO4, have attracted much attention for their potential to meet the required efficiencies to produce clean renewable fuels. Using theoretical calculations, it was elucidated that the {111} facet possessed considerably higher surface energy than either {110} or {100}. Tetrahedral {111} Ag3PO4 crystals were then synthesised using a novel kinetic control method. In comparison to {110} and {100} structures, {111} crystals show an extremely high activity for water photooxidation, with an initial oxygen evolution rate exceeding 6 mmol h−1 g−1, 10 times higher than either {110} or {100} facets. The quantum yield for water photooxidation is almost unity at 400 nm using {111} crystals. The excellent and reproducible performance is attributed to a synergistic effect between high surface energy and a small hole mass. In a broader sense, the facile and green kinetic control method can be extended to the synthesis of other materials with preferred facets and is potentially an excellent candidate for incorporation into solar cells with a view to enhancing solar energy conversion.IntroductionWater photolysis for H2 fuel synthesis has the potential to both meet increasing demand for renewable energy and address climate change caused by CO2 emissions. However the search for a solitary low cost semiconductor which has a band gap suitable for an efficient, neutral water splitting reaction under ambient conditions has been met with little success. Nature, however, demonstrates an efficient strategy to utilise solar irradiation (nearly unity quantum yield) by spatially and temporally separating electrons and holes in wireless photosynthesis reactions.1 So, water splitting can be envisaged as two half reactions: water oxidation, and an equivalent of proton reduction to hydrogen fuel. The former of the two is much more challenging because one molecule of gaseous oxygen requires 4 holes, and occurs on a timescale of ca. 5 orders of magnitude slower than H2 evolution, proven in both natural and artificial photosynthesis.2–4 Therefore, finding a relatively cheap, robust and efficient water oxidation photocatalyst is widely accepted to be key to solar driven fuel synthesis, if it is to be commercially viable.Photocatalysis involves three key steps: absorption of photons, separation of charge carriers and transport to the surface, and consequential surface redox reactions. Absorption is intrinsic of the band gap in most cases; however, both separation and surface reactions can be altered by charge carrier mobility and surface energy respectively. Charge carrier separation and transport has been studied extensively, and is one of the key rate determining steps in efficient water photolysis,2 a factor which can be manipulated by controlling the crystal structure of the photocatalyst.Manipulating the crystal structure will result in controlling the percentage of exposed facets on crystal surfaces and thus can lead to a dramatic change in reactivity and yield unique surface and bulk properties, a phenomenon which has been widely investigated in sensing,5 electronics,6 magnetic memory devices7 and catalysis.8 The surface reaction of a catalyst is often determined by its surface chemistry. It is widely accepted in catalysis that a higher surface energy leads to a more reactive surface. Unfortunately, conventionally reactive facets are often diminished during the crystal growth process as a result of surface energy minimisation. However, high surface energy facets can be maintained under specific synthesis conditions. For example, anatase TiO2 crystals are often composed of thermodynamically stable {101} facets, with an average surface energy of 0.44 J m−2. Very recently, led by theoretical predictions, {001} facets on TiO2 were successfully prepared by using fluorine ions as a capping agent. The {001} facets possess a much higher catalytic activity due to higher surface energy, calculated to be 0.90 J m−2 (over 2 times higher than {101}).9 Therefore, one of the most efficient and practical approaches to increasing the reactivity of catalysts is to control the exposed facets to achieve a more active surface by using specialised methods. The investigations have proceeded rapidly over the last few years, with various areas of expertise probing different techniques to enhance morphological control.10Ag3PO4 is used commonly as a photographic emulsion precursor,11 in the pharmaceutical field as an antibacterial agent,12 and is also considered to be an ideal candidate for water photooxidation due to an appropriate band gap position, non-toxicity, and high photocatalytic ability.13–15 In order to attain specifically terminated facets, morphology controlling agents (MCAs), such as organic surfactants (e.g. PVP), or capping agents (e.g. fluorine ions9) are commonly employed. Due to strong interaction with the substrate, complete removal of these MCAs is very challenging, but absolutely essential for effective catalytic activity in water splitting. One of the major research obstacles facing researchers today is developing a facile, MCA-free synthesis route to attain clean, reactive facets, for example, by kinetic control.16 Therefore we attempted to manipulate the material facets in order to control both charge transport (in particular hole transport and mobility) and surface catalytic reactions using a facile and environmentally friendly approach. Previously, photocatalytic organic decomposition on faceted Ag3PO4 has been reported. For example, Wang and co-workers synthesised tetrahedral shaped particles after attempting to rejuvenate Ag–Ag3PO4. Due to the presence of silver metal within the Ag3PO4 particles, they exhibited lower activity for the degradation of the dye RhB in comparison to mixed faceted particles.17 Bi and co-workers have also compared photocatalytic degradation reactions over cubic and rhombic dodecahedral silver phosphate structures.18 However, to date, there have not been reports on the influence of different exposed Ag3PO4 facets on water photooxidation, which is a well-known rate determining step in photocatalytic water splitting and has different requirements in comparison to organic decomposition reactions. Herein, this study shows the manipulation of Ag3PO4 facets, for the first time investigates their individual ability for water photooxidation and details the underlying mechanisms which control oxygen production, specifically between different low index facets of Ag3PO4 using diverse characterisation methods and theoretical modelling.Experimental methodsMaterial preparationMicrosized Ag3PO4 tetrahedrons were prepared by a novel kinetic control method. In a typical synthesis batch, 12 mmol of AgNO3 (99% purity, Fisher Scientific) was dissolved in 80 ml of ethanol (95% purity, Merck Schuchardt) under rapid stirring. Simultaneously, 20 ml of H3PO4 (85% purity, Acros Organics) was mixed thoroughly with 80 ml ethanol, under similarly vigorous stirring. After both products were separately dissolved, and both solutions became transparent, the AgNO3–ethanol mixture was added drop-wise to the H3PO4–ethanol solution. An instantaneous precipitate should form under stirring, and then rapidly disappear. Addition of AgNO3–ethanol should proceed until the H3PO4–ethanol solution turns slightly cloudy, upon which, the H3PO4–ethanol + AgNO3–ethanol suspension should be added back into the AgNO3–ethanol solution. The previously clear AgNO3–ethanol solution should then yield an instantaneously bright yellow Ag3PO4 precipitate. After 1 hour of stirring, the solution should turn a bright green colour, indicating the growth and shape change of the Ag3PO4 particles. After being washed with ethanol, and centrifuged three times, the photocatalyst was then placed in a drying oven overnight at 70 °C. This ensured all moisture was removed from the catalyst.Rhombic dodecahedral and cubic Ag3PO4 crystals were synthesised using a previously reported recipe.18 BiVO4 was also synthesised according to a previously reported recipe.19Material characterisationPowder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) was performed using a Rigaku RINT 2100, with a voltage of 40 kV, at 30 mA, using a Cu source with Kα1 = 1.540562 and Kα2 = 1.544398, accompanied by a nickel filter. Analysis of the data was performed using the accompanying software, MDI Jade. UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-Vis 2550 spectrophotometer fitted with an integrating sphere. Reflectance measurements were performed on powdered samples, using a standard barium sulphate powder as a reference. The reflection measurements were then converted to absorption spectra using the Kubelka–Mulk transformation. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs were taken using a JEOL JSM-6701F field-emission SEM. The SEM was operated at 15 kV, using an energy dispersive detector. Specific surface area measurements were taken using the BET method (N2 absorption, TriStar 3000, Micromeritics). TEM studies were undertaken using a JEOL2010F with tilt capabilities.Photocatalytic analysisPhotooxidation reactions were carried out in both the UK and Japan to verify the continuity of results, which were deemed to be consistent. For a typical oxygen evolution experiment, 0.2 g of Ag3PO4 powder was dispersed in 230 ml of deionised water, with an additional amount of 0.85 g AgNO3 acting as an electron acceptor. The whole reaction was carried out in a custom Pyrex® glass reactor. Before the solution was irradiated, the reactor was either connected to a vacuum system (Japan), and evacuated, or thoroughly purged with argon (UK) to remove all oxygen in the headspace of the reactor and dissolved oxygen in water. A baseline was taken to ensure that there was little or no detectable oxygen in the system. A 300 W Xe lamp (UK: TrusTech PLS-SXE 300/300UV; Japan: Hayashi Tokei, Luminar Ace 210) was used to irradiate the sample after a suitable baseline was obtained (power density full arc: ca. 500 mW cm−2, 420 nm filter: ca. 360 mW cm−2). A small sample of gas was sent automatically to a gas chromatograph (UK: Varian 430-GC, TCD, argon carrier gas, Japan: Shimadzu GC-8A, TCD, argon carrier gas) at specific intervals, upon which the concentration of oxygen was identified.Internal quantum yield measurements were measured in the UK by inserting a band pass filter (365, 400, 420, 500, 600 nm) in front of a 150 W Xe light source (Newport Spectra) to obtain the correct wavelength. The light intensity was measured at 5 different points and then the average of the light intensity was taken. The efficiency was then calculated by the standard formula quoted in the literature:20,21 QY (%) = 4 × number of O2 molecules detected divided by the number of photons absorbed by the photocatalyst.The reported turnover frequency (TOF min−1) was calculated using the following formula as quoted in the literature:20 TOF min−1 = the ratio of the number of reacted holes to the number of atoms in the photocatalyst.Results and discussionFirstly, we performed surface energy calculations of {100}, {110}, and {111} planes, using a DFT + U approach (for details see ESI†). The surface structures are based on a slab model including 192 atoms of Ag3PO4 with 10 Å thickness of a vacuum region. Geometry relaxations were performed with the mid layers of the slab fixed. The relaxed geometries of the three surfaces are depicted in Fig. 1. The surface energy (γ) was calculated from the following formula:γ = (Eslab − NEbulk)/2Awhere Eslab is the total energy of the slab and Ebulk is the total energy of the bulk per unit. N and A are the number of units included in the slab and the surface area. The obtained surface energies are 0.67 J m−2, 0.78 J m−2, and 1.65 J m−2 for {100}, {110}, and {111}, respectively.22 Fig. 1  Relaxed geometries for (a) {100}, (b) {110}, and (c) {111} surfaces of Ag3PO4. The results clearly show that the {111} facet is over two times more energetic than the second highest facet, {110}. Previous studies about Ag3PO4 also show an anisotropic distribution of electron–hole masses (mh*, Table 1).23 According to earlier reports, smaller values of mh* lead to a greater hole mobility, therefore making transport to the surface much more straightforward, and thus decreasing the probability of recombination.24 Taking into account the possible structural tendencies of both PO4 anion and Ag cation, it was envisaged that a carefully controlled kinetic procedure can create the desired morphology. Tetrahedral Ag3PO4 crystals purely composed of {111} facets were also shown to be theoretically possible using Materials Studio (see ESI, Fig. S1 and S2†).

The exposed {111} facets were controlled by manipulating the concentration of H3PO4 in ethanol, whereby excess amounts of phosphoric acid not only provide a precursor, but also control the rate of Ag3PO4 nucleation and initial growth. In this case, ethanol acts as a less dipolar solvent, instead of water. Directional growth is halted at a specific concentration of H3PO4 in comparison to the silver precursor (AgNO3). No other structures were found either within the powdered samples, or on the clean surfaces of the particles. At neutral pH and equal stoichiometry between silver and phosphate ions, mixed faceted shapes are formed as previously reported.14 Rhombic dodecahedrons {110} and cubes {100}, which have been reported for organic dye photodecomposition,18 were also fabricated to explore the correlation of facets with photocatalytic activities for oxygen production from water. Fig. 2  (a) SEM micrograph of Ag3PO4 crystals: (A) tetrahedron, (B) cubic, (C) rhombic dodecahedron, and (D) Materials Studio visualisation of a tetrahedron. (b) TEM tilt studies. A tetrahedron indicated by dotted lines is rotated on an axis from −66 to +50°. The different morphologies have also been confirmed by SEM micrographs (Fig. 2a). In order to further verify the tetrahedral morphology, TEM tilt studies have carefully been undertaken. As seen in Fig. 2b, the faceted compound is rotated on an axis, to reveal 4 identical facets in total from different angles, proving they are tetrahedrons fully characterised with {111} surfaces.The X-ray diffraction patterns of the three samples (Fig. 3a) clearly indicate a full phase match to that of body-centred cubic crystalline Ag3PO4 (6.004 Å, BCC, P3n, JCPDS no. 06-0505), and show no other trace peaks associated with the precursors used in fabrication, indicating that the synthesis methods lead to a completely well crystallised pure phase compound. The diffraction patterns exhibit variations in intensity ratios. Tetrahedral Ag3PO4 particles have an intensity ratio of 0.98 between (222) and (200) planes, whilst the rhombic dodecahedron and cubic structures have an approximate ratio of 0.68, confirming that tetrahedral particles are comprised of {111} crystalline planes.25 The intensity ratio between (110) and (200) for rhombic dodecahedrons is 1.23, and 0.57 for the cubic crystals, confirming as previously reported that rhombic dodecahedrons and cubic structures are composed of {110} and {100} facets respectively.26 It is noted that the (111) diffraction peak is not directly seen due to the reflection conditions of the space group, similarly, (100) cannot be seen either. Fig. 3  (a) XRD pattern of faceted Ag3PO4 crystals. (b) UV-Vis absorbance spectra of faceted Ag3PO4 crystals. Before testing the catalytic activity for direct water photooxidation, the UV-Vis absorption spectra between the three different morphologies were measured. There is a slight difference between the samples: rhombic dodecahedrons are able to absorb light up to approximately 530 nm, whilst both tetrahedrons and cubes have an absorption edge around 515 nm. Since the size of the crystals is very similar (∼2 μm) and there are no signs of foreign elemental doping in the sample, it is thought that the absorption edge shift is likely to be due to the morphology.The faceted samples were tested for the photooxidation of water in the presence of an electron scavenger under ambient conditions. As seen in Fig. 4a, oxygen evolves extremely fast, at an initial rate of 6072 μmol h−1 g−1, for tetrahedral Ag3PO4 particles under full arc irradiation,27 over 10 times more than either rhombic dodecahedral or cubic samples which have been reported for organic photodecomposition but not for water splitting.18 Furthermore, the benchmark material for visible light water photooxidation, BiVO4, was prepared using a previously described method.19 Tests under visible light show a very similar oxygen evolution rate as reported (Fig. S7†). {111} faceted Ag3PO4 evolves oxygen at a rate of 6.5 times BiVO4 as shown in Fig. 4b. We also compared {111} faceted Ag3PO4 with mixed-faceted Ag3PO4 prepared according to a previous recipe.14 The {111} faceted sample shows 242% more activity in comparison to a mixed faceted sample (Fig. 4b). The activity of all samples was also compared under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) (Fig. S7†). Both rhombic dodecahedrons and cubic crystals are less active than the mixed faceted Ag3PO4 for water photooxidation, with tetrahedral Ag3PO4 performing best under visible light irradiation. Fig. 4  (a) Oxygen yield comparison of Ag3PO4 facets using a 300 W Xe light source under full arc irradiation, with AgNO3 acting as an electron scavenger. (b) Oxygen yield comparison between the tetrahedral sample, previously reported random mixed faceted Ag3PO4 and BiVO4 under 300 W Xe lamp full arc irradiation, using AgNO3 as an electron scavenger. (c) Internal quantum yield of tetrahedral Ag3PO4 crystals (inset: solar spectrum at sea level). Using the BET method, tetrahedral Ag3PO4 crystals were experimentally verified to have a surface area of 1.0 m2 g−1, somewhat smaller than cubes (1.4 m2 g−1) and rhombic dodecahedrons (2.4 m2 g−1). Therefore the increased activity cannot be attributed to the effect of the surface area. In order to make a more reliable and reproducible assessment of the activity of {111} faceted crystals, they were prepared and tested again in NIMS, Japan using the same reaction conditions. The difference in activity is approximately 5.1%, which likely arises from the difference in pressure between the two systems.28 Therefore not only is the synthesis reproducible, but the performance is very similar in different systems as well.As shown in Table 1, the turnover frequency, which was calculated using the standard equation,29 is dramatically different between samples, with the biggest difference being between tetrahedral and rhombic dodecahedral samples (15 times higher). It should be noted that the TOF min−1 is greatly underestimated, as this calculation assumes all atoms are on the surface and involved in surface reactions, which is not true in our particular case, since the particle size is larger than 2 μm, as many atoms do not take part in the photocatalytic surface reaction. The turnover number is an effective way to prove the catalytic effect of chemical reactions. The turnover number is ca. 5 for tetrahedral Ag3PO4, meaning that the reaction is a truly photocatalytic process for the {111} faceted sample. Due to the electron scavenger used in the experiments (AgNO3, reported to be the most efficient for photooxidation), after a period of around 120 minutes, silver metal (Ag+ + e− → Ag0) has completely covered the surface of the semiconductor, and significantly prevents further oxidation by blocking incident photon flux, as seen in other studies,30 which limits the calculated minimum TOF min−1 and turnover number. After the experimental run, the sample was characterised again by XRD. The diffraction pattern of Ag3PO4 even after an extensive TOF min−1 measurement is very similar to the freshly synthesised sample, and as expected, metallic silver was also detected as a dominant surface species (see ESI Fig. S8†).The internal quantum yield for water photooxidation was measured to further demonstrate the efficiency of the tetrahedral particles. Again, a high quantum yield was observed, nearly unity at 400 nm (Fig. 4c). More importantly, the tetrahedral particles show high quantum yield (>80%) at a wide wavelength range, from the UV portion of the spectrum throughout the visible until ∼500 nm, which nearly matches the peak light intensity of the solar spectrum (Fig. 4c inset). Taking into account the light scattering by the large particles which was assumed zero in our measurement, the actual quantum yield could be higher than the reported. This suggests that the enhanced photocatalyst is able to harvest light effectively, separate and then utilise charge carriers extremely efficiently.A suggested mechanism for enhanced photocatalytic activity on the faceted compound states that depending on the surface structure, electrons or holes will specifically migrate to separate sites.31 This is due to the differences in the effective masses of holes and electrons, which are directionally sensitive to the crystal structure. The hole mass along [111] is much smaller compared to other directions in Ag3PO4 crystals (Table 1), indicating that hole migration towards {111} facets is greatly encouraged, since hole mobility is increased, which is a critical issue in a n-type semiconductor, e.g. Ag3PO4. The water splitting process is dominated by water oxidation as mentioned in the Introduction, and thus a higher mobility of holes favors a faster and more efficient transport of holes to the surface for oxidation reactions. The reason for the high surface energy of the {111} surface is the over-abundance of dangling phosphorus–oxygen bonds, which act as oxidation sites. According to our calculations, in order to reveal the {111} plane, P–O bonds must be cut, resulting in very short layer by layer distances along [111]. From extensive studies in catalysis,32 it is widely accepted that a high surface energy is very beneficial to surface reaction rates. The high surface energy then dramatically enhances the catalytic ability at the surface of {111} facets. The combination of both a high hole mobility and high surface energy results in a unique synergistic effect, culminating in a significant increase in water photooxidation. Both Ag3PO4 rhombic dodecahedrons and cubes possess slightly higher surface areas, but they have larger hole masses and much smaller surface energies, which lead to a lower activity. It has been reported that both rhombic dodecahedrons and Ag3PO4 cubes show better activity than the mixed faceted Ag3PO4 for organic dye photobleaching.18 This chemical process is mechanistically quite different from water splitting. Thermodynamically, there is a difference in required chemical potentials between water splitting and dye bleaching. More importantly, kinetically as a dominating step in water splitting, water photooxidation requires 4 holes, and occurs on a relatively long timescale of ∼0.5 seconds.2,3 However the dominating step in organic photooxidation is the oxygen reduction reaction, which is relatively fast on a microsecond timescale.2–4,33 Historically for example, N-doped TiO2 is able to bleach organic contaminants faster than pure TiO2, but unable to efficiently evolve molecular oxygen under visible irradiation, even in the presence of scavengers.4 Analogously, both rhombic dodecahedrons and Ag3PO4 cubes perform much worse for water photooxidation, which is probably due to their high number of unfavorable surface reaction sites. The mixed faceted Ag3PO4 sample presents an intermediate activity, which is expected.ConclusionIn summary, theoretical calculations have directed us towards the synthesis of tetrahedral Ag3PO4 crystals composed of {111} terminated surfaces. The experimental results show that the synthesised tetrahedrons not only exhibit nearly unity quantum yield at 400 nm but also boast a high internal quantum yield (>80%) over a very wide wavelength range, from the UV to 500 nm. The activity for water photooxidation is nearly 12 times greater than the {100} and {110} faceted crystals. It also shows 240% and 650% enhancement compared with benchmark photocatalysts, Ag3PO4 (mixed facets) and BiVO4, respectively. In addition, in a heterogeneous system, the sample shows an underestimated TOF min−1 of 2.6 × 10−2 and a turnover number of ca. 5, even though the particle size is very large (>2 μm) and the surface area is very small. The excellent performance of {111} faceted Ag3PO4 tetrahedral crystals is attributed a cooperative effect between high mobility of holes and high surface energy. These findings provide an efficient way to improve the photocatalytic properties of a catalyst, which would be an excellent choice to be integrated into a water splitting system for solar fuel synthesis and employed in solar cells for electricity production. The material preparation method also provides some useful information for a reproducible, surfactant free and facile way to control surface facet and bulk properties.Notes and referencesS. Y.

Broader contextControlling the percentage of exposed facets on crystal surfaces can lead to a dramatic change in reactivity and also yield unique surface/bulk properties. Facet engineering has been demonstrated on certain photocatalysts with activity markedly improved. Very recently, visible light responsive photocatalysts, in particular Ag3PO4, have attracted much attention for their potential to meet the required efficiencies to produce clean renewable fuels. Using theoretical calculations, it was elucidated that the {111} facet possessed considerably higher surface energy than either {110} or {100}. Tetrahedral {111} Ag3PO4 crystals were then synthesised using a novel kinetic control method. In comparison to {110} and {100} structures, {111} crystals show an extremely high activity for water photooxidation, with an initial oxygen evolution rate exceeding 6 mmol h−1 g−1, 10 times higher than either {110} or {100} facets. The quantum yield for water photooxidation is almost unity at 400 nm using {111} crystals. The excellent and reproducible performance is attributed to a synergistic effect between high surface energy and a small hole mass. In a broader sense, the facile and green kinetic control method can be extended to the synthesis of other materials with preferred facets and is potentially an excellent candidate for incorporation into solar cells with a view to enhancing solar energy conversion.
