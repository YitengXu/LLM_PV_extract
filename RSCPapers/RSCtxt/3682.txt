    , Accepted 25th January 2020First published on 3rd February 2020AbstractA novel 2D bilayered Dion–Jacobson (DJ) type hybrid perovskite, (2-methyl-1,5-diaminopentane)(methylammonium)Pb2I7 (1), with a narrow band gap of 1.96 eV has been reported, and such a DJ-type hybrid has been for the first time demonstrated to exhibit broadband photoresponsive properties with high photoresponsivity (13 A W−1 under a 10 V bias) and considerable switching ratios (>103).

Organic–inorganic hybrid three-dimensional (3D) perovskites AMX3 (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+ (MA+), HC(NH2)2+ (FA+); M = Pb2+, Sn2+, Ge2+, etc.; X = Cl−, Br−, I−) have emerged as a new class of semiconductor materials that demonstrate intriguing optoelectronic properties due to a large absorption coefficient, modest charge mobility, and long carrier diffusion length.1–6 Importantly, by incorporating large alkyl ammonium or aromatic ammonium cations into inorganic frameworks, two-dimensional (2D) layered hybrid perovskites can be achieved;7–12 besides, two-dimensional fully inorganic perovskite halides have also been demonstrated to be an alternative for promising optoelectronic properties.13–15 Such layered structures not only afford higher environmental stability and greater structural flexibility but also exhibit tremendous potential for optoelectronic applications such as solar cells,16–21 light emitting diodes (LED),11,22,23 lasers,24–27 and photodetectors.1,28–33 For instance, solar cells with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.52% have been realized by utilizing the Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) type 2D perovskite (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (BA = n-butylammonium). The devices exhibit greatly improved stability in comparison with their 3D counterparts.34 Moreover, by using layered multiple quantum wells in 2D perovskites, LEDs can achieve external quantum efficiencies (EQE) up to 11.7%, exhibiting higher EQE than those based on 3D perovskites.35 As an important component of modern optoelectronic systems, photodetectors based on 2D hybrid perovskites have also attracted much attention. Those 2D hybrid perovskites make it possible to detect light at various wavelengths due to their distinct optical band gaps. For example, photodetectors with tunable photoresponse have been reported by precisely controlling the n number of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3) perovskites.36 On the other hand, benefitting from the flexibility of the 2D layered structures, photodetectors with new functionalities could be identified. Very recently, Luo et al. reported a self-powered photodetector using ferroelectric (EA)2(MA)2Pb3Br10 (EA = ethylammonium).37 This ferroelectric arises from the distortion of inorganic moieties and synergistic ordering of organic moieties, further leading to a high built-in electric field inside ferroelectric devices, enabling self-powered photodetection behaviors.
Besides widely applied RP-type 2D perovskites, recent attempts have been devoted to synthesize Dion–Jacobson (DJ) type (A′An−1MnX3n+1, A′ = divalent cations) perovskites.38–41 Compared with RP-type perovskites that feature pairs of interdigitated interlayer monovalent organic spacers per unit cell, the DJ-type perovskites are characterized by divalent interlayer spacers, requiring only one cation per formula unit, thus shortening the interlayer distance.42,43 But beyond that, shortening of I⋯I distances can also be achieved by using small “spacer” cations (such as ethanolammonium or methylhydrazinium).44,45 Furthermore, the neighboring inorganic slabs in DJ-type perovskites tend to stack in a perfect (0,0 displacement) arrangement, and bridge each other by diamine cations without a van der Waals (vdW) gap. The elimination of the vdW gap results in higher stabilities of DJ-type 2D perovskites than that of their RP-type counterparts.38 Recently, DJ phase 2D perovskites have been applied for stable solar cells with a PCE of 9.20%;39 nonetheless, relative demonstrations of DJ-type perovskites for photodetection remain rare.
Plate-like crystals of (2meptH2)(MA)Pb2I7 (1, 2mept = 2-methyl-1,5-diaminopentane and MA = methylammonium) were grown by temperature controlled crystallization techniques. As seen in Fig. 1a, by tailoring the 3D perovskite MAPbI3 with the 2meptH2 diammonium cation, the DJ-type perovskite (2meptH2)(MA)Pb2I7 can be obtained. Single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that 1 crystallizes in Cmcm at 250 K (Table S1†) and the phase purity was further verified by powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S1†). TGA/DTA and DSC results show that 1 is thermally stable up to 545 K with no phase transition (Fig. S8 and S9†). Its basic inorganic framework consists of corner-sharing [PbI6]4− octahedra with 2meptH22+ separating the perovskite slabs and MA+ filling in the perovskite voids. Notably, unlike the widely studied RP-type perovskites that have pairs of interdigitating cations between the neighboring inorganic layers, the DJ-type perovskite compound 1 only has one sheet of 2meptH22+. Such a structural arrangement, therefore, eliminates the van der Waals gap between the inorganic perovskite bilayers, and leads to an interlayer distance with an I⋯I distance of 4.94 Å (Fig. 1b), significantly shorter than the interlayer distance of 8.72 Å in (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 (Fig. 1c, BA = n-butylammonium). In 2D hybrid perovskites, typically, the out-of-plane electron hopping is severely hindered by the insulating organic layer. In this regard, shortening the I⋯I distance could greatly enhance the out-of-plane electron transport, which may be beneficial for the optoelectronic applications of 1, particularly for photodetection. Moreover, the connections between inorganic layers in 1 are different from those in RP-type perovskites that rely on weak van der Waals interaction, and the inorganic slabs in 1 connect each other via stronger H-bonds (Fig. S2†). Previous reports have clearly verified that the existence of H-bonds could enhance the binding energy between the inorganic layers of DJ-type perovskites, making them more stable.40–43 Moreover, stability increase and the elimination of van der Waals can also be achieved by using cations that are able to form multiple hydrogen bonds (for instance methylhydrazinium CH3NH2NH2+).45

The temperature dependence on conductivity validates the typical semiconductor properties of 1 (Fig. S3†). Significantly, planar-type single-crystal photodetectors were fabricated on the bulk red crystal of 1 (Fig. 2a) by depositing Ag electrodes on the surface of (100) crystal planes, with the electrode spacing of 100 μm (Fig. 2b). The photodetection activities of 1 were investigated depending on the wavelength and light intensity. As shown in Fig. 2c (Fig. S4†), the current–voltage (I–V) measurements of 1 have been executed in the dark and under illumination with 405 nm light at different power intensities from 1.6 to 50.8 mW cm−2. Clearly, the dark current was as low as 2 × 10−10 A at 10 V bias. The low dark current significantly enables an impressive on/off ratio of current, which is critical for the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of the photodetector. The I–V curves show a typical ohmic conduction behavior, which is thus benefited by the collection of photo-excited carriers. Under 405 nm light illumination, the photocurrent of the devices is observed to increase drastically with increasing incident light power and a high photocurrent of 4.8 × 10−7 A was achieved at 10 V bias under 50.8 mW cm−2 illumination. Clearly, a considerable current on/off ratio of 2400 (>103) is achieved, even higher than that of the photodetectors based on some other perovskite hybrids,46,47 indicating the superior light-sensitive properties of the 2D bilayered DJ-type hybrid perovskites.48 Photoresponsivity (R) is a critical important figure-of-merit to determine the sensitivity of photodetectors to an optical signal, which is expressed as R = Iph/PS (Iph is the difference between the illuminated current and dark current, P is the incident light intensity and S is the effective area of the detection device). As shown in Fig. 2d, the photoresponsivity R was extracted from the I–V curves under a 10 V bias, which increases linearly from 2.8 to 13 A W−1 as the illumination light intensity decreased, in accordance with the photogating mechanism, and such values are comparable with the photodetectors of other classic 2D hybrid materials.48 As shown in Fig. 3a, time dependent photoresponses of the photodetector were measured by periodically modulating a 405 nm light on and off at different applied voltages (1, 2, 5 V). Notably, even at a low bias of 1.0 V, the photocurrent on/off ratio reaches 130, which indicates the sensitive photoresponse characteristic of 1. In addition, the photodetector possesses effective optical switching behaviors and the on/off switching was reproducible without any attenuation for multiple cycles, showing operational stability and favorable repeatability with a photoresponse time of 40 μs (Fig. S5†). Such a promising photoresponse time firstly demonstrated the stable 2D DJ hybrid perovskite for fast photodetection.49–52 Given the narrow bandgap (1.96 eV) of 1 (Fig. 3b), it's sensitivity to broad spectra from ultraviolet to visible light is expected, which is also desirable for the preparation of a potential broadband photodetector. The photocurrent responses at wavelengths 520 and 637 nm are shown in Fig. 3c and d (Fig. S6 and S7†).

(b) Absorption spectra of 1 (inset: bandgap calculated from the Tauc plot). The photoresponse of the device upon (c) 520 nm and (d) 637 nm light illumination, respectively. 
The typical I–V plots of the device were measured in the dark and under light illumination at different intensities. From the curves, it can be conspicuously seen that the photocurrent increases gradually with the increase of light intensities when the same voltage is applied. Such a wide spectral window with a sensitive photoelectric response suggests the potential of our device as a promising broadband photodetector.
In order to further investigate the structure–property relationship of 1, first-principles calculations were carried out. The electronic band structure of 1 is shown in Fig. 4a. It is shown that, the top of valence bands (VB) and bottom of conduction bands (CB) are both located at the G point, demonstrating a direct-bandgap feature. Since the optical and photoelectric properties of solid state materials are mainly attributed to the electron transitions near the Fermi level, band structure compositions of 1 are further analyzed based on the partial density of states (PDOS), especially the electronic states near the Fermi level (Fig. 4b). It is worth noting that the top part (−5.0 eV to 0.0 eV) of the VB is mostly dominated by the I 5p orbital, which is slightly overlapped with Pb 6s 6p orbitals. Meanwhile, the bottom of the CB is largely dominated by Pb 6p orbitals, whereas, the orbitals of the [2meptH2]2+ cations contribute less to the bands near the Fermi level. Based on these results, it is clear that the electronic states near the Fermi level are constituted by the inorganic lead iodide framework, which mainly determines the optical properties of 1.

In summary, we have successfully obtained a unique 2D bilayered Dion Jacobson type perovskite hybrid with a narrow band gap of 1.96 eV, (2meptH2)(MA)Pb2I7 (1). It exhibits intriguing photoresponsive attributes with extremely high photoresponsivity (13 A W−1 under a 10 V bias) and large switching ratios (>103); indicating the great potential of 1 for high-efficiency photodetection application.
