    , Accepted 3rd July 2018First published on 5th July 2018AbstractA series of π-conjugated copolymers based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and cyanovinylene (CNV) moieties was synthesized by a green, tin-free Knoevenagel polycondensation and they were used as an electron donor for polymer solar cells. This synthetic method results in improved atom economy, the non-use of metal catalysts and the generation of only benign by-products. The relationship between the structure and performance was studied including the optical properties, electrochemical properties, thermal stability, morphologies and the performance in solar cells as donor materials. These copolymers showed broad absorption spectra in the UV-visible region and low-lying HOMO levels at about −5.50 eV due to the presence of the CNV unit. The open-circuit voltages (VOC) of the devices were near to 1.0 eV. A PCE of 8.54% was obtained with the device based on PdC8ThDT:ITIC due to the high hole mobility and excellent morphology of the active layer blend film.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent decades as a promising technology for clean and renewable energy conversion.1–6 Thus far, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction and tandem heterojunction OPV devices have exceeded 14% in academic laboratories,7–9 which shows the great applicability of PSCs. In recent decades, fullerene-based organic solar cells have exhibited PCEs greater than 11%.10,11 However, several reports have indicated that fullerene derivatives suffer from many drawbacks such as high production costs, weak absorption in the visible spectral region and limited energy level variability. To address this issue, non-fullerene acceptors have been actively explored. Several non-fullerene small molecules based on indacenodithiophene (IDT) have recently been investigated and great achievements have been made.12–19 As well as electron acceptors, electron donor materials also play a crucial role in the active layer materials in OPV devices. To obtain efficient devices, it is extremely critical for the donor materials to have complementary absorption with the acceptor materials in the visible range and matching energy levels. Therefore, the design and synthesis of new copolymers as electron donor materials with excellent photovoltaic properties are very important to obtain efficient devices and to fabricate large-area devices.20–25
Most conjugated copolymers are synthesized by transition metal catalyzed Stille polymerization.26–28 However, Stille polymerization still has several unavoidable shortcomings and limitations that restrict its use in large-scale production. First, trimethylstannyl-terminated monomers used in Stille polymerization and the organotin by-products are harmful to the human body and the environment. Second, the trimethyltin bromide produced as a useless by-product from the polymerization adds a financial and environmental cost. Finally, butyllithiums, in particular tert-butyllithium, often used in the preparation of trimethylstannyl-terminated monomers are flammable. These issues violate the principles of green chemistry and hinder large-scale production. Taking account of the great prospects of PSCs, it is urgent to improve atom economy, reduce costs, and avoid the generation of harmful by-products in the large-scale production of π-conjugated polymers.
Concerning these points, polymerization involving the loss of water, as in Knoevenagel polycondensation, has great strengths and potential in the synthesis of conjugated polymers.29,30 Knoevenagel polycondensation is the condensation of compounds that contain active methylene groups with an aldehyde or ketone catalyzed by a weak base. Knoevenagel polycondensation has great potential in the synthesis of conjugated polymers for several reasons. First, it is green and environmentally friendly because it avoids organometallic reactants and thus the formation of toxic organic stannane by-products. Second, the expensive palladium catalysts and ligands are not needed for Knoevenagel polycondensation, thus the overall cost of synthesis will be reduced. Third, the base used as a catalyst in Knoevenagel polycondensation can be easily removed after the reaction, and the residue of catalyst in copolymers can be avoided. Moreover, the atom economy of Knoevenagel polycondensation is high because the only by-product is water, which avoids unnecessary waste. As early as 1994, poly(cyanoterephthalylidene) synthesized by Knoevenagel polycondensation was originally used for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).31 Cyanovinylene containing copolymers prepared by Knoevenagel polycondensation have also been gradually applied in OPV devices but the PCEs were quite low.30,32–35
Herein, we report a series of copolymers (denoted as POD, PODDT, PdC8Th, and PdC8ThDT) based on the electron-rich benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit36,37 and the electron-deficient cyanovinylene unit synthesized by Knoevenagel polycondensation (Scheme 1). The cyano group is a strong electron-deficient group that can be used in the electron-withdrawing unit of donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers to enhance the electron affinity and increase interchain interactions.38–41 Moreover, BDT units have been widely used in OPV devices because their rigid and planar structures help to improve the crystallinity of the resulting copolymers and allow high hole mobilities to be obtained.42,43 To ensure the solubility of the resulting copolymers, two different side chains, alkoxy and two-dimensional conjugated octyl-substituted thienyl side chains were selected.44–46 The two-dimensional conjugated octyl-substituted thienyl side chains were introduced to enhance the planarity and orderliness of the copolymers and to broaden the absorption of copolymers in the visible region.20 On the other hand, the main chain structures were added to the thiophene bridging groups on both sides of the BDT, which could significantly enhance the conjugation of the backbone and reduce the steric hindrance.

The optical and electrochemical properties of the copolymers were characterized and discussed. The morphology of the blend films was also characterized and analyzed by using atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and the relationship between the structure and the performance was verified. These copolymers were used as electron donors in OPV devices, and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) or 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC)12 (Fig. 2(c) gives their chemical structure) was selected as the electron acceptor. Among them, the efficiency of the devices based on PdC8ThDT:PC71BM and PdC8ThDT:ITIC was 7.76% and 8.54%, respectively. The structural, optical, and electrochemical properties and the thermal stability of PdC8ThDT were compared with its Stille-derived counterpart, PdC8ThDT-S, and no obvious difference was found. Furthermore, the performances of the OPV devices based on PdC8ThDT and PdC8ThDT-S were also similar.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis routes of the monomers and copolymers are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†) and Scheme 1, respectively, and the detailed synthetic procedures are described in the Experimental section in the ESI.† The four copolymers were synthesized by Knovenagel polycondensation using t-BuOK as the catalyst, THF as the main solvent and t-BuOH as the auxiliary solvent (VTHF:Vt-BuOK = 20:1). A contrastive copolymer, PdC8ThDT-S, was synthesized by traditional palladium catalyzed Stille polymerization. After the reaction, the copolymers were precipitated in methanol and then collected by filtration. The copolymers were subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, dichloromethane and chloroform. The product obtained by chloroform extraction was dried under a vacuum. After removal of the solvent, the solids were isolated. All copolymers were dissolved in chloroform, chlorobenzene and some other common organic solvents. The molecular weights of the resulting copolymers were determined by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene using polystyrene as the standard. The number-average molecular weights of POD, PODDT, PdC8Th, PdC8ThDT, and PdC8ThDT-S were determined to be 75.2, 25.5, 30.4, 35.5, and 26.7 kDa, respectively, with the corresponding polydispersity indices (PDIs) of 1.60, 1.82, 1.88, 1.87, and 2.10, respectively. The chemical structures of these copolymers were characterized by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy (ESI). The spectra of PdC8ThDT exhibited similarity with the Stille-derived counterpart PdC8ThDT-S. The thermal properties of the copolymers were investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S11 in the ESI†). All of these copolymers showed excellent thermal stability with a 5% weight loss temperature (Td) higher than 400 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, which was satisfactory for application as the active layer of a PSC device. No distinct thermal transition was observed from 30 °C to 350 °C in the differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements (the heating rate was 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen).
Optical properties and light absorption
The optical absorption spectra of the copolymers in diluted chloroform solutions and the thin films spin-coated on quartz substrates are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, respectively. Fig. 1 shows that the copolymers with the analogous main chain structure exhibited a similar absorption profile from 300 nm to near 700 nm. The range of the absorption bands of PdC8Th and PdC8ThDT was broader than those of POD and PODDT, respectively, which could be attributed to the enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking by the incorporation of two thiophene units as side chains in PdC8Th and PdC8ThDT.47,48 Compared with the absorption in solution, bathochromic-shifts of more than 20 nm appeared in the films due to enhanced π–π stacking. It can be observed that in the film absorption spectra, the bathochromic-shifts of PODDT and PdC8ThDT with thiophene bridging groups were more significant than those of POD and PdC8Th, respectively, because the existence of the bridge enhanced the conjugation of the backbone and reduced the steric hindrance, the aggregation of the copolymers in the film state was enhanced accordingly.49 The optical band gaps of POD, PODDT, PdC8Th, PdC8ThDT, and PdC8ThDT-S were 1.91, 1.91, 1.84, 1.86, and 1.88 eV, respectively, as calculated from the thin film absorption spectra (Fig. 1b), and are shown in Table 1. PdC8ThDT exhibited a similar absorption profile in both chloroform solution and thin film form as its Stille-derived counterpart PdC8ThDT-S according to Fig. 1. The minor variations of the absorption spectra between the two copolymers could be attributed to the difference in the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution.

The solution absorption coefficient spectra of the four copolymers are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). Compared to several other copolymers, PdC8ThDT exhibited a significantly higher absorption coefficient in the visible region, with a maximum extinction coefficient of 1.03 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 595 nm. Thus, light harvesting could be ensured in the corresponding OPV devices. Desirable complementary absorption was obtained from the absorption spectrum matching well with the low-bandgap acceptor of ITIC. The copolymers exhibited obvious thermochromism in solution. As shown by the temperature-dependent absorbance (Fig. S14, ESI†), these copolymers exhibited significant aggregation in the chloroform solution at room temperature, but after heating to a certain temperature, the obvious hypochromatic shift appeared and the aggregation peaks disappeared gradually.
Electrochemical properties
To obtain the frontier orbital of the copolymers and to determine the relationship between the structure and the electrochemical properties, electrochemical curves were obtained by using electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 2a). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated from the onset oxidation curves and the onset reduction curves according to the following equations: EHOMO = −e[Eox + (4.80 − EFc/Fc+)] eV; ELUMO = −e[Ered + (4.80 − EFc/Fc+)] eV, where Eox and Ered represent the onset of oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, and EFc/Fc+ refers to the half-wave potential of the referred ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+), which is 0.38 eV. The LUMO levels of the four copolymers were at about −3.0 eV, whereas the HOMO energy levels of POD, PODDT, PdC8Th, PdC8ThDT and PdC8ThDT-S were −5.51, −5.54, −5.58, −5.57 and −5.58 eV, respectively. (The results are summarized in Fig. 2b and Table 1.) The attachment of a strong electron-withdrawing cyanovinylene moiety to the copolymer backbone contributed to the deep-lying HOMO levels, and thus a higher (VOC) value could be obtained in PSCs; this finding was validated by the results of later solar cell devices.

Theoretical calculations
To study the backbone conformation and π-electron delocalization of the resulting copolymers, theoretical calculations of the model compounds with three repeated D–A units were performed using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP level with the 6-31G* basis set. To simplify the calculation, all the alkoxy and alkyl side chains in the thiophene or benzene units were replaced with methoxy and methyl groups. The optimized conformations and their calculated LUMO and HOMO surfaces are shown in Fig. 3. The HOMO orbital levels of the copolymers were well delocalized along their main chains, whereas the LUMO orbital levels were mainly located on the electron-deficient cyanovinylene units. The HOMO/LUMO levels were calculated to be −4.96/−2.68 eV, −4.99/−2.69 eV, −5.01/−2.76 eV, and −5.05/−2.78 eV for POD, PODDT, PdC8Th and PdC8ThDT, respectively, whereas the calculated bandgaps were 2.28, 2.3, 2.25, and 2.27 eV for POD, PODDT, PdC8Th, and PdC8ThDT, respectively. These values showed the same trend with the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry measurements in Fig. 2(a) and Table 1. At the side chains of the model compounds, the HOMO levels of PdC8Th and PdC8ThDT with the thienyl side chain were more delocalized than those of POD and PODDT. This difference could be ascribed to the enhanced conjugation, and it was consistent with the trend of absorption spectra in Fig. 1(a and b).

Photovoltaic properties
Bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag. The copolymers were used as electron donors in the active layer, and PC71BM or ITIC was used as the electron acceptor. A thin layer of water and alcohol soluble poly[(9,9-bis(3-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide (PFN-Br) was used as an effective electron extraction layer because it can improve the electron extraction properties with the additional benefit of enhanced device stability.50,51 The processing conditions, including D:A weight ratios, processing solvent, additive, and active layer thickness, were systematically optimized to achieve the optimal photovoltaic performance (Tables S1–S4, ESI†). Via repeated optimization of the processing conditions, the optimal copolymer:PC71BM ratio was obtained as 1:1.5 (w/w), the thin films of the active layers were spin-coated from chlorobenzene solution with 3 vol% 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) as the processing additive to optimize the morphology, and the film thickness was found to be around 95 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the performance of the devices under illumination at AM 1.5G and 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4a and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2, respectively. An optimal PCE of 7.76% was obtained with a VOC of 0.89 V, a current density–voltage (JSC) of 11.76, and a fill factor (FF) of 74.18% based on the PdC8ThDT:PC71BM devices. The great difference in efficiency was due to the disparity in the short-circuit current and the fill factor among the devices, which could be confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve (Fig. 3c). The devices based on the Knoevenagel-derived copolymer exhibit remarkably similar photovoltaic performances to its Stille counterpart PdC8ThDT-S. By comparison of the photovoltaic data in Table 2, the same VOC values were obtained in the two devices, consistent with the HOMO and LUMO levels measured by CV. All devices exhibited broad response ranges from 300 to 700 nm, and the device based on PdC8ThDT showed the highest EQE. The higher short-circuit current and EQE response range could be attributed to the higher absorption coefficient of PdC8ThDT, and more solar photons might be harvested. It should be noted that the integral current densities obtained from the EQE measurements are consistent with the results obtained from the J–V measurements.

Because of the weak absorption of fullerenes in the visible spectral region, the non-fullerene small molecule acceptor ITIC was adopted as the acceptor material to broaden the absorption spectra and the EQE response range and to thus improve the PCE of the PSC device. PdC8ThDT was selected for non-fullerene systems because of its outstanding optical and electrical properties. The low-bandgap acceptor ITIC was chosen as the electron acceptor due to the strong absorption between 700 nm and 800 nm, which could be beneficial for light harvesting in the long-wavelength region. The EQE of the devices based on ITIC was effectively extended to 800 nm because of the matched absorption spectra of PdC8ThDT and ITIC. For comparison, we also compared the device performance of the copolymer to that of PdC8ThDT-S obtained by Stille polymerization. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the performance of the devices under illumination at AM 1.5G and 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3b and Table 3, respectively. The maximum PCEs were obtained with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:ITIC/PFN-Br/Ag. The active layers were prepared by spin-coating the copolymer:ITIC (1:1.5, w/w) blend solution with a total blend concentration of 8 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene without any post-processing conditions. The PCE of 8.54%, with a VOC of 0.97 V, a JSC of 15.63 mA cm−2, and a FF of 56.12% for PdC8ThDT, was slightly higher than that of 8.12% for PdC8ThDT-S. The higher JSC based on the PdC8ThDT:ITIC device was primarily ascribed to the higher absorption coefficient, meaning that more solar photons could be absorbed (Fig. S13, ESI†). The PdC8ThDT-S:ITIC blend films have better morphology and a more appropriate domain size, which is desired for better charge separation and improved FF.52–54 This indicates that the copolymers obtained by Knovenagel polycondensation are suitable for use in organic solar cells and will not require a sacrifice of PCE.

The hole mobility of the blend films was examined by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method in hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al (Table 2 and Fig. S16, ESI†). The mobility was determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single-carrier SCLC, which is described by the following equation: , where J is the current, μ0 is the carrier mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage, and V = Vappl − Vbi − Vs, where Vappl is the voltage applied to the device, Vbi is the built-in voltage and Vs is the voltage drop from the substrate's series resistance. The carrier mobility can be calculated from the slope of the J–V curves (Fig. S16, ESI†), and the related results are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 shows that the calculated hole mobilities of the blend films were calculated to be 6.03 × 10−6, 2.60 × 10−4, 1.21 × 10−5, and 4.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for POD:PC71BM, PODDT:PC71BM, PdC8Th:PC71BM, and PdC8ThDT:PC71BM, respectively. The hole mobilities of PODDT:PC71BM and PdC8ThDT:PC71BM, which are about one or two orders of magnitude higher than those of the other blend films, respectively, can be attributed to the introduction of thiophene bridging groups on both sides of the BDT, which significantly enhanced the conjugation and planarity of the backbone. The calculated hole mobility was 4.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PdC8ThDT:PC71BM, which is the highest among the four blend films. More efficient generation and transport of charge carriers are seen in PdC8ThDT:PC71BM than in the other blend films, which is advantageous in obtaining a higher short-circuit current, thus resulting in greater efficiency. The hole mobilities of the blend film based on the non-fullerene system were also measured using the SCLC method in hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:ITIC/MoO3/Al and the calculated hole mobilities were found to be 7.10 × 10−4 and 6.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PdC8ThDT:ITIC and PdC8ThDT-S:ITIC, respectively (Table 3). The hole mobilities of the two blend films are also similar, which is consistent with the trend of PSC device performance.
Charge transfer and extraction
The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pure copolymer films and the blend films were recorded to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge transfer at the interface of the copolymers and PC71BM or the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC. The blend films were composed of the copolymer and PC71BM or ITIC in the optimal proportion. Fig. S15 in the ESI† shows the PL spectra of the pure films and the blends excited at 600 nm. The PL emission peak of the copolymers appears between 600 and 850 nm centered at 670 nm. PL quenching efficiencies of more than 95% were achieved for all blend films, which indicates that efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer occurred in the active layer. To further investigate the effects of various structures on the performance of the devices based on copolymer:PC71BM, transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were used to probe the differences in the charge carrier recombination of the solar cell devices. The measurements were carried out at 0 bias, and the relevant characteristics are shown in Fig. 5. The charge extraction times were 0.40, 0.27, 0.23, and 0.12 μs for the devices based on POD:PC71BM, PODDT:PC71BM, PdC8Th:PC71BM, and PdC8ThDT:PC71BM, respectively. The charge extraction time of the device based on PdC8ThDT:PC71BM was slightly faster, indicating more efficient charge extraction from the photoactive layer, which can be interpreted as greater charge carrier mobility and corresponding device performance.

Morphology characterization
To understand the main differences in the performances of the devices with copolymers of various chemical structures, we analyzed the morphological properties of the active layers using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the morphology of the PdC8Th:ITIC blend film was also characterized to study the compatibility of PdC8ThDT with the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC. As shown in Fig. 6, the root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of the POD:PC71BM, PODDT:PC71BM, PdC8Th:PC71BM and PdC8ThDT:PC71BM blend films was 1.80, 2.70, 1.97, and 1.19 nm, respectively. Among them, the lowest roughness with the smallest domain sizes was seen in the PdC8ThDT:PC71BM blend film, indicating the formation of a uniform separation structure, which was consistent with the results obtained from the TEM images. All blend films showed fibrillar network features, whereas the blend film based on PdC8ThDT:PC71BM showed the most uniform separation structure without obvious large bright and dark domains. For PdC8ThDT:ITIC, both AFM and TEM showed good compatibility between PdC8Th and ITIC, and a uniform BHJ phase separation structure with an Rq of 1.08 nm was obtained. The results of active layer morphology were consistent with the performance of the PSC devices, as described above. The blend films based on PdC8ThDT exhibited the best BHJ phase separation structure, which could increase the exciton separation and charge transport capacities and thus improve JSC, FF and the corresponding PCE.

Conclusions
A series of copolymers based on BDT and cyanovinylene moieties was designed and synthesized by Knoevenagel polymerization. Alkoxy and two-dimensional conjugated octyl-substituted thienyl side chains were used to investigate the effects of side chains on the properties of the polymer. The results show that the two-dimensional conjugated octyl-substituted thienyl side chain will broaden the absorption and it is conducive to an improvement in electron mobility. The introduction of thiophene as a π-bridge in the main chain greatly enhanced the SCLC hole mobility of the device, and among them, the devices based on PdC8ThDT:PC71BM and PdC8ThDT:ITIC showed SCLC hole mobilities of 4.42 × 10−4 and 7.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The corresponding device efficiency of PdC8ThDT:PC71BM was found to be 7.76%, with a high FF of 74.18. When the acceptor was replaced by a non-fullerene acceptor (ITIC), the PCE increased to 8.54% with an elevated VOC and JSC were obtained as a result of the matching absorption spectrum and energy levels between the donor and the acceptor. To verify the reliability of the polymerization method, we compared the device performance of the copolymer PdC8ThDT with that of the copolymer PdC8ThDT-S prepared by Stille polymerization, to prove that there was no obvious difference. Through this work, we propose the use of the more environmentally friendly Knoevenagel polycondensation to produce highly efficient conjugated polymers for OPV devices, and the feasibility of this method was confirmed. However, to obtain more efficient polymers, it is necessary to conduct more in-depth research on molecular engineering.
