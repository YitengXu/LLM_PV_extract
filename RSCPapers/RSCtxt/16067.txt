    , Accepted 2nd July 2020First published on 3rd July 2020AbstractIn this study, we report on the development of triboelectric energy generators (TEGs) made of porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and bacterial cellulose (BC) layers and their demonstration as a self-powered sensor for remote security applications. PVDF films are fabricated by room temperature solution casting at different relative humidity (RH) with denser, stronger, and transparent PVDF films obtained at lower relative humidity. Among all the PVDF film based TEGs, the triboelectric generator (TEG) made of the film prepared at a low relative humidity of 10% (PVDF10) shows the highest voltage, current and power density of 410 V, 14.8 μA (current density: 0.57 μA cm−2) and 3.5 mW, respectively and a maximum power density of 0.136 mW cm−2 at 33 MΩ. Enhancement in the value of power density is almost three-fold as compared to that of the PVDF film cast at a high relative humidity of 54% (PVDF54). The high output response of the PVDF10 based TEG is attributed to the rough surface, higher γ-phase fraction, and high dielectric constant of the PVDF10 film. Finally, the potential of a TEG device for practical application in biomechanical energy harvesting is demonstrated by lighting up more than 100 light-emitting diodes using a low-frequency foot strike as a mechanical stimulus along with lighting up of a 5-bit 7 segment LCD display. The device was also used as a self-powered motion sensor for application in wireless security, which could be practically realistic. Overall, the study demonstrates the possible applications of PVDF thin film based TEG devices, which can be fabricated using an easy, room temperature, and environment-friendly processing method.
1. Introduction
Clean and green energy is critical for sustainable development leading to better human health and for environmental protection.1 As a result, immense emphasis is placed on generating energy from renewable sources such as solar energy, wind energy, hydro energy, tidal energy, and so on. While these energy sources are generally useful for large scale energy generation, harvesting stray mechanical, thermal and magnetic energy from various sources around us including human activities is also an exciting area of research that could especially be useful for powering low-power devices and for charging of batteries and this power can really be on-demand and be available instantaneously. Among them, mechanical energy harvesting utilizes the phenomenon of piezoelectricity and triboelectrification, and one can fabricate miniature or small area energy harvesting devices to generate electricity on demand. Among the two, triboelectric effect based energy generators have gained immense interest due to their higher energy conversion efficiency using simple and robust structures based on low-cost materials.2 These generators use the combined effect of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction.3–6 Triboelectrification includes generation of electric charges with opposite polarity on the surfaces of two different materials when brought into contact via mechanical force.7–9 The position of the two materials in the triboelectric series governs the amount of triboelectric surface charges that develop on each layer and plays an important role in materials selection. For an efficient device, the two materials should be as far as possible in the series. With continuous contact and separation of both materials, induced triboelectric charges flow back and forth in the external circuit. Factors that affect the performance of a triboelectric generator (TEG) are dielectric constants of the two layers, their surface roughness and surface charge density.10–12
The use of TEGs in practical applications with high conversion efficiency requires a triboelectric layer with a rough surface and high surface charge density, which should be fabricated with ease using a low thermal budget process. Reported experimental studies primarily focus on electro-spun polymeric nanofibrous structures and films of ferroelectric PVDF and its copolymers with high surface roughness as outlined in Table S1.†13–16 In PVDF based systems, electrospinning promotes the formation of an electroactive β-phase with high surface charge density.17 However, electrospinning is a complex technique, could be expensive, and an electrospun fibrous mat may not be mechanically very stable for practical applications.17 Therefore, it is desirable to develop an easy and simple fabrication technique to prepare mechanically robust, porous PVDF films with a rough surface and with a higher proportion of electroactive β and γ phases. In the case of solution casting, the most popular solvent for the preparation of PVDF films is dimethylformamide (DMF),18,19 which is a polar solvent but is toxic, and its use is banned in several countries.20 An alternative could be the use of acetone as acetone derived films demonstrate formation of films with a porous structure and electroactive phases. However, the lack of mechanical strength in such films limits the device's working life.17 Therefore, solution casting of PVDF using acetone as a solvent requires interventions that provide the films with desired physical and functional properties. To achieve this, one needs to tune the parameters such as drying temperature, solvent vapor pressure, relative humidity etc., which could have an impact on the final microstructure of the solution cast films.21
In this manuscript, we report an environment-friendly and simple solution casting-based approach for the preparation of PVDF films using acetone as the primary solvent whilst reducing the DMF use significantly. We demonstrate the formation of the electroactive phase even with a lower amount of DMF. In addition, we show the role of relative humidity conditions during drying in controlling the transparency, mechanical strength, and polar phase formation of PVDF films. This PVDF film is used as a negative triboelectric layer to fabricate high-performance, robust TEG devices. We demonstrate that an enhancement in the contact surface area, electroactive γ-phase formation, and dielectric constant of the PVDF film dramatically increases the output performance of TEGs. Our study used raw bacterial cellulose as a positive triboelectric material, which is a more eco-friendly material than paper i.e. wood cellulose,22–28 is non-toxic and recyclable and is easy to synthesize in a laboratory. There are a few reports on using processed nanoparticles of bacterial cellulose as a triboelectric material produced after acid hydrolysis.29,30 Its raw form has not yet been explored for device applications, which is one of the objectives of the present work.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of PVDF films as a negative triboelectric layer
PVDF powder with Mw ∼ 530000 Da was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The PVDF powder was dissolved in 90% acetone and 10% DMF to obtain a 5 wt% PVDF solution. The solution was first ultra-sonicated for 30 minutes and then kept in a water bath at 60 °C for one hour to completely dissolve the polymer. PVDF films were prepared by solution casting the polymer solution onto a glass substrate and were dried at room temperature. To prepare the films of different morphologies, drying was performed in a closed chamber with a controlled relative humidity (RH). The dried films were left undisturbed for two days under the same ambient conditions before peeling them out from the glass substrate. Concentrated salt solutions and silica gel were used to maintain the humidity inside the chamber. At room temperature, saturated salt solutions of MgCl2 and MgNO3 in water were used to obtain a RH of 33% and 54%, while silica gel was used to maintain a RH of 10% (Table S2†). During solvent evaporation, RH was controlled within ±1%. The PVDF films prepared at 10%, 33%, and 54% RH were denoted as PVDF10, PVDF33, and PVDF54, respectively.
2.2. Preparation of the bacterial cellulose film as a positive triboelectric layer
Bacterial cellulose (BC) was synthesized under static conditions by incubating the bacterial species called Gluconacetobacter xylinus (ATCC 700178) in a rich saccharide medium (2% glucose, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.115% citric acid, 0.27% disodium hydrogen phosphate and 1% ethanol in water) at around 37 °C. Multiple pellicles were grown in the culture for around 2–3 weeks by submerging the bacterial cellulose. Details of the process of growth of bacterial cellulose pellicles can be found elsewhere.31 The pellicles were washed twice in boiling water for an hour each. For further removal of bacterial cells and media ingredients, the pellicles were treated with 0.2 M NaOH at 90 °C for an hour. The NaOH treated bacterial cellulose pellicles were washed with DI water until neutral pH was obtained. The pellicles of bacterial cellulose were first cut into small pieces followed by further grinding them for around 1 h in steps using a mixer, leading to thick homogeneous slurry of bacterial cellulose in DI water (5.3 mg mL−1).
2.3. TEG device preparation
Bacterial cellulose slurry (7 mL) was poured onto aluminium tape attached to an acrylic sheet and was oven-dried at 50 °C for 6 h. This bacterial cellulose film was used as a positive triboelectric layer, while PVDF films of different morphologies prepared at varying RH were used as negative triboelectric layers with aluminium tape as an electrode. Peeled PVDF films were first stuck to aluminium tape acting as an electrode. The same side was supported further on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet using double-sided tape while the other side of the PVDF surface faced toward the bacterial cellulose film. Attaching a PET sheet to the device ensures robustness and thus a proper contact between the triboelectric layers. A spacer width of 8 mm was maintained between the PET and acrylic sheet ensuring separation between the layers. The step by step schematic representation of the device fabrication is shown in Fig. 1. The fabricated devices had an active area of 25 cm2.

2.4. Film and device characterization
The surface morphology of PVDF and bacterial cellulose films was examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss Sigma VP, Carl Zeiss, USA). To analyze the fibrous structure of raw bacterial cellulose, a freeze-dried bacterial cellulose film was used. For this, bacterial cellulose in the form of pellicles was kept at −80 °C for 24 h followed by drying inside a freeze dryer (Labconco FreeZone Plus 2.5 L Benchtop Freeze-Dry System) at −80 °C for 72 h. Prior to microscopy, the samples were gold coated using a Quorum SC 7627 mini sputter coater (QUORUM Technologies Limited, UK). Structural and chemical characterization of the films was performed using X-ray diffraction (Panalytical MRD Pro X-ray Diffractometer) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum (10.03.06) in the frequency range from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1, respectively. The transmittance of PVDF films was obtained using an Evolution 201 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). The mechanical properties such as tensile strength (TS) and % elongation (E) of the PVDF films were investigated using a universal testing machine (Instron-3365, Instron India Pvt. Ltd., India) with pneumatic grips (Instron 2712-002) and a 5 kN load cell. Tensile samples were prepared as per ASTM standard D882 in a rectangular shape, with a gauge length and width of 5 cm and 1 cm, respectively. The tests were carried out at room temperature, a RH of ca. 50%, and a crosshead speed of 1 mm min−1. A scanning probe microscope (Asylum Research, Model: MFP-3D) was used for conducting Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) on the samples.
Dielectric measurements were performed using an Alpha-A high-performance frequency analyzer (Novocontrol, Germany). The measurements were performed at RT with an applied voltage of 1 Vrms and over a frequency range between 10−2 Hz and 106 Hz. Aluminum contacts of a 20 mm diameter were thermally evaporated for carrying out the measurements. The output open-circuit voltage of the TEG devices in response to the biomechanical motion in the form of finger tapping was measured by using a digital oscilloscope (Tektronics DPO4102B-L). Device output currents across loads were measured using an electrometer (Keithley 6517B).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of thin PVDF films

Fig. 2a shows the photographs of the films prepared under different conditions. The films prepared at a 54% RH are opaque in appearance, whereas the films prepared at a 10% RH are relatively transparent. The UV-Vis spectra of the films, as shown in Fig. 2b, clearly demonstrate that the PVDF54 film is opaque with negligible transmittance while the transmittance increases in the films prepared at lower RH, with the transmittance of the PVDF10 film more than twice that of the PVDF33 sample over an entire wavelength range. This variation in the transparency of the films is related to the porosity of the films, as shown by the FESEM micrographs of the PVDF films (Fig. 2c). As compared to the other two samples, PVDF54 films exhibit a large number of big pores throughout the matrix, which cause light scattering hence making them opaque. However, upon reducing the relative humidity, the number and the size of pores reduce significantly.

A decrease in the film porosity also results in stronger films, as shown in Fig. 2d with PVDF10 and PVDF33 samples exhibiting similar tensile strengths, which are more than five times higher than that of PVDF54. Compared to the best-reported value of ∼40 MPa, the samples prepared at lower humidity show a maximum tensile strength of ∼30 MPa, which could be due to the presence of some porosity in the films.32 However, a certain level of porosity is believed to be desirable for energy harvesting applications.10 In addition, PVDF10 and PVDF33 also exhibit higher elongation, are mechanically robust, and have rougher surfaces making them better suited as a negative triboelectric material for TEG devices.
3.2. Bacterial cellulose films

Fig. 3a shows the growth of multiple bacterial cellulose pellicles in media for over 2 months. Freestanding never-dried bacterial cellulose pellicles, as shown in Fig. 3b are flexible and easy to handle. The FESEM image of freeze-dried bacterial cellulose shows a random web-like fibrous structure of cellulose nanofibrils (Fig. 3c). The pellicles are ground using a mixer to form bacterial cellulose slurry, as shown in Fig. 3d followed by casting into paper-like flexible films (Fig. 3e). BC has excellent film-forming ability due to the formation of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl groups of nanofibrils of bacterial cellulose.33 The FESEM image of the solution cast BC film shows collapsed pores due to slow drying of films (Fig. 3f). The characteristic peaks of the BC film are shown in the XRD pattern (Fig. 3g), which confirms that the prepared film has a pure phase.34 The bacterial cellulose film surface is shown to have positive surface potential in the KPFM image of the film surface (Fig. 3h). Therefore, bacterial cellulose films can be used as a positive triboelectric material against PVDF (the negative triboelectric material) for the preparation of a triboelectric generator.

3.3. Effect of film preparation conditions on the performance of the TEG
We fabricated three different TEGs with PVDF10, PVDF33, and PVDF54 samples, with PVDF on top and BC at the bottom. A schematic of the power generation mechanism of a TEG device is shown in Fig. S1.† The output voltages produced by these TEGs, shown in Fig. 4a, substantially increase from 220 V to 390 V to 410 V for PVDF54, PVDF33, and PVDF10 samples, respectively demonstrating the effect of RH during drying of films on the output voltage. Similarly, the output current of the TEG device increases up to a maximum of 14.8 μA for the PVDF10 sample dried at the lowest RH, as shown in Fig. 4b. Since 10% RH is the minimum value we could achieve under ambient conditions, we also prepared PVDF films inside a nitrogen-filled glove box with a moisture level of <5 ppm, depicted as PVDF-N. Fig. S2† depicts an insignificant change in the output performance of TEG devices formed using PVDF10 and PVDF-N films. Since the performance of devices fabricated with films dried at 10% RH is as good as those dried in the glove box, the devices can be fabricated outside the glove box. Next, the change in the output voltage and current density with load resistance varying from 10 kΩ to 100 MΩ was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 4c for all the TEGs. The results show that the change in the output voltage for each TEG is gradual until 1 MΩ, beyond which the output voltage decreases sharply. In contrast, the output current density of all the devices tends to increase with increasing load resistance up to 33 MΩ and then remains constant and the maximum obtained current density is 0.57 μA cm−2 for the PVDF10 device. The estimated output power of all the devices is plotted against the external load, as shown in Fig. 4d. The power output of all the devices increases up to a particular load value before starting to decrease with the PVDF10 device exhibiting maximum power output over the entire range. A maximum power output of 1.3 mW at 3 MΩ is observed for the PVDF54 device, compared to 3.5 mW, nearly 3-times higher, at 33 MΩ for the PVDF10 device with a maximum power density of 0.136 mW cm−2. The internal resistance of any device is maximum when the external impedance matches the internal impedance of the device. Therefore, the internal impedance of the PVDF54 device is 3 MΩ compared to the 33 MΩ of the PVDF10 device. This increase in the internal impedance of the PVDF10 device can be related to dielectric characteristics. The data suggest that PVDF10 films should possess a higher dielectric constant as compared to PVDF54 films.

(d) Variation of power with external load for all PVDF based TEG devices with maxima varying between 3 and 33 MΩ for PVDF54/BC and PVDF10/BC devices, respectively. 
The low output performance of the TEG devices with the PVDF film prepared at high relative humidity is primarily attributed to the film porosity of PVDF54. As Fig. 2c shows, the PVDF54 film has big pores of the size of the order of tens of microns as compared to the PVDF10 film which has finer pores resulting in the lower contact area between the surfaces of PVDF54 and BC.10 However, the devices with PVDF33 and PVDF10 show higher output due to the higher fraction of the electroactive crystalline phase in PVDF films and the higher dielectric constant. When two surfaces are brought into contact with each other, the generated surface charge is also related to the crystalline phase of ferroelectric PVDF. PVDF crystals exist in five different phases depending upon their chain conformation: (i) β-phase with the all-trans (TTTT) conformation, (ii) α- and (iii) δ-phases with alternate trans–gauche (TGTG′) conformations and (iv) γ- and (v) ε-phases with the T3GT3G′ conformation.35–37 The dipole moments in PVDF add up in the case of β-, γ- and δ-phases but get cancelled for α- and ε-phases leading to high remnant polarization and hence high surface charge density for the β-, γ- and δ-phases of PVDF. The XRD and FTIR spectra of the PVDF films cast at different RH are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a shows that all the films contain crystalline peaks at 2θ values of 18.6°, 20.2° and 39.4° indicating a mixture of α- and γ-polymorph structures. For PVDF10, however, the peak at 20.2° is shifted to 20.5°. The peak at 18.6° corresponds to both the α-phase and γ-phase of PVDF and the peak at 39.4° corresponds to only the α-phase of PVDF. These peaks correspond to (020) and (002) crystal planes.38,39 The peak at 20.2° corresponds to the (110) plane of the γ-phase.38 However, XRD is not sufficient to discern between the β- and γ-phase of PVDF as three diffraction peaks of γ-PVDF could also be easily assigned to the β-phase. The overlap between the peaks or their proximity could lead to erroneous identification of phases present in the PVDF film, especially between β- and γ-crystalline phases. The peak at a 2θ value of 20.2° mostly designated as the (110) and (200) plane of the β-phase can also be the (110) plane of the γ-phase.40 In different studies, only the existence of the α–phase and β-phase is discussed with very little or no attention to that of the γ-phase.38 The films contain a certain amount of both α- and γ-phases of PVDF when DMF, a polar solvent is used along with acetone.40

While the XRD data do indicate the presence of the γ-phase, room temperature Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of films prepared under different humidity conditions (Fig. 5b) was conducted. FTIR spectroscopy is used to determine the absorption peaks in the material and those determined from PVDF samples are shown in Table S3.†41–43 The FTIR spectra show absorption characteristic bands for both polar and nonpolar phases, and from Table S3,† it is clear that while the characteristic bands of non-polar α-PVDF lie at 532, 614, 763, 796, 855 and 976 cm−1,41,43,44 the peaks at 512, 776, 812, 837 and 883 cm−1 in the spectra correspond to γ-PVDF (Table S3†).21,42 The band at 614 cm−1 corresponding to the α-phase, does not appear as a prominent peak but appears as a shoulder only. With decreasing relative humidity, the signature peaks of the α-phase at 614 and 763 cm−1, almost disappear while the characteristic bands of the γ-phase remain for all the films, showing the existence and dominance of the γ-phase over the α-phase. This is attributed to the nature of the solvent used for the solvation of PVDF, which promotes the formation of the electro-active γ-phase in all the films. Use of polar solvents, acetone with a dipole moment of 2.88 and DMF with a dipole moment of 3.82, is responsible for the formation of the γ-phase because of the dipolar interactions between the polar groups present in the solvent and the dipoles of the –CF bond in PVDF at low drying temperature.45
The schematic of dipolar intermolecular interactions between PVDF and DMF is shown in Fig. 5c. At low drying temperature, the dipoles of DMF tend to rotate the dipoles of the –CF bond around the carbon backbone chain of PVDF. Therefore, this interaction reduces the energy barrier for the rotation of a strong –CF bond, leading to the formation of the TTTGTTTG′ conformation (γ-phase). On the other hand, alternate trans and gauche conformations (α-phase) are favored when solvents with lower dipole moment are used.21,45 The polar γ-phase formation tends to decrease with an increase in the humidity. The effect of the vapor phase of water in the ambient atmosphere on the phase formation of PVDF is not evident in previous studies. This could be due to hydrogen bond formation between the water molecules near the surface and DMF at high humidity, due to the high miscibility of water in DMF.46 Hydrogen bond formation limits the interaction of DMF with the dipole of PVDF, resulting in the formation of the alternate trans and gauche conformation (non-polar α-phase). Moreover, the dipole moment of water (1.8) is high enough to rotate the dipoles of the –CF bond in PVDF. A schematic view of hydrogen bond formation resulting in the α-phase of PVDF is shown in Fig. 5d. Hence, controlling humidity is a phase changing process from the non-polar α-phase to the polar γ-phase. Therefore, PVDF films formed at a low relative humidity of 10% consist of a higher γ-phase fraction and hence higher surface charge density is expected, which increases the device output performance of the PVDF10/BC TEG as compared to that of PVDF54/BC TEG.
Another factor that can contribute to the TEG performance is the dielectric constant of the PVDF film. The voltage of the triboelectric generator based on a dielectric-to-dielectric model can be expressed as:47 (1)where σ, ε0 and x(t) are surface triboelectric charge density, vacuum permittivity, and distance between the layers, respectively. Δσ, d and εr are the transfer charge density, thickness, and relative permittivity of the dielectric layers. Since charge transfer under open circuit conditions is zero, the open-circuit voltage is: (2)
For a parallel plate capacitor, surface charge density (σ) is equal to the displacement field (D) and can be expressed as:10 (3)where E and A are the electric field and surface area of the dielectric material, respectively. Hence, one can see that the Voc of the device is likely to increase when the εr of the triboelectric material increases.10Fig. 5c shows variation in the dielectric constant of PVDF10, PVDF33, and PVDF54 samples in the frequency range of 10−2 to 107 Hz. The plateau between low and high-frequency relaxations suggests that the dielectric constant of PVDF10 is higher than that of other samples and contributes to the higher Voc of these devices. The increase in the dielectric constant of the PVDF film prepared at low relative humidity is related to enhanced electroactive γ-phase formation and reduced film porosity which are manifested in higher surface charge density due to higher polarization and is also supported by a previous study reporting similar observations.48 In summary, the above results based on the contact surface area, crystalline phase enhancement, and dielectric characteristics are consistent with the improved performance of the TEG prepared using PVDF10 prepared at low RH. The output performance of our device is compared with those of devices reported in the literature, as shown in Table S1,† and the results are found to be higher than most of them.
3.4. Effect of frequency on device performance and its stability
We measured the output voltage characteristics of the PVDF10 based TEG at various contact separation frequencies between 0.9 Hz and 5.2 Hz and the results are shown in Fig. 6a. The figure shows that after an initial increase from ∼320 V at 0.9 Hz to ∼410 V at 2.6 Hz, the output voltage saturates at higher frequencies, in agreement with previous reports on nano-TEG devices using graphene, PEDOT:PSS and BCZT-PVDF-HEP composites as electrodes.49–53 However, there are other studies which have reported contradictory results such as those reporting a maximum in the output voltage at a certain frequency54–57 as well those showing a monotonous increase with frequency.58–61 While decrease in the voltage at higher frequencies could perhaps be attributed to reduced time of contact and hence insufficient time for full surface charge generation, monotonic increase seen in other reports cannot be explained. However, since most of the studies remain limited to a narrow frequency range with a maximum of up to 10 Hz, what happens at higher frequencies and load remains to be studied.

(b) Variation of the open-circuit output voltage of the PVDF10/BC TEG device upon storing at different relative humidity levels between 34% and 95% for 1 week. (c) Durability and consistency of the PVDF10/BC TEG. (d) The output voltage of the PVDF10/BC device on day 1 and after 3 months, showing the stability and consistency of the device over a long time period. 
These multitude of observations clearly suggest a lack of microscopic understanding of Voc dependence on the frequency, especially when eqn (2) does not suggest any frequency dependence of Voc. It is plausible that there is an indirect relation between the voltage and the frequency which could be further related to the surface charge density, for example the rate at which surface charges are transferred from one material to another during triboelectrification.60 The triboelectrification process involves charge transfer across two surfaces via formation of a bond due to overlap between the electron clouds of the atoms on the two sides.62 Due to contact, the single potential wells convert into asymmetric double potential-wells causing transfer of electrons from one side to another. This process could be time dependent and hence the voltage may depend on the rate at which the materials are bought into contact with one another and removed. However, for a better understanding, this phenomenon requires detailed experimentation in a wide range of frequencies and loads complemented by appropriate modelling.
In the case of varying spacer width, the output voltage tends to decrease with a decrease in the spacer thickness (Fig. S3†). Ambient humidity during operation is an important parameter that significantly affects the performance of the device. Studies suggest that an increase in the RH during device operation causes a reduction in the charge generation efficiency of the device, causing deterioration in the device output.53 Moreover, bacterial cellulose is hydrophilic in nature due to the presence of –OH groups at its surface.33 Therefore, it is necessary to study the device behavior operated at varying humidity levels. Fig. 6b shows the output open-circuit voltage of the best-performing PVDF10 based TEG at 5.2 Hz frequency and 8 mm spacer width kept under specific RH conditions for a week. The output voltage of the device decreases from 410 V to 250 V, a decrease of 39%, when RH increases from 34% to 95% with major changes occurring after a RH of 53%, which is typical RH maintained in an air-conditioned room. The decrease in the output voltage at high ambient RH is possibly due to the hydrophilic nature of BC that may increase the mobility of charges along the surface and across the bacterial cellulose film thickness. This indicates that the TEG is not suitable for operating under high humidity conditions. Therefore, for usage at high relative humidity, tight sealed packaging of TEG devices is required to avoid direct contact with the moisture.
Further, the output voltage of the PVDF10 based TEG is measured at a contact frequency of ∼4 Hz for over 4000 cycles to investigate its long-term operation ability and Fig. 6c shows that the TEG output remains stable without any failure in operation. This implies that both electrodes and triboelectric materials have excellent stability and reliability. TEG stability is further evaluated by storing the device under ambient conditions for a duration of 3 months and Fig. 6d shows that the output voltage of the TEG remains consistent on day one and after 3 months of storage, suggesting excellent stability.
3.5. Applications of TEGs
To investigate its feasibility in practical applications, a TEG was used to charge different capacitors (Fig. S4a and b†). The best performing TEG was used to light up 100+ LEDs connected in series, as shown in Fig. S5a† using a low-frequency foot strike (Video S1†). The practical application of TEGs also includes lighting up of SMD (surface mounted device) LEDs (Fig. S5a†) and a 7 segment LCD display, as shown in Fig. S5b (Video S2†). Besides being used in biomechanical energy harvesting, it was also used in sensing applications.

Self-powered motion detection security system. 
One of the application areas of TEG devices is in low power sensors such as for the Internet of Things (IoT), as listed in Table 1, which nevertheless require a source of power to operate them. Hence if the sensor is self-powered, it makes it more attractive due to lack of reliance on batteries or a power source for uninterrupted operation. We investigated the feasibility of our best performing TEG device (PVDF10/BC device) for developing a fast, robust, remotely operable and self-powered sensory system for sensing intruder transgression into an area which could make it useful for automated security system applications e.g. a wireless self-powered intruder detection system for protection against burglary. The high potential and low current response of the present sensory system along with the wireless radio-communication monitoring system make the whole system robust for use in long channel transmission.

As schematically shown in Fig. 7a, any intruder's stepping on the TEG device will result in an alternating signal whose magnitude will be determined by the applied load. The generated signal is then converted to a DC signal via a bridge rectifier. It has been found that depending upon several footsteps placed on the sensor, the equivalent DC signals generated were of the magnitude between 4 V and 20 V, although the maximum permissible analog input voltage for the microcontroller was 5 V. For this reason, a simple voltage divider circuit with a resistance ratio of 3:1 has been chosen (R1 & R2 in Fig. 7a). The optimum values of R1 and R2 were 1500 kΩ and 500 kΩ respectively for the optimum power output. Based upon this input signal, an embedded code was developed following the flowchart shown in Fig. S6a.† Initially a command signal is generated for connection of the GSM module to the network. If the connection is established, the TEG sensor output is read through an analog input pin of the microcontroller unit (Arduino UNO R3 MCU). A logic condition is seeded in such a way that if the sensor output falls in between a lower voltage (Vlow) and higher voltage (Vhigh) then a GSM AT command is generated for sending an SMS to a specified mobile number. This signal through DC conversion and proper conditioning is transmitted to the microcontroller. Then, a control signal is generated by the microcontroller to the GSM module to send a message on a specified mobile number. The complete procedure followed according to the block diagram is shown in Fig. S6b.† The photographic image of the complete setup is shown in Fig. 7b, which demonstrates that when someone steps on the triboelectric self-powered sensor, it delivers an alarm in the form of an SMS (Fig. 7c) to the mobile phone using a microcontroller and GSM module (Video S3†). All the test results demonstrate a novel self-powered intruder detection system that is very sensitive, remotely operable, and monitorable with a faster response.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a novel method to control the surface and bulk properties of PVDF films by solution casting and have investigated the dependence of the properties on relative humidity. PVDF films were prepared by a fast, easy, heat-free, and environment-friendly process and acetone was used as the main solvent used whilst minimizing the use of DMF, a commonly used yet toxic solvent. PVDF films were tuned to exhibit excellent flexibility, elasticity, and tensile strength. These PVDF films were then used as an efficient dielectric material for triboelectric energy harvesting due to their desirable static and mechanical properties. The TEG devices were made by using a paper-like positive triboelectric material made of bacterial cellulose, which is a biodegradable and environment-friendly material. The TEG devices made of the PVDF film prepared at a low humidity level of 10% showed high open-circuit voltage and short circuit current of about 410 V and 14.8 μA (current density: 0.57 μA cm−2), respectively, with a maximum power of 3.5 mW, ∼3 times higher than that of the film prepared at 54% RH. The maximum power density for PVDF10 is 0.136 mW cm−2. This PVDF10/BC TEG can harvest biomechanical motion, such as by foot stepping, and the generated electricity can be used in lighting up of multiple LEDs for pedestrians in the case of emergency. This device was demonstrated for application as a self-powered motion sensor and can be used as an intruder alarm system. The work demonstrated a novel method to enhance the performance of a TEG device by tuning the properties of PVDF films in an environment-friendly manner and its applications.
