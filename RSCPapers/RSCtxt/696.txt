    , Accepted 30th August 2019First published on 30th August 2019AbstractTransparent conductive electrodes are key to flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) to achieve remarkable performance. Herein, flexible OSCs are fabricated using graphene and Ag nanowire (NW) composite transparent conductive films (GR&AgNWs) as an emerging electrode. The electrode exhibits extremely good optical and electrical properties. To enhance the interface contact, a thin film of highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PH1000) was used to modify the rough surface of GR&AgNWs. It also avoids work function mismatch between the electrode and interface layer. Therefore, the resultant GR&AgNWs/PH1000 hybrid electrode based non-fullerene flexible OSCs yield a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.44% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.829 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.20 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 69.82%. Besides, the devices obtain unique mechanical flexibility. It is possible to retain 84.6% of the initial PCE after bending one thousand times at a harsh bending radius (r = 2 mm), which is mainly attributed to the flexibility of the GR&AgNW electrode. This work confirms that GR&AgNW electrodes are a promising candidate to replace ITO and open an avenue to fabricate excellent performance flexible OSCs for future potential applications due to low cost and more environmental stability and friendliness of the electrode.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention due to their practical applications in portable and wearable electronics. Ideal flexible OSCs should not only satisfy the requirement of roll-to-roll and printing manufacturing with low cost, but also exhibit comparable photovoltaic performance with rigid OSCs.1–4 Currently, the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of rigid single-junction OSCs have reached up to 15.7%,5 however, those of the counterpart of flexible OSCs are only about 12.5%.6 Although the performance of flexible OSCs devices have made a great breakthrough in recent years,7–10 there are still some challenges in performance optimization of devices to achieve superb performing transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs), such as perfect ohmic contact between the electrode and the active layer. As the core components of flexible OSCs, TCEs combine two mutually exclusive attributes of transparency (effective transmission of light) and conductivity.11,12 As a typical TCE, indium tin oxide (ITO) has been widely used in various photovoltaic devices because of its high electrical conductivity, light transmittance and appropriate work function.13,14 However, the production process of ITO electrodes is costly and complex.15 The undesirable mechanical endurance due to inherent ceramic brittleness and poor adhesion on flexible substrates both hinder the wide application of ITO in flexible OSCs.16,17 Hence, various TCEs such as metal nanowires (copper, gold, silver, etc.), carbon nanotubes, graphene, and conducting polymers have been researched and reported for their good mechanical flexibility and electrical conductivity as emerging candidates to replace ITO.18–20
In recent years, the conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been extensively adopted due to its significant merits of adjustable properties and a simple solution production process.21 Previous studies have proved that the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS can be greatly enhanced by doping (dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylene glycol, etc.) or surface treatment (strong acids), to serve as an electrode for flexible OSCs.7,22–24 However, strong acids may cause damage to the substrate and environment to some extent because of corrosivity.
Moreover, high-hygroscopicity properties of PEDOT:PSS are detrimental to the stability of OSCs. Meanwhile, silver nanowires (AgNWs) demonstrate superior photoelectric properties, good solution processability, and good flexibility. In recent years, the performance of flexible OSCs based on AgNWs have made great progresses, exceeding 12% efficiency.10,25 However, there are still some problems to be solved in flexible OSCs based on AgNW electrodes, such as (1) high junction resistance because of non-welded contacts between AgNWs, (2) defects in AgNW film networks during deposition, and (3) the rough surface of AgNW electrodes resulting in large contact resistance and an extremely easy way to generate leakage current.26,27 As we know, graphene as a TCE has the advantages of high transparency, thermal and chemical stability, and stretchability.28–30 Combining graphene and AgNWs into a hybrid TCE to compensate for the disadvantages in AgNW electrodes is highly favored by researchers. It has been proved that graphene can bridge the junctions between AgNWs and also conceal the defects of AgNW networks.27,31 In this way, the high resistance of the junction and the roughness of the surface are mitigated to some extent. Surprisingly, the hybrid electrode exhibit excellent mechanical flexibility and could even be folded. And it has been found in previous research that hybrid TCEs can be successfully used in electrochromic devices, touch screens, displays, and smart wearable devices.26,27,32 Yet, using the hybrid electrode in the field of OSCs is almost rare. In fact, in terms of the advantages of performance, it is an alternative candidate in flexible OSCs.
Herein, graphene and AgNW composite flexible transparent conductive films (GR&AgNWs) purchased from Vigon technologies were used as an electrode in flexible OSCs. The bare GR&AgNW films are quite rough and have poor surface hydrophilicity. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) doped highly conductive PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) was used to planarize the uneven surface of the electrode, and excitingly, combination of the two results in a hybrid TCE with better conductivity, smoother surface, and more suitable work function (WF) than bare GR&AgNW electrodes. So, flexible non-fullerene OSC devices were fabricated with the configuration of PET/GR&AgNWs/PH1000/PEDOT:PSS (4083)/PBDB-T-2F (PM6):Y6/PDINO/Al (Fig. 2a). An ethylene glycol modified surfactant polyethylene glycol 2,5,8,11-tetramethyl-6-dodecyne-5,8-diolether (PEG-TmDD) was added to DMSO-doped PH1000 to effectively enhance the GR&AgNW surface wettability. A PM6:Y6 blend film was selected as the active layer. PEDOT:PSS (4083) and PDINO were used as the anode and cathode interfacial layers, respectively (Fig. S1†). Successfully, perfect ohmic contact between the electrode and active layer was observed, and the flexible OSCs yield a PCE of up to 13.44%. The devices also delivered favorable mechanical flexibility, and the damage of PCE was trivial (about 15% loss) after bending one thousand times at a harsh bending radius (r = 2 mm). Therefore, the photovoltaic performance and flexibility demonstrated confirm that the electrode shows substantial promise for flexible OSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Optical and electronic properties of GR&AgNW composite films

Fig. 1 shows the images of GR&AgNW films based on PET investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode. It can be observed intuitively that the AgNWs are densely dispersed and their grids are filled with graphene (Fig. 1a). The inset high-magnification SEM image shows that AgNWs are stacked loosely during deposition, and the junctions between AgNWs are not tightly connected. The AgNWs used for the electrode were about 30–40 nm in diameter and 20–30 μm in length, and therefore, the height of protruding nodes on the surface due to overlapping is at least twice the diameter, meaning larger than 60 nm. Actually, graphene infiltrated into the grid fills some gullies of AgNW networks and further ameliorates the surface roughness to a certain extent. Even so, there also exist prominent nodes on the surface (Fig. 1c). The protruding nodes probably cause non-uniform interface layers and are in direct contact with the deposited aluminum (Al) top electrode. Therefore, undesirable ohmic contact and short circuits will occur in the OSCs, which greatly affect device performance. Therefore, solving the roughness problem is crucial before device fabrication. On the whole, using a film of conductive polymers or planarized metal oxide layers is a well-founded method to flatten the surface.10,25,33 In addition, embedding GR&AgNWs into a polymer substrate such as polyimide (PI) is also an alternative method for device fabrication. Herein, the conductive polymer film of PH1000 is spin coated onto the GR&AgNWs to modify the uneven surface and thus a hybrid electrode is generated.
 Fig. 1  (a) SEM images of the GR&AgNW film. (b and c) AFM images of the topographic phase (inset), and 3D surface plot. (d) Transmittance spectra of GR&AgNWs and GR&AgNWs/PH1000 with different thicknesses (open circle) on PET and ITO reference on glass and PET (excluding the substrate). (e) Sheet resistance of the bare GR&AgNWs and GR&AgNWs with PH1000 (160 nm) modified on PET substrates at different bending times (“+” means bending concavely and “−” means bending convexly). 
Effective light transmission in the range of 300–1000 nm is a linchpin of transparent electrodes in flexible OSCs; the loss must be minimized before the active layer absorbs light. Fig. 1d shows that the transmittance of GR&AgNWs is up to 90% in the visible-infrared region, and the transmittance change is not obvious with the increase of the wavelength after reaching the peak at around 550 nm.
It exhibits a comparable or even better transmittance than the ITO on a glass substrate. In contrast, the ITO films have relatively low transmittance on PET substrates. After reaching a peak of about 83.4% at 550 nm, the transmittance drops to 63.3% at 800 nm. Poor crystallinity and high thickness of ITO on PET may lead to the decline in transmittance. Besides, the sheet resistance (Rs) of GR&AgNWs is 36 Ω □−1 as measured by the Vander Pauw four-point probe method. From the perspective of optical and electrical properties, the GR&AgNW electrode is an available TCE that is expected to be utilized as broadly as ITO. In Fig. 1d, the transmittance of hybrid electrodes with different PH1000 thicknesses can also be observed. Obviously, the transmittance of based on PH1000 composite electrodes with thickness of 90, 160 and 300 nm are 84.4%, 82.1% and 78.1%, respectively. However, the Rs of the hybrid electrodes with different thicknesses of PH1000 doesn't change significantly, and Rs is around 20 Ω □−1. The conductivity is almost equivalent to the ITO on glass rigid substrates. Spin-coating of PH1000 inevitably reduces transmittance; actually, the enhancement of electrical conductivity is able to make up for the reduced partial transmittance. Besides, the GR&AgNW electrode offers favorable flexibility. Fig. 1e illustrates the conductivity changes of GR&AgNWs/PET without or with PH1000 (160 nm) coating while bending. Evidently, the GR&AgNW electrode displays excellent mechanical flexibility. It retains high conductivity and slight increase of Rs when bending at a smaller radius of 3.5 mm concavely and convexly. A similar trend also occurred in the hybrid electrode of GR&AgNWs/PH1000, but the change of Rs is even smaller. To be precise, the hybrid electrode is more resistant to bending. It is worth mentioning that the Rs is somewhat reduced during bending. The slight decrease may be due to microscopic changes in the joint caused by corresponding pressure. Conversely, the Rs of ITO/PET rises to 80 Ω □−1 after bending just 300 times. The disappointing mechanical endurance could not fulfill the high performance of flexible OSCs. This bending resistance property of the GR&AgNW electrode has great application prospects in the flexible optoelectronic field such as foldable screens, wearable devices, etc. More importantly, it is more conducive to roll-to-roll production, achieving the advantages of low cost and more environmental friendliness. In addition, the Rs of the GR&AgNW electrode did not change substantially even when exposed to air for about 500 h, indicating that the electrode possesses remarkable environmental stability.
2.2. Performance of flexible non-fullerene OSCs based on the GR&AgNW electrode
Hence, in order to highlight the performance of the GR&AgNW electrode, we fabricated solution-processed non-fullerene flexible OSCs using the PM6:Y6 blends as a photoactive layer. The bare GR&AgNWs film and PH1000 modified composite film were used as anode electrodes respectively. The devices based on the anodes ITO/PET and ITO/glass were also fabricated as a reference. Table 1 enumerates the key performance parameters of all OSC devices. The devices were also fabricated based on AgNWs, graphene and PH1000 as the transparent electrode alone. From Table S1,† it was found that all these devices showed poor performance. The devices based on the AgNW electrode have an efficiency of only 1.27%, which was mainly attributed to the defects of AgNWs mentioned in the Introduction. Actually, the process of forming high conductivity graphene films is not mature; also the graphene formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) exhibits a low conductivity. And PH1000 has a relatively poor conductivity without doping and any film surface treatment. These properties limit the performance of flexible OSCs using these materials as electrodes. So, combining them into a hybrid electrode is an alternative way for employing them in flexible OSCs and achieves better performance. As seen from Table 1, among these flexible devices using GR&AgNWs as transparent electrodes, it could be found that without the modification of PH1000, the performance of the devices is extremely poor. For further discussion, the work function (WF) was measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). From Fig. S2,† the WF of GR&AgNWs was calculated to be only about −4.02 eV, which is not favorable to create ohmic contact with PEDOT:PSS (4083) of deep HOMO level. Besides, the surface of GR&AgNW electrodes is rough, and the protruding nodes are detrimental to interface contact. These results explain why the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of devices based on bare GR&AgNW electrodes is only about 0.659 V. What is more, the poor quality of the interface layer causes more trap-recombination and has a large impact on the current output. It also affects the morphology of the active layer to a certain extent, resulting in a lower fill factor (FF). From Fig. S3,† it can be seen that the GR&AgNW films have poor surface hydrophilicity. It is worth mentioning that in order to make the PEDOT:PSS (4083) and the electrode surface exhibit good wettability, the surfactant PEG-TmDD was added to PEDOT:PSS (4083). Actually, the addition of surfactants to the interface layer is also extremely detrimental to device performance (Table S2†). It was found that the devices based on the GR&AgNWs/PH1000 hybrid electrode achieve a relatively good performance (Fig. 2c). Clearly, a PCE of 11.55% is obtained when PH1000 has a thickness of 160 nm. The thinner PH1000 film causes the gullies of GR&AgNWs not to be completely covered and generates a poor contact with the interface layer. In this way, it results in higher leakage resistance and bad performance of devices. In turn, when it is excessively thick, the light absorbed by the active layer reduces sharply. In this way, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) decreases to 19.95 mA cm−2 and the PCE is only 10.64%. Therefore, the thickness of PH1000 is selected to be 160 nm and optimized on this basis. A noteworthy phenomenon is that the Voc of devices increases based on the hybrid electrode compared to the bare electrode of GR&AgNWs, which means that the PH1000 layer is capable of solving the problem of WF mismatch between the electrode and interface layer. Yet, the Voc is still far lower than that of the rigid devices. For bulk heterojunction OSCs, the Voc is largely contingent on the donor's HOMO and the acceptor's LUMO; the Voc is also affected by the interface dipole strongly.34–36 So, it was inferred that the quality of the interface layer may be a key factor affecting the Voc. The surface morphology of the interface layer was detected by AFM in tapping mode to verify this conjecture. Fig. 3b shows that the spin-on interface layer is rough, making it difficult to achieve good ohmic contact with active layers. Even though the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS (4083) was adjusted during the optimization process, the Voc has not been significantly improved (Table S3†). Based on these results, it can be assumed that poor film forming of PEDOT:PSS (4083) may result in the non-uniformity of film. And then, the contact angle was measured and it was noticed that the interface layer of PEDOT:PSS (4083) had a contact angle (θ) of only 16.54° with PH1000, demonstrating excellent wettability (Fig. S3†). However, when spin coating the second layer of PEDOT:PSS (4083), the θ rises up to 64.75°, showing relatively poor wettability. The differences in the contact angle result in different surface free energies, so, the film formation of PEDOT:PSS (4083) will be largely affected. Interestingly, after spin coating the second interface layer, the Voc increased, and almost levels with the devices based on ITO/PET, and shows only a difference of 0.1 V with that of the rigid devices. Based on this phenomenon, it was speculated that the first interface layer most likely dissolves the bottom PH1000 to some extent due to excellent wettability and hygroscopic nature. This creates some pin-holes on the surface of interfacial layer.

The 3D surface plot (Fig. S4†) obtained from AFM in tapping mode shows that the first interfacial layer is non-uniform. However, a dense and smooth film could be formed after spin-coating the second interfacial layer. The root mean square (Rq) roughness of the double interfacial layer is also lower (Fig. 3). These results confirm that the double interface layer helps to ensure ohmic contact with the active layer, which helps to obtain normal voltage values. Also, it is advantageous to enhance the built-in electric field of the devices, improve charge transfer, and promote hole injection. Moreover, the smooth double interfacial layer is beneficial to form a more uniform active layer afterwards. Fig. 3c shows that the Rq of the active layer based on single and double interface layers decreases from 1.81 nm to 1.65 nm, which contributes to improving FF and further optimize the device performance. Thus, the flexible devices obtain a higher PCE of 13.44% with a Voc of 0.829 V, Jsc of 23.20 mA cm−2 and FF of 69.82%. Based on the measurements on a certain number of devices, the PCE average of 13.28% was obtained (Fig. 2e). In addition, the hole mobility (μh) was also measured, and hole-only flexible devices were fabricated with the structures: GR&AgNWs/PH1000/PEDOT:PSS (4083) (single or double interface layer)/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS (4083)/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Al. Using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method the μh was calculated with the equation37  where ε0 is the dielectric constant of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the active layer materials (∼3 for conjugated polymers) and L is the thickness of the blend films in OSCs (in this work, L = 120 nm measured using a computer-controlled Dektak 150 Veeco). The J0.5–V curves of hole-only devices are shown in Fig. S5.† The average μh values of single and double buffer layer flexible devices based on the GR&AgNWs/PH1000 electrode are calculated to be 1.01 × 10−4 and 1.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The double buffer layer increases the transfer rate of photogenerated carriers, extracts holes more efficiently, and further increases the Jsc. Moreover, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured for in-depth characterization of the devices with the GR&AgNWs/PH1000 electrode. According to the EQE spectral absorption shown in Fig. 2f, the integrated Jsc was calculated to be 21.66 and 22.51 mA cm−2 for single and double interface layers. The integrated Jsc of rigid devices is 23.72 mA cm−2. All are within 5% error and in accordance with the Jsc measured from the J–V curves. Compared with the rigid devices, the EQE of the double interface layer is slightly higher in the range of 300–450 nm. The main reason is that the lower reflectivity of the PET substrate (Fig. S6†) in this range reduces the loss of light, promoting the increase of EQE.
In addition, the stability of non-encapsulated and encapsulated flexible devices was measured under a nitrogen atmosphere for about 180 h (Fig. S7†). It was observed that the devices without encapsulation demonstrated poor stability. In contrast, encapsulated devices exhibited better stability and retained 90.2% of the initial PCE, which means that encapsulation can effectively enhance the stability of devices and promote its practical applications.
In particular, the bending test at different bending radii (r = 7.5, 5, 3.5, and 2 mm) was carried out for assessing the mechanical endurance. Furthermore, the inside bending (concavely) and outside bending (convexly) performances were measured. Fig. 4b shows the approximate trend of bending concavely and convexly at different bending radii. Bending convexly offers relatively more mechanical endurance. As is well known, the flexibility of the electrode is key to flexible OSCs. In the bending test of electrodes, it can be found that the change of Rs is minor when bending convexly, and this can account for why the efficiency of bending convexly attenuated less. When comparing different bending radii, there is almost no attenuation in efficiency after bending one thousand times when the bending radius is 7.5 mm, and when r = 5 mm, it has only 5% loss. With increased force, the bending radius decreased to 3.5 and 2 mm. In fact, when r = 2 mm, it is quite devastating (Fig. S8†), and contact changes at the interface and damage to the morphology of the active layer are greater in the process of bending. Unexpectedly, the devices based on the GR&AgNWs/PH1000 electrode maintain 90.2% and 84.6% of the initial efficiency after bending one thousand times, respectively, even though bending concavely. This phenomenon illustrates the excellent mechanical durability of flexible OSCs. The changes of Voc and Jsc during the bending process are also considered (Fig. 4a). The Voc change during the bending process is extremely minor, and Jsc can still retain 92.1% (r = 2 mm) of the initial value after bending concavely. The durable adhesion of the electrode on the PET substrate and its flexibility could account for this phenomenon well. However, the flexible devices based on ITO demonstrate disappointing mechanical endurance. When r = 5 mm, the PCE attenuated to the original 30% only after bending 500 times (Fig. S9†), mainly because ITO is brittle and cracks may occur on the electrode surface in the case of bending. In contrast, the mechanical durability of GR&AgNWs is more conducive to roll-to-roll production of flexible devices potentially.

3. Conclusion
In summary, the GR&AgNWs electrode has remarkable optical transmittance and electrical conductivity, and is a promising candidate for TCEs. A highly conductive polymer of PH1000 can effectively ameliorate the roughness caused by the stacking of AgNWs and also enhance the conductivity. What's more, spin coating a film of PH1000 can solve the problem of work function mismatch between the bare GR&AgNW electrode and the interface layer of PEDOT:PSS (4083). The devices based on the GR&AgNWs/PH1000 hybrid electrode achieve a high PCE of 13.44% with a Voc of 0.829 V, Jsc of 23.20 mA cm−2 and FF of 69.82%, which is mainly due to the appropriate energy level matching, uniform interface layer, and favorable ohmic contact. In addition, since the electrode is resistant to bending, the devices acquire unique mechanical flexibility. The devices retain 84.6% of the initial efficiency after bending one thousand times concavely even at a harsh bending radius (r = 2 mm), which is an extremely impressive bendable property. These results prove that devices based on the electrode enable achievement of high performance in flexible OSCs. Besides, it can satisfy the production requirements of low cost and roll-to-roll manufacturing in the commercial market, as a TCE. At present, composite GR&AgNW films have been mass-produced, and they have wide applications in touch screens, flexible displays, etc. It is worth looking forward to applying it into flexible OSCs widely.
