In this work, we used dual polyoxometalates (C4H9N)3PW12O40 and [Ag10[{Co(H2O)3}2{CoBi2W19O66(OH)4}] to modify the OMHP photoanode; the former acted to improve the quality of the perovskite film and the latter could facilitate hole transfer. Such dual modifications effectively reduce carrier recombination and thus obviously boost photoelectrocatalytic efficiency. Hence, we explored the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of benzene into phenol in aqueous solution by using the modified OMHP photoanode. The yield of phenol in the reaction using the modified OMHP photoanode reached about 31.8%, which was obviously superior to that using the pure OMHP photoanode. Furthermore, we carried out radical scavenger studies to investigate the active species involved in the photoelectrocatalytic benzene oxidation reaction, and thus proposed the plausible mechanism of the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of benzene into phenol over the OMHP photoanode. These results provide new insights into the development of high performance OMHP photoanodes for photoelectrocatalytic organic transformation.
Introduction
In recent years, organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP) has become a promising candidate in functional materials and photovoltaic applications.1–4 So far the power conversion efficiency of metal halide perovskite-based solar cells has exceeded 24% from the initial 3.8%.5,6 Such outstanding performances of OMHP obviously benefit from its excellent light absorption coefficient, long-range balanced ambipolar carrier diffusion lengths, and long charge-carrier lifetimes. Inspired by the above-mentioned results, the OMHP has recently been introduced as a photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical material. Thus, OMHP photoelectrodes have also been developed for applications in water reduction hydrogen production, water oxidation oxygen evolution and CO2 reduction.7 However, to prevent the OMHP from being exposed to water and moisture, these OMHP photoelectrodes have to be fabricated in a metal-encapsulated surface by using a costly process, which is not appropriate for practical application. Recently, our group developed an OMHP photoanode encapsulated with conductive carbon paste so as to solve the problem of high cost,8 but its photoelectrochemical performance is unsatisfactory due to the bulk and surface carrier recombination. Thus, the exploration of performance improvement in the OMHP photoanode becomes a desirable objective.
Polyoxometalates, a class of molecular metal-oxo cluster compounds based mainly on Mo, W, and V, have been explored in the photoelectrochemical field.9–12 In previous work, we found that the polyoxometalate compound (C4H9N)3PW12O40 (denoted as PW12) could improve the film quality of perovskite crystallization by the Ostwald ripening effect, obviously enhancing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells.13 Moreover, polyoxometalate Ag10[{Co(H2O)3}2{CoBi2W19O66(OH)4}] (denoted as CoPOM) displayed excellent photocatalytic properties for oxidizing water,14,15 suggesting that CoPOM could facilitate photogenerated hole transfer. Based on the aforementioned findings, we consider that a modification of the OMHP photoanode with dual-polyoxometalates (PW12 and CoPOM) may be an effective strategy to improve photoelectrochemical performance. On the one hand, the incorporation of PW12 into the perovskite can induce the growth of larger crystal grains so as to reduce intergranular impedance and trap density, boosting the charge carrier transfer; on the other hand, the surface modification of the photoanode with CoPOM is capable of facilitating hole transfer, so that the surface carrier recombination is increased. However, the strategy of modification with dual-polyoxometalates to improve OMHP photoanodes has been unexplored to date.
Furthermore, the use of photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis to drive organic synthesis reactions is extremely appealing.16,17 In particular, the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol is one of the most active topics in fundamental research and the chemical industry,18–22 because phenol is an important chemical used for the manufacture of phenolic resins, synthetic rubber, and pharmaceuticals, etc. Currently, phenol is mostly produced by the well-known Cumene process, but this process has obvious drawbacks such as multi-step reaction, poor yield, formation of explosive by-products, and energy-intensive production.23,24 Therefore, the development of photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical methods to oxidize benzene to phenol is of considerable importance. Recently, some research studies on the photocatalytic oxidation of benzene into phenol have been reported.25–29 In particular, photoelectrochemically organic transformation has become a promising method due to the free-separation of catalysts and bias voltage driven carrier transfer,30–32 and some organic syntheses such as the oxidation of glycerol and benzyl alcohol by using the photoelectrochemical method have also been achieved.30,33–35 However, the photoelectrochemical oxidation of benzene to phenol has been unexplored to date.
In this work, we first modified the OMHP photoanode by using dual polyoxometalates PW12 and CoPOM so as to improve the photoelectrochemical conversion efficiency. PW12 was used for improving the film quality of perovskite crystallization and CoPOM could facilitate photogenerated hole transfer to reduce carrier recombination on the surface of the OMHP photoanode. Then we explored the photoelectrochemical method to oxidize benzene into phenol by using the modified OMHP photoanode, displaying an obvious improvement in the yield as compared to that of the unmodified OMHP photoanode. Furthermore, we also carried out the radical scavenger studies to investigate the active species involved in the photoelectrocatalytic benzene oxidation reaction, and thus proposed the plausible mechanism of photoelectrocatalytic benzene oxidation into phenol over the OMHP photoanode.
Experimental
Materials and Synthesis
CH3NH3I (MAI) and HOOC(CH2)4NH3I (5-AVAI) were synthesized according to our previous work.13 The (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 precursor solution was prepared according to a literature method.36 The commercial carbon paste was purchased from Shenzhen Dongdalai Chemical Co., Ltd. The silver conductive adhesive was purchased from Nanjing Chuangyiyou Technology Co., Ltd. (C4H9N)3PW12O40 (PW12) and Na10[{Co(H2O)3}2{CoBi2W19O66(OH)4}] were synthesized according to the reported methods (infrared spectra in Fig. S1 and S2†).14,37 Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was purchased from Wuhan Jinge Solar Energy Technology Co., Ltd.
Fabrication of the perovskite photoanode
The perovskite photoanode was fabricated by the reported method.8 FTO glass was used as a substrate cleaned by deionized water, acetone and ethanol, and finally dried by air flow. A compact layer of TiO2 was deposited by spin-coating (2000 rpm) from a titanium(IV) isopropoxide precursor solution. A mesoscopic TiO2 layer was deposited by screen-printing of a TiO2 slurry (P25 Degussa) and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. A 1–2 μm ZrO2 space layer was printed on the top of the TiO2 layer using ZrO2 slurry, which acted as an insulating layer to prevent electrons from reaching the back contact. A carbon black/graphite layer with a thickness of about 10 μm was coated on the top of the ZrO2 layer by printing carbon/graphite composite slurry and consequently heating it at 400 °C for 30 min. Then, the resulting films were infiltrated with a 40 wt% perovskite precursor solution by dropping on the top of the carbon black/graphite layer. PW12 was added into the perovskite precursor at a concentration of 15 mg mL−1. The above mesoscopic structure containing the perovskite was dried at 50 °C for 2 h. After that, a commercial conductive-carbon was coated on the top of the mesoscopic structure by screen-printing and the film was heated at 80 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the silver conductive paint was coated on the conductive-carbon film and the device was heated at 50 °C for 60 min. Finally, the conductive-carbon was coated on the device and was dried at 80 °C for 30 min. All of the above operations were carried out in naturally ambient air and at room temperature. The structure of the perovskite photoanode is shown in Fig. 1. Quantitative Na10[{Co(H2O)3}2{CoBi2W19O66(OH)4}] and corresponding stoichiometric AgNO3 were dissolved in water to obtain Ag10[{Co(H2O)3}2{CoBi2W19O66(OH)4}] nanoparticles and were referred to as CoPOM (Fig. S3†). Then, CoPOM was spin-coated on top of the perovskite photoanode (2000 rpm) and the composite photoanode was named perovskite/CoPOM. The schematic of the perovskite electrode modified by CoPOM on its surface and the molecular structure of [{Co(H2O)3}2{CoBi2W19O66(OH)4}]10− is displayed in Fig. 1. CoPOM-1, CoPOM-5 and CoPOM-10 indicate that the concentration of [{Co(H2O)3}2{CoBi2W19O66(OH)4}]10− is 1 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM, respectively.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-3c) analyses were recorded with Cu–Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 30 mA, 5° min−1). Infrared spectrum (IR) was recorded with a Nicolet Magna 560 FT-IR Spectrometer. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi SU-8010) was used to observe the surface and cross-section morphology. The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Oxford X-MaxN80) was attached to the FESEM.
Photoelectrochemical oxidation of benzene
The photoelectrochemical oxidation of benzene was performed by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corp.) in a three-electrode system at room temperature. A 300 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5 G filter was used as the light source, the light intensity of which was controlled at 100 mW cm−2, and an aqueous solution of 1 M KOH with 0.1 mM benzene was used as the electrolyte. The photoanodes were illuminated from the FTO side unless otherwise mentioned. Pt wire was employed as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl was selected as a reference electrode. The measured potentials vs. Ag/AgCl were converted against a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale with the equation:38ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.0592pH + EθAg/AgClwhere EAg/AgCl is the obtained potential and EθAg/AgCl = 0.197 V (saturated KCl) at 25 °C. The current–voltage was measured in a voltage window of 0–1.3 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Transient photocurrent experiments of I–t curves were carried out at a constant bias of 0.9 V vs. RHE. After the experiments, the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted by adding HCl and the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate,39 and then the organic phase was analyzed on a gas chromatograph (GC; Shimadzu, GC-2014) to determine the yield of the desired product.
Results and discussion
The organic metal halide perovskite photoanode was fabricated by a simple method. Fig. 1 (left) shows the structure of the as-prepared perovskite photoanode. A TiO2 layer and a conductive carbon (CC) layer were used as the electron transfer layer and hole transfer layer, respectively. The perovskite photoanode was covered with the CC layer and the silver conductive (SC) adhesive layer, so as to prevent the perovskite from coming into contact with the aqueous electrolyte. The SC layer between the two CC layers plays a major role in waterproof function. In addition, the SC layer can create a low-resistance conductive interface between the two CC layers, and the holes can be transferred into the top surface of the CC layer under the action of an electric field driving force (under bias voltage).8 The CC layer between the CC layer and the perovskite layer can prevent the I− ions in the perovskite from contacting the SC layer from AgI. Fig. S4† shows a cross-sectional SEM image of a sandwich structure of the perovskite photoanode with a 50 μm CC layer, 70 μm SC layer and 50 μm CC layer. The top CC layer directly contacts with the electrolyte. Fig. 2 shows the further magnified SEM image including a TiO2 layer, a ZrO2 layer and a carbon layer filled with perovskite. Then, the corresponding cross-sectional EDS elemental mappings indicate the element distribution. The surface EDS elemental mappings prove that CoPOM can be loaded on the surface of the perovskite photoanode (Fig. S5†).

Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite film formed on the mesoscopic TiO2/FTO substrate. The main diffraction peaks are assigned to the (110), (220), (310), (224) and (314) planes of the tetragonal phase of (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3.36 After introducing PW12 into the perovskite film, no obvious effect on the phase of the perovskite can be observed. The wavelength-dependent light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of the perovskite (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 was acquired from the measured reflection (R) and transmission (T) as LHE (λ) (%) = 100% − R(λ) (%) − T(λ) (%).40 To eliminate the influence of other layers, we measured the LHE of ZrO2 filled by perovskite. As shown in Fig. S6,† the perovskite exhibits high light-harvesting efficiency from the ultraviolet to visible light because of the appropriate band gap of the perovskite. The LHE of the perovskite film with and without PW12 shows no significant difference, as indicated in Fig. S6.†

To evaluate the photoelectrochemical benzene oxidation performance of the as-prepared photoelectrodes, the current–potential plots were established by linear sweep voltammetry under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) in 1 M KOH with 0.1 mM benzene. In Fig. S7,† current–potential plots were tested in a KOH solution of different concentrations with 0.1 mM benzene. Based on the higher photocurrent, we used the 1 M KOH solution in subsequent experiments. It can be seen from Fig. 4a that the perovskite/CoPOM-1 photoanode shows a higher photocurrent density than the pure photoanode. With the increase of CoPOM, the photocurrent density continues to increase, and the perovskite/CoPOM-10 photoanode obtains the highest photocurrent density. The pure perovskite photoanode exhibits a small photocurrent density of 0.85 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. RHE. After being modified with CoPOM, the perovskite/CoPOM photoanode displays a pronounced photocurrent of 2.2 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. RHE, which is approximately 2.6-fold higher than that of the pure perovskite. The reason for the above-mentioned photocurrent enhancement can be attributed to the action of CoPOM. Because the photoanode must rely on the holes to initiate the oxidation reaction, a high concentration of the holes on the photoanode surface should be beneficial for its performance. Since CoPOM is an efficient hole-transfer mediator, its proper deposition on the photoanode can boost the transfer of holes to the photoanode surface; this certainly improves the charge separation and transfer as well as reduces the photogenerated electron–hole recombination. As a result, the photoelectrochemical benzene oxidation activity of the perovskite/CoPOM is significantly greater than that of the pure perovskite.

To further investigate the separation and transfer behaviors of the photogenerated charge carriers in the photoanodes, the transient photocurrent test was implemented. The photocurrent striking and following decays in all photoanodes can be obviously observed after light turning on/off in Fig. 4b. This result demonstrates that the perovskite/CoPOM photoanode appears as an accumulation and recombination behavior of the photogenerated carriers, which is in line with the results in the literature.41,42 With the increase of CoPOM, the steady photocurrent of the modified photoanode can be further improved. Moreover, the perovskite/CoPOM-10 shows the highest photocurrent, indicating that CoPOM can significantly enhance the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons and holes. This is also supported by the current–potential plots.
After loading CoPOM on the surface of the perovskite photoanode, we introduced PW12 into the bulk of the perovskite film. In our previous report, a large-grained perovskite film can be achieved by introducing polyoxometalate.13 In this work, PW12 as the crystallization accelerant was also introduced into the perovskite photoanodes to induce large crystal grain growth, which is beneficial for charge carrier transmission. For the perovskite film with and without PW12, as shown in Fig. S8,† the crystal grain growth of the perovskite is consistent with the results in the literature.13 The current–potential plots in Fig. S9† exhibit that the introduction of PW12 can improve the photocurrent of the perovskite photoanode. The formation of the large-grained perovskite film is also responsible for the higher photocurrent of the perovskite photoanode. Therefore, such a dual modification using two kinds of polyoxometalates (CoPOM and PW12) can efficiently improve the photoelectrochemical performance of the perovskite photoanode. Considering that CoPOM itself may be a potential photocatalyst, we carried out the control experiments on the CoPOM photoanode without the perovskite, and provided the plots of current–potential and transient photocurrent of the CoPOM photoanode. As shown in Fig. S10,† the CoPOM photoanode exhibits very weak photocurrents in both the I–V curve and the transient photocurrent plot, in comparison with that of the perovskite-containing photoanodes.
Considering the effect of applied potential on phenol yield and selectivity, the photoelectrochemical oxidation of benzene was carried out at 0.76–1.06 V vs. RHE. The pure perovskite photoanode was used as the working electrode, the electrolyte was 1 M KOH with 0.1 mM benzene and the reaction time was 1 h. The reaction yield and selectivity of benzene oxidation into phenol was analyzed and calculated by GC. With an increase in the applied potential, the phenol yield increases first and then decreases, and selectivity follows the same trend in Fig. 5. At a potential of 0.96 V vs. RHE, the yield of phenol reaches about 26.1%, and the corresponding selectivity achieves 84.5%. Thus, we chose the potential of 0.96 V vs. RHE in subsequent experiments.

As depicted in Fig. 6a, we carried out the photoelectrocatalytic experiments of benzene oxidation using three kinds of perovskite photoanodes. The yield for using the perovskite/CoPOM photoanode is higher than the pure perovskite photoanode, and the perovskite/PW12/CoPOM photoanode achieves the highest yield (31.8%). After the photoanode was modified by CoPOM, charge carrier recombination could be suppressed in the oxidation of benzene. Meanwhile, due to the introduction of PW12, the gaps between grain boundaries and the interfacial area are effectively reduced, so that the perovskite/PW12/CoPOM photoanode achieves superior photoelectrochemical performance. We also studied the stability of perovskite/PW12/CoPOM in five cycles of reaction (Fig. 6b), and found a slight loss of activity in five times of reuse. The results suggest a good stability for the as-prepared perovskite/PW12/CoPOM photoanode. In addition, we also performed a control experiment of benzene oxidation using the CoPOM photoanode without the perovskite, and demonstrated that the yield of phenol is very low, as compared with that of the perovskite-containing photoanodes (Fig. S11†).

To further understand the possible photoelectrocatalytic reaction mechanism for the perovskite photoanode oxidation of benzene to phenol, a series of active species trapping experiments were performed to probe the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation mechanism, as shown in Fig. 7. Ammonium oxalate was used as the radical scavenger for probing photogenerated holes (h+), p-benzoquinone as scavenger for probing superoxide radical species (˙O2−) and isopropanol as scavenger for hydroxyl radical species (˙OH).39,43,44 When isopropanol scavenger for ˙OH was added to the reaction system, the yield of phenol over the perovskite/PW12/CoPOM photoanode decreased remarkably. When p-benzoquinone for scavenging ˙O2− radicals was added, the yield of phenol over the perovskite/PW12/CoPOM photoanode decreased moderately. In addition, when ammonium oxalate was added to the reaction system, the yield of phenol also decreased remarkably. These experimental data revealed that holes and ˙OH play key roles in this reaction.

Based on the results of the photoelectrocatalytic reactions under various conditions, a possible mechanism for benzene oxidation is proposed (Fig. 8). The energy levels of each component of the photoanode are shown in Fig. S13.† When the photoanode is irradiated, the photoexcited charge carriers from the perovskite (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 will be separated and transferred by the electron transport layer (TiO2) and the hole transport layer (Carbon), and CoPOM can transport the holes to the surface of the perovskite photoanode. Subsequently, the holes are combined with OH− to form ˙OH.45,46 Then, ˙OH reacts with benzene to generate hydroxylated benzene as a radical. After a further reaction with the hydroxyl radical, the hydroxylated benzene will be converted to phenol.47–49 As for the influence of applied potential on selectivity, we consider that according to the results of active species trapping experiments, holes and ˙OH should be the main active species in the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation reaction. The resulting ˙OH reacts with benzene to generate hydroxylated benzene, and then the hydroxylated benzene is converted to phenol. Therefore, we infer that the selectivity change may be due to the different numbers of ˙OH under different applied potentials.

Conclusions
In summary, we used dual polyoxometalates (PW12 and CoPOM) to modify the perovskite photoanode. The strategy of dual modifications with polyoxometalates could effectively reduce the bulk and surface carrier recombination, so the photoelectrochemical performance was enhanced obviously. In the dual modifications, PW12 plays the role of inducing the growth of larger crystal grains and CoPOM acts to facilitate hole transfer. Furthermore, the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of benzene into phenol was carried out by using the modified perovskite photoanode, and the phenol yield of 31.8% that was reached was superior to that using the pure perovskite photoanode. Although the yield of phenol in the oxidation reaction is low, it is the first example of photoelectrocatalytic benzene oxidation into phenol using the perovskite photoanode. These results provide new insights of using polyoxometalates in perovskite photoelectrodes for photoelectrocatalytic organic transformations.
