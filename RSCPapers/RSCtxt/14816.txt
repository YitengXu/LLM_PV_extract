    , Accepted 29th August 2021First published on 30th August 2021AbstractIn this work, a novel visible light-driven self-powered photoelectrochemical (PEC) platform was designed based on 3D N-doped graphene hydrogel/hematite nanocomposites (NGH/Fe2O3) via a facile one-pot hydrothermal route. The coupling NGH with Fe2O3 could generate a Schottky junction, which promoted the separation of charges. Moreover, Mott–Schottky measurements validated that the carrier concentration achieved by NGH/Fe2O3 was about 3.4 × 103 times in comparison to that of pure Fe2O3, which was beneficial for efficient charge transfer. Owing to the carrier density effect and Schottky junction, the photocurrent of the as-fabricated NGH/Fe2O3 nanocomposites was 6.9-fold higher than that of pure Fe2O3. On the basis of such excellent Schottky junctions, an ultrasensitive visible light-induced self-powered PEC aptasensor was developed using a Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) aptamer. The as-fabricated PEC aptasensor displayed good analytical performance toward MC-LR detection in terms of wide linear range (1 pM–5 nM), low detection limit (0.23 pM, S/N = 3), excellent selectivity and high stability. This new strategy can provide a way for regulating nanostructures for more sensitive PEC sensors by increasing the carrier density.
1. Introduction
As a promising and fast-growing technique, a self-powered photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor has gradually attracted widespread attention in the fields of gene tests, early clinical diagnosis, food security analysis, and environmental monitoring.1–5 By virtue of its excellent photoelectric conversion efficiency without the requirement of external power, the self-powered PEC biosensor inherits the merits of both optical and electro-chemical assays including high sensitivity, low cost, fast response and simple equipment.6–8 Generally, the range of sensitivity in the PEC sensor strongly depends on the charge transfer of the photoactive material.9 It is reported that the carrier density depends on the carrier recombination rate, that is to say, the high carrier density is beneficial for efficient charge transfer.10 As for photoactive materials, a semiconductor-based material is an ideal choice, the carrier density of which can be easily regulated by electron doping, chemical doping or optical excitation. Such ability to tune the carrier density opens up a new way to adjust the bandgap distribution and charge transfer, and has cut a conspicuous figure in the fields of photovoltaic devices, solar cells and photochemistry.11–13 As a result, it is necessary to study the carrier density effect for developing high-performance PEC biosensors.
Hematite (α-Fe2O3), as a typical n-type semiconductor, has a narrow band gap (2.1 eV), which makes it an effective photoanode material.14 It is also known that α-Fe2O3 has the advantages of low toxicity, good chemical stability, abundant sources and inexpensive cost. However, there are also some disadvantages, which hinder high photocurrent density and limit the PEC application of α-Fe2O3, such as high recombination of photogenerated electrons-holes and poor conductivity.15–17 To address these drawbacks, numerous approaches including elemental doping, nanostructuring and the formation of heterojunction materials have been reported to enhance the PEC performance of the hematite photoanode.16,18 Among them, the formation of heterojunction materials allows for the incorporation of materials, which can increase the charge carrier density and conductivity. For instance, Sahu et al. reported that the incorporation of h-BN quantum dots into Fe2O3 could greatly increase the carrier density, which could enhance carrier separation on the hematite surface and decrease the hole trapping probability, resulting in enhanced PEC performance.19 Guo et al. utilized sustainable carbon nanomaterials to boost the PEC performance of Fe2O3 due to the unique role of carbon dots, which could increase the carrier density in bulk and hole accumulation in surface states, promoting hole transfer and suppressing charge recombination.20 In this regard, it is effective to generate heterojunction materials for increasing the carrier density and then improve the PEC performance of hematite.
Recently, the Schottky junction has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to modulate the charge transfer properties of semiconductor photoactive materials.21 As an ideal structure to facilitate charge transfer, the Schottky junction with a suitable barrier height allows electrons to flow from the semiconductor to the metal or metallic conductive–like materials, which adjusts the Fermi energy levels, prolongs the lifespan of the electron, and then promotes the separation of charges, leading to high-performance PEC processes.22,23 For instance, Liu et al. constructed a Ti3C2/BiVO4 Schottky junction, which efficiently boosted the charge transfer and displayed excellent PEC performance.24 Most recently, Wang's group has designed a MoTe2/graphene Schottky junction with efficient charge transfer and excellent PEC performance.21 Notably, previous studies have demonstrated that doping N-atoms into graphene and building 3D structures are effective methods to boost the PEC performance, which could not only adjust the electronic structure to augment the carrier density, but also create mid-gap states between bandgaps to decrease the work function, making more electrons move easily to the surface.25,26 What is more, the 3D N-doped graphene hydrogel (NGH) could trap the holes to suppress the recombination and then promote the transmission of photo-induced electrons and increase the conductivity.27 Inspired by these fantastic studies, it is of great significance to couple NGH with hematite for constructing a high-PEC performance Schottky junction with sufficient carrier density.
Microcystins (MCs), produced by cyanobacteria during water blooms, are cyclic hepta-peptide hepatotoxins, and till date, more than 100 kinds of microcystins have been found.28 Among these congeners, Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), which contains leucine (L) and arginine (R), is the most plentiful, widely found, fluid and poisonous isoform.29 It has a significant inhibitory activity on protein serine/threonine phosphatases and it further causes tumors to damage many organs such as the liver, intestines, kidneys or heart. The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed that the maximum allowable limit of MC-LR was 1 μg L−1.30 Nowadays, there are many methods such as chemical assays,31 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)32 and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect MC-LR.33 However, these methods are expensive, time-consuming and complicated, which limit their further applications. Therefore, it is of prime importance to build a simple and sensitive method to monitor MC-LR in the environment.
Taking these into account, we reported the proof-of-concept study of the NGH/Fe2O3 Schottky junction for PEC detection of MC-LR and then further explored the detailed mechanisms. It is demonstrated that such Schottky junctions could greatly accelerate charge separation and increase carrier density, which dramatically enlarge the value of the photocurrent. On the basis of the excellent PEC performance of the NGH/Fe2O3 Schottky junction, a novel self-powered PEC sensing platform was constructed to detect MC-LR using an aptamer. Because of the efficient charge transfer and carrier density effect, the PEC sensor showed high sensitivity and excellent selectivity toward MC-LR. Such study provides an approach to develop high current density and high-performance photoelectric materials, which opens up the possibility for designing more high-performance PEC biosensors.
2. Experimental
2.1. Apparatus
Scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) were obtained using a JEOL scanning electron microscope (JSM-6360LA, Japan), and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images of the materials were obtained using a JEOL transmission electron microscope (JEOL 2100, Japan). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was studied using a Max-2000 (Rigaku Co., Ltd, Japan), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was tested using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyzer (250Xl Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) measurements were performed using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer (Japan).
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were carried out on a P3000A electrochemical workstation (AMETEK, USA). All other electrochemical tests were conducted on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Huake Putian Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China). The photoelectrochemical performance was tested using a 500 W xenon lamp (CEL-S500, Au Light, Beijing, China).
2.2. Preparation of 3D NGH/Fe2O3 nanocomposites
A facile one-step hydrothermal method was used to fabricate NGH/Fe2O3 nanocomposites. Briefly, different contents of glycine and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were added into a GO dispersion, respectively. Ultrasound was performed for 10 min after every addition and thus a quasi-GO hydrogel was obtained. The hydrogel was moved into a polytetrafluoroethylene-lined autoclave and reacted at 180 °C for 12 hours. The product was washed repeatedly with deionized water after cooling down and then freeze-dried in vacuum to obtain a 3D NGH/Fe2O3 nanocomposite.
2.3. Construction of self-powered PEC photoanodes
Prior to modification, the ITO electrodes were sonicated separately in acetone, ethanol, and distilled water for 15 min, and then dried under a nitrogen flow. The as-prepared NGH/Fe2O3 samples were dispersed into DMF in 10-minutes-ultrasonic bath to form 2 mg mL−1 suspensions. Subsequently, 20 μL of the obtained NGH/Fe2O3 suspensions were coated with a fixed area of 1 cm × 0.5 cm onto ITO electrodes. These electrodes were marked as NGH/Fe2O3/ITO, dried under an infrared lamp and further dried at 60 °C for 8 hours. To further prepare Apt/NGH/Fe2O3/ITO, 20 μL MC-LR aptamer solution (2.5 μM) was drop-casted onto the NGH/Fe2O3/ITO electrode and incubated at room temperature for 6 hours. The obtained Apt/NGH/Fe2O3/ITO modified electrodes were rinsed thoroughly with distilled water to remove excess unbounded aptamers.
2.4. PEC detection of MC-LR
Apt/NGH/Fe2O3/ITO acted as the photoanode, and a platinum gauze was used as the photocathode. A 500 W Xe lamp was utilized as the illuminant and the photocurrents were measured on a CHI440C electrochemical workstation. Prior to the PEC detection, 20 μL of a certain concentration MC-LR should be first dropped onto the Apt/NGH/Fe2O3/ITO electrode and incubated for 30 minutes to realize the interaction of MC-LR and the modified electrodes (Scheme 1). After rinsing with 0.1 M pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution (PBS), the incubated modified electrodes were tested for photocurrents at 0 V in PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of NGH-Fe2O3
The XRD pattern of the as-prepared three-dimensional NGH/Fe2O3 nanocomposite was displayed in Fig. 1A. The main crystal planes of Fe2O3 (JCPDS no. 33-0664), namely, (012), (104), (110), (113), (202), (024), (116), (122), (214), (300), (1010), (220), and (306) could be observed at 24.14°, 33.15°, 35.61°, 40.86°, 43.52°, 49.48°, 54.01°, 57.43°, 62.45°, 64.00°, 71.94°, 75.43°, and 77.73° of the peaks of the NGH/Fe2O3 sample.34 A new broad peak at about 26.5° could be seen from NGH/Fe2O3 (Fig. 1A, curve a) compared with the pure Fe2O3 sample (Fig. 1A, curve b), suggesting the existence of the graphene sheets.35

The chemical state of the NGH/Fe2O3 sample was further studied by XPS analysis. Fig. S1A† displayed the survey pattern of NGH/Fe2O3, affirming the coexistence of C, N, O, and Fe. Two main spectrum peaks at 723.8 eV and 710.4 eV in Fig. S1B† were in accordance with Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 of α-Fe2O3. The high-resolution spectra of N 1s is shown in Fig. 1B. Three fitted peaks at 398.6 eV, 399.8 eV and 401.3 eV were observed, which could be assigned to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N, respectively.34,36 Among these configurations, pyridinic-N contributes to the π conjugated system an electron while pyrrolic-N contributes double, graphitic-N simply replaces the C atom with a N atom in the graphitic structure.37 What is more, pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N usually bond two carbon atoms, causing defects at the edge of graphitic-N. In this way, the N-doped graphene could provide more active sites for catalysis or other reactions, while graphitic-N could add the active areas by promoting the conductivity of the doped graphitic-N.38

Fig. 1C showed the typical SEM images of the NGH/Fe2O3 sample and revealed the formation of a 3D honeycomb-like feature with highly rough and loose structures.39 These rough surfaces were mainly due to the free combination of wrinkled sheets and defects brought by nitrogen doping.40–42 The clear small dots were Fe2O3, which uniformly distributed on nitrogen-doped graphene sheets, suggesting successful combination of porous NGH and Fe2O3. The detailed morphology structure of the NGH/Fe2O3 sample was further measured by TEM. As shown in Fig. 1D, many Fe2O3 nanoparticles around 40–80 nm were evenly dispersed on transparent graphene sheets. Furthermore, the inset of Fig. 1D discloses the magnified TEM image in which 0.23 nm interplanar spacings could be clearly observed in good agreement with the (110) planes of Fe2O3.43
3.2. Electrochemical and PEC behavior

Fig. 2A presented the photocurrent of different samples. As can be seen, pure Fe2O3 possessed a relatively small photocurrent (0.42 μA cm−2, curve b) due to high-photogenerated-charge carrier's recombination of inherent narrow bandgap semiconductor. After hybridizing with nitrogen-doped graphene, NGH/Fe2O3 achieved a highly enhanced photocurrent of about 2.88 μA cm−2 (curve a) compared with GH/Fe2O3 (0.14 μA cm−2, curve c) and 6.9-fold PEC intensity compared with pure Fe2O3. The reason might be the 3D defective structure and great conductivity of the NGH, which could vastly promote the separation of electrons and holes.44 In order to study the role of the NGH and explore the interfacial charge transfer processes of samples, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Fig. 2B) were tested in a 0.1 M KCl solution containing 5.0 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−. The semicircular diameter of the EIS spectra indicated the interfacial photoexciton transfer rate. Obviously, the NGH/Fe2O3-modified electrode had a much smaller arc radius than that of GH/Fe2O3 and Fe2O3, indicating that NGH/Fe2O3 nanocomposites exhibited a much-promoted separation and transfer ability of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. This phenomenon could be explained for perfect coupling of the Fe2O3 semiconductor and NGH with metallic conductivity, which formed a Schottky junction at the NGH/Fe2O3 interface. Such Schottky junctions have been recognized as an effective strategy to improve carrier separation due to the generation of the built-in electric field.21,24 Moreover, the NGH had a 3D honeycomb-like feature with many pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N defects, which were beneficial for the charge transfer. This could be attributed to not only the excellent characteristics of nitrogen-doped graphene including outstanding electrical conductivity, fast charge transfer ability and enhanced light harvesting, but also an exceptional advantage of three-dimensional macrostructures, which can support rapid electron transport in the 3D space, promote efficient charge transfer and provide adequate space for molecular adsorption.27,45,46 Moreover, according to previous studies, the presence of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in the NGH is favorable for creating larger edge plane exposure and bringing defect and edge sites, which is beneficial for charge transfer.37,47,48

UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra measurements were conducted to study the light absorption performance, as shown in Fig. 2C. Fe2O3 has an absorption edge of about 780 nm. After coupling with the graphene hydrogel, GH/Fe2O3 has a weaker intensity, which was mainly because the cumulate graphene impeded Fe2O3 to absorb visible light. When introducing the nitrogen-doped graphene hydrogel, NGH/Fe2O3 showed stronger absorbance for visible light, suggesting that the nanocomposition could use more energy of sunlight and cause larger photo-generated current, which may be because the energy band gap had been adjusted with the introduction of nitrogen.49
To obtain the carrier density (ND), the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots of the different photoanodes were tested at a frequency of 1000 Hz. As shown in Fig. 2D and Fig. S2,† positive slopes could be exhibited for all photoelectrodes, indicating that these photoelectrodes came from n-type semiconductor materials. To calculate the carrier density, the following equation was used:ND = (2/eεε0)·[d(1/C2)/dE]−1,where e, ε, ε0, and C represent the electron charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), relative dielectric constant, permittivity in vacuum (8.834 × 10−14 F cm−1) and capacitance at the interface between the semiconductor and the electrolyte (F cm−2).50 It is obvious that the more positive the slope, the smaller the carrier density. The corresponding calculated carrier densities of NGH/Fe2O3, GH/Fe2O3, and Fe2O3 were 2.915 × 1023, 2.545 × 1023, and 6.377 × 1019 cm−3. Notably, the carrier density achieved by NGH/Fe2O3 was about 3.4 × 103-fold higher than that of pure Fe2O3. Usually, larger carrier density means more excellent conductivity; for the as-prepared NGH/Fe2O3, it had the largest density that resulted from a minor reduction in the mobility after doping nitrogen,49 and thus, it had the best conductivity, which is in agreement with the EIS tests (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the enhancement in the photoelectric performance in this work could be attributed to the carrier density effect of the NGH and the formation of the Schottky junction at the NGH/Fe2O3 interface, as shown in Scheme 1A.

To verify the formation of the Schottky junction, we further studied the Mott–Schottky plots. The flat band potential (Vfb) was determined by taking the X intercepts of linear fits to the Mott–Schottky plots, which approximated the conduction band (CB) edge for n-type semiconductor Fe2O3. It could be observed that NGH/Fe2O3 (Fig. 2D, curve a) showed a more negative flat band potential than that of pure Fe2O3 (Fig. S2†), which could prove the formation of the Schottky barrier.21
We also estimated the band gap width of the hybrid material by converting the UV–vis DRS curve. As shown in Fig. S3,† Fe2O3 has a band gap of about 1.70 eV. When adding graphene, the bandgap decreased (1.66 eV). After the introduction of the NGH, the band gap further decreased to 1.58 eV. This result indicated that NGH/Fe2O3 has the narrowest bandgap, which could significantly enhance light absorption and then promote the generation of photo-induced electron–hole pairs.
3.3. Fabrication of self-powered PEC aptasensors
Based on the excellent PEC performance of NGH/Fe2O3, a novel PEC sensor was fabricated for highly sensitive detection of MC-LR using an aptamer, as displayed in Scheme 1B. To study the construction process of the sensor, the transient photocurrent responses in the different light switching states were measured. As shown in Fig. 3A, owing to the great conductivity of N-doped graphene and perfect optical performance of ferric oxide, the NGH/Fe2O3 nanocomposite had a high photocurrent of about 2.88 μA cm−2 (curve a). After assembling the MC-LR aptamer via π–π stacking interaction,27 it impeded electron transfer and thus reduced the photocurrent (1.44 μA cm−2, curve b). When microcystin MC-LR was further incubated, it combined with the aptamer and pulled down the aptamer, which improved the photo-electron transport capacity, resulting in an enhancement in photocurrent (1.66 μA cm−2, curve c).51
The impedance (Fig. 3B) can also be explained for the feasibility and stepwise fabrication of the sensor. The NGH/Fe2O3 nanocomposite had a small resistance (122 Ω, curve a) due to the great electronic transmission ability of the nanocomposition. After being attached with the MC-LR aptamer, the negative aptamer exclusived with [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− and thus increased the resistance (239 Ω, curve b).29 When the target was added, it could be recognized by the aptamer and then fall off the interface of the sensor, resulting in the recovery of low resistance (179 Ω, curve c). Both these PEC and EIS data further affirmed the successful fabrication of the sensor.
3.4. Optimization of experimental conditions
The effect of the nitrogen doping amount was investigated by adjusting the content of glycine in the one-step hydrothermal method. With the increase in nitrogen source, more specifically, when the glycine addition changed from 0 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg to 300 mg (Fig. S4†), the intensity of pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N peaks all gradually enhanced. Moreover, when the glycine amount exceeded 300 mg, the nitrogen content will not change. Furthermore, the PEC performance of the as-fabricated heterojunction with different nitrogen contents was measured. As displayed in Fig. S5A,† the obtained current dramatically increased with the glycine addition increasing from 0 to 300 mg, and then the photocurrent tended to be stable when glycine addition further increased. Hence, 300 mg glycine was used throughout the experiment. The aptamer concentration and incubation time are two important factors for achieving high sensitivity of the sensing system. Fig. S5B† implies that 2.5 μM of the aptamer concentration was the saturated point, beyond which the current tended to be unchanged. The incubation time was also researched for the optimum efficiency of the modified electrode and 30 minutes was the most suitable time in this experiment from Fig. S5C.†
3.5. Analytical performance of MC-LR
Under optimal experimental conditions, the developed Apt/NGH/Fe2O3/ITO modified electrode was employed for the sensitive detection of MC-LR. As shown in Fig. 4A, with the increase in the concentration of MC-LR, the corresponding photocurrent enhanced by degrees. More accurately, the current value was with logarithm of MC-LR concentration from 1 pM to 5 nM linearly, which could be reduced as ΔI (μA cm−2) = 0.38616logc(M) + 4.66634 (Fig. 4B). The limit of detection (S/N = 3) was calculated to be 0.23 pM. Compared with previous PEC and other analytical methods of MC-LR (Table S1†), it has a lower detection limit and a satisfying linear range, indicating that the as-prepared PEC aptasensor is able to adapt great majority of analyses for MC-LR.

(B) The corresponding logarithmic calibration curve of the as-prepared PEC sensor to detect different MC-LR concentrations (ΔI = I − I0, with I0 and I being the standard photocurrent of the aptasensor before and after incubation with target MC-LR, respectively). (C) Operational stability of the PEC sensor under repeat light irradiation (0.1 nM MC-LR used as an example). (D) Selectivity of the aptasensor toward MC-LR (0.1 nM) against MC-LA (10 nM), MC-YR (10 nM), carbaryl (10 nM), acetamiprid (10 nM), humic acid (10 nM), omethoate (10 nM), glyphosate (10 nM), atrazine (10 nM) and dylox (10 nM). 
The stability tests were also carried out on this biosensor. The results (Fig. 4C) indicated that when the material was irradiated with light, its current density increased rapidly and reached steadiness. After twenty consecutive times of 20 s excitation on the Apt/NGH/Fe2O3/ITO material, the photocurrent of the material remained basically unchanged. This phenomenon might be attributed to the addition of the NGH, enhancing photostability by offering additional active sites for the reaction, which may inhibit the aggregation that occurs during the photoreaction,52 thereby providing a reliable method to monitor MC-LR. Selectivity is an essential point of the constructed aptasensor. Fig. 4D discusses the performance of the prepared sensor while coexisting with other forms of microcystins and varieties of pesticides. When 10 nM of MC-LA, MC-YR, carbaryl, acetamiprid, humic acid, omethoate, glyphosate, atrazine, and dylox were added, no obvious difference in photocurrent occurred. Only in the presence of MC-LR (0.1 nM), the photocurrent increased, indicating that this PEC had excellent selectivity.
3.6. Real sample analysis
The practicability was tested by analyzing MC-LR by a standard addition method. As shown in Table 1, after adding 0, 0.5, and 1.0 nM MC-LR in tap water and pond water, the detection recovery was in the range of 96–104% accompanying a satisfying RSD result in the range of 3.2%–5.7%. All these results indicated that the as-fabricated PEC aptasensor has a promising feature for the quantitative analysis of MC-LR in real samples.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a simple self-powered PEC aptasensor for detecting MC-LR has been constructed, which is based on the NGH/Fe2O3 Schottky junction synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal method. With the introduction of the NGH, the charge transfer enhanced and the carrier density increased, which provided a wide linear detection range from 1 pM to 5 nM accompanying a low limit of 0.23 pM. This work not only provides a convenient way to analyze MC-LR, but also may have great effects on disease diagnosis and treatment.
