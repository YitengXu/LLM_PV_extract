In this study, Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 perovskite powders co-doped with Ag+ and Al3+ were synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method. They can emit bright and wide near-infrared light, with the center at 715 nm, and the photoluminescence quantum yield is as high as 48.6%. This bright emission results from the combined modification effects of self-trapped exciton (STE) formation, carrier incorporation by Ag+ and the carrier spatial confinement by the Al ions on the indirect band of Cs2NaBiCl6. In addition, Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 also shows ultra-high structural stability and good thermal stability with a melting point of up to 600 °C. Our work not only opens up a new way for the design of efficient and stable near-infrared light-emitting materials with an atomic level confining modification, but also may have great applications in the fields of optical communication and quantum storage, as well as in near-infrared detection of the human body.
1. Introduction
All-inorganic lead halide CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites have attracted much attention in the past decade.1–3 They have been extensively studied for their excellent optoelectronic properties such as high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), narrow emission bands, tunable band gaps and low exciton binding energy. While exciting progress has been made in the power conversion efficiency of lead halide perovskite solar cells, the toxicity and instability of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) remain a major challenge for commercialisation.4–9 Besides, an LHP semiconductor with a direct band gap displays narrow-band emission, which is usually confined to the visible spectral range. Its half-peak width (FWHM) is usually less than 50 nm, whereas the scattering can be extended into the near-infrared (650–1450 nm) spectral range by iodine-alloyed X sites.10–12 The narrow half-peak width (FWHM less than 50 nm) seriously limits the application of NIR emission materials. Wideband NIR emitters are particularly ideal, showing great application potential in medicine, food detection, biosensors and anti-counterfeiting technology, and greatly surpass narrowband NIR emitting materials.13,14 The traditional near-infrared light source has many shortcomings, including the use of a tungsten lamp, the low efficiency of the halogen lamp, a short service life, a large volume and a poor matching infrared detector, which provide the impetus for the exploration of a new generation of high-performance near-infrared phosphor conversion light-emitting diode light sources.15
Because of the toxicity and instability of lead halide perovskites, people tend to seek a non-toxic and environmentally friendly material to replace them. Although all inorganic perovskites and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have many excellent optical properties, the toxicity and instability of lead halide perovskites cannot be completely solved.16–18 The most promising candidate is lead-free double perovskites (DPs), also known as elpasolites. The crystal structure of a lead-free double perovskite can be represented as A2BIBIIIX6 (A = Rb+, Cs+; BI = K+, Ag+, Na+; BIII = Ln3+, In3+, Bi3+, Sb3+), characterized by a [B+X6]5− and [B3+X6]3− angular sharing octahedral alternating three-dimensional perovskite structure. A, BI, and BIII ions can combine to form a variety of structures, making double perovskite materials very interesting. Dual perovskite materials were previously proposed in 1970 and were used as ferroelectric materials, for example Cs2NaBiCl6.19–21 In recent years, halide double perovskite materials have been synthesized, including Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2AgSbX6 NCs (X = Cl, Br), Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I), Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2NaInCl6. Unfortunately, almost all of these systems have only weak PL emissions. Halide double perovskites are also used as sensitive and fast ultraviolet photoelectric detectors, solar cells, and so on. The photoluminescence efficiency of a halide double perovskite is reported to be very low due to optical band gap transitions and the inherent indirect or direct band gap.22–25 Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystals show weak white light emission with a photoluminescence quantum yield of only 1.6%. The single crystal of Cs2NaInCl6 exhibits a slight blue emission and a photoluminescence efficiency of less than 1%;26,27 the photoluminescence efficiency of halide double perovskites limits their application in light-emitting diodes. In order to improve the photoluminescence properties of halide double perovskites, many different methods have been proposed, including doping, alloying or both. Nag et al. investigated Bi3+ as a new sensitizer for Er3+ and Yb3+ in Cs2AgInCl6 DPs, thereby enhancing NIR luminescence.28 Recently, lanthanide ion-doped lead-free double perovskites seem to be an effective choice to extend the emission to the NIR region, but their photoluminescence quantum yield and half peak width still need to be improved.29–31 Therefore, the design of stable and efficient lead-free double perovskites with wideband NIR emission is still a great challenge.
Our work has designed a high performance lead-free double perovskite with broadband NIR emission Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 with superior stability prepared using the hydrothermal method. Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6, which was co-doped with Ag+ and Al3+ into Cs2NaBiCl6 and adjusted by different doping ratios, shows a single-component wide band near-infrared emission and a half peak width (FWHM) of 259 nm. The structure of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 remains unchanged and its cubic phase is retained after being stored in air for 6 months. Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 exhibits a near-infrared light emission with a high PLQY (48.6%) and excellent thermal stability with a melting point of up to 600 °C. As Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 is a single-component wideband (FWHM = 259 nm) NIR emitting material, it not only provides a new idea for efficient and stable NIR diode design, but also has great potential in optical communication and NIR detection.
2. Results and discussion
The Cs2NaBiCl6 crystal is composed of Cs+ ions with an alternating, common bond angle between the [NaCl6]5− and the [BiCl6]3− octahedral units. Cs2NaBiCl6 was co-doped with Ag+ and Al3+ in a hydrothermal reaction to obtain the product Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6. The crystal structure after [AgCl6]5− substitution for [NaCl6]5− and [AlCl6]3− substitution for [BiCl6]3− is presented in Fig. 1a. This substitution reaction may work because of the same valence. Though being different from the traditional ABX3 perovskite, this compound also showed a similar atomic nature. Cs and Na, Ag ions worked as A site atoms, while Bi and Al ions worked as the B site ions. The doping process in this system followed the equivalent charge principle. Fig. 1b shows the diffraction (XRD) pattern of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 powders. All diffraction peaks of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05; y = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) matched well with those of pure and standard Cs2NaBiCl6, and no other diffraction peaks were observed, indicating the good purity of the product. As shown in Fig. 1c, the XRD peak positions show shifts when Al or Ag is incorporated. When the Ag concentration is kept constant, the XRD peak position moves to a higher angle with increasing Al doping concentration, resulting in lattice shrinkage. Fig. S1(a and b) (ESI†) show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Cs2Na0.95Ag0.05Bi0.8Al0.2Cl6 sample. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed that Cs, Na, Bi, Cl, Ag and Al were uniformly distributed (Fig. S1c–h, ESI†). It is seen that the Al ions are even more clear than Ag ions in this compound. Fig. S2a (ESI†) shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6, which shows characteristic peaks of the Cs, Na, Bi, Cl, Ag and Al elements. Fig. S2b and c (ESI†) show the characteristic peaks of the Ag 3d and Al 2p XPS spectra.32,33 The XRD, XPS and EDS spectra all showed that Ag+ and Al3+ ions were successfully doped into the Cs2NaBiCl6 lattice in the products.

(b) XRD patterns of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 mixed with different concentrations of Al (x = 0.05; y = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and undoped Cs2NaBiCl6. The bottom line represents the standard XRD pattern of cubic Cs2NaBiCl6 (PDF No. 77-1831). (c) The XRD pattern is shifted around 33°. 

Fig. 2a shows the excitation, emission and absorption spectra of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05 and y = 0.2). A wide near-infrared light emission band after 350 nm UV excitation is observed, which covers the 400–1000 nm range. It can be attributed to the STE out of strong Jahn–Teller distortion of [AgCl6]5−/[AlCl6]5− caused by the BiCl6 octahedral lattice. When the doping Ag concentration is constant, the PL strength of the crystal increases gradually with the increase of Al3+ doping concentration and decreases at a higher Al3+ concentration. The Ag ion size (1.26 Å) is much larger than the Na ion size (1.02 Å), so its incorporation would produce very large stress in the lattice. It was also mentioned in Tang's work6 that the size of the Ag ion (1.26 Å) was larger than that of the Na ion (1.02 Å), so the incorporation of the Ag ion would produce great stress in the lattice. Therefore, the Al3+ ion (0.53 Å) is much smaller than the Bi ion (1.03 Å), so the lattice would have serious distortion between Ag and Al cooperatively in the nearby sites.34 Moreover, the Ag ion easily changes its valence in the lattice, resulting in an excessive charge in the vicinity, and thus STE would be easy to form in the distorted site in this system.

To investigate the origin of broadband, we took the PL excitation (PLE) spectra of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05, y = 0.2) from the 640 nm to 800 nm emission band (Fig. 2b). The nearly identical coincidence of all excitations suggests that emissions come from the same excited state of 300 nm and 350 nm bands, mainly from the charge transfer of Bi–Cl in the system as shown in the absorption spectra of Fig. 2a. For distinguishing their origins, we measured the PL spectra of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05, y = 0.2) from 260 to 400 nm excitation (PLE). It is found that PL has the same emission peak but different emission intensities under different excitation conditions. Fig. 2b and Fig. S4 (ESI†) also prove the presence of a single luminescent center of STE in Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05, y = 0.2). Fig. 2c shows the absorption spectra of Cs2NaBiCl6, Ag-doped Cs2NaBiCl6 and Al-doped Cs2NaBiCl6. The optical band gap of Cs2NaBiCl6 is 3.59 eV, and all the peaks are from the spin–orbital splitting levels out of Bi–Cl charge transfer bonds in this compound. Ag doping does not modify the band gap site, but increases the absorption coefficients for the lowest level. Al ion incorporation seems to induce a slight bandedge blueshift. This is mainly because the contribution of Ag to the maximum valence band (VBM) increases after some Na ions are replaced by Ag. When Al is mixed with Cs2NaBiCl6, blue shift occurs at the absorption edge, indicating the modulation of the electronic structure of the product to reduce the DOS of the lowest level state, while this state plays a critical role in the emission processes in this doped material.

Fig. 2d shows the effect of the Al doping content on the luminescence intensity. Fig. 2e displays the Raman spectra of the doped products and Fig. 2f presents the PL decay process of the emission. In the Raman spectra of Fig. 2e, it is found that Al and Ag doping all can produce an enhanced 2T2g mode at about 215 cm−1, especially for Ag ion incorporation. Such two phonon mode occurrences often represent an enhanced electron–phonon coupling and STE. The relaxation curve obtained can well fit the double exponential attenuation and its expression is I = I0 + A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2. I and I0 are the intensities at time t and 0, respectively, A1 and A2 are constants, t is the time, and τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow exponential components of the life decay time. This fact proves that the emission centers in this system are still complicated, not a single state.
Fig. S3a and b (ESI†) show the PL and PLE diagrams of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 doped with the same concentrations of Al3+ (20%) and different Ag+ doping concentrations of 30%, 20%, 10% and 5% respectively, with similar spectral profiles. The features in the spectra reflect that this broadband is composed of different components such as defects and bound states. When the Ag+ doping concentration is 20%, 10% and 5%, the PL emission maximum remains unchanged. In Fig. S3a (ESI†), the PL emission maximum with a higher Ag+ doping concentration of 30% in Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 blue shifted from 715 nm to 675 nm. Fig. S3b (ESI†) shows Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3; y = 0.2) and it can be observed that the PLE absorption bands have basically some changes. The low energy band in the PLE spectra shows an interesting variation, that is, with an increase in the Ag doping, this band redshifted at the start, then remained unchanged, and then blueshifted. In other words, the change of Ag+ doping concentration has an important influence on the excitation energy and intensity. Even smooth PL spectra can be seen with blueshift. This band shift profile indicates that the Ag incorporation increases the electron–phonon coupling at low doping, when the Ag concentration increases over a critical level, the Ag+ valence may vary, and the carrier scattering effect may become important because it is localized, so the blueshift of absorption in the PLE band and emission blue shift start to dominate at high doping. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the emission spectra of the samples with varied Al ion concentrations, in which no variation of spectral profiles can be found, but only the PL intensities vary. It indicates that the Al3+ incorporation only replaces the Bi ion, not bringing about the carrier effect, and they only produce the electron–phonon coupling variation to modify the STE transition probability. Fig. 2e shows that the luminescence intensity of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 increases with the increase of the Al doping amount. The PL intensity is the highest when Al doping reaches 20% and decreases when Al doping reaches 30% and over. For Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05; y = 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05), when the doping concentration of Al3+ is 20%, the PL intensity is the highest and the photoluminescence efficiency (PLQY) is up to 48.6% (Fig. S8, ESI†). The PLQY of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05; y = 0.3, 0.1, 0.05) varies from 45.4% to 39.1%. Fig. 2e shows the Raman spectra of undoped Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2NaBi1−yAlyCl6 (y = 0.2) and Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05, y =0.2) excited by a 532 nm laser. The Raman spectra of Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2NaBi1−yAlyCl6 (y = 0.2) and Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05, y = 0.2) are mainly controlled by the peaks at 274 cm−1 and 105 cm−1, corresponding to A1g and T2g vibration modes, indicating that the doped products retain the same structure. The peak at 274 cm−1 is attributed to the A1g longitudinal optical phonon mode associated with the symmetric stretching of the Cl atoms around the Bi atoms, and the peak at 105 cm−1 is attributed to the T2g mode associated with the motion of the Cs atoms. With the addition of ∼5% Ag+ to Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05, y = 0.2), a new vibration mode assigned to [AgCl6]5− appeared at 215 cm−1, which means that the two phonon mode starts to contribute to the electron–phonon coupling that it often relates itself to the self-trapped exciton formation,35,36 while the addition of Al3+ modified the vibration intensity of the longitudinal optical phonon mode at 274 cm−1, which only enhances the local lattice distortion.

Fig. 3 shows the band structure diagram and density of states (DOS) of Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 calculated by density functional theory (DFT) based on the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional drawing.37

It can be seen from Fig. 3a that the band gap of Cs2NaBiCl6 is 3.59 eV with an indirect bandgap, while Fig. 3b shows that the optical band gap of Cs2AgBiCl6 is only 1.79 eV, and Fig. 3c shows that the optical band gap of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 is 2.02 eV. They all possess the indirect bandgap. The band gaps of Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 decrease successively after the doping. In fact, the value is underestimated due to the original calculation technique drawback. The band DOS structure can be seen from Fig. 3d–f mainly because the contribution value of Ag to the maximum valence band (VBM) decreases after Ag and Al replacement of Na and Bi, and the band gap reduces. Moreover, according to this band structure profile, these products have no chance to give strong emissions for their indirect band gap. However, the carrier effect and strong electron–phonon coupling can promote this emission. Hence the STE formation and related strong confining enhanced e–p coupling in this system should be the only way to account for their emission process. In Fig. 3f we can see that the valence band maximum is mainly composed of the Cl, Ag and minor Bi elements, which implies that the Ag ion incorporation modifies the bandgap seriously, giving a new band below the conduction due to the exchange interaction between Ag and Bi via Cl, but not Al ions. Moreover, two split bands are observed above the VBM clearly in both the Al and Ag doped systems due to Ag and Bi interaction with Cl, and the Ag ion plays a dominant role. The minimum of the lower new conduction band is composed of Ag, Bi and minor Cl and Al with a single band, which could be seen mainly after the Ag ion incorporation and its combination with some Bi ion states. According to the calculated density of states (DOS) and band structure (Fig. 3c and f), the minimum conduction band (CBM) of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 mainly comes from the Bi-6p orbital and a very small amount of Al-3s, which produce a new narrow band after Ag incorporation; the maximum valence band (VBM) is mainly composed of the Cl 3p, Bi 6s and Ag 4d orbitals, which give two well-separated bands as shown in Fig. 3e and f. These variations of VBM and CBM after Al and Ag doping constitute a clear characteristic of the discrete energy levels due to the quantum confinement in the Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 system and spin–orbit interaction. Ag 4d introduces the carriers and valence splitting, and Al ion incorporation takes place in the confining local carriers on the Ag or Bi sites in the whole lattice, as well as brings up more lattice distortion. Because we have seen that the Al incorporation has induced the bandedge blueshift as shown in Fig. 2c for its atomic confinement effect. The absorption spectra and PLE spectra have reflected the clear double band profile, which is well consistent with the calculated band structures, much like that caused by the quantum confined system in other organic molecules based on perovskites.37,38 This fact indicates a rule: a confined photoexcited carrier plays a dominant role in the luminescence process of halide perovskites.39 By the density functional theory calculations, we considered decomposition pathways involving the compounds Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs8Na3AgAlBi3Cl24 and studied the decomposition enthalpy for these materials. As is shown in Fig. S9a (ESI†), the decomposition enthalpy values of Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs8Na3AgAlBi3Cl24 are almost above 0.4 eV along their pathways,40 which indicates the robust thermodynamic stability of these materials. Meanwhile, the migration of the native defect Cl vacancy (VCl) is considered. As is shown in Fig. S10b (ESI†), the high diffusion barriers of VCl in Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs8Na3AgAlBi3Cl24 indicate also the robust thermodynamic stability of these materials.41

Fig. 2f shows the PL lifetime decay line of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05, y = 0.2), with a PL lifetime of 6.11 μs (Table S1, ESI†), which is much larger than that (2.34 μs) of Cs2NaBiCl6. The decay time constant can be attributed to STE formation and related efficient emission.42,43 Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows that Cs2Na0.95Ag0.05BiCl6 has a PL lifetime of 4.93 μs when being doped only with Ag, a lifetime of 5.44 μs when being doped only with Al ions, and an even longer lifetime of 6.11 μs when being doped with both Al and Ag ions. The lifetime of the Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 crystal decreases with decreasing doping concentration of Al3+ at the same Ag+ concentration, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). This result indicates the Al ion confining effect on STE in this system. It indicates that although the Al ions do not increase the photoinduced carrier, their incorporation can increase the lifetime of local carriers, which may work in one way via the electron–phonon coupling enhancement, and in the other way, more Al ion incorporation establishes more local atomic potential barriers to confine the photoinduced carriers located at the Ag and Bi sites in this crystal structure. Therefore, even in such an indirect band structure material, the STE formation is promoted by both Ag and Al ions via different mechanisms, and it paves the only way to give its strong emission in the near-infrared range.
In order to confirm the above discussion results and investigate the effect of Al3+ doping on the STE emission of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05, y = 0.2), we measured its temperature-dependent PL spectra (80 K to 360 K). Fig. 4a and b show the temperature-dependent PL, PL emission peak and half-peak width of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05, y = 0.2) under 350 nm excitation. As shown in Fig. 4b, with the increasing temperature, the position of the PL emission peak appeared to blue shift and the PL intensity decreased gradually; meanwhile, their FWHM values also increased with the increasing temperature.44 It means that the STE formation occurs at a lower temperature than 80 K in this indirect semiconductor, and the carrier–phonon scattering plays a dominant contribution in its emission processes. For indirect semiconductors, their absorption and PL always need phonon assistance to occur intrinsically, which is limited by the low indirect DOS. Therefore, the carrier can be enhanced concentration by silver ion doping and aluminum ion doping induced structural distortion. According to previous studies, the blue shift is the same as observed, which is mainly due to the deformation of the lattice expansion and the change of the valence band as the temperature increases. Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 greatly inhibits radiationless recombination at low temperatures, resulting in stronger luminescence, indicating that Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 forms a very stable STE. When the temperature rises from 80 K to 360 K, the luminescence of the crystal decreases gradually, and the half-peak width gradually expands from 220 nm to 380 nm, which is the result of STE scattering by enhanced electron–phonon coupling at higher temperatures. The binding energy of STE can be extracted from the temperature-dependent PL intensity.45–47 (1)where I0 is the PL strength at 0 K, Eb is the exciton binding energy, Kb is the Boltzmann constant, and A is the constant.48–50 By fitting the relationship between temperature and the PL intensity (Fig. 4c), an exciton binding energy of about 578 meV was obtained, indicating that a very stable STE was produced for emission. Such a large binding energy also indicates its possible strong emission, showing the potential for the application of dual perovskites in exciton-related emitters.

To reveal the effects of electron–phonon coupling, we used this equation to analyze the temperature dependent PL.51 (2)
By fitting the temperature-dependent half-width (Fig. 4d), we further studied the position changing of the PL emission peak with temperature and obtained a large Huang–Rhys factor (S = 27.3), indicating that strong electron–phonon coupling exists to form STE. Therefore, the broadband emission of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 is contributed by STE as schematically shown in Fig. 5.52–54

Based on the above discussion, the mechanism of PL can be explained from Fig. 5. In Fig. 5, under near UV excitation at 350 nm, free excitons are produced and then swiftly captured by the local sites of [AgCl6]5−/[AlCl6]3−, forming a octahedron due to Jahn–Teller effect, and the STE is formed within the band gap of the crystal as well. The radiation recombination of STE produces a wideband near-infrared light emission at a certain temperature, and the Stokes shift is large. There are many kinds of NIR light emitters.55–57 In Table S2 (ESI†),58–66 we provide a comparison of a Cr-doped metal oxide and CuInSe2 with our work. Cr-doped metal oxides have been widely reported due to their high quantum efficiency and thermal stability, but their emission width is not enough to cover the first region of 650–900 nm, and carcinogenic Cr6+ will be generated when preparing Cr-doped phosphors. Recently, CuInSe2 reported that the luminescence of biomedical quantum dots is mainly concentrated in the second region of near-infrared, with low efficiency and insufficient FWHM. Our work prepared non-toxic materials not only with wide-band emission (FWHM = 259 nm), with a complete coverage of a region of near-infrared, but also with good efficiency and good thermal stability. Furthermore, the as-synthesized Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 also showed good environmental stability. After 6 months of storage in ambient air, no impurity diffraction peak is observed in the XRD pattern (Fig. S10, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 also has excellent thermal stability. The melting point by thermal analysis is proved to be as high as 600 °C, which is much higher than that of the undoped Cs2NaBiCl6(450 °C), and also much higher than other reported rare-earth free double perovskites, such as Cs2AgInCl6(507 °C), presenting strong base for its future application.67,68
3. Conclusion
In summary, we systematically studied the structure and spectral characteristics of the Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 (x = 0.05, y = 0.2) double perovskite, which gives strong STE emission with a wide near-infrared band and up to 48.6% PLQY. In this compound, the Ag ion incorporation introduced clear carrier concentration and two phonon coupling, and Al ion doping resulted in the spatial confinement on the local carriers at the Bi and Ag sites and the structural distortion effect. Both of them modified the band structure of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6, lifted its bandedge DOS, and improved its radiation transition process. These characteristics can be well reflected in the DFT calculation data. In addition, the crystal of Cs2Na1−xAgxBi1−yAlyCl6 can retain its structure unchanged after 6 months, showing excellent environmental stability. These findings open up a new way to explore efficient and stable near-infrared light-emitting diodes. Metal halide lead-free double perovskites may play a leading role in near-infrared detection, optical communication, quantum biological applications and biology in the future.
