However, the toxicity of lead in OHPs is considered as an environmental problem. Herein, we report two lead-free two-dimensional (2D) iodide-based OHPs, namely (C6H16N2)2AgBiI8·H2O (AgBiI) and (C6H16N2)2CuBiI8·0.5H2O (CuBiI), where C6H14N2 = 1,4-cyclohexanediamine, with a double perovskite structure. These two bimetallic perovskites show the optical band gaps of 1.93 eV and 1.68 eV. In addition, these 2D perovskite materials can form smooth films through a simple one-step spin-coating approach. Photocurrent measurements under xenon lamp irradiation indicate obvious photoresponses, suggesting that these semiconducting materials have the potential for application in light harvesting.
Organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) have recently attracted significant attention due to their light-harvesting application in solar cells.1–5 The most studied OHPs are the APbX3 family, where A is an alkylammonium cation, such as CH3NH3+ (methylammonium, MA) or NH2CHNH2+ (formamidinium, FA), and X is a halide ion. However, the toxicity of lead has become an increasing concern for the fragile environment.6,7 Thus, the use of non-toxic metals instead of lead in light-absorbing OHPs is highly expected. Although group IV metals, such as Ge and Sn, have been readily explored, the chemical instability of Sn2+ and Ge2+ hampers their application.8–11 The relatively high stability of Pb2+ results from the 6s26p0 electronic configuration (relativistic effects). Furthermore, the strong light absorption and long carrier lifetimes of MAPbX3 are believed to be related to the 6s26p0 electronic configuration.12,13 Therefore, the strategy of replacing Pb2+ with isoelectronic ions is feasible, and the neighboring Bi3+ is an option, which has been used as a nontoxic replacement for Pb in many areas.14–16 However, Bi3+ has a different valence state from Pb2+ and cannot directly substitute Pb2+ to maintain the perovskite architecture. An efficient method to solve this problem is to combine Bi3+ with a monovalent cation, which can balance the surplus charge of Bi3+ during the formation of perovskite structures.17
In recent years, there has been significant progress in terms of the incorporation of Bi3+ and M+ into inorganic or hybrid halide perovskites. For example, in 2016, McClure et al. have reported Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br) with the band gap of 2.77 eV for X = Cl and 2.19 eV for X = Br.18 Karunadasa et al. have reported Cs2AgBiBr6 with the band gap of 1.95 eV and the long photoluminescence lifetime of ca. 660 ns; this has promoted the research on devices based on Cs2AgBiBr6.15 Then, in 2017, the power conversion efficiency of the Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells close to 2.5% was achieved.19 In 2018, Karunadasa et al. further synthesized two-layered perovskites (BA)4AgBiBr8 and (BA)2CsAgBiBr7 (BA = CH3(CH2)3NH3+) with widened bandgaps.20 Wei et al. reported the first 3D hybrid double perovskite (MA)2KBiCl6, which exhibited properties comparable to those of (MA)PbCl3.21 Compared with metal chlorides and metal bromides, metal iodides show narrower band gaps and better carrier transport properties. However, iodine ions have been less studied for the construction of double perovskites, except for Cs2AuIAuIIII6,22 (C8N2H22)2AuIAuIIII6·2I3,23 (MA)2AgSbI6,24 Cs2AgBiI6,25 and the recently reported [AE2T]2AgBiI8.26 Thus, we were encouraged to investigate the possibility of fabrication of iodide hybrid double perovskites.
Moreover, very promising optoelectronic properties have been predicted for the Bi–Ag/Cu double perovskite using the first-principles calculations. (MA)2AgBiI6, Cs2AgBiI6, (MA)2CuBiI6, and Cs2CuBiI6 have been reported to possess the calculated band gaps of 0.60 eV,27 1.6 eV,28 0.28 eV,27 and 1.3 eV respectively,28 and all of them show low carrier effective masses. However, the Bi–Ag/Cu iodide double perovskites have been rarely reported due to radius mismatching among Bi, Ag/Cu, and I. Copper(I), in particular, has not been successfully incorporated into any halide double perovskites to date. According to the radius-ratio rules that describe the packing principles in ionic solids, the radius of the Cu+ ion is too small to hold the [CuI6] octahedron, which usually contracts to form [CuI4] tetrahedral with an edge- or face-sharing structure. To maintain the energetically unfavorable vertex-sharing perovskite structure, it is essential to introduce extra components, including organic or inorganic molecules, to generate additional forces and offset the energy deficit. The organic components with various structures are able to produce complex and designable force fields, whereas the inorganic ions with a nearly globular shape can only generate relatively simple forces. Through proper design, the organic components can form appropriate templates, hold inorganic components in the vertex-sharing structures and offset the energy deficit brought by radius mismatching.
Herein, using selected organic amines, we synthesized the two-layered hybrid double perovskites (C6H16N2)2AgBiI8·H2O (AgBiI) and (C6H16N2)2CuBiI8·0.5H2O (CuBiI) (C6H14N2 = 1,4-cyclohexanediamine) combined with Bi3+ and M+ (M = Ag, Cu) ions. They have the optical band gaps of 1.93 eV and 1.68 eV. In addition, they can be processed into smooth films through a simple one-step spin-coating approach. Furthermore, the photocurrent measurements conducted under xenon lamp irradiation indicate their obvious photoresponses, suggesting that these semiconducting materials have the potential for application in light harvesting.
A facile one-pot hydrothermal reaction was used to prepare AgBiI and CuBiI crystals (see the image of crystals in Fig. S1†). The crystal structures are shown in Fig. 1, S2 and S3,† and the crystallographic data are listed in Tables S1–S3.† We have found that 1,4-cyclohexanediamine, a kind of cyclic aliphatic amine (CAA), is effective to support the layered double perovskite structures, and the products are usually mono-metallic obtained using linear aliphatic amines and aromatic amines. Combining two metal ions during this self-assembly process was challenging because two kinds of metal ions with different radii could generate stresses in the inorganic layers,29,30 which would lead to phase-separation,31 and fail to form bimetallic products. However, 1,4-cyclohexanediamine used in this study can help to form the double perovskite structures. The 1,4-cyclohexanediamine molecules were able to pack into organic layers by van der Waals force. Indeed, the uneven plate structure of 1,4-cyclohexanediamine increased the contact area between molecules; thus, the intermolecular force increased and the relative sliding between organic molecules was hindered. The organic layers had two kinds of forces on the inorganic parts: electrostatic interactions and van der Waals interactions. In addition, the nearby amines in the upper and lower layers imposed different directional forces on the inorganic ions in the middle layer to keep them in positions.

Using cis-1,4-cyclohexanediamine, the red crystals of AgBiI (space group P21/c) were obtained (Fig. S1a†). The inorganic part of AgBiI features layered [AgBiI8]4− perovskite structures, which are separated by the (NH3C6H10NH3)2+ cations (Fig. 1a). The [AgBiI8]4− layers were assembled through single Bi–I–Ag bridges to form vertex-sharing [BiI6] and [AgI6] octahedron. The Bi–I bond lengths in AgBiI ranged from 3.030(3) to 3.101(3) Å. Moreover, the [AgI6]octahedron was distorted, and the Ag+ ions were not in the center of the octahedron; instead, they leaned to one side in the layer.
The lengths of two Ag–I bonds, which were vertical to the layer, were determined to be 2.684 and 2.687 Å. On the other hand, within the layer, the four Ag–I distances were 2.970, 3.453, 3.463 and 4.324 Å.
Furthermore, using a similar process, but replacing Ag2O with CuI, we did not achieve the Cu analogue of AgBiI. However, when trans-1,4-cyclohexanediamine was used to replace cis-1,4-cyclohexanediamine, we obtained pure shining black crystals of CuBiI (space group P21/c) with a 2D double perovskite structure (Fig. 1b, S1b, and S3†). The inorganic layers of [CuBiI8]4− were separated by the organic layers of the (NH3C6H10NH3)2+ cations. Moreover, the layers of [CuBiI8]4− were assembled through the single Bi–I–Cu bridges to form vertex-sharing [BiI6] and [CuI6] octahedron. The Bi–I bond lengths in CuBiI were in the range from 2.935(3) to 3.194(4) Å, which indicated greater [BiI6] distortion in CuBiI than that in AgBiI. In [CuI6], the lengths of the two Cu–I bonds vertical to the layer were 2.553 and 2.579 Å, whereas within the layer, the four Cu–I distances were 2.778, 2.990, 3.793 and 4.048 Å. Note that 2D double perovskites are rarely observed (Table 1). Because of the lack of samples, the properties of 2D double perovskites have been seldom explored. CuBiI reported in this study is the first CuI double perovskite reported to date.

To evaluate the suitability of AgBiI and CuBiI for photovoltaic applications, we determined their optical band gaps. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance data of the solid-state samples were measured and converted to absorbance by the Kubelka–Munk function (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, the optical band gaps of AgBiI and CuBiI were determined to be 1.93 and 1.68 eV, respectively, which were narrower than those of the multi-layered 2D perovskite (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)Pb2I7 (2.0 eV)33 and the 3D double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 (2.19 eV)18 (see yellow line in Fig. 2a and Tauc plot in Fig. S5†). At room temperature, both AgBiI and CuBiI displayed weak PL peaks at 1.84 eV and 1.78 eV, respectively, corresponding to the UV results. The DFT calculation of the AgBiI band structure was executed with or without SOC (see ESI for the computational methods, Fig. S5†). Upon excluding SOC, the result showed the indirect band gap of 2.28 eV between the valence band maximum (VBM) at G and the conduction band minimum (CBM) at D; on the other hand, upon including SOC, the calculated bandgap was still indirect, but the CBM shifted from D to Z, and the bandgap decreased to 1.53 eV. Thus, the band gaps predicted either by including or excluding SOC were different from the experimental results for more than 350 meV. Furthermore, the PDOS figures of AgBiI showed that near the bandgap (from −2 to 3 eV), the DOS was mainly contributed by the inorganic part, thereby indicating that the VBM was primarily contributed by the I p and Ag d orbitals, whereas the CBM was mainly derived from the Bi p, and I p orbitals.

Remarkably, both AgBiI and CuBiI are highly soluble in DMF. Moreover, 1 mL DMF can dissolve more than 1 g solid. By spin coating a 0.25 g mL−1 DMF solution of AgBiI and CuBiI on the ITO glass and annealing it on top of a hot plate at 70 °C for 10 minutes, we obtained the smooth films of AgBiI and CuBiI (Fig. 3a, b, d, and e), with the grain size of about 5 μm in the plane. Moreover, the cross-section images shown in Fig. 3c and f revealed that the films had the thickness of 250 nm, and the thicknesses of grains were equal to the thicknesses of films.

Generally, the inorganic layers in the single-layer halide perovskites strongly grow parallel to the substrate.33 In this study, the XRD spectrum for the film of AgBiI shows a strong (040) reflection and that for CuBiI shows a dominant reflection of (200), which reveals the vertical growth of the compound with respect to the substrate plane. The carrier transport properties in the inorganic layers were significantly different from those in the organic layers. The conductivity of the inorganic layers was considered to be significantly higher than that of the organic layers; thus, the vertical growth of the compound might be favorable for the transfer of electrons across the film. UV-vis spectra for the films of AgBiI and CuBiI were obtained, and absorption onsets were determined to be 2.15 and 2.02 eV (Fig. 3h and j), respectively, both being slightly higher than those of the bulk samples, which might have been caused by scattering according to the Mie theory (see ESI† for optical measurements).
Photoconductivity of AgBiI and CuBiI was measured using pressed pellet samples with 40 V bias voltages under 350 W xenon lamp irradiation (Fig. 4 and S7†). Both AgBiI and CuBiI responded with the photocurrent 40× and 20× higher than the dark current (Table S4†). The obvious photoresponses of these materials further demonstrated the semiconductor nature of AgBiI and CuBiI and indicated the possibility of them being optoelectronic materials.

Moreover, we investigated the stability of both AgBiI and CuBiI towards moisture and heat. The freshly prepared powders and films of AgBiI and CuBiI were stored in the dark at 55% relative humidity for 30 days. The PXRD patterns of the powder and the film samples of AgBiI and CuBiI after the treatment showed no evidence of material decomposition (Fig. 5). On the other hand, the PXRD pattern of the AgBiI film sample showed a variation in the diffraction peak proportions. After exposing the sample to humidity, the intensity of the diffraction peaks representing the planes (041), (042), (082) and (084) decreased, whereas that of the (040) and (080) peaks increased. However, no extra peaks appeared. Thermal stability is also important for solar-cell absorbers. Since both crystal structures contained crystal water, which was 1.1 wt% in AgBiI and 0.6 wt% in CuBiI, it was necessary to investigate their thermal stability. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) conducted at the scan rate of 10 °C min−1 does not show obvious mass loss up to 300 °C and 330 °C for AgBiI and CuBiI, respectively (Fig. S8†). To compensate for the fast scanning TGA, we investigated the PXRD patterns of the samples after heating them at 100 °C in air for 72 h, which confirmed their structural integrity (Fig. 5b).

Conclusions
In summary, using selected amine (cis- and trans-1,4-cyclohexanediamine) as templates, we obtained two 2D iodide-based double perovskites, i.e.AgBiI and CuBiI. They had the optical band gaps of 1.93 and 1.68 eV, respectively, which were suitable for their application in tandem solar cells; furthermore, the crystal samples were processed into smooth films by one-step spin coating, and the inorganic layers in the films were parallel to the substrates. In addition, both AgBiI and CuBiI exhibited obvious photoconductivity under xenon lamp irradiation; this indicated the possibility of their application as optoelectronic materials.
