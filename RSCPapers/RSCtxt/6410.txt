    , Accepted 20th January 2022First published on 20th January 2022AbstractMuch effort has been devoted to preparing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as effective electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs) due to their rich porosity, abundant redox sites, and high surface area. However, aggregated structures and poor conductivity are two major barriers associated with further applying MOF-based materials in energy storage applications. To deal with low conductivity and poor electrochemical active sites, the majority of the MOFs are transformed into functional materials which need energy-intensive methods such as annealing at a high temperature which often leads to degraded porosity and a low surface area. Thus, to address these problems, designing an efficient and structured approach is critical in preparing MOFs as advanced electrode materials. In this regard, oriented MOFs have emerged as the possible solution to unlock the bottleneck performance in SCs. In this article, we highlight the recent progress in oriented MOF electrode materials and suggest key points to be considered during the utilization of oriented MOFs.
1. Introduction
The continuous growth of humankind has heavily relied on the fossil-based economy which has serious implications on our environment such as the greenhouse effect, land desertification, and so on. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to transforming the fossil-based economy into a green energy-based economy.1–5 Much effort has been devoted to developing renewable energy sources including solar, wind, hydro, and so on.6–8 However, the intermittent supply of energy from the aforementioned technologies requires advanced energy storage devices which store excess energy and deliver at the time of need. In this regard, several energy storage systems such as batteries, fuel-cells, and supercapacitors have been identified and are continuously being developed to meet energy demands.9–12 Among these energy storage systems, SCs are among the most promising types of devices for next-generation energy storage applications due to their high power density, quick charge/discharge process, and great cyclability.13–18
Various materials have been widely researched, including transition metal oxides/chalcogenides/hydroxides/phosphates,19–24 carbon allotropes, and conductive polymers.22 Compared to conventional electrode materials, MOF-based electrodes have gained prominence as an emergent class of porous crystalline materials due to their fascinating structural features, high porosity, varied architectures, and tailored functionalities.25 MOFs have found their widespread application in gas storage systems,26 aqueous energy devices,20,27–31 catalysis,32 and so on.
In 1988, Davis et al.33 reported the synthesis of novel crystalline aluminophosphate-based molecular sieves (denoted as VPI-5) with free diameters of 12–13 Å (1.2–1.3 nm) which comprise more than twelve tetrahedral atoms. The presence of unique large pores was studied by the adsorption of triisopropylbenzene and perfluorotributylamine having kinetic diameters of 8.5 Å and 10.5 Å, respectively. However, it was not until 1995, when Yaghi et al.34 pioneered MOFs. The group reported the hydrothermal synthesis of crystalline Cu(4,4′-bpy)1.5·NO3(H2O)1.25 with an open framework, extended channels, and unique metal coordination. A few years later, Yaghi and coworkers reported the synthesis of the microporous framework of crystalline Zn(BDC)·(DMF)(H2O) where, BDC = 1,4-benzebedicarboxylate and DMF = N,N′-dimethylformamide with a high specific surface area of 310 m2 g−1.35 Subsequently, Zn4O(BDC)3·(DMF)8(C6H5Cl) (denoted as MOF-5) exhibited a high surface area of 2900 m2 g−1 with a higher adsorption capacity. Highly manipulative organic and inorganic building blocks of MOFs have since opened a new area in the design and applications of porous materials.
The inherent properties of MOFs such as high specific surface area, tunable pore sizes, accessible metal sites, and controlled crystal structure make them useful in the fields of sensing, catalysis, gas storage, and energy conversion/storage. However, the application of MOFs in the field of energy storage (batteries and supercapacitors (SCs)) is still premature due to their poor electronic conductivity. For instance, Lee and coworkers36 demonstrated the synthesis of the Co-MOF based on Co2+ and terephthalic acid. The Co-MOF possesses sheets of 5 μm thickness formed by the random orientation of 50–100 nm nanoparticles. The electrochemical testing of the Co-MOF as a SC electrode material in the aqueous LiOH electrolyte yielded a low specific capacitance of 206.76 F g−1 at a low current density of 0.6 A g−1. In another instance, Choi et al.37 synthesized a series of 23 different MOFs with the various organic functional groups and metal junctions, varying in the pore size, morphology, and crystal structure. Zr6O4(OH)4(BPYDC)6 (BPYDC = 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylate, termed nMOF-867), with sp2 nitrogen atoms embedded in the organic part of the MOF exhibited a high areal capacitance of 5.09 mF cm−2. [Zn4O(BDC)1.67(C4H4-BDC)1.33 (BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), nMTV-MOF-5-AF (MTV = multivariate), A = BDC, and F = (CH3)2BDC] exhibited the lowest areal capacitance of 0.195 mF cm−2. However, the reported values are far from what is acceptable for wide-scale practical applications.
MOFs feature a metal core ion or cluster (nodes) linked to organic ligands (linkers) as shown in Fig. 1. The existence of metal centers may boost pseudocapacitive energy storage and improve the electrolyte-material interaction due to the development of a large specific surface area. However, the random orientations and poor conductivity of MOFs limit their potential use.38 Significant focus on MOF preparation techniques has been paid in relation to their structures and properties. For instance, the template technique offers a controlled crystal growth and morphology, and generation of secondary pores.39 It is regarded as one of the most efficient ways to grow highly oriented MOFs. The traditional templating method, indeed, allows desirable structures to be achieved. However, removal of templates by using calcination/annealing at high temperatures or etching with acid, causes much damage to the MOF structure, thus lowering the electrode electrochemical performance.40 Likewise, another appropriate approach is to not remove the template but convert it to the MOF as well, thus utilizing it both as a template and a precursor at the same time. This allows template removal to be bypassed and permits the full utilization and integration of template precursors as MOFs. It is imperative to highlight that several review studies have been published dealing with the application of MOFs and MOF-derivatives for electrochemical energy storage.41–43 To the best of the author's knowledge, no article has been found in the literature dealing with oriented MOFs for SCs. Therefore, this accumulated knowledge brings together the advantages and disadvantages (discussed below) of oriented MOFs and highlights the recent advances, in particular, for SCs.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the general formation of MOFs. 
Oriented MOFs possess the following advantages:
(i) Facile and fast access of electrolyte ions through the pores in the entire structure.
(ii) Directly grown MOFs on substrates or current collectors eliminate the use of conductive additives and polymer binders in electrode preparation that will enhance the effective surface area, allow electrolyte ions to penetrate the electrode efficiently, and increase the electrode flexibility.
(iii) Directly grown and oriented MOFs on substrates or current collectors provide greater adhesion, structural integrity, and conductivity, as well as increased capacity and stability.
(iv) During long charge–discharge cycles, the space between the orientated MOFs can offer a buffer for volume changes, resulting in excellent stability.
In the last decade, remarkable progress in MOF materials has been achieved. The number of articles published on MOFs (based on Scopus), and energy-related applications have increased at an almost exponential rate in recent years, as shown in Fig. 2. In this review, we report two important sections: (1) recent advances in oriented MOFs as an electrode material for SCs, and (2) challenges and guidance for future prospective research on oriented MOFs.

2. Recent advances in oriented MOFs as an electrode material for SCs
MOFs are considered as attractive options for SCs due to their high specific area and possible redox sites. However, their performance is significantly hampered due to their untidy orientations and poor conductivity. Also, the removal of templates that render the secondary methodology where high heat treatment and extreme acidic conditions are employed may destroy the MOF structure. Recently, few reports discussed the orientation and preservation of MOFs which are also applied as high-performance electrode materials.
(a). Monometallic oriented MOFs
Sheberla et al.44 reported the synthesis of conductive Ni3 (2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (denoted as Ni3(HITP)2) that comprises π-conjugated 2D-layers, with one-dimensional cylindrical channels of ∼1.5nm diameter. Apart from a high surface area of 630 m2 g−1, the prepared MOF exhibits a high electrical conductivity of 5000 S m−1. The electrochemical testing of Ni3(HITP)2 (Fig. 3a) revealed a dominating capacitive nature with quasi-reversible oxidation at around 0.7 V when tested in 1 M TEABF4/CAN electrolyte. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was employed at the Ni K-edge of Ni3(HITP)2 at 1 V (Fig. 3b) to understand the nature of this faradaic reaction. However, no change in the position of the Ni K-edge was observed meaning no change in the coordination environment (oxidation states remain unchanged) of Ni atoms indicating the role of HITP in the faradaic reaction rather than Ni. The GCD test was employed to calculate the specific capacitance of Ni3(HITP)2. At a low current density of 50 mA g−1, Ni3(HITP)2 yielded a specific capacitance of just 111 F g−1 (specific surface area normalized = 18 μFcm−2).

Researchers have identified two strategies to mitigate the inherited drawbacks of limited electrical conductivity and chemical stability of MOF materials: reduce the particle size to the nanometer scale to enhance the specific surface area or design better scaffolds of MOFs, which have a higher ratio of exposed active sites to electrolyte ions. Yan et al.45 synthesized an accordion-like Ni-MOF ([Ni3(OH)2(C8H4O4)2(H2O)4]·2H2O) superstructure which yielded a specific capacitance of 988 F g−1 at a discharge rate of 1.4 A g−1. Interestingly, the CV curves (Fig. 3c) of the accordion-like Ni-MOF exhibited pseudocapacitive behavior which implicates the involvement of metal ions during the charge–discharge process. Moreover, the accordion-like Ni-MOF delivered 96.5% of its initial specific capacitance after 5k cycles (Fig. 3d). Deng et al.46 reported the synthesis of a self-supported MOF by interfacial engineering of carbon nanowalls and the MOF. The group used the carbon nanowalls as the scaffold to anchor the vertically oriented MOF. The carbon nanowall supported MOF yielded a high specific capacitance of 1962 F g−1 at a discharge rate of 1 A g−1. The remarkable electrochemical performance of the vertically oriented MOF was attributed to the facile electrolyte penetration and the shortest ion pathways for ion (de)intercalation. Zhao et al.47 reported the synthesis of highly oriented Co-MOF nanoneedles (NNs) on Co foam using a one-pot strategy. The schematic of Co-MOF synthesis on Co foam is shown in Fig. 4a. The application of the Co-MOF as a supercapacitor electrode material yielded a high specific capacitance of 1164.2 F g−1 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2. The group attributed the remarkable electrochemical attributes of the oriented Co-MOF to its special NN structure. The gap between the NNs serves as the electrolyte reservoir which facilitates the transport of electrolytes during the (dis)charge process. The increase in the sweep rate increases the overlap of CV curves indicating the ideal pseudocapacitive characteristics and facile (de)intercalation of OH− ions upon polarization. The traditional electrode preparation method (paste-coating, drop-casting) results in a disorganized orientation of MOFs on the current collector. Such a method of coating reduces the electrochemical active surface area, generating the local inactive volume and aggravating the conductivity situation. Yao et al.48 prepared co-oriented vertically aligned K0.5Mn2O4@Mn-MOF-8 nanosheet arrays by using K0.5Mn2O4 as both the precursor and the template. The alkali cation was intercalated to enhance the conductivity and charge-transfer path. A comparison of self-supported K0.5Mn2O4 and K0.5Mn2O4@Mn-MOF-8 is shown in Fig. 4b. For K0.5Mn2O4, the diffraction peaks are well-aligned with the diffraction peaks of the monoclinic phase of K0.5Mn2O4 (JCPDS no. 42-1317), whereas the remaining peaks are in good agreement with the simulated crystal data of the monoclinic phase of the Mn-MOF. Fig. 4c depicts the C 1s spectra of K0.5Mn2O4 and K0.5Mn2O4@Mn-MOF-8 which confirms the chemical bonding between K0.5Mn2O4 and K0.5Mn2O4@Mn-MOF-8. The significant factor of stability evaluated for both bare K0.5Mn2O4 and K0.5Mn2O4@Mn-MOF-8 was compared as shown in Fig. 4d. Generally, manganese oxide is partially dissolved because Mn2+ in the electrochemical process results in a loss of active material quality and a fast drop in the electrode material cycle performance. However, Mx in the birnessite-type nanosheet [MxMnO2 nanosheet (Mx = H+, Li+, Na+, and K+)] may improve the conductivity and capacity of the electrode materials by inserting/removing them into/from the structure. The presence of hydrated cations, K+, and crystal water in between the sheets of the layered structure aided the stable structure and prevented the dissolution of manganese oxide during the electrochemical testing. Furthermore, the interface between vertically aligned co-oriented K0.5Mn2O4@Mn-MOF-8 nanosheets and electrolyte improve the utilization of electrode material electrochemical reaction active sites.49,50 Moreover, the consistent orientation of active materials can ensure excellent contact with the current collector which is beneficial for fast electron transport.

(b). Bimetallic oriented MOFs and composites
The rational design of self-standing MOF materials is considered an imperative pathway to enhance the electrochemical characteristics of MOFs. Benefitting from the lower contact resistance and strong adhesion of the electrode material to the conductive substrate ensures enhanced kinetics. Wang's group reported the synthesis of well-aligned triangular NiCo-MOF@NF (NF = nickel foam) by adjusting the molar ratios of Ni and Co precursors.51 Ni:Co (3:2) delivered a remarkable specific capacitance of 2230 F g−1 at a discharge rate of 1 A g−1. For comparison, the group synthesized 3–2 NiCo-MOF in powder form (denoted as 3–2 NiCo-MOF-P). Electrochemical testing of the 3–2 NiCo-MOF-P electrode material yielded 1168 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 which is about 50% that of 3–2 NiCo-MOF@NF (Fig. 5a). The outstanding merits of 3–2 NiCo-MOF@NF were attributed to the well-aligned architecture and excellent connection between the MOF and nickel foam. Additionally, the charge storage mechanism of 3–2 NiCo-MOF@NF portrayed (Fig. 5b) a diffusion-dominated behaviour at low scan rates. Guo et al.52 reported the direct synthesis of Ni/Co-MOF-74 on nickel foam via a one-pot solvothermal strategy. Ni:Co (1:2) exhibited a high specific capacity of 433.5C g−1 at a discharge rate of 1 A g−1 along with a high-rate capability of 359.1C g−1 at a discharge rate of 10 A g−1. The rich porous structure, high electrical conductivity, the synergistic effect of Ni and Co, and tight connection between the MOF and nickel foam play a critical role in delivering high electrochemical merits. Moreover, Ni/Co-MOF-74@NF exhibited an excellent cycling stability of 82.5% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1 (Fig. 5c). Hong et al.53 reported the core-sheath structure based on the Co-Ni-MOF on a nickel wire as a high energy density electrode material for hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) devices. The vertically and oriented MOF structure was composed of nanosheets which are not only uniform, and vertically aligned but also interconnected with each other which is beneficial for electron and ion transport.15 Such an ultra-thin petal-like nanostructured MOF on the nickel wire exhibited a high surface area and excellent conductivity. The oriented nanosheet-like structure exhibited a high volumetric specific capacity of 813C cm−3 at 0.5 A cm−3 in three-electrode measurements. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) (Co-Ni-MOF//graphene-CNTs) depicted virtual box-type CV curves (Fig. 5d) at varying scan rates in the range of 2–50 mV s−1 indicating excellent capacitive characteristics of the HSC. Moreover, the device yielded a high volumetric capacitance of 100 F cm−3 at a discharge rate of 0.5 A cm−3 (Fig. 5e). Interestingly, the HSC retained 100% of its initial capacitance in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte after 10000 cycles (Fig. 5f), highlighting its potential use in long-stability applications.

For energy storage devices, the conductivity of the current collector also influences electrochemical performance. Recently, our group29 proposed oriented growth of the Ni-Co-MOF on solution-free 1D CuO nanowires. In the first step, solution-free CuO nanowires were simply prepared through oxidation. In the second step, the as-prepared CuO nanowires were transformed into the forest-like oriented MOF through a low-temperature hydrothermal approach. The forest-like structure offered the benefit of easily accessible localized pores with a high content of redox-active sites, resulting in improved electrochemical properties. The complete process is shown schematically in Fig. 6a. It should be noted that the Cu mesh not only serves as a flexible substrate but also as the sole source of Cu species. The oriented Ni-Co-MOF@CuO exhibited excellent flexibility (Fig. 6a). The oriented Ni-Co-MOF@CuO exhibited a superior specific capacitance of 756 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 which is 3.3 times higher than that of bare CuO nanowires as shown in Fig. 6b. The superior specific capacitance of Ni-Co-MOF@CuO was compared with recently reported MOFs and metal-sulfide/oxide/hydroxide-based electrode materials (Fig. 6c). We synthesized Ni-Co-ZIF in powder form to emphasize the significance of the CuO scaffold in the formation of the orientated Ni-Co-ZIF. Such a powdery form of Ni-Co-ZIF exhibited a gravel-like morphology. The oriented Ni-Co-MOF@CuO delivered a specific capacitance 2.1 times that of powdery form Ni-Co-ZIF. The excellent performance was attributed to the integration of the p–n heterojunction (p-type CuO and n-type Ni-Co-ZIF). The direct and oriented growth of the MOF on the Cu mesh aided in better structural stability, adhesion, and excellent conductivity, thus, resulting in an improved stability and excellent capacity. Other oriented MOFs have been reported to excel well as SCs. For instance, Li et al.54 obtained a high specific capacity of 208.8 mA h g−1 at 2 mA cm−2 and good rate capability by using the NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF hybrid electrode in a three-electrode setup.

(c). Hydroxide-derived oriented MOFs
In 2005, Mueller et al.55 reported the invention of electrochemical preparation of crystalline and porous MOFs. Typically, the synthesis of MOFs requires the metal ions to which the ligands are coordinatively bonded during synthesis. Metal ion precursors often comprise salts such as nitrates which can decompose spontaneously when overheated. On the other hand, use of metal halides has been reported which can result in the rapid corrosion of industrial equipment hindering its use for practical application. Preparation of MOFs through the electrochemical process bypasses the use of metal salts and the metals are instead introduced into the solution via oxidation of the anode. The group pioneered the use of copper, iron, zinc, silver, and magnesium-based anodes to prepare Zn/BDC/DEF, Zn/DHBDC/DEF, Zn/H2BDC/DMSO, Cu/BDC/DEF, Fe/H2BDC/DEF, Fe/H3BDC/DEF, Mg/BDC/DEF, Co/H2BDC/DEF respectively, and so on. M/L/S represents metal/ligand/solvent, BDC = benzene dicarboxylic acid, DHBDC = 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid, H2BDC = dihydroterephthalic acid, H3BDC = benzene tribenzoate, DEF = diethyl formamide, and DMSO = dimethyl sulfoxide. The anodic oxidation approach was further utilized by several other groups to produce MOF materials through the electrochemical process.56,57
In contrast to the above-mentioned method (anodic oxidation), Minyuan et al.58 reported the electroreductive synthesis of MOFs. The electrochemical generation of hydroxide ions (OH−) through reduction of water or oxoanions (NO3− and ClO4−) has been extensively reported to synthesize metal oxide and hydroxide films.59 Inspired by the electrodeposition method, the group reported the synthesis of Zn4O(BDC)3 (MOF-5) on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The synthesis steps (Fig. 7a) included the cathodic generation of OH− which leads to the reduction of ligands and results in the growth of MOFs directly on the substrate surface.

Okada et al.60 demonstrated a novel approach to synthesize homogenous HKUST-1 [Cu3(BTC)2] on several copper substrates. The process possesses several merits such as short synthesis time, low capital cost, and ambient conditions. The synthesis procedure consists of two steps: (1) conversion of metallic copper to Cu(OH)2 by solvent treatment at room temperature and (2) conversion of Cu(OH)2 to Cu3(BTC)2 in the presence of water, alcohol, and trimesic acid at room temperature. MOFs are commonly employed to produce metal oxides, metal sulfides, hydroxides, and so on.61 Conversion of MOFs to functional materials is like DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) pairing, which assures the consistent transformation and retaining the inherited porous structure and high surface area. Assembling oriented crystalline MOFs is critical for their widespread application in electrochemical energy storage systems. On this end, epitaxial growth of MOF materials is even highly challenging. However, Deng et al.62 reported the synthesis of the oriented CoNi-MOF based on the inspiration of RNA reverse transcription. Initially, Co(OH)2 acted both as a template and a precursor and then was converted to the vertically aligned oriented CoNi-MOF. During the second step, Ni-MOF precursors were introduced. Both sides of the Co(OH)2 layer have hydrogen atoms, which were then replaced by Ni ions as anchoring sites for the growth of the MOF, and the remaining CoO layer was transformed as well into a MOF structure. Co(OH)2 was then facilely converted to the CoNi-MOF which is shown in Fig. 7b (XRD patterns). For comparison, a single metal MOF and un-oriented powdery MOF were also prepared. The CV and GCD results were compared at a constant scan rate and current density, respectively as shown in Fig. 7c and d. The oriented MOF exhibited a superior capacitance (1044 F g−1) compared to the un-oriented powdery MOF (719 F g−1), both at the same current density of 2 A g−1. The poor performance of the un-oriented powdery MOF was due to its low conductivity which decelerates the electron transfer and then weakens the rate capability. In addition, the worsened performance of the shuffled MOF can also be due to the reduced surface area and the presence of a dead volume. Moreover, shuffled orientation might obstruct effective electrolyte penetration to reach the active electrochemical surfaces, which further complicates the faradaic charge transfer.
(d). Hydroxide derived MOF/metal oxide composite
The use of the MOF as an electrode material leads to critical problems such as low electrical conductivity, poor stability, and degraded electrochemical activity.63 Modern-day researchers have identified that combining MOFs with pseudocapacitive/battery type materials can ameliorate the characteristics of individual compounds. Cao et al.64 first introduced the synthesis of the oriented composite (Co/Cu-MOF/Cu2+1O) with a better connection between the battery-type material and MOF. The group first prepared the vertically oriented Cu(OH)2 nanorod array on copper foam followed by the partial conversion of Cu(OH)2 to the Cu-MOF and the remaining to Cu2+1O as shown schematically in Fig. 8a. The addition of the cobalt precursor not only leads to Co doping in the Cu-MOF framework but also guides the formation of the star anise structure. Co/Cu-MOF/Cu2+1O exhibited excellent electrochemical attributes relative to Cu(OH)2 and Cu-MOF/Cu2+1O. Fig. 8b and c portrays the comparative CV and GCD curves of the as-prepared electrodes at a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1 and a current density of 2 mA cm−2 respectively. Broad CV peaks and appearance of redox peaks highlight the successful coupling of the MOF and battery-type material. Virtually symmetrical and non-linear GCD curves represent the battery-type capacitor with excellent coulombic efficiency. In Cu-MOF/Cu2+1O, the appearance of redox peaks was related to the conversion of Cu species to Cu+ and Cu2+ and is presented as eqn (1)–(4). Interestingly, the introduction of Co species leads to the appearance of additional redox peaks which was attributed to the transformation of Co2+, Co3+, and Co4+. The composite exhibited an excellent cycling stability of 97.26% at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 in 6 M KOH electrolyte after 5k cycles. Cu2O + 2OH− ↔ 2CuO + H2O + 2e−(1) Cu2O + H2O + 2OH− ↔ 2Cu(OH)2 + 2e−(2) CuOH + OH− ↔ Cu(OH)2 + e−(3) CuOH + OH− ↔ CuO + H2O + e−(4)

A possible explanation for the outstanding merits of Co/Cu-MOF/Cu2+1O is discussed below and is schematically illustrated in Fig. 8d. (a) Copper foam exhibits a 3D scaffold (like Ni foam) with a high surface area which can be utilized to fabricate materials with high mass loading. (b) Direct synthesis of Co/Cu-MOF/Cu2+1O reduces the dead mass leading to efficient electron mobility. (c) Strong adhesion of functional materials on copper foam results in excellent cycling stability. (d) Existence of defects and crystalline nanodomains provides an enhanced internal electric field and better charge transfer driving force.
The use of an organic solvent under solvothermal conditions is not safe and goes against the principles of “green synthesis”. Much effort has been made to address the concerns stated above. Among these, Zheng et al.65 initially identified a new approach for growing Cu2+1O (Cu2O with metal excess defects) on Cu-MOF clusters. A diverse morphology and nanostructure of Cu2+1O@Cu-MOFs using Cu(OH)2 nanorods as both a precursor and a template were prepared by exposing them to sublimated terephthalic acid (PTA) ligand gas. The development of Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF on copper foam (Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF/CF) was carried out using a two-step technique. In the first step, Cu(OH)2 was prepared through in situ surface oxidation by using a mixed aqueous solution of (NH4)2·S2O8 and NaOH. The conversion of Cu(OH)2 nanorod arrays to Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF was done in the second stage using a vapor-phase synthetic method. Upon reaching the temperature associated with the sublimation point of PTA, the PTA powder sublimated into its gaseous form, thus, changing Cu(OH)2 to Cu2+1O. The coordination process between PTA and Cu ions was used to convert Cu2+1O into Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF with the PTA gas diffusing into the surface of Cu2+1O. This simple vapor-phase technique was used to generate Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF directly on the skeleton surface of copper foam (Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF/CF). Cu2+1O on copper foam (Cu2+1O/CF) was also prepared as a comparative study. When compared to the Cu(OH)2/CF and Cu2+1O/CF electrodes, the optimized oriented Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF on copper foam (Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF/CF) electrode has a higher specific capacitance (2.5 F cm−2versus 0.8 F and 0.9 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2). To identify the double-layer and pseudocapacitive contributions in the Cu-MOF, Cu2+1O@CF, and Cu2+1@Cu-MOF, a potential sweep method is utilized. As shown in Fig. 8e, for Cu(OH)2 39.8% of the total current comes from double-layer contribution, whereas for Cu2+1O@CF (Fig. 8f) the value is significantly lower (19.6%). However, for Cu2+1@Cu-MOF (Fig. 8g) the contribution from the double layer and pseudocapacitance is approximately in equal proportion. The outstanding performance was attributed to the synergistic effect between surface-controlled contribution from the Cu-MOF and pseudocapacitive charge contribution from Cu2+1O. Additionally, the closer link between the vertically oriented and hierarchical structural arrays of Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF clusters and copper foam also played a pivotal role in yielding high specific capacity.
(e). Oriented MOF/graphene composites
Graphene aerogel (GA) is well known for its 3D conducting network which allows optimized ionic diffusion. Despite its high surface area and excellent conductivity, it shows poor capacitance due to its electric double-layer capacitive (EDLC) nature. Hence, the integration of a 3D conducting network with oriented grown MOFs may create highly efficient electrode materials. A controlled and homogeneous MOF/GA composite with the appropriate metal ion and organic linker may achieve high-performance SCs. Recently, Liu et al.66 reported an oriented Fe-based MOF grown on a 3D network of GA (denoted as GAMOF) and spindle-like MOF for SCs as shown schematically in Fig. 9a. Oriented GAMOF(Fe3+) was first prepared by the introduction of Fe3+ into graphene oxide in an aqueous solution. The electrophilic Fe3+ ion may be linked with the π-electron in graphene by the p–π contact, which plays a crucial role in the controlled and oriented MOFs. The electronic band structure of graphene can be altered due to the induced strong Fe3+ doping. Benzenedicarboxylate was used as a bidentate coordination carboxylate group for providing strong metal–ligand bonds and flexible connectivity of MOF structures. The oriented GAMOF(Fe3+) exhibited a superior specific capacitance of 353 F g−1 at a current density of 20 A g−1. The superior capacitance, reliable cycling stability, and rate capability were due to the strong synergetic interaction and the uniform distribution of the GAMOF(Fe3+) composite.

Graphene, a single layer of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, has been the subject of extensive investigation for electrochemical capacitors because of its remarkable attributes such as high electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, and superior electron mobility.67 However, strong π–π interactions of graphene sheets lead to a minimal surface area and hinder ion diffusion. Several strategies including fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) graphene nanocomposites have been tried to develop non-stacking graphene materials.68 Losic et al.69 demonstrated the fabrication of a highly porous 3D structure based on the nanocomposite of HKUST-1 (MOF-199) and graphene oxide (GO). The synthesis process comprises mechanical grinding of HKUST-1 microrods with GO and forms a 3D composite. Subsequently, the composite was subjected to a CO2 laser scribing to transform GO into reduced graphene oxide (L-rGO). A representative cyclic voltammogram of L-rGO and HKUST-1/L-rGO is shown in Fig. 9b. The composite yielded a specific capacitance of 390 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. HKUST-1/L-rGO retained 97.8% of its initial capacitance at 10 A g−1 after 5k cycles (Fig. 9c). A symmetrical device was also assembled to test its practical application and the device yielded an excellent power density of 8037.5 W kg−1 at an energy density of 22.3 W h kg−1. Likewise, other reports related to MOFs have been studied as well for various applications such as alkaline water oxidation electrocatalysis,70 catalysts,71 H2/CO2 separation,72 membranes,73 and many more. The three-electrode electrochemical measurements have been summarized in Table 1.

3. Conclusion and prospects
MOFs are a growing family of porous crystalline materials composed of metal ion nodes linked by organic linkers. MOFs are intrinsically focused as energy storage materials because of the variable electroactive sites that host transition-metal ions and the likeliness of having an extremely high surface area. In most cases, MOFs have been used as a sacrificial template for the syntheses of various metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal selenides, metal phosphides/phosphates, metal tellurides, carbon, and/or other composite materials. Such materials can be prepared through calcination or annealing that involves high temperature or use of acid and may intricate the basic structures of MOFs. In powdery MOFs, the addition of the binder and other additives will hinder the SC performance due to lower conductivity, poorer electroactive sites, and production of the dead volume within the active materials. As a result, the direct and oriented growth of MOFs for SC electrode materials has been significantly focused. Oriented MOFs offer fast access of electrolyte ions throughout the structure, elimination of binders, excellent adhesion between the active material and current collector, and excellent stability. The detailed advantages/disadvantages of oriented and aggregated MOFs have been summarized in Fig. 10.
 Fig. 10  (a) Schematic illustration of the advantages/disadvantages of oriented vs. aggregated MOFs. 
Despite these advantages of oriented MOFs, there are still some challenges and prospective studies that should be considered for oriented MOFs as discussed below:
(a) The crystallographic axes (a, b, and c) should be considered in future reports to investigate the heteroepitaxial growth of MOFs.
(b) Substrates play an important role in directing the growth of MOFs. Thus, the length of the organic linkers for matching lattices of the base materials should be investigated carefully.
(c) The inherent charge transfer kinetics on the interface/junction between substrates/active-materials and oriented MOFs should be considered.
(d) MOF-based precursors and the substrate availability, cost, large-scale applications, and scalable manufacturing should be considered.
(e) Other facile and safe approaches should be studied instead of conventional hydrothermal and solvothermal approaches for oriented MOF fabrication.
(f) The final oriented product should be optimized. Although a number of oriented MOFs have been reported, the diversity in the composition and structure remains insufficiently evaluated. Optimization of the synthesis approach, use of various solvents, and high temperature and pressure should be considered for a green, clean, and safe environment.
(g) Mechanisms of how the oriented MOF is synthesized, physicochemical properties, and factors affecting the structures should thoroughly be investigated. In addition, advanced characterization experiments, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, C-HAADF-STEM, electron energy loss spectroscopy, in situ XRD, in situ Raman, and in situ XPS should be used for correct and deep understanding.
(h) Mechanisms involving ion facilitation in electrochemical measurements, phase changes, heterostructures, p–n heterojunctions, and appropriate reactions should be investigated and provided in future studies.
(i) For practical use, flexibility and stretchability of devices could also be considered. Moreover, safe, and potential electrolytes with optimized concentrations should be investigated.
(j) Great efforts have been devoted to MOF-based electrode materials in the past few years, thus the understanding of the mechanism of MOFs becomes deeper, and a complete picture is far from being accomplished.
(k) Due to the choice of substrates, oriented growth is more complicated in terms of the mechanism and structure formation, and thus it should be understood well.
(l) A number of important applications of MOFs are already being investigated. Thus, mass production with a reasonable price and the synthesis approach with better quality will be critically essential towards industrial-scale production.
(m) For SC applications, misconception and misinterpretation should be avoided. For more details, the previously reported review can be explored.76–78
(n) Finally, both the theoretical and experimental investigation of MOFs are essential in further understanding how MOFs work, such as their structure and formation.
Overall, we believe that this review will be extended in energy storage device related applications and other unexplored research fields. Likewise, the future prospects entailed in this mini review will provide directions in understanding and developing MOF properties and structures towards different applications.
