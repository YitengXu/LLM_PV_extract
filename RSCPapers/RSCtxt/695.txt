    , Accepted 7th October 2022First published on 10th October 2022AbstractReducing the toxicity of hybrid halide perovskites is critical in the path toward perovskite photovoltaic commercialization. In this regard, Sn-based halide perovskite compounds, especially inorganic CsSnI3, are emerging as promising alternatives. However, the instability of Sn-based perovskites originated from Sn2+ oxidation remains a serious problem that needs to be addressed. Herein, we propose a facile yet effective galvanic displacement reaction (GDR) method to solve this issue. Using zinc metal powder as an example, the Sn4+ species can be spontaneously and completely reduced via the GDR in precursor solutions in a short time. Meanwhile, this procedure introduces a certain number of external divalent Zn2+ metal ions into the inorganic CsSnI3 perovskite lattice. The introduced Zn2+ is found to weaken the adsorption of water and oxygen molecules on the CsSnI3 crystalline surface, therefore enhancing the ambient stability of the resulting perovskite films. A power conversion efficiency of 8.27% was achieved for inorganic CsSnI3 mesoporous solar cells using a fully printable TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency for fully inorganic CsSnI3-based mesoporous devices reported so far. Moreover, the devices without encapsulation maintained 86.3% of the initial efficiency after being stored in ambient air for 216 hours.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25%, representing one of the extremely promising printable photovoltaic systems for renewable energy.1,2 However, the toxicity of lead (Pb) contaminants and the instability of volatile organic components of hybrid perovskites remain critical issues that impede the commercialization of this emerging technology.3–5 Therefore, it is imperative to explore lead-free perovskite-type light absorbers with high stability. Recently, low-toxic and thermally stable inorganic tin halide perovskites have attracted wide attention in the photovoltaic field to replace organic–inorganic hybrid lead perovskites. Among them, the inorganic CsSnI3 perovskite is an outstanding option due to its highly structural and thermodynamic stability,6,7 ideal optical bandgap (∼1.30 eV)8,9 as well as high electron dimensionality10 and low exciton binding energy.11,12
Unfortunately, the photovoltaic performance of tin-based perovskite devices largely lags behind that of their mentor lead-based PSCs.13–15 The biggest challenge currently being faced toward fulfilling the potential of all-inorganic CsSnI3 perovskite is the easy oxidation of divalent Sn2+ to tetravalent Sn4+ due to the lone pair electrons in the 5s orbital of Sn2+ being extremely easy to lose.16 A resultant high defect density and low minority carrier lifetime also compromise the device intrinsic stability and optoelectronic properties.17,18 Numerous additives have been attempted in alleviation of this problem, such as the introduction of Sn source compensators (SnF2,19,20 SnCl2,21 SnBr2,22 and SnI2 (ref. 23)) or reducing agents (hydrazine,24 piperazine25 and hypophosphorous acid26) into perovskite precursors to suppress Sn2+ oxidation. However, these methods suffer from disadvantages such as impacting the perovskite film morphology and introducing highly toxic reducing agents.27 The most fatal thing is that the above methods are incapable of reducing Sn4+ to Sn2+ in the precursor solution completely. It has been documented that a small amount of Sn4+ can still be formed in the precursor solution before film preparation.28–30 Without doubt, even a small amount of Sn4+ doping (molar proportion <1%) in ASnI3 (where A is a monovalent cation) perovskites can cause serious p-type self-doping and render them inactive as solar photovoltaic absorbers.31 Therefore, although most tin-containing perovskites are processed in an inert atmosphere, as a matter of fact, the oxidation problem of Sn2+ is still the main factor that limits their efficiency. A complete elimination of Sn4+ in the precursor solution will be a new research direction for the study of Sn-based perovskites.
In this work, we developed a simple but effective method for CsSnI3 perovskite film preparation according to a galvanic displacement reaction (GDR). The GDR is a redox process occurring between metal and metal ions (i.e., Sn4+) in solution, driven by the difference between redox potentials. Benefiting from this strong driving force, Sn4+ in the precursor solution can be completely eliminated. We introduced environment-friendly zinc metal powder with proper chemical reduction potential as an effective reductant to spontaneously eliminate Sn4+ in CsSnI3 precursor solution completely, meanwhile introducing external divalent Zn2+ metal ions in the resulting CsSnI3 perovskite lattice. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the introduction of external divalent Zn2+ metal ions through the GDR weakens the adsorption of water and oxygen on the CsSnI3 surface, therefore enhancing the ambient stability of the films. Through this approach, a record PCE of 8.27% can be achieved in CsSnI3-based mesoporous solar cells using a printable TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon framework. It is worth mentioning that this device architecture offers additional advantages to CsSnI3 PSCs, including good stability under ambient conditions and low manufacturing cost for commercialization. Moreover, the optimized device maintained 86.3% of its initial efficiency after being stored in ambient air for 216 hours without encapsulation, demonstrating the remarkably improved antioxidative and ambient stability offered by GDR treatment. This finding represents the first achievement of tin-based PSCs stored in ambient air without encapsulation and also the first attempt to prepare all-inorganic Sn-based perovskites utilizing the galvanic displacement reaction with heterogeneous elements.
Results and discussion
Currently, the main problem that restricts the development of CsSnI3-based PSCs is the easy oxidation of Sn2+. Although the whole fabrication processes can be handled in an inert atmosphere, the devices still exhibit poor performance due to the fact that a small amount of oxidation products already pre-exist in the precursor solution. The oxidation of Sn2+ is most likely to occur in the precursor state, mainly in three ways. The first is the self-disproportionation of Sn2+, which transfers to Sn4+ and Sn0.28,29 The second is being oxidized by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), a commonly used solvent for Sn-based perovskites.30,31 The third is being oxidized by the very small amount of oxygen mixed in precursor solution. Herein, a galvanic displacement reaction between the oxidants (Sn4+, for instance) and metal powders with strong chemical reduction potential is suggested to eliminate Sn4+ in the precursor solution completely. A typical GDR is essentially a redox process of metals (reducing agent) and metal cations (oxidizing agent) in solution, driven by the electrochemical potential difference between them.32–34 Table S1† lists the standard redox potentials of common divalent metal elements that can reduce Sn4+ cations.35 Literally, the excessive ionicity and electronegativity of alkaline earth metal cations (such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+) lead to large band gaps and localized band edges of perovskites, which are unfavourable as optoelectronic materials.36–38 They are also inappropriate as reducing agents for metals with various oxidation states such as Cr, Fe, and Co and highly toxic metals such as Mn and Pb. The non-toxic zinc element stands out among the above-discussed metal elements due to its stable valence, suitable ionicity and electronegativity. Therefore, zinc metal powder was selected as the reducing agent in this work. When employing this method to prepare Sn precursor solution, the driving force for the occurrence of the GDR is the difference in the electrochemical potential between Zn0/Zn2+ (0.76 V) and Sn2+/Sn4+ (−0.15 V) redox couples. Due to a large driving force of 0.91 V, metallic elemental Zn atoms in the form of powders can be oxidized in the presence of Sn4+ species in precursor solution according to the GDR equation of Zn0 + Sn4+ → Zn2+ + Sn2+ along with a gradual displacement of Sn4+ ions by the Zn2+ ions in the precursor solution.
The GDR process was performed by adding zinc powder to the precursor solution and stirring at 50 °C for 6 hours. Then, the reaction mixture was filtered to remove the excess Zn powders from the solution. Fig. 1b shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra and the corresponding optical images (the inset) of perovskite precursor solution before and after zinc powder was added. For the solution after adding zinc powder, the UV-Vis absorption spectra red-shifted along with a visible color change from dark yellow to light yellow, indicating a significant reduction of Sn4+ species in the solution.39 Furthermore, in order to quantitatively analyse the GDR process, the evolution of exact Sn4+ and Zn2+ contents in the precursor solution was determined through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurements as shown in Fig. 1c (details are listed in Table S2 and S3†). Initially, the molar proportion of Sn4+ in the precursor solution was calculated to be about 5%. Within the procedure of the GDR, the concentration of Sn4+ in the precursor solution gradually decreased while that of Zn2+ stoichiometrically increased until a saturated value (i.e., 5% herein). The content of Zn2+ entered into the precursor depends on the initial Sn4+ content in precursor solution. In this work, about 5% of the Zn2+ ions can be introduced into the precursor solution when the zinc powder completely eliminates the Sn4+ ions. In order to explore the plausible formation of inorganic CsSn1−xZnxI3 perovskite, we further evaluated the formation energy by considering different cases with DFT calculations, in which the externally introduced Zn2+ are intentionally positioned at different sites. As shown in Fig. 1d, the red and black curves represent the formation energies of introducing Zn2+ at the B-sites and interstitial sites, respectively. The calculated formation energy for CsSnI3 (30.58 meV per atom) is indicated by horizontal black dashed lines. Obviously, the formation energy of Zn2+ at B-sites is the lowest when the introduced Zn2+ molar proportion is less than 5%. This indicates that during the film formation process, all Zn2+ ions in the precursor solution exist in the B-sites to form CsSn1−xZnxI3 perovskite. Hereby, it should be noted that the addition of metallic elemental Zn powder has two functions: reducing agent and substituting agent. In the following discussion, Sn-based perovskite with 5 mol% Zn2+ (the molar proportion of Zn2+ in the B-site cations) through the GDR was abbreviated as GDR-Zn (5).

Fig. 2a presents X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the control CsSnI3 film and GDR-Zn (5) film. Both films exhibit strong XRD pattern peaks at 14.41° and 29.08°, corresponding to the (101) and (202) crystal planes of black-γ-CsSnI3 perovskite. The peak intensities of the (121), (022), (324) and (224) planes for the GDR-Zn (5) film were significantly suppressed. Similar phenomena were also observed at different Zn concentrations (Fig. S1†), which proves the more controllable crystal growth and improved crystallization quality of the GDR-Zn films. In addition, there is a small gradual shift of the (101) and (202) characteristic peaks toward a higher 2-theta value in the GDR-Zn (5) film (Fig. 2b), attributing to the successful replacement of Sn2+ (ionic radius 1.15 Å) by Zn2+ (with smaller ionic radius of 0.74 Å) at the B-site of CsSnI3. Fig. 2c and e exhibit transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of control CsSnI3 and GDR-Zn (5) compounds along with their fast Fourier transform (FFT) in the insets. Lattice fringe image in TEM can be informed using Bragg's law as described by eqn (1): nλ = 2dsinθ(1)where n is a positive integer, λ is the wavelength of the incident wave, d is the interplanar spacing in the crystal and θ is the glancing angle of incidence. Only the crystal planes that satisfy the Bragg diffraction equation can diffract electron beams and appear in TEM images. In order to accurately calculate the interplanar spacing, the TEM images were refined using Fourier filtering and reconstruction techniques (details are shown in Fig. S2†). Fig. 2d and f display the results of the refinement, and the interplanar spacing is calculated in the inset. The obtained interplanar spacing of 3.067 Å ± 0.002 Å and 6.136 Å ± 0.002 Å (Fig. 2d and S3b) matches well with the lattice distance of the (202) and (101) crystallographic planes of intrinsic CsSnI3 perovskite. In comparison, the interplanar spacing of the (202) and (101) crystal planes of the GDR-Zn (5) perovskite changes to 3.059 Å ± 0.002 Å and 6.124 ± 0.002 Å (Fig. 2f and S3d). These reduced interplanar spacing values in GDR-Zn (5) perovskite are consistent with the shift of the corresponding characteristic peaks in the aforementioned XRD measurement (Fig. 2b), attributing to the reduced lattice constant due to the small ionic radius of Zn2+ to Sn2+. Considering that the material morphology has a great influence on device performance, we investigated the effect of different Zn concentrations on the surface morphology of the CsSnI3 perovskite films. Fig. S4† compares the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the CsSnI3 films and GDR-Zn films. Apparently, ignorable changes in the film surface and crystalline grains were observed during the film transformation. Fig. S5† presents XPS measurements of Sn 3d bands of CsSnI3 and GDR-Zn (5) perovskite films, respectively. The deconvolution of Sn 3d XPS spectra of the films into Sn4+ and Sn2+ species shows the binding energy at 487.2, 495.8 eV and 486.5, 495.0 eV, respectively. Benefiting from a complete elimination of Sn4+ ions in the precursor solution by zinc powder, the proportion of Sn4+ in GDR-Zn (5) films is significantly lower than that in the control CsSnI3 films.

To examine the photovoltaic performances of GDR-derived CsSnI3 films, we fabricated solar cells with the printable mesoscopic framework of TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon (Fig. S7†). It is generally accepted that this mesoscopic all-inorganic framework can alleviate device instability issues caused by the hydrophilicity and volatility of organic materials. Fig. 3a shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurement curves of the champion-performing devices based on control CsSnI3 and GDR-Zn (5) perovskite films measured in reverse scan and forward scan directions. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S4.† Obviously, the control device showed an inferior PCE of 4.93% in reverse scan, with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.44 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 18.72 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 59.80%. In comparison, the PSC using the GDR-Zn (5) absorber exhibits obviously enhanced performance showing a total PCE of 8.27%, with a VOC of 0.52 V, a JSC of 22.93 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69.40%. Specifically, an evident VOC improvement from 0.44 to 0.52 V is attributed to the lower Sn4+ content and lower trap density of the perovskite film.40,41 To the best of our knowledge, this is the record efficiency for fully inorganic Sn-based mesoporous devices reported so far, which is shown in Fig. S8 and Table S5.† Fig. S9† presents the steady-state output of the GDR-Zn (5)-based PSC at the maximum power point in air. A stabilized output of 8.20% at 0.40 V toward the 300 s scan was achieved, which is close to the PCE value acquired from the J–V curve. Moreover, the photocurrent hysteresis decreased from 3.37% to 0.80% for the PSC using the GDR-Zn (5) absorber. Fig. 3b presents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding PSCs with and without Zn addition. In particular, the device based on the GDR-Zn (5) absorber exhibited improved spectra response, explaining its higher photocurrent. The integrated JSC values of the GDR-Zn (5) device and control CsSnI3 device were calculated to be 21.87 mA cm−2 and 17.94 mA cm−2, respectively. Both are well matched with the measured values of JSC. Meanwhile, the PCE distribution (20 cells per type) of the PSCs with and without Zn addition is shown in Fig. 3c, which further proves that the introduction of Zn effectively improves overall device performance. To demonstrate the dual function of the reducing agent and substituting agent of GDR-Zn (5), we fabricated devices based on the perovskite layer using equimolar ZnI2 (namely common-5ZnI2) instead of zinc powder, and tested their photovoltaic performances. It should be noted that herein the addition of ZnI2 has the sole function of a substituting agent (to replace Sn2+ in CsSnI3 to form CsZn1−xSnxI3 perovskite). Therefore, the concentration of Sn4+ in the precursor solution should not be decreased. As a matter of course, these devices exhibited PCEs far below those of the GDR-based devices with identical zinc contents (Fig. S10†).

The inset is the equivalent circuit of the devices. 
The material properties of CsSnI3 perovskite such as defect density and carrier density are strongly associated with the Sn4+ content. The anti-oxidation function of the GDR method largely suppresses Sn2+ loss during oxidization of Sn2+ to Sn4+, which drastically reduces the Sn vacancy trap density. Fig. 3d presents the dark J–V characteristics of the devices using the control CsSnI3, the GDR-Zn (5), and the common-5ZnI2 based CsSnI3 absorbers. We observed that the GDR-Zn (5) device achieved the lowest leakage current density of 1.2 × 10−3 mA cm−2 at a reverse bias of −0.3 V, whereas the control CsSnI3 and common-5ZnI2 based devices showed large leakage current densities of 7.8 × 10−3 and 1.1 × 10−2 mA cm−2. The lower leakage current density represents the corresponding lower bulk defect density in the perovskite film, therefore leading to suppressed charge recombination and enhanced charge extraction capacity.42 We further evaluated the trap density by measuring the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) of the devices using a structure of ITO/SnO2/CsSnI3/PCBM/Au (Fig. 3e). The trap-state density can be calculated using eqn (2) (2)where Nt is the trap-state density, VTEL represents the trap-filled limit voltage, ε0 and ε are the relative dielectric constant and the vacuum permittivity, q is the elementary charge and L is the film thickness.43 The calculated trap density of the GDR-Zn (5) film (3.37 × 1018 cm−3) was lower than that of common-5ZnI2 (4.89 × 1018 cm−3) and control CsSnI3 (5.51 × 1018 cm−3) films attributed to the reducing-function by introducing zinc powder. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy characterization was performed to further verify the reduced trap states and examine the photocarrier dynamics in the GDR-Zn (5) film (Fig. S11†). The average PL decay lifetime of the GDR-Zn (5), common-5ZnI2 and control CsSnI3 films was calculated to be 10.03 ns, 4.18 ns and 3.98 ns, respectively (Table S6†). The promoted average PL decay lifetime of the GDR-Zn (5) film indicates that the charge recombination can be effectively suppressed due to the reduced defect states, which is consistent with the aforementioned SCLC measurement results. We also investigated the interfacial charge transport processes of the PSCs by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 3f exhibits Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuit model at a bias of −0.4 V. The resulting frequency analysis shows a semicircle in the Nyquist diagram, which corresponds to the carrier recombination process between the perovskite layer and charge selective contact interfaces.44 We fitted the EIS plots with the equivalent circuit consisting of series, parallel resistances, and parallel capacitance, where the parallel resistance is the recombination resistance (Rrec). The GDR-Zn (5) device shows the largest Rrec and longest interfacial recombination lifetime τ (267.3 Ω, 14.03 μs) compared to that of the common-5ZnI2 based device (204.43 Ω, 11.98 μs) and control device (155.6Ω, 9.99 μs), indicating that the interfacial charge nonradiative recombination loss is significantly reduced.45–47 These results suggest that the GDR method provides a longer carrier lifetime with less trap density and suppressed carrier recombination, together leading to an improvement in device performance.
Device stability is another crucial parameter that determines whether PSCs can be commercialized. All-inorganic PSCs possess obvious advantages in thermal stability.15,48,49 We first investigated the ambient stability of the GDR-Zn (5), common-ZnI2 and control CsSnI3 perovskite films. Fig. 4a presents XRD spectra and optical images of the degraded films after being exposed to ambient air at room temperature with a humidity of 60% for 12 h. The complete evolution processes are shown in Fig. S12.† After 12 h of storage in ambient air, the XRD patterns of GDR-Zn (5) perovskite films show no obvious change, while SnO2 peaks at 25° and 34° appeared in the common-5ZnI2 perovskite film. In contrast, the control CsSnI3 perovskite film has been completely degraded to SnO2. For Sn-based perovskite, the instability is mainly caused by Sn vacancy defects formed due to the oxidation of Sn2+.50 Defect states in perovskite films accelerate their degradation when subjected to external stresses such as oxygen, humidity, light, and applied voltage. We further performed chemical state analysis and elemental analysis of the films using XPS and accordingly calculated the Sn4+ molar ratio as illustrated in Fig. 4b. As shown, the GDR-Zn (5) possesses the lowest initial Sn4+ molar ratio due to the strong reduction functionality of zinc powder. The Sn4+ ratio of the common-ZnI2 and control CsSnI3 films quickly rose after being exposed to air, while the Sn4+ value of the GDR-Zn (5) film remained almost unchanged. These results indicate that the GDR method can improve the intrinsic stability of CsSnI3 perovskite under storage conditions by eliminating Sn4+ defects. Fig. 4c shows the time-dependent evolution of normalized PCE for the unencapsulated PSCs stored at 25 °C under ambient air conditions with a humidity of 60%. The GDR-based PSC maintained 86% of its initial PCE after 216 h of storage in air, whereas the control and common-ZnI2-based devices only maintained 31% and 70% of their initial efficiency, respectively. Moreover, the GDR-Zn (5)-based PSC exhibited good long-term stability during storage in an argon-filled glovebox within 30 days and maintained 90% of its initial efficiency, as shown in Fig. S13.† It should be noticed that the common-ZnI2-based samples exhibited significantly better stability than the control samples both in devices and in thin films. Therefore, we speculate that apart from elimination of Sn4+ defects, the introduction of Zn2+ in CsSnI3 crystal lattices is also helpful for the improvement of perovskite stability.

To verify the above conjecture, we further investigated the potential mechanism of the introduction of Zn2+ into CsSnI3 crystal lattices for improving environmental stability through DFT calculations. The adsorption of water molecules or oxygen molecules is generally considered to be the first step in the oxidation pathway of gases and the most important step in studying the environmentally stable properties of perovskite films. We simulated the adsorption of molecular H2O and O2 on the control and GDR-Zn (5) perovskite surfaces using the DFT method, in which the most easily exposed (202) surface of black-γ-CsSnI3 was cleaved according to the XRD results. To determine the most stable plane, we considered the (202) surfaces with different possible terminals and calculated the corresponding surface energy using the following formula: Esurface = (Eslab − N·Ebulk)/2A(3)where Eslab and Ebulk represent the energies of the surface slab and bulk unit cell, respectively, N is the number of unit cells included in the periodical slab, and A is the surface area. Fig. S14† illustrates the slab models and the corresponding calculated energy for the (202) surface with different terminals. Among them, the (202) surface with the SnI2 terminal has the lowest surface energy (3.09 meV Å−2). Therefore, we constructed a five-layer slab of CsSnI3 (202) surfaces with the SnI2 terminal in the following work. We thus selected four highly symmetric sites (Sn-top site, I-top site, Sn–I bridge site, and the hollow site) for H2O and O2 molecule adsorption on the surface, as shown in Fig. 5a. The adsorption energy can be evaluated by using: Eads = Etotal − Eslab − Emolecule(4)where Etotal, Eslab and Emolecule are the total energies of the surface adsorbed with H2O (or O2), the clean surface, and the adsorbate molecule, respectively. The position with the smallest adsorption energy means the most stable adsorption site. The detailed corresponding calculation results of adsorption energy are listed in Table S7.† The best adsorption sites for H2O and O2 molecules are the Sn-top and hollow sites, respectively (Fig. 5b and c). To further analyse the adsorption process, the equilibrium distance (d0), the Mulliken charge (q0) and the adsorption energy (Eads) were analyzed and are listed in Table 1, in which the equilibrium distance d0 represents the average distance between the adsorbed molecule and the nearest substrate Sn atom and the Mulliken charge q0 represents the amount of electron transfer between the adsorbed molecule and the surface. For the case of adsorption of molecular H2O, the adsorption energy was calculated to be −0.781 eV and the optimized O–Sn equilibrium distance d0 to be 2.722 Å (Fig. 5b). The calculation result of Mulliken charge q0 indicates that the H2O molecule serves as an electron acceptor and obtains 0.295 electrons from the CsSnI3 surface in the adsorption process. For the case of O2 adsorption, the calculated adsorption energy and average O–Sn equilibrium distance d0 are −0.326 eV and 5.154 Å, respectively. The calculation result of the Mulliken charge indicates that the O2 molecule obtains 0.178 electrons from the CsSnI3 surface. We further calculated the Eads of H2O and O2 on the Zn2+-substituted CsSnI3 surface. Table S8† summarizes the calculated Eads. The adsorption energies of H2O and O2 are the lowest at the Zn-top (Zn substituted Sn) and hollow sites as shown in Fig. 5d and e. A reduction in adsorption energy for H2O (from −0.781 eV to −0.541 eV) and O2 (from −0.326 eV to −0.286 eV) indicates that the Zn substitution weakens the adsorption effect for H2O and O2 molecules on the CsSnI3 surface. Moreover, for H2O adsorption, the O–Zn equilibrium distance d0 is increased by 0.209 Å and the Mulliken charge q0 is reduced by 0.031 e. This indicates that the interaction between H2O and the Zn2+-substituted CsSnI3 surface is weakened. Similarly, for O2 adsorption, the equilibrium distance d0 is increased by 0.170 Å and the Mulliken charge q0 is reduced by 0.012 e. Therefore, the Zn2+-substitution in CsSnI3 crystal lattices can reduce the electron transfer number and the adsorption energy of H2O and O2, therefore offering highly environmental stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we reported a novel method via the galvanic displacement reaction, demonstrated by using zinc powder as a reductant, for improving the efficiency and stability of CsSnI3 PSCs. When added into the CsSnI3 precursor, zinc powder can completely reduce Sn4+, meanwhile introduce external divalent Zn2+ metal ions into the inorganic perovskite lattice to weaken the adsorption of water and oxygen on the CsSnI3 surface, therefore enhancing the ambient stability of the resulting perovskite film. As a result, the CsSnI3-based PSCs using a mesoscopic metal-oxide framework presented a PCE of 8.27% with excellent ambient stability. The GDR-Zn-based devices retained 86.3% of their initial PCEs after being stored in air for 216 hours. This research provides an important way for achieving high-performance and environmentally stable all-inorganic CsSnI3 PSCs.
