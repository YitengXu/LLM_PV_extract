    , Accepted 6th July 2017First published on 6th July 2017AbstractIn this paper, a simple colloidal crystal-templating method assisted by a hydrothermal process has been proposed to prepare novel three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction photocatalysts. The photoactivities of all the obtained samples were measured by the photodecomposition of rhodamine B (RhB), the photoreduction of Cr(VI) and photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting. In comparison with pure SnS2 nanosheets and 3DOM TiO2, the 3DOM TiO2@SnS2 sample with a Sn/Ti molar ratio of 7.5:100 showed the highest photocatalytic activity for wastewater purification (kapp for RhB solution = 0.035 min−1 and for Cr6+ solution = 0.0845 min−1) and hydrogen generation under visible light irradiation. By means of ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, transient photocurrent spectra, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and photocatalytic experiments, a suggested mechanism for the charge generation and transfer in the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction was proposed. The improved charge separation and enhanced photocatalytic activity for the as-prepared TiO2@SnS2 composition can be attributed to the well-defined 3DOM heterojunction structure and the spatial transfer of the visible-light excited high energy electrons of SnS2 to TiO2. This work will provide a novel route to prepare highly active heterojunction photocatalysts and a new insight into the study of electron migration paths in TiO2@SnS2 composites.
1. Introduction
Wastewater purification and H2 generation from water splitting using solar-light-driven photocatalysts have attracted fast growing attention, since global environmental pollution and the energy crisis became serious problems all over the world.1–3 As one of the most important IV–VI semiconductors with a narrow band gap of about 2.2 eV, two-dimensional (2D) tin disulfide (SnS2) is popular with researchers due to its special physicochemical properties of low toxicity, inexpensiveness and good chemical stability in acid aqueous solution.4 SnS2 has been shown to have potential applications in the field of photocatalysis,4,5 sensors,6 solar cells,7 and lithium-ion batteries.8 In order to efficiently improve its photocatalytic efficiencies, recently, extensive research efforts have been devoted to design and fabricate SnS2 photocatalysts with well-defined micro-nanostructures, research which is also expected to explore the relationship between SnS2 structure and photocatalytic performance. Thus far, various SnS2 nanostructures with different shapes have been prepared by a variety of synthetic routes.9–11 For example, Yu et al.3 fabricated monodisperse SnS2 nanosheets using a one-step solvothermal procedure in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Zhang et al.12 have reported the design and application of SnS2 nanocrystals by a size-tunable hydrothermal method, which showed excellent visible-light photoactivity for the reduction of aqueous Cr(VI). Sun et al.13 reported the synthesis of freestanding SnS2 single-layers with a three-atom thickness through an exfoliation strategy, and this material showed a visible-light conversion efficiency of 38.7%. However, after a closer look at the single semiconductor of SnS2, it is clear that its photocatalytic performance remains relatively low because of the rapid recapturing of electrons by holes,14 and thus the fabrication of SnS2-based photocatalysts with higher visible-light-driven activity is generally required but still presents a great challenge. Up until now, many researchers have developed various effective strategies to promote the efficient migration of photogenerated charge carriers in the SnS2 photocatalysts.15–18 Among these strategies, direct contact between two semiconductors to produce heterojunction photocatalysts has been widely studied due to the resultant gradient of potential between the two semiconductors, which is relatively favorable for the enhancement of photogenerated charge separation.19 It is well known that TiO2 has attracted much attention as an excellent photocatalytic material with a band gap of about 3.2 eV. Most importantly, it has been demonstrated that TiO2 and SnS2 with matched band potentials can form a unique heterostructure to develop a high efficiency photocatalytic system.20,21 For instance, Yang et al.22 used hydrothermal treatment to synthesize nano-sized SnS2/TiO2, which showed high performance in the degradation of methyl orange. Christoforidis et al.23 reported that TiO2's capacity to decompose gaseous diethylsulfide could be enhanced when decorated with a SnS2 nanosheet. Based on the above-mentioned studies, it can be found that TiO2 as a charge carrier separator played a vital role in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of SnS2@TiO2.
Three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) TiO2, as a novel multiporous structured photocatalyst, has attracted much attention due to its high specific surface area and the easy diffusion of reactant species.24 Notably, the advanced architecture of 3DOM with an interconnected macroporous network can provide numerous active sites to promote charge transfer and light harvesting.25,26 Inspired by the above analysis, the growth of SnS2 nanosheets on 3DOM TiO2 to construct 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 may present a huge advantage to further improve the photocatalytic activity of SnS2. Therefore, in this work we report a facile and efficient route to synthesize a 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction. In this type of advanced architecture, the 2D SnS2 nanosheet with thin thickness can provide shorter pathways to improve the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes to the reaction sites in the photocatalyst material.27 Moreover, the 3DOM structure with a uniformly distributed macroporous structure and high porosity can not only enhance the absorption, mass diffusion and removal of the reactant, but can also strongly promote the photon trapping capacity and electron transport ability.28 Therefore, the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 composite material would exhibit a significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity. The phase composition, crystalline structure, hierarchical porous architectures and surface properties of the as-prepared photocatalysts have been systematically investigated using a variety of techniques, and the activity of the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction was evaluated using the photocatalytic reduction of carcinogenic Cr(VI), the photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and hydrogen production from water splitting. Additionally, on the basis of the characterization and photocatalytic results, a possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism of the as-prepared composite was proposed.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of the photocatalyst

2.1.1 Preparation of the 3DOM TiO2. 
A well-arrayed poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) template was prepared by an emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization technique, described in detail in our previous studies.24,28 The 3DOM TiO2 was fabricated by the PMMA-template strategy and the typical procedure is as follows: 1.7 g tetrabutyl titanate was dissolved into 10 mL ethyl alcohol with 1 mL acetic acid under continuous stirring. Then, 20 mL water was added into the above-mentioned solution dropwise, and the pH of this solution was adjusted to 2 using the appropriate amount of nitric acid. Next, the resultant mixture was stirred constantly at room temperature overnight to obtain the transparent TiO2 precursor solution. 3 g PMMA was then immersed into the mixture for several hours and dried at 100 °C in the vacuum drying oven to make sure the transparent TiO2 precursor was completely absorbed. Finally, the sample was calcined at 400 °C for 3 h and thus pure 3DOM TiO2 was obtained. Furthermore, pure TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained by the same above-mentioned method without the addition of the PMMA template.


2.1.2 Synthesis of the SnS2 nanosheet and 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction. 
0.1 g 3DOM TiO2 was added into an aqueous solution of SnCl4·5H2O/L-cysteine (the molar ratio of SnCl4·5H2O/L-cysteine was 1:16). The mixed solution was then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 3 h. After filtration and washing with deionized water and ethanol several times, the resulting precipitant was dried at 60 °C overnight to finally obtain the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction. The samples were prepared with different Sn/Ti molar ratios of 5:100, 7.5:100 and 10:100, and the samples were denoted as ST-1, ST-2 and ST-3, respectively. For comparison, The ST-4 sample was prepared under the same conditions as the ST-2 sample only the TiO2 particles added did not have a 3DOM structure. We also prepared pure SnS2 nanosheets as a reference.

2.2 Characterization
The crystal phases of the photocatalysts were analyzed with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; SHIMADZU, Lab X XRD-6000), and the diffraction angle (2θ) was scanned from 15 °C to 80 °C. The morphology of the photocatalyst composites was detected with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, JSM-6700F). The inner structure was obtained through transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100). The optical properties were analyzed using a Hitachi U-4100 ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis) spectrometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded by a PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS980) and the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) properties were tested using a Bruker Biospin A300 spectrometer. The electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI 760D (Shanghai Chenhua Ltd) electrochemical workstation. Additionally, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution plots of the samples were tested by nitrogen adsorption–desorption apparatus (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), BELsorp).
2.3 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity

2.3.1 Pollutant degradation. 
The removal of organic pollution activity for the samples was tested by the photodegradation of 10 mg L−1 RhB solution with a 300 W Xenon lamp (NBeT, HSX-F300, Beijing) as a simulated visible light source (λ > 420 nm). In each photoreaction, 70 mL solution containing 10 mg L−1 of RhB and 70 mg photocatalyst was stirred for 40 min in a dark environment to ensure the establishment of an absorption–desorption equilibrium. After that, the photocatalytic reaction would happen when the continuously stirred solution was irradiated by visible light. As the photoreaction proceeded, 3 mL of the suspension was taken at certain time intervals (20 min) and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst. The residual concentration of RhB was analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-1900PPC, Shanghai, China).
Then, following the steps above, the photocatalytic activity for reducing the heavy metal pollutant Cr6+ (100 mg L−1) of the samples was determined. Moreover, in order to test the reusability of the photocatalyst, five cycles of the photoreduction of Cr6+ were performed and each cycle lasted 40 min. After each photoreaction, the residual reaction medium was centrifuged to remove the supernatant and the catalyst was dispersed again in 100 mg L−1 fresh Cr6+ solution under the same visible light irradiation.


2.3.2 H2 evolution from water splitting. 
Hydrogen production from water splitting over the as-prepared photocatalysts was carried out in a Pyrex reaction vessel under visible light. As a typical process, 0.05 g photocatalyst was dispersed in 50 mL water containing 0.5 mL 3 wt% H2PtCl6 solution with stirring for 30 min, and then 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 was added to the mixed solution. Prior to irradiation, the system was bubbled with highly pure nitrogen for 15 min to remove the air inside. After finishing the above work, photocatalytic hydrogen production was carried out and the amount of H2 generated was detected by gas chromatography (Beifen-Ruili, SP-2100A, China, N2 carrier).

3. Results
All the as-prepared photocatalysts were examined by XRD measurements to identify the crystalline phases. As shown in Fig. 1, the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized 3DOM TiO2 with different SnS2 coupling levels (ST-1 to ST-3) were in good agreement with JCPDS card 21-1272 and JCPDS card 21-1231, indicating that the obtained samples consist of monophasic crystalline anatase TiO2 and hexagonal berndtite SnS2. Moreover, gradually obvious diffraction peaks of SnS2 in the 3DOM heterojunction composition can be observed with an increase in the Sn4+ coupling level; it is thus inferred that SnS2 has been introduced onto the TiO2 surface and highly dispersed on the surface of TiO2, which is in accordance with the following SEM and TEM results.

The morphology of the samples is further investigated by SEM and TEM. Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of the pure 3DOM TiO2 sample. It can be clearly observed that the basic structure material of TiO2 is 3D-interconnected macroporous networks and each large pore is connected to six neighbouring voids. As a substrate material, 3DOM TiO2 can provide an increased active surface area for the significant improvement of the photocatalytic performance of the semiconductor catalyst. As shown in Fig. 2(i and j), pure SnS2 exhibits a typical aggregated structure, which is composed of many interconnected nanosheets with sizes of 300–500 nm. Fig. 2(c, e, and g) show the SEM images of the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 composites prepared with different mole ratios of Sn4+vs. Ti4+. All the as-obtained heterojunction compositions presented much better ordered macroporous structures and interconnected walls with a regular periodicity in the whole, indicating that the combination of SnS2 nanosheets on 3DOM TiO2 does not affect the three dimensionally macroporous structure of the TiO2@SnS2 heterojunction system. Compared with pure 3DOM TiO2 (Fig. 2b), the high-magnification SEM images of the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction in Fig. 2(d, f and h) revealed that the hydrothermally fabricated SnS2 nanosheets were highly scattered and lay close to the surface of the 3DOM TiO2, and with an increase in the amount of Sn4+, SnS2 nanosheets were clearly observed on the surface of 3DOM TiO2. It was thus deduced from the SEM analysis that the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 formed is a heterostructure rather than a simple mechanically mixed sample. Fig. 2k and l show the SEM images of the ST-4 sample. It can be seen that large numbers of SnS2 nanosheets combined with TiO2 particles to produce an aggregate structure.

The ST-2 sample with the highest photocatalytic activity is further studied by TEM and HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the structure of 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 shows a well-defined interconnected macroporous architecture, which is composed of many nanoparticles with sizes of about 10 nm. In addition, SnS2 nanosheets with lengths of around 170 nm and thicknesses of around 17 nm grew in random orientations and interweaved on the surface of the 3DOM TiO2. A few experimental studies have confirmed that the single-layer SnS2 is determined to be 0.61 nm,13 thus it can be inferred that the SnS2 nanosheets in the 3DOM heterojunction system are assembled in about 28 layers. The crystal planes and lattice fringes of the ST-2 sample can be analyzed with the HRTEM image (Fig. 3c). The results reveal that the interplanar distances of 0.352 nm and 0.278 nm were consistent with the d-spacing of the (101) planes of anatase TiO2 and the (101) planes of berndtite SnS2. Thus, it is confirmed again by HRTEM that 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 possesses a heterostructure and the formation of extremely close interfaces between TiO2 and SnS2 are beneficial for the enhancement of photogenerated charge separation efficiency. Besides, the inset of Fig. 3a shows the SAED pattern of the ST-2 sample. The existence of a sequence of bright electron diffraction rings shows the good crystallinity of 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2.

Fig. 4 shows the optical absorption properties of the as-prepared 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 samples. The pure 3DOM TiO2 exhibits enhanced visible light absorption below a wavelength range of 420 nm, suggesting that the architectural structure of 3DOM is greatly beneficial for photon absorption and narrowing the optical band gap due to its multiple scattering and slow photon effects. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of pure SnS2 also exhibits a stronger visible light response and its absorption edge has been shifted to about 675 nm. For the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 composition, with the addition of SnS2, the UV-vis absorption curves are shifted to longer wavelengths, indicating the obviously enhanced optical absorption performance. However, it is observed that the light absorption wavelength of the ST-2 and ST-3 sample is higher than that of pure SnS2. This may be because when solar light crosses the three-dimensional network structure, the multiple reflections generated can increase the path length of light, leading to an improvement in visible light absorption. This result is in agreement with other reports.29–31

PL is the first choice to test the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs in the as-prepared heterojunctions. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PL peaks around 468 nm in all the samples can be attributed to the charge transfer emission. Among these samples, the 3DOM TiO2 shows the strongest emission peaks, suggesting a high recombination rate of electron–hole pairs.28 As stated above, recombination is one of the main drawbacks of the 3DOM TiO2 photocatalyst and limits its potential further applications. Fortunately, the use of a few SnS2 nanosheets to decorate 3DOM TiO2 can significantly reduce the intensity of the emission peak in the same position. The PL spectrum indicates that the recombination probability of electron–hole pairs for the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 sample is significantly reduced. Similarly, the pure SnS2 also exhibits a low emission peak due to the formation of numerous sulfur vacancies  as confirmed by the EPR analysis. The , acting as electron trappers, can properly inhibit the electrons’ return to the valence band and thus improve the charge carrier separation.32

As shown in Fig. 5b, the pure 3DOM TiO2 shows a weak photocurrent response due to poor charge separation efficiency under visible light irradiation. By contrast, the photocurrent intensities of ST-2, ST-4 and pure SnS2 nanosheets are significantly enhanced, indicating the improvement of the charge carrier separation efficiency. Additionally, the calculated photocurrent values of the ST-2 and ST-4 samples were 1.45 and 0.91 μA cm−2 after 400 seconds, which is about 2.69 and 1.68 times higher than that of the SnS2 nanosheets, respectively, suggesting that the 3DOM heterojunction plays an important role in shortening the migration distance of the electrons from bulk to the surface in the TiO2@SnS2 composition.

Fig. 6. shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and the pore size distribution curve of the 3DOM TiO2, SnS2 nanosheet and ST-2 samples. The pure 3DOM TiO2 and the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction, prepared using the colloidal crystal-template method, exhibit typical type-IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops (Fig. 6a), indicating the presence of mesoporous structures in the 3DOM TiO2 and ST-2 samples except the already existing three dimensionally macroporous structure. In addition, as calculated from the desorption branch using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, the pore size distribution curves of the above three materials are shown in Fig. 6(b). The narrow peak of ST-2 is centered at around 2.5 nm owing to the fact that the formation of 3DOM TiO2 is aggregated by massive nanoparticles. As listed in Table 1, the BET surface area of the ST-2 and 3DOM TiO2 is 82.84 m2 g−1 and 90.93 m2 g−1, repectively, which is much higher than that of the SnS2 nanosheets (33.99 m2 g−1). These results show that the 3DOM structure provides a large surface area, which could supply a lot of interfacial reaction active sites, and it could be easier to promote the mass diffusion and removal of the reactant during the photocatalytic reaction.

EPR spectroscopy can provide direct information about the defect states and paramagnetic species that formed in the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 composites, and the obtained information can further help to understand the charge transfer processes.33 In Fig. 7, the resonance signal of 3DOM TiO2 at g = 2.002 is known to be due to an electron trapped in an oxygen vacancy .34 It is known that the oxygen vacancy can react with O2− to form ˙O2− radicals, which are responsible for oxidizing organic pollutants. Moreover, the spectrum of pure SnS2 shows a clear resonance signal at g = 2.003, which can be assigned to an electron trapped in .35 It is well known that the  located below the bottom of the conduction band can act as an electron trapper to actively inhibit the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Similar EPR signals have also been observed in the ST-2 sample, and their intensity has been significantly enhanced, which can be attributed to the combined effect of both the sulfur vacancies and oxygen vacancies produced in this 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction system.

In order to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the obtained photocatalyst, the RhB solution and six-valent chromium ion solution were used as the model pollutants under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). For comparison, pure 3DOM TiO2, the SnS2 nanosheets and a blank experiment (without any photocatalyst) were tested under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 8a, the RhB solution is quite stable and its photodegradation efficiency can be negligible in the absence of a photocatalyst, while pure 3DOM TiO2 shows a slight photocatalytic activity due to the photosensitization effect of RhB.36 However, the SnS2 nanosheets with a high visible-light responsiveness just showed a lower RhB degradation rate with a value of 48% after 100 min of photoreaction. Compared with pure 3DOM TiO2 and pure SnS2 nanosheets, the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction exhibits a highly photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. In particular, the sample ST-2 prepared with a molar ratio of Sn4+:Ti4+ = 7.5:100 showed the highest photocatalytic activity with a RhB degradation rate of 96.7% after 100 min of photoreaction. Fig. 8b shows the photodecomposition kinetics of RhB over the as-obtained samples. It can be seen that the ST-2 sample exhibits the strongest photoactivity, and its apparent rate constant (kapp) is calculated to be 0.035 min−1, which is about 5 times higher than that of the SnS2 nanosheets.

Solutions of Cr(VI), a typical type of heavy metal ion in industrial waste water, are very harmful to human health and ecosystems.38 Thus, the photoreduction of a Cr6+ solution was also evaluated over the as-prepared photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 8c, it was found that all the obtained samples completely reached adsorption equilibrium within 40 min. The adsorption capacity changed in the order of ST-2 > 3DOM TiO2 > SnS2 nanosheets. Among the three samples, ST-2 also exhibited the best photocatalytic performance and the Cr(VI) degradation rate was up to 97% after 40 min photoreaction. Fig. 8d indicates the photoreduction kinetics over different samples. As shown, the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) over the three photocatalysts fits well with pseudo first order reaction kinetics, and the value of kapp for the ST-2 sample is calculated to be 0.0845 min−1, which is about 46.4 and 4.2 times higher than that of 3DOM TiO2 and the SnS2 nanosheets, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 8e, the ST-2 sample retained its high photoreduction activity after a five-cycle experiment, indicating that the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction possesses relatively high stabilities for application. Fig. 8f shows the H2 generation activity from water splitting over different samples. It is surprising that the ST-2 sample still showed excellent photoactivity for H2 production, and the amount of H2 was 52.6 μmol g−1 after 6 h visible light irradiation. This result provides evidence to illustrate the special electron transfer pathway that occurred in the novel 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 system, which will be discussed later.
4. Discussion on the mechanism
It is well known that photogenerated electrons play a vital role in pollutant degradation and H2 generation. In this work, in order to better understand the charge transfer and participation in the photoreaction over the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction, a possible energy level diagram and the suggested mechanism of the TiO2@SnS2 heterojunction are illustrated in Fig. 9. According to the UV-vis DRS spectra, 3DOM TiO2 is a typical n-type semiconductor and its band gap is calculated to be 2.95 eV. Similarly, the SnS2 band gap is also determined to be 1.84 eV from the UV-vis DRS spectra. Herein, the valence band potential (EVB) and the conduction band potential (ECB) of these two samples can be predicted by the following two equations EVB = X – Ee + 0.5Eg and ECB = EVB – Eg, respectively.39,40 Therefore, the ECB levels for 3DOM TiO2 and the SnS2 nanosheets can be computed to be −0.075 eV and 0.08 eV, respectively, and their EVB levels are 2.875 eV and 1.92 eV, accordingly. It is thus found that the energy gap between the EVB of SnS2 and the ECB of 3DOM TiO2 is 1.995 eV, suggesting that as long as the wavelength of simulated solar light is shorter than 622 nm, it can provide enough energy to excite the SnS2 nanosheets that grew on the internal and external surfaces of 3DOM TiO2 to generate high-energy electrons, and these high-energy electrons in the EVB of SnS2 can transfer thermodynamically to the ECB of 3DOM TiO2. According to the schematic diagram, under the irradiation of visible light (λ > 420 nm), the electron–hole pairs are firstly generated in the valence band (VB) of SnS2 (eqn (1-1)). In the initial step, the photogenerated electrons excited by visible light below the wavelength of 622 nm with high energy can directly transfer from SnS2 to TiO2 (eqn (1-2)). In fact, a similar phenomenon is also found in other reports.40 Additionally, the  formed due to the combination of SnS2 (EPR result) will lead to the formation of an isolated defect energy level which is located below the bottom of conduction band. It is worth noting that the  energy level not only can improve the photon absorption, but can also serve as an electron trapper to hinder the recombination of electrons and holes (eqn (1-3)). Hence, it is conceivable that the cooperation effect between the excitation of a high energy electron and the formation of the  energy level promotes the enhancement of the charge separation efficiency and quantum efficiency of the 3DOM heterojunction composition, leading to a higher photoactivity. The above-mentioned charge transfer process in the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 composition can be well confirmed by the experiment of photocatalytic H2 generation. Obviously, the pure SnS2 and 3DOM TiO2 samples do not have the ability to produce H2 under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The ECB of SnS2 is 0.08 eV, which is more positive than that of the water reduction potential (0.0 eV vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)), and thus the photogenerated electrons in the ECB of SnS2 cannot reduce the water molecule to produce hydrogen. Similarly, due to the wide energy band gap, the 3DOM TiO2 cannot be excited by visible light. However, as shown in Fig. 8f, the 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction exhibits a much higher activity for H2 production under visible light irradiation. According to the experimental results, we can confidently conclude that only the photoinduced high energy electrons transfer thermodynamically to the conduction band of TiO2 and the reduction potential of the photoexcited electrons in the 3DOM heterojunction would be more negative than that of H+/H2 (0.0 eV vs. NHE), and thus, H2O absorbed onto the reactive sites can be catalyzed by these surviving electrons into H2 (eqn (1-4)). Meanwhile, the recombination of charge carriers also significantly reduces in the aforementioned process, leading to the enhanced photocatalytic activity.

In addition, it should be noted that the photosensitization mechanism is another factor to improve the photodegradation activity of RhB. Under visible light, the dye RhB was excited to form the cationic dye radical (RhB˙+) and electrons. Next, the excited electrons transfer from the higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the dye to SnS2 or TiO2 and react rapidly with oxygen to produce superoxide radical anions (˙O2−) (eqn (1-5)). Then, the RhB˙+ can be reduced by ˙O2− and eventually converted to CO2 and H2O.37 Of course, another strong oxidant, the hydroxyl radical (˙OH), generated by the holes left in the VB of SnS2 reacting with an –OH group, also plays a critical role in pollutant degradation (eqn (1-7)). It can directly decompose RhB to CO2 and H2O, too.41–43
Finally, the unusual micro-structures created by growing SnS2 nanosheets on 3DOM TiO2 to create a heterojunction system are also favorable to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. It is widely accepted that SnS2 nanosheets with an inimitable thin-layer reaction platform could effectively shorten the path length of electronic transfer to the material surface.44 Furthermore, the 3DOM architecture provides numerous optical absorption active sites as well as interfacial chemical reaction active sites to facilitate light absorption and mass transfer, and both of these are critical factors contributing to the enhanced photocatalytic performance.45
5. Conclusions
In summary, 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction photocatalysts have been successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Compared with pure SnS2, 3DOM TiO2 and the ST-4 sample (without a PMMA template), the ST-2 sample (with a Sn/Ti molar ratio of 7.5:100) exhibits a remarkably higher photocatalytic activity for degradation of RhB solution and reduction of Cr6+ solution, and this enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergetic interaction of the 3DOM network as well as the combination of SnS2 nanosheets with TiO2 to construct a heterojunction system. Both work cooperatively on light absorption, charge separation and interfacial reactions. The as-prepared 3DOM TiO2@nanosheet SnS2 heterojunction can be used as a visible light induced photocatalyst for potential applications in solar energy production and environmental purification.
