    , Accepted 16th February 2007First published on 1st March 2007AbstractTitanate nanotube arrays were grown on sapphire substrates by sputtering deposition of titanium films and a subsequent hydrothermal treatment in an aqueous NaOH solution. Post annealing in air transformed the crystals from a titanate structure to an anatase structure. Titanate and anatase nanotube arrays were optically transparent and adhered well to the substrates. Both titanate and anatase nanotube films exhibited high-hydrophilic states with water contact angles below 5° even after dark storage for more than three months due to their surface nanostructures. UV illumination caused super-hydrophilic states with 0° water contact angles, i.e. band-gap excitations decreased the initial water contact angles in dark conditions (∼3.5°) to 0°. The hydrophilicizing rate of the anatase nanotubes was faster than that of the titanate nanotubes because the anatase nanotubes had a higher crystallinity and more absorbed photons.
Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) based materials have been thoroughly investigated due to their strong photocatalytic activity,1 super-hydrophilicity,2 and superior quality as electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells.3 Particle or thin film forms of TiO2 have been applied to various industrial items, such as self-cleaning exterior tiles and anti-fogging mirror applications.4 On the other hand, one-dimensional (1D) nanotube materials have attracted great interest because they should improve functional devices. Numerous researchers have focused on the TiO2 nanotube structure to improve the efficiencies of photocatalysts and solar cells, and to find new TiO2 applications. Various fabrication methods for TiO2 based nanotubes such as anodization of titanium,5 using porous Al2O3 templates,6 or surfactant templates7 have already been reported. Besides these syntheses for TiO2 based nanotubes, hydrothermally grown titanate nanotubes have received a lot of attention due to their simple and economic fabrication process and unique one-dimensional nanostructures.8 Various properties and functions of hydrothermally grown titanate nanotubes have been reported; i.e. photocatalysis,9 Li+ ion insertion,10 proton conductivity,11 dye sensitized solar cells,12 gas adsorption,13 photoluminescence,14 hydrogen storage,15 sensors,16 electrochromism,17 and anti-reflectivity.18 We have previously reported the photoinduced hydrophilicity of titanate nanotube films synthesized by a layer-by-layer (LBL) self assembly.19 However, the super-hydrophilicity of TiO2 surfaces generated by UV irradiation typically reconverts to the initial state with rather high contact angles when stored under dark conditions.20 From a practical point of view, the sustainability of surface wettability on a TiO2 surface in the dark is necessary for self-cleaning or anti-fogging applications. The water contact angle on a solid surface depends on the surface energy and morphology. The surface roughness enhances the hydrophilicity if the water contact angle of a flat surface is below 90°.21 Balaur et al. have recently reported that the morphology of a TiO2 array synthesized by anodization of titanium foil can control the wetting behavior.22 In addition to the anodization process, Tian et al. have reported that titanate nanotube arrays have been grown on a Ti metal substrate by a simple hydrothermal treatment,23 and we have recently reported the efficient field emission from conductive TiO2 nanotube arrays on titanium electrode synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction and subsequent post annealing in vacuum.24
In the present study, transparent and super-hydrophilic thin films of TiO2-based nanotube arrays are fabricated by vacuum deposition and a subsequent hydrothermal reaction. We evaluated the optical transparency and surface wettability of these films. The relationship between surface morphology and wettability of the nanotube arrays is discussed.
Experimental
Preparation of the thin films
Titanate nanotube arrays were synthesized by a hydrothermal treatment of titanium films on sapphire substrates. Polycrystalline titanium films were deposited on sapphire substrates by rf-magnetron sputtering. Sputtering was conducted under an argon gas pressure of 0.8 Pa for 4 min at room temperature with an rf-power of 500 W. The Ti films were 200 nm thick. To grow the titanate nanotube arrays, these Ti films were immersed into 10 M aqueous NaOH solution, heated at 393 K for 2 hours in a PTFE-lined autoclave, and subsequently washed with 0.1 M HNO3 aqueous solution and pure water. Hereafter, the resulting titanate nanotube array is abbreviated as “TNT”. Then these films were annealed in air at 773 K for 1 hour to obtain an anatase structure (simply denoted “TNT-773 K”). For comparison, we prepared a metal Ti film without the hydrothermal treatment and annealed the Ti film at 773 K for 1 hour in air, which yielded rutile TiO2. Hereafter, the deposited Ti film, and the Ti film annealed at 773 K are abbreviated as “Ti” and “Ti-773 K”, respectively.
Evaluation
The crystal phases of the thin films were evaluated by the grazing angle method of X-ray diffraction with Cu Kα rays (XRD model RINT-2100, Rigaku Co., Tokyo, Japan). The incident angle was fixed at 0.5° and 2θ was scanned in the range of 5°–70°. Cross sections of thin films were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM model S-5200, Hitachi Co., Tokyo, Japan). Cross section and plane-view high-resolution images of the nanotubes were recorded by a transmission electron microscope (TEM model H-9000UHR, Hitachi, Co., Tokyo, Japan). For the TEM measurements, thin specimens were prepared by ion milling (model PIPS691, Gatan Inc.). Surface morphologies were observed by an atomic force microscope (AFM model SPA300HV, Seiko Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). AFM measurements were performed in the tapping mode using silicon tips (spring constant: 21 N m−1, tip curvature radius: 10 nm). Roughness factors (r) were calculated by image processing of AFM images where r is defined as the ratio of the actual area of a rough surface to the geometric projected area. The contact angle was measured by the sessile drop method. Contact angle measurement was performed at room temperature (∼295 K) using a commercial contact angle meter (CA-X, Kyowa Interface Science, Saitama, Japan) with an experimental error of ±1°. This contact angle meter was equipped with a light source to capture water droplet images by a CCD camera. This light source does not contain UV light, and it does not excite TiO2 films. The contact angle was determined by numerically drawing a tangent close to the edge of the droplet. All measurements were performed with high-purity water. Prior to the contact angle evaluation, the surface was irradiated with a low pressure Hg lamp (UVO-Cleaner, Ultron Systems Inc.) to eliminate surface contaminants and to produce OH species. Thin films were stored in the dark under clean air (N2–O2 = 80 : 20% gas mixture) to avoid adsorption of contaminants in the air. Water contact angles of thin films were alternatively measured under dark or UV illumination conditions. UV illumination was provided by a 10 W black light bulb (Toshiba Co., Tokyo, Japan) with a light intensity of 1.0 mW cm−2 measured by a UV radiometer (UVR-2, Topcon Co. Tokyo, Japan).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns for the thin films. Similar to the previous report, all the diffraction peaks observed in the TNT film are indexed as the titanate structure.8 Several groups have reported that the unit cell structure of hydrothermally grown nanotube were trititanate (H2Ti3O7),8b lepidocrocite (HxTi2 −
					x/4[]x/4O4, x
				∼0.7, []: vacancy),8c,d H2Ti2O4(OH)2,8g or H2Ti4O9.8l Although the exact unit cell structure is still controversial, these reports indicate that the crystal structure is hydrogen titanate, which is composed of scrolled TiO2 sheets that are separated by H+ ions. The diffraction peak near 9.0° corresponds to the interlayer separation between the TiO2 sheets with the separation of 0.98 nm. Our X-ray diffraction pattern of the TNT film is identical to the previous reports, indicating that the crystal structure of the nanotubes in this study is hydrogen titanate. It should be noted that the crystal structure of TNT was transformed from titanate to anatase by post-annealing in air at 773 K, while the crystal structure of the metal Ti film was partially transformed into a rutile structure by annealing in air at 773 K and the surface of titanium was oxidized to rutile TiO2 by the post-annealing treatment.

Fig. 2 shows cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Both the Ti and Ti-773 K films exhibit dense structures, whereas the TNT and TNT-773 K films have fibrous structures grown on to the substrates. The TNT and TNT-773 K films were 600 nm thick, but the Ti and Ti-773 K films were 200 nm thick. These results indicate that the hydrothermal reaction causes the film's volume to expand, which results in the porous structure.

Fig. 3 shows the TEM images for TNT and TNT-773 K films. Cross-sectional images for both films exhibited fibrous structures. Sheet like structures were seen in the TNT film, however, some crystallites were observed in a fibrous particle of the TNT-773 K film. Electron diffraction patterns indicate that the TNT is a low crystallinity titanate structure, while TNT-773 K is a polycrystalline anatase structure. Although the tubular structure was partially observed in the plane-view image of the TNT-773 K film, post-annealing causes transformation from titanate nanotubes to polycrystalline anatase rod-structures. When the annealing temperature was raised to ≥873 K, almost all the tubular structures were destroyed and changed to rod or granular structures.

Herein we discuss the growth process of the formation of the nanotube arrays in the hydrothermal process. Several groups have proposed formation mechanisms for titanate nanotubes. Some groups have indicated a rollup model of titanate nano-sheets,25 while Kukovecz et al. have recently suggested that crystalline nanotubes are grown from nanolooped seeds.26 As seen in our cross sectional SEM images, incubation layers, which are composed of granular structures, are formed at the substrate–nanotube array interfaces. When the hydrothermal reaction time was shorter or the temperature was lower, a nanotube structure was not observed and only this granular structure appeared at the surface. Our XRD analyses indicate that these layers are amorphous. Under hydrothermal conditions, an amorphous oxide or hydroxide layer is initially formed at the surface of the metal Ti layer by an oxidation reaction. Then the surface region of the amorphous layer is dissolved and the nuclei for the subsequent growth of the crystalline titanate nanotubes appear. In addition, it seems that the incubation layer of our film acts as a binder between the nanotube arrays and the substrate, leading to good adhesion to the substrates. Quantitative analysis on the adhesive strength is currently under way in our laboratory to address an industrial application.

Fig. 4 shows the AFM images for the thin films. TNT and TNT-773 K films exhibit rougher surfaces than the Ti and Ti-773 K films. The roughness factors r, which is defined as the ratio of the actual area of a rough surface to the geometric projected area, for Ti, Ti-773 K, TNT, and TNT-773 K are 1.002, 1.018, 2.206, and 2.018, respectively. We could not observe tubular structures in the AFM images of the TNT film, because the tip radius of the cantilever was larger than the inner diameter of the nanotubes. Therefore, the exact roughness factors r would be larger than those calculated by AFM images.

Fig. 5 shows the UV-Vis spectra for the thin films. TNT and TNT-773 K are optically transparent, but Ti and Ti-773 K are not. The hydrothermal temperature and reaction time are very important for transparent films. When the substrate on the Ti film was 200 nm, the optimum hydrothermal reaction to obtain highly transparent nanotube arrays was 2 hours at 393 K. When the hydrothermal reaction time was longer or the temperature was higher, the nanotube arrays were etched away. In particular, TNT and TNT-773 K absorbed UV light due to an inter-band transition. The absorption edge of TNT was blue-shifted toward the shorter wavelength compared to TNT-773 K. Our XRD or TEM measurements imply that the crystal structures of TNT and TNT-773 K are titanate and anatase. Numerous studies have reported that the band gap of anatase TiO2 is about 3.2 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of 380 nm. In contrast, Bavykin et al. have reported that the optical absorption of titanate nanotubes is a two dimensional behavior due to the large effective mass of the charge carrier and electronically isolated layered structure.27 They concluded that the electronic structure of titanate nanotubes is very close to titania nanosheets. Sakai et al. have estimated the band gap energy by electrochemical and photoelectrochemical methods. The estimated band gap of titania nanosheets is 3.8 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of 326 nm.28 In addition, density functional theory (DFT) analysis has suggested that the band gap energy of titania nanosheets is larger than that of anatase due to a quantum size effect in the two dimensional structure.29 The optical absorption behavior of thin films in the present study are consistent with previous reports.

Finally, we evaluated the surface wettability of thin films. Fig. 6 shows the change in the water contact angles. The water contact angles were initially measured in the dark (for 860 hours), then under UV illumination (1.5 hours), and finally in the dark (2500 hours). The initial contact angles of all the films were low because a low pressure Hg lamp was irradiated on the surface to eliminate the surface contaminants and to produce OH species before the contact angle measurements. However, Ti and Ti-773 K turn into hydrophobic states (about 65°) under dark storage, but TNT and TNT-773 K exhibited excellent sustainabilities for hydrophilicity even in the dark conditions. When a black light bulb was illuminated on these films, only Ti did not become hydrophilic because metal Ti is photocatalytically inactive. The inset shows an expanded view of the contact angles for TNT and TNT-773 K under black light bulb illumination. The hydrophilicizing rate of TNT-773 K is faster than that of TNT because the crystal phase of TNT-773 K is anatase, which has a better crystallinity and more absorbed photons than the TNT film. Photoinduced hydrophilic conversion involves photo-excitation and diffusion of photo-generated charge carriers to a surface, thus the hydrophilicizing rate depends on the light absorption property and the mobility of charge carriers. Therefore, narrow band-gap and high crystallinity are important factors for an efficient hydrophilic reaction. In addition, the wettability conversion on a TiO2 surface under UV illumination is caused by surface structural changes.30 Several groups have reported that UV illumination on TiO2 leads to increases in adsorbed water molecules.31 Nakamura et al. have used surface-enhanced IR absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) to report the photoadsorption of water molecules and that photoadsorbed water are easily removed by O2.31a Nosaka et al. have reported that the water molecules adsorbed on a TiO2 surface can be categorized into three types by 1H-NMR analysis: (I) mobile and weakly adsorbed water in the outermost layer, (II) less mobile water in the inner layer, and (III) rigid water near the solid surface. Their 1H-NMR results exhibited substantial increases in types (I) and (II) water and a slight increase in type (III) water.31b In addition, Uosaki et al. have recently investigated the interfacial water structure at a TiO2 surface by sum frequency generation (SFG) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM),31c and found that UV illumination increases not only the amount of all adsorbed water, but also that of the ordered adsorbed water on the TiO2 surface. On the other hand, the hydrophilic surface generated by UV irradiation becomes hydrophobic under dark conditions in air20 because an OH− healed surface is thermally less stable than an O2 healed surface.32 A super-hydrophilic surface of TiO2 also becomes hydrophobic by wet rubbing33 or an ultrasonic treatment in pure water,34 indicating that the photogenerated OH groups in TiO2 are metastable. As shown in Fig. 6, the water contact angles of TNT and TNT-773 K remain below 5° in dark conditions for more than three months, whereas those of Ti and Ti-773 K became 65° in dark conditions. These super-hydrophilicities of TNT and TNT- 773 K films are attributed to their surface morphologies. Wenzel has proposed a theoretical model describing the contact angle at a rough surface (θ′).21 He modified Young's equation using the roughness factor (r) as follows:  cos θ′ = r (γSV
						−
						γSL)/γLV = rcos θ(1) where r is defined as the ratio of the actual area of the rough surface to the geometric projected area, and γSL, γSV, and γLV are the interfacial free energy per unit area of the solid–liquid, solid–gas, and liquid–gas interfaces, respectively. This equation indicates that the surface roughness enhances the hydrophilicity of hydrophilic surfaces (θ < 90°) and enhances the hydrophobicity of hydrophobic ones (θ > 90°) because r is always larger than 1. Similar to most inorganic substances, the water contact angle of a flat TiO2 surface is less than 90°,35 and the surface of TiO2 becomes more hydrophilic when roughness is provided. We have previously reported the surface wettability of titanate nanotube thin films synthesized by a layer-by-layer (LBL) self assembly19 and the water contact angle in the dark under clean air was 20°. AFM analysis indicated that the roughness factor r of this film was 1.212. Using these experimental results for titanate nanotube films by the LBL method, the calculated contact angle of the flat surface of titanate nanotube is 38.5° by Wenzel's equation. This calculated contact angle of titanate nanotube is lower than those of rutile single crystals (60°–80°)36 or heteroepitaxially grown single crystalline anatase TiO2 (∼60°),37 because titanate nanotubes have good ion-exchange properties due to the high density of OH groups on the nanotube surface.8f Several groups have reported the thermogravimetric analysis of titanate nanotubes and attributed the weight loss to the desorption of physisorbed and structural water8d,8f Thorne et al. have reported that the water content in titanate nanotube is 0.615 mol of H2O per TiO2 formula unit, indicating a high content of water molecules and OH groups in titanate nanotubes.11 In the present paper, AFM analysis indicates that the roughness factor of the TNT film is 2.206. Considering the roughness factor and the calculated contact angle of a flat surface (38.5°), cos θ′ of the TNT film in the present study is calculated to be more than 1.0, indicating that the water contact angle becomes 0° on a TNT film. On the other hand, the crystal structure of TNT-773 K is anatase, and its roughness factor r is 2.018. In this case, the calculated water contact angle by Wenzel's equation is also 0°. As is mentioned above, the exact roughness factor would be larger than that analyzed by AFM measurement because the tip radius of the cantilever was larger than the inner diameter of the nanotubes. Thus, the analyzed roughness factors by AFM measurements can be taken as a minimum safe value for the enhancement effect on hydrophilic surface in Wenzel's equation estimation. Therefore, it is reasonable that the TNT and TNT-773 K films exhibit excellent sustainabilities of hydrophilicity in dark places due to their rough surfaces. Although the TNT and TNT-773 K films have significant surface roughness, they are highly transparent in the visible light region as is shown in Fig. 5. The nanostructural morphology of TNT films simultaneously provides concomitant properties of super-hydrophilicity and high-transparency. The fabrication process in this study is quite simple, economical, and applicable to a large area. Although sapphire substrates were used in this paper, we confirmed that TNT films were grown on Pyrex glass substrates (see our cross sectional SEM image in Electronic supplementary information†). We expect that our films will have various industrial applications such as photocatalysis products, electrodes, or sensors.

Conclusion
Transparent and super-hydrophilic thin films of titanate or titania nanotube arrays were grown by sputtering deposition of titanium films on substrates and a subsequent hydrothermal treatment. Titanate and anatase nanotube arrays adhered well to the substrates. These films exhibited long term high-hydrophilic states and high-transparency due to their surface nanostructures. The present hydrothermal process is one of the simplest methods to produce nanotubes. This method may even be applicable to a large area process and has the potential as an economic route for industrial production. Our films have potential for various industrial items, which have anti-fogging or self-cleaning properties.
