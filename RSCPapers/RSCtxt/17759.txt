    , Accepted 20th April 2012First published on 15th May 2012AbstractCdSe and CdSe/CdS quantum dots (QDs) with narrow size distribution are attached onto TiO2 electrodes by linker-assisted chemical bath deposition (LACBD). Preparation is carried out at 60 °C or 160 °C, which results in the formation of CdSe or CdSe/CdS QDs onto the TiO2 nanoparticles connected by thioglycolic acid (TGA). The solar cell based on a CdSe/CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode shows higher JSC, VOC and power conversion efficiency comparing to single CdSe QD-sensitized TiO2, which can be ascribed to superior light absorption, faster electron transport and slower charge recombination for the former. Furthermore, the effects of a ZnS passivation layer and thermal annealing on the photovoltaic performance have been investigated by UV-vis spectra, incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). As a result, a quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QDSSC) based on a TiO2–CdSe/CdS–ZnS photoanode (400 °C, 300 s calcination), polysulfide electrolyte and Cu2S counter electrode achieves a power conversion efficiency of 4.21% under AM 1.5 G one sun illumination.
1. Introduction
The unique optical and electronic properties of semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) has attracted great interest in their application as sensitizers in photovoltaic devices.1–3 Particularly, multiple exciton generation effects, push the theoretical power conversion efficiency (η) of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) beyond the Schockley–Queisser limit and opens new opportunities for third-generation solar cells.4,5 In recent years, many attempts have been made to improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs. The QD materials with tunable light absorption range and band gap edges,6–9 various electrolytes10–12 (including iodide/triiodide, polysulfide and cobalt complexes), and different counter electrodes12,13 (e.g. Pt, Au, Cu2S, carbon materials) have been widely investigated. Moreover, passivation layers like ZnS or amorphous TiO2 has been employed to reduce the recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and enhance the efficiency of solar cells.14,15 However, the light conversion efficiencies of QDSSCs are still limited to be about 4% in general.
Recent literatures show that the anchoring of QDs onto a wide band gap semiconductor (usually TiO2) can be classified into three types. (1) Direct adhesion: QDs are deposited onto the surface of TiO2 by chemical bath deposition (CBD), successive ionic layered adsorption and reaction (SILAR), electrodeposition or a direct adsorption method. The direct contact between the QDs and TiO2 leads to barrier-free electron injection from the QDs to TiO2 substrates, so the QDSSCs usually show higher photovoltaic performance than those prepared by other methods.7,16–19 (2) Self-assembled monolayer (SAM) modification: SAM with phosphonic acid or an oxysilane terminal group is sandwiched between the TiO2 and QDs.20,21 The sensitized electrodes are usually prepared by immersing the TiO2 electrode into solution containing SAM molecules before the deposition or adsorption of the QDs. (3) Linker connection: the as-prepared colloidal QDs are linked to the TiO2 substrates by bifunctional agents such as thioglycolic acid (TGA)22 or mercaptopropionic acid (MPA).23 Hindered by low surface loading of QDs and poor electron injection, the performance of QDSSCs prepared by linker-assisted methods are generally lower than 2%. However, the linker-assisted attachment of colliod QDs is expected to enable best control of the properties of adsorbed QDs, for example the size, size distribution and surface modification which associate with the band gap, light absorption, driving force of electron injection and charge recombination in QDSSCs.24,25
In a previous report,26 we developed an in situ linker-assisted chemical bath deposition (LACBD) to fabricate photostable CdTe/CdS core/shell QDs on the TiO2 surface by employing a bifunctional modifier, thioglycolic acid (TGA). QDs prepared by this method have much smaller size and narrower size distribution than the conventional CBD method because of the stabilizing function of TGA. More importantly, the high surface coverage and step-like band edge alignment promoted light absorption and charge separation inside the QDs, respectively. Hence photovoltaic performance as high as 3.8% was obtained for a CdTe/CdS core/shell QD-sensitized solar cell with polysulfide electrolyte and Au counter electrode, which is the highest value for CdTe QDSSCs.
In this study, the LACBD method is extended to prepare CdSe/CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes. Bifunctional agent TGA is employed as a stabilizer to control the formation of QDs and link them onto the TiO2 nanoparticles simultaneously. Furthermore, the effects of a ZnS passivation layer and annealing treatment on the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs are investigated in detail by absorption spectra, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). As a result, the highest η of QDSSCs, 4.21%, is achieved under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), much higher than those of QDSSCs fabricated by linker-assisted methods reported up to now.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of CdSe or CdSe/CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes
4 mmol Cd(OAc)2·H2O, 10 mmol TGA and 25 mL water was mixed in an 50 mL autoclave under stirring. The pH value of this solution was adjusted to 11 using 10 M NaOH. Then 10 mL Na2SeSO3 solution, prepared by refluxing 9 mmol Se powder and 12 mmol Na2SO3 in 45 mL water, was added drop-wise. TiO2 (P25, Degussa) film was fabricated according to our previous method by screen printing.27 The TiO2 electrodes were simply inserted into the autoclave and reacted hermetically at 60 °C or 160 °C for 6 h to grow CdSe or CdSe/CdS QDs, respectively. When the reaction finished, the TiO2–QD electrodes were washed by water and dried in air at room temperature. TiO2–QDs–ZnS electrodes were prepared by immersing the above electrodes into a 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 aqueous solution and a 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 3 min sequentially. Then thermal annealing at 400 °C for 300 s or 450 s was completed by a hot air gun.
2.2 Fabrication of QDSSC
The QDSSC was assembled by sandwiching a sensitized TiO2 electrode and a Cu2S-brass counter electrode28 together with polysulfide electrolyte containing 1 M Na2S, 1 M sulfur, and 0.1 M NaOH in methanol/water (v/v = 7:3) in the interspace. The active area of the QD-sensitized TiO2 film was 0.152 cm2.
2.3 Characterizations
The as-prepared quantum dots were characterized by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. TEM images, XPS spectra, UV-vis absorption spectra and FTIR spectra of sensitized electrodes were obtained with JEM2010-HR transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ESCA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250, Mono Al Kα source 1486.6 eV), Shimadzu UV-3150 UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer and Nicolet/Nexus 670 FT-IR Analyzer, respectively. Under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by solar simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192, with 1 kW Xe lamp) and calibrated with a NREL standard Si solar cell, the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs was recorded on a Keithley 2400 source meter. A metal mask with an area of 5 × 5 mm2 was covered on the active films. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) signal was recorded on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral Product DK240 monochrometer. To measure the electron behaviors in QDSSCs, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out with frequency ranging from 1 M Hz to 0.03 Hz by a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation. Applied bias of −0.6 V and a 10 mV AC sinusoidal signal over the constant bias were employed in the EIS measurement under dark conditions.
3. Results and discussion
After the hydrothermal reaction, the white TiO2 films appear to be yellow-green (prepared at 60 °C) or dark red (prepared at 160 °C), implying the loading of QDs on the TiO2 electrodes. As an example, TEM image of QD-sensitized TiO2 fabricated at 160 °C for 6 h is shown in Fig. 1a. A number of QDs around 4 nm in size are covered on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, fringe lattices of the QDs can be clearly distinguished in the HRTEM image in Fig. 1b.
 Fig. 1  (a) TEM and (b) HRTEM images of QD-sensitized TiO2 prepared at 160 °C for 6 h. 

Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the QD samples. It is clear that the pattern of QDs prepared at 60 °C corresponds well to the zinc blended CdSe (JCPDS no.19-0191). However, a shift to higher angle is observed for the QDs prepared at 160 °C, and the main peaks are located between CdSe and CdS standard values. Similar to the CdTe/CdS core/shell QDs prepared by LACBD method,26 the present sample prepared at 160 °C may be CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs.
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns and (b) XPS spectra of CdSe or CdSe/CdS QDs prepared at 60 °C or 160 °C for 6 h respectively. 
To shed light on the formation of CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs, experiments of different hydrothermal times at 160 °C were carried out. The XRD patterns in Fig. S1 (ESI‡) reveal that pure CdSe QDs were formed within 1 h. The appearance of CdS peaks provide the evidence for a CdSe core accompanying the formation of CdS for the samples prepared at extended hydrothermal reaction times (from 3 to 12 h).
Furthermore, the CdS shell can be confirmed by XPS Se 3d spectra in Fig. 2b. SeO2 doublets are observed for the CdSe QDs prepared at 60 °C due to the oxidization of bare CdSe QDs, whereas the doublets of SeO2 is absent for the CdSe/CdS prepared at 160 °C. This absence discloses that the CdSe was entirely protected from being oxidized. Because of the partial oxidation of pure CdSe QDs (60 °C), this protection is not a result of the TGA coating. Therefore, the outer layer of the sample prepared at 160 °C must be CdS and the S source is probably originats from the gradual decomposition of sulfur-containing TGA.26,29 An additional experiment for the hydrothermal reaction of TGA (without Cd2+ and Na2SeSO3) confirmed that TGA could release S2−, as shown in the ESI.‡
Based on the analysis above, CdSe QDs are formed and modified by TGA only, for the sample prepared at 60 °C. However, for the hydrothermal reaction at 160 °C, the Se2− reacts with Cd2+ to form a CdSe core at the beginning (within 1 h) due to the high concentration of Se2−. The prolongation of hydrothermal reaction leads to the formation of a CdS shell on the CdSe core because of the gradual decomposition of TGA molecules.
The linkage of CdSe or CdSe/CdS QDs to TiO2 substrates by the TGA linker can be proved by FTIR curves (see, Fig. S2, ESI‡). Comparing the spectrum of QD–TGA–TiO2 with that of free TGA, the disappearance of peaks at 2565 cm−1 (–SH stretching vibration) and 1720 cm−1 (CO vibration) implies that TGA links to QDs and TiO2 by –SH and –COOH groups, respectively.30,31 For reference, the experiment was also carried out in the absence of TGA. A great deal of precipitate was obtained in the autoclave and only a little CdSe was deposited onto the surface of the TiO2 electrode, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI‡). The uneven CdSe particle layer will block the pores of the TiO2 photoelectrode and seriously affect the efficientcy of sensitized solar cells. In a word, TGA has three important roles in the synthesis of CdSe/CdS QD-sensitized electrodes: (1) it controls the size and size distribution of the QDs; (2) it links the QDs to the TiO2 by functional groups; (3) it gradually releases S2− at 160 °C and leads to the formation of a CdS shell on the CdSe core.
The light absorption property of CdSe and CdSe/CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 electrode is assessed by UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3a). According to the reference,32 the diameters of QDs prepared at 60 °C and 160 °C are calculated to be 2.0 nm and 3.8 nm, respectively, corresponding well with the TEM observation. An apparent red shift accompanied by absorption enhancement can be observed in the UV-vis spectrum of the CdSe/CdS sensitized TiO2 electrode compared with that of CdSe one, which is attributed to the larger size and higher loading for the former. These spectra indicate that incident photon at lower energy levels can be utilized by QDSSCs based on CdSe/CdS QDs. Therefore the light harvesting efficiency (ηlh) of CdSe/CdS QDSSCs is expected to be higher than that of CdSe QDSSCs. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (in Fig. 3b) show that the IPCE value over 30% ranging from 400 to 580 nm can be observed for the CdSe/CdS QDSSC, which reflects effective photon conversion in a wide range. In contrast, limited by photon absorption (Fig. 3a), the CdSe QDSSC can only transform light between 400 and 450 nm into current with about 30% conversion efficiency. Therefore, a large difference in current density between CdS and CdSe/CdS QDSSCs can be anticipated.

Fig. 3c shows the current density to voltage (J–V) curves of CdSe and CdSe/CdS QDSSCs. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1. It is clear that the JSC, VOC and FF of the CdSe/CdS QDSSC are much higher than those of the CdS QDSSC, which results in significantly higher power conversion efficiency for the former (2.83%). The JSC can be estimated by the expression JSC = qηlhηinjηccI0 (ηlh is the light harvesting efficiency, ηinj is the electron injection efficiency, ηcc is the charge collection efficiency, q is the elementary charge, I0 is the light flux).33,34 The higher ηlh for the CdSe/CdS QDSSC, which can be confirmed by the above UV-vis and IPCE data, contributes greatly to the JSC.

The ηcc is related to both electron transport rate and charge recombination rate in sensitized solar cell systems.35,36 Generally, better electron injection and more photon absorptions increase the concentration of electrons in TiO2, which improves the electron transport rate and enhances ηcc. The charge recombination processes in QDSSCs can be elucidated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In Nyquist curves shown in Fig. 4, the arc in the high frequency region cannot be separated due to the highly catalytic activity of Cu2S counter electrodes.13 Hence only the arc in the intermediate frequency region which reflects the recombination processes in the QDSSCs is fitted by an equivalent module (inset in Fig. 4). The recombination resistance, chemical capacitance and calculated electron lifetime (τn = Rr × Cμ)37,38 are listed in Table 1. The electron lifetime of the CdSe/CdS QDSSC is about 100 ms longer than that of the CdSe QDSSC, supporting a lower recombination rate for the former, which is conducive to the increase of the ηcc and JSC. Charge carriers in QDSSCs are mainly recombined at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces or by the surface states of the QDs.39,40 In the CdSe QDSSC, low surface loading of TiO2 leaves a large proportion of area exposed to the electrolyte. This direct contact aggravates the recombination of injected electrons and redox couple. Moreover, poor quality of the CdSe QDs fabricated at 60 °C may lead to more surface defects compared with QDs prepared at 160 °C,41 which increases the recombination inside single CdSe QDs. In addition, as discussed in many CdSe/CdS co-sensitized systems, the band edges of CdSe and CdS shift negatively (e.g. conduction band shift, CdS: from −0.8 V to −1.0 V, CdSe: from −0.6 V to −1.2 V, vs. NHE)42,43 and form a type II heterojunction when immersed in polysulfide electrolyte. This accelerates the separation of electrons and holes and hence reduces the electron recombination before injecting into TiO2.7,44 The charge recombination rate mainly affectes the VOC as well as FF of QDSSCs. Therefore, a VOC of 570 mV can be observed for the CdSe/CdS QDSSC, which is much higher than that of the CdSe QDSSC (435 mV).

Recently, ZnS has been widely used as a passivation material for QDSSCs to improve their photovoltaic performance. In this study, effects of a ZnS passivation layer and annealing treatment on the photovoltaic parameters of CdSe/CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 solar cells were further investigated. CdSe/CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes (prepared at 160 °C) coated with a ZnS layer were annealed at 400 °C in air for different time periods (ns: n = 0, 300, 450), designated as ZnS-ns. The J–V, IPCE and the Nyquist modes (EIS) of ZnS-0s, ZnS-300s and ZnS-450s QDSSCs are shown in Fig. 5 and 6, and the related UV-vis absorption spectra and TEM image of modified sensitized electrodes are illustrated in the ESI.‡

When a ZnS layer is deposited on the CdSe/CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 electrode, a η (3.2%) of ZnS-0s QDSSC is obtained, higher than that (2.83%) of QDSSC without a ZnS layer. This enhancement of power conversion efficiency can be attributed to the improvement of VOC (42 mV). In EIS simulation (Fig. 6 and Table 2), the electron lifetime of ZnS-0s QDSSC is prolonged to 800 ms, reflecting the reduced recombination caused by the following three reasons: (1) A ZnS layer covering the whole electrode isolates the TiO2–QDs from the polysulfide electrolyte, which hinders the recombination of electrons in the photoanode with redox couple; (2) ZnS has a higher conduction band than CdSe and CdS, which buries the CdSe/CdS QDs in a potential energy well and prevents excited electrons from recombining directly with the electrolyte;41 (3) the ZnS layer passivates the surface states of the QDs and hence reduces the recombination by the surface states of the QDs.14

After annealing, a ZnS-300s based QDSSC shows a remarkable augment in JSC (from 7.90 to 11.71 mA cm−2) and VOC (from 612 to 654 mV) and achieves an outstanding η of 4.21%. Fig. 5b indicates that the IPCE of the ZnS-300s QDSSC is much higher than that of the ZnS-0s sample in the whole active region. However, the UV-vis absorption spectrum of ZnS-300s in Fig. S4 (ESI‡) resembles the spectrum of ZnS-0s with only a slight increase in the intensity. TEM images in Fig. S5 (ESI‡) also illustrate that the size and crystal form of the CdSe/CdS QDs remains unchanged after thermal annealing of 300 s. Therefore, the JSC improvement is supposed to be a result of evaporation of redundant linker molecules, which benefits the electron injection from the CdSe/CdS QDs to the TiO2. Higher electron injection rate ensures more effective collection of excited electrons before being recombined. Therefore the VOC of the ZnS-300s QDSSC further increases to 654 mV, which is supported by the even longer lifetime (1048 ms) obtained by EIS spectra in Fig. 6.
When annealed for 450 s, the JSC of a QDSSC based on ZnS capped TiO2–CdSe/CdS electrode increases slightly, whereas the VOC, FF and η of ZnS-450s QDSSC diminishes sharply. The UV-vis spectrum (Fig. S4, ESI‡) and IPCE curve (Fig. 5b) show that light absorption and IPCE onset position of ZnS-450s red shifts by about 30 nm with an obviously increasing intensity, ascribed to the size enlarging of the QDs (from 4 nm to 6–7 nm, see TEM images in Fig. S5, ESI‡). In addition, the lattice spacing of the QDs changes from 0.338 nm to 0.361 nm after 450 s annealing, implying the crystal transforming of CdSe/CdS from cubic to hexagonal phase, similar to the reported phenomenon.45 This fact demonstrates the decomposition and reformation processes of the QDs. In another word, the destruction of CdSe/CdS core/shell structure. EIS Nyquist spectrum and the reduced electron lifetime (830 ms) of the ZnS-450s QDSSC further supports the serious charge recombination.
Finally, the ZnS-300s QDSSC with highest η of 4.21% under one sun illumination was measured under different light intensities. The J–V curves and detailed parameters are shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1 (ESI‡). Lower light intensity leads to increased FF. As a result, power conversion efficiency of 4.26% and 5.04% are observed under 0.35 sun and 0.12 sun illuminations, respectively.
4. Conclusions
A linker-assisted chemical bath deposition method has been developed to fabricate CdSe or CdSe/CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes. TEM and UV-vis absorption spectra reveal that CdSe/CdS core/shell QD-sensitized TiO2 electrode prepared at 160 °C has higher loading and larger QD size compared to the CdSe QD-sensitized TiO2 electrode prepared at 60 °C. Therefore, light harvesting and electron collection efficiency of a CdSe/CdS core/shell QDSSC are superior to single CdSe QDSSCs. In addition, better crystallinity and step-like band edge structure for the CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs prevent charge recombination inside the QDs by reducing surface states and accelerating charge separation. The CdSe/CdS QDSSC with Cu2S counter electrode and polysulfide electrolyte results in a power conversion efficiency of 2.83%, which is six-fold higher than that (0.46%) of the CdSe QDSSC. Furthermore, a ZnS capping layer and annealing treatment are found to reduce electron recombination greatly. Obvious prolongation of electron lifetime is observed for the ZnS capped CdSe/CdS QDSSC which is ascribed to the isolation of the TiO2 electrode from the electrolyte and the passivation of QD surface states. Evaporation of redundant linker caused by annealing treatment at 400 °C for 300 s enhances the IPEC of QDSSC effectively, and pushes the JSC to 11.7 mA cm−2. Consequently, an outstanding η of 4.21% has been achieved for a QDSSC based on ZnS-300s electrode.
