For practical applications, improvement of power conversion efficiency has always been one of the major research topics. Porphyrins are outstanding sensitizers endowed with strong sunlight harvesting ability in the visible region and multiple reaction sites available for functionalization. However, judicious molecular design in consideration of light-harvest, energy levels, operational dynamics, adsorption geometry and suppression of back reactions is specifically required for achieving excellent photovoltaic performance. This feature article highlights some of the recently developed porphyrin sensitizers, especially focusing on the systematic dye structure optimization approach in combination with coadsorption and cosensitization methods in pursuing higher efficiencies.

1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been an active research field since the initial success in 1991 by Grätzel and coworkers.1 The sandwich-like device (Fig. 1), comprising a dye-sensitized mesoporous nanocrystalline semiconducting oxide photoanode (typically TiO2), a counter electrode (typically Pt-coated conductive glass substrate) and electrolyte in between (with iodine or cobalt-based redox couple), outperforms silicon-based solar cells in respect of production cost and therefore has potential competence in the electricity generation market.2–4 Its operational mechanisms can be briefly summarized in four forward processes as illustrated in Fig. 1: (1) photoexcitation of the sensitizer, (2) electron injection from the excited dyes into the TiO2 conduction band, (3) regeneration of dyes by the reducing species in the electrolyte and (4) reduction of the oxidized redox species by receiving the photogenerated electrons from the external circuit. Meanwhile, some undesirable back processes including quenching of the excited-state dyes, and charge recombination of photoinjected electrons with both oxidized dyes and oxidized electrolyte, are inevitably happening and should be retarded.5

The green arrows represent the forward processes. The red arrows represent the back processes. (TCO = transparent conducting oxide, CB = conduction band, S = sensitizer, S+ = oxidized sensitizer, S* = excited sensitizer). 
In a DSSC device, the sensitizer is a pivotal component in determining the cell performance because it is strongly correlated with light-harvest, electron-injection, dye regeneration and charge recombination processes.6 A qualified sensitizer is supposed to have the following characteristics: (1) strong and panchromatic absorption matched with the solar energy distribution as much as possible, (2) a LUMO level higher than that of the TiO2 conduction band for efficient electron injection, (3) a HOMO level lower than that of the redox mediator to assure dye regeneration, (4) an anchoring group like –COOH or –H2PO3 to immobilize the dye on the TiO2 surface, (5) appropriate configuration favorable for electron injection, and suppression of aggregation and charge recombination, and (6) good stability and environmental friendliness.7 Since the report of sensitizers based on ruthenium complexes with an efficiency of 10% early in 1993,8 ruthenium sensitizers have been taking the lead in terms of high efficiencies.9–11 But the difficulty in structural modification and scarcity of materials limit their practical applications. In contrast, metal-free organic sensitizers are advantageous because of their low cost, easy synthesis and flexible functionalization. Thus, emerging examples with over 10% efficiencies have been reported in recent years.12–19
In addition to the aforementioned two classes of sensitizers, porphyrin sensitizers have aroused particular interest because of the original inspiration by nature: chlorophylls that serve as the light-harvesting center in the photosynthesis systems are porphyrin derivatives. In fact, porphyrin sensitizers have strong absorption in the visible region and a number of reaction sites available for structural modification, and thus a number of efficient porphyrin sensitizers have been reported by Grätzel, Diau, Yeh, Lin, Wang, Imahori, and many other groups.20–26 Most efficient porphyrin dyes feature meso-substituted donor–π bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) structures (Fig. 2). Although porphyrin sensitizers have also been developed by functionalization on the pyrrole-rings, the achieved efficiencies are relatively low or moderate,27–33 and thus the work in this respect will not be described in detail in this feature article. It should be noted that the molecular design principles for sensitizers differ slightly according to the electrolyte used. As we know, DSSCs based on the Co3+/Co2+ electrolyte tend to give higher photovoltages,34 and thus a high efficiency of 13.0% was achieved using a porphyrin dye by Grätzel and coworkers.20 It is noteworthy that DSSCs based on the cobalt electrolyte usually require additional structural characters like bulky electron donors, and thus the syntheses of the sensitizers and fabrication of the cells are more challenging compared to those based on the traditional I−/I3− electrolyte.13,35,36 Hence, it is still desirable to develop efficient DSSCs based on the traditional iodine electrolyte. Hence, this Feature article will mainly focus on the porphyrin sensitizers designed for fabricating DSSCs based on the iodine electrolyte.

In spite of the aforementioned favorable structural and spectral characters, porphyrin sensitizers still have some drawbacks that need to be overcome. For example, they exhibit an absorption valley around 500 nm between the Soret band and Q bands, and most simple porphyrin sensitizers exhibit extremely weak absorption beyond 660 nm (Fig. 3).37 These features are unfavorable for sunlight capture, since the sunlight energy mainly distributes over a broad wavelength range between 400 and 1300 nm (Fig. 3). Thus, in this Feature article we will focus on strategies for broadening the absorption spectra for better sunlight harvesting in the NIR region. In addition, cosensitizers have been reported to be effective in improving light harvesting by filling up the absorption valleys of porphyrins around 500 nm, which will also be described in detail.

On the other hand, because of the rigid planar framework, porphyrin sensitizers usually have a propensity for aggregation on the TiO2 surface, which may lead to quenching of the excited states and suppressed electron injection. It is thus essential to introduce bulky and flexible alkyl/alkoxyl chains to suppress the aggregation effect.38,39 Meanwhile, bulky coadsorbers can also be used for this purpose.40
Hence, it is required to overcome the drawbacks while preserving the merits for achieving efficient porphyrin dyes through judicious molecular design and coadsorption/cosensitization approaches in full consideration of the intrinsic properties of porphyrin molecules. Herein, we will provide an overview of systematic structural optimization with respect to the donor, porphyrin core and acceptor, respectively.
2. Optimization of the donor
The first examples of meso-substituted D–π–A push–pull porphyrin dyes were developed by Diau, Yeh and coworkers in 2009 with their representative molecule coded YD1 (Fig. 4).41 In comparison with the reference dye YD0, which contains a 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl substituent at the meso-position opposite to the acceptor group, YD1 has a real diphenylamine donor. It turned out that YD1 exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.0% which is dramatically higher than 2.4% achieved for YD0. A large increase of Jsc from 5.79 mA cm−2 for YD0 to 13.60 mA cm−2 for YD1 was observed. It was proposed that the introduction of an electron donating group in YD1 not only broadens its absorption spectrum but also “pushes” the excited electrons to the acceptor, which facilitates electron injection. This paradigm has stimulated much effort on exploring various candidates for porphyrin donors since then.
 Fig. 4  Dye structures of YD0 and YD1 developed by Diau, Yeh and coworkers (ref. 41). 
2.1 Candidates for the donor moiety
Up to now, numerous donors have been successfully applied to porphyrin dyes, and most of them are based on electron-rich arylamines. Fig. 5 shows some representative donor moieties with different electron donating abilities, such as carbazole (Fig. 5a),42N,N-dialkylaminophenyl (Fig. 5b),43 phenothiazine (Fig. 5c),44 fluorene (Fig. 5d),45 pyrene (Fig. 5e),46 diphenylamine (Fig. 5f),41 triphenylamine (Fig. 5g),47 indoline (Fig. 5h),48,49 diphenylaminothiophene (Fig. 5i),50N-annulated perylene (Fig. 5j),24 and ullazine (Fig. 5k).51 Both weak donors like carbazole and strong donors like indoline have been demonstrated to achieve high efficiencies. However, too strong donors like the over-enhanced donor of bis(diphenylamino)-substituted diphenylamino-anthryl group (Fig. 5m)52 might result in too high HOMO levels, which may hamper dye regeneration and afford low efficiencies. Compared to the complicated structures of 5l53 and 5m,52 the structurally simple diphenylaminoanthryl donor (Fig. 5n)54 provides dual-functions of appropriate electron-donating abilities and absorption-broadening characteristics and achieves an efficiency exceeding 10% based on the cobalt electrolyte. In addition to the electron donating ability, the shape and geometry are also key factors affecting the dye performance. Nonplanar structures are favored in terms of anti-aggregation. Thus, butterfly-shaped phenothiazine and propeller starburst triphenylamine are excellent examples of this class.44,55 In contrast, planar units may aggravate aggregation, and are thus unfavorable unless further modified.51
 Fig. 5  Representative donor structures for porphyrin dyes. 
2.2 Linking modes between the donor and the porphyrin core
The linking mode between the donor and the porphyrin core can largely determine the dye performance. Two typical effective modes are amino-linkage and ethynylene-linkage (vide infra). It has been demonstrated that the amino or ethynylene group directly attached to the meso-position of porphyrin promotes the electronic coupling between the donor and the porphyrin macrocycle, benefiting both absorption and charge separation.56
Based on the aforementioned pioneering work on YD1, in 2010, the same research group reported a series of analogues named YD2–YD5 using diarylamino donors (Fig. 6),47 and YD2 exhibited the highest efficiency of 6.56%. The inspiring result stimulated further optimization in device fabrication, and prominent efficiencies of 7.1% and 10.9% were then reported for the same dye.21,57 Moreover, the later developed landmark molecules YD2-o-C822 and SM31520 are both featured with a diarylamino donor.
 Fig. 6  Chemical structures of YD1–YD5 with diarylamino donors reported by Diau, Yeh and coworkers (ref. 47). 
The ethynylene-linking mode gives a series of efficient porphyrin sensitizers by virtue of extended absorption. However, the good planarity associated with the ethynylene unit must be carefully treated. Otherwise, serious aggregation may result in a decreased efficiency.
Our group has systematically investigated the effect of an ethynylene linker on porphyrin dye performance. As illustrated in Fig. 7, we firstly synthesized Q1 and Q2 based on carbazole donors in the presence and absence of an ethynylene linker, respectively.37 Armed with the ethynylene bridge, Q1 exhibits an obviously red-shifted absorption onset of 695 nm in comparison with Q2 (655 nm). But the efficiency of Q1 was found to be 2.22%, which was dramatically lower than that of 5.51% achieved for Q2. The inferior performance of Q1 was attributed to its poor solubility and severe dye aggregation. In order to solve these problems, we further modified the porphyrin framework by introducing four long alkoxyl chains at the ortho-positions of the meso-phenyl units to obtain the “alkoxyl-wrapped” porphyrins XW1 and XW2 (Fig. 7).42 Improved efficiencies of 7.13% and 6.84% were achieved for XW1 and XW2, respectively. Although the ethynylene linking is still unfavorable for photovoltaic performance, the difference between XW1 and XW2 seems to be much smaller than that between Q1 and Q2 owing to the better suppression of aggregation induced by the “alkoxyl-wrapped” structure. Furthermore, in our later research concerning the phenothiazine donor-based molecules XW9 and XW10 (Fig. 7), the ethynylene unit finally manifested its advantage.44 Compared with XW9, the presence of the ethynylene unit in XW10 broadened the absorption. Meanwhile, dye aggregation was suppressed by the coexistence of the nonplanar butterfly-shaped phenothiazine and two additional alkyl chains. Thus Jsc was enhanced from 16.27 mA cm−2 to 17.90 mA cm−2 and the Voc was only slightly decreased from 728 mV to 711 mV. As a result, an efficiency of 8.6% was achieved for XW10, higher than that of 8.2% obtained for XW9. In 2016, Yeh, Diau and coworkers studied a series of porphyrin dyes and specifically clarified the influence of a phenylethynylene unit on the dye performance.58 They revealed that this unit is beneficial to Jsc by means of improved light-harvesting ability originating from broadened and red-shifted absorption, as well as increased probability of electron injection. So far, it is believed that insertion of the ethynylene bridge can be a valid strategy to improve the dye performance, especially in terms of Jsc, as long as the aggregation problem is well addressed.

2.3 The effect of inserting more π-extended building blocks neighboring to the donor
Based on Section 2.2, it is anticipated that a more extended conjugation framework will result in broadened absorption. To make better use of the sunlight in the near-IR region, porphyrin dyes with more π-extended building blocks have been synthesized, including porphyrins fused with polycyclic aromatic units,59–61 fused porphyrins,62 and dimeric62–64 and trimeric65 porphyrins. Although almost all of them exhibit strongly red-shifted absorption, they suffer badly either from the unfavorable electron injection process associated with too low LUMO levels or from aggravated dye aggregation. Consequently, only disappointing efficiencies could be obtained. A remaining option is to insert an ethynylanthracenyl unit between the donor and the porphyrin ring as developed by Lin, Wu and coworkers (Fig. 8). LWP366 and LD3167 both exhibited obvious red-shifted absorption relative to LD14,43 without a severe sacrifice of the efficiency. It is noteworthy that cosensitization of LD31 with an organic dye afforded an overall efficiency exceeding 10% with a good panchromatic character.

2.4 Introduction of multiple chains into the donor moiety
As mentioned above, aggregation is a major obstacle towards further improvement of porphyrin dye performance. It could be anticipated that if the donor moiety is endowed with anti-aggregation abilities by attaching more alkyl/alkoxyl chains, the hydrophobic chains can suppress dye aggregation and retard the charge recombination between injected electrons and the oxidized redox species, and thus the Voc and efficiency might be improved. As shown in Fig. 9, based on the aforementioned dye XW2, we further introduced additional alkoxyl groups on the phenylene unit neighboring to carbazole to obtain XW3 and XW4. The efficiency was enhanced from 6.84% for XW2 to 7.32% and 7.94% for XW3 and XW4, respectively (Fig. 10). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results revealed that XW3 and XW4 exhibited a decreased charge recombination rate with respect to XW2, consistent with their higher Voc values.42 Similarly, by introducing four long alkoxyl chains to the triphenylamino donor unit, the efficiency was successfully elevated from 8.6% for XW14 to 9.1% for XW16, along with a Voc enhancement from 725 mV to 734 mV.68

In addition to the alkyl/alkoxyl chains, sterically hindered units may also be beneficial to suppress the aggregation. In 2016, Zheng and coworkers introduced a bulky spirobifluorene unit as well as an alkyl moiety to the phenothiazine donor (Fig. 9).69 The obtained JA3 exhibited a higher PCE of 6.27% as compared with the control molecule JA1 (5.76%). It is noteworthy that the presence of the spirobifluorene unit induced an impressive Voc enhancement from 701 mV to 800 mV, which could be ascribed to the effective prevention of I3− from approaching the TiO2 surface by the bulky substituents.
3. Modification of the porphyrin ring
Up to now, the most effective and widely used modification on the porphyrin ring of a sensitizer is to envelop the macrocycle with long alkoxyl chains, forming an “alkoxyl-wrapped” structure. Such an approach was initially attempted by Hupp and coworkers in 2010,70,71 and was systematically investigated by Lin, Diau and coworkers between 2011 and 2012 with efficiencies over 10% achieved for the representatives of LD14 and LD16 (Fig. 11).43,72 Through controlled molecular design and comparison of a series of LD dyes in terms of substitution positions and chain lengths, Lin and Diau proposed that the ortho-alkoxyl wrapped fashion exhibits the following advantages over the meta- and para- substitution modes:43,72 (1) it slightly raises the LUMO levels of the dyes and facilitates electron injection; (2) the alkoxyl chains with a suitable length improve the solubility of the molecule and facilitate dye-uptake; (3) the ortho-chains with eight or more carbon atoms can surround the rigid porphyrin core, resulting in suppressed dye aggregation; (4) it may cause an upward shift of the TiO2 CB edge upon dye adsorption, which is favorable for improving the Voc; and (5) the chains may form insulating layers against the hydrophilic electrolyte and thus slow down the charge recombination. Following this design concept, the renowned dye YD2-o-C8 (Fig. 11) was developed, which individually afforded a high efficiency of 11.9% based on the cobalt-based electrolyte.22
 Fig. 11  Molecular structures of LD14, LD16, YD2-o-C8, and XW18-XW21 (ref. 22, 43, 72, and 73). 
In this respect, we compared the possibly different effects between the branched and linear chains as shown in Fig. 11.73 The results indicated that for the dyes with an ethynyl benzoic acid acceptor, the difference between different types of chains was negligible, with both XW18 and XW19 achieving efficiencies of ∼8.3%. In contrast, for the dyes with an additional benzothiadiazole unit, the branched chain clearly outperformed the linear one, with XW21 presenting an efficiency of 7.50%, obviously higher than 6.46% obtained for XW20. These observations may be rationalized by the fact that the benzothiadiazole unit might induce more severe dye aggregation, which can be more effectively suppressed by the branched chains.
4. Optimization of the acceptor
The electron acceptor, usually also acting as the anchoring group, plays an imperative role in the sensitizing dye, since it is closely correlated with the adsorption geometry on TiO2, the electron injection behavior and the adsorption strength.55 Various types of acceptor/anchoring groups have been developed hitherto, among which the most extensively used are the carboxylic acid and cyanoacrylic acid groups. By scrutinizing the literature, it is interesting to find out that the cyanoacrylic acid moiety is more frequently used for metal-free organic dyes, while the carboxylic acid moiety seems to exhibit better photovoltaic performance for porphyrin dyes. A systematic comparison is thus required to unravel the structure–performance correlation in this respect. On the other hand, in recent years the incorporation of an auxiliary acceptor group has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to facilitate the intramolecular charge transfer and to modulate the energy levels for improving the dye performance. Hence we will focus on these two topics in this section. As a special supplement, some more robust anchors intended for long-term operation of DSSCs will also be briefly described.
4.1 Benzoic acid or cyanoacrylic acid, which is better?
In 2015, we reported systematic investigations on the effects of different acceptor groups as well as the neighboring ethynylene unit on the dye performance (Fig. 12).74 The results indicated that the ethynyl group induces dramatically red-shifted absorption, and the cyanoacrylic group induces slightly red-shifted absorption relative to the carboxyphenyl group. Hence, the absorption and IPCE spectra threshold wavelengths lie in the order of XW5 < XW6 < XW1 < XW7. However, XW7 showed a lower IPCE plateau and Jsc than XW1, as well as the lowest Voc of 610 mV among the four dyes, which could be attributed to the combined effects of its floppy structure and serious dye aggregation. Consequently, the PCEs lie in the order of XW5 (4.77%) < XW7 (5.75%) < XW6 (5.92%) < XW1 (7.09%). In consideration of the respective advantages of the ethynyl unit and the cyano unit and the drawbacks observed for XW7, dye XW8 was further designed and synthesized as a derivative of XW1 with an additional cyano group attached at one of the ortho-positions of the carboxyl group. As expected, XW8 exhibited the highest PCE of 7.59% among these dyes.
 Fig. 12  Molecular structures of XW1 and XW5–XW8 (ref. 74). 
4.2 The effect of benzothiadiazole as the auxiliary acceptor
Since the breakthrough of YD2-o-C8, three years later in 2014, a record PCE of ca. 13% was achieved for the sensitizer SM315 (Fig. 13), using the cobalt-based electrolyte.20 The most noticeable feature of SM315 was the incorporation of an additional benzothiadiazole unit adjacent to the carboxyphenyl anchoring group. The auxiliary electron acceptor group was demonstrated to effectively improve absorption, resulting in broad IPCE up to 800 nm with a high plateau. The achieved high Jsc of 18.1 mA cm−2 in combination with a high Voc of 0.91 V benefiting from the cobalt electrolyte finally leads to a high PCE of 13.0%.
 Fig. 13  Molecular structures of sensitizers SM315, GY50 and GY21 (ref. 20 and 75). 
In the same year, Yeh and Grätzel reported a similar dye GY5075 (Fig. 13), with the donor moiety identical to that of YD2-o-C8. To examine the influence of the phenyl spacer between the BTD and the carboxylic acid group, GY21 was also synthesized. Surprisingly, dramatically different PCEs of 12.75% and 2.52% were achieved for GY50 and GY21, respectively, using the cobalt-based electrolyte. Further tests indicate that the good performance of GY50 stems from the combined effect of reduced charge recombination, an upward shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge (which contributes to a higher Voc) and good charge-collection efficiency induced by the phenyl spacer.
In this respect, we have also designed various porphyrin dyes (Fig. 14). Incorporation of BTD in XW11 resulted in filling up the absorption valley between the Soret and Q bands along with improved Jsc relative to XW10. However, the PCE achieved for XW11 was only 7.8%, lower than 8.6% for XW10, which may be ascribed to aggravated aggregation and charge recombination caused by the BTD unit, as can be evidenced from the very low Voc of 645 mV obtained for XW11.44 To address this problem, we replaced the donor group with a triphenylamine unit substituted with multiple alkoxyl chains. In this case the decrease of Voc was successfully ameliorated and XW17 exhibited a higher PCE of 9.5% than 9.1% for XW16.68 Based on XW11, very recently we have provided another approach for molecular optimization. XW26–XW28 (Fig. 14) were thus designed and synthesized by attaching flexible alkyl chains to the phenylene ring of benzothiadiazole.76 Compared with XW11 (645 mV), higher Voc values were achieved for XW26–XW28 (700 mV, 701 mV and 711 mV, respectively), indicative of effective suppression of dye aggregation. However, the chain near the carboxyphenyl moiety in XW26 induced a large torsion angle of 57.2° between the benzothiadiazole segment and the carboxyphenyl group, which greatly decreased its Jsc and thus a low PCE of 5.19% was achieved. When the alkyl chains in XW26 were replaced with alkoxyl chains as shown by XW27, the torsion angle was relieved to 44.0° and a slightly higher efficiency of 6.42% was obtained. In contrast, XW28 contains only one alkyl chain near the ethynylene moiety, and it successfully avoided the serious distortion problem, resulting in a smaller dihedral angle of 36.0° and a dramatically improved efficiency of 9.12%. These results provide feasible approaches for suppressing dye aggregation while expanding the conjugation size, without seriously aggravating distortion of the dye molecules.
 Fig. 14  Molecular structures of XW10–XW11, XW16–XW17, and XW26–XW28 (ref. 44, 68 and 76). 
In the past two years, many research groups have developed more BTD-containing porphyrin dyes (Fig. 15) and systematically investigated the effect of the BTD unit. In 2016, Wang, Wu and coworkers introduced BTD into an N-annulated perylene-based porphyrin dye WW-9.77 Contrary to the preceding examples, WW-9 exhibited lower Jsc and lower Voc than WW-6, resulting in a lower efficiency of 9.2% relative to that of 10.6% achieved for WW-9 using the cobalt-based electrolyte. The authors attributed this inferiority to the longer molecular length, possibly more tilted adsorption orientation and more serious charge recombination of WW-9. In the same year, Diau, Wang and coworkers reported a dialkylaminophenyl-derived analogue LW24.78 A slightly higher PCE of 9.21% was obtained as compared to LD14 (9.01%). The authors pointed out that introduction of BTD significantly broadened the absorption spectra. However, it may slow down dye regeneration and accelerate charge recombination, as revealed by transient absorption spectra analysis and the charge extraction method, respectively. Zheng's group synthesized JA3 and JA4 by utilizing a bulky spirobifluorene substituted phenothiazine as the donor, and in their cases the introduction of BTD led to obviously increased Jsc and slightly decreased Voc, resulting in an elevated PCE (7.00%) as compared to the BTD-free JA3 (6.27%).69

4.3 Other auxiliary acceptors
Besides 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, other electron-withdrawing units such as quinoxaline and benzotriazole, which have been extensively used in organic sensitizers as auxiliary acceptors,79,80 are also promising building blocks for porphyrin sensitizers. They have been introduced to porphyrin sensitizers only recently. In 2016, Feng's group reported 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline-functionalized porphyrin dye LP-11 and a BTD-functionalized analogue LP-12 (Fig. 16).81LP-11 exhibits a Voc 13 mV higher than that of LP-12 because of the effective steric bulkiness. But LP-12 benefits from the strong electron-withdrawing BTD unit and finally the improvement in Jsc overcompensates its loss in Voc, resulting in a higher PCE of 7.37%. In 2017, Cao's group reported porphyrin dyes DHC-1 and DHC-2 bearing benzotriazole and triazolopyridine, respectively, as the auxiliary acceptor (Fig. 16).82DHC-2 exhibits higher absorption intensity due to the coplanar geometry of the acceptor moiety and achieves a higher PCE of 6.65% upon coadsorption with CDCA, as compared with that of 6.17% obtained for DHC-1.

4.4 Anchoring groups other than carboxylic acids: improvement in stability and durability
For practical applications of DSSCs, the long-term efficiency is extremely important, which is highly dependent on the binding ability of the anchoring group of the sensitizers. As described in the previous sections, excellent efficiencies have been achieved for sensitizers containing the commonly used electron acceptors of benzoic acid and cyanoacrylic acid. However, the carboxylic anchoring group tends to detach from TiO2 after long-term operation, resulting in lowered efficiencies. In this respect, more robust anchors have been developed as represented by 8-hydroxylquinoline,83 tropolone,25 hydroxamic acid,84 triethoxysilyl85 and pyridine-based anchors86 (Fig. 17). Despite lower or merely comparable efficiencies with respect to the carboxylic acid counterpart in freshly fabricated cells, they exhibit improved stability and durability and may be more promising for practical applications.

5. Coadsorption and cosensitization
As described in the previous sections, dye aggregation is an obstacle for improving the photovoltaic performance, especially for dyes like porphyrins with large π-conjugation frameworks, which must be fully addressed in developing efficient DSSCs.38 One effective approach is to utilize a bulky coadsorbent. On the other hand, porphyrins feature an absorption valley around 500 nm, which may be filled up by using a cosensitizer.87 Hence, coadsorption and cosensitization have been investigated as two effective approaches for further improving the photovoltaic performance of porphyrin based DSSCs.87 The most widely used coadsorbents are chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) (Fig. 18), which are usually added directly in the dye bath solution for simultaneous adsorption.56,88 Han and coworkers utilized the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) technique to observe the adsorption morphology of the ruthenium(II)-based “black dye” with or without DCA as the coadsorbent,89 and revealed that DCA was favorable for isolating the adsorbing dyes, suppressing their aggregation on the TiO2 surface and promoting electron injection. In addition to the applications for the ruthenium based dyes, DCA and CDCA have also been extensively used for metal-free organic dyes and porphyrin dyes to suppress aggregation. Table 1 shows selected CDCA coadsorption data by our group for the dyes described in the preceding sections.44,76 As typical examples shown in Fig. 19, XW26–XW28 all exhibit simultaneously improved Jsc and Voc after coadsorption with CDCA, resulting in higher PCEs. It is noteworthy that the effect of coadsorption on the photovoltaic performance is highly dependent on the porphyrin dye structure. For the dyes that do not suffer seriously from aggregation, the competing adsorption of a non-light-harvesting coadsorbent will reduce the dye loading amount and thus may exert negative effects.90 Meanwhile, the coadsorption condition practically requires elaborate optimization for each dye.91

Considering that CDCA and DCA are unable to absorb sunlight, it is reasonable for researchers to think about replacing them with cosensitizers that play dual roles of suppressing aggregation and converting sunlight to electricity. Porphyrin dyes are considered to be very suitable for cosensitization with other dyes, since the relatively large size and high molar absorption coefficient of porphyrin would allow sufficient space for small organic dyes to coadsorb. An ideal cosensitizer for porphyrin dyes is supposed to have the following characters: (i) the absorption spectrum of the cosensitizer should be complementary to that of the porphyrin dye in order to make full use of the sunlight, i.e., it should exhibit strong absorption around 500 nm, corresponding to the absorption valley of most porphyrin dyes; (ii) the cosensitizer should not induce too severe competing adsorption with the porphyrin dye, instead, it should adsorb at the interstitial sites of porphyrin dyes to form a compact adsorbing layer; (iii) the matching of molecular size and shape should also be taken into account, although the knowledge in this respect is still scarce at the present stage.
In 2012, Yeh and Diau reported a three-component cocktail cosensitization system comprising a mono-porphyrin YD2-o-C8, a metal-free organic dye CD4 and a di-porphyrin YDD6 (Fig. 20).64 Although the isoamyloxy chains in YDD6 were not effective for solving the aggregation problem of the extended diporphyrin, YDD6 was finally demonstrated to be effective for cosensitization in capturing sunlight in the long-wavelength region of 700–800 nm. After strenuous efforts in optimizing the ratio of the three dyes plus CDCA in the cocktail solution, the best device achieved a PCE of 10.4% (Jsc = 19.28 mA cm−2, Voc = 753 mV, FF = 0.719). Another example reported by Diau, Lin and coworkers in 2015 using LD14 (vide supra) and a dimeric porphyrin coded LDD1 also afforded an efficiency of 10.4%.23 In contrast to the “cocktail” method, a more commonly used approach is the stepwise cosensitization. Specifically, the TiO2 photoanode is first immersed in one dye solution, taken out and then immersed in another dye solution. In 2012, Diau, Lin and coworkers reported stepwise cosensitization of a fairly simple-structured porphyrin LD12 and an organic dye CD5 (Fig. 21),92 achieving a high Voc of 736 mV, higher than 711 mV and 689 mV obtained for the devices sensitized by the individual dyes of LD12 and CD5, respectively, while in most reported cosensitized systems the Voc lies in between those obtained for the corresponding individual single-dye-sensitized devices. The interesting result was proposed to be a result of prolonged electron lifetime, and the authors further proposed that the two dyes match well in molecular size to form a densely packed dye-layer on TiO2 and thus effectively retard the charge recombination between the injected electrons and the I3− species in the electrolyte. Consequently, an improved efficiency of 9.0% was achieved for the cosensitized device.

In 2013, Chen, Zhu, and coworkers reported another stepwise cosensitization system of a porphyrin and an organic dye PT-C6 (Fig. 22).93 Interestingly, the post-adsorption of the organic dye did not induce very severe desorption of the porphyrin dye ZnP, as could be observed from the IPCE spectra and the dye loading amounts. These results indicate that PT-C6 has successfully taken the vacant sites left after porphyrin adsorption and the cosensitization results in more compact adsorption than ZnP itself to provide a better barrier against charge recombination. Finally, the cosensitized device attained a PCE of 10.1% under the optimized condition.

Our group has also developed efficient cosensitization systems based on porphyrin dyes. Fig. 23 shows the molecular structures of cosensitizers C1, XS3 and WS-5 based on diphenylamine, phenothiazine and indoline donors, respectively.42,94,95 All of them exhibit two main absorption bands at around 400 nm and 500 nm (Table 2), which are supposed to fill up the absorption valleys of the porphyrin dyes towards achieving panchromatic IPCE spectra (Fig. 24). Furthermore, all of them exhibited relatively high Voc values (Table 3), which may partially compensate the drawback of relatively low Voc values for normal porphyrin dyes. As a result, the cosensitized devices all exhibited dramatically improved Jsc values with respect to each individual dye, as well as intermediate Voc values which were higher than that of the porphyrin dyes and lower than that of the cosensitizers. Notably, using the spectrally broad XW11 and D–A–π–A structured cosensitizer WS-5, the Jsc and Voc were synergistically enhanced, achieving a striking efficiency of 11.5%, which was the highest efficiency obtained by non-ruthenium sensitizers based on the iodine electrolyte until then.44 It should be mentioned that all the cosensitization measurements listed in Table 3 were carried out by the stepwise approach, with porphyrin adsorbed first and then the cosensitizer. On this basis, we further investigated the XW4/WS-5 cosensitization system in detail, with an emphasis on the influence of the dye soaking sequence on cell performance.96 Interestingly, the inversed immersing order only afforded a PCE of 8.35%, much lower than that of 10.41% achieved for the normal order. These results may be ascribed to the large size of the porphyrin molecules, which might be difficult to be adsorbed in the presence of precedingly adsorbed WS-5.

In addition to porphyrin/organic-dye cosensitization systems, we also successfully developed cosensitization systems based on two porphyrin dyes XW22 and XW24 (Fig. 25).52 Although the coadsorption of CDCA with the individual porphyrin dyes XW22 and XW24 only afforded moderate efficiencies of 6.97% and 5.56%, respectively, we designed a cocktail cosensitization system by taking advantage of the complementary character of the IPCE spectra for the two dyes, and a high PCE of 8.60% was achieved by delicately modulating the ratios of the two dyes and CDCA in the immersing solutions.

6. Conclusions and outlook
We have briefly described the recent progress in developing efficient porphyrin-sensitized solar cells by means of molecular engineering in combination with coadsorption and cosensitization strategies. Subtle modifications of the donor, porphyrin core and acceptor moieties can exert significant influences on the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, a stepwise and systematic molecular optimization approach might be reasonable to make continuous achievements. The rigidity-induced π–π aggregation remains one of the major limitations for porphyrin dyes. Fortunately, introduction of alkyl chains or bulky units into suitable positions of the donor, porphyrin macrocycle and acceptor all proved to be effective for suppressing the aggregation. Meanwhile, it should be noted that large torsion angles should be avoided, especially within the acceptor part, which might greatly hamper the electron injection. Another limitation of porphyrin dyes comes from the absorption valley around 500 nm, which may be overcome by the following approaches: (i) strengthening the electronic communication between the donor and the porphyrin core as well as that between the porphyrin core and the acceptor by ethynylene linkage; (ii) introducing appropriate auxiliary acceptors such as benzothiadiazole to enhance the push–pull effect. On the other hand, coadsorption and cosensitization are both effective ways to suppress aggregation and charge recombination for improving cell performance. The combined use of different porphyrin dyes or the coexistence of porphyrin dyes and organic dyes may achieve effective cosensitization systems towards panchromatic absorption, although judicious design and time consuming optimization of experimental conditions are highly required.
Based on all the excellent results reported in achieving high PCEs and understanding the dye structure–performance correlation, future research may be focused on the following points:
(1) Further modifications of the porphyrin structures in novel and diverse ways. For example, we are attempting to envelop the porphyrin ring in a “strapped” way and check whether it works well on facilitating compact adsorption and retarding charge recombination.
(2) Integrating the advantageous characters into one molecule. On the basis of the endeavor to respectively optimize the donors, the porphyrin macrocycle and the acceptors for porphyrin dyes, it may be effective to combine the excellent optimized structural blocks to design and synthesize new porphyrin dyes. High photovoltaic performance may be achieved in this way.
(3) Further probing into the underlying principles for cosensitization. Despite a number of successful cosensitization systems, in many cases, cosensitization of two spectrally complementary dyes does not necessarily result in higher efficiencies. This implies that further research studies are desired to understand the underlying rules of cosensitization. In addition to the well understood complementary absorption, the matching in molecular size, shape and adsorption dynamics must also be taken into account.97 In this respect, theoretical calculations may find more applications in rationalizing the experimental results.
(4) Developing robust anchors for porphyrin dyes without obviously sacrificing the efficiency. Most of the more robust anchors reported hitherto give lower efficiencies than the commonly used carboxylic acid anchor. For practical applications, it is important and challenging to improve the stability on a high level of efficiency. In addition to optimizing the anchor groups, DSSCs based on solid or quasi-solid state electrolytes also may be promising.98–101
(5) Exploiting more potential use of porphyrins in the photovoltaic devices. Besides serving as conventional photosensitizers in DSSCs, porphyrins have been recently reported to be applied in perovskite solar cells for interfacial engineering,102 as hole-transporting materials,103–105 or as a component in the bulk-heterojunction layer for hybrid cells.106 These new attempts are encouraging further research on the functions and applications of porphyrin molecules.
Armed with all the acquired experiences and by way of combined theoretical and experimental methods, more efficient and stable photovoltaic devices are anticipated in the future by utilizing porphyrins.
