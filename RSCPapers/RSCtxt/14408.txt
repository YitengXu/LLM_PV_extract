    , Accepted 16th December 2022First published on 20th December 2022AbstractDue to their outstanding optoelectronic characteristics, ternary chalcogenides are considered an attractive choice for absorbers of visible light. Here, a novel family of ternary chalcogenides, Ba2ZnCh3 (Ch = S, Se, Te), is examined in the context of density functional theory calculations. The atomic locations in these materials are determined before the bulk modulus, cohesive energy, and lattice constant predictions. Our examined materials are semiconductors by nature, as indicated by the electronic band profiles with both the WC-GGA potential and TB-mBJ potential revealing an energy gap between the valence and conduction bands. Using full geometrical optimization and the force minimization technique based on Broyden's scheme, the interior atomic positions and the relaxed structures were obtained. The formation energies are likely more consistent with a convex hull near the configuration of interest. The cohesive energies confirmed that Ba2ZnS3 has the most cohesive nature as compared to the other two materials. Likewise, the calculated components of the dielectric function of the individual materials were anisotropic having dissimilar values along different dimensions. The computed sharp peaks of the absorption coefficient for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 confirm their improved absorption behavior in the UV range. Moreover, the thermoelectric characteristics were computed, and the findings are detailed, indicating that all of these materials are efficient for thermoelectric device applications.
1. Introduction
Solar energy remarkably solves environmental and energy crises more efficiently.1–4 Considerable efforts are being carried out to discover novel and fascinating visible-light harvesting materials that could improve the solar cells’ proficiency.5–8 Due to their remarkable electronic and optical properties, these metal-based chalcogenides attracted researcher attention specifically for solar energy conversion.9,10 Several experimental and theoretical explorations have been performed to study these chalcogenide materials that enhance the performance of devices along with the discovery of some novel materials, which vary in terms of their toxicity, stability in their electronic structure, cost, and capacity to interact efficiently with the light energy.11,12 Among these chalcogenides, alkaline-earth-based materials having the general formula as A2XCh3 (A = alkaline earth and X = TMs; Ch = chalcogens) are of utmost consideration due to their excellent stability and best optoelectronic nature.13 Materials such as Eu-doped Sr2ZnS313 and Mn-doped Ba2ZnS314 were found to exhibit fluorescence-like behavior and investigated for their applications in color displays and lamps.15 The emitted colors from the materials could be altered by an exchange at the alkaline or Zn sites. The absorption spectrum of Ba2ZnTe3 in its single crystal displayed an absorption edge at around 2.1 eV and corresponded with the dark red color of the crystals.16
Similarly, zinc-based chalcogenides are considered excellent photocatalysts because of their smaller band gap values and high photosensitivity.17–23 A novel and potential visible-light chalcogenide photocatalyst, i.e., Ba2ZnSe3 was synthesized recently by Zhou et al.24 using the traditional solid-state reaction approach. The optical and thermoelectric properties of the material were studied and it was found to be thermally stable with no phase transition from 106 K to room temperature. Moreover, they proved that Ba2ZnSe3 is a handy material for H2 evolution by performing H2-production photocatalytic experiments. The photo-electrochemical test, thermal measurement, and photocatalytic activity experiment showed that Ba2ZnSe3 displays excellent thermal stability, a significant visible-light responsive photocatalytic efficiency, and a remarkable cyclability, which are favourable for its application in many devices. All these characteristics make Ba2ZnSe3 a potential and active photocatalyst.24 Prakash et al.25 also synthesized dark red and yellow crystals of two ternary type novel chalcogenides Ba2ZnQ3 (Q = Se and Te) and studied their crystal structures, along with the electronic and optical features. Their inclusive study supports the previous results of Zhou et al. that Ba2ZnSe3 is a potential photocatalyst. The results confirmed Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 to be semiconductors having a band gap value of about 2.6 and 1.9 eV, respectively. Likewise, Ba2ZnS3 was initially synthesized by Hoppe et al.26 by bombarding zinc oxide and barium oxide in the presence of hydrogen sulfide. Further heating of the sample resulted in the formation of some tiny, translucent needle like single crystals.27 Afterward, some other experiments28–30 proved that the materials possess fascinating luminescent behavior. The Ba2ZnS3 material when doped with Mn/Eu/Ce was described as different coloured phosphors having applications in the manufacturing of various types of LEDs.31–34 Recent studies also proved that tuneable emission of Eu, and Ce doped Ba2ZnS3 coupled with blue LEDs can be employed in the production of numerous white light sources.35 Similarly, Ba2ZnS3: Eu2+ co-doped with halide ions displayed a notable conversion of green to red light and had remarkable applications in solar energy utilization.36
Besides the optoelectronic properties, the thermoelectric properties of materials too have recently attracted substantial attention and have become significant for scientific research, being the base of numerous renewable energy applications. Additionally, thermoelectric generators are among the best and most effective means to recover and convert surplus heat into electrical energy; the technology is primarily based on the Seebeck effect. These modern-day technological achievements in electric power generation were favourable as compared to the old technologies. The main endeavour to study materials, specifically semiconductors, is to validate if they can be used in advanced power source equipment. To the best of our knowledge, very few studies exist on the electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties of these novel ternary Ba2ZnCh3 (Ch = S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides with DFT calculations in the literature. As these Zn-based ternary chalcogenides are recognized for their low toxicity, stability, and low cost, we decided to study these materials and explored their structural, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric properties. Ba2ZnCh3 (Ch = S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides in the orthorhombic structure phase were investigated. In the second part of our work, we provide comprehensive details about the calculations we performed, and the results obtained regarding the structural, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric properties are interpreted and analysed in the third section. Finally, in the Conclusion section, we emphasize the most significant deductions which were extracted through the present scheme of study.
2. Computational details
The full-potential linearize-augment-plane-wave method of density functional theory (DFT), is used to calculate the structural, electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties. The LDA (local density approximations) and WC-GGA potential (Wu-Cohen generalize gradient approximations) were initially used to optimize the structures under investigation.37,38 The precise band gap values were calculated using the advanced TB-mBJ (Trans Blaha modified Becke Johnson) correlations. In the present calculations, we employed and chose a very accurate and advanced type potential called the Trans-Blaha modified Becke–Johnson (TB-mBJ) potential besides the formerly mentioned WC-GGA potential because of the fact that this potential (TB-mBJ) optimizes competently all the additional potentials too and gives an improved and accurate band structure calculation result which is most likely in good agreement in most of the cases with the experimental results. We, therefore, selected the Trans-Blaha modified Becke–Johnson (TB-mBJ) potential along with WC-GGA and implemented it for the exchange and correlation effect. The TB-mBJ approach affects the conduction band and also consequently corrects and helps measure accurately the transitions and optical properties.39 The performance and the trend of optoelectronic nature, energy band gaps, the lower and high bandwidth in conduction/valence bands, nominal transition energies, projected density of states, complex dielectric function, energy loss function, absorption coefficients, reflectivity spectra, and refractive index along with the band gap energy levels were all carefully considered. Fig. 1 shows the calculated unit cell structure of our studied materials.

The muffin-tin radii for the Ba, Zn, S, Se, and Te are set as 2.43, 2.32, 2.21, 2.09, and 2.01, respectively. A k sample of 49 k-points in the first BZ plane wave expansion with the RMT × KMAX = 7, and GMAX = 8, was chosen, which was considered to be sufficient. For the calculations of optical properties to get a denser mesh, we employed 1000 k-points. For the BZ integrations, a self-consistent convergence of around 10−3 Ry was used. The Kramers–Kronig relations were also employed to deduce the real component of the complex dielectric function ε1(ω) from the imaginary component, ε2(ω)) and the transitions from the VBM to CBM have been used to calculate the imaginary component ε2(ω) from the momentum matrix. Both the real and the imaginary components are expressed for the arbitrary phase as follows.40,41 (1) (2)
Additionally, the other significant linear optical parameters including the electron energy loss function L(ω), absorption coefficient I(ω), reflectivity R(ω), and the refractive index n(ω), can be obtained from both ε1(ω), and ε2(ω) by means of the following relations.40,41 (3) (4) (5) (6)
Additionally, BoltzTrap software42 was used to determine the thermoelectric transport characteristics. These essential thermoelectric properties may be computed using the Onsager relations and the Boltzmann transport theory.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural properties
We studied the isostructural ternary type barium zinc chalcogenide materials which crystallize in the orthorhombic phase with the space group Pnma and adopt the K2AgI3 structure43 as illustrated in Fig. 1. These material structures show an infinite chain along the b axis with corner-sharing ZnX4 tetrahedra. Four tetrahedrally coordinated chalcogenide atoms are attached to Zn atoms. In the ZnS tetrahedra the S–Zn–S angles are in the range of106.48°–116.13° and the Se–Zn–Se angles ranges between 106.32°–116.07°. Similarly, for the ZnTe4 tetrahedra, the Te–Zn–Te angles are in the range of 106.73°–114.13°. For distorted ZnX4 tetrahedra the flawless tetrahedron angles must be 109.471° each. For Ba2ZnS3 material, the distortion is maximum and it is minimum for Ba2ZnTe3 among the three materials. Most of the electronic and optical properties are directly affected when the materials crystallize in different structural phases. The most stable and favorable structural phases are deduced by measuring the ground state energy which helps to foresee any additional structural variations in materials. To obtain the most stable structures the computed ground state energies for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3 and Ba2ZnTe3 materials are found to be 67.156 (a.u), 67.214 (a.u), and 67.347 (a.u), respectively. Before the lattice constant, cohesive energy, and bulk modulus predictions, the atomic positions in these materials are determined.
By means of full geometrical optimization along with the total energy and the force minimization technique based on Broyden's scheme,44 the interior atomic positions and the relaxed structures were obtained. For this reason, the force applied to the individual atom was much less than 0.5 Ry a.u−1. The LDA and WC-GGA computed optimized lattice parameters are shown in Table 1. It is noticed that the chalcogen radii effectively alter the lattice parameter “c” and a much greater disparity is concluded in “c” related to the parameter “a” while moving from Ba2ZnS3 to Ba2ZnTe3 as seen in Table 1. To check the stability, the formation energy of the studied materials was calculated using the relation: Eform = E(Ba2ZnCh3) − E(Ba) − E(Zn) − 2E(Ch)(7)

The computed formation energies for all the materials are listed in Table 1. Rest smaller as compared to the elemental hull, having a range of −1.31, and −3.00 (eV f.u.−1). A handy association was experienced between the formation energies and the degree of ionicity between the Zn–Ch bonds, which means that the smaller formation energies, smaller would be the ionic bonds. The formation energies are likely more consistent with the convex hull near the configuration of interest.47 Additionally, the cohesive energy of the materials was also computed using the relation: (8)
Here NBa, NZn and NCh inside the unit cell structure of Ba2ZnCh3 materials are the number of Ba, Zn, and Ch atoms, respectively, and EBaatom, EZnatom, and EChatom are the isolated energies of Ba, Zn, and Ch atoms, respectively, and finally  shows the total energy of the bulk Ba2ZnCh3 material. A comparison of the cohesive energies confirmed that Ba2ZnS3 has the most cohesive nature as compared to the other two materials because of its maximum energy value and so has the most stable structure. Similarly, we also computed the bulk modulus ‘B’ that helps measure the resistance to the deformation produced within a material because of an externally applied hydro-static pressure. The calculated bulk moduli also confirmed a more resistive nature of Ba2ZnS3 material against any external pressure as compared to that of Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 materials; the variance is probably attributed to the bond strength between the atoms of Ba2ZnS3, and the other materials and the change in the bond number.
3.2 Electronic properties
For technological applications, the electronic properties of materials have an important role and are also taken into account to determine various other physical properties. The electronic structures of different classes of materials could be accurately computed using various DFT-based computational techniques. To investigate the electronic properties, we performed Scf computations.40 The electronic density of states and the band structure calculations have a key contribution that may help determine the electronic characteristics of the materials. To gain deep knowledge of the electronic properties we calculated the DOS as illustrated in Fig. 2(a–c). Similarly, the electronic band structures of the proclaimed materials are computed along a high symmetry point of the Brillouin zone using both the WC-GGA and the accurate m-BJ technique by using the optimized geometry of the unit cell. Our computed T-DOS for the three materials well supports the electronic band structure results and confirms a semiconductor nature of all these materials. It was obvious from the T-DOS of all three materials that zinc and the corresponding chalcogen atoms have a main contribution in the construction of the valence band although a developed population of states in the valence band closer to the Fermi level is observed in these band structures because of the chalcogen (Ch) atoms. To get more in depth knowledge related to the T-DOS we carefully examined the P-DOS of the probed materials. For the partial density of states (P-DOS) having a comparable behavior in all three materials, the alkaline atom Ba appears to have an outstanding influence on the construction of the conduction band while a minor contribution was noticed from Zn and the chalcogen (Ch) atoms in its formation. A significant role is played by the Ba-d states in the formation of the conduction band in all three materials. Preliminary from the lowermost energy side for the case of Ba2ZnS3 in the energy range of about −12.0 eV to −10.0 eV the localized electronic states rise because of the p orbitals of the Ba atoms and s orbitals of the S atoms, along with a minor role of the (p, d) orbitals of the Zn atoms.
 Fig. 2  Computed total and partial density of states for (a) Ba2ZnS3, (b) Ba2ZnSe3, (c) Ba2ZnTe3. 
Similarly, at the top of the valence band ranging from about −6.4 eV to 0.0 eV, the localized electronic structure has the main role due to the s state of the S and d state of Zn atoms, with a small contribution from the (s, p) states of both Ba and Zn atoms. Very similar behavior was observed in the case of Ba2ZnS3 in the P-DOS indicating the main role of the p orbitals of the Ba atoms and s orbitals of Se, and a slight role of the (p, d) states of the Zn aforementioned energy range. Likewise, from about −6.4 eV to 0.0 eV, a major influence is noticed from the s state of the Se and d state of Zn atoms, with a small contribution from the (s, p) states of both Ba and Zn atoms. For the case of Ba2ZnTe3 materials in the energy range of about −10.5 eV to −9.0 eV, the major role was noticed only due to the s state of the Te atoms with a slight role from the Ba-p and the (s, p) states of Zn atoms. The computed P-DOS indicates somewhat mixed contributions of the orbitals of all the component atoms in the establishment of the conduction band which specifies the existence of the sp hybridization in all three materials. The calculated electronic band profiles of the three materials with both WC-GGA potentials displayed in Fig. 3(a–c), and the TB-mBJ potentials displayed in Fig. 4(a–c), clearly indicate an energy gap between valence and conduction bands. The occurrence of band gaps revealed the fact that our studied materials are semiconductors in nature. The predicted band gap values using WC-GGA for Ba2ZnS2, Ba2ZnSe2, and Ba2ZnTe2, were 2.12 eV, 1.72 eV and 1.33 eV, respectively, and with TB-mBJ approximation they were 2.38 eV, 2.04 eV and 1.64 eV, respectively. As expected, the WC-GGA calculations underestimated the energy gap values and the computed TB-mBJ calculations were somewhat in good agreement with the experimental values as can be seen in Table 2.

Additionally, from the computed band profile the valence band maxima and the conduction band minima both lie at the Γ-point of the Brillouin zone indicating a direct band gap nature in each of the materials. Moreover, the corresponding Fermi level is randomly shifted towards zero value, while employing both approximations the attained electronic band structures are very much alike. In this work, we only used the WC-GGA and TB-mBJ potentials as both give significant details about the optical response. In the electronic band structure profiles, the formation of individual bands was recognized using the information from the computed density of states. In all three materials the Zn-d and the chalcogen Ch-p orbitals were responsible for both the uppermost bands in the valence band region. Similarly, a major role of the Ba-d state is involved in the formation of the conduction band with some slight contributions from the Ch-p and (p, d) states of Zn in the case of all three materials. It may be noticed that the fat valence band maxima are fairly slightly hybridized as compared to the upper conduction band minima in these materials. The Ba atoms seem to be bonded ionically with the other atomic lattices in these materials, and a covalent nature is observed in the Zn-Ch pairs. The σp–p interactions among the Ch-pz and Zn-pz states in the range from −2.8 eV to the Fermi level form the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO).
3.3 Optical properties
The linear optical properties of these alkaline-based chalcogenide materials were expressed in terms of the complex dielectric function ε(ω), where ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω). For metals, the interband transitions hold supreme importance, while for semiconducting materials just the transition between the band regions is taken into account.31,53 From Fig. 5(a) the real part ε1(ω) turns out negative at about 6.42 eV, 5.81 eV, and 4.87 eV for the Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 materials, respectively; this suggests that up to these energy limits, for the positive ε1 value, the materials have a conducting nature and an insulating nature, for the negative ε1 value, for the incident photon. The ε1(0) which is the static dielectric constant is generally specified as having a small energy limit for the ε1(ω). A larger value of ε1(0), is observed for a small gap value in our studied materials, which verifies Penn's model,32 as expressed using the relation ε1(0) ≈ 1 + (hωp/Eg)2, which means that larger ε1(0) is yielded for a material with a small band gap value. This was confirmed from the computed static values ε1(0) of 5.22 for Ba2ZnS3, 6.12 for Ba2ZnSe3, and 7.71 for Ba2ZnTe3 as observed in Fig. 5(a). The imaginary component of the dielectric constant that signifies the photon's absorption principally describes the optoelectronic nature of materials.
 Fig. 5  Calculated (a) real component, (b) imaginary components of the dielectric function, (c) energy loss function L(ω), and (d) absorption coefficient I(ω) for Ba2ZnCh3 (Ch = S, Se, and Te) materials. 
We resolved the optical spectra and integrated all the electronic transitions and deduced the imaginary component ε2(ω) as shown in Fig. 5(b), suggesting that the edge of optical bands initiates at the energy values of 2.0 eV, 1.7 eV, and 1.4 eV for the Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 materials, respectively. Up to an energy value of about 6.5 eV, some sharp peaks were observed that were most probably due to the electric dipole transition between the Ba-d and Y-p states of the atoms in the studied materials. These sharp peaks of ε2(ω) were located at about 5.2 eV for Ba2ZnS3, 5.3 eV for Ba2ZnSe3, and 4.6 eV for Ba2ZnTe3 materials. The transition was dynamic by splitting off the valence bands in these materials that caused the ε2(ω) to shift to these energy values. The redshifted peak positioned at about 4.6 eV for the Ba2ZnTe3 is likely associated with a small band gap as compared to Ba2ZnS3, and Ba2ZnSe3 materials. The imaginary components decline unceasingly while crossing the aforementioned energy range. Likewise, the components of the dielectric function of the individual materials were anisotropic with dissimilar values along different dimensions. The sun optical absorption region completely fits with the optical region of our investigated materials, suggesting that they absorb more in the visible spectra.
We computed the absorption coefficient that depends on the frequency, as seen in Fig. 5(c) which helps to categorize materials for efficient solar cell application. An outstanding optical absorption was observed in the extended energy plot from 4.0 eV up to 12.0 eV. Among the three materials, Ba2ZnTe3 gives a key instigation in the optical absorption spectra which continuously increases in the 2.4 eV to 5.0 eV energy range. The absorption coefficient, for Ba2ZnS3, has incessantly sharp peaks, followed by Ba2ZnTe3 and Ba2ZnSe3 materials. The remarkable visible light harvesting capacity of the Ba2ZnS3 material was verified from the computed absorption coefficient spectra. The absorption spectra are most likely comparable in the visible range for both Ba2ZnS3 and Ba2ZnSe3 materials, while Ba2ZnTe3 displays fairly dissimilar performance with an intense increasing shift at around 2.1 eV. A significant role of concentration is observed in the absorption spectra, which indicates the energy at which the absorption noticeably initiates to grow. The onset in the absorption spectra for the studied materials is in the range of 1.2–2.5 eV, relating to the peak in the AM1.5 solar radiation spectrum range which suggests their suitability in solar cell applications.33 Our calculated absorption onset for the Ba2ZnTe3 material with a direct band nature was about 2.0 eV making it a potential material for solar cell application. The sharp peaks of the absorption coefficient are at around 7.3 eV, 6.9 eV, and 6.4 eV for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3, respectively, confirming their improved absorption behavior in the UV range.
The important electron energy loss L(ω), shown in Fig. 5(d), is used to evaluate the valuable energy of a material due to the fast-moving electrons. For Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3, very strong peaks in the L(ω) spectrum appear at 11.9 eV, 12.1 eV, and at 12.2 eV respectively; the basic reason is the excitation of plasmons that are generated at the VBM and CBM. These observed high peak values in the energy loss parameter occur at the energy values where the dielectric real part reaches the zero value. Isotropy can be noticed in the lowest UV range, and also observed in an extended range in the energy loss plots of the studied materials. A very insignificant energy loss exists in the range of about 0 eV to 4.0 eV in these materials. The reported highly intense energy loss function values are about 1.05, 1.02, and 1.33 for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 materials, respectively. The derived reflectivity parameter R(ω) from the refractive index regulates the light energy reflected from a solid surface. In Fig. 6(a), the reflectivity as a function of light energy is presented in which the zero-frequency limit R(0) was observed at 0.16 for Ba2ZnS3, 0.18 for Ba2ZnSe3 and 0.21 for Ba2ZnTe3 materials.
 Fig. 6  Calculated (a) reflectivity R(ω) and (b) refractive index n(ω), for Ba2ZnCh3 (Ch = S, Se, and Te) materials, respectively. 
Beyond the visible region and in the UV region there exist some intense and sharp peaks in the reflectivity confirming them to be promising shielding materials especially for the UV rays. A variation exists in the UV range, also having a small rise in the IR region, which is accountable because of the inter-band transition. The reflectivity also shows an increasing trend with the substitutions of the Se and Te with S atoms in these materials. Additionally in the UV range, the plasmon oscillation also has a significant response in the reflectivity spectra. The refractive index too possesses a dynamic nature in linear optical behavior of materials, which is ascribed to the atomic exchanges at the microscopic level. As confirmed from Fig. 6(b), the static value n(0) increases on replacing S with Se, and Te in these materials. The computed n(0) values are 2.25, 2.49, and 2.71, for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3, respectively. The values initiate in the absence of lattice oscillations about their mean position. Birefringence has a significant role in non-absorption spectral regions at less than the band gap energies or at around zero frequency. These maximum static values are fundamentally initiated due to the first direct type of electronic transitions from the valence to conduction band. Our calculated maximum refractive index values exist in the range between 2.0–5.0 eV, confirming these alkaline-based materials to be more active in a variety of different optoelectronic devices operating in the visible range. The relation n2(0) = ε1(∞) between the static part of the dielectric real component and the refractive index n(0) also proves the comparison trend in our studied systems.
3.4 Thermoelectric properties
The graph in Fig. 7(a) shows that the thermal conductivity values at 100 K for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 materials are 11 × 1014 W m−1 K−1 s−1, 11 × 1014 W m−1 K−1 s−1 and 9 × 1014 W m−1 K−1 s−1, respectively. We calculated only the electronic part of thermal conductivity. The relaxation time is crucial for determining the electronic transport coefficient of the TE material, which is dependent on the relaxation time approximation of the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory.54 The relaxation period is typically affected by a variety of scattering mechanisms, including magnetic scattering, electron–electron interactions, electron–phonon interactions, defects and impurity scattering, etc. As a result, choosing a time for rest is often difficult. With the increasing temperature the thermal conductivity values almost increase uniformly and at a little above 400 K the observed values overlap for these compounds at 3.6 × 1015 W m−1 K−1 s−1. The highest thermal conductivity values are observed at 900 K temperature, which are 7.8 × 1015 W m−1 K−1 s−1, 7.9 × 1015 W m−1 K−1 s−1 and 8.4 × 1015 W m−1 K−1 s−1 for the Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 materials, respectively. The thermal conductivity increases from low to high values in the temperature range of 100 K to 850 K due to the thermal excitation of charge carriers, which enhances the heat conduction procedure. From the computed plots, Ba2ZnTe3 is shown to have maximum thermal conductivity values compared to Ba2ZnS3, and Ba2ZnSe3 material. In Fig. 7(b) the Seebeck coefficient “S” is plotted against temperatures from 100 K to 900 K for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3. The S values at 100 K are −17.4 × 10−6 V K−1, 4.4 × 10−6 V K−1, and 6.8 × 10−7 V K−1 for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3, respectively. With an increase in temperature, the Seebeck coefficient for Ba2ZnS3 shows an increasing trend, except for Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 for which it shows a decreasing response in the positive domain, revealing the presence of majority charge carriers as holes up to a temperature range of 450 K. At approximately 900 K the value for Ba2ZnSe3 and Ba2ZnTe3 becomes −15.3 × 10−6 V K−1 and −9.0 × 10−6 V K−1, respectively, and for Ba2ZnS3 the value becomes −5.7 × 10−6 V K−1. From low to high temperature the values for Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 shift from positive to the negative side which is due to the electronic excitation from the valence band to the conduction band across the Fermi-level and due to high-temperature exposition. At somewhat above room temperature the materials show negative Seebeck coefficient values, which confirms that electrons are the majority charge carriers.
 Fig. 7  Calculated temperature dependent (a) thermal conductivity, (b) Seebeck coefficient, (c) electrical conductivity, (d) specific heat capacity, and (e) figure of merit for Ba2ZnCh3 (Ch = S, Se, and Te) materials. 
The calculated electrical conductivity values as presented in Fig. 7(c) for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 materials at 100 K temperature are 3.50 × 1020 m3 mol−3, 4.02 × 1020 m3 mol−3 and 2.98 × 1020 m3 mol−3, respectively, and the values then start increasing with the increasing temperature only for Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 materials. Except for Ba2ZnTe3 the electrical conductivity remains constant for the other two materials with the increasing temperature. We observed approximately the same value of about 3.63 × 1020 m3 mol−3, 3.71 × 1020 m3 mol−3, and 3.46 × 1020 m3 mol−3 for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 materials, respectively, at 900 K temperature. There are steady and constant increases up to a temperature of 850 K which might be because of the thermal effects on electronic spin movement in the studied materials. In Fig. 7(d) the thermoelectric specific heat capacity has been plotted against temperature from 100 K to 900 K. The observed values for these compounds at 100 K are 0.9 J mol−1 K−1, 1.4 J mol−1 K−1 and 1.3 J mol−1 K−1 for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3, respectively. As the temperature rises, the specific heat capacity of these materials increases, and the highest Cv values at 900 K for these materials approach 13.3 J mol−1 K−1, for Ba2ZnS3, 14.8 J mol−1 K−1 for Ba2ZnSe3, and 13.4 J mol−1 K−1 for Ba2ZnTe3. The plots show an increasing trend of Cv for both Ba2ZnS3 and Ba2ZnSe3 except Ba2ZnTe3 for which a very small and slow increase in Cv is observed. At high temperatures, Ba2ZnTe3 has low specific heat capacity values as compared to Ba2ZnS3 and Ba2ZnSe3 which have high specific heat capacity values. The computed figure of merit is shown in the Fig. 7(e). The figure of merit increases with increasing temperature for these, and it has an extreme value of about 0.48 at a temperature value of 900 K. Likewise the ZT value for both Ba2ZnS3 and Ba2ZnSe3 is about 0.16 at room temperature and 0.06 for Ba2ZnTe3 material.
4. Conclusion
A detailed analysis of the electronic structure, interatomic bonding, and optical, and thermoelectric properties of alkaline-based ternary chalcogenides has been carried out in this work employing the most accurate first-principles calculations. The calculated ground state energies for Ba2ZnS3, Ba2ZnSe3, and Ba2ZnTe3 are 67.156 (a.u), 67.214 (a.u), and 67.347 (a.u), respectively. When moving from Ba2ZnS3 to Ba2ZnTe3, the chalcogen radii effectively affect the lattice parameter “c”, and a considerably higher difference in “c” is concluded compared to the paramete1–54 r “a”. A useful relationship was discovered between the formation energy and the degree of ionicity between the Zn–Ch bonds, which suggests that lesser formation energies, weaker would be the ionic bonds. The bulk moduli also confirmed the more resistive nature of the Ba2ZnS3 material against any external pressure when compared to Ba2ZnSe3 and Ba2ZnTe3 materials; the difference is most likely due to the bond strength between the atoms of Ba2ZnS3 and the other materials, as well as the change in the bond number. All of these materials have a semiconductor character, according to our computed T-DOS. It was clear that zinc and the matching chalcogen atoms played a significant role in the formation of the valence band. The Ba-d states play an important role in the conductivity of these materials. Furthermore, the valence band maxima and conduction band minima both sit near the – point of the Brillouin zone, showing that these materials have a direct band gap nature. The pp interactions between the Ch-pz and Zn-pz states generate the highest occupied molecular orbitals, with energies ranging from −2.8 eV to the Fermi level (HOMO). The transition was critical because it led to a shift at these energy values by breaking off the valence bands in certain materials. The redshifted peak for Ba2ZnTe3 is likely connected with its modest band gap when compared to Ba2ZnS3 and Ba2ZnSe3 materials. The absorbance coefficient for Ba2ZnS3 is constantly sharp, followed by Ba2ZnTe3 and Ba2ZnSe3. The Ba2ZnS3 material demonstrated a great visible light harvesting capacity in the estimated absorption coefficient spectra. The absorption spectra of Ba2ZnS3 and Ba2ZnSe3 are most likely comparable in the visible region, whereas that of Ba2ZnTe3 exhibits a somewhat distinct performance with an intense rising shift at around 2.1 eV. In the energy loss plots of the examined materials, isotropy can be shown in the lowest UV range and in the extended range. Beyond the visible and UV regions, there are some intense and dramatic peaks in reflectivity, confirming that they are potential shielding materials, specifically for UV rays. Our computed maximum refractive index values confirm that these alkaline-based materials are more efficient in a wide range of visible-range optoelectronic devices. Thermal excitation of charge carriers increases the thermal conductivity from low to high values at temperatures ranging from 100 K to 900 K, enhancing heat conduction in certain materials. The Seebeck coefficient for Ba2ZnS3 increases with temperature, excluding Ba2ZnSe3 and Ba2ZnTe3, which show a declining response in the positive region, indicating the presence of majority charge carriers as holes up to 450 K. At high temperatures, Ba2ZnTe3 shows low specific heat capacity values compared to high specific heat capacity values of Ba2ZnS3 and Ba2ZnSe3.
