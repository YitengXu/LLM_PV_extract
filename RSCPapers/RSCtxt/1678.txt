    , Accepted 3rd April 2012First published on 4th April 2012AbstractMetal oxide semiconductors with lower lying conduction band minimum and superior electron mobility are essential for efficient charge separation and collection in PbS-sensitized solar cells. In the present study, mesoscopic SnO2 was investigated as an alternative photoanode to the commonly used TiO2 and examined comprehensively in PbS-sensitized liquid junction solar cells. To exploit the capability of PbS in an optimized structure, cascaded nPbS/nCdS and alternate n(PbS/CdS) layers deposited by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method were systematically scrutinized. It was observed that the surface of SnO2 has greater affinity to the growth of PbS compared with TiO2, giving rise to much enhanced light absorption. In addition, the deposition of a CdS buffer layer and a ZnS passivation layer before and after a PbS layer was found to be beneficial for efficient charge separation. Under optimized conditions, cascaded PbS/CdS-sensitized SnO2 exhibited an unprecedented photocurrent density of 17.38 mA cm−2 with pronounced infrared light harvesting extending beyond 1100 nm, and a power conversion efficiency of 2.23% under AM 1.5, 1 sun illumination. In comparison, TiO2 cells fabricated under similar conditions showed much inferior performance owing to the less efficient light harnessing of long wavelength photons. We anticipate that the systematic study of PbS-sensitized solar cells utilizing different metal oxide semiconductors as electron transporters would provide useful insights and promote the development of semiconductor-sensitized mesoscopic solar cells employing panchromatic sensitizers.
Introduction
Narrow band gap semiconductors have been attracting great attention as panchromatic sensitizers in semiconductor-sensitized mesoscopic solar cells (SSCs) owing to their broad spectra of light absorption.1–9 Among the various narrow band gap semiconductors, lead sulfide (PbS) has a band gap energy of 0.41 eV in the bulk material, which can be easily tuned to harvest photons of different energies by reducing the size as a result of the quantum confinement effect.10,11 The capability of light absorption from the visible to the near infrared region in the solar spectrum as well as the inherent high extinction coefficient make PbS an important sensitizing material for SSC applications.12,13 In addition, owing to the quantized discrete band structures one salient property of PbS nanocrystals as light absorbers is the capability of multiple exciton generation. Internal quantum yield greater than unity has recently been reported by Parkinson et al. in PbS quantum dot (QD)-sensitized single crystal anatase TiO2 cells utilizing polysulfide electrolyte, paving the way to achieving power conversion efficiency beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit.1 While promising, the reported efficiency of liquid junction SSCs utilizing PbS is still much lower than those using semiconductor sensitizers of wider band gap, for instance, CdSe, CuInS2, etc.6,14–17 Therefore, efforts are continuously being made to improve the device performance by optimizing the conditions for sensitizer synthesis, employing counter electrodes with better catalytic activity, and exerting rigorous interfacial engineering, etc.
In PbS-sensitized solar cells, a type-II band alignment between PbS and metal oxide is desired to facilitate charge separation, where both the conduction and valence bands of the sensitizer are higher in energy than the corresponding band energies of the underlying metal oxide, so that the generated electrons and holes in PbS would separate rapidly by transferring electrons into the conduction band of metal oxide (i.e. TiO2). As such, the conduction band position and hence the size of PbS are critical to achieve efficient charge separation, and only quantum sized PbS nanocrystals with a sufficient offset of conduction band energy to that of metal oxide could be used, which on the other hand constrains the harvesting of long wavelength photons as a result of band gap augmentation. In addition, compositional synthesis has been emerging as an alternative approach to tune the light absorption and energetics of semiconductor sensitizers, where the optical band gap can be feasibly varied by changing the compositions of resulting semiconductors.18,19 These composition-tunable semiconductors can be easily made if the constituents or their precursors are miscible at the atomic level provided that they have sufficiently similar crystal structure and bond length for homogeneous mixture formation. Otherwise, very likely they will form segregated alloys or gradient nanocrystals.20,21 Ternary alloy CdxPb1−xS has been synthesized via chemical bath deposition by incorporating Cd2+ into a PbS matrix to modify the optical property. Although the value of x is limited to 0.15, it provides great flexibility in tuning the spectrum of PbS.22–24
Alternatively, instead of reducing the dimension of PbS or using a CdxPb1−xS alloy, metal oxides with lower conduction band minimum (CBM) could be employed to feasibly improve charge separation without squeezing the spectrum of the sensitizer. For instance, a favourable band alignment between TiO2 and PbS could only occur if sufficiently small PbS QDs are used as sensitizers, while ultrafast transient absorption measurement revealed that identical PbS QDs could easily inject electrons into SnO2 owing to the lower CBM of the latter.25 Much enhanced charge separation efficiency has also been observed in CdSe-sensitized SnO2 solar cells with close to unity external quantum efficiency.26 Considering the much higher electron mobility and wider optical band gap, SnO2 is deemed to be an ideal photoanodic material for PbS-sensitized mesoscopic solar cells, especially for the unambiguous observation of multiple exciton generation with over unity external quantum yield.1,27–29
In this study, mesoscopic SnO2 was employed and examined thoroughly for the first time as the photoanode in PbS-sensitized solar cells with polysulfide electrolyte to exploit the capability of panchromatic sensitizer PbS. Both cascaded and alternate PbS/CdS layers were deposited onto SnO2 by a successive ionic-layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method to evaluate their photovoltaic performance.6,16,30 Optical absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), J–V and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were conducted to understand the growth mechanism of sensitizers and the performance of these sensitized electrodes in solar cells. The cascaded nPbS/nCdS was found to be better than the alternate n(PbS/CdS) irrespective of metal oxide electrodes used. An overall power conversion efficiency of 2.23% with an unprecedented photocurrent density of 17.38 mA cm−2 was attained with PbS-sensitized SnO2 solar cells using aqueous polysulfide electrolyte and a Cu2S cathode, under simulated AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination.
Experimental section
Preparation of mesoscopic SnO2 and TiO2 electrodes
Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (Alfa Aesar, Nanoarc) mixed with a small amount of ethanol were ground by a pestle and mortar to break up agglomerates. Ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol were then mixed with the ground SnO2 powder following a previously reported procedure for making TiO2 paste.31 Fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO, TEC 15 Ω □−1) was cleaned by sequential sonication in 5% Decon 90 solution, deionized water and absolute ethanol. SnO2 electrodes were prepared by screen-printing the above-mentioned paste onto FTO glass several times in order to get an appropriate thickness. The printed films were then sintered in air by heating gradually to 325 °C and holding for 5 minutes, then at 375 °C for 5 minutes, at 450 °C for 15 minutes, and finally at 500 °C for 15 minutes. The resulting mesoporous SnO2 electrodes were semi-transparent. The area of the SnO2 layers was approximately 0.28 cm2 (circles with 0.6 cm diameter). Electrodes were then soaked in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 minutes and then rinsed with deionized water followed by drying in an electric oven at 70 °C. The thickness of the electrodes was determined by an Alpha-Step IQ surface profiler (KLA-Tencor). For comparison, TiO2 (Degussa, P25) nanoparticles were also used to make paste and electrodes. It is worthwhile to mention that a hole blocking layer and a scattering layer were not used in both SnO2 and TiO2 electrodes.
Preparation of PbS/CdS-sensitized mesoscopic electrodes
After masking the bare FTO with Kapton tape, leaving the mesoscopic SnO2 or TiO2 electrodes (6 mm diameter) uncovered, they were sensitized with PbS and CdS using previously reported SILAR methods.30,32 In a typical procedure, the SnO2 electrodes were immersed in a solution containing 0.02 M lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2, Aldrich, >99.0%) in methanol for 1 minute, to allow Pb2+ to adsorb onto the SnO2, and then rinsed with methanol for 1 minute to remove the excess Pb2+. Electrodes were then dried for 1 minute. The dried electrodes were then dipped into a solution containing 0.02 M sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, Sigma Aldrich, >98.0%) in a mixture of methanol and deionized water (1:1, v/v) for 1 minute, where the pre-adsorbed Pb2+ reacts with S2− to form the desired PbS. Electrodes were then rinsed in methanol for 1 minute and dried again for 1 minute. This procedure was repeated to deposit few layers of PbS onto SnO2 electrodes at first and then few layers of CdS were deposited subsequently. To deposit CdS onto PbS-coated SnO2 electrodes by the SILAR method, they were dipped into a solution containing 0.02 M cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, Fluka, >99.0%) in ethanol for 1 minute, and rinsed with ethanol for 1 minute, then dried for 1 minute. Subsequently, the dried electrodes were dipped into a solution containing 0.02 M Na2S·9H2O in a mixture of methanol and deionized water (1:1, v/v) for 1 minute. Then electrodes were dried again for 1 minute. Alternating layers of PbS and CdS were also deposited onto SnO2 electrodes to tune the photoresponse properties of resulting electrodes. All the depositions were performed in an argon-filled glove box, as PbS is not very stable in air. A ZnS passivation layer was deposited onto both sensitizer coated SnO2 electrodes by SILAR using 0.1 M aqueous zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Sigma Aldrich, >99.5%) and 0.1 M aqueous Na2S·9H2O, dipping for 1 minute in each solution, with 1 minute of rinsing in deionized water between each immersion in a precursor solution.26,32 For comparison, TiO2 electrodes ∼10 μm were used where the rest of the fabrication procedure was identical to that used for cascaded nPbS/nCdS and alternately deposited n(PbS/CdS)-sensitized SnO2 electrodes.
Material characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of PbS/CdS-sensitized SnO2 and TiO2 electrodes were carried out using a Bruker D8 using Cu Kα1radiation (λ = 0.154059 nm). The morphology of the above-mentioned electrodes was elucidated from transmission electron microscopy on a JEOL, JEM 2010F which also facilitated EDS analysis. Samples for TEM investigations were prepared by detaching both the sensitizer-coated SnO2 nanocrystals mechanically from the FTO glass substrate and dispersing in ethanol, followed by transferring one drop of the suspension onto a carbon coated copper grid. Optical density spectra were collected in a transmission mode utilizing a single beam in a Shimadzu UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Solidspec-3700) at room temperature.
Fabrication and characterization of PbS-sensitized solar cells
Brass foil (alloy 260, Alfa Aesar) was polished by sand paper and alumina suspension (de-agglomerated 1.00 and 0.05 microns) and cleaned using an ultrasonic bath with deionized water. The cleaned brass foil was then etched in 37% HCl at 70 °C for 5 minutes to expose more copper from the copper–zinc matrix and the yellowish colour of the brass changed to dark red.32,33 The etched brass was then rinsed with deionized water and dried at 70 °C. One drop of an aqueous polysulfide solution containing 1 M S and 1 M Na2S·9H2O was placed onto an unmasked part of the etched brass causing it to suddenly become black, indicating the formation of Cu2S. To fabricate SSCs with brass cathodes, a hole was made within 1 mm from the edge of the SnO2 layer on the photoanode. Photoanodes and cathodes were sealed together in a sandwich configuration using a hot-melt polymer (Meltonix 1170-25, Solaronix). The inter-electrode space was filled with an electrolyte by vacuum back filling. Holes were sealed using a small piece of hot-melt polymer and a microscope coverslip. The electrolyte was composed of 1 M S, 1 M Na2S·9H2O and 0.1 M NaOH in deionized water. IPCE spectra were measured with a spectral resolution of ca. 5 nm using a 300 W Xenon lamp and a grating monochromator equipped with order sorting filters (Newport/Oriel). The incident photon flux was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode (Newport/Oriel). Photocurrents were measured using an auto-ranging current amplifier (Newport/Oriel). Control of the monochromator and recording of photocurrent spectra were performed using a PC by running the TRACQ Basic software (Newport). Current–voltage characteristics under simulated AM 1.5 illumination were measured using a Keithley Source Meter and the PVIV software package (Newport). Simulated AM 1.5 illumination was provided by a Newport solar simulator and light intensity was measured using a calibrated Si solar cell. The active area of the cells was defined by a mask to be 0.1199 cm2.
Results and discussion
Morphological and structural characterization

Fig. 1 shows the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of cascaded 4PbS/4CdS and alternate 4(PbS/CdS) deposited on SnO2 electrodes. The SnO2 nanoparticles consisted of approximately 20 nm crystal grains, which show clear lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.334 nm corresponding to a crystal plane of (110) indexed to the tetragonal rutile structure (JCPDS No. 41-1445). Due to the high surface energy of PbS with respect to the underlying metal oxide in the depositing medium, scattered nanocrystals of hemispherical shape were observed at the edge of SnO2 crystal grains, which is somewhat similar to the growth of PbS on TiO2 electrodes as reported by a few groups previously.6,7 The lattice fringes corresponding to CdS overlayers on PbS QDs were not seen in cascaded 4PbS/4CdS electrodes, implying that the as-grown CdS is amorphous in nature.26 Similarly, scattered nanocrystallites surrounding the SnO2 nanoparticles in the alternate 4(PbS/CdS) deposited electrodes are observed while the lattice fringes show slightly smaller d-spacing compared to the cascaded electrodes (Fig. 1b). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was used to determine the compositions of the as-deposited semiconductor sensitizers. It shows that the atomic ratio S:(Pb + Cd) was ∼1.33 in the cascaded 4PbS/4CdS electrodes, indicating that on average it was sulfur rich and broadly consistent with previous reports by a cation exchange method,34 and a ratio of ∼0.96 was found for the alternate 4(PbS/CdS) electrodes, indicating as a whole that it was rather close to the stoichiometric composition.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of PbS/CdS-sensitized TiO2 and SnO2 electrodes before and after heat-treatment at 350 °C for 2 hours in an evacuated (∼10−6 mbar) quartz tube. To avoid the interference of the FTO substrate, TiO2 (Degussa, P25) and SnO2 electrodes made on microscopic glass slides were used so that the diffraction peaks of PbS can be differentiated clearly. Both the rutile (JCPDS No. 89-4920) and anatase (JCPDS No. 89-4921) phases are clearly seen in the bare TiO2 (Degussa, P25) electrode. After PbS/CdS deposition, the as-prepared cascaded electrodes show Bragg diffraction peaks at 30.15°, 42.85° and 51.50°, indicating the presence of crystallites of cubic PbS (Fig. 2(a)). However, the alternate layer deposited electrodes show a small shift (∼0.30°) towards higher 2θ compared with the former electrodes (Fig. S1(a–e), ESI†).35 Hodes et al. suggested that this small displacement of diffraction peaks might be caused by the strain effect due to nearly ambient deposition conditions.36 However, incorporation of Cd2+ (smaller ionic radii) into the crystalline PbS matrix by replacing the relatively bigger Pb2+ in the as-prepared samples might also cause the shift.35 Pentia et al. have reported the formation of solid solution (CdxPb1−xS) by the chemical bath deposition method where it can be formed either at low Cd2+ and high Pb2+ (Cd2+ in the PbS matrix) or high Cd2+ and low Pb2+ content (Pb2+ in the CdS matrix).37 In our study, a non-stoichiometric ratio of Cd/Pb = 0.23 was found from EDS elemental analysis, and the value of x in CdxPb1−xS was calculated to be 0.19, which is slightly greater than the threshold value of 0.15 at which the phase separation happens as reported by Hodes et al.36 While the as-prepared alternate layer sample exhibits only one set of broad peaks, the evolution of XRD patterns reveals that the material likely separates into a mixture of two solid solutions after annealing at 350 °C (Fig. 2).

In addition, although small nanocrystallites were observed on SnO2 from HRTEM measurement (Fig. 1), both cascaded and alternate PbS/CdS only reveal their very small diffraction peaks on SnO2 electrodes even after heat treatment. Considering that more PbS/CdS was actually deposited onto SnO2 as evidenced by the optical measurement shown in Fig. 3, it is inferred that the growth of crystalline PbS/CdS is suppressed on the surface of SnO2, plausibly as a result of unfavourable surface energy for the growth of crystal grains, which is well distinct from that of TiO2. These as-prepared electrodes were used directly for optical measurements, device fabrication and characterizations in the subsequent sections.

The inset photographs in (a, c) show the PbS-coated SnO2 and TiO2 electrodes, respectively, and those in (b, d) show the n(PbS/CdS)-coated SnO2 and TiO2 electrodes, respectively. The absorption spectra of substrates are shown by solid black line with circle marks in (a) and (c), and all other spectra represent the light absorption of the sensitizers as the substrate absorption was subtracted from the light absorption of the corresponding electrodes. 
Optical properties of the sensitized electrodes

Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the absorption spectra of 5.5 μm thick SnO2 electrodes coated with cascaded CdS/nPbS/4CdS and alternate n(PbS/CdS) (n = 1–5), respectively. With increasing SILAR deposition cycles of PbS, the spectra of both electrodes shift to longer wavelength gradually, with the absorption edge extending to 1600 nm within the measured wavelength range. While the peak absorbance between 400 and 600 nm is comparable for both cascaded and alternate layer deposited electrodes, the former presents much higher optical density (OD) at longer wavelength than the latter, indicating that the growth of PbS in the cascaded structure is favoured and accordingly the size should be larger. This is understandable considering that the growth of PbS could be easily disrupted by the subsequent deposition of CdS in each alternate layer. As a result, the crystallinity of alternate 4(PbS/CdS) would be deficient compared with the cascaded 4PbS/4CdS electrodes. Regardless of the SILAR deposition mode, no characteristic excitonic peak could be observed in all the OD spectra, suggesting a dispersed size distribution of the deposited semiconductor nanocrystallites.
For comparison, TiO2 electrodes were also sensitized with both cascaded nPbS/4CdS and alternate n(PbS/CdS). As revealed in the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d), the absorbance was found to be significantly lower than that of the SnO2 electrodes. In addition, for the same SILAR deposition cycles the PbS-sensitized TiO2 has a much blue shifted spectrum compared with that of SnO2. As shown in the photographs in the inset of Fig. 3(a), the colour of the sensitized SnO2 electrodes turns from yellow ochre in the 1st cycle to dark brown after 3 cycles of deposition of PbS. In contrast, the sensitized TiO2 electrodes have very pale colour indicating that a much less amount of PbS was actually deposited (Fig. 3(c)). Several recent studies have revealed that the growth of PbS on TiO2 by SILAR deposition is not favoured and only gives rise to very scattered hemispherical shaped quantum dots. To enhance the reaction kinetics of PbS on TiO2, surface treatment with chemicals such as NH4F and HF have been carried out to improve PbS deposition.14
In contrast, the inherently more favourable growth of PbS on SnO2 would be of great advantage for efficient light harvesting in the subsequent photovoltaic applications. The OD spectra of one CdS buffer layer plus nPbS layer (n = 1–5) (denoted as CdS/nPbS)-sensitized metal oxides are also shown in the ESI† (Fig. S2).
Photovoltaic characteristics
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of these sensitizers on SnO2 and TiO2 electrodes, sandwich type thin layer cells were fabricated with Cu2S on brass as the cathode and polysulfide electrolyte as the hole transporter. A thin ZnS passivation layer (2 cycles) was deposited onto the sensitized electrode by the same SILAR method to prevent charge recombination at the electrode and electrolyte interface.38,39 As shown in the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra in Fig. 4(a), both cascaded and alternate PbS/CdS-sensitized SnO2 electrodes exhibit a photocurrent response extending to the near infrared region, with a maximum IPCE of ∼50% at 390 nm and an average IPCE of ∼10% at 1100 nm irrespective of the electrodes structures. In comparison, the TiO2-based SSCs have a peak IPCE of ∼40% at 390 nm, which however drops steeply at longer wavelength with an IPCE of only ∼2% at 1100 nm. The less efficient quantum yield of TiO2-based SSCs as compared to that of SnO2 is likely a result of inefficient charge injection. Leventis et al. recently reported a comparative study of charge separation between PbS-sensitized mesoscopic TiO2 and SnO2. Transient optical measurements revealed much faster charge injection for the PbS-sensitized SnO2 electrode, where the quantum yield was close to unity when Li+ was added into the electrolyte.25 Pijpers et al. have also shown efficient electron injection from PbSe QDs into SnO2, however there was no injection into TiO2 because of unfavourable energy band alignments.40 The lower CBM of SnO2 is believed to greatly facilitate the injection of electrons from the relatively lower lying LUMO of sensitizers, which becomes more apparent at longer wavelength as the distinct wavelength dependence of IPCE between these two metal oxides indicated in Fig. 4(a).41 In addition, the cascaded 3PbS/4CdS always presents higher IPCE than that of the alternate 4(PbS/CdS) on the same metal oxide electrode, implying superior charge separation of the former configuration. The TiCl4 post-treatment of SnO2 was found to be critical to drastically increase the performance of the cells. A similar phenomenon was observed for SnO2/CdSe cells in our previous study.42 Snaith and Ducati have shown in a recent study that islands or terraces consisting of 1–2 nm sized TiO2 nanocrystallites are formed on TiCl4 treated SnO2 upon heating at 500 °C, which were found to be beneficial for passivating the surface states and the overall performance of bulk heterojunction dye-sensitized solar cells.43 It is believed that the effect of TiCl4 treatment is similar for semiconductor-sensitized SnO2 solar cells while unambiguous understanding requires systematic studies.
 Fig. 4  (a) IPCE spectra and (b) J–V characteristics of cells utilizing cascaded and alternate PbS/CdS-sensitized SnO2 and TiO2 electrodes. Cu2S on brass and polysulfide electrolyte were used as the counter electrode and hole scavenger, respectively. The light intensity of J–V measurement was simulated AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. 
While in a previous study the CdS buffer layer was found to be redundant in CdSe-sensitized solar cells, it was observed here that a thin CdS buffer layer underneath the cascaded sensitizer is always beneficial to the photovoltaic performance of both SnO2 and TiO2-based SSCs. As shown in Fig. 4(b), both photocurrent and open circuit voltage were noticeably increased when one layer of CdS was coated prior to PbS deposition in cascaded 3PbS/4CdS electrodes. Considering that the SILAR method produces cluster-like PbS quantum dots on SnO2 or TiO2, it is believed that deposition of a thin layer CdS would passivate the surface states and block the direct contact of the exposed metal oxide surface with the surrounding electrolyte. As a result, charge recombination between injected electrons in metal oxide and acceptor species in the electrolyte would be greatly suppressed. This is supported by the recent study of Guijarro et al., who found that coating TiO2 with an analogue material of CdS/CdSe greatly increased the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2–electrolyte interface.39 In addition, while PbS is widely studied as a panchromatic sensitizer for efficient light harvesting, it is also a good electrocatalyst toward the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte,33 and has been employed as a counter electrode in aqueous polysulfide electrolyte.44 This however raises the concern that the presence of PbS as sensitizer may catalyze the recombination reaction at the photoelectrode–electrolyte interface. As reported by Lee et al., a ZnS passivation layer is required to hinder the backward electron flow from PbS to the oxidized species in polysulfide electrolyte.16 A similar phenomenon was observed here. As shown in Fig. 4(a), although 4 layers of CdS were coated on top of PbS, peak IPCE of the cascaded CdS/3PbS/4CdS sensitized-SnO2 still drops by almost 50% in the absence of the ZnS passivation layer on the outermost surface. As a consequence, both photocurrent and photovoltage become deteriorated compared with the same electrode treated with two layers of ZnS. In addition, it is interesting to note that the enhancement of IPCE for the ZnS-treated samples is mainly contributed by short wavelength photons (400–800 nm), while only marginal increment was observed at long wavelength. As ZnS has negligible light absorption in this wavelength range, the distinct wavelength-dependent enhancement of IPCE could be rationalized by the improved separation of charge carriers generated in the 4CdS layer, which only absorbs short wavelength photons. The presence of the ZnS passivation layer on top of CdS greatly suppresses the recombination of electrons residing on CdS with acceptor species in the electrolyte.37 It is anticipated that the cascaded structure of the PbS sensitizer with an underlying CdS buffer layer and overlying CdS overlayers (as a buffer layer for the subsequent ZnS deposition), along with the ZnS passivation layer, would greatly eliminate interfacial charge recombination and improve the photovoltaic performance of PbS-sensitized SnO2 SSCs.
The effect of film thickness on the cell performance was investigated by varying the thickness of mesoscopic SnO2 films and eventually an optimum thickness for SnO2 electrodes was found to be ∼10 μm. For TiO2-based SSCs, 10 μm thick electrodes were also used for comparison. Table 1 summarizes the data of both SnO2 and TiO2-based SSCs. As expected the SnO2 electrodes exhibit much higher short-circuit photocurrents as compared to TiO2 electrodes irrespective of the sensitizer configurations, whereas the Voc of SnO2-based SSCs is only slightly lower than that of the TiO2-based SSCs despite the far more positive CBM of SnO2 (ca. 300–400 mV). The reason for the discrepant photovoltage could be twofold: firstly, charge recombination in SnO2-based SSCs is plausibly slower than that in TiO2 cells, which has been proved in CdS/CdSe-sensitized cells by careful impedance measurement. As a result, the Voc of CdS/CdSe-sensitized SnO2 cells is only ca. 26–56 mV lower compared with TiO2 cells,26 which is similar to the present study. In addition, the photocurrent of SnO2-based SSCs is almost two times as high as that of TiO2 cells. Hence higher electron concentration in SnO2 is expected, which may cause an upward shift of the electron quasi-Fermi level (closer to CBM) with respect to the redox potential of polysulfide electrolyte, further offsetting the Voc difference. The best device was obtained with cascaded CdS/3PbS/4CdS-sensitized SnO2 electrodes, yielding jsc = 17.38 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.318 V, fill factor = 40.21% and η = 2.23% under simulated AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which represents one of the highest power conversion efficiencies achieved so far for PbS-sensitized liquid junction solar cells. In comparison, the alternate 4(PbS/CdS)-sensitized SnO2 cells exhibit relatively low photocurrent and photovoltage and consequently much lower power conversion efficiency.

The photovoltaic performance of cells made of TiO2 electrodes suffered from low photocurrent due to less efficient charge injection as a result of the relatively high CBM of TiO2. The best device was obtained with cascaded CdS/3PbS/4CdS as a sensitizer, yielding jsc = 9.72 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.349 V, fill factor = 48.43% and η = 1.64%. Interestingly, the alternate n(PbS/CdS) was prone to peel off from TiO2 electrodes and only a maximum of 3 SILAR cycles could be reproducibly obtained on TiO2, which resulted in an even lower power conversion efficiency as listed in Table 1. We noted that the performance of these TiO2 cells is notably lower than those reported by Braga et al., which could collectively be a result of different electrode structure and device fabrication procedure used in these two studies. For instance, no scattering and blocking layers were employed in the TiO2 electrodes in the present study, in order for fair comparison with the SnO2 electrodes. In addition, we have attempted to explore the effects of the two different sensitizer configurations and their correlations with the device performance by impedance spectroscopy. Considering that Cu2S coated brass is not a stable counter electrode in polysulfide electrolyte,33,45 platinized FTO was used as a counter electrode. However, unlike the CdSe-sensitized devices, the platinized counter electrode in PbS-sensitized cells suffers from extremely large interfacial charge transfer resistance for unknown reasons, which makes the impedance spectroscopic study very difficult. We are currently investigating the cause and are screening various alternative counter electrodes for both enhanced stability and catalytic capability.
Conclusions
In this study, mesoscopic SnO2 electrodes were examined thoroughly as photoanodes for PbS-sensitized liquid junction solar cells. The lower CBM of SnO2 was found to greatly promote charge injection from PbS, which is especially pronounced for the harnessing of low energy photons. In addition, compared with TiO2 the surface of SnO2 has much higher affinity to the growth of PbS, leading to much enhanced light harvesting. Rigorous interfacial engineering indicates that a CdS buffer layer sandwiched between SnO2 and PbS, and a ZnS passivation layer on the outermost surface of the electrode are beneficial for preventing the charge recombination and improving the photovoltaic performance of the cells. In an optimized cascaded structure, the short circuit photocurrent density up to 17.38 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency of 2.23% were attained with PbS-sensitized SnO2 solar cells under simulated AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which is much superior to that of TiO2 tested under similar conditions and represents one of the highest efficiencies reported for PbS-sensitized liquid junction solar cells. While encouraging, the quantum efficiency of PbS-sensitized SnO2 solar cells is still much lower than unity compared with the CdSe-sensitized counterparts. The maximum internal quantum efficiency is determined to be only ∼70% by considering the optical loss of the cell. Insightful understanding of the loss mechanism would be of great importance for further improving the device performance and ultimately achieving charge carrier multiplication in sensitized mesoscopic solar cells considering the superb properties of SnO2 observed herein.
