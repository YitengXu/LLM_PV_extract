    , Accepted 8th May 2020First published on 11th May 2020AbstractGene delivery based on bioactive coatings on collagen has great potential for applications in bone repair. Meanwhile, controlled gene delivery at specific times/regions is essential for an efficient and complete bone reconstruction process. However, spatio-temporal regulation of gene release and delivery remains a great challenge. In this paper, we used visible light illumination to effectively regulate gene release and subsequent delivery into biological cells. A visible light responsive and bioactive nanocomposite coating (based on collagen/gold nanoparticles, e.g., Col/AuNPs) was prepared through hydrothermal and sol–gel processes and was used as a loading platform for complexes of enhanced green fluorescent protein and Lipofectamine2000 (LF/GFP). The results showed that the amount of immobilized LF/GFP was increased on Col/AuNPs and the release of pre-adsorbed LF/GFP was significantly enhanced in a spatio-temporal and controlled manner under visible light illumination. Moreover, the cellular intake of the released genes was improved, thus enhancing the gene expression efficiency of the cells. The mechanism of enhanced controlled gene delivery was attributed to the changes in collagen structures and rearrangement of cytoskeletal structures induced by the photothermal effect. The developed Col/AuNP composite coating is effective for both controlled surface-mediated gene delivery and gene-mediated bone repair.
Introduction
Bioactive coatings play an important role in tissue repair and regenerative medicine, especially in the repair and reconstruction of bone defects.1–4 Various bioactive materials, such as bioceramics, synthetic or natural polymers and their composites, have been investigated as bioactive osteoconductive coatings.5–8 Recently, growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were further loaded on these bioactive coatings, so that osteogenic differentiation of stem cells, which is found to be essential for bone regeneration, could be improved.9–11 However, high doses of growth factors were generally needed due to their poor affinity towards coatings and short half-time in the body, which may lead to complications such as ectopic bone formation and inflammation.12 Expression of endogenous growth factors through gene transcription is regarded as one of the appropriate approaches to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Nevertheless, before transcription, genes must be delivered to the targeted cells effectively. Hence, reliable routes to deliver the genes locally to the targeted tissues such as surface-mediated gene delivery and reverse gene delivery which immobilize the genes onto the surface before cell seeding13,14 have become a reasonable strategy for designing bone restoration biomaterials.15
However, efficient gene delivery at specific times/regions is still very challenging, and critical to clinical bone repair.16 Generally, such delivery methods include effective immobilization and release of genes and intake of genes by the targeted cells.17–19 Numerous studies have been carried out on immobilization and release of genes. For example, various methods such as electrostatic interaction,20 hydrogen bonding21 and covalent bonding22 have been utilized to control the immobilization of genes. However, many of these control methods have difficulty in timely release of genes.23 Various external driving forces, including those generated by changes of pH, temperature, electrical current/voltage and light intensity, have been explored to promote fast gene release.24–29 For efficient cellular uptake of genes, most studies are focused on the optimization of various viral or non-viral vectors, so that a balance between high delivery efficiency and safety could be reached. Alternatively, physical enhancement methods, such as electroporation, sonoporation and photoporation, have been widely investigated to promote cellular uptake of genes, through enhancing cell membrane permeability.29–34 Recently, Wang et al. and Zhang et al. found that the efficiency of surface-mediated gene delivery was enhanced due to the photothermal effect generated from polydopamine,35,36 proving that photothermal stimulation could influence gene delivery. Nonetheless, the degree of dopamine polymerization needs to be strictly controlled, otherwise it will cause biosafety issues.
In this work, we proposed a new idea to use bioactive coatings combined with visible light illumination, in order to effectively deliver genes. Collagen (Col) was chosen as both the matrix of the coating owing to its effectiveness as a bioactive ingredient and the loading platform for osteogenic gene delivery in bone repair materials.37–40 Biocompatible and photo-responsive gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)41–43 were incorporated into collagen, in order to provide the coating with the ability to respond to visible light. Moreover, a quartz glass with an array of TiO2 nanorods (TiNR) was utilized as the substrate to prevent the coating from unwanted peeling-off. The photothermal properties of the composite coating and the conformation changes of collagen were characterized. The behaviors of gene release and gene delivery under visible light illumination were evaluated. Finally, the mechanism of visible light-regulated gene delivery using the composite coatings of collagen/gold nanoparticles (Col/AuNPs) was proposed.
Results and discussion
Characterization of Col/AuNPs and visible light illumination for composite coatings
The transmission electron microscope (TEM) image shows nearly spherical particles of the prepared AuNPs with a diameter of about 20 nm (Fig. S1a, ESI†). The size of AuNPs measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) is 23.9 ± 0.4 nm in diameter, which is larger than that measured by TEM analysis owing to the solvation and hydration of particles.44 The zeta potential is 41.1 ± 2.4 mV, which indicates that the AuNPs are stable and resistant to agglomeration (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The size and zeta potential distribution of synthetic AuNPs are relatively uniform (Fig. S1d and e, ESI†). An obvious absorption peak of AuNPs is observed at 523 nm in the UV-Vis spectra of AuNP solution, and the absorption peak of AuNPs still exists but shows a minor red shift to 525 nm after collagen gel inclusion (Fig. S1c, ESI†). A similar phenomenon has been observed in previous research.45Fig. 1a shows a typical morphology of the Col/AuNP composite coating observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The coating is quite dense, and elemental distributions of C and Au characterized using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) confirmed that AuNPs are homogeneously distributed inside the coating (Fig. 1b and c). The widths of most TiNRs are about 100 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). A cross-sectional observation of the Col/AuNP coating shows that the lengths of TiNRs are about 480–520 nm, and TiNRs are evenly distributed inside the Col/AuNP matrix (Fig. 1d). Such a structure is believed to be beneficial for improving coating adhesion through an effective mechanical interlocking mechanism.

(h) C 1s and (i) N 1s XPS spectra of Col/AuNPs: (h1) and (i1) without light; (h2) and (i2) with light. Scale bar: 800 nm. 
Different concentrations of AuNPs were mixed uniformly in the collagen solution (e.g., 0 mg mL−1, 0.17 mg mL−1, 0.33 mg mL−1, and 0.50 mg mL−1 of AuNPs), and the corresponding coatings are named TiNR/Col, Col/AuNPs-L, Col/AuNPs-M, and Col/AuNPs-H, respectively. The photothermal behaviors of the coatings were characterized and the results are shown in Fig. 1e. The temperature of TiNR/Col is increased slightly (1.3 °C) after 15 min of light illumination, and the temperature increment (ΔT) of Col/AuNPs is increased with the content of AuNPs (3.1 °C for Col/AuNPs-L, 3.5 °C for Col/AuNPs-M and 4.1 °C for Col/AuNPs-H, respectively). The value of ΔT is also increased with increasing light intensity, as shown in Fig. 1f. Furthermore, the value of ΔT is increased rapidly with the increase in illumination time in the first three minutes, but the increase in this rate is significantly decreased with further illumination. These results indicate that Col/AuNPs possess good photothermal properties and their photothermal conversion ability could be regulated by the content of AuNPs, light intensity and illumination time.
The thermal effect during illumination could cause denaturation or even degradation of collagen,45 which would play an important role in regulating the desorption of LF/GFP. Therefore, the secondary structures of collagen were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), in order to understand the effects of light illumination on collagen conformation. The fitted FTIR peaks (see Fig. 1g and Table 1) show that the secondary structures of collagen underwent significant changes after light illumination. The content of the triple helix structure is reduced from 21.6% to 16.1%, while the content of the side chain structure is increased from 0.0 to 10.1%. The ordered structures of both α-helix (from 28.3% to 18.7%) and β-sheet (from 24.3% to 22.0%) decreased, whereas both the unordered structures of β-turn (from 16.7% to 18.7%) and unordered conformation (from 9.1% to 14.4%) increased. The results indicate that the thermal energy generated by visible light illumination influences the conformation of collagen, manifested by the depolymerization of the triple helix structure, exposure of side chains and formation of more disordered molecular chains.

The surface of the Col/AuNP composite coating is in direct contact with LF/GFP and cells, therefore the changes of the surface are crucial for gene release and cellular behaviors. In order to verify whether there is light-induced collagen conformation occurring on the surface, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the sample of Col/AuNPs. Fig. 1h and i show the C 1s and N 1s spectra of C-containing and N-containing groups, which can be used to identify the existence of collagens. The deconvolution results of C 1s and N 1s spectra indicate detailed information about collagen and is listed in Tables 2 and 3. Clearly, an evaluation of the deconvoluted C 1s components reveals an increase in the amount of OC–NH (21.5% to 27.9%), a reduction in C–O/C–S (13.2% to 7.6%) and C–H (27.5% to 21.3%), and a slight increase in C–N (21.3% to 23.6%) and C–C (16.5% to 19.6%) for the Col/AuNP coating with illumination in comparison to those without illumination. Also, the fitted N 1s shows an increase in OC–NH (8.5 to 14.0%) and C–N (34.6% to 36.7%), and a decrease in NH2 (39.9% to 38.0%) and –N (17.0% to 11.3%). Such results imply that the N- and C-containing groups of collagens on the surface were changed after light illumination. Combined with the results of FTIR, it could be speculated that the changes in collagen conformations probably contributed to such changes on the surface.

The above results confirm that the Col/AuNP composite coating shows an obvious photothermal effect under visible light illumination. The thermal energy would change the conformation of collagen, which could influence the molecules immobilized on collagen and cellular responses.
Cell responses to the Col/AuNP composite coating
Good cytocompatibility is one of the basic requirements for biomedical materials. Therefore, we have characterized the adhesion and proliferation behaviors of the cells grown on Col/AuNPs. After being cultured for 1 day, the cells grown on the TiNR coating showed a slightly circular morphology and poor cytoplasm extension. In contrast, the cells grown on the Col/AuNP coating exhibited a spindle morphology and a significant cytoplasm extension (Fig. S3a, ESI†). Although the optical density (OD) values of the cells on Col/AuNPs were comparable to those on the TiNR coating after cultivation for 1 day and 3 days (Fig. 2a), a better adhesion behavior in the early stage for the cell growth revealed that Col/AuNPs showed good cell viability properties over TiNR. In addition, no adverse effects were observed on number and spreading morphology of the cells grown on Col/AuNP composite coatings with different contents of AuNPs and with visible light illumination (Fig. 2a and Fig. S3b–c, ESI†).

The maintenance of biological function during light illumination is critical for bioactive coatings. It was previously reported that the TiNR coating shows good osteoconductive performance.46 We have characterized the osteogenic differentiation behaviors of the Col/AuNP composite coating with/without light illumination. As a marker in the early differentiation stage, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities of the cells on different samples were characterized and the results are shown in Fig. 2b and c. All the three samples showed equivalent ALP activities at day 7 and day 14, indicating that the cells on the Col/AuNP coating had good osteogenic differentiation potential with or without light illumination.
To further probe the osteogenic differentiation of cells on the coatings, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were carried out to analyze the osteogenic-related gene markers at the molecular level. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 2d. For the expressions of ALP, Col-I and Runx-2, all samples showed equivalent levels, whereas the expression level of osteocalcin (OCN) at day 7 on Col/AuNPs with light illumination was increased to 1.4-fold more than that on TiNR. Such results implied that the composite coating and visible light illumination have a slightly positive effect on osteogenic differentiation compared to TiNR.
These results clearly indicate that the Col/AuNP composite coating under visible light illumination showed similar cell viability and slightly improved osteogenic differentiation to MC3T3-E1 cells.
Immobilization and release of LF/GFP under visible light illumination

Fig. 3a shows the results of the Lipofectamine2000/pEGFP complex (LF/GFP) immobilization on TiNR and Col/AuNPs, which is an important factor in regulating surface-mediated gene delivery. The obtained quantitative data indicate that the Col/AuNP coatings effectively immobilize more LF/GFP than the bare TiNR coating, which is in good agreement with the fluorescence results shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†). The released amount of LF/GFP was further evaluated using the fluorescence quantitative analysis method after immersion in PBS for a specified time. It was observed that 80% and 18% of LF/GFP were released from the TiNR and Col/AuNP coatings after 48 h of immersion (Fig. 3b). These results clearly indicate that the presence of Col/AuNPs on the top of TiNR effectively inhibited the initial burst release of LF/GFP.

Amount of pEGFP released from Col/AuNPs with different (c) light intensities (illumination time: 15 min), (d) illumination times (light intensity: 150 mW cm−2) and (e) with light treatment at different time points. (f) Amount of pEGFP released from Col/AuNPs with periodic light on and light off (20 min for a cycle). 
The intensity of the visible light illumination was found to effectively affect the release of LF/GFP. As shown in Fig. 3c, a significant increase in LF/GFP release was observed when the light intensity was increased to 150 mW cm−2. Nevertheless, further increase in light intensity resulted in a slight decrease in release. Such a decrease could be attributed to the degradation of collagens and their dispersion into the supernatant, which intervened the detection of LF/GFP (Fig. S4b, ESI†). It was also found that the amount of released LF/GFP was increased with increasing illumination time (Fig. 3d). Clearly, light illumination is an effective route to control the release of LF/GFP.
Generally, in surface-mediated gene delivery, genes need to be released at the appropriate time after the cells are attached on the surface, and thus it is crucial to control gene release in an on-demand and switchable manner. Fig. 3e and f show the amount of LF/GFP released from the Col/AuNP coating after illumination at different times and with a periodic light illumination. These results revealed that, within the initial 48 h, the release of LF/GFP was notably enhanced at any time point with light illumination, in comparison with those without light illumination (Fig. 3e). Fluorescence images of Col/AuNPs after LF/GFP release were further taken and are shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†), which show similar results. A large amount of LF/GFP remains attached to the surface of Col/AuNPs, even after the release for 48 h without light illumination. However, only a small amount of LF/GFP was detected on the surface, when the Col/AuNP coating was illuminated immediately after being transferred to fresh PBS. It is inevitable that few LF/GFP were detected on the composite coating when the Col/AuNP coating was illuminated after being soaked in fresh PBS for 24 h/48 h. When the light cycle was set as 10 min (e.g., light-on for 5 min and light-off for 5 min), the release of LF/GFP was slightly enhanced during the light-on stage than during the light-off stage (Fig. S5b, ESI†). When the light cycle was set as 20 min (e.g., light-on for 10 min and light-off for 10 min), the amount of the released LF/GFP was significantly increased during the light-on stage, compared with that during the light-off stage (Fig. 3f). All the above results implied that the release of LF/GFP could be regulated in a switchable manner.
A light mask (Fig. S6a, ESI†) was further deposited on the TiNR/Col and Col/AuNP coatings to study the spatial controllability of light-regulated release of LF/GFP. There are no obvious differences between the light exposed area and unexposed area for TiNR/Col, whereas for Col/AuNPs, the amount of residual LF/GFP in the light exposed area was much less than that in the unexposed area (Fig. S6b and c, ESI†). The results clearly indicated that the release of LF/GFP on the Col/AuNP coating could be controlled in a spatially controlled manner.
In brief, the introduction of collagen and AuNPs into TiNR increases the amount of immobilized LF/GFP and hinders its release. Furthermore, the release of LF/GFP could be regulated in a space-time controlled manner with visible light illumination.
Effects of visible light illumination on the cellular endocytosis of LF/GFP
It was previously reported that the surface properties of biomaterials, including composition,47 stiffness,48 topography49 and so on, could affect cytoskeletal rearrangement, thereby influencing their cellular endocytosis.50 In order to investigate whether the photothermal properties of the composite coating could lead to cytoskeletal rearrangement, we used a laser confocal microscope for this study. The obtained images clearly show that the cells grown on Col/AuNPs showed a more elongated morphology and brighter fluorescence colour under light illumination compared with those without light illumination. Moreover, actin filaments of the cells are arranged in parallel (Fig. 4a). Such rearrangement of the cytoskeleton is probably caused by the change in collagen conformation and direct photothermal heating. All the above phenomena indicated that more polymerized actin filaments were formed and the cells showed a stronger ability for cellular endocytosis to LF/GFP with light illumination.

(b) GFP expression efficiency and mean fluorescence intensity of the cells cultured on Col/AuNPs. (c) GFP expression of the cells cultured on Col/AuNPs characterized by fluorescence microscopy. Scale bar: 100 μm. 
In a conventional gene delivery process, gene load carriers are directly added to the cell culture medium. Unlike surface-mediated gene delivery, it does not involve the release of gene load carriers, while cells directly endocytose the carriers from the surrounding medium. In order to study the effect of light illumination on the cellular uptake of LF/GFP without the interference of the release of LF/GFP, a conventional gene delivery experiment was performed. The results obtained from flow cytometry shown in Fig. 4b indicate that both the expression efficiency of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and mean fluorescence intensity with visible light illumination are increased by 1.2-fold, when compared with those without visible light illumination. Fluorescence microscopy images in Fig. 4c show similar results, highlighting the positive effect of light illumination on the cellular endocytosis of LF/GFP.
Clearly, the photothermal effect of the Col/AuNP coating under visible light illumination affected the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, then enhanced the cellular endocytosis of LF/GFP.
Effects of visible light illumination on gene delivery efficiency
As shown in Fig. 5a, the measured amounts of GFP expressions for the cells cultured on Col/AuNPs are obviously increased owing to the effective immobilization of LF/GFP. Moreover, applying visible light illumination further improved the amount of the expression of cells. Data measured from flow cytometry further accurately proved that the GFP expression efficiency of the cells on Col/AuNPs was 2.1-fold as much as that on TiNR. This value was further increased to 2.6-fold after using visible light illumination (Fig. 5b and c). Clearly, the rapid release of LF/GFP with visible light illumination has contributed to the enhanced GFP expression. However, the cytomembrane is still an inevitable barrier during biomolecule transport, and the enhanced cellular uptake of LF/GFP is another critical factor for enhancing the gene expression efficiency.

(a) GFP expression of the cells grown on TiNR and Col/AuNPs characterized using a fluorescence microscope, flow cytometry analysis for (b) transfection efficiency in percentage of total cell population and (c) mean fluorescence intensity of the transfected cells cultured on TiNR and Col/AuNPs. Scale bar: 50 μm. 
It is worth noting that the above obtained gene expression efficiency is lower than that obtained using the conventional method (Fig. 4b). This can be attributed to the fact that the amount of pEGFP released in surface-mediated gene delivery (about 90 ng per well) was less than that used in the conventional method (200 ng per well). Moreover, the results obtained from the periodic light illumination experiments showed that the gene delivery efficiency in surface-mediated gene delivery was further enhanced through optimizing light illumination conditions. Such in situ surface-mediated gene delivery is more efficient than conventional gene delivery.
The above results demonstrated that visible light illumination enhances surface-mediated gene delivery, and its mechanism is proposed and shown in Fig. 6. On one hand, the structure of collagen becomes more disordered under visible light illumination due to the photothermal effect in the composite coating. The disturbance of these collagen structures weakens the interaction between LF/GFP and the coating surface, thus resulting in a rapid release of LF/GFP. On the other hand, the changes in collagen conformation and photothermal heating induced by the photothermal effect of Col/AuNPs under light illumination trigger the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, which enhances the cellular intake of the released LF/GFP. Eventually, the two processes synergistically regulated surface-mediated gene delivery.
 Fig. 6  Schematic illustration of the effect of visible light illumination on Col/AuNP-mediated gene delivery. 
Surface-mediated in vivo gene delivery is quite challenging due to the inherent barriers in LF/GFP transport. In comparison with a single cell, cell sheets with a high cell density are abundant for interactions between cell and cell as well as cell and extracellular matrix, which are more applicable in mimicking in vivo gene delivery processes. To further assess the potential application of such light-regulated in vivo surface-mediated gene delivery, an experiment of gene delivery to cell sheets was further carried out. The cell sheets were obtained from silicon wafers with a p–n homojunction as reported in the literature51 and the image of the detached cell sheet is shown in Fig. 7a. After re-culturing on Col/AuNP composite coatings for 2 days, few dead cells were observed on these cell sheets (Fig. 7b). The GFP expression efficiency was relatively low in cell sheets, which might be ascribed to the barrier effects of the extracellular matrix and different cell status.52 Nevertheless, light illumination significantly improved the GFP expression efficiency (Fig. 7c). Such results clearly suggest that visible light illumination enhances gene delivery efficiency in cell sheets and exhibits excellent potential for in vivo applications.

Conclusions
In this study, an osteoconductive bioactive coating was prepared by incorporating Col/AuNPs into TiNR and was used as a platform for LF/GFP loading. Visible light illumination was used to regulate rapid surface-mediated gene delivery. Photo-thermal effects were observed through a simple illumination of a non-laser and cold light source. The collagen structure became more disordered due to the photothermal effect, and the disturbance of collagen structure induced a rapid release of LF/GFP under light illumination. Furthermore, the changes in collagen conformation and photothermal heating generated by light illumination could regulate cytoskeletal rearrangement, thus resulting in an enhanced cellular uptake ability. The cells grown on Col/AuNPs showed a significantly higher GFP expression efficiency with light illumination. This enhancing mechanism was attributed to the accelerated release of LF/GFP and enhanced cellular uptake ability, as well as synergistically controlled surface-mediated gene delivery. This work has created a new design methodology for a controlled surface-mediated gene delivery based on the osteoconductive bioactive coating. More importantly, it offers a new strategy for controlled gene-mediated bone repair by regulating the delivery of functional molecules into specific cells.
Experimental section
Preparation and characterization of Col/AuNP coatings
TiNR on the surface of the substrate was prepared according to that reported in the previous publication.53,54 Briefly, seed layers of TiO2 nanodots were firstly prepared through a sol–gel method. A hydrothermal method was then used to prepare nanorods in a solution containing deionized water, concentrated hydrochloric acid and tetrabutyl titanate. Surfaces with such nanorod arrays were reported to have good biocompatibility.55 A mixed solution was obtained by dissolving type I collagen (obtained from Beijing Yierkang, China) into AuNP solution with acetic acid under mild stirring. The final concentration of the mixed solution was set to be 0.2 wt% of collagen and 0.50 mg mL−1 of AuNPs. Col/AuNP coatings were prepared through a spin-coating method, e.g., 30 μL of the mixed solution was firstly dripped onto the surface with TiNR, and then spun at 7000 rpm for 40 s. Surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the coatings were observed using an SEM (Hitachi, SU47) with an operating voltage of 3.0 kV. Elemental distribution of the coatings was measured using the EDS attached with the SEM. The biological activity of the composite coating was evaluated using different methods such as cellular adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Detailed experimental processes are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†).
Visible light illumination to the Col/AuNP composite coating
A halogen cold light source (Mingri Technique, XD-302, 400–800 nm) was used in this study. The light intensity was determined using a solar power meter (Xinbao Technique, SM306). During all the visible light treatment processes, cold visible light is illuminated onto the samples from above, and the schematic diagram of the lighting device is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). To study the photothermal performance of composite coatings, the samples were exposed to visible light at a certain intensity and time, and temperatures were recorded using an infrared thermal camera (FLIR, E40). When analysing the effect of AuNP content on ΔT, the light intensity was set to be 150 mW cm−2. Col/AuNPs-L was used as a typical sample to study the effect of light intensity on ΔT. The samples were characterized using FTIR (PerkinElmer, Spectrum 2000) and XPS (Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD) after light illumination at an intensity of 150 mW cm−2 for 15 min. Amplified FTIR spectra between 1600 cm−1 and 1700 cm−1 (amine I absorption) were used to study the changes in collagen conformation after curve fitting with the PeakFit software.56 The detailed XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s were fitted using XPS Peak 4.1 software to analyse the changes in surface chemical status of coating, after the system was calibrated with C 1s (284.6 eV).
Immobilization and release of LF/GFP
pEGFP (GenScript), a plasmid encoding GFP, was used as a reporter gene and lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, Lipofectamine® 2000 Reagent) was used as a gene vector in this study. LF/GFP were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, lipofectamine2000 and pEGFP were incubated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 8.0, HyClone) at concentrations of 12 μL mL−1 and 4 μg mL−1, separately, for 10 minutes, then the pEGFP solution was added dropwise to the lipofectamine2000 solution and incubated for another 5 minutes at room temperature. For the immobilization of LF/GFP, the samples were placed in 24 well plates and soaked in 500 μL per well of LF/GFP solution at 4 °C for 12 h immediately after LF/GFP formation. The final amount of pEGFP was 1 μg per well, and the ratio of pEGFP to lipofectamine2000 was 1 μg per 3 μL within the usage range recommended by the manufacturer. The samples were gently washed twice with PBS to remove unbound LF/GFP. The amount of pEGFP (which is used to represent the relative amount of LF/GFP) on the substrate was determined after staining with Helixyte Green (ATT Bioquest) and then analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Nexcope, NIB900). The amount of pEGFP in the supernatant was also quantified using a fluorescence microplate reader (MDS Analytical, M200) after labeling with Helixyte Green.
In order to study the spontaneous release of LF/GFP, the samples with LF/GFP loading were soaked in fresh PBS at 37 °C in a humid chamber and a small amount of the solution was taken out at a specific time point (e.g., 0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h) to determine the amount of the released LF/GFP. For visible light-controlled release of LF/GFP, the samples with LF/GFP loading were immersed in PBS at 37 °C in a humid chamber, and then exposed to visible light under predetermined conditions. After visible light illumination, the supernatants were collected and the amount of the released LF/GFP was quantified using the fluorescence microplate reader as mentioned above. The remaining amount of LF/GFP on the substrates was analyzed using the fluorescence microscope as described above. In the periodic light on–off experiment, the supernatant was preserved and fresh PBS was added at the end of each light-on or light-off stage. The collected supernatants were used to determine the amount of the released LF/GFP during this period.
Cell culture and seeding
MC3T3-E1 cells (CRL-2594, ATCC) were used as model cells in this research. The cells were cultured in alpha-modified minimum essential media (α-MEM, GENOM, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Cellmax, Australia) under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Sub-confluent cells cultivated on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) were trypsinized using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Gibco) and suspended in fresh cell culture medium. Before cell seeding, TiNR and Col/AuNPs were sterilized using an autoclave sterilizer (ZEALWAY, G154T) at 120 °C for 30 min and then transferred into a 24-well plate. MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded on the samples with a density of 1 × 105 cells per mL (500 μL) in cytocompatibility tests and 2 × 105 cells per mL in gene delivery experiments.
Cytocompatibility tests of the composite coating

Cell adhesion and proliferation measurement. 
The adhesion behaviors of MC3T3-E1 cells on both TiNR and Col/AuNPs were evaluated after incubation for 1 day. The spreading morphology of the cells was captured using an optical microscope and the number of adherent cells was counted using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). Proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells grown on different samples was quantified after culturing for three days. For light illumination groups, the cells were exposed to visible light at an intensity of 150 mW cm−2 for 15 min after they were seeded on various composite coatings for 2 h. The OD values and morphology of the cells grown on the composite coatings were characterized after 48 h of incubation.


ALP activity assay. 
After 7-day and 14-day cultivation, different treated samples were transferred to new wells and washed three times with PBS. Then the biological cells were lysed using a cell lysis buffer (Sigma). ALP activity was quantified and normalized to total protein contents using a LabAssay ALP (Wako, Japan) and a protein kit (BCA, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The ALP product of the cells grown on different samples was stained using an ALP color development kit (Beyotime).


Quantitative real-time PCR assay. 
The expressions of the target gene were measured using a real-time RT-PCR assay. The total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent and 500 ng of RNA was used to reverse-transcribe the cDNA. RT-PCR analysis was conducted on a Roche LightCycler480 system using SYBR Green as DNA dye. β-Actin was used as the reference gene to normalize the relative expression of the target genes. The primers used in this study are listed in Table 4.

Gene delivery
To study the influence of visible light illumination on the cellular uptake of LF/GFP while excluding the interference of LF/GFP release, a conventional gene delivery experiment was firstly performed. Briefly, MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded on Col/AuNPs and incubated for 12 h to make the cells fully attached to the surface. After this, LF/GFP were added into the culture medium with a pEGFP concentration of 0.2 μg per well. Then the cells were exposed to visible light. Finally, GFP expression was assessed after cell culturing for another 48 h. For surface-mediated gene delivery experiments, MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded on the samples after LF/GFP immobilization. After being cultivated for 2 h, the cells were exposed to visible light for 15 min at an intensity of 150 mW cm−2. GFP expression efficiency and mean intensity of fluorescence were measured using a flow cytometer (Beckman CytoFLEX) and a fluorescence microscope after culturing for another 48 h.
Cell morphology observations
In order to study the effect of visible light illumination on cell cytoskeleton, F-actins were stained with fluorescent rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Briefly, after culturing for 12 h, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with visible light, and then immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min. After this, the cells were permeated with 0.4% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min. F-Actins were dyed with 50 μg mL−1 of phalloidin solution for 30 min and nuclei were stained with 5 μg mL−1 of 4′-6-diamidino-2′-phenylindole (DAPI) for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were recorded using a laser confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM780).
Statistical analysis
All the tests were carried out in triplicate, and the obtained data were presented with mean value ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed through one-way variance analysis and Scheffe's post hoc test. Student's t-test was carried out using a Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) software. When p value was less than 0.05, the differences were considered statistically significant (***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, and *p < 0.05).
