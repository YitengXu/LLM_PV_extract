Beyond the simple enhancement of conductivity, high charge carrier accumulation can realize various phenomena, such as chemical reaction, phase transition, magnetic ordering, and superconductivity. Electric double layers (EDLs), formed at solid–electrolyte interfaces, induce extremely large electric fields. This results in a high charge carrier accumulation in the solid, much more effectively than solid dielectric materials. In the present review, we describe recent developments in the field-effect transistors (FETs) with gate dielectrics of ionic liquids, which have attracted much attention due to their wide electrochemical windows, low vapor pressures, and high chemical and physical stability. We explain the capacitance effects of ionic liquids, and describe the various combinations of ionic liquids and organic and inorganic semiconductors that are used to achieve such effects as high transistor performance, insulator–metal transitions, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism, in addition to the applications of the ionic-liquid EDL-FETs in logic devices. We discuss the factors controlling the mobility and threshold voltage in these types of FETs, and show the ionic liquid dependence of the transistor performance.Takuya FujimotoTakuya Fujimoto graduated from Nagoya University in 2008, and received his PhD degree under the supervision of Professor K.

IntroductionOver the last decade, there has been growing interest in room-temperature ionic liquids and their potential application as nonvolatile “green solvents.”1–3 These liquids are highly polar, low-melting-point binary salts that are composed purely of ions—typically nitrogen-containing organic cations and inorganic anions (see Fig. 1).4,5 Since they exhibit no solvation effects, ionic liquids are a new type of electrolytes which are very different from aqueous, organic, gel, and polymer electrolytes. They have various advantages, such as high thermal and chemical stability, nonvolatility, nontoxicity, etc., and exist in a fluid state over a wide temperature range. They can be exposed to a high potential difference without undergoing redox reactions due to their wide electrochemical windows. Fig. 1  Molecular structures and abbreviations of the component cations and anions for the ionic liquids. The compound names are listed in Section 8. Among the various potential uses of ionic liquids, their application in electrical and electrochemical devices such as capacitors,6,7 batteries,8–10 solar cells,11–13 fuel cells,10,14,15 actuators,10,16,17 electrochromic windows,16,18 and numeric displays16 has attracted much attention. Ionic liquids are particularly promising as gate dielectric materials of field-effect transistors (FETs) and related devices, and much progress has been made in their development in recent years. These devices play a dominant role in our modern electronic and optical technologies.17–20 Although chemical doping, which is a traditional method to induce carriers in solids, suffers from serious problems such as toxic chemical treatments and irreversibility, the FET method enables a high-density carrier injection at semiconductor/insulator interfaces without these difficulties.For a long time, semiconductive silicon and its native oxide have been used as core component materials of FETs. However, it is now considered that organic compounds, polymers, nanocomposites, complex oxides, and/or low carrier density metals can play important roles in improving the performance of FETs.21–23 While the choice of material for the gate dielectrics depends critically on cost, durability, operation speed, impedance and transconductance, the most important figure of merit for prospective gate dielectrics is the specific capacitance, which determines the quantity of carriers that can be induced in the semiconductor channels of FETs at a given gate voltage. The accumulated charge Q in a parallel-plate capacitor is written as Q = CV,(1)where C and V are the capacitance and the applied voltage, respectively. The source–drain current in the saturated region, IsatD, can be expressed as19,24 (2)where L and W are the channel length and width, respectively, μ is the mobility, and VG and VthG are the gate- and gate-threshold-voltages, respectively. These equations indicate that a high capacitance results in high-density carriers, as well as a high on-current and a low switching voltage.The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is represented by (3)where ε0 and εr are the vacuum and relative permittivities, respectively, A is the area of the plates, and d is the distance between the two plates. Although the εr values of the ionic liquids are about 1–10,25–28 the ionic liquids can exhibit a high capacitance of ∼10 μF cm−2 due to the formation of electric double layers (EDLs) on the surfaces of semiconductors, which are composed of pairs of holes in the semiconductor and anions in the electrolyte, and vice versa (see Scheme 1). The EDLs realize high-density carrier injections that are higher by orders of magnitude than those of SiO2 gate dielectrics.29 For example, a 300 nm thick layer of SiO2 has a capacitance of 10 nF cm−2, so that a typical sheet carrier density attainable in the conventional inorganic-dielectric FET structures would be only ∼1013 cm−2. Although this value can modulate the conductivity of semiconductors to some extent, it would be unsatisfactory to induce drastic changes in electronic and/or structural properties, such as superconductivity and ferroelectricity, due to a dielectric breakdown of gate dielectrics at a large gate voltage. The EDL-FET methods can solve these problems, because they achieve an extremely high carrier density of up to 1015 cm−2.30–33 Scheme 1  Schematic diagrams of the EDL-FETs, showing hole (left) and electron (right) injections. While the ionic liquids have attracted much attention, their utilization as a gate dielectric material is a new trend in the history of the EDL-FETs. Since the electrolyte solutions of organic solvents and water are volatile and unstable in air, it is hard to maintain them at a constant concentration. In contrast, the ionic liquids are free from these difficulties, and their low molecular weights and high polarizabilities make them much more conductive than conventional electrolytes. These properties can realize a fast operation speed of the ionic-liquid EDL-FETs on the order of up to MHz,30,34,35 though the polymer-dielectric FETs exhibit slow responses due to their poor conductivity and slow polarization relaxation.36 Studies on the use of EDL-FETs in ionic-liquid gate dielectrics were initiated in 2007 in experiments using an inorganic semiconductor,37 which was insoluble and robust even in ionic-liquids. The first report on ionic-liquid EDL-FETs of organic semiconductors appeared in 2008.342. Electric double-layers formed by ionic liquidsIn this section, we describe EDLs at the interfaces between ionic liquids and solids. We also discuss the capacitances of ionic-liquids and their hybrid materials, from the perspective of their application to EDL-FETs.2.1 Ionic liquids at the interfaces with solidsThere has been extensive research on the solid (electrode)–liquid interfaces.38–40 As a result, various models have been proposed to describe the features of these interfaces. The Helmholtz model41 assumes the presence of an EDL formed by a single ion layer in solution, adsorbed on a solid surface, and charges in solid, as shown in Scheme 2(a). This model can treat an EDL mathematically as a simple capacitor. The Gouy–Chapman model introduces a diffusion property of the EDL (Scheme 2(b)),42,43 in which the electric potential decreases exponentially with the distance from the interface toward the solution, though this model does not work for highly-charged EDLs. To solve this problem, the Gouy–Chapman–Sterns model was proposed (Scheme 2(c)); this model combines the Helmholtz and Gouy–Chapman models, giving an internal Stern layer (Helmholtz layer) and an outer diffuse layer (Gouy–Chapman layer). The organization of solvent and solute ions in conventional electrolyte solutions can be adequately described by this Gouy–Chapman–Sterns model.44,45 However, this model was originally developed for dilute electrolyte solutions, in which solute ions are well-separated and have no interactions, such as those in the Debye–Huckel theory.46 This is definitely not the case for the ionic liquids, which can be recognized as intrinsic molten salts with ionic, solvent-free features at room temperature. Scheme 2(d) shows the multilayer model, which is established for molten salts. This model assumes a Boltzmann distribution of the vacancies at the interface, which produces polarization due to deformation of the ionic charges in the multilayer structure.47,48 The multilayer model gives a better agreement with the experimental results, compared to the other models, but none of the models developed thus far can completely reproduce the features of the molten salt system.38,40,49 Scheme 2  Electrochemical interface models: (a) Helmholtz model; (b) Gouy–Chapman model; (c) Gouy–Chapman–Sterns model; and (d) multilayer model. Baldelli et al. studied the surface structures of the imidazolium-based ionic liquids, such as BMIM-BF4, BMIM-PF6, and BMIM-DCA, by means of sum frequency generation (SFG) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).49–52 Based on their findings, they concluded that, in regard to BMIM-BF4 and BMIM-PF6, the ions form a Helmholtz-like layer at the interface and a potential drop occurs in the range of 3–5 Å from the metal surface. Further, the SFG measurements indicate that the “double-layer” structure depends on the potential; in the positive range of the potential of zero charge (PZC), the anions are adsorbed on the surface and the imidazolium rings in the cations are oriented perpendicular to the surface. When the PZC is negative, the cations are oriented to be parallel to the surface and the anions are removed from the surface. The observed thickness of the Helmholtz layer supports this double-layer model, though, due to the chemical nature of the anions, the multilayer model can provide a better view for BMIM-DCA, which exhibits a layer thickness of approximately 25 Å.The Helmholtz model indicates that, if an ionic liquid is inserted between an electrode and a semiconductor, the potential difference between them forms EDLs at the liquid–solid interface. Therefore, potential drops are confined within the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), as shown in Scheme 3(a). This potential drop in the ultrathin region caused by the EDLs allows a high-density charge accumulation. It is also notable that the thickness of the OHP is nearly independent of the thickness of the electrolyte. This feature is very different from those of solid-state dielectric materials, in which the potential change occurs linearly (Scheme 3(b)), so that the charge accumulation at interfaces depends significantly on the thickness of the dielectric layer. Scheme 3  Potential changes in the dielectric materials, sandwiched by an electrode and a semiconductor, for ionic liquids (a) and solid-state dielectrics (b). 2.2 Capacitance of ionic liquidsThe capacitance of gate-dielectrics is a key parameter in the production of high performance FETs, as discussed with eqn (1). We examined the frequency dependence of the capacitance CIL for six ionic liquids, DEME-TFSI, DEME-BF4, BMIM-TFSI, BMIM-BF4, BMIM-OTf and BMIM-PF6, in the range from 10−1 to 105 Hz.53 The results are shown in Fig. 2(a). In the low frequency range below 102 Hz, the CIL values are very large, being on the order of 10−6 F cm−2, and are different from each other, suggesting a significant material dependence. However, the values of CIL commonly show quick decreases above 102 Hz without material dependence. Fig. 2(b) shows the frequency dependence of the loss coefficient, tan δ. The values of tan δ are very small below 102 Hz, but show quick increases above this frequency. The values of tan δ can be expressed by the following equation: (4)where RP is the parasitic resistance, ω is the angular frequency, and IC and IR are the currents for CIL and RP, respectively. Since RP exhibits a linear dependence on frequency, the significant increase in tan δ above 102 Hz would be caused by the decrease in CIL shown in Fig. 2. The frequency dependences of CIL and tan δ of these ionic-liquids clearly indicate the formation of effective EDLs at the low frequencies. In addition, their high frequency behaviors suggest that the EDLs are formed by a spatial arrangement of the component cations and anions of the ionic liquids at the electrode interfaces, and the deformation hardly follows the high-frequency field alternation above 102 Hz. In the range below this frequency, where the EDL formation is expected, the capacitances are on the order of 10−6 F cm−2, and can allow a high-density charge accumulation of ∼1015 cm−2. This is much larger than those induced by conventional solid-state gate dielectrics. Fig. 2  Frequency dependence of capacitance (a) and tan δ, (b) for ionic-liquids: IL1, DEME-TFSI; IL2, DEME-BF4; IL3, BMIM-TFSI; IL4, BMIM-BF4; IL5, BMIM-OTf; and IL6, BMIM-PF6.

For instance, Takeya et al. reported the capacitances of EMIM-FSI, EMIM-TFSI, EMIM-BETI, EMIM-BF4 and EMIM-DCA.54 The CIL values of these materials commonly increase with decreasing frequency in the range of 10–103 Hz. Owing to the variation of the anions, the capacitance differs by two orders of magnitude, and EMIM-DCA exhibits the largest one (170 μF cm−2 at 0.1 Hz). This value theoretically suggests that a gate voltage of 1.0 V would lead to a carrier density of 5.3 × 1014 cm−2, which is 50 times larger than the maximum carrier density attainable in the typical SiO2 devices.2.3 Ionic-liquid hybrid materials for gate dielectricsAlong with the growing interest in ionic-liquid electronics, numerous studies have pursued the development of hybrid materials of ionic liquids in order to modulate their properties to permit additional functions, with the ultimate goal of producing high-performance EDL-FETs.Frisbie et al. reported the production of EDL-FETs using an ion gel electrolyte in 2007.55 This electrolyte is formed by gelation of a poly(styrene-block-ethylene oxide-block-styrene) (PS–PEO–PS; see Fig. 3) triblock copolymer in an ionic-liquid, BMIM-PF6. PEO was selected because this polymer is suitable as a solvated block due to its low Tg (∼220 K) and rapid segmental dynamics. The obtained ion gel shows the high capacitances of 41 and 2.4 μF cm−2 at 10 and 103 Hz, respectively. The polarization response time of the ion gel is very fast, and realizes a fast operation frequency of more than 100 Hz. The gel made from EMIM-TFSI exhibits a large capacitance of 43 μF cm−2, and a high frequency operation of 103 Hz.56 This group also reported another triblock copolymer poly(styrene-block-methylmethacrylate-block-styrene) (PS–PMMA–PS; see Fig. 3) for the ion gel electrolytes.57 Fig. 3  Structure of triblock copolymers for ion gels with ionic-liquids, PS–PEO–PS and PS–PMMA–PS. Lodge et al. reported “cut and stick” rubbery ion gels in 2012.58 They prepared solvent-free, freestanding ion gels, formed by poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP); see Fig. 4) and an ionic liquid, EMIM-TFSI. This ion gel is thermally stable even above 300 °C. Both spin-coating and solvent-casting methods are available to prepare this ion gel. The capacitance is as large as 10 μF cm−2 at low frequencies, and still remains above 1 μF cm−2 at 100 kHz. Due to its high tensile strength, the free-standing P(VDF-HFP) ion gel can be cut by hand and can be laminated on a semiconductor layer. This “cut and stick” processing is a convenient fabrication method for EDL-FETs of various semiconductors. Gate electrodes can be deposited directly on the gel by printing, or can be arranged with a side-gate configuration. Fig. 4  Molecular structure of P(VDF-HFP). Takeya et al. utilized the binary ionic-liquids Li-EMIM-FSI and K-EMIM-FSI.59 The capacitances of these liquids are much larger than that of neat EMIM-FSI, especially at high frequencies. Namely, the capacitances of Li-EMIM-FSI and K-EMIM-FSI are 3.5 and 1.5 μF cm−2 at 0.1 MHz, respectively, which are lower than those at 0.1 Hz, but only by less than one order of magnitude. This indicates a fast ionic diffusion to the response to bias voltage. Since a quick formation of the EDLs enables a rapid accumulation of high-density carriers and a high speed response, the switching performance of EDL-FETs would be improved significantly.3. Inorganic materials for ionic-liquid EDL-FETsThe recent progress in the EDL-FETs with ionic liquids has been remarkable. This method has been applied to various inorganic compounds, such as metal-oxides and metal-sulfides. In this section, we review the ionic-liquid EDL-FETs of these materials. Since the ground state of a highly-correlated electron system is significantly affected by band filling, the Fermi level tuning caused by gate voltage in FETs brings about an anomalous field-induced effect, such as insulator-to-metal transition, insulator-to-superconductor transition, or ferromagnetic transition.3.1 Insulator-to-metal transitionsInorganic metal-chalcogenide compounds such as metal-oxides and metal-selenides exhibit insulator-to-metal transitions by an electrostatic control.60–62 A high charge carrier injection in EDL-FETs can bring about this transition in the charge accumulation layer of semiconductors. This phenomenon is applicable to new logic elements with low operation voltage and high speed response.The first EDL-FET with an ionic-liquid gate-dielectric was produced by Hebard et al. in 2007, who used a metal-oxide, InOx.37 They fabricated a top-gate, bottom-contact EDL-FET by using an amorphous thin-film of InOx for the semiconductor layer and an ionic-liquid EMIM-BETI for the gate dielectrics. The electron density n and the n-type mobility μ were estimated at room temperature by the Hall-effect or the field-effect measurements. The obtained parameters are nHall = 2.2 × 1013 cm−2, μnHall = 20.6 cm2 V−1 s−1, nFE = 3.7 × 1013 cm−2, and μnFE = 37.3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The on/off ratio is ca. 104. These EDL-FET mobilities are larger than 3.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 that is achieved by the AlOx gate-dielectric FETs of the same material.63 The authors also examined the temperature dependence of the device performance, and confirmed that the gate-induced charges are frozen below the glass transition temperature of the ionic liquid.Iwasa et al. reported a top-gate, top-contact ZnO single-crystal EDL-FET with DEME-TFSI in 2009.30 The Hall effect measurements revealed that the nHall reaches 4.5 × 1014 cm−2 with a μnHall of around 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature. They examined the transient response of this EDL-FET to a square-shaped gate voltage VG. It was indicated that the gate-induced current reaches 85% of the steady-state one within 0.5 s upon switching on, and falls by 99% within 0.5 s upon switching off. This switching rate is much faster than those of the EDL-FETs with an electrolyte of liquid or solid KClO4/PEO.64 The variable-temperature measurements revealed that the channel resistance of the ionic-liquid EDL-FETs depends little on temperature. This means that the highly-charged ZnO channel would be in a metallic state, while it is originally insulating at VG = 0 V. The μnHall value reaches 250 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 10 K under a gate voltage of VG = 2 V. The EDL-FETs with the mobile ions in a supercooled state achieve a high nHall value of up to 8.0 × 1014 cm−2 at 220 K, which is maintained as 5.5 × 1014 cm−2 at 1.8 K.Zaumseil et al. also examined top-gate, top-contact EDL-FETs of poly-crystalline ZnO with eight ionic liquids: EMIM-TFSI, EMIM-TCB, EMIM-FAP, BMIM-TFSI, BMIM-FAP, HMIM-FAP, EMMIM-TFSI, and BMMIM-TFSI.65 The highest and lowest μnFE values are 15.9 and 1.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the HMIM-FAP and EMIM-TCB devices, respectively. They also found that the EDL-FET performance is stable over time in a nitrogen atmosphere, but degrades quickly in air, due to the water absorption and surface reactions of ZnO. Replacement of the acidic H-atom with a methyl group in the imidazolium cation, and passivation of the ZnO surface with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) improves the device stability in air. ZnO thin-film EDL-FETs with an ion-gel gate-dielectric composed of P(VDF-HFP) and EMIM-TFSI were also reported by Lodge et al.58 They fabricated a side-gate, top-contact EDL-FET, which exhibits an on/off current ratio of ∼104 and a high μnFE of 2.3 ± 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1.While the metal-sulfide SnS2 had previously been reported to possess a μnFE greater than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1,66 Iwasa et al. fabricated EDL-FETs with single crystals of this compound in 2011.32 His group attained a high nHall value of 5.4 × 1014 cm−2 at room temperature, which would correspond to 0.37 electrons per one Sn atom, if the electrons were uniformly distributed in the accumulation layer with a thickness of 1 nm. The sheet resistance depends little on temperature under a positive VG. This means that the activation energy Ea should depend on VG. In fact, the Arrhenius fits for the temperature dependence indicate that the value of Ea decreases from 307 to 15 meV with an increase in VG. Such a VG-dependent Ea can be explained by a shift of the Fermi level in the donor band toward the conduction band, from an energy that is 307 meV lower than the bottom of the conduction band. However, this SnS2 channel does not reach a metallic state, probably because the Fermi level cannot move into the conduction band due to the large density of states for the impurity levels. The MoS2 thin-film EDL-FETs were also reported by Takenobu et al. in 2012.67 These thin-films were fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on an SiO2 substrate, and the gate dielectrics were formed by an ion gel consisting of PS–PMMA–PS and EMIM-TFSI. These EDL-FETs exhibit an excellent band transport with a low threshold voltage below 1 V, a high μnFE of 12.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a high on/off current ratio of 105. The MoS2 transistors can be fabricated on a flexible substrate such as polyimide, and exhibit remarkably high mechanical flexibility without degradation in the electrical characteristics. They are applicable to large-area flexible electronics.Thin-film EDL-FETs of a metal-selenide, Bi2Se3, combined with DEME-TFSI, were reported by Onose et al. in 2011.33 Bi2Se3 is a topological insulator and is attracting much interest.68–70 The epitaxial thin films of this compound were grown on an InP substrate by means of pulsed laser deposition. The EDL-FETs of this material with a top-gate, top-contact structure, achieved nHall = 1.5 × 1014 cm−2, and μnHall = ∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 2 K. The authors also succeeded in observing a negative magnetoconductance due to a two-dimensional weak anti-localization by the EDL effects.The EDL-FETs of nano-crystal CdSe with an ion gel PS–PMMA–PS in EMIM-TFSI were reported by Norris et al. in 2010.71 These transistors had a top-gate, bottom-contact structure. The EDL-FET measurements revealed a high μnFE value of up to 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an nFE of ∼1014 cm−2. They examined the dependence of the transistor performance on the diameter of the nano-crystals, and found a systematic variation in the transport parameters. A strong correlation was observed between the device turn-on voltage and the energy level of the lowest unoccupied state that depends on the size of the nano-crystals. The electron mobility increases with increasing particle diameter, and reaches its largest value for the films of the nano-crystals of 5.1 nm. The temperature dependence of the mobility follows the Arrhenius law in the temperature range of 233–300 K, which is consistent with the nearest neighbor-hopping transport model.72 The size-dependence of the mobility can be explained by both the size dependence of Ea, which scales with the Coulombic charging energy of an individual particle, and the size dependence of a pre-exponential factor for mobility μ0, which is associated with the total number of interparticle hops and the energy distribution of the electronic states. The authors also fabricated similar EDL-FETs using Ag-doped CdSe nano-crystals, which exhibit strong fluorescence. This FET shows that μnFE = ∼0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.73Although nearly all the inorganic materials show n-type semiconductive behavior, Iwasa et al. realized an ambipolar operation of the EDL-FETs with DEME-TFSI by effectively tuning the Fermi energy in the band structure.74 As an active layer, they adopted the topological insulator Bi2Te3, which is an analogue of Bi2Se3. The estimated μFE is around 300 cm2 V−1 s−1 for both holes and electrons. The 3D carrier density under a high electric field is as large as 1 × 1019 cm−3. The on/off ratios for both hole and electron accumulations are on the order of 103.The ambipolar EDL-FETs of thin-flake MoS2, which is a transition-metal dichalcogenide with an archetypal layered structure, were fabricated with DEME-TFSI by Iwasa et al.75 While bulk MoS2 was known to be an n-type semiconductor, these MoS2 EDL-FETs exhibited an ambipolar operation. The Hall effect measurements revealed the following parameters: μnHall = 44 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μpHall = 86 cm2 V−1 s−1. The value of nHall reaches ∼1014 cm−2, and the on/off ratio is ∼200 for either electron or hole transport. The temperature-dependent measurements indicated that the high-density carriers of both holes and electrons induce metallic behavior in the MoS2 channel. The EDL-FETs using the other metal dichalcogenides, WS2, were reported by Morpurgo et al.76 They made a top-gate, bottom-contact EDL-FET of thin-flake WS2 with P14-FAP. The values of μnHall and μpHall were 20 and 90 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and nHall reached up to 1014 cm−2.In 2009, Norris et al. reported the ambipolar EDL-FETs, in which PbSe nano-crystals were adopted as an active layer and an ion gel PS–PMMA–PS in EMIM-TFSI was chosen as the gate dielectric.31 The values of nHall for electrons and holes are higher than 1014 cm−2 at an operation voltage below 2.5 V. These densities correspond to 3 carriers (electron or hole) per one nano-crystal. The μnFE and μpFE are as high as 0.4 and 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, though they depend on the charge densities.Shimizu et al. reported the DEME-TFSI EDL-FETs of the thin films of a topological insulator, (Bi1–xSbx)2Te3, which were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).77 The films of 20 nm thickness were grown on lattice-matched semi-insulating InP substrates. The temperature dependence of the resistance of these films indicates the coexistence of a bulk insulating phase and a metallic surface. These thin-films show ambipolar behavior, when the film composition x is in the range of 0.8–0.9. This indicates that the surface state carriers can be systematically controlled by the EDL-FETs. The μnHall and μpHall are 140 and 60 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with nHall = 2 × 1012 cm−2. The surface chemical potential in the (Bi1–xSbx)2Te3-based EDL-FETs moves across the Dirac point, by changing the number of the carrier. This results in an ambipolar transport in a topological transport regime (Table 1).

The EDL-FETs show n-type behavior with an enhancement of nHall from zero to 1014 cm−2 at a gate voltage of 3.5 V. The μnHall reaches 500–1000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at low temperatures. A two-dimensional superconducting state emerges below a critical transition temperature of Tc = 0.4 K, which is comparable to the highest value attainable for chemically-doped bulk crystals.84Goldman et al. also reported an insulator-to-superconductor transition of the SrTiO3 single-crystals, using ionic-liquid EDL-FETs.85 They fabricated top-gate, top-contact EDL-FETs with DEME-TFSI. The onset temperature of the superconducting transition is around 0.4 K, and nHall = 3.9 × 1014 cm−2. Further, they observed an anomalous Hall effect, suggesting magnetic ordering. Gordon et al. reported a Kondo effect of the SrTiO3 single-crystals in EDL-FETs.86 An ion gel, EMIM-TFSI with PS–PMMA–PS, is used as the gate dielectric. An upturn of the saturation resistance and a negative magnetoresistance indicating a Kondo effect appear at high gate voltages. These facts, observed with the help of a wide tunability of electric field in the ionic gel, promote an interpretation that the field-induced 2D electron system in SrTiO3 can be characterized as an admixture between the localized, unpaired electrons in the magnetic Ti 3d orbitals, and the delocalized electrons in the partially-filled Ti 3d conduction band.Iwasa et al. studied the insulator-to-superconductor transition of ZrNCl single-crystals in the ionic-liquid EDL-FETs with DEME-TFSI in 2010.87 This parent material was known to be an intercalated superconductor with a relatively high μn of 80 cm2 V−1 s−1.88,89 They adopted a mechanical micro-cleavage technique to prepare a thin, atomically-flat flake of the single crystals.90,91 The EDL-FET measurements at 220 K indicate n-type behavior with an on/off ratio of around 40. The nHall on the ZrNCl channel surface increases from 0.3 × 1014 to 2.5 × 1014 cm−2 with increasing VG from 0 to 4.5 V. The EDL capacitance formed at the ionic-liquid/ZrNCl interface is estimated to be 9.2 μF cm−2, which is larger than the estimation for an electrolyte made of polyethylene oxide and KClO4.64 The μnHall is 50 cm2 V−1 s−1, which agrees well with that of the bulk LixZrNCl obtained from the transport measurements on the polycrystalline samples.89 The authors applied a gate voltage VG at 220 K, and then cooled the device, maintaining the VG. When VG = 3.5 V, a small dip in the temperature dependence of the sheet resistance Rs appears around 14 K; this dip represents the transition to a superconductor, as confirmed by its dependence on the magnetic field. Further, an increase of the superconducting transition temperature and a suppression of the resistance upturn are observed with an increase in VG from 3.5 to 4 V, and the transition temperature reaches 15.2 K with the zero resistance at VG = 4.5 and 5 V. The nHall at VG = 3.5 V, which is the onset voltage of the field-induced superconductivity, is 1.7 × 1014 cm−2. This value is nearly double that of the initial nHall of 0.8 × 1014 cm−2 in bulk LixZrNCl with x = 0.05, and the electrostatically accumulated carriers exist in two sandwiched layers with a thickness of ∼2 nm. This value is considerably smaller than that of SrTiO3 (∼10 nm),83 which has a large dielectric constant owing to its quantum para-electric nature.92 The authors examined the temperature dependence of Rs and confirmed the existence of the Kosterlitz–Thouless transition,93 providing evidence for the 2D nature of the observed superconductivity. The authors also found a minor superconductor component with a lower Tc, which was induced by an unintentional chemical reaction due to high gate bias—that is, the minor component was driven by an electrostatic charge accumulation at the interface. These results indicate that the field-induced superconductivity is different from the bulk one.Electric-field induced superconductivity for a metal-disulphide, MoS2, was reported by Takagi et al. in 2012.94 They adopted 2H-type crystals with the space group P63/mmc as a semiconductive layer and DEME-TFSI as the gate dielectric of the EDL-FETs. This device exhibits n-type behavior with nHall of ∼3.1 × 1014 cm−2. With an increase in VG, Rs shows a clear decrease, and, at VG = 3 V, the divergent behavior of Rs completely disappears, indicative of the formation of a metallic state in the channel. In this metallic state at VG ≥ 3 V, a sudden drop of Rs is observed below 10 K due to a field-induced superconductivity. These results were reproducible over five devices. Iwasa et al. also reported the superconducting transitions of MoS2 in 2012, describing its phase diagram.95 They peeled off thin flakes of MoS2 from the surfaces of bulk 2H-type single crystals by the Scotch tape method,90,91 transferred them onto the surfaces of HfO2 grown by atomic layer deposition on an Nb-doped SrTiO3 substrate, and then fabricated EDL-FETs with DEME-TFSI as a gate dielectric. The ionic liquid gate induced a carrier density of ∼1014 cm−2, and the high-k dielectric back gate of HfO2 modulated the value to ∼1013 cm−2, which remained effective even after the freezing of the ion motions below ∼200 K. This quasi-continuous electrostatic carrier injection, achieved through a combination of the liquid and solid gating, produces the superconductivity in a narrow range of nHall; the superconducting transition appears at nHall = 6.8 × 1013 cm−2, and then shows a saturation at nHall = 1.2 × 1014 cm−2, reaching the highest temperature of Tc = 10.8 K, followed by a decrease in Tc thereafter. This indicates a dome-shaped phase boundary of the superconducting state with respect to n2D. It is recognized that the Tc of the field-induced superconducting phase of MoS2 is ∼40% higher than the highest Tc in CsxMoS2 obtained by chemical doping,96 even though the field-induced nHall is much lower than that of the chemical effects.Dhoot et al. reported an insulator-to-superconductor transition in cuprate YBa2Cu3O7–x (YBCO) thin-films.97 They fabricated two devices, adopting a poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium perchlorate (PEO/LiClO4) polymer electrolyte, and an ionic liquid, EMIM-TFSI, as gate dielectrics. Their EDL-FETs have a top-gate, top-contact structure. The EDL-FETs with the PEO/LiClO4 polymer electrolyte exhibit a superconducting transition at Tc = 6 and 44 K at VG = +3 and −3 V, respectively. It is also notable that the onset temperatures are extremely high: Ton = 83 and 134 K at VG = −3 and +3 V, respectively. These values are comparable to those of YBCO (95 K) and the mercury-based cuprates (138 K, at atmospheric pressure). The ionic-liquid EDL-FETs also exhibit a decrease in the normal-state resistance and the transition at Ton = 86 and 90 K at VG = 0 and −3 V, respectively. Goldman et al. also reported EDL-FETs with gate-dielectrics of an ionic-liquid DEME-TFSI and an active layer of ultrathin YBCO.98,99 They succeeded in continuously modifying the electrical transport properties by the applied gate voltage, and examined a two-step doping mechanism for the electrostatic doping of YBCO, which was different from the conventional chemical doping. They concluded that the low dimensionality of the films or the high local field in the EDL-FETs produces this phase transition and brings about anomalous behavior.Božović et al. reported the electric field effects on the superconductivity of La2–xSrxCuO4 in 2012.100 They fabricated top-gate, bottom-contact thin-film EDL-FETs with DEME-TFSI. The active thin film in these transistors consisted of only three unit cells of La1.84Sr0.16CuO4. The effective carrier concentration varies from 0.009 to 0.142 per Cu atom, and the value of Tc changes from 0 to 25 K, which is ∼70% of the highest value for this compound.3.3 Electric-field-induced ferromagnetismSpintronics is an emerging technology exploiting both the intrinsic spin of the electron and its associated magnetic moment, in addition to its fundamental electronic charge, in solid-state devices.101,102 In this section, we review field-induced ferromagnetism in the EDL-FET framework, as a result of carrier-mediated exchange interactions.Kawasaki et al. reported the electrostatically-induced ferromagnetism in an EDL-FET structure at room temperature in 2011,103 which consisted of cobalt-doped titanium dioxide as an active layer and a gate-dielectric layer such as an ionic liquid DEME-TFSI and an CsClO4 electrolyte dissolved in polyethylene oxide. Epitaxial films of anatase, Ti0.90Co0.10O2 (001), were grown on LaAlO3 (100) substrates by a pulsed laser deposition method. The EDL-FETs were fabricated with a top-gate, top-contact structure for the two kinds of electrolytes. The nHall increases from 4.0 × 1013 to 2.7 × 1014 cm−2, as VG increases from 0 to 3.8 V, whereas μnHall remains nearly constant (4–6 cm2 V−1 s−1). The magnetic field dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity σAH indicates that, though σAH is negligibly small at VG = 0 V, where the Ti0.90Co0.10O2 channel is in a paramagnetic state, σAH exhibits a significant enhancement with a hysteresis loop in the field scans, when VG increases and the nHall becomes greater than ∼1 × 1019 cm−3. This is an electric field-induced ferromagnetic state, which is consistent with those in the chemically-doped samples. The values of σAH and the conductivity show a similar temperature dependence, indicating that the electrical conduction would induce the ferromagnetic coupling. The increase in the Curie temperature TC at a positive VG is consistent with the polarity of electron carriers.Chiba et al. reported the magnetic properties of Co ultra-thin films, which were incorporated in EDL-FETs.104 They used an ionic-liquid DEME-TFIS as a gate-dielectric. In contrast to the Curie constant TC at VG = 0 V, which is roughly estimated as ∼325 K, where the magnetization M drops to nearly zero, the TC values at VG = +2 and −2 V are ∼280 and 380 K, respectively. That is, the value of TC changes over 100 K. The modulated sheet electron density per 1 V is 7.9 × 1013 cm−2, which is ∼7 times larger than that of the 50 nm HfO2 gate-dielectrics at 1 MV cm−1. The giant modification of TC is caused by this large change in the electron density. Though the amount of carrier modulation is limited by the breakdown voltage in the solid-state FETs, the EDL-FETs present can modulate the carrier density much more easily to control TC.Checkelsky et al. adopted the EDL-FET technique to topological insulators, Mn-doped Bi2Te3–ySey, to study a ferromagnetic response through an interaction between local spins and surface Dirac electrons, when the chemical potential lies in the bulk electronic band gap.105 They fabricated side-gate, bottom-contact EDL-FETs with MnxBi2–xTe3–ySey and DEME-TFSI on an SiO2 substrate. The application of both solid-dielectric and ionic-liquid gating allowed them to examine the transport response of the surface states within the bulk band gap, in the presence of magnetic ions. The observed anomalous Hall effects (AHE) and the concurrent magnetoconductance contrast with the behavior of conventional dilute magnetic semiconductors, and are consistent with the surface-state-mediated ferromagnetism approaching a quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) ground state.3.4 Other materialsThe spin–orbit interactions in metals are much stronger than those in organic materials, oxides, and semiconductors, due to the Fermi degeneracy in metals. Some specific metals exhibit a strong surface spin–orbit interaction,106,107 which can be manipulated by an electric field. Therefore, the field-induced modulation of electronic states in metallic systems can be a key technique for the spintronics devices.108,109 The EDL-FETs are advantageous for application of a large electric field to metals. Nakayama et al. reported an EDL-FET with an Au active layer and an ionic-liquid DEME-TFSI gate-dielectric,110 which exhibited a μnFE of 30 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 220 K. The electroresistance ratio becomes 2.3% at a positive gate voltage of 1.7 V. The electric field at the ionic liquid/Au interface is estimated as 27 MV cm−1, indicating that the EDLs work as a nanogap capacitor with a large electric field. Therefore, the EDL-FETs are expected to modulate the surface electronic states in metals, affecting the spin-dependent phenomena.Hasegawa et al. tried to clarify the dynamic properties of a silicon-based EDL-FET.111 Since the properties of silicon are well known, this FET is a good model to investigate the effects of ionic-liquid gate-dielectrics. They fabricated a top-gate, top-contact EDL-FET on a semi-insulating single-crystal Si wafer with an ionic-liquid EMIM-BF4 as a gate-dielectric. It was found that the μpFE is ∼100 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the on/off ratio is quite low (∼5) due to the bulk high conductivity of silicon. The dynamic response measurements revealed that the switching speed is 20 μs for this ionic-liquid gate-dielectric EDL-FET, while it is 3 ms for the EDL-FETs with LiBF4-dissolved poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) gate-dielectrics. The authors considered that this slow response is caused by the large viscosity of PEG.Yang et al. reported a VO2 EDL-FET with DEME-TFSI.112,113 The VO2 channel conductance at room temperature increases by ∼50% at VG = +2 V gate bias, whereas a slight decrease of VO2 channel conductance is observed at VG = −2 V. In a high-temperature metallic state of VO2, no gating effect is observed. The gate voltage of VG = +2 V brings about a low-temperature shift of ∼0.5 °C of the metal–insulator phase-transition in VO2, while VG of −2 V yields a small high-temperature shift of less than 0.1 °C.Tokura et al. also reported a VO2 EDL-FET with DEME-TFSI.114 They adopted a top-gate, bottom-contact structure, and found that the surface electrostatic charging activates the motion of localized charge carriers in bulk, and leads to the emergence of a three-dimensional metallic state. It is demonstrated that the metal–insulator transition at 290 K is completely suppressed by an application of VG less than 1 V, and stabilizes the metallic state down to low temperatures. The most peculiar feature is that the whole electron system converts into a metallic one due to the strong electron correlations, even though the film thickness is 70 nm. Since the electrons are highly correlated, the surface metallic state triggers the delocalization of pre-existing but localized carriers. In the voltage sweep, the first-order nature of the metal-to-insulator transition provides a non-volatile memory effect, which is operable at room temperature.4. Organic and carbon-based semiconductors for ionic-liquid EDL-FETsOrganic compounds have attracted much attention because of their various advantages, such as flexibility, low-cost fabrication and easy modification.115–119 In organic electronics, it is important to develop component materials such as conductors, semiconductors and insulators, for low-cost fabrication of electric circuits on flexible substrates. From this perspective, there is a significant interest in developing solution-processable dielectric materials that can serve as gate insulators in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). In this section, we review the history of EDL-OFETs of ionic-liquids and their hybrid gate-dielectrics.4.1 p-Type organic materialsIn addition to the EDL-FETs of inorganic semiconductors, high performance EDL-OFETs have also been widely reported. In particular, p-type organic semiconductors have been well developed due to their air and chemical stability.115,116Takeya et al. reported the first organic EDL-OFET of an ionic-liquid gate-dielectric by using rubrene single crystals in 2008.34 Rubrene was known to be an organic semiconductor with a high μ of up to 50 cm2 V−1 s−1.120,121 The authors fabricated top-gate, bottom-contact EDL-OFETs with ionic liquids, EMIM-FSI and EMIM-TFSI, placing a droplet of ionic liquid on top of a rubrene single crystal and inserting a gold wire in it as a gate electrode. The obtained μpFE values are 0.41 and 1.2 cm2 V–1 s−1 for the EMIM-TFSI and EMIM-FSI devices, respectively, which are comparable to those of SiO2 gate-dielectrics devices (∼1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1). They also fabricated bottom-gate, bottom-contact EDL-OFETs using rubrene single crystals in 2008.122 To make use of the ionic conduction of the ionic liquids, they developed a well structure to hold the poorly viscous liquid underneath the organic single crystals by the capillary force; the well structure is shaped with a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomer on which a rubrene single-crystal is electrostatically attached (see Scheme 4). They achieved a high μpFE of ∼5 cm2 V−1 s−1 by this PDMS stamp structure. The sheet transconductance turns out to be as high as 20 μS at VD = −1 V, which is the largest among the values reported so far for the OFETs. In 2009, this group obtained a μpFE of 9.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 by combining rubrene single-crystals, the PDMS stamp structure, and an ionic-liquid EMIM-FSI.54 They also reported EDL-OFETs of rubrene single-crystals using binary ionic-liquids, Li-EMIM-FSI and K-EMIM-FSI, which exhibited μpFE values of 1.5 and 2.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 with VthG values of 0.40 V and 0.25 V, respectively.59 Scheme 4  Structure of an EDL-OFET fabricated in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomer stamp. Xie and Frisbie reported the development of the EDL-OFETs of rubrene single-crystals with five ionic liquids, EMIM-TFSI, EMIM-FAP, P13-TFSI, P14-TFSI, and P14-FAP, with a PDMS stamp structure, in 2011.123 The μpFE reaches 3.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature with P14-FAP. The temperature dependence of the mobility indicates a thermally activated behavior with an activation energy of 30 meV. The high nFE above 1013 cm−2 is confirmed by a displacement current method.Pentacene has attracted much attention for its high mobility.119,124–126 Frisbie et al. reported the EDL-OFETs of pentacene single-crystals with a PDMS stamp configuration in an ionic liquid, EMIM-TFSI.127 These devices exhibited a μpFE of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature. Matsumoto et al. also reported pentacene single-crystal EDL-OFETs in 2012.128 They used ionic liquids not only as gate-dielectrics but also as crystallization solvents in the vacuum deposition of pentacene. An ionic liquid, OMIM-TFSI, was used for these purposes, and the crystal sizes reached 200 μm with the surfaces exhibiting a molecular-scale step-and-terrace structure. The bottom-gate, bottom-contact EDL-OFETs of P13-TFSI exhibit a μpFE of 5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 104.In 2011, Kubozono et al. reported thin-film EDL-OFETs of a semiconductive one-dimensional hydrocarbon, [7]phenacene,129 with ionic-liquids, EMIM-TFSI and BMIM-PF6. The top-gate, top-contact thin-film EDL-OFETs exhibited the following performance: μpFE = 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, VthG = −1.7 V, S-factor = 200 mV per decade and on/off ratio = 93 for the EMIM-TFSI OFET, and μpFE = 2.6 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1, VthG = −2.7 V, S-factor = 89 mV per decade and on/off ratio = 1.9 × 107 for BMIM-PF6. They also fabricated a top-gate, bottom-gate EDL-OFET with BMIM-PF6, and revealed the following: μpFE = 2.8 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1, VthG = −2.5 V, S-factor = 107 mV per decade and on/off ratio = 2.9 × 107. This performance is comparable to those of the OFETs with an SiO2 or a HfO2 gate dielectric, except that the S-factors of the ionic-liquid-gate devices are much better than those of the inorganic ones due to the low voltage operations of the former. This group also fabricated single-crystal EDL-OFETs of [5]phenacene, which is called picene, in 2012.130 This material is known to be a parent compound of an organic superconductor and to have potential applications in organic electronics.131–134 The EDL-OFET with a top-gate, bottom-contact structure, and BMIM-PF6 as a gate-dielectric, exhibits μpFE = 1.8 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1, VthG = −1.9 V, and S-factor = 160 mV per decade. This mobility is comparable to those of the solid-state gate-dielectric OFETs with SiO2 and Ta2O5 gate-dielectrics. They investigated the hole accumulation by measuring the relationship between the capacitance and the gate voltage (C–VG) for a metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) structure, and concluded that 0.45 holes are injected into one picene molecule from the EDLs.We fabricated EDL-OFETs of octathio[8]circulene (see Fig. 5), which is called sulflower,135 with an ionic-liquid gate-dielectrics. This material is promising in organic electronics, because of a characteristic 3D close-packing in the crystal and its chemical stability.136–139 It is also notable that this material is insoluble in ionic liquids, though most of the molecule-based organic thin-films dissolve in them.140 The calculated μpFE is 2.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.141 Perepichka et al. fabricated a bottom-gate, bottom-contact thin-film OFET of octathio[8]circulene with Au electrodes and an SiO2 gate-dielectric. They obtained a μpFE of 9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a VthG of −45 V.142 Fig. 5  Organic materials for p-type EDL-OFETs. The values indicate their representative hole mobilities. In 2011, we reported a metal-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) thin-film EDL-OFET.143 The Pc derivatives have been utilized in organic/molecular electronic devices as p-type semiconductors.144–147 These semiconductors are stable even in ionic liquids. We fabricated a top-gate, bottom-contact EDL-FET with DEME-TFSI. Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the transfer and output characteristics, respectively, and the OFET performance clearly indicates that H2Pc operates as a p-type semiconductor. The μpFE, VthG, S-factor and on/off ratio are 4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, −0.2 V, 0.55 V per decade and 103, respectively.

Copyright 2013 Royal Society of Chemistry. 4.2 n-Type organic materialsThe n-type OFETs are more rare than p-type ones because the former are unstable in the presence of water and/or oxygen. The carrier mobilities of n-type OFETs are generally much lower than those of p-type OFETs, and the former ones require a high threshold voltage, which is a serious disadvantage for the development of low-power organic complementary circuits.115,116Takeya et al. reported thin-film EDL-OFETs of TCNQ single-crystals and fullerene C60, using an ionic-liquid EMIM-TFSI.148 They fabricated a bottom-gate, bottom-contact structure for the TCNQ EDL-OFET, using a PDMS stamp structure, on which a TCNQ single crystal was electrostatically attached (see Scheme 4). The μnFE is 8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, while an air-gap OFET exhibits a μnFE of 0.54 cm2 V−1 s−1. The top-gate, bottom-contact C60 devices show a μnFE value of 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a VthG of ∼0.4 V. A bottom-gate, bottom-contact SiO2 gate-dielectric OFET shows a μnFE of 1.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a VthG of 20 V (Fig. 7). Fig. 7  Organic materials for n-type EDL-OFETs. The values indicate their representative electron mobilities. Morpurgo et al. reported a high-performance n-type EDL-FET, using single crystals of N,N′′-bis(n-alkyl)-(1,7 and 1,6)-dicyanoperylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide)s (PDIF-CN2).149 They fabricated a bottom-gate, bottom-contact EDL-OFET, making use of the PDMS stamp structure (see Scheme 4). An ionic-liquid P13-TFSI was chosen as a gate dielectric. A high μnFE of 5.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved, which was comparable to that of an air-gap FET without ionic liquid in the PDMS stamp structure (5.5 cm2 V−1 s−1).We made n-type thin-film EDL-OFETs of metal-free tetrakis(thiadiazole)porphyrazine (H2TTDPz) with an ionic liquid, DEME-TFSI, as the gate-dielectric.143,150 H2TTDPz is known to be an acceptor molecule and shows n-type transport. The advantages of the TTDPz series are their stability and insolubility against ionic liquids. Fig. 6(c) and (d) show the transfer and output characteristics, respectively, and the OFET performance clearly indicates an n-type operation with μnFE = 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, VthG = −0.1 V, S-factor = 0.36 V per decade, and on/off ratio = 104. Note that the performance of H2TTDPz EDL-OFETs is quite similar to that of H2Pc with respect to the mobility, threshold voltages, subthreshold slopes, and on/off ratio, though the latter exhibit p-type operation. The H2TTDPz EDL-OFETs are thus applicable to complementary organic inverters, as will be discussed in Section 6.1.We also fabricated a thin-film EDL-OFET of VOTTDPz, which was an analogue of H2TTDPz.151 VOTTDPz is paramagnetic (S = 1/2) and forms amorphous thin films. This device exhibits a high μnFE of 2.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a VthG of 0.14 V. Despite the VOTTDPz thin films being amorphous, this mobility is higher by two orders of magnitude than that of the closed-shell derivative, H2TTDPz (10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).143,150 It is worth noting that the mobilities of VOPc and TiOPc are higher than those of H2Pc and the divalent metal Pc's, suggesting that axially-coordinated porphyrazines possess higher mobilities than the planar metal-free and divalent derivatives. The partial overlaps that are commonly observed in these materials due to the presence of the axial ligands can bring about multidimensional network structures.152 This is probably advantageous for carrier transport, since it is not significantly affected by lattice defects and distortions.4.3 Ambipolar organic materialsRecently, we fabricated ambipolar ionic-liquid EDL-OFETs by using the thin films of PbPc and TiOPc.153 The ambipolar transport required a specific condition, because, in these two MPcs, n-type operation was more difficult than that of p-type due to their unstableness in air and/or water. The ambipolar operation was successful only when the semiconductive thin films were covered by the ionic-liquid gate-dielectrics in a vacuum. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the transfer characteristics in the p- and n-type regions, respectively, for the EDL-OFETs of PbPc and TiOPc with DEME-TFSI. The performance of the OFETs clearly indicates the ambipolar transport of these materials with low applied voltage. They exhibit a large source–drain current |ID| in the range of 0.1 mA, generated with small-gate voltages |VG| and source–drain voltages |VD| (<0.1 V), while the gate leakage current |IG| is negligibly small (<0.5 μA).

Takenobu et al. reported an ambipolar EDL-OFET operation for pentacene and rubrene, by modifying the source and drain electrode materials in 2012.154 They used Au and Ca as source and drain electrodes, respectively, to reduce the injection barriers for holes and electrons. An ion-gel electrolyte with PS–PMMA–PS, and ionic liquids, EMIM-TFSI and P13-TFSI, were adopted for the gate-dielectrics. Although hole transport is dominant in these transistors, even after electrode modification, the pentacene EDL-FETs showed values of μpFE = 0.034 and μnFE = 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the ionic liquid EMIM-TFSI, and μpFE = 0.11 and μnFE = 3.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P13-TFSI. The rubrene EDL-FETs gave values of μpFE = 0.77 and μnFE = 1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μpFE = 0.97 and μnFE = 1.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for EMIM-TFSI and P13-TFSI, respectively.4.4 Polymer materialsPolymer materials have great potential and practical applications, since they have stability in air and water and structural flexibility.155–158In 2007, Frisbie et al. reported an EDL-OFET of semiconductive regioregular poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) with an ion gel of a PS–PEO–PS triblock copolymer in an ionic-liquid BMIM-PF6.55 A top-gate, bottom-contact structure exhibited a high performance with a μpFE of 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 105, in a vacuum of 10−6 Torr. The authors tested the transient response of the EDL-OFETs to an input gate voltage of 100 Hz square-wave, and observed response times of 1 and 0.5 ms at the switching on and off processes, respectively. This means that it takes 1 ms to obtain a stable output. In 2008, they compared the performances of EDL-OFETs made using three ionic liquids, EMIM-TFSI, EMIM-PF6 and EMIM-OctOSO3, in the same device configuration.56 The average μpFE is 1 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the on/off current ratio is above 104 for the three. However, the maximum operating frequencies of these EDL-OFETs are notably different—namely, 1000, 100, and 1 Hz for EMIM-TFSI, EMIM-PF6, and EMIM-OctOSO3, respectively. They also examined the performance of the other polymers in 2008,159 making an OFET with a top-gate, bottom-contact structure with a PS–PEO–PS ion-gel in EMIM-TFSI, for various active layers, P3HT, PQT-12 and F8T2. The μpFE values are 1.8, 1.6 and 0.8 cm2 V–1 s−1 for P3HT, PQT-12 and F8T2, respectively. It is noteworthy that these materials can work on a flexible polyimide substrate. They also examined the ionic-liquid gate-dielectric EDL-OFETs of semiconductive polymers.160 The top-gate, bottom-contact EDL-OFETs with ionic-liquid EMIM-FAP show high μpFE values of 0.27, 0.86, 0.08, and 0.07 cm2 V−1 s–1 for P3DTV, P3HT, MEH-PPV and F8BT, respectively (Fig. 9). Fig. 9  Polymer materials for EDL-OFETs. The values indicate their representative hole mobilities. Lodge et al. also reported a P3HT thin-film EDL-OFET with an ion-gel gate-dielectric composed of P(VDF-HFP) and EMIM-TFSI.58 This EDL-OFET cell had a top-gate, bottom-contact structure with a special gate electrode made of a conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene), doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). This material was deposited on the ion gel by aerosol jet printing, to serve as the gate electrode. A high nFE of 1015 cm−2, an on/off current ratio of ∼105, and a high μpFE of 2.3 ± 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained.4.5 Carbon nanotubes and grapheneCarbon nanotubes and graphene are attractive materials in various research fields, owing to their excellent transport properties.161–166 They have already been extensively studied as thin-film transistors,167–173 chemical sensors,174–179 and transparent conductive coating-materials.180–184 They are also promising as building blocks for large-area electronics or macroelectronics, such as lightweight flexible displays.Takenobu et al. reported single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin-film FETs with an ionic-liquid gate-dielectrics in 2010.185,186 They produced top-gate, top-contact SWCNT-FETs by ink-jet printing on Si/SiO2 substrates, and used DEME-TFSI as the ionic-liquid gating. The μpFE and on/off ratio of the SiO2 gate-dielectric SWCNT-FETs are 7.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 17, respectively, while those of the ionic-liquid EDL-SWCNT-FETs are 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9, respectively. Though the on/off ratio of the EDL-SWCNT-FETs is similar to that of the SiO2-FETs, the operating voltage for the former was significantly reduced. Furthermore, they achieved a marked improvement in hysteretic response against gate voltages—0.15 and 47 V for the EDL- and SiO2-FETs, respectively—due to an efficient screening of charged impurities by the ionic liquid.Frisbie et al. fabricated a carbon-nanotube EDL-FET with a PS–PMMA–PS ion gel in EMIM-TFSI.187 The FET structure has a top-gate, bottom-contact configuration. Their devices exhibited an ambipolar transport with μpFE and μnFE of 50 and 40 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, on an SiO2 substrate. They also revealed the great potential of carbon-nanotubes for high performance flexible devices; the obtained mobilities were μpFE = 31 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μnFE = 17 cm2 V−1 s−1 on a high-density polyimide substrate, and μpFE = 9 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μnFE = 3 cm2 V−1 s−1 on a low-density one, respectively.Graphene is a sheet of sp2-bonded carbon atoms that are arranged into a honeycomb structure. This two-dimensional material has many unique properties with potential for important applications in electronic devices. Tao et al. reported a graphene EDL-FET in 2009.188 They utilized a top-gate, top-contact EDL-FET with ionic-liquid BMIM-PF6, and recorded a μpFE of 1200 cm2 V−1 s−1. Iwasa et al. applied the EDL-FET technique to a trilayer graphene in 2012.189 They fabricated a top-gate, bottom-contact EDL-FET with DEME-TFSI, and investigated the magnetotransport of the epitaxial trilayer graphene. It was found that the dephasing length and the spin relaxation length of carriers could be effectively modulated by gate bias. A weak antilocalization induced by the spin–orbit interaction was observed near the zero magnetic field, together with a crossover to localization.5. Controlling factors of mobility and threshold voltage in EDL-FETs with ionic liquidsMicroscopic analyses of EDL-FET operations can provide a guiding principle for desired EDL-FETs. In Section 5.1, we discuss the relationship between the carrier mobility and the capacitance of the gate insulator, which governs the performance of FETs. The high mobility EDL-FET can be applied to innovations in arithmetic processing. In addition, we will describe the ionic-liquid dependence of the performance of EDL-FETs, and discuss the borderline between electrochemical doping and physical carrier injection in Section 5.2.5.1 Mobility vs. capacitanceMobility is a crucial parameter to achieve high performance FETs, as well as operation voltage. Therefore it is important to identify a guiding principle to improve the mobility for future EDL-FETs with fast operation and low power consumption.Takeya et al. examined the dependence of the mobility on the capacitance of gate dielectrics by fabricating EDL-FETs with five imidazolium ionic-liquids: EMIM-FSI, EMIM-TFSI, EMIM-BETI, EMIM-BF4, and EMIM-DCA.54 Their devices have a PDMS stamp structure (see Scheme 4), on which a rubrene single crystal is electrostatically settled. It is found that the mobility decreases with an increase in the capacitance of the ionic-liquids, by a power of approximately −1.5. It is considered that the charge carriers accumulated electrostatically at the semiconductor surfaces suffer from polaronic self-localization due to an interaction with the polarizable gate dielectrics. This means the formation of Fröhlich polarons,190,191 which induces an electric field broadening at the semiconductor/dielectric interface and decreases the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy. This results in a reduction of hopping probability, and thus suppresses the carrier mobility.192,193 Though a larger ε of the gate dielectric is favorable for charge accumulation, it also reduces the carrier mobility due to self-localization.Zaumseil et al. analyzed the capacitance dependence of the mobility for a ZnO EDL-FET with eight ionic liquids: EMIM-TFSI, EMIM-TCB, EMIM-FAP, BMIM-TFSI, BMIM-FAP, HMIM-FAP, EMMIM-TFSI and BMMIM-TFSI.65 They also found that the mobility decreases with an increase in the capacitance of the ionic-liquids. Takenobu et al. examined the capacitance dependence of the mobility for the ambipolar EDL-FETs described in Section 4.3, and confirmed that both the hole and electron mobilities exhibited the same tendency.154We studied the capacitance dependence of the mobility of the octathio[8]circulene EDL-OFETs with six ionic liquids.53Fig. 10 shows the log–log plots between the μpFE and the capacitance CIL of ionic liquid measured at 0.1 Hz. There is a characteristic linear relationship between log μpFE and log CIL, with a gradient of −2.7 (dotted line). We pointed out that high-capacitance dielectric materials would reduce the effective electric field between the source and drain electrodes, and would reduce the charge carrier mobility, in addition to the dipolar disorder mechanism. Fig. 10  The log–log plots between μpFE and CIL at 0.1 Hz for the EDL-OFETs of octathio[8]circulene with six ionic-liquid gate-dielectrics: IL1, DEME-TFSI; IL2, DEME-BF4; IL3, BMIM-TFSI; IL4, BMIM-BF4; IL5, BMIM-OTf; IL6, BMIM-PF6.

However, if VG becomes very large, there should be an electrochemical process (reaction), that is characterized by an ion penetration into the semiconductor.140,150,194–200Scheme 5 schematically shows the electrostatic and electrochemical processes. In this section, we will review the works needed to understand these processes in EDL-FETs. Scheme 5  Electrostatic and electrochemical model of the thin film. V1 and V2 are applied voltages, which have the relationship of V1 < V2. Yuan et al. investigated the charging mechanisms in the EDL-FETs of an atomically-flat ZnO substrate with six ionic-liquids, DEME-TFSI, PP13-TFSI, TMPA-TFSI, AAIM-TFSI, AEM-TFSI and EMIM-TFSI.201 They succeeded in separating the accumulated total charge QT into the Faradaic charge QF and a mobile charge QH, namely QT = QF + QH, by combining the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the Hall effect measurements. QF is transferred through EDL interfaces by an electrosorption or surface redox process at the electrochemical interface, and can be accurately evaluated by the C–VG integration, where C is the capacitance. This is a new method for understanding the interface electrochemistry. The total electron density obtained by this method is 5.4 × 1014 cm−2 at 1 Hz, which agrees with the number of the mobile electrons obtained from the Hall measurements. This indicates the electrostatic nature of the interface charging, whereas the density is as high as 19 × 1014 cm−2 at 0.1 Hz under a VG of 3 V due to the accumulation of Faradaic charges. The electron density of the charges induced by electrochemistry can be confirmed by the difference between these two values, namely 13.6 × 1014 cm−2, which corresponds to 0.33 electrons per ZnO. It was concluded that the lowest frequency is 1 Hz for an electrostatic EDL polarization without a pseudocapacitance effect. This means that, when the frequency decreases to 1 Hz from a higher frequency, the EDL polarization relaxation becomes more sufficient. A temperature-frequency mapping of the EIS indicated a “phase diagram” between the electrostatic and electrochemical nature of such highly-charged EDL interfaces. This provides a perspective in electric-field-induced electronic phenomena, and a simple method to distinguish the electrostatic and electrochemical carrier injections in EDL-FETs.By using a three-electrode system consisting of working, counter and reference electrodes, we examined the solid-state electrochemistry and EDL-OFET performance of octathio[8]circulene, and discussed the relationship between the oxidation potential and EDL formation (see Scheme 5).141Fig. 11(a) shows the CV curves of a thin film (500 nm) of octathio[8]circulene in DEME-TFSI, where VC is the electrode potential versus the reference electrode (see Scheme 6). The first cycle (red curve) shows an oxidation peak above VC = 1.2 V, while the second cycle (black curve) and later cycles show a two-electron oxidation peak at VOX = 1.12 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and step-wise re-reduction peaks at VC = 0.90 and 0.75 V with good reproducibility. The in situ UV/vis/NIR absorption measurements supported these assignments.140 The number of reaction electrons per one molecule, n, was calculated to be 0.015, using the oxidation peak in the second cycle. This small value means that the electrochemical redox process occurs only at the surface of the thin-film. Fig. 11  (a) Cyclic voltammogram of a thin-film of octathio[8]circulene. (b) Transfer characteristics of the thin-film EDL-OFET with ionic-liquid DEME-TFSI. Adapted with permission from ref. 141. Copyright 2013 Elsevier.  Scheme 6  Schematic illustration of an EDL-FET consisting of a thin-film deposited on interdigitated array electrodes (Pt), and three electrodes, namely the working, counter and reference electrodes. We estimated the thickness of the oxidized layer, dOX, from the CV curves, using (5)where Q is the amount of charge calculated from the CV curve, VU is the unit cell volume, n is the number of molecules in the unit cell, n′ is the number of the reaction electrons per one molecule, e is the elementary charge, and A is the area of the thin film. It is found that dOX in the first scan is rather large (13 nm), but this is followed by a gradual, linear increase by 3–5 nm per scan after the second scan.Using the same apparatus shown in Scheme 6, we examined the EDL-OFET performance in the VC range between 0.0 and 1.1 V. Fig. 11(b) shows the transfer characteristics of the EDL-OFET with a scanning rate of 0.01 V s−1 at various source–drain voltages VD. The ID curves show significant increases below a threshold voltage of VthC = 0.5 V, indicating an EDL-OFET performance. This −VthC value is nearly half of the onset potential of the oxidation peak on the repeatable CV curve (the black curve in Fig. 11(a)). Since the penetration of the counter cations into the thin films is believed to start at the electrochemical onset potential, the difference between the threshold VC and the onset potential represents an effective carrier generation by the formation of EDLs on the surfaces of the thin films.Next, we performed a comparison of the electrochemical and electrostatic carrier injections into the octathio[8]circulene thin films. Fig. 12 shows the relationship between VthC and VOX, measured with six ionic liquids.53 There is an approximately linear relationship between them, indicating a strong correlation between the electrostatic and electrochemical hole injections in the thin films. It is noteworthy that the values of VthC and VOX for the ionic liquid DEME-TFSI are close to the corresponding ones of BMIM-TFSI, and the values for DEME-BF4 are very similar to those of BMIM-BF4. Here, DEME-TFSI and BMIM-TFSI have a common anion (TFSI), and DEME-BF4 and BMIM-BF4 both include BF4. This strongly suggests that the hole-doping carrier injection is governed only by the anions of the ionic liquids. Fig. 12 justifies this assumption; namely, it is only anions that form an EDL with holes in the thin films in the electrostatic process, and only anions that penetrate into the thin films in the electrochemical process. It is experimentally demonstrated that the order of carrier injection efficiency is BMIM-OTf > DEME-TFSI ≈ BMIM-TFSI > DEME-BF4 ≈ BMIM-BF4 > BMIM-PF6; namely, OTf > TFSI > BF4 > PF6. It can reasonably be considered that the polarizabilities of the former two are larger than those of the latter two, so that the former two anions would be adsorbed in greater number on the semiconductor interfaces, and would form larger EDLs, leading to more effective carrier injections. The difference between the two groups, (OTf, TFSI) and (BF4, PF6), can be rationalized by polarizability. Another possible factor is the size of the anions; TFSI is the largest, followed by OTf, PF6, and BF4 in this order. The electrostatic and electrochemical processes require a close contact between anions and the semiconductor, and the penetration of an anion into the semiconductor, respectively (see Fig. 11). The difference between OTf and TFSI, or between BF4 and PF6, could be explained by this size effect. These facts are relevant to the hard and soft acids and bases principle; the order of the degree of Lewis basicity for these anions is OTf > TFSI > BF4 > PF6,202 which can explain the relation discussed above. The DFT calculations (B3LYP/6-31+G(d)) for the HOMO energies of these anions also indicate a relation, OTf (−2.90 eV) > TFSI (−4.24 eV) > BF4 (−4.52 eV) > PF6 (−5.40 eV), so that it is also concluded that a high donor ability of the anion can stabilize a hole injection, leading to a low power operation.

Copyright 2013 American Chemical Society. 5.3 Electrochemical potentials of ionic liquidsAs described above, the threshold voltage VthC depends on the anion component of the ionic liquid in p-type OFETs. Furthermore, we also studied the threshold voltages VthG for the ambipolar MPc (M = Pb, TiO) EDL-OFETs, which are described in Section 4.3, using ten ionic liquids. We also found a significant dependence on the ionic liquids, but it was not governed by the anion components.153 To reveal what controls VthG, which is practically more important than VthC, we measured the electrochemical potentials, EWR, of the ionic liquids, which were determined as EWR = EW − ER,(6)where EW and ER are the potentials of the working and reference electrodes, respectively. EW is expressed as203–206 eEW = ΦW + e(ψW − ψS)ψ,(7)where ΦW is the work function of the working electrode and e(ψW–ψS) is the potential difference between the working electrode and the solution at the interface. ER is a standard value in electrochemical analysis. Therefore, EWR indicates the electrochemical potential of the solution, which includes the difference in contact potential between the working electrode and the solution, and the polarization effects. Fig. 13 shows the plots of the threshold voltages Vth,pG (hole) and Vth,nG (electron) vs. EWR for the PbPc and TiOPc transistors. It is clear that Vth,pG or Vth,nG exhibits a linear relation against EWR, for the two OFETs; it is likely that the EDL-OFET threshold voltages are regulated by the EWR of the ionic liquids. This indicates that both the electrochemical potential of the ionic liquid and the polarization at the interface would affect the carrier injection into the semiconductor.

Scheme 7 shows an energy level diagram for the frontier orbitals of PbPc and TiOPc, and the electrochemical potential of an ionic liquid. The orbital energies of the MPcs are calculated by the DFT method. The LUMO and HOMO levels of PbPc are higher by 0.2 eV than the corresponding levels for TiOPc, respectively. The ambipolar behaviors of the TiOPc and PbPc transistors indicate that the electrochemical potentials of the ionic liquids, ψS, are located in the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of these MPcs. Since the hole injections are easier than the electron injections in the PbPc and TiOPc EDL-OFETs, and the hole injection for PbPc is easier than that for TiOPc, the energy level of ψS is thought to be closer to the HOMO of PbPc and the LUMO of TiOPc, as shown in Scheme 7. It is easily concluded that the gate threshold voltages for the hole and electron injections are governed by the mutual relations among the HOMO and LUMO levels and the electrochemical potentials of the ionic liquids.

Subsequent device applicationsIn the previous sections, we reviewed various EDL-FETs and their operation mechanisms. In this section, we describe various applications of the EDL-FETs in the development of logic circuits and memory devices.6.1 InvertersThe inverter function is fundamental in advanced integrated circuits.207–209 When composed of EDL-FETs, inverters would be low power-device elements that could invert the output signals. Scheme 8(a) shows an inverter circuit composed of one FET and resistance. The combination of p- and n-type FET can form a complementary inverter, as shown in Scheme 8(b). This complementary technology leads to a lower power dissipation than the inverters based on a single transistor, because the power loss occurs only during the switching of input voltage between an on and off state. To create high-performance complementary inverters, matches in mobility and threshold voltage between p- and n-type semiconductors is important,210,211 as well as the individual performance of the component transistors. Scheme 8  Circuit configurations of a single component FET inverter (a) and a complementary FET inverter (b). Frisbie et al. reported a single-component EDL-FET inverter in 2008.159 This EDL-FET consists of a P3HT active-layer, and an ion-gel composed of PS–PEO–PS and EMIM-TFSI. A polyimide substrate and a carbon-ink resistor (20 kΩ) are used as inverter components. The inverter shows a switching rate in the range of 1–10 kHz, which is fast enough for various applications, such as electronic papers and distributed sensor arrays. The authors improved this technique, using a P3HT EDL-FET with a PS–PMMA–PS ion-gel gate-dielectric on a flexible poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) substrate.212 In these OFETs, they adopted a conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) as source, drain, and gate electrodes, instead of Au, to reduce costs. The switching took place at VIN = 0 V, and completed within only 0.5 V, showing a gain (dVIN/dVOUT) of as high as 7.We developed a complementary EDL-FET inverter, using thin films of porphyrazine materials, namely H2Pc and H2TTDPz, for p- and n-type semiconductors, respectively.143 These two porphyrazine-based OFETs exhibit nearly the same performance regarding the hole and electron mobility, as explained in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. The top-gate was prepared with a droplet of DEME-TFSI that covered the whole area of the thin films, and a Pt wire that was inserted into the ionic liquid. The transfer characteristics of the inverter are shown in Fig. 14. Although the supply voltage VIN is low, the signal-gain dVOUT/dVIN values are rather high, reaching 3 when VDD = 0.5 V. The static power dissipations are 1 nW and 50 nW for VDD = 0.1 V and 0.5 V, respectively. These characteristics indicate low power dissipation in the standby state.

We also studied the dynamic response, which can reveal the maximum operation frequency. The results at 1 Hz frequency with VDD = 0.5 V are shown in Fig. 15(a), where the black and red curves indicate the input voltage VIN and output voltage VOUT, respectively. The rising time tr and the falling time tf of VOUT are obtained as 45 and 60 ms, respectively. Fig. 15(b) confirms that the inverter performance can be maintained up to 20 Hz, and the data in this figure show good agreement with the values of tr and tf. The upper limit of the fast response (20 Hz) could be governed by the diffusion limit of the ionic molecules in the gate dielectric liquid. Fig. 15  (a) The dynamic response characteristics of a complementary EDL-OFET inverter measured under a 1.0 V peak-to-peak square input signal at 1 Hz frequency with VDD = 0.5 V.

Copyright 2013 Royal Society of Chemistry. A complementary EDL-FET was prepared by Frisbie et al. using the ambipolar carbon-nanotube EDL-FETs shown in Section 4.5.187 This inverter on polyimide switches sharply at the threshold voltage, and achieves a gain of as high as 58. They studied the dynamic responses of the inverters printed on polyimide and SiO2 substrates, respectively. For a 1 kHz input square-wave signal, the output swing reached ∼1 V at VDD = 1.5 V. The fasted responses were 5 kHz for polyimide, and 50 kHz for SiO2. They also fabricated a five-stage ring oscillator and NAND logic gate devices, which allow low voltage operations.6.2 Dual-gate EDL-FETsVarious device structures of FETs have been investigated. Among these, dual-gate FETs are promising; the operation of these devices features independent control of the two gate biases to optimize the device performance and to decrease the bias voltage of each side.213 Even though this operation mechanism is useful, its application to organic FETs has been very limited.214,215Scheme 9 illustrates the structure of a dual-gate EDL-OFET. It is expected that the FET performance with single back-gate operation would be significantly improved by a top-gate voltage. Scheme 9  A dual-gate EDL-OFET consisting of an organic semiconductor and an ionic-liquid gate-dielectric. In 2006, Takeya et al. reported a dual-gate transistor of a rubrene single crystal, in which the top gate dielectric is a polymer gel of polyethylene glycol and LiClO4, dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and the bottom gate is SiO2.216 The transfer characteristics obtained by bottom-gate sweeps under various top-gate voltages clearly indicated a dual-gate operation. A comparison with the transfer characteristics of simple bottom-gate SiO2 FETs indicates that the EDL-operated mobility is similar to that of the SiO2-gate operation, indicating that the quality of the interface is well preserved when it is attached to the polymer gel electrolyte.We developed a dual-gate transistor using octathio[8]circulene thin-film and an ionic-liquid gate-dielectric.217 The top-gate was prepared with a droplet of DEME-TFSI that covered the whole area of the thin film, and a Pt wire that was inserted into the ionic liquid. Fig. 16(a) shows the transfer characteristic operated by the bottom-gate voltage VBG, namely, the |ID| versus VBG plots, under a constant VTG in the range from 0.0 to −0.4 V at a source–drain voltage of VD = −0.5 V and VTG = 0.0 V. When a negative VTG was loaded, we observed a significant improvement in the transistor performance, even when VTG > VthTG (= −0.5 V). These results indicate that VTG produces an effective field at the interface of the SiO2 bottom gate-dielectrics and assists with carrier doping from this gate. Fig. 16(b) shows the |ID| versus VBG plots in the range of −0.4 > VTG > −1.0 V at VD = −0.5 V. The surface condition of the thin film is considered to be significantly changed when VTG < −0.5 V. This phenomenon is probably caused by penetration and/or adsorption of the counter ions on the thin film surface, which brings about a significant increase in the off-current, thus spoiling the transistor performance. Fig. 17 shows the dependence of VthBG on VTG. There is a linear relationship between them, with a slope of −3.2. In general, the dual-gate transistors show a relationship between VthBG and VTG, which is expressed by218 (8)where CTG, CBG, and C are the capacitances of the top- and bottom-gate dielectrics and the semiconductor, respectively. Therefore, the symmetric dual-gate OFETs, composed of the same gate dielectrics, should exhibit a dVthBG/dVTG value of approximately −0.5. In contrast, the values of CBG and CTG in the present dual-gate OFET are 1.1 × 10−8 F cm−2 and 1.1 × 10−6 F cm−2, respectively. Since C of the organic layer is estimated to be 10−7 F cm−2, the dVthBG/dVTG value would be on the order of tens, which can semiquantitatively explain the observed value. Fig. 16  VTG dependence of the transfer characteristics of the dual-gate OFET of octathio[8]circulene, operated by the bottom-gate voltage VBG, in the range of (a) VTG = 0.0 to −0.4 V and (b) −0.4 to −1.0 V.

In 2012, Maehashi et al. reported a graphene dual-gate EDL-FET which they developed to create a band gap in bilayer graphene.219 The drain current of graphene-channel FETs cannot be switched off, due to the zero band-gap nature of graphene. Thus, it is necessary to create a band gap to realize the transistor performance. Since the dual-gate structure can induce a band-gap in graphene, leading to a high on/off ratio, the authors adopted the dual-gate technique, using an ionic liquid as a top gate and SiO2 as a bottom gate. Electrical measurements revealed that the resistance of the bilayer graphene FETs monotonically increases with increasing electric field, though that of the mono- and tri-layer graphene FETs was nearly constant. This means that a band gap formed in the bilayer graphene, but not in the other graphenes. The gap width was estimated as 235 meV for bilayer graphene at an ionic-gate-voltage of −3.0 V.6.3 MiscellaneousMemory devices are fundamental elements for various applications.220–222 Among them, proton memories have offered an attractive alternative for ultradense, nonvolatile data storage by taking advantage of the lower programmed voltages.223,224 Iwasa et al. reported new functions of the EDL-FETs, including surface atom recognition and proton memory performance, by introducing a protic ionic-liquid gate-dielectric to ZnO EDL-FETs in 2012.225 Since small and chemically-active ions, such as protons and hydroxyls, can serve as an adsorption medium to expand the interfacial functions of FETs, they fabricated a top-gate, bottom-contact EDL-FET with a protic ionic-liquid, which was prepared from neat DEME-TFSI by doping a small amount of a weak Brønsted acid, H2O. It was found that the transfer characteristics from the ZnO–O surface exhibit a large hysteresis loop over 3 V against a VG scan due to (ZnO–O)–Had bonding, while the ZnO–Zn surface does not exhibit remarkable hysteresis. Since the (ZnO–O)–Had bonding is thermodynamically stable, a large desorption activation energy, namely, a large negative VG, is required to remove the adsorbed protons from the ZnO surface, causing this large hysteresis in the transfer characteristics. Such a large hysteresis in the transfer characteristics is useful for nonvolatile memory devices via surface hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes. It is also demonstrated that “WRITE” and “ERASE” actions take place within 0.5 s in a nonvolatile memory of the protic ionic-liquid EDL-FETs with triangle-shaped gate bias scanning.The single-molecule transistor is an attractive concept for future molecular electronics; in this transistor, a single molecule bridges the distance between two terminals. The electronic state of the bridge molecule is controlled by the gate bias of a third electrode.226–228 Nichols et al. reported a single-molecule EDL-FET of pyrrolo-tetrathiafulvalene (pTTF), incorporated in a molecule, 6pTTF6 (see Fig. 18), and an ionic-liquid BMIM-OTf in 2012.229 The conductance of 6pTTF6 showed an increase according to the two redox transitions during electrochemical reactions, and both conventional and 2-D conductance histograms were made. An increase in the single-molecule conductance of 6pTTF6 from ∼0.5 to ∼2 nS was observed, and the total reorganization free energy λreorg was estimated to be ∼1.2 eV for both redox transitions in BMIM-OTf. This work shows some of the advantages of using an ionic liquid as a medium for single-molecule conductance measurements, with the wider electrochemical potential window being especially advantageous.

Conclusion and remarksHerein, we addressed the fundamentals and practical applications of EDL-FETs with ionic-liquid gate dielectrics. Though most of the conventional solvents are volatile and undergo denaturation in air, and thus present crucial problems during practical use, the non-volatility and air stability of ionic liquids have opened a new stage in the sciences and technologies related to solutions and liquids. In addition, the formation of EDLs at the interfaces between ionic liquids and solids can produce extremely large potential gradients, inducing large charge accumulations. Therefore, the ionic liquids are applicable to materials research on electronic, magnetic and superconductive materials.The EDL-FET method is an excellent methodology to achieve high charge injection at solid/liquid interfaces, and enables the development of flexible devices and their low-power operation. The method would also be applicable to fundamental research exploring superconductivity, ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity and chemical reactions. While we reviewed recent advances in ionic-liquid EDL-FETs in the present paper, ionic liquids also have various potential applications in chemical and biochemical sensors,230–232 nanocarbon science,233,234 and ITO-free optoelectronic conversions with high internal quantum efficiency and responsivity.235,236 The analysis of ionic liquid dependence has thus improved our fundamental understanding of the factors controlling mobility, threshold voltage, etc., and this knowledge is in turn expected to improve the performance of EDL-FETs and open a new stage of flexible organic electronics.8.
