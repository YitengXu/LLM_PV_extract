    , Accepted 25th September 2019First published on 25th September 2019AbstractBuilding flexible asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) with high-capacitance, high energy density and a super long life will contribute to the development of new energy storage devices in the future. Although ASCs possess a higher energy density than symmetric supercapacitors (SCs), however, lifespan is effectively degraded during the long-term cycling process. Herein, we demonstrate a high-performance all-solid-state flexible ASC based on battery-type bimetallic oxide (ZnCo2O4) nano-polyhedra supported on carbon fibre textiles (ZCO@CFT) as the cathode and capacitive-type layer structured Ti3C2Tx-MXene as the anode materials. Before assembling the ASC, both electrodes were systematically investigated in aqueous electrolyte and their performance optimized. The ZCO@CFT cathode exhibits high pseudocapacitive charge storage (∼63.22%) with a specific capacitance of 2643.66 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and Ti3C2Tx-MXene supported on carbon fibre textile (MXene@CFT) exhibits a high specific capacitance of 474.23 F g−1 at 1.5 A g−1 with remarkable cycling stabilities >95%. Furthermore, the ASCs were fabricated using ZCO@CFT as the cathode and MXene@CFT as the anode, (denoted as ZCO‖MXene-ASC) to check the feasibility of the proposed design. The ZCO‖MXene-ASC shows excellent energy storage properties by achieving a high capacitance of 281.25 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, a highly competitive energy density of 99.94 W h kg−1 at an admirable power density of 800 W kg−1 with a good life-time >94% over 5000 cycles and flexibility. According to the best of our knowledge, the achieved energy density of ZCO‖MXene-ASC is very competitive, and the highest among all binary metal oxides, carbonaceous materials, and MXene-based SCs and ASCs to date. Our concept of employing 3D bimetallic-oxides and 2D Ti3C2Tx-MXene could open up a new direction in the development of high-performance flexible energy storage devices.
1. Introduction
Several technologies that produce electrical energy from renewable resources (e.g. solar, wind, hydropower, fuel cells, etc.) have been gradually realized to overcome the energy demand of the modern age.1,2 However, the supply of energy from renewable resources is discontinuous, and since the usage of electricity fluctuates independently, this leads to a continuous mismatch between supply and demand. Furthermore, the intense development in flexible, wearable microelectronics such as micro-robots and micro-sensors has dramatically enhanced the utilization of electrochemical energy storage devices.3 Recently, supercapacitors (SCs) have been highly acknowledged as competitive energy storage units with the extraordinary merits of quick charge–discharge rates, prolonged lifetime and excellent safety.4 Significant efforts have been focused on enhancing the performance of SCs, either using high-capacity pseudocapacitive materials or asymmetric design of SCs. Categorically, SCs can be classified into two types based on electrochemical processes: ion adsorption/desorption and the faradic redox reaction process. The latter is a battery-like device with high-capacity/energy, usually utilizing the multiple-redox states of transition metal oxides, and is called a faradic pseudocapacitor.5 However, due to the intrinsic limitations of the conventional bulk-electrode materials, both the volumetric and areal energy densities for most reported ASCs still fail to meet commercial demands. Among transition metal-oxides, cobalt oxide has attracted considerable attention in energy conversion and storage devices in recent years; however, due to low conductivity and active site exposure, it is not ideal for practical applications.2 Electrochemical energy storage in metal oxides mainly depends on the surface area and oxidation states. The electrical conductivity of binary metal oxides is reportedly twice that of single oxides.6 Therefore Zn-based binary metal oxides with high conductivity, low cost and less toxicity, are excellent candidates for high-capacitance ASCs.4,5 Further, nano-engineering and surface/interface modifications can enhance the performance of these materials due to their promising electrical properties. However, the potential windows of symmetric SCs are limited (<1.2 V), and their capacities also fade rapidly under high current density. In contrast, the design of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) offers an attractive approach to extend the potential windows by merging two different voltage window-based electrode materials, which enables the ASC to operate at a relatively high potential range compared with symmetric SCs. Therefore, the investigation of both positive and negative pseudocapacitive electrode materials with enhanced performance for ASCs is a hot research field across the world. Up to now, massive research has been devoted to investigating positive pseudocapacitive materials and less attention has been paid to explore negative electrode materials as alternatives to carbonaceous materials.7 Most famous negative electrodes are made from carbonaceous materials (carbon/graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc.) and have been extensively used with pseudocapacitive materials (metal oxides, hydroxides, conducting polymers, etc.) as a positive electrode for assembling ASCs.8 However, the energy density of ASCs based on carbon-based negative electrode materials is limited due to the low specific capacitance of the carbonaceous materials. On the other hand, only few materials were investigated as a negative electrode except for carbon, such as iron- and vanadium-based materials.9,10 However, the stability of these materials is inferior during long-term cycling tests under high working potentials. At the same time, the properties of negative and positive electrode materials should be carefully matched to achieve desirable electrochemical performance. Therefore, to investigate new negative electrode materials with high capacitance and excellent cycling stability is highly desirable to build high energy density ASCs.
Recently, 2D transition metal carbides/nitrides (denoted as MXene) have been regarded as highly promising emerging materials for energy storage devices due to their high electrical conductivities (up to 1000 S cm−1) depending on the synthesis methods, surface hydrophilicity and easily tunable properties compared to carbon/graphene.11 Generally, the synthesis of MXenes involves selective etching of the A-element (Al, Ga, Si, etc.) from the MAX (Mn+1AXn) phase using hydrofluoric acid, where M denotes transition metal atoms, X is carbon and n is the number of layers (1, 2 or 3).11,12 Specifically, up till now, the most studied MXene has been titanium carbide Ti3C2Tx (Tx denotes the surface groups such as –F, –O, and –OH). These additional functional groups have led to a high gravimetric/volumetric capacitance when present in an SC electrode in aqueous electrolyte, providing excellent stability.12 However, in a symmetrical combination of SCs based on Ti3C2Tx restricted potential windows (<1 V) have been revealed due to oxidation of Ti3C2Tx at higher anodic potentials.12,13 Recently, Jiang et al. demonstrated a successful attempt to combine Ti3C2Tx-MXene with highly capacitive RuO2 for ASC, which shows good electrochemical performance and cycling stability.14 Similarly, Li et al. also reported hydrous RuO2-decorated Ti3C2Tx-MXene for printed micro-SCs, which exhibits excellent performance.15 Furthermore, Ti3C2Tx-MXene can work better in negative potential windows for SCs in basic electrolytes.16 It would therefore be interesting if Ti3C2Tx-MXene was combined with low cast and highly pseudocapacitive positive materials such as ZnCo2O4 with a micro/nano morphology to improve the energy density with enhanced cyclic stability.
To demonstrate our concept, we chose binary metal oxide (ZnCo2O4) microspheres directly grown on carbon fibre textile (ZCO@CFT) as a flexible pseudocapacitive positive electrode and Ti3C2Tx-MXene as a negative electrode. The as-fabricated ZCO@CFT electrode displays a high specific capacitance of 2643.66 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and Ti3C2Tx-MXene supported on carbon fibre textile (MXene@CFT) exhibits a specific capacitance of 474.23 F g−1 at 1.5 A g−1 with excellent cycling stability >95% for both electrodes in aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore, ASCs were fabricated using ZCO@CFT as the cathode and MXene@CFT as the anode, (denoted as ZCO‖MXene-ASC) to check the feasibility of the proposed design. The ZCO‖MXene-ASC depicted excellent energy storage properties by achieving a high capacitance of 281.25 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, a highly competitive energy density of 99.94 W h kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1 with a good life-time >94% after 5000 cycles. This ZCO‖MXene-ASC employing 3D bimetallic oxides and 2D metal carbides could open up a new direction in the development of high performance energy storage devices.
2. Results and discussion
Inspired by the superiority of mesoporous structures, herein, we report the direct formation of ZnCo2O4 mesoporous microspheres assembled by nano-polyhedra on a flexible carbon fibre textile (CFT) via a facile hydrothermal synthesis and thermal decomposition method as schematically designed in Scheme 1. Ethylene glycol (EG) is a suitable solvent, which possesses good coordination ability and serves to align to form coordination complexes with metal cations (Zn and Co) during the hydrothermal process. The interconnected glycolates further aggregated by heating into microspheres at appropriate conditions, driven by the minimization of interfacial energy. Owing to the release of the various gases during the thermal treatment, finally, the porous structures were effectively obtained.

The general morphologies of the pristine CFT, ZCO@CFT bimetallic microspheres assembled from nano-polyhedra and at various concentrations of Zn/Co are presented in Fig. 1 and S1A–D,† respectively. Fig. 1A shows the low magnification FESEM image of the pristine CFT; these carbon fibers interlink with each other to form a 3D-conductive network configuration with a rough texture, which is highly favorable for the direct growth of nanomaterials. Fig. 1B and C provides the low-resolution FESEM image of ZCO@CFT; it can be seen that microspheres are uniformly grown on carbon fibers. Fig. 1D exhibits a selected area of Fig. 1C, which shows the high-magnification image of the microspheres and provides detailed morphological aspects of the as-prepared product and confirms the regular distribution of the hierarchical polyhedra. Interestingly, the average size of the polyhedra is about 200 nm and they make a 3D structure, as shown in Fig. 1E. A further high-resolution TEM image confirms the formation of the solid polyhedra and the precise lattice spacing of 0.3 nm matches well with the 220 planes of the standard ZnCo2O4 spinel phase (Fig. 1F). Such a 3D microstructure assembled with hierarchical nano-units can mainly facilitate the efficient diffusion of electrolyte ions as well as excellent electron transportation.17

(F) Corresponding TEM image (inset shows the HRTEM image with lattice fringes of 0.3 nm belonging to the 220 plane of spinel phase ZnCo2O4). 
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the ZCO microspheres was determined by recording a N2-adsorption/desorption isotherm, as shown in Fig. S2A,† exhibiting a BET surface area of as high as 84 m2 g−1. The shape of the loop matches a typical type-IV isotherm, confirming the mesoporous properties of the ZCO microspheres. The pore size distribution of the ZCO microspheres was calculated from the desorption data using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model, which shows a sharp peak centered at 13.87 and a less intense peak at 24.51 nm, confirming a hierarchical mesoporous structure, as shown in Fig. S2B.†
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to identify what material is grown on the CFT. Fig. 2A shows the XRD peaks data of ZCO@CFT, which signify the spinel phase ZnCo2O4 (PDF: 23-1390) anchored on the surface of CFT. The sharp peaks without any single Co/Zn-metal related peaks indicate that this material has good crystalline features with high-purity. The border peak appearing at ∼26° of 2θ belongs to the CFT with weak intensity as compared to other peaks from ZnCo2O4, signifying that the ZCO product is well-dispersed on the surface of CFT. Therefore, it was confirmed that the synthesized material is zinc-cobaltite with good crystallinity.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was recorded and fitted to explore the oxidation states and to gain more insight into the valence states of Zn/Co. The full scan survey of the ZCO@CFT electrode is presented in Fig. 2B, in which only signals of Zn, Co, O and C are observed with no other peaks from foreign elements, demonstrating the high purity of the sample. The high-magnification Co 2p spectrum was fitted to inspect the electronic states of the Co-atoms with multiple valances, as shown in Fig. 2C. The peaks located at 780.21 and 781.45 eV with shake-up satellites (denoted as Sat.) are ascribed to the Co3+ and Co2+ states in the ZCO@CFT sample, respectively. The relative intensities values for the Co3+ and Co2+ peaks were employed to calculate the atomic ratio between Co3+/Co2+ on the surface of the ZCO@CFT electrode, which is as high as 1.52, indicating the high content of Co3+ in ZCO.18 The high-magnification Zn 2p spectrum can be fitted with two typical peaks of Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 with a spinning energy gap of 1021.50 eV, demonstrating the Zn2+ valence state of the Zn-atoms in the ZCO@CFT electrode4 (Fig. 2D). During the direct synthesis of active materials on flexible substrates, the connection between the material and substrates plays a significant role. Bonds of energetic materials with a flexible-substrate should be very strong to prevent detachment during the process of charging–discharging as well as bending performance. To improve the adhesion, functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are essential.19 The peaks belonging to CO bonds can be observed in both the fitted spectra of C 1s and O 1s, as shown in Fig. 2E and F, respectively. However, the strength of the CO bond is not strong enough as compared to the C–O bond in the O 1s spectrum. Furthermore, the bond appearing at 290.9 eV can be assigned to the O–CO bond, which is attached to the surface of the CFT substrate with the CO bond. These functional groups significantly enhance the adhesive properties of the ZCO and CFT and improve the electrochemical performance as well as the flexible nature of the electrode.20
The electrochemical performance of the ZCO@CFT electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and a galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) test in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte using a three-electrode system. Fig. 3A shows the CV curves of the optimized concentration of the Zn/Co (Fig. S3†) based ZCO@CFT electrode recorded at various scan rates ranging from 1 to 100 mV s−1. The shape of the CV curves is obviously distinguished from the electrochemical double-layer capacitors, which demonstrates the strong pseudocapacitive characteristics of ZCO. It is worth mentioning that two pairs of distinct reversible redox peaks are observed in each CV curve. However, only one pair of enlarged redox peaks is observed at high scan rates, which is due to the superposition of the peaks. In this regard, the CV curves at low scan rates (5 and 10 mV s−1) are presented in Fig. S3,† where we can clearly observe two distinct pairs of redox peaks, indicating the occurrence of pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism with good reversibility.5 The first pair of redox peaks P1/P2 appearing at 0.40/0.32 V corresponds to the conversion between Co2+/Co3+, while the second redox couple P3/P4 appearing at 0.47/0.36 V corresponds to the conversion between Co3+/Co4+,21 as shown in Fig. S4.† It should be noted that, from our observation by XPS analysis (Fig. S5†) as well as from previous literature, the zinc remains in the Zn2+ state and is not involved in redox reactions;22,23 thus, the corresponding faradic redox reactions can be described as follows:21–24 Co3O4 + OH− + H2O ↔ 3CoOOH + e−(1) CoOOH + OH− ↔ CoO2 + H2O + e−(2)

The anodic and cathodic peaks for the above redox reactions are very close to each other at high scan rates, similar to those previously reported. In addition, the electrochemical response current increases with increasing scan rate, while the shape of the CV curves remain similar with a slight shift of the peak positions to higher potentials, signifying the excellent electrochemical reversibility and high-rate performance of the ZCO@CFT electrode. Furthermore, the symmetric center distribution of the CV curves with a high current response even at low scan rates signifies excellent electrical conductivity, which is the result of the binder/additive-free nature of the ZCO@CFT electrode. When the scan rate gradually declines, the redox peaks become more prominent, indicating the adequate valence change with partial diffusion kinetics behaviour.25 The GCD curves of the ZCO@CFT electrode were examined at the same voltage as the CV curves by applying the various current densities, as shown in Fig. 3B. The symmetrical GCD curves with pseudocapacitive characteristics indicate the good coulombic efficiency of >90% at all current densities, which proves the excellent reversibility of the ZCO@CFT electrode in aqueous electrolyte.26 The well-preserved shape of the GCD curves at low current densities reflects the enhanced rate capability and is in good agreement with the CV analysis. The specific capacitance was computed based on the data obtained from the GCD profiles and the results are demonstrated in Fig. 3C. The ZCO@CFT electrode exhibits an admirably high specific capacitance (per mass of the active material ∼1.3 mg cm−2) of 2643.66, 2166.52, 1680 and 1410 F g−1 at 2, 5, 12 and 40 A g−1, respectively (calculation details can be found in the ESI†). Interestingly, the ZCO@CFT electrode demonstrates an excellent rate capability of 53.34% at 20 times the higher current density (40 A g−1) as compared to the initial value (2 A g−1). The rate capability of the ZCO@CFT electrode is quite impressive as compared with other recently reported work on bimetallic oxides, such as ZnCo2O4 nanoflakes (100% at 1 A g−1 and 32.17% at 16 A g−1),27 ZnCo2O4 flowers (100% at 1 A g−1 and 43.45% at 16 A g−1),27 Au@rGO–ZnCo2O4 (100% at 2 mV s−1 and 26% at 50 mV s−1),28 ZnCo2O4 nanostructures (100% at 1 A g−1 and 62.78% at 10 A g−1, 100% at 10 mV s−1 and 48.47% at 50 mV s−1),29,30 ZnCo2O4 nanowires (100% at 4 mA cm−2 and 49% at 32 mA cm−2),31 ZnCo2O4@ZnWO4 (100% at 4 mA cm−2 and 51.49% at 32 mA cm−2),31 ZnCo2O4/ZnO composites (100% at 1 A g−1 and 69.6% at 15 A g−1),32 3D-ZnMoO4 (100% at 2 mA cm−2 and 38.5% at 20 mA cm−2)33 carbon coated hetero-MnCo2S4/CoS1.097 (100% at 1 A g−1 and 48% at 10 A g−1),34 and NiCo2O4 nanosheets (100% at 1 A g−1 and 66.66% at 10 A g−1).35 To find the origin of a high performance binder-free ZCO@CFT electrode, charge storage kinetics analysis such as the power law and quantification of capacitive and diffusion controlled charge storage was performed. The logarithmic relationship of the scan rate dependent current response for the ZCO@CFT electrode is calculated at fixed potential values of 0.25 and 0.45 V for the cathodic and anodic peaks36 according to eqn (1) (Fig. 3D): i = αvβ(3)where, i, v, α and β are the current density, scan rate and arbitrary constants. If the value of β approaches 0.5, the charge storage process is purely semi-definite diffusion-controlled, and if the value of β approaches 1.0, the charge storage process is capacitive.26 The value of β can be estimated from log(v) vs. log(i) (Fig. 3D). After linear fitting, the β-values were 0.85 and 0.77 for the anodic and cathodic peaks, respectively. The b-values are more close to unity compared to 0.5, signifying that the capacitive charge storage is dominant in the ZCO@CFT electrode. However, we cannot say it is truly capacitive; therefore, this kind of storage can be regarded as pseudocapacitive charge storage. Furthermore, based on eqn (2), quantitatively distinguishing the pseudocapacitive and diffusion controlled contributions from the total stored charge can be calculated as follows:20,21 (4)where i(V) is the potential dependent current density, the term pv represents the pseudocapacitive contribution and  represents the semi-infinite diffusion-controlled contributions. The values of the p and q constants can be calculated from the y-intercept and the slope of the “” plot, respectively, as shown in Fig. S6.† These charge storage contributions were analyzed at various scan rates (1–100 mV s−1), as shown in Fig. 3E, and it was found that the ZCO@CFT electrode exhibits excellent pseudocapacitive storage (43.46%) even at an extremely low scan rate of 1 mV s−1 and increases with the scan rate. The typical capacitive (shaded region ∼63.22%) and diffusion contributions (unshaded region ∼56.54%) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 3F. The pseudocapacitive charge storage nature was further investigated by analyzing the ex situ XPS spectra of ZCO@CFT after running for 100 cycles at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. As can be seen from Fig. S5A,† the peak of Co 2p3/2 can be deconvoluted to three counter peaks centered at 779.86, 781.50 and 782.05 eV corresponding to the Co4+, Co3+ and Co2+, respectively. On the other hand, zinc remains the same in the Zn2+ state after 100 cycles Fig. S5B,† which shows that Zn is not involved in the redox reaction of the ZCO@CFT electrode and agrees with the literature.4 Based on the XPS analysis, the electrochemical process of the ZCO@CFT electrode is due to the redox reaction of Co2+/Co3+ and Co3+/Co4+. Therefore, it is concluded that the charge storage in the ZCO@CFT electrode is dominated by pseudocapacitive features rather than that of the electric double layer capacitive behavior, which is responsible for the ultra-fast and high energy density in the ZCO@CFT electrode.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to obtain further insights into the high performance of the ZCO@CFT electrode and the corresponding Nyquist plot with fitting of the electrical equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 3G. The total impedance of the electrochemical process can be represented by four elements: intrinsic and ionic resistance of the electrolyte (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), Warburg impedance (Zw) and constant phase element (Q),37 as shown in the upper inset of Fig. 3G. According to the fitting analysis, the ZCO@CFT electrode possesses shallow values for Rs ∼ 0.89 Ω and Rct ∼ 0.78 Ω. The high slope at the low-frequency range indicates the excellent electrolytic ion diffusion with small resistance. This outstanding electrochemical activity of ZCO@CFT electrode can be attributed to the high-surface-area of microspheres assembled by nano units, which allows the easy diffusion of electrolyte ions through open spaces between nano-polyhedra.
The cycling stability is another main parameter for characterizing the SC electrode. Usually, it is observed that the SC electrodes collapse at high current densities during cycling stability tests and exhibit good stability relatively at low current densities. Therefore, to evaluate the performance for high-rate applications, the ZCO@CFT electrode was tested for 5000 GCD cycles at a high current density of 25 A g−1, and impressively it retained a 96.54% capacitance of the initial value with a good coulombic efficiency of >94% as shown in Fig. 3H.
To further investigate the potential applications of ZCO@CFT as a full energy storage device, an all-solid-state flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was fabricated using ZCO@CFT as the cathode and Ti3C2Tx-MXene supported on FCT (MXene@CFT) as the anode and denoted (ZCO‖MXene-ASC). Prior to assembling the ZCO‖MXene-ASC, detailed physical characterizations and electrochemical performance of MXene@CFT as the anode material was investigated in aqueous electrolyte.
The FESEM image of the Al-layer etched Ti3C2Tx is displayed in Fig. 4A. The inset of Fig. 4A shows the high-resolution FESEM image of the MAX phase of Ti3AlC2. It can be seen that the MAX phase of Ti3AlC2 was successfully etched to become the typical layer structured MXene after treating it in LiF/HCl.38 The structural characteristics of Ti3AlC2 were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the XRD patterns of the MAX phase and exfoliated Ti3C2Tx are shown in Fig. 4B. The LiF/HCl etching resulted in a significant loss in crystallinity and structural distortion, which is demonstrated by the weak diffraction peaks as compared with the MAX phase. Most importantly, the (002) peak at ∼9.55° shifted to a lower angle ∼9.17° and broadened as compared to its original state in the MAX phase due to the exfoliation process and substitution of Al– with –F and –OH/O terminating groups, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4B. The shifting of the peak position to a lower angle signifies the increase in the c-lattice parameter and is in good agreement with the previous literature.39 To acquire more insights about the surface chemistry of the MXene, we performed XPS analysis and the obtained results are demonstrated in Fig. 4C–F. The full scan survey shows strong signals for the Ti, C, O, F and N elements and no presence of Al was found (Fig. S7†). Fig. 4C shows the deconvoluted spectrum of the Ti 2p region, which possesses peak components corresponding to Ti bound with C and Ti2+, Ti3+, Ti4+ and Ti bound with F. The multiple oxidation states of Ti confirm that the termination surface of MXene is not uniform but supports the formation of mixed oxides (TiOxFy) and carboxides (TiCxOy).40 The deconvoluted spectrum of the C 1s region (Fig. 4D) reveals four peaks at 281.67, 284.74, 287.12 and 289.2 eV, which originate from Ti–C, C–C, C–O and O–CO, respectively. The occurrence of the C–O bond is due to the oxidation of MXene, which results in the formation of TiO2 and carbon networks. The O 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into two main peaks and confirms the formation of the Ti4+ state and the presence of –OH/Ox groups,40 which appear on the surface of MXene, as shown in Fig. 4E. The F 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into two main peaks, which correspond to the Ti–F and Al–F signals which further give confirmation of F groups as a result of LiF etching, as shown in Fig. 4F. In summary, XPS analysis comprehensively clarified the existence of functional groups and surface composition, which signify the variation and complexity in the chemistry of the Ti3C2Tx MXene.

The CV curves of the MXene@CFT electrode in a potential range of −1.0–0.0 V at various scan rates (5–50 mV s−1) in 1 M KOH electrolyte are shown in Fig. 5A. A pair of weak redox peaks are observed at −0.34 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for the cathodic scan and at 0.47 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for the cathodic scan in all CV curves. This implies that the capacitance partially comes from pseudocapacity associated with reversible intercalation/de-intercalation of the electrolyte ions along with a change in the Ti oxidation states and is also due to electric double layer capacitance. The pair of redox peaks possibly originates from the alternating adsorption and desorption of functional groups (–OH/Ox) on the surface of Ti3C3Tx-Mxene with –OH in the KOH electrolyte. The pair of redox peaks can be ascribed to the following reversible redox reactions:15,41,42 Ti3C2(OH)x + OH− ↔ Ti3C2(OH)x+1 + e−(5) Ti3C2Oy + 2OH− ↔ Ti3C2Oy+1 + e− + H2O(6)

The occurrence of a weak pair of redox peaks of Ti3C3Tx-Mxene in KOH electrolyte was also observed by Guo et al.41 The shape of the CV curves remains the same while the current response increases with scan rates, indicating the good reversibility of the electrode with high stability.
To further understand the charge storage mechanism of the MXene@CFT electrode, sweep analysis was performed at various scan rates to study the pseudocapacitive intercalation and capacitive charge storage contributions. The measured currents from CV curves at −0.3 V and 0.7 V for the anodic and cathodic scans obey the power law relationship with scan rate and can be expressed according to eqn (3), as shown in Fig. 5B. The calculated β-values for the anodic and cathodic peaks are 0.85 and 0.89, which indicate that a large amount of charge storage is contributed from the capacitive process while partially contributed from pseudocapacitive intercalation, and this is in good agreement with previous reports on the Ti3C3Tx-MXene electrode.43 These two types of charge storage mechanisms can further distinguish and quantify the capacitive contribution to the overall current response according to eqn (4) by calculating the values of the constants (Fig. S8†). The charge storage ratios at various scan rates are presented in a bar graph, which indicates that the capacitive charge storage is dominant in a wide range of scan rates (5–50 mV s−1) and even at the lowest scan rate of 5 mV s−1, it possesses 83% of capacitive and 17% intercalation pseudocapacitive contribution, as shown in Fig. 5C. Typically, at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1, the charge storage through the capacitive process is 92% (shaded area) and through the intercalation process is 8%, as depicted in Fig. 5D. According to the charge kinetic analysis, we concluded that the enhanced electrochemical performance of the MXene@CFT electrode is attributed to the additional functional groups and redox reactions at the surface of MXene along with various oxidation states, which lead to the high capacitance.
Further, GCD tests were carried out in the same potential range as CV profiles at various current densities, and the corresponding GCD profiles are shown in Fig. 5E. The GCD profiles are well-matched with CV analysis by showing a similar track of intercalation pseudocapacitive charge storage behavior with high coulombic efficiency of >95%. The specific capacitance was calculated based on the GCD data, and it attained 474.23, 425 and 336 F g−1 at 1.5, 5 and 12 A g−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5F. More importantly, the MXene@CFT electrode also exhibits an excellent rate capability of 70% at a 6-fold increase in current density (12 A g−1) relative to the initial value (1.5 A g−1). Furthermore, the cycling stability of the MXene@CFT electrode was examined by running it for 10000 GCD cycles at a high current density of 12 A g−1 and the results are depicted in Fig. 5G. The MXene@CFT electrode displays excellent stability by retaining 97.52% capacitance, indicating outstanding stability over 10000 cycles.
It is expected that ZCO‖MXene-ASC will be a promising energy storage device as we are inspired by the electrochemical results of the positive and negative electrodes in aqueous electrolyte. The schematic design of ZCO‖MXene-ASC with a KOH hydrogel as a solid-state electrolyte is shown in Fig. 6A. The CV curves of both electrodes in respective potential windows at a fixed scan rate of 50 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 6B. According to the charge balance theory (m+/m− = C−V−/C+V+), the highest value of capacitance was achieved at a mass ratio of 0.23 between the positive and negative electrode, respectively. The ZCO‖MXene-ASC was further tested by examining the CV curves at various scan rates in a wide potential range of 0.0–1.6 V, as shown in Fig. 5C. The CV curves clearly depict the highly pseudocapacitive charge storage characters with a pair of redox peaks originating from the transition of Co2+/Co3+. The CV curves possess good symmetric features along the y-axis and demonstrate high stability over a wide range of scan rates (5–125 mV s−1), which signifies the excellent stability and reversibility of ZCO‖MXene-ASC. The GCD profiles of ZCO‖MXene-ASC in the same potential window as the CV curves are recorded at various current densities ranging from 0.5 to 10 A g−1 and are displayed in Fig. 6D. All GCD profiles are closely symmetric and take almost the same time for the charging and discharging process, indicating the excellent electrochemical reversibility and admirable coulombic efficiency. Coulombic efficiencies of 92.51%, 97.77%, 99.33%, 97.67%, 94.23% and 94.44% are recorded at current densities of 0.1, 1.0, 1.5, 3, 6 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The specific capacitance was computed based on the total mass of anode and cathode materials using the area under the discharge curves instead of discharging time to avoid overestimation according to the eqn (3) (ESI†). The obtained results of specific capacitance are displayed in Fig. 6E along with the areal capacitance of ZCO‖MXene-ASC. Encouragingly, ZCO‖MXene-ASC exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 281.3, 225 and 200 F g−1 at 0.5, 3.0 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The rate capability of ZCO‖MXene-ASC reaches 71.1% when the current density is increased by 20 times (10 A g−1) compared to the initial value (0.5 A g−1), which indicates the outstanding storage capability with extremely high rates among the recently reported values for bimetallic oxide-based ASCs such as ZnCo2O4//AC-2019 (100% at 1 A g−1 and 62.56% at 10 A g−1),29 ZnCo2O4@Co–Al LDH//AC-2019 (100% at 0.5 A g−1 and 33.41% at 8 A g−1),44 ZnCo2O4 ultra-thin curved sheets//AC-2019 (100% at 1 A g−1 and 29.65% at 7.5 A g−1),45 hetero-structured reduced ZnCo2O4@NiMoO4·H2O//AC-2019 (100% at 4 mA cm−2 and 15.44% at 20 mA cm−2),46 ZnMoO4/CoO//EGCP-2019 (100% at 1 A g−1 and 61.65% at 10 A g−1),33 flower-like ZnCo2O4//ZnCo2O4-2018 (100% at 1 A g−1 and 54.16% at 16 A g−1),27 carbon coated hetero-MnCo2S4/CoS1.097//AC-2018 (100% at 1 A g−1 and 64.40% at 10 A g−1),34 and MnCo2S4//AC-2018 (100% at 0.5 A g−1 and 27.40% at 10 A g−1)47 (AC, ECPG and LDH denote activated carbon exfoliated graphite carbon paper and layered double hydroxide, respectively). Furthermore, the areal capacitance of ZCO‖MXene-ASC was also computed, which reached the highest value of 1.41 F cm−2 at 2.5 A cm−2, which is a good value for all-solid-state SCs. The good performance was further clarified by recording the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the Nyquist plot is shown in Fig. 6F. The ZCO‖MXene-ASC exhibits low solution resistance (Rs ∼ 2.38 Ω) and a small charge transfer resistance (Rct ∼ 2.15 Ω). The EIS results signify the good electrical conductivities of the electrode materials with a significantly enhanced rate performance.

Besides the competitive electrochemical and rate capabilities, cycling stability is another critical parameter by which to evaluate the performance of SCs. Surprisingly, ZCO‖MXene-ASC exhibits outstanding cycling stability in a large potential window of 0.0–1.6 V over 5500 cycles at high current density of 15 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 6G. ZCO‖MXene-ASC attained a high capacitance retention of 94.88% with a good coulombic efficiency of 95.61% of the initial value after 5500 cycles, the first and last 4 GCD cycles are depicted in the inset of Fig. 6G, which indicates the excellent stability of ZCO‖MXene-ASC during the long-term cycling stability tests. The excellent electrochemical performance with outstanding rate-capability and stability can be ascribed to the binder-free cathode and layer structured anode materials with good conductivities. The microstructure with mesoporous nano-channels combined with MXene can effectively enhance the diffusion rate of electrolyte ions and improved the rare-capability of the entire device.
The energy and power densities of ZCO‖MXene-ASC were calculated based on the GCD data to examine the practical strength of the device according to the eqn (4) and (5) (ESI†). The ZCO‖MXene-ASC delivers a high energy density of 99.94 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1 and can still provide an energy density of 71.06 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 8.2 kW kg−1. According to the best of our knowledge, the achieved values of energy and power densities are superior to all the recently reported zinc-cobaltite and even bimetallic oxide-based SCs and ASCs such as ZnCo2O4@C//AC (49.5 W h kg−1 at 700 W kg−1),48 ZnCo2O4–rGO//AC (49 W h kg−1 at 400 W kg−1),49 ZnCo2O4/NG//AC (23.8 W h kg−1 at 500 W kg−1),26 ZnCo2O4//AC (29.76 W h kg−1 at 398.9 W kg−1),50 ZnCo2O4–MnO2//AC (69 W h kg−1 at 867 W kg−1),51 ZnCo2O4@ZnWO4//AC (24 W h kg−1 at 400 W kg−1),52 NiCo2O4@NixCoyMoO4 (64.7 W h kg−1 at 749.6 W kg−1),53 ZnCo2O4@NixCo2x(OH)6x//AC (26.2 W h kg−1 at 511.8 W kg−1),54 ZnCo2O4//AC (36.31 W h kg−1 at 850 W kg−1)55 and ZnCo2O4@MnO2//AC (29.41 W h kg−1 at 628.42 W kg−1).56 A comprehensive comparison with recently published bimetallic-based ASCs is presented in a Ragone plot, as shown in Fig. 7A. Besides high energy and power densities, the flexibility of all-solid-state devices is significant for modern electronics; thus, we applied flexible tests under various bending states to measure the flexible performance of ZCO‖MXene-ASC. The CV curves were recorded at normal, bent and recover states of ZCO‖MXene-ASC as shown in Fig. 7B, and the overlapped CV curves indicate that there is no noticeable change in the performance of ZCO‖MXene-ASC during the flexibility tests. Furthermore, 500 bending cycles were performed (normal to bent at 180° is known as one bending cycle), and 87.44% capacitance was retained in the first bent cycle, as shown in Fig. S9.† The digital photographs of ZCO‖MXene-ASC entirely bent and twisted by tweezers are shown in Fig. 7C. To assess the practical strength of ZCO‖MXene-ASC, the three devices were connected in series and were able to power 14 red coloured LEDs (1.6 V, 15 mA) for 2 min (Fig. 7D), which proves that they are good energy storage devices.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have designed a high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor based on battery-type bimetallic oxide ZCO@CFT nanopolyhedra as the cathode and capacitive-type layer structured Ti3C2Tx-MXene as the anode material. The ZCO@CFT cathode exhibits a high pseudocapacitive charge storage (∼63.22%) with a specific capacitance of 2643.66 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and MXene@CFT exhibits a specific capacitance of 474.23 F g−1 at 1.5 A g−1 with excellent cycling stabilities of >95%. Furthermore, ASCs were fabricated using ZCO@CFT and MXene@CFT as the cathode and anode, (denoted as ZCO‖MXene-ASC) to check the feasibility of the proposed design. The ZCO‖MXene-ASC shows excellent energy storage properties by achieving a high capacitance of 281.25 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, a highly competitive energy density of 99.94 W h kg−1 at an admirable power density of 800 W kg−1 with a good life-time of >94% over 5000 cycles and flexibility. According to the best of our knowledge, the achieved energy density of ZCO‖MXene-ASC is very competitive, and the highest among all binary metal oxides, carbonaceous materials, and MXene-based SCs and ASCs to date. Our concept of employing 2D metal carbides and metal oxides could open up a new direction in the development of high-performance energy storage devices.
