    , Accepted 11th July 2012First published on 22nd August 2012AbstractSemitransparent front electrodes for polymer solar cells, that are printable and roll-to-roll processable under ambient conditions using different approaches, are explored in this report. The excellent smoothness of indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes has traditionally been believed to be difficult to achieve using printed front grids, as surface topographies accumulate when processing subsequent layers, leading to shunts between the top and bottom printed metallic electrodes. Here we demonstrate how aqueous nanoparticle based silver inks can be employed as printed front electrodes using several different roll-to-roll techniques. We thus compare hexagonal silver grids prepared using either roll-to-roll inkjet or roll-to-roll flexographic printing. Both inkjet and flexo grids present a raised topography and were found to perform differently due to only the conductivity of the obtained silver grid. The raised topographies were compared with a roll-to-roll thermally imprinted grid that was filled with silver in a roll-to-roll process, thus presenting an embedded topography. The embedded grid and the flexo grid were found to perform equally well, with the flexographic technique currently presenting the fastest processing and the lowest silver use, whereas the embedded grid presents the maximally achievable optical transparency and conductivity. Polymer solar cells were prepared in the same step, using roll-to-roll slot-die coating of zinc oxide as the electron transport layer, poly-3-hexylthiophene:phenyl-C61–butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) as the active layer and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the top electrode, along with a flat bed screen printed silver grid. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) obtained for large area devices (6 cm2) was 1.84%, 0.79% and 1.72%, respectively, for thermally imprinted, inkjet and flexographic silver grids, tested outside under the real sun. Central to all three approaches was that they employed environmentally friendly solvents, i.e. water based nanoparticle silver inks.
1. Introduction
Advantages of polymer solar cells over other solar cell technologies have been listed in numerous cases and include properties such as low temperature processing, flexible substrates, fast preparation using printing and coating techniques, low cost and simple requirements for manufacture.1 The performances have presented a steady growth with an increase by roughly half a percent in power conversion efficiency annually since the year 2000.2 Now the technology reportedly presents power conversion efficiencies in excess of 10%,3 with best performances agreed upon through inter-laboratory or round robin studies, involving many independent laboratories studying the same devices or the same set of devices, being somewhat lower (in the 1–5% range).4–7 It is of significant interest that the record polymer solar cells are with a tiny active area prepared on rigid substrates under inert conditions, employing several vacuum coating steps and scarce elements such as indium in the semitransparent front electrode, making them far from being a realization of the potential advantages that polymer solar cells have to offer. Most notably the polymer solar cell has evolved around one single semitransparent conductor as the front electrode, namely indium-tin-oxide (ITO). There have been very few successful efforts replacing ITO without introducing new limitations that are worse than all those that ITO brings along.7–17 ITO has a very negative impact on the energy payback time for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and it is unlikely that competitive products can be made using ITO, as concluded in several life cycle analysis studies.18–21 Whereas ITO-free devices have a potential to become competitive at much lower efficiencies,22 ITO is most successfully prepared through a vacuum deposition process and there is a dawning consensus that any ITO replacement should be a printable or coatable formulation of a semitransparent conductor.21,22 The only available material that currently fulfills this goal is the well known poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which is remarkably transparent and a good hole conductor that in many ways fits the purpose very well, except for its conductivity which is too low to enable a large area electrode with high optical transmission. The generally accepted solution to this challenge is to employ PEDOT:PSS in conjunction with a printed highly conducting metallic grid, presenting a small shadow loss of preferably less than 20%.14,23–25 The grid–PEDOT:PSS composite electrode thus represents an efficient and fully printable alternative to ITO electrodes, and aside from the need for two different steps (printing the grid and coating the PEDOT:PSS), it does not present any disadvantages. It has however been subject to some discussion as to whether it is possible to prepare a sufficiently thin printed grid that does not result in shunts.14,23–25
This has identified two possible solutions that comprise either embedding the grid structure into the substrate or printing sufficiently thin grid structures on the order of 100 nm, which is comparable or similar in height to the intended thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The disadvantage of the printed grid with a raised topography is that a thin grid needs a certain width to gain conductivity leading to a shadow loss.25 The advantage is of course that it only requires one printing step. The embedded grid has the distinct advantages of potentially enabling very smooth substrate topography and a high aspect ratio of the embedded silver (low width compared to height) thus enabling very high conductivity at low shadow loss. Disadvantages are a lower maximum processing speed and it requires at least two distinct processing steps (thermal imprinting and filling with silver).
In this work we compare embedded silver grids prepared at the Korean Institute for Machinery & Materials (KIMM) with printed silver grids prepared at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). It is demonstrated that the embedded and raised topography works equally well, in conjunction with highly conducting PEDOT:PSS, as a semitransparent ITO free front electrode, for polymer solar cells prepared at DTU, using only printing and coating techniques under ambient conditions (solar cell stack shown in Fig. 1). We highlight the strengths of each of the methods and also identify areas of research where improvements would have a high impact, this being especially within the development of conducting metallic inks with high metal loading.
 Fig. 1  A schematic illustration of the device architecture employed in this study. The only variation explored here is the nature of the front electrode grid which was either roll-to-roll inkjet printed, roll-to-roll flexographically printed or thermally imprinted and silver filled. The schematic shown here is for the embedded grid prepared by thermal imprinting and silver filling. 
2. Experimental techniques
2.1 Materials and substrates
The silver inks were all aqueous based silver nanoparticle inks. For flexographic and thermal imprinting we employed PFI-722 (PChem Associates) and for inkjet printing we employed Suntronic U7089 (sun Chemical). The bottom PEDOT:PSS was PH1000 from Heraeus. The ZnO ink was a MEA (methoxy-ethoxy-acetic acid) stabilized nanoparticle suspension in acetone (56 mg ml−1) with a particle size of 3–5 nm prepared at DTU. The active layer comprised a solution of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) (20 mg ml−1, Sepiolid P200) and phenyl-C61–butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (20 mg ml−1, Solenne BV) dissolved in chlorobenzene and filtered through a 0.45 micron Teflon filter immediately prior to use. The top PEDOT:PSS was Agfa EL-P 5010 diluted with isopropanol (2:1 w/w). The top silver electrode ink was PV410 from Dupont. The adhesive for encapsulation of prototypes was UV-curing Delo LP655. The polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) substrate was Melinex ST506 from Dupont-Teijin with a thickness of 130 microns and a web width of 305 mm. The barrier substrate was an Amcor barrier with a thickness of 45 microns and a web width of 305 mm. The barrier had a WVTR (water vapor transmission rate) and an OTR (oxygen transmission rate) of respectively 0.04 g m−2 d−1 (38 °C, 90% RH), 0.01 cm3 m−2 d−1 bar−1 (23 °C, 50% RH) as reported by Amcor. Contacts were made by application of Cu-tape (3M) to the silver electrodes before encapsulation followed by piercing metal contacts through the foil and Cu-tape once encapsulated. Devices were prepared with an edge seal having a rim of 1 cm.26
2.2 Embedded silver grid by roll-to-roll thermal imprinting and silver filling (at KIMM)
A nickel master grid having a raised topography was prepared by a photolithographic process. The grid lines had a nominal width of 15 microns and a height of 10 microns. The master was mounted on a heated steel imprinting roller giving a repeat length of 34 cm. The roller carrying the master was heated to 110 °C and the PET foil passed through the imprinting roller and the heated steel backing roller. The force applied was 100 kgf and the temperature of the rollers was 110 °C. The web speed was 0.96 m min−1. After thermal imprinting, the pattern was inspected (shown in Fig. 2D) and then filled with the silver nanoparticle ink at a web speed of 0.96 m min−1, by use of a squeegee, forcing the ink into the imprint. The silver filled film was then dried at 140 °C for 3 min. The pattern comprised 14 stripes with a length of 250 mm and width of 13 mm. These stripes were patterned with the diagonal print. The 14 lines were spaced by 2 mm. The repeat length was 340 mm. Please refer to Table 1 for further details.

2.3 Raised silver grid by roll-to-roll inkjet printing (at DTU)
A roll-to-roll inkjet printer with a maximum web width of 330 mm was employed comprising an unwinder, an edge guide, a double sided cleaner (Teknek), a corona treater (Vetaphone), an antistatic system, an inkjet printer, a hot-air oven (2 m oven length) operated at 140 °C, a nip and a rewinder. The inkjet printer is based on Kyocera inkjet printing heads and has a resolution of 600 DPI at right angles to the web direction and 1200 DPI in the direction of the web. The system has three heads and is capable of printing in the full width at speeds up to 75 m min−1. In these experiments a web speed of 2 m min−1 was employed to ensure proper drying of aqueous ink and to reach a significant conductivity of the grid. A mild corona treatment of 300 W was employed at a web speed of 2 m min−1 which enabled good wetting of the PET substrate without excessive spreading of the ink droplets. The ink droplets were 14 pL and each grid line was nominally 2 dots wide. The pulseform for the droplet formation comprised 4 bursts and was terminated with a negative pulse sequence to reduce satellite droplet formation. Fig. 2C shows the inkjet printed grid after drying before the rewinder. A hexagonal pattern was chosen having a repeat of 2 mm and a nominal grid line width of 85 microns. Ink spreading led to an effective line width of ∼132 microns and a height of ∼300 nm, as shown in Fig. 4. The pattern comprised 16 stripes with a length of 303 mm and width of 13 mm. These stripes were patterned with the hexagonal print. The 16 lines were spaced by 2 mm. The repeat length was 305 mm. Please refer to Table 1 for further details.
2.4 Raised silver grid by roll-to-roll flexographic printing (at DTU)
A roll-to-roll flexographic printer comprising an unwinder, an edge guide, a double sided cleaner (Teknek), a corona treater (Vetaphone), a 4-roller flexographic printer, a drying system, a nip and a rewinder was employed. The drying system comprised 2 × 1.5 kW infrared dryers and 2 × 2 m ovens operated at 140 °C. The pattern was printed using a web speed of 25 m min−1, an anilox roller with a nominal ink volume of 1.5 cm3 m−2 and a laser engraved rubber printing roller with a hardness of 65 Shore. Full corona treatment (1500 W) was employed during printing that started at around 5 m min−1 with a minimum practical printing speed of 8 m min−1. The pattern had reached full conductivity immediately after printing with little gain in conductivity upon further heating or sintering. The wet ink just before the first IR dryer is shown in Fig. 2B. A hexagonal pattern was chosen having a repeat of 2 mm and a nominal grid line width of 100 microns. Ink spreading led to an effective line width of ∼133 microns as shown in Fig. 4. The printed height was typically around 150 nm but due to viscous fingering (Saffman–Taylor instabilities27,28) the maximum observed thickness was up to 700 nm (see confocal micrograph in Fig. 4). The general observation was that the faster the printing, the lower the height of the viscous fingering. The pattern comprised 16 stripes with a length of 303 mm and a width of 13 mm. These stripes were printed with the hexagonal pattern. The 16 lines were spaced by 2 mm. The repeat length was 305 mm. Please refer to Table 1 for further details.
2.5 Roll-to-roll processing of the solar cell stack and encapsulation (at DTU)
The foils with inkjet printed, flexographically printed and thermally imprinted silver grids were spliced into one roll with a length of 150 m. All subsequent processing was carried out on the same roll in the same processing step in order to keep variation as low as possible, limited to only the temporal difference between processing at the start and finish of the roll (see Section 2.1 for details on materials). PEDOT:PSS PH1000 was rotary screen printed on top of the grid structure with a printing speed of 10 m min−1 and dried using a 1.5 kW IR heater and a 2 meter oven at 140 °C. The remainder of the processing followed the well known ProcessOne29 and comprised slot-die coating of a ZnO nanoparticle suspension in acetone with a web speed of 5 m min−1 and a wet thickness of 9.6 microns yielding a nominal dry thickness of ∼96 nm of the ZnO layer. Drying took place through two ovens. The first oven (2 m long) was set to a temperature of 70 °C, and the second oven (2 m) was set to a temperature of 140 °C. The active layer was slot-die coated at a web speed of 2 m min−1 through a first oven (2 m) set to 90 °C and a second oven (2 m) set to 140 °C. The PEDOT:PSS EL-P 5010 was slot-die coated at a web speed of 0.6 m min−1 through a first oven (2 m) set to 120 °C and a 1.5 kW IR heater followed by a second oven (2 m) set to 140 °C. Finally the silver back electrode that comprised a bus bar and linear grid lines (comb structure) with a thickness of 0.2 mm and a repeat of 1 mm was screen printed at a web speed of 1 m min−1 and an oven temperature of 140 °C (oven length 1.2 m). Various electrode patterns were employed, and the most successful one was similar to a previously reported cell back electrode, except that it had a larger active area of 6 cm2.30 Devices were then placed on a large piece of barrier foil with some UV-curing adhesive, and Cu-tape was applied to each of the electrode bus bars. A little adhesive was then placed on the top followed by another large layer of barrier film. The unsealed laminate was passed through a laminator using a pressure of 150 kg over the width of the foil, thus forcing the adhesive to flow over the device on both sides, without bubbles. The adhesive was subsequently cured for 2 minutes under a solar simulator (1000 W m−2, 85 °C), starting with the printed side (this is important). The final device was then contacted by piercing metal contacts through the barrier and the copper foil.
2.6 Characterisation of grids, films and devices using optical microscopy, FESEM, I–V curves solar simulation, real sunlight and LBIC
The grids were initially characterized for quality by optical microscopy using a microscope from Lab Engineering Instruments, India. The metal grids were then subjected to scanning electron microscopy in the regions of the metal ink to highlight the nanoparticle nature of the ink, and establish the size and the degree of fusion between the nanoparticles (Fig. 3), using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM 600). The nanoparticle sizes after filling/printing and curing were respectively for thermally imprinted grids and inkjet printed grids: 216 ± 37 nm, 45 ± 9 nm, as determined from SEM analysis. It was difficult to establish a size and average for flexo printed silver as the particles have fused to a large degree, as is readily seen in Fig. 3, but we estimate that the particles are in the 25–50 nm range. The solar cells were characterized using custom made software for the Keithley 2400 series source meters. All I–V characterization was carried out using full size devices with an active area of approx. 6 cm2. In each case the active area was established carefully using light beam induced current (LBIC, Fig. 5).31 Solar simulation employed a metal–halide lamp that approaches AM1.5G quite well and all measurements were performed at 1000 W m−2, 85 °C. To establish a good accuracy of our reported efficiency, reference devices were also characterized under the real sun on 23rd of May 2012 starting at 12:00 (GMT + 1). The geographic position of the measurements were at DTU in Roskilde, with latitude/longitude 55°69′N/12°10′E with the solar cells mounted on a solar tracker thus having the sun at normal incidence. The incident sunlight was measured using an AM1.5G and an AM1.5D bolometer from Eppley Laboratories. The former was employed to establish the total incident intensity from the half space surrounding the solar cell and the latter to establish the degree of haze in the atmosphere. The day of the measurement presented a clear blue sky with some haze. The incident intensity was around 900 W m−2, and the outside temperature was 22 °C. The temperature of the solar cells was 35 °C during the measurements. The exact intensity was recorded just before and just after the recording of each I–V curve. LBIC images were recorded using a custom made setup using a semiconductor laser with an optical output of 10 mW and a wavelength of 406 nm. The spot size was around 50 microns and the practical resolution due to scattering in the barrier film, adhesive and substrate layers was 100 microns.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Water based silver inks as an ITO alternative
Critical to the fulfillment of the acclaimed environmental friendliness of polymer solar cells is the use of environmentally friendly processing steps. The solvents commonly employed when processing polymer solar cells on a laboratory or pilot scale32 are most often chlorinated aromatic solvents. Only PEDOT:PSS and the commonly employed ZnO layer have been developed for aqueous processing. A few reports have demonstrated aqueous processing of all the layers including the metal back electrode33 and the active layer using emulsions.34 In this study only water based nanoparticle silver inks were employed which from this point of view fully address objectives of environmentally friendly processing in the desired manner with no drawbacks, while the choice of method would depend on other parameters for selection which might be specific to a particular application. Some parameters that allow for comparison between the methods are highlighted in Table 1.
It should be stressed that in addition to the environmental friendliness being a necessity for large scale production of OPV as a technology, the environment for the operator that manufactures the OPV is significantly improved, and in terms of health and safety water as a solvent does present the pinnacle of ink technology at all levels.
3.2 The roll-to-roll processing methods
To date almost all polymer solar cells reported in the literature have been prepared using the combination of two techniques, spin coating and metal evaporation. It should be stressed that neither of these techniques are expected to share a future with widely disseminated polymer solar cells, where only processes that rely on flexible substrates and the absence of vacuum steps are expected. To fully exploit the potential of the polymer solar cell, high speed and low temperature processing using printing and coating techniques should be pursued, and the process development based on spin coating and metal evaporation can, in general, not be expected to be directly transferable. Additional points are that a myriad of different printing and coating techniques exist, and it is almost certain that each technique presents its own optimization challenges. Furthermore, it is likely that one or a few of the techniques will be better suited for each layer in a given polymer solar cell. It is thus naïve to believe that a particular material combination and layer stack, chosen based on spin coating and metal evaporation, can be transferred to a roll-to-roll coating setting.1 It is of significant importance to develop the device structure from the bottom, using the intended techniques, in an as similar setting as possible. So far, the most successful roll-to-roll based techniques employed for the processing of OPV are slot-die coating and flat bed screen printing. Few other techniques have been employed in a full roll-to-roll setting while techniques such as inkjet,23–25,35–37 gravure,38 flexo1,39 and spray coating40–44 have been reported for batch processed samples. It can be assumed that these techniques can be scaled to full roll-to-roll processing with a relatively small effort, while some may be better suited than others. In this work we focused on the ITO free front electrode and demonstrate that three different techniques can be employed successfully.
3.3 Raised versus embedded grid topographies
A clear objective for any electrode structure for OPV, which is inherently a thin film multilayer technology, is that it is smooth and planar. This is especially critical since film roughness for thin film structures accumulates when processing subsequent layers, and it is practically impossible to erase a rough structure with a subsequent layer when the roughness is larger than the film thickness, especially when the solid content in the covered ink is low. An additional problem is that the function of the OPV relies on completely covered layers. If the first layer already presents a roughness that far exceeds the capacity of subsequently processed layers to cover it then it will not be possible to prepare functional polymer solar cells. Since the first processed layer in this case is the highly conducting silver electrode this would lead to shunted solar cells in cases where the silver transcends several of the layers. Here the nanoparticle based inks do seem to present some advantages as they give a certain roundness to protrusions in the printed grids. This seems to enable coverage of the structures even if the roughness is larger than the layer by a factor of 1–5. In this case the choice of printing method for the first PEDOT:PSS layer and the particular ink type seems to be especially important. Rotary screen printing is in many ways similar to flat bed screen printing but does differ in the much higher shear rates that are involved. Compared to spin coating, which has been viewed as an insufficient method to cover raised grid structures, rotary screen printing does present a difference here too, since the direction of shear is normal to the surface (and the roughness). This is in stark contrast to spin coating where the direction of shear is parallel to the surface. It is thus likely that rotary screen printing has a better capacity to print evenly around protrusions, enabling better coverage of rough structures. Common to all three grid types explored here is that they worked equally well, in the sense that all devices that were tested functioned, presenting no significant shunting (please see the next section for more details). In terms of transmittance (Fig. 2F) the thermally imprinted grid does have an edge over the other candidates, with the inkjet suffering the most due to irregularities in the grid structure (middle part of Fig. 4).

Inkjet is shown (middle) with an illustration of the occasional presence of misfired ink droplets and the irregular structure of the grid lines, as compared to the more regular flexographically printed grids (bottom). 
3.4 LBIC, I–V curves and performance
The devices were encapsulated and then tested using a solar simulator, while the best devices were also tested outside under the real sun on a clear day (see Fig. 6 and Table 2). A notable similarity between simulated and real sun measurements in terms of efficiency and photovoltaic parameters was generally observed. The small differences are ascribed to: the more direct light from the sun as compared to more diffuse light from the solar simulator; the slightly lower intensity of the real sun (specific to the day of measurement); and also a lower temperature for real sun measurement (see Section 2.6). Outdoor studies of polymer solar cells have been few,4,5,45–47 but generally the field of polymer and organic solar cells would benefit greatly if this became customary. Even if sunlight in many regions of the world is not available every day, the sun does shine at regular intervals, and by recording the geographical location, the date and the time of measurement, it becomes much more consistent and easy to check against weather databases. We feel that such experiments should be encouraged.

Devices based on embedded grids and flexographically printed grids presented high fill factors between 51 and 56%, which is quite high considering that this is a large area device. The devices based on inkjet printed grids presented somewhat lower fill factors, which can be rationalized by the significantly higher resistivity of the inkjet printed grids (Table 1). In reverse bias, all device types performed similarly, presenting high shunt resistivity.
In terms of device manufacture and robustness of the solar cells, all types of printed grids performed equally well. The active areas of the devices were quite accurately established using LBIC measurements.31 Even if the devices did not show any visual signs of defects it is clear that the active area was not as well defined along the edges as one would expect. Several non-active areas were also observed as shown in Fig. 5, where the yellow colour represents efficient light harvesting and conversion into an electrical current while a blue colour represents low or no light harvesting and conversion into an electrical current.

The small insets show photos of the particular cell type with strong backlighting. (Right) Device seen from the back side, featuring the screen printed back electrode. 
In the LBIC images (Fig. 5) the back electrode grid structure can be recognized as a slightly better performing area due to more efficient light harvesting. The front grid clearly shows up as nonactive areas due to the shadowing effect of the respective grids. In the case of the thermally imprinted grid, the resolution of the LBIC (∼100 microns) is too low to resolve the sub-resolution width of the grid lines but the structure is clearly visible. The performance of the devices is shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2 under both outdoor and indoor conditions. It is of interest to note that both the thermally imprinted and the flexographically printed grids exhibit a lower performance under outside conditions. We ascribe this to a larger shadow loss from the grid lines under a more direct light source (such as the sun). In the case of the inkjet grid based device, this effect is less pronounced, as it is likely countered by a non-linear light intensity dependence of the short circuit current due to the high series resistance in the device, which also gives the higher fill factor outdoor as compared to indoor.48

3.5 Areas where further research would have an impact
Each of the grid structures presented here has its strengths and weaknesses. To identify the area where research could impact each of them the most we refer to Table 1 and also the results shown in Fig. 5 and 6. In terms of processing speed the flexographically printed grid is the most refined, as demonstrated by the significantly higher processing speeds achievable already in this laboratory experiment. Further refinement of this grid would be in achieving a higher resolution of the grid lines, which should be possible (30–50 microns should be within current technological capacity).
The embedded grid presents the highest fill factors and best performance in devices but suffers in processing speed. In this case, a significant gain could be reached if processing speed could be increased, while finer grids with perhaps line widths of 10 microns and repetitions of 500 microns would enable thinner front PEDOT:PSS layers to be used, leading to a higher optical transmission into the active layer.
The inkjet printed grid clearly suffers from poor conductivity and an effort here would bring about the fastest progress. For instance, roll-to-roll photonic sintering49 could significantly improve the conductivity of the inkjet printed grid but would require an extra processing step. In terms of processing speed, the inkjet experiment here presented an intermediate speed. This is, however, not problematic to increase as the current system, employed in this experiment, can operate well in excess of 60 meters per minute, which represents the current research goal.1 The curing time of the silver ink, however, significantly impacts the grid conductivity, and the speed chosen here was thus to fit the available oven length. Ink development would seem to be urgently needed to fully realize the advantages of the digital master and fast adaptability of the inkjet approach.
4. Conclusions
We successfully demonstrated that large area ITO free polymer solar cells can be prepared by only printing in the ambient atmosphere, with little compromise in performance compared to previously reported ITO-based devices with similar size and processing conditions. We found that the use of water based silver nanoparticle inks enable preparation of conductive grids for polymer solar cells. We demonstrate that embedded grids with a narrow line width extending deep into the substrate enable high conductivity electrodes with little shadow loss. The only limitation is in the processing speed, which overall is estimated to have an upper bound of around 6 m min−1 for a process comprising thermal imprinting, silver filling and drying (Table 1). For raised topographies we explored both inkjet and flexographic printing, where both methods provide inherently high speed processing, with inkjet currently having an upper limit of 75 m min−1, and flexographic printing around 200 m min−1 and possibly higher. Limitations are that increased conductivity implies a large optical shadow loss. Flexographically printed grids and embedded grids were found to be qualitatively similar in this study, with flexographic printing providing the fastest processing of 25 m min−1 in this experiment, along with the lowest silver usage of around 200 mg per square metre of printed area. We conclude that the era of ITO is over, and that a new age can begin without reliance on indium and vacuum processes, since large area devices can be prepared with similar performance to ITO based devices.
