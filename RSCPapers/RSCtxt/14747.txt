    , Accepted 3rd September 2020First published on 3rd September 2020AbstractCrystalline phases along with the morphology of any semiconducting material are the key factors that govern photocatalytic properties. Herein, we have prepared a composite of α- and δ-MnO2 with distinct crystallographic orientation and phases. The bandgap of the composite (α + δ)-MnO2 lies in the range of visible light. Similarly, MnO2 is well known for its energy storage capability. Photocatalytic and energy storage processes can be combined in a single device to achieve higher energy storage efficiency. The focus of our study is to investigate the synergy between two crystallographic phases of MnO2 and its influence on electrochemical and photoelectrochemical energy conversion and storage properties. The prepared composite, with the advantage of tunnel structure of the rod-shaped α-MnO2, as well as the layered structure of 2D δ-MnO2 with high surface area, was found to induce positive effects and superior electrochemical storage properties. The prepared composite produced favorable results for the Zn–air battery application, which showed approximately 2 and 4 times higher power density than the δ-MnO2 and α-MnO2, respectively. Moreover, to illustrate the practical applicability of the composite, a rechargeable solid-state Zn–air battery was fabricated to power a light-emitting diode. A photo-enhanced Zn–air battery using the composite MnO2 electrode was also fabricated to explore the photoactivity and concurrent effect on the storage property of the composite material. The visible-light-driven Zn–air battery exhibited significant improvement in the bifunctional oxygen electrode activity by 7.20% in the presence of light as compared to that in dark. The battery also exhibits lowering of the potential difference for charging and discharging by 7.62% and 29.89% enhancement in the round-trip efficiency, indicating the positive role of light illumination on the battery performance.
Introduction
With the depletion in the fossil fuel reserve and the concomitant increase in environmental pollution, it is important to invest in renewable energy resources.1 However, the stochastic nature of renewable resources has necessitated investigation on energy conversion and storage of these resources. Among the different electrochemical energy storage systems, batteries and supercapacitors have drawn significant attention due to their high power density, long cycle life, minimal ecological problems, low cost and minimal dependency on load and temperature.2 Among all types of energy storage devices, Li-ion batteries outperform others due to their high energy density, flexible light-weight design, longer lifespan, and have thus become the choice for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles.3 However, the dendritic growth during subsequent charge–discharge cycles, safety and environmental impacts and specific capacity limitation of Li-batteries have directed us towards the development of other kinds of non-toxic energy storage systems.3,4 Consequently, research has shifted towards the development of metal–air batteries because of their non-toxic nature, high theoretical energy density, low cost, together with its safety.5,6
Aforementioned, zinc (Zn)–air batteries are low-cost, environmentally benign, safe to handle and possess a theoretical energy density of 1350 W h kg−1,7 but the practical open circuit potential (1.35 V) was found to largely deviate from the theoretical value (1.67 V).8 Combining photoconversion and the Zn–air battery within a single device could greatly enhance the capacity of the battery. For this purpose, a photoactive material must be chosen as the electrode. Manganese dioxide-based semiconductors are known to be active visible-light-driven catalysts.9–11 Sodium birnessite-type MnO2 has been explored by Jaramillo et al. for photoelectrochemical water splitting and hydrogen generation in an aqueous electrochemical environment.12,13 MnO2 possesses incompletely filled d-orbitals that absorb visible light due to d–d transitions.14 In addition to its low-cost, MnO2 is also known for its excellent activity as a bifunctional catalyst towards ORR and OER processes and is, therefore, a suitable material for the reversible Zn–air battery.15 MnO2 has been explored and found to be one of the most promising material for other energy storage applications such as supercapacitors.16,17 Therefore, we propose the utilization of its photoactive properties for performing OER and ORR with improved performance for rechargeable Zn–air batteries. Taking inspiration from photoelectrochemically-enhanced water splitting, the solar spectrum can also be utilized for promoting photoelectro-enhanced ORR and OER. Liming Dai and co-workers utilized Ni12P5-NCNT to fabricate photo-responsive rechargeable Zn–air batteries.18 Liu et al. showed the role of solar energy in improving the OER kinetics of the Zn–air battery.19 Zhu et al. demonstrated using photoactive polymer semiconductors for the direct conversion of photoenergy to electric energy.20 Chanikarn Tomon et al. also developed a photoactive Zn–air battery using Co3O4 as the cathode.21
Depending on the arrangement of the MnO6 octahedral unit, MnO2 exists in several crystal systems, namely, α, β, γ, and δ-MnO2. Among them δ-MnO2 has a layered structure, and α-MnO2, possess (2 × 2) and (1 × 1) tunnel structure. The structure–property relationship of MnO2 with different crystal structures signifies α-MnO2 (with interlayer separation is 4.6 Å) to be the most active in both the OER and ORR as compared to other structures of MnO2, as cations (K+) and H2O can be accommodated in its tunnel structure and provide the sites for di-μ2-oxo-O(H).22 In our previous work, we have shown how the doping of Fe in α-MnO2 improves its battery performance.23 Moreover, it can be recharged from MnOOH to MnO2 by oxidizing with oxygen.24 On the contrary, δ-MnO2 has a large interlayer separation (7 Å) that can facilitate better insertion of smaller cations (like K+, Na+, etc.) and molecules (like H2O). This, in turn, increases its specific capacitance.25 Single-phase MnO2 as the material for catalysis has been well explored, yet it has certain constraints like low stability, less conductivity, small ion diffusion constant, etc. associated with it.16,26,27
We aimed to study the possible synergism between the two different MnO2 structures: 1D α- and 2D δ-MnO2 together in a composite material as a bifunctional electrode for photo-enhanced Zn–air batteries. Detailed studies have revealed that both the crystal structure and morphology influence the specific capacity of individual α- and δ-MnO2 and also the composite material. We have also demonstrated a visible-light-driven rechargeable Zn–air battery using this composite, with improvement in the bifunctional oxygen electrode activity by 7.20% in the presence of light. The potential difference between charging and discharging was decreased by 7.62% under light illumination, indicating its positive effect on battery performance.
Experimental
All the chemicals used were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and were used without further purification.
Synthesis of α-MnO2
For the synthesis of α-MnO2, 0.07 M KMnO4 (0.168 g) was dissolved in 15 ml distilled water and stirred. While stirring, 375 μl of conc. HCl was added to maintain the acidic pH. The solution was further stirred till it became homogeneous, followed by transfer to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave that was kept at 120 °C for 12 hours. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled naturally. The obtained precipitate was washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol until the solution pH became neutral, and it was collected by centrifugation, followed by drying in air at room temperature.
Synthesis of δ-MnO2
For the synthesis of δ-MnO2, a similar synthesis procedure was employed to that of α-MnO2 but here, the pH of the solution was not adjusted.
Synthesis of the composite of α- and δ-MnO2
For the synthesis of the composite (α + δ)-Mnxy, x and y indicate the amount of α- and δ-MnO2 taken, respectively. The (α + δ)-Mn11 electrocatalyst contains equal amounts of α- and δ-MnO2. The (α + δ)-Mn12 electrocatalyst contains a 1:2 weight ratio of α- and δ-MnO2, respectively. Similarly, the (α + δ)-Mn21 electrocatalyst contains 2:1 weight ratio of α- and δ-MnO2. The electrocatalyst was ground with a mortar and pestle, followed by annealing in a tube furnace at 250 °C for 2 h in an Ar atmosphere with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1.
Material characterizations
X-Ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab Diffractometer) studies were done to determine the crystal structure and phase composition of the materials, using a Cu-Kα source in the range 2θ = 10 to 90°, and step size of 0.02. To observe the surface morphology, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Nova Nano-SEM 450, FEI) was used. For selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and to calculate the d-spacing of the planes, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; FEI TECNAI G2 20) was used. Further, to determine the available surface area of the catalyst for catalysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET; Quantachrome Autosorb IQ3) analysis was performed at 77.35 K. To study the oxidation state and composition of the species present on the surface, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ThermoFisher Scientific Nexsa) was conducted using Al-Kα as the source of X-rays. Absorbance and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopies were conducted using a PerkinElmer UV-vis-NIR Lambda-750 spectrophotometer with a PTFE internal reflectance standard.
Electrochemical measurements
The working electrode for performing electrochemical measurements was prepared by adding active material:Vulcan carbon X72 in 1:4 wt ratio with IPA:distilled water in 1:1 volume ratio; 10 μl of 5 wt% Nafion solution was also added as a binder. The ink was sonicated till a homogeneous suspension was obtained and 20 μl (mass loading = 102 mg cm−2) was dropcast over a rotating disc electrode (RDE, 5 mm diameter).
The electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode system using the Autolab electrochemical workstation (Metrohm), where Pt wire was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode with 0.1 M KOH as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were performed to study the electrochemical properties of the active material. The studies were performed in illuminated and dark conditions; a 150 W visible light lamp source was used, which was kept around 10 cm away from the working electrode.
Zinc–air battery
All the electrochemical characterizations were performed in a traditional two-electrode system using an Autolab electrochemical workstation (Metrohm). The Zn–air battery system was fabricated using Zn foil as the anode, catalyst-coated carbon paper as the air cathode and 6 M KOH + 0.2 M ZnCl2 as the electrolyte.
The working electrode was prepared by drop-casting the already prepared ink described above, on a carbon paper (1 cm × 1 cm) followed by drying at 80 °C in an electric oven overnight. A polished Zn foil (2 cm × 1 cm) was properly cleaned by sonication and changing the solvents in the following manner: distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, acetone for 15 minutes. The rechargeable Zn–air battery was prepared using the electrodes (α-, δ- and (α + δ)-Mn11), and then the photoinduced rechargeable battery was set-up for the best electrode. A 150 W lamp was used as the visible light source and was kept 10 cm away from the cathode.
Solid-state Zn–air battery fabrication
For fabricating the solid-state Zn–air battery, the active material ink was coated on Ni foam over a 2 cm × 2 cm area and used as the cathode. Polished Zn foil (2 cm × 2 cm) was taken as the anode. The two electrodes were joined together using PVA–KOH gel. For preparing the PVA–KOH gel, 1 g PVA was added to 20 ml distilled water at 80 °C with continuous stirring until a clear gel was formed. Then, 10 ml of 6 M KOH and 0.2 M ZnCl2 solution was added to the polymeric solution at room temperature with continuous stirring overnight. This PVA–KOH gel was coated between the two electrodes. The whole assembly was then hot pressed at 40 °C with a 1 MPa load for 1 minute. Two such assemblies were connected in series to prepare a solid-state Zn–air battery device.
Results and discussion
1. Physical characterization
KMnO4 was used as the precursor for the synthesis of MnO2 nanostructures. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of MnO2, where the differences in the PXRD peaks are clearly observable. Fig. 1(a) represents the XRD pattern of δ-MnO2, whose peaks match with JCPDS card no. #080-1098. The absence of any impurity peak indicates the formation of the pure-phase δ-MnO2 in neutral medium. It was reported previously that thermal decomposition is responsible for the formation of MnO2 from KMnO4.28,29Fig. 1(b) shows that the sample prepared in acidic medium is α-MnO2, and it matches JCPDS card no. #044-0141. No impurity peak was observed, indicating the formation of the pure-phase α-MnO2. These results show that the pH of the synthesis medium influences the crystallographic orientation and hence, different phases of MnO2 can be synthesized.30 It was observed that acidic medium is crucial for the synthesis of the α-phase, whereas neutral medium is needed for the synthesis of the δ-phase. The two synthesized phases of MnO2 mainly differ because of their crystal structures and the arrangement of the MnO6 octahedra. α-MnO2 is composed of two parallel rows of corner-sharing MnO6 octahedra and thereby form (2 × 2) and (1 × 1) tunnels, with sizes of 4.60 Å and 1.89 Å, respectively.31 These tunnels play an important role in intercalating smaller ions and can thus enhance the catalytic activity of α-MnO2. On the other hand, δ-MnO2 is composed of stacked sheets of edge-sharing MnO6 octahedra, forming a layered structure with an interlayer separation of 7 Å that also helps in intercalating ions.31 As compared to other crystal phases of MnO2, α and δ phases have the highest void spaces and hence show the best catalytic activity or charge storage.16Fig. 1(c) shows the XRD plot of the composite (α + δ)-Mn11, with predominant peaks of α-MnO2. Similarly, the composites (α + δ)-Mn12 and (α + δ)-Mn21 (shown in Fig. 1(d) and (e) respectively) also predominantly show peaks of α-MnO2.

Fig. 2 shows the surface morphologies of α-, δ-MnO2 with composites (α + δ)-Mn11, (α + δ)-Mn12 and (α + δ)-Mn21, investigated by FESEM. Fig. 2(a) displays the flower-like structure of δ-MnO2, composed of clusters of many wrinkled sheets and forming a spherical nanostructure of around 1 μm diameter. Fig. 2(b) shows the 1-D rod-shaped structure of α-MnO2, with around 1 μm length and around 100 nm width of the rods. The formation of rods can be explained by the dissolution-crystallization mechanism.23 This also confirms the role of pH in the formation of different phases as well as morphologies. Acidic conditions led to the formation of 1D nanorods, whereas in neutral medium, 2D nanoflakes were obtained. Fig. 2(c) shows the FESEM image of (α + δ)-Mn11, where the presence of both 1D rods as well as 2D nanoflakes indicates the existence of both phases in the composite. This combination of 1D and 2D morphologies is expected to enhance the electronic conduction system within the material.16 Similarly, Fig. 2(d) and (e) present the FESEM images of (α + δ)-Mn12 and (α + δ)-Mn21, which also show the presence of both 1D rods and 2D nanoflakes; however, (α + δ)-Mn12 shows the greater quantity of 2D nanoflakes and (α + δ)-Mn21 shows more 1D rods in the material. Fig. 2(f) is the EDS image of MnO2 showing the presence of K, Mn and O on the surface.

Fig. 3(a)–(c) show TEM images of α-, δ- and (α + δ)-Mn11, respectively. Fig. 3(a) shows a single 1D rod structure for α-MnO2, whereas, δ-MnO2 (Fig. 3(b)) shows 2D flakes of a few nanometers in thickness. The presence of both 1D rod structures of α-MnO2 and 2D flakes of δ-MnO2 in Fig. 3(c) indicates the successful formation of the composite, further supporting the SEM analysis. Fig. 3(d)–(f) presents the HRTEM images of α-MnO2, δ-MnO2 and composite (α + δ)-Mn11 along with the SAED patterns (inset), respectively. Fig. 3(d) shows the lattice fringes of α-MnO2 with an interlayer distance of 0.5 Å, indicating the (200) plane. The SAED pattern shows the monocrystalline nature of the rod. It also shows that the growth of the rod is toward the [001] direction (c-axis). Fig. 3(e) is the HRTEM image of δ-MnO2. The edges show the fringe patterns, with an interlayer spacing of 0.69 nm, corresponding to the (001) plane of δ-MnO2 and complementing the powder XRD data. The centres of the nanoflakes show the amorphous regions with no fringes. In the inset, the SAED patterns show diffused halo rings, attributed to the (200), (−112) and (020) planes. Fig. 3(f) shows the presence of flakes along with rods of δ-MnO2 and α-MnO2, respectively. The SAED patterns show rings as well as an array of spots, derived from δ-MnO2 and α-MnO2, respectively. This also indicates the synergism of the two single-phase MnO2 in the allomorphous composite (α + δ)-Mn11.32

Fig. 4 shows the XPS pattern of Mn 2p for MnO2-based catalysts. Fig. S1† displays the Mn 2p and O 1s spectra of all electrocatalysts. The deconvoluted Mn 2p spectra of α-, δ- and composite (α + δ)-Mn11, (α + δ)-Mn12 and (α + δ)-Mn21 are shown in Fig. 4(a)–(e), respectively. Fig. 4(a) shows two prominent peaks at 642.19 eV and 653.72 eV, which belong to the Mn (+4) valence state.33 Two small peaks at 644.59 eV and 657.04 eV are also present, indicating the presence of the Mn (+6) state, which can be attributed to the formation of K2MnO4. It is worth noting that when KMnO4 is used for the synthesis of MnO2, K+ ions get intercalated in the voids of MnO2, thus forming a small amount of K2MnO4.23Fig. 4(b) shows the Mn 2p spectrum of δ-MnO2 and indicates the presence of Mn(III) and Mn(II) along with Mn (+6) and Mn (+4). Mn 2p 3/2 was deconvoluted into the following peaks positioned at 640.11 eV, 640.98 eV, 642.18 eV and 644.85 eV for Mn(II), Mn(III), Mn (+4) and Mn (+6), respectively.34 A shake-up satellite peak was also observed at 648.63 eV. For more insight, when an electron loses its energy during the photo ejection process, it is plausible that this released energy is taken up by some other valence electron, which is also ultimately ejected, and appears as a satellite in the XPS spectrum.35 Mn 2p ½ was deconvoluted into peaks at 657.04 eV and 653.65 eV, which correspond to Mn (+6) and Mn (+4), respectively. The atomic percentages calculated for the various oxidation states of Mn are listed in Table S1.† A similar trend is observed in Fig. 4(c), which presents the Mn 2p spectra of (α + δ)-Mn11. Peaks at binding energies of 642.14 eV and 653.78 eV correspond to Mn (+4), whereas peaks at 643.52 eV and 656.98 eV belong to Mn (+6). Two additional peaks at 640.91 eV and 640.11 eV indicate the presence of Mn(III) and Mn(II), respectively, along with a satellite peak at 647.73 eV.36 The formation of the Mn(III) oxidation state is attributed to the Jahn–Teller distortion in MnO2 because of the substitution of Mn(IV) by Mn(III). There have also been reports about the substitution of Mn(IV) by Mn(II) in order to balance the negative charge in the MnO2 layers.12,37,38 The presence of multiple valence states of Mn leads to more defect formation, a greater number of electroactive sites and hence, the promotion of redox reactions.16 A similar trend is also observed in Fig. 4(d) and (e) for (α + δ)-Mn12 and (α + δ)-Mn21, respectively. Mn in oxidation states +2, +3, +4 and +6 were observed at binding energies of 640.29 eV, 641.21 eV, 642.30 eV and 645.35 eV, respectively. Table S1† shows that greater amounts of Mn(III) and Mn(II) defect sites are present in composite samples as compared to single-phase MnO2, which play an important role in enhancing the electroactive sites and the conductivity of the catalyst.31 Mn(III) possesses the d4 electronic configuration with three electrons in the t2g and one unpaired electron in the eg orbital. This single electron in the higher energy orbital (eg) is more delocalized and therefore responsible for greater mobility,39 which is the major contributory factor to the better performance of the composite.

The surface area of the catalyst is a key factor for deciding its catalytic activity. In order to calculate the surface area of the prepared catalysts, nitrogen adsorption–desorption studies were performed (Table S2†). The surface area of δ-MnO2 was found to be the highest because of its layered structure that has a 7 Å interlayer separation. The composite (α + δ)-Mn11, however, exhibited the smallest specific surface area, mainly because of the intermixing of planes of α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2. The pore radius calculated using the BJH method shows the mesoporous nature of the surface of the single-phase α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2, as well as the composite (α + δ)-Mn11. Mesopores can accelerate the penetration of electrolyte into the catalyst and increase the electrode–electrolyte interaction. This, in turn, can enhances the accumulation of electrical charges on the electrode-electrolyte interface and hence, the charge storage ability of the material.
Diffuse reflectance spectroscopic techniques were utilized in reflectance mode and the obtained values were converted to the Kubelka–Munk function to determine the bandgap of all the prepared materials along with the composites and are shown in Fig. 5(a). For better understanding, bar graph representations of the bandgap values were also plotted as shown in Fig. 5(b). All the prepared catalysts had bandgap values near 1.7 eV. It is worth noting that composite (α + δ)-Mn11 has a bandgap value between the α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2, which showed bandgaps of approximately 1.70 and 1.72 eV. The other composites (α + δ)-Mn12 and (α + δ)-Mn21 showed bandgaps of 1.68 eV and 1.69 eV, respectively, which are smaller than the parent α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2. The bandgaps clearly show the capability of MnO2 catalysts to utilize the major portion of sunlight, i.e., visible light (only 45–50% in the solar spectrum),40 and hence have the practical suitability for real-life applications. However, in polycrystalline semiconducting materials, the DRS technique overestimates the bandgap values because the nanocrystalline region between two crystallites sometimes absorbs at longer wavelengths.12 Thus, it can be concluded that the absorption of a higher wavelength of light might take place.

2. Electrochemical characterization
To investigate the bi-functional nature of the electrocatalysts, both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were performed. Rotating disc electrode (RDE, 5 mm diameter) measurements were carried out for the electrochemical analysis of catalysts in dilute alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH). For the preliminary investigation, cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were performed to identify the characteristics of the active material. Fig. S2† shows CV scans for α-MnO2, δ-MnO2, (α + δ)-Mn11, (α + δ)-Mn12 and (α + δ)-Mn21 in an O2 atmosphere by applying the potential range of +1 V to −1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The catalysts displayed well-defined oxidation and reduction peaks at 1.15 V (vs. RHE) and 0.53 V (vs. RHE) respectively. From the assessment of the oxidation and reduction peaks, it is clear that α-MnO2 displayed higher oxidation and reduction currents than δ-MnO2, indicating its superior ability to catalyze the OER and ORR as compared to δ-MnO2; however, the double-layer capacitance region of δ-MnO2 was wider than that of α-MnO2. In the case of the composites (α + δ)-Mn11, (α + δ)-Mn12 and (α + δ)-Mn21, it was observed that the oxidation and reduction currents were comparable to α-MnO2 and the double layer capacitance region was even wider than both single-phase MnO2. This may be attributed to the synergistic effect of the single-phase MnO2 materials. It was also predicted that the composite catalyst may exhibit better performance in energy storage, as well as conversion, than the other two MnO2 materials. To assess the OER and ORR abilities of the samples, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) studies were performed in N2 and O2 atmospheres, respectively.
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
The ORR activity of the catalysts was investigated by performing LSV studies in the potential range of 0.2 V to −0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and applying rotation from 0 to 1600 rpm. Fig. 6(a) shows LSV polarization curves for α-, δ- and composite (α + δ)-Mn11, (α + δ)-Mn12 and (α + δ)-Mn21 taken at 900 rpm in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, in comparison with RuO2 and the state of the art catalyst Pt/C. Here, the (α + δ)-MnO2 composites showed lower overpotentials (or better onset potentials) than the pure MnO2 materials, nearly the same as that of commercial RuO2. The trend followed in terms of onset potential (vs. RHE) is as follows:

(b) LSV curves of the (α + δ)-Mn11 composite for ORR activity taken at different rotation rates in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution. (c) K–L plots at various potentials for the (α + δ)-Mn11 composite. (d) Bar graph indicating the specific activity and mass activity of all the catalysts in comparison with commercial Pt/C taken at −0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). 

Pt/C (1.00 V) > RuO2 (0.880 V) = composites (α + δ)-MnO2 (0.880 V) > α-MnO2 (0.866 V) > δ-MnO2 (0.794 V).All the (α + δ)-MnO2 composites, showed the same onset potential (0.88 V vs. RHE). In terms of half-wave potential (E1/2) and diffusion-limited current density, composites of (α + δ)-MnO2 showed better performance than the pure MnO2 materials. Moreover, as compared to the state-of-the-art catalyst Pt/C, composite MnO2 showed poor E1/2 but higher diffusion-limited current density.
The trend followed in terms of diffusion limited current density (in mA cm−2) at 0.4 V (vs. RHE) is as follows:(α + δ)-Mn11 (−2.01 V) > (α + δ)-Mn12 (−1.45 V) > Pt/C (−1.08 V) > RuO2 (−1.05 V) > α-MnO2 (−0.78 V) > (α + δ)-Mn21 (−0.75 V) > δ-MnO2 (−0.37 V).Fig. 6(b) shows polarization plots of (α + δ)-Mn11 depicting the ORR capability at various rotation rates. The diffusion-limited current density increased with increasing rotation rates as more oxygen reached the electrode surface.
To understand the kinetics of the ORR, the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation was followed:1/I = 1/Ik + 1/Ilevwhere I = disk current density; Ik = kinetic current density and Ilev = Levich current density.
Further, Ik and Ilev can be expressed as follows:Ik = nFAkO2CO2γcatalystIlev = 0.62nFACO2CO22/3v−1/6ω1/2where n = number of electrons transferred during the ORR; F = Faraday's constant (96485 C mol−1); A = area of the electrode (0.19 cm2); kO2 = rate constant for the ORR (ms−1); CO2 = the concentration of dissolved oxygen (1.21 mol m−3 in 0.1 M KOH); γcatalyst = the surface concentration of the catalyst (102 μg cm−2); DO2 = the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in solution (1.87 × 10−9 m2 s−1 in 0.1 M KOH); ν = kinematic viscosity (1 × 10–6 m2 s−1 in 0.1 M KOH), and ω = the angular frequency of rotation (rad s−1). From the intercept of the K–L plot, the kinetic current (Ik) can be calculated.

Fig. 6(c) shows the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots for the (α + δ)-Mn11 catalyst taken in the potential range of 0.7 to 0.2 V (vs. RHE). Here, the linear nature of the plot indicates first-order kinetics for the ORR. From the parallel nature of the slopes, it was concluded that the number of electrons transferred (n) was almost constant and equal to four.
The following mechanism has been proposed for the ORR by MnO2 catalyst via a 4-electron pathway forming MnOOH as an intermediate:41MnO2 + H2O + e− ↔ MNOOH + OH−2MnOOH + O2 ↔ (MnOOH)2–O2,ads(MnOOH)2–O2,ads + e− ↔ MnOOH–O2,ads + OH− + MnO2MnOOH–O2,ads + e− ↔ MnO2 + OH−To study the stability of the catalyst, chronoamperometry was performed at potential −0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and rotation 900 rpm with continuous oxygen purging. Fig. S3† depicts the chronoamperometry study of (α + δ)-Mn11, α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2, respectively. It was found to stable for continuous 8 hours with only 37.52% degradation in the activity. However, this can be easily correlated with the stability of its components, i.e. α- and δ-MnO2, which were also stable and displayed 48.77% and 27.60% degradation, respectively, after 8 hours. Fig. 6(d) presents a bar graph comparing the specific activity and mass activity of all MnO2 samples with commercial Pt/C. (α + δ)-Mn11 showed higher specific activity, as well as mass activity, as compared to Pt/C, indicating its superior properties. This shows that the (α + δ)-Mn11 composite has compensated for the structural and electronic limitations, such as low conductivity and low ion diffusion constant, that the single-phase MnO2 suffers from. Thus, the allomorphous composite increases the conductivity and shortens the ion diffusion path, and so, presents better activity.
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
For assessing the OER, LSV studies were performed by applying potential in the range 0 to +1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with rotation from 0 to 1600 rpm using 1 M KOH electrolyte purged with N2 gas for an inert atmosphere. Fig. 7(a) shows polarization curves corresponding to the OER activity at 900 rpm for all the catalysts in comparison with RuO2 and Pt/C. The MnO2-based catalysts showed almost the same onset potential but, (α + δ)-Mn11 clearly displayed better OER activity than α- and δ-MnO2 and composites (α + δ)-Mn12 and (α + δ)-Mn21, as evident from the overpotential (ηJ=10). In terms of overpotential, the trend is as follows:
 Fig. 7  Oxygen evolution electrochemical analysis: (a) comparative polarization plots for OER activity taken at 900 rpm in N2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. (b) Tafel slope comparison for all catalysts. (c) Plots showing the bifunctionality of MnO2 catalysts. (d) Bar graph showing the potential difference ΔE for (α + δ)-Mn11 and α-MnO2 in comparison with RuO2. 

RuO2 (η = 422 mV) < (α + δ)-Mn11 (η = 586 mV) < α-MnO2 (η = 634 mV) ≪ Pt/C ≈ δ-MnO2 ≈ (α + δ)-Mn21 ≈ (α + δ)-Mn12The OER performances for Pt/C, δ-MnO2, (α + δ)-Mn21 and (α + δ)-Mn12 were negligible in comparison to the other three catalysts. (α + δ)-Mn11 had a lower overpotential with the difference of only 164 mV as compared to that of the state-of-the-art catalyst RuO2, indicating the bifunctionality of (α + δ)-Mn11 as both the ORR and OER catalysts. To study the kinetics of the OER, Tafel plots were also drawn (Fig. 7(b)). δ-MnO2 showed a higher Tafel slope (134 mV dec−1) than α-MnO2 (106 mV dec−1) but (α + δ)-Mn11 had an even higher Tafel slope of 139 mV dec−1. This higher Tafel slope value may be attributed to a small oxidation peak before the onset potential for all MnO2 samples. This oxidation peak is stronger for the composite, hence a higher Tafel slope was obtained for it. The Tafel value for Pt/C and RuO2 were calculated as 90 mV dec−1 and 75 mV dec−1, respectively.
In MnO2, under alkaline medium, the OER occurred via a one-electron one-proton PCET pathway.42 The composite MnO2 surface was rich in Mn(III)/Mn(IV) groups in alkaline pH, which are suggested to be the active species participating in the OER.43 The proposed mechanism is as follows:42Mn(III)–OH → Mn(IV)OMn(IV)O + 2 termal oxygen atoms → O2
Bi-functionality of (α + δ)-MnO2

Fig. 7(c) shows the overall OER-ORR polarization curve showing the bi-functional nature of all MnO2 samples. The potential difference (ΔE) was taken as the difference in potential at −0.3 mA cm−2 for the ORR and 10 mA cm−2 for the OER. δ-MnO2 showed a large ΔE value as compared to (α + δ)-Mn11 (1.09 V) and α-MnO2 (1.16 V) (Fig. 7(d)). This smaller value of ΔE dictates that (α + δ)-Mn11 performs better ORR-OER catalysis as compared to α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2; this indicates that synergism enhances the activity. Moreover, the proper alignment of rods of α-MnO2 helps to provide well-ordered tunnel structures and hence, active sites for the reaction to proceed.44 This is evident in the case of other composites (α + δ)-Mn12 and (α + δ)-Mn21, which are also composed of α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2 but they lack the proper synergism, due to which enhancement in the electrical conductivity was not observed.
Zinc–air battery
(α + δ)-Mn11 presented the best bifunctional activity as compared to the other (α + δ)-Mn21 and (α + δ)-Mn12 composites, so for practical applications, the (α + δ)-Mn11 catalyst was further utilized in fabricating a rechargeable Zn–air battery. For comparison, α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2 were also used. The analysis was performed in ambient air and light conditions.
Open-circuit potential (OCP) values exhibited by (α + δ)-Mn11, α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2 were 1.46 V, 1.32 V and 1.31 V, respectively. Fig. 8(a) shows the current density–voltage polarization curve, obtained by varying the current from 0 to 100 mA. The voltage difference (ΔV) while charging and discharging the battery at the current density of 20 mA cm−2 for (α + δ)-Mn11 (1.28 V) was lower as compared to δ-MnO2 (2.03 V) and α-MnO2 (3.02 V). This shows that (α + δ)-Mn11 has a better charge–discharge cycle ability than both the bare MnO2. The power density curve was also plotted as shown in Fig. 8(b). It also indicates that (α + δ)-Mn11 has a higher charge storage ability than α- and δ-MnO2, as depicted by the higher power density obtained for (α + δ)-Mn11 (28.53 mW cm−2) than δ-MnO2 (15.77 mW cm−2) and α-MnO2 (6.91 mW cm−2). To evaluate the cyclic efficiency and durability of the MnO2-based catalysts, cyclic charge–discharge characteristics (C–D) were determined at a constant current density of 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 8(c)). The catalysts were found to be stable at 20 mA cm−2 for 200 minutes of continuous usage with 5 minutes of charging and 5 min discharging time cycles. The flat potential curve and constant voltage difference are indicators of good stability and higher cyclic life of the MnO2 electrode materials. However, the voltage difference (ΔV) comparison between the electrode materials showed that (α + δ)-Mn11 had a smaller C–D voltage drop (2.47 V) than α-MnO2 (2.83 V) and δ-MnO2 (2.64 V). A smaller ΔV indicates better reversibility for applications in rechargeable Zn–air batteries. (α + δ)-Mn11 exhibited round trip efficiency (RTE) of 17.02% as compared to α-MnO2 (8.05%) and δ-MnO2 (19.42%) as calculated at the 10th C–D cycle. To evaluate the stability and to determine the specific capacity of the battery, discharge curves plotted at a constant current density of 5 mA cm−2 were compared for the MnO2 cathode electrode materials. In Fig. 8(d) (α + δ)-Mn11 showed a suitable and stable long-term plot. For (α + δ)-Mn11, the voltage plateau was observed at around 1.17 V and the specific capacity was calculated as 715 mA h g−1 (normalized to the mass of Zn electrode consumed). The energy density comes was 841.55 W h kg−1 (as compared to the theoretical energy density of 1086 W h kg−1). On the other hand, α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2 lacked proper long-term stability. δ-MnO2 was stable for nearly 19 hours with a voltage plateau at 0.85 V and a specific capacity of 670.63 mA h g−1 (normalized to the mass of Zn electrode consumed). This corresponds to an energy density of 576.74 W h kg−1. For α-MnO2, the voltage plateau was observed at 0.98 V, with a specific capacity of 710 mA h g−1 and an energy density of 698.64 W h kg−1. Overall, (α + δ)-Mn11 possessed a higher specific capacity and energy density as compared to α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2. Fig. 8(e) shows a solid-state device prepared by putting two electrodes in series to light a green LED. The solid-state device was charged by providing a current density of 1.20 mA cm−2 for 3 minutes, and the device was discharged by allowing the LED to glow for around 3 minutes. Fig. 8(f) shows a table containing various values of ΔV obtained from polarization plots, power density, ΔV obtained from charge–discharge cycles and the specific capacity obtained for (α + δ)-Mn11, α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2. Clearly, (α + δ)-Mn11 showed superior properties as compared to the two bare MnO2 electrodes. Table S3 in the ESI† presents a brief literature review of MnO2-based materials used as cathodes for Zn–air battery application.

In a rechargeable Zn–air battery, the possible charging mechanism is as follows:454OH− → O2 + H2O + 4e−(Cathode)Followed by discharging, O2 + H2O + 4e− → 4OH−(cathode)At the anode, during discharging, Zn + 4OH− → Zn(OH)42− + 2e−During charging, Zn(OH)42− + 2e− → Zn + 4OH−
Photoinduced zinc–air battery
To explore the photoactivity of the Zn–air battery, the electrode (α + δ)-Mn11 was examined under visible light and dark conditions in alkaline electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 9. The OER and ORR activities were recorded at 900 rpm in 1 M KOH and 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, respectively, in light and dark conditions as shown in Fig. 9(a). A higher current was observed under light conditions in both the ORR and OER processes. ΔE was calculated as the difference in potential recorded at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (for the OER) and −0.3 mA cm−2 (for the ORR). This ΔE value was 90 mV lower (or 7.20% better) in light conditions. This indicates that the (α + δ)-Mn11 material was photocatalytically active and can be utilized in rechargeable Zn–air batteries. The photocatalytic activity of (α + δ)-Mn11 is attributed to the d–d transitions of electrons under light conditions, which reduced the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and enhanced the current. Fig. 9(b) and (c) show the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots corresponding to the ORR and OER, depicting the scenario of the electrode–electrolyte interface under light and dark conditions at −0.3 V and 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. Reduction in the Rct was observed during light conditions, which further elucidated the photoactivity of the (α + δ)-Mn11 material.

To explore the photoactivity of the (α + δ)-Mn11 material in the rechargeable Zn–air battery, the (α + δ)-Mn11 electrode coated on C paper was examined under visible light and dark conditions using 6 M KOH + 0.2 M ZnCl2 electrolyte. Fig. 9(d) shows the polarization plot and it can be seen that the electrode performs better in the presence of visible light as MnO2 is a photoactive material. At the current density of 20 mA cm−2, the difference in voltage between charging and discharging (ΔV) was greater for dark conditions than under the conditions of illumination. Carbon paper substrate is a conducting material that does not block the light particles to activate the MnO2 material. Enhancement in the power density was also observed from 4.40 mW cm−2 to 28.60 mW cm−2 under illumination conditions, which accounted for the roughly 5.5 times increase (Fig. 9(e)). The photoactivity of (α + δ)-Mn11 was further illustrated by repeated charge–discharge cycles at the current density of 20 mA cm−2 for light and dark conditions (Fig. 9(f)). Stable plateaus and a constant ΔV value (for light, ΔV = 2.06 V and for dark, ΔV = 2.23 V) were observed (i.e., 7.62% enhancement in activity), which further supported the higher activity of the photoinduced Zn–air battery performance with the (α + δ)-Mn11 cathode electrode. Under illumination, (α + δ)-Mn11 exhibited 26.77% RTE. On the contrary, RTE dropped to 20.61% during dark conditions, indicating a 29.89% enhancement during light conditions.
The possible mechanism of a photoenhanced rechargeable Zn–air battery is described as follows:19,45Charging process: Photoelectrode + hv → e− + h+4OH− + 4h+ → O2 + 2H2O(cathode)Followed by discharging, O2 + H2O + 4e− → 4OH−(cathode)At the anode, during discharging, Zn + 4OH− → Zn(OH)42− + 2e−Zn(OH)42− + 2e− → Zn + 4OH−Zn(OH)42− → ZnO + H2O + OH−  
Post-battery analysis
We further evaluated the post-charging and post-discharging products in order to study the mechanism of the Zn–air battery by performing XPS as shown in Fig. S4.† XPS analysis was carried out for the cathode (α + δ)-Mn11 coated on carbon paper before performing any analysis (i.e., unused), after the charging process, and after the discharging process. Fig. S4(a)† shows the Mn 2p spectrum of unused (α + δ)-Mn11. The highest peak obtained at the binding energy of 642.46 eV corresponds to Mn(IV), as also observed in Fig. 4(c), where it was found to belong to MnO2. There was a visible shift in the peak of Mn(IV) towards higher binding energy for the after-charging and after-discharging products (Fig. S4(b) and (c)†). This suggests a possible change in the oxidation state of Mn(IV) to a higher oxidation state or the interaction of Mn with some more electronegative element than oxygen. There have been reports on the changes in the oxidation state of Mn during charging and discharging but it was mostly towards the lower binding energy, because of the formation of Mn(III) or Mn(II) in the form of Mn2O3, Mn3O4, γ-MnOOH, etc.46–48 Moreover, from the survey spectrum of bare carbon paper (Fig. S5†), it was observed that C paper contained a large amount of fluorine (27.58 atomic%) in it. The source of this fluorine is usually the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; represented as (CF2)n) coating on commercial C paper.49 Hence, it is possible that during the bond-breaking in the charging and discharging processes, the incorporation of fluorine into the MnO2 lattice might have taken place, and therefore the shifting of the Mn 2p peak towards higher binding energy was observed. A similar observation of the introduction of F into MnO2 lattice was also made by Barreca et al.50 Mn-Based fluorides like MnF2 are excellent anode materials for lithium-ion battery applications.51 Moreover, C paper has a porous network of carbon-based fibers that provide a higher surface area for electrode–electrolyte interactions.49 The galvanostatic C–D behaviour (Fig. 9(f)) showed stable plateaus and a constant ΔV value, which suggests that the presence of fluorides in the cathode electrode does not affect the battery activity much. It was supposed that during battery performance, the mechanism might have been as follows.
Mechanism
The crystalline nature of α-MnO2 might be the reason for its better ORR and OER activity as compared to δ-MnO2. δ-MnO2 has a layered structure, suitable for intercalating ions. Moreover, it has the Mn(III) valence state, which has been reported as a particularly important species for catalysis, along with Mn(IV) and Mn(II). As (α + δ)-Mn11 is composed of both α- and δ-MnO2, the greater ORR and OER catalytic properties of the composite are a clear demonstration of the positive synergism between α- and δ-MnO2, which is responsible for its enhanced activity.
The crystal structure, 2D flake-like morphology and surface area of δ-MnO2 are favorable for the energy storage system. The layered structure forms a channel and allows the electrolyte and air to interact with the catalyst material.52 This three-phase boundary system, liquid, air, solid-formation, increases the interaction and allows the dissolution and diffusion of oxygen, which is beneficial for the proper charge–discharge mechanism of the Zn–air battery. The rod-type structure provides support and a route for charge transport, and the 2D nanoflakes provide a greater surface area and a larger electrode–electrolyte interface.34 Thus, the existence of MnO2 in two different dimensional morphologies also plays a role in enhancing its activity. α-MnO2 also possesses a comparatively smaller amount of charge storage space in its tunnel structure. The higher surface area and larger interlayer separation of δ-MnO2 as compared to α-MnO2 might contribute more for greater charge storage capability in (α + δ)-Mn11. The existence of two dimensions also contributes to significantly high activity. Overall, (α + δ)-Mn11 showed greater charge storage capability than both of its constituent MnO2 materials.
The semiconducting properties of MnO2 played a very important role in photo-enhanced Zn–air battery applications. The optical bandgap of the (α + δ)-Mn11 composite was found to be 1.7 eV, which is suitable for the absorption of visible light and helped in improving the photoelectrochemical performance of the battery. It can be concluded that the composite MnO2 catalyst, when irradiated with photons having energy greater than 1.71 eV, can demonstrate electron–hole pair generation and can participate in redox oxygen reactions. Upon light irradiation, electrons get excited from the valence band/O 2p to the conduction band/Mn 3d and thus produce holes and electrons in the valence band and conduction band, respectively, which can be further utilized in several redox reactions like the ORR and OER.
Conclusions
A composite of α and δ-MnO2 has been prepared, which has shown superior activity in Zn–air batteries as compared to its individual constituents α and δ-MnO2. The blending of tunnels containing 1D nanorods of α-MnO2 and 2D nanoflakes of δ-MnO2 provides a unique approach to creating bifunctional catalysts for rechargeable Zn–air batteries, regenerative fuel cells and supercapacitors. The fabrication of the photo-enhanced Zn–air battery using the composite MnO2 demonstrates the capability of MnO2 as a photoactive cathode material for rechargeable Zn–air batteries. The bifunctional oxygen electrode activity was significantly improved by 7.20% in the presence of light as compared to that in the dark. It also exhibited the lowering of the potential difference for charging and discharging by 7.62%, indicating the positive role of light illumination on battery performance. This approach shows a new direction towards the positive synergism between different phases of materials and the development of similar kinds of photoactive composites for other oxide materials for the utilization of solar light for energy storage.
