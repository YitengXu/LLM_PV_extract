    , Accepted 25th August 2022First published on 25th August 2022AbstractIn everyday life, superior lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), with fast charging ability, have become valuable assets. The LIB performance of an anode composite copper cobalt tin sulphide (Cu2CoSnS4; CCTS) electrode, which was fabricated using a simple and easy hydrothermal method, was investigated. The electrochemical charge storage performance of the CCTS anode demonstrated sustainability, high-rate capability and efficiency. The CCTS anode exhibited a first discharge capacity of 914.5 mA h g−1 and an average specific capacity of 198.7 mA h g−1 in consecutive cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. It had a capacity retention of ∼62.0% and a coulombic efficiency of more than 83% after over 100 cycles, demonstrating its excellent cycling performance and reversibility. It can be an alternative anode to other established electrode materials for real battery applications.
Introduction
The lithium-ion battery (LIB) is a crucial device for storing and transmitting renewable energy produced from wind, solar and tidal sources.1 LIBs have a major part in popular daily-use electronic devices and electric vehicles, and they also have outstanding properties such as environmental friendliness, high energy density and an extended cycling life without memory effects.2 LIBs are becoming increasingly popular in the automotive market because of their applications in powering electric vehicles and the shortage of fossil energy sources. However, LIBs have lower energy density than that for conventional combustion engines. Therefore, the search for energy technologies to balance the demand and supply of energy has become an urgent necessity. The anode in LIBs is crucial because it determines the overall energy and stability of the battery. Although silicon anodes have a large theoretical specific capacity, they are ineffective because of their severe volume expansion (more than 300%) during the lithiation and delithiation processes.3 Moreover, graphite is a widely studied anode because of its low cost and chemical stability, but its theoretical capacity is extremely low (372 mA h g−1) and has sluggish kinetics.4 Thus, various substances have been investigated as promising alternative anode materials for LIBs.5–18
Tin is known to be an optimum anode due to its high theoretical capacity of 994 mA h g−1, while being inexpensive and non-toxic. For LIBs, alloy-type materials and metal chalcogenides are considered outstanding because of their high theoretical reversible charge storage capacity.19 Binary metal chalcogenides, such as MoS2, WS2 and ReS2, have remarkable potential, but their poor electrical conductivity causes serious issues.20 Nevertheless, they have stability issues due to structural failure, volume expansion during the charging–discharging processes and low conductivity, all of which limit their practical use. Therefore, it has become important to fabricate alternative anodes for LIBs with high energy density and conductivity. Various mechanisms, such as morphology or surface modification, heteroatom doping and encapsulation with carbon-based materials, have been investigated to overcome this problem. Among these mechanisms, heteroatom doping is the most common method for improving the conductivity of materials. Thus, chalcogen materials have attracted significant attention as a dopant for improving the conductivity and stability of LIB alloy-type materials.21,22 Recently, quaternary compounds, such as copper zinc tin sulphide (Cu2ZnSnS4; CZTS), have attracted significant attention as novel and emerging anode materials for Li-ion batteries23–26 because they are cost-effective, earth-abundant, environmentally friendly, and structurally/chemically stable.23 The presence of Sn and Zn, which are electrochemically active, leads to multiple lithiation reactions, while the multi-metal structure offers additional structural flexibility, including a buffer matrix for volume expansion, that allows them to be compositionally engineered to enhance electrochemical performance. Various CZTS morphologies have been fabricated using spray pyrolysis, Rf-magnetron sputtering, electrodeposition, and hot injection. Although the structural and electrochemical properties of CZTS are similar to those of copper cobalt tin sulphide (Cu2CoSnS4; CCTS), the LIB performance of the CCTS anode materials has rarely been investigated. This is an important research topic because the synergetic effect between the metal elements in CCTS may generate outstanding properties or functionalities for LIB applications. Therefore, the synergetic effect between various metal atoms may produce novel properties or functionalities in CCTS as a new material for LIB applications.
In this study, we have used the easy hydrothermal method to synthesise LIB anode electrodes with quaternary CCTS compounds. This anode displays an average specific capacity of 198.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. Furthermore, its coulombic efficiency and capacity retention are observed to be 83% and ∼62.0%, respectively. Its sustainability after over 100 charge–discharge cycles suggests that it is promising as an anode electrode for real battery applications.
Experimental
Synthesis of CCTS
A CCTS anode was synthesised via a hydrothermal technique, followed by slurry coating using a doctor blade technique. Chemicals such as copper chloride, cobalt chloride, tin chloride pentahydrate, thiourea and ethylene glycol were received as raw materials and used without any purification. A precursor solution was prepared in 50 mL of ethylene glycol with 0.5 mM copper chloride, 0.25 mM cobalt chloride, 0.25 mM tin chloride pentahydrate and 1.25 mM thiourea. It was mixed thoroughly using a magnetic stirrer for 10 min. The precursor solution was poured into a hydrothermal Teflon autoclave jar. The autoclave jar was kept in a furnace at 220 °C for 24 h and then left to cool to room temperature. The resulting product was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min and the collected powder was dehydrated in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h. Finally, the powder was ground for 3 h using an agate mortar.
Characterisation
The structural properties were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements obtained by an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical's X'pert PRO system, Netherlands). It had Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength λ = 1.54056 Å. Raman measurements were carried out at an excitation wavelength of 514 nm using a Labram Aramis spectrometer made by Horiba Jobin. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (model JSM-6701F, JEOL, made in Japan) was used for surface morphology and compositional analyses. The accelerating voltage during these measurements was 15 kV. A JEM 2010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd, made in Japan) and an EDX detector (Oxford Instruments) were used for detailed structural analysis. During these measurements, the acceleration voltage was 300 kV and the camera length was 255.8 mm. The chemical oxidation states of the quaternary composite electrode were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (model Ulvac-phi, Verse probe II).
LIB fabrication and testing
A coin cell assembly of type CR2032 was used to fabricate LIBs using CCTS as an anode. Cu foil was used as a current collector for the CCTS anode. A slurry was prepared with a composition of CCTS (80%), a binder (10% polyvinylidene fluoride in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) and conducting carbon black (10%). The doctor blade technique was used to coat the CCTS slurry uniformly on the Cu foil. It was subsequently dehydrated overnight at 60 °C for 24 h. A coin cell was made using a CCTS disc (15 mm) as the anode and a Li metal disc as the counter electrode in a glove box. The glove box was filled with a highly pure inert gas such as argon. A 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte with a 1:1 volume ratio of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate was used. The electrochemical properties, such as charging–discharging in the galvanostatic mode, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and alternating current (AC) impedance analyses, were carried out using a battery cycler model MPG-2 made by Bio-Logic Science Instruments, in France.
Results and discussion
The structural analysis of the as-prepared CCTS powder is shown in Fig. 1(a) with the standard JCPDS data (no. 26-0513). The strong diffraction peaks at 2θ angles of 16.23°, 28.43°, 38.16°, 39.53°, 47.67°, 50.15° and 56.36° indicate reflections along the (002), (112), (211), (114), (204), (006) and (312) plane directions, respectively, which are assigned to the formation of phase-pure tetragonal CCTS. It has lattice parameters of a = 5.402 Å and c = 10.80 Å. Our XRD result is corresponds with the findings of Wang et al.27–29 The other diffraction peaks that do not belong to CCTS are ascribed to the secondary phases of SnS (26.6°, 31.3°, 46.6°, and 51.4°, JCPDS-39-0354), CuS (32.1°, JCPDS-79-2321), Cu2O (36.0°, JCPDS-05-0667), and SnO2 (54.7°, JCPDS-001-0625).30,31 The Raman technique was used to confirm the purity or to detect the secondary phases in the CCTS structure. Fig. 1(b) depicts the Raman measurement data of the as-prepared CCTS powder sample. The Raman spectrum has a wide peak at wavelengths between 280 and 400 cm−1. The deconvolution of the broad peak reveals two peaks at 313.7 and 334.0 cm−1, which are linked to the symmetric vibrations in chalcopyrites such as CCTS.32

The morphology and composition analyses of the CCTS powder sample were conducted using SEM and EDX. Fig. 1(c) and Fig. S1(a) and (b) (ESI†) depict the SEM images of the as-prepared CCTS powder. The images display a large CCTS sheet and overgrown nanograins. Fig. 1(d) depicts the EDX measurement data of the CCTS powder, providing evidence for the existence of Cu, Co, Sn and S. Fig. S2† depicts the SEM image where the EDX spectra were recorded as well as its original spectra. The atomic ratio Cu:Co:Sn:S was found to be 2.77:1.0:1.56:3.82.
The CCTS sample was also investigated by TEM measurements (Fig. 2(a)–(g)). A granular structure within a nanometer range can be observed in Fig. 2(a). The SAED pattern shown in Fig. 2(b) depicts clear rings associated with the major diffraction peaks of the (002), (004), (112) and (110) planes, suggesting that the CCTS structure has high crystallinity (JCPDS-26-0513). Clear lattice fringes are visible in the HRTEM images shown in Fig. 2(c)–(e). The lattice distances between the two fringes are found to be 0.32 nm and 0.27 nm, which are associated with the (1 1 2) and (0 0 4) reflections, respectively, of the quaternary CCTS structure. These lattice distances are identical to the standard lattice spacing data provided in JCPDS-26-0513, indicating the formation of the desired composite structure. The HAADF-STEM and EDX mapping images for CCTS in Fig. 2(f) reveal that Cu, Co, Sn, and S are present in the sample. The STEM elemental line scan profiles in Fig. 2(g) and the image in Fig. S3† also disclose the same results.

Fig. 3(a)–(d) show the deconvoluted XPS spectra of Cu 2p, Co 2p, Sn 3d and S 2p, whereas Fig. S4† shows the survey spectra. The presence of N and O in the survey spectra is possibly due to air contamination. The core-level deconvoluted Cu 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(a)) displays two peaks at 932.6 eV (Cu 2p3/2) and 953.1 eV (Cu 2p1/2). The distance between these two peaks is found to be 20.5 eV, suggesting the existence of Cu1+ in the sample.33 The peaks observed in the deconvoluted Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(b)) at 782.08 eV and 794.6 eV are due to Co 2p3/2 and its satellite, respectively. It is due to the presence of Co2+ oxidation states in the CCTS sample.34,35 The deconvoluted Sn 3d spectrum (Fig. 3(c)) displays peaks at 486.05 eV (3d 5/2) and 494.6 eV (3d 3/2) that are associated with Sn2+ whereas the peaks at 487.03 eV (3d 5/2) and 495.3 eV (3d 3/2) are due to Sn4+ oxidation states.36 The S 2p spectrum shown in Fig. 3(d) showed four peaks, two of which are located at 161.64 eV (2p3/2) and 162.9 eV (2p1/2), and are due to the sulphide phase. Conversely, the other peaks shown at 169.0 eV are due to the sulphonate formed by the sulphonation reaction with oxygen and air contamination.37,38

The first four CV curves measured at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the potential window of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) are displayed in Fig. 4(a). The observed difference in the CV shape of the first and following cycles is associated with the structural modification, cell polarisation and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation.5,6 The first CV curve (Fig. S5†) shows multiple cathodic and anodic peaks (indicated by arrows), which are associated with the multistep electrochemical lithium reaction processes and structural rearrangement during the initial surge of Li2+ ions. The broad reduction peaks observed at 1.20 V and 0.50 V (vs. Li/Li+) are due to the irreversible conversion of Li2S and the reduction of Cu, Co, and Sn, which is caused by the intercalation of Li+ ions into the CCTS, whereas the peak near 0.2 V is due to the formation of LixSn. During the reverse scan, the peaks at 0.54 V, 1.12 V, 1.94 V, and 2.39 V are due to the reversible reactions (i.e., the dealloying process) between Sn, Cu, Co, and Li.39 In subsequent cycles, the cathodic peaks at 1.41 V and 0.79 V (vs. Li/Li+) are attributed to the intercalation of Li2+ or the multistep reduction and conversion processes of LixCu2CoSnS4 in the metallic phases of Cu, Co, and Sn.40,41 The anodic peaks at 0.54 V and 1.12 V (vs. Li/Li+) are associated with the dealloying of LixSn and LixCu. The anodic peaks at 0.54 V and 1.12 V (vs. Li/Li+) are associated with the dealloying of LixSn and LixCo. The reaction mechanism during the lithiation process can be described as follows: Cu2CoSnS4 + 8Li+ + 8e− → 2Cu + Co + Sn + 4Li2S(1) Sn + 4.4Li+ + 4.4e− → Li4.4Sn(2) Co + 1.5Li+ + 4.4e− → Li1.5Co(3)

(b) Galvanostatic charge–discharge characteristics of the CCTS electrode recorded at a current of 0.1 A g−1 for the first five cycles. (c) Rate performances of the CCTS electrode at different currents. 

Fig. 4(b) depicts the first five galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves measured at an applied current rate of 0.1 A g−1. The sloping voltage plateaus seen during discharging and charging are due to the lithiation and delithiation processes, respectively. The first discharge capacity of CCTS is found to be 914.5 mA h g−1, which decreased to 198.7 mA h g−1. Thus, capacity loss is expected due to the polarisation and the formation of the SEI layer. This irreversible SEI process showed an initial capacity loss in subsequent cycles. In the discharge curve the plateaus seen at 1.41 V and 0.80 V correspond to two cathodic peaks seen in CV, followed by a tail. When the scan is reversed, two plateaus appear at 0.54 V and 1.12 V, which are ascribed to the reverse course of the conversion reaction.42 The overlap of the GCD curves in the subsequent cycle indicates excellent cycling stability. Fig. 4(c) shows the rate and cycling performances of the CCTS anode at various current densities (0.1 A g−1 and 1.0 A g−1). The initial discharge capacity is 914.5 mA h g−1, which suddenly reduces to 198.7 mA h g−1 over consecutive cycles. Thereafter, the charge–discharge capacity becomes stable at each measured current up to 1.0 A g−1. Interestingly, the average discharge capacity of 149.7 mA h g−1 is obtained when the reversed current density of 0.1 A g−1 is applied. A high-capacity retention of 75.3% is obtained at different current densities.
We conducted ex situ XPS, XRD, and SEM analyses in fully discharged (to 0.1 V) and fully charged (to 3.0 V) states to understand the mechanisms associated with the insertion/extraction of Li2+. Fig. 5(a–d) presents the XPS spectra of the CCTS anode in its original, fully discharged, and fully charged states. Cu 2p (Fig. 5a) in the discharged state exhibits three peaks at 932.31, 934.01, and 952.8 eV associated with the Cu1+, Cu2+, and metallic Cu0 states, respectively.33 The additional peak at 934.01 eV is presumably due to the oxidation of the Cu species in air. In the charged state, the Cu metallic peak disappears suggesting a reversible reaction to its original Cu1+ state. This behaviour is due to the reversible insertion/extraction of Li2+ into/from the CCTS anode. The changes in the XPS data during the discharge process can be ascribed to the redox reaction from Cu1+ to Cu0. In the Sn 3d spectra (Fig. 5c), the peaks at 485.9 and 494.6 eV observed in the original sample disappear in the charged and discharged states, suggesting the formation of irreversible Sn4+ (487.1 and 495.6 eV) states in the sample.36 The S 2p spectra (Fig. 5d) of the original sample show peaks at 161.6 and 162.7 eV, which disappear in the discharged and charged states, and a broad peak at 169.7 appears, which is due to the sulphonate that forms due to the reaction between Li2+ and trace amounts of oxygen and water.37,38 Therefore, it can be concluded that Sn and S are not involved in the reduction reaction. The Co 2p spectra (Fig. 5b) also appear to be inactive during the charging–discharging process. To gain more insight into the electrochemical reaction mechanisms within the CCTS anode, ex situ XRD measurements are performed in the fully discharged (to 0.01 V) and fully charged (to 3.0 V) states (Fig. S6a†). The complete disappearance of the major characteristic diffraction peak at 28.57° (112) in CCTS is suggestive of the restructuring of the electrode and the formation of alloys during the first charge–discharge cycle. The XRD patterns in the discharged and charged states are consistent in their structure except for the differences in diffraction intensity, which are due to the reversible partial conversion of the electrode structure during the charge–discharge process. The surface morphology before and after LIB testing is presented in Fig. S6(b) and (c).† The granular surface of the pristine electrode becomes smooth during the charge–discharge process due to the formation of the SEI layer and Li plating. Thus, the absence of cracks reveals the excellent stability and controlled volume expansion of the CCTS electrode.

Long-term electrochemical stability tests were performed at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 over 100 cycles. Fig. 6(a) depicts the specific capacity and coulombic efficiency versus cycle number curves of the CCTS anode electrode for 100 cycles. The coulombic efficiency and the discharge and charge capacities after the first cycle are 79.1%, 118.0 mA h g−1, and 149.0 mA h g−1, respectively. The average coulombic efficiency of the CCTS anode is greater than 83% after over 100 charge–discharge cycles, indicating its excellent stability and reversibility. This coulombic efficiency is better than that of carbon anodes and other commercial anodes.43–45 The specific capacity decreases gradually for the first 50 cycles before stabilising after over 100 charge–discharge cycles. The CCTS anode electrode had ∼62.0% and ∼56.2%, discharge and charge capacity retentions, with a capacity loss of 0.38% and 0.43% per cycle.

Quantitative estimation is carried out via CV measurements at different scan rates to determine the capacitive and diffusion-limited contributions to the total capacity of the electrode. Fig. 6(b) presents the CV curves measured at different scan rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mV s−1. The cathodic and anodic currents obey the power law relationship with the scan rate. Thus, the Li-ion intercalation kinetics can be estimated using the following power law:6,45 i = a × νb(1)where a and b are the fitting parameters and ν is the scan rate. The slope of the plot log(i)–log(ν) gives information about the diffusion-controlled and capacitive-type storage mechanisms. Fig. S7† presents the log(i)–log(ν) plots, with the slopes for the cathodic and anodic currents estimated to be 1.24 for peak C1, 0.53 for peak C2, and 0.54 for peak A1. This indicates that the reaction current is due to the contribution of intercalation and capacitive-type storage mechanisms. The quantitative capacitive contribution from the total current is obtained using eqn (2): i = k1 × ν + k2 × ν1/2(2)where k1 and k2 are the fitting parameters and i is the current at a fixed potential. k1 × ν is the capacitive contribution and k2 × ν1/2 represents the diffusion-controlled contribution. k1 and k2 can be estimated from the ν1/2vs. i/ν1/2 plot using the slope of the curve and the y-axis intercept, respectively (Fig. S8†). The relative contributions of the capacitive and diffusion-controlled storage mechanisms are presented in Fig. 6(c). Although the capacitive contribution decreases with the scan rate, it is more than 85% even at high scan rates, indicating that the major contribution comes from capacitive-type mechanisms.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to determine the electrochemical resistance of the CCTS anode and electrolyte interface. Fig. 6(d) presents Nyquist plots recorded after 100 GCD cycles for different applied voltages. The inset of the figure presents the equivalent circuit diagram, with Rs indicating the solution resistance. The Nyquist plots show semicircles and a straight line, which represent the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and Warburg impedance (Wo), respectively. The increase in the semi-circle diameter with an increase in the potential from the open circuit potential (OCP) to 2.0 V indicates that the charge-transfer resistance increases.45,46 This resistance is 107.0 Ω at the OCP (0.0 V), while it is 117.5 Ω and 136.0 Ω at 1.0 V and 2.0 V, respectively. The slope of the straight line decreases in the low-frequency region as the potential increases, indicating poor capacitive behaviour at high voltages. The obtained parameters are presented in Table S1.† This indicated that the electrode resistance decreased during the discharge process. Moreover, the decreased slope of the straight line in the low frequency region with respect to potential indicated poor capacitive behaviours at high voltages.
Conclusions
We fabricated CCTS anode electrodes for LIBs using a simple hydrothermal technique. The formation of nearly stoichiometric CCTS with a composition ratio of Cu2.77Co1.0Sn1.56S3.82 is observed. The shape of the GCD curves remains unchanged during consecutive cycles, indicating that the CCTS anode electrode had a stable charge storage mechanism. The CCTS anode electrode has a reversible average discharge capacity of 198.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. It has an excellent capacity retention of 62.0% and a coulombic efficiency of more than 83% after over 100 charge–discharge cycles. A capacity retention of 75.3% is found after charge–discharge cycles at various current densities, indicating a high-rate performance. Overall, the electrochemical charge storage performance of the CCTS anode is sustainable and efficient.
