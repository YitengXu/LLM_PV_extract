    , Accepted 8th April 2019First published on 9th April 2019AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted intensive attention in the past several years due to their ever-increasing efficiency. Particularly, high efficiencies are usually obtained by small-area (≤0.1 cm2) lab cells, and thus, the cell performance can be easily over- or underestimated due to inappropriate measurement protocols. Shading masks with well-defined apertures are usually employed to determine the test area of the cells. However, it is found that the aperture area significantly influences the measured photovoltaic parameters of the cells, and has not been quantified. Here we measure and compare the parameters of printable mesoscopic PSCs with shading masks of different shapes and aperture areas. It is identified that extra diffuse light may go through the masks due to the edge effect, and cause an overestimation of the photocurrent density (JSC). We establish a model to calibrate the measured JSC, which is considered as a sum of effective JSC (JSC-eff) and error JSC (JSC-err). By fitting the JSC measured using apertures of 0.031–0.503 cm2 with a quadratic function, JSC-eff and JSC-err are respectively obtained. Besides the aperture areas, the ratio of aperture area/active area also influences the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the cells. By fitting the measured values with different apertures, we establish a model to calibrate the measured parameters of PSCs. This model can evaluate the test errors and provide effective values of the photovoltaic parameters of PSCs.
Introduction
As a clean and renewable form of energy, solar energy is growing to be one of the most important energy sources. The photovoltaic technology represented by silicon solar cells has greatly developed over the past decade. However, the cost of silicon solar cells is still higher than that of traditional fossil energy sources.1,2 Recently, several emerging photovoltaic technologies, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),3,4 organic photovoltaics (OPVs),5,6 and perovskite solar cells (PSCs),7,8 have attracted much attention due to their low material cost, simple fabrication process and high efficiency. Among them, PSCs have achieved extremely high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.7%,9,10 rivaling those of commercially available multicrystalline silicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film solar cells. However, these high efficiencies of PSCs are usually obtained with small-area (≤0.1 cm2) lab cells.11,12 The cell performance can be easily over- or underestimated due to inappropriate measurement protocols.13,14
There have been many literature studies reporting on the reliable measurements of DSSCs and PSCs.14,15 However, no standard test protocol for emerging solar cells has been established.13,16,17 Usually, shading masks with well-defined apertures are employed to determine the test area of the cells, which is used to calculate the short-circuit current–density (JSC) and corresponding PCE of the cells.15,17–20 However, it was found that the aperture size of the masks significantly influenced the measured photovoltaic parameters of the cells, which indicated that inaccurate test results may exist.16,17 M. Grätzel et al. reported that the measured efficiency may vary by as much as 36% for DSSCs with different apertures.20 Particularly, without a mask, the device performance will be extremely highly overestimated.15,20,21 An optimal test condition was proposed by employing a mask with an aperture slightly larger than the active area of the cell (defined by the area of the TiO2 electrode), which may be inapplicable for solar cells based on other architectures. F. C. Krebs et al. found that the light field inhomogeneity and a large diffuse component in combination with masking gave rise to a substantial variation in the measured efficiency of OPVs.22,23 Evolved from DSSCs and OPVs, PSCs have similar cell configurations and thus encountered similar testing issues.24,25
For PSCs, the active area is the overlap of the cathode and anode, typically the charge transport layers and the top/back contacts, which are nontransparent.15 If a mask with an aperture area larger than the active area is used, extra incident light due to scattering and refraction will bring more photoelectrons to the cell surface through the mask. In this case, the JSC and corresponding PCE calculated using the cell area will be overestimated. If a mask with an aperture area that equals the active area of the device is used, it will be difficult to set the mask exactly over the active area of the cells. The positional mismatch between the mask and the cell will lead to inevitable measurement errors.20 It seems that using a mask with an aperture area that is smaller than the active area of the cell could be an effective protocol.20,21 However, this method will introduce excess charge transfer and recombination pathways, thus leading to an underestimation of open-circuit voltage (VOC).24 The fill factor (FF) of the cells may also be overestimated due to varied series resistance.13 Moreover, some diffuse light striking the mask from an angle will still be captured by the masked area of the cell, leading to overestimated JSC.15,20,24
Here, we measured and compared the photovoltaic parameters of printable mesoscopic PSCs with masks of different aperture shapes and areas. It is found that the values of all of the photovoltaic parameters of JSC, VOC, FF and PCE are significantly influenced by the mask aperture area. The variation of JSC is identified to be relevant to the edge effect that the diffuse light generated by the solar simulators falls onto the cells at angles much larger than that of the direct light, resulting in a larger illumination area than the mask aperture.20,24 We establish a model to calibrate the measured JSC, which is considered as a sum of effective JSC (JSC-eff) and error JSC (JSC-err). By fitting the JSC measured using apertures of 0.031–0.503 cm2 with a quadratic function, JSC-eff and JSC-err are respectively obtained. For VOC and FF, the variations are correlated with the ratio of aperture area/active area rather than the aperture area itself.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the digital photo of a typical printable mesoscopic PSC based on a triple-layer architecture of TiO2/ZrO2/carbon.26,27 The details of the fabrication of the devices are presented in the ESI.† The working area (active area) of the devices is the overlap of the TiO2 layer and the carbon layer, and is marked with a red rectangle and has an area of 0.64 cm2. Since the edge of the carbon layer is quite rough, it is difficult to precisely determine the area of the carbon layer, and define the active area of the device. Thus, it is necessary to employ a mask with an aperture area that is smaller than the working area of the devices to define the test area and measure the photovoltaic performance, as shown in Fig. 1b. For the area that will not be illuminated on the active area of the device, it is named the dark-state area. The digital images of the shading masks and the holder are given in Fig. S1.†

(b) The device equipped with a relatively small shading mask to expose the aperture area and shade the dark-state area under no illuminated region of the working area. (c) The configuration for testing the photovoltaic performance of the devices with a shading mask and holder under simulated sunlight. 
To investigate the influence of the aperture area on the device performance, we measured the photovoltaic parameters of the devices using masks with circular and square apertures of different areas. As shown in Fig. 2a, when the circular aperture area increased from 0.018 cm2 to 0.102 cm2, the JSC sharply decreased from 28.52 mA cm−2 to 23.34 mA cm−2, while the VOC sharply increased from 825.0 mV to 883.7 mV. Despite the improvement of VOC following the increase of aperture area, the PCE generally decreased from 15.58% to 14.29% because of the sharp decrease of JSC. In addition, the fill factor (FF) is almost stable from 0.66 to 0.67 (Fig. 2b). When the aperture area further increased to 0.503 cm2, the JSC kept slightly decreasing from 23.34 to 22.86 mA cm−2 and FF started to decrease from 0.67 to 0.60. The overall PCE decreased from 14.29% to 12.69%, although the VOC increased steadily from 883.7 mV to 924.3 mV with the reduction of the dark-state region. For the results measured using masks with a square aperture, similar values and trends can be observed. The detailed parameters are presented in Table S1.† Each parameter was measured three times to obtain the average values.
 Fig. 2  Device performance measured with different masks and on different positions. (a and b) Performance of printable mesoscopic PSCs (JSC, VOC, FF and PCE) measured using masks with a circular aperture and square aperture of area from 0.031 cm2 to 0.504 cm2; (c and d) JSC and PCE measured using a mask with an aperture area of 0.102 cm2 on different positions of the working area. 
To confirm that the varied parameters do not result from the variations of the performance on different positions of the device, the photovoltaic parameters of the device (measured using a mask with a diameter of 3.6 mm and an aperture area of 0.102 cm2) on different positions were measured, and plotted in 2D contour (Fig. 2c and d). It was verified that the performance of the device is quite uniform on an area of 0.8 cm × 0.8 cm. For the area out of this range, the JSC continuously decreased to much lower values. Correspondingly, the PCE on the central area also showed consistent values of 13.72–14.60%. The distributions of VOC and FF of the device are presented in Fig. S2.† Thus, it can be concluded that the varied photovoltaic parameters measured using masks with different aperture areas were not caused by the non-uniformity of the device performance on different positions.
According to previous reports,20,22,28–30 the varied JSC was mainly caused by the edge effect of the masks, for which the diffuse light generated by the solar simulator falls onto the device at angles much larger than that of the direct light (>5°), resulting in a larger illumination area than the mask aperture area (Aap), as shown in Fig. 3a. The diffuse light illuminated area (Ad) contributes to the generation of photo-current, but is not involved in the calculation of the current–density.15,28 This causes the overestimation of the JSC for the J–V measurements. This is also confirmed by the results in Fig. S3.† A sunlight sensitive paper was employed to verify the illuminated area of the light through the masks. For both circular and square apertures, the actual illuminated area is larger than the area of the apertures. The edge effect is mainly determined by the light field inhomogeneity and diffuse component of the simulated sunlight.16,22 For masks with different Aap, the width of Ad could be equivalent to a constant for using a specific sunlight simulator (Wc for a circular aperture and Ws for a square aperture). When the Aap of the masks increased, the ratio of (Ad)/(Aap + Ad) correspondingly decreased. Correspondingly, the overestimated part of the current density to the measured JSC decreased. This explains the decreasing trend of JSC in Fig. 2a.

(b and c) The measured and fitted values of JSC for masks with circular and square apertures. (d and e) The measured and fitted values of VOC for masks with circular and square apertures. 
The varied VOC and FF of the devices measured with different masks are due to varied charge transfer and recombination pathways. The underestimated VOC may be related to the fact that the specific carrier distribution resulting in the undesired dark-state charge transfer and recombination may have a significant influence on the cell performance. Especially for the cases that Aap is smaller than the working area of the device, the dark-state area of the device will still join in as recombination reduced the VOC. When Aap increased to comparative values (>0.102 cm2), the FF was mainly influenced by the series resistance of the device for which the ohmic loss played a significant role. Here, we mainly discuss the overestimated JSC and underestimated VOC due to the mask effect, which determines the overall PCE of the devices with an Aap of 0.102–0.504 cm2.
The illuminated area is considered as a sum of Aap and Ad. Correspondingly, the measured JSC can be described as: JSC = (JSC-eff × Aap + JSC-eff × Ad)/Aap(1) JSC-err = (Ad × JSC-eff)/Aap(2)where effective JSC (JSC-eff) is the actual short-circuit current density of the device, and is generated by the illuminated aperture area. Error JSC (JSC-err) is the overestimated part of the current density, and is generated by the diffuse light illuminated masked area.
As mentioned, Wc could be equivalent to a constant for using a specific sunlight simulator. Aap and Ad can be described as: Aap = πD2/4(3) Ad = π(D/2 + Wc)2 − π(D/2)2(4)where D is the diameter of the circular aperture. Wc is the width of the diffuse light illuminated area, as shown in Fig. 3a.
After integrating eqn (1)–(4), the relationship between JSC and JSC-eff can be described as: JSC = JSC-eff(1 + 4Wc/D + 4Wc2/D2)(5)
Similarly, for the masks with a square aperture, the relationship between JSC and JSC-eff can be described by: JSC = JSC-eff(1 + 4Ws/L + 4Ws2/L2)(6)where L is the length of the square aperture. According to eqn (5) and (6), the relationship between 1/D (or 1/L) and JSC follows a quadratic function. We applied the measured JSC, D and L values to eqn (5) and (6), and plotted the measured curves and fitted curves in Fig. 3b. The fitted parameters are presented in Table S2.†
For the fitted results based on masks with both circular and square apertures, the coefficient of determination (R-square) reaches over 0.96, indicating that the measured values fitted quite well with our equations.31 The regular residuals of fitted JSC values are shown in Fig. 3c. For masks with a circular aperture, the fitted JSC-eff is 22.67 mA cm−2. For masks with a square aperture, the fitted JSC-eff is 22.65 mA cm−2. These results are quite consistent, which indicates that the aperture shape does not affect the accuracy and error rate of the measurement protocols.
According to the trends of measured VOC with different apertures, it was found that the VOC increased as the aperture enlarged. Notably, the dark-state region reduced. This is because the nonilluminated area of the masked solar cells will still join in as the volume for recombination and lead to the decrease of VOC. The total recombination current scales linearly with the area of the overlapping electrodes and is in the commonly used generalized Shockley diode equation, a simple exponential function of the voltage measured at those electrodes.13 Its value is hence not affected by any mask aperture size but the aperture area ratio, as presented in eqn (7) and (8). (7) (8)where n is the diode ideality factor and kT/q is the thermal voltage which generally exhibited a constant at stable temperature. Particularly, we exposed the cells to simulated sunlight for 10 min, and then started the J–V measurements. The surface temperature of the cells is ∼40 °C. Aap is the area of the mask aperture area and Aworking area is the device area defined by the overlapping area of the employed electrodes.
The effective VOC was evaluated and obtained by fitting the measured values in an exponential function with generation Shockley diode equation. In the equation of the exponential function, a fitting function constant can be seen ideal VOC in no dark-state. By considering the ideal VOC as the effective VOC of the cells, the measured parameters will not suffer the influences of shunt resistances32 or self-induced heating effects.33 In the common case of un-shunted solar cell operation, expressed by eqn (8), the measured VOC will be directly correlated with the logarithm of the ratio of mask aperture area to working area. Through fitting the measured VOC and relative logarithm X in eqn (8), the fitted results with both circular and square apertures, the coefficient of determination (R-square) reaches over 0.99, indicating the measured values fitted quite well with our equations.31 The regular residuals of fitted VOC values are shown in Table S3†. For masks with a circular aperture, the fitted VOC-eff is 933.86 mV. For masks with a square aperture, the fitted VOC-eff is 933.95 mV. Particularly, the difference between these two fitted VOC-eff values is only 0.96%.
After obtaining the fitted effective values of JSC and VOC, we attempted to evaluate the errors of the measured values with different apertures. The dependence of JSC/JSC-eff ratio on the aperture area is plotted in Fig. 4a. In general, the values and trends obtained with circular and square apertures are almost the same. When the aperture area is extremely small (0.018–0.031 cm2), the overestimated ratio of the current density is found to be 17.6–25.8%. When the aperture area increased to 0.102–0.126 cm2, the current density that is contributed by the diffuse light sharply decreased to lower than 3%. Further increasing the aperture area to 0.283–0.503 cm2 can effectively reduce the overestimation of JSC to lower than 1.0%.

(b) The dependence of VOC/VOC-eff ratio on the aperture area and area ratio of the masks. (c) The combined comparison of JSC/JSC-eff and VOC/VOC-eff. (d) The dependence of PCE/PCE-eff ratio on the aperture area of the masks. 
The dependence of VOC/VOC-eff on the aperture area is plotted in Fig. 4b. When the aperture area is small (0.018–0.031 cm2), the VOC is highly underestimated for 11.7–18.8%. In this case, we should emphasize that it is because the aperture ratio of X is small, rather than the aperture area itself. As the aperture area increased from 0.018 cm2 to 0.503 cm2, X correspondingly increased from 0.028 to 0.785. When X is between 0.028 and 0.110, an underestimation of 7.41–11.66% is observed for the measured VOC. With an aperture area of 0.102 cm2 and X of 0.159, the underestimation of the measured VOC reduces to ∼5.4%. When X further increased to over 0.442–0.785, the underestimation of the measured VOC could reduce to lower than 2.6%.
Particularly, the JSC and VOC were overestimated and underestimated respectively, and thus these two parameters were integrated and compared, as shown in Fig. 4c. With an extremely small aperture area (0.018–0.031 cm2), the measurement error of JSC × VOC is 7.2–11.1%. When the aperture area increased to 0.049–0.102 cm2, the error significantly reduced to 2.6%. Further increasing the aperture area could effectively reduce the error to lower than 1.0%, and the trends for circular and square apertures are almost the same.
To evaluate the measurement errors of the overall efficiency of the devices, FF is another essential factor that needs to be considered, and the situation is more complex than JSC and VOC. K. Tvingstedt et al. provided a model to evaluate the overestimation of FF.13 When using masks smaller than the device active areas one will shift the operational maximum power point to a lower voltage value where the effect of series resistance is smaller and accordingly where the FF is getting larger. The measured values of FF are influenced by both the series resistance of the device and the mask aperture ratio. For the devices with “fairly small” series resistances of ∼4 Ω cm2, the FF overestimation is lower than 5%. When series resistances of the devices increase to over ∼10 Ω cm2, the aperture ratio X turns to be the dominant factor of the measured FF. Here, for printable PSCs, the series resistances are in the range of 5–10 Ω cm2 (Table S1†). Thus, it can be considered that the measured FF is only slightly overestimated and the decrease of the values as the aperture area increases is mainly due to the ohmic loss34 not measurement errors. According to the modeling results of K. Tvingstedt, we propose that the FF of 0.652 measured with an aperture area of 0.196 cm2 and aperture area ratio of 0.307 to be the effective value, for which the measurement error is evaluated to be lower than 5%. When the aperture is larger than 0.196 cm2, the measured values of FF are regarded as the effective ones.
Integrating the fitted effective values of JSC, VOC and FF, the fitted and measured values of PCE are summarized and compared in Fig. 4d. With the extremely small apertures (0.018 and 0.031 cm2), the PCE is overestimated for 9.6–12.9% due to highly overestimated JSC. When the aperture area increases to 0.049–0.196 cm2, the measurement errors reduce to 0.06–3.5%. For larger apertures of 0.283–0.503 cm2, the errors further reduce to lower than 1%. Thus, it can be concluded that the combined errors in PCE remain “acceptably small (<3.5%)” as long as “fairly large (>0.10 cm2)” mask apertures are being employed. Besides the aperture area, the aperture area ratio of X also plays a critical role in measuring the parameters of the cells. Using masks with larger apertures could effectively improve the accuracy, although the overall performance will inevitably decrease. Notably, the performance on the area of 1 cm2 is usually regarded as a reasonable reference.
Another issue for accurately measuring the performance of PSCs is the hysteresis effect.35,36 In our previous work, we were able to tune the hysteresis of printable mesoscopic PSCs through adjusting the compact TiO2 layer.37 In this work, the devices all present hysteresis-free or hysteresis-less J–V curves, and the parameters were collected by reverse (from open-circuit to short-circuit) scans. To investigate whether the aperture area of the masks influences the hysteresis effect of PSCs, devices showing the normal hysteresis behavior were tested with apertures of 0.031, 0.102 and 0.385 cm2, as shown in Fig. S4.† For printable mesoscopic PSCs, the differences between the J–V curves measured with different scan directions and scan rate mainly lie in VOC and FF, not JSC. Here for the parameters measured with different apertures, the hysteresis behavior has not been significantly influenced. For the reverse scan, the photovoltaic parameters measured with different apertures almost all stayed unchanged when the scan rate varied from 25 to 500 mV s−1. Only for the scan rate of 25 and 50 mV s−1, the JSC measured with small apertures decreased. This indicates that the diffuse light contributed current density may be more sensitive to scan rate. For the forward scan (from short-circuit to open-circuit), smaller VOC and FF were obtained. Particularly, the FF decreased as the scan rate slowed down from 250 to 25 mV s−1. On the whole, the parameters measured with different apertures show similar variation trends.
Conclusion
The values of the photovoltaic parameters of PSCs measured with a shading mask are significantly influenced by the aperture area. Extra diffuse light may go through the masks due to the edge effect, and cause an overestimation of the photocurrent density and efficiency. With apertures of 0.102–0.503 cm2, the deviations between the measured and effective JSC reduced from 2.96% to 0.89%. The dark-state area of the device exhibits recombination pathways, thus leading to an underestimation of VOC. With an aperture area of 0.102–0.503 cm2 which corresponds to the aperture area ratio of 0.159–0.785, the deviations between the measured and effective VOC varied from 5.38% to 1.02%. Considering the combined effect of under or overestimated photovoltaic parameters, the deviations between the measured and effective PCE are acceptable for lower than 3.5% with aperture areas 0.049–0.283 cm2. Employing a mask with an aperture that is slightly smaller than the active area of the device would be a preferred choice for accurately measuring the performance of PSCs and other types of solar cells. To evaluate the validity of the parameters measured with a specific test area, our model provides a method to calibrate the values and evaluate the possible measurement errors.
