    , Accepted 26th November 2018First published on 29th November 2018AbstractStability is one of the major challenges of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials (APbX3, where A = MA+, FA+ and Cs+, and X = I−, Br− and Cl−, respectively) in optoelectronic device applications. APbX3 materials are extremely sensitive to temperature, humidity and oxygen. Although degradation of the materials caused by oxygen and moisture could be partially solved by encapsulation techniques, further improving the stability of perovskites under external heat is still demanding. Generally, APbX3 would decompose into AX and PbX2 at the early stage, when it is in a high-temperature environment. In this contribution, we demonstrated that pressure can reinforce the thermal stability of MAPbX3, by promoting the reverse reaction. The stability reinforcement of MAPbI3 by mechanical forces was found to be more effective compared with that of MAPbBr3/MAPbCl3. Furthermore, we carried out quantitative research to mimic pressure induced reverse reactions, through dry-grinding the powder mixtures of equimolar PbX2 and AX. We found that the conversion yields and reaction paths were dramatically different depending on the type of organic-cation (A) and halide (X). APbI3, CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 can be directly and completely synthesized by the dry grinding method, and thus they are more promising candidates for material recovery by external forces. Meanwhile, it was found that CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 crystalize via Cs4PbX6 (X = Br or Cl) intermediate states. Our results provide a robust strategy for the specific design of perovskite material based optoelectronic devices, especially for applications demanding better stability.
1. Introduction
Lead halide based organic and inorganic hybrid perovskites (LHOIPs) are solids with the formula APbX3 in general, where A = CH3NH3+/MA+, HC(NH2)2+/FA+, and Cs+; X = I−, Br−, and Cl−, respectively. Due to their superior optoelectronic properties such as broadband light absorption, long carrier diffusion length and high carrier mobility, LHOIPs have attracted tremendous attention recently.1–8 Their remarkable physical properties have triggered the revolution of a wide range of low-cost, flexible and highly efficient photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.9–13 Currently, APbX3 based solar cells exhibit high power conversion efficiency exceeding 22%, which could rival Si and CuInGaSe based photovoltaic technologies.14 Nevertheless, APbX3 materials are still facing several serious challenges for their commercial applications. APbX3 materials are sensitive to moisture, oxygen and high temperatures. Enormous efforts have been devoted to improving the stability of perovskites.15–18 Moisture and oxygen caused natural degradation could be overcome by passivation and encapsulation techniques.19,20 Niu and co-workers demonstrated that a thin layer of Al2O3 can effectively protect MAPbI3 from degradation in a humid environment.21 Zhu et al. introduced 4-dimethylaminobenzoic acid to the surface of the MAPbI3 film, providing a waterproofing capability to the perovskite and its thermal stability was greatly improved.22 Meanwhile, it has been proved that chemical modification and various cation or anion partial substitutions could enhance the stability of APbX3 up to several months.23–27 However, chemical modification may unavoidably change the physical properties of APbX3 and undesirably affect the optoelectronic device performance.
One crucial issue not properly addressed yet is the thermal stability of APbX3 materials.28–32 It has been pointed out that APbX3 materials structurally belong to the soft matter class,33 and thus they have a high sensitivity to small external perturbations such as temperature. It was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) that the MAPbI3 crystal can quickly decompose at a temperature above 300 °C.34 In addition, it has been demonstrated that MAPbX3 thin films are prone to degradation at an even much lower temperature of 130 °C,35 caused by the low evaporation temperature of MAX ranging from 110 °C to 150 °C. The thermal instability is commonly observed in a wide range of APbX3 materials, which has been considered as a major bottleneck for their applications.35–40 The thermal stability of APbX3 is critical for device performance; however, successful inhibition of the thermal decomposition of APbX3 materials is rarely reported.
Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the possibility to improve the thermal stability of various MAPbX3 materials via mechanical force engineering, by promoting the reverse reaction between the decomposition products. Moreover, it is evidenced that the optoelectronic properties of MAPbI3 are preserved after annealing at a relatively high temperature with applying a mechanical force. We study the mechanical force-driven formation of various perovskites from their precursors. Such a reversed decomposition process suggests the polytropic reaction paths of APbX3. The critical roles of organic and inorganic components of APbX3 in the structural reconstruction have been revealed. We believe that the strategy of mechanical force engineering may open new perspectives for rational design of thermally stable and self-healing perovskite devices.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Effect of pressure on thermal decomposition inhibition of MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, and Cl) materials
We employed a commonly used one-step spin-coating method to deposit various MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, and Cl) materials (details are shown in Experimental methods in the ESI†) onto ITO-coated glass substrates. The pristine MAPbX3 thin film was placed on a hot plate of a hydraulic machine and annealed with applying a pressure of 5 MPa at a temperature of 150 °C for 1 hour. In contrast, another MAPbX3 thin-film sample was annealed at the same temperature (150 °C) for the same amount of time (1 hour) without pressure loading. The pristine MAPbX3 and annealed samples with and without pressure loading are denoted as samples 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The photographs of the resulting samples and the stainless-steel mould are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1 and S2).†
We carried out scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements to investigate the effect of pressure on the thermal stability of MAPbX3 materials, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. Remarkably, in Fig. 1(a), the XRD pattern of pristine MAPbI3 exhibits diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 19.8°, 23.5° and 24.5°, which can be indexed to tetragonal MAPbI3.41 As shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a), the digital photographs and SEM results show that the pristine MAPbI3 sample is deep black in colour and forms a closely packed thin film. For the MAPbI3 sample after annealing with an external force (5 MPa) loaded, the diffraction peaks of MAPbI3 remain while only weak characteristic peaks of PbI2 appear; moreover, no distinct colour and morphology changes are observed. For the annealed sample without any external force applied, only diffraction peaks of PbI2 are observed and its colour becomes yellowish. A lot of voids appear on the surface, indicating that pristine MAPbI3 is totally decomposed after thermal heating. Thus, as evidenced by the above results, applying an external force is an effective way to inhibit the thermal decomposition of MAPbI3. The SEM images and XRD patterns of MAPbBr3 samples are displayed in Fig. 1(b). The pristine MAPbBr3 has cube-shaped crystals with a smooth surface, suggesting a cubic symmetry as determined by its XRD pattern.42 For the sample annealed under pressure, new diffraction peaks of PbBr2 appear in XRD, which imply that MAPbBr3 crystals are decomposed after heating, as will be demonstrated in the SEM image, some pinholes appear in parts of MAPbBr3 crystals. However, as indicated, MAPbBr3 annealed without pressure shows a discernible different morphology and colour compared with the pristine MAPbBr3, and the cube-shaped crystals are completely cracked and its colour turns white, suggesting a high level of thermal decomposition. For MAPbCl3 samples presented in Fig. 1(c), both samples annealed with and without applied external force showed obvious morphology changes. The XRD pattern of sample 2 presents weakening of the diffraction peaks of MAPbCl3,43 whereas the peaks of PbCl2 are found. No MAPbCl3 peaks are detected for sample 3, indicating a complete decomposition of MAPbCl3 caused by thermal heating. Thus, it is noteworthy that thermal decomposition suppression is more effective in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, in comparison with that in MAPbCl3.

In order to explore the effect of various mechanical forces on thermal stability reinforcement for MAPbX3 materials, we performed experiments using different pressures in the range from 1 MPa to 20 MPa. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Remarkably, as can be seen in Fig. 2(a), the sample annealed at 150 °C without pressure-loading is fully decomposed into PbI2. In contrast, the thermal stability of the samples annealed with pressure-loading is significantly reinforced, owing to which the diffraction peaks of MAPbI3 remain while only weak characteristic peaks of PbI2 appear. Moreover, with the pressure loaded increasing from 1 MPa to 20 MPa, the relative intensity of the PbI2 diffraction peak decreases gradually, and when the pressure reaches 20 MPa, the diffraction peak of PbI2 almost disappears. However, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), for the MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3 samples, the effects of mechanical forces on thermal stability reinforcement are not very sensitive to the change of pressure in the range from 1 MPa to 20 MPa. Numerous studies have shown that the thermally induced decomposition of APbX3 generates AX and PbX2 at the first stage.27,34–36 Apparently, upon annealing at 150 °C, MAPbX3 will decompose into MAX and PbX2 and gaseous MAX will evaporate rapidly.44,45 We deduce that pressure may induce a reverse reaction of perovskite thermal decomposition, which will keep the gaseous decomposition products inside and convert them back into the perovskite synchronously.

As a further investigation, we loaded pressure on MAI and PbI2 powders directly. It is found that MAI and PbI2 could be converted into MAPbI3 at the interface of the two materials, and the details are shown in the ESI (Fig. S3).† On the basis of these results, we believe that pressure is potentially applicable for the material recovery or at least retards the thermal decomposition process at the early stage, which is critical for material stability improvement.
Furthermore, we have fabricated photodetector devices using MAPbI3 films, and then the as-prepared MAPbI3 films were annealed at 150 °C for 1 hour with or without pressure (5 MPa). We further compared the optoelectronic properties of these samples to evaluate the effect of pressure on thermal stability reinforcement. As shown in Fig. S4,† the optoelectronic properties of the MAPbI3 film appreciably decrease after annealing at 150 °C. Nevertheless, the optoelectronic performance of the pressure-assisted device is well preserved after annealing. These results confirm the utility of pressure in thermal stability reinforcement for perovskite materials, in the context of photoelectric device applications. In the case of sealing, the gaseous decomposition products will be kept inside and be reconverted into the perovskite by pressure, which blocks further material degradation. The schematic representation of this process is provided in the ESI (Fig. S5).† It is then intriguing and essential to find the reason for the disparate pressure-driven thermal decomposition suppression effect on MAPbBr3, MAPbCl3 and MAPbI3.
2.2 Monitoring of mechanical force induced reverse reaction of MAPbX3 (X = I−, Br−, and Cl−)
On the basis of thermal decomposition inhibition of MAPbX3 as discussed above, we are stimulated to explore the pressure induced conversion mechanisms. We assumed that MAPbX3 was entirely decomposed into MAX and PbX2. To realize quantitative research and monitor the pressure induced reaction, dry grinding the mixtures of equimolar PbX2 and MAX (details are provided in the Experimental methods) was carried out. We traced and characterized the reaction processes with different grinding times for all MAPbX3 samples by powder XRD, through which the detailed crystal structures and evolutions of perovskite materials can be studied. Remarkably, obvious differences in the reaction routes between MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3/MAPbCl3 systems have been observed in grinding time-dependent XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows the XRD patterns of the produced powder under various grinding times. When the grinding time reaches 5 min, diffraction peaks of MAPbI3 become detectable,41 which suggests the formation of tetragonal-phase MAPbI3 from MAI and PbI2 powders. With increasing grinding time, diffraction peaks from MAI display a weakening tendency; meanwhile, the diffraction peaks of MAPbI3 gradually increase with prolonged reaction time up to 40 min. Fig. 3(b) and (c) present the evolution processes of MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3 from their corresponding precursors. When the grinding time reaches 5 min, the cubic phases of MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3 appear in their XRD patterns.42,43 However, no new peaks or obvious peak intensity changes are observed with prolonged grinding time up to 100 min. Further reactions between the precursors seem unlikely to happen. Interestingly, by adding a small amount of dimethyl formamide (DMF) solvent during the grinding process of the MABr/PbBr2 mixture, the reaction can be facilitated as shown in Fig. S6† (labelled d). With a grinding time of 5 min, the XRD pattern of the resulting powder matches well with the cubic-phase MAPbBr3, and no peaks of remnant MABr and PbBr2 are observed. These results suggest that for MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3, loading a mechanical force could not realize a full conversion unless an organic solvent is applied. These results are in good agreement with the experimental phenomenon of thermal decomposition inhibition as discussed above.

2.3 Role of diverse organic and inorganic components of APbX3 in the mechanical force induced reconstruction reaction route
The role of organic and inorganic groups in the crystallization reaction route of diverse perovskites was further studied. Fig. 4(a) shows the XRD patterns of the resulting FAPbI3 powders produced by the grinding method. When the reaction time reaches 80 min, new diffraction peaks from the trigonal and hexagonal phases of FAPbI3 appear gradually.46 The evolution of XRD peaks confirms the gradual conversion of FAI and PbI2 into FAPbI3. A similar evolution process is observed in the CsPbI3 system. As shown in Fig. 4(d), typical diffraction peaks of CsI and PbI2 vanish while peaks from the orthorhombic phase of CsPbI3 (JCPDS no. 74-1970) start to appear as the reaction progresses. These results elucidate the full conversion of AI and PbI2 into APbI3 materials by applying a mechanical force. By comparing the evolutions of grinding time-dependent XRD patterns of APbBr3/APbCl3 systems, we find that the reaction paths of FAPbBr3/FAPbCl3 are similar to those of MAPbBr3/MAPbCl3, as shown in Fig. 4(b)/(c). And similarly, the FABr/PbBr2 and FACl/PbCl2 systems are hardly converted into the corresponding perovskites by a mechanical force without the assistance of an organic solvent.

Intriguingly, as shown in Fig. 4(e) and (f), when the grinding time reaches 80 min, all the diffraction peaks can be well indexed accordingly to the monoclinic phase of CsPbBr3 (JCPDS no. 54-751) and tetragonal-phase of CsPbCl3 (JCPDS no. 18-366), which indicates a complete conversion. The reaction process involves intermediate phase formation of rhombohedral Cs4PbBr6 (JCPDS no. 73-2478)/Cs4PbCl6 (JCPDS no. 76-1530) at the initial stage with a grinding time shorter than 25 min. After 25 min, it is observed that the diffraction peak intensities of Cs4PbBr6 and PbBr2 start to decrease, while peaks from CsPbBr3 appear and increase gradually, confirming the reaction of Cs4PbBr6/Cs4PbCl6 and PbBr2/PbCl2 and the formation of CsPbBr3/CsPbCl3 at this stage. The appearance of intermediate phases (CsBr/CsCl rich compounds) suggests the incorporation mechanism of CsBr/CsCl into the PbBr2/PbCl2 crystal lattices which leads to the formation of an inorganic perovskite. In the mechanochemical synthesis process, due to the slow diffusion of CsX into PbX2 (X = Br− and Cl−) particles, there is temporally an excess of CsX generating Cs4PbX6 phase at the particle surface. It then disappears when CsX reaches the core of the particles and forms a homogeneous phase of CsPbX3. The same conclusion is valid for other cations such as MA+ or FA+ instead of Cs+.47,48
The photographs of original AX, PbX2 and APbX3 generated by grinding are displayed in Fig. S8 and S9 in the ESI,† which are in good agreement with the previous reports. Moreover, the corresponding UV-visible absorption spectra of the resulting APbX3 powders are shown in Fig. S10,† confirming the occurrence of reaction between AX and PbX2 powders and the production of the APbX3 perovskite. For the samples of iodic perovskites, more than one absorption peak is detected. It is likely that these samples could be in a lower-symmetrical structure according to the Jahn–Teller effect,49 in which the twisted PbI6 octahedra introduce the energy level splitting. This deduction is also supported by XRD results as shown in Fig. 3 and 4. Taking MAPbI3 as a representative, a photoelectric study was carried out on the mechanical grinding generated perovskite, and the details and results are shown in the ESI (Fig. S11, S12, and S13).† The results of photoelectronic tests indicate that it has an excellent stability, reproducibility and fast detection time, which are comparable to those of perovskite thin films obtained by the solvent method. Moreover, its superior responsivity and detectivity also demonstrate high photoelectric conversion efficiency and good crystalline quality of the MAPbI3 material generated by mechanical forces.
Our present work shows that the conversion rate, phases of products, and even reaction paths are quite different among the compounds of the APbX3 family. APbX3 materials present a typical host–guest structure in which PbX63− networks are joined together as a cage construction host, where A+ ions replenish and support the perovskite structure. APbX3 perovskite materials cover a wide range of element substitutions, but only when the radius of the A+ ion matches the size of the cage, the high-symmetry phase of the cubic structure Imm is stable. When A+ ions are larger or smaller, the structure will fall into a lower-symmetry phase.
Goldschmidt's theory of the tolerance factor (t) and octahedral factor (μ), calculated from the ionic radius, could be a guidance.50 t = (RA + RX)/√2(RPb + RX)(1) μ = RPb/RX(2)where RA, RPb, and RX are the effective ionic radii of ions at the A, Pb and X sites, respectively. Geometrically, for APbX3 (X = I, Br and Cl), 0.81 < t < 1.0 and 0.44 < μ < 0.90 are generally required to form a stable perovskite structure. If t lies in the range from 0.89 to 1.0, it is more likely to form a cubic structure, while a lower t value often results in a less-symmetric structure such as orthorhombic or tetragonal phases.51 In the grinding process, APbX3 would form the most stable phase due to the mechanical stress. As summarized in Tables 1 and 2 in the ESI,† Br and Cl based perovskites are more likely to exhibit a cubic structure or high-symmetry phase, and I based perovskites tend to stay in a lower-symmetry phase, which are consistent with our XRD results.52
In the ABX3 perovskite structure (cubic phase), the lead atoms form octahedral structures with six nearest halogen neighbours. However, the electron configuration of Pb is 6s26p2, which could only provide 4 orbitals for covalent bonds, which means that it has to employ two 6d orbitals, which are filled with another two lone pair p electrons from halogen (p → d coordination bond) to form 6 equal sp3d2 hybrid orbitals. For halogen atoms, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a), the X–Pb covalent bond and X → Pb coordinate bond are collinear. Considering the other two lone pair electrons, halogen atoms form rhombus structures by sp2d non-equivalent hybridization rather than by sp hybridization. The electronic configuration of fluorine is 2s22p5, and the nearest 3d orbital could not be employed, and therefore fluorine is not included in the set of X.

The theory of Goldschmidt's tolerance factor explains the stability of perovskites with a cubic structure from the geometric aspect. From the energy point of view, the behaviour of halogen atoms could provide more information as a supplement. The occupation of d orbitals makes the cubic structure a higher-energy phase. When the cubic phase transforms into a lower symmetry, the hybridization tends to change from sp2d to sp3 or an intermediate state depending on the tolerance factor t. For halogen elements with the ascending period, as shown in Fig. 5(b), the polarization capability increases and the energy difference between np and nd decreases. The smaller energy difference between the np and nd hybridization could result in lower energy barriers to form sp2d hybridization and benefit the perovskite formation. Additionally, MA/FAPbBr3 and MA/FAPbCl3 adopt a high-symmetry cubic structure, whereas MA/FAPbI3 has a lower symmetry that requires lower energy.
On the other hand, MA+ and FA+ are nitrogenous groups, which mean that they could also form coordinate bonds with Pb while Pb has available coordinate orbitals, as illustrated in Fig. 5(c). When AX diffuses into the PbX2 crystal driven by grinding, X− ions will form bonds with Pb and so does N in MA+/FA+. These MA+/FA+ cations cap the active sites of Pb and passivate the reaction, which means that the subsequent X− ion should replace N and form PbX63− bricks. According to the theory of hard–soft acid–base (HSAB principle),53 relatively softer I− ions have strong binding capacity with Pb and could easily replace the sites occupied by MA+/FA+, whereas, Br−/Cl− ions are just a little softer than N, and the mechanical action could not provide enough energy to make them fully react.
Based on the experimental results and the above discussion, MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 are suitable candidates to deliver thermal decomposition suppression by mechanical forces, since their precursors (the same as the early-stage decomposition products) can totally be converted to perovskites by mechanical forces. In contrast, MAPbBr3, MAPbCl3, FAPbBr3 and FAPbCl3 systems are not suitable candidates for the potential self-recovery of decomposition, as it is hard to fully convert their precursors into the corresponding perovskites by mechanical forces without an organic solvent. These results match well with the thermal decomposition study as shown in Fig. 1. Additionally, CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 could be appropriate systems to deliver a healing process through the conversion of their Cs4PbBr6/Cs4PbCl6 intermediate phases under mechanical forces. Nevertheless, CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 generated by mechanical forces show a unique monoclinic and tetragonal phase, compared with the commonly obtained cubic phase by traditional synthetic methods.54,55 It is worth mentioning that, in the case of encapsulation, the gaseous decomposition products will be confined within a limited space, leading to a pressure increase, which could benefit the reverse reaction and suppress further degradation of the perovskite.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate that the thermal stability of MAPbI3 can be improved up to ∼150 °C, and the mechanism of thermal stability reinforcement of perovskite materials by applying external forces has been systematically studied for the first time. The thermal stability of MAPbX3 varies with different halogen groups, and MAPbI3 shows more effective suppression of thermal decomposition compared with MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3. It is confirmed that its photoelectric performances are well preserved by external forces after annealing. Furthermore, since APbX3 decomposes into PbX2 and AX at the early stage, the dry grinding method was applied to an equimolar mixture of PbX2 and AX to demonstrate the mechanical force driven reversed decomposition reaction. We monitored and traced the reaction processes under different grinding times. Our results show that among the hybrid organic and inorganic perovskites, MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 possess high recovery possibilities. CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 may also be suitable systems for recovery, owing to the mechanical force generated stable intermediate phases (Cs4PbBr6 and Cs4PbCl6). By contrast, MAPbBr3, MAPbCl3, FAPbBr3 and FAPbCl3 are not suitable candidates for the mechanical force induced recovery process, owing to their low recovery rates. These results are consistent with the thermal decomposition study. The thermal stability reinforcement and regeneration of perovskites by applying external forces provide important insights and guidance for material engineering and the design of novel photovoltaic devices, especially in high-temperature environments.
