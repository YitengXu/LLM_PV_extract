    , Accepted 12th August 2014First published on 4th September 2014AbstractTime dependent density functional theory and the hybrid B3LYP functional are used to investigate the structural and optical properties of pristine and carbon doped hexagonal boron nitride nanodots. In agreement with recent experiments, the embedded carbon atoms are found to favor nucleation. Our results demonstrate that carbon clusters of different shapes promote an early onset of absorption by generating in-gap states. The nanodots are interesting for opto-electronics due to their tunable optical response in a wide energy window. We identify cluster sizes and shapes with optimal conversion efficiency for solar radiation and a wide absorption range form infrared to ultraviolet.
I. Introduction
The exfoliation of graphene from graphite1 and discovery of its special properties2 have stimulated intense search for other two-dimensional materials.3,4 One such material is hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),5–7 which consists of alternating boron and nitrogen atoms in a hexagonal lattice. It shares many properties with graphene (e.g., the mechanical stability and large thermal conductivity) but its electronic structure is fundamentally different: Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, while h-BN has a wide band gap of more than 5.9 eV. Taking advantage of their highly ordered structures, graphene and h-BN can be combined in devices such as light emitters, transistors, and sensors, the properties of which can be tuned by incorporating selected impurities. For example, F-centers are commonly used in opto-electronics8 and doped graphene has been put forward for solar cell applications.9
Impurities also play a crucial role in the absorption spectrum of h-BN. Although bulk and nano-structured h-BN are known for their strong optical responses,10,11 these materials cannot be utilized in solar cells, because the absorption is restricted to the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Controlled incorporation of impurities is able to modify this scenario, as it has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally: absorption has been achieved below a photon energy of 5.9 eV, pointing to modifications of the dominating exciton.12–14 Impurity states near the top of the valence band or bottom of the conduction band cause a splitting of the main excitonic peak.15 More details on the properties of h-BN nanostructures are given in ref. 16. Doped h-BN can be obtained by chemical vapor deposition.17,18 However, this technique so far have not yielded well-defined monolayers due to the limited spatial control over the growth. Recently, progress has been achieved by post-synthesis substitutional carbon doping under in situ electron beam irradiation inside a transmission electron microscope,19 where the carbon atoms from decomposed hydrocarbon molecules (300 keV electron beam) replace boron atoms. Using the same approach, carbon atoms also can be incorporated into h-BN sheets at an electron energy of 60 keV.20 Note that beam-mediated substitution reactions may generate triangular carbon islands.6
Theoretically, two and three-dimensional h-BN systems have been studied extensively in recent years using different simulation techniques.21,22 For example, Barone and Peralta23 have demonstrated that h-BN nanoribbons with bare zigzag edges are magnetic semiconductors, where the energy gap is reduced gradually with the ribbon width. On the other hand, Tang and Cao24 have found spin-polarized ground states for specific modified nanoribbons. The electronic and transport properties of h-BN nanoribbons have been investigated in ref. 25, showing that they can be tuned by an external transverse electric field. From the structural point of view, the authors of ref. 26 have argued that doped carbon atoms form hexagonal configurations. Cahangirov and Ciraci27 have reported that the energy gap in graphene/h-BN core–shell structures strongly depends on the geometry, while the influence of hybridization (between the carbon, boron, and nitrogen 2p orbitals) and quantum confinement on the energy gap have been studied more generally in ref. 28. In ref. 29 carbon doped h-BN nanoribbons have been investigated, focusing on the optical spectrum, quantum efficiency, and photoresponsivity, and in ref. 30 the carbon impurity states and their interactions have been scrutinized.
Since it is known that many material properties are modified when the dimensionality is reduced to nanodots (NDs), the main objective of the present study is to elucidate the structural and electronic properties of h-BN NDs as a function of carbon doping. Controlling the chemical structure will make it possible to steer the optical properties. Given a lack of experimental data, modeling can provide the information that is required for engineering the material properties. However, the predictive power of simulations depends critically on the employed method. Previous studies of carbon doped h-BN have used density functional theory in the local density approximation or generalized gradient approximation,31,32 which both heavily underestimate band gaps. In contrast, hybrid functionals provide reliable results by inclusion of Hartree–Fock exchange, where the B3LYP functional33,34 nowadays constitutes a kind of standard and, thus, is used also in the present study. Time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in recent years has emerged as a reliable tool for the theoretical description of electronic excitations, yielding convincingly accurate spectra for a wide range of systems.35–39 We therefore will employ this methodology, which is described together with other computational aspects in Sect. II. The results are presented in Sect. III, addressing the structure, HOMO–LUMO gap, optical gap, and spectrum. Finally, we conclude in Sect. IV.
II. Computational aspects
Using the NWCHEM package,40 static density functional theory is employed to perform structural optimizations and TDDFT to calculate optical spectra. The Kohn–Sham eigenvalues and orbitals from the static calculations are used as an input for the TDDFT calculations, which are carried out by the linear response technique,41,42 because the real time TDDFT approach43 complicates the assignment of spectral features to specific electronic transitions. The NWCHEM implementation of the linear response technique makes use of the Tamm–Dancoff approximation,44 which assumes that the off-diagonal coupling matrix elements are negligible. This approach gives accurate excitation energies but violates oscillator strength sum rules.45 However, due to the Hermitian coupling matrix, standard matrix eigenvalue solvers can be used. The number of eigenvalues (roots) to be extracted is critical for the required computational time but must be chosen sufficiently high, since it controls the upper limit of the excitation energy. In the following we calculate 100 roots and employ the 6-31G basis set.46 We have tested for ND-A1 and found that the 6-31G* basis set does not give relevant differences.
In accordance with the convention in ref. 47, 12 × 4 rectangular h-BN NDs are considered, where 12/4 indicates the total number of dangling bonds on the armchair/zigzag edges. They are terminated with hydrogen atoms to guarantee stability. Being charge neutral, all NDs under consideration have a closed-shell electronic configuration in the ground state. The structures are fully relaxed by minimizing the total energy at the B3LYP level of theory without imposing any symmetry constraint. Tight convergence criteria of 10−4 eV for the energy and 5 × 10−3 Å for the atomic displacements are applied.
III. Results and discussion
Both the pristine and carbon doped h-BN NDs turn out to be planar. We determine the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the atomic orbitals contributing to these states, and the optical (excitation) gaps and responses. While the HOMO–LUMO gap refers to the ground state, the optical gap is the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state. We find that the B3LYP functional substantially improves the HOMO–LUMO gap (5.5 eV) as compared to the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof scheme (2.3 eV).
Two-dimensional h-BN theory48–51 and experiment52 predict band gaps to be in the range of 4.6 to 7.0 eV. Similarly, for bulk h-BN neither the direct nor the indirect band gap is accurately known. The values reported in the literature range from 3.6 to 7.1 eV.53 These uncertainties have been attributed to different stacking orders49 and excitons (which can reduce the band gap by nearly 1 eV) in bulk54 and two-dimensional55 h-BN. For the pristine h-BN ND the calculated optical gap turns out to be 0.6 eV lower than the HOMO–LUMO gap, pointing to excitonic effects also in this case. An analysis of the density of states shows that the band edges belong mainly to the pz orbitals and that, therefore, the electronic excitations are governed by transitions from 2pz to 2pz* states.
Carbon doped h-BN NDs are addressed in Fig. 1–3. Depending on the size and shape of the carbon cluster, we obtain a wide range of HOMO–LUMO and optical gaps. The NDs are classified as ND-A (edge), ND-B (linear), and ND-C (compact) according to the shape of the carbon cluster. For each shape various sizes are considered to establish the size dependence of the electronic properties. For ND-A1 (58 carbon atoms; all the boron and nitrogen atoms on the edges are replaced by carbon) the calculated HOMO–LUMO gap (1.35 eV) is the lowest among all structures in this class. For partial carbon substitution in ND-A2 (42 carbon atoms; all the boron and nitrogen atoms on the long edge are replaced by carbon) and ND-A3 (16 carbon atoms; 8 boron and 8 nitrogen atoms on the long edge are replaced by carbon) we obtain enhanced HOMO–LUMO gaps of 1.9 and 2.3 eV, respectively. In the ND-B class the number of carbon atoms decreases from ND-B1 (34 carbon atoms), to ND-B2 (26 carbon atoms), to ND-B3 (18 carbon atoms), and to ND-B4 (10 carbon atoms), where the HOMO–LUMO gap increases almost linearly as a function of the size (1.6, 1.9, 2.6, and 3.9 eV). In the last class, we find for ND-C1 (64 carbon atoms), ND-C2 (32 carbon atoms), and ND-C3 (16 carbon atoms) HOMO–LUMO gaps of 1.0, 2.6, and 3.3 eV, respectively.

The above results demonstrate a general trend in the HOMO–LUMO gap variation: more carbon is embedded in the ND, the smaller is the gap, which can be understood by the fact that the number of carbon states appearing in the h-BN band gap is increased. The behavior is illustrated in Fig. 4. Depending on the number of carbon atoms and the shape of the cluster, the absorption apparently can be modified from infrared to ultraviolet, covering the entire visible spectrum, which is interesting for opto-electronics. The effect of carbon doping on the orbital nature of the HOMO and LUMO is also addressed in Fig. 1–3 by means of wavefunction isosurface plots. We observe for both orbitals localization on the carbon clusters, though with different spatial distributions.

For each ND we derive the formation energy per atom, (1)where Etot is the total energy of the ND, E(X) is the total energy of an isolated X atom, m, n, p, and q are the numbers of B, N, C, and H atoms, respectively, and N = m + n + p + q is the total number of atoms in the ND. The values obtained for the formation energy are summarized in Fig. 5. In ref. 56 it has been demonstrated that by photolithography and chemical vapor deposition NDs of almost arbitrary shapes can be created. This observation agrees with our result that the formation energy differences between the ND classes as well as within each class are small. In addition, the fact that a significant energy gain is realized by carbon–carbon interaction, compare Fig. 5, explains the experimental finding that carbon clusters are favored over a random distribution and, more importantly, reflects the potential to achieve desired cluster shapes with tailored band gaps.

The optical spectra shown in Fig. 6 in the energy range from 0 to 4.25 eV (normalized spectral intensity f) reveal rich features and significant variations of the optical response under carbon doping. For ND-A1 we obtain an optical gap of 1.1 eV, a pronounced peak at 2.0 eV (f = 20), and a generally strong response in the visible region, whereas for ND-A3 the optical gap is 2.2 eV, a pronounced peak appears at 3.0 eV (f = 9), and the response is weak in the visible region. For application in solar cells a material should have the capability to absorb a wide range of the solar radiation. In addition, the optical gap must be close to 1.4 eV to obtain a maximal conversion efficiency.57,58 As a consequence, ND-A1 and ND-A3 cannot be considered to be good choices, since for the former/latter the optical gap is too small/large. For ND-A2 the optical gap amounts to 1.6 eV, a pronounced peak is centered at 2.2 eV (f = 25), and the optical response reaches from the visible to the ultraviolet region. This is a better result, though with a suboptimal gap.
 Fig. 6  Optical spectra of carbon doped h-BN NDs. In the top right corners the exact optical gaps are given, because tiny excitation peaks can be invisible in the plots. A Gaussian width of 0.13 eV is used for broadening the spectra. 
In the linear assemblies (ND-B class) the optical response spans from visible to ultraviolet. ND-B3 and ND-B4 show the strongest peaks between 3.8 and 4.2 eV, though their optical gaps are different, see Fig. 6. As compared to the pristine h-BN ND, we obtain significant red shifts of the onset of absorption (1.2, 1.5, 2.2, and 3.5 eV for ND-B1, ND-B2, ND-B3, and ND-B4, respectively). For ND-B2 there are three peaks of comparable intensity distributed in a wide energy window. With an absorption from 1.2 to 4.5 eV (wavelength 275 to 1035 nm), an optical gap of 1.5 eV, and absorption also in the near infrared, ND-B2 combines almost ideal properties for solar cell applications. In fact, most of the present day solar cells do not efficiently utilize the red and infrared light.59 In the case of compact carbon assemblies (ND-C class) the absorption sets in at 0.8, 2.3, and 3.0 eV for ND-C1, ND-C2, and ND-C3, respectively. None of these NDs shows convincing characteristics, since the optical gap is either too large or too small.
IV. Conclusions
Using state-of-the-art B3LYP/TDDFT calculations we have investigated the electronic and optical properties of pristine and carbon doped h-BN NDs. The doped NDs show unique spectral properties, since the incorporated carbon causes red shifts of the onset of absorption (by generating in-gap states) and significantly modifies the optical response. Carbon doping turns out to constitute an efficient approach to tailor h-BN NDs for opto-electronic applications. It has been evaluated which cluster types are promising for solar energy harvesting. The more carbon is embedded, the smaller are the HOMO–LUMO and optical gaps. Together with the ability to design the shape of the carbon clusters by photolithography, this fact paves the way to optimized absorption spectra. In contrast to edge clusters, in linear and compact clusters the optical response can be tuned in a wide energy range. Therefore, such clusters are more flexible for optimizing the optical gap towards high conversion efficiency. For example, a linear cluster of 26 carbon atoms embedded in a 12 × 4 rectangular h-BN ND turns out to have almost ideal properties within the approximations of our calculations. In addition, this combination results in a wide absorption spectrum that spans not only the visible to ultraviolet range but also includes infrared light, which carries half of the energy emitted by the sun.
