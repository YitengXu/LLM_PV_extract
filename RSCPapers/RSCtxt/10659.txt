    , Accepted 2nd October 2017First published on 3rd October 2017AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant attention owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, which arise mainly from their high surface–bulk ratios and topological effects. Since the discovery of graphene in 2004, the family of 2D materials has expanded rapidly. Thus far, several single-element 2D materials (graphene, phosphorene, etc.) have been reported; the majority of them contain two (MoS2, WSe2, etc.) or more elements (Mo2CTx, CrPS4, Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox, etc.). Of these, three-element 2D materials, also called ternary 2D materials, represent a rather attractive direction of recent years. Typical ternary 2D materials include metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPTs), ternary transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs), transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) and 2D ternary oxides. Ternary 2D systems result in multiple degrees of freedom to tailor their physical properties via stoichiometric variation. Moreover, they exhibit some properties not characteristic of binary 2D systems, such as band gap tuning. In this paper, we have reviewed the recent progress in various ternary 2D materials on the basis of their classification (MPTs, ternary 2D MXenes, ternary TMDs, BCN and other ternary 2D materials). The synthesis methods, structures, key properties (such as band gap tuning, phase transition and topological phase), and their applications, are summarized. In addition, the strategies to tackle challenges, as well as the outlooks of this field, are presented.Lina WangLina Wang received her B.S. degree from Shanxi Normal University.

1 Introduction
Since the discovery of graphene in 2004,1 atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted considerable interest owing to their unprecedented physical, chemical and electronic properties.2 They have shown great potential in various applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices, catalysis, sensors and energy storage devices.3–11 Prompted by the increasing research on graphene, researchers have started to explore and isolate other layered materials. After decades of progress, various 2D materials have been reported, including MoS2, h-BN, WTe2, germylene and black phosphorus.12–19 Note that the physical, chemical and electronic properties of 2D materials are versatile and material-dependent, making each of them favorable for specific applications.13,14,20 For example, the structure of h-BN is similar to that of graphene. However, unlike graphene, h-BN is an insulator, with a band gap larger than 5 eV. The band gap of single-layered h-BN could be up to 6 eV. Most importantly, h-BN is resistant to chemical attack and harsh conditions such as high temperature.14,21,22 Therefore, the exploration of new 2D materials with interesting novel properties is crucial for building the landscape of the 2D world thus leading to fascinating applications.
Currently, research on 2D materials has been almost exclusively focused on single elements, such as graphene and black phosphorus and on binary systems such as MoS2 and WS2. A majority of the 2D materials are binary systems.14,15 In addition, efforts have been devoted to the discovery of new 2D materials, to meet the requirements of future electronic and optoelectronic technologies. Therefore, 2D materials with multiple elements, such as Mo2CTx, CrPS4 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox, have also been reported recently.23,24 Among these, three-element 2D materials, also called ternary 2D materials, represent a rather attractive research direction. Typical ternary 2D materials include metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPT: MnPS3, CrPS4, FePSe3, etc.), ternary transition metal carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides (MXenes: Ta6AlC5 and Ti7SnC6), and ternary transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs: MoxW2−xS2, Cr2Ge2Te6 and so on).13,14,25,26 Previous studies have shown that the elemental composition plays an important role in determining the physical properties of 2D materials. For example, the typical single-element 2D material graphene has charge carrier mobility but no band gap. Another new single-element 2D material antimonene becomes a semiconductor when it is thinned to a single layer. However, the number of elementary 2D materials is rather limited.
In contrast, binary systems exhibit a relatively diversiform behavior because of their large number of compounds. Good candidates can be easily identified for diverse applications. For example, an indirect band gap can be transformed into a direct band gap by layering the samples. The 1T–2H phase transition in transition metal dichalcogenides (such as MoTe2) can be controlled by the growth temperature. Binary 2D materials exhibit excellent flexibility for tuning the properties through stoichiometry engineering.27–30 However, it is difficult to tune the bang gap in most binary 2D materials.31,32 More importantly, the band gaps of these 2D materials are usually too large to make appropriate optical devices. Although binary InSe was reported to have a relatively narrow band gap of 1.4 eV,33 its application in the near infrared (NIR) range is difficult. However, some TMDs, which have a very narrow band gap, might be very good for NIR detectors. In this case, a ternary 2D system may provide a solution to the above mentioned problems.25,34 Further, bulk ternary tritellurides CrATe3 (A = Si and Ge) were predicted to have a small band gap of 0.04 and 0.06 eV, respectively.35 In copper–indium–selenium systems, the band gap energies of CuIn3Se5 (1.17 eV) and CuIn5Se8 (1.22–1.24 eV) are larger than that of chalcopyrite-type CuInSe2 (0.99 eV). Importantly, they exhibit a variety of structures depending on the ratio of Cu, In and Se, including chalcopyrite, stannite and wurtzite structures. The crystal structure of the samples changed from chalcopyrite-type CuInSe2 to hexagonal CuIn5Se8 through stannite-type CuIn3Se5 with increasing x (decreasing Cu/In ratio).34
Similar to the ternary copper indium selenide system, ternary 2D systems have multiple degrees of freedom for tailoring their physical properties via stoichiometric variation.23 Further, ternary systems exhibit some properties that are not shown in binary 2D systems. For example, binary 2D materials include metals and semiconductors with exceptionally strong light–matter coupling,36 charge density wave and superconducting order.37–40 One strategy to search theoretically for magnetism in 2D materials is to explore the magnetic properties of the single layers exfoliated from a bulk material that exhibits a robust magnetic order.41 As such, layered ternary 2D systems are an ideal platform for this line of research. MnPX3 ternary chalcogenides are predicted to have strain-tunable ferromagnetic phases.26,42–44 For larger atomic number compounds such as CrGeTe3 and CrSnTe3, the density functional theory (DFT) predicts ferromagnetic semiconducting phases with Curie temperatures of 80–170 K.26,45 The CrGeTe system is a particularly interesting material since it is in a highly rare class of ferromagnetic semiconductors and possesses a layered structure because of the van der Waals bonds. The van der Waals bonds make it a candidate 2D atomic crystal, which is predicted as a platform for the study of 2D semiconducting ferromagnets and for single-layered spintronic devices. Spin–phonon coupling can be a key factor for spin relaxation in spintronic devices. Such coupling has also been confirmed in the CrGeTe system.46
Ternary 2D systems not only exhibit outstanding physical, chemical and electronic properties but also have additional unique properties that binary 2D systems do not possess. In this case, the investigation of ternary 2D systems is of great significance. Fig. 1 summarizes the classification, physical properties and potential applications of ternary 2D materials. In this review, the synthesis of ternary TMDs, MPTs, ternary MXenes and other ternary 2D materials is systematically summarized in Section 2, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), chemical vapor transport (CVT) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In the third section, the structure and characterization of these ternary 2D materials are introduced. Then, the physical properties, including band gap tuning, phase transition and the topological phase are discussed in Section 4. Furthermore, the potential applications, such as in energy, catalysis and devices are presented. The last section presents the future prospects and a summary of the review.

2 Synthesis
2.1 Ternary TMDs
Researchers have confirmed that, compared to BCN, some representative ternary TMDs have no phase separation. Moreover, such ternary TMDs have been predicted to be relatively stable owing to their low mixing free energy.47 CVD is one of the most commonly used methods to obtain ternary TMDs. Shifa et al. devised a rational method to synthesize pure ternary CoxW(1−x)S2 nanosheets by transferring Co from CoO/carbon fiber (CF) nanowires to the already formed WS2/W foil nanosheets. In this experiment, for the first time, Co was incorporated into a WS2 nanosheet without any concomitant side phases.48 Another study reported, for the first time, a one-step CVD strategy for the growth of high-quality ternary alloy Mo(1−x)WxS2 monolayers on SiO2/Si substrates with controllable composition. The Mo(1−x)WxS2 and MoS2(1−x)Se2x alloys, both with excellent uniformity and controllable compositions, were synthesized in this study.51
In another study, a single-crystal monolayer MoxW1−xS2 alloy heterostructure with an in-plane inhomogeneous composition was fabricated using the conventional CVD method.52 Gong et al. reported a one-step direct synthesis of MoS2(1−x)Se2x atomic mono- and bilayers with a broad range of selenium concentrations on SiO2 by CVD (Fig. 2a).49

Reprinted from ref. 23 and 49 with permission from the American Chemical Society and ref. 50 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Another method of preparing ternary TMDs is the CVT approach. For instance, WS2(1−x)Se2x (x = 0.5) crystals have been synthesized by using the CVT method.53 Konkena et al. produced MoSSe@r-GO composite materials, in which MoSSe was synthesized by CVT, followed by a liquid exfoliation process.54 In addition, ZrSxSe2−x, which is a layered n-type TMD semiconductor with an indirect band gap, has been obtained by this method.55 Further, a new ternary phase ZrSTe in the form of a single crystal has been successfully grown from pure elements by using the CVT technique with iodine as the transport agent.56
Ternary TMDs can be obtained easily by exfoliation, including mechanical and electrochemical exfoliation. Łapińska reported the Raman measurements of PbSnS2 thin films obtained by the mechanical exfoliation of a single crystal.57 Yu et al. studied the WSe2(1−x)Te2x monolayer mechanically exfoliated from the bulk by using the CVT method.58 Tan et al. reported the high-yield and scalable preparation of ultrathin 2D TMD nanosheets, including Ta2NiS5 and Ta2NiSe5, in solution via electrochemical Li-intercalation and exfoliation of the layered microflakes. The size of the prepared Ta2NiS5 and Ta2NiS5 nanosheets ranges from tens of nanometers to a few micrometers (Fig. 2b).23
Efforts have been made to find alternative methods of obtaining ternary TMDs. Moreover, PLD, solid-state reactions and hydrothermal methods have been proven to be effective approaches for preparing ternary TMDs. Considering the relatively high growth temperature required for CVD growth that promotes the formation of defects, Yao et al. proposed the growth of large-scale and high-quality Mo0.5W0.5S2 alloy films via PLD.61 Moreover, MoS2(1−x)Se2x is obtained using a high-temperature solid-state reaction technique. Typically, MoS2(1−x)Se2x crystals are obtained by heating a mixture of the constituent elements in the required atomic ratio in an evacuated quartz tube at 800 °C for three days.62 Further, Shen et al. designed FeNi2S4–graphene–MoS2 and FeNi2S4–graphene–MoSe2 composites with an in situ hydrothermal method (Fig. 2c).50,63
2.2 MPTs
The most commonly adopted method of synthesizing MPTs is CVT, which exhibits a high conversion rate of raw materials. Single-crystal FePS3 was grown using this method by Lee et al.64 and Wang et al.65 using pure Fe, P, and S powders. In addition, large single-crystal MnPS3 samples approximately 3.0 × 3.0 mm in size were obtained by using the CVT method with iodine as the transport agent. In this process, stoichiometric amounts of the Mn, P and S powders were used as the reactants, and the reaction was carried out for 120 h in a two-zone electric furnace.66 Du et al. synthesized and exfoliated the bulk crystals of MPS3 (M = Fe, Mn, Ni, Cd, and Zn) sulphides and MPSe3 (M = Fe and Mn) selenides in MPTs, using the CVT and mechanical exfoliation methods, respectively (Fig. 3a).59 In fact, the CVT strategy is also applied to prepare other types of MPTs, such as CoPS3 and SnPS3.67 Note that, in some cases, such as in the synthesis of layered FePS3 and MnPS3, the CVT method is called a solid-state reaction.68,69 Typically, the conventional CVT process requires a long reaction time, making it inconvenient for practical purposes. In light of this situation, Villanueva et al. presented a microwave-assisted preparation of MPS3 materials (M = Mn and Cd), which shortened the reaction time dramatically, allowing an efficient and rapid synthesis of MPS3 materials (Fig. 3b).60

Additional methods have also been used to obtain MPTs, such as the solvent exfoliation and ion-exchange solvothermal methods. In one case, few-layer FePS3 was obtained using solvent exfoliation developed by Mukherjee et al.70 Furthermore, a polycrystalline nanoparticle sample of MnPS3 was prepared via the ion-exchange solvothermal method.74,75
2.3 Ternary MXenes
MXenes, a new and potentially very large group, are first synthesized by selectively etching out certain “A” layers from the MAX phases at room temperature (Fig. 4a).72 The composition of MAX can be expressed as MnAXn-1, where M denotes an early transition metal, A is mainly a group IIIA or IVA element, X is C and/or N, and n = 2–4. As noted, in 2011, Ti3C2 was first synthesized by selectively etching the Al atoms in Ti3AlC2, using aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF) at room temperature.72 The process of Ti3AlC2 etching with HF can be summarized as the following simplified reactions: Ti3AlC2 + 3HF = AlF3 + 3/2H2 + Ti3C2(1) Ti3C2 + 2H2O = Ti3C2(OH)2 + H2(2) Ti3C2 + 2HF = Ti3C2F2 + H2(3)

Reprinted from ref. 13 with permission from the American Chemical Society; ref. 71 with permission from Nature Publishing Group and ref. 72 and 73 with permission from Wiley. 
Reaction (1) is essential and is followed by Reaction (2) and/or (3). Note that by adjusting the etching time and the concentration of HF, numerous MXenes can be synthesized utilizing HF etching from room temperature to 55 °C.76 Meanwhile, a longer reaction time and stronger etching are required for increasing the atomic numbers of M. This phenomenon may be related to the metallic M–Al bonding,77 since a larger number of M valence electrons require stronger etching.78
The etching process is dependent on kinetics. Therefore, the required etching time is different for various MXenes.78 Moreover, a complete dissolution or recrystallization of Mn+1XnTx layers may occur under excessive heating.79,80
Except for HF etching, MXenes can also be obtained by using a mixture of a strong acid and a fluoride salt. Ghidiu et al. reported a synthesis route to multi-layered Ti3C2Tx by immersing Ti3AlC2 in a milder etchant solution composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and lithium fluoride (LiF) (Fig. 4b).83–85 The reaction between HCl and LiF can produce HF, which selectively etches the Al atoms. During the etching process via metal halide, the MXene layers are intercalated by the cations and water molecules, leading to increased interlayer spacing. Compared with pure HF etching, this method can produce single- or few-layer flakes with high efficiency. For example, Lipatov et al. demonstrated an improved method of LiF–HCl selective etching of Ti3AlC2, which yields large, high-quality monolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes with well-defined and clean edges and visually defect-free surfaces.86
To further investigate the 2D properties of the as-prepared multi-layered MXenes, it is imperative and indispensable to obtain single- or few-layer compounds in the production. One effective method to achieve exfoliation is the intercalation of polar organic molecules into the interlayers of MXenes. When DMSO was intercalated into Ti3C2 and then sonicated in water, Ti3C2 delaminated, forming a stable colloidal solution that was filtered to produce MXene ‘paper’.87 In another case, DMSO was replaced by amine to delaminate the second representative of the MXene family-Nb2CTx (Fig. 4c).73 Naguib et al. reported a general approach for the large-scale delamination of MXenes by using a relatively large molecular organic base, namely tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH), choline hydroxide, or n-butylamine.88
Alternative MXene preparation methods have also been explored and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was proven to be feasible (Fig. 4d).89 The MXenes prepared by this method have the characteristics of a large lateral dimension and few defects. However, the detailed experimental conditions need to be explored further.
2.4 BCN and other types of ternary 2D materials
BCN is a representative ternary 2D system that was explored prior to the discovery of graphene.90,91 However, the main obstacle, phase separation, hinders the homogenous synthesis of this material.47 Although numerous studies have been conducted and methods proposed to obtain h-BCN, obtaining the ‘real’ BCN without phase separation remains a challenge. The methods of preparing BCN are found to be diverse, among which CVD is the most commonly adopted method. Indeed, by providing the B, C and N sources, the BCN layer can be synthesized.22,92 A catalyst-free CVD synthesis of BCN nanosheets with a tunable B and N bond structure by thermally decomposing solid urea, boric acid and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precursors was developed.93 Liu et al. demonstrated the epitaxial growth of a single-atomic-layer, in-plane heterostructure of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) by atmospheric-pressure CVD. Interestingly, in this case, the h-BN lattice orientation is only determined by the graphene (Fig. 5a).81 Gong's group has demonstrated a direct chemical conversion of graphene to high-quality BCN with a full range of compositions, which systematically converts conducting graphene into semiconducting ternary h-BCN.94 This strategy makes it possible to produce uniform BCN structures without disrupting the structural integrity of the original graphene templates.91,94

Reprinted from ref. 81 with permission from Science and ref. 82 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Pulsed laser deposition (PLD), a facile and efficient technique for growing high quality thin films, can control the structure and composition of the as-prepared film. Moreover, compared with CVD, the flammable gas hydrogen is not required for the PLD method. Amorphous BCN films were synthesized by PLD under various laser fluences. The bonding structure of the as-prepared films changed according to the laser fluences.37 In another study, Zhang et al. fabricated BCN films with a large carbon stoichiometric range using PLD with BN-N sources.95
Huang et al. developed a facile carbon-doping pyrolysis synthesis method to produce BCN nanosheets. In brief, the mixture containing glucose, boron oxide and urea was put into a tube furnace in an ammonia atmosphere for 5 h at 1250 °C.96 Bulk BCN spheres were deposited on the substrate via an organic precursor pyrolysis method. Moreover, BCN materials with a tunable structure, including microspheres and nanoflakes were obtained by controlling the heat treatment of BCN organic precursor pyrolysis.97,98 Recently, the in-vacuum thermolysis of a single-source precursor, ethane 1,2-diamineborane (BH3NH2CH2CH2NH2BH3), was performed to form bulk ternary BCN. The authors aimed to reduce the presence of oxides at the BCN surface, an essential issue linked to many potential applications of BCN materials.99
Ma et al. proposed a ‘thermal substitution’ method for preparing BCN nanosheets through substitutional C doping of h-BN nanosheets (Fig. 5b). In comparison to the existing synthesis methods, it has several advantages, such as milder reaction conditions and higher yield. Owing to the adjustable C content of the BCN, a tuned band gap was achieved.82,98
Many attempts were made to explore other methods of obtaining BCN, including magnetron sputtering100 and ion beam-assisted deposition (IBAD).101 For example, well-adherent BCN thin films with different compositions were grown by the reactive DC magnetron sputtering of a B4C target with different nitrogen flows.104 A further example is the deposition of BCN coatings with controlled atomic compositions using the IBAD technique with composite C/B targets.101
Beniwal et al. utilized thermally induced dehydrogenation of the B2N2C2H12 precursor molecules and formed an epitaxial BCN monolayer on Ir (111) through covalent bond formation. In this experiment, atomically flat Ir substrates were exposed under ultrahigh vacuum to bis-BN cyclohexane vapor.105
In addition to the materials mentioned above, other types of ternary 2D materials, such as Bi2O2Se106 and Cr1−xGexTe, have been reported.46 Recently, Peng et al. reported ultrathin films of non-encapsulated layered Bi2O2Se,106 grown by a home-made low-pressure CVD system, which demonstrate excellent air stability and high-mobility semiconducting behavior. A Hall mobility value of more than 20000 cm2 V−1 s−1 was measured in as-grown Bi2O2Se nanoflakes at low temperatures. Bi2O3 powder and Bi2Se3 bulk were the source materials. The ultrahigh mobility characteristics of Bi2O2Se may be more generally applicable to other ternary members (Bi2O2S and Bi2O2Te) with tunable band gaps. In 2016, Fukuma et al. synthesized IV–VI diluted magnetic semiconductor Ge1−xCrxTe epilayers on SrF2 substrates by using the MBE method.46 The Cr composition increased up to x = 0.1, compared with that of x = 0.06 on the BaF2 substrates. The Curie temperature increased with an increase in the Cr composition, and a relatively high value of 200K was realized in the diluted magnetic semiconductors.
3 Structure, characterization and properties
3.1 Ternary TMDs
Compared with binary TMDs, ternary TMDs enable the control of local electronic structures and provide flexibility to fine tune the specific properties and applications by adding a third element to the structure.47,58,62,102,103,107–109 Ternary TMDs have a general formula of M′aM′′(1−a)X2 (M′ and M′′ are two different transition metals; X = S, Se or Te; a = 0 to 1) or M X′2aX′′2(1−a) (M = transition metals; X′ = S, Se, and Te; X′′ = S, Se, and Te; X′ ≠ X′′; a = 0 to 1).
The structure of MX2 (M = Mo and W; X = S and Se) is shown in Fig. 6. In MoS2, each Mo center occupies a trigonal coordination sphere that is bound to six S atoms. Each S atom is connected to three Mo centers. In ternary TMD Mo1−xWxS2 and MoS2xSe2(1−x), the Mo or S atoms are replaced by the W or Se atoms with different mole ratios.
 Fig. 6  (a) Structure of Mo1−xWxS2 (x = 0.5). Reprinted from ref. 102 with permission from the American Chemical Society. (b) Structure of MoS2xSe2(1−x). Reprinted from ref. 103 with permission from Wiley. 
Xi et al.110 calculated the composition-dependent electronic properties of Mo1−xWxS2 by using first-principles calculations. The absolute levels of the HOMO and LUMO in Mo1−xWxS2 were determined by vacuum level calibration (Fig. 7a). As the number of W atoms increases, the HOMO level rises linearly and the LUMO level exhibits an energy bowing, which further lead to the band gap bowing effect in Mo1−xWxS2. The experimental band gap changes were observed using PL measurements by Chen et al.102 As the W composition x increases, the A exciton emission red-shifts and then blue-shifts (Fig. 7b). In contrast, the B exciton emission blue-shifts continuously (Fig. 7c). The exciton emission can be tuned from 1.82 to 1.99 eV, whereas the B exciton emission can be tuned from 1.98 to 2.36 eV. The bowing effect can also be seen from the PL measurement. By fitting the experimental data, we can obtain the bowing parameter of 0.25 ± 0.04 eV and 0.19 ± 0.06 eV for A exciton emission and B exciton emission, respectively (Fig. 7d). With increasing selenium content in MoS2xSe2(1−x),49,62,108 all main diffraction peaks are downshifted continuously (Fig. 8a). Because of the gradual expansion of unit cells upon the substitution of sulphur atoms with larger selenium atoms, the (100) and (110) peaks are downshifted, which implies their mixing at the atomic level. Furthermore, the (103) peak intensity becomes more heightened. From the Raman spectra (Fig. 8b) under 514 nm laser excitation, two sets of composition-dependent vibration modes can be observed: Mo–Se related modes at low frequency (200–300 cm−1) and Mo–S related modes at high frequency (350–410 cm−1), which belong to the typical MoS2xSe2(1−x) alloy.111,112 With the introduction of selenium, the two vibration modes (E2g at 381 cm−1 and A1g at 403 cm−1) shift to a lower frequency. Simultaneously, Mo–Se related modes (E2g at 285 cm−1 and A1g at 236 cm−1) start to gain increasing intensity. The PL measurements (Fig. 8c) confirmed the optical band gap change from 1.85 to 1.54 eV with increasing selenium content. The optical band gap was linearly dependent on the Se concentration in MoS2xSe2(1−x). This linear dependence was also confirmed by Kiran et al. (Fig. 8h).62 From the XPS results (Fig. 8d–f), with increasing Se concentration, the intensity of the S 2p peaks (∼162.3 and 161.2 eV) decreases, whereas peaks from Se 3p3/2 (∼159.8 eV) and Se 3d (∼54 eV, Fig. 8e) appear and become dominant.

Yu et al.58 reported that the phase transition from 2H to the 1Td structure occurred in WSe2(1−x)Te2x. The crystal structure of 2H WSe2(1−x)Te2x was similar to that of 2H MoS2, which showed WSe6 or WSe/Te6 triangular prism layers bonded together (Fig. 9a). In contrast, in the 1Td WSe2(1−x)Te2x structure, the WTe6 or WSe/Te6 octahedra were linked with each other by sharing the Te–Te edges (Fig. 9b). By tuning the concentration of Te from 0% to 100%, 2H WSe2(1−x)Te2x was obtained at x = 0–0.4, while 1Td WSe2(1−x)Te2x was obtained at x = 0.7–1.0. Interestingly, at x = 0.5 to 0.6, an intermediate state appears with two phases (1Td and 2H) (Fig. 9c). The phase transition is confirmed by the PL spectra of the monolayer samples excited with a 532 nm laser. The PL peak continuously shifts from 744 nm to 857 nm (near infrared). No PL signal is detected when x ≥ 0.6 for the 1Td samples (Fig. 9d). In Fig. 9e, the band gaps are shifted continuously from 1.67 eV to 1.44 eV. Furthermore, the optical gap directly changes from 1.44 to 0 eV when x ≥ 0.6. This indicates that WSe2(1−x)Te2x alloys undergo a phase transition from semiconductor (2H phase) to metal (1Td phase).

Weyl fermions have been known since the early twentieth century as chiral particles associated with solutions to the Dirac equation at zero mass.113,114 There is only one type of Weyl fermion in high-energy physics, but exactly two types of Weyl points (WPs)115 in condensed matter systems. In type-I Weyl semi-metals, the bulk Fermi surface shrinks to a point at the Weyl node, whereas in type-II Weyl semimetals, the Weyl cone arises as a connector of holes and electron pockets, where the large tilt of the cone induces a finite density of states at the node energy. This fundamental difference can, for instance, cause an anomalous Hall effect in type-II Weyl semimetals. Belopolski et al.115,116 reported the experimental discovery of the first type-II Weyl semi-metal in MoxW1−xTe2. Then, it was further predicted that a type-II Weyl semi-metal arises in binary and WTe2.116,117 Concurrently, MoTe2 and other ternary TMDs were predicted to be Weyl semi-metals.118 Koepernik et al. identified TaIrTe4 as a new member of this family of Weyl semi-metals.118 TaIrTe4 has the attractive feature that it hosts only four well-separated Weyl points, the minimum imposed by symmetry. Moreover, the topological surface states, Fermi arcs and connecting Weyl nodes of opposite chirality extend to approximately 1/3 of the surface Brillouin zone. This large momentum-space separation is highly favourable for detecting the Fermi arcs spectroscopically and in transport experiments. All three telluride compounds show a minimum set of four Weyl points, occurring at very similar positions in the k space.
3.2 MPTs
Metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPTs) have been in existence since the 19th century, and have not been explored comprehensively at the atomically thin level.120 Their general formula is MIIPX3 (MII = Fe, Mn, Zn, Co, Ni, Cd, Mg, etc.; X = S and Se) and MIMIIIP2X6 (MI = Ag and Cu; MIII = Cr, V, Al, Ga, In, Bi, etc.). The metal of the MPT family is mainly from vanadium to zinc, which has more possible compounds than TMDs (IVB, VB and VIB).121
In MPX3 crystals, each unit cell is composed of two cations and one [P2X6]4− cluster. The M atoms are coordinated with six X atoms, while the P atoms are coordinated with three X atoms and one P atom to form a [P2S6]4− unit, which is arranged as a honeycomb structure (as shown in Fig. 10a). The atomic layers of the sulphides stack in the C2/m space group (Fig. 10b) while those of the selenide stack in R-3 (Fig. 10c). The two cations can be two MII or one MI with MIII.

In bulk MPX3 crystals, due to the changes of the metal and chalcogenide atoms, the band gap can range from 1.3 to 3.5 eV (Table 1), which indicates a wide wavelength optoelectronic response. From DFT calculations,122 the monolayer metal phosphorous trichalcogenides have very low formation energies and the band gap can vary in a wide range (Fig. 11a). Meanwhile, the electronic structures are affected greatly by the metal or the chalcogenide atoms. It is interesting that for all the listed monolayer MPX3 in Fig. 11a, the minimum potentials of the conduction bands are higher than the reduction potential of hydrogen, and the maximum potentials of the valence bands are lower than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O. These results indicate that such materials are thermodynamically feasible for both water oxidation and reduction reactions. Furthermore, the strain in monolayer MPX3 (M = Zn and Cd; X = S and Se) also affects the band structure and further modulates the electronic structures.123 Transitions between indirect and direct band gaps are observed using compressive strain engineering for ZnPS3, ZnPSe3 and CdPSe3, but not for CdPS3.

(b) Raman spectrum of transition metal MPS3 phases. Reprinted from ref. 67 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
The Raman mode of MPS3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, and Cd) originates from two parts of the structure. One part is attributed to the [P2S6]4− cluster and eight Raman active modes with D3d symmetry (3A1g and 5Eg Raman active modes).67 The A1g modes can be observed at around 590, 387 and 255 cm−1 and Eg modes at around 560, 283, 235, 180 and 150 cm−1. The overtones of the A1g modes are not observed in all MPS3 compounds. In particular, they were found in NiPS3 at 815 and 1189 cm−1, at 764 cm−1 in MnPS3 and at 1145 cm−1 in ZnPS3.67 The other Raman modes are attributed to the cation vibration.124,125 The Raman spectra of MPS3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, and Cd) are shown in Fig. 11b. In FePS3 and FePSe3, the intralayer modes exhibit a slighter Raman shift when the crystal thickness decreases, even to monolayers.59
Owing to the difference in the metal atoms in MPX3, trisulphides with M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni undergo a paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition with decreasing temperature. However, SnPS3, ZnPS3 and CdPS3 exhibit only diamagnetic behavior. The Néel temperature can be obtained from the magnetic susceptibility measurement (as shown in Fig. 12a). Within the trisulphide series, the Néel temperature increases with an increase in the atomic number and the orbital component enhances the total effective magnetic moment (from the pure spin moment for Mn to the highest orbital moment for Ni).67Table 2 summarizes the Néel temperature of MPS3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) obtained by different measurements. When some MPS3 crystals are exfoliated down to the monolayer, the Néel temperature decreases. From Table 2, the Néel temperature of bulk FePS3 is approximately 116–120 K. Wang et al.65 reported that the Néel temperature decreased to 104 K for the FePS3 monolayers, as shown in Fig. 12b–d. Furthermore, Toyoshima et al.66 found that the pressure also affects the Néel temperature. The Néel temperature decreased from 86 K to 78 K for MnPS3 bulk crystals at an applied pressure of 0.47 GPa.

3.3 Ternary MXenes
Transition metal carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides (MXenes) are a new class of 2D materials. They have the general formula of MnXn−1Tx (n = 2–4), where M denotes early transition metals (Sc, Ti, Zr, V, Cr, Mo, etc.), X represents carbon and/or nitrogen and Tx indicates surface terminators.78,127,128 In general, MXenes are obtained by the selective etching of the A element layers from the MAX (MnAXn−1: M = metal; A = Group IIIA or IVA elements; X = carbon and/or nitrogen) phases at room temperature.79,129 Due to the etching process, MXenes are always surface terminated with groups such as F, OH, and O after their exfoliation from the MAX phase.77Fig. 13 displays the structure of MnXn−1, which shows n layers of M cover with n − 1 layers of X in an [MX]n−1M arrangement. When there is more than one metal in the structure, it exhibits two forms: solid solutions and ordered phases. The two different metals are randomly arranged in solid solution MXenes, while in ordered phases MXenes, single or double layers of one metal are between the layers of a second metal.78 Through DFT calculations, ordered MXenes have been shown to be energetically more stable than their solid-solution counterparts for certain combinations of transition metals.130 More than 25 different ordered MXenes have been predicted as shown in Fig. 13. In this review, we only emphasise the properties of ternary (multiple metals) MXenes. Anasori et al.130 reported that more than 25 ternary MXenes have a stable ordered structure, based on DFT calculations. For MXenes with the M′2M′′C2 composition, Mo2TiC2, Mo2VC2, Mo2TaC2, Mo2NbC2, Cr2TiC2, Cr2VC2, Cr2TaC2, Cr2NbC2, Ti2NbC2, Ti2TaC2, V2TaC2 and V2TiC2 have a fully ordered state at 0 K. Moreover, Nb2VC2, Ta2TiC2, Ta2VC2 and Nb2TiC2 are more stable in their partially ordered state than in their fully ordered state. In contrast, MXenes with the M′2M′′2C3 composition, Mo2Ti2C3, Mo2V2C3, Mo2Nb2C3, Mo2Ta2C3, Cr2Ti2C3, Cr2V2C3, Cr2Nb2C3, Cr2Ta2C3, Nb2Ta2C3, Ti2Nb2C3, Ti2Ta2C3, V2Ta2C3, V2Nb2C3 and V2Ti2C3 are ordered at 0 K. They found that the Mo and Cr atoms avoid the middle layers, whereas Ta and Nb are preferred. Furthermore, in all the cases, the total density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level (Ef) is dominated by the M–M d-orbitals, irrespective of surface termination.
 Fig. 13  MXenes reported so far. MXenes can have at least three different formulas: M2X, M3X2 and M4X3. They can be made in three different forms: mono-M elements; a solid solution of at least two different M elements; or ordered double-M elements, solid solutions on the X site produce carbonitrides. Reprinted from ref. 78 with permission from Nature Publishing Group. 
Anasori et al.130 also synthesized Mo2TiC2 and Mo2Ti2C3 by etching Al from their MAX phases (Mo2TiAlC2 and Mo2Ti2AlC3, respectively). The synthesis and structure of Mo2TiC2 and Mo2Ti2C3 are shown in Fig. 14. The MAX phase peaks in the XRD patterns disappeared after etching and the Al signals showed a significant drop, which confirmed the formation of MXenes. The yields of the two compounds are almost 100%. The 3D to 2D transformations in both materials were confirmed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the layers opened after etching. The high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscope (HRSTEM) images of Mo2TiC2, Mo2Ti2C3, Mo2TiAlC2 and Mo2Ti2AlC3 clearly show the removal of the Al layers by etching. Mo2TiC2 with surface terminators can be delaminated by first intercalating dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then sonicating in water. After delamination, a stable colloidal solution is obtained, which can be used to form freestanding conductive papers.

Khazaei et al.131 found that M′2M′′C2 compounds (M′ = Mo and W; M′′ = Ti, Zr, and Hf) with O2 as the surface terminator are topological insulators. W2HfC2O2 shows the largest band gap (0.285 eV). Such large band gaps pave the way for the practical application of topological insulators at room temperature. Furthermore, M′2M′′2C3O2 (M′ = Mo and W; M′′ = Ti and Zr) are topological semi-metals. The first Sc-containing MAX phase was reported by Meshkian et al.132 very recently. Mo2ScC2 MXene is obtained by the selective etching of the Al-layers in hydrofluoric acid. It expands the attainable range of MXene compositions and widens the prospects for property tuning.
3.4 BCN and other ternary 2D materials
The h-BCN system is another important type of ternary 2D material. Theoretical calculations92 indicate that homogenous h-BCN tends to form graphene and h-BN domains separately (Fig. 15a). So far, a homogeneous ternary BCN without phase separation has not been realized. The chemical composition and structure of h-BCN can be analyzed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Three visible edges of h-BCN films were observed, starting at 185, 276 and 393 eV (Fig. 15b), which corresponded to the characteristic K-shell ionization edges of B, C and N, respectively.22,133 Furthermore, such types of EELS edge structures indicate that all three elements are sp2 hybridized.133 Owing to domain separation, the band gap engineering can be tuned by controlling the concentration of carbon. The optical band gap of h-BCN with different domain concentrations was measured by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra (Fig. 15c–e). The h-BN sample shows one absorption edge at 218 nm, which corresponds to an optical band gap of 5.69 eV (Fig. 15c). With C concentrations of 65 at% and 84 at%, the band gaps are 4.48 and 3.85 eV, respectively. This indicates that the band gap decreases with a decrease in the h-BN domain. Furthermore, a second absorption edge was observed, which corresponds to the optical band gap of 1.62 and 1.51 eV from the samples with 65 and 84 at% C, respectively. This absorption edge can be assigned to the h-BN-doped graphene domains.

Wu et al.134 reported a new ternary 2D material (Bi2O2Se) with an ultrahigh Hall mobility of >20000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at low temperatures. It shows a tetragonal structure with the I4/mmm space group and consists of Bi2O2 planar covalent layers sandwiched by Se atoms with relatively weak electrostatic interactions (Fig. 16a). It does not show standard van der Waals gaps compared with TMDs. Therefore, the cleavage should be along the Se planes, which results in a possible rearrangement of the surface atomic structure. Bi2O2Se preferentially crystallizes onto a mica substrate with a large lateral size. Fig. 16b shows the morphology of Bi2O2Se, which exhibits a square shape and ultra-flat surfaces. The temperature dependence of Hall mobility is shown in Fig. 16c. Bi2O2Se flakes exhibit the electron Hall mobility of 18500–28900 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 1.9 K. Lei et al.25 reported another ternary copper indium selenide 2D material (CuIn7Se11) with a good photo-response. The side view of the CuIn7Se11 structure is shown in Fig. 16d. The inter-layer distance in this material is 1.6 nm and it shows standard van der Waals gaps between layers. This layer structure is confirmed by SEM, as shown in Fig. 16e, which indicates a weak interlayer interaction. Fig. 16f shows the photo-response of the few-layer CuIn7Se11. The dark current of the device is in the order of 1 pA, which is very low compared to most layered material based photodetectors.27,33 When CuIn7Se11 is illuminated by a 543 nm laser with intensities of 20 mW cm−2 and 50 mW cm−2, the device shows a strong photo-response.

Very recently, Gong et al.135 reported a long-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 van der Waals crystals. By the investigation of the temperature and magnetic-field-dependent Kerr effect via scanning magneto-optic Kerr microscopy, the ferromagnetic transition temperature was controlled. The crystal structure (side and top views) of Cr2Ge2Te6 is shown in Fig. 17a. Cr2Ge2Te6 is a new layered material belonging to the lamellar ternary M2X2Te6 chalcogenide family (where M denotes a +3 oxidation state metal and X2 represents a silicon or a germanium pair). It has an interlayer van der Waals spacing of 3.4 Å. Schematic representations of the magnon density of states per spin around the low-energy band edge of the monolayer, multi-layer and bulk ferromagnetic materials are presented in Fig. 17b–d. These figures show that the density of states per spin for the magnon modes near the excitation gap is rapidly reduced. Fig. 17e shows the transition temperatures TC of samples of different thicknesses, obtained from the Kerr measurements (blue squares) and theoretical calculations (red circles). A strong dimensionality effect is observed, in line with the experimental observations. A ferromagnetic hysteresis loop with single-domain remanence in a six-layer Cr2Ge2Te6 crystal is shown in Fig. 17f. The almost saturated Kerr signal at 0.6 T shows approximately 75 μrad per layer. Under a magnetic field, there is a clear contrast between the insensitivity of the transition temperature of the three-dimensional system. By using the renormalized spin wave theory to analyze the observed phenomena, we concluded that the relationship between the transition temperature and the magnetic field is the intrinsic specificity of the 2D ferromagnetic molecular crystal. In this 2D molecular ferromagnetic material, for the first time, a very small magnetic field (less than 0.3 T) was used to achieve transition temperature (ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state transition between the temperatures) regulation. Their experimental observations may provide a generic understanding of the ferromagnetic behavior of many soft, 2D van der Waals ferromagnets, such as Cr2Si2Te6 and CrI3.

4 Potential applications
4.1 Energy storage
Energy storage is an important application of 2D materials. Batteries and supercapacitors are two main types of energy storage devices. Extensive studies have been reported for binary 2D materials; however, as far as we know, only a few reports have been published for ternary 2D materials. Since their discovery, MXenes have been explored for use as anodes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as well as for supercapacitor and pseudo-capacitor applications owing to their promising features such as sufficiently large electrochemically active surfaces, excellent electrical conductivity, exceptional mechanical properties and tunable band gap energies. In addition, the structure of layered MXenes not only allows the intercalation of a variety of organic and inorganic molecules/ions but also disperses easily in aqueous solutions (hydrophilic).128,136–139 DFT calculations predict that a higher formula unit of MXenes leads to a fast diffusion rate but low reversible capacity as compared to that of the lower formula unit, and vice versa.140 Ternary MXenes, in accordance with their binary analogues, exhibit a striking ability to store Li+/Na+ and exhibit a superior specific capacity with improved stability.
To date, limited ternary MXene materials, such as Mo2ScC2, (Nb0.8Ti0.2)4C3Tx and (Nb0.8Zr0.2)4C3Tx,132,138,141 have been studied for energy storage applications. Barsoum et al.142 reported two Nb4AlC3-based solid solution MAX phases (Nb0.8Ti0.2)4AlC3 and (Nb0.8Zr0.2)4AlC3, and their corresponding MXenes, (Nb0.8Ti0.2)4C3Tx and (Nb0.8Zr0.2)4C3Tx, were synthesized. Substituting 20 at% of Nb atoms with Ti or Zr atoms did not result in significant changes in the Li uptake compared with Nb4C3Tx. (Nb0.8Ti0.2)4C3Tx and (Nb0.8Zr0.2)4C3Tx retained the specific capacities of 158 and 132 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles, respectively.
Barsoum et al.130 synthesized Mo2TiC2, Mo2Ti2C3 and Cr2TiC2 ternary MXenes, and explored the potential of Mo2TiC2 with respect to electrochemical energy storage. The Mo2TiC2Tx electrode showed a stable capacity of about 176 mA h g−1 in the second cycle and retained about 82% of this capacity after 160 cycles (Fig. 18). About 92% of the 260 mA h g−1 capacity was retained after 25 cycles at C/10. At both rates, coulombic efficiencies higher than 97% were observed after the first cycle. Considering that more than 20 theoretically predicted members belong to the ternary system, further exploration regarding electrochemical performance with various MXenes is expected.

As early as 1977, Thompson et al.143 used NiPS3 as a cathode in Li-ion batteries. NiPS3 has a capacitance of 1 kWh kg and a capacity retention of 30% after 300 cycles. Following this, Kuz'minskii et al.144 investigated the electrochemical properties of the layered NiPS3 compound at 200 °C. They found that the reversible behavior of the NiPS3 electrode was possible during the charge/discharge cycles within the 0 ≤ Li/Ni ≤ 3 range.
Even though numerous reports on binary TMDs for applications in batteries and supercapacitors have been published,50,145–147 limited research was found on ternary TMDs. Zhang et al.148 developed a novel and effective strategy to distort the lattice structure of MoSSe and tune its properties for Li–O2 batteries (Fig. 19). The Li–O2 batteries can deliver a high discharge capacity of 708.24 mA h g−1 for a metastable MoSSe solid solution at the current density of 50 mA g−1. Further, they also showed a high specific capacity of ∼730 mA h g−1 with stable discharge–charge overpotentials (0.17/0.49 V) over 30 cycles.

4.2 Electrocatalysts
Hydrogen is the most environmentally friendly fuel with the largest energy density, and may be the world's primary fuel source in the future.149 However, hydrogen is not found naturally in the high-density gas form.127 Water splitting is an important clean energy technology to produce hydrogen. It involves the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (2H2O → 4e− + 4H+ + O2) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (2H+ + 2e− → H2). Platinum is the most efficient catalyst for the HER (Tafel slope: 29 mV per dec).54 However, platinum is quite expensive and the resource is limited, and therefore, the usage is restricted.150–152 Despite the fact that many binary MXene studies have been reported on the HER application,153–155 the reports on ternary MXenes are rather rare. In this section, we emphasize MPTs and TTMDs.
From DFT calculations,122 metal phosphorous trichalcogenides were found to have the potential to be used in the HER and OER. Pumera et al.67 reported the HER, OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for several metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (Fig. 20). The onset potentials of NiPS3 (−0.53 V vs. the RHE), CoPS3 (−0.59 V vs. the RHE), and FePS3 (−0.86 V vs. the RHE) lie between the onset potentials of Pt (−0.103 V vs. the RHE) and glassy carbon (GC) (−0.89 V vs. the RHE). The high HER activity for NiPS3 and CoPS3 may be attributed to the crystal structure. The highest catalytic efficiency was observed for NiPS3 with a Tafel slope at an average of ∼56 mV per dec. In addition, ZnPS3 (75 mV per dec) and CoPS3 (84 mV per dec) have a Tafel slope less than 100 mV per dec. The best catalytic performance for the OER was observed on CoPS3 with an onset potential of 0.84 V at 10 mA cm−2, and the current density reached 30 mA cm−2. However, other materials exhibited lower OER activities. The best performance of the ORR is observed in MnPS3. The reduction peak was at about −0.28 V vs. the RHE, while for Pt the reduction peak was at about −0.21 V vs. the RHE.

Various binary TMDs, particularly MoS2 and WS2, have been confirmed to be efficient non-Pt catalysts for the HER.158–163 It is easy to tune the electronic structure of MS2xSe2(1−x) (M = Mo, W, and Co) upon Se/S incorporation, which probably further assists in the realization of high HER activity.54,62,108 Kiran et al.62 reported the HER properties of MoSSe. MoSSe has a more positive onset potential for the HER than the few-layer pristine MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets. A typical Tafel slope obtained for MoSSe is 56 mV per dec, which is quite smaller than that of MoS2 (96 mV per dec) and MoSe2 (95 mV per dec). Konkena et al.54 synthesized MoSSe@reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) nanocomposite heterostructures to further improve the HER performance. The onset potential of the MoSSe@r-GO composite nanostructures further positively shifted. The enhanced catalytic activity was realized owing to the superior electron transfer efficiency caused by the electronic conductivity of r-GO. The Tafel slopes of the MoSSe@rGO composite and MoSSe are 51 and 63 mV per dec, respectively. Such low Tafel slopes indicate faster reaction kinetics during hydrogen evolution than in the case of MoSS nanosheets.
Xu et al.156 synthesized WS2xSe2(1−x) nanotubes and investigated the HER performance. MoS2xSe2(1−x) (x = 0.48) shows the best HER catalytic activity among all electrocatalysts shown in Fig. 21a. Both the increased number of active sites and higher conductivity of MoS2xSe2(1−x) (x = 0.48) are responsible for the good HER performance. The Tafel slopes (Fig. 21b) of the WSe2 and MoS2xSe2(1−x) (x = 0.48) are 99 and 105 mV per dec, respectively, which are lower than that of WS2 (113 mV per dec).164 Liu et al.157 presented the HER performance of CoS2xSe2(1−x) nanowires (Fig. 21c and d). MoS2xSe2(1−x) (x = 0.67) shows a more positive onset potential for the HER than the CoS2 and CoSe2 nanowires. The linear parts of the Tafel plots reveal a low Tafel slope of 44 mV per dec for MoS2xSe2(1−x) (x = 0.67), which is lower than that of CoS2 (68.7 mV per dec) and CoSe2 (45.8 mV per dec). This may be due to the optimal electronic structure of the catalyst incorporating S and Se atoms.165

4.3 Other applications
Owing to their unique structure and properties, ternary 2D systems are good candidates for investigating device applications, such as photodetectors, solar cells, sensors and FETs. Thus, it is important to fabricate high-performance devices using ternary 2D materials. Ternary copper indium selenide has a high photoresponsivity and wide spectral response range, and it has been intensively investigated for application in photodetectors. Ajayan et al. successfully synthesized and isolated high-quality few-layered flakes of ternary CuIn7Se11, and characterized their photocurrent properties using photoconductivity measurements (Fig. 22).25 Atomically layered CuIn7Se11 (CIS) with Ti/Au electrodes shows an excellent photoresponse with a low dark current of 1 pA, an S/N larger than 95 dB for 1 mW cm−2 543 nm illumination, a relatively fast response time of 24 ms and a large linear dynamic range of 70 dB. These properties indicate that atomically layered CuIn7Se11 is a very good candidate for 2D photodetectors. Further, they demonstrated 2D CuIn7Se11 photovoltaic devices based on an asymmetric Schottky junction architecture. They observed a 2D photovoltaic effect with a power efficiency of 0.04% and an IPCE of 1.7%. This device performance can be readily improved by optimizing the electrode materials and channel lengths. Their study shows that layered CuIn7Se11 is a highly promising ternary platform for atomically layered optoelectronic device development.

The electronic and photo-responsive properties of atomically thin ReSSe were reported by Liu et al.109 They made an n-type few-layered ReSSe transistor, and the electron mobility was found to be about 3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Because of the direct band gap nature of ReSSe, photosensitive devices based on few-layer ReSSe exhibit a very high photo-responsivity, up to 8 AW−1. In combination with large-area material preparation methods such as liquid scale exfoliation or chemical vapour deposition, the composition-dependent band gaps of ReSSe alloys make ReSSe a promising material for optoelectronic applications and could enable the fabrication of low-cost and efficient optoelectronic devices.
The fabrication of high-yield and large-scale ultrathin 2D ternary chalcogenide nanosheets in solution by exfoliation of their layered microflakes, including Ta2NiS5 and Ta2NiSe5, was reported.23 Single-layer Ta2NiS5 nanosheets with a yield of approximately 86% were obtained. Due to their high fluorescence quenching ability, a novel fluorescent sensor for the detection of DNA was developed on the basis of single-layer Ta2NiS5 nanosheets. It showed excellent selectivity and sensitivity with a detection limit of 50 pM, which is better than that of the single-layer MoS2-based biosensor (Fig. 23). This highly selective and sensitive biosensor might be used for real sample analysis in the near future.

5 Summary and outlook
This review summarizes recent work on various ternary 2D materials, including MTPs, ternary MXenes, ternary TMDs and other ternary 2D materials, regarding synthetic methods, structures, key properties (band gap tuning, phase transition and topological phase) and their potential applications. Ternary 2D systems provide additional degrees of freedom to tailor their band gap tuning and physical properties via stoichiometric engineering. As such, layered ternary 2D systems are an ideal platform for this line of research. However, to realize practical device applications, such as FETs, sensors and photodetectors, more effort is required to address the numerous issues related to the synthesis of materials. Technologies need to be developed to make high-quality layered ternary 2D materials with controlled layer numbers, size and homogeneity. In the present study, as described in the growth section, most ternary 2D materials are obtained by CVT and mechanical exfoliation methods. For instance, new ternary phase ZrSTe has been grown using the CVT technique, few-layered ReSSe and PbSnS2 thin films are obtained by mechanical exfoliation from single crystals, and the most commonly adopted method of synthesizing MPTs is also realized by the CVT method. Given the advantage of the CVD method used in the binary 2D system, we may predict one promising direction in this field, i.e. CVD growth of high quality and large size few-layer ternary 2D crystals with controlled numbers. However, there are many challenges to produce single-layer and few-layer ternary 2D materials by the CVD method because the control of three elements is more difficult than binary ones. These need the efforts of more researchers. Meanwhile, approaches to control the composition of ternary 2D materials also need to be developed. For applications, for instance, studies on energy storage for ternary 2D materials are very limited. In this case, ternary MXenes show a striking ability to store Li+/Na+ and exhibit a superior specific capacity with improved stability compared to their binary systems. The distinctive properties of ternary MXene sheets make them promising candidates for electrode materials in LIBs and supercapacitors. Therefore, to further investigate the properties of ternary MXenes, it is imperative and indispensable to obtain single- or few-layers in the production by the exfoliation–intercalation method. As we reviewed above, ternary 2D systems are good candidates for investigating device applications (photodetectors, solar cells, sensors and FETs). Thus, it is important to fabricate high-performance devices using ternary 2D materials. Especially, ternary heterostructure devices have not been realized. They are expected to show high performance in photodetectors or other unique applications. In summary, for ternary 2D materials, the synthesis, potential applications, optical properties and fundamental physical properties all await further research efforts and increased understanding. We believe that ternary 2D materials are great candidates for application, and we hope more researchers will explore this area of materials and produce significant scientific developments.
