    , Accepted 20th March 2023First published on 20th March 2023AbstractAnion vacancies at the interface play a vital role in the augmented performance of oxide semiconductors in photocatalysis. The existence of anion vacancies not only improves conductivity but also affects light absorption and suppresses recombination, resulting in enhanced performance. This work reports the role of selenium vacancies at the interface between ZnSe and g-C3N4. After the addition of g-C3N4, selenium vacancies were induced at the interface between ZnSe and g-C3N4. The vacancies generated from the addition of g-C3N4 promote photogenerated charge carrier separation for improved photoelectrochemical performance. To corroborate this point, ZnSe and g-C3N4, via facile anion exchange, spin-coating and annealing, sequentially, were prepared on hydrothermally prepared ZnO as a ternary junction photoanode. Experimental measurements depicted the presence of Se vacancies in ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 annealed at 350 °C under N2, whereas the annealing conditions at 300 °C in air result in the formation of SeO2 at the interface due to partial oxidation of ZnSe. The Se vacancies significantly enhance the transport of charge carriers and thus prominently improve the photocurrent performance, whereas the existence of the SeO2 phase hampered the performance. The current study sheds light on how interfacial anion vacancies affect various aspects of important factors behind the photoelectrochemical performance, which provides meaningful scientific insights into the development of more efficient photoanodes in the future.
Introduction
For the conversion of inexhaustible solar energy into chemical energy in the form of storable and transportable hydrogen, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an environmentally friendly approach.1,2 Based on reports on energy conversion efficiency obtained from light harvesting, charge transfer, and charge transport efficiency, pioneering approaches have been demonstrated to realize the augmented efficiency. After a breakthrough in 1972 by Honda and Fujishima in PEC water splitting using TiO2 photoanodes under UV irradiation, numerous metal oxides like ZnO, BiVO4, Fe2O3, and WO3 have been employed as photoanodes.3,4 However, the inherent disadvantages of pristine metal oxides are limited visible light absorption, unfavorable band position, low charge mobilities, and self-degradation resulting in poor conversion efficiency. To enhance the efficiency, plentiful solutions have been explored, such as heteroatom doping, intrinsic defect generation, crystal facet engineering and heterojunction formation.5–11
Vacancy engineering has widely been applied in modulating the properties of photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, photoelectrocatalysts, supercapacitors etc.6,8,9,11 With a function of shallow donor and adequate low formation energy, vacancies acts as an active site for the binding of small molecules which alters the electronic and chemical properties of the material surface. By tuning the vacancies of the pristine materials, the optoelectronic properties of the materials can be modulated. The localized electrons on the anion vacancies create serendipitous energy levels, broadening the photoresponsive range, while the surface anion vacancies with typical defect states can trap electrons or holes to inhibit their recombination. Additionally, the metal atoms surrounding the anion vacancies can proficiently capture and activate the reactants.
In particular, the introduction of vacancies in semiconducting photoelectrodes provides enormous possibilities to enhance the PEC performance. From this point of view, X. Chen et al. have prepared black hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals and observed increased light absorption, as well as enhanced photocatalysis.12 Following this, various approaches to vacancy engineering and their role in tuning the properties of semiconductors were reported.6–11 Based on the various studies, anion vacancies and metal vacancies act as shallow donors and shallow acceptors contributing to n-type and p-type conductivities, respectively.13,14 The engineering of vacancies in these materials not only improves their optical and charge transfer properties but also affects their surface properties, which are helpful in the adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface.6,8,9,11
With the above point, anion vacancies in semiconducting materials have been modulated through evolution in the growth process, ionic compensation to compensate the charge of a dopant and diffusion/gathering of pre-existing vacancies at the interfaces. Anion vacancies can be generated via heteroatom doping, post annealing under reductive gas, light irradiation and in situ synthesis.15 However, such approaches are under harsh experimental conditions, and doped elements may act as recombination centers, resulting in photocorrosion etc. In order to overcome this, we proposed a new method to create anion vacancies at the interface upon modification with carbonaceous materials, followed by annealing in an inert atmosphere.
Herein, via vacancy engineering, interfacial anionic vacancies induced by graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are demonstrated. Recently, g-C3N4 has received substantial attention for visible-light-driven photocatalysis owing to its environmental friendliness, high chemical stability, low cost, and 2D layered structures. Numerous efforts have been done on g-C3N4 as a guest material for various metal oxides like TiO2 nanotube arrays, TiO2 nanorod arrays, ZnO, WO3, α-Fe2O3, and Bi2MoO6 for PC and PEC applications. Coupling g-C3N4 with metal oxides accelerates the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and thus results in enhanced PC/PEC performance.16–20
Due to the exceptional advantages of one dimensional (1D) materials like high specific surface area and pore volume, effective photon absorption and scattering, less reflectivity, and fast and long-distance charge transport,21,22 we synthesized ZnO nanorods and used them as a sacrificial template for the formation of a ZnO@ZnSe core–shell.23–27 Together with the above-mentioned properties, interfacial selenium vacancies (SeV) are introduced upon the addition of g-C3N4 onto ZnSe semiconducting photocatalysts. As the reactive center, it decreases the CB level of ZnSe for the sequential transport of electrons among the semiconductors, thus leading to the effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers in the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 ternary junction. The PEC performance of the ternary junction annealed under different conditions is studied, and the role of the Se vacancies is corroborated.
Results and discussion
To induce anion vacancies, g-C3N4 nanosheets were loaded onto ZnSe layers, grown onto ZnO nanorod arrays. Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the sequential process of the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 ternary junction. Typically, ZnO nanowire arrays were hydrothermally grown from the seed layer on an FTO substrate as shown in Fig. 1(a). After being subjected to Se solution, ZnSe was seeded and grown onto the surface of individual ZnO nanorods by anion exchange, and then a ZnO@ZnSe heterojunction core@shell structure was formed, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The pre-synthesized g-C3N4 nanosheets were spin-coated on the heterojunction core@shell, followed by N2 flowi-heat treatment. Finally, a ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 ternary junction photoelectrode was prepared and can be seen in Fig. 1(c and d).

Fig. S1† depicts the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the successfully grown ZnO nanorod arrays on the FTO substrate. The vertically grown ZnO nanorod arrays possess smooth surfaces with a length of 1.5 μm and diameters ranging from 60–150 nm. After the ZnO nanorod arrays were immersed in an aqueous solution of Se powder and NaBH4 at 55 °C, anion exchange occurred between Se and O in ZnO at the nucleation and growth stages. The ZnO phase was converted to ZnSe via the ion-exchange process because the solubility product constant of ZnSe (Ksp = 3.6 × 10−26) is much smaller than that of ZnO (Ksp = 6.8 × 10−17).26 After the anion exchange reaction for 1 h, the microscopy images of ZnO nanorods and anion-exchanged nanorods were compared, as shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Typical top-view and cross-sectional FE-SEM images with EDS elemental analysis of ZnO@ZnSe (a) and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 (b) photoelectrodes. 
The morphology of the anion-exchanged samples looks distinct from the smooth surface of individual ZnO nanorods. The SEM images show that the surface of ZnO nanorods becomes rough after the anion exchange indicating the formation of a ZnSe shell on ZnO nanorods. The top-view and the elemental mapping images also confirm that the surfaces of initial ZnO nanorods are completely covered with ZnSe layers in Fig. 2(a). After the pre-synthesized g-C3N4 nanosheet was loaded onto the ZnO@ZnSe core@shell arrays as shown in Fig. 1(d), the existence of the g-C3N4 nanosheet is proven in Fig. 2(b). The comparison of the elemental mapping images and the EDS spectra between the binary and ternary junction electrodes is shown in Fig. S2 and S3.† It indicates that the respective elements Zn and O are mostly distributed in the core, and Se, C, and N are confined to the shell, respectively.
To prove the qualitative analysis of the ternary junction structure, the Raman spectra of 3 typical kinds of electrodes, namely, ZnO (black), ZnO@ZnSe (blue)and the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 ternary junction (red) were compared, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The prepared ZnO electrode shows a strong and dominant band at 437 cm−1 and it is well-matched with a hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO attributed to E2 modes. The peak intensity at 437 cm−1 decreased, and a new peak appeared at ∼253 cm−1 for the anion-exchanged nanorods. The new resonance peak corresponds to the first-order longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode of the ZnSe crystal. It indicates the existence of a roughened surface shown in Fig. 2(a), which is ascribed to the formation of the ZnSe shell on ZnO nanorods.23–27 It depicts the successful formation of ZnSe on ZnO and the co-existence of ZnO and ZnSe phases. Interestingly, a dominant peak was observed at around 1580 cm−1 for the g-C3N4 loaded electrode. It is the characteristic G band of graphene-based materials. The formation of the G band depicts the successful formation of g-C3N4 on the ZnO@ZnSe phases. The optical characteristics of the 3 typical kinds of electrodes were compared and can be seen in Fig. 3(b). As expected, the pristine ZnO nanorods have λmax at a wavelength below 390 nm, showing UV responsive properties. The ZnO sample displays a white colour, and after the anion exchange, it turns into a yellow colour. Upon anion exchange with Se2−, the formation of ZnO@ZnSe extends the absorption to visible light. The ZnO@ZnSe sample shows an absorption edge at around 580 nm and a weak absorption edge above 600 nm, which is predicted to be from the amorphous Se0 phase on the ZnO@ZnSe surface.27 After the loading of the g-C3N4 nanosheet on the ZnO@ZnSe core, the absorption edge showed a red shift and was estimated to be 600 nm, capturing most of the visible light from the sun to produce photogenerated charge carriers.28 The phase and crystal structure of the 3 typical kinds of electrodes were examined via XRD and are shown in Fig. S4.† The XRD diffraction patterns of the hydrothermally prepared electrode reveal a typical characteristic spectrum of the hexagonal ZnO phase (JPCDS 36-1451) with an ultrahigh spike at 34.5° corresponding to the ZnO (002) planes, indicating that the ZnO nanorods were highly c-axis oriented on the FTO substrates. After covering the ZnSe layer on ZnO, there is a peak shift of 0.4° of the ZnO (002) peak towards a higher diffraction angle. This suggests the enlargement of the ZnO lattice. Fig. 3(c) shows a peak shift of 0.4° of the FTO peak towards a higher diffraction angle, attributed to the formation of a cubic ZnSe phase at 27.2°. The ZnSe thin layer with a few nanometers was coated on the ZnO rods as shown in the SEM-EDS mapping images, and the corresponding characteristic peaks were difficult to identify in the XRD technique. After the deposition of g-C3N4 as a shell on the ZnO@ZnSe core, a similar shift was retained, and no other peaks related to other phases were observed. The characteristic diffraction peaks of ZnSe and g-C3N4 are not observed in the XRD patterns indicating that the respective materials are too small to be detected in XRD. The Raman, UV-vis and XRD results depict the presence of ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 in the ternary junction.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the ZnO, ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 electrodes shows the oxidation state of the respective elements, as shown in Fig. 4 and S5.† Fig. S5(a)† shows the full survey spectra depicting the peaks of Zn, O, C, Auger Zn LMM, O KLL and C, respectively, in all the samples. C 1s is attributed to the adventitious carbon adsorbed on the surface of the samples under ambient atmosphere (centered at 284.6 eV).25,27 Through anion exchange followed by g-C3N4 loading, the samples ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe/g-C3N4 exhibit Se and Se LMM peaks. The C and N peaks related to g-C3N4 only occur in the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 sample. Fig. S5(b)† shows the Zn 2p high resolution spectra of the ZnO, ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 samples, which can be deconvoluted into two peaks 1021.3 and 1044.4 eV ascribed to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, which are characteristic of the Zn2+ oxidation state.30 The Zn 2p peaks of ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 are relatively higher than those of ZnO, attributed to the interaction of ZnSe with ZnO and the g-C3N4 shell with the ZnO@ZnSe core.25 Additionally, the gradual decrease of the intensities of the Zn 2p core-level could result from the formation of the ZnSe shell on ZnO and the g-C3N4 sheet on the ZnO@ZnSe core.25,27
 Fig. 4  Core level XPS spectra of O (a), Se (b), C (c) and N (d) of ZnO (black), ZnO@ZnSe (blue) and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 (red) photoelectrodes. 
The O 1s spectrum was fitted into three peaks at 529.9, 531.0 and 532.2 eV ascribed to the lattice O2−, anion vacancies O− and Ochem chemisorbed oxygen of ZnO, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4(a).31,32 Interestingly, the peak at around 529.9 is absent in the ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 samples. This indicates that the minimum intensity of lattice oxygen results in the successful formation of the respective shells. The observation is consistent with the literature.27Fig. 4(b) shows the Se 3d high-resolution spectra of the ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 samples. The Se 3d peak was resolved into four peaks: the Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 peaks at 53.3 and 54.1 ascribed to ZnSe and the peaks at 55.0 and 55.5 eV ascribed to Se0 on the surface.25,27,33 The peaks at 58.4 and 59.2 eV correspond to the presence of SeO2.34 After the formation of the g-C3N4 layer on ZnO@ZnSe, there is a shift in the binding energy of Se2− towards high binding energy indicating the successful formation of g-C3N4 on ZnO@ZnSe. The formation of g-C3N4 on ZnSe leads to the formation of Se vacancies due to the coordination of Zn2+ ions with the electron cloud of g-C3N4. Thus, it is speculated that low coordination Se atoms exist in the ZnSe of the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 sample. The electron cloud density around Zn atoms in ZnO@ZnSe is lower than that in ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4, implying the existence of Se vacancies.35 This observation is in accordance with an earlier report. The formation of g-C3N4 is also confirmed by the presence of C and N elements and can be seen in Fig. 4(c and d). The C 1s peak of ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 was resolved into three peaks at 284.6, 285.8 and 288.1 eV attributed to the graphite like sp2 C–C on the surface of g-C3N4, C–O or C–N, and N–CN (N-sp2C) in the aromatic ring.25 In addition to this, the N 1s peak was resolved into two peaks, the main peak centred at 398.1 eV ascribed to –C–NC– of triazine rings and the peak centred at 398.7 eV ascribed to amino groups (C–N–H) connected with structural defects.29 The XPS analysis confirms the successful formation of ZnSe for ZnO@ZnSe, as well as ZnSe and g-C3N4 for the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 photoanode. The observations are in accordance with the SEM, Raman, UV-vis and XRD analysis results.
The photoelectrochemical behaviour of the 3 typical kinds of electrodes, namely, ZnO, ZnO@ZnSe and the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 ternary junction, were examined by measuring the photocurrent response as shown in Fig. S6† and 5(a). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of all the ZnO-mediated electrodes showed the emergence of anodic photocurrent with an increase in positive potential depicting the properties of an n-type semiconductor. Compared with pristine ZnO, both the ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 samples exhibited a significantly higher photocurrent density. The enhancement in the photocurrent is ascribed to the extended visible light absorption.36 The increase in the dark current density of the ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 samples results from the amorphous Se0 on the surface of ZnO nanorods.27Fig. 5(a) shows the chopped LSV curves of the ZnO, ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 samples during light on/off cycles which are inconsistent with Fig. S6.† At 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the ZnO photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.2 mA cm−2. After the formation of ZnSe on the surface of ZnO nanorods by anion exchange, the photocurrent density of the ZnO@ZnSe photoanode reaches 0.30 mA cm−2 owing to the enhanced visible-light absorption ability. The modified ZnO@ZnSe photoanode with the g-C3N4 shell results in an enhanced photocurrent density of 0.58 mA cm−2. Fig. 5(b) shows the chronoamperometric I–t curves of the ZnO-based photoanodes over time with light on/off cycles at 100 mW cm−2 at 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl. From Fig. 5(b), the photocurrent is almost identical during the measurement depicting the good stability of the ZnO based photoanodes. The increase in the photocurrent density is ascribed to the enhanced visible light absorption in the binary and ternary junctions.24,26 In the case of the ternary junction, the increase in the photocurrent density is ascribed to the formation of selenium vacancies at the interface, which act as active sites for the recombination of electrons of g-C3N4 and holes of ZnSe. Fig. 5(c) and (d) depict the CV data of ZnO, ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 in the dark and under illumination. As shown in Fig. 5(c), after the successive inclusion of the g-C3N4 shell on the ZnO@ZnSe core, the electroactive surface area increased, indicating the higher specific capacitance and the synergistic effect of the core and shell. After illumination, the area further increased depicting the increased capacitance.37,38 From both CV and LSV, it is suggested that the g-C3N4 shell could effectively retard the recombination of the photo-generated electrons and holes, thereby improving the photoelectrochemical activity of ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4. Thus, making it a promising photoelectrode for photoelectrochemical processes, especially in water treatment processes.

Fig. 6 shows the Se 3d high-resolution spectra of ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 in a N2 flow and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 in an air flow. The Se 3d peaks were resolved into three sets of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 peaks located at 53.3 and 54.1, 55.0 and 55.5 eV, and 58.4 and 59.2 eV ascribed to Se2− of ZnSe, Se0 for impurity Se on the surface and Se4+ for SeO2 and can be seen in Fig. 6(a). After loading g-C3N4 on ZnO@ZnSe followed by heating in an N2 atmosphere, the area of the Se impurity peak and SeO2 decreased as can be seen in Fig. 6(b). However, ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 annealed in air exhibited enhancement of the SeO2 peak and suppression of the ZnSe peak as depicted in Fig. 6(c). The presence of SeO2 could increase the activation energy which might block the active sites at the interface and restrict the path of charge carriers.39

Fig. S7† and 7(a) show the LSV curves of the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 photoanode under light on/off cycles showing good photoresponse behavior. The ternary junction photoanode annealed in an N2 atmosphere exhibited an enhanced photocurrent of 0.56 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, while the same annealed in air resulted in a poor photocurrent of 0.28 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Fig. 7(b) shows the chronoamperometric I–t curves of the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 photoanode annealed under N2 and air flowing conditions at an applied potential of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The photocurrent is almost identical throughout the measurement depicting the stability of the ZnO-based photoanodes.27
 Fig. 7  LSV (a), I–t (b), and CV curves in the dark (c) and under illumination (d) of ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 in N2 treatment (red) and in air treatment (black). 

Fig. 7(c and d) depict the CV data of ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 annealed under N2 and air conditions. The samples annealed in air exhibited similar curves in the dark and the presence of light. However, there is an increase in the area in the CV curve of the sample annealed in N2. This concludes that the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 photoanode annealed in N2 provides significant synergistic effects for the increase in the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers. The area under the CV curve enhanced under illumination indicates a higher faradic efficiency with more charge transfer.40 The enhanced photocurrent density is attributed to the existence of interfacial SeV and the minimal presence of SeO2. The diminished photocurrent density of the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 photoanode annealed in air is attributed to the poorer electron hole separation due to the existence of SeO2 at the interface. The presence of SeO2 at the interface might increase the activation energy which blocks the active site due to the minimal existence of SeV.39 In the literature, annealing a sample in an inert atmosphere could induce vacancies at the interface which is uncontrolled. Herein, the g-C3N4 shell was loaded on the ZnO@ZnSe core followed by annealing in an inert atmosphere leading to the increase in Se vacancies. The formation of Se vacancies from g-C3N4 under inert atmosphere calcination has an effect on enhancing the PEC performances compared with the samples under air conditions. The existence of SeO2 in the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 photoanode annealed under N2 and air conditions is in accordance with the Se 3d XPS spectra in Fig. 6(b and c). In addition, ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 accelerates the separation of electron–hole pairs and the transport of holes to the electrode surface for the oxidation of water. These results positively support the achievement of the highest acquired water-splitting efficiency of the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 photoanode as shown in Fig. 5. This observation is also in accordance with an earlier report.41
Based on the comparison between the ZnO based photoanodes in the crystallographic and PEC performances, a possible photogenerated electron-transfer mechanism in the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 photoanode under AM 1.5 illumination is demonstrated. Fig. 8(a) depicts the tau plots for ZnO, ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4. The ZnO photoanode exhibited a steep absorption edge at ∼385 nm depicting no response in the visible light region.42 For the ZnO@ZnSe photoanode, the absorption edge shifts towards the visible region at 585 nm.24 Significantly, the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 photoanode absorption edge further extended to ∼600 nm.28,43 The band gaps were observed to be 3.12, 2.12 and 2.06 eV for ZnO, ZnSe and g-C3N4, respectively.24,28,42,43 The research findings are consistent with the literature.43–48

The excited electrons are transported from the CB with more negative potential to the CB with less negative potential, while the holes are transmitted from the VB with more positive potential to the VB with less positive potential in the junction materials. The separation and transportation of the photo-induced carriers in the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 ternary junction are demonstrated in Fig. 8(b). Fig. 8(b) and S8† depict the relative band positions of each layer in the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 ternary junction. The photogenerated electrons from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of g-C3N4 and ZnSe migrate to ZnO as its CB has the lowest energy. Conversely, the migration of holes from ZnO to ZnSe and to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of g-C3N4 led to high charge separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. The electrons accumulated on the CB of the ZnO nanorod core can be efficiently collected by an FTO charge collector and travel to the Pt counter electrode to produce hydrogen, while the holes accumulated at the HOMO of g-C3N4 will participate in the oxygen production. With respect to the redox potential of O2/H2O (1.23 V vs. RHE), the HOMO level of g-C3N4 is at the favourable position so that the holes in the HOMO of the g-C3N4 can directly participate in the water-splitting reaction. When g-C3N4 is adsorbed on the ZnO@ZnSe core, it generates Se vacancies. The generation of the SeV results in a decrease in the CB level of ZnSe. The vacancies will be preserved or enhanced when the sample is annealed in an inert atmosphere. The SeV at the interface of ZnSe @g-C3N4 will help in the effective separation of charge carriers, which results in the enhanced PEC performance. In addition, the narrower bandgap of g-C3N4 improves the light absorption effectively.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 ternary junction photoanode was prepared by using sequential core–shell nanowire arrays. A ZnSe shell was formed onto individual ZnO nanorods by ion-exchange reaction followed by the formation of a g-C3N4 sheet layer. The well-matched electronic structures were beneficial for the separation and transmission of photo-induced charge carriers, along with the outstanding light absorption between the UV-responsive ZnO nanorod arrays and visible responsive ZnSe shell layer. The introduction of the g-C3N4 nanosheet into ZnO@ZnSe nanorod arrays induced interfacial selenium vacancies between the g-C3N4 layer and ZnSe layer. In the ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 sequential core–shell photoanode, induced anion vacancies were observed by using microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. The effects of selenium vacancies under N2-treated and air-treated conditions were compared in terms of PEC performances. The g-C3N4 functionalized photoanode annealed in N2 exhibited an improved PEC performance, while the sample annealed in air showed a declined performance. The enhanced performance is attributed to the selenium vacancies at the interface, which helps the continuous flow of charge carriers. The presence of Sev at the interface in the photoanode can promote faster separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Sequentially, it thus reduces the recombination effectively, promoting the enhanced PEC performance.

Preparation of ZnO nanorod arrays
For preparation of a ZnO seed layer on FTO, 5 mM ethanolic solution with zinc acetate dihydrate was spin-coated on cleaned FTO glass. This spin-coated FTO substrate was heated at 300 °C for 10 min, which was repeated six times, followed by the final annealing step at 450 °C for 30 min. Typically, ZnO nanorods were grown from the ZnO seed layer. 1.34 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.075 M) and 0.63 g of hexamethylenetetramine (0.075 M) were dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water separately. The solutions were stirred and sonicated until the solids were completely dissolved to form a clear solution. Then, equal volumes of both solutions were transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and the as-prepared FTO glass was immersed in this solution by placing the conductive side towards the bottom side at an angle of 45°. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 90 °C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature (RT), the obtained ZnO nanorod array films were washed with copious amounts of water and ethanol and dried by blowing nitrogen.
Formation of the ZnSe layer on the ZnO nanorods
An aqueous solution containing Se2− was first prepared by mixing 0.015 g of Se powder with 0.050 g NaBH4 in 30 mL of deionized water. The solution was stirred and sonicated until the solution became clear. The ZnO nanorod arrays were immersed in this solution and then heated at 55 °C for 1 h to fabricate the ZnO@ZnSe nanorod arrays.
Loading g-C3N4 on the ZnO@ZnSe core@shell nanorods
The synthesis of g-C3N4 nanosheets was carried out according to the literature with minor modifications. The g-C3N4 nanosheets were prepared by liquid exfoliation of the pre-synthesized g-C3N4 at 650 °C in isopropyl alcohol. 10 mg of bulk g-C3N4 was dispersed in 50 mL of isopropyl alcohol and exfoliated by consecutive ultrasonication for 10 h. The resultant dispersions were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. After centrifugation, the exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets were spin coated onto ZnO@ZnSe followed by drying with nitrogen. This procedure was repeated two times. Finally, the substrates were annealed in a tube furnace in a nitrogen atmosphere at 350 °C for 3 h to obtain a ZnO@ZnSe@g-C3N4 ternary junction. The substrates were also annealed in air at 300 °C for 3 h to obtain anion vacancy deficient samples.
Characterization
Morphology and film thickness characterization was performed using a MIRA3 TESCAN scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Rigaku Raxis Spider diffractometer employing Cu Kα radiation. UV-vis transmission spectra were obtained with a V-670 (JASCO) spectrophotometer using a blank substrate as a baseline standard. Raman analysis was performed on a JASCO spectrometer equipped with a 532 nm laser. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) surface analysis was performed using a MultiLab 2000 (THERMO VG SCIENTIFIC) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The adventitious carbon located at 284.6 eV was used to calibrate the samples. A photoelectrochemical test was carried out using a ZIVE SP1 potentiostat coupled to a solar simulator (Newport, 300 W Xe source) with an AM 1.5 G filter (Asahi HAL-320, 100 mW cm−2). For the PEC measurement, the power density of the incident light was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 using an NREL-certified reference cell (Photo Emission Tech., Inc.). In a typical experiment, a three-electrode cell composed of the prepared sample on the FTO substrate, Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl, and a Pt mesh was used as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively, in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. All of the PEC measurements were performed using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode under RT conditions.
