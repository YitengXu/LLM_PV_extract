    , Accepted 4th October 2016First published on 6th October 2016AbstractA pair of 9-arylidene-9H-fluorene and benzothiadiazole based, low-bandgap copolymers differing merely in the para or meta substitution of alkoxy groups to the arylidene linkages, i.e. p-PAFDTBT and m-PAFDTBT respectively, were comparatively investigated by using morphological characterization, ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Despite the subtle difference in the alkoxy substitution patterns, p-PAFDTBT molecules in photoactive films were shown to have a higher degree of crystallinity owing to the relatively less rotational torsion of the arylidene linkages. As a result, in either neat or fullerene-blended films, p-PAFDTBT compared to m-PAFDTBT gave rise to a substantially higher charge yield and much slower charge recombination. This work demonstrates that the alkoxy substitution pattern and the arylidene linkage are highly influencing on the morphology of the photoactive layers and thereby on the photovoltaic performance of the semiconducting copolymers.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have recently achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 10%.1–4 Morphological optimization of the BHJ layers,2,5–7 polymer structural modification,1,8–11 molecular weight modulation,12–14 device architecture or interlayer control3,4,15–18 and other research efforts have been devoted to further improve the PCE. The continuing advances in PCE largely benefit from the regulation of the electronic energetics and the morphologies of the photoactive BHJ layers. On the one hand, for energetics, the incorporation of electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) units into the conjugated backbones of semiconducting copolymers can effectively adjust the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO).19–23 A lower EHOMO may help to increase the open circuit voltage, while a higher ELUMO may promote the charge photogeneration and hence the short circuit current.24–27 In addition, the introduction of D–A structures is expected to lower the optical bandgap and hence to boost the photocurrent by extending the light harvesting spectrum of solar irradiation.21,23
On the other hand, for the microstructure, optimization of the crystallinity and morphology of the photoactive BHJ layers is known to be crucial for free charge production and transport, for which the manipulation of polymer side chains has been demonstrated to be rather effective.28–42 For instance, in the case of the poly[2,7-fluorene-alt-5,5-[4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole] copolymer, the oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains, compared to the alkyl ones, resulted in a decrease of the main chain separation from 0.44 to 0.41 nm.30 With respect to 9,9-dialkyl, the 9-alkylidene substitution of the 9H-fluorene based copolymer, poly[9-(1′-hexylheptylidene)-2,7-fluorene-alt-5,5-(4′-7′-di-2-thienyl-5′,6′-dialkoxy-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)], exhibited higher coplanarity and more densely packed main chains, which could substantially enhance the device performance.28,29 Owing to the higher packing order, photovoltaic polymers having linear octyls were shown to be superior to those with the branched 3,7-dimethyloctyl or 2-ethylhexyl.39 We have recently shown that side chains impacted both solution phase conformations and solid phase morphologies of the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) based copolymers.43–45 Regarding the issue of side-chain effects, although considerable research efforts have been directed to the photovoltaic copolymers with side substituents attached directly to their conjugated main chains,28–32,34,36–38,40,46,47 side-chain effects have not been fully understood yet, especially the linkage effect of side chains which are tethered apart to the polymer backbones on the photophysical properties.
Recently, some of the present authors have reported a pair of novel D–A copolymers with dual aryls tethered to the fluorene moiety to extend the lateral conjugation, i.e. poly[4-(5-(9-(bis(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)methylene)-7-phenyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)-7-(5-phenylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole] (p-PAFDTBT) and poly[4-(5-(9-(bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)methylene)-7-phenyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)-7-(5-phenylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole] (m-PAFDTBT).48 These PAFDTBT polymers are unique in the aryl linkage between the alkoxy side chains and the D moieties (Scheme 1). Despite the subtle discrepancy in the alkoxy substitution patterns, the p-PAFDTBT device exhibited a substantially higher PCE than the m-PAFDTBT one (6.26% vs. 2.51%).48

Herein the pair of PAFDTBT copolymers as shown in Scheme 1 provide us with a unique opportunity to explore the effects of the aryl mediated alkoxy substituents on their photovoltaic performance. In the present work, we comparatively investigated the morphologies and charge photogeneration dynamics of the pair of PAFDTBT copolymers in neat or fullerene-blended films, which are correlated with the device performance. Our results may shed light on the side-chain engineering of photovoltaic copolymers towards a higher device performance.
2. Experimental
The para- or meta-PAFDTBT copolymer was synthesized following the reported methods.48 [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (∼99%) was used as received from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). In film preparation, neat para- or meta-PAFDTBT or their blends with PC71BM (1:3, w/w, a ratio for the device fabrication48) were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) to obtain the 7 mg mL−1 solution (polymer/o-DCB). Quartz substrates were treated by ultrasonication in detergent and washed successively with deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol. The neat or blended films were spin-coated onto the substrates (neat, 600 rpm, 30 s; blend, 1000 rpm, 30 s) in an argon charged glovebox (oxygen, <0.1 ppm).
The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary-50 absorption spectrometer (Varian). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD-7000, Shimadzu) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were taken with the tapping mode in air at room temperature (Veeco, D3100). The time-resolved absorption (TA) spectrometer with a time resolution of ∼160 fs, a temporal window up to ∼2 ns, and a detection sensitivity better than 10−4 (change of the optical density, ΔOD) has been described in detail in ref. 49.
3. Results
3.1 Morphological characterization

Fig. 1a shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of the neat films. Based on the quantum chemical study on a polyfluorene copolymer Dio-PFDTBT comprising the alternating 4,7-dithiophene-2-ylbenzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole and 9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene units which has a similar structure to p-/m-PAFDTBT,50 we assume that the high energy absorption bands arise from the π–π* transition, while the low energy absorption bands are owing to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units. Besides, as shown in Fig. 1a, the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the neat p-PAFDTBT film is similar to that of the neat m-PAFDTBT film except for the region of 520–590 nm. The range of 520–590 nm stands for the 0′–0 and 1′–0 vibronic bands based on the established assignments to semiconducting polymers such as polythiophenes and other low-bandgap polymers.43,51–53 For polythiophenes, the A0′–0/A1′–0 ratio is known to correlate to both the main-chain packing forms and the inter-chain couplings. In addition, we also proved previously, by heating up the chlorobenzene or o-DCB solutions of a low-bandgap copolymer based on BDT and TT units from room temperature up to 170 °C, that the sub-bands in the 600–700 nm region are of vibronic origin.43 Therefore, in the case of the neat p-PAFDTBT film, we consider the distinct 0′–0 vibronic bands as an indication of polymer aggregation and/or backbone planarization compared to m-PAFDTBT whose absorption has no distinct vibronic bands. Similarly, the p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM and m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend films are also different from each other over the range of 470–600 nm (Fig. 1b). The relatively higher absorption of the p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend film in the range of 470–600 nm suggests that it has a high degree of polymer stacking with respect to m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM. Furthermore, it is clear that the absorption spectra of p-/m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend films follow a linear superposition of the spectra of the individual materials, i.e. the fullerene PC71BM and the copolymer PAFDTBT as shown in Fig. S1,† in spite of some small differences between blend films and the corresponding fitting results that most likely arise from the morphology of solid films. Coupled with the absence of additionally identified features, the above results indicate that no ground-state charge-transfer complex (CTC) is created between the acceptor and donor in the electronic ground-state of the blend because CTC generation at other polymer/fullerene blends was found to absorb light with a lower energy than the bandgap of both materials.54,55

To further characterize the polymer crystallinity, we recorded the XRD profiles for the neat and blend films (Fig. 2). Interestingly, no clear diffraction peak could be recognized in the (100) reflections which is due to the lamellar packing whose reflection peaks have been reported to be at 2θ = ∼5.0° for the analogous molecules,28 whereas the (010) reflections with a broad peak due to the feature of π–π stacking (2θ = ∼21°, d010 = ∼0.4 nm) are pronounced in both neat and blend films. A similar phenomenon has also been observed for PBDT-TS1 reported by Hou et al.56 PBDT-TS1 has been evidenced to have a preferable face-on orientation in the film employing grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering.57 These results indicate that most of the polymer backbones have distinct interchain π–π stacking properties, and we may speculate that the copolymers prefer a face-on orientation with reference to the substrates with a relatively weaker (100) intensity coupled with a more distinct (010) intensity.58 Despite all these films showing preferentially interchain π–π stacking, their π–π stacking distances are not alike. As seen from Fig. 2, the 2θ peaks are located at (21.43 ± 0.02)° (fwhm = 7.28°) for p-PAFDTBT, (20.76 ± 0.03)° (fwhm = 7.39°) for m-PAFDTBT, (21.44 ± 0.03)° (fwhm = 7.22°) for p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM and (20.60 ± 0.03)° (fwhm = 7.77°) for m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM. It should be noted that, in the case of p-PAFDTBT films, they have a larger value of the diffraction angle and a more pronounced and narrower peak compared to the case of m-PAFDTBT films. According to a calculation based on Bragg's law, the respective π–π spacings of 4.1 Å, 4.3 Å, 4.1 Å, and 4.3 Å were roughly revealed. Herein, we can see that both neat and blend films of p-PAFDTBT show a higher degree of crystallinity than that in the case of m-PAFDTBT. These results are consistent with the discussion about the UV-visible absorption spectra. In addition, solid films of the polymer or its blend with PC71BM are randomly distributed in space and energy. Such a distribution gives rise to the localization of charge carriers and hence a broadening of the electron density of states. In these systems, interchain charge transport, in general, takes place by hopping among the localized states.59

In addition, AFM measurement was also employed to gain more information about the morphology properties of the neat and blend films. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the mean square surface roughnesses (Rq) of the neat films are 1.92 nm and 1.01 nm for p-PAFDTBT and m-PAFDTBT respectively. Obviously, the Rq of the p-PAFDTBT film is larger than that of the m-PAFDTBT film. According to a previous report, the surface roughness has been proposed to reflect the extent of polymer self-organization, which can be promoted by thermal annealing,60,61 solvent annealing,62 and slow drying,63 or by using solvent additives.64 In addition, fullerene agglomerates protruding out of the film surfaces have also been observed to contribute to enhancing the surface roughness.65–67 In terms of neat films, there is no role of fullerene in the surface roughness, and the roughness discrepancy between the films can be only owing to the polymers, i.e. p-PAFDTBT and m-PAFDTBT. Therefore, the rougher surface in the case of p-PAFDTBT is a signature of enhanced polymer self-organization, which facilitates ordered structure formation in thin films,63 suggesting better ordered polymer chains in the films and thus a high crystallinity. This is also consistent with the result drawn from the XRD data (Fig. 2a and b). Regarding the blend films, from AFM images (Fig. 3c and d), the Rq of blend films is 0.78 nm and 1.40 nm for p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM and m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM, respectively. Additionally, the phase image of p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM shows uniform phase separation with a reasonable size, whereas that of m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM exhibits some large domains (Fig. 3e and f). In the case of blend films, fullerene agglomerates and polymer self-organization are both contributing to the roughness. It has been established that p-PAFDTBT has a relatively stronger crystallinity relative to m-PAFDTBT according to XRD and AFM data (Fig. 2a, b and 3a, b) in the case of neat films. In addition, from Fig. 2c and d, the XRD data have proved that in the case of blend films the polymer packing distance does not change in contrast to their respective case of neat films. Furthermore, the rough/smooth region in Fig. 3d most likely stands for the different phases because there is almost a one-to-one correlation between the region distributions in Fig. 3d and f. Therefore, the roughness discrepancy between PAFDTBT blend films is expected to be owing to the fullerene aggregation behavior. The isolated PC71BM nano-islands in m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blends were also revealed by TEM in ref. 48.

3.2 Primary charge dynamics of neat films

Fig. 4a and b display the TA spectra of the neat polymers under photoexcitation at 400 nm, in which the photoinduced absorption (PIA) bands centered both at ∼1300 nm and ∼900 nm at the initial delay time. At a later delay time, only the absorption bands at ∼900 nm are left. As the spectral kinetics are similar to poly(2-(5-(5,6-bis(octyloxy)-4-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-7-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-9-octyl-9H-carbazole) (HXS-1) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), the peaks are assigned to localized polarons (900 nm) and excitons (1300 nm) with reference to the literature.49,68–70 In addition, the 900 nm dynamics also involves the signals of polaron pairs (vide infra). It is seen that, with respect to the neat film of m-PAFDTBT (Fig. 4b), the broad TA spectra of p-PAFDTBT (Fig. 4a) are more biased by the charge absorption at ∼900 nm in the early temporal phase, whereas the exciton absorption at ∼1300 nm is much weaker. These phenomena indicate that more polarons in p-PAFDTBT than that in m-PAFDTBT are generated at the initial delay time. Besides, to compare the polaron yields, we have made use of [ΔOD930 nm]1.5 ns/[ΔOD930 nm + ΔOD1300 nm]0.16 ps to indicate a relative yield, for which similar extinction coefficients of exciton and polaron have been assumed, and they are 6.4% and 5.3% for p-PAFDTBT and m-PAFDTBT, respectively.
 Fig. 4  Transient absorption spectra at the indicated delay time and decay kinetics probed at 900 nm for (a, c) p-PAFDTBT and (b, d) m-PAFDTBT neat films. In (a, b), the spectral sections around 1200 nm are omitted because of laser interference. In (c, d), red solid curves were obtained by fitting the kinetics to a tri-exponential decay function associated with a long lived component. Insets show the normalized kinetics at 900 nm under different excitation photon fluences (in photons per cm2 per pulse). Excitation wavelength was 400 nm (Φex = (5.9–6.1) × 1012 photons per cm2 per pulse). 
To better understand the charge dynamics of these two neat polymers, the 900 nm dynamics for p-PAFDTBT and m-PAFDTBT was compared (Fig. 4c and d). For these two polymers, both the 900 nm dynamics are independent of the excitation photon fluence (Φex) within the margin of error (see Fig. 4c and d, insets). The Φex-independent decay behavior suggests that the dynamics at the early delay time is dominated by a monomolecular process such as geminate recombination. Therefore, it can be confirmed that the dynamics at 900 nm also has the feature of polaron pairs. Geminate (mono-molecular) recombination involves the recombination of charges that were generated from the same exciton. Therefore, geminate recombination generally exhibits exponential decay dynamics.71 The dynamics could be fitted with a sum of three-exponential functions: ΔOD(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + A3exp(−t/τ3), in which τ1 and τ2 decay lifetimes stemmed from the geminate recombination of polaron pairs, and τ3 was fixed to a long lifetime originating from the free polarons. The decay parameters are summarized in Table 1. The averaged lifetimes between τ1 and τ2 were used to represent the time constants of the geminate recombination of polaron pairs, i.e., 104 ps for p-PAFDTBT and 66 ps for m-PAFDTBT.

3.3 Primary charge dynamics of blend films

Fig. 5 illustrates the TA spectra for the blend films following the pulsed photoexcitation at 400 nm. We can see two major spectral components in common: the characteristic charge absorption peaking at ∼900 nm and the exciton absorbing at ∼1300 nm which are the same as those of neat films. However, it is noted that the excitons for these blend films are rather weak even in the primary transients (e.g. Δt = 0 ps, 0.16 ps) irrespective of the para- or meta-PAFDTBT polymers, implying the efficient dissociation of most excitons. In addition, the peak at 900 nm blue shifts from Δt = 0.16 ps to 10.0 ps as the decay time elapses for p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blends (Fig. 5a), but the prominent spectral shift is absent for the case of m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM (Fig. 5b). These spectral shift behaviors will be discussed below. After excitation at 400 nm, the exciton and polaron are generated in 20–50 fs as a result of the relaxation of the higher excited state S2.72 However, this relaxation process is so fast that our instrument could resolve it. Moreover, due to the contribution of PC71BM absorption at 400 nm, the photoexcitation at 400 nm can also create fullerene excitons besides polymer excitons, and they can also migrate towards the polymer–fullerene interface where fullerene excitons dissociate. The diffusion of fullerene excitons to the interface was previously observed in a time scale of several tens of picoseconds to hundreds of picoseconds as a rise phase in the polaron kinetics.73 Such delayed polaron formation, however, is not observed in the present cases (Fig. 6 and 7). Besides, if the slow diffusion of fullerene excitons contributes to the polaron yield, we would see a rise phase in the ground state bleaching (GSB) of the polymer. However, no such rise phase was observed. Furthermore, at the probing wavelength of 900 nm, the photoinduced fullerene species exhibit much lower extinction coefficients than those of the copolymers.74 Taken together, the polaron kinetics at 900 nm is dominated by polymer excitation and charge, although the possible influence from fullerene excitation cannot be completely ruled out. The detailed kinetic analysis of the blend films is demonstrated as follows.

 Fig. 7  TA decay kinetics for m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM probed at (a) 900 nm and (b) 575 nm under the indicated excitation photon fluences (in photons per cm2 per pulse). Solid lines up to Δt = 200 ps are fitting curves based on a tri-exponential function, and the absence of exponential fitting lines for the kinetic traces after Δt = 200 ps is due to the non-exponential decay behavior (see text for details). Excitation wavelength was 400 nm. 

3.3.1 Kinetic analysis of p-PAFDTBT:fullerene blend films. 

Fig. 6 shows the charge dynamics at 900 nm and the GSB dynamics at 570 nm under different excitation photon fluences for p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend films. The 900 nm dynamics (Fig. 6a) was fitted to a tri-exponential function: ΔOD(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + A3exp(−t/τ3). Here, τ3 was fixed to a long lifetime resulting from the free polarons because the recombination between polarons is not prominent over a Φex range from 9.3 × 1012 to 2.4 × 1013 photons per cm2 per pulse. The corresponding fitting parameters are summarized in Table 2. For the dynamics at 900 nm, τ1 and τ2 decay lifetimes are ∼1.7 ps and ∼160 ps, respectively. It is noted that τ1 and τ2 are Φex-independent for the 900 nm decay dynamics over the whole excitation photon fluences. The fast decay τ1 component is due to the blue shift of the PIA of polarons at the initial delay time. These findings indicate that the polymer polarons can migrate from amorphous domains to crystalline domains. As for the τ2 of the 900 nm decay dynamics, it is attributed to the decay of the interfacial charge transfer (CT) states because τ2 is not dependent on the excitation photon fluence as listed in Table 2. Its relatively slow decay could be associated with the dissociation into polarons of the interfacial CT states or the geminate recombination to the ground state.

In addition, the GSB decay at 570 nm (Fig. 6b) was also carefully analyzed. It can also be fitted with a tri-exponential function. However, in contrast to the decay dynamics at 900 nm, the fast decay lifetime (τ1) for the decay at 570 nm shortened (from ∼3.5 ps to ∼1.4 ps) on elevating the excitation photon fluence. Therefore, these behaviors for GSB are ascribed to the singlet exciton–exciton annihilation, which can be supported by the fastest decay component observed in the exciton dynamics (Fig. S5c†). Besides, the τ2 lifetimes (∼170 ps) are found to be independent of the excitation photon fluence and roughly consistent with that for the 900 nm decay. Therefore, the 900 nm decay with a lifetime of ∼160 ps is ascribable to the geminate recombination for interfacial CT states.


3.3.2 Kinetic analysis of m-PAFDTBT:fullerene blend films. 
The decay dynamics at 900 nm (Fig. 7a) of m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blends is different from that of p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend films (Fig. 6a). On the one hand, the dynamics has a rise phase which is in marked contrast to that of p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend films. On the other hand, the 900 nm decay dynamics from Δt = 200 ps to 2.0 ns (Fig. 7a) prominently decays as the delay time elapses, and the decay becomes faster with the excitation photon fluence increasing, indicating that non-geminate recombination is dominant for polarons on the long timescale. Non-geminate recombination refers to the recombination of fully dissociated charges and the non-geminate recombination of polarons in the presence of an energetic disorder has been reported to follow a power-law decay, but not an exponential one.75–78 So each decay at 900 nm was described by a three-exponential function just up to Δt = 200 ps: ΔOD(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + A3exp(−t/τ3). Here, τ3 was fixed to a long lifetime to represent the polarons with no decay within the first 200 ps. It is noted that the decays at 900 nm up to Δt = 200 ps can be described with a rise phase with the lifetime of ∼1.63–0.38 ps, a decay phase with the lifetime of ∼85 ps, and a long-lived phase as summarized in Table 2. The τ1 rise phase for the 900 nm decay dynamics becomes faster with the excitation photon fluence increasing (Table 2). As a result, the rise phase is attributed to the formation of free polarons which is led to by the singlet exciton–exciton annihilation as seen in Fig. S5d.† The τ2 decay phases with the lifetime of ∼85 ps, however, are found to be independent of the excitation photon fluence. Thus this decay component is attributed to the geminate recombination of interfacial CT states as in the p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blends. Similarly, the same fitting was applied to the GSB at 575 nm (Fig. 7b). The τ2 lifetime agrees roughly with that for the 900 nm decay dynamics within the margin of error. The consistency between the τ2 decay phases at 900 nm and 575 nm further verifies the geminate recombination of interfacial CT states in m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blends. Furthermore, the τ1 decay phases of the decay dynamics at 575 nm are also dependent on the excitation photon fluence, thus this recovery can be ascribed to the singlet exciton–exciton annihilation.
Now we turn to analyzing the dynamics both at 900 nm and 575 nm at a later delay time from Δt = 200 ps to 2.0 ns in detail, at which the interfacial CT states have decayed out and will not contribute to the absorption. Note that the decay dynamics at 900 nm was found to be dependent upon the excitation photon fluence, i.e., at higher photon fluences the dynamics decay faster, indicating that the decays at 900 nm at a later delay time are dominated by non-geminate recombination. For the sake of confirmation that the polarons recombine to the ground state, the GSB signals at 575 nm were also analyzed. The decay dynamics at 575 nm at a later delay time is dependent on the excitation photon fluence. This coincidence further proves that the polarons recombine in the ground state by non-geminate recombination in the nanosecond time domain.

4. Discussion
In the present work, the para and meta alkoxy substitution to the 9-arylidene-9H-fluorene unit of the PAFDTBT copolymer enable us to emphasize the influence of the substitution pattern on the microstructure and the primary charge photogeneration dynamics in neat and fullerene-blended PAFDTBT films. For neat films, short-lived polaron pairs were observed along with long-lived polarons, and the polaron yield of p-PAFDTBT is 20.8% higher than that of m-PAFDTBT (6.4% vs. 5.3%), which is connected to the relatively higher crystallinity of p-PAFDTBT as revealed by XRD and AFM data. In addition, geminate charge recombination for the p-PAFDTBT film (104 ps) is significantly slower than that for m-PAFDTBT (66 ps) (Table 1), indicating that the polymer packing order affects both charge photogeneration and geminate recombination.
Regarding blend films, both cases of p-PAFDTBT and m-PAFDTBT showed rather weak exciton absorption around ∼1300 nm even at an initial delay time. This proves that efficient charge separation occurs at the PAFDTBT-PC71BM interfaces on a timescale comparable to the time resolution. Notably, the charge dynamics at 900 nm for the m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend showed a rise phase, which is attributed to the build-up of the polaron population as a result of singlet exciton–exciton annihilation as proven by the Φex-dependence (Table 2). The fast phase in the GSB recovery kinetics was also shown to be dependent on the excitation photon fluence, further supporting the involvement of singlet exciton–exciton annihilation. The p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend, on the other hand, lacks the aforementioned rise phase, which can be explained by the efficient interfacial exciton split, in effect alleviating the singlet exciton–exciton annihilation.
Besides, it was also found that the geminate recombination of the interfacial CT states is substantially slower for p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM compared to that for m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM (∼160 ps vs. ∼85 ps, Table 2), implying a relatively higher yield of free charges in the former blend. We further estimated the polaron yields by taking the ratio of [ΔOD900 nm]500 ps/[ΔOD900 nm + ΔOD1300 nm]0.16 ps. It turns out that at Δt = 500 ps the polaron yield of p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM (53.0%) is considerably higher than that of m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM (48.7%). The 8.8% higher polaron yield of the former than that of the latter can correlate with the higher crystallinity of its blends, which can also suppress the geminate recombination. In addition, the morphologies for these two blends, as measured by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM),48 showed fine phase separation in p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM, whereas in m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM isolated PC71BM nano-islands were involved, which are coincident with our AFM characterization (Fig. 3). Such PC71BM islands may be responsible for the later phase non-geminate recombination of polarons (Δt > 200 ps) in m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM. Overall, our results strongly suggest the essential role of polymer stacking in suppressing geminate recombination and in promoting charge photogeneration in the fullerene-blended films.
To understand the differences in the π–π stacking orders between the pair of PAFDTBT copolymers in neat or blend films, we examined their ground geometries optimized by the use of ONIOM modeling in the Gaussian 09 package.79 The conjugated D–A system was treated with B3LYP density functional theory (DFT) and the 6-31G** basis set, whereas the alkyl side-chains were treated with the PM6 semi-empirical method. Scheme 1 illustrates the major dihedral angles αi (i = 1–5) and βi (i = 1–4) to be examined for the PAFDTBT copolymers. The α angles along the main chain are [−37.7°, −21.7°, −5.0°, −5.6°, −25.5°] and [−37.7°, −23.6°, −7.2°, −6.8°, −26.5°] for p-PAFDTBT and m-PAFDTBT, respectively, and the former holds a slightly higher coplanarity. The β angles aside the main chain are [−20.1°, −50.4°, −21.0°, −48.7°] and [−16.8°, −59.6°, −16.9°, −56.3°] for p-PAFDTBT and m-PAFDTBT, respectively, indicating a higher coplanarity of the former between its fluorene and arylidene moieties. The relatively larger torsional disorder of m-PAFDTBT may arouse more severe steric hindrance and, consequently, lower the π–π stacking order for this copolymer in the solid phase. In contrast, p-PAFDTBT with a higher coplanarity tends to show higher order crystallinity than m-PAFDTBT. The differences in the π–π stacking orders between the pair of PAFDTBT copolymers rationalized herein can be correlated to their distinctly different photovoltaic performances.
5. Conclusion
We have examined the primary charge photogeneration of a pair of para- and meta-substituted PAFDTBT copolymers differing merely in the positions of the solubilizing side chains. These polymers in the solid phase take an apparent ordering feature of π–π stacking irrespective of the presence or absence of PC71BM. In the form of a neat film, p-PAFDTBT compared to m-PAFDTBT is more orderly packed, and the resultant stronger interchain interaction slows down the geminate charge recombination (104 ps vs. 66 ps), an unwanted draining channel for yielding free charges. The relative charge yield for p-PAFDTBT is 20.8% higher than that for m-PAFDTBT. In the form of a PC71BM blended film, we show that the charge dynamics correlates intimately with the packing orders of the PAFDTBT copolymers. Specifically, p-PAFDTBT with a better crystallinity leads to more efficient free charge production (53.0% vs. 48.7%) and suppressed geminate charge recombination (160 ps vs. 85 ps). The stacking orders of the PAFDTBT copolymers are rationalized by quantum chemical calculations. Our results manifest that the substitution pattern of solubilizing side chains highly influences the crystallinity and morphology of photovoltaic polymers in the solid phase, a crucial issue to be considered for the development of high performance polymeric materials for PSCs.

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  Molecular structures of p-PAFDTBT and m-PAFDTBT. αi and βi represent dihedral angles, and the values were obtained by Gaussian geometrical optimization (see text for details).	 

 	Fig. 1  Normalized UV-visible absorption spectra for (a) neat p-PAFDTBT, m-PAFDTBT and PC71BM films, and (b) p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM and m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend films.	 

 	Fig. 2  X-ray diffraction patterns for (a, b) p-PAFDTBT and m-PAFDTBT neat films, and (c, d) p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM and m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend films. Diffraction peaks were fit to a Gaussian lineshape (red solid) with the indicated fitting parameters.	 

 	Fig. 3  AFM topography images of the neat films for (a) p-PAFDTBT and (b) m-PAFDTBT, and the topography and phase images of (c, e) p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM and (d, f) m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend films.	 

 	Fig. 4  Transient absorption spectra at the indicated delay time and decay kinetics probed at 900 nm for (a, c) p-PAFDTBT and (b, d) m-PAFDTBT neat films. In (a, b), the spectral sections around 1200 nm are omitted because of laser interference. In (c, d), red solid curves were obtained by fitting the kinetics to a tri-exponential decay function associated with a long lived component. Insets show the normalized kinetics at 900 nm under different excitation photon fluences (in photons per cm2 per pulse). Excitation wavelength was 400 nm (Φex = (5.9–6.1) × 1012 photons per cm2 per pulse).

 	Fig. 5  Transient absorption spectra at the indicated delay time for (a) p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM and (b) m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM blend films. The spectral sections around 1200 nm are omitted because of laser interference. Excitation wavelength was 400 nm (Φex = (9.3–12.0) × 1012 photons per cm2 per pulse).	 

 	Fig. 6  TA decay kinetics for p-PAFDTBT:PC71BM probed at (a) 900 nm and (b) 570 nm under the indicated excitation photon fluences (in photons per cm2 per pulse). Solid lines are fitting curves based on a tri-exponential function (see text for details). Excitation wavelength was 400 nm.	 

 	Fig. 7  TA decay kinetics for m-PAFDTBT:PC71BM probed at (a) 900 nm and (b) 575 nm under the indicated excitation photon fluences (in photons per cm2 per pulse). Solid lines up to Δt = 200 ps are fitting curves based on a tri-exponential function, and the absence of exponential fitting lines for the kinetic traces after Δt = 200 ps is due to the non-exponential decay behavior (see text for details). Excitation wavelength was 400 nm.
