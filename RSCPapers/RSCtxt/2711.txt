1. Introduction
Fluorescent quantum dots (QDs), as a zero dimensional nanomaterial, have attracted wide attention during the past two decades due to their unique physical and chemical properties. In comparison with traditional organic dyes and fluorescent proteins, QDs offer significant advantages such as high emission quantum yields, high photobleaching thresholds, and excellent photostability.1–3 As a consequence, QDs are frequently utilized as fluorescent probes for chemical and biological assays, fluorescent labelling reagents for bioimaging, etc.4–7 In the last two decades, there have been intensive research for the synthesis and applications of QDs. With advancements in QDs research, various types of QDs have been developed. These colloidal QDs usually comprised elements from the periodic groups II–VI, III–V or IV–VI. Table 1 lists traditional QDs with their characteristics (composition, quantum yield, emission wavelength range, applications, etc.).8–38

However, in the development of semiconductor nanocrystals, some problems and challenges also exist. For example, most traditional QDs usually contain toxic materials, such as cadmium, mercury and lead, that are harmful to biological systems and may eventually cause serious environmental problems.39 In the last decade, transition-metal-ion-doped QDs without heavy-metal ions have attracted more attention.40 For instance, Peng and co-workers designed a new nucleation-doping and growth-doping strategy to prepare Mn doped ZnSe QDs, and the fluorescence emission peak maximum of these Mn doped ZnSe QDs can be tuned from 575 nm to 595 nm.41,42 However, the low quantum yields, narrow excitation range, rapid photodegradation, complex synthesis pathway and weak transparency of biological tissue in the fluorescence emission region limit the applications of metal-ion-doped QDs. On the other hand, the fluorescence emission wavelength of most traditional QDs is usually in the visible region that would be attenuated because of the limited penetration depth of visible light through deep tissue.43 In addition, the autofluorescence of some macromolecules in living cells, such as collagen, largely overlaps in the visible region. Fortunately, there is a ‘clear window’ within the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region (650–2500 nm) in most biological tissue.44 In this window, Rayleigh scattering decreases with increasing wavelength, and major chromophores have local minima in absorption.45 So far, some NIR organic dyes, such as cyanine and Alexa fluorophores, have been utilized for labelling cells, tissues, and organ systems in vivo.46,47 However, the low fluorescence quantum yields, narrow excitation range, rapid photodegradation, and ecotoxicity limit the further applications of these NIR organic dyes.
Recently, I–III–VI type QDs, including CuInS2 QDs, CuInSe QDs, and AgInS2 QDs, have emerged. These novel semiconductor nanomaterials show several features: (I) I–III–VI type nanomaterials cover a wide range of optical and electronic properties that are related to their elementary composition and crystal structure. (II) I–III–VI type nanomaterials exhibit tunable optical band gaps covering a wide wavelength range from the NIR region, from the visible to the ultraviolet (UV) region. (III) I–III–VI type nanomaterials offer a less toxic potential alternative for replacing traditional Cd-based materials. (IV) I–III–VI type nanomaterials show unique chemical and physical properties, including larger Stokes shifts and a longer photoluminescence lifetime. All of these features may provide ways to improve performance in light-emitting devices and bioimaging techniques and certainly motivate the spectroscopic investigation of I–III–VI type QDs. In 2004, Castro et al. reported the first synthesis of colloidal ternary chalcopyrite CuInS2 (CIS) QDs via the thermal decomposition of the molecular single-source precursor (PPh3)2CuIn(SEt)4 in the presence of hexanethiol above 200 °C.48 The average size of the CuInS2 QDs can be increased from 2 to 4 nm, accompanied by a variation in the fluorescence emission peak from 662–673 nm. As shown in Fig. 1, in 2009, Peng and co-workers developed a “greener” method for the synthesis of nearly monodispersed CuInS2 semiconductor nanocrystals by adjusting the relative reactivity of the Cu precursor vs. the indium precursor in a non-coordinating solvent. The CuInS2 QDs were produced below 200 °C with an emission peak position tunable from 500 to 950 nm, and this synthetic strategy was also utilized to synthesize AgInS2 nanocrystals with similar results. This method effectively reduced the reaction temperature and was used to prepare a variety of CuInS2 QDs with different nanoparticle sizes.49 Numerous schemes for the preparation of I–III–VI type QDs were then devised in succession, including single source routes, hot injection techniques, and solvothermal techniques.

Based on recent advances, in this paper, we provide a review of the synthesis of various types of I–III–VI type QDs, and their applications in biomedical imaging, molecular recognition and solar cells.
2. The synthesis of I–III–VI type QDs
I–III–VI type QDs including a series of ternary semiconductors, such as CuInS2 and AgInS2, can be synthesized using a variety of metal salts and sulfur sources. The syntheses are usually performed in organic solvents, and some water-based synthesis methods have also been reported. An overview of the synthesis and properties of I–III–VI type QDs is provided in Table 2.

2.1 Cu–In–S ternary QDs
In 2003, Castro et al. demonstrated the conversion of the precursor (PPh3)2CuIn(SEt)4 to insoluble aggregates of nanocrystalline CuInS2;50 numerous methods for synthesizing soluble colloid CuInS2 QDs have since been reported. In most of the previous reports, colloidal CuInS2 QDs were usually synthesized in hot organic solvent containing surfactant molecules, and the CuInS2 phase could be controlled by ligand species of the metallic monomers. The thermal decomposition of multiple precursors has been used for the synthesis of Cu–In–S ternary nanocrystals.48,51–55 Vittal et al. reported the thermal decomposition of single source precursor [(Ph3P)CuIn(SC{O}Ph)4] in a mixture of 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOP), and wurtzite or sphalerite Cu–In–S nanocrystals were produced depending on the changes in growth temperature and the ratio of the capping agents.53 Dutta et al. synthesized CuInS2 nanoparticles that show a sharp fluorescence emission peak at 642 nm by the solvent thermolysis of a mixture of In(S2COEt)3 and Cu(S2COEt) at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio in ethylene glycol at 196 °C.54 Paul et al. reported the use of copper(II) thiobiuret and indium(III) thiobiuret as the single source precursor for the synthesis of copper indium disulfide nanocrystals with an invariable fluorescence emission peak around 660 nm and a maximum fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of 0.6%.55 Although the thermal decomposition process to prepare QDs at high temperature is rapid, the complex and expensive synthesis of the single source precursor and the lower QY of synthesized QDs limit the further extension of the single source precursor thermal decomposition method.
Solvothermal synthesis may be an advantageous route for the production of I–III–VI type QDs, although the resulting QDs generally exhibit a broad QD size distribution.56–64 The Li group developed a facile method to synthesize CuInS2 QDs with a nontoxic mixture of copper(I) acetate, indium acetate, and dodecanethiol in noncoordinating solvent 1-octadecene(ODE) at 240 °C.56 The synthesized CuInS2 QDs solutions exhibit absorption edges (550–750 nm) and fluorescence emission spectra (600 to 750 nm) that can be tuned by adjusting reaction parameters such as temperature and time (Fig. 2A). However, their relatively low quantum yields (<5%) became an obstacle in the expansion of their applications. ZnS shells are frequently used as a coating material to eliminate the surface defects of QDs; numerous researchers reported that ZnS shell coated Cu–In–S QDs offered enhanced fluorescence efficiency and different fluorescence wavelengths. Reiss et al. synthesized strongly fluorescent CuInS2/ZnS (CIS/ZnS) core/shell nanocrystals with copper iodide, indium acetate, zinc stearate (STE), and DDT as starting compounds in ODE solvent that exhibit photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) of 60%.57 As shown in Fig. 2B and C, in 2011, Yang and co-workers demonstrated yellow-to-red emitting CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs with a maximum photoluminescence QY of 65% synthesized via a stepwise, consecutive solvothermal route.58 After that, Yang and co-workers further optimized their synthetic steps to obtain highly fluorescent CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs that exhibit tunable emissions of yellow-orange with excellent quantum yields of 55–91%. They first synthesized a Cu–In–S core with a mixture of copper(I) iodide and indium acetate as starting compounds in DDT solvent at 180 °C, and further obtained CIS/ZnS QDs by a consecutive ZnS shell overcoating.59 In the past decade, solvothermal technology has been widely applied in the synthesis of I–III–VI QDs that offer tunable emission wavelengths and excellent quantum yields, but the hydrophobic surface of the synthesized QDs limited their further applications in biological systems.

Recently, microwave irradiation technology was introduced into the synthesis of nanoparticles, resulting in shorter reaction times, improved yields, narrower distributions of homogeneity in the overall reaction temperature, and smaller nanoparticle sizes.65–68 For instance, Gardner et al. prepared CuInS2 nanoparticles with a variety of nanoparticle diameters (3–5 nm) from single source precursors by microwave irradiation, and their fluorescence emission peaks varied from 610 nm to 656 nm.67 For further application of CuInS2 QDs in biological systems and biomedical bioimaging, it is very important to develop a simple, convenient route to directly synthesize water-soluble CuInS2 QDs. However, there are few reports on the synthesis of water-soluble CuInS2 QDs.69–71 In 2012, Su et al. synthesized water-soluble 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)-capped CuInS2 QDs that offered a fluorescence emission peak at approximately 660 nm with a QY of 3.3% via a hydrothermal approach at 150 °C.69 As shown in Fig. 3A and B, in 2013, Zhu and co-workers developed a facile route for the synthesis of CuInS2/ZnS QDs in an aqueous solution by microwave irradiation using glutathione (GSH) as a capping agent. The as-synthesized CuInS2/ZnS QDs not only possess color-tunable properties ranging from the visible to the near-infrared, but also have long PL lifetimes (690 ns) and small particle sizes. The introduction of microwave irradiation technology effectively reduced the reaction time to synthesize water-soluble CuInS2 QDs.70 In the same year, as shown in Fig. 3C–E, Pan et al. successfully synthesized water-soluble Cu–In–S/ZnS core/shell QDs with a QY of 38% and a fluorescence emission peak tunable from 543 to 625 nm; the synthesis was performed in an aqueous solution at 95 °C under open-air conditions with GSH and sodium citrate as dual stabilizing agents to balance the reactivity between the copper and indium ions.71 This water phase synthesis provided a simple and convenient route to prepare CuInS2 QDs with the potential to be directly applied in biological systems.

2.2 Other I–III–VI type QDs
In addition to the development of CuInS2 QDs, other types of QDs have emerged, including AgInS2 QDs, AgInSe2 QDs, and CuInSe2 QDs, that display some novel optoelectronic properties. Fig. 4 shows the adjustable optical band gap range covering a wide wavelength range from ultraviolet to near-infrared for various kinds of I–III–VI chalcopyrite-type semiconductors; the adjustable range was evaluated by assuming that the diameter of the QDs was between 2 and 5 nm. Therefore, the materials have significant potential as alternatives to the highly toxic CdTe, CdSe, and CdS QDs.72 As shown in Fig. 5A, by using a mixture of the trioctylphosphite complexes of CuI and InCl3, the trioctylphosphine complex of selenium (TOPSe) and a hexadecylamine surfactant, Omata et al. successfully synthesized size-controlled colloidal CuInSe2 QDs whose emission wavelengths varied from 838 to 918 nm corresponding to crystal size variations from 1.2 to 5.6 nm.73 Bawendi et al. synthesized nonstoichiometric Cu–In–Se QDs with red to near-infrared photoluminescence (PL) emissions using a bis(trimethylsilyl selenide) precursor (280–360 °C).74 Pons et al. further refined the reaction to prepare highly fluorescence emissive Cu–In–Se QDs with selenourea as the selenium precursor.75 Zhong and co-workers reported a simple, large-scale, reproducible method to synthesize CuInSe2 QDs with size-tunable photoluminescence spectra ranging from 600 to 750 nm by a reaction between Cu–In–Se–R and tri-n-butylphosphine selenium (TPBSe) at moderate temperatures (Fig. 5B).76 Compared with Cu–In–S QDs, the fluorescence emission wavelengths of the Cu–In–Se QDs mainly covered the regions from yellow light to near-infrared.

Another kind of I–III–VI type QDs, AgInS2 QDs, generally crystallize in either chalcopyrite or orthorhombic phases, whose reported energy band values are 1.87 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively.77 To obtain ternary semiconductors, researchers developed a variety of chemical fabrication techniques, such as hot-injection, thermal decomposition at high temperature, and solvothermal methods.78–84
Good quality metastable orthorhombic phase AgInS2 QDs were obtained by decomposing a single precursor [(Ph3P) 2AgIn (SCOPh)4] in a mixture of dodecanethiol and oleic acid at 125–200 °C.78 As shown in Fig. 6A, Feng et al. synthesized monodispersed AgInS2 QDs via the thermal decomposition of the precursor (AgIn)[S2CN(C2H5)2]4 in oleylamine (OA), and a phase transition from cation-disordered cubic to orthorhombic AgInS2 occurred with increased reaction temperature or elongated reaction time.79 With a better understanding of I–III–VI QDs, the PL mechanism and the nature of the related electronic states of the ternary QDs have also attracted significant interest in recent years. Hamanaka et al. reported that the phonon side bands constitute the dominant contribution to the PL spectra because of the strong electron–phonon interaction of carriers trapped by these donors or acceptors (Fig. 6B).80 A ZnS shell coating could effectively eliminate the surface defects of QDs and enhance the fluorescence QY of AgInS2 QDs. Therefore, ZnS was also introduced into the synthesis of AgInS2 QDs. As shown in Fig. 6C, Torimoto and co-workers reported a strategy to synthesize ZnS–AgInS2 (ZAIS) nanoparticles via a facile solution route, and their PL color at ambient temperature was adjustable from 720 to 540 nm by changing the fraction of ZnS in solution with QYs of up to 20%.81 Zhu et al. fabricated water-soluble, highly fluorescent AgInS2/ZnS QDs with a fluorescence emission peak of around 553 nm by a microwave-assisted method. Compared with traditional synthesis in organic solvent, the proposed method is simpler, cheaper and more biocompatible, and the PL QYs of the AgInS2/ZnS QDs can be as high as 40%.84 In addition, other I–III–VI type semiconductor materials, such as CuGaS2 and AgInSe QDs, were subsequently prepared and showed some interesting morphological and photoelectronic characteristics.85–89 Yang et al. synthesized Cu–In1−x–Gax–S QDs (x = 0–1) by a heat-up colloidal route, and upon ZnS capping, the resulting CuInGaS/ZnS core/shell QDs exhibited a tunable emission in the green-yellow (520–578 nm) spectral region, depending on the x value; the PL QYs of all core/shell QDs surprisingly exceeded 70%.87

3. The application of I–III–VI type QDs
To date, I–III–VI type QDs have been successfully applied in bioimaging and drug delivery, molecular recognition, and solar cells.
3.1 Bioimaging and drug delivery
Traditional Cd-based QDs, such as CdTe QDs, have narrow and symmetric emission peaks with broad excitation wavelengths, high quantum yields and good resistance to photobleaching, which makes them suitable for long-term bioimaging. However, potential toxicity to organisms remains a major roadblock for these QDs to be successfully translated into clinical research. Cd-free QDs, such as CuInS2 or AgInS2, have low toxicity and are extremely promising candidates offering many advantages such as stable fluorescence and high quantum efficiency. In 2009, Reiss et al. transferred the synthesized CIS/ZnS QDs to the aqueous phase via surface ligand exchange with dihydrolipoic acid. These QDs were then used as fluorescent labels for in vivo imaging; their biodistribution could be monitored by fluorescence reflectance imaging over 24 h.57 As shown in Fig. 7A, Heyes et al. linked Herceptin, a monoclonal anti-Her2 antibody, to amphiphilic poly(maleicanhydride-alt-1-octadecene) coated CuInS2/ZnS QDs, and utilized it for labeling Her2 receptors on the surface of human breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells. A primary advantage of CuInS2/ZnS QDs is their lower toxicity without sacrificing the signal:background ratio as compared to CdSe/ZnS. These tagged CuInS2/ZnS QDs improved the signal:noise ratio by an order of magnitude to separate cells with low Her2 expression from those with high autofluorescence.90 Zhang and co-workers transferred Zn doped CuInS2/ZnS (ZCIS/ZnS) QDs into the aqueous phase by a polymer coating technique and coupled them with cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide (cRGD) peptides. Cytotoxicity tests conducted on normal 3T3 cells indicated that the ZCIS/ZnS QDs were biocompatible. The viabilities of 3T3 cells incubated with ZCIS/ZnS NCs at various Cu+ ion concentrations, even at 800 nmol L−1 of Cu+ for 48 hours, were over 85%. These QDs were then injected via tail vein into nude mice bearing U87 MG tumors. As shown in Fig. 7B, the QDs signals detected in the tumor region are much more easily distinguishable in mice injected with ZCIS/ZnS-cRGD QDs than in mice injected with ZCIS/ZnS QDs.91 Achilefu et al. first assessed the cytotoxicity of QDs-loaded folate-modified N-succinyl-N′-octyl chitosan (FA-SOC) micelles using a standard MTT assay, and the results showed that the cytotoxicity of the QDs-loaded FA-SOC micelles is low due to many factors, including the use of elements with low toxicity. After that, they investigated the application of ZCIS/ZnS QDs capped with biodegradable folate-modified N-succinyl-N′-octyl chitosan (FA-SOC) micelles by in vitro and in vivo optical imaging (Fig. 7C).92 Prasad et al. encapsulated hydrophobic CuInS2/ZnS QDs with functionalized phospholipid micelles that facilitated their conjugation with folic acid for targeted delivery. They evaluated the potential cytotoxicity of the CuInS2/ZnS QDs in vitro in pancreatic cancer cells which were treated with the CuInS2/ZnS QDs for 24 h. The cells maintained greater than 80% viability even at particle concentrations as high as 195 mg mL−1, suggesting minimal cytotoxicity. They then utilized the micelle-encapsulated CuInS2/ZnS QDs for two-photon bioimaging applications with satisfactory results.93 In addition to Cu–In–S QDs that offer low toxicity and background interference in biological imaging, AgInS2 QDs also have potential in bioimaging applications. Xue et al. reported the successful silica coating of the as-synthesized Zn-doped AgInS2 (AIZS) nanoparticles via a templated coating route, and the obtained core/shell nanoparticles were further conjugated with the PEG functional group. The cytoxicity of AIZS/SiO2 nanoparticles was tested by incubating NIH/3T3 cells with different concentrations of AIZS/SiO2 nanoparticles. When the concentration of the nanoparticles reached 2 mg mL−1, cell viability remained approximately 80% after 24 h incubation. In addition, the AIZS@SiO2 nanoparticles could serve as a promising alternative to traditional cellular labeling agents. As shown in Fig. 7D, HeLa cells tagged with AIZS@SiO2 nanoparticles have clear red emission under UV excitation.82

In previous reports,57,82,90–93 I–III–VI type QDs have been proven to have negligible cytotoxicity, and recently, they were also used as effective delivery vehicles for several therapeutic biomolecules.94–98 For example, Lee et al. utilized MPA-capped AgInS2/ZnS QDs to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) (against the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene) to target brain tumor cells expressing EGFP (U87-EGFP) using polyethylene-imine (PEI) as a cationic polymer via a layer-by-layer approach (Fig. 8A). The results showed that the AgInS2/ZnS QDs were capable of efficiently translocating siRNA into the cells and achieving gene knockdown in vitro.94 Su et al. designed a daunorubicin (DNR)-loaded MUC1 aptamer-(CGA)7 conjugated CuInS2 QDs (DNR–MUC1–QDs) composite nanoparticles that could simultaneously deliver DNR to the targeted prostate cancer cells while enabling the imaging of cancer cells.95 As shown in Fig. 8B, Su and coworkers developed an anticancer drug delivery system based on the electrostatic complex of positively charged CuInS2 QDs and negatively charged poly(L-glutamic acid) (PGA) conjugated with the model anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). Multifunctional nanoparticles can deliver DOX to the targeted cancer cells and monitor the DOX release based on the fluorescence signal changes of CuInS2 QDs, which can be simultaneously used for the imaging of cancer cells.96

3.2 Biosensors
The obtained hydrophilic I–III–VI type QDs were also found to have potential as fluorescent probes for the detection of biomolecules and proteins.99–103 For instance, Kuwabata et al. transferred oleylamine capped AgInS2/ZnS QDs to a water phase by exchanging the capping ligand with MPA; the functionalized QDs could be utilized to detect glucose in combination with redox enzymes.99 Su et al. utilized MPA-capped CuInS2 QDs directly synthesized by a hydrothermal method as a fluorescence probe for the detection of thrombin based on the fluorescence quenching of the Fib–CuInS2 QDs complex by thrombin.100 Subsequently, they reported 3-aminophenyl boronic acid-functionalized CuInS2 QDs as a near-infrared fluorescence probe for the determination of dopamine based on the interaction between adjacent diols of dopamine and phenylboronic acid.101 L-cysteine capped CuInS2 QDs could also be utilized as a nanosensor for the determination of heparin and heparinise based on the interaction between amino groups on the surface of CuInS2 QDs and sulfate groups in heparin.103
3.3 Solar energy conversion
It is well-known that copper indium disulfide (CuInS2) nanoparticles have a small direct band gap of 1.5 eV that matches well with the solar spectrum, a high absorption coefficient (α = 5 × 105 cm−1) and low toxicity, which makes them prime candidates for the designing of next-generation solar cells.104–109 Chen and co-workers reported CuInS2 QDs (particle size, 3.5 nm) absorbed onto the TiO2 film that offered a photo-voltaic conversion efficiency of 0.72% with a short circuit current density of 2.02 mA cm−2 and a voltage of 0.515 V under AM 1.5 illumination.106 As described in Fig. 9A, Kamat et al. deposited CuInS2 QDs (particle size, 2.6 nm) within the mesoscopic TiO2 film using electrophoretic deposition (150 V cm−1 DC field), and the TiO2/CuInS2 films produced anodic photocurrent with a power conversion efficiency of 1.14%. By capping the TiO2/CuInS2 film with a CdS layer, the power TiO2/CuInS2/CdS conversion efficiency could be improved to 3.91%.107 Compared with thin-film solar cells, devices based on conductive polymers offer several advantages such as low cost methods and flexible substrates. In 2010, Wang et al. reported CuInS2 QDs synthesized by a solvothermal method with 4-bromothiophenol as both the reduction and capping agent, possessing an ionization potential (IP) of −5.8 eV and an electron affinity (EA) of −4.0 eV (Fig. 9B). Because of the favorable IP and EA positions with respect to poly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV), the CuInS2 QDs act as an effective electron acceptor for hybrid solar cells based on MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs blends with a wide spectral response extending from 300 to 900 nm, by allowing efficient charge separation for neutral excited states produced either on the polymer or on the QDs.108

3.4 Light-emitting diodes
During the past 20 years, semiconductor nanoparticles based on Cd, Hg or Pb chalcogenides have emerged as key components for the fabrication of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The class of I–III–VI type semiconductor nanoparticles, as less toxic and more environmentally friendly materials, has the potential to replace these heavy metal chalcogenides. I–III–VI type semiconductor nanoparticles did not show efficient electroluminescence (EL), although covering them with a ZnS or ZnSe shell has proven to be a promising route for increasing their electroluminescence for lighting applications.87,110–114 As shown in Fig. 10A, in 2012, Yang and Song prepared Cu–In–S/ZnS (CIS/ZnS) core/shell QDs that displayed quite tunable emission colors from red (623 nm), orange (598 nm), to yellow (564 nm), depending on the Cu/In ratio used for the CIS core synthesis. The yellow-emitting CIS/ZnS QDs with a Cu/In ratio of 1/4 were demonstrated for the first time to be suitable blue-to-yellow color converters for the fabrication of white QD-LEDs. The EL properties of white QD-LEDs were characterized as a function of forward current from 5 to 100 mA, showing the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates of 0.334–0.348 and 0.273–0.291, color rendering index (CRI) of 72–75, and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4447–5380 K. High luminous efficiency of 63.4 lm W−1 and light conversion efficiency of 74.7% were obtained from the white QD-LED at a forward current of 20 mA.110 Xu and co-workers reported the design and fabrication of solution-processed white LEDs containing a bilayer of heavy metal-free colloidal QDs and polymer in the device active region. White electro-luminescence was obtained in the LEDs by mixing the red emission of ZnCuInS/ZnS core/shell QDs and the blue-green emission of poly(N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine).80 After that, Xu and co-workers prepared colloidal QDs consisting of CuInS2–ZnS alloyed (ZCIS) cores and ZnSe/ZnS double shells via combining the high-temperature organic solvent method and successive ion layer adsorption technology. As shown in Fig. 10B, bright and organic-free EL emission peaks at red (λ = 623 nm, 3.3 nm diameter), yellow (λ = 594 nm, 2.7 nm diameter), and green (λ = 560 nm, 2.3 nm diameter) wavelengths were observed from the QD-LEDs comprising ZCIS/ZnSe/ZnS core/shell QDs. The brightness, onset voltages, luminance output uniformity, and efficiencies of the QD-LEDs were also characterized.112 In 2013, Zhong et al. demonstrated the integration of red emissive CuInS2 based nanocrystals as a potential red phosphor for warm light generation.113 By combining red emissive CuInS2 based nanocrystals with commercial yellow emissive YAG:Ce and green emissive Eu2+ doped silicate phosphors, they fabricated warm white light-emitting diodes with a high color rendering index of up to ∼92, high luminous efficiency of 45–60 lm W−1 and a color temperature of less than 4000 K (Fig. 10C).

4. Summary and outlook
This review focused on the developments in I–III–VI type semiconductor nanocrystals in recent years, and summarized their synthesis techniques and applications including bioimaging, biosensing, solar energy convention, and LED. Various I–III–VI type QDs have been synthesized, including CuInS2 and AgInS2 QDs, which have interesting characteristics in electricity and optics. As fluorescence probes and nano-transporters, I–III–VI type QDs have features such as low toxicity and tunable emission wavelengths ranging from the visible region to the NIR. Compared with other types of QDs, the properties of I–III–VI type QDs depend not only on the size, shape and crystallographic structure of the nanoparticles, but are also strongly affected by their elemental compositions. Further, surface modifications make I–III–VI type QDs flexible functional platforms for recognizing or bonding to various target compounds, and their low toxicity and tunable emission wavelengths offer promising applications in bioimaging, drug delivery and the preparation of photoelectric devices. However, there are still some challenges to be addressed in future work. (I) To further control the composition and luminescence yields, more efforts must be made to investigate the mechanisms involved in the synthetic processes. (II) Although the lower toxicity of I–III–VI type QDs in comparison with Cd-based or Pb-based QDs has been proven, their potential risks in clinical application should be further investigated and evaluated. (III) With excellent ability to tolerate intrinsic defect states, I–III–VI QDs are an ideal potential matrix to prepare doped magnetic semiconductor QDs such as Mn-doped CuInS2 or AgInS2 QDs, which provide the opportunity to synthesize novel doped semiconductor QDs.
