    , Accepted 22nd April 2019First published on 23rd April 2019AbstractNd3+-doped nanoparticles involving 808 nm excitation hold great promise in various biomedical applications, such as bioimaging, biodetection, theranostics and optogenetics. Here we present the synthesis and characterization of core–multishell Nd3+-doped nanoparticles displaying excellent optical properties. We systematically studied the influence of doping concentration, nanostructure design, excitation wavelength and size effect on the upconversion luminescence of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles. Remarkably, the emission intensity of optimized nanoparticles with 808 nm excitation is three times higher than the emission intensity of those with 980 nm excitation. Surprisingly, the optical profiles of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles strongly depend on the excitation wavelengths. The dominant effect responsible for the emission intensity difference and the energy transfer mechanism upon different excitation wavelengths are investigated. Interestingly, the heavily Nd3+-doped nanoparticles not only display efficient upconversion luminescence, but also are able to convert the excitation source to heat under a single 808 nm excitation source. Importantly, these efforts will lead to Nd3+-doped nanoparticles with unprecedented optical and thermal properties that will have broad utility in fundamental research and technological applications.
Introduction
The enthusiasm for research on lanthanide-doped nanoparticles is driven by their potential applications in biological and medical science, such as bioimaging, biodetection, theranostics, optogenetics, and solar cells.1–16 Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles can be typically excited by a 980 nm laser. These luminescent nanomaterials offer the unique ability to convert long wavelength excitation photons to short wavelength emissions, minimization of cellular photodamage and resistance to background fluorescence interference.17–24 Recently, Nd3+-sensitized upconversion nanoparticles that convert 808 nm excitation radiation to short wavelength emissions have attracted increasing attention due to the unique advantages associated with 808 nm excitation.25–27 Compared with 980 nm, the excitation source at 808 nm locates in the biological transparency windows around 700–900 nm, where all biomolecules display a minimum absorbance. Thus, the nanoparticles associated with excitation light at 808 nm offer deep penetration depth and minimal over-heating effect, providing the possibility of new applications and improved performance.28–31
However, Nd3+-doped upconversion nanoparticles involving 808 nm excitation typically suffer from low upconversion conversion efficiencies compared with the nanoparticles associated with 980 nm excitation, which severely hinders the broad applications of these nanoparticles. Very few researchers reported Nd3+-doped upconversion nanoparticles giving rise to brighter emission with 808 nm excitation than those with 980 nm excitation.32 Therefore, the investigation of the key factors influencing upconversion luminescence and mechanistic investigation of photo-upconversion in Nd3+-doped nanoparticles are urgently desired.
In this study, we describe the nanostructure engineering and optimization of NaGdF4-based core–multishell nanoparticles with different lanthanide doping concentrations to obtain favourable upconversion emission of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles upon 808 nm excitation. We systematically investigated the optical profiles of these nanoparticles under different excitation lights. In addition, the luminescence mechanism and energy transfer pathway in Nd3+-doped nanoparticles were carefully studied. Besides, the thermal properties of the nanoparticles upon 808 and 980 nm irradiation were studied in aqueous solution and in vivo. Together, these attributes provide new insights into the mechanistic understanding of upconversion luminescence in Nd3+-doped nanoparticles and also enable new opportunities for these nanomaterials in biological applications (Scheme 1).

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of Nd3+-doped Gd-CTmSSS nanoparticles
To realize the efficient upconversion processes, the crystal nanostructure and inherent property of host materials play important roles and thus require careful optimization. Here, hexagonal phase NaGdF4, known as being isostructural to NaYF4 and an efficient upconversion host, was chosen as the host matrix to realize intense upconversion emission upon 808 nm excitation. In order to synthesize small size core–multishell nanoparticles for their potential in bioapplications, we modified the experimental procedure based on the reported protocol, which we followed in Liu's lab.33,34 The size of core nanoparticles can be finely controlled using a mixture of oleic acid/1-octadecene and NaOH/NH4F, and the size of core nanoparticles NaGdF4:41%/1%Tm was estimated to be 13 nm using the optimized experiment procedure as shown in Fig. 1a and S1.† We then deposited three shells of NaGdF4:Yb, NaGdF4:Yb/Nd and NaGdF4 through an epitaxial growth process following our previously developed method.35 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that each layer was about 2.5 nm, and the resulting nanoparticles with three shells NaGdF4:49%Yb/1%Tm@NaGdF4:20%Yb@NaGdF4:10%Yb/50%Nd@NaGdF4 (Gd-CTmSSS) were about 27 nm, on average (Fig. 1 and 2a).

Insert: Emission intensity comparison of the nanoparticles upon 808 and 980 nm excitation in cyclohexane solutions. The emission intensities were calculated by integrating the spectral intensity of the emission spectra over a wavelength range of 300–600 nm. 
The high-resolution TEM image of the as-synthesized Gd-CTmSSS nanoparticle reveals a single crystalline structure (Fig. 2b). The lattice distance of 0.52 nm corresponds to the d spacing for the (100) plane of hexagonal NaGdF4. Compositional analysis of these nanoparticles by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of Nd3+, Gd3+, Yb3+, and Tm3+ (Fig. 2c). The hexagonal phase of the as-synthesized core–multishell nanocrystals was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, JCPDS file number 27-0699, Fig. S2†).
With the assistance of this core–multishell design, we were able to dope an amount of Nd3+ ions up to 50 mol% into the nanoparticles and obtained improved emissions from the Tm3+ emitter under excitation at 808 nm (Fig. 2d). Remarkably, under 808 nm excitation, the Gd-CTmSSS nanoparticles showed an integrated emission intensity ∼3 times of that achievable using 980 nm as the excitation source under the same nanostructure (Fig. 2d, insert). It should be noted that in previous studies, researchers seldom compared the luminescence intensity of the same nanostructure when excited at two wavelengths. In some studies, nanoparticles with 808 nm excitation only showed higher emission when compared with the nanoparticles with a different nanostructural design with 980 nm excitation.36,37
To examine the effectiveness of this core–multishell nanoparticle design for the efficient upconversion luminescence of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles, we synthesized Er3+ and Ho3+-doped core–multishell nanoparticles (Gd-CErSSS and Gd-CHoSSS). As shown in Fig. S4,† upon 808 nm excitation, the emission intensity of both Gd-CErSSS and Gd-CHoSSS was stronger than that upon 980 nm excitation. Taken together, the enhancement of Gd-CSSS emission intensity upon 808 nm excitation can be ascribed to the large absorption cross-section of Nd3+ at 808 nm (Fig. S5†), effective energy transfer between Yb3+ and Nd3+, as well as the suppression of the detrimental relaxation pathways between Nd3+ and emitting ions with the core–multishell nanostructure.25,38–45
The effect of dopant concentration and nanostructure design on upconversion luminescence
To investigate the effect of dopant concentrations of Yb3+ and Nd3+ on upconversion luminescence, we synthesized a series of NaGdF4@NaGdF4@NaGdF4 core–shell–shell nanoparticles. The second layer was doped with varying quantities of Yb3+ (10–70 mol%), while the particle core was doped with Yb/Tm (49/1 mol%) and the second shell layer had a fixed Nd3+ dopant concentration of 50 mol% (Fig. 3a). Similarly, we also synthesized another series of NaGdF4@NaGdF4@NaGdF4 core–shell–shell nanoparticles with different amounts of Nd3+ (10–70 mol%) in the second layer (Fig. 3b). From the photoluminescence results obtained from these nanoparticles, the optimal Yb3+ and Nd3+ concentrations were estimated to be 20 and 50 mol%, respectively. The emission intensity of these nanoparticles under 980 nm excitation followed the same trend (Fig. S6†).

The spectra were recorded under the excitation of an 808 nm laser at a power density of 2.0 W cm−2. (f) Schematic illustration of the roles of the core and layer of nanoparticles for upconversion emission enhancement. 
Furthermore, we found that the core–multishell nanostructural design is vital for the intense upconversion emission upon 808 nm excitation. To identify the role of each layer on enhanced upconversion emission upon excitation at 808 nm, we comparatively studied the optical intensities of the nanoparticles with controls. As shown in Fig. 3c and S7,† an outermost layer of NaGdF4 could slightly increase the emission intensity of Nd3+-doped upconversion nanoparticles, which can be attributed to the surface quenchers consuming the excitation energies of Nd3+. In addition, an energy migration layer of NaGdF4:Yb separating the Nd3+ and Tm3+ could effectively suppress the quenching interaction between these two types of ions and thus enhance the upconversion emission as shown in Fig. 3d, which is consistent with the previous report.46 Furthermore, additional 10 mol% Yb3+ doped in the second layer of NaGdF4:50%Nd can further enhance the upconversion emission under 808 nm excitation (Fig. 3e), which can be ascribed to the shorter distance between the sensitizer (Nd3+) and migrator (Yb3+) favouring energy transfer between these two types of ions. Therefore, in the as-synthesized nanoparticles, Nd3+ ions in the energy harvesting layer are used to harvest pump photons and subsequently promote a neighbouring migrator ion Yb3+ to excited states, followed by random energy hopping through Yb3+ ions in the energy migration layer and finally trapping of the migrating energy by Tm3+, Er3+ or Ho3+ ions in the emitting core (Fig. 3f). In addition, the third shell of NaGdF4 is used to suppress the energy transfer to surface ligands or solvent molecules.35,47
Comparative study of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles under excitation at different wavelengths
To comparatively investigate the optical properties of the as-synthesized upconversion nanoparticles upon 808 and 980 nm excitation, we recorded four sets of upconversion emission spectra of NaGdF4 and NaYF4-based nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 4. Gd-CTmS20%YbS10%Yb50%NdS (Gd-CTmSSS) or Y-CTmS20%YbS10%Yb50%NdS (Y-CTmSSS) showed the most intense upconversion emission under 808 nm excitation due to the effective energy transfer between Nd/Yb and energy migration in the Yb lattice (Fig. 4a and b). Interestingly, upon 980 nm excitation, the emission intensity of Gd-CTmS20%YbS50%NdS or Y-CTmS20%YbS50%NdS is stronger than that of their counterpart with 10 mol% Yb doping in the second layer (Fig. 4c and d), which can be ascribed to the deleterious cross-relaxation between Yb3+ and Nd3+. Moreover, the intensity of Gd-CTmS20%YbS50%NdS or Y-CTmS20%YbS50%NdS with a migration layer is stronger than that of Gd-CTmS50%NdS or Y-CTmS50%NdS, which can be attributed to the larger absorption cross-section of Yb3+ caused by more Yb3+ ions doped in the nanoparticles (Fig. 5a). However, under 808 nm irradiation, Nd3+ is excited selectively, Tm3+, Er3+ or Ho3+ emission in the emission spectra points to Nd3+ → Yb3+ → E3+ (E = Tm3+, Er3+ or Ho3+) energy transfer (Fig. 5b).

(c) Schematic energy level diagram illustrating the typical upconversion processes for Nd3+, Yb3+ and Tm3+. The full up, dotted, and full down arrows represent excitation, multiphonon relaxation, and emission processes, respectively. CR denotes cross relaxation. 
Furthermore, we illustrated the typical upconversion process for Nd3+, Yb3+, Tm3+, Er3+ and Ho3+ upon 808 and 980 nm excitation. As shown in Fig. S8,† under 808 nm excitation, Nd3+ ions served as the sensitizer to harvest the 808 nm photons, resulting in population of the 4F5/2 energy level of Nd3+ and then the photons quickly relaxing to the 4F3/2 energy level.24 Yb3+ ions acted as an energy migrator to bridge the energy transfer from Nd3+ to emitters (Tm3+, Er3+ and Ho3+). In contrast, upon 980 nm excitation, the excitation energy of Yb3+ in the second layer depleted via a cross relaxation (Nd3+: 4F3/2 → 4I11/2, 4I9/2; 4D3/2 → 4G5/2, 2G7/2; Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2).48 Efficient emission from Tm3+ with excitation at 980 nm can be obtained from two energy transfer pathways involving Yb3+ → Yb3+ → Tm3+ and Yb3+ → Tm3+ (Fig. 5c). Taken together, these results suggest that the luminescence mechanism of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles strongly depends on the excitation wavelength, resulting in the different emission profiles of these nanoparticles, which is different from conventional Yb3+-sensitized nanoparticles.
Investigation of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles with the NaYF4 host matrix
Among the variety of upconversion host matrices, fluorides including NaYF4 and NaGdF4 are frequently studied because of their low phonon energy and high chemical stability.49–52 Particularly, NaYF4 is generally considered to be the most efficient upconversion host due to the lower phonon energy of NaYF4 than NaGdF4 (Fig. S9†). Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of NaYF4-based upconversion nanoparticles for applications.53–57 However, due to the different upconversion luminescence mechanism for Nd3+-sensitized nanoparticles and Yb3+-sensitized nanoparticles, the optical profiles of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles should be different from conventional Yb3+-sensitized nanoparticles using NaYF4 as the host matrix.
To further investigate the optical properties of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles, we compared the optical intensity of the nanoparticles with NaYF4 (Y-CSSS) as the host material under 808 and 980 nm excitation. Unexpectedly, we observed a significantly stronger emission from the emitter (Tm3+, Er3+ and Ho3+) in NaYF4 upon 980 nm excitation (∼19, 2.7 and 3.3 times) than that with 808 nm excitation in the whole measured range (Fig. 6a–c). Based on the upconversion mechanism of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles as mentioned above, we know that the efficient energy migration between Yb3+ ions plays an pivotal role in upconversion emission. To examine the effectiveness of energy migration between Yb3+ and Yb3+ in NaGdF4 and NaYF4-based core–multishell nanoparticles, we synthesized two groups of nanoparticles with and without a migration layer using NaGdF4 and NaYF4 as host matrices. As shown in Fig. 6d, we observed a significant enhancement (∼10 times) of NaGdF4-based upconversion nanoparticles with the migration layer (Gd-CTmS20%YbS50%NdS) compared with their counterpart without the migration layer (Gd-CTmS50%NdS). However, as shown in Fig. 6e, the intensity of NaYF4-based nanoparticles with the migration layer (Y-CTmS20%YbS50%NdS) was slightly stronger (∼1.5 times) than that of their counterpart without the migration layer (Y-CTmS50%NdS). It is noted that, Yb3+–Yb3+ energy migration is dominated by exchange interaction, and for exchange interaction the distance dependence is exponential. We characterized the size of NaYF4-based core–multishell nanoparticles, and the TEM images showed that the diameters of these nanoparticles are about 60–70 nm (Fig. S10†), which is significantly larger than that of the as-synthesized Gd-CSSS nanoparticles. We then prepared a series of small-sized Tm3+, Er3+, and Ho3+-doped nanoparticles with a diameter of around 17–22 nm (Fig. S11†). Expectedly, the emission intensities of these nanoparticles under 808 nm excitation were stronger than of those under 980 nm excitation as shown in (Fig. 6f–h). Therefore, the inefficient energy migration of Yb3+ in Y-CSSS nanoparticles due to the large distance between Yb3+ and Yb3+ ions results in the low upconversion emission intensity of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles, which is in agreement with the literature.27 Taken together, differing from Yb3+-sensitized nanoparticles in that the larger size of particles and low phonon energy of the host matrix favour upconversion luminescence, Nd3+-sensitized nanoparticles need careful control of the nanostructure, dopant concentration and the size of the nanoparticles to obtain efficient energy transfer between lanthanide ions.

The thermal effect of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles
A prominent feature of this nanostructure design is that a heavily Nd3+-doped shell in the as-synthesized nanoparticles exhibits efficient light-to-heat conversion and would behave as a heating unit.58–60 To examine the thermal effect of these nanoparticles, the nanoparticles with surface ligands were washed with HCl solution to obtain ligand-free particles (Fig. S12†). These ligand-free nanoparticles were verified by the FTIR spectrum (Fig. S13†). As shown in Fig. 7a, the temperature rise in the aqueous solution of nanoparticles is significantly higher than that in water without nanoparticles during irradiation at 808 nm for 10 min (ΔT = 13.9 °C). In contrast, the temperature rise in the nanoparticle solution compared with water without nanoparticles during irradiation at 980 nm for 10 min is about 7.2 °C (Fig. 7b).

(c) Infrared thermal images of water and the corresponding nanoparticles under continuous irradiation with 808 or 980 nm laser (power density of 2.0 W cm−2) for 10 min. (d) Infrared thermal image of a nude mouse during continuous irradiation with 808 or 980 nm laser (power density of 500 mW cm−2) for 300 s. Irradiation spots are denoted with the white circle (control) and orange circle (subcutaneous injection of Gd-CTmSSS nanoparticles). 
We further examined the amount of light converted into heat using an infrared thermal imaging camera. As shown in Fig. 7c, the measured temperature increases of the aqueous solution with and without nanoparticles under irradiation at 808 and 980 nm are 8.0 °C and 3.2 °C, respectively. Subsequently, we conducted in vivo heating effect experiments to evaluate the thermal effect of the nanoparticles under 808 and 980 nm laser irradiation. To simulate photothermal therapy for tumour using nanoparticles, a circular area of 10 mm in diameter was irradiated with two different light sources (Fig. S14†). As shown in Fig. 7d, an obvious temperature rise of the circular area with nanoparticles compared with the area without nanoparticles was observed under 808 nm (∼2.8 °C), while the temperature rise is about 0.4 °C upon irradiation using a 980 nm laser for 300 s. These results suggest that highly doped Nd3+ nanoparticles with 808 nm excitation not only convert the excitation energy into electromagnetic radiation, but also convert a portion of the energy into thermal radiation. Therefore, these highly Nd3+-doped nanoparticles would act as a combined nanoplate form capable of simultaneous lighting and heating under a single excitation source 808 nm light, providing potential implications for the development of biolabels and photothermal therapy agents.
We then verified the heating effects of different excitation wavelengths under continuous irradiation with 808 and 980 nm lasers; the temperatures of water increased 3.5 °C and 27.1 °C after 10 min, respectively (Fig. 7a and b). We then examined the amount of light converted into heat using an infrared thermal imaging camera. As shown in Fig. 7c, the measured temperatures of water under irradiation at 808 and 980 nm increased 0.6 °C and 16.7 °C, which is consistent with the temperature rise measured using a digital thermometer. These results demonstrated that the heating effect of the 808 nm light source is significantly lower than the 980 nm light source, which is consistent with previous reports.61
Conclusions
In summary, we comprehensively studied the influence of doping concentration, nanostructure design, excitation wavelength, and size effect on the upconversion luminescence of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles. We show that a stronger upconversion luminescence of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles with 808 nm excitation than with 980 nm excitation is achieved by controlling the dopant concentration and nanostructure. Moreover, the different trends in the emission intensity of these nanoparticles with 808 and 980 nm excitation are caused by different energy transfer pathways. Different from conventional Yb3+-sensitized nanoparticles where particles with large size and utilization of the low phonon energy host matrix displayed strong emission, the optical properties of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles strongly rely on the rational design of the core–multishell nanostructure and efficient energy transfer between sensitizer and migrator ions. In addition to the efficient emission obtained from those nanoparticles, our results also demonstrate these highly Nd3+-doped nanoparticles are capable of converting excitation light to heat in aqueous solutions and in vivo. We believe that the understanding of the nanostructure engineering and energy transfer mechanism in these nanoparticles provides valuable information toward the rational design of Nd3+-doped luminescent nanomaterials. These efforts will lead to novel nanomaterials with outstanding optical and thermal properties that can solve many scientific and technological challenges.
