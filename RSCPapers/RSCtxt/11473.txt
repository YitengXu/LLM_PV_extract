    , Accepted 21st June 2021First published on 21st June 2021AbstractIn recent years ionic liquids have received tremendous attention from researchers and industries mainly due to their unique properties, such as low vapor pressure, low toxicity, high thermal stability and recyclability. These liquids are also recognized as sustainable liquids with great potential for a wide range of applications. This article presents a critical review of the main thermophysical properties such as viscosity, density, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, thermal stability, and melting point of ionic liquids for their potential application as heat transfer fluids. Although there are a number of studies available in the literature in this regard, far fewer are the studies that consider thermal conductivity, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that compiles an extensive number of studies and presents the main properties under the same conditions for a better comparison between the various ionic liquids available. From an engineering point of view, this article provides a critical and systematic overview of the different types of ionic liquids, and the influences of their structure and composition on the main properties that significantly impact their performances and applications. This review reveals that the structural composition and characteristics of ionic liquids make them excellent alternatives as heat transfer fluids and the knowledge of the tendency of their main properties under different conditions can facilitate not only their task-specific selection but also exploring their numerous potential applications particularly in thermal energy systems. This article is expected to provide knowledge to overcome the limitations of ionic liquid industrial applications in the very near future.Elaine FabreElaine Fabre obtained her BS degree in Chemical Engineering from the Federal University of Santa Catarina in 2015 and a PhD degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Aveiro in 2019.

1. Introduction
Ionic liquids (ILs) are defined as molten salts that are liquid at low temperatures (below 373 K). They are formed from organic cations and organic or inorganic anions, the combination of which may result in unlimited types of ionic liquids, responsible for their association as “task specific” compounds.1,2 Although the history of ionic liquids started more than hundred years ago in 1914 with the synthesis of ethylammonium nitrate [EtNH3][NO3] (with a melting point of 286–287 K), these liquids have only been more actively investigated in the past 30 years.3
For a long time, these liquids were mainly considered as solvents for catalysis and synthesis because of their large affinity with many compounds, but the true is that the ILs are much more versatile than only solvents.2 The unique properties of ILs differ remarkably from those of molecular liquids. Their low vapor pressure, non-flammability, high chemical and thermal stability, recyclability, and safe use, together with their tunable features open a very large range of areas of applications.4,5 The use of ionic liquids extends to engineering, analytics, physical chemistry, electrochemistry and biological areas.3 Some of their applications are presented in Fig. 1.

The choice of cations (nature, length, and symmetry) and anions (structure and charge delocalization) is determinant for the physical, chemical, and thermal characteristics of ILs. For instance, the melting point is associated with the different anions in the IL structure, while the thermal stability is closely related to the strength of the heteroatom-carbon (and its hydrogen bonds) in the cation.6,7 Other important transport properties are influenced by the structure of the ionic liquid. Among the many cations, the most studied are imidazolium, ammonium, phosphonium and pyridinium. However, cations like pyrrolidinium and piperidinium are also gaining attention. Their structures differ significantly as displayed in Fig. 2. While imidazolium, pyridinium, pyrrolidinium and piperidinium have cyclic chains, phosphonium and ammonium cations have open chains, which reflects in their performances and properties. Regarding electrochemical stability, ILs with cationic cyclic chains are identified as the best option.1
 Fig. 2  Structure of the different cations most commonly used for ionic liquids. 
In relation to the anion type, NTf2 (bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide) is by far the most studied and commonly used. This anion has a delocalized charge and multiple conformations slightly differing in energy. Flexible S–N–S bonds link the extremely electron-withdrawing CF3SO2− groups, and when combined with a cation it produces an ionic liquid with a low melting point and ion conductivity in the same range of the greatest organic electrolytes.1
The search for new and more efficient heat transfer fluids (HTFs) is a non-stoppable task, especially due to the continuous miniaturization and ever-increasing heat transfer (e.g., cooling) demand of many modern technological devices and systems in high-tech industries. In this sense, the right choice of the fluid is crucial for the design and performance of those devices and systems. The working fluid for heat transfer processes must possess a desirable combination of key properties such as high thermal stability, low viscosity, low corrosion, non-flammability, low toxicity, low vapor pressure, and low cost and should offer no risks of operation.8 Among all these properties, one of the most limiting for the application of HTFs is their thermal stability that determines the operational temperature range. Most of the conventional HTFs are for low-medium temperature operation and only some oils can operate at high temperatures. The global energy consumption is also considered as one very important decision-making factor in the choice of the working fluids.8 This is related to all the energy necessary in the whole process, which includes thermal and electrical energy used for the fluid pumping and heat transfer, and it is conditioned by the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the fluids.8 Additionally, to be considered acceptable the HTF must have a lifetime of around 35000–40000 hours.5,9
With that in mind, of special interest are ILs, which have acceptable thermophysical properties, and very low vapor pressure at high temperatures allowing them to be recycled almost indefinitely with negligible volatilization losses. Hence, the evaluation of the thermophysical properties of ILs is determinant to their performances as HTFs. Although many thermophysical properties are of great importance, thermal conductivity is one of the most relevant for heat transfer processes and thermal management systems. Also, despite a number of reported studies and article reviews of the physicochemical properties of ILs, only a handful of studies have considered the thermal conductivities of these liquids under limited conditions.4,10
Taking that into account, the main goal of this review article is to present and critically analyze the main thermophysical properties of ILs (with focus on thermal conductivity) and to offer supportive and systematic information towards their application as heat transfer fluids. The collection of information was made in the Web of Science Core Collection database (Jan/2021) using terms “thermal conductivity” and “ionic liquid(s)” and led to a total of 391 results. Only articles reporting experimental results were selected resulting in an expressive number of 80 articles (128 ionic liquids) that were reviewed and compiled to provide a database for the critical analysis performed. Statistical tools were applied to show similarities and correlations between properties and ILs, and to display an overview of the different types of ILs.
2. Synthesis of ionic liquids
Ionic liquids are synthesized by three main methods: metathesis, acid–base neutralization, and direct combination. The first method refers to the metathesis reaction of a halide salt such as alkylammonium, pyridinium or imidazolium with for instance, a group 1 metal or another desired anion. An example is the preparation of [Emim][BF4] by the metathesis of [Emim]I with Ag[BF4] in methanol. Because of its simplicity, this method of IL synthesis is the most widely applied one. However, special care should be taken to avoid the contamination of ionic liquids with a small number of halide ions which may react with solute materials.11–13
The reactions of acid–base neutralization may also result in the formation of ionic liquids, like in the preparation of monoalkylammonium nitrate, which results from the neutralization of an aqueous solution of amine with nitric acid, and tetraalkylammonium sulfonates that are synthesized from a mixture of sulfonic acid and tetraalkylammonium hydroxide. After the synthesis process, the ionic liquids are left under vacuum for at least 48 h to remove the excess of water and some washes with organic solvents are done to remove remained undesirable contaminants.12,13
The third method is the direct combination of a halide salt with a metal halide. Examples of ILs prepared with this method are halogenoaluminate and chlorocuprate.12,13
3. Physicochemical and thermophysical properties of ionic liquids
It is well known that the thermophysical properties of ionic liquids need to be carefully evaluated to avoid failure in the design of parameters and the performance of the devices and systems, or overcosting.14 According to the cation type, the ionic liquids of this study were divided into 4 groups, which are: imidazolium-based (1), ammonium-based (2), phosphonium-based (3) and other-based (pyridinium, pyrrolydium, piperidinium, etc.) (4). The main physicochemical and thermophysical properties of these 4 groups of ionic liquids compiled from the articles reviewed are categorically presented in Tables 1–4.

3.1. Viscosity
The determination of the viscosity of ILs is essential for their applications. Indeed, this crucial property is directly related to the power spent in fluid pumping, pressure drop and convective heat transfer rate.15,16 Generally, the length of the cation chain and the size of IL molecules are the main factors influencing viscosity.7
Viscosity analysis and its dependency on temperature and the shear rate provide useful information about the ionic interactions in ILs. The shear stress significantly impacts the rheology of fluids. For instance, at low shear rates ammonium-based ILs have a Newtonian behavior, but at high shear rates they present a shear thinning pseudoplastic behavior. Such a fact is explained by the strong electrostatic forces that are attracting the ions and by the hydrogen bonds between them, resulting in the segregation of the nonpolar alkyl chain.17 Likewise, temperature strongly impacts viscosity, i.e., higher temperatures reduce the aggregation of the molecules by improving the ion mobility and consequently reduce the shear thinning and viscosity.7 Additionally, as viscosity is influenced by the interaction between the molecules due to increase in temperature, the intensity of H bonding decreases, and consequently viscosity reduces.18 The viscosity of ionic liquids is generally compared as the viscosity of the oils, but it can vary largely with temperature enhancement. An increase in temperature of only 5 K results in a decrease in viscosity of up to 20%.7,19 This is particularly good for the application of ILs under flowing and elevated temperature conditions.
Okoturo and VanderNoot reported the effect of the cation chain structure on the viscosity changes of several room temperature ILs.19 They observed that viscosity was lower in small and symmetric cations with a low molecular weight and also it was lower in cations with a higher molecular weight but with shorter alkyl substituents. Tokuda et al. investigated the influence of the cation chain on the viscosity of ILs.20 They observed that viscosity follows the tendency of the IL cation size: the larger the cation, the higher the viscosity.
In addition, it is found that the anion type decreases viscosity in the following order: [PF6] > [SbF6] > [BF4] > [CF3SO3] > [NTf2].19 The anion influence is attributed to the symmetry and charge distribution. If the interactions between the anion and the surrounded ions are facilitated by the IL configuration or charge distribution, the viscosity increases. For that reason, larger anions such as [NTf2] present lower viscosities.19Fig. 3 displays the viscosity variation of different ionic liquids with the same cation type with temperature. The results presented agree with the aforementioned and in fact, the ionic liquid with the anion [PF6] has high viscosity, while the one with imide has low viscosity. Moreover, the enormous effect of temperature on viscosity can also be observed in Fig. 3, in which the viscosity of the ILs varies between 80 and 92% for the temperature rise from 293 to 343 K.

Fig. 4 presents the viscosity versus temperature plot of different ILs with the same anion in common. The phosphonium-based IL showed the highest viscosity while the imidazolium-based IL presented the lowest. It is interesting to notice that at high temperatures all ILs seem to present the same low viscosity, which is comparable to that of commercial heat transfer fluids.21 That represents a great advantage for their application, since the operational cost of ILs, which is normally a limiting factor, reduces significantly with viscosity reduction. Oster et al.21 reported that ionic liquid costs can drop drastically with temperature increases of 100 K, attaining values similar to that of Therminol VLT, Dowtherm MX or Dowtherm A.

Tables 1–4 present more complete information of the viscosities of the ILs of the four groups considered, at room temperature. For the ILs with melting points above room temperature, viscosity is presented at the temperature mentioned in the footnotes. As temperature profoundly influences this property, the data collected and presented in these tables allow us to have a better overview of the different viscosities under the same basis of comparison, which usually is not available in most of the published review articles.
3.2. Density
Another parameter very important to establish the flow conditions of heat transfer fluids is density. Tables 1–4 also present the data of the density of the four groups of ILs at room temperature. In general, phosphonium-based ILs have densities lower than water, while the ILs with cations of pyridinium, pyrrolidinium and sulfonium are denser, usually with densities higher than 1.3 g cm−3. The cation size influences the density in the way that larger cations have lower density. Besides that, the density decreases as the number of alkyl substituents increases.4
Regarding the temperature effect, it slightly influences the density of ILs: when temperature rises 50 K the density reduces only about 2–3 %.4,28Fig. 5 shows the behavior of different ILs at various temperatures. An increase in temperature promotes a linear decrease of density, which agrees with the results reported by Tokuda et al.20 Moreover, comparing ionic liquids with the same cation ([C4mim]), densities follow the anion order: [NTf2] > [PF6] > [TFO][C1SO4] > [C(CN)3].

3.3. Specific heat capacity
The determination of the specific heat capacity (Cp) of fluids, defined as the thermal energy needed to increase the temperature of one unit of mass by one degree,31 is crucial to calculate the operational parameters in various heat transfer processes.32
The specific heat capacity of ILs and INCs is mostly measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),33–37 and modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC),38–43 which is an extension of DSC that adds a new dimension to the conventional approach. In DSC, samples and a standard are heated at a fixed rate (with linear temperature changes) and the heat flow across the sample and standard is measured as a function of temperature. Sapphire is the standard most commonly used.44,45 Meanwhile in MDSC, the same heat-flux DSC cell apparatus is used, but a different temperature (heating/cooling) profile is applied to the sample and standard. In this case, the temperature change is a sinusoidal ripple, which results in better measurement results (less noise) and consumes a less experimental time, when compared to DSC.46
The specific heat capacities of most of the ILs at room temperature are in the range of 1.200 to 1.900 J g−1 K−1.4 Globally, it has a linear dependency on temperature and increases as the temperature rises.4,31 The chemical and physical features of ILs influence their specific heat capacity. For instance, a larger cation size and larger number of substituents result in higher values of this property. However, the effect of the anion type is even more significant than the cation, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. With the exception of [P4,4,4,1][NTf2], the ILs with the same [NTf2] anion exhibited more similar Cp than the ones with different anions and same cation. The specific heat capacity (per mass unit) of the [C4mim] cation followed the descending order: [Dca]>[BF4]>[PF6]>[TFO]>[NTf2]. Resembling results were presented in the work of Chernikova et al.4 who also observed the linear influence of temperature.

3.4. Thermal conductivity
Thermal conductivity is a key property to evaluate the thermal performance of ILs as heat transfer fluids. The cooling/heating efficiency and energy spent/transferred in the process highly depend on the thermal conductivity of the fluids. From Tables 1–4, it can be observed that at room temperature ionic liquids possess thermal conductivities in the range of 0.11–0.30 W m−1 K−1. However, the thermal conductivity data vary from author to author mainly due to employing different measurement methods or conditions by different researcher groups. The reported scattered results may also come from the different degrees of purity or water content in the studied ILs. The most commonly used measurement technique is the transient hot wire method, whereas the less frequently used ones are the parallel plate method and the hot disk, among others.4 The transient hot wire method (single wire) is based on the use of a single-needle probe that works as a heater and temperature sensor. The thermal probe is inserted vertically in solution in order to minimize convection and the measurement is made by heating the probe into the sample and monitoring its temperature change. Because ionic liquids are electrical conductors, the heating probe needs to be electrically insulated.51,52 This method is well-established and documented in the literature and thus is not elaborated further.51,52 However, the disparities and uncertainties in the measurements of thermal conductivities of liquids, particularly ILs and INCs, among different researchers are mainly due to using commercial devices which not only give relatively high uncertainty (due to probe size which should be very thin (in tens of micrometers) and sufficiently long) but also are very challenging to operate properly.
Regarding the ionic liquid structure, it has been reported that the cation type and size have lower influence on thermal conductivity than the anion nature.4 Indeed, Musiał et al.29 observed only a slight increase in thermal conductivity with increasing the cation chain, while Tomida et al. noticed a negligible effect in the 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate series or a slightly decrease in the thermal conductivity of the 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate series with the increase in the cation chain.53 Ge et al. reported the thermal conductivity of 11 different ILs and investigated the effect of the cation size and type on this property.54 They observed that the variation of the cation chain size had no significant effect on the thermal conductivity. However, the modification of the cation type had a more noticeable impact when they compared imidazolium and phosphonium ILs with the same anion.54

Fig. 7 shows the box plot of the thermal conductivity of the four groups of ILs at room temperature that are considered in this review. The groups cover ILs with different cation sizes and anion structures, but they have in common the same cation nature. Fig. 6 demonstrates that the ILs of groups 1–3 have very similar median values of thermal conductivity, and the ILs with ammonium and imidazolium cations show a very large variation of the data. This means that they can exhibit much higher or much lower thermal conductivities by varying the anion type, since the effect of the cation size has been proven to be not relevant.54 Other authors also reported the significant influence of the anion on the thermal conductivity of ILs.4,5,54 The group composed mainly of pyridinium and pyrrolidinium cations (group 4) showed the distribution of thermal conductivity values concentrated in the lowest region. Furthermore, groups 3 and 4 presented very small data variation, which might indicate that the influence of the anion type within these groups is less impactful than it is for groups 1 and 2. Besides that, the box plots in Fig. 7 also allow making some interesting conclusions such as: for the ammonium group the variation of the data is the largest, and more than 50% of the ionic liquids in this group have a thermal conductivity higher than 0.17 W m−1 K−1, being more than 25% of them above 0.21 W m−1 K−1. Therefore, one can conclude that with respect to thermal conductivity, ammonium and imidazolium are the groups in which the changes of composition permit more improvement in thermal conductivity.
 Fig. 7  Box plot of the thermal conductivity of the different cation types of ILs at room temperature. 

Fig. 8 displays the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of several ILs having the same [C4mim] cation. From this Fig. 8, it is possible to evaluate the behavior of the different ILs at various temperatures and the importance of the anion type on the thermal conductivity. As can be seen in most of the cases, thermal conductivity decreased with increasing temperature. Furthermore, the impact of temperature changes varied in the ILs, being more significant in the following order: [C4mim][BF4]>[C4mim][C1SO4]>[C4mim][Dca]>[C4mim][SCN]>[C4mim][C(CN)3]>[C4mim][SbF6]>[C4mim][TFO]>[C4mim][NTf2]>[C4mim][PF6]. The effect of temperature was reported as linear by Ge et al.,54 and it corresponds to the behavior of many ILs presented in Fig. 8, although some of them showed variations that differ from linearity. Moreover, remarkable dependency on the anion nature is clear, with thermal conductivity values of 0.177 W m−1 K−1 for [C4mim][C1SO4] and 0.128 W m−1 K−1 for [C4mim][NTf2] at 283 K.
 Fig. 8  Thermal conductivity at various temperatures for different ILs containing the same cation: [C4mim][TFO],55 [C4mim][NTf2],39 [C4mim][SCN],52 [C4mim][PF6],56 [C4mim][C(CN)3],52 [C4mim][Dca],57 [C4mim][BF4],58 [C4mim][SbF6],55 and [C4mim][C1SO4].55 All the studies used the THW method for the measurement of TC, with the exception of [C4mim][PF6].56 
Due to the complexity of thermal conductivity of ILs, many factors such fluid viscosity, flow velocity, fluid composition, etc. may influence this property. Taking that into consideration, the thermal performance of HTFs needs to be evaluated from a wider perspective. Fig. 9a and b present the relationship between the viscosity and thermal conductivity of ILs belonging to the previously mentioned 4 groups, at room temperature. Group 1 containing imidazolium-based ionic liquids has the largest variation of thermal conductivity and all fall in the low viscosity region. Ammonium-based ILs (group 2) have the highest viscosities and intermediate values of thermal conductivities. The phosphonium group (group 3) also has its thermal conductivities concentrated in the middle region, while group 4 is in the region of the lowest viscosities and thermal conductivities. Despite the absence of a clear relationship between the two variables, it is easy to see that high thermal conductivities are achieved by the ILs with lower viscosities and there is some similarity of the results within the groups.
 Fig. 9  Viscosity versus thermal conductivity of the four groups of different IL cations: normal scale (a) and zoom (b). 
With the aim to achieve a more clear and deeper understanding and establishing a relationship between the four groups classified in this work, a discriminating analysis was also carried out. The analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26 software, and only the studies that contained the information of viscosity and thermal conductivity at room temperature were accounted, summing in total 71 points. The variables of molecular weight, viscosity and thermal conductivity of ILs were considered for the analysis and the outcomes are presented in Fig. 10. The results are plotted in terms of function 1 and function 2, which were both dependent (on different scales) on the 3 variables considered. Function 1 is more representative and explain 80% of the results, while function 2 describes 16%, and together they are responsible for correlating 96% of the data.
 Fig. 10  Discriminant analysis of the four groups of different IL cations. 
The outcomes obtained are quite interesting; the cations with a cyclic chain like imidazolium (group 1) and pyridinium, pyrrolidinium and piperidinium (group 4) have very close performance and centroids, while ammonium (group 2) or phosphonium (group 3), groups without a cyclic chain have more distant centroids and more variations within the group. Moreover, the phosphonium group represents the ILs more peculiar of the four groups, presenting a larger distance between its centroid and the other group centroids.
In general, the viscosity of ILs is essentially determined by the tendency of the ILs to form hydrogen bonds and by the strength of van der Waals interactions between their ions. In this context, lower side chains, more mobile chains and low molecular weights provide lower viscosities.6,59 Phosphonium-based and ammonium-based ILs have very strong hydrogen bonds and phosphonium has a much higher molecular weight than the others. Those features distinguish these two groups from the other ones and explain the distances perceived. Ferreira et al. investigated different phosphonium-based ILs and reported that thermal conductivity decreased linearly with the increase in the molecular weight.49 They explained that it is ascribed to the reduction of the vibration/translation effect involved in the complex interactions of the ions.49
From the point of view of engineering applications, Fig. 9 and 10 give valuable insights to help in the decision making, providing an overview of the general properties of each group, similarities and disparities between them, and the potential to improve their thermal properties. Additionally, by knowing the main behavior of each group it is simpler to choose the most suitable IL for a specific operation, task or application.
3.5. Thermal stability
The thermal stability of ILs is assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and it is generally characterized by the decomposition onset temperature (Ton), which is described as a temperature point at which advanced decomposition can be observed.21
The nature of the cation and anion of ILs is associated with their thermal stability.60,61 ILs containing cations like pyrrolidinium and imidazolium possess the highest thermal stabilities, while pyridinium and ammonium-based ILs are the least thermally stable.4 In fact, Table 1 confirms that the onset temperatures of imidazolium-based ionic liquids range from 499 K (for [C2mim][AcO]) to 732 K (for [C4mim][NTf2]). The thermal stability of ammonium-based ILs as reported in Table 2 is between 423 K (for [N4,4,4,4][IO3]) and 505 K (for [N4,4,4,4][SCN]). On the other hand, the thermal stability of phosphonium-based ILs (in Table 3) is between 464 K (for [P4,4,4,4][Cys]) and 649 K (for [P4,4,4,4][Tau]), while pyrrolidinium- and pyridinium-based ILs (Table 4) have onset temperatures of around 776 K (for [C4mpyrr][NTf2]) and 576 K (for[C1pyr][C1SO4]). Regarding the anion type, thermal stability decreases in the following order: [(C2F5SO2)2N]>[NTf2]>[TFO]>[PF6]>[BF4]>[(CN)2N]>Cl.4,62
In terms of applicability in heat transfer processes, the thermal stability of ILs is very important once it limits the maximum temperature of operation.60,61 The thermal stabilities of the most commonly used commercial heat transfer fluids are lower than or similar to the ILs stability as may cite: Dynalene PG-60 (450 K), Downterm J (588 K), Therminol VLT (448 K), Therminol LT (453 K) and Dynalene calcium chloride series (373 K).21
3.6. Melting point
The property that is most important to characterize ILs is, without question, the melting point. The structure and chemical composition of ILs are closely linked to their melting points. Cations with low symmetry, well distributed charges and weak intermolecular forces are mainly responsible for decreasing the melting point of ILs.6 In addition, the depression of cation symmetry has been recognized to have a greater effect to reduce the melting point.3 For example, the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation has only one methyl substituent and therefore larger asymmetry than the 1-butylpyridinium cation, with C2x symmetry. The former melts at temperatures up to 100 K below that of the latter.3 Indeed, the symmetry effect on the melting point is confirmed by the higher melting point of the symmetric tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate63 of 364 K (as can be seen from Table 2) compared to the asymmetric 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate,38 with a much lower melting point of 187 K (presented in Table 1). To complete, McFarlane et al. reported that ammonium, pyrrolidinium and phosphonium cations were solid when the substituents presented a symmetric configuration whilst when they had asymmetric radicals the melting point was lower than room temperature.64
The influence of the anion on the IL melting point is also acknowledged. The larger the anion size the lower the melting point tends to be.6 In contrast, anions with hydrogen bonds in the lattice lead to ILs with higher melting points.3
4. Potential and challenges of IL application as heat transfer fluids
As this work presented, the chemical, physical and thermal properties of ionic liquids are extremely conditioned by the cation and anion nature. Among the infinite options of both, ILs can be tailored to have properties more suitable for any desired application. In general, the effect of the cation type is less impactful over all the properties than the anion type. Without doubt, the greatest benefit of using ILs as heat transfer fluids lies in their high thermal stability, since the conventional fluids currently applied degrade at temperatures above 500–520 K, while with properly chosen chemical composition, ILs can operate at temperatures substantially higher, over 700 K.4 Besides that, the negligible vapor pressure allows a much safer application, with no toxicity or respiratory risks for the employees, and no flammability. Furthermore, ILs can be recycled almost infinite times, which significantly reduces their costs making them more economically attractive.
One of the points to take into consideration with the use of ILs is the corrosion risk of the surfaces that will be in contact with them. As well as for the other properties, the corrosive action may be adapted by changing the cation or anion in the IL structure. Anyway, the most suitable surfaces with regard to corrosion are aluminum, steel and grass, while copper, nickel and iron should be avoided.4
Thermal conductivity plays an important role in the choice of the HTF. When compared with the conventional ones, ILs have higher thermal conductivities than organic-based HTFs, such as Therminol ADX10 or Dynalene SF.21 Unfortunately, the viscosity of ILs is much higher, which implies higher operational costs of the heat exchange system.21 However, the viscosity of ILs reduces up to 1000% when temperature increases 100 K, which results in a significant drop in the costs, equaling them to the costs of the most commonly used HTFs, in which viscosity or costs do not largely vary with temperature increments. Additionally, heat exchange systems operate at high temperatures, which is favorable for the use of ILs as HTFs.
The costs of an IL itself is also a drawback for its application. Although much development in manufacturing has been made lately, the prices are still high, mainly due to the costs of the reagents or the difficulty in the large scale synthesis of ILs.4,21 During the synthesis process of ILs, the major costs lie in the source of the anion, which is usually a fluorine with organic or inorganic salts that will be exchanged afterwards. The most studied anion, [NTf2], is the most expensive one as well, while [PF6] or [BF4] are the cheapest ones.
Furthermore, it is interesting to note some differences concerning ionic liquids and molten salts. Although ionic liquids are defined as a special group of molten salts, some authors separate the concept of ionic liquids from molten salts by their melting point, where the former melt at temperatures below 373 K (usually lower than room temperature), while molten salts melt at very high temperatures (for instance, the melting point of NaCl is 1074 K).38 In addition, they may be distinguished by their structure, the classical molten salts being composed by inorganic ions while ionic liquids are normally formed from large organic cations associated with inorganic or organic anions.18,38 The structure of ILs is much more complex, possessing in many cases cations with side chains with delocalized charges, which favor their very low melting points.65 Therefore, classical molten salts and ionic liquids mainly differ by the asymmetry of molecules of ionic liquids, which in consequence of the interactions of their ions prevent charge ordering and avoid crystallization.66 Moreover, the hydrogen bonds present on the IL structure induce the entropic effect by the formation of a pre-organized structure. On the other hand, in the classical molten salts the Coulomb interactions favor the clustering by the charges ordering.66
Despite their considerable limitations, classical molten salts have already been applied in thermal energy areas, for example, in concentrated solar power plants as heat transfer fluids and for thermal energy storage.67 Molten salts like nitrate/nitrite are commercially more commonly used, but chloride salts have attracted attention due to their greater thermal stability and lower prices compared with nitrate/nitrite. Because of their very high melting points, the application of molten salts is restricted to high-temperature processes, while ionic liquids can operate over a much larger interval of temperatures. In addition, the serious corrosion of the surfaces in contact with them is associated with their application, much higher than the one caused by ionic liquids.68
In summary, the potential of ILs to be used as heat transfer fluids is enormous compared with the conventional heat transfer fluids or even other classical molten salts, having a wide scope of possibilities for their applications. However, the future of ILs is highly dependent on the advances in the synthesis processes that will gradually reduce the costs associated with their acquisition and application. It should be highlighted that recyclability, thermal stability and safe operation are extremely valuable features to consider when selecting a HTF, which will make, in the near future, ILs the most suitable choices.
5. Conclusions
The constant development of technology and the miniaturization of modern electronic devices and systems led to a search for more efficient and stable HTFs. In this context, ionic liquids appear as promising alternatives, and the evaluation and understanding of their thermophysical properties are essential to guarantee their high performance in heat transfer processes. This work reviewed a remarkable number of articles and presented a critical analysis of the impact of the chemical composition of ILs and temperature on their thermophysical properties. Moreover, most of the data are displayed under the same temperature conditions to offer a reliable comparison between different ILs and give to the readers a wider view of the best choice for specific operational conditions and tasks. With this work, we expect to have provided valuable insights that will help in the selection of the most appropriated ILs and to highlight their enormous potential in the heat transfer field.
Regarding the application of ILs, the main conclusions that can be derived from this work are:
• The chemical and structural compositions of ILs are determinant to their thermophysical properties and therefore they should be carefully evaluated. In general, the impact of the anion type on these properties is more pronounced than the cation type.
• Among the several types of ionic liquids, the ones belonging to the groups classified according to the cation type present quite similar behavior and a selection of an ionic liquid from one of these groups gives insights into the expected behavior.
• From the analysis of the variation of thermal conductivity, imidazolium- and ammonium-based ILs are the IL types that allow obtaining higher thermal conductivities by managing the anion choice. However, if the intention is to use liquids with a very low variation in thermal conductivities, almost independent of the anion nature, phosphonium, pyridinium and pyrrolidinium may be good options.
• Phosphonium-based ILs are a more peculiar group and have the properties more distant from the other groups of ILs.
Overall, the characteristics of ionic liquids make them excellent alternatives as HTFs, and the knowledge of the tendency of their main properties under different conditions is a powerful tool to support their future use in the thermal applications of high-tech industries.
