    , Accepted 15th October 2020First published on 26th October 2020AbstractSynchrotron based grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence (GIXRF) spectrometry is usually applied to obtain shallow depth distributions (less than 25 nm) using information from the X-ray standing wave (XSW). In this paper a new XSW-free mathematical model is proposed that allows the quantitative derivation of much deeper depth distributions. The model was validated with three test Si(111) wafers deeply implanted with 200 keV argon ions of nominal doses of 1015 to 1016 at. per cm2. Ar ion retained doses determined with our XSW-free GIXRF model agreed well with nominal quantities, additionally cross-checked by ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques. Deduced depth profiles of Ar ions are critically discussed in comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation of Ar ion transport in amorphous silicon. The developed model provides a robust quantification GIXRF methodology to study deeply implanted dopants in semiconductors, expanding the applicability of GIXRF spectrometry in new fields with emerging technological interest.
Introduction
For the last fifty years ion implantation has uninterruptedly remained a strongly attractive technological process widely applied in traditional and modern branches of industry. Applications of deep and shallow ion implantation range from electronics, through advanced optics, to metallurgy and biomaterials. Regardless of the industrial domain where ion implantation is used, this technique allows manufacturers, designers and scientists to customize flexibly the properties of substrate materials at a near surface level, i.e. from below 1 nm up to more than 100 nm, by using appropriate ion dopants. In such a way, many different properties, e.g. structural, mechanical, electrical, magnetic, electrochemical, optical in metals as well as in polymers and in inorganic materials, e.g. oxides, and in their interfaces can be adjusted.1,2 The primary applications of ion implantation technologies are modern semiconductor devices where ultra-shallow junctions, currently with a thickness of less than 20 nm, can be easily created by bombarding a Si matrix with low energy, less than 15 keV, B or As ions.3,4 Another well-known use of ion implantation is the modification of stainless-steel surfaces with N ions in order to improve hardness and wear resistance.5 In the orthopaedic implant industry, Ti-based alloys doped with C or N ions are key materials for knee and hip prostheses.6,7
This really broad and many-sided application of ion implanted materials continuously generates an insatiable need for accurate quantification protocols. It is of constant interest to determine the depth distribution profile of dopant ions in the substrate as well as the total retained dose. Klockenkämper et al.8 showed that this might not be always an easy and straightforward task. In this work, the authors applied in total seven different approaches, two theoretical models via Monte Carlo simulations and five experimental probes including X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), sputtered neutrals mass spectrometry (SNMS), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), grazing-incidence X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (GIXRF), and total-reflection XRF (TXRF) combined with wet-chemical etching, in order to reconstruct the depth distribution profile of 100 keV Co ions implanted with a nominal dose of 1017 at. per cm2 in the test Si wafer. This benchmarking of depth profiling methodology was concluded with a strongly alarming statement: among these five experimental methods (without reference materials well fitted for correct dose calibrations for XPS and SNMS) there was a discrepancy in the determination of Co ion retained doses as large as a factor of three! This inconsistency in ion retained doses clearly explains ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy of quantification procedures and constantly motivates the further optimization of analytical probes used in laboratories worldwide. Almost two decades have passed since Klockenkämper et al. have published their benchmarking and, despite the fact that the quantification is still a matter of active concern, nowadays the ion implantation is a very mature technology that behaves very well quantitatively. In particular, as shown by Colaux et al.9 RBS can determine the ion implantation fluence with a global uncertainty of 1%. In their recent comprehensive review paper, Jeynes and Colaux10 summarized extensively all the ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques that are well suited for the thin film depth profiling.
Within the range of X-ray techniques, GIXRF spectrometry is a highly sensitive method to probe the element composition of flat wafers up to a depth no greater than a few micrometers below the surface.11,12 This method offers a sub-nm spatial resolution. The probing depth strongly depends on three contributors: the energy of the monochromatic X-ray beam that impacts the wafer, the incidence angle of the beam relative to the wafer surface and, finally, the wafer matrix. What is truly important, the GIXRF probe in contrast to secondary ion mass spectrometry13 (SIMS) is not destructive and does not lose a quantifiable signal over a transient distance of ≈15 nm below the surface while wafers are penetrated in depth. In order to record the angle-dependent intensity profile of characteristic X-ray lines of doping elements, the wafer is rotated from 0° (where it stays parallel to the incoming X-ray beam) up to an angle greater than at least twice the critical angle for total external reflection. Due to the interference between the incoming and reflected X-ray beams, there is an X-ray standing wave (XSW) field created in the region very near, above and just below the reflecting wafer surface. The modulation of this XSW field significantly influences the intensity of X-ray fluorescence radiation emitted by dopants and matrix elements. If GIXRF experiments are transferred from X-ray tube based table-top spectrometers14–17 to the instrumentation operating at synchrotron beamlines,18–21 the sensitivity of this method increases drastically. Peak resolution in GIXRF spectra is substantially improved if energy-dispersive detectors are replaced by wavelength-dispersive detection systems.22 Some instruments are completely calibrated,18,23 therefore reference-free quantification24via a direct conversion (without any standard reference materials) from XRF intensities into absolute element mass depositions is possible. In the past two decades the GIXRF method found its practical application in the investigation of the ultra-shallow implantation of B, Al, P, As, In and Sb ions in Si and Ge matrices25–29 and to explore surface contaminants.30 Literature studies also show the application of GIXRF methodology for the analysis of complex multi-layer systems,19,31,32 including modern magnetoresistance materials,22 organic multi-layers and nanolaminates,28 and organic light emitting diodes.33 The GIXRF technique was employed for the investigation of thin film Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells, where in-depth element distributions present smooth concentration gradients34 or multi-layer structures with sharply defined interfaces between subsequent layers.35 GIXRF was used to evaluate the element composition and construction parameters (e.g. linear sizes, tilt angles, mass densities) of Cr nano-pillars36 and lamellar Si3N4 gratings37 embedded in Si substrates.
Although the acquisition of angle-dependent GIXRF profiles is usually a trivial task, the post-experimental data evaluation almost always presents some challenges. This happens because the determination of element depth distributions by existing GIXRF quantification models25,38–40 is an ill-conditioned inverse problem. As it was clearly demonstrated by Ingerle et al.,27 GIXRF spectrometry does not possess a strong enough potential to deliver the unambiguous solution for the ion depth concentration. In the quoted paper, the authors considered two different, hypothetical depth distributions of As ions in a Si matrix (by their intention, one of the two was non-physical) and these two As distributions resulted in identical angle-dependent profiles of As-Kα and Si-Kα lines. This ambiguity hampers severely the process of quantification. For this reason, a new, additional input is firmly required to be incorporated into GIXRF models in order to reduce the degrees of freedom and, subsequently, to eliminate non-realistic scenarios. An efficient remedy to overcome the problem of ambiguity in the quantitative analysis, is to support the GIXRF methodology by other complementary techniques, either theoretical or experimental.
Among all well-established experimental probes capable of depth profiling three of them are very supportive to GIXRF. The first method is X-ray reflectometry41 (XRR) which is experimentally quite often applied in parallel with GIXRF. Simultaneous GIXRF-XRR scans with a joint quantification are widely reported in the literature.19,22,27,28,33 In order to facilitate the combined GIXRF-XRR data analysis and to simulate angle-resolved experiments three software packages were developed: CATGIXRF42,43 written in Fortran 77, JGIXA44 implemented in Java, and GIMPy45 programmed in Python. In addition to the inter-layer interface roughness, XRR predicts well the layer density and thickness. This is because XRR, in contrast to GIXRF, is very sensitive to variations in the local density of electrons. The synergistic GIXRF-XRR approach in the quantification process reduces the interdependence between the element quantity and the layer thickness. Hence, these two distinct parameters do not compensate each other and might be determined with improved accuracies.
The second experimental probe that can supplement GIXRF in depth profiling, is the SIMS technique. Although SIMS fails in the transient region located very close to the wafer surface due to inherent limitations, it delivers reliable depth distributions of elements if probed from deeper depths. Because of the latter advantage, the element depth distribution pre-determined by SIMS,46 can be subsequently fine-tuned by the GIXRF modelling. The synergy in GIXRF-SIMS methods was demonstrated by Ingerle et al.14 and by Pepponi et al.47 In both papers the authors quantified the retained doses and depth distributions of As implants abundant in Si matrices with nominal doses of 1014 to 1015 at. per cm2.
The third experimental method supportive for the GIXRF depth analysis is RBS.48,49 The applicability of RBS itself towards the depth profiling determination was demonstrated by Jeynes and Kimber50 who with a maximum likelihood method determined moments of the implantation profile of 60–400 keV As implants of a nominal dose of 1014 to 1016 at. per cm2 in Si. Although at that time, 35 years ago, these authors operated with a low-resolution instrumentation, they succeeded with an extraordinarily high precision: the As range and the straggling were determined with a standard uncertainty of ≈1 nm. Recently, the synergy in GIXRF-RBS techniques was shown by Unterumsberger et al.51 who quantified the Ga-K and Ga-L3 subshell photoionization cross sections employing a Si wafer reference target implanted by 40 keV Ga with a nominal dose of 5 × 1015 at. per cm2. In that target, the Ga quantity was determined by RBS at 1.3% traceable accuracy. In general, RBS remains a powerful analytical method if the kinematical gap between the implanted species and the matrix is sufficiently high. While RBS is well suited for the investigation of Ga and As implants in Si, its usefulness is limited for other important light element dopants, e.g. B or P in Si. Despite this inherent limitation of RBS, Kokkoris et al.52 managed to accurately determine 200 keV Ar ion depth profiles implanted in Si substrates with a nominal dose of 1016 at. per cm2. In this work, because of the relatively small nuclear interaction cross sections, the determination of Ar retained dose resulted in a uncertainty as high as 7%.
Theoretical modelling with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations is a very helpful alternative if any auxiliary input to complete the GIXRF model cannot be determined experimentally. Among MC codes, the SRIM software53,54 is recognized as a robust tool to model interactions between accelerated particles and matter. In particular, ion implantation processes can be readily modelled with SRIM, hence, the depth distribution of ions implanted into a substrate material can be known a priori or, at least, be well approximated. In the quantification process, the SRIM-based initial guess of element depth distribution is iteratively optimized in such a way as to make the calculated angle-dependent GIXRF profile match the experimental one. The combined GIXRF-SRIM approach was used to characterize ultra-shallow distributions of B, Al and As ions implanted in Si matrices.25,26,47
Though the determination of the XSW field intensity is mandatory for accurate GIXRF data analysis and modelling, it might raise some difficulties.37 In our paper, we attempt to bypass this limitation. If Si wafers are illuminated by a monochromatic X-ray beam, the distribution of the XSW field generated in the near surface region depends only on the grazing incidence angle. If the grazing angle is sufficiently above the critical angle for total external X-ray reflection, the XSW field practically disappears. This vanishing can be observed in Fig. 1, where the XSW field inside a Si(111) wafer deeply implanted with 200 keV Ar ions was simulated by the IMD software.55 A strong XSW field, much beyond unity, forms inside the wafer up to a depth of 250 Å below its surface only if the grazing incidence angle is less than 1.5°. The basic goal of this paper was to take advantage of the XSW field extinction in order to construct a novel XSW-free GIXRF model for element quantification following the classical ideas and fundamental equations of XRF spectrometry. Next, Si wafers with deeply implanted Ar ions were used as test targets to validate the robustness of the proposed GIXRF quantification model. Finally, the results were also cross-checked by means of IBA methods and are critically discussed with respect to the simulated depth profiles by SRIM.

Ar ions depth distribution simulated by SRIM as a Gaussian was included. The rainbow colour scale shows a unitless local relative XSW field intensity created by 4 keV X-rays. 
Mathematical model for XSW-free GIXRF spectrometry
In this section a new and original mathematical model describing the XSW-free GIXRF spectrometry is briefly derived. Forthcoming equations express the intensity of Ar-Kα and Si-Kα spectral lines probed from Si substrates deeply implanted with highly energetic Ar ions. This model covers only the primary X-ray fluorescence radiation induced within the wafers solely by the incident X-ray beam. Any higher order phenomena, e.g. secondary X-ray fluorescence due to cascade inter-element enhancement effects or X-ray fluorescence generated by scattered X-rays, were not taken into account. In order to keep this model simple neither the oxidation of wafer surface nor any other imperfections (e.g. (inter-)layer roughness or diffuseness) were considered. The model takes the assumption of a parallel beam approximation; hence no divergence of incident X-ray beam was included. Our XSW-free GIXRF model that we are presenting in this paper is a novel and original development grounded on the conceptual formalism by de Boer56 and by Klockenkämper with von Bohlen.57 A SRIM-simulated Ar ion depth distribution was incorporated in the model.
The GIXRF model geometry is sketched in Fig. 2. There is a Cartesian coordinate system with its origin at (0,0) where the depth concentration of Ar ions, δ(x), is plotted with a red line against the depth x below the wafer surface. In this sketch, the wafer starts at the point (0,0) and spans horizontally along the negative direction of δ axis, while its thickness extends along x axis in its positive direction. The incoming X-ray beam (depicted with a sky-blue line) impinges into the wafer at a grazing angle ϑ, while fluorescent X-rays generated in the wafer (marked with a green line) are collected by the X-ray detector positioned perpendicularly to the incoming X-ray beam. This makes the exit angle equal to 90° − ϑ relative to the wafer surface.
 Fig. 2  Geometric layout of XSW-free GIXRF model. A Si wafer is composed as the stack of sub-layers where the mass deposition of Ar ions conforms a Gaussian. 
According to the SRIM simulation by Kokkoris et al.,52 a 200 keV Ar ion implantation in Si substrates creates a unimodal depth distribution characterized by four numbers: mean depth 2080 Å, deviation 610 Å, skewness −0.24, and kurtosis 2.73. Because of the specific values of the last two parameters, the Ar ion depth distribution in Si substrates, δ(x), can be well approximated with a Gaussian function: (1)where the three parameters A, c and w are the amplitude, centroid and the width of this distribution, respectively, all expressed in units of length.
Mathematically, the Si substrate layer can be divided into an infinite number of infinitely thin sub-layers, each of a thickness dx, as marked in Fig. 2. The model assumes a constant mass density across the wafer that equals the mass density of pure Si, ρ = 2.33 g cm−3. In other words, Ar ions implanted in the Si wafer do not influence its mass density. Hence, Ar and Si areal mass depositions in the considered sub-layer, dmAr and dmSi, expressed in g cm−2 are given by eqn (2) and (3), respectively: dmAr = ρδ(x)dx(2) dmSi = ρ[1 − δ(x)]dx(3)
Both the above mass depositions contribute to the atomic Kα spectral line intensity, dIi with i = Ar and Si, according to eqn (4): (4)where I0 is the intensity of X-ray impinging beam on the wafer surface, σi is the cross section for the production of Kα line of the i-th element, while εi stands for the detection efficiency of that line. Ω ≡ Ω(ϑ) is the detection solid angle dependent on the ϑ angle. Two other terms μSi,0 and μSi,i are the total mass X-ray attenuation coefficients in the Si matrix at the energies of the incident X-rays and of the Kα line of i-th element, respectively. The first exponential term in eqn (4) expresses the transmission of impinging X-ray beam through the Si matrix until it arrives at the given sub-layer. The second exponential term in eqn (4) describes the transmission of the Kα line of i-th element as it emerges from the sub-layer and is attenuated by the Si matrix on its way towards the X-ray detector.
In the further derivation, for the purpose of simplification and brevity in mathematics, two new terms are introduced. The first one is a geometrical factor G ≡ G(ϑ) dependent on the irradiation geometry58 given with eqn (5): (5)while the second term, μi, is an effective X-ray attenuation coefficient of the Kα line of i-th element given in eqn (6): (6)
One has to notice that the coefficient μi as defined in eqn (6) takes into account the effective attenuation of X-rays in the wafer matrix considered as pure Si. The contribution of implanted Ar ions into the effective attenuation term μi has been neglected.
The intensity of Ar-Kα and Si-Kα spectral lines probed from the complete Si wafer thickness requires the integration of eqn (4) from zero to infinity as Si wafers are considered infinitely thick. Altogether, this integration results in two equations, eqn (7) and (8) written in a very compact form as follows: IAr = I0GσArρεArBAr(7) (8)where a new variable Bi is defined in eqn (9) below: (9)
In order to quantify the Ar ion retained dose in units of atoms per cm2, NAr, eqn (2) requires the integration from zero to infinity and this integral results in eqn (10): (10)where MAr ≈ 40 u is the Ar atomic mass and NA is the Avogadro constant. The combined uncertainty of Ar ion retained dose, ΔNAr, is evaluated by eqn (11a) and (b): (11a) (11b)where contributions Dj are due to uncertainties Δj with j = A, c and w as they were already defined in eqn (1).
Experimental section
Three test Si wafers with gradually decreasing Ar implantation doses from Ar-high to Ar-medium to Ar-low, with a nominal Ar ion deposition of 1 × 1016, 5 × 1015 and 1 × 1015 at. per cm2, respectively, all with an implantation energy of 200 keV, were fabricated at the Vinča Institute of Nuclear Science, Laboratory of Physics in Belgrade, Serbia. A detailed preparation procedure was described by Kokkoris et al.52
A GIXRF spectrometry experiment was conducted at the X-ray fluorescence beamline installed at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste, Italy. The storage ring was operated with an electron energy of 2 GeV, producing an electron beam current of 310 mA. With the use of a double Si(111) crystal monochromator with a resolving power of 1.4 × 10−4, the white beam generated by a bending magnet was monochromatized to 4 keV, while higher order harmonics were efficiently eliminated by the pair of carbon coated parallel plane mirrors. Exit slits tailor the X-ray beam size at the sample position to 100 μm × 200 μm (v × h), illuminating the wafers with a beam flux of 2.2 × 109 photons per s. A sample environment was the IAEAXspe instrument,21 an advanced multi-purpose X-ray spectrometry beamline end-station made available for the user community by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEAXspe device is controlled by a LabVIEW graphical user interface.59 Wafers were kept at high vacuum with a pressure of 10−7 mbar. A seven-axis goniometer allowed us to perfectly align the wafers relative to the incoming X-ray beam and to perform angle-dependent scans. XRF spectra were recorded with a Si drift detector with a Si crystal thickness of 450 μm, an effective crystal area of 25 mm2 and an energy resolution of 131 eV at Mn-Kα line, operating with a shaping time of 6.1 μs. A super-light-element window was installed in front of the detector crystal. The XRF detector was also equipped with a photoelectron trap aperture with a diameter of 2.25 mm, placed 5 mm away from the wafer surface, in order to optimize the GIXRF geometry (namely to minimize the geometrical dependence of the recorded X-ray fluorescence intensity) and to prevent the deterioration of signal due to electrons. The intensity of X-ray beam reflected from the wafer surface was recorded with a Si photodiode covered by a 200 μm vertical slit aperture.
After precise alignment, each wafer was scanned over an angular range from 0° to 10° with a constant step of 0.02°, probing 501 points. The counting time was 10 s, 15 s and 30 s for Ar-high, Ar-medium and Ar-low wafers, respectively, adjusted in such a way to yield a statistical error in the integrated net Ar-Kα peak area of less than 2% while maintaining a detector dead time of less than 12.9% at the highest count rate. Additionally, a pure Si wafer (without any implantations) was scanned with a counting time of 5 s per step in identical experimental conditions in order to determine the geometrical factor G(ϑ).
Results
According to this experimental procedure all Si wafers were scanned and XRF spectra were collected. Three exemplary XRF spectra recorded at a grazing angle of 5° and normalized to the Si-Kα peak are shown in Fig. 3. Such a normalization, only for the purpose of display, corrects for different acquisition times of each spectrum and any minor instabilities possible in X-ray beam intensity illuminating the three wafers. Unsurprisingly, the sequence of Ar-Kα peaks follows the implantation doses of Ar. XRF spectra were fitted by AXIL software60 to subtract their backgrounds and to determine the net peak areas. Angle-dependent count rate profiles of Ar-Kα and Si-Kα spectral lines are drawn in Fig. 4. As one can notice, below the critical angle only the Si-Kα peak was detectable, while the Ar-Kα peak appeared once the grazing angle of incident X-ray beam passed over the critical angle.

 Fig. 4  Experimental GIXRF intensity profiles of Ar-Kα lines probed from three Si wafers (linear scale, left). The profile of the Si-Kα line probed from the Ar-high wafer is plotted in a log10 scale (right). The dashed vertical line at 0.444° indicates the theoretical critical angle at 4 keV. This line intersects the Si-Kα GIXRF profile almost at its inflection point. 
Because the critical angle for total external X-ray reflection, αc (in deg.), depends on the mass density of the reflector, ρe (in g cm−3), and the energy of X-ray beam being reflected, E (in keV), eqn (12) can verify experimentally any possible deviations in the Si wafer mass density due to the Ar implantation process. ρe = 0.736E2αc2(12)
The critical angle for each Si wafer was determined as the inflection point of Si-Kα GIXRF curve and then converted to a corresponding mass density. This evaluation is summarized in Table 1. The relative uncertainty of all estimated quantities did not exceed 3.1%. Since experimentally determined critical angles and mass densities of all four Si wafers differ from the tabulated quantities, 0.444° at 4 keV and 2.33 g cm−3, respectively, by no more than 2.4%, using only the GIXRF method we did not find any influence of the Ar ion deep implantation on reflecting or structural properties of the investigated Si wafers. However, this statement holds only up to a depth of 153 Å below the wafer surface that is the penetration depth57 of 4 keV X-rays in Si.

The basic conceptual idea of the XSW-free GIXRF quantification model comes from a specific distribution of the XSW field created below the wafer surface. For the Si wafers considered, with 200 keV Ar ion deep implantation, as shown in Fig. 1, an intense XSW field extends up to a depth of 250 Å below the wafer surface, being created upon the X-ray illumination below a grazing angle of 1.5°. Above this angle, the electric component of the incident X-ray wave decays monotonically only due to the X-ray attenuation in the wafer matrix. This means, that there is no need to include any XSW field for the Ar ion quantification in Si wafers if the analysis covers the grazing range from 2° (considered as an extra safety margin beyond 1.5°) up to 10°. In order to quantify the total retained Ar dose and its depth distribution, experimental ratios of Ar-Kα to Si-Kα net peak intensities, shown in Fig. 5, were fitted with a theoretical model function f as defined in eqn (13) by using IAr and ISi as given in eqn (7) and (8), respectively. (13)
 Fig. 5  Experimental ratios (coloured dots) of Ar-Kα to Si-Kα net line intensities were fitted (black continuous lines) in the angular range from 2° to 10° with the analytical function deduced from the XSW-free GIXRF model. 
An independent variable in the function f is the grazing angle ϑ, while the three other terms A, c and w, all already defined in eqn (1), are free parameters of Ar ion depth distributions to be optimized in the fitting procedure. A χ2 minimization with the global minimum search was realized in MATLAB. For each Ar-implanted wafer, parameters of Ar ions depth distribution, A, c and w, were reported in Table 2. Relative uncertainties of A and c did not exceed 3.3% while w was estimated with uncertainties of ≈30%. Centroids of Ar ion depth distributions, c, determined with the XSW-free GIXRF model were deeper by at least 308 Å than the so-called projected range simulated by the SRIM software at a depth of 2080 Å.52 This small drift accompanied by a broadening effect can be well observed in Fig. 6, where three Ar ion depth distributions estimated with the χ2 procedure are illustrated together with the theoretical distribution obtained from the SRIM simulation.

 Fig. 6  Depth distributions of Ar ions deep implantation in Ar-high, Ar-medium and Ar-low wafers determined with the XSW-free GIXRF quantification model and simulated by SRIM software (normalized to the Ar-high distribution). 
The quantification using the ratio of experimental net Ar-Kα to Si-Kα line intensities viaeqn (13) eliminates two very critical instrumental contributions, namely the incident X-ray beam intensity I0 and the geometrical factor dependence with the incident angle G(ϑ), which might introduce significant uncertainties. This can be observed in Table 3 which itemizes the uncertainty budget of quantities employed in the χ2 minimization process and subsequently for the determination of Ar retained doses. The X-ray beam flux I0 remains accurately determined with the calibrated Si photodiode.21,61 In contrast, the geometrical factor G(ϑ) determined experimentally with the Si blank wafer following two ref. 25 and 46 might be strongly erroneous. In order to discuss the uncertainties of G(ϑ), the range of incident angles ϑ scanned in the GIXRF experiment can be split in two: below and above the critical angle for the total external X-ray reflection. At very shallow incidence angles the uncertainty of G is large, at more than 16%. At this angular region the uncertainty of G is heavily dominated by the relatively poor Si-Kα counting statistics. Above the critical angle, where the Si-Kα count rate is always much higher, the uncertainty of G remains mostly influenced by the inaccuracies in fundamental parameters μSi,0, μSi,Si and σSi. Consequently, the uncertainty of factor G reduces to slightly more than 1.9%. Readers should also notice that no uncertainty in the XSW field induced below the surface of the Si blank wafer is propagated to the factor G. An alternative semi-theoretical method58 to calculate the factor G has also been proposed. In the present quantification procedure, the only required instrumental contributor is the detector efficiency εi. Based on the data provided by the detector manufacturer, Bruker Nano GmbH, the uncertainty of detection efficiency εi was estimated to be 0.14%. All fundamental parameters were taken from the xraylib62,63 database. The relative uncertainty of fundamental parameters was considered as the maximum inconsistency between the parameters accessible in xraylib versus the average of three corresponding parameters available in xraylib, Mucal64 and XCOM65 atomic data libraries. The statistical variability of the four kinds of contributors, namely, Ar-Kα and Si-Kα counting statistics, detector efficiency and fundamental parameters, within the ranges of their relative uncertainties as specified in Table 3, rows from #1 to #4, respectively, was taken into account for the determination of the three values A, c and w (and their uncertainties) reported in Table 2.

Once A, c and w have been determined, the Ar ion retained doses were calculated for each Si wafer viaeqn (10). This evaluation was reported in Table 4. Ar retained doses were determined with relative combined uncertainties of less than 3.6%, while the difference vs. nominal doses was not greater than 13.9%. Additionally, the Ar-high wafer was investigated with EBS/RBS (Elastic/Rutherford Backscattering) at N. C. S. R. “Demokritos” in Athens, Greece. Based on the EBS/RBS method, Ar was abundant in the Ar-high wafer with a retained dose of 8.50 × 1015 at. per cm2, that differs from the estimation by our XSW-free GIXRF model by only 1.3%. Such an ideal agreement in Ar retained doses determined with two different experimental methodologies not only proves the validity of the XSW-free GIXRF model for the quantification of deep ion implantation, but also highlights its enhanced and superior sensitivity for smaller retained doses (e.g. those of Ar-medium and Ar-low wafers that were not detectable by EBS/RBS within a reasonable time of data acquisition). With respect to the uncertainty budget in Table 3, rows #7, #8, and #9, one can note that most errors in the determination of Ar retained doses with the XSW-free GIXRF model are due to the amplitude A and the width w of depth distributions while the centroid c remains a very minor influence.

It is also of interest to check if the XSW-free GIXRF model reproduces correctly the shape of experimental GIXRF angular profiles of X-ray spectral lines. Fig. 7 displays the GIXRF curve of the Ar-Kα line intensity probed from the Ar-high wafer that was compared to the prediction of the XSW-free GIXRF model viaeqn (7). In order to derive the theoretical function IAr(ϑ) one has to know two instrumental constituents: a beam flux intensity I0 and the geometrical factor G(ϑ). The beam flux intensity was measured with the calibrated Si photodiode regularly between the measurement of the different wafers.61 As already mentioned, the angular dependence G(ϑ) was determined from the Si blank wafer following ref. 25 and 46. One can observe that the theoretically estimated profile IAr(ϑ) matches very well the experimental Ar-Kα angular profile if the grazing incidence angle stays above 1° whereas below this angle there is a discrepancy. This mismatch between the experimental and theoretical GIXRF curves below 1° is due to the strong influence of the XSW field on the acquired intensities of XRF radiation at a very sub-surface depth, which, due to the goal of this paper, has not been included in the model. This artefact apparent in the angular range from 0° up to 1° clearly shows the inherent limitation of our XSW-free GIXRF theory. The proposed model is not applicable when the XSW field is required to be included in data evaluation, namely, in the GIXRF data analysis of ultra-shallow implants.

Discussion
Along with the quantification model that we developed in this paper, the applicability of GIXRF spectrometry has been fairly extended. The GIXRF method, which works very well around the critical angle for the total external X-ray reflection to analyse a near-surface region, has now been set-up for the examination of much deeper depths where the XSW field is not present. Although this model is a basic and ideal approximation of real and complex ion implanted systems, it provides the robust quantitative characterisation of ion depth distribution profiles with the uncertainty budget held at a modest level.
The XSW-free GIXRF model was validated by means of Ar ions deeply implanted in Si wafers with a nominal dose of 1015 to 1016 at. per cm2. By employing this model, Ar ion retained doses were determined with a relative combined uncertainty of less than 3.6%. This uncertainty looks impressively good if compared to a corresponding uncertainty in RBS analysis, that was 7% for the most heavily implanted wafer, 1016 Ar at. per cm2. Because the combined uncertainty is a factor of two better in favour of GIXRF, this experimental probe can be seriously considered as a powerful and accurate replacement for the analysis of those implants for which RBS falls out of use.
For the dose determination by the XSW-free GIXRF model an additional uncertainty due to the geometrical factor G as high as at least 1.96% was avoided. This is rendered possible because the quantification model relies on the experimental ratio of Ar-Kα to Si-Kα net line intensities and consequently, as one can note in eqn (13), the geometrical factor G disappears. Generally speaking, the correct determination of G(ϑ) sometimes may be problematic. Below the critical angle for the total external X-ray reflection, G stays strongly affected by a very weak Si-Kα signal from the Si bulk, although it can be easily compensated by counting XRF spectra longer. On the other hand, by using a competitive method by Li et al.58 the determination of factor G requires knowledge of the spatial distribution of the incident X-ray beam intensity, along with the construction parameters of the collimator and other distances at the X-ray detection path. Anyway, by the quantification scheme presented in this paper, the geometrical factor G does not give rise to the uncertainty of Ar ion retained doses.
With the XSW-free GIXRF quantification model Ar ion depth distribution profiles were also determined. Some differences apparent in Fig. 6 between the GIXRF-modelled Ar depth profiles and the one forecasted by the SRIM simulation need to be explained. A binary collision approximation adopted in the latter assumes only the existence of a ‘random’ target, which excludes all the channelling perturbations leading to increased implantation depths due to the corresponding change in the electronic stopping power. This may be very important during the implantation process due to the implemented Si crystalline wafer substrate. Moreover, the Monte Carlo simulation in the SRIM software is limited to a rather small (max ∼ 106) number of impinging ions and cannot by any means incorporate the dynamic mobility of noble gas Ar ions within the Si matrix close to the implantation area, especially at high doses, which may lead to significantly broadened distributions.
Conclusions
In this paper we proposed a novel quantification model for the GIXRF analysis of ions deeply implanted in Si wafers. Although the model does not import any XSW field distribution in the quantification process, the XSW field must be estimated in advance in order to restrict the range of grazing incidence angle that is suitable for the quantification. An indisputable advantage of the model is the absence of any requirement for the absolute calibration of the X-ray instrument with respect to the beam flux and the solid angle of detection. All that is needed to determine the ion retained doses and their in-depth distribution are the efficiencies of the X-ray detector used for XRF spectra acquisition and specific X-ray fundamental parameters. Applying the developed formalism, Ar ion retained doses deeply implanted into Si wafers were quantified. The highest Ar retained dose was additionally cross-checked with the ion beam analysis and found to be in decent agreement.
The model in its present form is not adequate for the GIXRF analysis of multi-layer structures and does not account for inter-element X-ray enhancement effects. However, the model can be flexibly extended with second order X-ray phenomena in order to enable its prospective application, e.g. for the characterization of multi-layers implanted with many different elements in semiconductors.
