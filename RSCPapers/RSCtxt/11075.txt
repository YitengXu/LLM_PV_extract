1 Introduction
Nowadays, the development of renewable and clean energy technologies is critical for satisfying the increasing demand of energy and environmental protection, which is necessary for the realization of sustainable development of the world. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been recognized as one of the most viable candidates since they were commercialized by Sony in the early 1990s. LIBs, owing to their higher energy density and longer cycle life than other secondary battery systems,1 have witnessed a dramatic growth in sales in the last two decades that was close to 10 billion in 2009.2
The electrochemical performance of LIBs strongly depends on the electrode materials, including both the positive and negative electrode materials. Recently, many efforts have been undertaken to improve the battery materials to enable their applications for electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).3 Conventional LIBs typically use graphite as negative electrode material due to its high abundance and outstanding kinetics.4 However, the graphite suffers from poor performance at a high charge–discharge rate and safety problems arising from the formation of lithium dendrite due to a low Li-intercalation potential of the graphite negative electrode, which is close to 0 V (vs. Li/Li+).5,6 A fundamental solution to solve this problem is to find good alternatives to carbon-based materials with better high rate performance and safety. Layered titanate nanostructures, which were derived from titania but have unusual physicochemical properties, have been considered as good negative electrode materials due to their excellent lithium-ion storage properties.7,8 Layered titanates manifest an inherent open, mesoporous structure, efficient transport of lithium ions, and good ion-exchange ratio, which result in a large charge–discharge capacity, good kinetic characteristic, and excellent robustness.8,9 Another valuable characteristic like most of the Ti-based materials is that a high operating voltage usually above 1 V (vs. Li/Li+) of these titanate negative electrodes could ensure a better safety of batteries by avoiding the problem of lithium dendrites compared to carbon-based electrodes.10,11
The composition and structure of layered titanates with different morphologies obtained from different reaction conditions are various; however, they do have some common structural properties.7 One is that the layers of the (100) plane consist of edge- and corner-sharing TiO6 octahedra building up to zigzag structures. The other one is a well-defined, layered structure with a relatively large interlayer distance (ca. 0.7–0.8 nm) and an atom of hydrogen situated in these interlayer cavities which could be exchanged by alkali metal ions. Therefore, layered titanates are considered as good titanium source precursors for controllably synthesizing nanostructured TiO2 polymorphs with different morphologies, such as TiO2-B, rutile and anatase titania, through the topotactic structural transformation of TiO6 octahedra accompanying a dehydration process. Such TiO2 polymorphs with a well-developed morphology exhibit superior lithium-ion insertion properties compared to their bulk counterparts and common nanoparticles. In addition, many novel titanate nanostructures can be prepared via an ion-exchange route starting from layered titanates, such as nanostructured Zn2Ti3O8, Li2MTi3O8 (M = Co, Zn, Mg) and Li4Ti5O12, which served as new negative electrode materials for LIBs. According to this synthetic strategy, it can provide a fundamental solution to rationally design nanostructural Ti-based electrode materials with better performance for LIBs.
The methods of preparation, possible crystal structures, mechanisms of formation and the physical properties of layered titanates have been reviewed.7,8,12,13 However, the specific review of the lithium intercalation performance of layered titanate nanostructures has not been reported. On the other hand, the recent emerging novel nanostructures derived from layered titanates exhibited various lithium intercalation behaviors, which also have not been summarized. To comprehensively review and highlight these Ti-based materials, this feature article is divided into two sections, summarizing respectively the recent progress in the lithium-ion storage performance of layered titanate nanostructures and their derivates including TiO2 polymorphs as well as novel titanate nanostructures. The main contents are illustrated in Fig. 1. The performance of their lithium-ion intercalation properties with respect to crystalline phase, morphology, and microstructures will be extensively discussed and analyzed.

2 Layered titanate nanostructures
The study of layered titanate nanostructures started with the titanate nanotubes reported by Kasuga et al. in 1998, which were wrongly recognized as TiO2 nanotubes initially.14 After that, many efforts were made to investigate their growth mechanism, composition, physical and chemical properties.8,13,15–17 Besides the titanate nanotubes, layered titanate nanowires/nanofibers (Na-titanate or K-titanate) and nanosheets were also synthesized through similar alkaline hydrothermal treatment of TiO2.18,19 Now they are generally considered as layered tritianates with a chemical formula of H2Ti3O7, or a family of layered hydrogen titanates with a formula of H2TinO2n+1·H2O.15 Although the exact crystal structure of this class of layered titanates is currently disputed, their physical and chemical properties can often be significantly different from those of TiO2 polymorphs. Due to their promising open layered channel, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure and large surface area, these layered titanates have exhibited large reversible capacity and high rate performance when used as negative electrode materials for LIBs.8
Many efforts were devoted to study the structure of titanate nanotubes due to their distinguished geometries (Fig. 2).13–15 Generally, sodium titanate nanotubes were first formed under the alkaline hydrothermal treatment of titania, and then transformed into hydrogen titanate nanotubes after the ion-exchange of Na+ by H+ during washing in dilute acidic solution. The outer and inner diameters of the nanotubes were found to be ca. 9 and 4 nm, respectively. The walls of the nanotubes are always multilayered and sometimes a nanotube has a different number of layers in the two different sides (Fig. 2a). Structurally, nanotubes can be scrolled, “onion”, or concentric in type. It is worth mentioning that the interlayer distance of the titanate nanotubes is up to 0.78 nm, much larger than that of commercial layered LiCoO2 electrode materials; this could provide a very promising channel for lithium ion intercalation and release with freedom.

Zhang et al. first reported the lithium-ion insertion behavior of H-titanate nanotubes (Fig. 3). The smoothly sloping nature of the voltage profiles indicates that there is no two phase interface during the lithium intercalation into the H-titanate nanotubes.20 Such H-titanate nanotubes showed a large capacity at the initial discharge (282.2 mA h g−1) over the potential range of 2.5–1.0 V and very good high rate performance as well as good cyclic stability. The superior lithium-ion storage properties of H-titanate nanotubes may be due to the layered structure with large interlayer spacing and open nanotube end. Actually, H-titanate nanotubes have unique kinetics for lithium intercalation of pseudocapacitive behavior, resulting in a good high rate performance.21,22

Recently, Li et al. reported a facile hydrothermal route for the preparation of H-titanate with a novel urchin-like nano/micro-structure (Fig. 4a and b).23 Due to the features of its microsized spherical structure assembled by nanosized quasi-1D tubular components, this material showed a higher capacity compared to the H-titanate nanotubes as negative electrode materials for LIBs.

Compared to titanate nanotubes, titanate nanowires are usually synthesized at a higher reaction temperature and through a long-term alkaline hydrothermal treatment. Energetically, nanofibres are thermodynamically more stable than nanotubes, since the former has a smaller surface area and lower stress within the crystal lattice. Structurally, they have a similar layered characteristic with a scrolling structure for nanotubes and a layer-by-layer stacking structure for nanowires.12 However, they hold different local lattice structures, resulting in different TiO2 phases after heat treatment. Generally, hydrogen titanate nanowires are likely to be transformed into TiO2-B by subsequent heat treatment (∼400 °C) and can maintain their morphology well. At higher temperatures, they would be transformed to nanofibrous anatase (700 °C) and then formation of microfibrous rutile (1000 °C).24
The behavior of the lithium insertion into titanate nanowires is also governed by a pseudocapacitive faradic process, which is similar to that of titanate nanotubes.25 Our group prepared titanate nanowires using TiAl alloy as a titanium source by a hydrothermal method. The diameter of the nanowires was found to be ca. 30 nm and the length up to several micrometers. It is worth mentioning that the titanate nanowires exhibited a large capacity of 100 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at a current density as high as 40 A g−1, manifesting excellent high rate performance.26
Compared to sodium titanate nanowires, reports on the lithium-ion intercalation property of potassium titanate nanowires are relatively rare. Most recently, Wang and our group reported the cooperative study on Li-storage behavior of layered H2Ti6O13-nanowires. The typical size of H2Ti6O13-nanowires is 5–7 nm in diameter and 50–150 nm in length (Fig. 5). This material exhibited a high capacitance of 828 F g−1 within the potential window from 2.0 to 1.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) in non-aqueous electrolyte. An asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using H2Ti6O13-nanowires as a negative electrode and ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) as a positive electrode, which had a maximum energy density of 90 W h kg−1 and displayed the highest average power density of 11000 W kg−1.27 These results suggest that H2Ti6O13-nanowires are a promising electrode material for fast energy storage.

3 Derivatives of layered titanates
Recently, many efforts have been devoted to controllably synthesize TiO2-based nanostructured materials with well-designed morphology from the phase transition of layered titanates by the solid state reaction or the wet-chemical reaction.28–34 Conventionally, organic Ti-containing precursors or titanium halide were used as titanium sources for preparing TiO2-based materials. However, it is still hard to synthesize TiO2 nanostructures with desirable morphology and phase using these Ti-containing precursors owing to their rapid hydrolysis. On the other hand, many organic additives were usually used in the reaction system to restrain the hydrolysis rate, which are still too expensive and limited for large-scale applications. In this respect, layered titanates could be a suitable titanium source precursor for synthesizing TiO2-based nanostructured materials due to their inherent environmental friendliness, well-developed morphology and slow reaction rate, which are in favor of controllable synthesis.
3.1 TiO2 polymorphs

3.1.1 TiO2-B. 
TiO2-B, has the advantage over the other titanium dioxide polymorphs of being a relatively open structure, and is an excellent host for Li intercalation. The crystal structure of TiO2-B is monoclinic (space group C2/m), and composed of edge and corner-sharing TiO6 octahedra. It has been proved that the b-axis channel ([010] direction) is the most favorable direction for Li ion diffusion based on theoretical studies.35–37 Computational studies based on density functional theory (DFT) also revealed the results of three Li diffusion paths with respect to their energy barriers (010) (path ii) < (001) (path i) < (100) (path iii), suggesting an anisotropic transport behavior in TiO2-B single crystals. In another respect, it is evidenced by cyclic voltammetry that Li-insertion into TiO2-B is governed by a pseudocapacitive faradaic process, whose rate is not limited by the solid-state diffusion of Li+ over a broad interval of scan rates.38 These results give us a good guidance for the design of TiO2-B negative electrode materials in LIBs with better performance.
It is known that layered hydrogen titanates can be converted to TiO2-B by heat treatment.39,40 In view of this, nanostructured TiO2-B could be easily obtained from nanostructured layered titanates after subsequent heating. Armstrong et al. first reported the synthesis of TiO2-B nanowires and their lithium-ion insertion properties.28 Nanowires with a diameter of 20–40 nm and a length of 2–10 μm were successfully prepared through a one-step alkaline hydrothermal reaction of anatase TiO2 following heat treatment. The TiO2-B nanowires delivered a high capacity of 275 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10 mA g−1, corresponding to a composition of Li0.82TiO2, which was larger than that of bulk TiO2-B. It has also been demonstrated that the TiO2-B nanowires exhibited good cyclic stability and a much better lithium-ion intercalation property compared with anatase TiO2.41 TiO2-B nanotubes could be obtained by a similar synthetic route, which could store more Li (Li0.98TiO2) than that of nanowires at the same current rate. However, the nanotubes showed inferior kinetics and more irreversible capacity compared with nanowires at the initial cycle, and the real reason is still unclear.42
There is an easy route for preparing TiO2-B nanowires by the direct heat treatment of hydrogen titanate nanowires. However, such nanowires have a low surface area and a relative large diameter (∼20 to 100 nm), which is not small enough to influence the energy of lithium intercalation. Recently, Xu et al. prepared TiO2-B nanowires with ultrahigh surface area by a hydrothermal method using K2Ti6O13 nanowires as a precursor.43 Such TiO2-B nanowires showed higher capacity and better rate performance than those prepared by direct heat treatment of H2Ti3O7 nanowires, which may be due to their high BET surface area and shorter b- and c-axis channels across the nanowires.
Compared to 1D TiO2-B nanowires or nanotubes, hierarchical TiO2-B nanostructures seemed to show better performance. Fig. 6a and b shows the morphology and microstructure of the TiO2-B microspheres analyzed by electron microscopy characterization methods. These microspheres have a relatively narrow pore size distribution and a large BET surface area of 126 m2 g−1. The cells made of this material demonstrated higher capacity and better rate performance than commercial anatase TiO2 nanopowder with a similar surface area. It is noteworthy that the TiO2-B microspheres showed an excellent long-term high rate cyclic performance (maintained at 149 mA h g−1 after 5000 cycles at 10 C), as presented in Fig. 6c.44 In fact, these mesoporous TiO2-B microspheres have two advantages: one is the mesoporous structure resulting in adequate electrode–electrolyte contact and facile electronic transport along the boundary of sintered nanograins. The other one is the microsphere morphology which can create compact electrode layers and is in favor of electrode fabrication. The integration of these features enables this material to have a superior lithium storage performance, also much better than that of common mesoporous TiO2-B.45 However, it is relatively complex synthesis, involving many steps to achieve the TiO2-B polymorph material from the transformation of layered titanate H2Ti2O5·H2O.

Recently, Liu et al. reported a facile method to synthesize hierarchical porous TiO2-B with thin nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 7, TiO2-B ultrathin nanosheets were transformed from layered titanate with a typical lamellar structure. The hierarchical TiO2-B has a porous structure with a large BET surface area of 151 m2 g−1. It is worth mentioning that the TiO2-B nanosheets exhibited remarkably improved lithium-ion storage properties compared with 1D TiO2-B nanowires and nanotubes. A high capacity of 200 mA h g−1 can be retained after 200 cycles at a high current density of 10 C (3350 mA g−1).46 Hierarchical TiO2-B nanosheets ensure the fast insertion and extraction of Li-ions due to their porous structure, with thin nanosheet wall effectively extending the interfacial zone and thus can greatly promote ionic transport and electrode reaction.

Generally, the synthesis of nanostructured TiO2-B can be achieved by the dehydration of layered titanate derived from alkaline hydrothermal treatment of TiO2 powder or hydrothermal treatment of a particular titanium complex precursor.47,48 The formation of an intermediate phase of layered titanate is usually needed to obtain TiO2-B. The lithium insertion properties of TiO2-B strongly depend on the size, surface area and morphology. Large surface area and small size are crucial for TiO2-B negative electrodes with a superior lithium storage performance due to their pseudocapacitive characteristic.


3.1.2 Ordered TiO2 superstructures (mesocrystals). 
Superstructures have received intensive research interest owing to their unique and tunable chemical and physical properties and new collective functions they offer.49,50 Mesocrystals, first proposed by Cölfen and Antonietti, are a new class of superstructured materials, and are composed of crystalline nanoparticles with a mutual orientation between the nanocrystal building units.51,52 They possess the advantages inherited from single crystals and porous characteristics, and thus are considered as promising substitutes for single-crystalline or polycrystalline materials. For instance, energy storage materials fabricated by hierarchical and porous mesocrystals can be considered as ideal materials for LIBs with high rate performance.53,54 Recently, our group successfully synthesized a class of unique TiO2 mesocrystals with well-developed morphology by using ultrathin titanate nanowires as building units.34,55,56 Such highly ordered TiO2 superstructures constructed by 1D nanowires exhibited significantly improved lithium insertion properties compared to the common nanoparticles.

Fig. 8 shows the SEM, TEM and HRTEM images of the nanorod-like mesocrystals constructed by ultrathin rutile TiO2 nanowires prepared by a low-temperature, additive-free synthetic route. The lengths and diameters of the nanorods were mostly found to be ca. 300 and 60–80 nm, respectively (Fig. 8a and b). As presented in Fig. 8c (right inset), the related selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern with “single-crystal-like” diffraction from the whole nanorod indicated that these regular nanorods were composed of crystallographically ordered rutile TiO2 nanowires arranged along the [001] direction. The boundaries of the nanowires (ca. 3–5 nm) were clear and the nanowires aggregated together by perfect or imperfect attachments, as highlighted in the inset (Fig. 8d), which are strong evidence of oriented attachment (OA).57,58 It was proposed that the rutile TiO2 mesocrystals were formed through homoepitaxial aggregation of the ultrathin nanowires via face to-face oriented attachment, accompanied and promoted by simultaneous phase transformation from the precursor hydrogen titanate to rutile TiO2.34

Fig. 9a presents the rate capability of the rutile TiO2 mesocrystals from 0.5 to 5 C for 10 cycles at each current rate. It was revealed that the TiO2 mesocrystals demonstrated a good rate performance and delivered a large stable capacity of ca. 200 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C. It is noteworthy that a stable reversible capacity of 171.3 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1 C can be retained, indicating an excellent performance of the rutile TiO2 mesocrystals (shown in Fig. 9b), better than that of nanosized rutile and porous rutile TiO2 nanorod microspheres.59,60 Such enhanced lithium storage properties may be attributed to the mesoscopic structure of the rutile TiO2 mesocrystals constructed by ultrathin nanowires, which offers a large specific surface area and short transport distance, and thus facilitates the lithium-ion intercalation reaction at the interface, and short distance for both mass and charge transport, as well as freedom for the volume change accompanied by lithium-ion intercalation.34

It is interesting that the homoepitaxial self-assembly process of the titanate nanowires could be easily controlled by a suitable surfactant. Unique nanoporous rutile TiO2 mesocrystals with Wulff shape are presented in Fig. 10, which were prepared in the presence of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) at a low temperature.54 The nanoporous mesocrystals were constructed from nanowires, providing a large surface area, and were highly oriented with “single-crystal-like” diffraction spots. Accordingly, such porous single crystals are typical for mesocrystals formed through an oriented self-assembly process in which the links between nanocrystals are formed partly by the nanocrystals themselves and partly by an organic substance.51 It is notable that the morphology of the mesocrystals were tunable depending on the content of the SDBS additive. Furthermore, the nanoporous rutile TiO2 mesocrystals demonstrated a large reversible charge–discharge capacity, excellent cyclic stability and high rate performance for rechargeable LIBs. Large capacities of 397.9 and 275.6 mA h g−1 were obtained at the initial discharge and charge cycle at a current density of 0.2 C and a reversible capacity of 154 mA h g−1 could be retained after 100 cycles at 1 C. The nanoporous and large surface area nature of the rutile mesocrystals facilitated their contact with the electrolyte, provided sufficient void space for accommodating volume change during lithium-ion insertion, and hence resulted in a large capacity and good cyclic stability.54

The morphology and crystalline phase could be synthetically controlled through the use of different counterions in the solution reaction system. Dumbbell-shaped rutile TiO2 superstructures were obtained from a 2 M HCl aqueous solution, as presented in Fig. 11a and b. The dumbbell-shaped TiO2 superstructures were about 600–800 nm in length, and were constructed from very thin, loose nanowires. It is suggested that the aligned nanowire subunits were ordered locally in the whole dumbbell, or that there was a relatively large mismatch between the boundaries of the nanowires from the SAED pattern (Fig. 11b, inset). Also, it was revealed that the nanowires were all oriented along the same direction of [001]. Besides, the morphology of the TiO2 dumbbells could be controlled simply by adjusting the reaction temperature, and the nanorod-like rutile TiO2 mesocrystals were formed in HNO3 aqueous solution.56

It is very interesting that a sample with a different phase (anatase) was obtained from the H2SO4 aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 11c, anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with quasi-octahedral or truncated-octahedral shape and a size of about 25–50 nm were built from very tiny nanoparticle subunits. The SAED pattern taken from the whole nanoparticle exhibited “single-crystal-like” diffraction (Fig. 11d, inset); this suggests that the tiny nanoparticle subunits were highly oriented and led to the formation of truncated-octahedral nanoparticles oriented along the [101] direction and elongated along the [001] direction. Accordingly, the nanoparticle subunits ultimately oriented towards the formation of Wulff-shaped anatase mesocrystals, corresponding to the principles of single crystal growth.61 These results may suggest that the mesocrystal was an intermediate for the formation of the single crystal, and that its growth direction was the same as the ordinary single crystal. It is worth noticing that the BET surface area of the anatase TiO2 mesocrystals was as high as 225 m2 g−1, and the total pore volume was 0.43 cm−3 g−1. Besides, the mesocrystals exhibited a very narrow micropore size distribution of ∼0.55 nm, which is extraordinary for TiO2 mesocrystals.56 The possible formation mechanism of these TiO2 superstructures is illustrated in Fig. 11e. The titanate has a layered structure and is composed of edge sharing TiO6 octahedra, with H+ or K+ ions located in the interspaces. Bearing the structures of the TiO2 polymorph in mind, it could be concluded that the linear chains can only form rutile-type nuclei, whereas skewed chains can only form anatase-type nuclei.62 Thus, the precursor titanate nanowires readily kept their shape when they were transformed into rutile TiO2 in HCl/HNO3 aqueous solution. However, the titanate is likely to transform to anatase in the presence of SO42− due to a large steric blocking effect on the arrangement of the TiO6 octahedra, which cannot be arranged by linear chains but only by skewed chains, leading to the formation of anatase-type nuclei.63
The Li+ intercalation property of these ordered TiO2 superstructures as well as their comparative studies with the common nanoparticles with similar specific surface area were tested and are shown in Fig. 12. The dumbbell-shaped rutile delivered a high discharge capacity of 295.6 mA h g−1 and a charge capacity of 253.6 mA h g−1 in the first cycle at a low rate of 0.2 C, and demonstrated a small capacity loss of 14%, whereas the rutile nanoparticles showed a large capacity loss of 53% at the same condition. The difference in the reversible capacity of the two materials was even more remarkable with increased current rates. The dumbbell-shaped rutile TiO2 exhibited a superior rate performance, with 175 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C, 156 mA h g−1 at 1 C, 137 mA h g−1 at 2 C, and 103 mA h g−1 at 5 C; the rutile nanoparticles showed 76 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C, 58 mA h g−1 at 1 C, 42 mA h g−1 at 2 C, and 28 mA h g−1 at 5 C. Also, the quasi-octahedral anatase TiO2 mesocrystals exhibited improved rate performance and better cyclic performance compared to commercial anatase TiO2 nanoparticles for lithium ion storage. The enhanced lithium-ion storage properties for the mesocrystals may be due to their porous characteristic, and also because the crystallographically oriented nanocrystals for mesocrystals would have few grain boundaries compared with polycrystalline materials.51

3.2 A family of novel titanate negative electrodes
Layered titanates usually have an open layered channel with a relatively large interlayer distance (ca. 0.7–0.8 nm), resulting in a good ion exchange property with metal ions. Many metal ions, such as Ag+, Cu2+, Pb2+ and Eu3+, could irreversibly and selectively exchange with the ions (Na+ or H+) located in the layered titanates.64,65 However, the metal ion exchange with layered titanates was not complete in these cases. Most recently, our group prepared a family of novel titanate negative electrode materials, including Zn2Ti3O8 and Li2MTi3O8 (M = Co, Zn, Mg, Co0.5Zn0.5) nanowires, through an ion exchange method with layered titanate nanotubes and nanowires following heat treatment.66–69

3.2.1 Zn2Ti3O8. 
It is well known that zinc titanates crystallize in three common forms: Zn2TiO4 (face-centered cubic), Zn2Ti3O8 (cubic) and ZnTiO3 (hexagonal). Zn2Ti3O8 is a metastable phase among them and the pure phase Zn2Ti3O8 is difficult to prepare. In our previous work, layered titanate NaxH2−xTi3O7 nanotubes were used as a precursor to synthesize Zn2Ti3O8 nanowires via a simple ion exchange route with an aqueous ammonia solution containing Zn2+ ions. Zn2Ti3O8 phase was formed after ion exchange following heat treatment, as illustrated in Fig. 13.66 The Zn2Ti3O8 nanowires with a length of about several hundreds of nanometers to several tens of micrometers tended to lie close to each other to form a bundle-like morphology. Interestingly, the nanowires collapsed to form nanoparticles with increasing calcination temperature, and were composed of interconnected nanoparticles through a directional coalescence.

The Zn2Ti3O8 electrode showed typical sloping charge–discharge profiles (Fig. 13e), indicating that the nature of the lithium-ion intercalation into Zn2Ti3O8 nanowires remained a single-phase process. Also, the lithium-ion storage capacity strongly depended on the surface area of the electrode materials. The Zn2Ti3O8 nanowires obtained at 500 °C have the largest surface area and deliver the highest capacity. These results may suggest that Zn2Ti3O8 has a pseudocapacitive behavior for lithium-ion intercalation. The Zn2Ti3O8 nanowires also demonstrated good rate capability and excellent cyclic performance. However, it is still necessary to investigate the intrinsic lithium-ion storage mechanism and evaluate the structural durability in the future.


3.2.2 Li2MTi3O8 (M = Co, Zn, Mg, Co0.5Zn0.5). 
A considerable number of ternary lithium spinels with the composition Li2MM3O8 have been investigated and have been considered as an intermediate composition between the two binary oxides Li4M54+O12 and M22+M4+O4.70 For these composites, either tetrahedral or octahedral sites can be occupied by more than one kind of cation, and 1:3 cation ordering in octahedral sites is commonly observed. For instance, Li2ZnTi3O8 retains a ratio of 1:3 cation ordering between Li and Ti over two sets of octahedral sites below 1150 °C, and was also described as the spinel join of Li4Ti5O12–Zn2TiO4.71 The distribution of alkaline metal ions (M) in Li2CoTi3O8 is a little different from that in Li2ZnTi3O8, their structures can be described as (Li0.5Co0.45)tet[(Li0.45Co0.05)Ti1.5]octO4 and (Li0.5Zn0.5)tet[(Li0.5)Ti1.5]octO4, respectively. Although the electrochemical properties of these composites have been investigated, the lithium-ion storage capability was poor for the Li2MTi3O8 bulk materials.70 Recently, it was revealed by our group that the nanostructured electrode of Li2ZnTi3O8 composite demonstrated high capacity and good cyclic stability, which provides a new promising application of Li2MTi3O8 composites as negative electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries.67
Most recently, our group prepared a class of Li2MTi3O8 (M = Co, Zn, Co0.5Zn0.5) nanowires using titanate nanowires as a precursor, which were synthesized through alkaline hydrothermal treatment of anatase TiO2 powders.68Fig. 14a–c shows the SEM, TEM and HRTEM images of the Li2CoTi3O8 nanowires synthesized at 650 °C. The nanowires were highly crystalline and their lengths were in the range of several hundreds of nanometers to several tens of micrometers. The morphology of Li2ZnTi3O8 nanowires was similar to that of Li2CoTi3O8 nanowires, which aggregated together to form bundles (Fig. 14d). The Li2ZnTi3O8 nanowires were also highly crystalline with a diameter of several tens of nanometers. It is worth mentioning that the complex spinel Li2Co0.5Zn0.5Ti3O8 nanowires could be prepared and were confirmed by HRTEM and EDX analysis. In a word, the morphology of these novel spinel titanate nanowires was basically the same as that of the precursor, indicating that the titanate nanowires precursor possesses a good thermal stability.

The lithium-ion storage properties of the Li2MTi3O8 (M = Co, Zn, Co0.5Zn0.5) nanowires were studied in detail, as presented in Fig. 15. An intense anodic peak at 1.5–2.0 V and a weak cathodic peak at 1.3–1.5 V were observed for these complex spinel nanowires (Fig. 15a). Besides, a reduction peak below 0.5 V was also detected for them, which might be attributable to the multiple restoration of Ti4+, in agreement with reports by Borghols et al.72 and Ge et al.73 Charge plateaus at 1.65, 1.53 and 1.46 V for Li2CoTi3O8, Li2Co0.5Zn0.5Ti3O8 and Li2ZnTi3O8 were observed, respectively (Fig. 15b). This might suggest that the charge plateaus could be tunable with different metal ions (M) in Li2MTi3O8. Fig. 15c exhibits the rate capability of Li2CoTi3O8 nanowires and particles, the Li2CoTi3O8 nanowires exhibited excellent rate capability and cycling stability even at a current density as high as 1.6 A g−1, and a stable capacity of 230 mA h g−1 could be retained when the current rate gradually returned to 0.1 A g−1. By contrast, Li2CoTi3O8 particles showed remarkable low capacity and poor rate performance, only a reversible capacity of <140 mA h g−1 was maintained at the same current rate. Similar results were observed for Li2ZnTi3O8 nanowires and particles (Fig. 15d). The nanowires showed a reversible capacity of 240 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 130 mA h g−1 at 3.2 A g−1, delivering a remarkably improved rate performance compared to bulk particles. It is proposed that 1D nanowires with a diameter of several tens of nanometers greatly decrease the diffusion distance for lithium ions and electrons in the solid state, resulting in an enhanced lithium-ion intercalation performance. XRD analysis and TEM images of the electrodes at different discharged and charged states revealed that a change of the crystal structure for Li2MTi3O8 materials was not detected during the lithium-ion intercalation/deintercalation process. This may suggest that Li2MTi3O8 electrode materials possess a typical intercalation reaction mechanism, which is similar to spinel Li4Ti5O12.67,68 Therefore, Li2MTi3O8 nanowires are a class of promising negative electrode materials for high-power lithium-ion batteries.

3.2.3 Nanostructured Li4Ti5O12. 
Many nanostructured Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) could be synthesized by a similar synthetic strategy. Spinel Li4Ti5O12 nanotubes/nanowires were first prepared by a low temperature hydrothermal lithium ion exchange method from hydrogen titanate nanotubes/nanowires precursors. This ion exchange method is a good way to prepare nanostructured LTO electrode materials with enhanced electrochemical kinetics for lithium insertion.74 Ultrathin LTO nanosheets could also be synthesized by a similar ion exchange method from ultrathin titanate nanowires. The LTO nanosheets have a large surface area of 159.2 m2 g−1 and their thickness was found to be ca. 5–7 nm. It was demonstrated that LTO nanosheets displayed a large reversible capacity and high rate performance.75 Very recently, Shen et al. fabricated self-supported LTO nanowire arrays from the layered titanate H2Ti2O5·H2O nanowire arrays grown on Ti foil prepared by an alkaline hydrothermal method. The LTO nanowire arrays exhibited a remarkably improved lithium-ion intercalation property after hydrogenation in 5% v/v H2 in Ar at temperatures ranging from 500–700 °C for 1.5 h. It was demonstrated that the introduction of Ti3+ in LTO nanowires can greatly enhance the ion and/or electron conductivity, resulting in a good high rate performance.76

4 Summary
The recently emerged layered titanate nanostructures prepared through a simple alkaline hydrothermal route provide promising applications as negative electrode materials for LIBs, with large reversible capacity, high rate performance and good safety. This is due to their unique combination of physical and chemical properties including an open layered channel, large surface area and good kinetic characteristics, ensuring efficient lithium-ion transport and diffusion. Furthermore, layered titanates served as environmental friendly precursors to controllably synthesize nanostructured TiO2 polymorphs with different morphologies through the topotactic structural transformation of TiO6 octahedra accompanying a dehydration process. Such TiO2 polymorphs with well-designed morphology show a superior lithium-ion insertion property compared to their bulk counterparts and common nanoparticles. It is highlighted that a class of highly ordered TiO2 superstructures (mesocrystals), with well-developed morphology built by ultrathin layered titanate nanowires units, show large capacity, excellent cyclic stability and remarkably improved rate performance when used as negative electrode materials for LIBs. In addition, a family of novel titanate nanostructures including Zn2Ti3O8, Li2MTi3O8 (M = Co, Zn, Mg) and Li4Ti5O12 were synthesized through an ion exchange method with layered titanate following heat treatment. This is a class of promising negative electrode materials for LIBs due to their large capacity, good cyclic performance and superior rate capability. According to this synthetic strategy, it can provide a fundamental solution to rationally design nanostructured Ti-based electrode materials with better performance for LIBs.
