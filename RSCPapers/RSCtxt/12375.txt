    , Accepted 1st June 2018First published on 4th June 2018AbstractNear infrared light (NIR) photodetectors based on one-dimensional semiconductor nanowires have generated considerable interest due to their practical application in versatile fields. We present a facile yet efficient approach to rationally integrating KCu7S4 semiconductor nanowires by the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique. A self-powered near infrared (NIR) light photodetector is fabricated by transferring a close-packed KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer to the surface of a silicon wafer. The as-fabricated Si/KCu7S4 heterojunction with a close-packed and well-aligned nanowire array exhibits splendid photovoltaic performance when illuminated by NIR light, allowing the detection of NIR light without an exterior power supply. The photodetector exhibits a high sensitivity to NIR light (980 nm, 295.3 μW cm−2) with responsivity (R) 15 mA W−1 and detectivity (D*) 2.15 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1. Significantly, the device shows the capability to work under high pulsed light irradiation up to 50 kHz with a high-speed response (response time τr 7.4 μs and recovery time τf 8.6 μs). This facilitates the fabrication of low-cost and high-speed photodetectors and integrated optoelectronic sensor circuitry.
Introduction
With a high aspect ratio, nanowires allow sufficient propagation of carriers or photons freely along one dimension and represent an important building block for bridging the nanoscopic and macroscopic world, which has aroused a great deal of interest in the field of nanodevices.1 Significant advancement has been made in the synthesis of nanowires, and their size, shape and crystallinity can be well controlled.2,3 The unique characteristics, such as the dislocation free single-crystalline nature, high index of refraction and atomically smooth surface, endow the nanowire-based electronic and optoelectronic devices with high performance outperforming their thin-film counterparts. Axial4 or radial5 composition and doping modulation in a single nanowire structure represent an approach for enhancing performance and/or enabling new function through synthesis. However, for electronic (logic and memory) and optoelectronic devices (such as photodetectors, light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic elements for solar cells), integration or alignment of inorganic semiconductor nanowires into complex and novel mesostructures exhibits broader application potential.6–8 Recently, Ray et al. reviewed the fabrication of Si and Ge nanowires by both bottom-up in situ growth and a top-down etching approach.9 Notably, well-defined nanowire arrays can be easily integrated into devices using the top-down etching approach. This provides an effective route for high performance devices such as nanogenerators10 and nanophotovoltaic devices.11 On the other hand, for practical use, scalable and low-cost bottom-up methods are still highly desirable for heterogeneous integration and compatibility with on-chip technologies.
Alignment of inorganic nanowires over the wafer scale of flat and patterned substrates is pivotal for application in nanodevices.12,13 A variety of principles and strategies, such as interface-induced nanowire assembly,14 capillary printing,15 blown bubble film transfer,16 and electrospinning process,17 have been reported to control the assembly of inorganic nanowires with aligned orientation in nanofabrication. Among these multitudinous assembly methods, the Langmuir–Blodgett technique stands out as a promising candidate to assemble nanoparticles and nanowires over a large area.18 The LB method can facially create amphiphilic monolayers onto a water–air interface, which could be transferred onto a solid substrate.18,19 LB assembly provides a programmable method to construct macroscopic nanomaterials with precisely controlled organization, both close-packed nanostructures and well-defined patterns with low density.20–22 It provides versatile and promising applications in nanodevices such as photoswitching devices,21 gas sensors,22 and electrochromic devices.23 In contrast, traditional fabrication methods for high-performance thin film devices such as metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD),24 atomic layer deposition (ALD),25 and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)26 normally require sophisticated high vacuum equipment and a fairly well-controlled environment, which inevitably lead to high operating costs.
KCu7S4 is a kind of important thiocuprate, which has great potential in fields such as solid-state supercapacitors27 and nonvolatile memory devices.28 Its lattice is composed of a three-dimensional Cu–S framework with pseudo-one-dimensional channels; therefore KCu7S4 quasi 1D nanostructures tend to be formed. It provides a large aspect-ratio and a direct pathway for charge transport. Meanwhile, a strong NIR absorption has been observed for KCu7S4 nanowires, which is believed to arise from localized surface plasma resonances (LSPRs).28 LSPR has been widely observed in metal nanomaterials with high electron density and some nonmetal semiconductor nanostructures with a high density of free charge carriers (electrons or holes). It is known to be the collective oscillation of electron gas in nanoscale solids excited by light at an appropriate wavelength, resulting in strong electromagnetic fields around their surface.29 The strong local electromagnetic field will substantially enhance the optical absorption as well as the photocurrent, which facilitates the application of KCu7S4 in the field of NIR photodetectors. Herein, the controllable self-assembly of a KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer with a close-packed and well-aligned nanowire array has been successfully realized by the LB technique on a large scale. The Si/KCu7S4 heterojunction formed by transferring the KCu7S4 monolayer to the surface of the Si wafer exhibits high sensitivity to 980 nm near infrared (NIR) light (295.3 μW cm−2) with responsivity (R) 15 mA W−1, detectivity (D*) 2.15 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1, noise equivalent power (NEP) 1.6 × 10−9 W and a fast response speed (response time τr 7.4 μs and recovery time τf 8.6 μs) at a switching frequency of 50 kHz. It presents a simple and universal pathway for the fabrication of high-performance NIR photodetectors.
Experimental
Chemicals
All the reagents (analytical-grade purity) were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagents Co. and used without any further purification.
Synthesis of KCu7S4 nanowires
KCu7S4 nanowires were synthesized according to a previous report of our group with a minor modification.28 In a typical process, 3.87 g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 5.11 g of potassium hydroxide (KOH) with a Na/K atomic ratio of 51.5:48.5 were dissolved in 30 mL of distilled water to form a homogeneous solution with the concentration of OH− ions of ∼6 mol L−1. Then, 3 mmol of copper(II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O), 0.3 mL of ethylene diamine, 12 mmol of sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O) and 3 mL of hydrazine hydrate were added into the vessel sequentially. After thorough stirring, the vessel was sealed and kept at 80 °C in a water bath for 1 h. The taupe sponge-like products were finally collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 4 h for further characterization.
PVP coating of KCu7S4 nanowires
The freshly prepared KCu7S4 nanowires suffered from poor water solubility and were prone to agglomeration owing to their superlong structure and deficiency of surfactant. Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw = 40000) molecules were employed to coat along KCu7S4 nanowires to improve their dispersibility in water and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) before the LB assembly process. Briefly, 0.1 g of freshly synthesized KCu7S4 nanowires, 0.6 g of PVP powder, and 20 ml of deionized water were mixed together and the resulting suspension was agitated magnetically for more than 6 hours at room temperature. After the coating treatment, the product was collected by centrifugation at a rate of 4000 rpm for 6 minutes, washed with deionized water and DMF, and redispersed in DMF for further use.
LB assembly of the ordered KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer
The ordered KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer film was obtained using a modified LB technique. 2 mg of KCu7S4 nanowires dispersed in 0.5 ml of DMF was added into the mixed solution (1 mL DMF and 1 mL chloroform) to form a homogeneous solution at ambient temperature. After this, the KCu7S4 nanowire suspension was syringed onto the water (Millipore Milli-Q water, resistivity 18.2 MΩ cm) drop by drop. LB assembly was performed using a KSV-NIMA instrument (Alter, KN2006). Thirty minutes later, the surface nanowire monolayer was compressed at a rate of 10 cm2 min−1. A platinum sheet was half dipped into the LB trough to monitor the surface pressure in real time. The surface pressure kept rising gradually till the fold parallel to the barrier direction appeared.
Spray assembly of the disordered KCu7S4 nanowire film
The disordered KCu7S4 nanowire film was fabricated by spray assembly as a comparison. In brief, appropriate KCu7S4 nanowire aqueous solution was filled into a high pressure spray equipment and sprayed onto the surface of the Si wafer and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at 90 °C and 60 °C, respectively.
Device fabrication
A lightly doped Si wafer (n-type, (100)-oriented, 1–10 Ω cm, 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) was chosen as the substrate. Plasma processing was employed to form a hydrophilic surface on the silicon substrate before device fabrication and a stripe of Sellotape was put on one end to work as an insulating layer. The silicon substrate was pulled out parallel to the KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer and laid flat to dry naturally. Eutectic In:Ga was pasted onto the reverse of the n-Si substrate for Ohmic-contact with the bottom electrode and a top Au (50 nm) electrode was deposited onto the KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer by electron beam deposition with a shadow mask, which was just above the Sellotape. For convenience of measurement, the devices were mounted onto a printed circuit board (PCB).
Structural analysis and device characterization
The morphologies of nanowire monolayers were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Merlin Compact) at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. Element composition analysis was carried out by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford INCA, attached to FESEM). The chemical phase of the as-synthesized product was analyzed using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern obtained on a Philips X'Pert PRO SUPER X-ray diffractometer by Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The UV-vis spectra were obtained on a UV-vis spectrometer (SHIMADZU SOLID3700 spectrometer). Copper contents were quantitatively measured using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, Optima 7300 DV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi system.
The plasma treatment was carried out under an argon atmosphere with a plasma cleaner (PDC-32G). The optoelectronic characterization of the Si/KCu7S4 heterojunction was carried out at room temperature with a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200-SCS), using a laser diode (980 nm) as the illumination source. A home-built analysis system composed of a laser diode, an oscilloscope (Tektronix, TDS2012B) and a pulse generator was used to investigate the photoresponse properties of the device under different pulsed light illumination. The spectral response and the noise current were studied using a home-built system composed of a xenon lamp (150 W), a monochromator (Omni-λ300) and a lock-in amplifier (SR830). Before device characterization, the intensity of the incident light was calibrated using a power meter (PM 100D, Thorlabs GmbH.).
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the as-synthesized products can be indexed to body-centered tetragonal KCu7S4 (JCPDS card no. 83-0357). No extra peak is observed, confirming that the products are of high purity and single phase. The typical SEM images exhibit that the as-synthesized products feature a nanowire morphology with a diameter of 100–300 nm and length up to hundreds of micrometers (Fig. 1b and c). They can serve as building blocks for further LB assembly. The element composition of the nanowires is verified by EDS mappings shown in Fig. 1d, which indicates the uniform distribution of elements within the nanowires, including copper, sulfur and potassium. As shown in the UV-Vis absorption spectrum (Fig. S1a†), KCu7S4 nanowires present a strong absorption in the NIR region, which lead to efficient photovoltaic performance when illuminated by NIR light. To further analyse the composition of PVP-coated nanowires, XPS measurement is carried out to characterize the valence state of all the constituent chemical elements as shown in Fig. S1b.†

The detailed schematic illustration for the fabrication of the Si/KCu7S4 heterojunction device is shown in Fig. 2a. Superlong KCu7S4 nanowires are randomly distributed at the air–liquid interface in the Langmuir trough at first. As the surface pressure gradually increases, the randomly scattered KCu7S4 nanowires are compressed and shrink constrainedly to form a well-aligned close-packed structure. The nanowire monolayer can be transferred to any hydrophilic substrates, including glass, mica sheet, PET, and silicon wafer, by dipping the substrates and pulling them out parallel to the liquid surface. The curve of the π–A isotherm exhibits intuitively that surface pressure varies with surface area of the KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer shown in Fig. 2b. Fig. 2c shows the SEM images of the KCu7S4 nanowires at different phases corresponding to I, II, and III, respectively. Initially (at surface pressure 0 mN m−1) KCu7S4 nanowires are sporadically floating on the liquid interface. When the surface pressure reaches 5 mN m−1 in phase I, the monolayer film becomes orientational though the spacing between the nanowires is large. Along with the surface pressure rising to 15 mN m−1 in phase II, the KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer becomes much denser. With further decrease of surface area, the surface pressure rises steeply to 25 mN m−1 and a close-packed KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer forms homogeneously over the interface. When the surface pressure value exceeds 25 mN m−1, some overlaps and folds could be observed parallel with the barrier sequentially (Fig. S2a†). These results indicate that the optimum condition to produce a well-aligned nanowire monolayer can be identified in phase III at about 25 mN m−1. KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer films are collected at three different surface pressures (5, 15, and 25 mN m−1) and transferred to PET and silicon wafer substrates. The corresponding devices are named PD1, PD2 and PD3, respectively. We quantitatively studied the copper contents per square centimeter of these films, and the results are shown in Fig. 2d. In comparison with the LB assembly technique, equivalent mass per square centimeter of PD3 disordered KCu7S4 nanowire film (PDD) is fabricated by a spray-assisted technique (Fig. S2b†).

(d) Copper contents per square centimeter of PD1, PD2 and PD3, corresponding to I, II and III, respectively. 

Fig. 3 depicts the photocurrent and time response of devices PD1, PD2 and PD3, respectively. All the devices show excellent photovoltaic characteristics upon NIR light illumination (980 nm, 295.3 μW cm−2) and their parameters are shown in Table S1.† It can be easily observed that the short-circuit current (ISC) increases gradually with the increase of surface pressure for assembly. The decreased transmittance of the KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer with the increase of the surface pressure for assembly (Fig. S3) may be attributed to two reasons: (1) higher intensity KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer will be obtained under higher surface pressure, which will facilitate the absorption of incident light and give rise to a larger number of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and (2) a larger effective junction area between Si and KCu7S4 will be formed with the increase of the nanowire intensity, which will also favour the separation, transportation and collection of the photo-generated carriers. On the other hand, the device PD3 remarkably outperforms its counterpart constituted of disordered KCu7S4 nanowires (PDD), verifying the perfect electrical transportation of the well-defined nanowire monolayer. To investigate the influence of PVP coated on the surface of nanowires, plasma treatment was employed to remove the PVP. No remarkable change in the conductivity of the KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer (PD3) can be observed before and after the plasma treatment (Fig. S4†), indicating that a tiny amount of the surfactant PVP deposited onto the surface of NWs should not degrade the device performance obviously.
 Fig. 3  (a) Typical current (I)–voltage (V) curves and (b) time response of different devices upon NIR light illumination (980 nm, 295.3 μW cm−2). 
The typical current (I)–voltage (V) curve of the device PD3 in the dark is shown in Fig. 4a, revealing an obvious rectifying behavior with a turn-on voltage of ∼1 V and a rectification ratio of about 120 at ±5 V. The diode ideality factor (n) is estimated to be about 5.6 according to the lnI–V curve (inset in Fig. 4a). This value is much larger than that of an ideal diode (n = 1), which may be attributed to the large tunneling current caused by the high conductivity of KCu7S4 nanowires (shown in Fig. S5†).28 Meanwhile, although no remarkable difference between the Ip and Id of the KCu7S4 nanowire can be observed when exposed to NIR light (980 nm, 295.3 μW cm−2) for the same reason, the Si/KCu7S4 heterojunction exhibits splendid photovoltaic characteristics with open-circuit voltage (VOC) 0.14 V, short-circuit current (ISC) 1.62 μA and fill factor (FF) 25% (Fig. 4b).

(b) The typical photovoltaic characterization of the KCu7S4/Si heterojunction when illuminated with 980 nm NIR light (295.3 μW cm−2). (c) The spectral response of the device in the range of 300–1100 nm. (d) The photoresponse of the device for 40 cycles and after 3 months of storage under ambient conditions. (e) The energy band diagram of the Si/KCu7S4 heterojunction upon illumination at zero bias. χ and Eg denote the electron affinity and the band gap of the corresponding materials marked in the subscripts, respectively. Ec, EF, Ev, and E0 are the conduction band minimum, Fermi energy level, valence band maximum, and vacuum energy level, respectively. 

Fig. 4c depicts the spectral response of the NIRPD over the wavelength range from 300 to 1100 nm (the light intensity was calibrated and kept constant during the spectral response analysis to make the data more reliable). It can be seen that the NIRPD shows a broadband spectral selectivity over a wide wavelength range from 600 to 1100 nm with peak sensitivity at around 850–1000 nm. Although it has a similar spectral response to the Si based MSM photodetectors,30 the KCu7S4/Si heterojunction surpasses the Au/Si Schottky junction in photovoltaic characteristics and the Ion/Ioff ratio at zero bias (shown in Fig. S6†). This may be ascribed to the larger built-in electric field of the KCu7S4/Si heterojunction, which greatly depressed the dark current and separated the photo-generated electron–hole pair more efficiently. Fig. 4d shows the time response of the NIRPD at zero bias as the incident light was repeatedly turned on and off. It can be easily observed that the as-fabricated device exhibits high reproducibility and good stability even after storing under ambient conditions for 3 months.
Ohmic contact between KCu7S4 and Au as well as Si and In:Ga can be observed in Fig. S5 and S7;† therefore the above photovoltaic characteristics can be understood by the energy band diagram of the Si/KCu7S4 heterojunction shown in Fig. 4e. A space charge region (also termed built-in electric field) with a direction from Si to KCu7S4 will be intermediately formed after the contact of the KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer and the Si wafer. When illuminated by incident light, the photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the space charge region will be separated by the electric field in opposite directions. The photo-generated electrons will move to the Si side while the photo-generated holes will diffuse into the KCu7S4 side, giving rise to a photocurrent in the external circuit. Therefore, although the existence of peaks in the energy band diagram hinders the effective transportation of the photo-generated carriers to some extent and leads to a relatively low power conversion efficiency (η) (0.01%), KCu7S4 contributes greatly to the high performance NIR photodetector. Furthermore, the controllable self-assembly of the semiconductor nanowire monolayer provides a simple and universal method for the fabrication of self-powered CMOS-compatible Si photodetectors.
Further analysis of the photoresponse characteristics of the NIR photodetectors under light illumination of different intensities is shown in Fig. 5a. It reveals that the photocurrent increases gradually with the increase of the light intensity from 1.12 to 295.3 μW cm−2. Moreover, the photocurrent (Ip) can be expressed by a simple power law: Ip ∝ P0.68, where P is the power of NIR illumination (Fig. 5b).31 The noninteger exponent may be attributed to the defect species from either the Si wafer or the KCu7S4 nanowires, which work as carrier traps. As the light intensity increases, an increasing number of traps are converted into recombination centres.32,33

(b) A fitting curve of the relationship between the photocurrent and the light intensity according to the power law. (c) The plots of responsivity and detectivity at zero bias as a function of light intensity. (d) The dark noise current of the device measured at different frequencies at zero bias. 
To further evaluate the current NIR photodetector quantitatively, other two key metrics, responsivity (R, defined as the photocurrent generated per unit of incident power) and specific detectivity (D*, normalized to the active detector area and the equivalent noise bandwidth) were calculated using the following equations:34    where Ip is the photocurrent, Id is the dark current, S is the effective heterojunction area (since the exact contact area of Si and KCu7S4 nanowires can hardly be measured, the effective area of the substrate Si used for transferring the KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer was used instead, which was about 1.5 cm2), Pin is the incident light power, and q is the electron charge (1.6 × 10−19 C). Fig. 5c shows plots of both R and D* of the Si/KCu7S4 NIR photodetector at different NIR intensities. The plots of responsivity and detectivity at zero bias as a function of incident light wavelength are shown in Fig. S8.† It is clear that the photoresponsivity decreases with increasing light intensity. This tendency is probably due to self-heating at higher light intensity, which will induce the increase of both charge carrier scattering and recombination possibility, leading to lower R and D*.35 To compare the performance of the present device with other reported Si-based devices, Table 1 summarizes several key metrics including R, D* and response speed. Although the Si/KCu7S4 NIR photodetector has a relatively lower R due to the high conductivity of KCu7S4, other parameters are comparable to or even higher than those of all other photodetectors made of not only planar Si36,37 but also Si NW arrays38,39 and black Si.40 Notably, the extraordinary high responsivity of the single Si nanowire device can be attributed to the higher carrier collection efficiency arising from the electrode separation comparable to the depletion width.30

Noise equivalent power (NEP) is another important figure of merit for photodetectors. It represents the minimum optical input power the device can distinguish from noise. It can be expressed as:41  where in is the noise current. To determine NEP values, the noise current was directly measured at various frequencies using a lock-in amplifier (SR830) in a dark room shielded with metal, presented in Fig. 5d. With the frequency increasing, the in decreases and reaches about 0.8 pA Hz−1/2, which is comparable to the reported solution-processed photodetectors, such as hybrid perovskite photodetectors.42 The NEP is then calculated to be 1.6 × 10−9 W at zero bias (800 Hz).
To further explore the feasibility of the present NIR photodetector for practical application in optical communication and switches, the photoresponse properties of pulsed NIR light were also examined using a laser diode driven by a signal generator to obtain the pulsed light and to sense the switching behaviour of the photocurrent (Fig. 6a). Fig. 6b–f depict the photoresponse of the NIR photodetector to pulsed light irradiation with switching frequencies of 1 Hz, 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz and 50 kHz, respectively. It can be seen that the PD could be readily switched between the off- and on-state with good reproducibility. Further relative balance as a function of varied frequency shows that the device has a slow relative balance [Imax − Imin/Imax] decay. As shown in Fig. 6g, the relative balance of the PD is still larger than 20% even though the frequency is as high as 100 kHz and the 3 dB-gain bandwidth can be deduced to be about 2 kHz, suggesting that the Si/KCu7S4 NIR photodetector can work properly over a wide switching frequency range, which is vitally important to monitor the ultrafast optical signal. Meanwhile, the response time (τr, defined as the duration needed for the photocurrent to increase from 10 to 90%) and the recovery time (τf, defined as the duration needed for the photocurrent to decrease from 90 to 10%)43 at a switching frequency of 50 kHz are estimated to be 7.4 and 8.6 μs, respectively (Fig. 6h). These values are much faster than for most of the other reported Si-based photodetectors with similar structures, as summarized in Table 1. The 3 dB-gain bandwidth and the fast response speed are considerably related to the small resistor–capacitor (RC) constant of the circuit and the capacitance is measured at 50 kHz and shown in Fig. 6i, which exhibits typical characteristics of a p–n junction: the capacitance is relatively smaller when reverse biased and larger when forward biased.42,44

Photocurrent mapping is further conducted on a home-built system shown in Fig. 7 to inspect the uniformity of the device. The light passes through a piece of opaque cardboard through a small hole. For better observation, 808 nm light (intensity about 12 mW cm−2) is used as the light source (size about 2 mm × 2 mm) instead of the invisible 980 nm light. Photocurrent mapping will be obtained by moving the device so that the incident light is focused on each of the 5 × 5 regions in sequence. It can be obviously observed that the regions have a relatively narrow photocurrent distribution around 2.4 μA, showing the good uniformity of the KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer, which greatly surpasses that of the disordered KCu7S4 nanowire film (Fig. S9†). Notably, the responsivity R of one region is calculated to be about 50 mA W−1, which is significantly higher than that of the whole device described above (15 mA W−1); therefore, the responsivity R is expected to increase significantly as the area of the pixels decreases (Si photodetectors, ∼0.01–1 mm2) after integration into a circuit for practical applications.45

Conclusions
A high performance self-powered Si/KCu7S4 NIR photodetector was easily fabricated by transferring LB assembled KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer to the surface of the Si wafer. The photodetector exhibits high sensitivity to 980 nm NIR light with responsivity (R) 15 mA W−1, detectivity (D*) 2.15 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1 and a fast response speed (response time τr 7.4 μs and recovery time τf 8.6 μs) at a switching frequency of 50 kHz, which presents a simple and universal method for the fabrication of low-cost and high-performance photodetectors and integrated optoelectronic sensor circuitry.
