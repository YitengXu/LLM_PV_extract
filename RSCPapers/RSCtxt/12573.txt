    , Accepted 20th December 2010First published on 27th January 2011AbstractTo improve the optoelectronic properties of iron oxide as a photoelectrode, hematite (α-Fe2O3) thin films were doped with titanium using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) for synthesis. The films were prepared by pyrolysis of Fe(CO)5 and TiCl4 precursors on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates and found to have a polycrystalline morphology with faceted particulates ∼20 to 50 nm in size with a preferred crystallographic growth along the [110] direction. The performance of the photoanodes was measured as a function of titanium concentration. A maximum efficiency was observed at ∼0.8 atom% Ti in hematite. The Incident Photon-to-current Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) to hydrogen was measured in alkaline electrolyte. Under an applied bias of 0.6 V vs.Ag/AgCl at 400 nm the IPCE for water splitting in alkaline solution was found to be 27.2%, the highest efficiency reported for Ti doped hematite photoanodes. The IPCEs of the photoanode thin films at lower applied bias were further increased by calcination at 500 °C and by use of glucose as an anolyte.

Broader context
Solar radiation is a clean and renewable energy source, a potential candidate to replace fossil fuels. Discovering an efficient and economical material system for direct conversion of solar energy into chemical energy is a major challenge for scientists and engineers. An ideal PEC material must meet the requirements on efficiency, cost, stability, and safety in PEC reactions. Hematite (α-Fe2O3) represents an abundant, non-toxic, and stable (in most electrolytes with pH > 3) material which has a proper band gap and sufficient overpotential for many electrochemical reactions. In this paper, we describe our latest research progress on the nanoarchitecturing of the structure and tuning of the electronic properties of hematite thin films for improvement in PEC water splitting.

Introduction
Photoelectrochemical production of hydrogen or any chemical product using sunlight has long been a goal of scientists and technologists. Although the basic theoretical issues are well understood and decades of research have explored hundreds of different potential materials, today there are no material systems which are even close to meeting basic technoeconomic criteria for producing any commercial chemical using artificial solar photoelectrochemistry. Metal oxide photoelectrocatalysts have long been of interest since the first report of hydrogen production on TiO2.1 Unfortunately, most of the inexpensive and stable metal oxides such as titania, ZnO,2,3 and WO34 have wide band gaps and are therefore limited in overall terrestrial solar energy efficiency to less than a few percent, and to date all attempts to increase their solar spectrum absorbance have been disappointing. Other wide gap metal oxides which have been synthesized as potential photoelectrochemical materials include: delafossites5 and oxynitrides, e.g.ZnO:GaN,6TiOxN7 and TaONx;8 however, these materials suffer from high electron–hole pair recombination rates. Copper(I) oxide9 has a band gap of approximately 2.1 eV and can thus absorb much more solar spectrum radiation; however, it has significant cathodic and anodic photocorrosion and has less than ideal electron/hole conduction.
Among the metal oxides, hematite (Fe2O3) has long been a tempting photocatalyst candidate primarily because it is abundant, non-toxic, and inexpensive. With a band gap of ∼2.1 eV, hematite can absorb approximately 40% of incident sunlight. There is sufficient overpotential for many electrochemical reactions and hematite is stable in most electrolytes (pH > 3). However, as a charge transfer-type Mott insulator hematite is fundamentally a poor electronic material with intrinsically low conductivity10,11 mediated by polarons12 which significantly limits the intrinsic quantum efficiency. Further, the energetics of electron/hole pairs produced in pure crystalline hematite is such that the conduction band edge is too low to drive hydrogen evolution without an additional bias. Finally, the surface of hematite in electrolytes is relatively inactive for oxygen evolution and an electrocatalyst is required to improve the kinetics of O2 evolution.13–15
Work to improve the electronic properties of iron oxide dates back more than 50 years. Morin11,16 studied the conduction mechanism in oxides which have partially filled d levels and he attempted to add impurities to increase conductivity. Substitutional doping of hematite has been reported by many groups attempting to improve electronic performance and both isovalent and heterovalent atoms have been used including Si,17–19Ti,11,18,20,21Pt,22Mo, Cr,23Al,13Zn24,25 and Ge.18 In general, dopants were found to significantly alter the electronic and physical properties of hematite.

Hematite, like many metal oxides, can be synthesized by many different methods including electrodeposition,22,23spray pyrolysis,26–29 sol–gel,30–34sputtering,20 and chemical vapor deposition.17,35–37 Unfortunately, independent of doping, the synthesis method and resulting morphologies of hematite are known to profoundly influence the electronic performance and it is difficult to interpret observed changes in performance. In a recent report, nanostructured Si doped hematite thin films prepared by APCVD17,35 using iron pentacarbonyl at an applied bias showed the highest reported efficiency (APCE = 42% at 370 nm at 1.23 V vs. RHE bias). The high efficiency was ascribed to the oriented growth of mesoporous hematite along the (110) direction and with a thin interfacial layer of SiO2 between FTO and iron oxide. Undoped hematite thin films grown by AACVD (aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition) resulted in needle like nanostructures oriented in the (110) direction and were characterized to have a photocurrent density of 600 µA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE bias under AM 1.5 illumination which is the highest photocurrent density among undoped hematite photoanodes.38

Hematite typically exhibits n-type indirect gap semiconducting behavior. The introduction of quadrivalent ions into trivalent iron sites provides additional n-type doping. According to Glasscock et al.,20Ti (5%) doped hematite prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering showed a better performance than the Si doped hematite thin films. The improvement of charge transfer at the surface and the possible surface passivation by Ti dopant were proposed for the enhanced photocurrent of Ti over Si. The co-doping of 1% isovalent Al with 5% Ti in hematite has been reported to result in a significant enhancement on the photocatalytic activity, leading to an IPCE of ∼25% at 400 nm at 0.7 V vs.NHE in 0.1 M NaOH.27 Hu et al.21 reported the synthesis of Ti (6%) doped hematite using co-electrodeposition from titanium isopropoxide peroxide species followed by calcinations which resulted in Ti doped hematite without specific crystallographic orientation. Further treatment with fluorine shifted the conduction band potential of the hematite providing an overall zero bias photocurrent with an overall hydrogen production efficiency without external bias of ∼0.06% and an IPCE of 1.8% at 400 nm.21
The previous work showed that Ti is an effective dopant and that hematite thin films with oriented growth and feature sizes comparable to the hole diffusion length facilitate the transfer of photo-generated charges onto the surface of the semiconductor which results in improved performance. Based on these previous works, we investigated the application of APCVD in the fabrication of hematite thin films with oriented crystallization and controlled Ti doping concentration. In this work we addressed the following questions: (a) Can thin film photoanodes of titanium doped hematite be synthesized by APCVD? (b) Is there a specific crystallographic orientation and microstructure? (c) What is the performance of the Ti:Fe2O3 thin films for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production as a function of Ti concentration? (d) What other synthesis and processing factors can be modified to optimize performance?
Experimental
Film preparation by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition

          Iron pentacarbonyl (Aldrich, 99.999%) and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4, Fluka) were used as precursors for hematite and the titanium dopant, which were supplied by bubbling nitrogen gas (99.9999%) through the liquid precursors with a typical flow rate of 40 mL min−1 for Fe(CO)5 and 10 mL min−1 for TiCl4 at 25 °C. These were controlled with mass flow controllers. The oxygen flow rate was 490 sccm and was mixed with the Fe(CO)5 and TiCl4 stream and directed vertically onto the hot FTO substrate (TEC 15, Pilkington glass, FTO) through a glass tube with an inner diameter of 5 mm positioned 10 mm above the substrate. All the connections and tubing with contact with the precursors are borosilicate glass. The fluorine-doped SnO2 substrates were cleaned with acetone/ethanol solution followed by rinsing with Milli-Q DI water and drying with nitrogen blow. The substrate was heated on a stainless steel block kept at 500 °C. The temperature of the FTO substrate on the heating block was measured by an infrared thermometer (Mode 42545, Extech Instruments Corp. MA, US) which monitored the temperature of the substrate during deposition. A typical sample was prepared with N2 flows through iron and titanium precursor of 40 and 10 sccm. For tuning of Ti concentration, the flow rate of carrier gas through TiCl4 bubbler was adjusted from 0 to 40 sccm with a constant iron carbonyl flow rate, 40 sccm, as shown in Table 1. Higher TiCl4 concentrations yielded brown photoelectrodes with a lower efficiency. The deposition took 1 minute during which a dark circular spot with a diameter of ∼1.5 cm formed on the FTO glass. After cooling in the air, the dark spot slowly turned red and showed concentric interference fringes.

For comparison, electrodeposited Ti:Fe2O3 thin films were prepared by cyclic voltammograms with a three-electrode configuration where a graphite rod, Ag/AgCl saturated by KCl, and Pt (150 nm)/Ti (50 nm) coated quartz were used as counter, reference, and working electrodes, respectively.21 The electrodeposition bath contained an aqueous solution of 5 mM FeCl3 + 5 mM KF + 0.1 M KCl + 1 M H2O2 + 0.32 mM Ti-isopropoxide. The applied voltage was between −0.49 and 0.41 V and the scan rate was 0.2 V s−1. After electrodeposition, the films were washed by DI water three times followed by calcination at 700 °C for 4 hours with a ramp of 2 °C min−1.

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) data from the thin film samples on FTO were collected using a Phillips PANalytical X'PERT powder diffractometer (Philips Analytical) using Cu-Kα (1.5405 Å) radiation and a position sensitive detector with sealed proportional counter and X'celerator PSD. The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Kratos “Axis Ultra” spectrometer using a monochromated Al-Kα source (1486.6 eV) for excitation and an eight-channel detector was used. The base pressure was 5 × 10−9 Torr, and the spectra were calibrated to C1s at 285.0 eV and processed with Casa XPS. The Ti/(Fe + Ti) ratio was determined from the XPS survey scan from the Fe2p and Ti2p photoelectron emission, after fitting a Shirley background and normalizing with Scofield sensitivity factors. UV-vis spectroscopy was conducted on a Shimadzu UV3600 UV-Nir-NIR Spectrometer with an integrating sphere under absorption mode.

          PEC characterizations
Photoelectrochemical characterization of the samples was performed using a high-throughput photoelectrochemical measurement system.23 In brief, the system includes a Pt counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a gas diffuser, and an optical Fiber sitting in a flat wall borosilicate tube inside the PEC testing cell. The photoelectrode contacts the electrolyte and illumination source through an O-ring with a geometric area of 0.24 cm2. Nitrogen gas was bubbled slowly through the electrolyte during the experiments to minimize the oxygen reduction at the counter electrode. The electrolyte is 1 M NaOH (pH 13.6) dissolved in Milli-Q water with or without 10 mM glucose. In the presence of the glucose experiment, a glass frit was used between the counter and working electrode. The counter electrode side was kept in 1 M NaOH solution as an electrolyte whereas the working electrode side used 10 mM glucose in 1 M NaOH solution as an electrolyte, which results in a small chemical bias which is not taken into account or corrected in the experiments. The illumination was provided by a 1000 W Ozone Free Xenon Lamp (Newport Corporation #6271) filtered through a water filter and a monochromator (Newport Corporation CS 260 ¼m), and finally focused to a fiber optic. For full spectrum visible light photoelectrochemical measurements, a 400 nm cut-off filter was used to remove the excess UV from the lamp source and a tilting mirror in the monochromator housing was used to precisely control the light intensity. For the IPCE measurements, a diffraction grating was used to give a ∼20 nm bandpass (FWHM) from 360 to 600 nm and diverse cut-off filters to eliminate second-harmonics. A radiometer (Thorlabs, S120UV/S121B detectors, calibrated for white light illumination) was used to measure the light intensities. The power densities are 400/100 mW cm−2 for white light (4 sun/1 sun) and ∼2 to 8 mW cm−2 for monochromatic light. The IPCE of the samples was calculated as follows: (1)
The photocurrent of the photoelectrodes was measured with an HP multimeter (HP 4210); the applied potential was performed with an EG&G 273A potentiostat in a three-electrode configuration. In the IV and chopped IV measurements, the applied bias was swept at 100 mV s−1 from −0.5 to 0.8 V vs.Ag/AgCl. The whole high-throughput screening system is controlled by custom program written in LabView (National Instruments).
Results and discussion
a. Structural properties and PEC performance of Ti:Fe2O3 thin film
The photoelectrodes deposited by pyrolysis of iron pentacarbonyl vapor and TiCl4 vapor in nitrogen carrier gas (40 sccm and 10 sccm, respectively), labeled as Sample 2 in Table 1, on FTO glass for 1 min were primarily faceted nanoparticles 20–50 nm in dimension, Fig. 1a and b, and approximately 700 nm thick as measured and are shown in cross-section by SEM, Fig. 1c.

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) of Sample 2 is shown in Fig. 2. The result is typical of the APCVD Ti doped hematite films which are all indexed to the hematite structure (space group: Rc, JCPDS reference pattern 00-001-1053). As expected the FTO substrate reflections are of high intensity. The diffraction intensity of (110) hematite plane is more than twice that of the (104) plane, whereas isotropic films show the (110) reflection as three-quarters of the (104) reflection. This is indicative of oriented growth along the [110] axis and is desirable because that is the axis along which the electron mobility is greatest in hematite.17

The XPS spectra of Sample 2 in Fig. 3a show the existence of doublet Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 with binding energies of 710.5 and 724.3 eV. The satellite peak at 718.4 eV is characteristic of α-Fe2O3.39Ti was observed by XPS in the doped films and the binding energy of the Ti 2p3/2 was 457.3 eV as shown in Fig. 3b. This is ∼1.0 eV lower than the binding energy of Ti4+ in TiO2, indicating the partial presence of Ti3+.40,41 The Ti/(Fe + Ti) atomic ratio at the surface was estimated from the XPS survey scan from the Fe 2p and Ti 2p photoelectron emission after fitting a Shirley background and normalizing with Scofield sensitivity factors. The Ti concentration in hematite of Sample 2 was 0.8 at% (atomic percent). The titanium concentration is dependent on the relative flow rates of the two precursors. In Table 1, the titanium concentration of samples prepared at different flow rates of TiCl4 is listed and the variations discussed in detail below.

The UV-vis spectra of the Ti:Fe2O3 are shown in Fig. 4a. The data are presented as a Tauc plot and fitted to functional forms for direct and indirect band gap transitions, Fig. 4b and c. The best fit was for a direct band gap with a value of ∼2.1 eV which is consistent with the band gap of electrodeposited Ti:Fe2O3,21 the literature value ranges from 1.9 to 2.2 eV depending on the preparation method and the pure phase hematite is generally considered to absorb by an indirect process.38

The cyclic voltammograms acquired from Sample 2 in 1 M NaOH (pH 13.6) during chopped illumination by a xenon lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter (see Experimental section for full details) are shown in Fig. 5a. The applied bias is swept at a rate of 100 mV s−1 from −0.5 to 0.8 V vs.Ag/AgCl. The onset potential for observed photocurrent is approximately −200 mV vs.Ag/AgCl. The current density under 100 mW cm−2 and 400 mW cm−2 illumination at 0.6 V vs.Ag/AgCl is approximately 1.2 and 5.3 mA cm−2 respectively. The measured IPCE at 400 nm is 27% at a bias of 0.6 V vs.Ag/AgCl, as shown in Fig. 5b, which is among the highest values reported for hematite photoelectrodes under equivalent conditions. The IPCE of the Ti doped hematite sample at the lower bias (6% at 0.4 V vs.Ag/AgCl) is relatively low which is associated with a large photocurrent onset potential (∼0.2 V). This suggests a high density of trap states located below the conduction band edge.42,43 Compared to the Si doped hematite films prepared by Kay et al.,17 our substrate temperature was considerably lower (300 °C vs. 500 °C) resulting in more trap state defects and less crystallographic orientation of the films. Further evidence of large concentrations of trap states was observed in time dependent behavior of the observed photocurrent under chopped illumination, Fig. 5a. At low applied bias (∼0 to 0.4 V), the current rise upon illumination includes a contribution representing the emptying (oxidation) of defects which will then be filled (reduced) upon discontinuation of illumination resulting in a discharge current.44 With the increase of the applied bias, the falling transients became rising transients where the photocurrent relaxed upward to a steady state.43 The falling transients have been attributed to the charging of electron acceptors including the “deep traps.”43,45,46 A relatively high photocurrent can only be achieved when sufficient bias (>0.4 V vs.Ag/AgCl in this case) is applied to completely ionize the trap states47 and diminishes the charge and discharge current as shown in the chopped voltammogram curves of the as-prepared thin film in Fig. 5a. The trap states are likely to arise from the unsaturated surface atoms and bulk defects, both of which could be diminished by calcination at a higher temperature. The high density of the trap states in the as-prepared Ti:Fe2O3 thin film might be due to the relatively low temperature of the FTO substrate during preparation which is approximately 300 °C from the reading of a commercial infrared thermometer. High temperature calcination can thus help reduce the trap states density by enhancing the crystallinity to lower the threshold potential for the photocurrent which will be discussed in detail below.

b. 
          Ti dopant concentration
The concentration of the Ti dopant on the surface of the sample was analyzed by XPS and found to vary with the flow rate of the carrier gas through the TiCl4 precursor as shown in Table 1. The relationship was non-linear which is not surprising due to variable saturation of the carrier gas and the complex gas phase kinetics of the pyrolysis process which forms aerosol clusters of iron oxide17 that subsequently coat the FTO substrate. The formation rates, cluster sizes, and Ti/Fe ratios of the aerosol clusters are all dependent on the relative concentrations of the two precursors as well as the oxygen concentration and temperature gradient between the nozzle and the substrate.

          SEM micrographs of the samples with varying concentrations of Ti are shown in Fig. 6a–e. The morphology of the undoped hematite thin film prepared under the same conditions as the doped samples consists of spherical clusters (0.5–2 µm) that are aggregates of fine nanoparticles (∼10 nm), Fig. 6a. This morphology is similar to that reported for Si doped hematite17 and to the pure hematite thin films reported by Saretni-Yarahmadi et al.36 The morphology of the Ti doped hematite samples is significantly different from the undoped and Si17 doped hematite films. The Ti doped hematite thin films (Fig. 6b–e) show wedge shaped aggregates consisting of small faceted nanoparticles. The faceted nanoparticles in the sample with 0.8% Ti are approximately 20–50 nm in size, Fig. 1 and 6b. The morphology of the sample with 2.4% Ti is similar to the sample with 1.4% Ti and is not shown. Both samples consist of plate-like nanoparticles ∼50 nm in size and ∼20 nm thick. At higher concentrations (∼7% Ti) the plate sizes increase ∼100 nm with thicknesses of ∼20 nm. The increased Ti concentration is expected to decrease the available surface area due to the larger plate structure sizes. The tendency to form larger particulates with increasing Ti concentration has previously been reported in hematite films prepared by sputtering20 and spray pyrolysis.27
 Fig. 6  (a–e) SEM images of Fe2O3 films grown by APCVD on FTO conducting glass with Ti% of 0, 0.8, 1.4, 7.2, and 34.9, respectively. (f) XRD pattern of the samples with Ti% ranged from 0 to 34.9; an oriented growth along (110) planes is observed in all the hematite samples. 
In all the APCVD deposited films we observed oriented growth along the (110) direction, as seen by the XRD patterns, Fig. 6f. Orientation of hematite thin films has been previously reported and attributed to the oriented attachment of small hematite particles and/or the directing effect of the FTO substrate.17,36 The diffraction intensity ratio of (110)/(104) of the samples 1–6 is shown in Table 1. Except for the highest Ti concentration and the undoped samples the ratio of the (110)/(104) orientations are the same. The approximate dimensions of the crystallites along the (110) direction calculated using the Scherrer equation were approximately 100–150 nm, Table 1. These values are only estimated due to the practical limits of application of the Scherrer equation. A diffraction peak at 43° was observed in samples with high Ti concentrations (7.2% and 34.9%) which matches the (400) diffraction of magnetite (space group: Fdm, JCPDS reference pattern 00-019-0629). This is consistent with the observed darker color of the two high Ti thin film samples. However, the other diffraction peaks of magnetite other than (400) are not obvious. This suggests a higher amount of Fe2+ with a high concentration of Ti which was attributed to the charge balance upon the substitution of tetravalent ions (Ti4+) in the lattice.16 No other iron oxide or titanium dioxide phases were observed by XRD which would indicate that if a secondary phase was formed it is in very small quantities or of amorphous character.
The photoelectrochemical performance of the thin film anodes with different Ti concentrations and morphologies was investigated by measuring and comparing their IPCEs. The samples were then calcined at 500 °C to investigate the calcination effect on their performance. In Fig. 7 the IPCE at 400 nm of “as-made” and “calcined” samples prepared with different Ti concentrations is shown and the results are listed in Table 1. Without the addition of Ti, the undoped hematite is essentially inactive even under bias. The poor performance of the undoped hematite is consistent with the intrinsically low electrical conductivity even though the sample has an oriented crystallization and a small feature size (∼10 nm) comparable with the hole diffusion length (∼3 nm). This result is consistent with previous reports.17 The introduction of Ti not only changes the morphologies, as has been previously reported by Glasscock et al.,20 but significantly improves the PEC performance of the hematite thin films. A Ti% of 0.8 results in an IPCE at 400 nm of 27% at 0.6 V vs.Ag/AgCl. A higher concentration of Ti doping, however, resulted in IPCEs of less than 15%. We attribute the relative low IPCE to the larger surface feature sizes (50–300 nm) and the increased concentration of narrow gap magnetite (Fig. 6f).20 The magnetite impurity can be diminished by post-synthesis calcination at 500 °C in the air. Fig. 8 shows the disappearance of the diffraction peak at 43° for samples with 7.2% Ti after calcination, which confirms the removal of the segregated magnetite phase from the sample.

The PEC performance of hematite thin films with different Ti% at a high applied bias (0.6 V) did not change significantly after 500 °C calcination, as illustrated in Fig. 7a. However, the IPCEs at low bias of many of the Ti:Fe2O3 samples were significantly improved after calcinations, Fig. 7b and c (except the sample containing 34.9% Ti). The PEC performance of the undoped hematite did not change significantly with calcination at any applied bias suggesting that the poor performance of this thin film is not related to its crystallization or non-intrinsic trap states. The improvement in the PEC performance of hematite thin films with different Ti doping levels after calcination confirms the speculation that the high onset potential (associated to the low photocurrent density at low bias) was related to the defect-induced “deep traps”. At high bias the recombination due to “deep traps” was compensated for and the net photocurrent density did not change significantly with calcination temperature. Alternatively, the performance might be affected by a decrease in surface area which might hinder hole transport. The performance of thin films with 34.9% Ti degrades after calcination over the entire range of applied biases. The data from these mixed oxides were difficult to interpret as they are likely to be heterogeneous and their complex structure–function relationships are dependent upon poorly defined quantities of Ti within the lattice, at titanium rich grain boundaries, and/or contained in amorphous Ti–Fe oxide surface layers covering the crystallites.
Although the highest IPCE we observed was in samples containing 0.8% Ti the range of dopants through 7.2% Ti all showed improved properties. This is consistent with previous work reporting improvements with doping concentration of 5%20 and 6%.21 The difference between the samples is in the feature sizes, trap state density, and possibly the electron mobility. We assume that, at 0.6 V (Ag/AgCl), all the trap states have been ionized and will not affect the photocurrent; the highest IPCE of the 0.8% sample can be mainly attributed to its small feature size and therefore to a higher surface area. The performance of the Ti doped hematite thin films is dependent on both the doping levels and the structural properties such as crystallographic orientation, feature sizes, and trap state densities. A relative higher temperature is preferred for the deposition of Ti doped hematite for a better crystallization and lower trap state density. An optimized amount of Ti in the sample enhances the electric conductivity of the hematite, controls the feature sizes, and limits the induced trap state density in the lattice. The accurate control over doping concentration of Ti at a higher temperature for hematite thin films deposition is thus worthy of further investigation.

          Calcination, surface modification, and glucose electrolyte
The calcination effect on the performance of Ti doped hematite was specifically investigated on Sample 2 with 0.8 at% of Ti. As shown in the voltammogram curve for Sample 2 after 500 °C post-synthesis calcination in the air (Fig. 9a), the onset potential was shifted from 200 mV to −75 mV (Ag/AgCl) with a much higher net photocurrent at the same applied bias (<0.5 V). The trap state discharge/charge current was also lowered from a maximum of −0.45 mA cm−2 (as-deposited sample) to −0.15 mA cm−2 (calcined sample), Fig. 9b. The chopped voltammogram curve of the as-deposited sample shows sharp falling transients peaking in intensity at 0.35 V (Ag/AgCl). After calcination, the falling transients become blunt and turn to rising transients at 0.0 V and shift even more cathodically to −0.1 V vs.Ag/AgCl with further treatment of CoF3 solution.21 This suggests that calcination decreased the density of the trap states and reduced the intensity of electron/hole recombination, resulting in an enhancement of photocurrent at low bias, Fig. 9a. The photocurrent at 0.6 V vs.Ag/AgCl after calcination, however, becomes lower than the as-deposited sample which is probably due to the sintering of some smaller surface particles and the decrease of surface roughness.

(b) Chopped photocurrent of Sample 2 as-made, calcined and calcined with CoF3 treatment under applied bias vs.Ag/AgCl. 
Further treatment of the thin film using saturated CoF3 solution improves the performance of the thin films by a further cathodic shift of the onset potential of the photocurrent, Fig. 9b. The F− treatment on Ti:Fe2O3 thin films was reported to facilitate the evolution of hydrogen under low bias as reported by Hu et al.21 A photocurrent of ∼150 µA cm−2 was measured at zero bias (two-electrode configuration) after surface modification. The IPCE of the Sample 2 thin film at 400 nm is increased by a factor of 3 at 0.4 V vs.Ag/AgCl after calcination and surface modification, and is ∼30% higher than Ti doped Fe2O3 samples prepared by electrodeposition methods as described by Hu et al.21 (Fig. 10). The higher activity of the Ti doped hematite thin films prepared by APCVD relative to the sample prepared by electrodeposition following Hu's21 procedure can be ascribed to the smaller feature sizes and preferred crystallographic orientation growth along the [110] as has been seen for the Si doped Fe2O3.17

The IPCE of the samples as a function of wavelengths was measured under an applied bias of (a) 0.2 V vs.Ag/AgCl and (b) 0.4 V vs.Ag/AgCl. 
The slow rate of oxygen evolution upon water oxidation limits the efficiency of solar energy conversion as previously discussed.14,48Glucose molecules can be oxidized easier than water and therefore facilitate the charge transfer on the interface between the photoanode and electrolyte leading to a higher solar energy conversion efficiency. Glucose oxidation on the photoanode could potentially mimic the response of hematite under less OER (oxygen evolution reaction) kinetic limitations. With the presence of 10 mM glucose in 1 M NaOH, a higher photocurrent and a more negative onset potential was observed, Fig. 9a, which corresponds to a higher IPCE, Fig. 10. Under the applied bias of 0.2 V and 0.4 V (Ag/AgCl), the IPCE (at 400 nm) of Sample 2 after calcination and surface modification reached 12.5% and 19.3%, respectively, and further improved to 15.7% and 21.2% with the presence of glucose. This observation suggests that additional gains in water splitting efficiency are still possible upon usage of efficient electrocatalysts and that there is still space in the further improvement of the APCVD method for Ti doped hematite photoanodes. It can also be seen that at 0.4 V vs.Ag/AgCl the performance of the Sample 2 in 1 M NaOH and 1 M NaOH + 10 mM glucose (Fig. 10b) only increases slightly which would suggest that the increased applied potential compensating for the poor OER performance of the sample does not provide additional gains for glucose oxidation, and that at this point the sample is not hindered by kinetics but rather high recombination rates since the generation of electron–hole pairs in the samples should not be a problem (see eqn (2)). (2)
Conclusions
Photoelectrochemically active Ti doped hematite thin films were synthesized by APCVD and the Ti concentration controlled by varying the precursor delivery rate. All APCVD deposited films exhibited oriented crystallization; however, the presence of Ti significantly altered the microcrystalline structure. Whereas undoped hematite thin films show almost no photoelectrochemical activity under illumination, introduction of less than 1% of Ti significantly improves the observed conversion efficiency. An IPCE of 27% at 400 nm under 0.6 V vs.Ag/AgCl was achieved with Ti% of 0.8. The performance showed a broad maximum and further increase in the Ti concentration results in an increase of feature particle sizes and a decrease in IPCE. Calcination of the film at 500 °C in the air decreased the trap state densities of Ti doped hematite, lowered the onset potential of the photocurrents, and thus enhanced the IPCE of the samples at low bias. Using glucose as a more readily oxidized anolyte and surface modification by F−, an improved PEC performance was observed at a lower applied bias.

Broader context
Solar radiation is a clean and renewable energy source, a potential candidate to replace fossil fuels. Discovering an efficient and economical material system for direct conversion of solar energy into chemical energy is a major challenge for scientists and engineers. An ideal PEC material must meet the requirements on efficiency, cost, stability, and safety in PEC reactions. Hematite (α-Fe2O3) represents an abundant, non-toxic, and stable (in most electrolytes with pH > 3) material which has a proper band gap and sufficient overpotential for many electrochemical reactions. In this paper, we describe our latest research progress on the nanoarchitecturing of the structure and tuning of the electronic properties of hematite thin films for improvement in PEC water splitting.
