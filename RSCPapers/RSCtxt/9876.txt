    , Accepted 17th May 2023First published on 24th May 2023AbstractDeveloping efficient photoanodes with higher charge separation and light harvesting ability remains a crucial challenge. For this purpose, we have used a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electron-conducting scaffold to improve the charge transfer properties in the ternary transition metal chalcogenide Cu2WS4 (i.e., CWS). The photoluminescence (PL) studies reveal a weakened intensity of the PL band in CWS-rGO compared to CWS. In addition, fluorescence decay suggests an average lifetime of 1.6 ns and 1.16 ns for the CWS and CWS-rGO composite, respectively. The improved performance of the binary composite may be attributable to the remarkable electron transfer characteristics of the highly conductive rGO that facilitate the easy transport and more extended separation of charge carriers. Furthermore, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements confirm the improved charge separation. The CWS-rGO composite exhibits a higher photocurrent density of 1.18 mA cm−2, while the bare CWS was around 0.45 mA cm−2 at 1.98 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, a higher applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE), a better transient photocurrent response, and a lower charge transfer resistance in the binary composite confirm the results obtained from the linear sweep voltammetry plots. This work demonstrates that incorporating rGO in CWS is an efficient approach towards accelerating the separation of charge carriers and achieving a better PEC performance of the CWS photoelectrode.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an environmentally benign and scalable approach for converting solar energy to meet the increasing energy demands. Significant efforts have been devoted to fabricating low-cost, highly active, and stable solar-conversion photoanodes.1 Transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials such as WS2, WSe2, and MoS2 are known to be suitable Pt substitutes for PEC applications due to the cost-effective, environment-friendly, and intrinsic activity of the S or Se atoms on the edge sites.2,3 But the activity of these TMDs in the present form has room for efficiency improvement due to the inadequate electron transfer ability of these chalcogenides in the non-active basal plane.4,5 Cu2WS4 (CWS) is a layered ternary transition metal sulfide with a narrow band gap and excellent electrical conductivity, making it a promising candidate for electrocatalytic and visible-light-driven photocatalytic applications.6–8 CWS was first synthesized using a low-temperature route by Pruss et al. in 1993.7 Such ternary transition metal compounds are of great interest because of their appropriate optical and electrical properties. Many efforts have been devoted to examining the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution for this catalyst. However, not much has been explored in terms of photoelectrochemical studies. Jia and group have reported the catalytic properties of CWS for reducing aqueous Cr(VI).9 Jing and group have used CWS for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution applications.10 Peng et al. have reported the fabrication of CWS/NiTiO3 for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and pollutant degradation.11 Li et al. have reported that the photocatalytic activity of CWS decahedra can be tailored by changing the ratio of (001)/(101) exposed facets. According to reports, the valence band and conduction band edge locations of CWS are around 1.71 eV and −0.47 eV, respectively. Nevertheless, the photoinduced oxidation and reduction reaction sites for CWS are in the (101) and (001) facets, where the reduction is quick while the oxidation process is delayed. When the photogenerated holes are consumed more slowly, (101) accumulates holes, which causes corrosion and reduced photocatalytic activity.12,13 To lower the corrosion and improve the charge separation in CWS, an effective route is the addition of electron-conducting scaffolds, which will improve the photoelectrochemical performance of CWS. Among the electron conducting scaffolds, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has gained significant attention due to its distinctive properties, such as low-cost, large surface area, adequate mobility of charge carrier, and remarkable electrical and mechanical properties, which help in better collection and transport of electrons.14–16 rGO sheets have been known for their electron-accepting tendency that can be used to enhance the electron transporting properties of materials.17 rGO possesses sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, which tend to act as electron sinks and collectors from the semiconductor's surface, which makes rGO a suitable candidate for improving charge separation in semiconductors.18 For instance, coupling Cu2MoS4 hollow nanotubes with rGO sheets has proven to be an effective way to enhance the photocatalytic activity of the Cu2MoS4 photocatalyst.19 Wang et al. have coupled CuO/TiO2 with graphene for photocatalytic H2 evolution applications.20 Ojha et al. have investigated the photophysical properties of CdS supraparticles embedded on graphene sheets that give a much faster photocatalytic dye degradation when compared to bare CdS. The efficient charge separation achieved in the CdS-graphene composite was confirmed by the ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopic studies that suggest slower bleach recovery in the binary composite.21
In this study, we have designed a nanocomposite by coupling CWS with rGO, which has been used as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical water-splitting applications. This extends the lifetime of charge carriers in CWS and provides a better photoelectrochemical performance. The interactions in the excited state and the lifetime of charge carriers have been investigated using photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) studies. The enhanced separation of charge carriers has also been reflected in the photoelectrochemical studies of the samples.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Cuprous chloride (99%, Fischer scientific), sodium tungstate (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%), thioacetamide (Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd), graphite (>99.5%, CDH), KMnO4 (99.0%, Rankem) and Nafion (5% w/w in water and isopropanol, Alfa Aesar) was used in their original condition for the synthesis.
2.2. Synthesis of CWS and CWS-rGO
The synthesis of CWS was carried out by adding 0.01 mol CuCl, 0.005 mol Na2WO4.2H2O, and 0.025 mol of thioacetamide in 1:1 ethanol and water. The above mixture was stirred magnetically for 2 h and then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave having a capacity of 100 mL and heated at 180 °C for 15 h.22 The brick red precipitate thus obtained was washed with ethanol and water several times and dried at 60 °C in the oven overnight.
For the synthesis of CWS-rGO, 5 mg of the rGO prepared using the modified Hummers’ method (given in ESI†)23 was added along with 0.01 mol CuCl, 0.005 mol Na2WO4.2H2O and 0.025 mol thioacetamide. All the other steps for synthesis were the same as described above.
2.3. Preparation of photoelectrodes
For the fabrication of photoelectrodes, glass substrates coated with indium tin oxide (ITO) (15–20 Ω sq−1) were first cut into 1 × 1.5 cm2 pieces and then ultrasonically cleaned with a mixture of water and ethanol. Contact between ITO and the copper wires was made with silver paste. The contact was covered with epoxy (Araldite) to avoid interaction with the electrolyte. 2 mg of the sample was dispersed in a mixture of ethanol, double distilled water, and Nafion in a ratio of 3:1:1 and ultrasonicated to form a uniform ink. The above ink was then dropped onto the prepared photoelectrodes (1 × 1 cm2 area) and air dried.
2.4. Characterization techniques
The structural aspects and purity of the samples were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer and CuKα radiation, λ = 0.154178 nm, within a 2-theta range 10–60°. The surface morphology and elemental mapping of the samples were examined by FEI Quanta 200 FESEM, and furthermore the nanocomposite was studied using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (Technai G2 20, 200 kV). Raman data were collected from a Renishaw Micro Raman Spectrometer with a 514 nm laser. The absorbance and steady-state photoluminescence spectra were recorded using a UV-2450 spectrophotometer, Shimadzu Japan, and Edinburgh Instruments FLSP920 spectrophotometer, respectively. The lifetime measurements of the samples were recorded using a FluoTime 300, Picoquant spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm.

2.4.1. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements. 
All photoelectrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature using the Autolab PGSTAT204 workstation. The illumination source was a Xe arc lamp (300 W) under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation with a power density of 100 mA cm−2. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a three-electrode configuration in a single-chamber Teflon cell with a quartz window and ITO-coated glass as the working electrode, calomel (3.5 M KCl) as the reference, and Pt wire as the counter electrode. 0.1 M KOH (pH = 12.5) was used as the electrolyte solution for the measurements. Linear sweep voltammetry measurements were performed under dark and illuminated conditions in the potential range of 0–1 V against the calomel electrode (3.5 M KCl) with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were performed at 350 mV w.r.t a calomel electrode. Mott–Schottky measurements were performed in the dark at a frequency of 1 kHz. Transient photocurrent response (TPR) measurements were performed under continuous light illumination for 450 s with ON/OFF cycles of 30 s. The Nernst equation was used for the conversion of potential to RHE.24 ERHE = Ecalomel + Eapp + 0.0591pH(1)where Eapp is the applied potential and Ecalomel = 0.25 V.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and morphological investigations

Fig. 1a and b show the powder X-ray diffraction patterns for both CWS and CWS-rGO, which show peaks corresponding to the body-centered tetragonal phase of Cu2WS4 with I2m space group (JCPDS No. 01-074-3742). No characteristic peak of rGO can be observed in Fig. 1b, which may be due to the lower content of rGO or the intense reflections of CWS due to higher crystallinity. It has been reported that the regular stacking of graphene oxide gets destroyed by the reduction process under solvothermal conditions and thus cannot be resolved by XRD.25
 Fig. 1  Powder X-Ray diffraction pattern of (a) CWS (pink), and (b) CWS-rGO (blue). 
The powder XRD pattern for pure rGO is given in the ESI† (Fig. S1), which shows broad peaks around 26.40° and 43.21° corresponding to the (002) and (001) plane of rGO reported earlier.26 Fig. S2 (ESI†) represents the Raman spectra of CWS-rGO where the presence of the D and G bands at 1350 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1, respectively, gives evidence for rGO present in the CWS-rGO composite. In addition to this, one band around 1450 cm−1 has also been observed, which corresponds to the D′′ band reported around 1450–1500 cm−1 related to disorder in graphene-based materials.27
The morphology of the as-prepared samples was examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) as shown in Fig. 2(a–d). Fig. 2a and b show the FESEM images for CWS taken at two different magnifications, which reveal a nanosheet-like morphology with a smooth surface. Fig. 2(c) and (d) show the FESEM images for the CWS-rGO nanocomposite at two different magnifications. It can be observed from these images that the surface of CWS is retained; along with this, the CWS nanosheets are covered with a bundle of rGO sheets, confirming the formation of a binary composite. The CWS nanosheets possess a thickness of around 250 nm and a length of around 1–1.5 μm.

To complement the FESEM results, the surface morphology and microstructure of CWS-rGO were further examined using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), as shown in Fig. 3a and b. The TEM images suggest the presence of rGO sheets along with sheet-like CWS particles with an average size of 1 μm. Additionally, some rGO sheet deposition over CWS particles can also be observed from the TEM images. The HRTEM image reveals lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.38 nm corresponding to the (110) plane of CWS. The TEM image for pure CWS is given in the ESI† (Fig. S3) for comparison. The chemical composition of the binary composite has been determined using the FESEM-EDX technique. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the EDX spectrum of the binary composite confirming the presence of Cu, W, S, O and C. Furthermore, the atomic percent (Table S1, ESI†) of the binary composite reveals that it consists of 6.2%, 3.1%, 9.5%, 34.8%, and 46.4% of Cu, W, S, C, and O, respectively. Thus, this suggests that the atomic ratio of Cu:W:S is nearly 2:1:3.1. Fig. 4a–e shows the FESEM elemental mapping for the CWS-rGO composite, which shows the uniform distribution of Cu, W, and S over the CWS nanoparticles. The presence of C and O suggests the existence of rGO sheets in the binary composite.

3.2. Mechanism of charge-transfer processes
The possible mechanism of charge transfer in the binary composite has been demonstrated in Scheme 1. When the CWS-rGO composite is exposed to visible light, CWS can quickly produce electron–hole pairs in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. The valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of CWS are located at −6.21 eV and −4.03 eV, respectively, while the Fermi level of rGO is located at −4.72 eV, as reported earlier.13,28 The formation of the CWS-rGO composite leads to the migration of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of CWS to the rGO sheets. The rGO sheets can efficiently transfer electrons from CWS to the counter electrode through an external circuit, and thus, this leads to the water reduction reactions to produce hydrogen. While the photoinduced holes located in the VB of CWS are scavenged by the electrolyte solution, where they drive water oxidation.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the charge transfer mechanism in CWS-rGO. 
rGO plays the role of electron acceptor and mediator that can adequately collect electrons from CWS and instantly transfer them to the counter electrode due to delocalized electrons in its carbon network.14 Generally, a Schottky barrier is formed between the metal and a semiconductor if the work function of the metal is greater than that of the semiconductor. To lower the electron–hole recombination caused by the Schottky barrier, the metal under illumination can collect the photogenerated electrons from the CB of the semiconductor. For instance, the work function of rGO is larger than that of CWS. When rGO is combined with CWS, a Schottky barrier is formed at the interface of CWS and rGO, which helps transfer the photogenerated electrons from the CB of CWS to rGO. The Schottky barrier between rGO and CWS would reduce the electron–hole recombination by effectively prohibiting the electrons from moving backward from rGO to CWS. The electrons transferred from CWS to rGO will be immediately transferred to the substrate to establish an external circuit because of the extraordinarily high charge carrier mobility in rGO.19,29,30 Thus, the formation of the Schottky barrier plays a vital role in lowering the recombination of the charge carriers in the CWS-rGO composite and hence deciding the overall photoelectrochemical performance of the material.
3.3. Spectroscopic investigations

Fig. 5a shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of CWS and the binary composite recorded in the range of 400-750 nm. It can be observed from the UV-Vis spectra that CWS exhibits a stronger and broad absorption at higher energies that shows high optical absorption from the UV to visible region.31
 Fig. 5  Spectroscopic studies showing (a) UV-Visible spectra and (b) Tauc plot of CWS and CWS-rGO. 

Fig. 5b shows the band gap (Eg) determined using the Tauc formula as given below:32 (αhν)1/n = A(hν − Eg)(2)Here, α is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of light and A is a constant. Here, the value of n depends on the type of semiconductor used i.e., a direct band gap (n = 1/2) or an indirect band gap semiconductor (n = 2).33 CWS is a direct band gap semiconductor, and thus the value of n is 1/2. The estimated band gaps for CWS and CWS-rGO were found to be 2.23 eV and 2.30 eV, respectively. The increase in band gap with the formation of a binary composite indicates interaction amongst its combining entities, which may lead to a better charge transfer and altered electronic states.34 For instance, Roy‘s group have reported that the loading of a higher weight percent of TiO2 on Polypyrrole (Ppy) changes the band gap from 3.61 eV to 3.69 eV due to the aggregation of TiO2 at the Ppy matrix. This molecular aggregation hinders the charge carrier motion and thus appears as an increased band gap in the TiO2-Ppy composite.35 Thus, it is clear from the optical band gaps that these materials are promising candidates for future energy conversion and storage applications.
The charge transfer and recombination processes can be revealed by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the sample, where a weaker intensity indicates a lower probability of recombination. The PL spectra shown in Fig. 6 depict a broad emission band centered around 522 nm for CWS and CWS-rGO at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm. The addition of rGO to CWS significantly lowers the intensity of the emission band indicating a faster transfer of photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of CWS to rGO sheets, which has also been supported by the PEC studies. Furthermore, this quenching of the PL intensity with the incorporation of rGO suggests a low recombination of charge carriers in the binary composite compared to CWS.
 Fig. 6  Photoluminescence spectra of (a) CWS and (b) CWS-rGO at excitation wavelength 400 nm. 
The charge transfer process between CWS and rGO has been understood using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) studies (Fig. 7). The photoluminescence decay curve for CWS (Fig. 7a) can be fitted multi-exponentially with time constants τ1 = 7.03 ns (5.1%), τ2 = 3.45 ns (30.4%) and τ3 = 0.32 ns (64.5%) giving τavg = 1.60 ns. Similarly, the photoluminescence decay curve for CWS-rGO (Fig. 7b) can be fitted multi-exponentially with time constants τ1 = 7.32 ns (3.97%), τ2 = 3.38 ns (19.71%) and τ3 = 0.28 ns (76.50%) giving τavg = 1.16 ns. The comparison of the two samples suggests that a faster decay has been observed in CWS-rGO, which may be due to the transfer of electrons from the CB of CWS to rGO, which is a thermodynamically favorable process. This suggests that the electron–hole recombination is effectively suppressed in the binary composite.36,37 This type of reduction in the average lifetime has also been reported for Bi2S3 with the inclusion of rGO sheets where the average lifetime is reduced from 0.541 to 0.131 ns and has been dedicated to the faster deactivation of excited electrons in Bi2S3.28 Che's group have also reported that the formation of a Cu2WS4/YC/g-C3N4 heterojunction gives a shorter average lifetime of 2.24 ns compared to single g-C3N4 that has an average lifetime of 3.39 ns.13

3.4. Photoelectrochemical studies
The effect of rGO incorporation in CWS has been observed by the photoelectrochemical studies. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements are shown in Fig. 8a, and a comparison of the current densities and photocurrent densities has been provided in Table S2 (ESI†) and Table 1, respectively. The comparison has been done at 1.23 V and 1.98 V vs. RHE. The LSV curves show a linear rise in the photocurrent densities with the increase in the anodic potential; thus suggesting a typical n-type semiconductor behavior in both samples.38

The values for onset potential have been obtained using a linear sweep voltammetry curve, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The onset potential observed for CWS in illuminated conditions was 1.59 V while that for CWS-rGO was 1.54 V vs. RHE, respectively. Compared to CWS, the binary composite exhibits a cathodic shift of 50 mV. This suggests the presence of an internal electric field formed at the interface of CWS and rGO that promotes the interfacial charge transfer. Thus, the binary composite with a lower onset potential is expected to provide a reduced kinetic energy barrier compared to pristine CWS for charge transfer across the interface.39
The pristine CWS produces a low photocurrent density of 0.0106 mA cm−2 and 0.4555 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and 1.98 V vs. RHE due to the faster recombination of charge carriers. To see the effect of rGO, the photocurrent density for the binary composite has been measured. A gradual increase in the photocurrent density has been observed, and it was found to be around 0.0169 mA cm−2 and 1.1789 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and 1.98 V vs. RHE, respectively. Thus, the rGO-incorporated CWS exhibits nearly 1.6-fold and 2.6-fold enhancement in photocurrent density at 1.23 V and 1.98 V vs. RHE, respectively. The improved photocurrent density with the addition of rGO has been attributed to the unique two-dimensional π-conjugation in rGO, leading to the rapid collection and transportation of electrons. The superior photocurrent response in the binary composite implies a lower recombination rate and higher separation of photoinduced charge carriers.
This means that in addition to forming a heterojunction with CWS, rGO also acts as an effective mediator for electron shuttling, producing a better charge transfer. Thus, adding rGO to CWS facilitates a significant improvement in the photocurrent density that can be dedicated to the better charge separation achieved in the binary composite.

Applied bias to photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) shown in Fig. 8b has been calculated from the corresponding I–V curves at 1.0 V and 1.1 V (Table 3) by the following equation24 (3)Here, I refers to the photocurrent density observed at an applied potential Vapplied, 1.23 V corresponds to the standard reversible potential for water splitting and the power density of the light source is PL (which is 100 mW cm−2).46,47 ABPE can be calculated using the LSV curves as shown in Fig. 8a. The ABPE values calculated at 1.0 V vs. RHE were 0.0003% and 0.0005% for CWS and CWS-rGO, respectively. While the values calculated at 1.1 V vs. RHE for CWS and CWS-rGO were 0.0006% and 0.001%, respectively. Thus, the enhancement in ABPE at 1.0 V and 1.1 V vs. RHE was nearly 1.7-fold at both of the potential values. This further confirms the prolonged separation of photogenerated charge carriers leading to a better PEC performance. These results agree well with those observed from the photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence studies.

The electron transfer ability can be further evaluated with the help of the transient photocurrent response and EIS technique. The stability of the photoanodes can also be analyzed using the TPR measurement (Fig. 9) performed for seven intermittent on-off cycles under illumination for both CWS and the binary composite at 1.8 V vs. RHE. The sharp photocurrent changes in each sample during the ON/OFF cycles display the sensitivity and response of the CWS and binary composite to light. It can be clearly seen from the TPR response that the binary composite exhibits a higher TPR intensity compared to pure CWS, which indicates a higher charge separation and migration in the binary composite. In the case of pristine CWS, the current density is lower, and its maximum value is ∼0.30 mA cm−2 under illumination, whereas the current density for the rGO modified CWS under illumination is 0.84 mA cm−2, which is a nearly 2.8-fold increase at 1.8 V vs. RHE. The remarkable enhancement in the current density with the addition of rGO is believed to originate due to the better suppression of recombination of charge carriers by rGO in CWS. The value of current density observed in the TPR response is comparable to that observed in LSV curves at 1.8 V vs. RHE.

Fig. 10a compares the Nyquist plot for CWS and the binary composite in dark and illuminated conditions. The equivalent circuit obtained by fitting the Nyquist plot is given in the inset of Fig. 10a, and the comparison of the parameters obtained from the fit is given in Table 4. Here Rs, RCT, and CPE correspond to series resistance, charge transfer resistance, and constant phase element, respectively. Rs results from adding the ohmic resistances of the cell's components to the electrolyte resistance. The semicircle diameter in the higher frequency region in EIS corresponds to RCT. CPE usually refers to a non-ideal frequency-dependent capacitance produced by the non-uniform distribution of current by material heterogeneity.48 The lower Rs values in the CWS-rGO composite reveal a better electronic and ionic conduction achieved in the binary composite. At the same time, the lower value of RCT in the case of the binary composite suggests a lower resistance and a better interfacial charge migration with the introduction of rGO. The superior electrical conductivity of the binary composite could be due to the strong interfacial interaction between CWS and rGO compared to bare CWS.49 The RCT becomes further smaller on illumination, suggesting enhanced reaction kinetics by photoexcitation leading to effective charge transfer. Thus, the high work function and superior conductivity of the graphene nanosheets reduce the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers to a significant extent and favor the transport of charges to the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.50

The effect of charge carrier density on the photoelectrochemical performance has been assessed using Mott–Schottky (MS) plots, as given in Fig. 10b. The flat band potential (VFB) and donor density (Nd) have been obtained from the Mott–Schottky plots by using the following eqn (4) and (5) given below51 (4) (5)here, e0 denotes the electron charge and ε0 the vacuum permittivity, ε represents the dielectric constant, Nd is the donor density, V corresponds to the applied electrode potential, and kT/e0 is the temperature-dependent correction term. A positive slope obtained for the pristine CWS and binary composite indicates n-type carrier conductivity. The flat band potential that can be obtained from the x-intercept of the MS plot has an essential role in determining the direction of electron flow. The VFB obtained for CWS and CWS-rGO was −0.02 and −0.10 V vs. RHE, respectively. The negative shift in the flat band potential of the binary composite in comparison to the bare CWS is in accordance with the cathodic shift observed in LSV studies. This is probably due to the shift in the Fermi level of CWS with the incorporation of rGO, which promotes the transfer of interfacial electrons in the CWS-rGO composite, thus improving the PEC performance. The donor densities calculated from the slopes of the Mott–Schottky plot for CWS and the binary composite were 1.39 × 1022 cm−3 and 1.79 × 1023 cm−3, respectively. A higher donor density generates a large built-in potential after the formation of a CWS-rGO and thus corresponds to higher charge injection and separation owing to an efficient transfer of charge between CWS and rGO. These results indicate that incorporating rGO with CWS leads to efficient photoinduced charge carrier separation and better photoelectrochemical water splitting efficiency.
4. Conclusions
The composite CWS-rGO photoanode was designed to improve the charge carrier separation and the photoelectrochemical performance of CWS. The weakened PL intensity of CWS with the incorporation of rGO shows the effective inhibition of the recombination of charge carriers. Moreover, the shorter average lifetime of the CWS-rGO composite obtained from the time-resolved fluorescence decay also reveals a superior charge separation and migration compared to bare CWS nanosheets. The electron transfer property was further evaluated by photoelectrochemical measurements, suggesting a higher photocurrent density of 1.18 mA cm−2 in the composite case. In addition, a better transient photocurrent response and smaller EIS radius of CWS-rGO corroborate the results obtained from PL and TRPL studies. Thus, adding an electron-conducting scaffold to CWS improves the charge transfer properties and shows a better photoelectrochemical performance.
