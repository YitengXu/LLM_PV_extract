    , Accepted 6th May 2020First published on 8th May 2020AbstractA series of POM-based dyes with a triphenylamine electron donor group, cyanoacrylic acid electron acceptor group and different π linkers of thiophene derivatives were systematically investigated to analyze the influence of a rigidified bithiophene with fastening atoms (C and N) on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations. The interfacial electron transfer (IET) processes were evaluated, which have not been significantly investigated previously. We can see that the electrons in dyes 2, 4 and 5 are almost completely injected after 100 fs, thus leading to fast IET. Dye 2 not only has a lower interaction energy for the most stable dimer configuration compared to dye 1, but also has a larger short-circuit photocurrent density, JSC, and open-circuit photovoltage, VOC, resulting from the insertion of a polyoxometalate (POM) group. Compared with dye 3 containing a 2,2′-bithiophene π linker, its two counterparts (dyes 4 and 5) with rigidified bithiophene π linkers tend to accelerate the IET process, as well as slow the electron recombination, and thus improve the performance of the DSSCs. In particular, dye 4 with a rigidified bithiophene π linker fastening using a C atom obtains a larger JSC and VOC compared to that of dye 5 with a N atom rigidified bithiophene π linker.
1. Introduction
With the increasing consumption of fossil fuels and growing environmental problems, it is necessary to develop sustainable clean energy sources such as solar energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the most representative example of third-generation sunlight-to-electricity devices, have gained widespread attention since the seminal paper reported by Grätzel in 1991, owing to their low production costs, easy fabrication, flexible structural modification and relatively high energy-conversion efficiency.1 A typical dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is, as a rule, composed of a dye-sensitized semiconductor photoanode (typically TiO2), a counter electrode, and a redox electrolyte (usually the I−/I3− redox shuttle). As the most important component in DSSCs, dye plays a crucial role in accelerating the electron transfer process and promoting a higher light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency. To date, the energy conversion efficiency has been improved to 14% by using a DSSC co-photosensitized with an alkoxysilyl-anchor dye, ADEKA-1, and a carboxy-anchor organic dye, LEG4.2 The maximum achievable theoretical conversion efficiency has been estimated to be 32%,3 implying that the record conversion efficiency of 14% can be improved significantly by designing novel dyes. However, the development of efficient dyes for DSSCs remains a challenging issue, and the most important one is to improve the light harvesting ability in the visible region and even the near-IR region. Therefore, appropriate molecular modification of dyes with the aim of red-shifting the UV-vis absorption spectra are desired.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of inorganic metal–oxygen clusters with early transition metals (Mo, W, V, Nb, Ta) in their highest oxidation states, have received significant attention in many fields, such as catalysis, materials science and analytical chemistry, as a result of their unique physical and chemical properties.4–10 Recently, POMs have been widely used in DSSCs as photosensitizers.11,12 One overwhelming characteristic of POMs is the strong electron acceptability, which can promote the transport of photo-generated electrons, suppress the recombination of electron and hole, and thus improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs. POMs can be used for constructing inorganic–organic hybrids, in which the POMs act as electron acceptors and organic segments act as the electron donors, combining the advantages of POMs clusters with a high stability and organic groups with good finely-controllable structures.13,14 Hence, the maximum absorption peaks of hybrids are significantly red-shifted compared with the individual components, which meets the requirements of long wavelength absorbed dyes. Thus, POM-based dyes are promising for use in DSSCs with a higher conversion efficiency.
Generally, the most extensively studied dyes configured as the donor–π linker–acceptor (D–π–A) pattern are desirable due to the ability for facilitating photoinduced charge separation. The performance of DSSCs is expected to be improved by carefully screening the donor, π linker and acceptor subunits of dyes. Considering its outstanding electron donating properties, triphenylamine is extensively used as the D in the D–π–A pattern dyes, and cyanoacrylic acid has been commonly applied as the A moiety, which contributes to the charge separation and electron transfer process. Moreover, the π linkers are crucial in the light absorption range, electron injection and charge recombination processes. It is believed that highly efficient dyes bearing a triphenylamine donor and cyanoacrylic acid acceptor can be achieved by elaborate molecular modifications on π linkers. Despite this, thiophene and its derivatives, such as bithiophene, have been proven to be excellent π linkers for improving the light harvesting efficiency, a few rigidified bithiophene molecules have been studied, which may efficiently suppress the rotational disorder of bithiophene.15,16 Theoretical calculations are useful tools for screening potential dyes.17–21 Herein, a series of POM-based dyes were designed, in which triphenylamine and cyanoacrylic acid are used as the electron donor and electron acceptor, respectively, and thiophene derivatives including 2-vinylthiophene, 2,2′-bithiophene and rigidified bithiophene fastened by C and N atoms are used as the π linkers. The electronic properties, absorption spectra, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics, dye aggregation effects, energy shift of the TiO2 conduction band (ΔECB) and the electron recombination process of the studied dyes, as well as the interfacial electron transfer (IET) processes, were systematically analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations. It was found that the absorption spectra, ICT characteristics of the isolated dyes, short-circuit photocurrent density JSC and open-circuit photovoltage VOC can be gradually tuned by the modification of the π linkers, and the efficient π linker candidates for enhancing the performance of DSSCs are screened out. We expect that the present work could give theoretical guidelines for designing high performance dyes.
2. Computation details
The ground-state geometries of all dyes were fully optimized at the B3LYP22 level with LANL2DZ for the Mo atom and the 6-31G(d) basis set for the other atoms using the Gaussian 09 D01 package.23 TD-DFT calculations were performed for simulating the absorption spectra of isolated dyes by computing the lowest 30 singlet–singlet excitation states. The absorption spectra of the D5 dye was simulated using the PBE0,24 CAM-B3LYP,25 M0626 and M062X27 functionals to evaluate the functional influence on the transition energies and the results are collated in Table S1 (ESI†). The comparison between the experimental and theoretical absorption spectrum of D5 indicates that the maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) simulated by M062X (475 nm) is in good agreement with the experimental value (476 nm),28 thus, the TD-DFT calculations were performed under the M062X/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level. The absorption spectra of the studied dyes were simulated using the Gaussian functions with a full-width at half maximum of 0.67 eV through Multiwfn software in this work.29 To evaluate the charge recombination dynamics, we optimized the dye–I2 complexes at the M062X/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level, which is proved to be excellent for describing the weak interactions between dyes and I2.30 Moreover, the basis set superposition error (BSSE) to binding energy for dye–I2 was calculated using the counterpoise method.31 In order to search the most stable dimer structures for dyes, 30 structural configurations for each dye were generated using the Molclus program32 and were adopted as initial structures for optimization under the B3LYP/3-21G level using the Gaussian 09 D01 package. The most stable dimer structure of D5 obtained, as well as the structures with Na+ as a counterion for the dye 2–5 dimers, were further optimized at B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ.33 The interaction energies of the dimers were calculated at the same level of theory. The reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis,34 as well as the simple energy decomposition, was performed by means of Multiwfn software.35 In addition, the solvent effect of acetonitrile was taken into account based on the polarizable continuum model (PCM).36
The (TiO2)48 used to model the TiO2 nanoparticle effects was obtained by appropriately cutting an anatase (101) surface, following the strategy proposed by Persson and co-workers,37 which is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). In order to gain insights into the change in the energy of the conduction band (ΔECB) owing to the adsorption of dyes, the structures of the dyes adsorbed on (TiO2)48 were analyzed using the Dmol3 program.38 Considering the generalized gradient approximation (GGA),39 the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional40 and the double numerical polarization (DNP) basis set were used to account for the exchange and correlation effects, the dye–TiO2 complexes were optimized at the GGA/PBE/DNP level. The density of state (DOS) of pure TiO2 and the partial DOS (PDOS) of TiO2 in the dye–TiO2 complexes at the B3LYP-D3/3-21G(d) level were used to evaluate the ΔECB. With the aim of quantitatively evaluating the IET rate of the dyes, semi-classical quantum dynamic simulations of the dye–TiO2 systems were applied based on the semi-empirical extended Hückel theory (EH) method,41,42 which has been widely used to investigate the photo-induced electron transfer across semiconductor interfaces,43–45 further details can be found in “Simulation of the electron injection” in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Molecular structures
The prototype dye D5 (abbreviated as dye 1) was synthesized by Sun and co-workers,28 in which triphenylamine and cyanoacrylic acid act as an electron donor and electron acceptor, respectively, and 2-vinylthiophene acts as a π linker. Dye 2 is designed by adding a Lindqvist-type POM ([Mo6O19]2−) into the synthesized dye 1 as the electron-withdrawing group. Considering that the π linker is a key factor in regulating the light absorption range and the charge recombination process, dyes 3–5 were constructed by replacing the 2-vinylthiophene in dye 2 with 2,2′-bithiophene, 4,4-dimethyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithioph-ene (C atom rigidified bithiophene) and 4-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (N atom rigidified bithiophene) as π linkers, respectively. The molecular structures of dyes 1–5 along with the selected bond lengths r and dihedral angles θ are displayed in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The molecular structures of the studied dyes. 
It has been widely accepted that the π-conjugation degree is very important for the absorption properties and for efficient electron transportation through the π linker from the electron donor to the electron acceptor, which can be reflected by the r and θ of the dyes listed in Table S2 (ESI†). Compared with dye 1, dye 2 has a smaller r1, θ1 and θ2 and similar r2 and θ3 values, indicating that the introduction of POM tends to improve the conjugation extent of the dyes owing to the reduced steric hindrance, and the favorable conjugation extent of dye 2 may facilitate a red-shifted absorption spectra. It is clear that further modification of the 2-vinylthiophene π linker in dye 2 slightly influences the r1 and r2, and significantly affects θ. The smaller θ1 and θ2 of dyes 4 and 5 indicate that rigidified π linkers are favorable for the delocalization of electrons, contributing to the electron transfer from the electron donor to the electron acceptor and the red-shift absorption spectra. Amongst dyes 1–5, dye 4 with a C atom rigidified bithiophene π linker possesses the smallest deviation from planarity, which results from the smallest r1, r2, θ1 and θ2, predicting that the absorption spectrum of dye 4 will be red-shifted.
3.2. Electronic structures
The suitable frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy level of a dye is one of the indispensable factors necessary for efficient electron transport. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of dyes should be higher than the conduction band (CB) edge energy of TiO2 (−4.00 eV), ensuring an adequate electron injection driving force between the excited dyes and TiO2, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of dyes should be lower than the I−/I3− redox potential (−4.80 eV),46 guaranteeing that the dyes can be efficiently regenerated. The FMO energy levels of dyes 1–5 are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), in which the LUMO energy levels of all studied dyes are more positive compared with the CB edge energy of TiO2, and the HOMO energy levels are more negative than the I−/I3− redox potential, showing that the energy levels of the studied dyes are satisfactory in terms of the energy level matching of the DSSCs.
The slightly decreased HOMO and significantly decreased LUMO energy levels of dye 2 lead to a smaller H–L gap (1.98 eV) compared to dye 1 (2.30 eV), which means less energy is needed for dye 2 excitation. Therefore, the introduction of POM is beneficial to red-shift the absorption spectra. Dyes 2–5 have similar HOMO energies owing to the similar HOMO distributions (Fig. S3, ESI†), which mainly localize on the electron donor groups. The slightly decreased LUMO energies of dyes 3–5 compared to that of dye 2 result from the different LUMO distributions, POM plays a vital role in the LUMO energies of dyes 3–5, while the LUMO localizes on the POM and is spread over the π linker and acceptor group for dye 2. The H–L gaps slightly decrease from dye 2 to dye 5 owing to the increased extent of π-conjugation of the dyes by modifying the π linkers, contributing to the red-shift of the absorption spectra.
3.3. Absorption spectra and intramolecular charge transfer
Dye-sensitized solar cells are photoelectric conversion devices, thus, there is no doubt that dyes should have as intense and broad absorption as possible to cover the whole visible-near-IR range. The simulated UV-vis absorption spectra of dyes 1–5 are illustrated in Fig. 2. The excitation energies (Ev), maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax), oscillator strengths (f) and major electronic compositions are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). It can be seen that dye 2 (503 nm) has a red-shifted absorption spectrum relative to dye 1 (475 nm). The better matching with the solar photon flux spectrum for dye 2 indicates that the introduction of POM is beneficial for improving the light absorption capability. Compared to dye 2, the λmax values are further red-shifted for dyes 3–5, and the oscillator strengths also increase that result from the increased conjugation extent. The calculated λmax values of dyes 3–5 are in the following order: dye 4 (539 nm) > dye 5 (528 nm) > dye 3 (511 nm), indicating the introduction of fastening atoms, particularly the C atom, into 2,2′-bithiophene leads to red-shifting of the absorption spectra. Except for dye 1, the electron transitions related to the maximum absorption wavelengths are mainly from HOMO−1 → LUMO, which can be assigned to the charge transfer from the organic group to a POM cluster, although the maximum absorption wavelength of dye 1 is predominantly associated with the HOMO → LUMO transition, which can be attributed to the charge transfer within organic segments (Fig. S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Simulated absorption spectra of the studied dyes. 
The beneficial ICT process upon photo excitation can boost the generation of efficient charge separated states. The index of the spatial extent method is used to quantify the extent of the ICT process, and several theoretical indexes of studied dyes, such as the amount of transferred charges qCT and the corresponding effective distance dCT, as well as the t index, are given in Fig. S4 (the details can be found in the ESI†). Dyes 3–5 have a similar qCT and dCT to dye 1, which are larger than that of dye 2. For dyes 3–5, it was found that the qCT increases in the following order: dye 3 (0.97 e−) < dye 5 (1.01 e−) < dye 4 (1.02 e−), while the dCT values increase as follows: dye 3 (3.25 Å) < dye 4 (3.33 Å) < dye 5 (3.46 Å). This confirms that the rigidified bithiophene π linker not only benefits the light absorption, but also improves the charge transfer (CT) process, which results from the lower reorganization energy χ of dyes 4 and 5 compared to that of dye 3 (Table 1). In addition, the smaller t indexes of dyes 2–5 compared to those for dye 1 resulting from the significantly decreased LUMO energies show the smaller degree of separation between the density increment and density depletion, which is not beneficial for charge separation.

3.4. Factors influencing JSC
According to the discussion in the “Theoretical background” section of the ESI,† the negative electron injection driving force ΔGinj, the small |ΔGinj + χ| and the large light harvesting efficiency (LHE) can guarantee a high JSC, therefore the ΔGinj, χ and LHE values were calculated and are listed in Table 1. The ΔGinj of all of the studied dyes were found to be negative, indicating that they have sufficient driving force to insure efficient electron injection. Dye 2 has a smaller |ΔGinj + χ| and larger LHE than dye 1, indicating POM plays an important role in transferring the electron and improving the light harvesting ability, and the values of |ΔGinj + χ| and LHE are further reduced and improved in dyes 3–5, respectively. For dyes 3–5, the values of LHE are close to 1, which can lead to a high JSC.
3.5. Dye aggregation effects
Dye aggregation effects may result in an enhanced charge recombination, which decreases the overall efficiency of the DSSCs. It is well known that the dye aggregation effects are geometry dependent, for example, dimer configurations are responsible for this effect.47 Therefore the dimers of the studied dyes were optimized based on the structures obtained using the Molclus program. The most stable dimer configurations upon optimization, as well as the interaction energies ΔEtot, for dyes 1–5 are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 (ESI†). The arrow head and arrow tail refer to the electron acceptor groups and electron donor sides, respectively.
 Fig. 3  Optimized dimer configurations, as well as the interaction energies ΔEtot, for the studied dyes. 
To understand the interaction nature for different aggregation modes, the plots of the electron density ρ(r) multiplied by the sign of the second Hessian eigenvalue λ2versus RDG for the dimers of dyes 1–5 were created, as shown in Fig. 4. Moreover, the gradient isosurfaces with RDG = 0.5 a.u. for the dimers of dyes 1–5 are colored according to the values of sign(λ2)ρ to understand the origin of the noncovalent interaction as listed in Fig. 4, in which the blue, green and red areas are identified as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions and steric repulsions, respectively. The isosurfaces for the dimers of dyes 1–5 lie between hydrogen and oxygen atoms, which are characterized as hydrogen bonds, and the ΔEtot values for dyes 1–5 are in the order: dye 3 (−7.74 kcal mol−1) < dye 2 (−12.32 kcal mol−1) < dye 5 (−13.32 kcal mol−1) < dye 4 (−13.77 kcal mol−1) < dye 1 (−28.09 kcal mol−1), indicating that the introduction of POM is beneficial for suppressing the charge recombination. A significantly reduced orbital interaction ΔEorb is observed when POM is introduced for dyes 2–5 (Table 2), which is responsible for the smaller ΔEtot compared to that of dye 1 (details can be found in the ESI†).

3.6. Factors influencing the VOC
The VOC can be estimated by using eqn (S5) in ESI,† and the ΔECB after dye adsorption is one of the most important factors affecting the VOC, which can be determined by calculating the DOS profiles of the pure TiO2 and the PDOS profiles of TiO2 in the dye–TiO2 complexes. As shown in Fig. 5, dyes adsorbed on the semiconductor surface shift the CB edge of TiO2 toward a more positive direction with respect to the CB of pristine TiO2. With the exception of dye 1, dyes 2–5 have similar values of ΔECB.
 Fig. 5  Total and partial DOS of the dye–(TiO2)48 complexes. 
However, a larger ΔECB does not guarantee a higher VOC value unless the electron recombination process can be reduced, which is also an important factor influencing the performance of the DSSCs.48,49 The electron recombination process can lead to a decreased electron number in the CB (nc), and thus the decreased VOC, including the recombination between the injection electron in TiO2 with oxidized dyes, and the recombination between the injection electron with a redox couple in the electrolyte, the latter dominates the recombination route.50 It is well known that the recombination with the electrolyte is governed by I2 binding with the special atoms or functional groups (such as O and S atoms or CN group) in dyes through a noncovalent interaction,51 which could accelerate the electron recombination process by changing the iodine concentration near the semiconductor surface. The bonding site that is closer to the TiO2 semiconductor surface results in a higher iodine concentration in the vicinity of the semiconductor, resulting in a faster electron recombination.52Fig. 6 presents the optimized molecular structures of the dye–I2 complexes and the corresponding interaction energies, in which many sites, including the S and N atoms, and the CN group in the organic molecular segment, as well as the bridging oxygen (Ob1 and Ob2) and terminal oxygen (Od), in POM were considered. The O atoms of the POM in dye 2 provide much stronger charge recombination sites than the CN group and S atom in dye 1, which are further from the semiconductor surface, leading to a retarded electron recombination and the increased VOC by introducing POM. For dyes 3–5, the interaction energies of the bridging oxygen atoms Ob2 in POM and I2 are much larger than those of the other sites, and the interaction energy of 4-Ob2-I2 is largest among dyes 3–5, indicating that dye 4 with a C atom rigidified bithiophene π linker may obtain a superior VOC owing to the larger nc.

3.7. Interfacial electron transfer analysis
Obviously, modification of the π linker can also influence the interfacial electron injection, which has been simulated by means of the IET code. Time-dependent survival probability (TDSP) curves for the electron injection from dyes 1–5 to TiO2 were employed to investigate the IET performance, which are illustrated in Fig. 7. A gradually delocalized electron was injected into TiO2 within the 100 fs time-scale. Firstly, the charge density is populated in the dye, and then it spreads to the TiO2 semiconductor. Finally, the initial population of the charge density in the dye decays to reach an equilibrium state. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the IET gets lower after an ultra-fast stage for dyes 2–5, and the injections for dyes 2 and 3 in the ultra-fast stage are even better than that in dyes 4 and 5, while dye 1 has a low IET at all times. The electrons in dyes 2, 4 and 5 are almost completely injected after 100 fs, while the electron injection for dye 1 takes a long time. The results show that the introduction of POM is favorable for efficient interfacial injection resulting from the larger compositions of the electron acceptor in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals for dyes 2–5 (Fig. S6, ESI†), which contribute to the electron transport into TiO2, and thus lead to the fast IET. Moreover, dyes 4 and 5 with a rigidified bithiophene π linker fastening using C and N atoms would also obtain superior IET properties. The evolution of the injection processes of dyes 1–5 in Fig. S7 (ESI†) show that the excited electrons concentrate on dyes at the beginning, and all the excited electrons propagate from dyes to the TiO2 semiconductor after 20 fs, except for dye 1. This clearly indicates that POM is beneficial for election injection, and a rigidified bithiophene π linker fastened by C atom in dye 4 can also help electron propagation to the semiconducting layer, contributing to improving the performance of the DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
Theoretical investigations of POM-based dyes with a triphenylamine electron donor group, cyanoacrylic acid acceptor group and different thiophene derivative π linkers were performed to analyze the influence of a rigidified bithiophene with fastening atoms (C and N) on the performance of DSSCs. In addition to the electronic properties, the absorption spectra and ICT parameters, JSC, VOC, and dye aggregation effects, as well as the IET process, were taken into consideration and found to be major factors affecting the performance of DSSCs. The results indicate that dye 2 not only red-shifts the absorption spectra and reduces the interaction energy for the most stable dimer configuration compared to dye 1, but also has a larger JSC governed by the light harvesting ability, and a larger VOC connected with the electron recombination process, indicating the importance of inserting POM. Compared with dye 3, dyes 4 and 5 with rigidified bithiophene π linkers tend to red-shift the absorption spectra, improve the ICT parameters, slow the electron recombination and accelerate the IET process, finally enhancing the performance of the DSSCs. In particular, dye 4 with a rigidified bithiophene π linker fastening by a C atom could obtain a larger JSC and VOC compared to that of dye 5 with a rigidified π linker fastening using a N atom. This work highlights the benefit of rigidified bithiophene π linkers for POM-based dyes, which is expected to provide valuable insights into the materials design of novel dyes used in DSSCs.
