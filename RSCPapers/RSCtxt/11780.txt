    , Accepted 10th January 2014First published on 15th January 2014AbstractNew multiple photosynthetic reaction centers were constructed from cyclophosphazene decorated multiporphyrin chromophores and a fulleropyrrolidine having a pyridine ligand (FPY). The excited state electron transfer in the self-assembled donor–acceptor assembly was investigated by using steady state absorption and emission, time-resolved emission spectroscopy and nanosecond laser flash photolysis. The effect of metal (Zn2+) coordination to porphyrin units in the multiporphyrin arrays on cyclophosphazine scaffold (P3N3Zn) was studied by comparing with metal free porphyrin assembly on a cyclophosphazene scaffold (P3N3). In P3N3Zn, the decrease of absorption and fluorescence intensity and the lowering of the amplitude of longer fluorescence lifetime with increase of FPY concentration reflect the formation of a ground state complex with an association constant of ∼14910 M−1. When compared to the metal-free complex P3N3, the metal-coordinated derivative P3N3Zn exhibited shortening of the singlet and triplet state lifetimes and lowering of the singlet and triplet quantum yields. The cause of the decrease of the triplet quantum yields by insertion of zinc metal is discussed along with the possible non-planarity of the porphyrin ring. From the fluorescence lifetime measurements for the P3N3Zn–FPY mixture, it is proposed that self-assembly of the donor–acceptor complex leads to charge separated species with a rate constant of 7.1 × 109 s−1. The decrease of triplet state intensity and lifetime of the P3N3Zn in the P3N3Zn–FPY complex from the nanosecond transient absorption studies support the occurrence of intermolecular electron transfer in the triplet state.
1. Introduction
Artificial photosynthetic model systems have been widely synthesized and studied extensively to understand the energy and electron transfer of the primary events in natural photosynthesis.1–7 The outcome of these investigations has allowed significant contributions in the development of devices such as organic solar cells, optoelectronics and photocatalysis.5,8–19 Among various photoactive molecules,20–23 porphyrins, especially metalloporphyrins, have been observed as essential components in many models of photosynthetic reaction centers as these can transfer the electron/energy in the excited state to a three dimensional electron acceptor such as fullerene, resulting in long lived charge separated state.24 Recently Ghosh et al. reported porphyrin aggregates as a potential candidate for biomimetic artificial antenna activity by observing higher charge separation due to an exciton-coupled charge transfer process in porphyrin J-aggregates/TiO2 hybrid materials.25 Even though there is a great difficulty to construct multiple chromophoric systems with covalently linked donor–acceptor units, many complexes have emerged with covalent bonded systems.24,26 Recently, by using zinc porphyrin dendrimer as a light harvesting unit and C60py as electron acceptor, a supramolecular complex was constructed with the long lived (250 μs) charge separated state.24 A supramolecular triad was also constructed by complexing fullerenes with a two-ferrocene-appended bis-porphyrin molecule which exhibited short lived charge transfer fluorescence state for fullerene adducts.27 Alternatively, based on hydrogen bonding, π–π interaction and coordination bonds, non-covalently bonded donor–acceptor supramolecular assemblies have also been reported.10,28,29 Multiple modular donor–acceptor complexes, zinc porphyrins covalently linked with energy imparting molecules of triphenylamine and borondipyrrin as donors and fullerene and naphthalenediimide as acceptor28 were designed to probe sequential energy and electron transfer reactions. Fullerene conjugates have fast electron transfer with rate constants of 5.0 × 109 s−1 yielding charge separated species with relatively slow back electron transfer. A supramolecular assembly prepared by using zinc phthalocyanine having four entities in the periphery and phenylimidazole functionalized fulleropyrrolidine in presence of SnO2 provided a higher incident photon to current conversion efficiency covering the visible and near IR region.16 A high electron transfer efficiency was observed in tetraphenylporphyrin zinc derivative functionalized with L-glutamide when complexed to pyridine substituted pyrrolidinofullerene.29
Cyclophosphazenes are robust and versatile inorganic ring compounds and can be easily functionalized. Because of its inherent nature of the robustness of the phosphorous–nitrogen backbone and redox activity, its polydendate coordination can be modulated. Recently we have aligned multiporphyrin arrays on the periphery of the cyclotriphosphazene scaffolds.30–32 For example, six/octaporphyrin units were arranged symmetrically around the cyclotriphosphazene/cyclotetraphosphazene rings, adopting an alternate arrangement of porphyrin units above and below with respect to the ring plane resulting three/four porphyrin units residing on each side of the ring.30,32 Porphyrin units in these multiporphyrin arrays interact weakly with each other and retain their individual characteristics in the ground as well as excited states. Free base hexaporphyrin assembly on a cyclotriphosphazene core (P3N3) and its hexametalloporphyrin derivative (P3N3Zn) have been used for the first time to construct self-assembled donor–acceptor complexes with pyridine substituted fulleropyrrolidine as electron acceptors. The molecular structures of the complexes used in this study are given in the Chart 1. Steady state and time resolved photophysical investigations have been carried out to understand the intra/inter molecular electron transfer between self-assembled donor–acceptor moieties. We used time correlated single photon counting and nanosecond laser flash photolysis to characterize the electron transfer processes in the excited singlet and triplet state, respectively. These results of photoinduced electron transfer between the multiporphyrins and fullerenes are useful to develop artificial multi photosynthetic systems for solar cell, optoelectronics and photocatalysis applications.

2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis
Synthesis and purification of P3N3Zn and P3N3 were carried out according to the reported procedures.30–32 Synthesis of the fulleropyrrolidine derivative with pyridine was also prepared according to a literature procedure.33 Solvents used were HPLC grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA.
2.2 Instrumentation
Absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence experiments were performed with a FluoroLog-322 (Horiba) which was equipped with a 450 W Xe arc lamp. Fluorescence quantum yields in toluene were determined with the relative method using an optically matched solution of tetraphenylporphyrin as the reference (R = 0.11).34 The following equation was used for calculating quantum yield, (1)where the subscripts R and S refer to the reference and samples respectively. Abs, Area and n are the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, area under the fluorescence spectrum and refractive index of the solvent respectively.
Fluorescence lifetime experiments were performed by using an IBH picosecond single photon counting system using the 440 nm nano LED (<0.2 ns) as excitation sources and a Hamamatsu C4878-02 microchannel plate (MCP) detector. Decay in the fluorescence intensity (I) with time (t) was fitted either by a mono/double-exponential function: (2)where τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes of different species, and A1 and A2 are their respective amplitudes. The quality of the fits was checked by examining the residual distribution and the χ2 value.
Nanosecond laser flash photolysis experiments were performed by using an Applied Photophysics model LKS 60 laser kinetic spectrometer by using the second harmonic (532 nm) from an INDI-40-10-HG Quanta Ray Nd:YAG laser. The probing light source was a 150 W xenon arc lamp. The light of the probe transmitted through a 1 cm sample quartz cuvette was dispersed by a mono-chromator and detected by a photomultiplier coupled to a digital oscilloscope (Agilent Infiniium DSO8064A, 600 MHz, 4 GSas−1). The analyzing and laser beams were fixed at right angles to each other. The laser power of every laser pulse was registered by using a bypath with a fast silicon photodiode. Solutions for laser flash photolysis studies were deaerated by being purged with argon for at least 20 min before the experiments. All the experiments were conducted at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Steady state absorption and emission studies

Fig. 1a shows the normalized absorption spectra of P3N3 (black) and P3N3Zn (red) in toluene. P3N3 has the strong Soret band maximum around 420 nm and four weak Q bands around 516, 551, 593 and 648 nm, whereas in the metal coordinated derivative, P3N3Zn Soret band appeared at 423 nm and Q bands appeared at 550, and 590 nm. It is already known that there is no or only weak interaction among the porphyrin subunits in the P3N3 and P3N3Zn assemblies.30,31 Steady state fluorescence spectra of these derivatives were obtained by exciting the Soret band at 420 nm and are shown in Fig. 1b. P3N3 showed two fluorescence maxima at 653 and 721 nm, whereas P3N3Zn showed bands at 601 and 650 nm. We have determined the fluorescence quantum yields of 0.120 ± 0.010 and 0.030 ± 0.002 for P3N3 and P3N3Zn respectively, by using tetraphenylporphyrin as reference.34 From the literatures, it was found that the addition of metal, Zn2+ could either increase35 or decrease36,37 the fluorescence quantum yields of porphyrin derivatives. In our case the insertion of Zn2+ caused a decrease of fluorescence quantum yield reflecting that internal conversion and/or intersystem crossing play major role than the radiative decay from their first excited singlet state.
 Fig. 1  Absorption (a) and fluorescence (b) spectra of P3N3 (black) and P3N3Zn (red) in toluene. The fluorescence spectra were obtained by exciting at 420 nm. 
We constructed supramolecular donor–acceptor complexes by axial coordination of pyridine functionalized fulleropyrrolidine (FPY) with multiporphyrin arrays to understand the mechanism of photoinduced energy and electron transfer in the multiple photosynthetic reaction centers. Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectral changes of P3N3Zn with increasing concentration of FPY. Upon increasing the addition of FPY to P3N3Zn (6 × 10−6 to 3× 10−4 M) red shift of the Soret and Q bands to ∼434 nm, and 565 and 605 nm, respectively, were observed. This could reflect the formation of ground state complexes where coordination occurs between the pyridine unit of fulleropyrrolidine and the zinc metal in the porphyrin unit, thus lowering the energy of in-plane π–π* transition of the porphyrin unit. The inset shows the Scatchard plot (ΔA vs. ΔA/[FPY]) and the association constant was found to be ∼14910 M−1. To check the influence of metal coordination, various concentrations of FPY were also added to the P3N3 resulting in little or no absorption spectral change (Fig. S1, ESI†). This observation suggests that unlike P3N3Zn, a coordinated complex is not formed in P3N3 with FPY because of the absence of zinc metal in the center of the porphyrin unit.

The emission spectra of P3N3Zn upon addition of increasing amount of FPY were measured by exciting at 420 nm as shown in Fig. 3. A strong quenching of fluorescence intensity with increasing concentration of FPY was noted. However, for P3N3, little or weak quenching of the fluorescence intensity were observed with increase of concentration of FPY (Fig. S2, ESI†). The fluorescence quenching is analyzed by the Stern–Volmer equation of bimolecular electron transfer,38 (3)where I0 and I are the fluorescence intensities of multiporphyrin derivatives in the absence and presence of FPY, respectively, ket is the bimolecular quenching constant; τ0 is the lifetime of the multiporphyrin derivative alone, [FPY] is concentration of FPY used for the studies. The Stern–Volmer plots for the P3N3Zn–FPY (red) and P3N3–FPY (black) complex are shown together in Fig. 4. It is observed that P3N3Zn–FPY showed a higher slope at a lower concentration of FPY and attained a downward curvature with higher concentration whereas for P3N3–FPY the plot was linear, almost parallel to the x-axis, having a Ksv value of 3.04 × 103 M−1. The bimolecular quenching constant, (ket = 7.97 × 1013 M−1 s−1) obtained from the linear segment of the Stern–Volmer plot of P3N3Zn–FPY (Ksv = 1.46 × 105 M−1), is higher than the normal diffusion controlled processes. However for the P3N3–FPY mixture, the ket value of 3.21 × 1011 M−1 s−1 is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the P3N3Zn–FPY mixture. The comparison between the Stern–Volmer plots suggested that in the P3N3Zn–FPY mixture, fluorescence quenching might be due to both intramolecular electron transfer from the singlet excited state of the multiporphyrin moiety to the coordinated FPY and intermolecular electron transfer from the multiporphyrin units to uncomplexed FPY. In the case of the P3N3–FPY mixture, the decrease of minimal fluorescence intensity could reflect the occurrence of intermolecular interaction between the porphyrin derivative and the nearby free FPY as major processes and needs further investigation.

3.2 Time resolved measurements
Time resolved investigations were carried out with time correlated single photon counting and laser flash photolysis to understand the reaction mechanism involved in the photoinduced electron transfer in the singlet and triplet states respectively.10,12,17,26,28,29

3.2.1 Fluorescence lifetime. 
The fluorescence decay of P3N3Zn (2 × 10−6 M) in toluene was measured by exciting at 440 nm and probed at 650 nm (Fig. 5). The fluorescence kinetic trace fitted with mono-exponential decay showed a lifetime of ∼2.0 ns. On addition of FPY, the fluorescence lifetime decay becomes shorter (Fig. 5) and could be fit with two exponentials. The fitted results are shown in Table 1. From this Table, it is observed that the amplitude of longer lifetime species decreases and that of short lived species increases with increase of FPY concentration. This observation reflects that the amount of free porphyrin molecule is decreased during the titration processes. It is assumed that the short lived component could represent the charge-separated species formed by transferring the electron intramolecularly between the porphyrin units and FPY.17,39 We have calculated the charge-separation rates and quantum yield by using the following equation.17,39 (4)

In the above equation τcomplex and τref are the lifetimes of the complexed P3N3Zn–FPY (fast decay components) and P3N3Zn alone. The ksingletCS and ΦsingletCS values were found to be 7.1 × 109 s−1 and 0.92, suggesting a relatively fast charge-separation process occurring between P3N3Zn and FPY and hence this could be a good donor–acceptor system. For the metal-free multi porphyrin derivative of P3N3, even though there is decreased emission intensity observed during the addition of FPY, no or little change in the fluorescence kinetics decay was observed (Fig. S3 in ESI†). The fluorescence kinetic decays were fitted with a single exponential resulting in a lifetime of 9.45 ns. Increase of FPY concentration did not bring significant change in the fluorescence lifetime, representing weak interaction between multiporphyrin units and FPY in the P3N3–FPY mixture.


3.2.2 Transient absorption spectra. 
Nanosecond transient absorption spectra were obtained by laser flash photolysis of P3N3, P3N3Zn and P3N3Zn–FPY mixture in Ar-saturated toluene using a 532 nm nanosecond laser as the excitation source. The excitation at 532 nm would reduce the probability of dissociation of the complex before charge separation. The transient absorption spectra of P3N3Zn in toluene exhibited a maximum at around 490 nm (Fig. 6) and its absorption intensity decreases as the spectral time increases. [Note: the ground state absorption spectra of P3N3Zn has strong Soret band intensity around 420 nm, hence transient absorption spectra are not shown in these regions.] There is also negative absorption (bleach) at ∼550 nm, which corresponds to ground state absorption of the α-band. The intensity of this band also recovers back to the equilibrium with time. The complete decay of the kinetic trace at 490 nm is shown in Fig. 7 having a lifetime of 18.2 μs. In the presence of oxygen (inset of Fig. 7, red), the quenching of lifetime (0.17 μs) reflects the presence of the triplet state absorption of P3N3Zn at 490 nm. Similarly, the transient absorption spectrum of P3N3 showed an absorption maximum around 450 nm with a lifetime of 52.5 μs (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). Thus, the lifetime of the triplet state of P3N3 is much longer than that of P3N3Zn.

The quantum yield of triplet formation of P3N3 and P3N3Zn by intersystem crossing was evaluated by energy transfer from 3P3N3*and 3P3N3Zn* to β-carotene in toluene and comparison with that of the triplet state of Ru(bpy)32+ as a standard.40,41 For this purpose, a toluene solution of multiporphyrin derivatives P3N3 and P3N3Zn, whose concentration was optically matched (adjusted to have the same optical density for the P3N3, P3N3Zn and Ru(bpy)32+) at 532 nm with that of Ru(bpy)32+ to compensate for a possible optical filtering effect, was prepared with a known concentration of β-carotene. Even though β-carotene absorbs a small fraction of the laser photons at 532 nm, its direct excitation does not result in any significant formation of β-carotene triplets, because of its poor internal conversion efficiency.40,42 The triplet quantum yield values of P3N3 and P3N3Zn in toluene were found to be 0.46 ± 0.04 and 0.16 ± 0.03 respectively based on the following equation (5)where the superscripts S and Ref represent multiporphyrin derivatives and Ru(bpy)32+ respectively, ΔA represents the transient absorbance of 3β-carotene* at 520 nm, formed by energy transfer from the multiporphyrin derivatives and Ru(bpy)32+, kobs the pseudo first order rate constant for the growth of the β-carotene triplet in solutions containing multiporphyrin derivatives or Ru(bpy)32+, and k0 represents the rate constant for the decay of the triplet energy donors in the absence of β-carotene. The triplet extinction coefficient (εT) of multiporphyrin derivatives were also estimated from the reported (εT) value of Ru(bpy)32+ as a standard40,41 (εRefT = 13500 M−1 cm−1 at 370 nm for Ru(bpy)32+) by substituting the observed Φ for multiporphyrin derivatives and the respective absorbance values in the following equation, (6) The values of εT for P3N3 and P3N3Zn in toluene were determined to be 15400 ± 1000 and 20200 ± 1000 M−1 cm−1, respectively.
The observation of the decrease of triplet quantum yield in metal coordinated multiporphyrin derivatives is quite opposite to the Fermi's golden rule of heavy atom effect.43,44 The reason for decreasing the triplet quantum yield by insertion of zinc metal could be due to: (1) increase of non-planarity of the porphyrin moieties;45,46 (2) change of delocalization of porphyrin ring π-electron and formation of different low-lying charge transfer states;46,47 (3) increase the probability of internal conversion path to ground state; and (4) enhancement of the back inter-system crossing rate to the ground state.48
Before the addition of FPY to make donor–acceptor complexes, we have also measured the transient absorption spectra of FPY alone in toluene by exciting at 532 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†). The transient spectra have a broad feature with a maximum around 710 nm with lifetime of 3.66 μs (Fig. S7, ESI†). This spectrum pattern is consistent with earlier reports of the parent C60 fullerene molecule.49 It is known that the triplet state lifetime of fullerene is dependent on the concentration as well as the energy of the laser used for excitation as it undergoes triplet–triplet annihilation.49 Hence, throughout our experiment, we have used the same concentration of FPY and laser energy was kept constant for excitation. The transient absorption spectra of the P3N3Zn–FPY mixture in toluene at 0.5 μs is shown in Fig. 8 along with P3N3Zn for comparison. The decrease of triplet absorbance and lifetime of P3N3Zn at 490 nm are observed, whereas there is an increase of absorbance in the range starting from 600–800 nm. At 490 nm, the triplet state lifetime of P3N3Zn in the presence of FPY is decreased from 18.2 μs to 0.78 μs (Fig. 9a). The broad absorption spectral features in Fig. 8 appearing from 600 to 800 nm could be due to the formation of a radical cation of P3N3Zn.15,50,51 Because the limitations of our experimental set up (our existing PMT is sensitive only up to 800 nm), we were unable to probe the radical anion of FPY. Nevertheless from similar studies of related systems,5,6,16,18 it is well known that the anion radical of FPY has a transient absorption maximum at ∼1000 nm.
 Fig. 8  Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of P3N3Zn–FPY mixture at 0.5 μs obtained by laser flash photolysis exciting at 532 nm in Ar saturated toluene. Transient absorption spectra of P3N3Zn at 0.5 μs is also shown for comparison. 
 Fig. 9  The transient kinetic decays of P3N3Zn (black) and P3N3Zn–FPY mixture (red) probed at 490 nm (panel a). Panel b for FPY (blue) and P3N3Zn–FPY mixture (red) at 710 nm. The excitation wavelength used for both the panels is 532 nm. 
Thus, the decrease of triplet absorption intensity and lifetime of both the P3N3Zn (Fig. 9a) and FPY (Fig. 9b) in the mixture support the hypothesis that intermolecular electron transfer could happen in the triplet states of both the P3N3Zn and FPY.39 Such a photochemical event of intermolecular electron transfer occurring in the triplet state is consistent with early observation of similar systems. For example, D'Souza et al.39 studied on self-assembled donor–acceptor complexes by axial coordination of zinc tetraphenylporphyrin with different fulleropyrrolidine derivatives. There was electron transfer from the singlet state and triplet state of zinc porphyrin to the fulleropyrrolidine derivative in non-coordinating and coordinating solvent, respectively.39 Finally based on our experimental observations from fluorescence lifetime and laser flash photolysis, the different possibilities of photochemical events of inter- (black) and intra- (green) molecular electron transfer in the self-assembled donor–acceptor complexes formed between P3N3Zn and FPY are proposed in Fig. 10. In the P3N3Zn–FPY mixture, the decrease of fluorescence intensity and increase of the amplitude of the short-lived component support the possibility of electron transfer within the intramolecular complex in the singlet state. Also the decrease of triplet state absorbance and lifetime of both the P3N3Zn and FPY could support the intermolecular electron transfer occurring in the triplet state.

4. Summary
Self-assembled donor–acceptor complexes were constructed using multiple porphyrin arrays on cyclophosphazene and pyridinated fulleropyrrolidine. The FPY formed a coordinated complex with P3N3Zn and relatively fast charge-separation processes occurred in this system. The insertion of zinc metal decreased radiative pathway to quench the fluorescence quantum yield. Simultaneously, the triplet quantum yield is decreased either due to the formation of different low-lying charge transfer states and increase of non-planarity of the porphyrin moieties or due to the enhanced rate of back intersystem crossing. In addition, laser flash photolysis experiments revealed the event of intermolecular electron transfer occurring in the triplet states of both the P3N3Zn and FPY. We believe that these results could help to understand the energy and electron transfer processes in the multiple photosynthetic centers and cyclophosphazene based multiporphyrin arrays, which can be considered as artificial photosynthetic models.
