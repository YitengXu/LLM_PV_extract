    , Accepted 9th February 2023First published on 9th February 2023AbstractMild thermal stimulation in vivo could induce osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). In this study, nano-functionalized photothermal extracellular matrix (ECM) nanocomposite films were obtained through adding graphene during cell culture, so that graphene could directly integrate with the ECM secreted by cells. Owing to the similarity of the ECM to the in vivo microenvironment and the apparent photothermal effect of graphene nanoflakes, heat could be generated and transferred at the material–cell interface in a biomimetic way. It was demonstrated that such nanocomposite films achieved an interface temperature rise with light illumination. This could be easily sensed by BMSCs through the ECM. According to alkaline phosphatase, osteogenic related gene expression, mineral deposition, and upregulated expression of heat shock protein (HSP70) and p-ERK, composite films with proper illumination significantly promoted the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts. This work endeavors to study the thermal regulation of BMSC differentiation and provide a new perspective on biocompatible osteo-implant materials which can be remotely controlled.
1. Introduction
Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have self-renewal capacity and multiple-differentiation potential,1 so they are considered to be ideal osteogenic seed cells applied to regenerative tissue engineering. There are many factors affecting the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. It is generally believed that complex biochemical signals, which are composed of many cytokines2–4 and extracellular functional proteins,5 regulate the proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs.6 However, in recent years, many studies have indicated that appropriate physical field stimulation, such as mechanical factors,7 an electric field,8 a magnetic field,9 heat treatment,10 and so on, can also induce the differentiation of BMSCs to osteoblasts.
The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in regulating stem cell functions.11 It not only provides attachment sites and structural support, but also contains a lot of biological clues for cells, which determine cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and regulation of gene expression.12,13 The primary constituents of the ECM include fibrillar proteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and matricellular proteins.14 One or some isolated ECM components such as collagen,15 fibronectin,16 or laminin,17 which have partial biological properties, are attempted to be fabricated as biomaterials in regenerative tissue engineering. Each component of the ECM has a specific function on cell growth,14 which means only one isolated component may fail to simulate the whole complex microenvironment. Therefore, it is more meaningful to use a completely natural ECM as a biomaterial source.
The ECM can be classified into two groups by its source: tissue-/organ-derived ECM18 and cell-derived ECM.19 The latter is considered to have better biological activity, becoming one of the current research focuses of bone regeneration.20,21 Several studies have shown that a cell-derived ECM can be used as a filler material for bone tissue regeneration22 and ectopic bone formation23 or be used as a component for modification on the material surface.24 Li et al.25 obtained the ECM secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and used polystyrene as a control, proving that the cell-derived ECM can effectively inhibit the differentiation of bone marrow monocytes to osteoclasts, which was beneficial for bone repair. Antich et al.26 prepared a new biomimetic hydrogel for cartilage tissue engineering using a BMSC-derived ECM as the raw material and the hydrogel can induce the cartilage differentiation of MSCs without adding any differentiation-inducing factors. Yang et al.27 reported that when the substrates with specific topography were covered with a cell-derived ECM, they significantly further enhanced osteogenic differentiation.
As mentioned above, in addition to the ECM which is rich in biochemical clues, appropriate physical stimulation is another way to promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Among them, heat stress is a physical field with pro-osteogenic potential. The exposure of cells to mild heat stress (39–42.5 °C) was reported to enhance alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization in hMSCs.28 Similar results were also demonstrated in vivo by Serrat et al.29 It is generally believed that the regulation of heat stress on cells is related to heat shock proteins.30,31 When cells are exposed to heat stress, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), which is highly conserved and stably expressed in cells, increases its expression rapidly to regulate protein activity, mediate protein movement, and maintain a protein self-stabilizing system.10,28,32 Aiming to investigate the interaction between HSP70 and osteogenesis of hMSCs, Chen et al.10 reported that HSP70 promoted the osteogenesis of hMSCs through activation of the ERK signaling pathway. However, hyperthermia may cause cellular damage. In fact, hyperthermia has been used widely as a physical therapy for tumors,33–35 which indicates that its damage to normal cells needs to be considered when it comes to its use in bone defect restoration. Considering this, thermal stimulation materials were needed to confine thermal effects to specific regions.
A nano-photothermal material is a good heat-generating material that can be remotely driven by light.36–38 For example, Ge et al.39 synthesized two-dimensional (2D) quasi-freestanding and fully biodegradable germanene nanosheets, which feature intriguing physiochemical properties for photo-triggered therapeutics and photoacoustic diagnostic imaging with excellent biocompatibility. The research of Wang et al.40 demonstrated that Ti2O3 nanoparticles have good performance of photothermal conversion, benefiting from their nano size and narrow bandgap, and they exhibit strong light absorption and have nearly 100% internal solar-thermal conversion efficiency. In the biomedical field, at present, the application of nanophotothermal materials is mainly in the anti-cancer and anti-bacterial treatment.41–45 However, nanophotothermal materials also hold great promise for tissue repair. Compared with other heat generation methods, heat generated by nanophotothermal materials is easier to be confined in a specific area, and its heat generation can be regulated by the time and intensity of illumination.
In this work, a photothermal nanocomposite film with graphene and the ECM was designed and prepared. The ECM not only acted as a substrate for the composite of graphene, but also contained a large amount of biological information, which was very conducive to cell growth and osteogenesis, ensuring excellent biocompatibility of the nanocomposite film. Owing to the photothermal effect of graphene,42,46,47 the composite film achieved an obvious temperature rise on the surface after illumination and only the cells on it were thermally stimulated. A light-emitting diode (LED) was used to eliminate the interference of thermal effects of light itself, making sure that the heat BMSCs sensed was all from the photothermal effect of the film. On this basis, this work investigated the effects of ECM components and photothermal effects on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and analyzed related mechanisms.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of Gr/ECM and ECM films
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH3T3, ATCC) were cultured to obtain an abundant extracellular matrix. Briefly, the mouse fibroblasts were seeded on a 24-well plate at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well and cultured under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C for a week. The medium was high glucose type Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) which contained 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 1% L-glutamine (Gibco), and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco). The medium was replaced every two days, and graphene aqueous solution (0.5 mg mL−1, few-layer graphene, XFNANO) in different volumes (20 μL, 60 μL, 100 μL) was added to prepare the composite films (LG-ECM, MG-ECM, HG-ECM). After carefully rinsing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Cellmax) and ultrapure water in turn, cell sheets compounded with graphene (Gr) were obtained. Cellular components were removed while the ECM remained through repeated freeze–thaw cycling treatment. The cell sheet was frozen at −80 °C in ultrapure water for 1 h, thawed at room temperature, and washed with ultrapure water. The freeze–thaw cycles were repeated 3 times. Finally, the Gr/ECM film was acquired and stored at −20 °C. The preparation of the pure ECM film followed similar experimental procedures without the addition of graphene. To study cell behaviors on the Gr/ECM and ECM films, the films were placed on the Ti substrates (99.9% Ti, 10 mm × 10 mm in width, 0.5 mm in thickness) and kept at 37 °C for 12 h to dry.
2.2. Characterization of Gr/ECM and ECM films
The distribution of graphene in the film was observed under an optical microscope (Nexcope, NIB900). A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi SU-70, working voltage at 3 kV) was used to observe the surface topography of various films. To explore the vertical distribution of graphene, the film was first immunofluorescence stained which was described in detail as our previous work,48 and then imaged with a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) (Zeiss LSM 780, Germany).
The chemical composition of different films was characterized by Fourier infrared spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher, Nicolet 5700) and laser confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw, inVia-Reflex). For further quantitative analysis of the content of components in various films, samples were dissolved in 1% SDS solution for 24 h. The total protein was detected using a BCA kit (Thermo scientific), and the total graphene was detected using a UV spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu).
To evaluate the photothermal performance of the nanocomposite films, an LED with a power density of 80 W m−2 was employed and the temperature change was recorded using an infrared camera (Flir E4).
2.3. Cell culture
Three-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to isolate BMSCs. In brief, BMSCs were collected from the femurs and tibias and then cultured in a growth medium containing low glucose type Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco). Cells were incubated under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The third and fourth passage cells were used in the following cell behavior experiments. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for Care and Use of Zhejiang University and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College.
2.4. Cell morphology
The BMSCs were seeded on the films placed in 24 well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well. After incubation for 1 or 3 days, the culture medium was removed. The cells were washed three times with PBS and stained with Calcein-AM (Dojindo) at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, samples were washed with PBS and observed by inverted fluorescence microscopy (NIB900, Nexcope).
2.5. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay
The BMSCs were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well and cultured for 1, 3, and 5 days. At the abovementioned time point, the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to determine the cell attachment and proliferation. Briefly, a sample with cells on it was washed and the growth medium containing 10% CCK-8 (Dojindo) solution was added and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 450 nm.
2.6. Photothermal stimulation
The cells on nanocomposite films were periodically exposed to LED light (80 W m−2) once a week or three times a week for 5, 10, or 20 minutes. After treatment, the medium was changed and samples were cultured under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The ECM film was treated with the same periodical photothermal stimulation for comparison.
2.7. Osteogenesis assays of BMSCs
The BMSCs were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well; photothermal stimulation was employed as mentioned above. The cells on the ECM or Gr/ECM films without stimulation were set as control groups. After incubation for 7 days, samples were washed with PBS three times and transferred to a new 24-well plate. The proteins inside the cells were harvested with cell lysis buffer (Sigma). The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was determined using a commercial phosphatase substrate kit (Beyotime).
The expression levels of osteogenic-related genes (ALP, Runx-2, Col-I, and OCN) of BMSCs were measured through the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. After culturing for 7 and 14 days, the total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher) and the cDNA was reverse transcribed from 1.0 μg of RNA. qRT-PCR was conducted on the Roche LightCycler 480 system with an SYBR Green I matermix. The expression levels of the target genes were normalized to that of the reference gene β-actin. The primers for qRT-PCR are shown in Table S1.†
As a sign of late osteogenic expression, extracellular matrix mineralization was observed by staining with alizarin red S after 14 and 21 days. In brief, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed with deionized water. Then, they were immersed in 300 μL of 2% alizarin red S (Sigma) solution for 60 min. After washing several times with deionized water to remove nonspecific bonding, samples were transferred to a new 24-well plate. The stain was desorbed with 10% hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate (Aladdin) for 30 min and the absorbance was measured at 560 nm.
2.8. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression with western blotting and ELISA kit
Cells were lysed at the fifth day after stimulation. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels for 2 h at 100 V and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween20 (TBST), the membranes were incubated with anti-HSP70 (Abcam, 1:10000) or anti-GAPDH (Abcam, 1:10000) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After washing in TBST four times (5 min each), the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, Thermo Pierce, 1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing five times with TBST, we detected proteins using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) blotting reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. An X-ray film was placed in the cartridge for development and fixed after exposure for 5–10 min. The band intensity was quantified using ImageJ software.
For further quantitative analysis on the expression of HSP70 on the different nanocomposite films after stimulation, a Rat HSP-70 ELISA kit (DECO1326) was used to evaluate the protein at 3 h, 1 d, and 5 d after 10 min-photothermal stimulation, following the manufacturer's instruction. HSP70 expression in pg/μg was presented as a ratio of the HSP70 concentration normalized by the total protein concentration of the same sample.
2.9. p-ERK expression by western blotting
Cells were harvested at 24 h after stimulation. The related WB procedure was the same as that mentioned above, except that the primary antibodies were replaced by anti-ERK (CST, 1:1000), anti-p-ERK (CST, 1:1000), and anti-GAPDH (Abcam, 1:10000) antibodies at 4 °C.
2.10. Statistical analysis
All measurements were expressed as mean standard deviation. Statistical analyses were carried out by analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and Scheffe's post hoc test with the software (SPSS 20.0, p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant) for multiple comparison tests. All results were experimentally replicated, with three or more parallel samples.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of the ECM and Gr/ECM film
As shown in Fig. 1, the Gr/ECM and ECM films were prepared. As observed by optical microscopy (Fig. 2a) and SEM (Fig. 2b), graphene was found to be uniformly dispersed on the surface of the Gr/ECM films. Due to the distribution of graphene, the surface of nanocomposite films exhibited a rugged appearance, compared with the smooth surface of the ECM film. Through immunofluorescence staining of collagen I, which was the main composition in the extracellular matrix, a z-axis layer scan of the LG-ECM was performed by CLSM to observe the vertical distribution of graphene in it. According to Fig. S1,† graphene could be observed at different heights, indicating that graphene is effectively distributed not only on the surface, but also inside of the whole film.

Graphene, as a two-dimensional nanomaterial, has been reported to absorb light and has a significant photothermal effect.49,50 In this work, graphene nanoflakes were added during in vitro cell culture, so that they could directly conjugate with the ECM secreted by the cells and eventually functionalize the ECM with the photothermal effect at the nanoscale. As shown in Fig. S2a,† as the concentration of graphene aqueous solution increased, the absorption of light at the same wavelength increased. In this way, nanocomposite films were dissolved in 1% SDS solution for 24 h and determined for the UV-vis absorption spectra. 480, 660, and 808 nm were chosen to determine the final content of graphene in various composite films. The main component of the ECM was protein, so the BCA kit was used to detect the total protein content of the film, estimating the mass of the ECM, and MGr per protein (shown in Fig. 3a) was used to describe the composition ratio of Gr/ECM. The relative content of graphene in LG-ECM, MG-ECM and HG-ECM increased sequentially, indicating that the graphene content in the composite film can be adjusted by the amount of graphene solution added during film preparation. Raman and FTIR spectra were used to further confirm that not only grapheme, but also the ECM was effectively compounded in the Gr/ECM films (shown in Fig. 3b and c). As expected, the absorption peaks of amide I, amide II, and amide III at 1654, 1451, and 1232 cm−1 were observed respectively, which represented the presence of ECM proteins. In the Raman spectra, the G peak, the main characteristic peak of graphene, was clearly observed at 1580 cm−1, as well as the D peak (the disorder peak) at 1350 cm−1. With the increased concentration, the graphene defect density (ID/IG) increased from 0.64 in LG-ECM to 0.85 in HG-ECM, and the G′ peak which was used to characterize the number of layers was no longer detected in the MG-ECM and HG-ECM. The results of this part showed that graphene was chemically bonded to proteins to make the combination of the two more stable. Graphene nanoflakes could be taken up by NIH3T3 cells through endocytosis-based or direct cytoplasmic pathways,51 and then integrated with the ECM and secreted out of cells. In such a way, the ECM was functionalized at the nanoscale with graphene nanoflakes.

3.2. Effect of Gr/ECM films on the behaviors of BMSCs
Calcein-AM staining and CCK-8 assay (Fig. 4a and b) were used to evaluate the adhesion and proliferation of BMSCs on various samples. After 1 day of cultivation, the cells on the ECM showed spindle-like morphology, which suggested good cell spreading of BMSCs. According to the staining images and CCK-8 assay after 3 or 5 days of cultivation, excellent proliferation was also observed on the ECM film. As mentioned above, the ECM contains much biological clues for cells, which determine cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and regulation of gene expression. Compared with pure collagen (Fig. S3†), the ECM with complex components was more conducive to cell proliferation and early osteogenic differentiation, which meant that the ECM film was indeed a more appropriate substrate material to fix graphene to prepare the nanocomposite film. As for the Gr/ECM films, their biocompatibility was not as good as that of the ECM, probably due to the effect of additionally treated graphene. However, in general, BMSCs on the three kinds of composite films all showed significant proliferation within 5 days, indicating that the Gr/ECM films did not exhibit cytotoxicity or inhibit cell growth. It is worth mentioning that LG-ECM ensured good cell proliferation and improved the ALP activity of BMSCs, which was even higher than that of the ECM group. This pro-osteogenic effect might be due to the granular micro-nano morphology of the Gr/ECM films, which has been mentioned in some previous studies.52,53

3.3. Effects of the photothermal effect by Gr/ECM films on the behaviors of BMSCs
The experimental illumination equipment was homemade as shown in Fig. 5a, and each sample corresponded to one lamp bead for equal illumination. The photothermal properties of the ECM and Gr/ECM films were evaluated under exposure to LED light (80 W m−2). The interface temperature was considered as the temperature change experienced by the cells on it in subsequent experiments. Fig. 5c shows that there was a significant temperature rise on the surface of the nanocomposite films after illumination. It increased rapidly in the first 20 minutes, and then tended to be stable. The surface of nanocomposite films could be heated by 5.7–7.2 °C in 20 minutes. In addition, the higher the graphene content in the film, the higher the temperature evaluated. The pure ECM film also had a temperature rise of 2.9 °C, which might be due to light's own unavoidable thermal effect.

The photothermal heating curves of the culture medium immersed with or without (blank) films were also detected (Fig. S4†). Similarly, because of light's own thermal effect, in addition to the medium immersed with the Gr/ECM nanocomposite films, the medium with the ECM or even nothing had a little temperature rise after illumination. It is worth mentioning that under the same illumination for 20 minutes, the interface temperature change of the film between LG-ECM and HG-ECM had a difference of 1.5 °C (shown in Fig. 5c), while the medium immersed with LG-ECM or HG-ECM had a gap of only 0.5 °C (shown in Fig. S4†). It proved that the photothermal films achieved a direct temperature change on the interface after illumination, which was significantly different from the surrounding environment. The nanocomposite film warmed up and transferred heat to the medium, which explained why the temperature change of the medium in the Gr/ECM composite films was higher and that of the HG-ECM group was the highest.
Taking the damage caused by heat shock into account, cell viability was quantified at 6 h, 1 d, and 3 d after 10 min-photothermal stimulation on the different nanocomposite films by using the CCK-8 assay. The OD value (Fig. 5d) confirmed that the group with light was lower than the control group at the same film and treated time. Overall, the photothermal effect caused the proliferation rate of stem cells to decrease, but not to the extent of inhibition. Thus, such photothermal stimulation was allowed for subsequent cell behavior studies. Not only BMSCs, NIH3T3 and MC3T3-E1 also demonstrated cell damage by heat shock. NIH3T3, as a soft tissue cell, has the greatest impact at 1 h after 10 min photothermal stimulation, with a mortality rate of up to 32.9%, while that of BMSCs was 22.6% and that of MC3T3-E1 was only 9.2% (Table S2†). It showed that traditional heating strategies like direct heating, microwave heating, or photothermic heating would damage the surrounding normal cells. Therefore, it was very meaningful to ensure that the temperature rise was only achieved at the targeted area by using the photothermal Gr/ECM nanocomposite film.
In order to study the osteogenesis performance of BMSCs with different photothermal stimulation, several illumination methods were designed by adjusting the stimulation duration and frequency (shown as Fig. 5b). ALP activity, as a marker of early osteogenic differentiation, was evaluated after culturing for 7 days. As shown in Fig. 6, compared with the control group and other photothermally stimulated groups, BMSCs on the composite films showed a significant and optimal improvement of ALP activity with photothermal stimulation for 10 minutes. Maybe it was too short to achieve the desired level of thermal stimulation; there was just a slight increase after illumination for 5 minutes. However, ALP activity was almost constant or even falling with exposure for 20 minutes, compared to the non-illuminated group. The result indicated that excessively high temperature stimulation resulted in cell shock and even cell necrosis. The LG-ECM film performed more excellently than other films with stimulation for 10 minutes. Based on this, the stimulation frequency was researched subsequently. The results in Fig. 6b indicated that weekly stimulation frequency (once a week) was optimal for the LG-ECM film, while the ECM film needed to be stimulated several times a week to have an effect of promoting osteogenic differentiation. Obviously, the nanocomposite film had better stimulation efficiency.

Mineralization of BMSCs cultured on different composite films was quantified by alizarin red staining after 14 days and 21 days (shown as Fig. 7) with the treatment of 10-minute photothermal stimulation once a week. Considering the presence of the extracellular matrix in the film and its own mineralization composition, an experimental group was set up without cells being seeded to eliminate the interference. Under the same cultivation conditions, mineralization of both ECM and LG-ECM was also detected. However, their OD value was much lower than that of the experimental groups with cells seeded (Fig. S6†), so the interference caused by it could be negligible. A statically significant difference in mineralization was observed between the control group and the photothermally stimulated group in both the ECM and Gr/ECM nanocomposite films. Meanwhile, the nanocomposite films displayed much more mineral deposition in BMSCs than that in the pure ECM film. In general, the mineralization results in the middle and late stages of osteogenesis were generally in accordance with the ALP results in the early stage of osteogenesis.

Based on the best stimulation conditions, the BMSCs on the LG-ECM with or without illumination were quantitatively assessed by qRT-PCR for the expressions of osteogenesis-related genes (ALP, Runx-2, Col-I, and OCN). The results (Fig. 8) showed that after photothermal stimulation all gene expression was significantly up-regulated at the 14th day except that of ALP, probably because ALP was an early marker of osteogenic differentiation and it truly increased at the 7th day. At the same time, the ECM film as a control showed a consistent trend due to the unavoidable thermal effects of light, which helped in proving the promotion of osteogenic differentiation by heat. In general, proper photothermal stimulation together with the composite film indeed induced differentiation of BMSCs to osteoblasts from the early to late stage of cell differentiation.

3.4. Effects of the photothermal effect of Gr/ECM nanocomposite films on the expression of HSP70
HSP70 will be up-regulated under heat shock; therefore, it is a potential pathway by which the photothermal effect affects osteogenic differentiation. The BMSCs on the samples with or without illumination were quantitatively determined by ELISA for the expression of HSP70 at 3 h, 1 d, and 5 d after stimulation. Fig. 9a shows that the HSP70 expression on the nanocomposite films increased more than that on the pure ECM film at 3 h, while the expression was almost the same on all films without illumination. HSP70 degraded with time, but the expression of the photothermally stimulated group was still higher than that of the control group. Combined with western blot analysis (Fig. 9b and c), it could be deduced that BMSCs on the nanocomposite film truly sensed the heat stimulation. The higher the temperature sensed by the cells, the more the HSP70 expressed.

3.5. Effects of the photothermal effect of Gr/ECM nanocomposite films on the expression of p-ERK and the entire mechanism
Furthermore, the relationship between heat stress and osteogenic differentiation needs to be clarified. p-ERK, which was involved in a signaling pathway associated with the osteogenesis of stem cells,54,55 might be a potential pathway affected by HSP70. As shown in Fig. 10a and b, the expression of p-ERK on LG-ECM was significantly up-regulated after illumination, consistent with the HSP70 expression revealed above. Therefore, it could be speculated that the increase of HSP70 activated the expression of p-ERK, which promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. However, the expression of p-ERK on HG-ECM decreased, while its HSP70 expression increased. This indicated that excessive HSP expression caused by excessive temperature might inhibit the expression of p-ERK instead.

As generally considered, under heat stress, the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) transferred to the nucleus to bind to the corresponding promoter to initiate the transcription of the HSP gene.56,57 The increased portion of HSP70 activated the p-ERK expression and somehow promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. On the other hand, as heat stress might impair the structure of the protein,58 the HSP70 protein had the ability to bind to the damaged protein, providing an opportunity for their refolding or degradation and regulating the intracellular environment to adapt to external stress.59 Based on this, it could be speculated that BMSCs on HG-ECM suffered from too much heat to survive under the same illumination conditions, causing large amounts of damaged proteins. HSP70 tended to bind to damaged proteins to maintain intracellular homeostasis, leaving the osteogenesis signaling pathway aside temporarily. Although heat stress induced osteogenesis, once the stimulation was beyond the range that the cells could withstand, the effect was counterproductive. Therefore, proper heat stress was of great importance. In our study, BMSCs on the LG-ECM film were mildly photothermally stimulated after 10-minute-illumination, with few damaged proteins required HSP70 to regulate. Therefore, the increased expression of HSP70 under heat stress preferred to activate the expression of p-ERK and promote osteogenesis finally.
4. Discussion
Graphene was used as a nano-photothermally functionalized material to modify the cell-derived extracellular matrix, thereby constructing an interface that can simulate the cellular microenvironment and simultaneously produce the photothermal signal. The results of material characterization (Fig. 2, 3, S1 and S2†) showed that the Gr/ECM composite film had a good combination of Gr and ECM, and exhibited good photothermal properties in subsequent performance tests (Fig. 5c), indicating the success of nano-photothermal functionalization. Notably, this nano-photothermal functionalization process was designed to take place during ECM formation, rather than combination after ECM formation. It allowed nano-photothermal materials to be integrated into the ECM by cells themselves, and thus the process of photothermal functionalization would not affect the structure or composition of the ECM as much as possible. Of course, as one of the commonly used nano-photothermal materials, graphene could be replaced by other materials of similar size and properties, such as black phosphorus nanosheets60 and gold nanoparticles.61 Furthermore, this innovative way of extracellular matrix functionalization can be extended to other external fields such as a magnetic field and electric field, as long as the particles with the corresponding external field properties are of suitable size and non-cytotoxic. In addition, these nanocomposites must be safely metabolizable in vivo, as potential degradation of the ECM after long-term implantation could detach the composite nanoparticles from the film.
As for the selection of the ECM, the osteoblast-related ECM has better osteogenic activity and is theoretically more suitable for this work. However, these cells secrete less ECM and are unable to form membranes alone. Compared to osteoblast-related cells, the fibroblast-derived ECM was reported to have more secretion and better collagen orientation,14,62 and thus were more easily formed into complete sheets for the composite of nanomaterials. Moreover, the NIH3T3-derived ECM was also shown to have good biocompatibility and osteogenic activity in our previous studies,63,64 and thus was used in this work for the composite of graphene. In addition, as changes in the composition of the culture medium might alter the ECM proteomic constituents,65 the long-term presence of graphene in the culture medium might also potentially affect the ECM formation. Therefore, we added graphene for compounding on the sixth day of NIH3T3 culture to better mimic the cellular microenvironment, preventing the amount and composition of ECM secretion from being affected as much as possible.
Subsequent cell experiments (Fig. 4) showed that the addition of Gr generally reduced the original excellent biocompatibility of the ECM. Combined with the photothermal properties of various composite groups, it could be concluded that as the degree of photothermal functionalization increased (Gr content increased), the biological properties of the ECM itself suffered more losses, which might be due to the inevitable coverage of the ECM by Gr. Among them, LG-ECM was obviously an appropriate experimental group, which not only retained a large degree of adhesion and proliferation derived from the ECM, but also had better osteogenic differentiation properties than the ECM, which was due to its appropriate surface morphology.
The results of the photothermal effect on cell behavior (Fig. 5–8) showed that various films, including the ECM film, could have a significant effect on promoting osteogenic differentiation under the appropriate illumination time and frequency. Based on the results of osteogenic differentiation and mineralization, the LG-ECM in the composite film had the best osteogenic and good mineralization effect under illumination, which was higher than that of the ECM control group. There were two notable results in this section. On the one hand, the ECM also showed some photothermal effect under illumination, which was caused by the inevitable heating of the medium by the light itself. However, because of its poorer thermogenic effect, the ECM required higher frequency and longer illumination exposure to obtain its best osteogenic differentiation effect, and the optimal osteogenic effect was slightly worse than that of the LG-ECM. On the other hand, and more importantly, the photothermal effect had a certain damage to cell viability, and this damage was also obviously related to the amount of the photothermal effect. Therefore, illumination parameters need to be carefully controlled to achieve optimal bone repair without compromising the tissue viability.
When applied in vivo, the control of light intensity may become even more important because immune cells in bone tissue are also heat responsive, and macrophages can affect osteogenesis through the osteoimmune process.66 Many studies have shown that excessive thermal effects can cause the activation of M1 polarization of macrophages, which subsequently creates a pro-inflammatory environment.67,68 This will facilitate the clearance of dead cells or toxins in the early stage of bone repair, but interfere with bone repair in the later stage. Therefore, by controlling the photothermal intensity at different periods to construct a cellular microenvironment that is pro-anti-inflammatory in the early stage and pro-osteogenic in the later stage, it will have better results in potential in vivo applications.
HSP70 and ERK1/2 were used to explain the effects of photothermal stimulation on cell behaviors, including the promotion of osteogenic differentiation by appropriate illumination and the inhibition of differentiation or cell viability caused by excessive photothermal stimulation. The photothermal effect triggered the upregulation of HSP70 and potential protein damage. Appropriate levels of photothermal stimulation induced the upregulation of HSP70 with less protein damage, and HSP70 promoted osteogenic differentiation via the ERK1/2 pathway, through upregulating p-ERK. If the heat generated by the photothermal effect was too much, HSP70 would increase and more cellular proteins would also be damaged. HSP70 first combined to the damaged protein, and the expression of p-ERK was down-regulated, which made the osteogenic differentiation inhibited.
In general, a creative preparation method was provided for the nano-photothermal functionalization of the extracellular matrix, which offered a reference for the design of the external field functionalization of biomimetic materials. After appropriate illumination stimulation, the heat generated by the photothermal effect of the nanocomposite film could synergize with its ECM microenvironment to promote the osteogenic differentiation and subsequent mineralization of BMSCs. Therefore, as a flexible film driven with a non-contact external field, it had the potential to be applied on the surface of in vivo implant materials for modification. Furthermore, the idea of the photothermal effect and a simulated microenvironment to coordinately regulate cells in this work can provide ideas for subsequent bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Of course, based on this work, it is also a promising idea to change nanocomposites for the ultrasonic-heat functionalization or magnetic-heat functionalization of the ECM.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, through the successful integration of graphene nanoflakes and the ECM during an in vitro cell culture process, this study innovatively achieved nano-functionalized photothermal ECM films with good biocompatibility. The photothermal effect of the nanocomposite film was well controlled, which was manifested with the rapid and obvious heating of the surface and the minimal heating of the surrounding liquid after illumination. In our study, the nanocomposite film with photothermal stimulation directly exerted effective heat stress on the BMSCs, influencing the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The LG-ECM nanocomposite film on illuminating 10 minutes once a week showed excellent performance on osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, different photothermal stimulation determined different heat stress on BMSCs. Therefore, the expression of HSP70 and p-ERK differed for various groups, which influenced the osteogenic related signaling pathway and regulated cellular responses in the end. At the appropriate photothermal stimulus intensity, the damaged proteins in BMSCs were present as few as possible, allowing more HSP70 to participate in the osteogenic signaling pathway. This work endeavored to provide a new perspective on biocompatible osteo-implant materials which can be remotely controlled in vivo, having great importance in the field of bone regeneration.
