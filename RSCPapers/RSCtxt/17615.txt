Preparation, characterization and stability towards salt(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )D. Neil Furlong, Anton Launikonis, Wolfgang H. F. Sasse and John V. SandersAbstractStable aqueous colloidal platinum sols have been prepared by the citrate reduction of chloroplatinic acid. Particle size at the completion of the reaction was found to increase with increased heat input during reduction. The u.v.–visible spectrum of the platinum sols depends upon particle size up to 4 nm. A stirring–centrifugation procedure was used to identify the extent of coagulation induced by added electrolytes. It was found that the smaller platinum particles required higher concentrations of added electrolyte before being destabilized. A survey was made of the coagulation of the platinum sols induced by mono-, di- and tri-valent cations.Hydrogen treatment of platinum sols leads to growth of particles up to a maximum size of ca. 5 nm and substantial linkage of primary particles to form extensive aggregates. Such growth and aggregation lead to significant changes in the u.v.–visible spectra and reduced resistance to electrolyte-induced coagulation.
