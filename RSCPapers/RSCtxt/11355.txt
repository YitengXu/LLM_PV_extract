    , Accepted 17th March 2023First published on 18th March 2023AbstractIn recent years, tridentate nitrogen donor ligands have played a vital role in inorganic chemistry. The ease of synthesis, readily modifiable structure and high stability of 1,3-bis(2-pyridylimino)isoindole (BPIs) compounds make them suitable candidates for many potential applications. In this study, a 1,3-bis(2-pyridylimino)isoindoline derivative bearing a naphthoxy unit and its palladium complex (PdBPI) were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, NMR, FT-IR, UV–Vis, and mass spectroscopic methods. The BPI- or PdBPI-modified pencil graphite electrodes were clarified via cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDX, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The efficiency of these substances in a vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) system was investigated for the first time. The behaviors of the BPI-modified carbon felt electrode (BPI-CF) and PdBPI-modified carbon felt electrode (PdBPI-CF) were investigated in the redox flow battery (RFB) applications. These modified electrodes were obtained by the electrodeposition method. The respective charge potentials of BPI-CF and PdBPI-CF reached 1.63 V and 1.88 V, respectively. The discharge capacity maxima obtained were ∼301 mA h (1204 mA h L−1) and ∼303 mA h (1212 mA h L−1) for BPI-CF and PdBPI-CF at the VRB system under a charge current density of 4.0 mA cm−2 and discharge current density of 0.4 mA cm−2, respectively.
Introduction
Meridionally coordinating tridentate ligands are well-known as pincer ligands that have been thoroughly investigated in inorganic and molecular catalysis.1–4 Isoindoline and its derivatives play a critical role in the development of phthalocyanine-like chemicals, novel chromophores, and metal chelates.5–11 Pincer ligands include two merged metal cycles with two side arms stabilizing the complex and have a massive effect on its electrical characteristics.12,13 Bis(pyridyl) iminoisoindoline (BPI) is a pincer-type isoindoline derivative that has been of interest in transition metal-containing complexes. Due to the presence of expanded delocalized π-systems, these compounds are extremely planar and can be modified by adding a substituent group on the isoindole units and/or inserting groups through the pyridine ring.14,15 The N–N–N type triangular ligand is one of the common planar coordinated BPI compounds.16,17 The N–H proton resonates on the isoindole unit, and the intramolecular hydrogen bonds make these compounds sensitive to changes in cellular media. Therefore, these BPIs are used as “sensitive” materials for nano- and biotechnological applications.18–20
The long-term uncontrolled use of fossil fuels has resulted in increasing energy crises and environmental problems in recent years.21,22 However, renewable wind, solar, and tidal energy sources are eco-friendly energy origins that can replace fossil energy. Although the intermittent and changeable nature of these renewable energies limit their effective utility for electricity grids, an energy storage system can be employed by converting chemical and electrical energy that functions as the primary medium for adjusting energy production and overcomes the stated problems.23,24 The system versatility, variable design, rapid time-interval, and gainful upkeep costs are parameters that make the redox flow battery (RFB) a considerable candidate. The vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) is the most common of the many redox flow batteries. The vanadium ions with diverse chemical valence states are utilized as active redox reaction types, significantly preventing metal ion cross-contamination via the membrane.25–32 Despite VRB's advantages, its overall potential is 1.26 V and the vanadium (5) ions tend to collapse above 40 °C when used as a positive electrode.33
The chemical reactions of VRB are given below.34
Positive electrolyte: VO2+ + H2O ⇌ VO2+ + 2H+ + e− E° = 1.00 V(1)
Negative electrolyte: V3+ + e− ⇌ V2+ E° = −0.26 V(2)
Overall reactions: VO2+ + H2O + V3+ ⇌ VO2+ + 2H+ + V2+ E° = 1.26 V(3)
During the discharge process, the V(5) ions are reduced to the V(4) ions at the positive electrode. Water and two protons are also involved in electrochemical reactions to maintain charge balance, along with the transfer of an electron. On the other hand, the V(2) ions are oxidized to the V(3) ions at the negative electrode, and an electron transfer takes place here. As a result, the VRB performance is limited via the positive electrode.35 Carbon-based materials, one of the most preferred electrodes in VRB, can be used as negative electrode components. However, these materials can give rise to graphite oxidation during battery charging when used as positive electrodes.27 These issues have led to new research on VRB.
Generally, the electrode plays a substantial role in the performance of VRB systems.27,36 Many investigations are being conducted nowadays to enhance electrode function. In VRB applications, the applied electrode with robust chemical stability, high surface area, high electrical conductivity and good mechanical stability is highly preferred. One strategy for improving electrode performance is to increase the active sites and electrochemical surface area of the electrode. The use of BPI − complexes for energy storage and catalysis has become an active research area in recent years.37–40 In this study, BPI derivatives were deposited on the pencil graphite electrode (PGE) via novel electrochemical deposition and used as electrocatalysts for the first time. Large potential windows, ideal electrical/mechanical properties, low cost, easy accessibility, environmental friendliness, and relatively repeatable performance of PGE are essential factors for the utility of this carbon-based material as an electrodeposition substrate.41,42 In this research, the electrode modification was made by coating the BPI structure for the first time and on the PGE surface by electrodeposition method.
The main focus of this research is the synthesis and characterization of the bis(2-pyridylamino)isoindoline derivative bearing the naphthoxy unit and its palladium complex. All of the newly synthesized compounds were characterized using spectroscopic methods, such as single crystal X-ray diffraction, NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV–Vis, and mass spectroscopy. Their potential application as VRB for the energy field was also investigated. The novel catalyst substances were fabricated and used as new electrodes for VRB systems. The characterization of the electrodeposited electrodes was carried out via cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDX, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy.

Synthesis of the PdBPI complex
0.100 g of BPI (0.213 mmol) and 0.085 g of PdCl2 (0.221 mmol) were mixed in 5 mL of dry toluene. After adding 0.022 g of triethylamine (0.221 mmol) to this solution, the mixture was stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. The resulting palladium complex was poured into a 100 mL ice-water mixture and washed separately with water, cold hexane, and diethyl ether, and then dried in a vacuum oven. The final product was crystallized in ethanol (Fig. 1). (Yield: 79%; 0.103 g) FTIR: νmax (cm−1): 3047 (Ar–H), 2980 (alkyl–CH), 1226 (C–O–C). UV-Vis λmax (nm) (logε) in DMF: 271 (4.22), 326 (3.96), 433 (3.94), 463 (3.94). 1H-NMR (CDCl3): δ 9.67 (2H, Ar–H), 7.97–7.88 (3H, Ar–H), 7.80 (1H, Ar–H), 7.56 (1H, Ar–H), 7.51 (3H, Ar–H), 7.39 (1H, Ar–H), 7.35 (1H, Ar–H), 7.30 (2H, Ar–H), 6.87 (2H, Ar–H), 2.42–2.37 (–CH3, 6H) ppm. 13C-NMR (CDCl3): δ 161.16 (C-1), 160.27 (C-1), 153.81 (C-2), 149.23 (C-2), 147.46 (C-2), 138.09 (C-1), 134.34 (C-2), 130.74–130.32 (C-4), 127.81 (C-4), 124.16 (C-2), 120.37 (C-3), 116.02 (C-2), 111.49 (C-2), 20.94 (C-2). MS (LC-MS): m/z 612.07 [M + H]+, 574.14 [M − Cl]+. In chloroform solution, crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained.
Morphological and structural study

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were collected using either Agilent VNMRS 500 MHz spectrometer and referenced to the residual protonated solvent peak. A Bruker microflex LT MALDI-TOF MS was used to get mass analyses of BPI and PdBPI. The homogeneity of the products was tested in each step by applying thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (SiO2). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy – Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR) spectra (PerkinElmer Spectrum One FTIR-ATR) were obtained in the wave number range of 4000–650 cm−1. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Scinco SD 1000 diode array, single-beam ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer. A Renishaw inVia spectrometer with a 532 nm excitation laser, 1% laser power (0.6 mW), 40 s acquisition time, and ×50 objective lens was used to perform the Raman study. The surface morphology of the electrodes was studied via scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss-Ultra Plus). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to analyze the surface element composition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted in a Thermo Scientific K-alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer system with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source.
Crystallography study
The single crystals of BPI and PdBPI were grown by slow evaporation of their chloroform solution. The single crystals were then mounted on a micro mount and attached to a goniometer head on a Bruker D8 VENTURE diffractometer equipped with a PHOTON100 detector and measured with graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) using 1.0° of Ω and ϕ rotation frames for 5 and 0.5° Ω rotation frames for 8 at room temperature. The structures were solved by performing the intrinsic method SHELXS-1997 (Sheldrick, 1997)44 and refined by SHELXL-2014/7 (Sheldrick, 2014).45 Molecular drawings were generated using OLEX2. Ver. 1.2-dev software.46
Preparation of the electrodes
All BPI and PdBPI-modified electrodes were produced in the Gamry Reference 600 Potentiostat/Galvanostat device via the electrochemical method. A conventional standard three-electrode system was used and the pencil graphite electrode (PGE), (Tombow, HB, 0.5 mm), Ag/AgCl (in 3 M KCl), and platinum (Pt) wire were used as working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical deposition was performed on PGE with 1 × 10−3 M BPI and PdBPI in dry DCM containing 0.01 M TBAP as a supporting electrolyte under mild conditions. All electrodes prepared with both materials were prepared at once between −2.5 V and +2.5 V with a scanning speed of 20 mV s−1 and 50 cycles with the CV method. The accuracy of the coating was proven with increasing current densities. All working electrodes were washed each time with deionized water to remove possible impurities on the surface of the deposited films before and after the synthesis.
Electrochemical performance
All CV and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests for the developed electrodes were performed in a standard three-electrode system where PGE, Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl), and platinum wire were used as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. The EIS test was conducted under an open circuit potential (OCP) with an excitation signal of 10 mV in the frequency range from 104 to 10−2 Hz.
VRB performance
The cyclic charge/discharge (CCD) test was carried out by a Gamry Reference 3000 potentiostat/galvanostat (Gamry, USA) instrument. Furthermore, charge–discharge processing was performed with a FB-25 (Greenlight, Canada) model flow battery test cell. The cyclic charge–discharge tests of the battery utilized a CF electrode. Commercially available CF (porosity of 95%, specific area of 0.8 m2 g−1) with a layer thickness of (approximately) 6 mm was washed in ethanol and dried outdoors before use. After being thoroughly cleaned, the graphite felt was cut into two pieces, and both were measured 3 mm along the cross-section. Cyclic charge–discharge tests of a single battery were performed with BPI-CF and PdBPI-CF as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. In the system, a Nafion-117 membrane was utilized, and each electrode's geometrical surface area was measured to be 25 cm2. Using a peristaltic pump, 2.0 mL of the 1.5 M catholyte and anolyte solutions were pumped through the cell at a flow rate of 2.0 mL s−1.47 Before battery tests, N2 gas was bubbled to exhaust the residual O2 in the electrolyte tanks. The charge/discharge experiments were run between 0.4 V and 2.0 V with a charge current density of 4.0 mA cm−2 and a discharge current density of 0.4 mA cm−2. All tests were performed at 25 °C ± 1 °C.
The following equations described the coulombic efficiency (CE), energy efficiency (EE), and voltage efficiency (VE): CE = Qdis/Qch × 100(4) EE = Edis/Ech × 100(5) VE = EE/CE × 100(6)where Qdis is the discharge capacity (mA h), Qch is the charge capacity (mA h), Edis is the discharge energy (W h) and Ech is the charge energy (W h).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization
The naphthyloxy group-substituted bis(2-pyridylimino) isoindole (BPI) was obtained according to the synthetic procedure first described by Siegl et al.48 In this reaction, 4-(2-naphthyloxy)phthalonitrile (1) was used as a dinitrile derivative and 2-amino-4-methyl-pyridine (2) was used as an aminopyridine derivative. The synthesis of the corresponding palladium(II) complex (PdBPI) was carried out in toluene using PdCl2 as the Pd(II) salt and triethylamine as the auxiliary base.
To characterize the structure of the synthesized compounds, we performed 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, FTIR, UV-Vis, and mass spectroscopic techniques (Fig. S1–S8†). The FTIR spectra of the BPI and PdBPI compounds are consistent with the proposed structures. In the FTIR spectra of PdBPI, the formation of the metal complex was confirmed by the disappearance of N–H vibrations at 3204 cm−1 for the BPI complex. The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the BPI complex exhibited chemical shifts in CDCl3. The chemical shifts observed between 8.47–6.92 ppm (16H) correspond to the aromatic ring protons, and the chemical shift at 7.27 ppm corresponds to the deuteron solvent.49 Chemical shifts seen at 2.35 ppm (6H) indicate the presence of aliphatic group protons. The chemical shift of the N–H (1H) proton was determined at 13.94 ppm. 13C-NMR signals are found to be between 169.21–122.18 ppm (C-24), corresponding to the aromatic ring and at 20.95 ppm (C-2) assigned to the aliphatic carbon. NMR spectra of PdBPI are similar to those of its metal-free derivative. The main difference is that the N–H peak disappeared in the 1H-NMR spectrum of PdBPI. The MALDI-TOF mass spectra showed the molecular peaks at m/z = 470.83 [M + 1]+ for BPI and m/z 612.07 [M + H]+, 574.14 [M − Cl]+ for PdBPI.
The absorption spectra of BPI and PdBPI were recorded in DMF (Fig. S2†). The BPI compounds show several absorption bands between 300–425 nm that are assigned to π–π* transitions. Upon insertion of palladium into BPI, the ligand-centered (LC) π–π* transitions undergo a red-shift, while a new, low energy transition appears between 425 and 500 nm. The low energy absorption band is assigned to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer transition.50
Crystal structures characterization
The thermal ellipsoids of BPI and PdBPI are plotted in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively, showing the crystal packings of the structures. The crystal data and structure refinement parameters of BPI and PdBPI are given in Table S1.† Tables S2 and S3† contain the selected bond lengths and bond angles for BPI and PdBPI, respectively. CCDC 2068484 and 2068483† contain the supplementary crystallographic data for BPI and PdBPI, respectively. Further details on the crystal data, data collection, and refinements can be found in the ESI.† The bond lengths of BPI are in agreement with the literature51 (Table S2†) with shortened C–C and C–N distances (Table S2†) supporting the presence of conjugation throughout the whole molecule (Table 2). The C–N and CN bond lengths and the presence of the H13 atom show the presence of a monoanionic ligand. There is an intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the pyridine nitrogen (N1) and pyrrole hydrogen (N3–H13) with a distance of 2.089 Å and an angle of 121.2° (Fig. 2). In the crystal structure of PdBPI, the geometry around the palladium(II) center can be described as a distorted square planar orientation formed by three N atoms of the tridentate ligand BPI and one chlorine atom located slightly out of the plane, as previously observed in similar palladium(II) BPI complexes.39,52,53 The meridional tridentate mode has two long (Pd–N) lengths of 2.05 Å (5) and one short Pd–N length at 1.92 Å (8), and with N1–Pd–N3, N3–Pd–N5 angles of 88.9° (4) and 89.7° (4), respectively. Although the palladium atom is slightly out of the plane (0.168 Å) formed by the three nitrogen atoms (N1–N3–N5), the chlorine atom is significantly displaced (1.062 Å) from the same plane, which causes the whole complex to distort from square planar geometry. The long intramolecular bond between Cl–H7 (2.474 Å) with an angle of 125.4° (Fig. 2) can be considered a weak hydrogen bonding interaction.

Electrodeposition of BPIs on PGE
One of the innovative designs and main aims of this research is to propose a new strategy for the one-step, controlled, and in situ deposition of metal-free and palladium metal-containing BPIs on the PGE surface by electrodeposition. All of the electrodes designed and obtained on PGE from metal-free and palladium metal-containing BPIs were acquired under the same experimental conditions. Each of these structures has its distinctive features. Continuously repetitive 50 cycles of CV scans of BPI (Fig. 4a) and PdBPI (Fig. 4b) (1 × 10−3 M) in 0.01 M TBAP/DCM electrolyte solution, on the PGE surface were performed. CVs can be shown as evidence that BPIs were properly deposited on the PGE surface. When the cycles obtained as a result of the measurements are examined, the peak current increase occurring in the oxidation and reduction steps is one of the most important indicators of the steady accumulation of BPIs on the PGE surface (Fig. 4a and b).

Spectroscopic characterization
Raman spectroscopy is a characterization technique often used to investigate the structure of supramolecular materials.54,55 Raman spectra of the pristine PGE, BPI/PGE, and PGE/PdBPI electrodes (Fig. 5) were recorded in the wavenumber region 100–3500 cm−1, and each spectrum was repeated three times. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the G and 2D bands have significant peaks at 1577 cm−1 and 2685 cm−1, respectively, whereas the D band is exhibited as a weak band at 1328 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of pencil graphite.56,57
 Fig. 5  Comparison of the Raman spectra of pristine PGE, PGE/BPI and PGE/PdBPI. 
The Raman spectra demonstrate that the BPI and PdBPI structures are successfully coated on the PGE surfaces. The Raman curves shown are the average of three different points of analysis for each electrode. Raman analyses were executed to provide information about the functional groups and the electron density associated with the macrocycle. The macrocyclic vibrations observed at approximately 1110 and 1410 cm−1 in the PGE/BPI and PGE/PdBPI consequences could be assigned to the ν(CC) and δ(C–H) vibrations of the macrocycle, respectively.58 For PGE/BPI, the peaks at 1295, 1156, 1108, and 985 cm−1 are associated with the vibrations of the coordinated pyridine molecules. For PGE/PdBPI, the peaks at 1308, 1175, and 1020 cm−1 are associated with the vibrations of the coordinated pyridine molecules.59,60 For PGE/BPI and PGE/PdBPI, the vibrations corresponding to the indole molecule are observed with strong relative intensity at 1360 and 1364 cm−1, respectively.61 For PGE/BPI, the peaks appearing at 1599 and 1643 cm−1 result from the C–C bond stretching within benzene and pyrrole. For PGE/PdBPI, the peaks observed at 1646 and 1612 cm−1 result from the (C–C) bond stretching within benzene and pyrrole.54,60
Morphological characterization
SEM images were taken at different magnifications to better understand the morphological properties of PGEs prepared by modifying them with BPIs (Fig. 6a–d). When the SEM images acquired are examined, it is seen that the organometallic pincer-type ligand structures synthesized via electrochemical deposition are accumulated on the PGE surface. BPI and PdBPIs were successfully deposited on PGE, and exhibited significant surface roughness in the form of a three-dimensional structure with abundant pores on the electrode surface. For this reason, an increase in the effective electrochemically active surface area of the prepared electrodes is expected.
 Fig. 6  SEM images of PGE/BPI (a and b) and PGE/PdBPI (c and d). 
EDX analyses were performed to determine the groups functionalized with BPI and PdBPI via the electrochemical method on the PGE surface. According to the results obtained, it shows that BPI and PdBPI are successfully distributed homogeneously on the PGE electrode surfaces (Fig. S9b, and S9d†). According to the obtained and expected EDX mapping results, the Pd and Cl elements only exist in the PGE/PdBPI electrode although both structures contain C, N, and O elements.
XPS analysis was carried out to identify the chemical structure of the BPI-CF and PdBPI-CF materials. The XPS survey spectra of the BPI-CF and PdBPI-CF electrodes are shown in Fig. S10.† The peaks of C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s were observed in the XPS survey spectrum of BPI-CF (Fig. S10a†). In the survey spectrum of PdBPI-CF (Fig. S10b†), Pd 3d and Cl 2p peaks were observed in addition to the BPI-CF spectrum. This result supports the formation of the PdBPI complex. A decrease in the intensity of the N 1s attributed peak in the spectrum of PdBPI-CF was observed compared to BPI-CF. This should be related to the fact that the Pd in the complex molecule has three bonds with the N atoms, and the secondary amine group was converted to the tertiary amine in the Pd complex molecule. The N atom, which makes coordinate covalent bonds during the Pd complex synthesis, is shielded by the 3d orbitals of Pd.62,63 The C 1s (a), N 1s (b) and O 1s (c) spectra of the BPI-CF electrode are represented in Fig. 7. The peaks observed at 284.65, 285.63, 288.32 and 291.23 eV in the C 1s spectra shown in Fig. 7a were attributed to the C–C (sp2), C–O, C–N, N–CN groups, respectively.64,65 The peaks monitored at 398.11, 399.52 and 400.99 eV in the N 1s spectrum of the BPI-CF electrode indicated in Fig. 7b refer to the imine group (C–NC), pyridinic N and secondary amine (C–N–H) structures, respectively.66 The peaks examined at 531.48 and 533.43 eV in Fig. 7c belong to the O 1s spectrum of BPI-CF, respectively, and they were associated with oxygen vacancies and C–O–C structures.67 The C 1s (a), N 1s (b), O 1s (c), Pd 3d (d) and Cl 2p (e) spectra of the PdBPI-CF electrode are shown in Fig. 8. The peaks monitored at 284.43, 284.74, 285.56, 288.52 and 290.88 eV were attributed to the C–C (sp2) C–C(sp3), C–O, C–N and N–CN groups, respectively.68 In addition to the C 1s spectrum of the BPI-CF, a peak belonging to the C–C (sp3) bond was analyzed in the C 1s spectrum of PdBPI-CF. It was observed that the C–C (sp3) bond structures were formed due to the methyl (–CH3) group in the para position of the pyridine rings.69 The N 1s spectra of the PdBPI-CF electrode are displayed in Fig. 8b. The peaks observed at 398.49, 399.75 and 402.29 eV belong to the imine group (C–NC), tertiary amine (N–C3) and C–N bond structures, respectively.70,71 By observing the formation of the tertiary amine structure in the N 1s spectrum, the molecular structure of the Pd complex was also supported. The peaks examined at 531.98, 533.44 and 535.49 eV in the O 1s spectrum demonstrated in Fig. 8c were related to oxygen vacancy, C–O–C and adsorbed water (H2O), respectively.72,73 In Fig. 8d, the peaks observed in the Pd 3d XPS spectra of the PdBPI-CF electrode at 338.41 and 343.58 eV were related to the Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2 structures, respectively.74 Finally, the peaks investigated at 198.24 and 199.98 eV in the Cl 2p spectrum shown in Fig. 8e were related to Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2, respectively.75

Effects of BPI and PdBPI modified electrodes of the VRB
The electrochemical behavior of the pristine PGE, PGE/BPI, and PGE/PdBPI electrodes in 0.1 M VOSO4 and 3 M H2SO4 solution was investigated by the CV method using a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell system at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (Fig. 9). The anodic and cathodic peaks observed in the CVs indicate the V(4)/V(5) and V(5)/V(4) conversions, respectively76–78 (Fig. 9a). No oxidation or reduction peaks were observed in the CVs taken with the pristine PGE, PGE/BPI, and PGE/PdBPI electrodes in the presence of only H2SO4 solution (blank solution) (Fig. 9b). When the CVs of pristine PGE, PGE/BPI, and PGE/PdBPI electrodes were examined, it was observed that the anodic and cathodic peak currents and capacitance values obtained with PGE/BPI and PGE/PdBPI were higher than those of pristine PGE. The highest oxidation and reduction peak current was obtained with the PGE/BPI electrode. At the same time, the oxidation peak potential shifted to the more cathodic potentials and the reduction peak shifted to the more anodic potentials. The smallest potential difference (88 mV) between the oxidation and reduction peak potential values were obtained with the PGE/PdBPI electrode, and the largest potential difference (506 mV) was obtained with the pristine PGE (Table 1). A potential difference of 154 mV was observed with the PGE/BPI electrode. When the CV results of BPI and PdBPI modified and unmodified pencil graphite electrodes were examined, the catalytic effect of BPIs on the positive electrolyte solution of VRB was demonstrated. These results were associated with the modification of the surface of the PGE with organometallic functional groups using BPI and PdBPI.

The 500 cycle stabilities in the VRB system were evaluated in the long-term electrochemical stability test (Fig. S11 and S12†), and it was found that the stabilities did not considerably decline. It was observed that PGE/BPI and PGE/PdBPIs largely maintained their stability and electrocatalytic behavior under highly acidic conditions (Fig. S11 and S12†). Comparison graphs of the anodic and cathodic peak currents and capacitances are given in Fig. 9c and d, respectively. The use of PGEs designed with BPIs also demonstrated a remarkable enhancement in the electrochemical activity with distinctive redox peaks towards the vanadium reaction. The presence of these groups on the electrode surface was confirmed by Raman, SEM, and EDX results. Shifts in the oxidation and reduction potentials (ΔEp) as a result of the porosity and functional groups on the surface of the PGE/BPI and PGE/PdBPI-modified electrodes can be found in Table 1.79
The electrochemical measurements were performed using PGE/BPI at different scan rates to understand the mass transfer mechanism for the reactions between the vanadium species and electrode, as seen in Fig. 10a. Anodic and cathodic peak current densities and capacities of PGE/BPI were plotted against scanning rates to figure out the optimal scan rate for a VRB positive electrode application (Fig. 10b and c). Considering the intersection between the intensities and capacitances, it was examined at 100 mV s−1 for both cathodic and anodic peaks, which indicated the optimum scanning rate for their application in this field. The square root of the scan rates is shown against the anodic and cathodic peak current densities for PGE/BPI (Fig. 10d). These results also demonstrated that the system had diffusion-controlled mass transport.80

To further understand the mass transfer mechanism for reactions between the vanadium species and PGE/PdBPI, CVs were taken at various scanning rates (Fig. 11a). The anodic and cathodic peak current densities, as well as capacitances, were plotted against the scan rate ratios to determine the best scanning rate for VRB application (Fig. 11b and c). According to the results obtained, it was decided that the appropriate scanning rate was 100 mV s−1. For PGE/PdBPI, the square root of the scan rates was plotted against the anodic and cathodic peak current densities (Fig. 11d). Diffusion-controlled mass transfer was also demonstrated by these results.80

All EIS measurements of the pristine and modified PGEs were completed under an open circuit potential (OPC) in 0.1 M VOSO4 and 3.0 M H2SO4 solutions. Fig. 12 depicts the results of the Nyquist plots, which were used to examine the electrochemical behavior of the V(5)/V(4) redox couple on the pristine and modified PGE surfaces. By modeling R(Q(RW)) as an equivalent circuit, it is possible to detect a direct correlation between the response of the calculated and measured impedance values (Fig. 13).81–84 The initial resistance is the solution resistance (Rs), which is equal to the total of the electrolyte and modified film and substrate electrical resistances. The modified film capacitance is provided by Q, which is a parallel connection with the Rct element. Table 2 illustrates the calculated values. The chi-squared (χ2) term, where the error of each element is generally less than 10−3, is used to determine the correctness of fitting to the corresponding circuits. Due to the good-fit of the measured impedance over the whole frequency range, the suggested circuit's validity is confirmed via measured and calculated impedance for all PGEs. Although pristine PGE had the greatest Rct value, it was much lower in the PGE/BPI and PGE/PdBPI electrodes (Table 2). Because the diffusion rates in the modified electrodes were greater than those in pristine PGE due to their more porous surface morphology, the modified electrodes exhibited higher Warburg impedance values than the pristine PGE (Table 2). These effects can be linked to the electrodes’ ΔEp trend, as shown by CV measurements.

Battery tests
CCD tests were performed at 4.0 mA cm−2 (charge current intensity) and 0.4 mA cm−2 (discharge current intensity) using the BPI and PdBPI-modified CF electrodes with 25.0 cm2 surface area. CCD tests were also carried out to determine the charge–discharge potential and capacity characteristics of the battery formed by the new modified electrode system. The CE, VE and EE obtained during the charge–discharge tests are given in the Table S4†, and these efficiencies are compared with the efficiencies of different modified electrodes. When the results were examined, it could be concluded that the percentage efficiencies of the BPI-CF and PdBPI-CF electrodes were generally hopeful. It was also clearly seen in the literature studies that the modified electrode has many advantages such as higher discharge times, higher potential, and higher efficiency compared to the pristine CF electrode.85–87 The CCD tests with the BPI-CF and PdBPI-CF electrodes are given in Fig. 14 and 15, respectively. The battery systems were performed with electrolytes containing 1.5 M vanadium ions in 3.0 M H2SO4, which were prepared separately in a volume of 250 mL. Five charge and discharge cycles of VRBs were studied by CCD test. Firstly, the V(4) ions were electrolyzed to obtain the V(3) ions. During the CCD tests, the V(3) ions reduced to the V(2) oxidation state in 3.0 M sulfuric acid solution as the negative electrolyte solution. Against this solution, the V(4) ion was oxidized to the V(5) oxidation state in 3.0 M sulfuric acid solution as the positive electrolyte solution. The charging potential obtained with the BPI-CF electrode reached 1.63 V, while the charging potential of the PdBPI-CF reached 1.88 V. A large charge–discharge gap is an undesirable result because it will cause low voltage efficiency. The voltage fluctuations given in Fig. 15 can be interpreted as being within acceptable limits. The acceptability of the approximately 0.5 V potential difference was confirmed, as previously observed in the literature. Similarly, in this study, a voltage fluctuation with such a difference was observed.88 In the cyclic charge–discharge test of PdBPI-CF, proton ions may be accumulated on the electrode surface because the charge time was longer than the discharge time.89 The voltage fluctuations during charging were not observed with the BPI-modified electrode. However, the voltage fluctuations are observed at high potential values for the BPI-modified electrode containing Pd. There may be voltage fluctuations due to difficulty in charging the modified electrode containing Pd metal. In this work, voltage efficiencies were calculated as approximately 97.1% and 98.2% for BPI-CF and PdBPI-CF, respectively. These VRB systems were studied at the 4.0 mA cm−2 charge current density and 0.4 mA cm−2 discharge current density. The measured maximum discharge capacity for BPI-CF was ∼301 mA h, and was ∼303 mA h for PdBPI-CF at the VRB systems.

Conclusions
In the present research, new N,N,N pincer-type metal-free and palladium(II) complexes bearing naphthoxy groups were successfully synthesized and characterized. Solid-state X-ray crystallographic studies were carried out to obtain the spatial geometry of the obtained structures and determine the bond angles. An innovative electrode architecture containing metal-free (BPI) and palladium(II) (PdBPI) complexes was proposed for the VRB systems using a single-step electrodeposition method on the PGE surface for the first time. The catalytic effect of the BPI and PdBPI-modified PGEs on the V(4)/V(5) reaction was approximately 5 and 7 times higher than the pristine PGE, respectively. For the stability test, the electrocatalytic behavior of PGE/BPI and PGE/PdBPI were studied in a sulfuric acid solution. Their properties were largely preserved in an acidic medium. BPI-CF and PdBPI-CF exhibited high discharge capacities and high voltage efficiencies during the cyclic charge–discharge tests. These electrodes led to a 29% and 44% increase in charge potentials compared to VRB. The maximum obtained discharge capacities were ∼1204 mA h L−1 for the BPI-CF electrode and ∼1212 mA h L−1 for the PdBPI-CF electrode. The specified voltage efficiencies were ∼97% and ∼98% for the BPI-CF electrode and PdBPI-CF electrode, respectively. In the VRB system, the charging potentials increased to 1.63 V and 1.88 V by utilizing the BPI-CF and PdBPI-CF electrodes, respectively. The obtained charge current density and the discharge current density were 4.0 mA cm−2 and 0.4 mA cm−2, respectively. Since the BPI-CF and PdBPI-CF electrodes have been utilized successfully for the VRB system, this work can be a pioneer work for future studies.
