    , Accepted 2nd March 2015First published on 2nd March 2015AbstractFirst evidence of hydrogen evolution by using titanium trisulphide (TiS3) as a photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) is reported. Synthesized TiS3, composed of numerous nanoribbons, has been structurally, morphologically and photoelectrochemically characterized. Moreover, the value of its flat band potential has been estimated (Vfb = −0.68 ± 0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl) by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. This value has been used to depict the band energy levels of the TiS3/electrolyte interface. Finally, flows of photogenerated hydrogen up to 1.80 ± 0.05 μmol H2 min−1 have been quantified by Mass Spectrometry (MS) at a (Ag/AgCl) bias potential of 0.3 V, yielding a photoconversion efficiency of about 7%.
Introduction
Energy storage directly from solar light is an attractive approach towards the need for efficient energy systems with minimal environmental impact. However, important goals need to be achieved to utilize solar energy efficiently. Collecting and storing sun energy through chemical bonds, as molecular hydrogen, is a highly desirable methodology to solve problems related to the increasing energy demand.1,2 There are different methods in order to achieve this aim, but water splitting cells with direct semiconductor/liquid contact are becoming a suitable option because they avoid significant fabrication cost involved in the use of electrolyzers wired to p–n junction solar cells.3 Since Honda and Fujishima4 discovered this phenomenon using TiO2 more than 40 years ago, scientific community has been working to solve several problems associated with the water splitting process.
The energy conversion efficiency of solar water splitting is still low. The improvement of the efficiency relies on new materials for efficient solar energy harvesting as well as active catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolutions. One important step is to develop low bandgap photocatalysts. Suitable electrodes to be used in photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) for hydrogen generation should be formed by light-absorbing materials with appropriate band energy positions for the photoelectrochemical reduction of water,5,6i.e., band energy levels (CB and VB) should have adequate position with respect to water redox potentials.7 To this aim, research has been shifted from single compounds (oxides, sulfides…) to new complex alternatives such as plasmonic nanostructures,8 and two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials.9
Some transition metal sulphides present advantages over these complex materials keeping the requirement of a low bandgap, to absorb direct solar energy, low cost, abundant and nontoxic elements and an easy synthesis process. In the last few years, they have been extensively investigated for their application in photoelectrochemical cells (PECs). Recently, the interest in layered metal sulfides such as MoS210 is growing because of its low cost and excellent optical properties.
Titanium trisulphide (TiS3) is a quasi-one dimensional sulphide that grows forming thin nanoribbons due to its linear chain type structure, in which, the chains are formed by trigonal prismatic TiS6 units, sharing the upper and lower faces and extending parallel to the b-axis. Its structure is the monoclinic ZrSe3-type, space group P21/m.11 TiS3 is an n-type semiconducting material with a minimum direct optical band gap, Eg, of around 1.0 eV,12 which has been determined by optical spectroscopy in thin films and powders.13 A second direct energy gap has also been measured at 1.60 eV.13 They were previously reported from photocurrent spectral response measurements.14 Recently, their optoelectronic properties have also been investigated showing high photoresponse and electron mobility and low resistivity. These results make TiS3 adequate to be used in applications as optoelectronic transistors.15 Finally, TiS3 has demonstrated to be an excellent thermoelectric material16,17 which increases also the possibilities of being used in thermoelectric devices.
In this work, the synthesis and structural, morphological and photoelectrochemical properties of TiS3 have been extensively investigated. Moreover, by means of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), the flat band potential of TiS3 has been determined and the energy level scheme has been established. Finally, hydrogen evolution flows have been quantified by mass spectrometry and the energy conversion efficiency has been estimated.
Experimental
Synthesis of TiS3 nanoribbons on Ti substrates
Titanium trisulphide nanoribbons have been grown by titanium disc sulphuration (Goodfellow 99.9%, ∅ = 10 mm) which had been previously etched in a HF:HNO3 mixture (4% wt:30% wt) to eliminate any impurities accumulated on their surfaces. Ti discs were then put into a quartz ampoule with sulphur powder (Merck, 99.75%) under vacuum (10−3 mb) to remove atmospheric oxygen and water and prevent oxidation of titanium during heating. Ampoules were heated at a rate of 250 °C per hour and kept at 500 °C for 20 hours (temperatures and times of sulphuration have been previously optimized).13,14,18
Structural and morphological characterization
Crystal structure and crystallite size were identified by X-ray diffraction, using an XRD (Panalytical X'pert Pro X-ray diffractometer, with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å)). Composition was analysed by Energy Dispersive X-ray, EDX (INCA x-sight). Sample's morphology was observed using scanning electron, SEM (Oxford Instruments) and Field Emission Gun, FEG, microscopes (FEI XL-30). Electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient were measured by using experimental setups designed in our laboratory.19 The BET surface area of the photocatalysts was determined by a N2 adsorb–desorption method at −196 °C in a ASAP 2010 micrometrics equipment, using a multipoint BET method at relative pressures up to 0.3. The sample was degassed before measuring at 150 °C under vacuum up to a lower stable value of 5 × 10−3 mmHg.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode quartz cell containing an aqueous solution of 0.5 M Na2SO3 buffered a pH = 9. TiS3 samples were used as the working electrode. The counter electrode was a platinum sheet, and the reference one was an Ag/AgCl electrode. Current density (at dark and under illumination) and impedance voltage dependence were measured with a potentiostat-galvanostat PGSTAT302N provided with an integrated impedance module FRAII (10 mV of modulation amplitude is used at AC frequencies from 100 Hz to 900 Hz). An halogen lamp was used as a visible light source. Measured light power density reaching the surface sample was 270 ± 20 mW cm−2. This value was used to estimate the photoconversion efficiency. A quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS, Mod. Prisma, Balzers) coupled to the photoelectrochemical cell was used to quantify the photogenerated hydrogen. During the experiment, an argon flow of 20 sscm was passed through the top of the cell. Details are given in ref. 20.
Results and discussion
Morphological and structural characterization

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern in which the TiS3 monoclinic phase is observed as the unique crystalline phase with a preferential orientation direction probably due to the distribution of the nanoribbons. Structural parameters, obtained from the analysis of the XRD pattern, are shown in Table 1. Lattice parameters are in good agreement with those tabulated (JC-PDS 015-0783). Crystallite size (80 ± 10 nm) has been obtained by applying the Scherrer equation21 to the (012) diffraction peak. Average of the stoichiometric ratio, determined by EDX, gives a value of S/Ti = 2.9 ± 0.1, slightly lower than that expected for the stoichiometric compound.

Nanoribbons were morphologically characterized by SEM and FEG (Fig. 2). As it can be observed, TiS3 is formed by fine and long nanoribbons which have widths between 1 and 5 μm, lengths longer than 100 μm, and thicknesses from 50 to 200 nm. These nanostructures of titanium sulphide give large active surface area which could improve the reaction kinetics. In order to quantify the specific area of TiS3 nanoribbons, BET analysis was carried out. The results show a BET surface area of 67 m2 g−1 which is really large compared with the geometrical surface (ESI†). Porosity has not been found in this material.

Nanomorphology is an important key to obtain promising results22 for catalytic processes because of the large exposed area shown by relatively small samples. TiS3 presents a large surface area due to its morphology of nanoribbons which grow directly from the titanium substrate. It is expected that nanoribbons reduce the carrier diffusion and increase the reaction surface area, as well as improve the evolution surface kinetics. The synthesis process, which is easier and cheaper than others as electrodeposition or electrospinning,23 confers to this material an additional advantage.
Photoelectrochemical activity
Dark and photocurrent densities are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows the I–V curve of as-prepared TiS3 nanoribbons. Photocurrent densities of several mA have been measured. Fig. 3b shows the corresponding I–V curve of a flattened sample which shows really lower photocurrent densities (<1 mA) than the as-grown ones. This fact demonstrates the importance of sample morphology. In addition, a significant increase of the dark current is obtained, at a given bias potential, which could be attributed to the increase of the contact surface of TiS3 with the metal substrate. Finally, the photocurrent onset potential is close to −0.1 V vs. (Ag/AgCl) in both samples, before and after flattening, in good agreement with previously reported results.16 All these effects can be seen by comparing Fig. 3a with Fig. 3b.

The difference in the photocurrent is accompanied by a change in the XRD pattern, as it can be seen in Fig. S2 (ESI†), which shows different relative intensities of the XRD peaks. This fact is probably due to the bending of the nanoribbons, exposing different planes to the incident X-ray. More pilled nanoribbons could reduce the active surface area for the charge transfer, decreasing the photocurrent density and the light absorption. However, the effect of the crystallographic plane exposed should not be neglected. More efforts are being devoted in order to elucidate this question.
The photocurrent spectral response of TiS3 at 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) is shown in Fig. 4a, beside the corresponding Tauc plot to determine the energy band gap (Fig. 4b). Two direct transitions can be observed corresponding to Eg = 1.06 ± 0.05 eV and 1.29 ± 0.05 eV. These results are in good agreement with previously reported experimental values obtained from the photocurrent response14 and optical absorption measurements,13 even though they are obtained with TiS3 grown at 550 °C.

Flat band potential determined by EIS
Energy band edges can be experimentally estimated from the flat band potential, which is commonly determined from capacitance measurements by using the Mott–Schottky equation. Vfb is a property of the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, therefore, it is determined not only by the semiconductor properties but also by the electrolyte.

V
fb of TiS3 has been obtained from the space charge layer capacitance (CSC) measured by potentiodynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, (EIS).24 In order to determine the space charge layer capacitance, AC modulated cyclic voltage scans from −1.0 V to 0.5 V, in a range of frequencies between 100 Hz and 900 KHz, were performed, at dark conditions. The capacitance of the space charge layer is calculated by assuming 1/(wZim) = CSC(1)where w is the frequency and Zim is the imaginary part of the impedance.
The dependence of CSC on bias potential (V) is described by the Mott–Schottky equation:25–27 (2)where CSC is the measured differential capacitance per unit area, e0 is the elementary charge, εSC is the material dielectric constant, ε0 is the electrical permittivity of vacuum, ND is the semiconductor donor density, V is the applied bias potential in volts, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the measurement temperature (298 K). Therefore, from the CSC−2vs. V plot, Vfb can be easily obtained by the interception with the x-axis.25–27

Fig. 5 shows the Mott–Schottky plots at two frequencies and the estimated flat band potential Vfb = −0.68 ± 0.02V (Ag/AgCl) = −0.48V ± 0.02V (NHE). The term  has been neglected because of its low value.

Fig. 6 presents the energy level diagram at the TiS3/electrolyte interface at pH = 9, depicted with our experimental data. Flat band potential (Vfb = −0.48VNHE) is used to locate the semiconductor Fermi level (assuming zero charge situation). An energy band gap of Eg = 1.1 eV, obtained from the photocurrent spectral response, is considered. And finally, the position of the energy Fermi level into the TiS3 band gap, predicted by theoretical calculations28 (0.5 eV from the bottom of the CB) is taken into account. Reported value of TiS3 work function, Φ = 4.60 eV,29 could also be used to determine the Fermi level energy. However, a discrepancy between the EF energy determined from Vfb and that obtained from a work function of about 0.6 eV exists. This discrepancy can be due to the sensitivity of the work function to chemical changes, since deviations of the order of 1 eV in the value of measured work function are common, for metals and semiconductors, depending on the surface condition.

H2 generation and solar energy conversion

Fig. 6 shows that the reduction of water to generate hydrogen at the TiS3/electrolyte could be thermodynamically possible.25,30 The nature of evolved gases under different polarization conditions was investigated. To this aim, gas flow was analyzed “in situ” using a mass spectrometer. Flow is formed by hydrogen and no traces of oxygen are observed, confirming the band level scheme depicted in Fig. 6, i.e. the reduction of water to generate hydrogen at the TiS3/electrolyte is thermodynamically possible but oxygen generation is forbidden. This result leads to an easy implementation in a commercial device since oxygen should be removed if produced.

Fig. 7a and b show the hydrogen photogeneration rate at 0.0 V (Ag/AgCl) and at different bias potentials, respectively, under white light illumination. As far as we know, there are no previously reported data on H2 generation by using TiS3 nanoribbons under visible light. As it can be observed, flow goes up as bias potential is increased, reaching values of 1.8 μmol H2 min−1 at 0.3 V (Ag/AgCl). Table 2 resumes the hydrogen photogeneration rates, the total amount of hydrogen generated during 20 minutes and the photoconversion efficiency, estimated at different applied voltages by means of eqn (3).31,32

Oxygen evolution is not detected by QMS, since the oxidation of water is not thermodynamically favourable, in agreement with the energy level scheme depicted in Fig. 6. The oxidation of SO32− to SO42− is the alternative reaction, where SO32− acts as a sacrificial agent. Reactions at electrodes interfaces are as follows:Anode: SO32− + 2h+ + 2OH− → SO42− + H2OCathode: 2H+ + 2e− → H2
The results hint that a great amount of hydrogen can be obtained. H2 flows and amounts are truly high compared with other PEC systems which need longer times to get similar amounts.33,34
Finally, one of the most significant parameter is the efficiency of solar energy conversion into hydrogen. Solar energy conversion efficiency may be determined by using the eqn (3),25 which is used when an external electrical bias is needed: (3)where the first term accounts the chemical energy harvested by the photogenerated hydrogen,  (237.2 kJ mol−1) is the standard Gibbs energy (at 25 °C and 1 bar) of water splitting and RH2 is the rate of production of hydrogen (mol s−1) in its standard state per unit area of the photoelectrode, PS is the power density of illumination in (W m−2) (270 mW cm−2, in our measurements), A is the surface area (m2), Vb is the external bias potential (V in volts) and I is the current density (A) responsible for the generation of hydrogen at the rate RH2, therefore, it is assumed that all the carriers contribute to the generation of hydrogen. In many cases,25 the efficiency is commonly overestimated because the measurements are usually performed in a three-electrode system and the bias potential used in the equation is provided by the potentiostat that should take into account the open circuit potential,35 instead of the cell voltage, as should be used. However, here we used the approximation proposed by Liu et al.36 to estimate the external potential imposed between the TiS3 working photoanode and the platinum counter electrode avoiding that overestimation.

Table 2 shows the photoconversion efficiency calculated using both assumptions about the applied potential, to compare their results and confirm the overestimation. Furthermore, the results shown in Table 2 demonstrate the high efficiency of TiS3 nanoribbons as a photoanode in a PEC for hydrogen generation. Compared with other materials investigated by us, such as PdS,20 TiS3 yields higher efficiencies in the HER process. Recalculating the efficiency of PdS by the Liu approximation36 the efficiency of TiS3 is 5 times higher than that of PdS at 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The total amount of photogenerated hydrogen during 20 min is also larger (more than 20 times) than that from PdS.20

Fig. 8 shows the steady state photocurrent as a function of the applied potential, showing its increasing trend reaching up to a saturation value at V > 0.2 V (Ag/AgCl). This increasing evolution is also observed in the hydrogen flow and efficiency, but without the saturation at 0.3 V (Ag/AgCl).

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the material also shows a good chemical stability, which is investigated by XRD. XRD patterns of samples, before and after measurements, do not exhibit essential differences, hinting that any chemical decomposition has not taken place (Fig. S5, ESI†).
Conclusions
Direct sulphuration of titanium discs in vacuum ampoules has been used to synthetize TiS3 nanoribbons with a large specific area. These nanoribbons have been utilized as photoanodes in a PEC. TiS3 flat band potential was determined (Vfb = −0.68 V vs. Ag/AgCl), for the first time, and energy band positions have been set in an energy level diagram, resulting in a suitable position for water reduction. TiS3 shows high photocurrents under white light illumination, as well as a really great hydrogen generation rate, which has been quantified by means of mass spectrometry. Energy photoconversion efficiencies up to 7% have been calculated. All these results make TiS3 a good candidate to be used as a photoanode in a PEC device for solar hydrogen photogeneration.
