    , Accepted 18th December 2017First published on 18th December 2017AbstractPerovskite solar cell (PSCs) technology has made a tremendous impact in the solar cell community due to the exceptional performance of PSCs as the power conversion efficiency (PCE) surged to a world record of 22% within the last few years. Despite this high efficiency value, the commercialization of PSCs for large area applications at affordable prices is still pending due to the low stability of the devices under ambient atmospheric conditions and the very high cost of the hole transporting materials (HTMs) used as the charge transporting layer in these devices. To cope with these challenges, the use of cheap HTMs can play a dual role in terms of lowering the overall cost of perovskite technology as well as protecting the perovskite layer to achieve a higher stability. To achieve these goals, various new organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) have been proposed. In this study, we used a unique and novel anthanthrone (ANT) dye as a conjugated core building block and an affordable moiety to synthesize a new HTM. The commercially available dye was functionalized with an extended diphenylamine (DPA) end capping group. The newly developed HTM, named DPA–ANT–DPA, was synthesized in a single step and used successfully in mesoporous perovskite solar cell devices, achieving a PCE of 11.5% under 1 Sun condition with impressive stability. The obtained device efficiency is amongst the highest as compared to that of other D–A–D molecular design and low band gap devices. This kind of low cost HTM based on an inexpensive starting precursor, anthanthrone dye, paves the way for the economical and large-scale production of stable perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
The number of potentially economic solar cell technologies is increasing every year, in search of the Holy Grail of maximum conversion efficiency and minimum production cost. In the area of low-cost solar cells, which includes organic solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained significant attention from the scientific community as researchers have been able to quickly achieve record performance, which are unparalleled in organic solar cells and DSSCs. After the first breakthrough in 2013, the power conversion energy (PCE) PSCs achieved a value of 22.1%,1,2 very close to that of traditional silicon solar cells. However, a few major obstacles are yet to be addressed before the commercial application of this technology. The first challenge is to improve the stability of the solar cells. The second is how to enhance the performance in terms of the PCE. The hole transporting layer (HTL) plays an extremely important role in both the stability and performance of the PSCs. The HTL improves the device stability by preventing the active perovskite layer from making contact with the metal electrode, blocking moisture and oxygen penetration.3 The HTL is also instrumental in suppressing charge recombination to achieve a higher open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), which leads to greater efficiency.4–6 One of the key components responsible for the high cost of PSCs is the HTL. In fact the most efficient and widely used HTL is the molecule: 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD). Unfortunately, the very high cost of Spiro-OMeTAD (400 USD per gram) would limit the large scale production of PSCs. In order to make this technology more economically viable, there is a great need to find alternative HTLs with lower cost that are simple to synthesize, which will also be scalable and achieve an equal or higher performance when compared to Spiro-OMeTAD. Currently, several economical organic HTMs employed in PSCs have shown respectable efficiency and higher stability when compared to Spiro-OMeTAD. Among them, small molecular HTMs are advantageous when compared to their polymeric counterparts because of their high purity, defined molecular structure, promising yields and better batch-to-batch reproducibility.7–9
In this group of small molecules, abundant rational molecular design strategies, including donor–π–donor (D–π–D), acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) and donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) moieties have been intensively used for their synthesis. Perovskite devices with higher performance and better stability have been fabricated successfully using these HTMs. For example, (E)-4′,4′′′-(ethene-1,2-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-[1′′,1′′′′-biphenyl]-4-amine) (TPA-BPV-TPA) (16.42%),10 2′,7′-bis(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)spiro[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,90-fluorene] (FDT) (20.2%),11N-(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-7-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-N-(7-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine (CzPAF-TPA) (15.71%),12 4,4′-(5,5′-(7,7′-(5,5′-(4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(3-hexylthiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-7,4-diyl))bis(4-hexyl-thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(1-(2-ethylhexyl)pyridin-1-ium) bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide) (M7-TFSI) (17.4%)13 and 2,2′,2′′-(((5,10,15-trihexyl-10,15-dihydro-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole-3,8,13-triyl)tris(3,3′′-dihexyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-5′′,5-diyl))tris(methanylylidene))trimalononitrile (KR321) (19.03%).14 These HTMs can lead to an efficiency in the range of 16–20%. However, there are few new HTMs based on the D–A–D structure reported to date, including 4,4′-(1,3,4-oxadiazole-2,5-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (H1),15 4,4′-(5,6-dimethoxybenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole-4,7-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (BTPA-3),6 9,9′-((benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(N3,N3,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine) (JY5)16 and 9,9′-((5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(N3,N3,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine) (JY6).17 The D–A–D structure has been designed by introducing an electron-deficient unit as the core with two strong electron-rich end-capping groups in order to obtain a deeper highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, thereby improving the Voc.18 This strategy is expected to result in a higher PCE.5,10,19–21 In addition, when compared to the D–π–D type molecules, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-donating unit to the electron-withdrawing unit can be boosted via the D–A–D structure.6
In this work, we report a facile, one-step synthesis of a novel dopant-free D–A–D HTM based on a low cost anthanthrone (ANT) dye as the core and diphenylamine (DPA) as an efficient end-capping conjugated building block. The compound, namely 4,10-bis(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)naphtho[7,8,1,2,3-nopqr]tetraphene-6,12-dione (DPA–ANT–DPA), was synthesized using a standard Buchwald coupling between the halogenated derivative and the amine group, as shown in Scheme 1. In this D–A–D type structure, 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone, named as VAT Orange 3 (compound 1 in Scheme 1), was used as a low cost starting precursor and introduced as a strong electron-withdrawing ketone unit in the core due to its π-conjugated nature and a large conjugated planar structure.22–24 This was successful for achieving a low-lying HOMO energy level,25 which improved the intermolecular interactions, such as π–π interactions22 and achieved high performance in the organic optoelectronic devices.25

Results and discussion
The synthesis of DPA–ANT–DPA was straightforward and uses the Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reaction. Compound 1 and 2 were mixed with [1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene] dichloropalladium [PdCl2(dppf)] at 90 °C for 24 h in anhydrous toluene.26 After purification by column chromatography, the yield of the reaction was found to be 80%, which has potential for large-scale application in the future. The purity was confirmed by proton and carbon NMR spectroscopy, the results of which are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The synthetic procedure is described in detail in the ESI.† The material exhibited good solubility in most common organic solvents including chloroform, dichloromethane and chlorobenzene.
To gain insight into the electronic structure of this material, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP level of theory using the 6-31g+(d,p) basis set.27–29 As shown in Fig. 1a, while the electron density of the HOMO was fully delocalized over the entire molecule, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was primarily distributed over the π-conjugated system through the ANT core. According to the DFT calculations, the HOMO and LUMO values were found to be −4.79 eV and −3.01 eV, respectively. As a result, the band gap was found to be of 1.78 eV. In addition, the optical absorption maxima were at 892 nm, resulting in an optical band gap of 1.39 eV. The DFT-calculated data differs slightly from the experimental values due to the gaseous state assumptions, however, the results are still in a good agreement with one another (Table 1).

The absorption spectra of DPA–ANT–DPA as a chloroform solution and as thin film on glass were measured and shown in Fig. 1b. All the data is listed in Table 1. In the low wavelength region, DPA–ANT–DPA reveals an absorption maxima at 344 nm for the solution and 343 nm for the thin film, respectively. Meanwhile, it shows a broadened absorption in the visible-light range with a maxima peak at 717 nm for the solution and 724 nm for the thin film, respectively. The electronic absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region was attributed to the ICT band due to the introduction of the strong electron-donating DPA end capping units and strong electron-accepting ANT core.30,31 The slight red shift in the absorption band observed with the thin films when compared with that found in solution indicates the very weak intermolecular interactions in the solid-state. Such weak solid-state interactions also arise due to the presence of two distorted phenylene units. The propeller structure may be beneficial towards forming a better interface with three dimensional photoactive perovskite layers in the devices, which can effectively promote charge transport. The optical band gap of DPA–ANT–DPA, calculated using the solid-state absorption onset values at 869 nm, was 1.43 eV. This low band gap implies the strong intramolecular D–A interaction between the amine and quinone units as previously reported.26 To the best of our knowledge, it is the lowest band gap HTM for PSCs when compared to the previously reported low band gap HTMs (1.47–1.50 eV).30,32,33
In this work, we determined the HOMO value of DPA–ANT–DPA experimentally using two methods, photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) (Fig. 1c) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). All these parameters are shown in Table 1. The HOMO value of DPA–ANT–DPA was estimated to be −5.46 eV, which was similar to the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite layer. The reduced energy gap between the HTL and the active layer guarantees a high value for the Voc and efficient hole extraction. Meanwhile, the respective LUMO level of this compound was estimated, based on ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg, to be −4.03 eV. This low-lying LUMO energy level was below the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the perovskite, which allows part of the undesired electron transport to occur and lead to the low efficiency. While the LUMO value obtained by CV was consistent with the calculated value obtained from the PESA data, the HOMO values from both techniques are slightly different. This may be caused by the energy values of the sample in the CV technique, which was performed in a dichloromethane solution with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. Whereas, in PESA, the sample was deposited as a thin film and then exposed to ultraviolet light at a certain intensity in air. The HOMO energy value data from the PESA technique was more relevant since the actual devices are in the solid state and the PESA measurement was also performed using the thin film form.
The thermal properties of DPA–ANT–DPA were determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and summarized in Table 1. According to the TGA curve, this compound has an extremely good thermal stability and was stable up to 377 °C. The thermal transitions were investigated by DSC using two scan cycles. The melting temperature (Tm) (294 °C) was observed during the first and second heating scans whereas the glass transition temperature (Tg) (148 °C) was only noticed during the second heating scan. Furthermore, the crystallization temperature (Tc) was witnessed at 244 °C during the second heating scan. It turns out that the material has some crystalline phases and this may be originating from the donor–acceptor interactions and fused core nature of the ANT conjugated building block.34 This was in good agreement with the observation of needle-like crystal formation during the drying process of the DPA–ANT–DPA solution contained in a glass tube (Fig. S4, ESI†). Meanwhile, there were no crystallization peaks observed during the cooling step. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed with the results shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). A primary intense peak at 2θ = 9.34° was observed, leading to a d-spacing (the lamellar repeating distance between the compound chains) of 1.1 nm, calculated using the Bragg equation.
In order to evaluate the effect of the crystalline phases on charge carrier transport, we used the DPA–ANT–DPA material as an active layer in organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices using bottom gate top contact devices. The OFET device fabrication is described in detail in the ESI.† The data is shown in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The hole mobility of DPA–ANT–DPA was calculated using the output and transfer characteristics. The mobility of DPA–ANT–DPA was calculated to be 2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was higher than that found for Spiro-OMeTAD (μ = 1.69 × 10−6–2.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1)35,36 using a similar experimental technique (using an OFET device). Furthermore, we measured and compared the hole mobility of our newly developed DPA–ANT–DPA and the traditional Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layers (Fig. S7, ESI†) using the hole only space charge limited current (SCLC) method under identical conditions. The hole mobility for DPA–ANT–DPA was 1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 whereas for Spiro-OMeTAD it was 1.6 × 10−4. In regard to the solar cell devices, the SCLC measurement is the most relevant technique, which gives the correct charge carrier mobility value since the charge transport occurs vertically. Details of the sample preparation and SCLC measurements can be found in the ESI.† Both the OFET and SCLC techniques confirm the better charge carrier mobility of our newly developed DPA–ANT–DPA hole transport layer.
After the optical, thermal and electrochemical characterization of DPA–ANT–DPA it was incorporated within a conventional perovskite devices as an HTM, with the main aim towards studying the effect of the hole transport layer on the device performance. The PSC devices with the FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTL/Ag device architecture were fabricated according to a procedure.37 The configuration of the mesoscopic heterojunction PSC was characterized using cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 2b. A dense compact-TiO2 blocking layer (∼30–40 nm) was first deposited on the FTO substrate using spray pyrolysis, while a mesoporous n-type mp-TiO2 layer was formed via spin-coating diluted TiO2 paste. The CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer was then applied on the mesoporous TiO2 layer using solvent engineering, as reported by the Seok group.37
 Fig. 2  The (a) energy level diagram and (b) cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image of the PSC constructed using DPA–ANT–DPA. 
The perovskite solution was prepared using a standard procedure, the details of which can be found in the ESI.† Around 120 nm thick HTLs were applied to the top CH3NH3PbI3 layer via spin coating. Finally, silver as a counter electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation. The thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 and perovskite layer was ∼550 nm, whereas the capping layer of perovskite was estimated to be ∼100 nm. Larger crystals of TiO2 in the capping layer assist in the saturated light absorption process, which enhances the external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the red-light region.
For a valid comparison of the device performance in terms of the PCE and stability, we prepared new dopant-free HTMs based devices and standard devices with dopant using conventional Spiro-OMeTAD (with additional additives, including tBP and LiTFSI) as the HTM. The optimized champion device efficiency for DPA–ANT–DPA and Spiro-OMeTAD HTMs, and their corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2.

The non-doped DPA–ANT–DPA HTM based PSC device (Fig. 3a) shows the highest champion device efficiency of 11.5% (Jsc = 16.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.0 V and FF = 71%). Whereas the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based device performance (Fig. 3b) approaches a PCE of 16% with Jsc = 21 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.03 V and FF = 74%. The hysteresis behaviour of the champion devices and statistics of the 42 devices prepared using DPA–ANT–DPA and 41 devices using Spiro-OMeTAD as HTLs are shown in Table 2, Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively.
We observed a negligible hysteresis on the reverse scan (0 V to Voc) at a low scan speed of 10 mV s−1 for the DPA–ANT–DPA and Spiro-OMeTAD based devices, which results in an efficiency decrease from 16% to 15.2% for the Spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs and 11.5% to 10.8% for the DPA–ANT–DPA HTM based PSCs. The excessively small band off-set of the HOMO between the perovskite and DPA–ANT–DPA HTL may hamper the effective hole transport ability (as shown in Fig. 2(a)).38 We observed that even though the work function of DPA–ANT–DPA was very close to that of the perovskite active layer, a respectable PCE can still be achieved without doping. The comparable Voc of 1.0 V observed for DPA–ANT–DPA to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD based devices was due to the very small band off-set and HOMO value difference between DPA–ANT–DPA and the perovskite active layer.38 Furthermore, the non-doped DPA–ANT–TPA based PSC shows a short circuit current (Jsc = 16.2 mA cm−2) comparable to that of Spiro-OMeTAD (Jsc = 21 mA cm−2), which was due to the shallower HOMO of DPA–ANT–DPA that allows for effective hole extraction.
The PCE of 11.5% obtained using the non-doped DPA–ANT–DPA HTM was high when compared to the other HTMs reported in the literature when taking the dopant-free aspect into account.4,39–41 As shown in Fig. 3c, the devices with DPA–ANT–DPA exhibit external quantum efficiency (EQE) values above 65–70% from 365 nm to 650 nm covering the entire UV region with the highest EQE of 70% observed at 470 nm. The statistics for the 83 PSCs prepared using DPA–ANT–DPA and Spiro-OMeTAD exhibits an average device efficiency of 10.4% and 12.8%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3d.
The stability of PSC devices is one of the most discussed issues within the PSC community and a major hurdle for commercialization. Since the active layer in the perovskite devices is an organometallic salt, it has a strong tendency to absorb water. Among the different degradation factors, ambient humidity is one of the most critical parameters for the degradation of Spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs, which is attributed to the hydrophilic nature of the active layer used in the PSC.42–44 Taking these parameters into account, we studied the stability of the champion devices without any encapsulation under high humidity conditions (relative humidity (RH) = 57%, temperature = 22 °C, under dark conditions) for our newly developed DPA–ANT–DPA and standard Spiro-OMeTAD HTMs (as shown in Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  The photovoltaic performance of the DPA–ANT–DPA (a) and Spiro-OMeTAD (b) based CH3NH3PbI3 PSC devices upon aging in humidity ≥57% (the fresh and aged PSC devices performance are shown in the satellite table). The stability test/aging for 50 h for the DPA–ANT–DPA HTM based cells and 10 h for the Spiro-OMeTAD HTM based PSC, without encapsulation; after each consecutive measurement, the PSCs were kept in an ambient humidity set-up with a RH of 57%, temperature = 22 °C. 
The simple stability set-up used is shown in Fig. S8a and b (ESI†) and the photovoltaic performance was measured at 1000 W m−2 (AM 1.5G) using regular aging intervals. The photovoltaic properties of our novel DPA–ANT–DPA and Spiro-OMeTAD during the aging tests are detailed in Fig. 4a and b. Additionally, the efficiency of all the HTMs based devices was evaluated under identical conditions and depicted in Fig. 4. The degradation test results show that the Spiro-OMeTAD HTM based devices degraded at a faster rate when compared to the DPA–ANT–DPA based devices. The Spiro-OMeTAD HTM based devices showed a rapid drop in the PCE from 16% (fresh device) to 2.3% after aging under 57% RH for only 10 h. The Spiro-OMeTAD HTM based devices showed a significant drop in current from Jsc = 21 to 7.1 mA cm−2. On the other hand, the DPA–ANT–DPA HTM based devices maintained a Jsc of 16 mA cm−2 with a very small drop in the open circuit voltage Voc from 1.0 to 0.93 V, which resulted in a small drop in the PCE from 11.5% to 10.3%, even after a prolonged exposure of 50 h to a high relative humidity of 57%. This clearly shows the improved device stability of the PSCs made using DPA–ANT–DPA HTM over the Spiro-OMeTAD based devices.
Considering that the top-layer of the PSC device plays an important role in preventing water ingress,45 we performed contact angle measurements (as shown in Fig. 5(a–c)) as well morphological measurements on the top-surface of the PSCs (as shown in Fig. 6) to further investigate the reason for the dramatic improvement in the stability of DPA–ANT–DPA.

(c) The top-view of Spiro-OMeTAD on perovskite and (c1) magnified top-view of the Spiro-OMeTAD layer; the red mark highlights the crystals formed due to the addition of the dopant. To mimic the device architecture, all the layers were deposited on a FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2 substrate. 

Fig. 5(a) shows the low contact angle of 21° of a water droplet on the CH3NH3PbI3 surface, which confirms the good wetting behaviour and highly hydrophilic nature of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite active layer used in this study. The doped Spiro-OMeTAD layers deposited on top of the perovskite shows a contact angle of 47.9°, indicating a reduced albeit still high degree of hydrophilicity of the overall device. Snaith et al. already demonstrated the cause behind the hydrophilic nature of Spiro-OMeTAD based HTM devices, which is mainly attributed to the doping of Spiro-OMeTAD using hygroscopic LiTFSI salts.45 We would like to make it clear that though the Spiro-OMeTAD molecule itself is non-polar by nature due to the presence of four methoxy groups on the phenylene units, it becomes hydrophilic due to the addition of the dopant salts. The contact angle measured using our newly developed DPA–ANT–DPA HTMs surface without using any dopant leads to an impressive elevated contact angle of 108° with lower wetting (enhancing hydrophobicity); this is likely responsible for the higher stability of the devices reported herein using our new HTM.
Moreover, it was further necessary to study the surface morphology of the HTMs in order to understand the different wetting and de-wetting behaviour, and hence probe the reason for the hygroscopic nature of the films. Fig. 6 shows the surface morphology of the perovskite, DPA–ANT–DPA and Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film in Fig. 6(a) shows good quality and larger crystalline grains ranging from 500–800 nm. The good quality of the perovskite film was further confirmed by the high photoluminescence (PL) intensity obtained (Fig. 7). The HTM DPA–ANT–DPA deposited on perovskite shows a homogeneous and uniform surface coverage over a large area (Fig. 6(b)), while the Spiro-OMeTAD deposited on perovskite shows an inhomogeneous and rough surface in addition to the formation of small aggregates at intervals, as shown in Fig. 6(b and c). These are possibly the crystals formed due to the doping of LiTFSI.46 This was further confirmed from the observation that in the absence of doping with tertiary butyl pyridine (tBP) and LiTFSI salts in Spiro-OMeTAD, we did not observe any aggregate formation.
 Fig. 7  (a) The steady state photoluminescence (PL) measured on the bare perovskite film (black) and HTL deposited on the perovskite. The brown curve represents Spiro-OMeTAD deposited on perovskite and the blue curve represents DPA–ANT–DPA deposited on perovskite. (b) The time-resolved PL taken at an excitation wavelength of 765 nm observed for the perovskite films with the different HTLs. A 5 mW picosecond pulsed diode laser at 635 nm was used to irradiate the perovskite and HTL. 
These electron microscope observations along with the contact angle measurements clearly correlate with the higher PSC stability observed for the DPA–ANT–DPA HTM based solar cells when compared to the Spiro-OMeTAD HTM based solar cells. The improved homogeneous coverage of the DPA–ANT–DPA films along with de-wetting, hydrophobic nature observed from the contact angle measurements results in devices with much higher stability, whereas the Spiro-OMeTAD HTM films with rough, inhomogeneous surface, small to large pin-holes and an increased wetting and hydrophilic nature exhibited lower stability. The good coverage along with the hydrophobic nature of the DPA–ANT–DPA HTM on the perovskite layer assures the protection of the perovskite thin film layer from exposure to oxygen,44,45 humidity43 and heat.47 In summary, the homogeneous surface morphology and de-wetting characteristics offered by the novel anthanthrone (ANT) core with extended diphenylamine (DPA) in the DPA–ANT–DPA films have significantly contributed to protecting the underneath perovskite layer from degradation.
The steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence based on a simple architecture, glass/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM, is shown in Fig. 7. In order to eliminate any quenching effect related to electron transfer to the oxide layer, we avoided the use of a TiO2 layer while performing the PL measurements. During these PL measurements, we had to make sure that the photoluminescence quenching was only caused by the HTL and was not due to any other materials. All the HTL thin films were excited at 635 nm. From the data, it was quite clear that the bare perovskite film without any HTM (black curve) exhibits a high PL emission intensity as a result of the formation of a good quality (crystalline and homogeneous surface) perovskite film, which was also seen from the surface morphology of the perovskite film (Fig. 6a). Upon deposition of the HTM on the perovskite layer, a significant reduction in the PL emission was observed. The perovskite films covered with DPA–ANT–DPA HTL (blue curve) display a stronger PL quenching (∼90%) than the films covered with the Spiro-OMeTAD (∼60%) HTL. The DPA–ANT–DPA HTM exhibits efficient exciton dissociation efficiency, comparable to that of doped Spiro-OMeTAD. This ensures a efficient charge generation and high hole mobility as well as low recombination at the DPA–ANT–DPA/CH3NH3PbI3 interface.
A time-resolved photoluminescence study was performed to verify the improved hole transport properties and the results shown in Fig. 7b. The bare perovskite films deposited on a glass substrate as well as with the different HTLs show biphasic kinetics. The fast component decays in picoseconds (due to an 80 ps laser pulse) and the slower component has a time constant of 10–15 ns. The fast component represents trap filling. As the hole transfer films are deposited on a bare glass-perovskite layer for direct probing, this gives us a good estimation of the quenching of the photoluminescence due to the HTLs only.
For the bare perovskite sample (glass/perovskite) we obtained a high PL intensity and lifetime of 8 ns. As shown previously,48 a highly crystalline and good quality perovskite sample shows a life time of ∼8–10 ns, which confirms the quality of the perovskite films we used in this study. After the introduction of the DPA–ANT–DPA HTL above the perovskite layer, the average decay time (τ) was decreased to ∼20.2 ns. The fast decay lifetime (τ1) of both HTMs decreased from 33 ns (bare perovskite without HTL) to 18 ns for the DPA–ANT–DPA and 16 ns for Spiro-OMeTAD HTLs. At the same time, the weight fraction increased from 3% (bare perovskite film) to 23.5% for the DPA–ANT–DPA and 25.7% for the Spiro-OMeTAD HTLs. This clearly shows the complete hole extraction as well charge dissociation exerted by our novel undoped DPA–ANT–DPA HTM is competent when compared with the traditional doped Spiro-OMeTAD HTM.
Currently, among the competitive D–A–D type HTMs reported in the literature using both planar and mesoporous devices, JY5 and JY6 HTMs in planar devices16,17 and BTPA-3 and H1 HTMs based mesoporous layouts exhibit lower performance.6,15 A brief comparison based on the similar device structure and approximately equivalent working area among our new HTM, DPA–ANT–DPA, with BTPA-3 and H1 was made and shown in Table 3. Overall, the photovoltaic performance of the DPA–ANT–DPA based device achieves the highest PCE of 11.5% among all these materials without any additives, whereas the BTPA-3-based device exhibits a close PCE of 9.81% using Li-TFSI and tBP as dopants. Notably, though the novel DPA–ANT–DPA and H1 have similar HOMO energy levels, the PCE of the H1 based device is very low (∼5.8%) due to its small Jsc value and the use of a different type of perovskite as the active layer. Moreover, the device with the new DPA–ANT–DPA HTM has a superior stability when compared with the reference device based on Spiro-OMeTAD.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized a new highly scalable small molecule DPA–ANT–DPA HTM based on an innovative low cost anthanthrone dye as the core using a D–A–D molecular design. The synthesis of DPA–ANT–DPA was elegantly conducted in one-step via a simple coupling protocol using a common anthanthrone dye as the central core and diphenylamine as the end-capping unit. A detailed comparison of the optoelectronic properties of the DPA–ANT–DPA and traditional Spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs was performed and it found that the HOMO energy level of DPA–ANT–DPA was close to the active perovskite energy level, assuring a hole transport ability with minimal energy off-set. Upon evaluating DPA–ANT–DPA as HTM, without doping in the PSC devices, the highest power conversion efficiency of 11.5% was achieved. The DPA–ANT–DPA HTM not only exhibits a respectable performance in comparison to other undoped HTMs, but also shows the increased reproducibility of the PSCs when compared to Spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs and a lower cost and straightforward one-step synthesis with easy purification. One of the most important features of the DPA–ANT–DPA based PSC devices is their environmental stability, which is much higher than that of traditional Spiro-OMeTAD. The reason behind the significantly higher stability of our new DPA–ANT–DPA based devices was also investigated in detail and it was found that the hydrophobic nature and homogeneous coverage are responsible factors and they are a result of the chemical structure of the central ANT core and more extended structure of DPA on the perovskite capping layer. The DPA–ANT–DPA HTM without additives resulted in a Voc of 1.0 V. The improved charge collection efficiency in the devices prepared with the DPA–ANT–DPA HTL (as seen from effective PL quenching) when compared to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD HTL leads to a higher short circuit current and photovoltage. By using the low cost fused anthanthrone dye, it is possible to design new efficient, stable and low cost scalable HTMs for roll-to-roll printed PSC modules and prototypes for large area applications.

 	Fig. 4  The photovoltaic performance of the DPA–ANT–DPA (a) and Spiro-OMeTAD (b) based CH3NH3PbI3 PSC devices upon aging in humidity ≥57% (the fresh and aged PSC devices performance are shown in the satellite table). The stability test/aging for 50 h for the DPA–ANT–DPA HTM based cells and 10 h for the Spiro-OMeTAD HTM based PSC, without encapsulation; after each consecutive measurement, the PSCs were kept in an ambient humidity set-up with a RH of 57%, temperature = 22 °C.	 

 	Fig. 5  The contact angle measurements performed on the (a) CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, (b) Spiro-OMeTAD and (c) DPA–ANT–DPA surfaces deposited on a FTO/c-TiO2/meso-TiO2 substrate.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) The surface image of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film deposited on top of FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2. (b) The top-view of DPA–ANT–DPA on the perovskite layer. (c) The top-view of Spiro-OMeTAD on perovskite and (c1) magnified top-view of the Spiro-OMeTAD layer; the red mark highlights the crystals formed due to the addition of the dopant. To mimic the device architecture, all the layers were deposited on a FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2 substrate.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) The steady state photoluminescence (PL) measured on the bare perovskite film (black) and HTL deposited on the perovskite. The brown curve represents Spiro-OMeTAD deposited on perovskite and the blue curve represents DPA–ANT–DPA deposited on perovskite. (b) The time-resolved PL taken at an excitation wavelength of 765 nm observed for the perovskite films with the different HTLs. A 5 mW picosecond pulsed diode laser at 635 nm was used to irradiate the perovskite and HTL.
