    , Accepted 14th June 2017First published on 14th June 2017AbstractAn ultrathin, freestanding NiSx nanoporous thin-film was developed by facile electrochemical deposition, etching, anodization and chemical vapor treatments. The NiSx nanoporous thin-film shows excellent reversible insertion/extraction of Mg ions and long-term cycling performance, which is an ideal energy storage device for small/micro-size electronic and medical devices.
There is increasing demand for wearable, portable, and even foldable or rollable electronic devices in the fields of displays, sensors, communication, medical equipment and artificial electronic devices, resulting in the fabrication of highly flexibile, lightweight, and efficient energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors.1–6 To make these smart devices promising for practical applications, it is necessary to improve their electrochemical performance in terms of areal capacity (Ca, mA h cm−2) and volumetric capacity (Cv, mA h cm−3), which are more suitable for small/micro-size electronic devices.7,8
In the past few years, several new battery systems, such as magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs), aluminum batteries, and calcium batteries, have attracted attention due to their low cost and high performance. Due to its high negative reduction potential (−2.4 V vs. NHE), high theoretical specific capacity (2205 mA h g−1), and high theoretical volumetric capacity (3833 mA h g−1), the Mg-ion battery is a promising alternative energy system.9–11 To date, various materials have been investigated for MIBs. Shao et al. reported the synthesis and application of Bi nanotubes as high-performance anode materials for rechargeable MIBs. The as-prepared Bi anode delivered high specific capacity (3430 mA h cmBi−3) and showed excellent stability with high Coulombic efficiency.12 Liang et al. combined a G-MoS2 cathode and a N-Mg anode for MIBs, achieving a high operating voltage of 1.8 V and a first cycle discharge capacity of 170 mA h g−1.13
Kinetically, MIBs present sluggish Mg intercalation/insertion and diffusion in cathode materials. Therefore, the search for new cathode materials is urgent to increase the Mg intercalation/insertion and diffusion for MIBs. Binders and other additives are commonly applied in preparing battery electrodes, which can cause unwanted side effects that reduce electrode conductivity. Hence, developing binder-free electrode materials is another strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of MIBs. For electronic and medical devices, the cycling performance is a key point in application. Therefore, it is necessary to develop energy storage devices with excellent long-term cyclability.
To address the above issues, we developed a facile approach to prepare an ultrathin, freestanding, nanoporous layer (NPL) material using nickel sulfides (NiSx), which can be used directly as a binder-free electrode for MIBs. The as-prepared electrode combines the current collector and active materials within a NPL, which not only serves as the conductive framework to improve the conductivity, but also avoids the use of binders and other additives. The nanoporous structure increases the surface area to provide more sites and pathways for ion/mass diffusion, enhancing the electrochemical performance. The NiSx nanoporous thin-film shows excellent reversible insertion/extraction of Mg ion activity and long-term cycling performance, which is ideal for small/micro-size electronic devices.
A typical process to prepare a NiSx NPL is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a (see the Experimental section for details): (i) a freestanding Ni layer with a thickness of 2.0 μm was electrodeposited in the bath and removed from the substrate; (ii) a porous Ni layer was produced by electrochemical etching; (iii) a nanoporous NiO layer was obtained after electrochemical anodic treatment; and (iv) the NiSx NPL was finally produced by sulfuration in a CVD system. Micrometer-size pores can be found due to the electrochemical etching treatment (Fig. S1, ESI†). From the top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. S1b and c, ESI†) images, a rough surface with a uniformly porous structure throughout the entire layer can be observed, indicating that the electrochemical deposit was completely converted into a NPL after anodization. Additionally, a pore size of around 50 nm is also created by anodization. The micrometer-size pores can reduce the mass of the electrode, and the nanometer-size pores increase the surface area to provide more sites and pathways for ion/mass diffusion, enhancing the electrochemical performance.

The morphology and crystalline profiles were further examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A highly porous structure with the pore size 30 nm can be observed, as shown in Fig. 1b. The crystal structure was confirmed by high-resolution TEM images in Fig. 1c. The lattice fringe with a distance of 0.29 nm denotes the (110) plane of Ni3S2, while the spacings are estimated to be 0.28 and 0.32 nm, which are well indexed as the (200) and (111) lattice orientations of the NiS2 phase. The results are consistent with the previous reports.14,15 Elemental mappings in the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum of Ni and S from the NiSx NPL, as presented in Fig. 2d, suggest a uniform and homogeneous distribution across the NPL.

The physical composition of the as-prepared NiSx NPL was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 2a, the diffraction peaks located at 27.2°, 31.5°, 35.4°, 38.8°, 45.2° and 53.5° are assigned to (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), and (311) planes of cubic structure NiS2 (Vaesite, JCPDS # 11-0099).15 The diffraction peaks at 21.8°, 37.9°, 49.7°, and 54.9° are in accordance with (101), (003), (113) and (122) planes of hexagonal structure Ni3S2 (Heazlewoodite, JCPDS # 85-1802).14 The XRD results confirm the co-existence of NiS2 and Ni3S2 (NiSx), which agree with the HRTEM images in Fig. 1c. The co-existence of NiS2 and Ni3S2 was further characterized by Raman spectroscopy in Fig. 2b. The peaks at 270, 282, and 476 cm−1 can be attributed to the vibration modes of Vaesite, while the rest of the peaks are in good agreement with the vibration modes of Heazlewoodite.16,17
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the chemical states of the as-fabricated NPL. The Ni 2p3/2 peak can be fitted into two spin–orbit doublets, as displayed in Fig. 2c. The peaks located at the binding energies of 854.6 and 855.7 eV are attributed to Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively. 861.8 eV is a satellite peak attributed to Ni 2p3/2. The existence of Ni3+ is mainly attributed to hexagonal Ni3S2, while the Ni2+ is due to cubic NiS2, which is well assigned to the previous results.18–20 The S 2p peak can be simulated into two peaks located at 162.3 and 163.5 eV, consistent with the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbitals. The result indicates that S exhibits divalent ions (S2−) in the NiSx NPL.21,22 These results demonstrate that the crystalline Ni3S2 and NiS2 are prepared successfully.
The electrochemical performances of different samples were measured by galvanostatic charge–discharge testing in a voltage window of 0.2–2 V vs. Mg/Mg2+ (which is equal to 1.0–2.8 V vs. Li/Li+) at a current density of 10 mA cm−3. As shown in Fig. 3a, the NiSx NPL exhibits the largest specific capacity, so we focus our research on this sample as follows. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 was performed to test the electrochemical behavior. From Fig. 3b, it is noted that no oxidation and reduction peaks were observed in the CV curves, indicating a conversion-type cathode behaviour.11 Additionally, it is obvious to find a large cathodic current density in the first cycle because the cell cannot be fully charged due to the test being performed from an open circuit potential of ∼1.25 V. In the 2nd and 3rd cycles, the cathodic current densities are decreased gradually. However, the cathodic current density is still higher than the anodic current density, therefore, indicating that the enhanced cathodic current density is owing to the insertion of Mg2+ into the NiSx electrode.23

A, E, and S mean the sample was treated by anodization, etching and sulfuration, respectively. (b) Cyclic voltammograms of the NiSx NPL electrode with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. (c) Charge–discharge profiles of the NiSx NPL electrode with different current densities. (d) Rate capability of the NiSx NPL electrode. (e) Long-term cycling performance of the NiSx NPL electrode at a current density of 50 mA cm−3. 

Fig. 3c exhibits the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the NiSx electrode with different current densities. The curves with various current densities show similar shapes, confirming the reversible insertion/extraction of Mg ions in the electrode. The largest specific capacity is estimated to be 150 mA h cm−3 at a current density of 10 mA cm−3. It can be difficult to observe the obvious plateaus from all the charge/discharge curves, which is because the insertion/extraction of Mg ions occurs on the surface and the pores of the electrode. The large number of pores contributes to a large surface area to provide more reaction sites and pathways. The residual Ni layer acts as the current collector to connect the active material, enhancing the conductivity of the electrode.
The rate capability with current densities from 10 mA cm−3 to 250 mA cm−3 was further investigated, as presented in Fig. 3d. It is found that the specific capacity of the NiSx NPL gradually decreased with increasing charge–discharge rates, owing to incomplete insertion of magnesium to the inner portions of the electrode at a high current density.12 Moreover, the capability is almost recovered when the current density is returned to the initial 10 mA cm−3, revealing good capacity retention and excellent reversible insertion/extraction of Mg ions. Although the SEM images after different cycles (Fig. S2, ESI†) show that there are changes in the morphology, the changes are not substantial, giving excellent cycling stability.
To better understand the electrochemical performance of the NiSx NPL electrode, its long-term cycling behavior was investigated at a current density of 50 mA cm−3. As exhibited in Fig. 3e, a specific decay can be observed in the first 150 cycles, which is due to the insertion/extraction of Mg ions in the mesopores. After that, the corresponding specific capacity fading is only 3.5%, reflecting excellent cyclability. Significantly, the Coulombic efficiency is close to 100% during the cycling, indicating that no other reaction occurred and representing the promising application for long-cycle Mg-ion batteries.
The CV curves indicated the intercalation behavior as a conversion-type cathode. From the XRD curve in Fig. S3 (ESI†), MgS peaks were observed, which is consistent with CV curves. According to experimental results, it may be concluded that the total electrochemical reactions at the NiSx electrode during charge/discharge processes are addressed as follows:Ni3S2 + 2Mg ↔ 2MgS + 3NiNiS2 + 2Mg ↔ 2MgS + Ni
Energy density is a crucial factor for batteries and researchers are trying their best to improve it. The Ragone plot, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), exhibits the volumetric energy density and power density. The NiSx NPL electrode exhibits the highest volumetric energy density of 250 mW h cm−3, which is higher than those of the equivalent MIB systems. Furthermore, this value is much higher than those of micro-batteries and micro-supercapacitors, while avoiding their complicated design and providing a higher energy density.2,24–27 The higher volumetric energy density is suitable to design high level integration on a chip or mini-scale areal devices, which will broaden the applications of micro-size sensors, and medical and energy storage devices.
From all the above, the ultrathin, freestanding NiSx NPL demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance, due to several reasons: (i) the nanoporous structure provides a large surface area and more active sites/pathways to enhance the ion/mass diffusion; (ii) the freestanding NiSx nanoporous thin-film combines the current collector and active materials together, improving the conductivity of the electrode; and (iii) the as-prepared sample can be used as an electrode, without using any binders and additives, avoiding the edge effect to increase resistance.
In summary, an ultrathin NiSx NPL was fabricated by three electrochemical treatments of deposition, etching and anodization, followed by a single sulfuration process. The as-prepared NiSx NPL combines the current collector and active materials together, providing excellent conductivity. The NiSx NPL can be directly used as a binder-free electrode for Mg-ion batteries. The as-assembled Mg-ion battery delivers excellent electrochemical performance. It is worth pointing out that the NiSx NPL electrode exhibits superior cycling performance. This work provides a promising way to develop high energy and stable electrodes for Mg-ion batteries.
