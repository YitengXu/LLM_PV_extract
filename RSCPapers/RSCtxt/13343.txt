    , Accepted 27th February 2013First published on 12th March 2013AbstractThe hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3)PbI3 may find application in next generation solid-state sensitised solar cells. Although this material and related perovskites were discovered many decades ago, questions remain concerning their diverse structural chemistry and unusual properties. The article presents a review of previous work and provides a detailed description of the preparation, structural characterisation and physical characteristics of (CH3NH3)PbI3. The phase changes exhibited by (CH3NH3)PbI3 have been probed using variable temperature powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction, combined with differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and phase contrast transmission electron microscopy. The optical band gap for (CH3NH3)PbI3 determined by UV-Visible spectroscopy was compared to values obtained from density-of-state simulation of the electronic band structure.
1 Introduction
Recent reports of high conversion efficiencies (>9%) for solid-state sensitised solar cell devices based on the ABX3 inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3)PbI31–3 hold the promise of cost effective solar energy production although reproducible device performance has not been achieved. Many questions remain to be addressed regarding the crystal chemistry of these materials, and the nature of charge transfer, before it will be possible to rationally modify and tailor chemistries and nanostructures in prototype solar cells for greater efficiencies. It is also notable that the rapid expansion of the device literature has overlooked important fundamental studies reaching back some 60 years. Therefore, it is timely to review the sometimes conflicting reports concerning (CH3NH3)PbI3 and related materials, and exploit state-of-the-art methods to revise and evaluate their crystal structures and photo-conversion mechanisms.
2 Crystallographic and functional character of hybrid perovskites
The perovskite aristotype is a cubic Pmm framework structure of composition ABX3, where A (Wyckoff position 1a) is commonly a large cation coordinated to 12 X (3c) anions, B (1b) is a smaller metal bonded to six X anions, and BX6 octahedra are corner-connected to form a three-dimensional framework. The hinged octahedra allow for wide adjustment of the B–X–B bond angle, and several sets of cooperative rotations, known as tilt transitions, promote symmetry reduction of the aristotype.4–6 The process of octahedral tilting must adhere to the principles of space group hierarchy and these relationships provide a powerful tool for guiding structure determination and detecting false structures. In this respect, it is noted that some structures for the (CH3NH3)PbX3 polymorphs are inconsistent with space group principles. Furthermore, for organic–inorganic hybrid-perovskites the interaction of cation ordering and acoustic modes can generate incommensurate phases in many of these compounds.7

ABX3 (A = alkali; B = Ge, Sn, Pb and X = halide): the unusual, and potentially useful, electronic and photoconductive properties of plumbohalide perovskites were identified several decades ago by Møller8,9 who determined the crystal structures of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) and found intense colours ranging from yellow, orange to black for the chloride, bromide and iodide analogues respectively. All the materials were photoconductive with spectral sensitivity maximised in the violet (X = Cl), blue-green (X = Br) and red (X = I) regions.9 X-ray diffraction revealed perovskite hettotypes under ambient conditions that undergo a displacive phase-transition to cubic symmetry at higher temperature. CsPbCl3 was optically birefringent at room temperature, but upon heating, the interference colours changed continuously and disappeared at 46.9 °C. This phenomenon was completely reversible and on cooling the interference colours reappeared. Møller8 reported that below the transition temperature CsPbCl3 was tetragonal, with chlorine displaced from the Pmm special position (½,0,0) to (½,±1/15,±1/15) and caesium ideally at (½,½,½) drawn out in directions perpendicular to the unit-cell faces. Significantly, this early work found that 3D symmetry could not unambiguously describe the mean positions of chlorine, but only their ‘statistical centres of gravity’; subsequently it was suggested that a high level of anion disorder10 and/or incommensuration11,12 was present.
The positioning of Pb2+ at the octahedral ‘B’ site of ABX3 perovskites is unusual, as in most perovskites lead is an A-site cation, but this placement becomes feasible when a large electropositive cation occupies the ‘A’ site. Cs+ most evidently meets this criterion, as do similar sized organic units including methylammonium (MA) (CH3NH3)+, formamidinium (H2N–CHNH2)+ (FA) and tetramethylammonium ((CH3)4N)+ (TMA). The first ‘hybrid’ organic–inorganic perovskites, described almost 35 years ago,13 were based on halide salts of group 14 chalcogenides, with germanium, tin and lead occupying the octahedral B-sites, and MA and TMA radicals inserted in the cages formed by the BX6 octahedra. For these perovskites, superlattices often result due to orientational ordering of the organic cations coupled with tilting and distortion of the octahedra. By introducing longer chain organic components, perovskite-type layer compounds comparable to the Ruddlesden–Popper series are created. These modifications have been comprehensively reviewed by Mitzi et al.14,15
In group 14 elements the outer s2 electron pair can become stereochemically active lone pairs, rather than participating in bonding, a tendency most evident at higher atomic numbers. Clark et al.16 undertook an extensive study of the CsM2+X3 (M2+ = Ge, Sn, Pb; X = Cl, Br, I) compounds and found evidence for the band structure being populated by non-bonding electron pairs. The optical behaviour and electrical conductivity of these phases were presumed to arise from the donation of electron density from M2+ lone-pair electrons to the conduction band formed by overlap with the halogen d states. The greater ionic character of the Pb2+, as compared to Sn2+or Ge2+, reduced the electron density transfer and dominated the optical spectra of the Pb-rich phases. For CsM2+I3 the donation of electron-pairs to iodine d bands was favoured over the self-population by iodine electrons.
A recent temperature-dependent powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction study17 confirmed earlier reports18 by showing that at room temperature CsSnI3 is orthorhombic (Pnma) and with gentle heating converts to the Pmm aristotype via a P4/mbm tetragonal variety (Table 1). In this work, the CsSnI3 system appeared to be unique in combining two generally contraindicative properties, strong photoluminescence and high electrical conductivity. More recently the F doped phase CsSnI2.95F0.05 has achieved one of the highest conversion efficiencies (8.5%) found in solid-state dye-sensitised solar cells.19

ABX3 (A = organic cation; B = Ge, Sn, Pb and X = halide): the effect of s-orbital hybridisation in ABX3 perovskites is to drive the B-atom off the octahedral centre, resulting in alternating long and short B–X bonds in the basal plane that creates a range of functionalities. Among the widely studied Ge analogues, ferroelectric behaviour is found in CsGeCl3,20,21 antiferroelectricity in TMAGeCl3,22 and high Cl-ion conductivity in MAGeCl3.23 For the cubic phases of MAGeCl3,23 TMAGeCl3 (ref. 24) and TMAGeBr3 (ref. 25) the disordered halide ions half-fill and statistically occupy the 6f Wyckoff site of Pmm, rather than a fully occupied 3c site, due to bond switching between Ge–X⋯Ge and Ge⋯X–Ge, i.e. distortion associated with lone-pair activity is a very soft-coupled dynamic reorientation with respect to the organic (TMA or MA) cation. In these cases, the GeX6 coordination is often described as pyramidal with 3 short and 3 long bonds rather than octahedral. In MAGeCl335Cl nuclear quadrupole (NQR) measurements found that reorientation of the pyramidal GeCl3− is the origin of the high ionic conductivity.23–26
X-ray diffraction has been the primary source of crystallographic information for these perovskites, but scattering is dominated by higher atomic number elements, and is relatively insensitive to the organic component that controls phase transitions. This was addressed by Yamada et al.26 who carried out a powder neutron diffraction study on deuterated MAGeCl3CD3ND3GeCl3, but substitution of H for D strongly shifted the polymorphic phase transition temperatures with four distinct structures in the temperature range 2–475 K (Table 2).

The crystallochemical properties of Sn-based analogues are intermediate to Ge and Pb compounds, such that the inorganic sublattice of MASnBr3 in the Pmm phase has stronger and more complex octahedral distortions than the Pb-based analogues. A powder X-ray diffraction study of MASnCl3 showed successive transitions to high symmetry phases at 283, 307, 331 and 463 K with increasing temperature (Table 3);27 the high temperature (463 K) phase was cubic perovskite with lower temperature distortions containing a pyramidal SnCl3− ion. Modification of Sn-coordination was established with 119Sn NMR spectra and suggested the onset of chloride-ion diffusion just below the phase-transition to cubic symmetry.

A powder neutron diffraction study of deuterated MASnBr3CD3ND3SnBr3 found a cubic polymorph (Pmm, Z = 1, and a = 5.899 Å) at room temperature, which at 195 K transformed to a rhombohedral superstructure with cell doubling in three directions (R3c or Rc, Z = 8, a = 11.767 Å, and α = 88.997°).28 A subsequent synchrotron XRD study showed no evidence of the rhombohedral phase on cooling from 230–100 K, but did identify an orthorhombic phase in the temperature range of 230–188 K (Pmc21, Z = 2, a = 5.89406(17) Å, b = 8.3862(2) Å, and c = 8.2406(2) Å).29 At 30 K the presence of a triclinic phase was suggested, and indexing of Bragg reflections gave the best candidate cell as having a = 8.345 Å, b = 8.135 Å, c = 5.899 Å, α = 92.14°, β = 89.95°, and γ = 91.42° in P1 symmetry. The lack of an inversion centre (P) was assumed to be due to its absence in the orthorhombic cell, but as noted in this study, it is impossible to directly transform Pmm to Pmc21 from pure octahedral tilts, and an intermediary phase was not identified. A tetragonal P4/mbm phase was suggested as the most likely candidate, by analogy with the non-cubic phase encountered on cooling the alkali analogue CsSnBr3.30
A single crystal neutron diffraction study of the high temperature Pmm phase of MAPbBr3 revealed a highly disordered structure. This work suggested positions for the C/N and H sites of the methylammonium groups but it was noted that there was a large anisotropy in all the atomic displacement parameters.31 A powder neutron diffraction study of partially deuterated MAPbBr3CH3ND3PbBr3 found that the ‘phase IV’ of this series was centrosymmetric, Pnma: Z = 4, a = 7.9434(4) Å, b = 11.8499(5) Å, and c = 8.5918(4) Å at 11 K,32 leading to speculation that the corresponding iodide would be isostructural. In the original work of Poglitsch and Weber four different phases were identified for the lead bromide series and space groups suggested from the X-ray extinction conditions at various temperatures (T > 236.9 cubic Pmm; 155.1 < T < 236.9 tetragonal I4/mcm and 149.5 < T < 155.1 tetragonal P4/mmm; T < 144.5 orthorhombic Pna21).33 The space group P4/mmm was erroneously suggested for a second tetragonal intermediary phase as this cannot be achieved by octahedral tilting from the Pmm aristotype.6 High pressure structural studies on MAPbBr3 showed that just below 1 GPa the sample transformed from Pmm to Im and amorphised at 2.8 GPa without the cations undergoing long-range orientational ordering.34 The Im cell has a doubled cell parameter with respect to the untilted Pmm phase and the sample recrystallised upon the release of pressure. In general, phase transitions through cooling or applied pressure are often the same but for the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites the Pmm → Im transition is presently unique. This implies that the energy gain for orientational ordering was low and volume reduction is the driving force for transitions of these compounds under pressure.
The synthesis of MAPbI3 was first described by Weber13 who reported the cubic perovskite (Pmm, Z = 1) at high temperature. Since the cubic structure only contains one formula unit per unit cell, the noncentrosymmetric methylammonium ions (CH3NH3)+ with C3v symmetry must be orientationally disordered to satisfy Oh symmetry, such that the radial cation is statistically distributed over eight identical (x,x,x) positions, in which the C and N atoms show random distribution inside the eight tetrahedral interstices of the A-site cubooctahedra of the perovskite aristotype i.e. 24 disordered states. Rapid reorientation motions of (CH3NH3)+ were detected by variable temperature NMR that revealed two phase transitions as the temperature decreases, as a result of progressive ordering of the (CH3NH3)+ ions.35 The first phase change to tetragonal I4/mcm (Tc = 327.4 K) lowered the number of disordered states of the (CH3NH3)+ to 8, while in a lower temperature Pmc21 orthorhombic phase (Tc = 162.2 K) the organic cations are fixed. Kawamura et al.36 studied the tetragonal to cubic transition by means of single crystal X-ray diffraction and found that with decreasing temperature the rotation angle of the octahedron increased monotonically, suggesting that this is an order parameter of the cubic–tetragonal transition. The cubic structures of the MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) were also studied by single crystal X-ray diffraction, which revealed heavily disordered structures with high atomic displacement parameters, particularly those of the anions.10
The phase transitions in MAPbI3 have also been studied using calorimetric and infrared spectroscopy.37 This work found an orthorhombic → tetragonal transition at 161.4 K, with the tetragonal → cubic transition at 330.4 K. While both phase transitions were of first-order, the higher temperature phase change was close to second-order. The observed entropies were consistent with order–disorder transitions interpreted with three models where the methylammonium ions disordered with respect to the orientation of the C–N axis itself and around the C–N axis. It was found that the infrared line width of particular vibrations of the methylammonium ions changed markedly with temperature due to hindered rotational motion in the cubic and tetragonal phases.37
The dielectric properties of MAPbI333,38 show a discontinuity of the real part of the dielectric permittivity at the orthorhombic → tetragonal phase transition, but with the tetragonal → cubic transition showing no apparent change. These observations would be consistent with the methylammonium ions being fully disordered in the cubic and tetragonal phases, and completely ordered in the orthorhombic phase.
Herein, we report the synthesis of MAPbI3 in both poly- and single-crystalline forms that have been crystallographically characterised using variable temperature single crystal X-ray diffraction, variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction and phase contrast transmission electron microscope imaging. The higher temperature polymorphic transitions were monitored using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The optical band gap for MAPbI3 determined by UV-Visible spectroscopy was compared to values obtained from density-of-state simulation of the electronic band structure.
3 Experimental
3.1 Synthesis

Method 1. 
Polycrystalline MAPbI3 was prepared by precipitation from a hydroiodic acid solution. Following the method described by Poglitsch and Weber33 2.5 g of lead(II) acetate (Chemical Reagents, Sigma) was dissolved in 10 ml of a concentrated (57% by weight) aqueous HI contained in a pyrex test tube and heated in a water bath. An additional 2 ml of HI solution with 0.597 g of CH3NH2 (40% soluble in water, Merck) was added to the solution. A black precipitate that formed upon cooling from 100 °C to 46 °C over 6 hours was then filtered and dried (100 °C/10 hours). It proved essential to maintain the solution above 40 °C as lower temperatures favour the incorporation of water of crystallisation and the formation of yellow crystals of MA4PbI6·2H2O.39 Large MAPbI3 crystals were grown as described but with a very much slower cooling rate. Black crystals up to 2 mm long were obtained by cooling the solution over 4 days. Crystallisation proceeded most rapidly at approximately 70 °C.


Method 2. 
MAPbI3 was synthesised using the method described by Im et.al.1 from an equimolar mixture of MAI and PbI2 in gamma-butyrolactone. To begin, MAI was synthesised by reacting a concentrated aqueous solution of hydroiodic acid (Sigma Aldrich) with methylamine (40% in methanol) at 0 °C for 2 h with constant stirring. After evaporation at 50 °C in a rotary evaporator the resulting precipitant was washed three times with ethyl ether and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. Equimolar mixtures of the as-synthesised MAI and PbI2 (99%, Sigma Aldrich) in gamma-butyrolactone (Sigma Aldrich) were left to stir overnight at 60 °C. The MAPbI3 product was obtained by drop-casting the as-prepared solutions on to glass substrates, which were then heated to 100 °C and annealed for 30 min. Crystalline MAPbI3 was recovered from the glass after cooling.

3.2 Crystallographic characterisation

Powder X-ray diffraction. 
Phase purity was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns collected with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Bragg–Brentano geometry) equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray tube operated at 40 kV and 40 mA using a step size of 0.02° and a time per step of 4 s. Samples were mounted in a top-loaded trough, which was rotated during data collection. Under these conditions, the intensity of the strongest reflection was approximately 10000 counts. Experimental fitting of the X-ray data was carried out from 10–140° 2θ using TOPAS V4.1 (ref. 40) and employing the fundamental parameter approach41 and a full axial divergence model.42
The tetragonal → cubic phase transition was investigated using variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction. In situ XRD data were collected in asymmetric reflection mode under a static helium atmosphere on an INEL Equinox 3000 (Inel, Artenay, France) equipped with an XRK-900 reactor chamber (Anton-Paar, Graz, Austria), a curved position sensitive detector (Ine, Artenay, France), a copper Kα source and a Ge-(111) focussing mirror. The material was mounted on a closed steel sample holder and measured with a fixed incident beam angle of 5°. Two different heating experiments were conducted. In the first, MAPbI3 was heated to 85 °C in five degree steps starting from 25 °C, with data collected for 5 minutes at each holding temperature. The second experiment employed a continuous heating ramp at a rate of 1° min−1 during which 30 measurements of 120 seconds were performed. Each measurement corresponds to a temperature span of 2 °C; the final temperature of each measurement was recorded in the measurement file. Five empty sample holder measurements were conducted at room temperature in order to establish the chamber background. First, the data were truncated to an angular range of 4 to 60° in 2θ. Then the average of the 5 background measurements were subtracted from each pattern in order to get the pure diffraction patterns without any chamber contributions. Finally, all individual diffraction patterns of each experiment were collated into a single xTy – file (x = 2θ, T = temperature, and y = intensity). DPlot43 was used to generate the figures displaying the results from these experiments. The variation in lattice parameters with temperature was extracted from a Pawley fit of the diffraction patterns and assuming a tetragonal cell with lattice parameters close to those previously reported. The zero-error shift was refined in the data collected at 25 °C and fixed at the same value for all subsequent temperatures. The sample displacement was refined in all datasets with T > 25 °C but constrained to take a value less than that obtained in the previous temperature measurement. This constraint was used because a prior measurement with an Al2O3 standard showed that the thermal expansion of the sample holder leads to increasingly lower values of sample displacement.


Single crystal X-ray diffraction. 
A small fragment (approximately 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm) was cleaved from one of the solution grown single crystals. Data were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex II three-circle diffractometer at various temperatures between room temperature and 100 K using Mo Kα radiation with a graphite monochromator over the angular range 2.5 to 30.5° 2θ. The Saint module, deployed within Apex II, was used for reflection integration and performing Lorentz polarisation and multiscan absorption corrections. A total of 17319 reflections with I > 3σ(I) were collected and the structures were refined using Jana 2006 (ref. 44) utilising the Superflip45 structure–solution algorithm. Three dimensional difference Fourier maps were visualised using the software VESTA.46


Transmission electron microscopy. 
Powdered samples deposited on holey carbon copper grids were analysed using by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL JEM 2100F instrument equipped with a double-tilt holder. Field limiting apertures for selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were 5, 20 and 60 μm in diameter. High-resolution images were collected using a high-contrast objective aperture of 20 μm, corresponding to a nominal point-to-point resolution of 0.17 nm. Simulation of kinetic and multi-beam electron diffraction patterns as a function of crystal thickness and beam divergence was performed using JEMS.47 Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was carried out using a JEOL JEM 2100F microscope operating at 200 kV. EELS spectra were recorded with an energy dispersion of 0.25 eV per ch, and the background was subtracted by fitting a region before the ionisation edge with the power-law model followed by extrapolation and removal of the background from under the edge.

3.3 Thermal analysis
Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis was performed on a TGA Q500 V6.7 (TA Instruments) in an interval from 34 °C to 500 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 under Ar gas and in air with a flow rate of 40 ml min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted on a Q10 V9.9 Build 303 calorimeter (TA Instruments) at a rate of 5 °C min−1 over a temperature range from 25 °C to 200 °C under nitrogen. Approximately 10 mg of MAPbI3 was used in each experiment.
3.4 Diffuse UV-Visible spectroscopy
The optical diffuse reflectance spectra of MAPbI3 perovskite powder were measured at room temperature using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) with an integrating sphere attachment (ISR-3100) operating in the 300–1500 nm region. Highly refined barium sulfate powder (Wako, pure) was used as a reflectance standard.
3.5 Electronic structure calculations
Lattice constants and atomic coordinates derived from the present study were used to calculate the electronic band structures and the densities of the states (DOSs) for the polymorphs without further optimisation. The calculations were based on density functional theory48 (DFT) where the generalised gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)49 was used to represent the exchange and correlation energy of the electrons with the CASTEP50 code. The Brillouin zone summation was performed using 4 × 4 × 4 k-point grids for sampling in the Brillouin zone. In the cubic (Pmm) and tetragonal (I4/mcm) phases, the CH3NH3+ cation is dynamically disordered.27 Takahashi et al.51 performed the band structure calculation using fixed CH3NH3+ for the same class of semiconducting perovskite halides MASnI3, however this reduced the symmetry and made it difficult to determine accurate band structures.52 Based on the previous studies,53–55 the electronic properties are strongly dependent on the inorganic components, i.e. the [PbI6]−4 networks. Therefore CH3NH3+ was ignored in our calculations and a uniform background charge density was added to neutralise the charge, except for the orthorhombic (Pnma) phase, from which the atomic positions of CH3NH3+ were determined by single crystal XRD.
4 Results and discussion
The methods used to synthesise MAPbI3 were successful in preparing high quality samples in both poly- and single-crystalline forms (Fig. 1). All samples were black, but slowly turned yellow when exposed to a humid atmosphere. The single crystals of MAPbI3 generally formed as dodecahedra, with some examples exhibiting faceting consistent with rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedra, which is a typical crystal habit of a body centred tetragonal lattice, in agreement with the reported structure at room temperature (space group I4/mcm). Using the lattice parameters and space group for the tetragonal structure‡ reported by Kawamura et al.36 a Pawley fit of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern showed that the desired phase had been successfully synthesised (Fig. 2).

At higher temperatures (≈327–330 K; ≈54–57 °C) the tetragonal perovskite reportedly becomes cubic. To investigate this transition in more detail we carried out variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction on an Inel Equinox diffractometer that has a large detector and collects intensity data over the entire 2θ range simultaneously, and so is ideal for monitoring phase transitions or in situ reactions. Comparison of the calculated powder X-ray diffraction patterns for MAPbI3 in cubic (Pmm) and tetragonal (I4/mcm) symmetry (Fig. 3) show that these polymorphs are readily differentiated by monitoring the intensities of the {211} and {213} reflections as they are sufficiently separated from Bragg reflections expected in cubic symmetry. The {211} reflection has a higher calculated intensity so any change in symmetry would be detected more easily by monitoring this reflection. The variable temperature XRD patterns collected at 2 °C intervals between 25 and 85 °C show that close to 57 °C there is a clear reduction in {211} positioned at 23.5° 2θ, which gradually disappears towards higher temperature (Fig. 4 and 5). Although there is a large change in diffraction intensity at 57 °C weak scattering persists up to 75 °C. This change in intensity is in agreement with previously reported transition temperatures and also with the DSC plot where heating and cooling curves yield maxima at 57.3 °C and 56.0 °C respectively (Fig. 6 and 7). The DSC peaks are asymmetric (Fig. 6), which may be indicative of a transient intermediate phase undetected by powder X-ray diffraction. One possibility could be a Pmm to Im transition analogous to that found in the high pressure study of MAPbBr3,34 however, further work is needed to verify this. The origin of differences in the transition temperatures shown in the heating and cooling plots is unclear but they may have arisen from the small amount of absorbed H2O incorporated at room temperature (Fig. 7). This is supported by a feature in the DSC plot close to 100 °C in the heating curve, which is absent in the cooling curve. There is an inflection in the cooling curve at approximately 75 °C, absent in the heating curve, that corresponds to the initial appearance of the {211} reflection in the variable temperature powder XRD study. The presence of absorbed H2O is also in agreement with a TGA experiment carried out in air which showed a small mass loss at T > 80 °C (ca. 0.3% of the original mass). Previous TGA experiments carried out in air showed that the perovskite phase is stable up to ∼280 °C, after which there is an abrupt and significant mass loss of 47.3%, suggestive of complete decomposition.1 The volatilisation of (CH3NH3)I + ½I2 would account for an approximate 46.1% weight loss, however, as the TGA is conducted in air this is likely to proceed with the co-formation of a lead oxide iodide such as Pb2OI2. The decomposition of PbI2 in air is complex and the TGA study of Krämer and Post56 identified several lead oxide iodide phases during conversion of PbI2 to PbO. For comparison, a TGA experiment under argon gas using perovskite that had been stored in a dry-box and therefore free from absorbed water found the sample to be stable up to ∼300 °C, and the 66.6% weight loss at 360 °C is consistent with the complete decomposition to Pb metal (Fig. 8). The refined lattice parameters as a function of temperature show much more variation in the crystallographic c axis as the temperature approaches the transition temperature and discontinuity in cell volume (Fig. 9 and Tables 4 and 5).

Single crystal X-ray diffraction at room temperature gave the expected tetragonal cell but with reflection conditions consistent with the space group I4/m and not the reported I4/mcm symmetry. However, I4/m symmetry is not compatible with perovskite space group hierarchy,6 and refinement was unsuccessful; the anomaly may be a consequence of extensive disorder from PbI6 tilting or antiphase boundaries. Treating the data in the expected I4/mcm symmetry allowed the location of Pb and I, but as in previous work, the disordered (CH3NH3)+ units cannot be modelled unambiguously.32,36 Notably in the single crystal study of the tetragonal phase carried out by Kawamura et al.36 only reflections where Fo > 5σFo rather than the conventional 3σ precision were used.
MAPbI3 undergoes a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition at approximately 161 K (≈−112 °C).33,38 Poglitsch and Weber used Guinier–Simon photographs to determine the orthorhombic polymorphs of both the bromide and iodide in the non-centrosymmetric space group Pna21.33 However, Swainson et al.32 reclassified the bromide in the centrosymmetric space group Pnma, as refinements and subsequent symmetry analyses in Pna21 was suggestive of missing symmetry elements. This latter work also speculated that the iodide analogue would adopt the same symmetry. In addition, although the polar space group Pna21 was originally assigned to the bromide and iodide, no ferroelectric properties have been reported so far.57 Swainson et al.32 highlighted that in the original work of Poglitsch and Weber,33 no structural information was given and only the Guinier film was used to suggest Pna21.
In this study, single crystal X-ray diffraction at 100 K yielded an orthorhombic, Pnma cell and a structure solution using the Superflip algorithm,45 readily located the Pb and I positions, with the C and N sites identified from the difference Fourier maps. The refinement proceeded smoothly to yield the refinement residuals, atomic coordinates and atomic displacement parameters listed in Tables 6 and 7. Refinements were also performed in the space group Pna21; however these offered no real improvement in the refinement residuals and gave no indication for the absence of an inversion centre. One feature that was present in refinements in both space groups was the presence of some relatively strong regions of positive and negative electron densities at distances unreasonably close to the iodine positions (Fig. 10). The I(1) apical position had disc shaped atomic displacement ellipsoids with regions of negative and positive electron densities close to the refined positions (<1 Å). The I(2) equatorial site also has a strong region of positive electron density at locations close to its position. Similar features in the difference Fourier maps were noted by Mashiyama et al.10 in the high temperature single crystal X-ray diffraction study of the cubic forms of MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I). One explanation for these features could be that the motion of the anion positions is better described using an anharmonic displacement model as successfully applied to the cubic systems of CsPbX3 (X = Cl and Br).58 Single crystal neutron diffraction experiments are now planned to investigate the latter possibility in more detail. Alternative attempts have been made to quantify the disorder observed in a range of organic–inorganic perovskites using X-ray pair distribution functions.59 This work found that the local structures of such materials showed angular distortions of the octahedra, such that the halides have a significant transverse displacement from the midpoint of the B–B distance to which they are constrained in the ideal crystallographic description. These displacements are likely to be dynamic in nature, due in part to the presence of soft transverse acoustic phonons in these structures.

 Fig. 10  3D difference Fourier maps showing the regions of positive (yellow) and negative (blue) electron densities (regions indicated > ±5 electrons) when viewed along the a, b and c directions of the orthorhombic structure of MAPbI3 respectively. 
As noted by Swainson et al.32 in their structural analysis of MAPbBr3, there is no group–subgroup relationship between I4/mcm and Pnma, so it is impossible to descend continuously through this sequence. It is therefore likely that a transient intermediary phase for both the bromide and iodide analogues exists, but this is yet to be experimentally observed. Poglitsch and Weber suggested a second tetragonal phase for the bromide with P4/mmm symmetry;33 however this is not one of the space groups that can be generated from pure tilt transitions.6 To further investigate this we monitored the variation in lattice parameters as a function of temperature using single crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. 11 and Table 8). The absolute temperatures shown in this study should be treated with caution as the temperature recorded is the temperature of the sensor positioned on the nitrogen nozzle rather than the crystal itself. Nevertheless, we observed a clear discontinuity and a change in lattice parameters consistent with the reported orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition close to 161 K.33,38 We investigated the suggested space groups from indexing the diffraction data close to transition region. The data collected at 152 K suggested the space group Ibam, however this space group is inconsistent with the reported perovskite symmetries and further experiments will be required to explain this feature.

Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the perovskite is remarkably stable under the 200 keV electron beam. Samples containing heavy elements such as Pb and I are often found to decompose during electron beam irradiation because of the energy deposited during electron beam absorption. It is suggested that the presence of the methylammonium ion that contains relatively lighter elements helps dissipate the electron energy. High-resolution TEM images revealed a well ordered crystal, but the diffracted intensities of the selected area electron diffraction patterns and fast Fourier transform reconstructions were inconsistent with both the room temperature I4/mcm and high temperature Pmm phases as determined by powder X-ray diffraction. Extensive pattern simulation as a function of crystal thickness and beam convergence was unable to replicate the observed patterns (Fig. 12). Other symmetries such as Pnm offered slightly better but not fully convincing matches. It seems probable that Pmm represents an average structure that satisfactorily accounts for intensity in the X-ray diffraction patterns. However at the micron scale, local symmetry and/or occupancy vary and some SAD patterns suggest higher dimensional order. The electron-energy loss spectrum (EELS) shows clear K-edge for I atoms, while N K-edge is very weak (Fig. 13). The background-subtracted EELS spectrum shows a clear N edge onset at 403 eV thus confirming the presence of the (CH3NH3)+ units (inset Fig. 13).
 Fig. 12  A high resolution phase contrast image [201]t ≡ [111]c of MAPbI3 shows translational order. The SAD pattern and inverse FFT of the image yield similar periodicities that while metrically consistent with cubic or tetragonal cells, show intensities that disagree with 2-beam and multi-beam diffraction simulation in both I4/mcm and Pmm. In particular, for the RT I4/mcm phase the {13}/{20} reflections are intense but computation shows the most intense reflection to be {040}/{24}. The origin of the differences is not due to crystal thickness or beam divergence effects and requires further investigation.

Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra were used to calculate the optical absorption coefficient (α) according to the Kubelka–Munk equation,60F(R) = α = (1 − R)2/(2R), where R is the reflectance (%) (Fig. 14). Eg for the MAPbI3 powder is determined to be 1.51 eV from the extrapolation of the linear part of the transformed Kubelka–Munk spectrum and the calculated band-gap is in good agreement with Kim et al.2

The experimentally observed band gap was compared with electronic band structure calculations derived from CASTEP,50 including speculative calculations for the band-gaps of the cubic and orthorhombic polymorphs of MAPbI3. The electronic band structure along the high-symmetry k lines§ and the projected density of states shows that the cubic phase has a well-defined direct band gap of 1.3 eV at the R (1/2,1/2,1/2) point (Fig. 15(a)). The cubic structure transforms into a tetragonal (I4/mcm) phase with the tilting of the PbI6 octahedron around the c axis, when temperature decreases, which moves the band to the Γ(0,0,0) due to the lowering of the lattice symmetry from P to I (Fig. 15(b)), and the band gap energy increases to 1.43 eV. This agrees with Borriello et al.55 and Chabot et al.52 who found that the band gap becomes larger when the symmetry decreases and the tilting of octahedral network increases. The calculated band gap energy of the tetragonal phase is slightly smaller than the experimental band gap 1.51 eV due to the underestimation with the DFT using GGA calculation. The projected densities of states (PDOSs) of cubic and tetragonal phases show similarities (Fig. 16(a) and (b)). Both of the top valence bands mainly consist of p-orbitals of I with an overlapping of Pb 6p and 6s orbitals, while the bottom of the conduction band formed by the Pb 6p–I 5s σ-antibonding and Pb 6p–I 5p π-antibonding.61 These similarities lead Umebayashi and Asai61 to get a much smaller calculated band gap value (cubic data) than the experimental one (tetragonal data) without noting the phase difference.

As the dynamical disorder of methylammonium (MA) is removed in the orthorhombic (Pnma) phase, CH3NH3+ can be considered in the calculation to show a direct band gap (Eg = 1.61 eV) at the Γ(0,0,0) (Fig. 15(c)). The band gap energy increases after the transition to lower symmetry with further PbI6 octahedral tilting along the c axis (Fig. 15). To evaluate the calculation in the cubic and tetragonal phases without inclusion of the MA cation radical, the same method was used for the orthorhombic structure with and without the MA cation (Fig. 17). The differences between the two different calculations are small, with a slightly lower band gap energy (1.57 eV) when MA is absent, perhaps due to smaller octahedral deformation. The PDOS (Fig. 16(c)) of the orthorhombic phase shows that the bands due to the MA cation are situated in the middle of the valence band and lower energy region, and does not affect the band gap region. Elsewhere ab initio investigations of the low temperature triclinic phase of MASnI3 found that the organic cation only contributes to bands that are far from the band-gap.55 In summary, computation shows that the organic part contributed exclusively to the electronic properties of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites, but the band-gap energy is dominated by the inorganic component of these perovskite structures.

5 Conclusions
In this work, the perovskite MAPbI3 was successfully synthesised in both poly- and single-crystalline forms. Powder X-ray diffraction and DSC have confirmed the cubic to tetragonal phase transition at approximately 57 °C, and TGA has shown that the material is stable up to around 300 °C in an argon atmosphere. The low temperature orthorhombic structure has been solved for the first time in the space group Pnma and unusual features in the Fourier maps are suggestive of anharmonic displacements of the anions that require further investigation. Similarly, the mismatch between the calculated and observed intensities in the selected area electron diffraction patterns is suggestive of localised symmetry differences in the room temperature tetragonal I4/mcm phase. Analysis of the known perovskite space group symmetries has revealed that there must be a transient phase between the tetragonal I4/mcm and orthorhombic Pnma analogues but the apparent Ibam symmetry close to the transition temperature is inconsistent with the space group hierarchy, as is the observed I4/m for the tetragonal phase. It is evident that a combination of temperature dependent neuron diffraction, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MASNMR) experiments is required to resolve the anomalies found in the literature and the present investigation. UV-Visible spectroscopy has revealed a band-gap of 1.51 eV that is in good agreement with values obtained from DFT calculations and additionally shows that the band-gap becomes larger as the symmetry is lowered. Furthermore, the band gap is relatively insensitive to the organic component of the structure. Although we have gathered structural information from the MAPbI3 perovskite using a range of different techniques, inconsistencies in symmetry, and the likely disorder present in this and related materials, must be understood to properly design and optimise devices.

 	Fig. 2  Pawley fit of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of MAPbI3 confirming a single-phase sample with tetragonal symmetry at room temperature.	 

 	Fig. 3  Calculated powder X-ray diffraction reflection positions for MAPbI3 in both cubic and tetragonal symmetries respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Two and three dimensional plots of the variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction patterns for MAPbI3. Both plots show the gradual disappearance of the tetragonal super-lattice reflections.	 

 	Fig. 5  Expanded areas of the two and three dimension powder X-ray diffraction patterns, which show the gradual disappearance of the 211 reflection associated with the tetragonal supercell.	 

 	Fig. 6  Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) plot of the tetragonal → cubic transition.	 

 	Fig. 7  DSC plot for MAPbI3 showing the tetragonal to cubic transition and a feature close to 100 °C in the heating curve, which is absent in the cooling curve. It is suggested that the latter feature indicates that a small amount of absorbed H2O was present in the sample.

 	Fig. 12  A high resolution phase contrast image [201]t ≡ [111]c of MAPbI3 shows translational order. The SAD pattern and inverse FFT of the image yield similar periodicities that while metrically consistent with cubic or tetragonal cells, show intensities that disagree with 2-beam and multi-beam diffraction simulation in both I4/mcm and Pmm. In particular, for the RT I4/mcm phase the {13}/{20} reflections are intense but computation shows the most intense reflection to be {040}/{24}. The origin of the differences is not due to crystal thickness or beam divergence effects and requires further investigation.
