Broader context
Wearable devices are shaping the future and the advances and breakthroughs of associated power generation mechanisms will inspire a wide range of research ideas in the wider scientific community covering chemical, physical, and soft microelectronic science.

1. Introduction
1.1. Research motivation
To date, the battery has been a standard powering solution for wearable devices, which cannot meet the increasing demand for future wearable technology that requires a lightweight, conformal and seamless energy solution. In particular, the current battery is rigid and bulky, which is not ideal for applications in scenarios like outdoor activities, harsh industrial scenarios and armed forces. The current battery itself also causes environmental pollution problems. It is encouraging that the past decade has witnessed significant progress in clean and renewable power technologies, enabling potential better wearable powering solutions. As an example, Fig. 1 illustrates different wearable powering solutions for biomedical scenarios. Thync envisages a head-mounted engineering concept powered by solar cells, and it uses ultrasonic waves to stimulate the Somatosensory Cortex.1 By analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) data, emotions can be controlled. Google Glass Enterprise Edition 22 is a wearable device that is equipped with an 820 mA h battery and operates on the Android Oreo OS.

It provides intuitive, voice-activated assistance for hands-on workers and professionals, and its comfortable, lightweight shape is designed for all-day wear. Besides solar cells and batteries, piezoelectric effects can be utilized to convert acoustic energy into electricity for retinal stimulation.3 Energy from radiofrequency electromagnetic fields can also be harvested and integrated with wearable devices such as printable antennas and rectennas. In addition to near-field inductive coupling and far-field radiation transmission, surface waves based on surface plasmon resonance can also be used to propagate RF energy along with metamaterial smart fabrics.4 Furthermore, thermoelectrically-powered watches that use the difference between human body temperature and ambient temperature are also reported, and triboelectric nanogenerators have been widely studied in the form of stretchable devices for self-powered insoles or in the form of flexible fabrics such as gloves or clothes.5,6 Even conventional power generation approaches like electromagnetic techniques can also be used for specific wearable devices which require a high amount of deliverable power and current. Ankle assist braces or dynamic hand supports for essential tremor reduction can be realized by electromagnetic approaches and suitable feedback control of the damping.
Wearable devices are shaping the future,7–9 and the advances and breakthroughs of associated power generation technologies will bridge the gap between state-of-the-art science research to real-world applications in this emerging field. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the current cutting-edge power generation methodologies and discuss their potential applications and rewarding perspectives.
1.2. The state of the art
There are various approaches to generate power out of ambient sources: chemical power sources,10 thermal radiation or thermal transfer power sources,11,12 vibration- or force-based power sources,13,14 and electromagnetic wave power sources.15 Based on the energy conversion mechanisms, in the context of wearable energy applications, this article categorizes them into electromagnetic field (including near-field and far-field) wireless power transfer; thermoelectric, photoelectric, and chemical energy into electricity; and kinetic energy conversion. Kinetic energy conversion includes four main mechanisms: electrostatic generator,16 electromagnetic induction,17,18 piezoelectric harvester,19 and triboelectric nanogenerator.20
1.3. Scope of the paper
The scope of this article is to give comprehensive coverage of wearable power generation science and technology. It starts with a discussion of the figures of merit of different power generation mechanisms which are herein defined in the context of wearable devices, followed by the underlying physics of various wearable energy conversion mechanisms, and summarization of their pros and cons of the state-of-the-art methodologies. Through a survey of the power consumption of wearable systems, and materials and processes of existing wearable device sensors, future research outlooks are highlighted. An all-in-one-printable wearable system, including printed transistors, printed diodes, various printed sensors, printed power sources, and printed energy storage cells, may be achieved and integrated in the near future. Besides, self-powered and self-responsive flexible devices may offer a promising low-power self-contained system. With the development of flexible packaging technology, flexible thin-film and fiber electronics will also draw a firm stroke in the future System in a Package (SiP) roadmap. Furthermore, IoT-enabled wearable devices will also play a crucial role in future full life cycle monitoring scenarios regardless of smart homes or green factories (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  IoT-enabled self-contained system towards full lifecycle health monitoring. The wearable systems are equipped with flexible Systems on a Chip (F-SoC) in the form of a flexible System in a Package (F-SiP). Based on different application scenarios, the system can be powered using a green and sustainable wearable power source to enable a paradigm shift in the digital world. 
As shown in Fig. 3, the specific scope of this review is organized as follows. In Section 2, for the first time, a figure of merit of power generation for wearable systems is defined to gauge the performances of reported technologies. Section 3 describes the physics of various energy conversion mechanisms and reviews the latest progress and discusses the pros and cons of various energy generation technologies. Section 4 presents the general requirements and power consumption of flexible and wearable systems. A survey of wearable sensors and energy storage devices, including their material platforms, fabrication processes, and crucial parameters, is presented. Measurement methods in the community to evaluate the flexibility and stretchability of the devices are also introduced. Diverse application scenarios such as healthcare, military defense applications and consumer electronics for wearable and flexible sensors are exemplified. The system architecture of wearable devices is discussed, along with our viewpoints on conclusions, challenges, and future perspectives.
 Fig. 3  The scope and classification of this review. 
In this review paper, wearable systems are classified into three categories, namely micro 3D rigid systems based on silicon wafer, micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) processes and 3D printing methods, flexible systems based on 2D planar printing processes and thin-film devices, and fiber and textile electronic systems based on 1D fibers. Fibers are threads or filaments that form plant tissue, minerals or textiles. Fibers naturally exist in plants and animals. Cotton, silk, and wool are natural fibers, whereas regenerated fibers and synthetic fibers are man-made fibers. Textiles, as interlocking fiber networks, are classified as one of the fiber and textile electronic systems. Fiber and textile electronics include freestanding fibers, woven fabrics or textiles (e.g., interlocking fiber networks by weaving, knitting or braiding), and non-woven fabrics. Based on energy sources, energy conversion mechanisms are classified into five categories, namely electromagnetic field energy conversion, solar radiant energy conversion, thermal energy conversion, chemical energy conversion, and kinetic energy conversion.
2. The figures of merit of wearable power generation systems
The figure of merit zEG of each energy generator is a well-defined criterion for evaluating device performance and is also known as the figure of merit of devices. Eqn (2)–(18) are from the published references and describe the efficiency η and figures of merit zEG of different energy generation devices governed by the chosen energy conversion mechanism and the specific design of the energy generator. However, the evaluation index covers different energy conversion mechanisms, and flexible systems are necessary to be standardized;21,22 therefore, this paper defines a figure of merit of systems and thus introduces items that reflect the ductility and bendability of the system. For the figure of merit of materials, there are lots of insightful papers that had discussed this issue.23–25 This paper focuses mainly on the evaluation criterion at the system level.
2.1. The figures of merit of wearable electronics power generation considering flexibility and stretchability factors
In this paper, we define a figure of merit for judging the performance of the power generation source for flexible, wearable systems. FoMW = η(zEG)·(1 + εt)·(1 + εf)·(1 − Pr)(1)where FoMW indicates the figure of merit of flexible, wearable power generation systems; η(zEG) is the efficiency of the chosen energy conversion mechanism for powering wearable devices, which is a function of the figure of merit zEG of the specific energy generator; εt is the maximum elongation rate (tensile strain) of the device, indicating its stretchability (i.e., ductility); and εf is the maximum flexural strain (allowable curvature) of the device, indicating its flexibility (i.e., bendability). The defined figure of merit of systems also considers the power loss when the system is subjected to tensile and bending loads. Here Pr indicates the performance reduction rate of the device when it is subjected to the maximum external tensile and bending loads, and 1 − Pr indicates the power retention rate of the system.
The FoMW is a dimensionless factor, which comprehensively considers the energy conversion efficiency, figure of merit of the specific power generator, system ductility and bendability, and power reduction of wearable devices under bending and stretching conditions. The eight power generation mechanisms discussed in this paper include: (1) electromagnetic field (EF) power transfer, subdivided into two categories – near field (NF) and radiofrequency (RF) far-field power transfer; (2) photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion; (3) thermoelectric generator (TEG); (4) fuel cell (FC) electrochemical energy conversion; 5) kinetic energy conversion, subdivided into three categories – electrostatic (ES) energy harvester (including pre-charged electret generator and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)), electromagnetic-induction (EM) energy harvester and piezoelectric (PE) energy harvester.
The expressions of efficiency and figure of merit of each power generator are governed by the corresponding energy conversion mechanism, and the specific design and implementation of the energy generator. The figures of merit of various power generators are provided as a theoretical basis as follows.

The figure of merit – electromagnetic field energy conversion. 
For electromagnetic wave energy harvesting, the main evaluation index is the efficiency (2)where Pout is the useful output power and Pin is the input power.
For far-field wireless power transfer (i.e., RF energy harvesting), the efficiency can be further expressed as (3)where εT is the overall efficiency of the antenna, ML(0 < ML < 1) is the mismatch loss of the antenna, and εC is the conversion efficiency of the circuit.
For near-field wireless power transfer, the figure of merit is26 (4) (5)where x is the distance between two resonant coils and d is the diameter of the resonant coil.


The figure of merit – photovoltaic energy conversion. 
The PV efficiency is (6)where Pmax is the output power, E is the radiation flux, and Acell is the solar cell area. The best research PV cell efficiencies can be found in ref. 27.
The Fill Factor (FF) is mainly used as a ‘figure of merit’ for solar cells (7)where Pmax is the actual maximum obtainable power, VOC is the open circuit voltage, and ISC is the short circuit current.


The figure of merit – thermoelectric generator energy conversion. 
The figure of merit of a TEG is24 (8)where σ is the electrical conductivity, k is the thermal conductivity, S is the Seebeck coefficient, and T is the absolute temperature.
The compatibility factor is another important property for the thermoelectric device. The maximum efficiency could be reduced in the case of segmentation if the compatibility factor differs by two or more.28 (9)where s is the compatibility factor,29S is the Seebeck coefficient, and T is the absolute temperature.
The efficiency of the TEG is29 (10)where , Th is the absolute temperature of the hot side, and Tc is the absolute temperature of the cold side.


The figure of merit – fuel cell chemical energy conversion. 
The fuel-cell efficiency is given by30 (11)where Vc is the actual cell voltage, and the denominator has a value of 1.48 V and 1.35 V based on the higher heating value (HHV) and the lower heating value (LHV), respectively.
The fuel utilization coefficient is usually used as a ‘figure of merit’ for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), (12)where ic is the crossover current and i is the useful output current.


The figure of merit – mechanical vibration-based energy conversion (ES, EM, PE). 
The volume figure of merit of mechanical vibration-based energy conversion (ES, EM, PE) can be described as31 (13)where Pout is the output power, Y0 is the excitation amplitude, ρAu is the density of gold, Vol is the generator volume, and ω is the excitation angular frequency.
Effectiveness is defined as the useful power output divided by the maximum possible power output; it measures how close a particular design is to its ideal performance.32 (14)where Pout is the output power, Y0 is the excitation amplitude, Zl is the maximum response amplitude, m is the proof mass, and ω is the excitation angular frequency. The efficiency of mechanical vibration-based energy conversion (ES, EM, PE) can be described as (15)


The figure of merit of triboelectric nanogenerators. 
For a triboelectric nanogenerator, the efficiency is25 (16)where Em is the maximum possible output energy per cycle (17)where QSC,max is the maximum short-circuit transfer charge, VOC,max is the maximum open-circuit voltage, and  is the maximum achievable absolute voltage at Q = QSC,max.
The performance figure of merit of the TENG is25,33 (18)where FoMS is the structural figure of merit, σ is the surface charge density, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, A is the triboelectrification area, and xmax is the maximum displacement.

Fig. 4 indicates the figures of merit (FoMw) of eight types of power generation methods for wearable systems, and detailed specifications can be found in Table 1. The purpose of Table 1 and Fig. 4 is not to compare the absolute magnitudes of the figures of merits of the different power generation methods, because the figure of merit of each energy conversion mechanism is derived in a different way as shown in eqn (2)–(18). The information provided in Fig. 4 and Table 1 includes (1) the approximate ranges of the figures of merit and volumes of the different energy conversion mechanisms in wearable system application scenarios; (2) the internal comparison of specific energy conversion mechanisms, as shown in Fig. 4; each energy conversion mechanism has its specific distribution area (colored, shaded area); and (3) it serves as a power source quick-selection guide for the design of flexible wearable systems. By comparing the volume requirements, power consumption, voltage and current profiles, and expected conversion efficiency, the wearable engineering community can quickly select the right power generation system.

It can be seen that due to the essential difference in the energy conversion mechanism, different types of energy generation methods are concentrated in specific areas. A piezoelectric device has the smallest volume and can be made into ultra-small power sources using MEMS technology, or flexible thin-film devices can be made using polymer piezoelectric materials (e.g., polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)). However, the output power and current of piezoelectric power generation are relatively small. The electromagnetic energy harvesting devices and triboelectric nano-generators are large in size. The EM device is suitable for application scenarios that require higher power, such as smart backpacks, self-powered bracelets or field investigations by special forces, and can provide hundreds of mW of power supply. In contrast, the TENG can make full use of the characteristics of organic materials to make smart wearable clothing such as power-generating clothing, and self-powered insoles and gloves. The electromagnetic field near-field wireless power supply coil can be made by spray printing or inkjet printing. It has good flexibility, low cost, and high transmission power, but the wage distance is limited. The energy transmission distance of RF far-field energy collection can reach thousands of kilometers, and the RF antenna and rectifier circuit can be integrated as an RF rectenna, but the output power is low. Electrostatic power generation is the earliest energy collection method, which mainly relies on the charge storage characteristics of electrets. Electrostatic power generation can be compatible with MEMS and Integrated Circuit (IC) processes, the output voltage is high, but the internal impedance of the system is large, so the output current is small. Thermoelectric power generation requires a high temperature gradient at both ends of the device. When the temperature difference is as high as 105 K, the flexible TEG can produce a power density of 100 mW cm−2. However, the thermoelectric power generation method has low efficiency and massive power loss. It usually requires hundreds of p–n junctions to form a flexible device to provide power output at the level of several milliwatts, and the as-prepared device has a sizeable planar size. Photovoltaic energy conversion and electrochemical fuel cells can produce higher power in a smaller volume, and the FoMw is good, which is suitable for power supply of micro flexible wearable devices. However, photovoltaic devices depend on weather conditions, and fuel cells require a continuous supply of fuel. Generally speaking, the power supply methods of wearable systems are diverse, and the corresponding power supply methods need to be selected in combination with actual use requirements and power trade-offs. The physics of energy conversion and its development in the field of wearable systems are reviewed in detail as follows.

3. Physics of energy conversion for wearable systems
3.1. Electromagnetic field power transfer for wearable systems
Electromagnetic wave energy harvesting is the alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) energy conversion, and there is no need for wires as physical links for electrical energy transmission. Electromagnetic waves are generated by a time-varying electromagnetic field driven by a power source, and transmit power to receiver devices across space (usually an inductive coil in regard to near-field transmission or a receiver antenna in regard to far-field transmission); whereafter the receiver device extracts power from the field and provides it to the electrical load.
Wireless power transfer can be an instrumental approach to supply power to wearable electronics. Wireless power transmission technology can eliminate batteries, cables and associated adaptors, thereby improving the mobility and safety of electronic devices, and the above benefits are essential for the application scenarios of wearable devices.
Electromagnetic wave energy conversion mainly includes near-field and far-field power transfer.

3.1.1. Near-field electromagnetic wave power transfer. 
For near-field power transfer, the electromagnetic field is not radioactive; this means that the electric field and the magnetic field are not coupled; power can thus be transferred through a capacitively coupled (electrostatically induced) electric field or an inductively coupled (electromagnetically induced) magnetic field.
The transmission range in the near-field region can be defined as a short-range or middle range. The transmission distance of short distances is usually at most about one antenna diameter; that is, the gap between the transmitter and the receiver is equal to or less than one antenna diameter. This is the range in which conventional non-resonant capacitive or inductive coupling can transmit useful power. The capacitive coupling has two typical approaches, i.e., transverse design and longitudinal design. The first application scenario for capacitive coupling is wireless charging for electric vehicles. On the other hand, inductive coupling is a promising technique for wearable electronics; for example, potential application scenarios include transdermal charging of implanted biomedical prosthetic devices, e.g., insulin pumps, drug-delivery capsules, and pacemakers, to remove wires that need to pass through skin.34
For the mid-range, the transmission distance can be as long as ten antenna diameters: Drange ≤ 10Dantenna. This is the region in which resonant capacitive or inductive coupling can transmit useful power, which was first reported by Nikola Tesla.35 In 2007, MIT researchers36 used coupled-mode theory37 to calculate the resonance frequency. Two coupled tuned circuits were used, with each circuit made of a 25 cm self-resonant coil at a frequency of 10 MHz to transmit 40% power over a distance of eight coil diameters (around 2 m). An interesting phenomenon of resonant coupling is that when two resonant circuits are tightly coupled, at a close distance, the resonant frequency divides into two resonance ridges.


3.1.2. Far-field electromagnetic wave power transfer. 
Beyond about one antenna wavelength (λ), the power transfer belongs to far-field, namely radioactive area, where electric fields are perpendicular to magnetic fields, propagating in the form of electromagnetic waves.38
To radiate power effectively, the dimension of an antenna, as an electromagnetic wave, should be comparable to its wavelength scale, and the wavelength is related to the target frequency. An antenna with the size Dantenna ≈ λ (i.e., a monopole or dipole antenna) can effectively radiate electromagnetic waves in all directions, i.e., omnidirectional antennas. By reflection or refraction of the electromagnetic wave into beams, we can envisage a high-gain antenna in a specific direction to use it for long-range power transmission.39 Besides conventional near-field and far-field energy conversion, electromagnetic power can also be transferred wirelessly based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which was recently reported.4,40


3.1.3. The state-of-the-art of electromagnetic wave energy conversion based on flexible platforms. 
Near-field inductive coupling. 
Flexible inductive coils made on a stretchable and flexible platform are critical components for near-field wireless power transfer. Wireless charging coils can be fabricated by inkjet-printing41 or negative adhesive transfer printing technology to be flexible, stretchable, and transparent.42 Carta et al.43 designed a device that is composed of an array of rigid islands with electrical functions (i.e., modular electronics), and these islands were physically linked with several flexible meander interconnections fabricated by neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd-YAG) laser cutting. A wireless battery charger was presented, which could deliver a power of up to 200 mW, and the effective power transfer distance could reach around 10 cm. Teng et al.44 proposed a fabrication method of liquid metal (LM)-based micro- and macro-patterns of wireless charging coils. Sondhi et al.45 reported multilayer flexible coils made by the screen-printing process. The conductive silver ink-based flat circular-spiral coils had a printing resolution of 250 μm, good enough to make the number of turns 20. A wireless power transmission of 1 mW was achieved, and the effective power transfer distance could reach 4 cm.
Tetsu et al.46 reported a graphene/Au coil by the inkjet-printing process. The as-prepared coil had a resistivity of 4.30 × 10−5 Ω cm−1 and was printed onto a nanosheet substrate. The device functionalized as an inductive coil and illuminated a LED under an ultra-flexible configuration and showed good waterproof performance, which could be used for wireless power supply of smart gastrointestinal capsules.
Wireless power transfer can also be used for power generation for biomedical sensing and diagnosis such as smart contact lens and gastrointestinal endoscopy.47 Takamatsu reported wireless power supply circuits on wet, soft contact lenses by using the electrochemical (EC) printing method (Fig. 5a).48 A high power transfer efficiency of 50% was achieved from the eyeglass transmitter to the printed receiver lenses. Dubey et al.49 proposed the idea of a gastric stimulator powered by wireless power transmission. It was found that, when the coil was put 4 cm away from the power source, the power transmission efficiency could reach 14% with a maximum power of 300 mW for 15 turns of the coil (Fig. 5b). An LC circuit was adjusted to be resonant at 1.3 MHz in compliance with the IEEE standard50 for safety levels concerning human exposure to electromagnetic fields.

Far-field RF energy harvesting. 
Radiofrequency, as a high frequency alternating electromagnetic wave, covers a wide frequency band, ranging from 300 kHz to 300 GHz. Radiofrequency (300 kHz to 300 GHz) is a higher frequency band than the general definition of high frequency (greater than 10 kHz), and the microwave frequency band (300 MHz to 300 GHz) indicates a higher frequency band than radiofrequency. The use of RF energy (GSM 900 MHz,51 WiFi15) to power low-power sensors (0.1 μW cm−2) and to build autonomous wireless sensor networks has attracted lots of research interest in recent years worldwide. The working principle of the RF energy collection system is shown in Fig. 6a. Lehtimäki et al.52 presented a supercapacitor and an RF energy harvester that could be manufactured on plastic substrates and are compatible with large-scale processing processes. An off-the-shelf radio frequency identification device (RFID) card reader was employed to induce an AC voltage in the printed antenna at the RF energy collection end. Besides the printed loop antenna, there was also a half-wave diode rectifier made from organic materials, which supplied power to the supercapacitor through inductive coupling. The supercapacitor could drive an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) linear regulator.

When the distance between the RF card reader and the RF energy collection terminal changed from 5.5 cm to 6 cm, the RF-induced voltage (open-circuit peak-to-peak value) ranged from 20 V to 15 V. For a 0.45 F supercapacitor, and an equivalent series resistance (ESR) of 2.8 Ω, the charging time of a capacitor powered by RF energy was 22 min (distance 5.5 cm) and 2 h 21 min (distance 6 cm). The working time of the supercapacitor driving ASIC circuit was 7 h 51 min (distance 5.5 cm fast charge) and 10 h 39 min (distance 6 cm slow charge). Before the supercapacitor voltage dropped to 0.78 V, the output voltage of the ASIC linear regulator could be kept constant at 1.2 V, and the deliverable current and power were 1.2 μA and 1.44 μW, respectively.
The American company AXZON53 developed silicon-based integrated circuit chips Magnus® S and Xerxes™ IC and RFM2121 maintenance-free and batteryless passive sensors. As shown in Fig. 6b, the Axzon RFM2121 is a dual-mode RFID sensor tag capable of measuring temperature and moisture. It harvests power from the carrier sent by the reader, demodulates and decodes the incoming command, and responds by “backscattering” (i.e., modulating the tag antenna impedance while the antenna provides an unmodulated carrier). Applications include leak detection and diapers. Axzon has also developed sensors which can monitor temperature and fill level of vials for vaccines and other pharmaceuticals and body tags which can monitor core body temperature. The RFM2121 integrates an RF antenna and can communicate with card readers that comply with the Radio Frequency Identification Union/Ultra High Frequency (RAIN/UHF) standard. The RFM2121 wireless sensor module is compatible with EPC Class 1 gen 2 v2.0.1 and ISO 18000-6C standards. The film device has a tag identification number (TID) storage capacity of 64 bits, an electronic product code (EPC) storage capacity of 160 bits, and a user storage capacity of 144 bits.
Recently, Zhang et al.15 presented a high cut-off frequency (up to 10 GHz) solution. The rectenna was constructed using a printed antenna and a heterojunction utilizing a MoS2 (MoS2 is a kind of transition-metal dichalcogenide54–58) semiconducting–metallic-phase (Fig. 6c). Both the antenna and MoS2 rectenna were formed with electron-beam lithography (EBL) on a flexible Kapton substrate (Fig. 6d).
Antennas and rectennas. 
Like an induction coil in near-field power transmission, an antenna59 or a rectenna plays a vital role in far-field transmission, and the coil can be viewed as a particular type of antenna (i.e., has the shape of a spiral antenna). A rectenna is generally defined as a rectifying antenna, that is, a receiving antenna comprised of an antenna and a rectifier that is used for converting electromagnetic energy into DC electricity.
Conductive lines to form an antenna could be conductive tapes,60 screen-printing nanowires,61 inkjet-printing structures,62,63 liquid metal alloys,64,65 and conductive threads (aka conductive textiles).66–68 Antennas’ shapes include dipole antennas, arrays and reflectors; Yagi-Uda arrays; and spiral69 and series-fed patch antenna arrays70 for 5G applications (above 24 GHz millimeter waves).
i. Screen-printed nanowires. 
A microstrip patch antenna was screen-printed with silver nanowires and encapsulated into an elastomeric substrate. The as-fabricated patch antenna had an operating frequency of 3 GHz.61 The elastomeric substrate would stretch or bend under the action of external force, thereby changing the shape of the antenna embedded in it, and thus the operating frequency would shift. By calibrating the relationship between strain and working frequency, the flexible antenna could also be used as a strain sensor.
ii. Inkjet-printed structures. 
Patch antenna arrays could also be inkjet-printed with silver nanoparticle inks.62 A Dimatix DMP-2831 inkjet printer was employed to print a rectenna on a flexible liquid crystal polymer substrate with a thickness of 0.18 mm. The rectifying element included a Schottky barrier diode, and a distributed L-network for input resistance matching. The gallium arsenide diode has a low series resistance and a high cut-off frequency and could be used in high-frequency application scenarios, such as 5G millimeter wave scenarios.
iii. Microfluidic liquid metal alloys. 
Based on multilayer microfluidic65 stretchable radiofrequency electronics, Cheng et al.64,71,72 proposed a strain sensor with a microfluidic antenna as the active elements, whose operating frequency was designed at 1.5 GHz. The antenna served two purposes, both as a reversible strain sensor and for transmitting and receiving radiofrequency signals. There are two system configurations for an antenna-based wireless energy-autonomous system: (1) RF energy supply using a remote standalone RF power source, usually in the form of a horn antenna; and (2) self-contained power supply on the device side using an integrated auxiliary power source (e.g., solar cells) or using batteries.
iv. Conductive textiles. 
Antennas can also be fabricated with conductive textiles.66 Embroidery conductive threads (textiles), e.g., Elektrisola-7 filaments (Cu/Ag50 amalgam), were twisted into strands on textile substrates.67 The integration module of textile antennas and rectifiers operated at 2.45 GHz and the efficiency of power conversion from RF electromagnetic waves to direct current output could reach 70% at an input power of 8 dBm. A single element array produced by the integration of the antenna and the rectifier was realized on a shirt for power transmission applications. The measured results showed that 600 μW power could be harvested from the module array of antennas and rectifiers, which can provide sufficient power to sensors for use in wearable systems.
v. RF combining and DC combining networks. 
Antenna arrays and mm-wave RF energy harvesters in the 28 GHz band were proposed for potential application in 5G bands (above 24 GHz).70 This patch antenna array was inkjet-printed on a copper-clad liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrate. The Rotman lens was also used to form a combining network.70,73 The total response of all Rotman channels can cover a larger angular space. Therefore, if the rectified units of each port are combined, using the Rotman lens as an intermediate component between the radio antenna and the rectifier, regardless of the source position, can help maintain a stable output.
vi. Self-contained systems. 
RF antennas can also be combined with other power sources and sensors to form an energy-autonomous, self-contained system for potential application in wearable electronics. For example, Hester et al.74 proposed a high-frequency band RFID sensor. The whole system was comprised of a transistor switch for backscattering modulation, dually-polarized linear antenna arrays, an oscillator circuit, a solar cell, and an ammonia sensor.
The power consumption of RFID tags ranges from 10 μW to 100 μW. The antenna of the RFID tag can be designed to have two functions. The antenna could harvest RF energy, communicate with the RFID reader at the same time, and collect solar energy as an auxiliary power source.75 Thanks to the development of commercial thin-film, amorphous solar cells with bus bars, photovoltaics can be printed onto flexible substrates to form a low cost and printable device architecture. Besides fully-printed solar cells,76 printable logic units such as transistors and digital circuits like ring oscillators,77 inverters, and NOT gates have been put forward.
vii. Design of antennas and rectennas. 
The radiation characteristics of an antenna are controlled by the telegrapher's equation (i.e., Friis transmission formula). Besides, there are many factors to consider when designing an antenna, such as (1) bandwidth; (2) gain; (3) effective area or aperture; (4) radiation pattern; (5) efficiency; (6) polarization; (7) impedance matching; and (8) S-parameter (mainly S11, i.e., the return loss or reflection coefficient of a transmission line).
The microstrip patch antenna is widely used in various applications because it is easy to design and manufacture, and it has become popular in wearable devices due to its low-profile conformal design. The cost is relatively low, and the bandwidth is very narrow. If feeding on the edge, the antenna impedance is higher than 50 Ω; if feeding at the center, the antenna impedance is lower than 50 Ω. The 50Ω microstrip line fed from the end extends into the patch antenna structure. The width of the notch area is chosen to be large enough to minimize the coupling between the antenna and the microstrip, but not so large that it will not significantly affect the characteristics of the antenna. The length L of the microstrip line is selected to minimize the reflected power S11.
An antenna array is an array of radiators or antenna elements. By appropriate design and arrangement of each unit of antenna arrays, it is possible to tune the radiation pattern to the desired direction with an ideal gain level. The array consists of a perfect electrical conductor (PEC) ground plane and a feed network. The feed network is evenly distributed by lumped port excitation below the ground plane, and a slot-coupled rectangular patch antenna is provided above the ground plane. A perfectly matched layer domain will cut off the free space area around the antenna.
The spiral slot antenna is also a good choice for carrying out a conformal design. Due to its wideband frequency response, it can be used in many application scenarios. The spiral slot antenna is made of an Archimedes spiral slot with two arms, and the spiral slot is patterned on a thin single-sided metal substrate using a parametric curve. Assuming that the conductivity is very high and the loss of the metal surface is negligible, the metal surface is modelled as an ideal electrical conductor. The lumped port is located in the center of the spiral groove to excite the antenna. The antenna structure and the air area are surrounded by a perfectly matched layer (PML).
In summary, the electromagnetic field energy conversion method can facilely realize wireless power transmission, in which near-field inductive coupling power transfer can output higher power at the milliwatt level and tens of milliamps of current, which can drive most commercial sensors; and far-field wireless transmission can collect radiofrequency waves, including 900 MHz/2.4 GHz WiFi signals, unlicensed Industrial Scientific Medical (ISM) radio bands, and future high-band 5G mm-wave (25–39 GHz) signals; therefore, electromagnetic field energy conversion can be compatible with IoT network communication systems to improve wireless energy supply for smart home sensor terminals. In addition, printed RF antennas can be produced in a mature and low-cost way, and combined with flexible electronic devices.

3.2. Photovoltaic energy conversion for wearable systems
In the previous section, we introduced the electromagnetic wave energy source that abounds in the Age of Information. Regarding environmental sources, solar radiant energy is another clean and abundant energy source for power generation of wearable systems. Photovoltaic energy generation can be integrated into diverse platforms for multiple application scenarios. Its energy conversion mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 7a. Recent progress regarding wearable photovoltaic power generation is summarized here, mainly focusing on solar cells compatible with flexible fabrication techniques and their application potential for wearable electronics.

3.2.1. Flexible and transparent electrodes. 
There has already been some literature that provides a detailed review of flexible and transparent electrodes in the field of photovoltaics; diverse electrode materials and their sheet resistances and transparencies can be found in the published literature.78 This article focuses mainly on the discussion of potential application scenarios of photovoltaics as power sources for wearable electronics.


3.2.2. Flexible solar cell categorization. 
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs). 
A PSC contains a compound of perovskite structure (most commonly based on a hybrid of organic–inorganic lead or tin halides) as a light-collecting active layer.79 The perovskite material family is compatible with various printing techniques, and thus can be produced at low cost.80 Besides their attractive cost, perovskite solar cells possess high absorption coefficients, which is conducive to the formation of ultra-thin films of about 500 nm, making lightweight and flexible solar modules possible, not only to make a power supply module for wearable electronics but also to absorb visible light in the full spectrum to enhance the efficiency.81
Park et al.82 developed an electron transport layer (ETL) of lithium-doped SnO2 prepared in solution at low temperature. The Li doped in SnO2 had enhanced conductivity and moved the conduction band of SnO2 downward. The power conversion efficiency of the as-prepared flexible solar cell was 14.78%. Fig. 7c shows the J–V curves of the perovskite solar cell, which can drive a portable fan under 1 sun conditions (a sun is usually defined as the nominal full sun intensity of a bright and sunny day on the earth, and its magnitude is 1000 W m−2).
Kim et al.83 reported a flexible perovskite solar cell with a TiOx layer as an electron collection layer deposited by the plasma-enhancing process. A mechanical bending test was conducted with a 1–10 mm radius of curvature. Yun et al.84 made a comprehensive review of integration approaches of diverse solar cells and other energy storage units such as a lithium-ion battery, a nanogenerator, a supercapacitor, a photo-electron synthetic cell, and an electrolytic cell. The development of integrated solar cell devices lies in improving the performance and overcoming the defects of a single functional module, thereby expanding its applicability in self-powered systems and portable/wearable electronic devices.
In 2014, a flexible fiber-shaped PSC was first fabricated by intertwining aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes onto a fiber core, adding photoactive perovskite materials between the two electrodes.85 Further research reported an improved power conversion efficiency of fiber PSCs, either by employing an electrochemical deposition technique86 or by replacing the TiO2 layer with obelisk-like zinc oxide (ZnO) arrays.87 Both freestanding 1D fibers and weaved 2D fabrics functioned well as perovskite solar cells and demonstrated good bendability.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). 
A DSSC is a kind of thin-film solar cell, and a photoelectrochemical system is formed on the semiconductor between the photosensitive anode and the electrolyte.88 Compared with traditional glass-based products, a DSSC has several attractive functions. It is compatible with traditional roll printing technology and supports flexible and transparent applications for wearable electronic devices. However, it still has some limitations, such as its dependence on platinum and ruthenium. In addition, liquid electrolytes pose severe challenges for the manufacture of batteries suitable for all-weather use.
In photovoltaic devices, electron–hole pairs are created by incident radiation generated in the active material, and then these electron–hole pairs are separated and transported to the electrode. Graphene can also play different roles in inorganic and organic solar cells. For example, graphene can be employed as transparent conductive electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells.89
Both planar and linear DSSCs have been reported.90 Li et al.91 proposed a two-dimensional planar comb structure on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, and manufactured dye-sensitized solar cells and supercapacitors (SCs). As shown in Fig. 7b, six independent flat DSSC modules were integrated on a PET film. The DSSC module showed good flexibility and could be wound on a pen with a diameter of 1 cm. Fu et al.92 integrated a DSSC and an energy storage unit (i.e., a SC) with an electrodeposited stainless steel wire. The steel wire was coated with polyaniline as an electrode for the fiber DSSC and fiber SC. A DSSC could also be made from freestanding fibers; for example, aligned carbon nanotube fibers can be used as catalytic counterelectrodes as well as conductive materials, and the as-prepared fiber solar cell could reach a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.94%.93 Higher PCE could be achieved with improved structure and material composition.21 In order to form a coaxial DSSC, the semiconductor layer, photosensitive material (i.e., dye) and counter electrode shell should be deposited on the fiber electrode in sequence and then injected into the oxidation reducing electrolyte.12,94
Two fabrication methods are widely used for forming a fiber-based textile DSSC, namely, layer stacking via printing technology and yarn intersection by a weaving or knitting process.95 Layer stacking is a straightforward way to build solar cells on textile substrates such as garments and cloths;96,97 whereas smart textiles made by yarn intersection offer a better experience of breathability and wearing comfortability.98 Since the N719 dye is widely used as a photoactive material in DSSCs, it could cause biocompatibility issues of SC-based textiles due to the possible leakage of toxic materials.95 Silicon-based solar cells, on the other hand, could be an alternative solution for wearing purposes due to their high biocompatibility. With the emergence of ultra-thin silicon films,99 use of thin-film silicon-based textile solar cells could be a feasible and promising approach in the future.
Organic solar cells (OSCs). 
An OSC is a photovoltaic cell using organic electronic products. Organic solar cells are sometimes referred to as polymer solar cells. Organic or polymer electronics has always been a popular research field for conductive organic polymers or small organic molecules. Organic electronics are prevalent in the field of solar cell research. They overcome inefficiencies and stability issues to shape future low-cost and flexible solar batteries.
Compared with silicon-based modules, organic solar cells are cost-effective, flexible, and lightweight, so they are suitable for self-powered wearable devices. However, polymer solar cells have low mechanical strength and low efficiency, and are unstable due to large amounts of photochemical degradation.
Based on organic photovoltaics and carbon nanotube/polymer-based supercapacitors, an ultra-thin optical charging device was manufactured with a total efficiency of 6% and a thickness of less than 50 μm.100 This device exhibits good flexibility and operational stability, providing a portable and long-term power source for wearable electronic devices.
Chen et al.5 presented a fabric solar cell in which smart fabrics were fabricated using lightweight polymer fibers. The single-layer fabric had a single layer thickness of 320 μm, which was compatible with the industrial shuttle flight process. The hybrid textile was tested with a 4 × 5 cm2 panel to quickly charge a capacitor under excitation with ambient solar radiation and mechanical pressure. Jinno et al.101 developed an ultra-flexible organic photovoltaic cell coated with elastomer on both sides. The washable and stretchable OSC can achieve both stretchability and stability in water. The efficiency of the double-sided coating device only decreased by 5.4% after being immersed in water for 120 minutes. A knittable polymer solar cell based on carbon nanotube fiber electrodes was also presented with a fill factor of 0.36 and a short-circuit current density of 0.98 mA cm−2.102 A higher power conversion efficiency could be achieved by growing TiO2 nanoparticles on the nanotubes.103
Kang et al.104 reviewed the development of printable, portable, and large-volume heterojunction organic solar cells that can be attached to curved surfaces, which indicates that the future of wearable electronic products is broad. Five core technologies that can bridge the gap between scientific research and actual use of OSCs are proposed.
Overall, the photoelectric energy conversion technology is relatively mature, with high power density and large output current. It can meet the power requirement of most sensors, and silicon solar cells or flexible organic solar cells can be chosen to adapt to different application scenarios of sensing systems. It is compatible with the cost-effective printing process and can be made on a textile substrate by fiber techniques, which is an excellent power source for wearable electronics. The challenges of solar cells are their dependence on light conditions. However, with the development of thin-film Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS) technology, a stable energy output could be achieved even under low lighting conditions owing to the good performance of CIGS in low light.105

3.3. Thermoelectric energy generation for wearable systems
Unlike the electromagnetic field and solar irradiance energy conversion that rely on the existence of either RF wave or ambient solar sources, body heat, as a direct energy source from the human body, is also an available energy source for wearable systems.
Bharti et al.106 reviewed the progress of organic thermoelectrics and made a comprehensive comparison of the electrical and thermal transport properties of various conductive polymers. The design of thermoelectric devices aims to achieve a right balance between physical properties among electrical conductivity (σ), thermal conductivity (κ) and the Seebeck coefficient (S) to enhance the power factor and quality factor zT = S2σT/κ. The energy conversion mechanism of a thermoelectric generator is shown in Fig. 7d.
Reported by Lu et al.,107 based on nanostructured Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3, a synthesized array of 12 thermoelectric junctions was deposited on both sides of silk fabric. The fabric-based thermoelectric generator was designed to yield the temperature gradient energy between the human body and the ambience with a deliverable voltage of ∼10 mV and power of ∼15 nW.
Suarez et al.108 proposed a flexible thermoelectric structure by depositing Eutectic Gallium-Indium (EGaIn) liquid metal interconnects on bulk thermoelectric legs (off-the-shelf Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 p-type and Bi2Se0.3Te2.7 n-type granules). The liquid metals and thermoelectric legs were then encapsulated in a stretchable elastomer. Bending tests showed that the device was mechanically robust, so it provided an alternative approach for a flexible power source for wearable electronics.
Kim et al.11 developed a glass fabric-based TEG (Fig. 7e) that can be attached to curved surfaces of the wearer's body (Fig. 7f). The fabricated band-type TEG was equipped with 11 thermoelectric junctions, and the generated open-circuit voltage was 2.9 mV. When the ambient temperature was 15 °C, the load matching power was 3 mW. A stack flexible thermoelectric generator was proposed by using CNTs as the p-type elements.109 The measured open-circuit voltage for 72 couples of CNT films was 465 mV at a 49 K temperature gradient.
Du et al.110 carried out a detailed review focusing mainly on flexible thermoelectric materials and devices. Conductive polymer thermoelectric (TE) materials, polymer TE nanocomposites, and inorganic flexible thermoelectric thin-film materials were summarized and compared in terms of fabrication methods, active materials, device hierarchies, and power performances. Reported by Bubnova et al.,111 flexible polymers could also be semi-metallic. Bahk et al.,112 on the other hand, reviewed and categorized flexible TEGs by their fabrication methods, such as screen printing, inkjet printing, molding, lithography, CNT composite formation, and vacuum deposition.
A flexible and wearable TEG could be fabricated by screen-printing,113,114 based on organic materials like poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS),115 in the form of a thin film116,117 or a micro-generator on a flexible substrate.118 Sugahara et al.119 fabricated a flexible TEG module on a plastic substrate, including an array of 250 commercial bismuth-telluride granules. The output power, mechanical strength and bending performance for different temperature gradients and bending cycles were studied. The device, at a 105 K temperature gradient, exhibited an output power density of 158 mW cm−2. Suemori et al.120 presented a flexible TEG that was printed onto a substrate made with polyethylene naphthalate films. Carbon nanotubes with 35 vol% of voids were used, resulting in a remarkably lightweight device (∼15.1 mg cm−2) and a power density of 55 mW m−2 at a 70 K temperature gradient. Kanahashi et al.121 reviewed the recent progress of flexible TE devices based on 2D materials. 2D materials, also known as single-layer materials, are crystalline materials with a single layer of atoms.122–127 The Fermi level tuning method and 2D materials in the single-crystalline and polycrystalline forms, i.e., graphene, black phosphorus, and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers, were discussed. The concept of flexible TEG-powered devices for use in IoT scenarios was envisaged.128 Nan et al.129 reported thermoelectric modules formed from 3D helical coil structures obtained by depositing 2D thermoelectric materials on flexible films. Proposed by Wan et al.,130 flexible thermoelectric materials with n-type junctions could be synthesized via an electrochemical intercalation technique. The resulting hybrid superlattice was composed of alternating inorganic TiS2 monolayers and organic cations. Electrons were injected into the inorganic layer from the outside, and then stabilized with organic cations to provide n-type carriers for current and energy transfer. The hybrid superlattice has a high power factor as well as a low thermal conductivity.
Compared to thin-film based TEGs, fiber and textile TEGs have advantages in terms of flexibility, wearability, and lightweight.131,132 There are two approaches to fabricate fiber and textile TEGs, namely, textiles as substrates133via vertical or parallel alignment and yarns as building blocks134 from 1D thermoelectric yarns to 2D and 3D interlacing. Fiber and textile TEGs rely on organic thermoelectric materials, which possess high flexibility and lightweight but have low ZT values. The low thermoelectric performance of organic textiles can be compensated for by densely knitting methods to increase the number of thermoelectric p–n couples. However, compared to thin film TEGs, textile TEGs could reduce contact area between smart textiles and curved skin surfaces because the weaving structures in smart textiles could cause a rough topography.135 Besides, advanced encapsulation methods are also of significant importance to reduce the wear of textile TEGs.
In a word, the thermoelectric energy conversion method utilizes the thermoelectric effect of temperature difference, which can output a larger current. The thermoelectric gradient between the body and ambient can be used in stationary scenarios. Recently, researchers have reported thermosensitive crystallization–boosted liquid thermocells for low-grade (below 373 Kelvin) heat harvesting, which paves the way for body heat energy harvesting at room temperature.136 However, a single thermoelectric junction can only provide very limited power, requiring hundreds of thermoelectric p–n junctions in series to provide power for driving the sensor, so the area of the device is relatively large. Flexible thermoelectric devices can be made by using flexible substrates, liquid metal flexible connections, smart fibers and textiles, and two-dimensional materials, which also provides a basis for their application in the field of wearable electronics.
3.4. Fuel cell chemical energy conversion for wearable systems
Beyond the aforementioned power generation methods using radiofrequency waves, solar radiation, and temperature gradients, a fuel cell is also a clean and renewable energy source for electricity generation.
An FC is an electrochemical energy conversion unit in which chemical energy is converted into electricity through a pair of redox reactions of a fuel and an oxidizing agent. There are various types of fuel cells, and the difference lies in the type of electrolyte and different startup times. Conventional FCs are solid and bulky like solid oxide fuel cells, and alkaline and phosphoric acid fuel cells; however, some emerging FC technologies (e.g., direct methanol fuel cells, microbial fuel cells, enzymatic biofuel cells, and flexible proton exchange membrane fuel cells with short startup times) have been proposed, making them potential candidates as power sources for wearable systems.
Tominaka et al.137 developed an on-chip bendable fuel cell based on cycloolefin polymer. The as-prepared direct methanol fuel cell had a very compact size of 25 mm × 20 mm × 0.188 mm, and the power density was 83 μW cm−2. Hollinger et al.138 fabricated a direct methanol fuel cell made of all-polymer materials. The strategy of assembling the polymer-encapsulated anode and cathode in Kapton windows reduced the thickness of the whole device to 1 mm, a significant improvement over other microfluidic fuel cells.139,140 Chang et al.141 reported a bendable polymer electrolyte fuel cell. The device could deliver remarkable power, and the power density was up to 71 mW cm−2, depending on bending conditions.
Besides a microfluidic and direct-ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) or DMFC, a flexible proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was also successfully fabricated (Fig. 7g).142 The fabricated flexible air-breathing PEMFC was characterized by lightweight (0.065 g) and thin thickness (0.22 mm) and offered a power density of 145.2 mW cm−2. After 600 bending test cycles, 89.1% of its original performance was still retained. Part et al.143 presented a rollable polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (Fig. 7h). The device showed a performance degradation of less than 10% after a bending fatigue test of 200 cycles.
Recently, Wang et al.144 developed a paper-based hydrogen fuel cell that eliminates the need for hydrogen storage by utilizing aluminium foil for in situ hydrogen generation. The device had high faradaic efficiency, and the peak power density was 4 mW cm−2. Zhai et al.145 presented a stretchable DEFC. The as-fabricated fuel cell used vertically-aligned gold nanowires (AuNWs) as the anode and Pt black modified v-AuNWs as the cathode. The electrode had an interdigital arrangement in which a layer of a sponge was used as a fuel container. The test indicated that the wearble fuel cell had a stretchability of up to 50% elongation strain (Fig. 7i), and the power loss rate was less than 40%.
In addition, rich biofuels, e.g., glucose, fructose, and lactate, can be oxidized by biocatalysts in the form of Bio-Fuel Cells (BFCs), such as Microbial Bio-Fuel Cells (MBFCs) and Enzyme Bio-Fuel Cell (EBFCs).146,147 Specifically, EBFCs that could be merged into a textile platform have been reported, including enzymes on textile substrates and utilizing yarns as building blocks to design fiber electrodes.148–150 There are several challenges for recent textile EBFCs. The output power of EBFCs is not stable due to varying body conditions, and the energy conversion efficiency of biofuels is low because of the weak mechanical robustness and chemical durability of electrodes.95
To sum up, the FC electrochemical energy conversion technology can realize an ultra-light mass and high power density energy source. It can be made into an ultra-thin device with a tattoo-like electronic skin, coated on a textile substrate or knitted as yarn-shaped garments, exhibiting excellent flexibility and tensile properties. However, fuel cells have a low life cycle and need a continuous fuel supply, so they cannot be applied to the field of implantable biomedicine. Fuel cells also require a long start-up time, bringing challenges in the real-time data acquisition of Internet of Things-enabled health monitoring and smart homes.
3.5. Mechanical energy harvesting for wearable systems
Mechanical energy harvesting refers to the method of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. From a perspective of macro- and meso-scales, mechanical energy harvesting indicates the techniques of vibration-based energy harvesting, that is, converting mechanical motion into electricity. Research on vibration-based energy harvesting began in the 1990s and can be categorized into three technologies: (1) electrostatic energy harvesting;151,152 (2) piezoelectric energy harvesting;153,154 and (3) electromagnetic energy harvesting.17,18 Wind power is the use of wind to move the blades of wind turbines to drive the electromagnetic generator, and then convert the mechanical kinetic energy into electrical energy, which is also classified as electromagnetic power generation.
From a perspective of micro- and nano-scales, nanogenerators are defined as devices that use displacement current in Maxwell's equations to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.155 Nanogenerators consist of piezoelectric and triboelectric approaches. It should be noted that the pyroelectric generator156–158 does not belong to nanogenerators; it harvests thermal energy based on the time-varying temperature fluctuation, which was also different from a TEG based on the relative temperature difference.
A TENG is also a kind of electrostatic energy harvesting device; in order to distinguish the difference between early electrostatic energy harvesting devices and triboelectric nanogenerators, in this paper electrostatic energy harvesting is divided into two categories: (a) using electret-based electrostatic harvesters (electrostatic energy harvesting based on pre-charged electrets and vibration-induced capacitance change) and (b) using triboelectric nanogenerators (electrostatic energy harvesting induced by a triboelectric effect). And, mechanical energy harvesting is divided into four categories: electret-based electrostatic, triboelectric nanogenerator, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric energy harvesting.

3.5.1. Electret-based electrostatic energy harvesting (based on pre-charged electrets and vibration-induced capacitance change). 
Scholars started research on electrostatic power generators in the 1990s.151 The electrode of the capacitor was coated with electret materials, and the electrets can permanently maintain the electric charge. Combined with the micro-electromechanical processing technology, a miniature spring supported variable capacitor device was fabricated.16 When there is vibration induced by the external environment, the area of the capacitor changes and then excite a current in the circuit.
There are several different configurations of electret-based electrostatic energy generators. The most common configurations are the gap-closing electret generator and the in-plane oscillation type. The working principle of the gap-closing electret generator is similar to that of a condenser microphone. In contrast, for the in-plane oscillation generator, the capacitor formed by the air and the capacitor formed by the electret are serially connected. The electrostatic field of the electret induces a charge with the opposite sign on the counter electrode, and the amount of induced charge varies with the overlap area between the electret and the counter electrode, thereby generating alternating current in the external circuit (Fig. 8a and b).152

(f) Voltage and power curves in relation to a resistant load under a pressure of 50 N. Reproduced with permission.175 Copyright Wiley-VCH 2018. 
An electret-based electrostatic energy harvester is typically fabricated by the MEMS process. The core techniques are the fabrication of free-standing high-aspect-ratio springs and the gap control method. Suzuki et al.16 developed an electret generator in which the top substrate was made of silicon and supported with a high aspect ratio parylene spring (Fig. 8c). The structure of the spring-mass system can be adjusted to a low resonant frequency using a block mass (Fig. 8d) suspended by soft springs or can be designed as an electrets-comb profile to operate effectively at a higher frequency.
Recently, some new electret-based microscale electrostatic power generators have been developed, some of which are structurally flexible and could be used for wearable electronics. Wang et al.174 proposed a freestanding electret generator with a linear grating structure and found that when the dimension of the stator was twice that of the effective length of the slider, the output power could be doubled compared to classical electret harvesters. The device had a charge density of 0.042 mC m−2 and was tested worn on the wrist with an output power of 71.9 μW and 118.8 μW when it was connected to a resistive load of 66.7 MΩ under striding and running conditions respectively.
Gong et al.175 presented a monocharged electret generator (MCEG) for harvesting energy by hand-shaking motions (Fig. 8e). The MCEG was designed to be worn on the wrist, and the generated voltage was 14 V, and the deliverable current was 0.65 μA (Fig. 8f). An MCEG embedded shoe insole was also tested, and the results indicated that, during walking, the device could generate a high output voltage of 178 V and the corresponding current was 2.85 μA. When the insole was connected to a resistive load, the maximum output power was about 35.63 μW.


3.5.2. Triboelectric nanogenerators (electrostatic energy harvesting induced by the triboelectric effect). 
A triboelectric nanogenerator is a particular type of electrostatic energy harvesting technology. Unlike an acceleration-driven oscillator in which electricity is induced by capacitance change, a nanogenerator is driven by external contact force, and electricity is induced by the triboelectric effect (Fig. 9a). The nanogenerator was invented by Prof. Zhong Lin Wang in 2012.176

(j) Illustration of a self-powered pacemaker based on the BISS. (k) Diagram and results of an electronic calculator powered using the BISS. Reproduced with permission.196 Copyright 2019, American Chemical Society. 
The primary modes include the vertical contact–separation,177–179 lateral sliding,25,180 single-electrode,181 contact freestanding triboelectric layer (CFT),182 sliding freestanding triboelectric layer (SFT),183 non-contact,184 and other modes.185
For the vertically contact-separation nanogenerator, under the action of external contact force, the two oppositely charged surfaces separate and merge repeatedly, and these charges will generate an electric field between the plates, thereby creating a potential difference between them.177 For the laterally sliding nanogenerator, due to the effect of sliding friction, a voltage difference is created to drive the electron flow in the external load.186
Wang's group181 also developed a single-electrode working mechanism for a TENG by utilizing a triboelectric polyamide (PA) polymer film and aluminium foil to form contact and separation. The induced voltage signals of the as-fabricated TENG matrix could also be extracted to analyze the profiles of the applied pressure. Due to this feature, the TENG can also be used as a sensor and does not rely on the external power source.
Chen et al.187 presented a DC F-TENG patch with a compact size of 1.5 cm × 3.5 cm, which was fabricated by yarn intersection, together with yarn supercapacitors, knitted on garments in the form of patches to collect and store energy to power small electronic gadgets, i.e., the hygrothermograph and calculator. The warp yarn was composed of a three-ply twisted nonconductive PA yarn, and the weft yarns contained PA nonconductive and conductive yarns. Conductive PA yarns (i.e., frictional and breakdown yarns) were connected as electrodes and separated with PA nonconductive yarns (Fig. 9c–e). DC energy can be harvested continuously when the finger moves back and forth on the surface of the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film connecting with two electrodes.
Mallineni et al.188 presented a wireless triboelectric nanogenerator (W-TENG) fabricated by 3D additive manufacturing technology. Teflon and graphene polylactic acid (gPLA) materials were used as top and bottom electrodes. The W-TENG generated a high output voltage of >2 kV, and the harvested energy can be transmitted wirelessly within a distance of 3 m. The Cu tape attached to the bottom gPLA electrode was used as an antenna for communication with a customized signal processing circuit.
Lai et al.189 presented a fabric triboelectric nanogenerator characterized by waterproof function. By the conjunction of contact triboelectrification and electrostatic induction, the device could collect the energy of tiny impacts and body motions and thus serve as a wearable soft fabric power supply.
Lu et al.190 developed a stretchable triboelectric nanogenerator on a rubber substrate. The device included many units of a single-electrode TENG that formed a ladder structure (Fig. 9b). The structure showed good flexibility and stretchability with an elongation of 120% and a curvature of 90°. The measured results showed that the device had a voltage to tensile force sensitivity of 2.01 V N−1.
Ahmed et al.191 presented a ferrofluid-based triboelectric nanogenerator, which can induce a triboelectrification effect caused by hazard stimuli, i.e., a strong magnetic field, sound pressure, and impact force. The ferrofluid-based triboelectric nanogenerator was composed of a deformable elastomer tube filled with ferrofluid (as a triboelectric layer) which was surrounded with patterned copper wires (as an electrode), the device had up to 300% stretchability.
Inspired by the origami process, Tao et al.192 developed a TENG integrated with folded film electrets that could be easily formed by a high degree of paper folding through two-layer liquid crystal polymer (LCP) strips. Gently tapping it with a finger could form an instantaneous 1000 V open circuit voltage and 110 μA short circuit current, and the peak power density was 0.67 mW cm−3. Recently, the calculated output voltage from TENGs could reach over 20 kV,193 updating a new record for TENG devices.
TENGs are compatible with many organic material families, so TENGs could provide a good power supply solution for flexible electronic devices,194 which has become a research hotspot in recent years in the fields of wearable devices (Fig. 9f–k),195,196 2D-material based ultrathin film generators,197,198 implantable biomedical engineering devices,20 smart clothing,199–201 and self-powered systems with sensing function.202,203
Compared to vibration-based electrostatic energy devices that require pre-charged electrets on rigid substrates, TENGs, based on electrostatic transduction induced by triboelectric effects, show great potential for integration with textiles. There are three processing methods that have been reported on textile TENGs, namely layer stacking, weaving or knitting using functional yarns, and additional manufacturing based on 3D printing. For layer stacking, the as-prepared TENGs with working modes such as contact-separation,204 lateral sliding,187 single-electrode,205 and freestanding triboelectric layer206 modes were introduced. For weaving and knitting TENG textiles, it is crucial to make functional yarns, either using coaxial structures207 or by integration of various functional fibers.208 3D printing of fiber-shaped textile TENGs has also been reported,209 and thus offers an alternative solution for rapid prototyping of textile TENGs.210
Overall, academia has witnessed the prosperity and development of triboelectric nanogenerators in the past decade. Designs of diverse structural forms have been proposed and fabricated.211,212 TENGs show outstanding advantages, in terms of flexibility, power density, large-scale production potential and heterogeneous structure compatibility, rendering them one of the most promising types of energy generation devices in application scenarios of wearable systems. However, there are still challenges encountered by TENGs to boost the advance of knowledge to the daily use of wearable products. Main challenges include encapsulation technology to prevent moisture and liquid contaminants from impairing their power performance, long-term mechanical durability, and efficient large scale production.


3.5.3. Electromagnetic energy harvesting. 
Unlike electromagnetic field power transfer defined in Section 3.1, electromagnetic energy harvesting refers specifically to bringing in magnets and energy conversion of mechanical motions of magnets into electricity via coil damping (Fig. 10a). Compared with other energy harvesting modes, the advantage of the electromagnetic energy conversion based on Ferrari's law is that it can deliver a large amount of current and high power in the middle and high frequency ranges, has a strong load capacity, and electromagnetic energy harvesters are cost-effective and can be facilely mass-produced.

The typical mechanics of linear electromagnetic energy harvesters include a cantilever beam with tip mass (Fig. 10c, f and i), translational resonance and diaphragm resonance (Fig. 10b, d, e, g and h). It could also be possible combinations of the above three concepts. In contrast, the classical theories of nonlinear electromagnetic energy harvesters include the hybrid structures of the cantilever beam and external magnet, a frequency up-conversion configuration, monostable Duffing resonators213,214 and bi-stable resonators.215,216
Recently, some new mesoscale electromagnetic power generators have been developed, and some of these devices can be worn on the human wrist and the limbs of the body.
Maharjan et al.242 proposed a wearable electromagnetic energy harvester in which a cycloid profile was designed to form a curved path to accelerate the rapid descent of a free-rolling spherical magnet, increasing the changing rate of magnetic flux (Fig. 11a and c). When the device was connected to a resistive load of 104.7 Ω, the average output power was 8.8 mW under a low frequency excitation of 5 Hz. As shown in Fig. 11c, it could continuously power a commercial wristwatch for about 34 min from 5 s of intense wrist movement.

Wang et al.243 presented a tri-hybrid energy harvester, which combined a nonlinear piezoelectric harvester, a freestanding TENG, and an electromagnetic harvester. The test results showed a power output of 10–40 mW under different human motions by handshaking, walking, and jogging.
Rahman et al.244 presented a hybrid energy harvester with an electromagnetic generator and two triboelectric harvesters. When the device was connected to a resistive load of 1.5 kΩ and driven at 6 Hz/1 g, it could deliver a normalized power density of up to 3.13 mW cm−3 g−2. In the in vitro test, the best output power of the harvester in the case of the horizontal handshake was 131.4 mW (Fig. 11b and d). Wu et al.245 proposed an energy harvesting bracelet (EHB) worn on the wrist of a wearer to capture the wearer's movement energy (Fig. 11e). The prototype can charge a 470 μF capacitor to a voltage of higher than 0.81 V during 132 ms from any single excitations. Maharjan et al.246 presented a hybrid bracelet configuration by combining the electromagnetic and triboelectric energy harvesting mechanisms (Fig. 11f). Zhang et al.14 improved the performance of the bracelet by integrating a TENG/EM hybrid structure, which was capable of charging the RuO2-based micro-supercapacitor to 2 V with a single shake of the wearer's wrist (Fig. 11g). Wu et al.247 reported a self-powered motion sensor powered by a triboelectric nanogenerator, which was regulated by a free-standing magnetic disk.
In summary, the vibration-based electromagnetic mode has the highest power generation capacity, large output current, and low production cost, and electromagnetic energy harvesters can be easily mass-produced. However, it is difficult to miniaturize magnets and coils, the device size is large, and it is challenging to be manufactured in a flexible form. The main structural forms of electromagnetic generators in wearable applications are microgenerator units and sports bracelets based on magnetic balls.


3.5.4. Piezoelectric energy harvesting. 
For meso- or micro-scale piezoelectric energy harvesters (as shown in Fig. 12a), the typical structures are cantilevered piezoelectric beams248,249 with or without tip proof mass (shown in Fig. 12b and d), diaphragm-resonant cavities (Fig. 12e),250,251 flexible thin-films (shown in Fig. 12f),252 and frequency up-conversion253,414–417 and multi-stable configurations.254–257

The piezoelectric material has been extensively studied due to its unique characteristics. Vibration-based piezoelectric energy harvesting devices are mainly fabricated by the MEMS process.249 The interface circuit of the piezoelectric energy harvester has been extensively studied, and different energy management strategies and energy efficiency enhancement schemes have been proposed.285–290
For piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), force can be exerted perpendicularly or parallelly to the axis of the nanowire. PENGs can also be categorized by the geometric configuration, namely, Vertical nanowire Integrated Nanogenerator (VING),291 Lateral nanowire Integrated Nanogenerator (LING),292 and Nanocomposite Electrical Generator (NEG),293 and fabric-like geometrical configuration. Fiber-shaped PENGs could be realized by growing ZnO nanowires on Kevlar fibers in the radial direction or by growing ZnO on PVDF-coated conductive fibers.294,295 Textile PENGs can also be fabricated by layer stacking296 and weaving of functional yarns (Fig. 12c).297,412
Overall, piezoelectric energy harvesters and textile PENGs are good power sources for biomechanical energy collection and wearable scenarios. Piezoelectric materials are very sensitive to strain and have several working modes such as the d31 mode, d33 mode, and d15 mode,257 and thus can be specifically designed according to the characteristics of external loads. To fulfil the gap between current piezoelectric techniques and real wearable applications on the human body, both the energy conversion efficiency and simplified material fabrication methods need to be improved.298,299

3.6. Pros and cons of various energy generation methodologies for wearable systems

Table 2 summarizes the pros and cons of various energy conversion and associated power generation technologies. The power densities of the energy harvesting methods can reach up to about 10 μW cm−2, which is sufficient to drive a self-powered sensor.247 If the power management circuit is designed properly, it can even drive the entire system with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless data transmission function. The electromagnetic field energy conversion method can facilely realize wireless power transmission, in which near-field inductive coupling power transfer can output higher power at the milliwatt level and tens of milliamps of current, which can drive most commercial sensors; and far-field wireless transmission can collect radiofrequency waves, including 900 MHz/2.4 GHz WiFi signals, unlicensed ISM Radio bands, and future 5G mm-wave signals; therefore, electromagnetic field energy conversion can be compatible with IoT network communication systems to improve wireless energy supply for smart home sensor terminals. In addition, a printed RF antenna can be produced in a mature and low-cost way, and combined with flexible electronic devices such as diodes, supercapacitors and printed solar cells. Flexible fully printed wireless self-powered sensor devices can be produced for wearable electronics, providing a promising wireless power supply and data transmission solution. The limitation of the electromagnetic field energy conversion mechanism is that the near-field mode can only work at a short distance relative to the size of the antenna, and even if the transmission distance can be improved by designing resonance coupling, the maximum transmission distance is generally not more than ten times the size of the antenna; while the far-field wireless power transmission has a low reception power, generally at the μW level. For sensors with large power consumption, other power supply methods, such as solar power and batteries, need to be assisted. Besides, the antenna design needs to consider the trade-off between the radiation angle and directivity, and the radiation interference of the external electromagnetic equipment needs to be considered.

The photoelectric energy conversion technology is relatively mature, with high power density and large output current. It can meet the power requirement of most sensors, and silicon solar cells or flexible organic solar cells can be chosen to adapt to different application scenarios of sensing systems. It can be integrated with other printed, electronic devices to build a flexible electronic circuit system, which is an excellent power supply method for wearable electronics. The challenges of solar cells are their dependence on light conditions. In rainy days or when the solar radiation is insufficient, it is challenging for the system to work stably and continuously. This poses a bottleneck problem for military wearable applications, such as special forces outdoor power generation clothing. Besides, the commercial transparent conductive material indium tin oxide (ITO) is expensive and brittle; the substitutes for ITO are under exploration such as flexible CNTs, graphene, PEDOT:PSS films, and silver grid hybrid electrodes, whose transparency and conductivity need to be further improved to meet the requirement of PV application.
The thermoelectric energy conversion method utilizes the thermoelectric effect of temperature difference, and can output a larger current. In addition, the relationship between the temperature difference signal and the amount of electricity can be established for active temperature sensing. The thermoelectric energy between body temperature and the ambient temperature difference can be used to power a watch. However, a single thermoelectric junction has a very limited output voltage, requiring hundreds of thermoelectric p–n junctions in series to provide power for driving the sensor, so the area of the device is relatively large. Flexible thermoelectric devices can be made by using flexible substrates, liquid metal flexible connections, and two-dimensional materials, which also provides a basis for their application in wearable electronics.
The flexible fuel cell electrochemical energy conversion technology can realize an ultra-light mass and high power density energy source. It can be made into an ultra-thin device with a tattoo-like electronic skin, exhibiting excellent flexibility and tensile properties. However, fuel cells have a low life cycle and need a continuous fuel supply, so they cannot be applied to the field of implantable biomedicine. Fuel cells also require a long start-up time, bringing challenges in the real-time data acquisition of Internet of Things-enabled health monitoring and smart homes.
The conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy is the most widely studied type of energy conversion method. The earliest research on energy harvesting also began with electrostatic power generation technology. Electrostatic power generation can use MEMS technology to process high-aspect-ratio silicon-based springs and a proof mass. It is a type of power generation technology with the best compatibility of large-scale integrated circuit technology and thus is easy to miniaturize and can be designed into a low-frequency or high-frequency structure. Electrostatic power generation current is small, and the quality factor is high. Hence, the frequency band is narrow, and the electret material is expensive, which is not conducive to cost reduction. The electromagnetic mode has the highest power generation capacity, large output current, and low production cost, and electromagnetic energy harvesters can be easily mass-produced. However, it is difficult to miniaturize magnets and coils, the device size is large, and it is challenging to manufacture electromagnetic devices in a flexible form. Therefore, it is suitable for wearable application scenarios such as smart backpacks and smart sports phone bags with large sizes and high power requirements. Piezoelectric energy harvesters and textile PENGs are good power sources for biomechanical energy collection and wearable scenarios. There are many types of piezoelectric materials, and piezoelectric energy harvesters can have a variety of structural forms and thus can be specifically designed according to the characteristics of external loads. However, piezoelectric materials generally have high internal resistance. Compared with the larger output voltage, the output current is very small, which is challenging to drive high-load circuits, but the piezoelectric signals can be captured in a wide frequency band. The signal can be used as a passive monitoring device to monitor changes in pulsation and pressure signals. Since it was proposed, the triboelectric nanogenerator has developed rapidly and been extensively researched. It can be categorized into many types. Because it is based on organic materials and has good natural flexibility, it can also be produced by fiber and textile production technology. Through series and parallel connection of plentiful nanogenerator units, a high power density can be achieved. The nanogenerator has shown good prospects in many wearable electronics applications.
4. Power generation for wearable systems
4.1. General requirements and power consumption of wearable systems
Wearable devices need to be flexible and stretchable to suit the wearer's different postures. Wearable devices for outdoor, sports and industrial sites need to meet waterproof and dustproof requirements of Ingress Protection (IP) code. Besides, wearable devices must be smart, i.e., designed on an intelligent platform that can be compatible with IoT architecture, and thus the system should consist of a microcontroller, one or multiple power generation sources, several sensors, and a wireless transceiver. Low power consumption is the core requirement for wearable devices to enter practical use. In the entire system structure, the power consumption of the sensor and wireless transmitter accounts for the main proportion. Therefore, combining different application scenarios, selecting the appropriate sensors and wireless transmission modules, and matching power supply modes are the core of the design problem.
The typical power consumption and key specifications of modular units such as micro control units, power management units, wireless transmission units and various sensors are investigated. Table 3 summarizes the size, packaging solution, sensitivity, measurement range, power supply voltage, current and power of different working modes of the latest low-power wearable chip modules and devices in industry, critical parameters of wireless data transmission modules, and the detection principle, size and power consumption of the latest cutting-edge wearable sensors in academia.

The complete wearable system needs to include sensors,300 a Microcontroller Unit (MCU), an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC),301 a DC–DC converter,302 a power management unit, a wireless transmission module and a human–computer interaction interface. The power consumption of the sensor varies from 10 mW to 50 mW, depending on the sensor type, detection range, and sensitivity. The module with the most substantial system power consumption is the wireless transmission module, even if the industry's latest low-power Bluetooth chip (Insight Sip1507) is used,303 and there is also 50 mW power consumption when working in the RF receiving and transmitting modes, and the effective transmission distance is within 20 m. If the Long Range (LoRa) protocol304 with a longer transmission distance is used, the power consumption can be as high as 110 mW or more. In addition, the wireless transmission system also consumes 3–15 mW of power during data processing,305 making the wireless transmission part the main power load of the wearable system. Besides, the display screen also consumes much power. If flexible organic LEDs are used, power consumption can reach 45 mW.306 To minimize the power consumption of the interactive part, electrophoretic display technology can be adopted, and the power consumption can be reduced to tens of microwatts. Even so, the power consumption of a complete wearable system that supports IoT technology and real-time sensing and monitoring is between 50 mW and 100 mW. Therefore, the power generation technology has become a bottleneck for wearable devices to be fully applied.
4.2. System architecture for wearable systems
The system of wearable devices includes three parts: power source, electronic circuit and mechanical structure. The system architecture is shown in Fig. 13. The power source part may be an RF rectenna, a photovoltaic cell, a thermoelectric device, or a micro power supply source based on mechanical motion and force such as electrostatic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, or triboelectric power generators. It can also be a hybrid integration of the above power supply sources, such as an electromagnetic/triboelectric nanogenerator, a photovoltaic/RF module, and a piezoelectric/TENG hybrid system. The electronic circuit part includes rectification, filtering, and DC–DC voltage conversion modules. For low voltage level to high voltage level conversion, a DC booster can be adopted, which is mainly used by the electromagnetic, thermoelectric or RF power generation module; whereas for high voltage level to low voltage level conversion, a DC buck converter can be used, which is mainly used by piezoelectric, TENG and electret-based electrostatic energy harvesters. The electronic circuit part also includes energy storage modules, such as batteries and supercapacitors, which need to be matched with a power management circuit to control the charging and discharging processes of the energy storage elements and use the MCU to control the working modes of the system, including the sleep mode, acquisition mode, and transmission mode. The entire system works with optimal low power consumption. The flexibility and extensibility of wearable systems are mainly realized by mechanical parts, including flexible substrate materials, flexible connectors and flexible printed circuit boards (PCBs).

4.3. Sensors for wearable systems

4.3.1. Material platform. 
The materials of existing research studies can be simply divided into three types: metals, carbon, and polymers. As wearable strain sensors, the materials should have both conductivity and flexibility. Most sensors use metal (oxide) nanowires, metal nanoparticles and/or carbon as their key sensing materials, but use polymers as their substrates to achieve their flexibility. Different combinations of sensing materials and substrates can bring different performances for a wearable sensor.
Metals and metal oxides. 
In ultrasensitive wearable sensors, gold, silver, platinum and ZnO are frequently used as sensing materials.307–311 In general, these materials always have a high sensitivity (high GF), but lower flexibility and a higher price.310 Their metals or metal oxides are processed into nanowires or nanoparticles or coated on substrates.
Mostly, nanowires are used as nano-networks or aligned arrays to achieve sensing properties. The resistance change between connection and un-connection between “islands” is the basic principle of metal sensors.
As for nanoparticles, sometimes they are manufactured into a specific shape to enhance their sensitivity.308 Some research studies also reported using metal nanoparticles (particularly gold nanoparticles) as coating enhancements on textiles.312 Besides, nanoparticles can also work as “islands” in a substrate matrix, which is similar to some research studies of metal nanowires, to provide a resistance change under different strains.
Coated metals are mostly used in crack-based sensors. By coating metals on polymer substrates (pre-strained) to form cracks, the resistance can also change with connection and disconnection of coated metal “islands”.307
Carbon. 
In the manufacture of wearable sensors, there are three main types of carbon materials: CNTs, carbon black (CB) and graphene. They all have pretty good conductivities and can be manufactured easily and cheaply. However, the difference in nanostructure also brings different electronic performance in sensors. Most carbon-based sensor research studies show that graphene has better sensitivity most of the time,313 while CB and CNTs may have better flexibility. Also, some mechanical properties may differ between these different types of carbon; for example, CNTs have a high piezoresistivity, while the other two types do not have.
The sensing mechanism is multitudinous, including structural deformation, tunnelling effects and over-contact area among the functional nanofillers.314 Different mechanisms bring different sensitivities, depending on the nanostructure of carbon, substrate material and manufacturing procedure.
Polymers. 
As mentioned above, most polymers in wearable sensors are used as flexible substrates. In this case, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Ecoflex are widely used.
PDMS is one of the most widely used silicon-based organic polymers with optical transparency, inertness, and non-toxic and non-flammable characteristics. The mechanical properties of PDMS are defined by a variety of factors, but it is relatively easy to tune them; hence PDMS is regarded as a suitable substrate in micro- or nanoelectromechanical systems.
Ecoflex is a kind of polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), which is stretchable with high stiffness and toughness. It is also widely used as a substrate in nanoelectromechanical systems.
However, there is another kind of polymer called PVDF, which is not only used as a substrate but also as a sensing material. This polymer has strong piezoelectricity with several forms depending on chain conformations. This makes it a perfect material for sensing. Also, it is stable, flexible, and inert as most other kinds of polymers, and has become a novel material in the sensing field.


4.3.2. Mechanism. 
Strain sensors. 
Strain sensors can be roughly divided into five kinds based on different sensing mechanisms: piezoresistivity, geometrical change, disconnection, cracking and tunnelling effects.310,315
Piezoresistivity is the change in resistance of materials by structural deformations. PVDF, as mentioned above, is a perfect polymer material with this effect.316,317 Besides, CT and ZnO nanowires also show strong piezoresistivity during deformation. There are also piezoresistive nanosensors existing which can be aligned in a specific array to form wearable sensors.318 Generally piezoresistive sensors cannot respond to dynamic vibration with ultraweak energy, and the sensitivity is highly dependent on materials.317
Geometrical change is the change in resistance and capacitance with the geometrical parameters (such as length and radius) of materials. The resistance and capacitance may change with different strains. With a specific relationship between resistance/capacitance and Poisson's ratio, the change can be a linear function of strain in a specific region. However, once the strain exceeds the linear region, the relationship may not be linear anymore, which also increases the difficulty of signal analysis. This mainly depends on the materials and detailed nanostructure of the sensor.
The disconnection mechanism can be more easily understood. When a nanomaterial network is connected, the electron can easily pass through; while when bending or stretching, the network is not connected, and hence the electron cannot pass through. Metal nanowires and graphene flakes can be used in this kind of sensor. With the nanostructure sliding, nanowires and graphene “islands” can freely connect with or disconnect from each other.319
The cracking mechanism is a bionic principle, which comes from the vibration sensor on the feet of Arachnids. This kind of sensor uses the cracks on sensing materials (mostly CNTs, graphene, and metals) coated on a flexible substrate to change the conductivity of the sensor. Enlargement of cracks can limit the conduction of sensing materials. From previous research results,309,320 this kind of sensor always has high sensitivity, which can be further enhanced by increasing the crack depth. However, low stretchability is a problem.
As for the tunnelling effect, it is the phenomenon of electrons crossing through a non-conductive barrier formed by closely placed materials. CNTs are a typical material to show this effect, as well as some metal materials can also be used. A sandwich structure is widely used to form a tunnelling pathway, with a relatively higher voltage required.321
Temperature sensors. 
There are three kinds of temperature sensors:322 RTDs, thermistors, and thermocouples.
Both RTDs323 and thermistors are widely used temperature sensors. The difference between the thermistor and the RTD is that the material used in the thermistor is usually ceramic or polymer, while the RTD uses pure metal.324 The temperature responses are also different. The RTD is useful over a larger temperature range, while the thermistor usually achieves higher accuracy over a limited temperature range, typically −90 °C to 130 °C. A thermocouple is an electrical module composed of two different electrical conductors that form an electrical connection. The thermocouple generates a temperature-related voltage due to the thermoelectric effect, which can be interpreted as measuring temperature. Compared with most other temperature measurement methods, thermocouples are self-powered and do not require external excitation. The main limitation of thermocouples is accuracy. It is challenging to reduce system errors to less than one degree Celsius (°C).
Other sensors. 
In addition to strain gauges and temperature sensors, other wearable, flexible sensor devices include pressure sensors,325,326 gas concentration sensors,327 acoustic sensors328 and fingerprint sensors.329 Their material platforms, fabrication techniques, and evaluation methods are similar to those of strain and temperature sensors.
As shown in Fig. 14, the thermistor (Fig. 14a and b), pressure sensor (Fig. 14c) and fingerprint sensor (Fig. 14d and e) can be fabricated on a flexible substrate with an excellent stretchable and bendable performance as well as maintaining high transparency. Apart from freestanding fibers and woven fabrics,21 sensors can also be made from non-woven fabrics. For example, non-woven fabric (NWF) based on conductive MXene/cellulose nanocrystal fibers was presented to make wearable strain sensors,330 a negative temperature RTD based on graphene/alginate composite NWF was made and could be attached to human skin,331 and a wearable humidity sensor was fabricated from NWF coated with graphene oxide.332

4.4. Energy storage devices for wearable systems
Nowadays, along with the development of the electronic industry, portable electronics with wearability and multifunctionality are becoming increasingly attractive. Wearable energy storage devices are an essential part of portable electronic devices.333–335 High-performance supercapacitors, as a kind of energy harvesting device, have already been applied to meet the urgent demand for future wearable electronic products.336,337 The demand for high-performance wearable energy storage components, including the properties of lightweight, highly flexible, high electrochemical performance, and feasible for integration ability with cloth fabrics and accessories, is driving the research progress of flexible wearable energy storage. In particular, the realization of the above functionals is closely related to electrode materials, which are also the key factor in the performance of supercapacitors. Due to electrode's significant role in flexible wearable storage systems, this article focuses on graphene and MXene electrode materials, and energy storage systems that are coupled with power generation systems. Other energy storage devices suitable for wearable systems, such as fiber lithium-ion batteries, have been fully discussed in existing review articles.12,21

4.4.1. Electrode materials. 
Electrodes made of carbon-based materials are expected to meet the requirements of wearable supercapacitors because of not only their long-life cycles, but also their good safety and skin adaptability when compared with active materials with pseudocapacitance behavior.338,339 Among carbon-based materials, graphene is widely recognized as a promising candidate electrode for supercapacitors due to its excellent electrical and mechanical properties, and also its transparency. Especially, it has been proved that the theoretical capacitance and theoretical intrinsic capacitance of single-layer graphene is ≈21 μF cm−2 and ≈550 F g−1, respectively, under the condition that the surface of graphene was fully accessible to electrolytes.340,341 Furthermore, graphene sheets could be easily assembled onto different flexible substrates, leading to their potential for use as electrodes for flexible, wearable supercapacitors. In this part, recent advanced research studies on graphene-based electrodes for wearable supercapacitors are reviewed. In addition, the remaining challenges and possible improvements of wearable supercapacitors are discussed. For wearability, flexibility is the main requirement. Hence, we will focus on the progress of graphene-based flexible electrodes for wearable supercapacitors.
Functional graphene-based electrode materials for supercapacitors have attracted wide attention for decades. However, due to the chemical inertness of 2D structure graphene, the production cost of graphene still hinders its utilization in functional devices.342 Hence, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) prepared by a chemical redox process has been widely recognized as a candidate for functional electronics due to its lower production cost and could be easily modified and assembled onto different flexible substrates.343,344 Additionally, some studies have proved that rGO has better wettability due to the presence of surface-containing oxygen groups which are not entirely reduced. Liu et al.345 utilized the good dispersibility and film-forming properties of GO to prepare GO aerogels by freeze-drying, and then reduced them by thermal reduction to obtain rGO aerogels. The as-prepared aerogel was pressed into a flexible, free-standing rGO paper-like film under 10 MPa pressure. This obtained rGO electrode has good electrochemical performance (a conductivity of 18 S cm−1 and a capacitance of 172 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1) as well as good stability (after 5000 cycles, the capacitance retention is 99% of the initial capacitance). These results realized the functional design of rGO paper-like electrode material and also proved its promising potential in the electrode for supercapacitors. However, the conductivity of this rGO paper-like electrode is not good enough and would cause a decrease in cycle stability. Cheng et al.346 used an efficient reduction process to improve the conductivity of flexible and free-standing rGO films. A conductivity of 298 S m−1 was obtained, which gave free-standing graphene-based electrodes more possibility of applying inflexible electrodes for supercapacitors. However, the stacking nature of free-standing rGO films has a lower electrolyte accessible surface area, which will block the transfer of ions within the electrode materials, resulting in lower capacitance performance.
According to the principle of the supercapacitor as an energy storage unit (electronic double layer capacitance (EDLC) and pseudocapacitance), two main strategies could be employed to improve the capacitance performance of flexible, free-standing graphene-based electrodes, which is also a key factor in the development of wearable supercapacitors. One important strategy is to introduce some “spacers” between rGO layers to increase the effective specific areas. Inspired by the relationship between hydrates in biomass materials and cells and tissues, Li et al.347 kept water molecules between rGO layers during the self-stacking process. They found that the water molecules could not only resist the van der Waals force between rGO sheets and prevent their regraphitization, but also provided an effective transmission channel for ions, resulting in the improvement of capacitance performance of free-standing and flexible rGO electrode films.
Other materials and structures were also employed to improve the capacitance behavior of flexible, free-standing rGO films. Yu and Dai et al.348 first introduced well-defined nanopores into flexible rGO films by combining carbon nanotubes and self-assembly processes. Cationic poly(ethyleneimine) decorated rGO and acid-oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes were mixed to form a hybrid flexible film, which exhibited good electrochemical capacitance (120 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 V s−1) when used as an electrode for supercapacitors. In order to further enhance the electrochemical performance of flexible, free-standing rGO films, materials with pseudocapacitance behavior were also introduced. Jiang et al.349 prepared ternary composite flexible, free-standing rGO based films. The vaporizing process was conducted to generate free-standing and flexible rGO–TiO2 films. TiO2 nanoparticles were introduced to hinder the stacking of rGO sheets and increase their pseudocapacitance. To further improve the capacitance performance while still retaining the flexibility of rGO films, conductive polymers (CPs) were deposited on the surfaces of rGO–TiO2 films to form ternary flexible, free-standing rGO–TiO2–CP composite films. The results indicated not only the improvement of capacitance owing to the synergistic effects of materials with different capacitance behaviors, but also their functional retention after combining with different materials.
The porous structure is another strategy that inhibits the restacking of graphene sheets. One of the typical studies is based on a graphene-based flexible hydrogel.350,351 Duan et al.352 proposed a convenient preparation method to fabricate functionalized three-dimensional porous rGO hydrogel films. When they were used as free-standing and flexible electrodes for supercapacitors, a high electrochemical performance was obtained (the capacitance was 412 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and after 10000 cycles the capacitor performance remained at 87%). The interconnected porous structure contributed three aspects to this high performance: (i) the porous structure blocked the stacking of rGO sheets; (ii) it had more accessible specific surface area; and (iii) the interconnected structure ensured rapid ion diffusion as well as electron transport throughout the porous network. Furthermore, this kind of rGO hydrogel could also introduce a pseudocapacitive component into their networks during the preparation process to further improve either the mechanical or electrochemical properties of the as-prepared free-standing and flexible electrodes for wearable supercapacitors.
Some flexible substrates, such as polymer scaffolds, provide another strategy to fabricate flexible graphene-based electrodes for supercapacitors. El-Kady et al.353 applied a universal strategy to produce rGO (reduced by laser-scribing) on various flexible substrates. Firstly, drop-casting or vacuum filtering methods were applied to obtain GO films on PET, porous nitrocellulose membranes, aluminium foil, and paper substrates. These flexible films were pasted on the top of digital video disc (DVD) media discs with the light scribing function enabled, and then were placed in the DVD drive for laser processing. GO sheets could be reduced by a laser irradiation process, and rGO on flexible substrates could be peeled off from the DVDs to obtain flexible rGO-based films. These films had excellent specific surface area (∼1520 m2 g−1) and conductivity (∼1738 S m−1), which contributed to their landmark performance when used as electrodes for electrochemical capacitors.
However, flexible substrates should be more skin-adaptable for the further development of wearable electronic devices. Recently, some functional and skin-adaptable hydrogels have also attracted more and more research attention in wearable electronics. In our previous studies, rGO-based conductive and adhesive materials were obtained.354 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene) was self-assembled on polydopamine-reduced and sulfonated graphene oxide sheets. Then, these nanosheets were introduced into polyacrylamide hydrogel networks to obtain skin-friendly, biocompatible, properly adhesive and conductive rGO-based hybrid hydrogels. The tensile strength and maximum tensile strain of this hydrogel were 90 kPa and 2000%, respectively, which is more suitable for adapting the motion and deformation of the human body. Moreover, the conductivity of this rGO-based hydrogel is 108 S m−1, which indicates its promising potential in bioelectronics. It should be pointed out that poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), as conductive polymer, would exhibit pseudocapacitance behavior during the electrochemical process. Hence, this rGO-based hydrogel could also be a potential candidate electrode for wearable supercapacitors, and this will be the further work focus.
Since first introduced in 2011, MXenes, as one of the material families – 2D inorganic compounds, shows their potential for use in electrode materials of supercapacitors. The mechanism of MXenes as energy storage materials is based on their redox pseudocapacitance and relies on the high-charge/discharge-rate due to the highly redox active surface, short transport path and high conductivity of the MXene backbone.355 Supercapacitor electrodes in an aqueous solution based on Ti3C2MXene paper have excellent cycling capabilities and a storage capacity of 300–400 F cm−3, which is equivalent to three times those of activated carbon and graphene capacitors.356 Ti3C2MXene clay has a volumetric capacitance of 900 F cm−3, which is higher than the capacitance per unit volume of most other materials, and does not lose any capacitance after more than 10000 charge/discharge cycles.357 Fleischmann et al.358 provided a comprehensive review of pseudocapacitive materials and associated mechanisms as energy storage devices, and MXenes, as one of the emerging pseudocapacitive materials, its current research progress and design strategies were introduced.
Flexible graphene-based fibers are a new class of electrode materials. They have been widely applied in wearable supercapacitors due to their common characteristics, including mechanical flexibility for textiles, lightweight and low cost. A unique full graphene core–sheath fiber was designed, in which the core of the graphene fiber was covered with a sheath of a three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene network.359 The graphene fiber core provided high conductivity, while the 3D graphene network provided more electrolyte accessible surface areas; this hierarchical hybrid structure, as a textile electrode, has significant advantages. The authors also constructed a flexible all-solid fiber supercapacitor by winding two prepared graphene fibers with H2SO4-PVA gel as a polyelectrolyte. The flexibility can be proved, and the capacitance of this supercapacitor achieved was about 1.2–1.7 mF cm−2. Additionally, this fiber supercapacitor can be woven into textiles, which further demonstrated the application prospect of the fiber supercapacitor in fiber electronics and smart garments.
In order to further enhance the performance of graphene fiber electrode-based capacitors, specific structures and materials with pseudocapacitance behavior were combined with graphene to fabricate flexible graphene-based fiber hybrid electrodes.360,361 Qu and Peng et al.362 created hollow rGO-conductive polymer composite fibers with high flexibility and electrical conductivity (4700 S m−1). They exhibited excellent capacitance (304 mF cm−2, 8.1 mF cm−1, 143.3 F cm−3 or 63.1 F g−1) and can also be knitted into textiles.
For decades, although impressive progress in flexible supercapacitors has already been made, the functionality of supercapacitors is always accompanied by the sacrifice of electrochemical performance. Thus, it is still significant to improve the capacitance performance of graphene and MXene-based electrodes through the combination of materials with high capacitance behavior while still retaining their flexibility. Moreover, the mechanical properties of flexible graphene and MXene-based supercapacitors are another important factor that determines their application in flexible and wearable devices.


4.4.2. Energy storage devices. 
Energy storage devices, especially supercapacitors, can have various forms, such as traditional parallel plate capacitors, coaxial solid capacitors, flexible solid-state capacitors, two-dimensional film capacitors, and one-dimensional fiber capacitors (e.g., by intertwining carbon nanotube fiber electrodes, both coaxial configuration and self-healing fiber supercapacitors could be prepared).363,364
Besides graphene-based supercapacitors, MXene-based supercapacitor devices exhibit good flexibility and hydrophilicity and electrochemical performance, indicating potential application prospects as energy storage devices for wearable systems.365 A MXene-based 1D supercapacitor was prepared by winding the electroactive nanofibers of the MXene onto a polyester yarncore through electrospinning.366 The MXene-based fiber electrodes could be weaved or knitted to form 2D textile capacitors.367,368 MXenes could also be presented in the form of conductive inks369 and further be printed onto paper substrates370 to construct planar capacitor devices. Both symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor devices have been fabricated by using MXene materials; the latter is proposed to enlarge the voltage window and improve the energy density, which could a power density of 6 mW cm−2 with an operating voltage of up to 1.5 V.371 Cost-effective fabrication methods such as screen printing could be employed to construct MXene-based supercapacitor devices, and the as-prepared devices could deliver a volumetric capacitance of 864.2 F cm−3 with a 90% performance retention after a reliability test of 10000 cycles.372 Besides screen printing, other straightforward fabrication methods were also reported for MXene capacitor preparation, such as inkjet printing,373,374 photoighography,375 laser scribing,376 laser cutting,377 and laser etching.378
Energy storage devices can also be coupled with power generation devices to establish a composite energy storage system. Chai et al.379 reported an integrated textile with threads as fundamental building blocks, which support tailoring and large-scale fabrication. The fiber supercapacitor electrode was made by growing TiN nanowires on Ti fibers, and the potassium hydroxide/polyvinyl alcohol (KOH/PVA) gel served as an electrolyte and a separator. A textile DSSC was obtained by weaving fiber-shaped photoanodes and counterelectrodes. The fiber-shaped photoanodes were prepared by growing ZnO nanowires on a Mn-coated fiber core, followed by sensitization in dye N719 and deposition of a hole-transfer layer in succession. Based on the functional fibers, the as-fabricated woven-fabric could collect solar radiation energy using the DSSC while storing energy using the fiber supercapacitors. Besides freestanding fibers and woven-fabrics, non-woven fabrics could be made from hybrid black phosphorus–carbon nanotubes through a microfluidic spinning process to construct supercapacitor devices, and the non-woven fabric devices can be connected in series to increase the output voltage to drive load components such as sensors and displays.380 Energy storage devices such as supercapacitors can also be integrated with fuel cells to form a hybrid supercapacitor–biofuel cell (SC–BFC) system.149 The SC and sweat-based BFC were screen printed on both sides of a fabric and the BFC relies on lactate, which is oxidized by enzymes to generate electricity. The SC could be charged to 0.4 V after 37 minutes of perspiration.
In addition to supercapacitors as energy storage units, a combination of flexible printed lithium-ion batteries and printed solar cells was presented with an energy density of 6.98mW h cm−2, sufficient to power a pulse oximeter.381 Other rechargeable batteries such as lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries require lower charge voltages, and thus could be combined with power sources with low output voltages, e.g., TEG. Kim et al.382 reported a wearable thermoelectric-Li–S battery system, which could generate a power of 378 μW, capable of driving a commercial glucose sensor and charging the Li–S battery to deliver a stable 2 V voltage. Energy management could also be coupled with a freestanding triboelectric nanogenerator to power a battery-free sweat sensor.383 The power management integrated circuit (IC) has several peripheral capacitors, which could be controlled by the IC to collect power from the TENG. Recently, a multifunctional coaxial energy fiber was proposed, in which the energy storage units (i.e., SC), pressure sensor, and power generation devices (i.e., TENG) are all confined in a coaxial fiber profile,384 which empowers the smart fiber with more intelligent functions.
In summary, various power generation systems (such as PV, FC, TENG, and TEG) can be coupled with energy storage devices such as supercapacitors, and lithium-ion or lithium–sulfur rechargeable batteries, to provide a composite power supply and energy management solution. More diverse combination schemes and energy management strategies are worth exploring, which will provide rich energy solutions and new power flow control ideas for wearable systems.

4.5. Flexibility, stretchability and softness tests, and wearability of wearable systems
The traditional uniaxial tensile test is currently widely adopted to evaluate the tensile performance (stretchability) of wearable devices, whereas the bending test on a specific radius round tube can evaluate its flexibility. As shown in Fig. 15, the flexural modulus was measured with customized equipment. By the surface mount of the hybrid superlattice onto glass tubes, flexibility could be evaluated according to the relationship between tube radius and sample resistivity.130,385

(e) The softness tester and evaluation for flexible energy storage devices. Reproduced with permission.335 Copyright 2019, Elsevier. 
However, the reversible tensile test and evaluation were often overlooked, which could be important to wearable systems because even the tiny irreversible deformation (i.e., plastic deformation) of functional materials (e.g., electrode materials of flexible supercapacitors386 and batteries387) and structures (e.g., p–n junctions of flexible TEGs) could cause the performance degradation of wearable devices. The residual strain-based evaluation method was proposed for better understanding of the mechanical recoverability of wearable energy storage devices,388 and this method could shed light on tensile tests and strectchability evaluation of wearable power generation systems.
For flexibility evaluation by bending tests, it is necessary to specify clearly all of the three key parameters, namely the bending angle, the bending radius, and the length of the device, because even if the length and bending radius are determined, the bending angle can have different values, the change in which could affect the test results significantly.335 It is also recommended to evaluate the performance of wearable power generation systems after repeatedly bending to both sides of the device or system.
Wearability must be considered for wearable systems. According to the international standard in the textile industry, Li et al.335 proposed a softness parameter as an indicator to evaluate the wearable performance of flexible energy storage devices. As shown in Fig. 15e, the cylindrical rod with defined mass drops to the firm clamping area of the flexible device at a specified rate. The resulting distension of the device is recorded as softness. The greater the distension, the better the softness. In addition to softness, wearability also includes breathability, biocompatibility, washability, comfortability, and aesthetics. The design of a flexible wearable system must consider the potential risks caused by the release of toxic chemical substances, e.g., hazardous metal substances in Bi–Te alloy, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and N719 dye in DSSCs.95 Besides, the flame retardant grade of the material must meet Underwriters Laboratories (UL) safety regulations. Wearable fabrics must also have good air permeability and lightweight.22
4.6. Application scenarios
The application fields of wearable devices include medical detection and intelligent diagnostic devices, the consumer electronics industry, military defense, industrial production lines, and manual inspection of defects and damage of infrastructure. Medical testing and diagnostic devices include retinal electrical stimulation and treatment, hearing aids, assisted rehabilitation devices, smart waistbands for wireless power transmission and capsule location control of capsule endoscopes. Consumer electronics include smartwatches, smart bracelets, smartphone wireless charging devices, and smart backpacks. Military defense applications include special forces field self-power-generated clothing; industrial areas include failure detection by Google Glass, package transportation monitoring using RFID tags, and wireless sensor network monitoring of civil engineering projects such as railways and bridges.

4.6.1. Healthcare – biomedical inspection and diagnosis. 
The energy conversion mechanism and power generation technology discussed above can be used not only on wearable, flexible devices in vitro but also on the power supply, signal sensing and wireless data transmission of implanted medical devices in vivo. The power supply and self-sensing of an implantable cardiac pacemaker can use a piezoelectric energy transducer, and wireless signal transmission can be realized by RF technology. The rehabilitation prosthesis can help the wearer to perform rehabilitation training and can integrate an electromagnetic energy conversion system for dynamic damping adjustment. Thermoelectric power generation or electromagnetic near-field coupling wireless power transfer can be used to replace batteries, or as a backup power source for batteries and supercapacitors, to power implanted hearing aids or smart bracelets to obtain real-time access to and manage the wearer's health data in sports, sleep and work. Studies on the use of piezoelectric transducers for retinal stimulation have been reported.3 Smart magnet arrays can be used for active guidance and localization diagnosis of capsule endoscopes, which also provides a collaborative work mode for in vivo swallowable devices and in vitro wearable devices. Besides, research studies on the materials and associated sensing functions of multifunctional balloon catheters have been reported, indicating their potential application prospects in ablation therapy and cardiac electrophysiological mapping.389
Both the thin-film and fiber and textile technologies have shown good prospects in the fields of biomedical sensing and smart monitoring. Renewable power sources based on thin-film (Fig. 16a and b) and fiber and textile electronics (Fig. 16c–h) have been fabricated in the form of solar cells,91 TEGs,11,390 and TENGs.391 A thin-film sensor platform was also presented and can be utilized to perform autonomous sweat extraction and sensing (Fig. 16i),383,392 and carry out contextual biomarker analysis using an epidermal microfluidic valving system (Fig. 16j).393 A conductive fiber-based physical sensor (Fig. 16k) is capable of bioelectrical signal monitoring (e.g., electroencephalograms, electrocardiograms, and electromyograms), whereas a conductive fiber-based chemical sensor (Fig. 16l) can be used for health inspection at the molecular level.21,394 In addition, a thin-film based flexible system (Fig. 16m and n)395 including sensing and Bluetooth data communication modules has also been developed, offering a new approach for wearable system integration. The achievement in thin-film system technology could also inspire effective integration of different functional fiber materials in future fiber and textile electronics.

4.6.2. Military defense applications. 
Military defense applications include special forces field self-powered clothing and wearable devices for hydration and fatigue monitoring (Fig. 17a), as well as soft robots for injured soldiers. Wearable power systems can also be used to strengthen logistics to meet the needs of the Air Force. Multifunctional wearable e-textiles based on graphene flakes and a scalable yarn dyeing technique,396 a wearable fall detector (Fig. 17b) using integrated sensors and thermoelectric generators,397 a textile-based triboelectric nanogenerator (Fig. 17c and d) with 2D materials such as black phosphorus for biomechanical energy harvesting,398 bionic and waterproof, stretchable nanogenerators for underwater sensing (Fig. 17e),399 and self-powered sensors for wearable and implantable electronics (Fig. 17f);400 all of these emerging technologies can be integrated into the combat uniforms of army soldiers to perform specific operations and tasks, such as those in underwater, wild, and high-temperature areas, and unmanned areas.

4.6.3. Consumer electronics. 
Consumer electronics include smartwatches, smart bracelets, smartphone wireless charging devices, and smart backpacks. Wireless power transfer based on flexible inductive coils indicates a promising approach. Inductive coils could be fabricated from printable Ni–GaIn amalgam401 or from liquid metal.44 The deliverable power can drive a mobile phone (with an average power consumption of 500 mW–2 W), which is sufficient to power wearable sensors and flexible electronics.

4.7. Perspectives and outlook
Wearable devices are undergoing changes from 3D to 2D to 1D, from MEMS three-dimensional microscale devices, to two-dimensional planar devices and smart fabrics, and further to one-dimensional fiber electronics. The progress of interdisciplinary science research and the development of technological innovation have brought the wearable industry a variety of alternative technology approaches.

4.7.1. Wearable devices. 
For 3D microscale wearable devices, besides the conventional wafer-based lithography and MEMS fabrication methods, additive manufacturing offers an agile rapid prototyping method. Micro-structured power sources such as Li-ion micro batteries could be 3D printed and achieve both high areal energy density and power density.402 For planar film devices, one of the research outlooks in wearable electronics is all-printable, flexible electronic systems. There are already printable solar cells,76 printable supercapacitors,403 printable batteries, and printable TEGs.11 In addition to power sources and energy storage components, the printable prototypes of basic components of large-scale integrated circuits such as diodes404,405 and transistors406 have also been reported. With the development of printing technology and the advance of key components such as printable radiofrequency antennas,407 printed sensors,408 and flexible printed circuit boards, it is expected to realize fully printed 2D flexible wearable devices with the same printing process in the future (Fig. 18).
 Fig. 18  Future perspectives of thin-film devices: all-in-one printable wearable electronics. 
With the development of chemistry and materials in the new family of one-dimensional fiber electronics, the integration of textiles and energy harvesters, namely smart textiles, will pave the way for sustainable, green, low weight and wearable energy solutions for distributed human electronic devices in this Information Age. Although the electrical performance of current fiber-shaped electronic devices is unsatisfactory compared to their rigid or thin-film counterparts, the fiber electronics show outstanding features in terms of lightweight, flexibility, and good compatibility with the yarn intersection process, making cost-effective and large-scale fabrication of wearable smart textiles possible. The future research hot spots of fiber electronics and smart textiles include the development of novel fiber-shaped functional materials, involvement of efficient encapsulation materials, effective integration of different functional fiber materials, and improvement of biocompatibility by replacement of toxic substances (Fig. 19).
 Fig. 19  Future perspectives of wearable systems: from wearable devices to wearable systems to wearable IoT based on wearable power generation. 
While providing power, the power generation module of a wearable device can also be used as a channel for signal perception to learn the physiological information about or abnormal state of the wearer. For example, the vibration-based power generation method (electrostatic, electromagnetic or piezoelectric) can collect vibration energy, and its voltage waveform can also determine the human body's movement posture, exercise intensity, movement frequency and other information. The TENG power generation method is based on the friction force. It can simultaneously sense the dynamic forces exerted on the ground (TENG insole) or object (TENG fabric) during human movement. The piezoelectric sensor can collect the pulsating energy of the human body and at the same time analyze the physiological state of the human body according to the voltage waveform. Thermoelectric power generation based on temperature difference can not only collect the energy of temperature difference but also determine data such as the body temperature of the wearer according to electrical signals such as voltage or current. In the future, the power source of wearable devices is not only a power supply device, but can also have both sensing and detection functions, to realize self-powered self-awareness wearable devices.


4.7.2. Wearable systems. 
Chips and packaging are crucial links to make wearable devices intelligent and reliable wearable systems. The chip is responsible for work flow control, including bus communication, data transmission, energy management, and analog and digital signal conversion, while the packaging technology is responsible for the functional protection of wearable systems, including resistance to chemical corrosion, physical wear, and environmental stress.
Conventional silicon-based integrated circuits rely on lots of fragile, rigid components that need to be protected by system packaging. When we consider integrating these types of devices in wearable devices, rigidity is very disadvantageous. In 2008, the research group of UIUC successfully integrated more than 100 p-channel field-effect transistor (p-FET) devices based on a carbon tube mesh film on a flexible substrate, thereby forming a medium-sized integrated circuit.409 It demonstrated that carbon tubes could be the potential of thin-film devices in flexible thin-film electronics. However, carbon tube thin-film devices have two limitations: (1) Their low carrier mobility. Because the carrier has to pass from the source to the drain of the device, multiple carbon nanotube/carbon nanotube junctions will introduce a lot of scattering, which dramatically reduces the carrier mobility. The carrier mobility of typical CNT thin-film field effect transistor (TFFET) devices is below 100 cm2 V−1 s−1. (2) The device size cannot be reduced. This is because the current switching ratio of the CNT TFFET device decreases as the channel length shrinks. When the gate length of the device is reduced to 2 μm, the current switching ratio is less than 100. This means it is difficult to improve the device speed and integration level further. These two limitations of thin-film based CNT devices indicate that these devices are unlikely to become candidates for the future of more than Moore's law in mainstream high-performance digital integrated circuits. However, although the device size cannot meet the requirements of conventional digital integrated circuits, it still has distinct advantages compared to the current organic thin-film devices and circuits used in flexible electronics.410 Moreover, carbon nanotubes have better flexibility; the whole process can also be easily completed on a flexible substrate. In summary, the electronics based on carbon nanotube thin-films will have strong competitiveness in the field of flexible electronics.
A hybrid-integrated system on a chip (SoC) may offer a new solution for flexible and wearable electronics. The new microcontroller can bend and flux unlike the bulky chips of the past. This enables them to be integrated into wearable systems for either vital signs or industry monitoring, as well as soft robots for injured soldiers or disabled people. In turn, we can monitor hydration, temperature, pressure caused by arm bending, and more. It has the function of turning the system on and off, and it can also collect data from sensors and save them in memory. The flexible chip and its packaging can be wrapped around the fuel capsule for leak detection, can also be used to monitor ammunition inventory, or monitor the cold chain through self-powered temperature sensing. Strengthening logistics is just one of the many ways this effort can meet the needs of the Air Force.


4.7.3. Wearable IoT. 
When wearable systems are armed with chips and can communicate with the Internet, they can enter the next stage of the task, that is, through the Internet of Things to carry out the life cycle monitoring of the wearer, the wearing group and the community.
Take full lifecycle health monitoring as an example; the overall technical route is shown in Fig. 2. Based on the advanced reduced instruction set computing (RISC) machine (ARM) architecture, custom chips for home and factory IoT could be developed considering the microelectronic circuit integration design, the production process of silicon-based chips and the microsystem packaging technology. The system includes wearable sensors, wearable power generation sources, and flexible RF data transmission modules. Among them, the smart wearable device integrates a dedicated chip for the Internet of Things and performs data communication and transmission based on the LoRa or Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT). Based on the standard architecture, combined with the particular application requirements of the home IoT or green factory, the physical layer and the media access control (MAC) address layer are redefined, and the system has low power consumption and low cost, supporting a large number of online nodes to perform reliable and safe data transmission (encrypted transmission). Every wearer sends data to the concentrator through the LoRa wide area network (WAN), which then connects the data to the public network through wireless passthrough transmission equipment. To develop an intelligent data management system on the Ethernet web, the core data fusion model of the intelligent data management system is a cyclic and iterative data fusion model. This model integrates various observation data of the overall community, such as body temperature and the heart rate, and analyzes the health conditions of every wearer and the degree of suspected disease with the help of the model to realize the identification and diagnosis of the abnormal physiological and behavioral states.

5. Conclusion
This paper reviewed cutting-edge research of various power sources in wearable, flexible electronic devices. Starting from a new definition of the figure of merit of wearable power generation methodologies, followed by the physical principles of energy conversion, we covered the power generation mechanisms of electromagnetic near-field and far-field wireless transmission, photoelectric conversion, thermoelectric generation, chemical energy generation, and mechanical motion energy conversion. The advantages and disadvantages of different energy sources were discussed in depth. A survey was conducted concerning the power consumption, ductility, flexibility, and wearability of flexible devices, sensor materials, energy storage, and process and system integration compatibility. The evaluation indexes of different power generators, including efficiency, effectiveness and figures of merit, were summarized. This paper also described the system architecture of self-powered flexible electronic devices, and its possible power flow, signal flow and stress flow paths. Perspectives for future research and development vantage points of wearable, flexible electronic devices were highlighted, including all-in-one printable wearable electronics, smart textiles based on fiber electronics, self-powered self-awareness wearable systems, hybrid-integrated SoC for flexible electronics, and IoT-enabled self-contained systems towards full lifecycle monitoring.

Broader context
Wearable devices are shaping the future and the advances and breakthroughs of associated power generation mechanisms will inspire a wide range of research ideas in the wider scientific community covering chemical, physical, and soft microelectronic science. Wearable power generation technologies also bridge the gap between state-of-the-art science research and real-world applications in this emerging field. Wearable systems with green and sustainable power sources provide a wealth of opportunities due to their broad range of applications in healthcare, soft robotics, artificial intelligence and the internet of things. This review paper provides new complementary contents of radiofrequency (RF) energy harvesting for wearable devices, and discussions of power requirement, consumption, generation and management, and the flow of power, signals and stress, and defines the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world products via a new angle with consideration at the system level and evaluation criteria. This article could be appealing to the scientific communities dedicated to multi-disciplinary cutting-edge research across electrical, biology, materials science, energy and microelectronic engineering. It could also shape the forefront and the future roadmap of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and System-in-a-Package (SiP) implementation in the semiconductor industry.
