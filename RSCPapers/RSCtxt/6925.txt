    , Accepted 25th March 2019First published on 25th March 2019AbstractA noble-metal-free chromophore–catalyst supramolecular assembly, which is composed of an organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) chromophore and cobaloximes, has been designed and synthesized for the first time for the efficient acceptorless dehydrogenation of secondary amines under blue light irradiation at room temperature. The TADF chromophore has a long lifetime of 17.4 μs with suitable redox potentials for the selective acceptorless dehydrogenation of secondary amines to afford imines and H2 through cooperative catalysis of the chromophore and cobaloximes in the supramolecular assembly. A high TON of 895 was obtained for the acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline despite its high oxidation potential (+1.38 V vs. SCE).
Introduction
Chromophore–catalyst supramolecular assemblies have been employed as considerable photocatalysts in many homogeneous and heterogeneous light-driven processes such as hydrogen evolution,1 carbon dioxide reduction,2 and organic transformations6,7 and in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DSPEC).3–5 In general, light-absorbing chromophores are covalently linked to specific catalysts through a bridging ligand in supramolecular assemblies and then undergo cooperative catalysis with adjacent catalysts. The chromophores play vital roles in light harvesting and electron transfer processes, and they are commonly composed of transition meal complexes such as IrIII8 and RuII9 complexes. These transition metal complexes have long excited-state lifetimes and tunable redox potentials that make them capable of promoting various photocatalytic reactions. However, ruthenium and iridium are rare and noble metals. Therefore, non-precious organic chromophores with long lifetimes are promising for constructing supramolecular assemblies. Although several organic chromophores such as BODIPY compounds10 and fluorescein11 have been employed to construct supramolecular photocatalysts, substrates with low oxidation potentials (e.g. TEA and TEOA) are required as well as limited turnover numbers (TONs). Moreover, halogenation (Br and I) is strongly required to achieve a long-lived excited state to achieve efficient catalysis, resulting in more complicated synthesis routes and poorer photophysical properties. Donor–acceptor (D–A) organic chromophores show intramolecular charge transfer upon light irradiation and may have long lifetimes such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) compounds with no need for halogenation,12 which have been investigated in biosensing,13 OLEDs,14 solar cells15 and photocatalytic reactions.16 Moreover, synthesis routes of D–A type TADF chromophores are well investigated and their photophysical properties and redox potentials are tunable as noble metal complexes.17 In this context, organic TADF chromophores may be good candidates to construct chromophore–catalyst supramolecular assemblies. Chromophore–catalyst supramolecular assemblies bearing such D–A type TADF chromophores for photocatalytic reactions are yet to be explored.
Catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation (CAD) is an attractive strategy for hydrogen release from liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) that are believed to be potential materials for hydrogen storage due to reversible hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.18–20 However, acceptorless dehydrogenation of LOHCs is rarely conducted under mild conditions due to high temperature.21,22 Secondary amines usually have low melting points and some secondary amines are liquid at room temperature, which makes secondary amines potential nitrogen-containing LOHCs using reversible conversion between secondary amines and imines.23 Highly efficient and selective acceptorless dehydrogenation of secondary amines along with H2 release is poorly investigated in homogeneous catalysis. Most procedures for oxidative dehydrogenation of secondary amines in the presence of stoichiometric oxidants could not release H2.24,25 Szymczak and co-workers reported solely selective acceptorless dehydrogenation of secondary amines to imines (e.g. secondary benzylamine) using a noble RuII catalyst at 110 °C after 24 h (Scheme 1).26 Additionally, the turnover number (TON) of CAD reactions was relatively low (∼50). It remains a challenge to achieve noble-metal-free acceptorless dehydrogenation of secondary amines with a high TON and selectivity at room temperature. On the other hand, CAD of amines provides an alternative to obtain imines with high atom economy. As a proof of concept, we herein report the first supramolecular assembly which consists of a D–A type TADF chromophore and CoIII moieties for CAD of secondary amines at room temperature under visible light irradiation.

Results and discussion
The assembly 1-Co, which looks like an android (four CoIII complexes as the legs and arms and 1 as the body and head), has been prepared facilely as shown in Scheme 2. 1-Co was first characterized by NMR and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS). The m/z signal at 2538.4026 (calcd 2538.4212) in the MS spectrum of 1-Co is assigned to species [M + Na]+ (M = 1-Co) (Fig. S1†), suggesting 1 was successfully tethered to four CoIII moieties. Additionally, isotopic signals are distributed with an interval of 1 in accordance with +1 charge of species [M + Na]+ (Fig. S2†). Cobaloxime Co(dmgH)2PyCl is a well-known hydrogen evolution catalyst that has been used with various photosensitizers.27–29 Thus, we chose it to collaborate with 1 and examined the performance of 1 in the supramolecular photocatalyst 1-Co.

We further found 1 could absorb moderate visible light (Fig. S3†). Its emission was structureless and centered at 591 nm with a relative quantum yield of 7.2% in dichloromethane using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as the standard (Fig. S3†). The broad emission showed a blue shift in solvents with lower polarity such as THF and toluene (Fig. S4†), suggesting the intramolecular charge transfer of 1. This solvatochromic effect can be ascribed to the D–A nature of 1. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation was then carried out to confirm the D–A structure (Fig. 1 and S5†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of 1 is mainly delocalized over the electron-rich carbazolyl groups as the donor (D) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of 1 is mainly distributed on the electron-deficient benzonitrile groups as the acceptor (A). Moreover, similar DFT results were observed when one CoIII moiety was tethered to 1 (Fig. S6†). A charge transfer (CT) state from carbazolyl groups to benzonitrile groups can be expected upon light irradiation.
 Fig. 1  HOMO and LUMO for chromophore 1 by DFT calculations. 
The HOMO and LUMO are highly isolated and ΔEST of 1 was found to be 0.13 eV, which is the characteristic nature for D–A type TADF compounds.17 It is known that a long-lived charge transfer state is important for transition metal complexes to mediate electron transfer processes in photocatalytic reactions. We then found that the photoluminescence lifetime of 1 was 17.4 μs in degassed dichloromethane at room temperature (Fig. S7†), which was comparable to lifetimes of polypyridine ruthenium(II) complexes such as popular [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (0.87 μs). Such a long lifetime ensures sufficient time for 1 to promote photocatalytic reactions. These results demonstrate that chromophore 1 possesses appropriate photophysical properties as an efficient photosensitizer in photoredox catalysis under visible light irradiation.
Redox potentials of 1 including electrochemical properties of the ground state and excited state were further studied to confirm thermodynamic feasibility of electron transfer between 1 and Co(dmgH)2PyCl. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) programs of 1 showed the oxidation potential E(1+/1) (1+ = oxidized 1) was +1.39 V vs. SCE (Fig. S8†). According to the ground-state oxidation potential and zero−zero excitation energy (E0, 0 = 2.10 eV) that was calculated from the emission of 1 at 591 nm, the excited-state oxidation potential E(1+/1*) was determined to be −0.71 V vs. SCE (E(1+/1*) = E(1+/1) − E0, 0).30 Thus, the oxidative quenching of the excited state of 1 (1*) by Co(dmgH)2PyCl (E(CoIII/CoII) = −0.67 V vs. SCE) is thermodynamically available (ΔG = −0.04 eV). The fluorescence titration experiments further verified that 1* can be oxidatively quenched by Co(dmgH)2PyCl (Fig. S9†).
The assembly 1-Co displayed weaker emission than chromophore 1 with a quantum yield of 2.9% and the absorption spectrum is similar to that of 1 (Fig. S10†). The quenching of emission was probably due to electron transfer from 1 to CoIII. Energy transfer between 1 and CoIII is negligible because the emission of 1 lies beyond the absorption of CoIII. The emission lifetime of 1-Co decreases a little bit by comparison with 1 and was determined to be 13.8 μs (Fig. S11†), indicating CoIII has slight influence on the photophysical properties of 1. Nevertheless, redox potentials of separated 1 and Co(dmgH)2PyCl were observed in the CV spectrum of assembly 1-Co (Fig. S12†). For instance, the irreversible redox waves at −0.63 V and +1.38 V vs. SCE are assigned to CoIII/CoII and 1+/1, respectively. The reduction potentials of 1 and CoII/CoI are approximate and overlapped around −1.12 V vs. SCE.8 These results suggest that the two components 1 and Co(dmgH)2PyCl have no significant electronic interaction at the ground state in the supramolecular assembly 1-Co.
Encouraged by the feasible electron transfer between 1* and Co(dmgH)2PyCl, we next employed assembly 1-Co, 1 and Co(dmgH)2PyCl (abbreviated as CoIII) in photocatalytic CAD of secondary amines. Initially, secondary benzylamine 2a was used as the substrate to examine the generation of imine and H2 in dry THF. Dry THF was used here to ensure 2a as the only hydrogen source of H2. As shown in Fig. 2, efficient H2 release was observed in degassed dry THF solution containing 1-Co and 2a upon light irradiation with blue LEDs at room temperature. A TON of 305 was obtained after 12 h of irradiation (Table 1, entry 1). However, 1-Co displayed a much lower TON when CH3CN was used as the solvent, which is probably due to ligand disassociation in CH3CN that has been studied by Eisenberg and co-workers. A lower TON of 53 was observed for the multicomponent system including separated 1 and Co(dmgH)2PyCl (Table 1, entry 5). The higher TON for the supramolecular photocatalytic system is probably due to more feasible electron transfer from 1* to Co(dmgH)2PyCl when they are linked through the covalent bond. Additionally, the emission of 1 is barely quenched by 2a according to the titration experiment (Fig. S13†). Then we can conclude that the catalytic cycle begins with the oxidative quenching of 1* by Co(dmgH)2PyCl. That is to say, covalent linkage is positively helpful for the oxidative quenching of 1* by Co(dmgH)2PyCl, resulting in higher efficiency when assembly 1-Co was used. We further found imine 3a was generated by 1H NMR, indicating successful acceptorless dehydrogenation of 2a with H2 release. Control experiments showed that visible light and two components were all required to achieve efficient acceptorless dehydrogenation, indicating the catalytic cycle is a light-driven cooperative catalysis process. We examined the performance of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ for CAD of 2a. However, unlike CAD of 2-MeTHQ (THQ = tetrahydroquinoline) with [Ru(bpy)3]2+,31 no detectable H2 was found (Table 1, entry 8). This is probably due to the high oxidation potential of 2a (EOx(2a˙+/2a) = +1.37 V vs. SCE) (Fig. S15†), which is higher than that of Ru(bpy)32+ (E(RuIII/II) = +1.29 V vs. SCE).

It is worth mentioning that light-driven CAD of secondary amine 2a for H2 release is significantly different from H2 evolution from water using tertiary amines such as TEA (EOx(TEA) = +0.69 V vs. SCE) as the substrate, because tertiary amines have much lower oxidation potentials than 2a. When tertiary amines were used, photosensitizers (e.g. IrIII complexes) are commonly reductively quenched by TEA. Additionally, tertiary amines are decomposed along with the generation of complicated by-products that could not undergo a reversible dehydrogenation–hydrogenation process.32
Acceptorless dehydrogenation of other secondary amines including 2b, 2c and 2d was also investigated (Table 2). A higher TON of 360 was obtained for the substrate with a low oxidation potential such as 2b (EOx(2b˙+/2b) = +1.25 V vs. SCE) (Fig. S16†), while 2d (EOx(2d˙+/2d) = +1.49 V vs. SCE) (Fig. S18†) with a high oxidation potential showed a poor TON of 50. Nevertheless, 2a releases one H2 (∼1.0 wt%). We then tested 1-Co in the photocatalytic CAD of another kind of secondary amine such as N-heterocyclic compound 2e. 2e also released one H2 but with 1.5 wt%. Additionally, 3e was generated with a TON of 895 when the amount of 1-Co was 0.2 μmol (Table 2, entry 4). The apparent quantum yield (AQY) at 450 nm was estimated to be 2.1% when the amount of 1-Co was 0.4 μmol and the yield of 3e was 86%. 2f was dehydrogenated to 3f in 96% yield (TON = 604) when more 1-Co was used (Table 2, entry 6). The yield was calculated with isolated 3f after careful column chromatography. Although the released hydrogen content of these amines and yields of imines are still relatively low, these results are helpful for developing the noble-metal-free photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of secondary amines as well as other nitrogen-containing LOHCs.

To better understand the catalytic cycle, we monitored changes of UV-vis absorption spectra of 1-Co in the presence of 2a upon light irradiation. As can be seen from Fig. 3, at t = 0 min, no obvious absorption peak was observed from 400 to 500 nm. After the solution was irradiated for 4 min, the absorption increased and a shoulder peak appeared in the range of 400 to 500 nm. The enhancement was ascribed to the formation of CoII species, indicating an electron transfer from 1* to CoIII along with the generation of CoII.27 We also observed a slight enhancement of absorption in the range of 550 to 700 nm, which can be assigned to CoI species.27
 Fig. 3  Time-dependent absorption spectra of 1 (25 μM) in the presence of 2a (50 mM) in degassed dry THF (3 mL) upon blue light irradiation at room temperature. 
On the basis of the above results, we proposed a plausible mechanism for hydrogen release from 2e (Fig. 4). Initially, 1-CoIII achieves the excited state 1*-Co under blue light irradiation along with subsequent electron transfer from 1* to CoIII. The resulting 1+ then oxidizes 2e to generate the radical cation 4.33 The deprotonation of 4 would produce strongly reducing radical 5 that is further oxidized to iminium ion 6 by CoII. Deprotonation of 6 affords the dehydrogenation product 3e.34 Meanwhile, CoII is reduced to CoI. It is worth noting that CoII could not be reduced by excited state 1*, because of the higher potential of E(1+/1*) (−0.71 V) than E(CoII/CoI) (−1.12 V). Further protonation of CoI leads to CoIII–H. CoIII–H is then protonated to release H2 along with the generation of CoIII for the next catalytic cycle. Other pathways such as homolysis of CoIII–H to generate H2 and CoII are not ruled out.28

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a unique supramolecular assembly for highly efficient CAD of secondary amines under blue light irradiation at room temperature. The supramolecular assembly is composed of an organic TADF chromophore as the light-harvesting unit and CoIII complexes as the catalytic center. An electron transfer from the chromophore to the CoIII center occurs upon light irradiation and they further undergo cooperative catalysis for the enhanced acceptorless dehydrogenation of secondary amines. Secondary amines were selectively converted to corresponding imines despite their high oxidation potentials. The highest TON of 895 was achieved. Our results show a promising noble-metal-free strategy for CAD reactions through cooperative photocatalysis. Organic D–A type TADF chromophores are developed increasingly, which indicates that more efficient CAD of secondary amines may be established by using more suitable chromophores. We expect organic TADF chromophores will be applied in the light-driven acceptorless dehydrogenation of more organic substrates at room temperature.

Synthesis and characterization

4-(Pyridin-4-ylmethoxy)-9H-carbazole. 
9H-Carbazol-4-ol (180 mg, 1 mmol) and 4-(bromomethyl)pyridine (171 mg, 1 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (15 mL). Then K2CO3 (270 mg, 2 mmol) was added into the solution. The mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 12 h. Then DMF was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting precipitate was dissolved in water and filtered to collect the filter cake. The filter cake was further purified to obtain a brown solid by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2/CH3OH = 100:1). Yield: 40%. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6), δ (ppm): 11.33 (s, 1H), 8.64 (d, 2H, J = 5.0 Hz), 8.19 (d, 1H, J = 5.0 Hz), 7.57 (d, 2H, J = 5.5 Hz), 7.47 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.36 (t, 1H, J = 7.5 Hz), 7.30 (t, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.17 (t, 1H, J = 7.5 Hz), 7.11 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 6.76 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 5.45 (s, 2H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, DMSO-d6), δ (ppm): 154.57, 150.34, 146.97, 141.70, 139.49, 126.91, 125.21, 122.62, 122.25, 122.00, 119.29, 112.02, 111.04, 104.91, 101.46, 68.41. HR-ESI-MS (m/z): found 275.1215 for [M + H]+ (calcd 275.1179, C18H15N2O+).


Chromophore 1. 
4-(Pyridin-4-ylmethoxy)-9H-carbazole (230 mg, 0.84 mmol) was dissolved in THF (20 mL). NaH (35 mg, 1.4 mmol) was added and stirred for 30 min at room temperature under a N2 atmosphere. Then 3,4,5,6-tetrafluorophthalonitrile (42 mg, 0.21 mmol) was added into the solution. The mixture was further stirred at 40 °C for 16 h under N2 atmosphere. After the solution was cooled to room temperature, water was added to quench excess NaH. Then THF was removed under reduced pressure and water was added to the residue. The aqueous solution was extracted with CH2Cl2 three times. The organic layer was collected and CH2Cl2 was further removed using a rotary evaporator to give a brown powder. The brown powder was then purified to give yellow powder by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2/CH3OH = 50:1).

HR-ESI-MS (m/z): found 1217.4146 for [M + H]+ (calcd 1217.4246, C80H53N10O4+).


Assembly 1-Co. 
Co(dmgH)(dmgH2)Cl2 (36 mg, 0.1 mmol) was added to a reaction flask and then CH3OH (15 mL) was added to afford a suspension. NEt3 (20 μL) was added to the suspension and stirred for 30 min to form a brown solution. A solution of 1 (27 mg, 0.022 mmol) in CH2Cl2 was added slowly through a dropping funnel. The mixed solution was stirred for 6 h at room temperature under air atmosphere. CH3OH was added to afford the yellow precipitate. The precipitate was collected through filtration and washed with CH3OH to afford 1-Co after drying under vacuum.

HR-ESI-MS (m/z): found 2538.4026 for [M + H]+ (calcd 2538.4212, C112H108Cl4Co4N26NaO20+).

General procedure for photocatalytic H2 release
The THF solution (8 mL) containing the catalyst (1-Co, 1 and CoIII) and substrates was added to a tube equipped with a small stir bar. Then the tube was degassed by using N2 and then irradiated with 16 blue LEDs (450 ± 10 nm, 3 W) at room temperature. The reaction was monitored through H2 generation. H2 was determined by GC. The headspace was analyzed by periodically sampling 100 μL with a sample lock syringe. When H2 increased no more, the reaction was stopped and solvent was removed in a vacuum. Then crude products were collected and further purified by column chromatography over silica for 3e and 3f using CH2Cl2/CH3OH (neutral alumina for 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d using hexane/CH2Cl2). TONs were determined by n(H2)/n(1-Co) or n(H2)/n(1) for the reaction of entry 4 in Table 1.
