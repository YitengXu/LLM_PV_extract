    AbstractA facile and simple process has been detailed for the synthesis of titanium glycerolate nanofibers using glycerol as both a solvent and a chelating agent. This complex has then been successfully converted to a high surface area anatase phase of titanium dioxide (TiO2) through solid state transformation without alteration in the overall fiber morphology. The structure, crystallinity and morphology of the products before and after transformation have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), solid-state 13C NMR and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. As a demonstration of a potential application, these anatase nanorods (NRs) have been used as a photoanode to fabricate a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) using a gel polymer electrolyte. Devices with efficiencies of 2.8% and 4.4% were recorded under light intensity of 100 mW/cm2 and 10 mW/cm2 illumination respectively.
Introduction
Over the past decade, one-dimensional (1D) functional nanostructures materials have generated a great deal of attention due to their improved potential applications over their bulk counterparts.1,2 Within the family of functional materials, semiconducting transition metal oxides represent a class of intriguing materials to study because of their novel properties and versatile technological applications. Among these, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an inexpensive and environmentally benign material that has been extensively used in a wide range of applications such as catalysis,3 support for catalysis,4 gas sensor,5,6 solar cells,7,8 photochemical degradation of organic pollutants,9 white pigments for paints and cosmetics10 and in bone implants.11–13 It has been well established that the effectiveness of titanium dioxide for all the above mentioned ensuing applications depends on its crystal phase, particle size and crystallinity. Among the common crystalline forms of titania, anatase is perceived as the more active phase of TiO2 because of its superior surface chemistry, more open framework, and better electron diffusion, which leads to an enhancement in transport efficiency and higher band-gap (3.2 eV as compared to 3.02 eV in the case of the rutile form of titania).14–17
Following a comprehensive survey of all the preparations currently cited in literature for the synthesis of 1D structures of titanium dioxide, it is apparent that all the methods fall into three broad categories (note that only 1D structures have been considered where the diameter has been reported to be less than 100 nm and the length is on the order of microns): (1) anodization of titanium (foil or wires),18–21 (2) electro-deposition or solution precipitation inside the pores of anodic alumina membranes,22,23 and (3) hydrothermal synthesis involving a variety of precursors (TiCl4, TiCl3, titanium foil, Na2Ti3O7, etc.), which are then employed in either severely acidic or basic conditions to yield a growth of short rods in the temperature range of 100–270 °C over a period of days.24,25 It should be noted that the composition of the resulting wires prepared by the hydrothermal method has been under some debate and the current opinion is that they are in fact composed of layered titanates (H2Ti3O7·xH2O, NaxH2−xTi3O7, H2Ti4O9·H2O, H2Ti2O4(OH)2) or a TiO2B phase rather than anatase or rutile phase of TiO2.26–28 Other than these three preparations, one route that has been extensively tried but has failed to provide structures that contain a large 1D characteristic is the templating route using a wet chemical approach. Thus far only two reports have cited successful large scale synthesis of TiO2 nanorods using this methodology and both have used oleic acid as a surfactant additive.29,30 This has been shown to give nanorods that are about 2–3 nm wide and only about 40 nm long.
Although the aforementioned approaches are useful for fabricating 1D TiO2 nanostructures, there are respective advantages and limitations for each of these methods; the main disadvantage being the use of extreme pH conditions for the hydrothermal route. The presence of the high concentration of base or acid prevents stoichiometric TiO2 from forming and instead a variety of layered titanates were formed. In addition, for the other methods mentioned above, it is clear that adapting them for large scale preparation is non-trivial as expensive equipment and multi-step preparations are involved. Moreover, in following any synthesis route, inevitably, all chemical methods rely primarily on commercially available precursors such as titanium sulfates, titanium tetrahalides or titanium alkoxides. However, there is one large disadvantage to these reagents, in that they are highly moisture sensitive. Owing to this rapid reactivity, it becomes extremely difficult to control the rates of hydrolysis and condensation reactions which eventually lead to the formation of polydispersed TiO2 structures. Hence, it still remains a major challenge to develop a more facile and simple method which can offer an impressive level of control in terms of size, shape, monodispersity, purity, chemical composition and crystallinity of the product. A simple way to overcome the problem is to perform the synthesis in non-aqueous solvent which in turn also slows the reactivity of metal precursors considerably, leading to better control over the condensing product.
Furthermore, after the pioneering discovery by Grätzel in 1991,7 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received much attention over the years as a low-cost and environmentally clean alternative energy resource. These cells contain a wide band gap semiconductor photoanode, a sensitizer which is essentially a dye deposited on the semiconductor, and an electrolyte as three of its basic components. Wide band gap semiconductors such as TiO2, SnO2 and ZnO films are generally used as a photoanode on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and the cathode consists of a conducting glass which is usually coated with platinum (Pt) or carbon (C) as catalyst. The dye is often a metal–organic complex (polypyridyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium are very common sensitizers being used in DSSCs). In terms of stability, longevity and practical applications, the use of liquid electrolyte in DSSCs still remains a drawback as these cells demand perfect sealing in order to avoid leakage and evaporation of the solvent. Therefore to achieve the improved stability, many researchers have been focusing their efforts on alternatives to replace the liquid electrolytes, such as (i) inorganic or organic hole conductors,31 (ii) ionic liquid based electrolytes,32,33 (c) polymer and gel electrolytes,34etc.
Herein we demonstrate a new facile route for the synthesis of a unique and novel intermediate precursor, titanium glycerolate in the presence of glycerol. This method is economic, simple and a one step procedure. Also, in our new process, only two reagents are necessary for the formation of the anatase phase of TiO2: titanium butoxide and glycerol. The synthesis and characterization of the intermediate titanium glycerolate and its subsequent conversion to the anatase form of titania are presented in detail. To the best of our knowledge, this report represents the first of its kind and demonstrates the large scale synthesis of TiO2 by exploiting the dual role of glycerol as ligand and solvent. In addition, these anatase nanorods (NRs) have been used in the preparation of a working electrode for quasi-solid-state DSSCs where the electrolyte is a polymer based gel.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Titanium(IV) butoxide (97%, Aldrich) and glycerol (99%, Merck-India) were used as the starting materials for synthesis. Poly(ethylene oxide-co-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl glycidyl ether) P(EO-EMG) (Daiso Co. Japan), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), LiI and I2 (Aldrich) were used to prepare the gel polymer electrolyte. The dye tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanate)bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylate)-ruthenium(II) (N719) was obtained from Solaronix. All reagents were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of anatase nanorods (NRs)
In a typical procedure, 0.4 mL of titanium n-butoxide (Ti(OC4H9)4) was added to 40 mL of glycerol in a 100 mL round-bottom flask attached to a condenser, which was connected to a CaCl2 guard tube to minimize the exposure to moisture. The solution was then heated to 190 °C under N2 atmosphere for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature (RT), the resulting white precipitate was collected using centrifugation, washed with ethanol and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. This product was calcined to 500 °C in air at the rate of 1 °C/min and maintained at 500 °C for 1 h.
Anatase NR based DSSC assembly
DSSC was assembled by using glass-FTO (F-doped SnO2, Rs ≤10 Ω/□) and glass-ITO (In-doped SnO2, Rs ≤10 Ω/□) as working and counter electrode respectively. Thin Pt film was coated by deposition of a drop of 0.05 mol/L solution of H2PtCl6 in isopropanol onto the ITO followed by firing at 400 °C in air for 20 min. A homogeneous titania NR slurry containing 120.0 mg of anatase NRs, 48.2 mg of polyethylene glycol (PEG 20000), 4 μL acetyl acetone, 1.0 μL triton X-100, and 200 μL deionised water, was obtained by grinding for 1 h in a mortar-pestle. The semiconductor film was prepared using the doctor blade technique by spreading a small aliquot of this anatase paste using a glass rod onto the glass-FTO, followed by annealing to 350 °C from RT for 10 min at a rate of 10 °C/min and then up to 450 °C in the same manner and finally cooling to RT to ensure the electrical contact between the NRs and the conducting substrate. The dye adsorption was carried out by immersion of glass-FTO/TiO2 electrode in 1.5 × 10−4 M ethanolic solution of tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanate)bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylate)-ruthenium(II) (N719) for 18 h. The sensitized working electrode was again immersed in fresh ethanol for 1–2 h to remove the unabsorbed dye and allowed to dry in air. The gel polymer electrolyte consisting of 0.3 g P(EO-EMG) copolymer, 0.7 g GBL, 0.2 g LiI, and 0.02 g I2 was prepared by dissolving in acetone. Then, ca. 100 μL of this solution was drop-cast in steps over the sensitized TiO2 electrode, which had been previously placed on a hot plate at 60 °C to remove acetone and then pressed against the Pt-coated TCO counter electrode. A thin film of PVC was placed in between the two electrodes to avoid short-circuiting of the cell. A clamp was fixed externally to maintain the mechanical integrity of the cell without any further sealing, which finalized the assembly of the DSSC.
Characterization
Room temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected from powder samples using a PANalytical X'pertpro MPD diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer with a Vantec detector, using Cu Kα1 radiation and an Anton Paar HTK1200 high-temperature attachment. Data were collected every 20 degrees between room temperature and 580 °C, over a 2θ range of 10 to 80° in 0.017° steps with a data collection time of 0.5 s per step, resulting in an overall measurement time of about 40 min per pattern. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a JEOL JSM-840 and high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) images were taken using a ZEISS Ultra 55 plus FESEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured on a ZEISS, LIBRA-120 machine operated at 120 kV. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-4100 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a NETZSCH, STA 409 PC analyzer with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under a flow of N2 gas. Solid state cross-polarization/magic angle spinning 13C-NMR spectrum was taken using a 500 MHz BRUKER spectrometer. The BET surface area of the sample was measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Analyzer. Prior to N2 physisorption data collection, the samples were degassed at 100 °C under vacuum for 6 h. The DSSC were characterized under irradiation of an Oriel Xe (Hg) 250 W lamp with an AM 1.5 filter, used to simulate the solar spectrum. The light intensity was adjusted using a Newport Optical Power Meter. Current–potential curves (I–V curves) were obtained using linear sweep voltammetry at 1 mV/s using an Eco Chimie-Autolab PGSTAT 10 potentiostat. The film thicknesses were measured with an Alpha-Step profilometer.
Results and discussion
The powder diffraction pattern of the as-synthesized titanium-glycerol complex precursor is shown in Fig. 1. A survey of crystallographic databases did not identify a composition which could be matched to this pattern, suggesting the formation of a new material. This pattern could be indexed to a monoclinic unit cell with a = 8.37515 Å, b = 15.33781 Å, c = 5.57151 Å, β = 99.824° in space group P2/c. The Pawley fit obtained using this cell and space group is given in electronic supplementary information (ESI, Fig. S1†). In situ variable temperature PXRD data are shown in Fig. 2. The evolution of the powder patterns shows that the titanium glycerolate complex precursor maintains its crystallinity up to about 240 °C. Beyond this temperature, an amorphous phase exists until about 350 °C, when new Bragg peaks start appearing. With increasing temperature, these peaks become sharper and more intense, indicating increased crystallinity of the product. This product can be identified as the pure anatase form of TiO2, as shown by the Rietveld fit, JCPDS File No. 04-006-9240, see Fig. 1 and ESI (Fig. S2†), respectively.

The compositional and structural changes associated with the calcination process were also followed using TGA and FTIR spectroscopy. Fig. 3a shows a typical TGA and its first order differential (DTG) curves. The TGA curve shows only a single-step pattern for weight loss as a function of the temperature. The weight loss (∼45.4%) in the temperature range 25–600 °C was attributed to the removal of ligated glycerol moiety (DTG peak at 349 °C), in agreement with the formation of anatase observed in this temperature region by in situ variable temperature PXRD. It is worth noting that there is no loss due to physisorbed water (as shown in the TGA curve of Fig. 3a) and this suggests higher air stability of the sample unlike other TiO2 precursors (the temporal stability of the precursor, under ambient conditions, was found to be robust to at least one month after synthesis as affirmed by characterising the precursor with TEM, SEM, TGA and FTIR). Moreover, it should be noted that the pure glycerol gives a sharp and single DTG peak at ca. 307 °C, see ESI (Fig. S3†). This suggests the following facts: (a) glycerol is coordinated to titanium such that its decomposition temperature is dramatically increased, and (b) from weight loss calculations, an empirical ratio of 3:2 can be determined for titanium to glycerol.

FTIR studies (Fig. 3b) of the as-synthesized titanium glycerolate displayed peaks at 1038 and 1113 cm−1 which were assigned to the stretching mode of alcoholic C–O. Bands were also observed at 1440 and 1645 cm−1, which were attributed to the O–H bending mode. A peak in the region 3000–3650 cm−1 was found to be broadened and it was due to physically adsorbed water and glycerol O–H stretching mode, and any hydrogen bonding between these groups can lead to the broadening of the peak. Apart from these peaks, a peak at 611 cm−1 was apparent and was assigned to the Ti–O stretching mode. Upon calcination of titanium glycerolate to the anatase phase of TiO2, the bands corresponding to O–H and C–H eventually disappeared, whereas the Ti–O stretching band was still prevalent, but was shifted and broadened. This also corroborated with the fact that the organic moiety was completely removed by heat treatment which is also well supported by VT XRD and TGA analysis as described above.
In order to get some insight into the environments of glycerol units, a solid state CP/MAS 13C NMR spectrum was obtained on the titanium glycerolate sample, Fig. 4a. Three major peaks at 85.1, 81.0 and 74.4 ppm and equal number of minor peaks at 87.8, 78.2 and 69.5 ppm were observed. Since, all these peaks were observed at lower field with respect to the standard peak of pure glycerol (Fig. 4b), this clearly suggested a more deshielded environment of carbon due to the co-ordination of glycerol to the Ti centre. Glycerol (uncoordinated) has a symmetric structure and as such only two chemical shifts are observed for the pure liquid (one at 62.1 ppm is due to the 2 terminal primary carbons and the peak at 71.6 ppm is due to the central, tertiary carbon). Upon complexation, NMR data shows that now glycerol is no longer in a symmetric state, and in fact all the three carbons are in an un-equivalent electronic environment. However since we observe six peaks in the solid state NMR spectrum, we believe there are two different types of electronic environments for the complex (i.e. for instance if the structure were fully crystalline, there would be two glycerolate ligands in a single asymmetric unit cell). From the TGA result, a ratio of 3:2 was provided between Ti and the organic moiety. Hence we can hypothesize that these two distinct glycerol moieties are interacting with three titanium centres.

In order to evaluate the structural evolution in morphology of the obtained samples before and after calcination, SEM, HRSEM and TEM measurements were performed, and the data are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the as-synthesized titanium glycerolate complex has a fibre-like structure. The length of the fibers is on the micrometer scale and the diameters are 65.1 ± 21.3 nm. A closer look at the structures reveals the smooth surface appearance. Fig. 5d–f show the SEM and TEM images of the anatase phase of TiO2. These images confirm that the rod-like morphology was essentially conserved during the annealing process, however, it can be seen that the surface is now significantly roughened. The dimensions of the anatase rods were several microns in length and 52.2 ± 13.1 nm in width. Obviously, in going from titanium glycerolate to the anatase phase, the mean value of the width marginally decreases and this can be attributed to the loss of ligated ligands as well as the phase transformation to anatase crystallites at higher annealing temperature.

The specific surface area of the fibrous titanium glycerolate and its subsequent anatase phase was determined by the BET method35,36 and were found to be 79.5 and 86.3 m2/g respectively. Their respective nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms are shown in ESI (Fig. S4†). The pore size distribution of the samples was determined by the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) desorption analysis37 and found with maxima at ∼48.5 nm for both the cases.
In terms of elucidating a mechanism of formation, it has been shown by several groups that strong complexing agents can be used to control the rates of hydrolysis and condensation for formation of transition metal oxides.38–40 Ethylene glycol as such has been a well-researched chelator, and it has been purported to form chain-like complexes with Ti(IV).41,42 Hence, it is easily conceivable that in the methodology presented here, glycerol, containing three hydroxyl groups, also acts as a tridentate chelating ligand promoting chain-like growth. The empirical ratio obtained by TGA and corroborated by NMR shows that for each glycerol unit, two out of the three hydroxyl groups are complexed with a single titanium centre.
Use in DSSCs
The performance of the DSSC was evaluated by forming devices where a thin film of the anatase NRs was coated on a FTO substrate. The SEM images were taken on the anatase TiO2 NRs film formed on the glass-FTO substrate after annealing at 450 °C, Fig. 6. The NR morphology can be seen from the image and they are randomly oriented on the substrate. Moreover, highly porous nanostructure can be observed from the micrograph and the thickness of the film was found to be ca. 30 μm. The current–potential curves (I–V curves) under illumination with different light intensities are shown in Fig. 7. Under the light intensity of 10 mW/cm2 illumination, the photovoltaic parameters measured were: short circuit current, ISC = 1.3 mA/cm2; open circuit voltage, VOC = 0.54 V; fill factor, FF = 0.52; and the overall solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency, η = 4.4%. When the light intensity was increased from 10 to 100 mW/cm2, ISC changes drastically to 8.6 from 1.3 mA/cm2 whereas VOC increased slightly from 0.54 to 0.63 V. In contrast to this, the values of FF and the overall efficiency of the cell (η) decreased as the light intensity was increased and it is apparent that the energy conversion efficiency of the cell is reduced to 2.8% at full solar illumination as compared to 4.4% at 10 mW/cm2.

It should be noted that we have observed that the photocurrent is inferior when comparing with the solar cell that was fabricated with a 10 μm TiO2 nanoparticulate film with the same gel electrolyte.43 In order to address the reason for the low photocurrent, we measured the dye loading for the films. The measured amount of dye was practically the same: 1.11 × 10−7 and 9.45 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for the spherical nanoparticle film and for the 30 μm nanorod film, respectively. These values are also comparable with the literature for a 10 μm thick nanoporous TiO2 photoanode with N3 dye (η = 10%).44 IPCE can be expressed by the product of three key parameters: LHE is the light harvesting term, ϕ is the electron injection yield and η is the electron collecting efficiency in the external circuit. Since the dye loading measured was comparable to that of the 10 μm thick nanoporous TiO2 photoanode, thus, in terms of LHE, we expect the same contribution from both films. The same applies for the electron injection. This leads us to consider “η” as the limiting parameter. We believe that the possible explanation for the low photocurrent relies on the contact between the TiO2 nanorod film and the FTO glass. We noticed visually that the films had poor adhesion with the transparent electrode, and this can affect drastically the collection efficiency at the electrodes. We also cannot neglect the low permeability of the gel electrolyte within the 30 μm TiO2 nanorod film. It is possible that the polymer gel electrolyte did not wet the inner layers of the TiO2 film. Besides, in this investigation we did not employ the vacuum deposition method normally used in our laboratory because of this adhesion problem. Both factors can explain the non-linearity observed for the photocurrent values from 10 to 100 mW/cm2 and the limit of ca. 8 mA/cm2. More detailed work is needed to compare directly the effect of these 1D nanostructures over the spherical nanoparticles (3D) films in terms of fast electronic transport. However, considering the fact that the device is unsealed, the quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell prototype shows a highly promising result, however, further improvements in device performance are expected with more controlled film preparation.
Conclusion
In summary, a facile synthesis of an air stable fiber-like titanium glycerolate precursor has been demonstrated using glycerol as both a solvent and a chelating agent. By calcining at elevated temperature in air, this glycerolate precursor was converted into the anatase phase of TiO2 without changing its original morphology. We believe that this simple environmentally friendly two-step approach without the use of any catalysts, templates, bases, acids and requiring non-expensive and elusive equipment, will offer the possibility of adapting a versatile protocol to many other relevant functional metal oxides (binary or ternary) over a wide range of compositions and particle morphologies. In addition, the synthesized anatase NRs were successfully used as an electron transport component in a quasi-solid-state DSSC. An overall solar to electrical conversion efficiency of 2.8% was achieved under light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and it increases to 4.4% at 10 mW cm−2. Considering the fact that the device is unsealed, the quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell prototype shows a highly promising result, however, further improvements in device performance are expected with more controlled film preparation.
