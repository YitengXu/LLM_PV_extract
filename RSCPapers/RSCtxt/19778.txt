    AbstractHierarchical anatase TiO2 porous nanopillars with high crystallinity and stability were fabricated by the following four steps: (i) synthesis of a titanium glycolate nanopillar precursor; (ii) transformation into stable nanopillars consisting of amorphous TiO2 primary nanoparticles at low temperature; (iii) treatment with ethylenediamine aqueous solution to protect the nanopillar structure, restrain nanoparticle growth and retard phase transformation; (iv) calcination at temperatures as high as 700 °C to form hierarchical anatase TiO2 porous nanopillars. The results of SEM, TEM and XRD reveal that these TiO2 nanopillars have a porous structure, and that their length can be easily controlled by the volume ratio of ethylene glycol to tetrabutyl titanate. In addition, dye-sensitized solar-cells (DSSCs) were assembled with sandwich-structure photoanodes, which are composed of a layer of TiO2 nanopillars sandwiched between two layers of TiO2 nanoparticles. The photoelectrical measurement results show that the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs enhances with the increase of nanopillar length and crystallinity. This is attributed to the effective transfer of photogenerated electrons in TiO2 nanopillars and their porous microstructures in favor of dye adsorption, as demonstrated by surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
1. Introduction
The worldwide demand for energy is expected to triple by the end of this century.1 However, fossil fuels are limited and are a nonrenewable resource, while the production of oil, which is a major energy source, will soon fail to keep up with increasing demand. Moreover, the combustion of fossil fuels has been proved to produce widespread environmental damage, such as global warming.2–5 Therefore, the development of new clean energy to meet growing social demands has become one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time.
Light from the sun has been proposed to be an ideal source of energy,6 and while solar energy is the largest source of clean energy, and readily available, current technologies cannot utilize solar energy effectively. Therefore, the goal of low-cost and efficient conversion of solar energy into electricity is remains scientifically attractive.7,8
Nanocrystalline dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) provide an economically clean method of efficient solar energy conversion. They have attracted considerable attention during the past decade, due to their low production cost and high energy conversion efficiency.9–13 Generally, DSSCs are composed of a nanocrystalline semiconductor oxide thin-film electrode, dye sensitizers, electrolytes, and a counter electrode.14 Typically, dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 films are used as a photoanode, platinized conductive glass as the counter electrode, and I3−/I− in an organic solvent as the electrolyte solution. Under sunlight, ultrafast electron injection from a photo-excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2 photoanode occurs, and subsequently the excited dye is regenerated by electron donation from the electrolyte, usually the I3−/I− redox system in an organic solvent. The iodide is regenerated, in turn, by reduction of triiodide at the counter electrode, and the circuit is completed through the external load.15,16 Along with these processes, electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 may also recombine with the oxidized dye sensitizers or electron acceptors in the electrolyte solution, and this is one of the main factors influencing the efficiency. As a result, the efficiency of solar energy conversion is not high enough to satisfy practical applications.
Several strategies have been considered to optimize the components of the DSSCs in order to increase the overall power conversion efficiency, such as enhancing the light-harvesting capacity of the dye, speeding up the transport of electrons in the photoanode, improving the packaging technology, etc.17,18 Photoanodes that transfer photogenerated electrons have therefore been considered as one of the main factors determining the efficiency of DSSCs.19 Some efforts have been devoted to the improvement of the photoanode. One strategy was to change the structure of TiO2 (using bead-like TiO2, mesoporous TiO2, etc.20–22), and by this means the performance of DSSCs was improved. However, electrons can easily recombine at the grain boundary of TiO2 nanoparticles during the transportation process, because photogenerated electrons repeatedly interact with the ‘traps’ as they undergo a random walk through the nanoparticle film.
Another promising strategy was to increase the electron diffusion length in the photoanode by replacing the nanoparticle films with one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials (e.g. nanowires, nanotubes and nanorods23–25). Electron transport in 1D nanomaterials was expected to be several orders of magnitude faster than percolation through a random nanoparticle network,7 so increasing the efficiency of DSSCs. Unfortunately, compared to nanoparticle films (roughness factors >1000), these 1D nanomaterials usually had smooth surfaces and low surface areas (in particular, they lacked roughness (<200)), limiting the photocurrent density significantly and thus also limiting the overall power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs.7,26
In order to further improve the performance of DSSCs, Grätzel et al. fabricated a new photoanode, composed of a ∼12 μm thick transparent film of TiO2 nanoparticles (10–20 nm diameter) covered with a ∼4 μm thick film of much larger particles (about 400 nm in diameter) that scattered photons back into the transparent film, in order to improve the efficiency, and this resulted in a remarkable improvement.27 In addition, Tan et al. took the mixture of TiO2 nanoparticles and nanowires as photoanode, and the performance of DSSCs was much improved.28 However, conventional 1D TiO2 nanomaterials, with their characteristic smooth surface and absence of pores, led to low surface area and subsequently low dye adsorption.
Although 1D TiO2 materials with pores (comprising TiO2 nanoparticles) have been obtained, they have low crystallinity.29 Improving the crystallinity of TiO2 requires increasing the calcination temperature, which usually results in the phase transformation from anatase to rutile,30 the growth and accumulation of TiO2 nanoparticles, and pore collapse. Fortunately, a post-treatment method with ethylenediamine (EN) resulting in stable porous TiO2 nanoparticles with high crystallinity, small particle size and large surface area was reported,31 and offers a good means of stabilizing the hierarchical structure of the 1D TiO2 material, including restraining the growth of particles, retarding the phase transformation, and stabilizing the porous structure. Therefore, the design of 1D hierarchical anatase TiO2 porous nanomaterials with high crystallinity and porous structure should further enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes, and increase the dye adsorption.
On the basis of the above consideration, in order to further improve the performance of DSSCs, in this paper we design and synthesize novel stable hierarchical anatase TiO2 porous nanopillars with high crystallinity and stability. The TiO2 porous nanopillar was synthesized by the following steps: (i) formation of a titanium glycolate nanopillar; (ii) low temperature post-treatment to form stable nanopillars consisting of amorphous TiO2 primary nanoparticles; (iii) post-treatment with EN to protect the nanopillar structure, restrain nanoparticle growth and retard phase transformation; and (iv) high-temperature calcination at 700 °C to form hierarchical anatase TiO2 porous nanopillars. On the one hand, these novel TiO2 nanopillars, which possess a rough surface and porous nanopillar structure, should increase the adsorption of dye compared to conventional 1D nanomaterials. On the other hand, they have high crystallinity and are composed of many TiO2 nanoparticles interconnected with each other in a compact arrangement, which should offer an effective transportation channel for photogenerated electrons. Therefore, the performance of DSSCs could be further improved by the use of these hierarchical anatase TiO2 porous nanopillars. To test these ideas, DSSCs were assembled with the sandwich-structure photoanode, composed of a layer of TiO2 nanopillars sandwiched between two layers of TiO2 nanoparticles. The use of the TiO2 nanopillars enhanced the efficiency of the DSSC from 7.20 to 8.19%, attributed to the synergistic effect of the long 1D pillar-like porous structure, high crystallinity and unique microstructure, which provides benefits to the separation and transportation of photogenerated electrons.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of hierarchical TiO2 porous nanopillars
A typical synthesis of hierarchical TiO2 porous nanopillars with different lengths is as follows. The length of the TiO2 nanopillars was controlled by the amount of ethylene glycol (EG) – the larger the amount of EG, the longer the TiO2 nanopillars (denoted S (short), M (medium), and L (long), respectively). Different amounts of EG (20, 40, and 60 mL) were heated to 175 °C in an oil bath, followed by the slow dropwise addition of 1 mL tetrabutyl titanate (TBT). A white precipitate was observed, and this mixture was then heated to 180 °C for 1 h, with magnetic stirring being applied throughout. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was washed several times with ethanol, and the precursors with different lengthswere dried at 40 °C for 12 h in a vacuum.
Three different treatment procedures were then used to treat these precursors to obtain TiO2 porous nanopillars with different crystallinity. (i) The three precursors were directly calcined at 450 or 700 °C (ramp of 1 °C min−1) for 2 h in air, to give products denoted S-450, M-450, L-450, and S-700, M-700, L-700, respectively. (ii) The three precursors were calcined at 300 °C for 2 h to form amorphous stable TiO2 nanopillars. (iii) 1 g of the precursor was dispersed in 30 mL distilled water, and ethylenediamine (EN) – which plays the role of protecting the porous microstructure and suppressing the phase transformation – was added dropwise to the solution until the pH was about 10–11. The solution was then refluxed at 90 °C for 36 h. After being washed to achieve neutrality, it was dried at 40 °C for 12 h. Finally, the three products, denoted S-EN-700, M-EN-700 and L-EN-700, respectively, were calcined at 700 °C for 2 h in air.
2.2 Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by a Rigaku D/max-IIIB diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were taken using a Hitachi S-4800 instrument operating at 15 kV. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiment was performed on a JEM-3010 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. Carbon-coated copper grids were used as the sample holders. The surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) measurement was carried out with a home-built apparatus described elsewhere.32 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with a computer-controlled IM6e impedance measurement unit (Zahner Elektrik, Germany). EIS was obtained by applying sinusoidal perturbations of 10 mV over the Voc at the frequency range from 0.05 to 100 kHz. All EIS measurements were carried out under illumination at 10 mW cm−2 or 100 mW cm−2.
2.3 Fabrication of sandwich-structure photoanode, and photoelectrochemical measurements
FTO (F-doped SnO2 layer, sheet resistance 20 Ω per square) was soaked for 30 min at 70 °C in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution to obtain a compact layer.33 TiO2 paste was obtained by mixing 2 mL of ethanol and 680 mg of TiO2 (Degussa P25 or TiO2 nanopillars) to homogeneity. The longer FTO edges were covered with transparent adhesive tape as a spacer to control the film thickness, and 0.1 mL paste was spread over the surface. The sandwich-structure photoanode consisting of three layer thin films was prepared according to the following process. The first and third layer of the TiO2 (P25) was prepared by a doctor-blade method on the FTO substrate and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min.34 The second layer (middle layer) with the TiO2 nanopillars of different crystallinity and lengths was also obtained by the doctor-blade method on the second layer. Finally, the sandwich-structure electrodes were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. In addition, as a control, an electrode with a two-layer TiO2 thin film was also prepared. The thicknesses of all electrodes measured by the SEM analysis were estimated to be around 15 μm.
The films were immersed in a 0.5 mM ((C4H9)4N)2[Ru-(4-carboxy-4′-carboxylate-2,2′bipyridine)2(NCS)2] dye (N719, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in acetonitrile and tert-butanol (volume ratio, 1:1) for 12 h at room temperature. Platinum counter electrodes were fabricated following the literature.35 The Ru complex dye-sensitized film electrodes and the Pt counter electrode were fixed together with epoxy resin. The electrolyte, which comprised 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazodium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (3-MPN), was admitted by capillary action. Photocurrent–photovoltage curves were recorded by a BAS100B Electrochemical Analyzer. A 400 W xenon lamp with a UV filter was used as a light source, with an intensity of about 40 mW cm−2. A mask with an aperture was placed on the cell, giving an effective irradiation area of the working electrode of about 0.12 cm2. The dye-sensitized photoelectrodes were desorbed in a 0.02 M NaOH solution in EtOH and H2O (volume ratio, 1:1) for 6 h to measure the adsorption dye amount.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology of the hierarchical porous TiO2 nanopillars
1D nanostructures are usually fabricated through the use of anisotropy in crystal structure as the confinement.36 However, such approaches have limitations for the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, which must crystallise in a highly anisotropic conformation. Here, we demonstrate a modified precursor route to synthesize TiO2 porous nanopillars with different lengths, which form a chain-like composite by refluxing TBT in EG.37 The modification included changing the volume ratio of EG to TBT, and increasing the reaction temperature, followed by EN treatment. Scheme 1 displays the formation of the TiO2 nanopillars with controlled lengths and porous microstructure. First of all, precursors with different lengths can be easily obtained by controlling the volume ratio of EG to TBT. After calcination at low temperature, these precursors are treated by EN, which plays an important role in protecting the microstructure and suppressing the phase transformation. Finally, after being calcined at high temperature, TiO2 porous nanopillars with high crystallinity are formed.

Electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction were used to characterize the change in crystallinity, morphology and microstructure associated with calcination of the TiO2 nanopillars. Fig. 1(A)–(C) show SEM images of these precursors with different lengths. We can see that the precursors are pillar-like and uniform. It is interesting to note that the lengths of the precursors are strongly dependent on the volume ratio of EG/TBT – when the ratio is low (20:1), the precursor is about 5 μm in length. When the ratio is increased to 60:1 (or more), precursors up to 50 μm long were obtained. Xia et al. found that EG could serve as a ligand to form chain-like coordination complexes with Ti(IV) cations upon heating.37 The glycolate complexes were resistant to hydrolysis, and could be kept in air for a long time without any precipitate in the solution being observed, which is different from the case with metal alkoxides.37 When the chain-like complexes were sufficiently long, they precipitated out from the reaction medium in the form of uniform nanopillars.
Typical XRD patterns of our obtained precursors are shown in Fig. S1†– these are very similar to previous reports.37,38 They exhibit a striking similarity in the presence of diffraction peaks, which could be attributed to similar packing for the linear building blocks associated with these precursors. This further confirms that chain-like complexes are formed through this approach.

After being calcined at 450 °C for 2 h, SEM images were taken (Fig. 1D–F). From these SEM images, we can confirm that the pillar-like morphology is preserved perfectly during the calcination process. The lengths of the TiO2 nanopillars are from about 40–50 μm for L-450 (Fig. 1D) to several μm for S-450 (Fig. 1F). Fig. 1G–I shows the SEM images of the TiO2 nanopillars after post-treatment by EN and calcination at 700 °C for 2 h. The morphology of these TiO2 nanopillars is also conserved very well, illustrating that our TiO2 nanopillars are very stable. Similar results are also observed for the TiO2 nanopillars after being calcined at 700 °C (Fig. S2†). In order to investigate their microstructure, magnified SEM images were taken (Fig. S3†), and the surface of the long precursor is seen to be very smooth from (Fig. S3A). After being calcined at different temperatures, the microstructure clearly changes; the surface of L-EN-700 is rougher than that of L-450 and the long precursor, which can be attributed to the efficient wrapping of the TiO2 particles by EN. This implies that large surface areas can be obtained, which could increase the adsorption of dye. However, without EN post-treatment, the TiO2 nanoparticles aggregated into large particles, which decrease their surface area (Fig. S3D).
In order to investigate the microstructure of the TiO2 nanopillars, TEM characterization was performed. Fig. 2 shows typical TEM and HRTEM images of L-450 and L-EN-700. Based on these TEM images, the diameters of the TiO2 nanopillars are uniform, with an average value of several hundred nanometers. It is also found that some of the TiO2 nanopillars might have aggregated into bundles, thus appearing thicker than expected from the SEM observation (about 1 μm, Fig. 1). In the magnified TEM images, their microstructure can be observed clearly – Fig. 2B shows the TEM image of L-450. Under these experimental conditions, the TiO2 nanopillars are composed of large TiO2 particles and possess few pores. In contrast, the TiO2 nanopillars after EN treatment are composed of many tiny compact TiO2 nanoparticles (about 10 nm) with a porous structure (Fig. 2E). This implies that EN treatment restrains the growth and aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles sufficiently and preserves the porous structure of the TiO2 nanopillars. From Fig. 2C and F, the lattice fringes corresponding to the (101) crystallographic plane (d101 = 0.35 nm) of anatase are clearly observed. This confirms that L-450 and L-EN-700 are pure anatase phases. Not having EN post-treatment, the sample L-700 comprises large TiO2 particles with few pores. The lattice fringes corresponding to the (110) crystallographic plane (d110 = 0.325 nm) of rutile are clear from the HRTEM image and its corresponding Fourier transforms (Fig. S4†). Thus, we believe that EN indeed suppresses the phase transformation from anatase to rutile and preserves their porous microstructure.

The crystallinity of TiO2 plays an important role for improving the performance of DSSCs. Thus, XRD measurements were performed in order to characterize the crystallinity of these TiO2 nanopillars. Fig. 3 shows the typical XRD patterns of TiO2 nanopillars with different lengths after being calcined at 450 °C and post-treated with EN at 700 °C, respectively. They clearly show the presence of five Bragg diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.2–62.7°, indexed as (101), (004), (200), (105) and (211), respectively, with a pattern typical of anatase (JCPDS, No. 21-1272). It is interesting to note that samples after EN post-treatment at 700 °C still have a pure anatase structure, which is consistent with TEM results. This implies that EN suppresses the phase transformation from anatase to rutile effectively. Furthermore, the crystallinity increases with increasing calcination temperature. However, the TiO2 nanopillars without EN post-treatment after calcination at 700 °C have five high-intensity Bragg diffraction peaks at 2θ = 27.4–56.6°, indexed as (110), (101), (111), (211) and (220), respectively, with a pattern typical of pure rutile (JCPDS No. 21-1276) (Fig. S5†). This proves that EN treatment enhances the crystallization of anatase, inhibits undesirable grain growth and retards the transformation of anatase to rutile.

3.2 Photoelectrochemical property
In order to improve the performance of DSSCs, the photoanode must possess an extremely large surface area so that the dye can be sufficiently adsorbed, resulting in the generation of a high photocurrent. Furthermore, this material must decrease transfer resistance for the rapid transport of photogenerated electrons. Sandwich-structure photoanodes with a central composite layer of wire-like TiO2/β-cyclodextrin/multi-walled carbon nanotubes has been designed, and improvements in efficiency obtained.39 In this study, we utilize this sandwich-structure electrode to satisfy the requirements mentioned above. The structure of our photoanode is shown in Scheme 2. Our TiO2 nanopillars are sandwiched between two layers of TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles. These 1D TiO2 nanopillars not only link the two layers of TiO2 nanoparticles well, but also act in favor of the rapid transport of photogenerated electrons.
 Scheme 2  A diagram showing the sandwich-structure photoanode. 
The sandwich structure with TiO2 nanopillars can be observed clearly from the SEM images of Fig. 4. It is well-known that the performance of DSSCs depends on the film thickness to a large extent. In this study, the film thickness of all cells is similar (about 15 μm), so the influence of the film thickness is excluded. Therefore, compared to TiO2 nanoparticles or pure 1D TiO2 nanomaterials, this sandwich-structure photoanode can transport photogenerated electrons effectively, without lowering the loading of dye. Thus, we believe that the introduction of this special structure will improve the performance of DSSCs.

Fig. 5 shows typical photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs. The results displayed here are the average values obtained in the photovoltaic measurements for each of the five cells. The power conversion efficiency (η) is calculated by the following expression: η = FFIscVoc/Win, where FF is the fill factor (FF = Pmax/IscVoc), where Isc is the short-circuit photocurrent, Voc is the open-circuit photovoltage, and Pmax is the maximum deliverable power. From Fig. 5, a power conversion efficiency of 7.2% was obtained for the cell composed of TiO2 nanoparticles (P25) alone. The performance of the cells composed of the sandwich-structure photoanode is significantly better than that of TiO2 nanoparticles (Table 1), while the efficiency of L-450 is higher than that of S-450. In particular, L-EN-700 exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency (8.19%), which is about 14% higher than P25 nanoparticle on their own. This performance improvement may be related to the special structure of the 1D TiO2 nanopillars.
In order to further probe the beneficial aspect of the TiO2 nanopillars in DSSCs, we constructed photoelectrochemcial cells with P25 and L-EN-700, respectively (Fig. S6†). The magnitude of the photocurrent represents the improvement of the charge collection efficiency of the electrode surface. From Fig. S6 we can clearly see that both of them quickly generate a photocurrent with a reproducible response to on–off cycles. It should be noted that the cells with L-EN-700 exhibit higher photocurrent than those without TiO2 nanopillars. This further confirms that the introduction of the TiO2 nanopillars plays an important role in the enhancement of the power conversion efficiency for DSSCs. In summary, the efficiency of DSSCs is improved by increasing the TiO2 nanopillar length and improving the crystallinity.

It is worth noting that the microstructure of the TiO2 nanopillars may be an important factor in the high efficiency of the DSSCs. From the TEM characterization (Fig. 2), we can clearly see that the TiO2 nanopillars possess a porous structure and rough surface, which is advantageous for the adsorption of dye compared to conventional 1D nanomaterials. The molar concentration of dye loading for the sandwich-structure photoanodes composed of L-EN-700, L-450, M-450, S-450, L-700 and P25 was 1.14, 1.16, 1.15, 1.15, 1.10 and 1.22 × 10−5 mol L−1, respectively.40 Therefore, the dye loading of these sandwich-structure photoanodes is slightly lower than that of P25 nanoparticles, but the power conversion efficiency of the former is higher than that of the latter (Table 1). Therefore, the reason for the improved efficiency can be associated with the porous 1D pillar-like structure, with the dye loading not being the main factor. In addition, we can also see that the dye loading of L-EN-700 is slightly lower than that of L-450, but the efficiency of L-EN-700 is higher than that of L-450. Thus, we consider that the crystallinity could be another crucial factor for the improved efficiency. Moreover, it is composed of a compact arrangement of TiO2 nanoparticles, which is advantageous for electron transfer. Therefore, these hierarchical anatase TiO2 porous nanopillars favor photogenerated charge transfer and adsorption of dye, resulting in the enhanced power conversion efficiency in the DSSCs. Therefore, we believe that these nanopillars are a good choice for DSSCs.
From Fig. 5 we can clearly see that the efficiency of DSSCs increases with increasing TiO2 nanopillar length. Therefore, we believe that the longer the TiO2 nanopillar, the better the performance of DSSCs. In addition, the length plays a crucial role in the performance of the cells composed of these TiO2 nanopillars with a low-temperature treatment (e.g. 450 °C) from Fig. 5. In order to confirm this hypothesis, surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed. SPS is an approriate tool to investigate the photophysical processes of semiconductors, such as the charge separation capability, and semiconductor bandgaps.41,42Fig. 6 shows the SPS of P25 nanoparticles and the sandwich-structure photoanode with the TiO2 nanopillars. We can clearly see that all of the samples exhibit a SPS response at around 357 nm, which is attributed to electron transitions from the valence to conduction band (band-to-band transitions, O2p–Ti3d).43 From Fig. 6, the SPS response of L-450 is higher than that of S-450. This is attributed to the fact that the longer TiO2 nanopillars should transport the charge carriers a longer distance without undergoing significant loss. Moreover, it should be noted that the SPS onset response wavelength of the sandwich-structure photoanode for TiO2 nanopillars of medium length is 360 nm, compared to 357 nm for the P25 nanoparticles. Also, the L-EN-700 photoelectrode has the largest onset wavelength, which results in the narrowest bandgap, and thus the strongest photoelectron driving force. This stronger electron driving force may be one factor contributing to the photoelectron generation, which makes higher photocurrents possible. Moreover, the special 1D structure and high crystallinity could make an additional contribution to improving the efficiency of DSSCs, while the crystallinity of the TiO2 nanopillars could also have an impact on the efficiency of DSSCs to a certain extent, as the crystallinity improves with increasing calcination temperature.
From the photocurrent–voltage curves we can clearly see that the power conversion efficiency of L-EN-700 is higher than that of L-450. This confirms that the former (due to its high crystallinity) is better at transferring photogenerated electrons than the latter. As for samples treated at high temperature (700 °C), crystallinity is crucial to improve the efficiency of the DSSCs, with length playing a secondary role (Table 1). Furthermore, the SPS response increases with the increased crystallinity of TiO2 nanopillars, confirming that the separatation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes is more effective in our nanopillars. Therefore, we believe that the high crystallinity is advantageous for the separation and transportation of photogenerated charges, as confirmed by the SPS and EIS measurements.

EIS is a powerful method to investigate internal resistance that is attributed to the charge-transfer properties of DSSCs.44,45Fig. 7 shows the Nyquist plots of cells composed of P25 nanoparticles and the sandwich-structure photoanode with the TiO2 nanopillars under a light intensity of 10 mW cm−2. The direct current resistances under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 clearly decreased compared to that 10 mW cm−2 (as shown in Fig. S7†). The impedance at low frequency (0.05–1 Hz) corresponds to the Nernst diffusion of I3−/I− within the electrolyte. The impedance at high frequency (1–100 kHz) in the impedance spectra corresponded to the capacitance and charge-transfer resistance at the Pt|I3−/I− electrolyte interface. The medium-frequency response at 1–100 Hz was associated with the TiO2–dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface, where photoelectrons and redox shuttles are expected to accumulate. The equivalent circuit fitting the impedance spectra, Rs[C1(R1O1)] (R2CPE2), which was used for all the composite DSSCs, is shown in Fig. S8†. It can be clearly seen that the interfacial resistance of the TiO2–dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface of the P25 nanoparticle cell is much bigger than that of the others. In addition, the cell with L-EN-700 has the smallest interfacial resistance. Since there are no electrons passing through the external circuit under open-circuit conditions, the electrons injected into the oxide semiconductor must recombine with I3− ions at the TiO2–dye/electrolyte interface. The resistance of interfacial charge-transfer from the TiO2 to the I3− ions in the electrolyte decreased due to the increase of the electron concentration in the TiO2, but when the DSSCs are under working conditions, the conduction-band electrons of TiO2 can transfer through the out-circuit, and the electrons simultaneously transfer from the I3− ions in the electrolyte into the HOMO of the dye. When the concentration of electrons in the TiO2 increases, the electrons pass through the out-circuit faster, and the I3−/I− shuttle reduces the oxidized dye more quickly. That is, the TiO2–dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface charge transfer will increase under working conditions. These results are similar to those in the literature.46–48 The lower interface resistance should result in faster recombination by I3− ions at the TiO2–dye/electrolyte interface under open-circuit conditions, but under working conditions, when the concentration of electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 increases, the electrons pass through the out-circuit effectively, which is beneficial for high η. This is attributed to the anatase phase structure and high crystallinity of the long TiO2 nanopillar, which favors transfer of photogenerated charges, thus lowering the charge recombination, in good agreement with the SPS results. On the basis of the above analysis, we can conclude that our obtained hierarchical anatase TiO2 porous nanopillars are one of the best choices of photoelectrode for DSSCs. The improved power conversion efficiency can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the long 1D pillar-like structure, high crystallinity and porous microstructure.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated hierarchical anatase TiO2 porous nanopillars with high crystallinity and stability by a precursor route and an ethylenediamine (EN) treatment procedure. Our obtained TiO2 nanopillars were uniform, and the lengths could be controlled easily by changing the volume ratio of EG to TBT. The analytical results revealed that EN treatment suppressed the growth and accumulation of TiO2 nanoparticles, retarded the transformation of anatase to rutile and protected the porous structure. The simple EN post-treatment method provides a new means of obtaining TiO2 materials with high crystallinity and stability. Moreover, DSSCs using a sandwich-structure photoanode with these TiO2 nanopillars in the middle exhibited 14% enhanced efficiency compared to two layers of TiO2 nanoparticles with the same thickness. The SPS and EIS investigation confirmed that the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and the efficient photogenerated charges transfer may be one of the main reasons for the high efficiency of these DSSCs. These benefits are attributed to the long 1D pillar-like structure, high crystallinity and porous microstructure. We expect that this new TiO2 nanomaterial and the sandwich-structure photoanode will have promising applications in DSSCs.
