    , Accepted 1st September 2020First published on 2nd September 2020AbstractThe conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals represents an attractive approach for CO2 utilization. Formate and methanol are sustainably valuable fuels and chemical feedstocks. However, the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) suffers from unsatisfactory activity, low faradaic efficiency (FE) and inadequate durability. In this study, ultrathin bismuth nanosheets (NSs) and Bi NSs grown on nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC-N) are prepared from in situ transformation of atomic-thick Bi2O2Se and Bi2O2Se/OMC-N. Bi NSs enable efficient formate production with a large current density (51 mA cm−2 at −1.0 VRHE) and excellent selectivity (FE ≈ 90%). Interestingly, Bi NSs/OMC-N catalyzes the conversion of CO2 to formate and methanol simultaneously with maximum FEformate (70%) and FEmethanol (67%), and long-term stability (35 h). The composition produces 9.15 and 8.00 μmol cm−2 h−1 for formate and methanol at −0.67 VRHE, respectively, and methyl formate could be further prepared from the above products. Moreover, the generated Bi NSs achieve 288 mA cm−2 at −0.61 VRHE within a flow cell. Theoretical studies reveal that the activity for methanol is rationalized as the outcome of abundant pyridinic-N sites that stabilize the *COOH intermediate. Our study unveils the potential of hierarchical Bi NSs/OMC-N for an efficient and stable CO2RR to produce chemical feedstocks.
Introduction
Carbon neutrality requires the joint efforts of social and research activity. Compared to carbon emissions, the reduction of carbon dioxide is of more formidable significance. Apart from photosynthesis,1,2 CO2 utilization via the electrocatalytic reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive approach. It enables the transformation of CO2 to valuable chemical feedstocks. As the popular products, formate and methanol are common liquid fuels and the upstream intermediates of fine chemicals.3 Among diverse catalysts for formate production, Sn-based materials attract the most attention,4,5 but most of these electrocatalysts exhibit moderate selectivity (50% to 80%) only in a narrow and high potential range (η ≈ 1 V).6–9 Methanol is another economically valuable fuel from the CO2RR;10,11 however, its production is poor in terms of selectivity and efficiency. For example, Ag, Au, Zn, Ni, Cu, and Pt reduce CO2 to CH3OH with faradaic efficiency (FE) and current densities (j) below 1% and 0.1 mA cm−2, respectively.10 Simultaneously achieving desirable activity and selectivity toward formate and methanol is almost under-explored.12,13 The challenges originate from the sluggish kinetics due to the chemical stability of CO2, and the limited selectivity caused by the sophisticated multielectron transfer. Moreover, there is intrinsic restriction to steer the industrialized current toward products,14,15 considering the limited active sites and plugged conductive path. Therefore, significant advances in the development of effective catalysts for the CO2RR are required to tackle these issues.
The similar chemical properties of Bi to other formate-producing metals (Pb, In, Sn, and Tl16,17) endow it with the potential for the CO2RR. It also exhibits an advantage of low toxicity and environmental benignity differed from other heavy metals. Previous studies mostly focused on its activity towards CO.18–21 Its potential of the CO2RR to formate started to be unveiled and appreciated recently.22–24 Although Bi consists of a layered structure, the preparation of stable Bi few-layers is still a challenge due to its low melting point and susceptible oxidability. Previous studies on synthesizing Bi-based materials were based on the transformation from PbO-like [Bi2O2] layered compounds (BiOI,24 Bi2O2CO3,25, and Bi2O3 (ref. 26)). As a typical bismuth-based oxyselenide, Bi2O2Se shows a tetragonal structure with the I4/mmm space group (a = 3.88 Å, c = 12.16 Å and Z = 2), and consists of planar covalently bonded oxide layers sandwiched by Se square arrays with weak electrostatic interactions.27 Layered Bi2O2Se lacks van der Waals gaps, unlike other two-dimensional semiconductors,28,29 resulting in intriguing cleavage along Se planes and more proactive electro-reducing to metallic Bi.
Methanol, as a six-electron reduction product, is a liquid fuel with a high economic value. To date, some metal-based materials have shown to be promising for converting CO2 to methanol.10,30 Besides, transition metal oxides31 and chalcogenides32,33 have attracted considerable attention for methanol production. Recently, the CO2RR at anchored metal single atom materials has been extensively investigated. For example, Cu decorated through-hole carbon nanofibers (CuSAs/TCNFs) could generate methanol with 44% faradaic efficiency.34 Its self-supporting and through-hole structure reduces the embedded metal atoms and pyridinic-N dopants have an important role in the CO2RR. However, the effect of heteroatom-doped carbon on CO2 reduction to methanol is barely explored.
Herein, we report Bi NSs and then hierarchical Bi NSs/OMC-N synthesized by cathodic reduction of Bi2O2Se grown on nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC-N) via a solvothermal method (Fig. 1). Benefiting from the hierarchical structure of Bi NSs and interconnected OMC-N, Bi NSs/OMC-N exhibits CO2RR activity for formate and methanol formation with large current densities, remarkable FEs, and satisfactory durability. We further couple Bi NSs/OMC-N with Ir/C, and achieve battery-driven splitting of CO2/H2O. In a flow cell, the electrocatalysts enable high industrial-grade current density, exceeding the commercialization requirement. Theoretical studies reveal that the excellent activity towards methanol formation can be attributed to the presence of abundant pyridinic-N sites that stabilize the *COOH intermediate. Our study unveils the tremendous potential of Bi NSs/OMC-N as an efficient electrocatalyst, as well as the worthy trial toward the CO2 utilization.

Results and discussion
Preparation of bismuth oxyselenide nanosheets
Bi2O2Se NSs and Bi2O2Se NSs/OMC-N composites were prepared via the hydrothermal method. During the reaction, selenourea was gradually decomposed to H2Se, and then reacted with the Bi precursor. The product was composed of the tetragonal Bi2O2Se phase indicated by its powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern (Fig. 2a), which consists of alternating [Bi2O2]2+ layers and Se2− layers stacked along the c-direction. After reasonable regulation of the synthesis conditions, the average size of Bi2O2Se NSs decreases tremendously from 90.3 to 18.5 nm, as shown in Fig. S2.† The thickness along the c-direction is estimated to be 9.9 nm based on the (004) peak using the Scherrer equation, which is obviously thinner than those of the electrodeposited Bi nanoflakes22 and liquid-phase exfoliated Bi nanosheets.35 The PXRD pattern of Bi2O2Se/OMC-N also matches well with the standard pattern (JCPDS No. 25-1463), indicating the phase of the Bi2O2Se NSs in the composite.

The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of Bi2O2Se reveals that it obviously consists of two-dimensional square nanosheets (Fig. S1b†). The effect of different synthetic parameters on the morphology was also explored and is summarized in Fig. S3,† which agree with the XRD data. Fig. 2b presents the low-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Bi2O2Se, which reveals a single set of diffraction spots with fourfold symmetry. With the increase of resolution, its corrugated surface, micropores, and defects on the surface are clearly observed. Recently, many sulfide-derived materials, such as defect-rich Bi derived from Bi2S3,36 have been introduced for catalyzing the CO2RR process. These electrocatalysts possess a high level of defects and lattice disordering, resulting in enhanced activity.37 High-resolution TEM study reveals obvious lattice fringes corresponding to the (103) plane of Bi2O2Se and even the atomic-resolution image (Fig. 2c). In order to resolve the atomic-scale structure, we carry out high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging on an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). According to Fig. S4 and S5,† the elements are uniformly distributed in Bi2O2Se NSs. Similarly, the SEM image of Bi2O2Se NSs/OMC-N reveals that they are uniformly grown on the nitrogen-doped carbon. TEM images and the corresponding SAED pattern in Fig. 2d exhibit the crystallographic Bi2O2Se in the composite. Its high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2e) shows superficial micropores and the amorphous carbon matrix. The energy dispersion spectrum shows the existence of Bi, Se, O, and C elements in the composite (Fig. S6†). Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of Bi2O2Se and Bi2O2Se NSs/OMC-N shows that their thicknesses are 1.8 and 3.1 nm, corresponding to one and two atomic layers, respectively (Fig. 2f and g). Owing to its layered structure, Bi2O2Se is expected to expose a large surface area, and its ultrathin nanosheet character favors the subsequent electroreduction to Bi.
The weight loss of the two Bi-based materials is determined in Fig. S7.† The residue weight of 84.72 wt% above 458 °C can be attributed to the decomposition of carbon and oxidation of Bi2O2Se in air, which demonstrates the loading mass of Bi2O2Se (80.11 wt%) in the composite, in agreement with the initial material ratio. N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were performed to characterize the specific surface area and the pore-size distribution (PSD), as shown in Fig. S8.† The isotherms of both materials are type-II isotherms defined by IUPIC. From the corresponding PSD analysis, the existence of micropores in the two materials can be seen evidently. For Bi2O2Se NSs/OMC-N, the obvious type-H3 hysteresis loop (according to the classification of IUPIC) reflects that the material is composed of loose flake particles. It suggests that the composite exhibits a mesoporous structure inherited from uniform mesopore carbon. The specific surface area of Bi2O2Se NSs and Bi2O2Se NSs/OMC-N is 12.96 and 149.50 m2 g−1, respectively. These results manifest their large surface area due to ultrathin nanosheets and the interwoven substrate.
In order to detect the chemical composition of Bi, O, and Se atoms, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed for the two samples. In the Bi 4f spectrum (Fig. S10†), there are two main peaks at 158.57 and 163.90 eV with a peak split of 5.3 eV from Bi3+ in Bi2O2Se NSs.38 As for Bi2O2Se/OMC-N, the relevant Bi 4f7/2 or 4f5/2 peaks have 0.19 eV shift to larger binding energy, which may be caused by the charge transfer from Bi atoms to the carbon matrix. The two peaks at 52.61 and 53.47 eV of Bi2O2Se correspond to Se 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. In addition, the corresponding Se 3d peaks of Bi2O2Se/OMC-N are almost the same as those of Bi2O2Se. The N 1s spectrum of Bi2O2Se NSs/OMC-N can be deconvoluted into four peaks at 398.7, 400.9, 402.5, and 406.2 eV, which can be assigned to pyridinic (N-6), pyrrolic (N-5), graphitic, and oxidized (N-O) nitrogen, respectively.39 It can be clearly seen that the pyridinic nitrogen has the highest content of 59.5 at%, which is more than that of value (37.5 at%) for OMC-N (Table S3†). Among these four forms of nitrogen, according to previous reports,31,40,41 the pyridinic-N and quaternary-N are both sp2 hybridized, which improve the electronic conductivity of the carbon. Additionally, the pyridinic-N is produced predominately via substituting carbon atoms, which can favor the CO2 adsorption. Therefore, the dominant pyridinic-N in the Bi2O2Se/OMC-N composition endows it with the potential for CO2 electroreduction.

In situ electroreduction of bismuth oxyselenide to a Bi-based catalyst
Although Bi2O2Se is a semiconductor, its high electron mobility42 promotes the transformation into Bi rather than other compounds, such as Bi2O2CO3, Bi2O3, and BiOX (X = Cl, Br and I).24–26 We attempted to electrochemically reduce Bi2O2Se and investigate its composition and microstructure. Fig. 3a and b show the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of Bi2O2Se and Bi2O2Se/OMC-N in 0.5 M KHCO3. They exhibit a pair of pronounced redox peaks between −1.5 and 0.5 VAg/AgCl contributed by the reversible interconversion between Bi3+ and metallic Bi0. The XRD data of the reduced products unveil peaks assignable to rhombohedral Bi, which are overlaid on the intense signals from the carbon paper (Fig. 3c). According to the integration of the cathodic peak area, the superficial active Bi sites can be estimated using the same method,24,25 as shown in Fig. S11.† It accounts for 35 at% of total Bi sites in Bi NSs, and 23 at% of total Bi sites in Bi NSs/OMC-N, larger than that of Bi sites from BiOI.24

(a & b) CV curves of electroreduction from Bi2O2Se and Bi2O2Se/OMC-N to metallic Bi at cathodic potentials; (c) XRD patterns of reduced Bi NSs and Bi NSs/OMC-N; (d & e) TEM images of Bi NSs at different magnifications and atomic resolution image; the inset shows the corresponding SAED image; (f & g) TEM images of Bi NSs/OMC-N at different magnifications with the SAED image. 
The low-resolution TEM image of Bi NSs shows that the reduced Bi retains the 2D nanosheet (Fig. 3d). High-resolution TEM analysis reveals obvious lattice fringes with a 60° intersection angle that corresponds to the (110) planes of Bi (Fig. 3e). Because of its ultrathin nature, there is obvious atomic resolution and the characteristic of rhombohedral Bi. The SAED pattern over an entire sheet shows a single set of diffraction spots with a six-fold symmetry. After the electroreduction, the HAADF-STEM image of Bi NSs illustrates the formation of metallic Bi (Fig. S12†). The TEM image and SAED pattern of Bi NSs/OMC-N show the diffraction ring of Bi and carbon (Fig. 3f). The high-resolution TEM image shows the typical crystal lattice of (110) and (012) planes of Bi. Fig. S13† illustrates the successful formation of metallic Bi and the uniform distribution of C and N elements. Ultrathin nanosheets of metallic Bi make it an ideal material for the CO2RR due to its enlarged surface area. In order to investigate the physical properties of Bi nanoparticles (NPs) and nitrogen-doped carbon, their phases and morphologies are also characterized. SEM and TEM images of OMC-N (Fig. S15†) show the morphology and porous structure of carbon, verified by the XRD pattern and isotherm result. The abundant pores and large surface area provide a foundation for Bi loading and subsequent catalysis. According to the SEM-EDX (Fig. S16†) and elemental analysis, the contribution of nitrogen is around 19 at%.
Experimental evaluation of the CO2RR
To evaluate the CO2RR performance, Bi NSs and Bi NSs/OMC-N supported on carbon fiber paper were employed as the working electrodes, and tested in a gas-tight H-configuration cell. In CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3, the negative-going polarization curves for both materials exhibit a cathodic current at −0.59 VRHE, which then increases to 20 mA cm−2 at −0.79 VRHE (Fig. 4a). Both values are markedly enhanced over commercial Bi NPs under similar conditions, indicating their excellent CO2RR performance. In the absence of CO2, the electrocatalytic activities of Bi-based catalysts are dominated by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and their performances are diminished with more negative potentials, attesting to their poor HER activities. Interestingly, the current densities at −1.0 VRHE are over 52 and 60 mA cm−2 for Bi NSs and Bi NSs/OMC-N, respectively, which are larger than those of Bi-based materials in the literature.24,25,43,44 Furthermore, in order to analyze the product, electrolysis was performed at a few potentials between −0.5 and −1.1 VRHE for over 2 hours. The resultant gaseous products are measured by using a gas chromatograph connected on line to the electrochemical cell, and liquid products were collected and measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S17†).

(a) Polarization curves of Bi NSs, Bi NSs/OMC-N and Bi NPs in N2- or CO2-saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3; (b & c) FE of HCOO−, H2, CO and CH3OH on the two reduced Bi-based electrocatalysts; (d & e) formate and methanol partial current density of Bi-based catalysts, Bi NPs and OMC-N; inset shows their corresponding Tafel slopes. (f) Long-term stability of Bi NSs and Bi NSs/OMC-N; (g) formate partial current density of Bi NSs and Bi NSs/OMC-N compared with Bi catalysts derived from BiOI,24 Bi2O2CO3 (ref. 25) and Bi2O3@MCCM;43 (h) mass-specific formate partial current density of Bi NSs and Bi NSs/OMC-N compared with Bi NPs and the Bi catalyst derived from BiOI;24 (i) comparison of the FEformate of our Bi-based electrocatalysts and other published CO2RR electrocatalysts. 
The potential-dependent faradaic efficiencies are plotted in Fig. 4b and c. As for Bi NSs, the FEformate increases to >80% at −0.75 VRHE and the peak reaches 90% at −0.88 VRHE. Afterwards, it starts to slowly decline potentially because the CO2RR process is a diffusion-controlled reaction and the HER becomes dominant with the increase of voltage. In terms of overpotential at the maximum FEformate and the window of high FE, Bi NSs exhibit better performance than commercial Bi NPs due to their ultrathin nature. Compared with Bi NSs, Bi NSs/OMC-N reaches a peak value of 72% at −0.87 VRHE. Surprisingly, methanol is also produced for Bi NSs/OMC-N, and the FEmethanol maximizes at 67% at −0.60 VRHE and then gradually begins to decline. Furthermore, the formate partial current densities of Bi NSs, Bi NSs/OMC-N, and Bi NPs are plotted against the working potential as shown in Fig. 4d. Bi NSs deliver a maximum jHCOO− of 39 mA cm−2 at −1.03 VRHE, which is slightly larger than that of Bi NSs/OMC-N. However, the value of jHCOO− for Bi NPs is below 12 mA cm−2, underlining that the CO2RR on our Bi-based electrocatalysts is significantly more efficient and selective. Tafel analysis reveals the kinetics during the catalysis (Fig. S20†). The Tafel slopes of Bi NSs (102 mV per decade) and Bi NSs/OMC-N (85 mV per decade) are in agreement with values reported for formate production.6,43 In addition, they are close to 118 mV per decade, and it indicates that an adsorbed CO˙2− radical intermediate is the rate-determining step during the catalytic process.45 The formate partial current densities of our Bi-based materials surpass those of other Bi-based catalysts reported before (Fig. 4g). Especially, the mass-specific current density for Bi NSs/OMC-N is twice that for the Bi derived from BiOI,24 reaching a record value of over 100 mA mgBi−1 at −1.0 VRHE (Fig. 4h). Besides, the turnover frequencies (TOFs) of Bi NSs and Bi NSs/OMC-N are calculated to be 1.18 and 2.31 s−1 at −0.86 VRHE (Fig. S21†), respectively. Compared to most other CO2RR materials, our Bi-based catalysts not only feature higher FEformate, but also maintain high selectivity in a relatively low overpotential (Fig. 4i and Table S6†).7,8,24,43,46–48
It is worth mentioning that Bi NSs/OMC-N is able to successfully reduce CO2 to methanol. As for the methanol production, Bi NSs/OMC-N also surpasses many electrocatalysts in terms of the FE and partial current density (Table S7†). In order to investigate the influence of the carbon matrix, its electrochemical performance is given in Fig. S22.† The methanol is the predominant product at higher potential and lower FE than those of Bi NSs/OMC-N, while formate is also observed in the production just like in the nitrogen-doped graphene. Previous studies have shown that pyridinium and derivatives are electrocatalysts to produce methanol.16,25 These results indicate that Bi is the activity site for the formate formation, and the formation of methanol is attributed to the nitrogen-doped carbon.
Durability is another crucial parameter for electrocatalysts. Bi NSs retain relatively stable current with the initial value over 25 hours at an overpotential of 550 mV (Fig. 4f). The reason for the slight increase of current density for Bi NSs is that the electrocatalytic activity of Bi NSs for the CO2RR decreases with the progress of electrolysis, as shown in Fig. S23.† When composited with OMC-N, Bi NSs/OMC-N manifests better stability for 35 hours at a higher overpotential of 620 mV, indicating its remarkable stability. Besides, they maintain over 80% FEformate after a long-term test, which places our electrocatalysts on the top of Bi-based CO2RR electrocatalysts.24,25,43 Compared to other CO2RR materials, our materials not only possess lower overpotential and larger FEformate, but also generate methanol simultaneously, which can be further developed to synthesize methyl formate when the potential is controlled properly. In order to synthesize methyl formate, Bi NSs/OMC-N catalyzes the CO2RR by using chronoamperometry at −0.67 VRHE for 24 hours. After electrolysis, the concentrations of the product were measured by 1H NMR (Fig. S24†). According to the calculation, the FEs toward formate and methanol are 48.05% and 41.98%, respectively. Considering the yield, the productive rates are 9.15 and 8.00 μmol cm−2 h−1 for formate and methanol, respectively. Through neutralization, dehydration, and temperature-controlled fractional distillation, a concentrated mixture of formic acid and methanol was obtained. After an esterification reaction, methyl formate was successfully prepared using the above raw materials, proved by 1H NMR (Fig. S25†). This is the first realization of ester compounds synthesized by the CO2RR.
CO2-splitting electrolyzers and flow cell assessments
Apart from the CO2RR at the cathode, the practical CO2 splitting electrolyzer requires the anodic reaction, such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Encouraged by the excellent CO2RR performances of Bi NSs and Bi NSs/OMC-N, we further pursued full-cell electrolysis to assess its practical implications. A commercial Ir/C catalyst (20 wt%) was employed as the OER electrocatalyst. Despite its high cost, Ir/C with excellent activities under all pH conditions (Fig. S26†) was chosen as the electrocatalyst to couple with the Bi-based materials in an H-type full cell. Their polarization curves in 0.5 M KHCO3 are depicted in Fig. 5a. The electrolyzer can be set up at a voltage of 2.1 V, which is consistent with the combination of two electrocatalysts. It is able to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 3.2 V for the Bi NSs/OMC-N‖Ir/C electrolyzer over 12 hours without significant attenuation (Fig. 5b). Finally, the electrolyzer can be driven by two AA-size alkaline batteries with an open circuit voltage of 3.1 V. When an amperemeter is connected in series, the current density is 6.43 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5c). In addition to the battery, the CO2/H2O splitting also can be driven by renewable energy sources. The Bi NSs/OMC-N‖Ir/C electrolyzer connected to a polycrystalline silicon solar cell also worked successfully under illumination (Fig. S28†).

(f & g) Chronoamperometric responses at different potentials for Bi-based electrocatalysts. The fluctuation of the current is caused by the excessive oxygen produced at the anode, especially in the case of high current density; (h) comparison of our results with previous data. 
To meet the requirement for commercial CO2RR electrocatalysts, the minimum current density is estimated to be above 200 mA cm−2. Such current density is difficult to achieve using conventional H-type cells due to the limited solubility of CO2 in the electrolyte.15 To this end, our Bi-based electrocatalysts are evaluated by using a flow cell (two-electrode and three-electrode configurations shown in Fig. 5d and S29†). Within this configuration, CO2 can be directly supplied to the cathode, which can quickly diffuse and react on the electrocatalysts, thereby breaking the limitation of CO2 solubility.15,49 The electrocatalysts are loaded onto a gas diffusion layer (SIGRACET) via typical methods,25 which accelerates the CO2 diffusion (Fig. S30†). A peristaltic pump was used to circulate the catholyte, immediately exporting the production accumulation and buffering the pH change. In addition, an alkaline electrolyte promotes the counter reaction and lowers the CO2RR activation energy barrier, which can be proved by the difference of the OER performance between 1 M KOH and 0.5 M KHCO3. Therefore, it improves the overall energy conversion efficiency in the electrolyzer. When our electrocatalysts were tested using the flow cell with 1 M KOH, the CO2RR onset potential is reduced to −0.3 and −0.26 VRHE for Bi NSs and Bi NSs/OMC-N, respectively (Fig. 5e). It is most incredible that the current density of Bi NSs reaches 347 mA cm−2 at −0.50 VRHE. Besides, the current density of Bi NSs/OMC-N reaches 198 mA cm−2 at −0.51 VRHE and meets the commercialization requirement. The performance of our Bi-based materials surpasses that of the familiar Bi from Bi2O3 nanotubes.26 The formate selectivity is also satisfactory and measured to be 95.29% at −0.465 VRHE for Bi NSs and 86.34% at −0.465 VRHE for Bi NSs/OMC-N in the flow cell (Fig. 5f). Even at a current density of 198 mA cm−2, the FE of formate still remains at 86.55% for Bi NSs. In Fig. 5h, we compare our measured current density and FE with those of recently reported formate-producing materials.7,8,23,45,47,50–59 The postmortem characterization of Bi NSs and Bi NSs/OMC-N after the amperometric stability test shows that the phase and morphology of metallic Bi remain stable (Fig. S31†).
Proposed mechanism of methanol formation and effect of nitrogen moieties
The theoretical calculations of Bi-based electrocatalysts towards formate-production have been widely studied.24–26 Meanwhile, the nitrogen-doped carbon materials have been investigated their CO2RR performance towards the formate60 or CO.61–63 In addition, the electrocatalytic properties of the CO2RR using nitrogen-doped carbon strongly depend on the N-doping level and their types. However, the experimental case and corresponding calculation of the catalytic mechanism towards methanol are still understudied. Therefore, we investigate the origin and mechanism of our Bi-based carbon composites for methanol production. The first-principles calculations were carried out via the computational hydrogen electrode methodology. In the CO2RR process, CO2 adsorption behavior is systematically investigated. Three nitrogen configurations are constructed as shown in Fig. S32.† And the CO2 molecule favors to adsorb over the N-doping sites, and the corresponding adsorption energies are −0.195 eV (pyridinic-N), −0.197 eV (pyrrolic-N), and −0.168 eV (graphitic-N). The adsorption behavior of intermediates is different at various substrates (Table S8†). For example, the adsorption energy for all intermediates is extremely low at graphitic-N, leading to weak absorbability for intermediates. On the other hand, the adsorption energy of intermediates on pyrrolic-N is too strong to desorb the intermediates, such as the adsorption energy of *CHOH (−5.32 eV). Compared to the above result, the adsorption energy of intermediates at pyridinic-N is moderate for both adsorption and desorption, and thus it should be the most favorable active site for the CO2RR process. Besides, the stronger adsorption of *COHOH (−1.05 eV) than *HCOOH on pyridinic-N indicates that the latter is the favorite intermediate during the CO2RR process.
Apart from adsorption behavior, the Gibbs free energy for various intermediates is further investigated, and the results are summarized in Fig. 6. The protonation of CO2 to *COOH is mildly endothermic (0.21 eV) at pyridinic-N, which is much lower than those of other N-doped moieties, suggesting the easier formation of *COOH. Meanwhile, another intermediate from *COOH to *CHO is *COHOH. Its Gibbs free energy is as large as 0.97 eV, indicating that *HCOOH is the optimal path for *COOH → *CHO. Consecutively, the rate-determining step occurs during the conversion of *CHO to *CHOH with a mild energy barrier (1.62 eV) for pyridinic-N. Conversely, the rate-determining step on pyrrolic-N appears during *CHOH → *CH2OH with a value of 4.5 eV, which is extremely larger than that of the pyridine type. This high energy barrier may be attributed to the strong adsorption of *CHOH at the pyrrole surface. As for graphitic-N, a relatively high energy barrier (4.02 eV) occurs at *HCOOH → *HCO (rate determining step). Considering the above results, pyridinic-N possesses the lowest energy barrier and the highest activity. Therefore, the adsorption behavior and Gibbs free energy difference effectively exhibit the higher activity of pyridinic-N for the methanol production.

Conclusions
In summary, we report Bi NSs formed in situ on nitrogen-doped carbon from the conversion of Bi2O2Se NSs. They possess an enlarged surface area and abundant active sites. When used as the electrocatalyst in 0.5 M KHCO3, Bi NSs enable efficient formate production with a large current density (51 mA cm−2 at −1.0 VRHE), excellent selectivity (FE ≈ 90%), and satisfactory stability (25 h). Importantly, Bi NSs/OMC-N achieves a comparable current density (57 mA cm−2 at −1.0 VRHE), and outstanding durability for 35 h. Although the FEformate slightly decreases to 71%, surprisingly methanol is obtained during the CO2RR. When regulated to suitable potential, two products are generated at an approximate concentration. The electrochemical performances of our Bi-based materials surpass those of other electrocatalysts previously reported. The Bi-based catalysts can also be paired with Ir/C to achieve CO2RR/OER electrolysis powered by batteries or solar cells. With a flow cell, our electrocatalysts realize an industrial-grade current density of over 200 mA cm−2, transcending the conventional CO2RR catalysts. Their superior performances originate from the Bi NSs and nitrogen dopants. The Bi NSs offer abundant active sites for formate, and the nitrogen-doped carbon plays the role of active sites for methanol. Verified by the theoretical study, pyridinic-N possesses better activity for methanol than other nitrogen dopants. DFT calculations suggest that the high selectivity toward methanol is due to its stabilized intermediate (*COOH) on the pyridinic-N sites. This study opens up an attractive avenue to design inexpensive electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 to high-value chemicals.
