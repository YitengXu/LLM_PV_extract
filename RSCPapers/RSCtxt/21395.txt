    , Accepted 24th May 2013First published on 28th May 2013AbstractRegioregular conjugated polymers containing alternating pyridyl[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT) and indacenodithiophene (IDT) structural units were synthesized. In these copolymers, the pyridyl nitrogen atoms on PT are precisely arranged along the backbone so that each one has an adjacent proximal and an adjacent distal counterpart across the two IDT flanking units. We find that despite the absence of obvious differences in orbital energy levels and optical bandgap, the regioregular materials exhibit larger charge carrier mobilities, as determined by using field effect transistor devices, and can yield higher solar cell power conversion efficiencies when mixed with fullerenes in bulk heterojunction active layers.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on conjugated polymers and fullerene acceptors have attracted much attention due to the possibility of solution fabrication.1 This approach has led to power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 8–10% based on the optimization of processing technologies and the development of new narrow band gap materials, primarily via the development of copolymers containing electron rich and electron poor fragments.2 For conjugated polymers containing unsymmetric structural units, it is well-known that molecular structure, especially in terms of regioregularity, influences relevant optoelectronic properties. Classic examples include poly(3-alkylthiophene), poly(3-alkylthienylenevinylenes) and poly(2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene).3 We recently showed that by controlling the orientation of the pyridyl[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT) unit along the backbone vector one can obtain up to two orders of magnitude improvement in the carrier mobility, relative to counterparts that are not synthesized with specific control.4 Moreover, these regioregular PT copolymers have been recently shown to be useful in the fabrication of field effect transistors (FETs) with hole mobilities of up to 6.7 cm2 V−1 s−1.5
Indacenodithiophene (IDT), which contains two thiophene rings held in a rigid arrangement via a central phenyl ring, has been recently shown to be a suitable electron rich moiety for the design of narrow band gap conjugated polymers for incorporation into organic solar cells.6 For the donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer containing IDT and PT, it was found that in combination with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) one could obtain PCEs on the order of 3.4%.7 Based on the recent success in achieving high charge carrier mobilities discussed above, it seemed to be appropriate to consider how relevant basic physical properties and device function would be influenced by controlling the regiochemistry in PT–IDT copolymers; a structural consideration that has not received attention in the literature. In this contribution, we show that, indeed, regioregular IDT–PT copolymers show improved performances relative to regiorandom counterparts.
A two step procedure is required for the preparation of the regioregular polymer, see Scheme 1. First, the cross-coupling reaction of two equivalents of 4,7-dibromo-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (PTBr2) with (4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sec-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (M1) provided 4,4′-(4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sec-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(7-bromo-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine) (M2). This reaction takes advantage of the higher reactivity of C–Br adjacent to the pyridyl nitrogen on PT. In a second step, microwave-assisted Stille polymerization of M1 with M2 generates the target copolymer (PIPT-RG) with the regiochemistry as shown in Scheme 1. Specifically, for each PT unit one finds an adjacent distal PT (N atoms pointing away) and an adjacent proximal PT (N atoms pointing toward) fragments. Also for comparison with PIPT-RG, we prepared the IDT-co-PT copolymer via the established route reported in the literature in which one equivalent of PTBr2 and one equivalent of the distannylated compound M1 are subjected to Stille-coupling conditions.7 The resulting product is expected to be less structurally precise and will be referred to as PIPT-RA.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of PIPT-RG. 
Both PIPT-RG and PIPT-RA were end-capped after polymerization to remove unreacted bromide or trimethyltin end-groups,8 and were purified by Soxhlet extraction using methanol, acetone, hexane and dichloromethane successively. The final polymers corresponded to the remaining chloroform soluble fraction. Gel permeation chromatography showed that the two polymers have very same molecular weight characteristics. The number average molecular weights are 60 kDa and 68 kDa for PIPT-RA and PIPT-RG, with polydispersities of 2.5 and 2.4, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). No noticeable phase transitions were observed for either material using differential scanning calorimetry up to 300 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Fig. 1a shows the absorption profiles in the solid state. PIPT-RA exhibits a band centred at 710 nm, which corresponds to intermolecular charge transfer interactions between the donor and acceptor moieties. A higher energy transition is also observed at 417 nm, which has been previously assigned to a delocalized π–π* transition. These observations are consistent with properties described in the literature.7Fig. 1a also shows that PIPT-RG exhibits a nearly indistinguishable profile. From the onsets of absorption one can estimate the optical band gaps of the two copolymers to be nearly equal (1.60 eV). However, it is worth noting that the film absorption coefficient (α) of PTPT-RA (0.65 × 104 cm−1) is smaller than that of PIPT-RG (0.77 × 104 cm−1). This slightly stronger intensity is not understood at this point, but may be related to differences in the orientation of the polymer chains relative to the substrate surface or subtle differences in interchain packing, partly influenced by the regioregularity or the ordered vector of the PT unit along the polymer main chain.
 Fig. 1  UV-Vis absorption spectra (a) and UPS spectra (b) of PIPT-RA and PIPT-RG in the solid state. 
Electrochemical measurements using cyclic voltammetry (CV) were carried out to estimate the orbital energy levels (Fig. S3, ESI†). The onsets of oxidation (Eox) are determined to be 0.50 V and 0.45 V, corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (EHOMO) of −5.30 eV and −5.25 eV for PIPT-RA and PIPT-RG, respectively. These values are similar to those reported in the literature and are equivalent given the errors in measurements and the assumptions in energy calculations.7 It was also determined that nearly no difference in the HOMO values could be determined by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. 1b). The onsets of reduction (Ered) of the two copolymers were indistinguishable and located at approximately −1.20 V, corresponding to a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (ELUMO) of approximately −3.60 eV. Thus, the increase in regioregularity led to no detectable differences in energy levels as could be determined by conventional characterization methods.
To investigate charge transport properties of the polymers, bottom gate, bottom contact field effect transistors (FETs) with the architecture Si/SiO2/DTS/polymer/Au were fabricated by spin-casting from 0.4 wt/v% of solution in 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Decyltrichlorosilane (DTS) was used as a dielectric passivation layer. Fig. 2 shows characteristic output and transfer curves after the films were thermally annealed at 150 °C for 10 minutes. From these data one obtains calculated hole mobilities of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PIPT-RG and 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PIPT-RA. This result indicates that better charge carrier transport can be realized by controlling the regioregularity of PIPT, which is consistent with previously demonstrated better performance with other regioregular PT-containing polymers.4

Solar cells with an architecture described by ITO/molybdenum oxide (MoO3)/polymer:PC71BM/Al were fabricated as testing platforms, where the MoO3 anode buffer layer was processed by spin-coating from aqueous MoO3 solution.9 We first screened device performance with different polymer/PC71BM weight ratios under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. S4 and Table S1, ESI†). The optimized weight ratio of the polymer to PC71BM was found to be 1:4 and PCEs of 3.4% for PIPT-RA (denoted as A1 in Table 1) and 5.1% for PIPT-RG (denoted as A2 in Table 1) were obtained by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min,10 respectively. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1. Device A2 exhibited higher shunt resistance (Rsh = 6.1 MΩ cm−2) and lower series resistances (Rs = 0.66 KΩ cm−2) than device A1 (Rsh = 4.1 MΩ cm−2 and Rs = 1.23 KΩ cm−2), respectively (Fig. S6, ESI†), indicating that the leakage current in A2 is lower, and higher FF could be achieved.

We note here that topographic analysis using atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows that the PIPT-RG:PC71BM film is smoother (root mean square, rms, roughness of 0.5 nm) than PIPT-RA:PC71BM (rms = 3.5 nm). Furthermore, AFM also shows that PIPT-RA:PC71BM films exhibit round elevated features that suggest more pronounced BHJ phase separation. Even though the AFM images mainly reflect the surface of film morphologies, the relative suppression of domain size in PIPT-RG:PC71BM could be responsible for the improvements in device function.
Hole- and electron-only devices were specifically fabricated to estimate the charge mobilities of the blend films by a space charge limited current (SCLC) model as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The electron mobility of two devices are comparable (2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), most likely implying that the properties of the PC71BM pathway are not modified significantly. However, the PIPT-RG:PC71BM device exhibited higher hole mobility (1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) relative to that of the PIPT-RA:PC71BM device (3.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Since the collected current is dependent on the charge transporting properties of the BHJ layer, the higher hole mobility may be responsible for the larger Jsc observed for the PIPT-RG based device A2. Moreover, more balanced charge carrier mobility of PIPT-RG:PC71BM blends will lead to an improvement in FF.
Further optimization of solar cell performance was achieved through the use of inverted structures of the type ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM (1:4 wt:wt)/MoO3/Ag. These devices are denoted in Table 1 as B1 and B2, respectively. Here the active layers were also annealed at 100 °C for 10 min before cathode deposition. The best inverted device structure (B1) with PIPT-RA provided a PCE of 4.5%, (Jsc = 12.13 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86, and FF = 43%). The best performing device with PIPT-RG exhibited a much larger PCE of 6.7% (Jsc = 13.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.88 V and FF = 55%). The J–V characteristics and EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 3 and the device performances are summarized in Table 1. Note that the integrations of EQE spectra (Fig. 3b) are consistent with the Jsc results obtained from J–V measurements.
In conclusion, we have observed that the PCEs of indacenodithiophene-co-pyridyl[2,1,3]thiadiazole (IDT–PT) based copolymers can be improved by precisely controlling the orientation of the N-atom in the PT unit with respect to the polymer backbone. One finds that the optical and electrochemical properties of the regioregular PIPT-RG and the polymer obtained through conventional synthesis (PIPT-RA) are essentially identical within the certainties of the measurements. However, the FET hole mobility of PIPT-RG is higher than that of PIPT-RA. Of particular note is that the PCE values of BHJ solar cells with PIPT-RG are significantly improved and that in these devices one finds from single carrier diode measurements that the hole mobilities are also higher. With inverted device structures one can obtain with PIPT-RG:PC71BM a PCE of 6.7%. From a practical perspective, these findings highlight the benefits of controlling the regiochemistry of PT-containing narrow bandgap conjugated polymers.
