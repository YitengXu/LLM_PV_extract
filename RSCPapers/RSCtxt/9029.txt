    , Accepted 27th August 2022First published on 29th August 2022AbstractDefects can greatly promote the catalytic activity of a carbon-based electrocatalyst due to charge redistribution of its electroneutral π-conjugated structure. However, it is still a huge challenge to introduce enough defects into carbon-based materials to improve their catalytic activity. Herein, we report a new method for defect generation by the pyrolysis of the sulfur–nitrogen-containing coordination polymer [Zn(ptt)2]n (ptt = 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol). A series of controlled experiments clearly demonstrates that the carbothermal reduction reaction of zinc sulfide with carbon at a high temperature plays an important role in creating defects and enhancing the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of the carbon-based materials. The ZnS/C-1100 with a high content of defects and a small number of ZnS nanoparticles exhibits excellent ORR electrocatalytic performances in alkaline media, in which the half-wave potential (0.894 V vs. RHE), stability, and methanol tolerance are all superior to that of a 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the ZnS/C-1100 driven ZAB (zinc air battery) exhibits a stable discharge at 10 mA, a peak power density of 134 mW cm−2 and a cathode current density of 265 mA cm−2, which are significantly better than that catalyzed by 20 wt% Pt/C under the same conditions. This research not only develops a new highly active catalyst, but also provides a new method for the preparation of defect-rich carbon materials.
The accelerated consumption of fossil fuels has raised serious environmental concerns, which has prompted research into new renewable energy technologies.1–3 As new energy devices, fuel cells and metal–air batteries have already shown greater potential;4–7 however, the efficiency of these batteries is reduced greatly by the slow cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).8 Therefore, catalysts must be utilized to accelerate the ORR reaction to increase the power density of these energy devices.8,9 To date, Pt-based metal catalysts remain the best ORR catalysts for solving kinetic problems, but the high -cost and instability of the catalysts hinder the widespread commercialization of these energy conversion and storage devices, and thus, it is critical to explore low-cost, high-activity ORR electrocatalysts to replace Pt catalysts.10–12 Materials made from carbon, an abundant element with excellent electronic conductivity, durability, and tunable morphology, are expected to replace noble metals as catalysts for ORR.13–16 Unfortunately, since the stable π-conjugated system of carbon materials is inert to the adsorption/activation of O2 and ORR intermediates, pristine carbon has poor ORR electrocatalytic activity.17 Recently, it has been demonstrated that the ORR activity of carbon can be promoted by tuning the band gap, charge, and spin density of carbon materials through breaking the π-conjugated system.18,19 Earlier, in order to attain the purpose of adjusting the carbon structure to enhance its ORR activity, the strategy of heteroatom doping was often used,20,21 with nitrogen atom doping being a common method for obtaining carbon materials with a high ORR catalytic performance.22–24 It has been proposed that pyrrole nitrogen and pyridine nitrogen doped in carbon materials often endow carbon materials with high activity.25–28 However, the catalytic activity does not always be enhanced with increasing nitrogen content, and thus, different heteroatoms are used to produce synergistic effects to achieve higher charge densities and asymmetric spins on carbon atoms.29–34 Similarly, there is not a simple linear relationship between the multi-element doping level and the catalytic performance.35 On the basis of the in-depth exploration of heteroatom-doped carbon materials, it has been found that defects can also greatly improve ORR catalytic activity.36–40
As pioneering work in order to ascertain the active site in carbon, Yao's group41 used the Zn removal method to manufacture defects on pure carbon without heteroatoms, which showed high ORR activity and confirmed the contribution of carbon defects intuitively. Similar to heteroatom doping, defects can alter the local electron configuration and charge distribution of nearby carbon atoms, which greatly promote the ORR process.42–44 Recently, it has been proved that pentagonal defects are the main active sites of acidic ORR in carbon materials prepared through the high temperature removal of dopants.45 Therefore, using defect engineering to tune the intrinsic activity of carbon materials is an effective way to upgrade their electrocatalytic performance. However, methodological studies on carbon defect generation are still limited.
Herein, a series of controlled experiments involving the pyrolysis of the coordination polymer [Zn(ptt)2]n (Hptt = 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol), indicates that the carbothermal reduction reaction of zinc sulfide with carbon can produce large numbers of defects. Electrochemical testing confirms carbon defects and residual nano-zinc sulfide plays a vital role in promoting high ORR activity in these catalysts. The prepared catalyst ZnS/C-1100 with a high content of defects and a small number of ZnS nanoparticles exhibits a half potential (E1/2 = 0.894 V vs. RHE) value in 0.1 M KOH, which is 40 mV superior to that of 20 wt% Pt/C. Moreover, the discharge stability and peak power density of a ZnS/C-1100 driven zinc air battery (ZAB) is much better than that of a 20 wt% Pt/C driven ZAB under the same conditions.
The synthesis routes of catalysts are shown in Scheme 1. First of all, the precursor [Zn(ptt)2]n is obtained by reacting hptt and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in DMF while stirring (see details in the ESI†).46 The precursor is a 1D coordination polymer (Fig. 1a), in which the ZnII ions are coordinated by ptt in a tetrahedral geometry.46 The phase purity of the precursor is confirmed by PXRD (Fig. S1a†). Carbon materials ZnS/C-X (X = 800, 900, 1000, 1100) were prepared by pyrolyzing the precursor at temperatures (T) of 800 °C, 900 °C, 1000 °C, and 1100 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Modified carbon materials C-X (X = 800, 900, 1000, 1100) were obtained by etching the ZnS/C-X with hydrochloric acid to remove ZnS. As comparative samples, C800ZnS–1100, C900ZnS–1100, C800–1100 and C900–1100 were obtained by two-step treatments of ZnS/C-X (X = 800, 900). As shown in Scheme 1, C800ZnS–1100 and C900ZnS–1100 were obtained by pickling ZnS/C-800 and ZnS/C-900 after secondary carbonization at 1100 °C, while the C800–1100 and C900–1100 are obtained from the secondary carbonization of C-800 and C-900 at 1100 °C.

Morphologies of ZnS/C-X (X = 800, 900, 1000, 1100) were observed through SEM (scanning electron microscopy) images (Fig. 1b–e), in which the size and content of ZnS particles decreased with increasing temperature. This suggests that a high temperature favors the carbothermal reduction reaction. At 1100 °C, the size of ZnS nanoparticles was reduced to about 5 nm, as shown by TEM (transmission electron microscopy) images (Fig. 1f and g). The lattice distance of 0.28 nm is close to that of the (101) crystal plane of ZnS. Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) (Fig. S1b†) reveal that the precursor collapsed at a low temperature of about 290 °C before carbonization, and then the S2− combined with Zn2+ to form ZnS. PXRD patterns also reveal that the carbothermal reduction reaction takes place at a high temperature (Fig. S2a†). As shown in Fig. S2a,† the intensity of the diffraction peaks of ZnS decreases as the temperature increases from 800 °C to 1100 °C, which indicates ZnS is reduced by carbon at a high temperature. This is different from the carbothermal reaction of ZnO, which can react significantly at a lower temperature of 800 °C or 900 °C.43,47,48 There are no diffraction peaks of ZnS in the PXRD pattern (Fig. S2b, and S2c†) of C-X, which suggests that the nano-ZnS has been eliminated by further pickling treatment. No obvious ZnS nanoparticles were observed in C-1100 in the TEM images also indicating that the ZnS was removed effectively by pickling (Fig. 1h–j).
The Raman spectra of these materials show typical peaks at 1331 cm−1 and 1582 cm−1, which are attributed to the D-band of the defective (or disordered) carbon and G-band of the graphitic carbon, respectively (Fig. 2a and b). The ID/IG value of ZnS/C-1100 (1.15) and C-1100 (1.16) is larger than that of C-800 (0.96), C-900 (0.84), and C-1000 (1.00), which suggests the number of defects generated increases with rising temperature.49 The increase in temperature is conducive to the carbothermal reaction of ZnS and the in situ high-temperature denitrification, which can produce a large number of carbon defects and finally improve ORR catalytic activity.50 The ID/IG value of C800–1100 (0.99), C900–1100 (0.94) is smaller than that of C800ZnS–1100 (1.18), C900ZnS–1100 (1.11) (Fig. 2b) indicating that the carbothermal reduction reaction of ZnS with carbon is the main factor in the generation of defects. A nitrogen sorption experiment was performed to investigate the porous structure (Fig. 2c and Fig. S2d†). The characteristic type-I isotherm of these materials suggests that the carbon has a microporous structure. After the removal of ZnS without adsorption activity, the nitrogen adsorption capacity of carbon materials was significantly increased. The difference of the adsorption capacity between the ZnSC-X and C-X samples before and after pickling decreases with increasing temperature, which again indicates that the carbothermic reaction of ZnS is more complete at a high temperature. It was also found that the BET specific surface areas of C-1000 and C-1100 are very close, which suggests that carbonization is sufficient at a temperature above 1000 °C (Table 1). It is worth noting that the high specific surface area and large pore size may contribute to the exposure of active sites and mass transfer.51

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyse the elements and their chemical states. From the survey spectra, peaks related to C, N, O and S are found in C-X and ZnS/C-1100 (Fig. S3† and Fig. 2d). Besides the C, N, O and S peaks, ZnS/C-1100 also has two peaks at 1022.1 eV and 1045.3 eV, which are assigned to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. S3d†). The contents of Zn 2p and S 2p are 0.3% and 0.77%, respectively. The Zn and S ratio is smaller than that of ZnS, suggesting there are still other forms of sulfur contributing in the formation of covalent bonds with carbon. Furthermore, from high resolution S 2p spectra (Fig. S3c and e†), the C–S–C bond at 163.92 eV and 165.07 eV, and the C–SOx–C bond at 167.8 eV and 168.98 eV are also found, in which the presence of C–SOx–C is due to the inevitable introduction of O2. The high resolution N 1s spectra can be divided into four peaks at 398.71 eV, 399.96 eV, 401.00 eV and 403.19 eV belonging to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and oxidized N, which are common phenomena in N-doped carbon materials. The XPS spectra also shows that the N content decreased from 8.43% to 2.01% with an increase of the calcination temperature (Fig. S3a†), indicating the denitrification at high temperatures. From Fig. S3f and S4,† it was found that after the secondary pyrolysis process the N content (about 2.01%–2.36%) in C800–1100, C800ZnS–1100, C900–1100 and C900ZnS–1100 is similar to that of C-1100, which also demonstrates the denitrification at 1100 °C. The removal of the N element may produce defects, which is consistent with the smaller ID/IG value of C800 (0.96) and C900 (0.84) than that of C800–1100 (0.99) and C900–1100 (0.94). Although the removal of the N atoms at high temperature is one reason for the defects, the larger ID/IG values of C800ZnS–1100 (1.18) and C900ZnS–1100 (1.11) than that of C800–1100 (0.99) and C900–1100 (0.94) demonstrate the carbothermal reduction reaction of ZnS with carbon as the main cause of carbon defects.
ORR activities of the catalysts were firstly compared by cyclic voltammetric (CV) scans in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. All the samples show a distinct reduction peak in the O2 purged electrolyte with regard to the N2-saturated system, suggesting an efficient oxygen reduction process (Fig. 3a). Linear scan voltammogram (LSV) curves in Fig. 3b confirm the efficient ORR catalytic activity of these materials. The half-wave potential of C-X increases from 0.771 V to 0.860 V (versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with the increase of the carbonization temperature (Table 2). The E1/2 values of C-1100 are even better than that of a 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (0.85 V). Understanding the structure–performance relationship of active sites at the atomic scale is crucial for electrocatalysis.52,53 Despite the lack of sufficient atomic-scale structural information, the results of comparative control experiments can still give us some insights into the catalytic activity. Generally, the doping of nitrogen favours the four-electrons process and improves the catalytic activity of ORR, and the introduction of S and O benefits the two-electrons process. In this work, with an increase of the carbonization temperature, the N content decreases significantly, and the change of O and S content is not very large but irregular. The doped pyridyl and pyrrole nitrogen species are usually designated as the activity center.21 As revealed by N 1s XPS spectra, the proportion of pyridyl and pyrrole nitrogen in the total N content is also reduced by increasing the carbonization temperature (Fig. S3b†). Thus, catalyst activity enhancement after higher temperature carbonization is independent of nitrogen heteroatoms. Compared to C800–1100 and C900–1100, C800ZnS–1100 and C900 ZnS–1100 have similar nitrogen content and species but a superior ORR performance. That also indicates that the dopant nitrogen atom is not responsible for the difference in the activity of these catalysts. Among, C-X the C-800 and C-900 have a similar oxygen content but significantly different catalytic activity, and C-1000 has the highest oxygen content but its E1/2 is neither the highest nor the lowest. Therefore, there is no apparent dependence between their performance levels and oxygen content. Similar to the oxygen content, there is also no obvious correlation between the S doping content and the catalytic activity of C-X. C-1100 with the largest ID/IG and the best catalytic performance among C-X, in which C-1000 has similar BET and pore volume values as C-1100. This indicates that the defects are critical in enhancing the ORR activity in this system. And from the LSV curves shown in Fig. S5† and Table 2, it is found that the half-wave potential of C800ZnS–1100 (0.860 V) and C900ZnS–1100 (0.839 V) are respectively higher than that of C800–1100 (0.825 V) and C900–1100 (0.789 V) with similar heteroatom N content, which demonstrated that the defects caused by the carbothermic reaction of ZnS can promote high ORR catalytic activity. The ZnS/C-1100 has the highest half-wave potential of 0.894 V among these materials, suggesting a bit of nano-ZnS can greatly improve the ORR performance on the basis of defects.8,54,55 The limiting current density and Tafel slope (Fig. 3c, and Table 2) of these materials also confirmed that C-1100 and ZnS/C-1100 have a higher activity than other catalysts. In the SCN− toxicity test (Fig. S6†), the half-wave potential of ZnS/C-1100 decreases by about 7 mV, which could be due to the SCN− bonding to the ZnS crystal plane.

The electrochemical activity areas (ECSA) of catalysts have been calculated and compared by an electrochemical double layer method. As shown in (Fig. S7 and S8†), the Cdl of 18.18 mF cm−2 for ZnS/C-1100 is larger than that of the 2.09 mF cm−2 for ZnS/C-1000, and Cdl of 10.08 mF cm−2 for C-1100 is larger than that of the 3.5 mF cm−2 for C-1000. These results demonstrate that as the pyrolysis temperature rises, the number of active sites increases. In addition, Cdl of ZnS/C-1100 being larger than that of C-1100 indicates that nano-ZnS can provide active centers (Fig. S7†). The Cdl of ZnS/C-1000 is smaller than C-1000, which illustrates that the size of ZnS in ZnS/C-1000 makes it too large to be used as an active center (Fig. S8†). The Cdl values of C800ZnS–1100 and C900ZnS–1100 are also larger than that of C-1000 also confirming the effect of the manufacturing activity center of the high temperature carbothermal reaction (Fig. S9†).
To reveal the ORR kinetics of ZnS/C-1100, LSV curves have been collected at various rotation speeds ranging from 400 to 2500 rpm. As presented in Fig. 3d, with an increase of the rotation speed, the polarization current increases gradually owing to a decrease of the diffusion distance. The RRDE tests (Fig. 3e) indicate that ZnS/C-1100 can implement the ORR with the four-electron transfer process with the electron transfer number (n) ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 and a H2O2 yield generally below 10.45% in a wide potential range (0.2 V–0.8 V) in alkaline solution. Note the high H2O2 yields of C-1100 and ZnS/C-1100 are due to the sulfur heteroatom, which favors the 2-electron process.56 The current–time (i–t) chronoamperometric responses for the ORR have been carried out to examine a possible methanol crossover effect and stability towards the ORR. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3f, there is a sharp decrease in current upon the addition of 1.0 M methanol at 2500 s on the 20% Pt/C electrode. However, the ZnS/C-1100 electrocatalyst remains almost unchanged after the addition of methanol. This observation suggests that the ZnS/C-1100 electrocatalyst has good methanol tolerance. Durability testing was further conducted at 0.5 V vs. RHE in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. As shown in Fig. 3f, after 10 h ZnS/C-1100 causes only a slight loss (5.5%) of current density. In contrast, under the same conditions, the corresponding current of the 20% Pt/C catalyst can only reach 87% of the initial current. These results clearly indicate that the ZnS/C-1100 electrocatalyst is more durable than the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst. All the above test results show that the active sites of the catalyst demonstrate that the nano-ZnS and defects are all conducive to the ORR and have high stability, while in acidic medium, C-1100 has a decent ORR property with a half-wave potential 0.69 V vs. RHE (Fig. S10†).
The efficiency of the ZnS/C-1100 electrocatalyst is further characterized in the assembled zinc–air batteries with the 20% Pt/C electrocatalyst serving as a comparison (Fig. 4a). All Zn–air batteries have been tested under ambient conditions. Polarization profiles were submitted to evaluate the cathode performances. Fig. 4b shows that the ZAB assembled from ZnS/C-1100 produces a high open-circuit voltage of 1.48 V. In the voltage range from 0.5 V to 1.5 V, the current density can reach 265 mA cm−2 at a voltage of 0.5 V, and the peak-power density is 134 mW cm−2, both of which are superior to those of the commercial 20% Pt/C (Fig. 4c). This indicates that the ZnS/C-1100 catalyst shows an excellent performance in the assembled ZAB. The cycling performance of the ZnS/C-1100 cathode has been evaluated following a galvanization discharge–charge mode. Fig. 4d shows that when the current is constant at 10 mA, the voltage remains at about 1.29 V. After 18 h of discharge, the voltage only decreases to 98% of the initial voltage, showing good stability, which also provides the possibility of a ZnS/C-1100 catalyst being employed in practical batteries.

In summary, we have developed a method to introduce abundant defects into carbon materials by the pyrolysis of sulfur–nitrogen-containing coordination polymers [Zn(ptt)2]n. A series of control experiments verifies the role of carbothermal reduction in the construction of active centers. The carbon catalysts (ZnS/C-1100) with abundant defects and residual ZnS nanoparticles obtained by this method show outstanding ORR electrocatalytic performances in alkaline medium with a half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.894 V vs. RHE). Stability and methanol tolerance of ZnS/C-1100 are both superior to those of a 20% Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, with the ZnS/C-1100 catalyst, the assembled Zn–air battery has very stable charge and discharge voltages, high current and power density. This work suggests that a high-temperature carbothermic reaction is an effective method to construct carbon defects and is worthy of further popularization and application.
