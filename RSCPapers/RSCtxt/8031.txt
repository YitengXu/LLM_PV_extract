    , Accepted 25th January 2021First published on 25th January 2021AbstractThe robust material tunability of the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP) has attracted considerable research interests to explore the application in photoelectronic devices. Huge hysteresis has been recognised as a main problem in HOIP-based photoelectric devices; the origin of hysteresis has been attributed to the ion migration and trap states in HOIP materials. In this study, we designed and synthesised a HOIP single crystal with one-dimensional structure where the PbI42− octahedron is caged by the organic chains. The ion migration can be dramatically suppressed by the quantum size effect. Besides, in the single crystal trap states density is ultra-low due to the absence of grain boundaries. As a result, photodetectors based on this 1D HOIP single crystal show negligible hysteresis I–V curves. Moreover, a high quality ohmic contact is formed between electrodes and 1D HOIP, which is beneficial for photocarrier extraction. A responsivity of 80 mA W−1 and EQE of 30% are realised. The response speed is determined to be less than 0.4 ms. In addition, the photodetectors based on the novel 1D single crystal present good stability; after 3 months of ambient storage, 85% of its original photocurrent generation ability is retained.
1. Introduction
The last decade witnessed the blooming application of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP) materials in optoelectronic devices.1,2 Compared with conventional semiconducting materials, HOIP has some specific advantages including bandgap tunability,3,4 high absorption coefficient,5,6 long carrier diffusion length,7 high hole and electron mobilities.8,9 Besides, it can be fabricated via cost-efficient solution processes on a large scale.10,11 The photovoltaic devices employing a HOIP light absorbing layer have realised power conversion efficiency of about 25%,12 and this value is comparable with those of silicon solar cells. The success in solar cells encourages the attempts of applying HOIP in other optoelectronic devices including light emitting diodes (LEDs),13,14 lasers15,16 and photodetectors.17 Similar to solar cells, photodetectors also convert optical signals to electric signals; due to the robust performance of HOIP in solar cells, applications of these materials in γ-ray detection,18,19 X-ray imaging,20,21 and monochromatic and wideband photodetection22,23 have been attempted and presented promising results.
However, to realise commercial utilisation of HOIP-based photodetectors, some issues need to be addressed; among which, current–voltage hysteresis behaviour is a crucial one.24 This phenomenon is attributed to the ion migration and trap states25–28 and dramatically limits the stability and reliability of HOIP photodetectors.29,30 To inhibit the ionic movements, several approaches have been proposed. Doping PCBM into the perovskite film has been proved to be effective in suppressing ion migration and trap states generation, subsequently reducing the hysteresis.26 It has also been reported in low-dimensional HOIP that the ion migration can be suppressed dramatically.31,32 Currently, most of the reported low dimensional perovskite materials are fabricated based on nanowires,33,34 nanoribbons35 and nanosheets36,37 of ABX3 type perovskite materials. In these cases, the 1D or 2D refers to the outer surface in the scale of micrometres and the ion migration cannot be suppressed by quantum size effect, which is supposed to occur in low dimensional crystal structure, which should be in the molecular scale. Indeed, some layered perovskite materials with 2D crystal structures have been used in photodetection devices and showed promising performance.38–40 However, the hysteresis problem has not been solved in the reported 2D systems.
To decrease the trap states that contribute to the capacitive current and consequently hysteresis, interface engineering is another commonly used strategy.41 In addition, attempts to reduce the grain boundaries are also an effective method to alleviate the current voltage hysteresis in HOIP devices. Several groups have reported the fabrication of photodetectors directly on the surface of single crystals and good performance is determined.42–45 However, the main problem of single crystal-based optoelectronic devices is that the bulky single crystal is fragile and it is still challenging to obtain high-quality single crystal membranes, which are compatible with flexible substrates.45
In this work, we designed and synthesised a HOIP single crystal with a 1D crystalline structure, in which the inorganic PbI42− octahedra are wrapped by the organic chains. We fabricated photodetectors based on the single crystal. A responsivity of 80 mA W−1 and EQE of 30% are realised. The response speed is determined to be less than 0.4 ms. As expected, the low dimensional structure and low trap density of the 1D single crystal effectively suppresses the ion migration and trap states density resulting in the photodetectors presenting hysteresis-free character. Besides, the energy level aligns with gold electrodes resulting in a good ohmic contact and linear current voltage behaviour. Moreover, photodetectors based on the novel 1D single crystal presents good stability; after 3 months of ambient storage, 85% of its original photocurrent generation ability is retained.
2. Results and discussion
To realise a low dimensional crystal structure, introducing a hydrophobic long alkyl chain or aromatic groups on the ammonium cation is an effective strategy, which leads to the formation of a large organic layer separating the neighbouring inorganic corner sharing octahedral networks.46,47 We utilised N,N′-dimethyl-1,2-ethanediamine (DMEDA, (CH3NH)2C2H4) as an organic cation; combined with PbI42− octahedron networks, a 1D crystal structure is formed, and the diagram is shown in Fig. 1(a). This is confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), (crystallographic data is shown in Fig. 1(b) and Table S1, ESI†). It can be seen that the PbI42− is caged by DMEDA2+ networks forming a 1D nanowire-like structure with the chemical formula of C4H14N2PbI4. We performed first principles calculation based on the SCXRD measurement, and the results also support the result indicating that the PbI42− octahedron can only connect with each other in one direction. This structure is supposed to be more effective in inhibiting the ion migration than the commonly used 2D structure HOIP.

In order to exclude the influence of trap states, we fabricated photodetection devices directly on the facet of the single crystal. The gold electrodes were thermally evaporated through a mask, as shown in Fig. 1(c). The absorption of DMEDAPbI4 is presented in Fig. 1(d); it can be seen that the absorbance of this material starts from 580 nm and a feature appears at 530 nm, which corresponds to the excitonic absorption. Photons with shorter wavelengths are absorbed strongly by this material. These results are supported by the first principles calculation as shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen an indirect bandgap structure is determined with a band gap of around 2 eV, suggesting that the absorbance starts from 620 nm, which is consistent with the experimental results in Fig. 1(d). It is worth noting that the absorption range is relatively blue-shifted compared with those of regular HOIP materials containing Pb and I elements (such as MAPbI348). We speculate that the unique 1D structure restricted the absorption of this perovskite single crystal; we found that the reported DMEDAPbBr4 single crystal absorption is below 400 nm,49 which is also much shorter than that of well-known HOIP with Pb and Br elements. We noticed a bismuth (Bi)-based perovskite material employing DMEDA as the organic part determines different behavior regarding the absorption;50 a possible reason for this is that Bi is a larger element compared with Pb, and in the BiI52− there is an extra I atom, which makes the BiI52− larger and it cannot be wrapped by the organic chains as tightly as in the case of PbI42−, thus influencing the absorption spectra. In the simulation, the calculated band gap is the electric band gap, which is normally smaller than the optical band gap, and the strong signal in the high energy part mainly comes from the inter-band electronic transitions of the kind from Pb2+(6s)I−(5p) to Pb2+(6p).51

The photo-responsibility of the photodetector is shown in Fig. 3; it can be seen that under the illumination of a 473 nm laser, the currents across the two electrodes increase dramatically, and an on–off ratio of over 103 is obtained under a bias of 30 V, providing the light power of 71 μW. Another feature that is worth noting is that the currents increase linearly with a bias voltage of up to 30 V at a certain exposure power, indicating good ohmic contact between the electrodes and the DMEDAPbI4 single crystal. As expected, negligible hysteresis is presented in the current voltage curves suggesting that the 1D structure restricts the ion migration effectively and the trap states density of the single crystal is low. To further verify the photo-responsivity of the DMEDAPbI4 single crystal-based photodetector, we employed lasers with wavelengths of 360, 405 and 632 nm respectively, as the light source. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the responsivity to 360 nm and 405 nm light exposure is similar to the scenario of 473 nm. However, the 632 nm laser has no effect to induce extra charge carriers. These results are not surprising considering the absorbance and the band gap structure shown in Fig. 1 and 2. From Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S1 (ESI†), it can be seen that our photodetection devices illustrate negligible hysteresis and ohmic current voltage behaviours over a large wavelength range.

(b) Photocurrent generation under different biased voltages. (c) Temporal photocurrent response of the DMEDAPbI4 single crystal photodetector. (d) A zoomed-in curve of a single on–off circulation. 
To obtain insight into the photoresponse behaviour, we calculated the responsivity (R) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the photodetectors. R is referred to as the photocurrent generated per unit of incident light power, and expressed as eqn (1). (1)EQE is defined as the number of charge carriers in the external circuit generated by each incident photon, and can be calculated as: (2)
Based on the current voltage curves, R and EQE of the photodetector can be determined, and the results are summarised in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The photodetectors show clear responsivity to 360, 405 and 473 nm lasers, while the 632 nm laser induces negligible current, which is consistent with the absorbance of DMEDAPbI4. The responsivity and EQE for the 473 nm photon reach 80 mA W−1 and 30%, respectively, and the values almost have negligible dependence on the incident power as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
Another figure of merit for the photosensors is the photosensitivity linearity or linear dynamic range (LDR), which is given as: (3)
The LDR of our device is determined to be around 40 dB. Considering the fact that our photocurrent is still unsaturated, the value should be larger. This result suggests the potential of our photodetector in high-contrast applications.
To deepen our understanding on the origin of the ohmic shape of the current voltage curves, we carried out ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements to determine the energy level of the DMEDAPbI4 single crystal. As shown in Fig. 4, the valence band is determined to be around 5.0 eV, which is quite similar to the work function of gold (being 5.1 eV). This finding enables us to attribute the ohmic behaviour of the photoresponse to the good alignment of the energy levels of the DMEDAPbI4 single crystal and the gold electrodes.

Another key parameter for the photodetector is the response speed. It is defined by the rise time (tr, photocurrent increases from 10% to 90% of the peak value) and drop time (td, photocurrent decreases from 90% to 10% of the peak value). From Fig. 3(c and d), the tr and td can be extracted, being less than 0.4 ms.
To investigate the photoinduced charge generation process, we performed pump–probe experiments. The optical density change is illustrated in Fig. 5, and it can be seen that the broad bleaching feature appears almost immediately after the pump, with the time scale in the range of picoseconds. More importantly, the photoinduced absorption (PIA) in the wavelength range of over 700 nm appears also in the same time range as ground state bleaching, this PIA is considered as the absorption of polaron and free charge carriers. These results suggest that the charge carrier generation is not the restriction of photocurrent generation. But for a deeper investigation, more theoretical and experimental work is needed.

To further examine the performance of the photodetector, we repeated the photoresponse test after 90 days of ambient storage. The devices were stored in a normal optical lab with the temperature range of 20–25 °C and humidity of 30–40%. It can be seen in Fig. S4 (ESI†), about 85% of its original photocurrent generation ability is retained and the response speed showed no degradation, indicating the promising stability of the photodetectors. This finding is encouraging for practical application of this 1D HOIP material. We speculate that the good stability is also a benefit from its special structure, in which the unstable PbI42− is wrapped by the organic chains.
3. Conclusion
To summarise, we designed and synthesised a HOIP single crystal with 1D crystalline structure, based on which we fabricated photodetectors. Due to the low dimensional structure-induced quantum size restriction and low trap states density, the photodetector shows negligible hysteresis current–voltage curves. We examined the energy level of the single crystal, and find it well aligned with the work function of gold, resulting in a perfect ohmic current–voltage dependence. Furthermore, we proved that the stability of the devices is promising under ambient conditions. Our results suggest a routine method to fabricate highly reliable fast-response photodetectors based on HOIP with neither hysteresis nor contact limitation.
Experiments

Materials. 
All the chemicals were purchased from commercial vendors; DMEDA, and hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in H2O solution) were from J&K Inc; PbO was from Sigma-Aldrich; toluene was from Aladdin Inc.


Synthesis and crystal structure determination of DMEDAPbI4 single crystal. 
Lead(II) oxide (75 mg) was dissolved in 5 ml of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in H2O solution) mixed with 0.2 ml of hypophosphorous acid and heated at 90 °C with vigorous stirring for 60 min to obtain a clear solution. Then 38 μl of DMEDA was added into the solution and the resultant suspension was heated at 160 °C with vigorous stirring for 90 min. A clear yellow solution was obtained. Then the solution was slowly cooled down to 80 °C at a rate of 3 °C h−1 and kept at 80 °C for 20 h. The single crystals of DMEDAPbI4 were obtained at the bottom of the vial. The crystals were washed with toluene, and dried under reduced pressure before use. The yield of the product is around 50%, calculated according to the lead element.
The single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) characterisation of DMEDAPbI4 was performed using an Agilent Supernova single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a two-dimensional ATLAS detector employing Cu Kα radiation. The crystal structure was solved using the Olex crystallographic software package.


Device fabrication. 
The photodetector was fabricated by evaporating 80 nm gold film as the electrode directly on the surface of the single crystal. A gold wire with a diameter of 100 μm was employed as the shadow to define the area of the conducting channel, resulting in a channel length of 100 μm and the channel width was defined by the dimension of the single crystal, being around 600 μm.


Photoresponse characterisation. 
The electrical properties were measured on a probe station (Lakeshore, TTP4), and the data were collected by an Agilent semiconductor parameter analyser. The optoelectronic properties were measured using 360, 405 and 473 nm lasers (beam spot diameter of 0.30 cm) and a neutral density filter to control the power density. All the electrical and optoelectronic measurements were conducted under vacuum (10−4 mbar) to avoid the possible effects of air.


UPS measurement. 
UPS experiments were performed using a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi UPS/XPS photoelectron spectrometer with He I (21.22) eV photon lines. Binding energies were calibrated by measuring the Fermi step position and the Au 4f7/2 core level of a clean gold film.


Transient absorption measurements. 
The TA measurements were carried out using a femtosecond pump–probe system, where a femtosecond laser (Legend Elite Series, Coherent Inc.) at 800 nm with a reputation rate of 1 kHz and pulse width of 150 fs was used as the pump light after frequency-doubling by a β-barium borate crystal, producing 400 nm pulses. A supercontinuum was generated by focusing a small portion of 800 nm femtosecond laser pulse to heavy water in a cuvette and used as the probe.


First principles calculation. 
The computations were performed using the first principles calculation implementation of CASTEP.52 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)53 with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formula54 was used for the exchange–correlation potential. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method was used to search for the ground state of the unit cell, and the convergence tolerance was set to the energy change below 10−5 eV per atom, force less than 0.03 eV Å−1, stress less than 0.05 GPa and displacement change less than 0.001 Å. The cut-off energy of the atomic wave functions was set to 450 eV.
