    , Accepted 21st October 2014First published on 22nd October 2014AbstractOrgano metal halide perovskite has attracted considerable attention recently due to its distinctive properties that make it especially useful in photovoltaic solar cells. In this work we demonstrate high open circuit voltage of 1.35 V using Al2O3/CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite solar cells without a hole conductor. The contact potential difference under light measured by surface photovoltage spectroscopy of CH3NH3PbBr3 was more than twice that of CH3NH3PbI3, which results in smaller surface potential for the Al2O3/CH3NH3PbBr3 cells. Incident modulated photovoltage spectroscopy shows a longer recombination lifetime for the Al2O3/CH3NH3PbBr3 cells than for the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 cells or for the TiO2/CH3NH3PbBr3 cells, further supporting the high open circuit voltage. The possibility to gain high open circuit voltage even without a hole transport material in perovskite solar cells shows that the perovskite/metal oxide interface has a major effect on the open circuit voltage in perovskite based solar cells.
Introduction
Alternative energy is an important research area and will remain so for the foreseeable future, and photovoltaics (PV) is a key technology for a sustainable energy supply. A PV device is based on the photoelectric effect, requiring photo-generation of charge carriers (electrons and holes) in a light-absorbing material and their separation to conductive contacts that transmit electricity. A breakthrough has occurred in recent years as a promising new material, organo metal halide perovskite, is being used in the solar cells, achieving approximately 18% efficiency.1 Interestingly, the perovskite isn't restricted to a specific solar cell architecture and can be used with different metal oxides; where injection of electrons is possible and where the metal oxide functions as a scaffold.2–4 Moreover, a long-range electron–hole diffusion length was found in an organo metal perovskite absorber, which might explain the high efficiency achieved for perovskite based solar cells.5,6 Other reports demonstrate that the use of the perovskite both as a light harvester and as a hole conductor; eliminating the use of hole transport material (HTM) and achieving more than 10% efficiency.7–9
One of the attractive properties of organo metal halide perovskite is its ability to gain high open circuit voltage (Voc) with a high ratio of qVoc/Eg. Voc of 1.15 V was achieved with a cell that used CH3NH3PbBr3 as sensitizer/absorber, with poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-3,6-bis-(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-dioctyl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PCBTDPP) as the hole transport material.10 An even higher open circuit voltage of 1.3 V was the result when using N,N′-dialkylperylenediimide (PDI) as the hole transport material with CH3NH3PbBr3 as the sensitizer/absorber.11 Recently 1.5 V was reported when using CH3NH3PbBr3−xClx with 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP) as the hole conductor.12 Both high efficiency (6.7%) and high voltage (1.4 V) was demonstrated with hole transport material based on tri-arylamine (TAA) polymer derivatives containing fluorene and indenofluorene.13 All the reports mentioned, relating to high voltage based on perovskite use hole transport material to tune and to gain high Voc. However, is it possible to get high Voc without hole transport material? Based on recent reports,12,13 the voltage in the perovskite solar cells isn't determined simply by the difference between the TiO2 Fermi level and the Fermi level of the HTM. Therefore, it could be that high Voc can be achieved in perovskite based solar cells even without HTM.
In this work, we demonstrate a high Voc of 1.35 V for perovskite solar cells without a hole conductor. Several combinations of metal oxides/perovskites are studied. Surface photovoltage and incident modulated photovoltage spectroscopy are used to elucidate the reason for the high voltage achieved for these hole conductor free cells.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a schematic illustration of the high voltage hole conductor free perovskite solar cell. The bottom layer is composed of conductive glass with a TiO2 compact layer; then a thin film of nanocrystalline metal oxide TiO2 or Al2O3 was deposited on top. The CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbBr3 (CH3NH3 = MA) perovskites were deposited by the two-step deposition as described earlier.14,15 Finally, a metal contact was evaporated directly on top of the perovskite. As our previous work shows,9 the perovskite functions both as light harvester and hole conductor, eliminating the use of a hole transport material.

Fig. 1b–d and Table 1 present the photovoltaic parameters and the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) achieved for the high voltage cells. Four different combinations were studied—nanocrystalline TiO2 with MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, and nanocrystalline Al2O3 with both perovskites. The open circuit voltage (Voc) for the cells with the MAPbBr3 perovskite delivers higher voltages compared to the cells with the MAPbI3 perovskite related to the same metal oxide. Moreover, the cells with Al2O3 achieve higher Voc compared to the TiO2 based cells. The highest Voc observed for the Al2O3/MAPbBr3 configuration achieved 1.35 V without a hole conductor. This is the highest reported open circuit voltage for perovskite cells without a hole conductor and is comparable to cells using hole transport material. It is important to note that the average Voc (including more than 11 cells) for the Al2O3/MAPbBr3 configuration is 1.24 ± 0.08 V with 4 cells having Voc of more than 1.3 V and 4 cells with Voc higher than 1.21 V.

High power conversion efficiency (PCE) with high voltage was observed for the Al2O3/MAPbI3 configuration achieving PCE of 4.1% with Voc of 1 V. The IPCE spectra show typical behavior with coverage until 550 nm wavelength for the MAPbBr3 and until 780 nm wavelength for the MAPbI3.

Fig. 2a–b show the energy level diagram for the four different cases described in this paper. Fig. 2a presents the MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 deposited on Al2O3, which function as a scaffold; electron injection from the perovskite to the Al2O3 isn't possible in this configuration. Fig. 2b presents the MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 with TiO2, where electron injection from the perovskite to the TiO2 is favorable. Surface photovoltage (SPV) was used to measure the work function of the Al2O3, TiO2, MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3; the calculated work functions are shown as red lines in Fig. 2. The work function positions (which are the Fermi level positions) correspond well to the p-type behavior of the MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 perovskites, and the n-type behavior of the TiO2 as discussed below. Fig. 2c and d show the corresponding high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) cross sections of the Al2O3/MAPbI3 and Al2O3/MAPbBr3 HTM free cells, the perovskite over layer can be observed clearly. The HR-SEM cross sections of the TiO2 based cells are shown in the ESI. (Fig. 2S†)

Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy and incident modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were performed to gain more information about the reason for the high open circuit voltage when no HTM is used. Previous studies already demonstrate high Voc in perovskite cells contain HTM. It was suggested that the Voc is not merely the difference between the hole Fermi level of the hole conductor and the electron Fermi level of the nanocrystalline TiO2.13,16 Moreover, it was reported that charges could be accumulated in the perovskite due to its high capacitance, which allows the control of the quasi Fermi level during illumination.17
The SPV technique is based on a Kelvin probe, which measures the difference in work functions (also known as the contact potential difference (CPD)) between a metallic reference probe and semiconductor surface. The metallic probe vibrates, which forms a capacitor arrangement between the reference electrode and the semiconductor (the distance between them is a few millimeter). This results in an AC current in the external circuit. If there is no charge on the capacitor, the AC current is zero. In this case, the CPD must be zero. The AC current nullifies when a DC bias is applied. Thus, the applied DC bias is equal and opposite to the CPD (please see Fig. 3S in the ESI† for schematic explanation).
The SPV spectra of the MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 are shown in Fig. 3a, with the estimated band gaps shown as vertical lines. Several observations result from the SPV spectra (Fig. 3a). First, the spectra provide information about the band gaps of the materials, equivalent to the information observed from the absorption spectra (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Second, the sign of the SPV signal indicates the samples type. The surface work function is changed on illumination. It decreases for the n-type semiconductor—TiO2 in this case—and increases for the p-type semiconductor, the MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 in this case. A third important observation is related to the unique property of the SPV method, its immunity to reflection or scattering losses, only photons that are absorbed in the sample contribute to the SPV signal. In this case the signal onset starts at photon energies very close to the band gap of the perovskite samples (the MAPbI3 and the MAPbBr3), and as a result, it can be concluded that the perovskite samples have fewer sub-bandgap states. The relation qVoc/Eg is the ratio of the maximum voltage developed by the solar cell (Voc) to the voltage related to the band-gap of the absorber (Eg/q). For the Al2O3/MAPbBr3 cell the qVoc/Eg is 0.61, compared to recent reports of high voltage perovskite cells with HTM shown as qVoc/Eg of 0.55 and 0.73.11,12 Our results demonstrate comparable values with respect to the values obtained with HTM.

(c) The effect of band-to-band transitions on the surface photovoltage responses of MAPbBr3 and (d) MAPbI3. Vsd-surface potential in the dark, Vsl-surface potential in the light. 
The qVoc/Eg relation in the case of the Al2O3 based cells are 0.64 and 0.61 for the MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively, and for the TiO2 based cells, 0.55 and 0.37 for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively. Based on these values it can be observed that the Al2O3/MAPbBr3 based cells have slightly more thermal losses than the Al2O3/MAPbI3 cells, moreover high thermal losses were observed in the TiO2 based cell compared to the Al2O3 based cells.

Fig. 3b presents the contact potential difference (CPD) change when a light is switched on and off. The SPV onset ton and toff are below the resolution limit of the measurement system. Our observations from these measurements are related to the change in the CPD—for the TiO2 sample, a negative change in the CPD was observed, while for the perovskites samples, a positive change in the CPD was observed, corresponding to their electronic behavior. The ΔCPD for the MAPbI3 is 350 mV and the ΔCPD for the MAPbBr3 is 850 mV.
The VS presented in Fig. 3c and d is the surface potential barrier (where Vsd is the surface potential in the dark and Vsl is the surface potential in the light), which was measured in the SPV experiment. The difference between the surface potential in the light (Vsl) and in the dark (Vsd) is defined as the SPV signal. In a super band gap, illumination photons with energy equal or larger than the band gap, hit the material and generate electron–hole pairs which is collected by the surface barrier, consequently the surface potential is reduced. The trap to band transition is neglected in super band gap illumination while the band-to-band absorption is the dominant one.

Fig. 3c and d shows the effect of band-to-band transition on the SPV response of MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3, respectively. Under illumination, there is redistribution of surface charges, which decrease the band bending, and as a result the SPV response is generated. According to the ΔCPD shown in Fig. 3b the surface potential for the MAPbBr3 is smaller than the surface potential for the MAPbI3 as indicated by the bi directional arrow in Fig. 3c and d, respectively (this is also seen by the bend bending reduction, since the difference between Vsl to Vsd is larger in the case of MAPbBr3). The reduction of the surface potential observed from the SPV measurements for the HTM free MAPbBr3 cells, could be a possible contribution to the higher Voc achieved for these cells.
Further contribution to the difference in the open circuit voltage is presented in Fig. 4. The recombination lifetime (τr) as a function of the voltage were calculated by IMVS.18–20 All cells showed the same dependence of electron recombination lifetime (which are the minority carriers) by the voltage; the decrease of the recombination lifetime with increasing the voltage. This behavior can be attributed to the increased recombination with the higher electron density.18 However, the τr values are different for the various cells; in particular, the lower τr values were observed for the TiO2/MAPbI3 cell, which also had the lower Voc. The highest τr values were observed for the Al2O3/MAPbBr3 cell which resulted in less recombination (since the lifetime for recombination is longer) corresponding with the highest voltage observed. Longer recombination lifetime (τr) will decrease the recombination which can result in higher Voc.21,22 In addition, longer recombination lifetimes were observed for the cells with the Al2O3 as the scaffold, compared to cells with mesoporous TiO2, which could contribute to the higher voltages observed in the case of Al2O3 based cells. This is consistent with the qVoc/Eg relation as discussed above, where more thermal losses were observed for cells based on TiO2 as the metal oxide compare to Al2O3 based cells.

Conclusions
In this work, high voltage of 1.35 V was observed for hole conductor free perovskite solar cells. SPV and IMVS techniques were used to elucidate the origin of the high voltage observed. The Fermi level position and the SPV spectra of the MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 reveal the p-type behavior of these perovskites. The CPD change when light was switched on and off was higher by a factor of 2.5 for the MAPbBr3 cells compared to the MAPbI3 cells. The change in the CPD during illumination resulted in smaller surface potential for the Al2O3/MAPbBr3 cells which could contribute to the higher open circuit voltage achieved in the MAPbBr3 cells. Further support was observed by longer recombination lifetime for the Al2O3 based cells, compared to cells with mesoporous TiO2. The high open circuit voltage observed in cells without a hole conductor indicates that the origin of the open circuit voltage is affected by the perovskite and the perovskite/metal oxide interface.
Experimental
Material synthesis
The Al2O3 nanoparticles (<50 nm particle size, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in isopropanol at a concentration of 20 wt%. The Al2O3 nanoparticles were deposited by spin coating at 2000 r.p.m. for 10 s and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. For the TiO2 films DYESOL DSL 90-T paste was used. The TiO2 paste was diluted in ethanol in a ratio of 1:4 by weight. The deposition and the annealing conditions were the same as for the Al2O3.
CH3NH3I and CH3NH3Br were synthesized as described previously23,24 by reacting 30 mL of methylamine (40% in methanol, TCI) and 32.3 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) or 23.32 mL of hydrobromic acid (48 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 mL round bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The precipitate was recovered by putting the solution on a rotavap and carefully removing the solvents at 50 °C. The product of methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) or methylammonium bromide (CH3NH3Br) was washed with ethanol by stirring the mixture for 30 min. Then, the mixture was filtered and washed three times with diethylether. After filtration, the solid was collected and dried at 70 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
Device fabrication
The substrate of the device was a SNO2: F (FTO) conducting glass (15 Ω cm−1), Pilkington. A blocking layer was deposited on the FTO glass using a solution of titanium diisopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate) (TiDIP, 75% in isopropanol, Aldrich) in ethanol. The TiDIP solution was spin coated and then annealed at 450 °C for 35 min. The TiO2 solution or the Al2O3 solution was spin coated and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min, subsequent to TiCl4 treatment for 30 min at 70 °C and annealing at 500 °C for 30 min.
The synthesis of the CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3PbBr3 on the TiO2 surface was carried out by a two-step deposition technique.
First, PbI2 or PbBr2 was dissolved in DMF and dropped onto the TiO2 or the Al2O3 film and spin coated, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 30 min. In the second step, the cell was dipped into methylammonium solution. Following the dipping step, the samples were annealed at 70 °C for another 30 min. Finally, the back contact was deposited by evaporating 50 nm of gold under pressure of 5 × 10−6 Torr. The active area was 0.09 cm2.
Photovoltaic characterization
Photovoltaic measurements were made on a New Port system, composed of an Oriel I–V test station using an Oriel Sol3A simulator. The solar simulator is class AAA for spectral performance, uniformity of irradiance, and temporal stability. The solar simulator is equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp. The output power is adjusted to match AM1.5 global sunlight (100 mW cm−2). The spectral match classifications are IEC60904-9 2007, JIC C 8912, and ASTM E927-05. I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. Oriel IQE-200 was used to determine the monochromatic incident photon-to-electric current conversion efficiency. Under full computer control, light from a 150 W xenon arc lamp was focused through a monochromator in the 300–1800 nm wavelength range onto the photovoltaic cell under the test. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ) as defined by IPCE (λ) = 12400 (Jsc/λφ), where λ is the wavelength, Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density (mA cm−2), and φ is the incident radiative flux (mW cm−2). Photovoltaic performance was measured by using a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.09 cm2.
Surface photovoltage
Surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) and work function were performed using the SKP5050-SPS040 system. The contact potential difference (CPD) between the sample and the vibrating tip was measured by the Kelvin probe technique. Samples were measured in a Faraday cage under air environment. For SPS measurements, the samples were illuminated with a 150 W quartz tungsten halogen lamp. The wavelength resolution was 2 nm. Before the measurement, samples were stabilized with a tip for about one hour. The scan direction was from long to short wavelength. The WF was calculated according to:WFsample = WFtip − CPD(tip–sample).
The WF function of the tip was calibrated above the gold stage.
Intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy
The photocarrier recombination times at open circuit were measured by intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). The IMVS measurements were performed with the Autolab FRA32M LED driver using a cool white light source, illuminating from the substrate side. The photovoltaic cells were illuminated with a bias light intensity with a 10% sinusoidal wave modulation, with frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 20 kHz.

High resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). 
The images were obtained using Sirion HR-SEM of FEI (Field Emission Instruments), The Netherlands. The measurement conditions were 5 kV at various magnifications, as seen on the data bar of the images.
