    , Accepted 1st January 2020First published on 3rd January 2020AbstractMicro-nanostructures, element doping and structural defects are three pivotal factors that determine the photocatalytic activity of the graphitic carbon nitride polymer. Green and additive-free construction of the above three-in-one carbon nitride (CN) based materials is extremely challenging. Herein the target hierarchical carbon nitride tube with a pipe-in-pipe double-layer and porous coral-like architecture as well as oxygen doping and carbon defects is successfully obtained via a self-templating method. Melamine is the only precursor in the whole process, and there are no harmful solvents or cross-linking agents used for self-assembly with cyanuric acid, which comes from melamine under hydrothermal treatment. Surpassing the simple hollow carbon nitride tube, this hierarchical hollow structure, which is clearly visualized by 3D electron tomography, offers more contact sites and creates new heterogeneous catalytic interfaces synergistically. Hence, the as-prepared photocatalyst achieves a satisfactory hydrogen yield, ascribed to the large surface area, short charge transfer distance, light scattering, fast mass transfer and suitable bandgap with midgap states. This eco-friendly method provides a new opportunity for designing novel micro-nanostructures with desirable performance in solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
Introduction
Nanostructure engineering in photocatalysts is a challenging but fascinating approach for improving their photocatalytic properties.1,2 With unique structures, photocatalysts can exert a significant effect on the basic steps of photocatalysis. As a metal-free polymer photocatalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (denoted as CN) is bound to be a hot candidate for efficient solar energy conversion because of its high thermal and chemical stability and a suitable bandgap for water splitting.3–5 Unfortunately, bulk CN obtained by a direct thermal polymerization process is generally limited by its relatively low surface area, insufficient solar light absorbance, limited charge transfer distance and slow mass transfer, which significantly restrict its applications.6,7 So far, the fabrication of hierarchical micro-nanostructures and element doping have been confirmed as two effective methods to enhance the photocatalytic activity. However, most of the reported micro-nanostructured (i.e. helical, spherical and tubular) CNs are obtained through a hard-templating approach, which requires the use of hazardous reagents to remove the template for further functionalization.8–11 Moreover, in the element (i.e. phosphorus and boron) doping process, a strong acid and aromatic hydrocarbon are also introduced to the molecular structure of CN, which is environmentally unfriendly.10–12 Therefore, it is still urgent to construct desirable eco-friendly photocatalysts by avoiding the time-consuming and cost-inefficient templating approach and hazardous reagents.
Pre-treatment of precursors via a supramolecular preorganization strategy by hydrogen bonding has been widely utilized to prepare specially shaped CN with micro-nanostructures,3,13–16 where the melamine–cyanuric acid complex is universally used as a starting material to construct ordered and hollow CN structures.3,17,18 One of the pioneering studies on this complex as the precursor of CN was first reported by Jun and co-workers. Mesoporous CN hollow spheres were thereby obtained from thermal polymerization of flower-like and layered spherical supramolecular complex structures.18 Additionally, by adding appropriate organic monomers during precipitation one can tailor the micro-nanostructure finely. Very recently, Jiang et al. fabricated two kinds of P-doped carbon nitride tubes from a supramolecular precursor synthesized in situ from a single melamine molecular source via a sodium pyrophosphate or phosphorous acid-assisted hydrothermal process, respectively, as melamine could be transformed into cyanuric acid through hydrolysis.10,11 Furthermore, a new crystal precursor strategy is emerging for designing nanostructured CN.19–21 But additives are still employed to achieve chemical doping in this method. In these circumstances, constructing novel hierarchical micro-nanostructured CN with simultaneous eco-friendly nonmetal element doping is extremely challenging. Besides, the moderate defects are vital factors for accelerating the separation and transfer of photocharges, which could act as trap sites and tune the energy band structure of CN photocatalysts with strong electrophilicity for promoting the surface adsorption and reduction of H+.12,22–24 In this case, further introducing special point defects into micro-nanostructured CN with chemical doping is undoubtedly more difficult.
Herein, a green fabrication process of oxygen-doped carbon nitride tubes with a pipe-in-pipe double-layer (PCN) and carbon defects is reported (illustrated in Scheme 1), and it does not involve the use of any harmful solvents or cross-linking agents. Subsequently, the hierarchical pipe-in-pipe carbon nitride with a porous bionic coral-like architecture (PCNC) is synthesized via a self-templating method. Briefly, melamine as the single precursor was thoroughly dissolved in deionized water upon heating. Then, melamine could recrystallize under ultrasonic conditions. A suitable hydrothermal process at a controlled temperature contributed to the in situ transformation of melamine into cyanuric acid. Then the resulting hexagonal cylinder precursors turned into PCN under thermal treatment. Additionally, as a self-template, PCN was mixed with melamine to form PCNC by repeating the above process. The resulting PCNC possesses a hierarchical coral-like micronanostructure to enhance the visible-light photocatalytic properties.

Experimental methods
Preparation of photocatalysts
The control CN was obtained via the following approach. Typically, 5 g melamine was placed in an alumina crucible with a cover followed by thermal decomposition at 550 °C for 3 h in a N2 flow with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. After cooling down, the as-prepared yellow product was ground and collected for further use.
PCN was obtained as follows. Typically, 2 g melamine was thoroughly dissolved in 140 mL deionized water at 70 °C and then subjected to a cold water bath with ultrasonication to recrystallize the melamine. The obtained suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 12 h in an oven. After cooling down, a white product was collected by filtration and dried at 60 °C for further use. The next procedure was the same as that for CN synthesis.
PCNC was synthesized by a self-templating strategy, in which 20 mg PCN as the template was added into melamine solution before the hydrothermal process. The subsequent pyrolysis was identical to the process for preparing CN.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization of CN samples was conducted under an FEI Tecnai F30 microscope at 300 kV. The 3D morphology of the specimens was further investigated by electron tomography: the CN powder was directly dispersed on a 100 mesh carbon coated copper grid, and tilt-series images over a tilt range of around ±70° with a 2° increment were acquired in high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode using a Fischione 2020 tomography holder in an FEI Talos F200X microscope operated at 200 kV. Alignment of the tilt-series was performed by the cross-correlation method in IMOD25 and further reconstructed using the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) in Inspect3D v4.4 (FEI Company). The resultant tomograms had a final voxel size of 2.15 or 4.29 nm, depending on the magnification of the original STEM images, and were input into Avizo v9.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 3D image analysis. A Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) was used to obtain SEM images. The elemental composition was determined using an elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA-50 (Shimadzu). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku SmartLab system at 45 kV and 200 mA with Cu-Kα radiation. Solid-state 13C NMR was performed using a Bruker Advance III 600 spectrometer. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded with a Micromeritics Model ASAP 2020 instrument at 77 K for surface area analysis. Bruker VERTEX 70 spectrophotometers were used to perform Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Surface chemical analysis was carried out using an XPS with Al K X-rays radiation operated at 300 W (XPS: Kratos XSAM800 spectrometer, USA). UV-vis absorbance spectra were obtained on a Scan UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 750S) in the range of 200–800 nm. Steady-state photoluminescence spectra were acquired using an Edinburgh spectrometer at λex = 380 nm. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker EMXPlus-10/12-3.8k spectrometer at a microwave frequency of 9.8 GHz in the dark and under UV light, respectively.
Photoelectrochemical analysis
Photoelectrochemical analysis, including Mott–Schottky analysis, transient photocurrent response measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), was performed on a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode cell consisting of Pt wire, a Ag/AgCl electrode and 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as the counter electrode, reference electrode and supporting electrolyte, respectively. Working electrodes were obtained by transferring photocatalyst suspensions (5 mg in 1 mL ethanol with 100 μL 0.05 wt% Nafion solution) onto glassy carbon electrodes using a dispensing method. Mott–Schottky plots were obtained with the potentials ranging from 0 V to 1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at 1000 Hz and 1500 Hz, respectively. The photocurrent was obtained under warm white light (3200 K) generated by a fully automatic 10 W LED lamp. And the frequency for EIS was set from 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz.
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution tests
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution tests were carried out using an online photocatalytic hydrogen production system (CEL-SPH2N, CEAULIGHT, Beijing). Typically, 20 mg catalyst was suspended in 50 mL of aqueous solution containing 10 mL triethanolamine as the sacrificial electron donor and 3 wt% Pt as a co-catalyst. The suspension was thoroughly degassed and irradiated under a 300 W Xe lamp (CEAULIGHT CEL-HXF300, Beijing) with a 420 nm filter. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate was determined by using an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, TCD detector, N2 carrier, 5 Å molecular sieve column, Shimadzu). For the stability test, the system was evacuated every 5 h and measurements were repeated 5 times (i.e., a 25 h recycling experiment with intermittent evacuation every 5 h).
Computational methods
All the calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Software Package (VASP 5.3.5) code within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation and the projected augmented wave (PAW) method. The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis set was set to 400 eV. The ultrasoft pseudo-potential was employed to describe the interaction between valence electrons and the ionic core. Monkhorst–Pack special k-point meshes of 3 × 3 × 1 were proposed to carry out geometry optimization and electronic structure calculation. During the geometry optimization, all atoms were allowed to relax without any constraints until the convergence thresholds of maximum force and energy were smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1 and 1.0 × 10−5 eV per atom, respectively. A vacuum layer of 12 Å was introduced to avoid interactions between periodic images. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional was used to obtain the accurate density of states.
Results and discussion
As shown in the SEM images (Fig. 1B and C), supramolecular precursors for PCN and PCNC possess a hexagonal rod structure, differing from the bulk melamine (Fig. 1A). These precursors were well characterized by FT-IR and XRD in Fig. S1† for the new supramolecular structures. PCN (Fig. 1E) with a length of up to 100–300 μm and a diameter of 0.5–2 μm exhibits a vimineous hollow tube, confirmed by TEM in Fig. 1I, while PCNC (Fig. 1F) has an expansile diameter of 2–3 μm with a discriminable structure inside (clearly shown in Fig. 1J). This internal bionic coral-like architecture (Scheme 1) also has lots of holes, providing abundant adsorption sites for reactants. Besides, the high-magnification images in Fig. 1I and J reveal that PCN and PCNC have a number of pores within the 40–60 nm range embedded in the tube wall due to the structural shrinkage. It can be inferred that their whole structures are loose and porous for high accessibility of catalytic sites. Melamine, cyanuric acid and supramolecular precursors for PCN and PCNC were also analyzed by TGA (Fig. S2†). With the release of gases including NH3, NO2, NO, and N2O/CO2, the polymerization is incomplete and so the porous tube wall can be formed. For PCNC, the core PCN fragments are wrapped in the melamine precursor, which could be further decomposed and entangled during thermal treatment. These structures were analyzed using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Fig. S3A†). The typical peak at 27.5° of CN, suggesting the presence of tri-s-triazine units stacked in a perpendicular direction via π–π interactions,4 shifts slightly to a higher angle (27.9°) in PCN and PCNC. The decreasing interlayer spacing can shorten the charge transfer distance for rapid migration of excited electrons to surface reaction sites. The FT-IR results in Fig. S3B† show that the three samples have similar characteristic stretching vibration modes of CN heterocycles at 1240–1640 cm−1.26 The wide peaks at 3000–3500 cm−1 representing N–H and O–H stretching vibrations exhibit stronger intensity in PCN and PCNC, indicating the presence of more hydroxyl and amino groups after the morphology change.26 Besides, the peak at 806 cm−1 in CN blue-shifts to 814 cm−1 in PCN and PCNC probably due to the broken conjugated tri-s-triazine units with defects and oxygen dopants.27,28 These assumptions were further confirmed by the room temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra in Fig. S3C.† The three samples exhibit one single Lorentzian line with a g value of 2.0034, owing to the unpaired electrons on the sp2-carbon in the aromatic rings.29,30 Obviously, the peaks of PCN and PCNC show much lower intensity than those of the reference under dark and light conditions. The immediate cause is that the formation of oxygen-enriched structures by substituting the nitrogen of the triazine ring leads to a decreased unpaired electron density.22,31,32 Additionally, the structural defects disturb the conjugated tri-s-triazine units, which also affects the electron delocalization. Solid-state 13C magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were also used to prove the presence of oxygen doping in Fig. S3D.† The three samples have the same signals at 156.6 ppm, representing the chemical shifts of CN3.33 The low field shift in the peaks of CN2–NHx in PCN (162.5 ppm) and PCNC (163.5 ppm) compared to that in CN (164.8 ppm) means that the strong electron-withdrawing effect of oxygen influences the chemical environment of carbon.27,34,35

To obtain the BET surface area and pore information on the porous tubular structure, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore-size distributions of PCN and PCNC were measured and are shown in Fig. S4.† The type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops indicate the presence of a mesoporous structure, and the surface areas of PCN (42.75 m2 g−1) and PCNC (61.44 m2 g−1) are about 4 and 6 times higher than that of CN (10.15 m2 g−1), respectively. The pore diameter range in PCN and PCNC is from about 2.9 nm to 32.1 nm, which supports the evidence in SEM and TEM images (Fig. 1). The 3D morphology of PCN and PCNC is further revealed by electron tomography analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 2. There is a double-layered shell for the PCN and the inner-layer is rougher than the outer-layer, where some bubbles (highlighted by red arrows) are also observed in the interior space of PCN (Fig. 2A). In the case of PCNC, a rod-like framework is found along the long axis of PCNC and its high porosity (highlighted by red arrows) is also demonstrated by the cross-sectional slices along and perpendicular to the long axis (Fig. 2B). The convincing formation mechanism of the double-layered tubes is associated with the preferential pyrolysis or etching of the center of the rods due to the high density of defects after quickly crystallizing at the early stage of hydrothermal reaction; at the same time, the whole hexagonal rod structures could shrink as both the hexagonal structures collapse in the cross-sectional slices of PCN and PCNC after thermal treatment. The temperature difference between the inside and outside leads to different degrees of contraction, causing the formation of a double-layered structure. Electron tomography has provided further clarification of the inner structure of PCN and PCNC materials leading to their high surface areas in addition to the pipe-in-pipe morphology. A more intuitive observation of the structures can be found in the ESI.† The pore feature changes slightly when adding PCN as a self-template, indicating that the formation of PCNC still undergoes the same process. The resulting defect types and oxygen dopants are also coincident in principle. The UV-vis light absorption spectra in Fig. S5† show a blue shift at 400–450 nm in PCN and PCNC, belonging to π → π* electron transitions in the conjugated aromatic system. Besides, a new absorption band appears at 470–510 nm, usually ascribed to n → π* transitions involving lone pairs of the edge nitrogen atoms in heptazine units.36–38 This kind of transition is forbidden in traditional symmetric and planar units, but the abnormal phenomenon can be allowed in PCN and PCNC due to the defect induced asymmetric polarization, and the shortened stacking distance between the two adjacent layers confirmed by XRD (Fig. S2A†) makes this electron transition accessible.38,39 Additionally, PCNC has a strong tail absorption (Urbach tail) in the visible-light region, which usually reflects the existence of disorders/defects, leading to the formation of localized electronic states extended in the bandgap (known as midgap states).40–42

Further details about the defect types and oxygen dopants in samples were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The fitted C 1s peaks at 284.8 eV, 286.2 eV and 288.1 eV of CN (Fig. 3A) were assigned to the aromatic carbon atoms, C–O bonds and the sp2 hybridized carbon (N–CN) in the s-triazine ring, respectively.43–45 Specifically, the peak at 286.2 eV is very weak in the reference, suggesting only slight contamination with oxygen groups, but the peak is improved in PCN and PCNC, indicating that some carbon atoms are bonded to O atoms to form C–O bonds.27,35 The main peak at 288.1 eV shifts to high energy in PCN (288.3 eV) and PCNC (288.2 eV). This indicates that the low electron density around N–CN is probably due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of oxygen dopants, which is consistent with the results of solid-state 13C NMR. This also occurs in N 1s spectra (Fig. 3B), in which the fitted N 1s peaks at 398.6 eV, 400.1 eV and 401.3 eV represent the sp2-hybridized nitrogen in the s-triazine rings (C–NC), tertiary nitrogen groups (N–(C)3) and the defective amino groups (N–Hx) in heptazine substructures, respectively.23 The simultaneous high energy offset of the peak at 398.6 eV to 398.8 eV in PCN and 398.7 eV in PCNC suggests that the chemical environment of both C and N can be affected by oxygen dopants for low electron density.46 The surface C/N ratio in Table S1† shows a slight increase from 0.67 in CN to 0.68 in PCN, indicating the larger degree of oxygen doping than carbon defects of PCN, while in PCNC, once the oxygen doping reaches saturation, carbon defects become dominant, leading to a decreased ratio of 0.65. The large-scale lower percentage of N–(C)3 clearly reflects that O atoms can substitute the linkage N atoms. Additionally, the higher percentage of N–H indirectly proves the carbon defect induced incomplete polymerization, which is in accord with the results of FTIR. The O 1s spectra in Fig. 3C also show the details of oxygen doping. As the peak of O 1s at 532.5 eV is usually attributed to the adsorbed H2O,27 two new peaks are found at 531.8 eV and 533.5 eV for PCN and PCNC that represent C–OH and C–O–C, respectively.35 Hence, it is a convincing association that oxygen-doping is introduced during thermopolymerization to substitute the linkage N atoms. Otherwise, the elemental analysis of samples in Table S2† further revealed the decreasing of C and N contents with the large increase of O content. Based on the above characterization results, the proposed structure of PCN and PCNC with oxygen doping and carbon defects is demonstrated in Fig. 3D.

From the UV-vis absorption spectra, optical bandgaps of the samples were derived from the plots of Kubelka–Munk function versus photon energy (Fig. 4A). A slight increase in the bandgaps of PCN (2.80 eV) and PCNC (2.83 eV) is determined compared to that of CN (2.73 eV). Interestingly, Fig. 4B show clearly that a new Urbach tail is present in PCN which gives a significantly lower energy gap of 2.17 eV. Furthermore, PCNC has two Urbach tails, leading to two distinctively lower energy gaps (2.07 eV and 1.70 eV). The carbon defects simultaneously existing in the tube wall and internal coral-like architecture exhibit different effects probably due to the altered morphology and confinement effect. To investigate the band positions, Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. S6†) and XPS valence band (VB) spectra (Fig. S7†) were used to determine the band alignments. The intrinsic n-type characteristic of samples is identified by exhibiting positive slopes.29,47 The flat band potentials meaning the Fermi levels of CN, PCN and PCNC are −1.16, −1.33 and −1.40 eV in Fig. S4,† respectively. From Fig. S5,† the VB maxima are found to be 2.16 eV (CN), 2.05 eV (PCN) and 1.88 eV (PCNC). According to the formula ENHE/V = φ + VB − 4.44 (ENHE: potential of the normal hydrogen electrode; φ of 3.88 eV: the electron work function of the analyzer),48 the final VB positions are estimated to be 1.60 eV, 1.49 eV and 1.32 eV. Based on the above data, the bandgap structures of CN, PCN and PCNC are schematically described in Fig. 4C. With different levels of oxygen doping, the VB positions of PCN and PCNC shift up in turn. Meanwhile, the conduction band (CB) of PCN and PCNC moves to more negative positions, which is similar to the variation tendency of the flat band potential in Fig. S4,† indicating the stronger reduction ability of photo-electrons in terms of thermodynamics. The midgap states in PCN (−0.68 eV) and PCNC (−0.75 eV and −0.38 eV) can contribute significantly to the absorption of photons with energies and meanwhile capture photo-electrons, leading to efficient electron–hole pair separation. Moreover, the calculated density of states (DOS) for three molecular models (see Fig. S8†), pure CN, CN with carbon defects and CN with oxygen doping, is shown in Fig. 4D. The bandgap decreases in the order of pure CN (no modification) > CN (oxygen doping) > CN (introducing carbon defects). Besides, carbon defects make a new narrow gap (0.8 eV) with the increasing density of spin-down electrons, further proving the rationality of midgap states. Hence, it is reasonable to infer that the separation of photogenerated charge carriers is more efficient in PCN and PCNC.

The photoluminescence spectra in Fig. 5A reveal that electron–hole recombination could be suppressed in PCNC more efficiently. The blue-shift emission coincides with the enlarged bandgap in Fig. 4C. The lowest emission intensity of PCNC means the suppressive electron–hole recombination. This efficient separation of carriers is better confirmed by photocurrent density (Fig. S9†) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. S10†). The periodic on/off photocurrent measurement of samples under visible light irradiation shows rapid light-responses. PCNC exhibits an approximately three-fold increase of photocurrent density compared to CN, suggesting lower recombination of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the semicircular Nyquist plot in EIS for PCNC presents a minimum radius, indicating the lowest electron transfer resistance. As powerful evidence, these photoelectrochemical measurements show that the mobility of the photogenerated carriers is greatly improved. The time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra in Fig. 5B show that PCNC has the longest carrier lifetime among all samples. The thin hierarchical tubular structure with oxygen doping and carbon defects could improve the migration of photogenerated electrons to the surface. More long lifetime electrons can take part in the photocatalytic reaction for high efficiency. Thus, the evaluation of solar-to-hydrogen conversion over these samples is shown in Fig. 5C. The reference CN has a low hydrogen production rate of 146.8 μmol h−1 g−1. PCN and PCNC exhibit sharp improvements with hydrogen production rates of 2040.7 μmol h−1 g−1 and 5289.9 μmol h−1 g−1, about 14 times and 36 times higher than that of CN, respectively. For a higher hydrogen production, a series of concentrations (10 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg, 70 mg and 100 mg) of catalysts were investigated in Fig. S11.† Obviously, there is no linear relationship between the activity and the concentration of catalysts. Additionally, this photocatalytic system over PCNC possesses a stable cyclic utilization up to 25 hours without obvious attenuation. The wavelength dependent hydrogen evolution in Fig. 5D shows a varying trend in the UV-vis spectrum, where a relatively high rate of 3232.5 μmol h−1 g−1 is obtained under 420 nm irradiation. Interestingly, a considerable activity under 500 nm can be equivalent to 450 nm. A relatively high apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 32.4% at 420 nm for PCNC was obtained in Fig. S12.† In comparison with similar type carbon nitride nanotube based photocatalysts in Table S3,† PCN and PCNC show outstanding improvements for visible-light utilization, surpassing other materials (i.e. oxygen or phosphorus doped CN, CN with nitrogen or carbon defects and tubular yolk–shell CN).10,11,24,27,35,49–52

Based on the aforementioned experimental results and discussion, some advantages of pipe-in-pipe PCN and PCNC hollow structures for promoting solar-to-hydrogen conversion are summarized in Scheme 2. Specifically, the large specific surface areas can provide abundant active sites for redox reactions. Then, the thin-shelled topologies would shorten the distance for charge carrier transfer. Moreover, light scattering and reflection effects in hollow structures can improve the absorption and utilization of solar irradiation. Besides, the fast mass transfer driven by the open hollow structures due to the capillarity could further accelerate the contact of substrate molecules with the interface of catalysts. Lastly, the structural defects and elements doping (i.e. oxygen) would modulate the intrinsic electronic structure and reactant adsorption for the optimization of catalytic reactions. All these features are desirable for designing photocatalysts with high performance. Notably, these above promotive effects can be further enhanced in complex hollow structures. Especially, the hierarchical hollow structures would offer more contact sites than simple ones and build up new heterogeneous catalytic interfaces synergistically. This explains well why PCNC with an internal coral-like architecture has better activity than simple pipe-in-pipe PCN.

Conclusions
Hierarchical carbon nitride with a pipe-in-pipe double-layer and porous coral-like architecture is obtained successfully via a green fabrication method, where melamine is the only source and no harmful solvents or cross-linking agents are involved in the whole process. Hydrothermal treatment brings about oxygen dopants and the subsequent thermopolymerization generates a hollow structure with carbon defects. The as-prepared photocatalyst achieves a satisfactory hydrogen yield, ascribed to the large surface area, short charge transfer distance, light scattering, fast mass transfer and suitable bandgap with midgap states. This study provides a promising inspiration for environmentally friendly design of controllable micro-nanostructures with a desirable electronic structure for high performance in solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
