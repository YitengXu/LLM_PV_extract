1 Introduction
In the past few years unprecedented advances have been witnessed in the photovoltaic (PV) field with metal halide perovskites as excellent light harvesters. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently generated considerable research interest due to the rapid advancement of their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in excess of 22%.1 The most popular and archetypical metal halide perovskite, methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3), possesses impressive combination of material's properties including an appropriate band gap,2 extremely high absorption coefficient,3 long charge carrier diffusion length,4 high defect tolerance,5 excellent ambipolar charge carrier transport properties,6 and simple solution processing at low temperature,7 making PSCs a promising PV technology for realizing high performance and cost-effective solar cells in future.8–11 Besides PV applications, these fascinating properties of perovskites also lead to other optoelectronic applications including light-emitting diodes (LEDs),12–14 lasers,15 photodetectors,16 and photodiodes.17,18
Although great achievements have been made in lab-scale PV and optoelectronic devices, the large-scale commercial applications of these Pb-based perovskites are currently limited by the toxicity of Pb and the intrinsic instability of these materials. It has been revealed that the device instability is mainly due to the decomposition of perovskite absorbers even under inert atmospheres.19 Such degradation would be further accelerated in the presence of moisture, heat, and light.20–22 Toxic lead halides are considered as environmental hazards and potential carcinogens,23–25 probably leading to the decommissioning of Pb-based perovskites from the future commercial market of PVs.24 The device instability further consolidates public concerns on the potential risk of Pb release during long period usage. These undesirable disadvantages of Pb-based perovskite materials have motivated the investigation of a replacement for Pb in the perovskite community, with an intrinsically stable and environmentally friendly element. As such, a wide range of compounds comprising Sn2+, Ge2+, Sb3+, and Bi3+, and other transition metal cations are currently of interest.
In this review, we provide a summary of the recent development of low-toxic metal halide perovskites, focusing mainly on their fundamental structures and unique properties. Following this, we discuss the potential applications of these new materials in PVs and optoelectronic devices, with an emphasis on thin film fabrication, device architecture optimization, and device performance enhancement. Finally, we propose current significant challenges and suggest possible solutions, with the goal of stimulating potential applications and practical commercialization.
2 Structures and properties of low-toxic perovskites
The family of Pb-based perovskites have a general formula of APbX3 (where A = CH3NH3+ (MA), HC(NH2)2+ (FA), or Cs+; X = Cl−, Br− or I−), which have a simple and ideal cubic (or pseudocubic) crystal structure consisting of a three-dimensional (3-D) network of corner-sharing PbX6 octahedra combined with A cations, where Pb2+ cations are located at the center of octahedra, and A occupies the cuboctahedral voids between adjacent octahedra. Concerns over the potential environmental impact and long-term stability of Pb-based perovskites are stimulating experimental and theoretical efforts for the replacement of Pb with non-toxic elements.26 Exploration for alternatives to Pb-based perovskites could be classified based on substitutions at the metal cation positions, including group 14 metal elements (Sn and Ge), adjacent kin elements of Pb (Sb and Bi), and other transition metal elements. These new members of the perovskite family offer rich crystal structures and similar optoelectronic properties to lead-halide perovskites with potential applications in PVs and optoelectronic devices.
2.1 Tin-based perovskites

2.1.1 Pure tin-halide perovskites. 
Sn was first explored as a replacement for Pb as it is a member of divalent 14 group elements with comparable ionic radii (Sn2+ 1.35 Å and Pb2+ 1.49 Å),27 which may avoid substitution from significant lattice perturbation. Sn-based perovskites conventionally adopt ASnX3 perovskite structures, which possess narrower band gaps and much higher charge mobilities (102 to 103 cm2 V−1 s−1) as compared to Pb-based perovskites (10 to 102 cm2 V−1 s−1).28 However, Sn-based perovskites are not stable as compared to their Pb counterparts since Sn normally prefers the tetravalent state through the rapid oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+,27 which is the major obstacle that jeopardizes the reproducibility and device performance and thus limits the practical applications of these compounds.
Methylammonium tin halides (MASnX3, X = Cl, Br, I) exhibit a rich and complicated phase transition as temperature decreases, from cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, to triclinic, which is attributed to the slanting and distortion of SnX3− octahedra and the disordering of MA+ cations at finite temperature.28–31 At room temperature, MASnX3 adopts its highest symmetry phase (α-phase), unlike MAPbI3 with a lower symmetry phase (β-phase).32 As a result, MASnBr3, MASnI3 and MASnCl3 compounds exhibit cubic, tetragonal and monoclinic phases at room temperature,31,32 respectively. MASnI3 possesses an even lower optical band gap of 1.3 eV (MAPbI3: 1.55 eV) and a bulk electrical conductivity of ∼5 × 10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature (n-type). The compound, with a low carrier concentration of ∼1 × 1014 cm−3 and a high electron mobility of ∼2000 cm2 V−1 s−1, is comparable or even superior to traditional semiconductors, such as Si, CdTe, etc.32 However, Inabe et al. reported MASnI3 with a carrier concentration up to 1 × 1019 cm−3, showing a strong p-type character.33 This large difference was attributed to inherent Sn4+ impurities within commercial SnI2, indicating that excessive Sn4+ in the material must be avoided in the thin film deposition process. After oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+, the Sn4+ ion acts as a p-type dopant within the MASnI3 compound in the process termed “self-doping”.34 Therefore, the compounds behave as p- or n-type semiconductors depending on their preparation methods.28 Unfortunately, the efficiency of MASnI3 based PV devices is largely limited by the recombination with self-doping carriers. It was predicted that the diffusion length of 30 nm could approach 1 μm if the background hole concentration could be decreased effectively.34
Bernal et al.35 reported the electronic properties of MASnI3 and MASnBr3, by density functional theory calculations (DFT), indicating that the MA+ cation only donates one electron within these compounds instead of forming a strong bond with the halide atoms. Additionally, after introducing substitutional Br into MASnI3, charge transport became facile from the perovskite to the TiO2 electrode. Band gap engineering was implemented by substitution of I with Br in the form of CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) perovskites, enabling the distributions of band gaps from 1.3 to 2.15 eV.32
It has been widely reported that HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3) perovskite has much better thermal stability than MAPbI3.36 Similarly, substituting MA with FA yields formamidinium tin iodide HC(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite showing an attractive low band gap (1.41 eV) and higher stability which does not undergo any phase transitions up to 200 °C.37 Substitution of the organic cation by caesium (Cs) in the Pb-based perovskite structure can also significantly enhance the thermal stability.38,39 All-inorganic CsSnI3 has two polymorphs: black phase and yellow phase.40 The black phase has been studied comprehensively and shown promising thermal stability. CsSnI3 adopts a 3D orthorhombic perovskite structure, with a favorable band gap (∼1.3 eV),40 high optical absorption coefficient (∼104 cm−1 comparable to that of MAPbI3),41 low exciton binding energy (∼18 meV),42 and high charge-carrier mobility (up to ∼585 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes).40 Meanwhile, this material serves as a p-type conductor as CsSnI3 is prone to form a high density of Sn cation vacancy defects.40 It is worth noting that CsSnI3 also has the drawback of air sensitivity, with the phase transition from the black phase into the yellow phase, thus oxidizing into Cs2SnI6 into a more stable 4+ oxidation state.28,40
CsSnI3 was synthesized via a vacuum melting process at 450 °C, and was first utilized as a solid-state hole transporting material (HTM) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).43 Subsequently, Chen et al. reported the first planar heterojunction (PHJ) device employing CsSnI3 as the light absorber.44 The CsSnI3 thin films were fabricated via sequential vacuum evaporation of alternating layers of CsI and SnCl2 followed by annealing at 175 °C, successively. Concurrently, Zhou et al. synthesized CsSnI3 compounds from a mixed solution of CsI and SnI2 at room temperature followed by using the aforementioned method to obtain perovskite thin films.45 The electrical and optical properties of the films were not discussed. Subsequent studies have, similarly to organic hybrid Sn-based perovskites, utilized SnF2 as an additive via a solution process to reduce Sn vacancies and control the oxidation state of Sn, thereby rendering CsSnI3 less conducting in nature.46 CsSnI3−xBrx (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) perovskites were adopted via chemical doping of CsSnI3 with Br, and the modulation of the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the devices was realized.47 When I− is progressively replaced by Br−, the crystal structure transforms from orthorhombic to cubic and the optical band gap blue-shifts in the absorption spectra (Fig. 1(a)). Introduction of SnF2 into CsSnI3−xBrx perovskites leads to Voc enhancement attributed to the decrease of Sn vacancies, which are reflected by the lower charge carrier densities (1015 cm−3) and high charge recombination resistances. Very recently, Wang and co-workers reported CsSnIBr2 thin films with fewer Sn vacancies assisted by the addition of hypophosphorous acid (HPA).48 The HPA additive as a complexant was demonstrated to be capable of expediting the nucleation process while inhibiting the formation of Sn4+ during the fabrication process of CsSnIBr2 thin films.

2.1.2 Sn/Pb mixed metal perovskites. 
Parallel to the development of pure Sn-based perovskites, the incorporation of Sn into Pb-based perovskites to form mixed Sn/Pb halide perovskites provides an alternative route to reduce Pb toxicity and retard undesirable oxidation of Sn. In addition, partial substitution of Pb with Sn, e.g. MASnxPb1−xI3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3), leads to narrower band gaps (<1.3 eV) (Fig. 1(b)) and broader light absorption spectra into the near-infrared region (up to 1060 nm) (Fig. 1(c)).49,50 It was found that the stability of mixed Sn/Pb halide perovskites is better than that of MASnI3 perovskites. As such, it was considered that part of vestigial Pb is essential to inhibit undesirable oxidation of Sn. Feng et al. further indicated that the crystal structure and the Pb/Sn ratio can influence the band gap.51 MASnxPb1−xI3 is known to have a tetragonal structure (α phase for x ≥ 0.5; β phase for x < 0.5). Zou et al. reported PHJ hybrid MAPb1−aSnaI3−xClx PSCs, achieving a maximum PCE of 10.1%, attributed to broadened absorption and improved solution-cast film morphology, with a high surface coverage (∼97%) and excellent continuity.52 Notably, slightly unbalanced electron/hole transport was observed in the pure phases of Pb (Sn) materials, while an almost perfectly balanced charge carrier transport can be achieved within Sn/Pb intermediate compositions.52,53 Their study showed that the 0.5:0.5 mixed Pb/Sn perovskite could represent a winning compound to mitigate the Pb content in the perovskites. Therefore, MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 has received enormous interest and systematic exploration. MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 possesses a band gap of 1.21 eV, and its light harvesting can be extended to wavelengths over 1000 nm.54 However, its Urbach energy of 34 meV is more than twice that of the MAPbI3 perovskite (15 meV). Their photocarrier lifetimes of 4 ps (55% Sn), 650 ps (25% Sn) and 3 ns (20% Sn) are much shorter than that of the MAPbI3 perovskite (over 100 ns). The higher Urbach energy and the shorter carrier lifetime indicate that there are defects in the Sn/Pb mixed perovskites.
Very recently, FA+ cations were incorporated into Sn/Pb mixed perovskites due to their superior stability. Yang and co-workers attained homogeneous and densely crystalline MA1−yFAyPb1−xSnxI3 films by adopting a solvent-washing methodology. The MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 perovskite with a low band gap of 1.33 eV exhibited an impressive stabilized PCE of 14.19% and retained a long-term stability under ambient conditions.55 Liao et al. have developed a new precursor combining a FASnI3 precursor with a MAPbI3 precursor to form (FASnI3)1−x(MAPbI3)x perovskites, with an orthorhombic crystal structure.56 The best-performing cell using (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 as an absorber with a band gap of ∼1.2 eV has achieved a PCE higher than 15%. Impressively, by incorporating Cs, a new FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 perovskite material was fabricated with a band gap of 1.2 eV.57 Meanwhile, materials with a much wider band gap of 1.8 and 1.6 eV for FA0.83Cs0.17PbI0.5Br0.5 and FA0.79MA0.16Cs0.05Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3, respectively, were synthesized were synthesized successfully and used as the absorbers in an all-perovskite tandem solar cell.57

2.2 Other metal halide perovskites

2.2.1 Germanium-based perovskites. 
Germanium (Ge), another element of group 14 metals, with non-toxicity and earth-abundance, is a viable replacement for Pb in halide perovskite compounds. Ge perovskite compounds have demonstrated high ionic conductivity.58 Compared with Pb- and Sn-based perovskites, Ge-based perovskites are less explored in detail. Featuring the smaller ionic radius (0.73 Å) of Ge2+ as compared to Sn2+ and Pb2+, the MAGeI3 perovskite is expected to have a narrower band gap. However, the MAGeI3 perovskite has a larger band gap than Pb and Sn counterparts due to its quasi-3-D hexagonal structure.59 CsGeX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites initially have been studied with band gaps of 1.6, 2.3, and 3.1 eV, for X = I, Br, and Cl, respectively.60,61 Notably, a CsGeI3 crystal has a rhombohedral structure and does not encounter phase transitions during low temperature solution growth, staying stable up to 150 °C.62 However, Ge2+ is also sensitive to air due to the low binding energy of its 4s2 electrons.63
In 2015, the Kanatzidis group systematically studied the remarkable optical properties of Ge-based halide perovskites.64 According to the calculation and materials characterization, CsGeI3, MAGeI3, HC(NH2)2GeI3, and CH3C(NH2)2GeI3 compounds have direct band gaps of 1.6, 1.9, 2.2 and 2.5 eV, respectively, forming 3D perovskite frameworks, while (CH3)3NHGeI3, C(NH2)3GeI3, and (CH3)2C(H)NH3GeI3 have indirect band gaps of 2.5, 2.7, and 2.8 eV, respectively, with 1D infinite chain frameworks. It was found that the incorporation of larger cations results in lower-dimensional perovskite structures due to the stereochemical activation of the 4s2 lone pair, with a significant widening of the band gap. Meanwhile, this increases the transparency region of the compounds in the visible spectrum thus leading to a poor absorption. These large band gap perovskites are expected to be suitable as the top absorber layers in all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Very recently, Sun et al. theoretically revealed that MAGeI3 has a remarkable hole and electron conductive behavior and adequate stability as compared with MAPbI3.65 Therefore, MAGeI3 may be a competitive and environmentally friendly alternative to MAPbI3 for efficient perovskite solar cells.
Inspired by the innovation of mixed Sn/Pb perovskites, recently mixed Ge/Pb perovskites MAGexPb1−xI3 (x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00) have been investigated based on the first principles calculations by different methods.66 The results indicated that MAGexPb1−xI3 perovskites have narrower band gaps than pure Pb- and Ge-based perovskites. With an increased proportion of Ge, a monotonic decrease in the band gap and a monotonic increase in the optical absorption spectra were observed for mixed Ge/Pb perovskites. Among them, MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 with the lowest effective mass, the strongest optical absorption and an appropriate band gap is expected to be the best candidate for PV applications.


2.2.2 Antimony-based perovskites. 
Beyond group 14 metals, antimony (Sb), an adjacent kin element of Pb, is considered as an alternative to Pb in metal halide perovskite structures. Sb-based perovskites, with a chemical formula of A3Sb2X9 (e.g., A = Cs+, MA+; X = I−, Br−, Cl−), are also expected to exhibit similar PV and optoelectronic behavior to Pb and Sn perovskites, because Sb3+ ions have a similar electronic configuration and close electronegativity and ionic radius to Sn2+ and Pb2+.67 The computational and experimental investigations of purely inorganic antimony compound Cs3Sb2I9 have been recently reported.68 Sb exists only in a stable +3 state, which constrains the ability to form a 3D corner sharing perovskite structure. Therefore, Cs3Sb2I9 has two known structural modifications, the 0D dimmer form (space group P63/mmc) and the 2D layered form (Pm1).68 The crystal structural modification of layered Cs3Sb2I9 is derived from the hypothetical perovskite compound CsSbI3 (i.e., Cs3Sb3I9), where one-third of the Sb layers along the 〈111〉 direction are vacant (i.e. the Sb atoms occupy 2/3 of the octahedral SbI6 voids), resulting in 2D layered Cs3Sb3I9 (Fig. 2(a)). The 2D layered Cs3Sb3I9, with a direct band gap of 2.05 eV,68 higher electron and hole mobilities and better tolerance to defects,69 is superior to the dimer form of Cs3Sb3I9. The layered Cs3Sb3I9 has a high absorption coefficient comparable to MAPbI3.68 Such a high absorption coefficient derives from its electronic structure, because the dispersive bands are mainly comprised of Sb 5s and I 5p states in the valence band and Sb 5p states in the conduction band, resulting in relatively small effective masses of charge carriers (0.34–0.91m0). However, the dimer form of Cs3Sb2I9 has a preference over its layered derivative if formed via a solution process. Furthermore, in order to form layered Cs3Sb2I9, it is difficult to reproduce the process of vaporizing SbI3 at high temperatures during annealing treatment. Very recently, rubidium (Rb) has been used as an alternative cation for inorganic layered antimony perovskites formed via solution processing.70 In terms of Rb3Sb2I9, a smaller Rb cation (Rb: 1.72 Å, Cs: 1.88 Å) can effectively stabilize the structure in its layered form, indicating an increased preference for the layered phase.

Very recently, the Kirchartz group has presented a solution-based fabrication of a methylammonium antimony iodide MA3Sb2I9 compound.71 Determined by photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS), the amorphous film of MA3Sb2I9 showed a high peak absorption coefficient of α > 105 cm−1 and a wide band gap of 2.14 eV. A photoluminescence (PL) emission peak was observed at 1.58 eV, but the Urbach energy of this amorphous compound is 62 meV, indicating a much higher degree of disorder in the material. The homogeneous and compact thin films were prepared by using the solvent engineering technique during the spin-coating process, yielding a PCE of ∼0.5% in a PHJ solar cell. It is well known that the energy states and carrier concentrations of semiconductor materials can be effectively modulated by element doping. Trivalent Sb was for the first time incorporated into MAPbI3 by the Han group.72 The optical band gap of CH3NH3Pb1−xSb2x/3I3 perovskites was tuned from 1.55 to 2.06 eV. Theoretical calculations and experimental results have demonstrated that a small amount of Sb doping was achieved through n-type doping, thereby increasing the electron density in the conduction band and elevating the quasi-Fermi energy level. Unfortunately, only subtly Sb-doped (Sn ≤ 1%) PSCs have shown improved PCEs. Other optoelectronic properties of low-content Sb and pure Sb-based materials should be further explored.


2.2.3 Bismuth-based perovskites. 
Bismuth (Bi), a member of group 15 elements as Sb, has attracted a great deal of attention from the perovskite community. Bi-based perovskites have demonstrated non-toxicity and better chemical stability as compared to Pb-based perovskites. Alkaline metal based bismuth perovskites, A3Bi2I9 (A = K, Rb, and Cs), have been employed in PV applications for the first time.73 The compounds have two main structural types: K3Bi2I9 and Rb3Bi2I9 occupy 2D defect-perovskite structures (Fig. 2(c)), with corrugated layers of corner-connected Bi–I octahedra, while Cs3Bi2I9 possesses a 0D structure (Fig. 2(b)), with isolated Bi2I93− ions forming face-sharing Bi–I octahedra. These compounds have anomalous Born effective charges arising from the Bi3+ 6s2 lone pair, which increase the ability of defect screening and charge carrier transport within the materials. From the experimental values, both K3Bi2I9 and Rb3Bi2I9 have a direct band gap of ∼2.1 eV, while Cs3Bi2Cl9 has an indirect band gap of 1.9 eV. Bass et al. reported a layered polymorph of perovskite Cs3Bi2Br9, with a large exciton binding energy of 940 meV.74 As the exciton couples with vibrations in the lattice of Cs3Bi2Br9, it is facile to raise the possibility of highly structured emission at room temperature. Indeed, the observed structural diversity of Bi perovskites exhibits their stronger tendency to form structures with a lower dimensionality than Pb-based compounds.73
Other attempts and significant research efforts have been made toward organic–inorganic hybrid methylammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9). MA3Bi2I9 is isostructural with MA3Sb2I9, comprising two face-sharing bismuth iodide octahedra, and is a 0D dimer at room temperature.75,76 MA3Bi2I9 presents a hexagonal crystalline phase,75 and has an indirect band gap of 2.04 eV,77 with its optical absorption coefficient approaching 105 cm−1,77,78 which makes it potentially suitable as the top absorber in tandem solar cells. Hoye et al. have synthesized phase-pure MA3Bi2I9 thin films by solution-processing and vapor-assisted techniques, which exhibit higher air stability than MAPbI3. In addition, these thin films have a superior PL decay time of at least 760 ps, with the bulk lifetime possibly closer to 5.6 ns.77 Vigneshwaran and co-workers reported sulfur doped bismuth perovskites obtained by in situ sulfur doping of MA3Bi2I9via the thermal decomposition of a Bi(xt)3 (xt = ethyl xanthate) precursor, which exhibit an even lower band gap of 1.45 eV than MAPbI3.79 Additionally, the carrier concentration and mobility of sulfur doped MA3Bi2I9 were much higher in comparison with those of un-doped MA3Bi2I9. Very recently, based on a split-anion approach, Sun et al. have obtained MABiSeI2 and MABiSI2 materials via replacing Pb with Bi and introducing dual anions (i.e., splitting the anion sites), thus improving their band gaps (a direct band gap of 1.3–1.4 eV) and optical absorption over those of MAPbI3.80
Obviously, organic groups play a vital role in the connection of adjacent Bi2I93− octahedra in the crystal structure, and hence, influence the electronic and optical properties of bismuth compounds.76 A new (C6H14N)3Bi2I9 material with a 0D structure has been synthesised by a solvent evaporation method.81 Red PL emissions at room temperature were assigned to the radiative recombination of excitons within the Bi2I93− octahedra. Sun et al. have synthesized a dark red bismuth phase, (NH4)3Bi2I9, with a 2D layered perovskite architecture and a measured band gap of 2.04 eV.82 1D hexanediammonium bismuth iodide (H3NC6H12NH3)BiI5 was used as the photoactive layer via a solution process, which achieved a superior coverage and thermal stability to those of MAPbI3.83
More recently, trivalent cations (e.g. Bi3+), along with monovalent cations (e.g. Ag+), have concurrently been introduced into the B-sites of halide perovskites, yielding halide double perovskites with the chemical formula of A2B′B′′X6. A typical example attracting significant attention is inorganic halide double perovskites Cs2AgBiX6. These new perovskites consist of two types of octahedra alternating in a rock-salt face-centered 3D cubic structure (Fig. 2(d)).84–88 The B′ and B′′ sites have to be occupied by monovalent and trivalent cations in order to maintain the total charge neutrality. Cs2AgBiBr6 has an indirect band gap of 1.95 eV, and shows a long room-temperature PL lifetime of ∼660 ns.84 Cs2AgBiBr6 has inherently high defect tolerance and significant stability toward heat and moisture as compared to MAPbI3,84 but is less stable than MAPbBr3.85 Defect calculations by Xiao's group showed that Ag vacancies are shallow accepters while Bi vacancies and AgBi antisites are deep acceptors. The former can be easily formed for good p-type conduction, while the latter will be the dominant defects under the Br-rich conditions.85 Double perovskites Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 have also been synthesized by McClure's group from both solid state and solution routes, yielding indirect band gaps of 2.19 and 2.77 eV, respectively.86 Both compounds are stable when exposed to air, but Cs2AgBiBr6 degrades over a period of weeks when exposed to both ambient air and light. Notably, in contrast with Cs2AgBiX6 having a wide and indirect band gap, Rb2CuInCl6, Rb2AgInBr6, and Cs2AgInBr6 have theoretically narrow and direct band gaps of 1.36, 1.46, and 1.50 eV,87 respectively, which are more suitable as absorbers for single-junction solar cells. Overall, Volonakis et al. used first-principles calculations to explore the entire family of double perovskites Cs2B′B′′X6, with B′ = Bi, Sb; B′′ = Cu, Ag, Au; and X = Cl, Br, I.88 They predicted that all compounds with an indirect band gap may turn into direct band gap compounds via a simple strategy, which calls for more future experimental and theoretical studies on these promising functional materials.

3 Low-toxic perovskites for photovoltaic applications
Owing to their outstanding and fantastic optoelectronic properties, low-toxic perovskites have been regarded as promising absorbers and achieved enormous progress with increasing PCEs for solar cells in recent years.

3.1 Tin-based perovskite solar cells
Initially, all-inorganic perovskite CsSnI3 exhibiting p-type characteristics was employed as the absorber material in Schottky solar cells, yielding a PCE of 0.88% along with low Jsc and Voc.44 Subsequently, SnF2 was employed as an additive to reduce background carrier density via filling of cation vacancies,92 achieving a high Jsc of 22.7 mA cm−2 but a low Voc of 0.24 V.46 Generally, it is difficult to realize high uniformity and full coverage of Sn-based thin films without any additives, due to the rapid crystallization of Sn-based perovskites at room temperature.94 By the introduction of SnF2 into the synthesis of Sn-based analogues can effectively suppress the oxidization of Sn2+ and reduce the hole density in the resulting films.43,46 Thus, the additions of SnF2 compounds, as the inhibitor of Sn4+, are effective approaches to obtain highly uniform and pinhole-free Sn-based perovskite films.37,46,95 By employing black orthorhombic (B-γ) structured B-γ-CsSnI3 as the light absorber, Wang et al. reported a novel inverted ITO/NiOx/CsSnI3/PCBM/Al planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cell without the use of any additives, resulting in a PCE of up to 3.31% and a fill factor (FF) of over 60%.90 The grains of the B-γ-CsSnI3 thin films were coarsened by increasing the annealing temperature (Fig. 3(a)). Thermally driven coarsening of the B-γ-CsSnI3 grains is accompanied by an increase of Sn-vacancy concentration in their crystal structure. The champion devices adopted solution-processed B-γ-CsSnI3 thin films (∼120 nm thick) after 150 °C thermal annealing. Very Recently, Marshall et al. reported a HTM-free PHJ solar cell with the structure of ITO/CsSnI3/PCBM/BCP/Al, based on a B-γ-CsSnI3 layer co-deposited with a SnX2 additive.91 The device with a 10 mol% SnCl2 additive achieved a record PCE of 3.56% and FF of ∼68%, demonstrating a way to simplify the device architecture without compromising its performance. The improved performance stemmed from the large propensity for SnCl2 diffusing into PCBM, leading to n-doping of PCBM by SnCl2. Notably, the unencapsulated devices exhibited outstanding stability (≥10 times as compared to Pb-based devices with the same architecture) under continuous illumination in ambient air. However, the theoretical Voc of the all-inorganic PSC is largely limited by the intense bulk recombination due to the Sn vacancies. Incorporating of Br into CsSnI3 perovskites to form CsSnI3−xBrx is an effective way to improve the Voc of the devices, which can suppress the Sn vacancies, the dominant defects in CsSnI3.47,48 Li et al. obtained CsSnIBr2 thin films with low Sn vacancies and stable perovskite phases assisted by the addition of hypophosphorous acid (HPA).48 It was demonstrated that the HPA additive served as a complexant to speed up the nucleation process, remarkably lowering both the carrier mobilities and charge carrier densities of the CsSnIBr2 films. Interestingly, the CsSnIBr2 perovskite precursor solution was dropped on a triple mesoporous layer of TiO2/Al2O3/carbon, obtaining a novel “interpenetrate perovskite network” architecture (Fig. 3(c)). Therefore, the Voc and FF were significantly improved, leading to an average PCE of 3.0%. Impressively, the CsSnIBr2 PSCs exhibited efficiency-loss free features for 77 days and maintained 98% of their initial PCE after 9 hours of continuous power output at 473 K, showing a superior long-term thermal stability.

In 2014, Kanatzidis' and Snaith's groups achieved PCEs of 5.73% and 6.4%, based on MASnI3−xBrx and MASnI3 absorbers, respectively.32,34 Unfortunately, the instability and poor reproducibility of these devices become the main obstacles for their practical applications in PV fields. However, a recent study from Kanatzidis' group has demonstrated that doping MASnI3 films with SnF2 can effectively increase their fluorescence lifetimes up to 10 times and obtain the diffusion lengths exceeding 500 nm,104 indicating that the performance of MASnI3 PSCs can be further improved. Very recently, they obtained high-quality and pinhole-free MASnI3 films using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvents.93 In the crystallization process of the films, it is facile to form the solvent-induced SnI2·3DMSO intermediate phase, which plays an important role in controlling the final thin film quality. The intermediate phase was found stable prior to the formation of the perovskite. This process can promote homogeneous nucleation and adjust the perovskite film growth rate. The HTM-free devices obtained a high Jsc of up to 21 mA cm−2. Another novel low-temperature vapor assisted solution method has also been employed by the same group to prepare MASnI3 thin films, achieving high surface coverage and excellent uniformity; unfortunately the device efficiency is relatively low.94
In 2015, Mathew's group reported FASnI3 PSCs and achieved a PCE of 2.1% with the use of SnF2 as an additive.37 However, excessive SnF2 induces phase separation on the surfaces of perovskite films. Recently, Lee et al. have overcome this obstacle through introduction of pyrazine along with SnF2 to form homogeneous dispersion of SnF2–pyrazine complexes.95 As a result, the FASnI3 thin films achieved an improvement of the surface morphologies and suppression of the unwanted Sn oxidation. The FASnI3 based PSC realized a PCE of 4.8% with good reproducibility. Impressively, the encapsulated device still maintained 98% of its initial efficiency over 100 days, exhibiting excellent long-term stability. Notably, after the reports by Snaith's and Kanatzidis' groups in 2014, Liao et al. for the first time reproduced a pure Sn-based PSC with a PCE of up to 6.22%.96 A simple inverted PHJ architecture was adopted for these devices to reduce current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis. It was found that the use of diethyl ether antisolvent together with SnF2 additives is critical to obtain highly uniform pinhole-free FASnI3 thin films. These results provide practical strategies to fabricate efficient and stable Sn-based PSCs.
Numerous attempts have also been made toward mixed Sn/Pb halide perovskite based devices. In 2014, a mixed Sn/Pb PSC realized a PCE of 7.37% (MASn0.25Pb0.75I3) for a conventional n–i–p PHJ structure50 and 10.1% (MASn0.15Pb0.85I3−xClx) for an inverted PHJ structure.52 Recently, Tsai et al. have synthesized lower Pb content and mixed-halide perovskites MASn0.75Pb0.25I3−xClx to extend light harvesting toward the near-infrared region. The devices with a configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/mp-Al2O3/NiO/carbon produced a PCE of 5.13% with good reproducibility and stability.97 Unfortunately, the PCE was limited by the low Voc of 457 mV and FF of 57.2%. Since the PSCs adopting an inverted PHJ configuration realized high PCE and low J–V hysteresis based on Pb-based perovskites, increasing attention has recently been paid back to Sn-based PSCs. Zhu et al. reported a two-step solution process with thermal plus solvent vapor-assisted thermal annealing (Fig. 3(b)), achieving MASnxPb1−xI3 films with large and smooth grains (some up to ∼1 μm).98 The highest PCE of 10.25% was achieved from invert PHJ devices (x = 0.1). However, increasing the Sn content within the perovskites with this methodology will produce more oxidation states of Sn4+, resulting in the degradation of the device performance. Based on the invert PHJ architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MASn0.5Pb0.5I3/C60/BCP/Ag, Li et al. have achieved a high PCE of 13.6%, which is attributed to the superior flat, compact and uniform perovskite films formed using a two step spin-coating method (Fig. 3(d)).99 Liao et al. have also employed (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 perovskites as the absorbers, achieving a high Jsc of 26.86 mA cm−2, a maximum PCE of 15.08% and an average PCE of 14.39%.56 These devices exhibited high reproducibility and less J–V hysteresis (Fig. 3(e)).
Impressively, based on low band gap mixed Sn/Pb halide perovskites, Yang et al. and Eperon et al. have realized efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells.55,57 For perovskite–perovskite tandem solar cells, narrow band gap and wide band gap materials are suitable for back cells and front cells, respectively. Yang et al. fabricated MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 PSCs which exhibited a promising stabilized PCE of 14.19%, and can maintain 80% and 94% of their initial value after 12 and 30 days of storage in ambient air (30–40% relative humidity (RH)) and an inert atmosphere, respectively.55 This mixed Sn/Pb perovskite (as the back sub-cell) together with a semitransparent MAPbI3 perovskite (as the front sub-cell) was fabricated into a 4-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar cell (Fig. 4(a) and (b)) with a record PCE of 19.08%. Another inspiring study from Eperon et al. employed FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3, FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.5Br0.5)3 and FA0.79MA0.16Cs0.05Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 as the absorbers to construct 2- and 4-terminal tandem perovskite solar cells (Fig. 4(a)).57 The FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3, FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.5Br0.5)3 and FA0.79MA0.16Cs0.05Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 PSCs attained PCEs of 13.6%, 9.6%, 14.5%, respectively, surprisingly exhibiting good thermal and air stability. Meanwhile, the 2- and 4-terminal tandem PSCs achieved high PCEs of 13.9% and 18.1%, respectively. The key technical challenges ahead are to increase the voltage of the front cell and the photocurrent of the back cell. These impressive efforts based on narrow band gap perovskites open the possibility of all-perovskite tandem solar cells.

3.2 Other metal halide perovskite solar cells
Ge perovskites are facile to form lower dimensional structures and even unstable than Sn perovskites, and therefore received less attention for PV applications. MAGeI3 and CsGeI3 PSCs have attained maximum PCEs of 0.2% (ref. 62) and 3.2%,100 respectively. The low PCEs are mainly due to the poor film morphologies and oxidising tendencies of Ge-based perovskites. Recently, Sun et al. predicted the highest theoretical efficiency of 24.24% for MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3, stimulating more theoretical and experimental investigations.66
After the report of Saparov and co-worker on Cs3Sb2I9-based PSCs with a low PCE (<1%) in 2015,68 there have been fewer reports about Sb-based PSCs. In 2016, Mathews' and kirchartz's groups reported Rb3Sb2I9 and MA3Sb2I9 based devices, with PCEs of 0.66% (ref. 70) and 0.49%,71 respectively. These low PCEs are attributed to the low photocurrent densities. Sb was for the first time incorporated into MAPbI3 by Zhang et al. to form MAPb1−xSb2x/3I3. The introduction of a small content of Sb (Sb ≤ 1%) was proved to from n-type doping within the perovskite.72 Only the PSCs with a subtle Sb-doped content (Sb ≤ 1%) realized improved PCE as compared to the pure Pb-based perovskite. The 1% Sb-doped solar cell showed a maximum PCE of 15.6%, along with a high Jsc of over 20 mA cm−2. Unfortunately, the performance of the devices sharply decreased when the content of Sb was over 10%, resulting in very low PV performance based on higher Sb content (Sb ≥ 25%) devices (Fig. 4(c)). High-content Sb-based perovskite devices need further studies such as optimization of device architectures, promotion of film qualities, and exploration of charge transport properties.
To date, the maximum PCEs of Bi-based PSCs are relatively low (∼1%). Since 2015, Park et al. have reported the preparation of A3Bi2I9 films using a one-step spin coating method. Based on mesoporous architectures, the PSCs using Cs3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 as the absorbers presented PCEs of 1.09% and 0.12%, respectively.75 Shortly afterwards, Lyu et al. attained a 0.19% PCE based on MA3Bi2I9.76 It was revealed that MA3Bi2I9 films exhibited excellent stability over 40 days upon continuous exposure to ambient air (50% RH) at room temperature. Very recently, Miyasaka's group demonstrated a comparative study of perovskite formation on mesoporous (anatase and brookite TiO2) and planar structures.102 The devices based on mesoscopic anatase TiO2 layers achieved the best PCE of 0.26%. All the devices were stable for a long time (5 weeks) under ambient air. It was adequately indicated that the TiO2 morphology can play a significant role in improving the cell efficiency of MA3Bi2I9 perovskites. Furthermore, Zhang and co-workers fabricated MA3Bi2I9-based solar cells on ITO substrates.103 The devices introduced a MoO3 layer on the top of the hole transport layer. They studied the effect of the morphology and crystallinity on the one-step spin-coated MA3Bi2I9 film on different substrates (compact TiO2 and mesoscopic TiO2). It was found that the devices fabricated at a perovskite precursor concentration of 0.45 M provided the best efficiency of 0.42% with a mesoporous architecture. In addition, (H3NC6H12NH3)BiI5 was attempted in mesoporous architecture PSCs.83 Although the PCE of the devices was below 0.1%, the perovskite films achieved a near-complete coverage on the mesoporous TiO2 layer.
4 Low-toxic perovskites for optoelectronic applications
Theoretically, an ideal light absorber can also be an excellent light emitter. Solid-state light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have played critical roles in lighting applications. LEDs based on metal halide perovskites in particular MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) have also attracted significant attention and investigation in recent years. However, the toxicity of Pb has raised great concerns for its real practical applications. To date, LEDs based on Pb-free perovskites have few reports. Very recently, Hong et al. have fabricated infrared LEDs for the first time based on CsSnI3 perovskite films employing two low-temperature solution processes (one-pot solution method and toluene dripping method).105 2-(4-tert-Butylphenyl)-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) was used as the electron transport layer (Fig. 5(a)), which possesses a high electron mobility ∼2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The CsSnI3 films prepared by the toluene dripping method indeed displayed closely conjoined micrometer-sized grains along with very few pinholes and cracks. Infrared LEDs fabricated with such high-quality CsSnI3 films exhibited electroluminescence (EL) at 950 nm with a maximum radiance of 40 W sr−1 m−2 and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.8%. Lai et al. recently reported near-Infrared LEDs based on an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MASn(Br1−xIx)3/poly(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)(F8)/Ca/Ag architecture.106 MASnI3 LEDs exhibited EL at 945 nm with a maximum radiance of 3.4 W sr−1 m−2 and a maximum EQE of 0.72%. Additionally, increasing the Br content in these Sn based perovskites leads to wider band gap materials and shorter EL wavelengths, tunable down to 667 nm (MASn(Br0.2I0.8)3) (Fig. 5(b)). Although these Sn-based perovskite LEDs are still facing stability issues, their advantages such as solution processability and low cost motivate further exploration and research.

Although ultralow-threshold amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and high-Q (quality factor) lasing have been realized from lead halide perovskites via a low-temperature solution process, there are few research efforts on lead-free perovskites. Parallel to the rising of Sn-based perovskite LEDs, Sn-based perovskite lasers have recently been developed. Xing et al. attained coherent near-infrared (NIR) lasing (Q: ∼500) with an ultralow threshold (∼6 μJ cm−2) by employing a SnF2-added CsSnI3 film and a natural cavity on a butterfly wing (Fig. 5(c)).107 It was also demonstrated that introduction of a SnF2 additive could effectively suppress the trap states within CsSnI3. Impressively, the rate of electron–hole bimolecular recombination reached up to ∼10−8 cm3 s−1, which was 1–2 orders larger than that of MAPbI3. By varying the composition of Br and I, the ASE thresholds of CsSnX3 (X = Br, I) were adjusted from 8 (±2) to 25 (±5) μJ cm−2 (Fig. 5(d)) at room temperature from 700 to 950 nm. Sn-based perovskites as gain media have the advantages of solution-processability, ultralow threshold, infrared wavelength tunability, and substrate insensitivity, which will stimulate tremendous research interest and potential applications.
Potential application of low-toxic perovskite materials has also been extended to photodetector. Very recently, 3D MASnI3 nanowires (NWs) were fabricated for the first time in a porous alumina template (PAT) employing a vapor phase chemical reaction method (Fig. 5(e)).108 The NWs were tightly embedded in the PAT achieving a density of 4 × 108 cm−2. It was demonstrated that the degradation process of the NWs in the PAT slowed down by ∼800 times that of the planar sample in ambient air, because the alumina sidewalls could effectively block lateral diffusion paths of H2O and O2 thus leading to a great improvement of the material stability. As a result, the light current decay was ∼500 times slower for the NW based device than that of the thin film counterpart (Fig. 5(f)). This work using nanoengineering templates provided a significant and feasible strategy for promoting perovskite material stability and their practical applications.
5 Conclusions and outlook
Low-toxic perovskites have attracted intensive research efforts and demonstrated huge potential in PVs and optoelectronic applications. As compared to Pb-based perovskites, non-lead perovskites, in particular, Sn and its analogues, exhibit fascinating intrinsic properties such as narrower and tunable band gaps (by adjusting A, B, and X sites), higher charge carrier mobilities, low toxicity, low-temperature solution processing, etc., enabling high Jsc in single-junction solar cells and also making them suitable for developing multi-junction solar cells. In brief, successful efforts and rapid advancements have been made in the following directions in the past few years based on these novel perovskite materials: (1) SnF2 as an additive was introduced into Sn-based perovskites to suppress the “self-doping” effect; (2) MA+ cations were substituted by FA+ or Cs+ cations to increase the thermal or chemical stabilities of these materials; (3) the fabrication processes of thin films (solvent engineering, thermal treatment, etc.) were continuously improved to promote the quality of these thin films; (4) invert PHJ solar cells have realized high PCEs along with high-quality perovskite thin films; (5) perovskite–perovskite tandem solar cells have attained superior PCEs based on the combination of narrow and wide band gap perovskite materials; (6) other optoelectronic applications (e.g. LEDs, lasers and photodetectors) based on low-toxic perovskites have come into practice.
Despite the rapid development of low toxic perovskite materials and their applications, there are still many key issues and challenges need to be resolved. Currently, the mechanisms of “self-doping” and oxidation of Sn perovskites remain unclear, thus lacking effective means to inhibit undesired “self-doping” and oxidation. Additionally, systematic and comprehensive stability tests (upon exposure to illumination, moisture, thermal, and other complex conditions) toward low-toxic perovskite solar cells have rarely been reported, which calls for more thoughtful strategies to evaluate and improve their stabilities. Overall, the PCEs of pure Sn-based solar cells remain low as compared to those of Pb-based counterparts. Furthermore, the device performance based on other low toxic metal (except for Sn) halide perovskites still lags far behind Sn-based devices. The underlying physical and chemical processes (e.g. intrinsic structure/property relationships, charge transport mechanisms, unresolved thermal or chemical stabilities, etc.) of these materials are still ambiguous. Meanwhile, more efforts to improve the device performance are in urgent demand in future, such as optimization of the device architecture, control of crystal growth and the thin film morphology, promotion of charge transport and interface engineering, etc.
Of many remained challenges, a pivotal one is the toxicity of these non-lead perovskites. There are few toxicity studies toward Pb-based perovskites, and even fewer reports toward non-lead perovskites, which require more research efforts and investigations. If the toxicity of these non-lead perovskites (e.g. Sn-based) is significantly underestimated, or at the expense of much lower device performance and/or expensive constituent materials, is it still worth or necessary to deprecate Pb-based perovskites? In this context, alternative routes to reduce the toxicity of Pb-based perovskites might be more realistic and promising, such as improving the stability of Pb-based perovskites, seeking better encapsulation technologies, and improving integrated recycling utilization.109 However, this calls for more investigations in the next few years and considerable attention needs to be paid to the inevitable toxicity and potential risk to both solar cell producers and the environment.
