    , Accepted 8th January 2017First published on 12th January 2017AbstractPhoton management enables the manipulation of the number of input photons by conversion of two or more light quanta into one (upconversion) or vice versa (quantum cutting). Simultaneous realization of both these processes in a single unit provides unique opportunities of efficient utilization of photons throughout a broad spectral range. Yet, concurrent realization of these two parallel optical processes in one single unit remains elusive, limiting its impact on many existing or possible future applications such as for panchromatic photovoltaics. Here, we describe an epitaxial active core/inert shell/active shell/inert shell fluoride nanostructure to implement upconversion and quantum cutting within spatially confined and isolated rare-earth-doped active domains. The core area transforms infrared photons through trivalent erbium (Er3+) ions into three- and two-photon upconverted visible and near infrared luminescence, while the second shell domain splits an excitation photon into two near infrared photons through cooperative quantum cutting from one trivalent terbium ion (Tb3+) to two trivalent ytterbium ions (Yb3+). The inert layer in between the active domains is able to effectively suppress the destructive interference between upconversion and quantum cutting, while the outermost inert shell is able to eliminate surface-related quenching. This design enables the colloidal core/multishell nanoparticles to have an upconversion quantum yield of ∼1.6%, and to have a luminescence yield of the quantum cutting process as high as ∼130%. This work constitutes a solid step for flexible photon management in a single nanostructure, and has an implication for photonic applications beyond photovoltaics.
Introduction
Photon management is a concept which involves conversion of input photons with a computed energy quanta output, spectrally transforming light to meet demand for applications ranging from bioimaging to photovoltaics.1–5 An example is the conversion of a highly energetic photon (e.g., ultraviolet, UV) to photons with lower energies using photon multiplication processes such as multiexciton generation in inorganic semiconductors or quantum cutting (QC) by rare-earth ions incorporated in a dielectric matrix.3,4 These multiplication processes allow for efficacious utilization of the high energy carried by a UV photon without involving intraband relaxations of excitation energy which results in heat generation. Multiexciton generation in quantum dots has been shown to produce carrier multiplication, which is attractive for photovoltaics.6,7 Another example of photon management is utilization of photons on the other end of the spectrum, the infrared (IR) region. These photons are often not energetic enough for many applications involving photoactivation. By utilizing upconversion processes such as multiphoton absorption,8 triplet–triplet annihilation,5 and rare-earth upconversion (UC),2 the IR photons can be upconverted to the shorter wavelength region to be effective. This approach of in situ upconversion also takes advantage of deeper penetration ability of IR photons in most media including a silicon based solar device as well as a thick biological tissue, which are utilized in a range of applications such as bioimaging,9 volumetric displays,10 and photodynamic therapy.11
Photon management with simultaneous realization of both QC and UC processes in a single unit would provide unprecedented opportunities for numerous applications such as efficient utilization of photons all the way from UV (using quantum cutting) to IR (using upconversion) for photovoltaics (PV) devices. Compared to a physical mixture of UC and QC nanoparticles, the combined UC and QC process in one nanostructure will result in more uniform light conversion in space and will be easier to merge with the role of light-absorbing layers. Moreover, the realization of both UC and QC processes in one nanostructure provides possibilities for both photon management processes to be simultaneously enhanced by the plasmonic effect with more controllable metallic–nanomaterial interaction. Many current photodetectors (e.g., the Si and GaAs photodetectors) have low sensitivity in the UV range and are unresponsive to infrared light, as can be seen from the photoresponsivity of the crystalline Si material (Fig. 1a). Management of input photons can increase or extend the spectral sensitivity range of such photodetectors.
 Fig. 1  (a) The AM1.5G solar spectrum versus the silicon photoresponsivity and the absorption of lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots with excitation absorption peak at ∼1000 nm, which are typically used for colloidal quantum dot solar cells and the inorganic–organic hybrid solar cells. A fraction of terrestrial sunlight unutilized or under-utilized for most solar cells has been highlighted and can be converted [through a quantum cutting (QC) process or an upconverison (UC) process] into the range where silicon or PbS quantum dots have a high sensitivity. (b) A proposed core/multishell nanostructure to realize both QC and UC processes in spatially confined regions for concurrent spectral conversion. UC occurs in the active core region (blue), while QC occurs in the second active shell layer (blue). The first inert layer (magenta) is utilized to inhibit the interference between the active domains, while the outmost inert third shell layer (magenta) is used to suppress surface-related quenching mechanisms by spatial isolation of the active domains from the environment. 
Moreover, photon management provides a means to break the Shockley–Queisser limit in single-junction solar cells, as it enables circumventing two main limitations of current solar cells that encompass the light transmission losses of IR light and intraband relaxation of UV-produced hot excitons.12–21 Solution processed materials of silicon (quantum dots or wires) and lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots, both with typically defined bandgaps of 1000–1100 nm (Fig. 1a), are widely used as light-harvesting substances for the third generation solar cells, such as colloidal quantum dots and inorganic–organic hybrid single-junction solar cells.22–25 Moreover, recent design has enabled the perovskite solar cells to have a photoresponse reaching 1100 nm,26 or to utilize the NIR range through upconversion nanoparticles.27 Management of the transmitted IR photons beyond 1100 nm and the underutilized UV photons below 500 nm into useful visible photons will produce a synergistic effect in the active layer for improving solar cell efficiency.
However, concurrent realization of UC and QC in a single unit remains a critical challenge due to different natures of these two nonlinear optical processes. Rare earth ions can provide a solution to realize both QC and UC with one structure due to the ability to rationally control energy transfers within their abundant ladder-like energy level structures.28 Efficient photon upconversions in colloidal 80 nm sized LiYF4:Er3+ and 30 nm sized (NaYF4:Er3+)/NaYF4 core/shell nanoparticles have been reported for light conversion from ∼1500 nm to ∼550, ∼650, and ∼980 nm.29,30 Quantum cutting of vacuum ultraviolet into visible photons with a quantum efficiency of 190% has been achieved in LiGdF4:Eu3+ bulk crystals by Wegh et al.31 More recently, near infrared (NIR) quantum-cutting of visible light has also been demonstrated in Ln3+/Yb3+ (Ln = Tm, Er, Pr and Tb) co-doped materials, showing promises for solar cells as the NIR emission at ∼990 nm has energy above the band-gap of silicon (∼1.15 eV).32–35 However, investigations of quantum cutting processes in colloidal nanocrystals remain elusive. We show here that nanocrystals of a core/shell/shell/shell structure provide a practical solution for combining quantum cutting and upconversion into one nanosystem by spatial isolation of rare-earth dopants in nanodomains to implement their distinct roles (Fig. 1b). The adverse interaction between two active domains (the core and the third shell layer) can be minimized by inserting an inert isolating layer between them with a precisely defined shell thickness. In addition, the outmost inert shell is able to suppress surface-related quenching mechanisms from the surrounding environment, thus enabling high efficiencies for upconversion and quantum cutting processes.
Herein, we report on a core–shell–shell–shell architecture of NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+@NaYF4 nanoparticles for concurrent UC and QC implementation (Fig. 1b). We select the Yb/Tb pair to implement QC, as this ion couple is a classic model for the cooperative QC process. The resulting core–multishell nanoparticles were demonstrated to combine QC from UV (355 nm) and VIS (488 nm) to VIS and NIR, with UC from ∼1.5 μm to VIS and NIR. The thickness of the NaLuF4 layer was varied in order to be employed as the “inert” layer for blocking the adverse cross-relaxation between the UC layer and the QC layer.
Experimental section
Materials
Yttrium(III) chloride hexahydrate (YCl3·6H2O, 99.99%), erbium(III) chloride hexahydrate (ErCl3·6H2O, 99.9%), ytterbium(III) chloride hexahydrate (YbCl3·6H2O, 99.99%), terbium(III) carbonate hydrate (Tb2(CO3)3·H2O, 99.9%), lutetium(III) oxide (Lu2O3, 99.99%), yttrium(III) oxide (Y2O3, 99.99%), ytterbium(III) oxide (Yb2O3, 99.99%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 98%), ammonium fluoride (NH4F, 98%), sodium trifluoroacetate (98%), trifluoroacetic acid (98%), 1-octadecene (90%), and oleic acid (90%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Instrument
The size and morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by using a JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a Siemens D500 diffractometer using Cu KR radiation. The 2θ angle of the XRD spectra was recorded at a scanning rate of 5° min−1. Upconversion emission spectra in the range of 480–1100 nm were recorded using an EPP 2000 fiber spectrometer (Stellar Net Inc.). Laser excitation at 1523 nm was provided by a tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO, Levante Emerald, APE, Germany) pumped by the second harmonic of a Nd:YVO4 laser (High Q Laser, Australia) emitting at 532 nm with a pulse width of 6 ps and a repetition rate of 76 MHz. A SPEX 270 M spectrometer (Jobin Yvon) equipped with an InGaAs TE-cooled photodiode (Electro-Optical Systems, Inc.), was used to record quantum cutting photoluminescence spectra in the range of 800–1200 nm, while a Fluorolog-3.11 Jobin Yvon spectrofluorimeter was used to record down-conversion photoluminescence spectra in the range of 450–800 nm. Laser excitation at 488 nm is provided by an Argon laser, while at 355 nm is through the third harmonic generation of a Nd:YAG laser (LOTIS TII). The emission signal from the sample in the cuvette was collected at 90° relative to the exciting laser beam. The decays of the emissions were recorded using an Infinium oscilloscope (Hewlett-Packard) coupled to a PMT of a Fluorolog-3.11 Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer (at 542 nm), or to a NIR PMT of a Jobin Yvon SPEX 270M spectrometer (at 1000 nm). A nanosecond pulsed laser at 355 nm through the third harmonic generation of a Nd:YAG laser (LOTIS TII) at a repetition rate of 20 Hz was utilized to perform the excitation. The laser irradiance was calculated by dividing the input laser power (measured with a laser power meter, Coherent Inc.) with the laser beam area, which was defined using 1/e2 of the peak power for the Gaussian laser beam profile. The beam area for the excitation laser at 488 nm was estimated to be about 4.9 (±0.5) mm2, and to be about 1.4 (±0.2) mm2 for the excitation laser at 1523 nm, which corresponds to an area of 0.42 (±0.06) mm2 at the focal point of lens (with a focal length of 10 cm). The size of the focal spot of laser at 1523 nm was determined from the focus size = 1.83 × λ × f/A, where λ is the wavelength of the laser emission, f is the effective focal length of the lens, and A is the entrance beam diameter. All spectra shown in this work have been calibrated for the system responses of the spectrophotometers utilized using a NIST-traced calibration light source (HL-2000-CAL-ISP, Ocean Optics).
Synthesis of NaYF4 core nanoparticles
In a typical procedure, 1 mmol RECl3·H2O (RE = Y, Er) was added into a 100 ml flask containing 10 ml oleic acid and 15 ml octadecene. The mixture was heated to 160 °C at a rate of 12 °C min−1 and maintained at this temperature for 60 min under gentle argon gas purge, then allowed by itself to cool down to room temperature. Subsequently, a solution of 4 mmol NH4F and 2.5 mmol NaOH in 10 ml methanol was added and stirred for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then heated at 100 °C for 30 min to remove the methanol, followed by heating up to 300 °C at a rate of 12 °C min−1 and maintaining at 300 °C for 60 min before cooling down. A syringe needle was used to let the argon gas out during the synthesis. The mixture was naturally cooled to room temperature and precipitated by using excess ethanol and collected by centrifugation at 18144 rcf for 7 minutes. The precipitate was washed with ethanol several times, and the nanocrystals were dispersed in hexane.
Synthesis of core–shell nanoparticles
Detailed procedures for each type of lanthanide-doped core/shell nanoparticles are described in the ESI.† Here we briefly describe the procedure. The core–shell nanoparticles were synthesized by a thermal decomposition method. 0.5 mmol (active layer) of RE2O3 was dissolved in 10 ml of 50% trifluoroacetic acid at 95 °C in a three neck flask. Then, the solutions were evaporated to dryness under an argon gas purge. Next, 10 mL of oleic acid, 10 mL of 1-octadecene, 2 mmol of NaCF3COO and 1 mmol NaYF4 core were added into the flask. The resulting solution was then heated at 120 °C with magnetic stirring for 45 min to remove water and oxygen under gentle argon gas purge. The brown solution was then heated to 320 °C at a rate of about 12 °C min−1 under argon gas protection, and maintained at this temperature under vigorous stirring for 45 min. A syringe needle was used to let the argon gas out during the synthesis. The mixture was naturally cooled to room temperature, precipitated by using excess ethanol and collected by centrifugation at 18144 rcf for 7 minutes. The precipitate was washed with ethanol several times, and the nanocrystals were dispersed in hexane.
Results and discussion
First, we separately optimized doping concentrations of rare-earth ions that account for UC and QC processes in the NaYF4 host matrix which is considered to be one of the most efficient host materials, to obtain high efficiencies for both processes. The trivalent erbium ions (Er3+) were selected as dopants for the UC process, while the trivalent ytterbium (Yb3+) and terbium (Tb3+) ions were selected as dopants for the QC process. Nanocrystals of NaYF4 doped with Er3+ ions upconverting light at ∼1.5 μm were well studied by us earlier; it has been determined that 10% of Er3+ is the optimized doping concentration to reach the highest UC efficiency in the NaYF4 nanomatrix.30 To investigate the possibility for QC implementation within this nanomatrix, NaYF4 nanoparticles co-doped with 2%Tb3+ and x%Yb3+ (x = 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80) were synthesized using a protocol adapted from our recent work.36 It is well known that the particle size (and the corresponding surface-to-volume ratio) determines the amount of surface-related luminescence quenching, which impacts the UC and QC efficiencies tremendously.37 Varying the Yb3+ doping concentration can result in the formation of nanoparticles with distinct sizes, due to the dopant-induced transient polarization effect during the particle growth process.38 To prepare nanoparticles doped with varied Yb3+ concentrations but of the same size, to exclude difference in the size-induced surface effects, we controlled the nanoparticle size by varying the amount of the coordinating ligand, oleic acid (see the ESI†).39 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the synthesized nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2a–e. The size of NaYF4:2%Tb3+,x%Yb3+ (x = 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80) nanoparticles was found to be 42 ± 0.8, 43 ± 0.2, 42 ± 0.2, 43 ± 0.8, and 44 ± 2.2 nm, respectively, substantiating the uniform size of the synthesized nanoparticles. Note that the shape of these nanoparticles evolves from nanospheres to hexagons with the increase of Yb3+ ions. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 2f confirm that the crystallographic structures of all nanoparticles are hexagonal.

Under excitation at 355 nm, nanoparticles of NaYF4:2%Tb3+,x%Yb3+ (x = 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80) manifest photoluminescence (PL) emission in visible and NIR ranges. Excitation at this wavelength populates the 5D3 state of the Tb3+ ions, followed by nonradiative relaxations of the Tb3+ ions to the 5D4 state (see Fig. 6d). As shown in Fig. 3a, there are seven peaks in the range of 450–700 nm, which correspond to the 5D4 → 7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0) transition of the Tb3+ ions.40 The NIR PL band in the 900–1000 nm range can be ascribed to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of the Yb3+ ions, since the nanoparticles without the Yb3+ ions (NaYF4:2%Tb3+) do not display NIR PL. The emission from the Tb3+ ions in the visible range becomes weaker with the increase in Yb3+ doping, suggesting more efficient excitation energy transfer (ET) from Tb3+ to Yb3+. At the same time, the NIR PL intensity decreases with an increase in the concentration of Yb3+, which implies a competition between the ET-induced enhancement and the Yb3+ concentration-induced quenching of NIR PL. The concentration quenching is attributed to the cross relaxation between the Yb3+ ions.37,41 It is important to note that though the number of Yb3+ ions in the excited state seems to be conserved by the cross relaxation process, however, it is in fact significantly reduced, as the energy migration can cause the excitation not to be deactivated through luminescence, but to be delivered to the quenching sites (traps) within or on the surface of these nanoparticles. A higher Yb3+ ion concentration favors energy migration due to a shorter distance between Yb3+ ions, and allows the migration of excitation energy to reach trapping sites more readily, consequently resulting in luminescence quenching. To further prove the ET between Tb3+ and Yb3+, the excitation spectra were acquired for PL of Tb3+ (at 532 nm, 5D4 → 7F5 transition) and Yb3+ (at 990 nm, 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition) (see the ESI, Fig. S1†). The coincidence of the PL excitation spectra observed at ∼532 nm and at ∼990 nm illustrates ET from Tb3+ to Yb3+ ions.42 The decays of the VIS PL at 542 nm (excited at 355 nm) and of the NIR PL of Yb3+ at 990 nm (excited at 980 nm) for nanoparticles with different concentrations of Yb3+ were also acquired; the observed shortening of the lifetime of PL at ∼542 nm with the increase in the Yb3+ concentration confirms the occurrence of ET between the Tb3+ and the Yb3+ ions (see the ESI, Fig. S2†). The observed shortening of the Yb3+ NIR PL lifetime at ∼1000 nm with an increase in the Yb3+ ion concentration illustrates the concentration-related quenching of NIR PL due to cross-relaxation between the Yb3+ ions. Using the decays for VIS PL shown in Fig. S2,† the theoretical QC efficiency can also be determined.28 Based on the measured lifetime, the maximal QC efficiency can be as high as ∼173% for nanoparticles doped with the Yb3+ concentration of 80% (ESI, Table S2†). Yet, the NIR PL was found to be the most intense for the sample with the lowest doping concentration of 20%Yb3+ (Fig. 3a), where the concentration-quenching is the lowest (corresponding to a theoretical QC efficiency of 144.83%). The intensity of NIR PL emission of the sample doped with 20%Yb3+ is about 1.2 times higher than that of NaYF4:2%Tb3+,40%Yb3+, and 2 and 7 times higher than that of nanoparticles doped with 40% and 80% Yb3+ ions, respectively (Fig. 3a). The same behavior for NIR PL from Yb3+ was observed when directly exciting the 5D4 state of the Tb3+ ions at 488 nm (Fig. 3b). Since nanoparticles of NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+ display the most intense NIR PL, these doping concentrations were used in the next experiment.

After optimizing the UC and QC emission intensities in regard to dopant concentrations, we combined UC and QC processes together within the same nanoparticles, realizing the core–multishell architecture through an epitaxial growth strategy. We have chosen to have UC in the core domain and QC in the shell domain, since it looks preferable to have the UV-Visible excitable QC process close to the nanoparticle surface than in the core, because of higher scattering for UV light. At the same time, the NIR light used to excite UC PL is not scattered much in this arrangement, which allows us to combine efficient NIR-excitable UC and UV-VIS excitable QC processes within the core–multishell nanostructure. Er3+ ions were selected as the dopant to realize the UC process, which have shown efficient UC PL when doped into fluoride nanocrystals under excitation at ∼1.5 μm. Thus, the designed core–multishell nanostructure includes the UC core containing Er3+ ions, and the active QC shell containing Tb3+/Yb3+ ion combination, as discussed above. We employ an inert layer with low phonon energy (NaLuF4) to separate the active core and shell and minimize the detrimental cross-relaxation between active layers separated by this inert layer. NaLuF4 is an excellent host lattice, which enables the NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4 core/shell nanoparticle to emit with the same efficiency as the NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaYF4 core/shell nanoparticle (Fig. S3†).43 Yet, the difference between the atomic numbers of Lu and Y is able to produce a TEM imaging contrast between the NaLuF4 and NaYF4 domains in a single nanoparticle, providing compelling evidence for the formation of a core/multishell nanostructure. The outmost inert shell layer in the NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+@NaYF4 core–multishell nanoparticles is utilized to suppress surface-related quenching effects. These nanostructures were prepared using a method adapted from our recent work which can reach an atomic monolayer deposition precision (ESI, Table S1†).36 It should be noted that the deposition of an inert NaYF4 layer on the surface of NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+ resulted in about 3-fold enhancement of QC NIR PL (Fig. S4†), due to suppression of surface-related quenching. Owing to a high phase contrast between NaYF4 and NaLuF4, the prepared core–multishell nanostructures as well as the involved transition core–shell structures can be clearly resolved by TEM microscopy. The morphology and size distributions of the consecutive nanostructures of NaYF4:10%Er3+ (core), NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4 (core @inert layer), NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+ (core@inert layer@active shell) and NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+@NaYF4 (core@inert layer@active shell@inert shell) can be determined from the TEM images and size histogram results presented in Fig. 4 and S5–S8 in the ESI.† As can be seen in Fig. 4a–e, the periphery of nanoparticles looks darker than the center area, illustrating the formation of NaLuF4 on the surface of NaYF4:10%Er3+ nanoparticles and allowing us to evaluate the thickness of the NaLuF4 layer. Moreover, the formation of NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+ and NaYF4 layers on NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4 nanoparticles can be confirmed by TEM (Fig. 4f–j) and linear scanning of a single nanoparticle in the dark-field TEM image (Fig. 4k and l), which is consistent with the recent report that elements can be confined in the core–shell by a solution synthesized method.44 Thus, the TEM results substantiate the formation of NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+@NaYF4 core–multishell nanostructures with varying thicknesses of the first inert layer.

(l) A line scanning of a single nanoparticle of NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+, 20%Yb3+@NaYF4 with a NaLuF4 layer thickness of 5 nm. 
We excited the core–multishell nanoparticles of NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+@NaYF4 at 1523 nm (18 W cm−2) and 488 nm (0.45 W cm−2), respectively (according to the absorption spectrum of NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+@NaYF4 nanoparticles in Fig. S9†). The obtained spectra in Fig. 5a and b show the UC emission from Er3+ and the QC emission from Yb3+/Tb3+, revealing that both UC and QC processes can work independently in the designed core–multishell structure. Note that, despite the existence of the PL peak at ∼980 nm from Er3+ ions when excited at 488 nm, the observed NIR PL peak at ∼980 nm in Fig. 5b mainly arises from the QC process of the Tb3+/Yb3+ ion pairs, as indicated by the comparison of PL spectra from NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4 and NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+@NaYF4 nanoparticles (Fig. S10b†). The integrated PL intensities of UC and QC were plotted versus the thickness of the first isolation layer of NaLuF4 (Fig. 5c). As one can see, both the UC and QC PL intensities increase with an increase in the thickness of the NaLuF4 layer from 0 (no inert layer) to 1.5 nm, reaching an apparent plateau of 1.7-fold enhancement when the thickness is over 3 nm. This observation verifies that the inert shell NaLuF4 layer can reduce detrimental cross-relaxation processes between the UC core and the QC shell, and such a quenching effect can be eliminated when the thickness is beyond a threshold value of 3 nm. The intensity of NIR QC PL from the core/multishell NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+@NaYF4 nanoparticles is almost identical to that from the core/shell NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+@NaYF4 nanoparticles with an inert shell thickness of ∼4.2 nm (see ESI Fig. S10a†), indicating a negligible surface-related quenching effect of the core/multishell nanostructure. The luminescence quantum yield is an important parameter to characterize the radiative ability of photoluminescent materials; it is defined by the ratio of the number of emitted luminescent photons to the number of the absorbed excitation photons. For the core/multishell NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+@NaYF4 colloidal nanoparticles, we found the upconversion quantum yield to be ∼1.6%, and the luminescence yield of the quantum cutting process was found to be as high as ∼130% (see ESI Fig. S11 and S13†). The realization of over-a-unit luminescence quantum yield of a QC process in colloidal core/multishell nanocrystals holds promises for a plethora of photonic applications as described earlier.

To establish the mechanisms of the UC and QC processes simultaneously occurring in the core–multishell nanoparticles, the dependence of the PL intensity on the excitation power density was investigated for the core–multishell nanoparticles with a 3 nm inert layer. The number of photons involving in both the UC and QC processes can be calculated based on the formula: I ∝ Pn, where I is the PL emission intensity, P is the pump laser power density, and n is the number of photons involved in the excitation process.2 As shown in Fig. 6a, the power density dependencies for the four UC PL bands plotted in a log–log scale are nearly linear. The slopes of the fitting lines, were 1.73 ± 0.01, 1.53 ± 0.03, 1.11 ± 0.02 and 1.02 ± 0.01, for the emissions at 550, 660, 810, and 980 nm respectively, which are similar to those in our previous reports,29,30 yet different from the actual number of photons involved for the 980 (2-photon), 810 (2-photon), 660 (3-photon), and 550 nm (3-photon) UC emissions.45,46 The deviation of our results from the real numbers of photon processes is associated with the saturation effect in the intermediate 4I13/2 state, which has a long lifetime to produce a reservoir for excited populations.30 On the other hand, the slope for dependencies of QC PL emission peaks at 542, 582, 620, and 990 nm, which correspond to 5D4 → 7F5, 5D4 → 7F4, 5D4 → 7F3, and 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transitions, were determined to be 1.01 ± 0.04, 0.96 ± 0.03, 0.94 ± 0.04, and 0.65 ± 0.02, respectively (Fig. 6b and S14†). The sublinear dependence of NIR PL on the excitation power density at ∼990 nm clearly demonstrates the occurrence of a quantum cutting process, i.e. the ET process from one single Tb3+ ion to two Yb3+ ions. The mechanisms illustrating both UC and QC processes are schematically illustrated in Fig. 6c and d.

Conclusions
We demonstrate that our newly synthesized core/shell/shell/shell nanoparticles are able to implement simultaneous photon upconversion and photon cutting with spatially defined domains in the core (for upconversion) and in the second shell (for quantum cutting). This, to our knowledge, is the first demonstration of such concurrent photon conversion processes in one single unit. The resulting core–multishell NaYF4:10%Er3+@NaLuF4@NaYF4:2%Tb3+,20%Yb3+@NaYF4 nanoparticles manifest both upconversion from ∼1.5 μm to visible (peaks at ∼550 and 660 nm) and NIR (peaks at ∼810 and 980 nm) and quantum cutting from UV (355 nm) to visible and NIR. The introduction of an inert layer of NaLuF4 between the active layer and core suppresses detrimental cross-relaxation processes between lanthanide ions, while the outmost inert shell layer minimizes surface quenching effects, resulting in efficacious concurrent upconversion and quantum cutting processes (the upconversion quantum yield, 1.6%; the luminescence quantum yield for QC, 130%). By an appropriate choice of the dopant ions, the combined UC-QC concept and the core–multiple shell nanoarchitecture described here can be varied to cover a broad spectral range (deep UV as well as longer IR) for photon management. Management of excitation photon in a single nanostructure may open up unprecedented opportunities for photovoltaics and beyond.
