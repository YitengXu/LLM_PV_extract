    , Accepted 22nd December 2016First published on 26th December 2016AbstractTransition metal sulfide nanoparticles currently attract enormous research attention because of their high photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, excellent electron conductivity and low cost. However, single-component metal sulfides suffer from low charge-carrier separation yield and poor chemical stability. Here, we report the synthesis of mesoporous structures of n-type CdS and p-type CuS nanocrystals and investigate their photocatalytic performance for the generation of hydrogen from water. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and nitrogen physisorption data indicate that the resultant CuS/CdS heterostructures consist of a highly porous network (BET surface area ∼198–203 m2 g−1) of connected 5 nm-sized nanoparticles and contain uniform mesopores (ca. 6.4 nm in diameter) within the assembled structure. The nanoparticles are composed of CuS compounds which are in intimate contact with CdS nanocrystals, and these results are corroborated with energy-dispersive and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. These CuS/CdS binary semiconductors can carry out photocatalytic reduction of water under visible light irradiation with a quantum efficiency up to ∼12.6% at a wavelength of 420 ± 10 nm. UV–vis/NIR, photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies show that the superior photocatalytic activity of the CuS/CdS nanoparticle networks mainly arises from a proper alignment of the band-edge positions of the materials, which suppress carrier recombination and permit efficient interfacial charge transport at the p-CuS/n-CdS junction region.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water using semiconductor catalysts is considered to be a promising solution to address the global energy needs.1 The key element of this approach is the development of a photocatalyst that exhibits high visible-light activity, long-term stability and low cost. Currently, transition metal sulfides, and especially the CdS, are attracting broad attention for use in water reduction for hydrogen evolution.2 That is because CdS is a narrow band gap semiconductor which combines visible light photoresponse (Eg ∼2.4–2.5 eV), high electron mobility (∼350 cm2 V−1 s−1) and favorable conduction band (CB) edge potential, well above the thermodynamic threshold for water reduction reaction (−0.41 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), pH = 7)3 – all these characteristics are important for achieving high photocatalytic activity. However, despite these advantages, single-component CdS catalysts exhibit low photon-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency and poor stability due to the insufficient charge separation and anodic photocorrosion.4 Therefore, the development of an effective CdS-based photocatalyst with improved kinetic competitiveness of charge-transfer processes is an interesting challenge.
To overcome these limitations, a variety of CdS-based composite nanostructures such as MoS2/CdS,5 WS2/CdS,6 NiS/CdS,7 Pt/CdS8 and CNT/CdS9 have been developed. Coupling of CdS with other co-catalysts can increase its electron–hole separation yield by the efficient charge carrier dissociation at the interface of the formed heterojunctions. However, even though these hybrid catalysts can achieve a significant increase in photocatalytic H2-production activity over pure CdS, most of them contain precious and rare metals, while others offer a small solid/electrolyte interface area. Very recently, CuS/CdS nanoparticle aggregates have been suggested as a cost-effective and sustainable catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. These studies indicated that CuS particles may expand the light absorption range and prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers of the CdS catalyst.10 Nevertheless, the role of CuS in the photochemical activity of CdS is still poorly understood. Also, these aggregated nanoparticle materials adopt close-packed structures with a low surface area-to-volume ratio, which generally restricts their catalytic performance. Therefore, the preparation of composite CuS/CdS nanostructures with high porosity is attractive because enhanced catalytic performance might be obtained due to their unique morphology.
We recently reported a method to assemble small-sized (4–6 nm) CdS nanocrystals (NCs) into mesoporous architectures through a polymer-templated aggregating process.11 The procedure involves oxidative cross-linking polymerization of thiol-capped CdS NCs in the presence of polyoxoethylene-b-cetyl ether (POE(20)-b-C16) block copolymer aggregates. The framework structure of these materials consists of connected CdS nanoparticles and expresses a large number of surface active sites over which electrolytes can interact. Moreover, owing to the small dimension of the framework constituents the diffusion pathway for excitons to reach the surface active sites becomes smaller and, therefore, high photocatalytic reaction kinetics are achieved. Here we present the synthesis of new 3D mesoporous heterostructures consisting of interconnected CuS and CdS NCs, and investigate their photocatalytic performance for hydrogen generation. The photocatalysts were synthesized from the chemical transformation of the CdS-based nanocrystal assemblies (NCAs) via a partial cation-exchange reaction of Cd2+ with Cu2+ ions. The obtained CuS/CdS NC networks feature various loadings of Cu (ranging from 3 to 8 mol%) and show a large internal surface area and narrow pore-size distribution. We also provide insight into the photoelectrochemical behavior of the CuS/CdS assemblies by combining UV–Vis/NIR optical absorption, photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Our studies show that by tuning the chemical composition, efficient charge separation interfaces between the nanoscale p-type CuS/n-type CdS junctions can be achieved, which greatly enhance the separation of photoexcited charge carriers, and thus the photocatalytic H2-production activity.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Structural analysis of CuS/CdS NCA photocatalysts
Porous networks of connected CuS and CdS NCs were produced by a polymer-templated aggregating assembly of thiol-capped CdS NCs, followed by an ion exchange treatment to replace Cd2+ with Cu2+. In the ion-exchange method, the large disparity in the product solubility, i.e. Ksp values of CdS (8 × 10−27) and CuS (6.3 × 10−36), is the driving force for the spontaneously transformation of CdS into CuS (eqn (1)), giving rise to the formation of CuS–CdS binary semiconductors.12 CdS + Cu2+ → CuS + Cd2+(1)
A series of heterojunction composite assemblies of CdS and CuS NCs with different contents of Cu, i.e. 3, 5 and 8 mol% (denoted as n% CuS/CdS NCAs), was obtained by varying the initial Cu2+ concentration in the reaction mixture. In general, the partial transformation of CdS NCs into CuS/CdS composites involves the following nucleation and growth steps: (i) surface deposition of insoluble CuS on the surface of the CdS, (ii) mutual diffusion of Cu2+ (inward diffusion) and S2− and Cd2+ (outward diffusion) ions, (iii) interior dissolution of CdS, and (iv) interfacial reaction between the Cu2+ and S2− ions at the inner surface of the CuS nanoparticles.13 Significantly, the growth of CuS within the CdS NCs leads to an intimate contact between the two components, in a way that could not be achieved by a simple physical mixture of CdS and CuS particles.14 This is particularly important for photocatalysis since, as we shall discuss later, the interfacial transfer of photoexcited electrons and holes in the p-CuS/n-CdS junction region can suppress the charge recombination and, thus, increase the photocatalytic activity towards H2 production. The presence of Cu atoms in these composite structures was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The EDS spectra obtained from different areas of samples showed the presence of copper at different Cu/Cd atomic ratios, which correspond to a Cu loading from ∼3 to ∼8 mol%; see Table 1 and Fig. S1.† Note that the copper content, as obtained by EDS microanalysis, is consistent with the expected composition from the stoichiometry of reactions, suggesting the complete incorporation of Cu ions into the CdS lattice.

The crystallinity of the products was verified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns of pristine CdS and CuS/CdS composite samples in Fig. 1a display three intense diffraction peaks in 2θ scattering angles from 20 to 60°, which can be assigned to the (111), (220), and (311) reflections of the CdS zinc-blende structure (JCPDS card no. 42-1411). In addition, the remarkable peak broadening of the X-ray reflections points to the formation of materials with a very small grain composition; a peak-width analysis using the Scherrer equation15 gives an average crystallite size of ∼2.6 nm. However, XRD analysis does not provide convincing evidence for the presence of CuS, even in the XRD pattern of the CuS/CdS NCA sample with 8 mol% Cu. This is attributed to the small grain size and high dispersion of CuS nanoparticles in the mesoporous structure. The valence state of Cu atoms in the composite materials was investigated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 1b displays a typical high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cu 2p for the 5% CuS/CdS NCAs, which is the most active catalyst studied in this work. It shows the binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 core-level signals at 932.6 and 952.4 eV, respectively, which are typical values for Cu2+ in the CuS compound.16 The symmetric shape of the Cu 2p peaks suggests that the copper species in the catalyst exist as a single-phase of CuS. Meanwhile, a weak satellite feature at ∼943.2 eV binding energy further confirms the paramagnetic nature of Cu2+.17 The Cd 3d XPS spectrum of the 5% CuS/CdS NCA catalyst, shown in Fig. S2,† reveals a doublet at 404.6 and 411.4 eV corresponding to Cd2+ 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 core-levels in CdS.18

Fig. 2 shows typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the 5% CuS/CdS NCA catalyst. The images reveal a disordered porous network consisting of connected nanoparticles with a grain size of about 5 nm. Also, the pores in these assemblies are formed between the assembled nanoparticles. To probe the crystal structure of the mesoporous network, we utilized selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). The SAED pattern shown in Fig. 2a (inset) displays a series of diffuse Debye–Scherrer rings that can be indexed to the zinc-blende structure of CdS, in agreement with XRD results. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2b, however, reveals the composite structure of the 5% CuS/CdS NCA material. It shows distinct lattice fringes with 3.4, 3.0 and 2.0 Å interplanar spacings that correspond to the (111) facets of cubic CdS and, according to the FFT pattern (inset of Fig. 2b), to the (012) and (008) facets (along the [100] direction) of the hexagonal P63/mmc lattice of CuS, respectively. Taken together the XRD and XPS analysis, these results are consistent with the mesoporous catalysts comprising connected covellite (CuS) and cubic CdS NCs.

The porosity of the as-prepared materials was evaluated by performing nitrogen physisorption measurements at −196 °C. Fig. 3a displays the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distributions of mesoporous CdS and 5% CuS/CdS NCAs. The respective plots for the CuS/CdS composite materials with 3 and 8 mol% of Cu content are shown in Fig. S3.† All the samples exhibited typical type-IV isotherms with a pronounced H2-type hysteresis loop (according to IUPAC classification), which are characteristic of mesoporous materials with interconnected structures.19 The small but resolved adsorption step at the mid-relative pressure range (P/Po = 0.4–0.6) is associated with the liquid nitrogen condensation inside the narrow-sized mesopores.20 The mesoporous CuS/CdS NCAs exhibited a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 198–203 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 0.18–0.19 cm3 g−1, which are slightly lower than those of the pristine CdS NCA sample (238 m2 g−1, 0.21 cm3 g−1). The decrease in the surface area and pore volume for the CuS-loaded materials is presumably due to a partial etching of the CdS NC surface during the ion-exchange process, and thus to a rearrangement of CdS nanoparticles in the porous framework. The pore width in these materials was assessed from the adsorption branch of isotherms using the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) model.21 The results for CdS and CuS/CdS NCAs reveal a quite narrow pore size distribution with an average size of ∼6.4–6.5 nm, see insets in Fig. 3a and S3.†Table 1 depicts the textural parameters for the pristine CdS and CuS/CdS NCA materials.

(b) Optical absorption spectra of mesoporous CdS and CuS/CdS NCAs. Inset: The corresponding Tauc plots, i.e. the curves of (αhv)2versus photon energy (hv), where α, h and v are the absorption coefficient, Planck's constant and light frequency, respectively. 
The electronic structure of the pristine and Cu-containing CdS NCAs was investigated with diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible/near-IR (UV–vis/NIR) spectroscopy. The mesoporous CdS NCAs show a sharp optical absorption onset at around 500 nm, corresponding to the intrinsic interband electron transition in CdS (Fig. 3b). The large blue shift in the energy gap compared to the bulk CdS (2.42 eV) is reflective of the quantum size effects in CdS NCs due to their very small diameter (∼5 nm). The energy band gap of the mesoporous CdS and CuS/CdS NCAs, which is calculated from the corresponding Tauc plots for a direct gap semiconductor (inset of Fig. 3b), varies systematically with the Cu content from 2.54 eV for the pure CdS to 2.47 eV for the 8 mol% Cu loaded sample, see Table 1. This behavior is related to the strong electron interactions between the quantum-confined electronic states in CdS and CuS NCs, indicating that CuS was incorporated into the CdS structure. Careful analysis of the absorption shoulder seen in the range 510–580 nm gives an absorption onset at ∼564 nm (∼2.2 eV), which can be assigned to the band gap transition of CuS.22 The absorption tail at wavelengths longer than 600 nm of the UV–vis/NIR spectra is associated with the d–d electronic transitions of Cu2+.23
2.2 Photocatalytic study
All the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction experiments were carried out under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation, using the Na2SO3–Na2S aqueous solution as sacrificial reagents. It has been suggested that the usage of sacrificial electron donors such as S2−/SO32− not only promotes hydrogen evolution by consuming the photogenerated holes, but also prevents sulfur-containing catalysts (such as CdS) from anodic photocorrosion.24 As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the pure CdS NCAs show a rather low H2-production activity, which corresponds to an average H2 evolution rate of 0.03 mmol h−1, due to the fast recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. In contrast, CuS/CdS NCAs showed a considerable increase in H2-production activity, clearly indicating that the incorporated CuS compound in the CdS structure plays an important role in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. In particular, the catalytic activity of CuS/CdS NCAs increases with the increasing Cu content and reaches an optimum at 5 mol%, achieving a H2 evolution rate of 0.16 mmol h−1, which is about 5.3 times higher than that of the pure CdS. However, a further increase in Cu loading leads to a small reduction of the photocatalytic activity, as inferred by the lower H2 evolution rate of the CuS/CdS sample with 8 mol% of Cu content (0.12 mmol h−1). This is probably related to any one or a combination of the following causes: (i) high Cu content presumably leads to excessive incorporation of CuS clusters that decrease the active surface area of CdS, (ii) excessive growth of CuS particles on the surface of CdS may also reduce the light-harvesting ability of CdS nanoparticles and (iii) CuS with high contents may act as carrier recombination centers, deteriorating the photocatalytic performance.

(c) Photocatalytic H2 evolution rates for different loadings of the 5% CuS/CdS catalyst. (d) Recycling study of the 5% CuS/CdS NCA catalyst. The H2 evolution rates (columns) were averaged over 5 h of illumination. The photocatalytic reactions were performed as follows: 20 mg of catalyst (or 40 mg for stability study) were dispersed in 20 mL aqueous solution containing 0.35 M Na2S and 0.25 M Na2SO3; 300 W xenon light radiation with a long-pass cut-off filter allowing λ ≥ 420 nm. 
Next we proceeded to optimize the reaction conditions by measuring the H2 evolution for different concentrations of the 5% CuS/CdS NCA catalyst, and the results are listed in Fig. 4c. It can be seen that, with increasing catalyst addition, the H2 evolution rate increased to reach a maximum at ∼2 g L−1. The H2-production increase with the catalyst concentration can be interpreted to an enhancement of the light absorption by the catalyst's nanoparticles. On the other hand, an excess amount of catalyst loading (2.5 g L−1) afforded a slightly lower H2-production activity (0.24 mmol h−1), probably due to the light scattering effect from the particles. Of particular note, the 5% CuS/CdS catalyst at 2 g L−1 concentration achieves an average H2 evolution rate as high as ∼0.28 mmol h−1 (or ∼7 mmol h−1 g−1 mass activity). An apparent quantum efficiency (QE) of ∼12.6% at wavelength λ = 420 ± 10 nm was obtained, assuming all incident photons (Nhv = 9.3 × 1016 s−1) were absorbed by the catalyst's nanoparticles. This efficiency is among the highest reported values for noble metal-free metal sulfide photocatalysts; a comparison of the photocatalytic H2-evolution activities of different metal sulfide nanostructures is shown in Table S1.†25 Notably, the 5% CuS/CdS NCA catalyst showed a higher activity than CuS-loaded CdS microparticles. In particular, when a CdS bulk solid containing ∼5.1 mol% Cu (as obtained by EDS analysis, Fig. S4†) was used as a catalyst (denoted as 5% CuS/CdS bulk), it afforded a H2 evolution rate of 0.025 mmol h−1 under similar conditions, which is remarkably lower than that of 5% CuS/CdS NCAs. This may be attributed to the low surface area of 5% CuS/CdS bulk (BET surface area ∼45 m2 g−1, Fig. S5†). Therefore, we suggest that the enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of CuS/CdS NCAs is related to the formation of CuS/CdS nanojunctions, which enable the separation of electron–hole pairs (see below), and the interconnected pore structure and large catalyst/water interface area, which facilitate mass transport between the nanoparticles and provide more active sites accessible to reactants.
The NC-linked mesoporous CuS/CdS network also is highly stable under the examined conditions. The stability of the 5% CuS/CdS NCA catalyst was assessed by performing four consecutive 5 h photocatalytic tests. After each test, the catalyst was isolated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, washed with polysulfide solution to remove adsorbed sulfur species, and re-dispersed in a fresh reaction solution. Before the photocatalytic reaction, the reaction cell was de-aerated by purging with argon until no H2 and O2 were detected (by GC analysis). As shown in Fig. 4d, the 5% CuS/CdS NCA catalyst exhibits a quite stable H2 evolution rate (within 5%) over 20 hours’ illumination. A small decrease in the H2 evolution rate during the third cycle of reuse may hint some minor photocorrosion of the CdS lattice, and thus the formation of sulfur species on the catalyst surface.5,8a,25b,h Although, the mass loss of the catalyst during the isolation process is a possible explanation for the lower reactivity. The X-ray microanalysis spectrum and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained to examine the chemical and structural stabilities of the reused catalyst. EDS results showed a ∼5.09 mol% of Cu content (Fig. S6†), while N2 adsorption data indicated a surface area of ∼180 m2 g−1, pore volume of ∼0.20 cm3 g−1 and pore size of ∼6.2 nm (Fig. S7†), which are similar to those of the fresh sample. However, after catalysis the XPS spectrum of 5% CuS/CdS shows that a fraction of Cu2+ ions is reduced to Cu+, judging from the shift of the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 signals to the higher energies (at 933.2 and 952.9 eV, respectively),26 see Fig. 1b. Furthermore, the accompanying Auger Cu LMM line at 569.6 eV indicates the presence of Cu2S species in this sample.27 Thus, it is apparent that CuS was partially reduced to Cu2S during visible light irradiation. Similar to the fresh catalyst, the XPS spectrum of the regenerated 5% CuS/CdS sample showed Cd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 core-level signals with binding energies at 404.7 and 411.5 eV, respectively (see Fig. S2†). These values are very close to those reported for the CdS compound.18
To elucidate the role of CuS in the H2-production activity of CuS/CdS NCAs, we carried out photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction under monochromatic irradiation of λ = 550 ± 10 nm (using a band-pass filter, Asahi Spectra, Japan). In this experiment, the 5% CuS/CdS NCA catalyst exhibited very low H2-production activity (∼4.65 μmol h−1) that corresponds to an apparent QE of ∼0.94% (Nhv = 1.65 × 1017 s−1). Considering that CdS absorbs photons with a wavelength shorter than 500 nm, this activity is attributed solely to the photoexcitation of CuS. Of note, single-component mesoporous CuS assemblies, which are obtained by complete cation exchange of CdS NCAs with a 10-fold molar excess of Cu2+ (relative to CdS), showed a negligible visible-light H2-production activity, even after 4 h of illumination (results not shown). The lack of activity can be attributed to the low reducing power of the conduction band (CB) electrons (−0.33 V vs. NHE, pH = 7) for water splitting and inefficient charge separation in CuS. The above results clearly demonstrate that CuS itself cannot generate a significant amount of H2, although it can extend the light absorbance of the composites to the visible-NIR region (as inferred by UV–vis/NIR spectroscopy). Therefore, we can conclude that the improvement in photoactivity for composite catalysts was mainly due to the efficient charge carrier dissociation at the CuS/CdS interface, which lowers the charge recombination loss. A study of electronic relaxation in CuS/CdS heterostructures by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy indicates that this is indeed the case. Fig. 5a compares the PL spectra of pure mesoporous CdS with those of CuS/CdS NCAs with different Cu loadings. These results reveal that addition of Cu into the CdS structure leads to a gradual quenching of the band-edge excitonic emission at ∼470 nm, which may indicate that the majority of the photoexcited carriers are delocalized over the CuS–CdS heterostructure. Hence the incorporation of the CuS phase seems to retard the radiative recombination of charge carriers through an effective separation of electron–hole pairs along the CuS/CdS junctions.

PL measurements were performed in water (1 mg mL−1) at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. (c) Energy band diagrams of the n-type CdS and p-type CuS semiconductors, before contact. The conduction band (ECB), valence band (EVB) and Fermi level (Ef) potentials of CdS and CuS semiconductors were estimated according to the Mulliken electronegativity theory.28 (d) Band alignment scheme of the formed p–n junction upon contact of CdS and CuS NCs, according to the UV–vis/NIR and EIS results. 
The effect of CuS loading on the electronic band structure and, thus, on the reactivity of the CuS/CdS composites was further investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 5b displays the Mott–Schottky plots and the corresponding fits of the linear portion of the inverse squares of space charge capacitance (1/C2) versus electrochemical potential (E) for the mesoporous CdS and CuS/CdS NCAs containing 3, 5 and 8 mol% Cu. The results show that the flat-band potential (EFB) of these materials shifts gradually to a more negative (cathodic) direction, that is from −0.40 V to −0.53 V (NHE, pH = 7), as the Cu content increases from 0 to 8 mol%. Moreover, the electron donor density (ND) of CdS decreases on addition of 3 mol% Cu, and then progressively increases with the increasing Cu content up to 8 mol%, as evidenced by the change in the slope of the 1/C2versus E lines; the Mott–Schottky plots give a carrier density of 3.93 × 1016 cm−3 for CdS NCAs and 3.28 × 1016, 3.71 × 1016 and 4.55 × 1016 cm−3 for CuS/CdS NCAs featuring 3, 5 and 8 mol% Cu content, respectively (Table S2†). Furthermore, the negative slopes of the Mott–Schottky plots indicate the n-type behavior of CdS, as expected.
The observed cathodic shift in the flat-band positions and increase in donor (electron) density in CdS upon CuS addition can be explained by considering the formation of p–n heterojunctions between the CdS and CuS nanoparticles; it is well known that the CuS is a p-type semiconductor.29 When these semiconductor NCs are placed in contact with each other, given that the Fermi level of n-type CdS (ca. 4.5–4.9 eV) is located well above the Fermi level of p-type CuS (ca. 5.1–5.3 eV),30 a built-in potential of approximately 0.4–0.6 V is formed at the interface of the CuS/CdS junction (Fig. 5c). This results into an internal electric field which drives electrons from the CB of CdS to CuS until the system reaches equilibrium. Under these conditions, the flow of electric carriers generates a depletion layer (positively charged region) in CdS and an accumulation layer (negatively charged region) on the CuS side of the p-CuS/n-CdS junction; indeed, the formation of a depletion region in CdS also explains the observed initial decrease in donor density in CdS NCs when a small amount (3 mol%) of Cu is incorporated, see Table S2.† By increasing CuS loading, as a result of the internal electric field and accumulation of electrons in CuS, its CB will gradually shift, and eventually rise above the CB potential of CdS (Fig. 5d). This assumption is also supported by the cathodic shift in EFBs and the increase in ND values with the increasing Cu content in CuS/CdS NCA materials.
Overall the nanoscale p–n CuS/CdS junctions facilitate the efficient distribution of charge carriers through the cathodic shift of the EFB and the appropriate alignment in the band-edge positions of the composites. These effects definitely have a great impact on the photocatalytic processes within the CuS/CdS heterostructures. Under visible light irradiation, both CdS and CuS get excited and generate electron–hole pairs. The favourable thermodynamic conditions of the band structure and the internal electrostatic field drives the transfer of the photoexcited electrons from the CB of CuS to the CB of CdS, giving rise to an accumulation of electrons in CdS where H2 evolution takes place. In addition, during the course of irradiation, a fraction of photoexcited electrons from the valence band (VB) of CdS may also be transferred to the CuS NCs, causing their partial reduction to Cu2S (E° = −0.91 V vs. NHE, pH = 7); the transition energy for this electronic excitation was estimated to be approximately 2.9 eV (∼430 nm), and it is a viable option.14,31 The presence of Cu2S in the regenerated 5% CuS/CdS NCA catalyst was evidenced by XPS spectroscopy. We believe that these in situ formed CuS/Cu2S nanoparticles serve as cocatalysts facilitating the charge carrier separation through the interfacial electron transfer from the VB of CdS to CuS/Cu2S and promoting the H2 production according to the following reactions:32 2CuS + 2e− → Cu2S + S2−(2) Cu2S + S2− + 2H+ → 2CuS + H2(3)
Meanwhile, since the VB of CuS nanoparticles lies in a higher potential than that of CdS (see Fig. 5d), the photoexcited holes can migrate to CuS where they oxidize the sacrificial S2−/SO32− reagents to S2O32−/SO42−.32 As a consequence, an efficient charge carrier separation is successfully achieved through the nanoscale p–n junctions of CuS and CdS NCs, thus leading to an enhanced photocatalytic H2-production activity. As a confirmation of this assumption, the PL results have indicated the improved separation of photoexcited electrons and holes within the composite CuS/CdS structure.
3. Conclusions
In summary, mesoporous networks of connected CuS and CdS NCs with a high internal surface area and narrow pore-size distribution have been synthesized and investigated as photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. The results demonstrated that controlling the chemical composition can lead to the formation of efficient charge separation interfaces along the binary CuS/CdS semiconductor, which greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity. As a result, mesoporous CuS/CdS NC assemblies, which contain ∼5 mol% Cu, achieve an average hydrogen evolution rate of 0.28 mmol h−1 with a 12.6% QE at a wavelength of λ = 420 ± 10 nm, while displaying good stability for at least 20 h. The activity of this catalyst is about 5.3 times higher than that of pure mesoporous CdS assemblies, measured under identical reaction conditions. Using UV–vis/NIR, photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we showed that the high H2-production activity of the CuS/CdS nanoparticle networks mainly arises from the proper alignment of the band-edge positions of the materials. The nanoscale p–n junction negatively shifted the band-edge potentials, enhancing the separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs and, thus, the hydrogen evolution rate. These results suggest the great possibility of the implementation of this new mesoporous p-CuS/n-CdS heterojunctional photocatalyst as a sustainable and low-cost alternative in solar energy conversion applications.
4. Experimental
4.1 Synthesis of CdS NCs
CdS NCs (4–5 nm in size) stabilized with mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) were prepared by a wet chemical method. Briefly, 5.5 mmol of CdCl2 and 5.5 mmol of Na2S·9H2O were dissolved separately in 80 mL and 20 mL of deionized water (DI), respectively, under continuous stirring at room temperature. Then, 11 mmol of MPA were added into the CdCl2 solution with vigorous stirring, and the pH of the solution was adjusted at ∼10–11 with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). Next, the aqueous solution of Na2S was added to the above reaction mixture under stirring for about 30 min. The thiol-capped CdS NCs were obtained by precipitation with 2-propanol, followed by centrifugation.
4.2 Synthesis of mesoporous CdS NCAs
In a typical procedure, 250 mg of MPA-capped CdS NCs were dispersed in 2.5 mL of DI water to form a stable colloidal solution. To this solution, 250 mg of the block copolymer Brij-58 (C16H33(OCH2CH2)20OH) dissolved in water (2.5 mL) were added and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. Then, 1 mL of H2O2 (3% w/w) solution was added dropwise and the mixture was kept under continuous stirring at room temperature until gelation (∼30 min). Afterwards, the resulting mixture was placed in an oven at 40 °C for 3 days under static conditions. Removal of the template between the CdS NCs was achieved by soaking the gel product once in 20 mL of ethanol for 2 h and three times in 20 mL of water for 15 min. The mesoporous product was isolated by filtration, washed several times with water and ethanol, and dried at 40 °C for 12 h.
4.3 Preparation of mesoporous CuS/CdS NCAs
Mesoporous networks of CuS and CdS nanocrystals with different Cu contents, i.e. 3, 5 and 8 mol%, were prepared by a chemical ion-exchange process. For a typical synthesis of the 5% CuS/CdS composite, 4.22 mL aqueous solution of CuCl2 (1 mg mL−1) was added dropwise to a 10 mL aqueous dispersion of CdS NCAs (10 mg mL−1) and the reaction mixture was kept under vigorous stirring for 30 min. The final green-brown product was isolated by filtration, washed several times with water and ethanol, and dried at 40 °C for 12 h. For comparison, we also prepared a 5% CuS/CdS catalyst (denoted as 5% CuS/CdS bulk) by direct reaction of CdCl2 with an equimolar amount of Na2S in water, followed by immersing the as-prepared CdS solid in an aqueous solution containing 5 mol% CuCl2 (based on CdS).
4.4 Photocatalytic study
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments were carried out in an airtight Pyrex glass reactor using a 300 W xenon lamp (Variac Cermax) equipped with an UV cut-off filter (Asahi Techno Glass, λ ≥ 420 nm). In a typical reaction, 20 mg of the catalyst were dispersed with stirring in 20 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.35 M Na2S and 0.25 M Na2SO3 as hole scavengers. The temperature of the suspension was maintained at 20 ± 2 °C by using an external water cooling system. Before irradiation, the mixture was purged with argon (Ar) for at least 30 min to remove any dissolved air. The produced H2 was analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
The apparent quantum efficiency (QE = 2NH2/Nhv, where NH2 and Nhv are the number of evolved hydrogen molecules and number of incident photons, respectively) of the catalyst was calculated by analyzing the amount of evolved hydrogen at a given illumination wavelength, using bandpass filters with λ = 420 ± 10 nm and λ = 550 ± 10 nm (Asahi Spectra, Japan). The intensity of the incident light was measured using a StarLite energy meter equipped with a FL400A-BB-50 fan-cooled thermal sensor (Ophir Optronics Ltd, Jerusalem).
4.5 Physical characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD X-ray diffractometer (45 kV and 40 mA) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the Bragg–Brentano geometry. Elemental microprobe analyses were performed by using a JEOL JSM-6390LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an Oxford INCA PentaFETx3 energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector (Oxfordshire, UK). Data acquisition was performed at least four times for each sample using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a 60 s accumulation time. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope (LaB6 filament) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Samples were prepared by dispersing fine powders in ethanol using sonication, followed by depositing a drop of solution onto a holey carbon-coated Cu grid. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained at −196 °C using a Quantachrome NOVA 3200e sorption analyzer. Prior to the measurement, all samples were outgassed at 80 °C under vacuum (<10−5 Torr) for 12 h. The specific surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method33 on the adsorption data in the relative pressure range of 0.05–0.24. The total pore volumes were estimated from the adsorbed amount at the relative pressure (P/Po) of 0.98, and the pore size distributions were obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherms, using the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) method. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis/near-IR spectra were collected using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 optical spectrophotometer. BaSO4 powder was used as a 100% reflectance standard and base material on which the powder sample was coated. Diffuse reflectance data were converted to absorption data using the Kubelka–Munk function α/S = (1 − R)2/(2R), where R is the measured reflectance and α and S are the absorption and scattering coefficients, respectively.34 The energy bandgap (Eg) of the samples was estimated from the Tauc plots of (αhv)2versus photon energy.35 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained at room temperature on a Jobin-Yvon Horiba FluoroMax-P (SPEX) spectrofluorimeter equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp and operated from 200 to 1000 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with an ESCALAB photoelectron spectrometer using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hv = 1486.6 eV). All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak (284.6 eV).
4.6 Electrochemical measurements
Mott–Schottky plots were obtained with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E). A three-electrode set-up, with a platinum plate (1.0 × 2.0 cm2) and a silver–silver chloride (Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl) as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively, was adopted to study the samples. The capacitance of the semiconductor/electrolyte interface was measured at 1 kHz, with 10 mV AC voltage amplitude in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 7). Electrodes for impedance-potential measurements were fabricated as follows: ∼10 mg of catalyst were dispersed in 1 mL DI water and the mixture was subjected to sonication in a water bath until uniform suspensions were formed. After that, 40 μL of the suspension were loaded on the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 10 Ω sq−1) substrates, which were masked using 3M scotch tape with an effective area of 1.0 × 1.0 cm2. The sample was dried in a 60 °C oven for 30 minutes.
