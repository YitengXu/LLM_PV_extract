1. Introduction
The global energy demand and crisis caused by population and economic growth are creating new challenges for meeting the rising demand for energy. Therefore, the utilization of solar, wind, marine and other renewable and clean energy sources as alternatives for conventional fossil fuels is urgently needed. However, these sustainable energy sources are intermittent and immensely depend on time and weather. Encouragingly, these challenges can be tackled by the advances in efficient energy storage devices and energy conversion systems.1–3 However, all of the high-efficiency energy transfer processes based on chemical or electrochemical reactions usually take place with the assistance of active catalysts. Although noble metal based materials have been proven to be the most effective catalysts, their high cost and scarcity severely restrict their long-term viability.4–8 Thus, it is highly desirable to develop alternative earth-abundant catalysts with high activity and long-term durability.9 Cobalt-based complexes as high performance heterogeneous catalysts, including Co oxides/hydroxides,10,11 Co nitrides,12,13 Co sulfides,14 Co selenides15,16 and Co phosphides,17,18 have received considerable research interest.19 Among them, cobalt phosphides have attracted enormous attention owing to their high electrical conductivity and chemical stability.20
Early studies reported that hydrodesulfurization (HDS) works in a similar way to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) where the ad/desorption of hydrogen on catalysts is crucial for achieving fast kinetics.21 Because transition-metal phosphides (TMPs) are typically used as efficient catalysts toward HDS,22 they are also expected to be active for the HER.23 In 2014, Popczun et al. first reported that multifaceted CoP nanoparticles (NPs) were active HER electrocatalysts with good acid-stability.17 This work opened a new avenue for developing cobalt phosphide-based materials as efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, the use of cobalt phosphide-based materials for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution24 and catalyzed hydrolytic dehydrogenation of borohydrides25,26 also attracts great research interest. Indeed, we have witnessed a surge in the development of cobalt phosphide-based materials for efficient hydrogen production with over 100 published papers in the past three years. Moreover, according to our survey, excellent properties including a high electrical conductivity, low charge–discharge potentials, and profound thermal stabilities also endow cobalt phosphides with promising applications in fuel cells and batteries.
This article systematically reviews the latest developments in cobalt phosphide-based materials for energy conversion and storage. We first summarize the most frequently used and some other emerging synthetic methods for the fabrication of nanostructured cobalt phosphides. Then, cobalt phosphide-based materials as efficient catalysts for water electrolysis, water photolysis, borohydride dehydrogenation, and fuel cells, and as electrode materials for batteries are thoroughly discussed. Moreover, the advantages over the synthesis–structure–property relationship for this class of electrocatalysts are discussed. Finally, insights into current challenges and future research directions for cobalt phosphide-based materials are proposed.
2. Synthesis of cobalt phosphides
2.1 Wet chemistry methods
Wet chemistry has proven to be an efficient method for the synthesis of cobalt phosphides, in which trioctylphosphine (TOP) is the most commonly used P source.27 Briefly, different cobalt precursors (such as metal Co NPs and cobalt acetylacetonate) could be phosphorized by TOP in hot organic solvents under an inert atmosphere.17,28 This method is usually used to synthesize uniform and nanosized cobalt phosphide NPs with a certain facet. Metal-rich or phosphorus-rich cobalt phosphides can be obtained by varying the reaction temperature. For instance, Schaak and co-workers have synthesized the morphologically same CoP and Co2P NPs at 290 °C and 330 °C, respectively.27 However, the use of high boiling-point organic solvents such as 1-octadecylene, oleylamine and squalene makes the reaction highly flammable and corrosive.29 Furthermore, the highly inert atmosphere and tedious cleaning process of the final product make it complicated. In addition to TOP, triphenylphosphine (TPP) can also be utilized as an organic P source to synthesize cobalt phosphides through a similar protocol.30 TPP is much cheaper than TOP but a higher reaction temperature is required.30
2.2 Gas–solid reactions
Although wet chemistry methods enable cobalt phosphides with well-defined nanostructures, the sophisticated process and the low yield have severely hindered their applications. The synthesis of cobalt phosphides via gas–solid reactions is more efficient and accessible.21 Among them, the surfactant-free low-temperature phosphidation strategy is the most popular way to prepare cobalt phosphides nowadays. In order to prepare cobalt phosphides, NaH2PO2 and a cobalt-based precursor are placed in two porcelain boats, respectively, with NaH2PO2 at the upstream of the furnace. Subsequently, the samples are heated at a certain temperature for 60 min in a static atmosphere. NaH2PO2 is decomposed to release PH3 at a temperature over 250 °C, which will react with cobalt-based precursors (including metal oxides, hydroxides, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)) to form cobalt phosphides. Similar to wet chemistry methods, the composition of the obtained product is also sensitive to the reaction temperature. For example, in the presence of NaH2PO2, CoP can be obtained by phosphidation of the Co3O4 or Co(OH)F precursor at 300 °C.18,31 However, CoP2 was gained via phosphidation of CoCl2 at 500 °C.32 This surfactant-free method enables the morphology of the precursors to be well preserved at a certain temperature, and it is more applicable for the development of various 3D self-standing cobalt phosphides with different structures. And PH3 gas can be directly used to react with cobalt-based precursors. For example, Pradhan and co-workers synthesized needle type Co2P by passing PH3 gas through a CoCl2 and oleylamine solution at 200 °C.33 It should be noted that PH3 is extremely toxic, and a post-treatment is essential to dispose excess PH3. Furthermore, red phosphorus has been used for the synthesis of cobalt phosphides at a higher temperature compared to NaH2PO2 methods.34–36 In addition, H2 (or CO) reduction of Co3(PO4)2via a chemical vapour deposition process at temperatures over 650 °C also belongs to gas–solid reactions for the fabrication of cobalt phosphides.37 However, the high temperature sintering easily leads to the bulk forms of catalysts.21
Unfortunately, wet chemistry and gas–solid reactions have limitations, such as the use of surfactants, toxic organic solvents or reducing agents, which limit their practical applications in terms of environmental considerations. Therefore, other emerging methods have been developed over the last few years. Electrodeposition provides an energy-saving and environmentally friendly route to synthesize cobalt phosphides. In this case, cobalt phosphides can be directly grown on conductive substrates via electrochemical reduction of Co2+ and H2PO2−.38–40 Furthermore, Dong et al. proposed a photochemical strategy to synthesize CoxP by illuminating an aqueous solution of CdS, CoCl2 and NaH2PO2 under UV-vis light.41 These methods are eco-friendly, but the product yield is relatively low and the morphology of the product is not well defined.
3. Applications of cobalt phosphide-based materials
3.1 Water electrolysis
Water electrolysis, an efficient and clean technology to produce hydrogen with high-purity, involves two half-reactions: the cathodic HER and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER).42,43 The theoretical potential required to initiate the electrolysis of water is 1.23 V vs. the NHE (ΔG0 = 237.2 kJ mol−1);30 however, commercial electrolyzers usually operate at a much larger cell voltage (from 1.8 to 2.0 V).44 Thus, active HER and OER electrocatalysts are highly demanded to reduce the water-splitting overpotential and thereby make this process energy-efficient. Although Pt and the oxides of Ru or Ir are known to be the benchmark catalysts for the HER and OER,7,8 the scarcity and consequently high-cost restrain their long-term viability. Therefore, it is crucial to develop alternative catalysts based on earth-abundant elements.9 Over the past three years, cobalt phosphides have stood out as one of the most promising materials with extremely high stability, catalytic activity and low cost. In this section, we focus on recent progress in cobalt phosphide-based materials as typical catalysts for the HER, OER and full water splitting.

3.1.1 HER. 
3.1.1.1 History and the effect of the Co/P ratio of cobalt phosphides on HER activity. 
To date, TMPs have been brought to the forefront of efficient catalysts and their discovery can be dated back to over 200 years.45 Early studies revealed that TMPs exhibited superb activities for HDS,46,47 which worked in a similar way to the HER. In 2005, Liu and Rodriguez anticipated that the Ni2P (001) surface is highly active toward the HER based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations.23 Afterwards, the high HER performance of nanoporous FeP nanosheets48 and hollow Ni2P nanoparticles49 initiated the applications of TMPs. In 2014, Schaak and co-workers reported that multifaceted CoP NPs were highly acid-stable HER electrocatalysts with excellent performance, which was the first report on cobalt phosphides as a HER catalyst.17 Thereafter, other cobalt phosphides phases with different P contents, including Co2P,30 CoP2 (ref. 32) and CoP3,35,36 are all proven to be efficient HER catalysts.
It has been widely accepted that P atoms in cobalt phosphides play pivotal roles in the HER.27,29 The Schaak group synthesized the morphologically same CoP and Co2P NPs (Fig. 1a–c)27 with similar Co–P bond lengths (Fig. 1d), and they found that slightly higher overpotentials were required for Co2P (η10 mA cm−2 ≈ 95) to drive H2 generation in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 1e) compared to CoP (η10 mA cm−2 ≈ 75). They indicated that the more P content in CoP might provide more possible active sites on catalyst surfaces, which resulted in higher HER activity. Furthermore, CoP2 NPs on reduced graphene oxide sheets (CoP2/RGO) were synthesized by our group which reached 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 70 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4.32 In addition, CoP3 nanoneedle arrays on carbon fiber paper (CoP3 NAs/CFP) and CoP3 concave polyhedrons (CoP3 CPs) prepared by the Chen group both showed superior HER catalytic activities in 0.5 M H2SO4, with overpotentials of 65 and 78 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2, respectively.35,36 In these reports, it seems that cobalt phosphides with larger P content might show higher HER performance; however, there are unavoidable variations in the catalyst morphologies, mass loadings, support materials and accessible surface areas. The DFT calculations indicated that the negatively charged P can serve as a base for trapping positively charged protons during the HER process.23,50 Thus, increasing the content of P in cobalt phosphides might effectively enhance their HER activity. However, the increase of P doping will significantly limit the electron delocalization of metal atoms,45 further delay the conductivity of cobalt phosphides, and result in a reduced HER performance. Therefore, the effects of P content of cobalt phosphides play important roles in HER activity and further investigations are required.

3.1.1.2 Strategies for improving HER activity. 
The fabrication of 3D integrated cobalt phosphide electrodes is an attractive way for improving their electrocatalytic performances.51,52 A 3D self-supported cobalt phosphide-based electrode was first reported by the Sun group.18 The as-prepared CoP nanowire array on a carbon cloth (CoP/CC) was fabricated by phosphating the Co(OH)F/CC precursor with NaH2PO2. This 3D flexible integrated cathode showed remarkable HER activity (η10 mA cm−2 = 67 mV) and superior long-term durability in 0.5 M H2SO4. After that, other self-supported cobalt phosphide nanostructures have also been synthesized, such as CoP nanosheet arrays,53 CoP nanorod bundle arrays54 and CoP mesoporous nanorod arrays,39 which all exhibited remarkable HER activities. The HER activities achieved by these 3D self-supported integrated electrodes should be credited to the following reasons: (1) the direct growth of the active phase on a conductive substrate avoids the utilisation of polymer binders, which always cause additional series resistance; (2) the intimate contact between intriguing ordered array architectures and the highly conductive substrates enables fast electron transfer; (3) the 3D configuration of self-supported arrays exposes more active sites and facilitates the diffusion of the electrolyte and gas.19
The electrocatalytic activity of an electrode is highly concerned with the electrical conductivity and dispersity of the catalyst.29,55 Coupling cobalt phosphides with carbon materials is able to not only improve their dispersity, but also enhance their electrical conductivity.55In situ formation of nano-carbon by phosphorization treatment of a Co-MOF derived precursor is a popular method. ZIF-67 (ref. 56 and 57) and ZIF-9 (ref. 58) precursors are the most frequently used Co-MOFs for the synthesis of CoPx/nitrogen-doped carbon (CoP/NC) composite electrocatalysts. Usually these Co-based MOFs were pyrolyzed at a high temperature to obtain Co/NC which was transformed into CoPx/NC via a post-phosphidation. Another popular approach is directly growing metal precursors on carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs)31,59 or graphene,32,60 and CoPx/C can be obtained by phosphating the corresponding precursors. Apparently, the boosted catalytic performances of CoxP/NC and CoPx/C are attributed to the more exposed active sites and the lower resistance of the catalyst–electrolyte interface.
Doping metal elements is another useful way to tune the HER catalytic capability of cobalt phosphides by optimizing their hydrogen adsorption free energies (ΔGH).55 So far, Fe,61–63 Ni,64–68 Zn,69 Mn,70 Mo,71 Cu,72 Al,73 and Ce74 doped cobalt phosphides all have shown enhanced HER catalytic activities compared with pure cobalt phosphides. And the enhanced activities are associated with the weakened interactions between Co and H atoms and a more thermo-neutral ΔGH after doping. Among these metal elements, Fe and Ni are the most studied dopants. Interestingly, it is reported that for either FexCoyP61–63 or NixCoyP66,67 systems, the highest HER catalytic activities were achieved when the ratio of Fe/Co or Ni/Co is close to 1.0. Although many efforts have been made in doping elements for improving cobalt phosphides' HER activity, the doping effects of different elements are still unrevealed.
In addition to metal elements, non-metal elements played a vital role in modifying the electronic structures of cobalt phosphides. The Jin group demonstrated that the Co octahedra in CoPS contained P2− ligands with greater electron-donating character than S− ligands, leading to a higher HER performance than CoS2.75 Moreover, DFT calculations for CoPS showed that after spontaneous hydrogen adsorption at open P sites, the ΔGH at the adjacent Co sites was comparable to that of Pt (Fig. 2a). Liu et al. designed pyrite-structured cobalt phosphosulfide on CNTs (CoS|P/CNT) by substituting part of the sulfur in CoS2 with phosphorus.76 But the prepared CoS|P/CNT with a tunable P/S ratio only exhibited improved material stability and catalytic durability, rather than enhanced catalytic activity, which was inconsistent with the other report.75 When half of the S atoms were substituted by P as shown in Fig. 2b, the chemical bonding between Co and ligands was strengthened, which improved the chemical stability of this material (Fig. 2c and d). Recently, the Xie group incorporated oxygen element into Co2P, and they found eventually 15 times enhancement of the HER performance gained in alkaline solution (Fig. 2f).77 Furthermore, the theoretical calculations indicated that oxygen incorporation in Co2P not only boosted water dissociation to form adsorbed H but also resulted in an optimal ΔGH compared with pure Co2P (Fig. 2e).

The porous structure favours the mass/charge transport and exposes more active sites, thus resulting in enhanced catalytic performance.55 Numerous methods have been applied for the synthesis of nanoporous structures of cobalt phosphides. Yang et al. prepared a 3D nanoporous Co phosphide/phosphate thin film (PCPTF) through the reaction of anodized Co oxide PTF with phosphorus vapour (Fig. 3a and b).78 The PCPTF showed enhanced HER performance compared to the compact film in both acidic and alkaline media. De-alloying is another efficient method to design 3D self-support nanoporous materials by selectively dissolving the less noble components of an alloy while the remaining alloy forms a nanoporous structure by self-diffusion and self-assembly.79 Chen and co-workers synthesized a bicontinuous nanoporous cobalt phosphide (np-Co2P) by selectively dissolving the cobalt phase in Co80P20 ribbons (Fig. 3c and d).80 The as-prepared np-Co2P exhibited excellent HER activity in both acidic and basic media. Apart from this, electrodeposition was used to fabricate porous structures. Kwon and co-workers prepared a novel porous cobalt-phosphide (Co–P) foam with macropores of approximately 6 μm by one-step electrodeposition as shown in Fig. 3e and f.40 For the HER, the Co–P reached 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 50 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, which was only slightly higher than that of commercial Pt/C (η10 mA cm−2 ≈ 45).

3.1.2 OER. 
3.1.2.1 History and the effect of the Co/P ratio of cobalt phosphides on OER activity. 
In recent years, the OER activities of cobalt phosphide-based catalysts also attract great research activities. In 1989, Kupka and Budniok electrocatalytically fabricated Ni–Co–P alloys and studied their OER performance.109 This was the first report on metal phosphides as an electrocatalyst for the OER. They found that both crystalline and amorphous phases of Ni–Co–P were all oxidized to their corresponding oxyhydroxides during the OER process. Since then, no further progress has been made until the Yoo group reported that CoP can act as a remarkable OER electrocatalyst by in situ generating a new oxygen-evolving catalyst in 2015.110 By analysing the post-catalysis sample of CoP NPs they found that these phosphides experienced dramatic metamorphosis under oxygen-evolution conditions and transformed into discrete phosphate enriched cobalt-oxo/hydroxo molecular units. Hence, for cobalt phosphide-based OER electrocatalysts, the true active sites were actually their oxidation products. After that, intensive research studies have been performed and very similar results have been achieved.111,112 Mechanistic studies proposed that Co-based catalysis of the OER in alkaline media involves four successive steps:10Step I: CoII + 3OH− ↔ CoIIIOOH + H2O + e−Step II: CoIIIOOH + OH− ↔ CoIVO(OH)2 + e−Step III: CoIVO(OH)2 + 2OH− ↔ CoIVOO2 + 2H2O + 2e−Step IV: CoIVOO2 + OH− → CoIIIOOH + O2↑ + e−
Steps I, II, and III are reversible and mainly determine the OER rate, while Step IV is irreversible and very fast. A similar OER mechanism also takes place on cobalt phosphide-based catalysts where the surface Co atoms are partially oxidized to CoOOH and form a CoxP/CoOOH hierarchical structure.113 These in situ changes generate abundant active catalysts and the CoxP core ensures their good electroconductivity, all of which make cobalt phosphides one of the most effective OER electrocatalysts.114
It is well known that electroconductivity is crucial for the electrocatalytic activity of all electrocatalysts.114 The Mar group reported that metal-rich phosphides showed greater metallic character and less ionic character through X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopy (XPS) along with a charge potential model.115 For different cobalt phosphide-based OER catalysts, the true active phases are the in situ generated CoOOH “shell”, and its corresponding phosphide phase just acts as the “conductive core”. Under this consideration, the metal-richer phosphides should be more catalytically active due to their greater metallic character which could generate more active sites and provide higher electroconductivity. This assumption was partly proved by Jin and co-workers in 2016, who prepared Co2P and CoP nanowires (NWs) with the same morphology (Fig. 4a and b) through a microwave-assisted approach.116 The Co2P NWs (η10 mA cm−2 ≈ 265) showed superior OER activity compared to CoP NWs (η10 mA cm−2 ≈ 320) in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 4d), which was due to their better conductivity as shown in Fig. 4c. The CoP2/RGO,32 CoP3 NAs/CFP36 and CoP3 CP35 electrocatalysts discussed in the HER part also presented good OER performance in 1.0 M KOH with overpotentials of 300, 334 and 343 to afford 10 mA cm−2. However, we can't just conclude that less content of P in cobalt phosphides means higher OER activity, because it is meaningless to compare all the above results together as they did not follow identical conditions. What's more, with the OER proceeding, more and more P in cobalt phosphides will be converted into the O phase. Thus, the impact of the stoichiometry of phosphide in cobalt phosphides on their OER activity still needs further work.

3.1.2.2 Strategies for improving OER activity. 
The strategies for optimizing the HER catalytic activity of cobalt phosphides are also applicable to the OER. First, conductivity is one of the important parameters for electrocatalytic performances which can be improved by coupling catalysts with carbon materials. Xing and co-workers physically mixed CoP materials with carbon to enhance the electronic conductivity. As expected, their OER activities were significantly improved.111 Pyrolysis of Co-based MOFs at high temperature is an efficient way to introduce nanocarbons into the catalyst system. Wu and co-workers synthesized porous N-doped graphitic carbon-coated CoP NPs (CoP@GC) through simultaneous pyrolysis and phosphidation of ZIF-67.117 The as-prepared CoP@GC reached 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 345 mV while CoP NPs needed an overpotential of 410 mV to achieve the same current density. Furthermore, growing materials on highly conductive carbon materials such as CNTs112 or graphene118 can also yield significantly enhanced OER performances.
Incorporation of a suitable foreign element is an effective method to optimize the OER activity.114,119–121 Yu and co-workers fabricated a series of Co-based bimetallic phosphide ultrathin nanosheets (CoM-P-NS, M = Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn) by phosphorization of bimetallic MOF nanosheet precursors (Fig. 5a).122 CoM-P-NS (Fig. 5b and c) showed enhanced OER catalytic in alkaline electrolytes. They found that the optimized CoNi(20:1)-P-NS achieved 10 mA cm−2 at an unexpectedly low overpotential of 209 mV (Fig. 5d), outperforming all transition-metal-phosphide electrocatalysts reported to date and even commercial RuO2 and Ir/C. The DFT calculations revealed that the free energy of the rate-determining step (the *O formation ΔG*O = 1.57 eV) decreased with Ni doping for O2 evolution (Fig. 5e). In another case, anions played a crucial role in altering the catalytic activity. The Qiao group found that O doping could enhance the OER performance of Co2P, which can be attributed to increased active sites in the electrocatalyst after doping.108

Porous structure based electrocatalysts provide rich active sites, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.123,124 A template-assisted route is an efficient way to synthesise catalysts with nanoporous structures. Liu et al. synthesized porous CoP polyhedrons by phosphorization calcination of Co3O4 polyhedrons (by annealing ZIF-67 at 300 °C). As expected, the porous polyhedrons showed superior OER activity compared with particulate CoP.101 Furthermore, by simultaneous pyrolysis and phosphidation of ZIF-67, Chen and co-workers obtained highly active porous N-doped graphitic carbon-coated ultrasmall CoP NPs.117 Zhu et al. designed a well-defined mesoporous CoP nanorod array on Ni foam with a high specific surface area (148 m2 g−1) by an electrodeposition method, which also showed remarkable catalytic activity.39 These porous structures of catalysts feature a high specific surface and fast mass transfer ability thus leading to high catalytic performances.114

3.1.3 Full water splitting. 
Designing earth-enriched bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the HER and the OER could simplify the design of the overall system and lower the costs of manufacturing.137 An ideal bifunctional electrocatalyst for full water splitting should be both active and stable for the HER and OER under identical conditions. The highly capable performance of cobalt phosphides for both the HER and the OER in alkaline solution makes them promising bifunctional electrocatalysts to drive overall water splitting. In this section, we will discuss typical cobalt phosphide-based materials for overall water splitting.
Sun and co-workers fabricated a cobalt-phosphorus-derived film (Co–P, consisting of metallic cobalt and cobalt phosphide) on copper foil which showed outstanding electrocatalytic performance towards both the HER (η10 mA cm−2 = 94) and the OER (η10 mA cm−2 = 345) in 1.0 M KOH.38 When serving as both the anode and the cathode for full water splitting, the Co–P/Co–P couple demonstrated good performance and stability with a voltage of around 1.64 V to reach 10 mA cm−2. Compared with films, the catalysts directly grown on a current collector expose more active sites and facilitate the diffusion of the electrolyte and gas, consequently leading to a more efficient electrocatalysis.39 Single-crystalline CoP nanowires on Co foam (CoP NWs/CF) were synthesized by a fast one-step thermal phosphorization reaction between CF and red P vapour at 600 °C.34 The alkaline electrolyzer composed of two CoP NWs/CF electrodes only needs a cell voltage of 1.56 V to reach 10 mA cm−2.
3.1.3.1 Strategies for improving full water splitting activity. 
Coupling with carbon materials for porous nanostructures can be used for improving the full water splitting performance of cobalt phosphides.138 You et al. prepared Co–P/NC nanopolyhedrons (composed of CoP and Co2P NPs embedded in N-doped carbon) by direct carbonization of ZIF-67 followed by phosphidation.57 The as-prepared Co–P/NC showed a high specific surface area (183 m2 g−1) and large mesopores. The Co–P/NC-based overall water electrolyzer achieved 165 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 2.0 V along with superior durability. Such a superior electrocatalytic performance of Co–P/NC was attributed to the high specific surface area and great conductivity due to the porous carbon encapsulation.
Doping cobalt phosphides with foreign elements can further improve the full water splitting activity of cobalt phosphides. The Chen group fabricated bimetallic nanoporous (np) (Co1−xFex)2P (Fig. 6a) by selective electrochemical etching of precursor Co–Fe–P ribbons.62 The optimal np-(Co0.52Fe0.48)2P catalyst showed outstanding catalytic activity towards full water splitting in 1.0 M KOH with an operating voltage as low as 1.53 V to drive 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6b). The excellent catalytic performance of np-(Co0.52Fe0.48)2P is inherently associated with its bicontinuous nanoporous structure and the alloying effect. Furthermore, the Qiao group developed Fe and O doped Co2P on nickel foam (CoFePO@Ni foam, Fig. 6c) by annealing CoFeOH in the presence of TPP at 600 °C.108 As shown in Fig. 6d the obtained CoFePO catalyst electrode displayed outstanding catalytic performance toward overall water splitting with a cell voltage as low as 1.565 V to afford 10 mA cm−2 which even outperformed that of the Pt/C–IrO2 counterparts (1.72 V). The remarkable performance was achieved by modulating the anion and cation percentages in metal compounds which increased the number of active sites. Ni is another common metal element used to enhance the full water splitting activity. Yin et al. reported that the highest full water splitting performance was achieved when x was designed to be 0.31.104 Yu and co-workers prepared bimetallic Ni1−xCoxP alloy films (Fig. 6e) with hierarchical morphologies and tunable Ni/Co ratios.106 In their studies, Ni0.51Co0.49P exhibited the best performance in a two-electrode electrolyser (Fig. 6f). Furthermore, compared with Yu's work, the NiCoP nanosheets on Ni foam synthesized by Liang et al. exposed more active sites and exhibited superior performance toward full water splitting (Fig. 6g and h).105 It should be mentioned that the foreign element doping amount has disparate effects on the HER and OER, and thus when it comes to full water splitting, many factors should be taken into consideration.

The catalytic activity and stability of cobalt phosphide-based catalysts, along with their various and scalable fabrication processes, promise their use as attractive non-precious metal catalysts toward energy-efficient large-scale electrolytic production of hydrogen fuels for multiple applications. Table S1† lists a detailed comparison of cobalt phosphide-based catalysts for overall water splitting.

3.2 Solar hydrogen evolution
Solar energy is a clean, renewable and the most plentiful energy source in nature, and thus the ability to harness and utilize solar energy is of great significance. Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting received extensive research interest since Honda and Fujishima discovered H2 generation on a titania photoanode under solar illumination in 1972.139 In such systems, H2 can be produced via harvesting natural solar energy as the driving force. Although various semiconductors have been investigated as photocatalysts or photoelectrodes for direct water splitting, they still suffer from fast electron–hole recombination, photocorrosion and insufficient reaction sites.140 Encouragingly, integrating appropriate co-catalysts with light-absorbing materials offers a promising strategy to solve these problems.140 Recently, metal phosphide systems have drawn intensive attention as potential co-catalysts especially cobalt-based phosphides. We will focus on recent progress in cobalt phosphide-based materials as co-catalysts for photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution in this section.

3.2.1 Co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. 
The Fu group first found that monodispersed Co2P NPs can be used as efficient co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production with CdS nanorods as photosensitizers and DL-mandelic acid as the electron donor.141 They demonstrated a H2 production rate of up to 19373 μmol g−1 h−1 after 10 h LED light irradiation and the corresponding quantum yield was 6.8%. Later, Du and co-workers fabricated core–shell amorphous CoPx/CdS nanorods (NRs) for photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light.142 With an optimum loading of CoPx and optimized concentration of Na2S/Na2SO3, the H2 evolution rate reached up to ∼500 μmol h−1 mg−1 and the apparent quantum yield reached ∼35%. Moreover, they maintained 70 h photocatalytic stability. The improved photocatalytic H2 evolution of CoPx/CdS NRs can be ascribed to the intimate contact of interfaces which facilitated fast electron transfer from the conduction band of CdS NRs to CoxP. In addition to CdS, cobalt phosphides can also serve as co-catalysts to enhance the photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of TiO2, C3N4 and carbon nitrides. For example, Yue et al. reported the synthesis of CoP on TiO2 with a photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 8350 μmol h−1 g−1 (triethanolamine as the electron donor) which was 11 times higher than that of pristine TiO2.143 Jiang and co-workers prepared CoP/g-C3N4 hybrids as photocatalysts with triethanolamine as the sacrificial electron donor. The highest H2 generation rate of CoP/g-C3N4 is 474.4 μmol h−1 g−1 which is ∼131 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4, and is even better than that of Pt/g-C3N4. Very recently, Liu et al. demonstrated a single-site Co1-phosphide confined on phosphorus-doped graphitic carbon nitrides (Co1-phosphide/PCN) as a photocatalyst for overall water splitting without using sacrificial reagents.144 The Co1-phosphide/PCN hybrids suspended in pure water demonstrate a H2 evolution rate as high as 410.3 μmol h−1 g−1. The atomically dispersed Co1-phosphide active sites favour the efficient charge separation and transfer resulting in the boosting of both H2 and O2 evolution. All of these results suggest that cobalt phosphides are promising co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.
Wu and co-workers using Co2P/CdS as a model system, combined with theoretical calculations, unraveled that the electrocatalytic process played a critical role in heterostructured photocatalytic H2 evolution systems and the Fermi level of phosphide could be used as a feasible descriptor for the photocatalytic activity.145Fig. 7a shows that an additional electron transfer (ET) channel from the shallow trap state TS1 to the Co2P part was opened. The mean relaxation lifetimes were 538 ± 34 and 417 ± 22 ps for bare CdS and CdS/Co2P, respectively (Fig. 7b). Fig. 7c shows that the loading of Co2P onto CdS NRs resulted in a severe PL quenching of CdS NRs. It was found that both the relaxation lifetime changes and the PL quenching were attributed to the significant suppression of the photoexcited charge recombination in CdS NRs after the introduction of Co2P. Furthermore, the mechanistic details of co-catalysts were also elucidated in an electrochemical way with the aid of theoretical calculations. As shown in Fig. 7d, the injecting of electrons could cause the upshifting of the Fermi level magnitude (EF) of Co2P, thus providing a driving force for H2 evolution. The authors concluded that a higher Fermi level can be expected to provide a larger driving force for H2 evolution, thus leading to a relatively higher photocatalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 7e and f the Fermi-level upshifting follows the order Co2P > CoP > Ni2P, which is consistent with their photocatalytic activities.

Cobalt phosphide-based materials have also been intensively studied as co-catalysts coupled with photocathodes for PEC hydrogen evolution.146 Roske et al. coupled CoP NPs with n+p-Si microwires (MWs) which can access higher catalyst mass loadings compared with a planar substrate.147 However, the parasitic resistance caused by the poor contact results in a low regenerative cell efficiency (ηIRC of 1.9%).148 Good electrical and mechanical contact between the catalyst and light absorber can largely enhance the activity of photoelectrodes.148 Jin and co-workers integrated a CoPS layer with nanostructured n+–p–p+ silicon substrates and the CoPS/n+–p–p+-Si photocathode exhibited notable performance for solar-driven H2 production with an onset photovoltage of 450 mV and ηIRC nearly 5%.75 The improved performance originates from the intimate interfacial contact and optimized CoPS layer thickness. Recently, the Jaramillo group coated thin and conformal CoP films onto an n+p Si semiconductor by a red phosphorus-based vapor phase phosphidation of Co evaporated n+p Si.149 The high-quality interfaces endowed the CoP–n+p Si photocathode with a high TOFavg value and activity (only needs 0.345 V to achieved 10 mA cm−2). Furthermore, cobalt phosphide is able to be coupled with p-type Cu2O as a photocathode for solar H2 generation. The CoP/Cu2O photocathode fabricated by Hu and co-workers could drive 5.3 mA cm−2 and 4.2 mA cm−2 at 0 V under acidic and basic conditions, respectively.150 This catalytic performance is one of the highest activities for Cu2O-based photocathodes.151 Cobalt phosphides have been proven as promising co-catalysts for solar-driven H2 evolution; however, the relative research studies on solar-driven O2 evolution are limited. Weng et al. coated TiO2 NWs with N-doped carbon-wrapped CoP (CoP/CN) for solar-driven O2 evolution and the as-prepared TiO2 NWs@CoP/CN photoanode achieved 3.74 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V which is much higher than that of pristine TiO2 NMs (0.78 mA cm−2).152 This attempt may inspire researchers to design appropriate cobalt phosphide-based materials as novel co-catalysts for effective full water splitting under visible light.

3.3 Dehydrogenation of borohydrides
Hydrolysis of chemical hydrides (e.g., NaBH4153,154 and NH3BH3 (ref. 155 and 156)) is also one of the promising techniques for hydrogen production, and the hydrogen generation mechanisms are as follows:(1) NaBH4 + 3H2O → NaBO3 + 3H2(2) NH3BH3 + 2H2O → NH4BO2 +3H2
Hydrogen is stored both in the chemical hydride itself and in water, and thus these hydrolysis reactions are very attractive for use as hydrogen generators, and can be widely applied in fuel vehicles and other portable devices.157 However, noble and non-noble-based catalysts are necessary for the rapid release of hydrogen from such hydride aqueous solutions. Cobalt phosphide based materials have been extensively used in hydrolysis reactions of such hydrides for hydrogen production as listed in Table S2.† Amorphous Co–P based alloys are usually prepared via electrodeposition methods with powder/film-like 2D structures (Fig. 8a and b),158,159 which have inferior activities and stabilities. The Sun group designed a 3D self-supported crystalline CoP nanoarray by a chemical vapour phosphidation method for NaBH4 hydrolysis reactions. They found that the self-supported CoP nanoarray can work not only as an efficient and stable catalyst, but also as a switch for on-demand hydrogen release (Fig. 8c and d).25,26 Doping is a useful approach to tune the activity of catalysts. And just like deposited Co–P based catalysts (e.g. Co–P–B,160 Co–Ni–P158 and Co–W–P161), Fe–CoP prepared by phosphating its hydrothermally prepared ion doped-precursor also exhibited much higher catalytic performance than pure Co–P.162 Furthermore, it was reported that the alloying of P into Co–P–B catalysts was able to improve their intrinsic activity by forming new Co clusters as active sites on the catalyst surface.163

3.4 Fuel cells
Fuel cells, including direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs), have been regarded as one of the most promising future power sources.164–167 Fuel cells are electrochemical devices, which can convert chemical energy into electrical energy via an anodic fuel oxidation reaction and a cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Traditional Pt-based fuel cell catalysts exhibit the highest electrocatalytic activities on both the anode and the cathode.4–6 However, self-poisoning and high-cost seriously impede their widespread applications. Therefore, advances in improving the catalytic activities and lowering the costs of both anode and cathode catalysts are in urgent need.

3.4.1 Fuel oxidation reaction. 
Among the catalytic applications of cobalt phosphides in fuel cells, oxidation reactions on anodes have been extensively studied. Sun and co-workers directly used a cobalt phosphide nanowall array on conductive carbon cloth (CoP NA/CC) as a catalyst electrode for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR).168 Furthermore, Shen and co-workers synthesized Co2P on graphitized carbon and further deposited Pt NPs to afford a new Pt–Co2P/C catalyst with a porous morphology. The electrochemical testing showed that compared with commercial Pt/C, the as-prepared Pt–Co2P/C exhibited nearly four times higher catalytic activity along with a 120 mV more negative onset potential.169 Peng and co-workers developed a CNT supported Pt–CoP electrocatalyst (Pt/CoP/CNTs) for the MOR. The modification of CoP decreased the Pt particle size considerably and correspondingly exposed more active sites. Therefore, Pt/CoP/CNTs showed a high MOR activity of 1600 mA mg−1, which is six times larger than that of Pt/CNTs.170 It is also reported by Xing et al. that the presence of CoP in the Pt-based catalyst can promote the methanol oxidation to CO2 and anti-poisoning properties of Pt.171 Inspired by this result, Zhang and co-workers found that CoP material could also suppress the poisoning problem of Pd catalysts during formic acid oxidation. The good anti-poisoning ability of Pd–CoP/C was evidenced by notably faster kinetics and fewer poisoning intermediates adsorbed on its surface compared with Pd/C catalysts.172


3.4.2 Oxygen reduction reaction. 
Efficient catalysts for the ORR on the cathode are of vital importance for fuel cells and cobalt phosphides with different nanostructures have been widely applied in this area. Murray and co-workers prepared Co2P nanorods via a hydrothermal phosphating method, and reported that Co2P nanorods have comparable activity but more stable performance compared with conventional Pt catalysts for the ORR in alkaline media.173 Additionally, urchin-like CoP nanocrystals were also reported with superior ORR catalytic activity.174 Furthermore, cobalt phosphides can also be used to alter the ORR catalytic activity of doped carbon materials by tailoring their electronic structure. For example, Liu and co-workers fabricated CoxP NP decorated heteroatom doped mesoporous CNTs through carbonization of cobaltous acetate coupled organic–inorganic hybrid polymeric nanotubes. The CoxP NPs embedded in the graphitic carbon layers presented two types of phase states (CoP and Co2P) via controlling the carbonization temperature. It was found that the electronic interaction between the embedded Co2P NPs and the heteroatom-doped carbon structures could greatly improve the ORR performance of the heteroatom-doped carbon nanostructures.175 Wang and co-workers fabricated a Co2P and CoxN NP embedded nitrogen-rich carbon sandwich architecture with the support of N-doped graphene (denoted as CoNP@NC/NG) (Fig. 9). It was shown that the positive synergistic effect of the coexistence of Co–P and Co–N bonding and the strong coupling between the NC and CoNP NPs largely enhance the interfacial electron transfer between the catalyst surface and reaction intermediates, leading to high ORR catalytic activity.176

3.5 Electrochemical energy storage
To date, as another type of high-efficiency intermediate device for energy storage and conversion, electrical energy storage (EES) technology has also garnered widespread attention. In virtue of their high energy and power densities along with long lifespan, EES devices including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs) play a crucial role in the current energy electronics market. It is a consensus that novel active electrode materials are the critical factor to enhance the electrochemical performance of EES devices for their practical applications.177,178

3.5.1 Lithium ion batteries. 
Recently, transition-metal phosphides, especially cobalt phosphides, have been investigated as potential candidates for electrochemical catalysis and energy storage. The lithium-storage mechanism of cobalt phosphides could be explained by the conversion reaction mechanism, which can be described as the following equation:CoPn + 3nLi+ + 3ne− → nLi3P + M
In the above reaction, the bonds between cobalt and phosphorus are broken followed by the formation of metal Co and Li3P during charge/discharge processes. The theoretical Li uptake of CoPn goes through a direct conversion mechanism. However, the conversion of CoP should be explained by a two-step insertion/conversion process. Khatib et al. put forward this hypothesis via preliminary magnetic measurements and the process of conversion could be expressed as follows:179(1) CoP + xLi → LixCoP(2) LixCoP + (3 − x)Li → Li3P + Co0
This process can be further confirmed by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. The voltage hystereses for insertion/conversion processes are one order of magnitude larger for the conversion process than that for the insertion process.
Like most of the metal oxides, one major drawback that confines the practical application of cobalt phosphides is their dramatic volume variation during cycling, resulting in pulverization, aggregation and decreasing electrical contact between functional materials and the collector.180 In order to address these problems, constructing active materials at the nanoscale is an effective strategy which mainly benefits from a higher interfacial contact area and short electronic and ionic diffusion path as well as better accommodation of the volume expansion.181 Another challenge for the practical application of cobalt phosphides is their low intrinsic electrical conductivity. In this regard, hybridizing cobalt phosphides with carbonaceous materials including graphene and carbon shells/networks could effectively promote their electrochemical performance via larger electrode–electrolyte contact areas and shorter electronic and ionic diffusion paths.182
Graphene sheets with a high surface area, excellent conductivity and good stabilities have been regarded as an ideal matrix for many metal phosphides. Lu et al. synthesized Co2P nanorods/graphene nanocomposites using a facile solution method.183 It is interesting that the obtained Co2P/graphene nanocomposites exhibited a high capacity of 900 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles of the galvanostatic charge/discharge process and an outstanding rate performance of 892 mA h g−1 retained after 300 cycles, which was more superior than the lithium-storage performance of sole Co2P (540 mA h g−1) and graphene (421 mA h g−1). Yang et al. synthesised a CoP nanowire/RGO composite which also showed an outstanding performance.184 The above results indicate that composited cobalt phosphides with graphene can not only prevent the possible aggregation of nanosized materials, but also promote the electronic transmission of electrode materials.
Recently, MOFs and their derivatives are widely applied in catalysis and electrochemical energy storage and conversion due to their large surface area, tunable pore sizes and 3D skeleton structures.185,186 In particular, ZIF, fabricated from metal ions coordinated with imidazole ligands, was used as an ideal precursor to obtain metal oxides, sulphides and phosphides/nitrogen-doped carbon composites.187,188 For example, Xia et al. synthesized cobalt phosphide NPs/nitrogen-doped carbon nanohybrids (CoxP–NC) using a facile and ZIF-67 derived self-template strategy.189 At 800 °C, the prepared CoxP–NC with two phases of Co2P and CoP exhibited a stable capacity of about 550 mA h g−1 for 1000 cycles and an excellent reversible specific capacity of 1224 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. Similarly, Zhu et al. also reported the synthesis of ultrafine CoP NPs embedded in NC through phosphating the ZIF-67 precursor (Fig. 10a).190 The TEM image shown in Fig. 10b clearly revealed the dense CoP NPs at the edge of CoP/NC. In order to investigate the electrochemical route of the CoP/NC electrode, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests were carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 10c and d, respectively. In Fig. 10c, the reduction peak located at around 1.0 V was related to the irreversible reaction between CoP and Li+, corresponding to the obvious discharge platform at around 1.0 V in the first curve of GCD results (Fig. 10d). Furthermore, the small peak located at around 0.6 V should correspond to the further lithiation reaction to form LiP and Co. The broad peak at around 0.1 V was related to an irreversible decomposition of the electrolyte to form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The obtained active material exhibited a high specific capacity of 522.6 mA h g−1 over 750 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1 and excellent cycling stability (Fig. 10e). The superior electrochemical performance of the CoP/NC electrode for LIBs was ascribed to the reduced lithium transport path during insertion/extraction. Furthermore, the 3D NC matrix improved the electrical conductivity and structural stability of the active material.

3.5.2 Sodium ion batteries (SIBs). 
Due to the abundance and low cost of sodium, SIBs become ideal alternatives to LIBs. However, it is difficult to rapidly intercalate or extract Na ions from electrode material because of the larger radius of Na ions than that of Li ions.191 Recently, cobalt phosphides have been regarded as promising negative electrode materials for SIBs owing to their high theoretical capacity (894 mA h g−1). Li et al. synthesized CoP NPs through a productive and facile ball-milling way.192 The resulting CoP NPs exhibited a high initial specific capacity and superior rate capability. However, the poor stability of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and the huge volume expansion of CoP during the sodiation/desodiation process lead to a dramatic capacity degradation of sole CoP. It is crucial to combine CoP nanostructures with conductive carbon. Ge et al. synthesized porous core/shell structured CoP@C polyhedrons anchored on 3D RGO on nickel foam (NF) as a high-performance negative electrode material for SIBs using ZIF-67 as the precursor (Fig. 11a).193 The SEM image (Fig. 11b) of CoP@C-RGO-NF showed that the well-defined CoP@C polyhedrons with an average size of 800 nm were tightly anchored on the surface of GO. When used as a negative electrode material for SIBs, the resulting CoP@C-RGO-NF delivered a specific capacity of 473.1 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. 11c) and high rate capability (Fig. 11d). Based on the above reported literature, the main electrochemical reactions of CoP during the sodiation/desodiation process areCoP + 3Na+ + 3e− → Co + Na3PP + 3Na+ + 3e− ↔ Na3P

4 Summary and outlook
In this review, we focus on recent progress made in cobalt phosphide-based materials as efficient non-noble-metal catalysts for energy-related applications, which include water electrolysis, water photolysis, dehydrogenation of borohydrides, fuel cells and batteries. Cobalt phosphides have drawn intensive studies in just the past three years owing to their superior HER electrocatalytic performance since it was first reported in 2014. There are still plenty of potential opportunities for developments and advances in cobalt phosphide-based materials. Herein we highlight some insights into their current existing challenges and future directions.
(1) Cobalt phosphides are now efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting. From Co2P to CoP3, the content of P was proved crucial to both the HER and the OER performance. However, compared with CoP and Co2P, the studies on CoP2 and CoP3 are extremely few, even though they both showed promising electrocatalytic activities. Thus, we expect future studies on CoP2 and CoP3 from unravelling their mechanistic details for the HER and OER to optimizing their activities by using techniques such as using additives and surface modifications.
(2) Probing the electrocatalytic activity of single cobalt phosphide NPs is a significant yet still challenging issue. Electrocatalytic amplification is an efficient means for obtaining insight into the collision of small NPs. The Bard group applied this strategy and found that 5 ± 1 is the minimum number of platinum atoms necessary for water reduction.194 Furthermore, they studied the electrocatalytic activity and geometric properties of individual Pt NPs towards the hydrogen oxidation reaction via nanometer-scale scanning electrochemical microscopy.195 Indeed, nano-electrochemistry is becoming more and more powerful in monitoring the performance of single NPs. It can be expected that nano-electrochemistry will also be useful for the characterization of single cobalt phosphide NPs which deserves more efforts.
(3) Cobalt phosphides as co-catalysts for photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution also deserve further studies. The application of cobalt phosphides for solar H2 evolution is still at a nascent stage, and thus an in-depth understanding of the mechanism is still in great demand. More effective techniques also need to be explored to ensure an intimate electrical and mechanical contact between the semiconductor and the co-catalyst. Future research should also focus on the use of cobalt phosphides as co-catalysts for photocatalytic oxygen production.
(4) So far, there has been a lot of research on the application of cobalt phosphide-based materials as promising catalysts for dehydrogenation of borohydrides. However, facile and economical fabrication methods of such catalysts with a high surface area and stability are still a critical issue, which limits their commercial applications. Furthermore, there is also a long way to go for the wide application of cobalt-phosphide-based materials in the fuel cell area, and theoretical and experimental studies are further expected for understanding the mechanisms of cobalt and phosphorus in oxidation reactions.
(5) More efforts should be devoted to decreasing the initial capacity loss of cobalt phosphides as an electrode material, which is normally caused by the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of SEI films. For nanostructured electrode materials, the large irreversible Li consumption is due to the high contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte leading to intensive surface reactions. In this regard, pre-lithiation is an efficient way to supply an additional Li resource.196 Furthermore, it can also be effective to coat a protective layer on metal phosphides.197 We believe that the rational design of nanostructured cobalt phosphides is an efficient way to obtain high-performance electrode materials.
