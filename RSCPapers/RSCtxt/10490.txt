    , Accepted 24th August 2019First published on 26th August 2019AbstractTwo ultra-narrow bandgap non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F, were designed and synthesized for application in organic solar cells (OSCs). Thiophene and selenophene were used as π-spacers to extend the effective conjugated length via intramolecular noncovalent O⋯S or O⋯Se interactions and lower the bandgap. Both NFAs, 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F, showed strong absorbance in the range of 700–1000 nm in the near-infrared region with an ultra-narrow bandgap of ∼1.30 and ∼1.27 eV, respectively. Using polymer PTB7-Th as the donor, which has complementary absorption and matched energy levels with these NFAs, the optimized device based on PTB7-Th:4TO-T-4F exhibited a PCE of 8.87%, with a low energy loss of 0.55 eV; and the PTB7-Th:4TO-Se-4F-based OSC device gave a PCE of 7.4%, with a low energy loss of 0.57 eV. Our results indicate that increasing the effective conjugate length of the molecular backbone, thus improving the electron-donating ability of the donor unit in NFAs via noncovalent O⋯S or O⋯Se interactions, is an efficient strategy to design and synthesize ultra-narrow bandgap NFAs for OSCs with low energy loss.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have attracted extensive interest in the past few years due to their potential and advantages in the fabrication of large-area, flexible and low-cost devices.1–5 In the past two decades, fullerene derivatives have drawn the most attention and have achieved excellent photovoltaic performance on account of their high electron mobility and high electron affinity.6–12 In spite of the great success, fullerene derivatives have some intrinsic drawbacks, such as weak light absorption, low structural flexibility, and synthetic complexity, which hinder the further improvement of organic solar cell (OSC) performance.13 Recently, the breakthrough in the design and synthesis of non-fullerene acceptor materials has overcome these limitations and the efficiency has dramatically improved.14–19 Compared to fullerene derivatives, NFAs exhibit great exploitation potentialities such as tunable absorption windows and energy levels, large electron mobilities, and facile synthesis with low fabrication cost.20–29 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of NFA-based OSCs have increased dramatically since 2015.30–34 So far, NFA-based OSCs have made great progress with a breakthrough PCE over 15% for single-junction devices and over 17% for tandem devices.35,36 Despite the high efficiency, it is still necessary to develop new NFAs, especially the low-bandgap NFAs, to harvest more light in the solar spectrum range and further improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs to meet the requirements for commercialization of this technology.
Molecular design has played an important role in improving the efficiency of NFA based OSCs. Recently, great effort has been made to develop low-bandgap NFAs with near-infrared (NIR) absorption for high performance OSCs.37–44 A few strategies have been exploited to narrow the optical bandgap of NFAs by increasing the electron donating ability of the donor unit, such as extending the conjugation length, introducing O or S atoms, or a π-spacer to donor units,45–49 or locking the adjacent aromatic rings by noncovalent interactions to restrain the rotation of the single bond to extend the effective conjugation length.42,50 However, increased energy loss (Eloss, Eloss = Eg − VOC) can often be induced when extending the photoresponse range to the NIR region.51–55 Therefore, it is still a great challenge to design narrow bandgap NFAs to further utilize the infrared solar spectrum and improve the PCE of OSCs with low energy loss.
Very recently, we developed novel IDTO-based low-bandgap NFAs with extended conjugation length and high backbone planarity.49 By introducing alkoxy groups to the central core, not only the electron-donating ability was increased, but also the planarity and effective conjugation length were enhanced via the intramolecular noncovalent interactions. These A–D–A type IDTO-based acceptors exhibited narrow bandgaps between 1.38 and 1.45 eV, strong light absorption in the range of 600–900 nm, and high electron mobilities. However, the NFAs with bandgap around 1.4 eV can only harvest the solar light below 900 nm. In this work, based on the above IDTO-based molecules, we designed and synthesized two ultra-narrow bandgap NFAs, 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F, using the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene based 4TO core as the central unit and thiophene and selenophene as π-spacers to extend the effective conjugated length. Two electron-withdrawing groups 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2F-IC) were used as the end group to enhance intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The planarity of the molecular backbone was highly improved via intramolecular O⋯S or O⋯Se noncovalent interactions, resulting in an ultra-narrow bandgap of ∼1.30 eV for 4TO-T-4F and ∼1.27 eV for 4TO-Se-4F. Both NFAs show strong absorbance in the range of 700–1000 nm in the NIR region. Using polymer PTB7-Th as the donor, the optimized photovoltaic device based on PTB7-Th:4TO-T-4F exhibits a PCE of 8.87%, a high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 20.4 mA cm−2 and a very low energy loss of 0.55 eV. Our results indicate that locking the core unit and π-spacer via intramolecular noncovalent interactions to increase the planarity of the conjugated backbone, thus enhancing the electron-donating ability of donor units, is an effective strategy to design ultra-narrow bandgap NFAs for OSCs with low energy loss.
Results and discussion
The synthesis routes for 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F are shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed information is given in the ESI.† Alkoxy-thiophene stannyl derivative 2 was synthesized according to our previous report.49 Compound 3 was prepared as an orange solid via Stille coupling of stannyl derivative 2 with compound 1. The alcohol intermediate was obtained using classical double nucleophilic addition56 of (4-hexylphenyl) lithium with compound 3, and then the central unit 4TO was synthesized by using Amberlyst 15 as a catalyst to catalyze the acid-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction. Compounds 4TO-T and 4TO-Se were obtained via Stille coupling between 4TO-Br and thiophene or selenophene based stannyl derivatives. Then the two 4TO-T and 4TO-Se based dialdehyde intermediates were synthesized by the classical Vilsmeier–Haack reaction in high yields of 80% and 75%, respectively. Finally, the target molecules 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F were obtained using a Knoevenagel condensation of 2F-IC with the corresponding aldehydes. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1, ESI†) revealed that both NFAs exhibit good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature of ∼303 °C for 4TO-T-4F and ∼313 °C for 4TO-Se-4F in a nitrogen atmosphere.

To understand the intramolecular noncovalent interactions and electron distribution of the two molecules, density functional theory (DFT) quantum chemistry calculations at the B3LYP/631G(d) level of theory were carried out and the chemical geometry and molecular frontier orbitals for the two NFAs were obtained. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, both NFAs present excellent planarity, which is beneficial for the intermolecular π–π stacking and for further promoting efficient charge transport. The distance between oxygen in the alkoxy group and heteroatom (S or Se) is ∼2.9 Å, which is smaller than that of the van der Waals radii of O⋯S (3.2 Å) and O⋯Se (3.3 Å),57 indicating the existence of O⋯S and O⋯Se noncovalent interactions. Because of the intramolecular O⋯S or O⋯Se noncovalent interactions, the dihedral angels between the π-spacer and the 4TO central core are as small as 3.8° and 4.7° for 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F, respectively. On account of the high planarity for both 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F (Fig. 2c), the calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) wavefunctions are well delocalized over the whole backbones. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F are −5.19/−3.37 and −5.16/−3.36 eV, respectively. The high-lying HOMO energy level of 4TO-Se-4F, which is consistent with the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry results, could be ascribed to the more electron-donating ability of the selenophene π-spacer in comparison with that of 4TO-T-4F.
As shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†), both 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F exhibit strong and broad absorption in dilute chloroform solution. The absorption maxima are located at 809 nm for 4TO-T-4F and at 832 nm for 4TO-Se-4F with molar extinction coefficients of 1.72 × 105 and 0.97 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. In comparison with solution absorption spectra, the absorption maxima of films for 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F exhibit a large bathochromic shift of 58 nm and 63 nm, respectively. In neat films, both NFAs exhibit sharp shoulder peaks around 770–800 nm due to the strong intermolecular π–π stacking. The maximum absorption peak of 4TO-T-4F in solid film is 867 nm and the absorption edge extends to 951 nm, corresponding to a low optical bandgap of 1.30 eV. The maximum absorption peak and absorption edge of 4TO-Se-4F are located at 895 and 973 nm, respectively, corresponding to a bandgap of 1.27 eV (Fig. 1b). Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to measure the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the two NFAs using solid film in their acetonitrile solution (Fig. S2b, ESI†). The HOMO/LUMO energy levels for 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F were estimated to be −5.30/−3.85 eV and −5.29/−3.85 eV, respectively, which were calculated from the onset oxidation potentials and the onset reduction potentials of the corresponding materials. The detailed data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).

Polymer donor PTB7-Th exhibits strong absorption in the range of 550–750 nm, which is complementary with the absorption of acceptor materials, 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F (Fig. 1b). The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PTB7-Th are −5.20/−3.59 eV, which match well with our 4TO-based acceptors (Fig. 1c).44 Thus, we used PTB7-Th as the donor, and 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F as acceptors to fabricate the photovoltaic devices with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:acceptor/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 3a). The optimization of the devices based on processing parameters such as the donor/acceptor weight ratios, solvent, spin coating rates, post treatment, and additives is summarized in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). The optimized photovoltaic parameters are outlined in Table 1 and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3b. With a donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio of 1:1.5, the PTB7-Th:4TO-T-4F based device exhibits a PCE of 6.92%, coupled with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.73 V, a JSC of 16.55 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 57.5%. The photovoltaic device using 4TO-Se-4F as the acceptor exhibits a PCE of 5.62%, combined with a VOC of 0.73 V, a JSC of 13.41 mA cm−2 and a FF of 57.74%. The low JSC and FF may be ascribed to the poor morphology of the thin films, as discussed below. With 0.5% (v/v) CN as the additive and thermal annealing at 110 °C for 5 min, the JSC of the PTB7-Th:4TO-T-4F based device was increased to 20.4 mA cm−2, combined with a VOC of 0.75 V, an FF of 58.05%, and a high PCE of 8.87%. For the PTB7-Th:4TO-Se-4F based device, with 0.7% CN as the additive, the JSC was increased to 19.13 mA cm−2, with a VOC of 0.70 V, an FF of 55.48% and an increased PCE of 7.4% (Table 1). In comparison with 4TO-Se-4F, 4TO-T-4F based devices exhibited higher JSC, VOC and FF, which may be attributed to the reduced charge carrier recombination and more appropriate phase separation as discussed below. We believe that the efficiency could be further improved by donor material screening and modifying the NFAs through side chain engineering, which is currently underway in our lab.

As shown in Table 1, in terms of the general formula Eloss = Eoptg − eEvoc, 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F based devices exhibit Eloss of 0.57 and 0.55 eV, respectively, which are relatively small among the near-infrared absorption acceptor based photovoltaic devices.40,41 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of optimized devices based on 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F are shown in Fig. 3c; both device types exhibit broad photo-to-current response up to 1000 nm, which is in accordance with the UV-vis absorption spectra. The JSC values calculated from the integral of the EQE curves over the AM 1.5G solar spectrum for 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F based devices were 20.4 and 18.2 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in line with JSC values measured from J–V with an error less than 5%.
Photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves (Fig. 3d) were used to investigate and compare the efficiency of exciton dissociation and charge collection dynamics for the two NFA based devices. Jph is calculated from the formula Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the current density under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination and in the dark. Veff is calculated from the formula Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when JL = JD and V is the applied voltage. If Jph tends to be saturated (Jsat), there would be minimal charge recombination and most of the charge carriers could be collected by the top and bottom electrodes. The ratio of Jph/Jsat represents the probability of charge transport and collection in the device.58,59 As shown in Fig. 3d, under the short circuit condition, the ratio of Jph/Jsat for the 4TO-T-4F based device was 0.90, higher than that of the 4TO-Se-4F based device (0.85). Under the maximal power output conditions, Jph/Jsat for 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F-based devices are calculated to be 0.68 and 0.64, respectively. The higher Jph/Jsat values in different conditions indicate that 4TO-T-4F-based devices exhibit more efficient charge transport and collection in comparison with that of 4TO-Se-4F based devices.

SC
versus light intensity (Plight) curves (Fig. 3e) were also measured to understand the charge recombination behavior for NFA based devices according to the formula JSC ∝ Pαlight, where α is related to the charge recombination. In general, all charges could be swept out and collected by the electrode prior to recombination when α = 1.60 The α values of 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F based devices were 0.974 and 0.970, respectively, indicating that both device types exhibit low bimolecular recombination. To further investigate the trap-assisted recombination losses, we treat VOC as a function of Plight on a seminatural logarithmic scale. Typically, if devices exhibit trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall recombination, there would be a deviation of the slope from unity kT/q61 (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the thermodynamic temperature, and q is the elementary charge). As shown in Fig. 3f, the 4TO-T-4F based device exhibits a slope of 1.31kT/q, and the 4TO-Se-4F based device exhibits a slope of 1.39kT/q. The smaller slope for the 4TO-T-4F based device indicates lower trap-assisted recombination losses, resulting in higher VOC, which is consistent with the J–V results. The space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement was used to measure the charge mobility of the 4TO-based acceptors and PTB7-Th blend films, and the corresponding data are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). With CN as the additive, both hole and electron mobilities were increased for 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F based blend films. The hole and electron mobilities for PTB7-Th:4TO-T-4F blend films are 1.52 × 10−4 and 4.02 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe of 3.8. The hole and electron mobilities for PTB7-Th:4TO-Se-4F blend films are 1.26 × 10−4 and 2.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe of 6.3. In comparison with the 4TO-Se-4F based blend film, the 4TO-T-4F based blend film exhibits higher and more balanced electron and hole mobility, resulting in reduced charge carrier recombination loss, which is consistent with its relatively high device performance.
In order to understand the effects of additive on device performance, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to further investigate the morphologies of the NFA-based photoactive layers (Fig. 4 and Fig. S5, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4a–d, the as-cast blend films were smooth and uniform with relatively small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness. With CN as the additive, more obvious fiber-like nanostructures were observed for the two blend films, especially for 4TO-T-4F based films. As shown in Fig. 4e–h, TEM images of the two blend films exhibit nanoscale phase separation, indicating that the two acceptors mixed well with the donor. With CN as the additive, PTB7-Th:4TO-T-4F blend films exhibit more obvious interpenetrating network nanostructures, which is beneficial for effective exciton dissociation and charge transport. These morphological features are consistent with the better photovoltaic performance of the 4TO-T-4F based device. To have a deep insight into the molecular stacking and crystalline texture of pristine NFA and blend films, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAX) measurements were performed and are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The pristine films of the two NFAs exhibited a π–π stacking diffraction peak (010) along the out-of-plane direction, suggesting face-on orientation for the two NFAs. By blending with the polymer donor PTB7-Th and using CN as the additive, the π–π stacking in the out-of-plane direction became stronger, especially for the PTB7-Th:4TO-T-4F blend film, indicating its enhanced molecular packing, which is consistent with its relatively high charge mobility discussed above.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized two ultra-narrow band gap NFAs, namely, 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F, with high planarity via intramolecular O⋯S or O⋯Se noncovalent interactions. Because of the large electron-donating ability of the 4TO central core and extended effective conjugation length, 4TO-T-4F and 4TO-Se-4F exhibit a low bandgap of ∼1.30 and ∼1.27 eV, respectively. These NFAs exhibit appropriate energy levels and complementary absorption with polymer donor PTB7-Th. The optimized devices show a high PCE of 8.87% for 4TO-T-4F and 7.4% for 4TO-Se-4F based devices, with relatively low Eloss of 0.55 and 0.57 eV, respectively. The higher PCE for the 4TO-T-4F based device was ascribed to its appropriate phase separation morphology, relatively high and more balanced electron and hole mobility, and low charge carrier recombination loss. This work provides a successful strategy toward developing ultra-narrow bandgap NFAs for OSCs with low energy loss.
