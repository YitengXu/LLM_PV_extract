    , Accepted 7th June 2016First published on 10th June 2016AbstractIn a photophysical study, two diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based sensitizers functionalized with 4-thiophenecarboxylic acid as an anchoring group and a bromo (DPPBr) or dicyanovinyl (DPPCN2) group, and a dyad consisting of a DPP unit linked to a naphthalenediimide group (DPP–NDI), were investigated both in solution and grafted on mesoporous NiO films. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements indicate that ultrafast hole injection occurred predominantly on a timescale of ∼200 fs, whereas the subsequent charge recombination occurred on a surprisingly wide range of timescales, from tens of ps to tens of μs; this kinetic heterogeneity is much greater than is typically observed for dye-sensitized TiO2 or ZnO. Also, in contrast to what is typically observed for dye-sensitized TiO2, there was no significant dependence on the excitation power of the recombination kinetics, which can be explained by the hole density being comparatively higher near the valence band of NiO before excitation. The additional acceptor group in DPP–NDI provided a rapid electron shift and stabilized charge separation up to the μs timescale. This enabled efficient (∼95%) regeneration of NDI by a CoIII(dtb)3 electrolyte (dtb = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine), according to transient absorption measurements. The regeneration of DPPBr and DPPCN2 by CoIII(dtb)3 was instead inefficient, as most recombination for these dyes occurred on the sub-ns timescale. The transient spectroscopy data thus corroborated the trend of the published photovoltaic properties of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on these dyes on mesoporous NiO, and show the potential of a design strategy with a secondary acceptor bound to the dye. The study identifies rapid initial recombination between the dye and NiO as the main obstacle to obtaining high efficiencies in NiO-based DSSCs; these recombination components may be overlooked when studies are conducted using only methods with ns resolution or slower.
Introduction
The design of photosensitizers for p-type semiconductor (p-SC)-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has drawn attention1–14 owing to their possible applications in photocatalysis15–18 and because they are indispensable for the development of tandem dye-sensitized solar cells.19–24 The photosensitizer is one of the crucial components that control the overall performance of a solar cell. The absorption of light causes the formation of an excited state, which subsequently injects a hole into nanoporous NiO film (or another p-SC). A redox mediator such as triiodide or a cobalt25,26 or iron27 complex regenerates the dye and delivers electrons to the counter electrode in order to complete the photovoltaic circuit. However, rapid charge recombination between the injected holes and the reduced sensitizer is much faster in p-DSSCs than in conventional DSSCs based on an n-SC such as TiO2, and occurs in most cases on a timescale of less than 1 ns.13,14 Therefore, in order to obtain highly efficient systems, the dynamic processes of charge recombination are the most critical factors to improve: in particular, the competition between dye regeneration and recombination of the reduced dye with the holes in NiO. An important strategy for overcoming the usual fast charge recombination is the development of dye-acceptor dyads to rapidly localize the ejected electrons far away from the NiO surface.22,28,29 Recently, we found that simple diketopyrrolopyrrole-based dyes (DPPBr and DPPCN2) and a “D–A” dyad (DPP–NDI) are promising sensitizers for p-DSSCs and can be used with both iodide and cobalt electrolytes (Chart 1).30 The photovoltaic performances show that the photocurrent increased on the replacement of the bromo group by better acceptor groups, a thiophene–dicyanovinylene group or a secondary electron acceptor (NDI), in the presence of an iodide/triiodide electrolyte. When a CoII/III(dtb)3(PF6)2/3 electrolyte (see the structure in Fig. S1, ESI†) was used with the DPP–NDI dyad, both the photovoltage and photocurrent were greatly improved and the VOC was twice as high (365 mV vs. 155 mV). Prompted by these interesting photovoltaic performances, we decided to investigate the detailed mechanism of charge transfer in these three dyes. Here, we report a photophysical study of these diketopyrrolopyrrole-based sensitizers using time-resolved techniques, both in solution and chemisorbed on NiO films. An understanding of all the excited singlet states and triplet states was acquired to help us obtain a clear picture of the charge transfer mechanisms involving the photoexcited dyes adsorbed on the mesoporous NiO films. Femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, respectively, shed some light on the ultrafast (ps timescale) and slow (ns–μs timescale) charge transfer processes. The obtained results demonstrated that reduced DPP–NDI˙− is regenerated with greater than 80% efficiency by the CoIII complex, whereas the other two dyes (DPPBr and DPPCN2) are regenerated to a much smaller extent. This explains the improvement in photovoltaic performance on binding the NDI acceptor to DPP and using the CoII/III electrolyte.30

Experimental section
General
The preparation of the dyes DPPBr, DPPCN2 and DPP–NDI was reported in a previous study.30 The solvents employed for this study (dichloromethane (Aldrich, UV spectroscopy grade), ethanol (Aldrich, 99.5% spectroscopy grade), and propylene carbonate (Aldrich, 99% ACS reagent grade)) were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. The preparation of CoII/III(dtb)3 (dtb = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine) used as a redox mediator was published elsewhere.30
For spectroscopic measurements on solution-phase samples, a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm was used (1 mm for the fs experiments), unless otherwise noted. Sensitized NiO samples were prepared as described below.
Spectroelectrochemical characterization
Spectroelectrochemistry was performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a platinum mesh working electrode, a glassy carbon counter electrode and a Ag/AgNO3 (10 mM/MeCN) as reference electrode. The electrochemical cell was set up in a quartz cuvette with an optical pathway of 1 mm. The samples were dissolved in a 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6/DCM electrolyte solution. The counter electrode was kept separate from the main solution by a salt bridge with a glass frit tip. The potential was applied with an Autolab PGSTAT302 potentiostat/galvanostat, whereas the spectra were acquired with an Agilent 8453 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Experiments were carried out in a glove box (MBraun) maintained at <0.1 ppm O2.
NiO film preparation
The preparation and assembly of sandwich solar cells followed previously described methods.31 First, 3 g NiCl2 anhydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 g F108 polymer (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in a mixture of 9 g deionized water and 18 g 99.5% ethanol. The resulting green viscous solution was sonicated overnight. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min to sediment out undissolved NiCl2 and amorphous NiO. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected as three separate batches for use as a doctor-blading paste. Mesoporous NiO electrodes were prepared by spreading the doctor-blading paste onto conducting F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass masked with adhesive tape and sintered in a furnace at 450 °C for 30 minutes.
Sensitization of NiO film for spectroscopic characterization
The sensitizing solutions were ∼0.05 mM solutions (3:1 dichloromethane:ethanol) of the desired sensitizer. NiO films supported on microscope slides were heated to 50 °C overnight and placed into the sensitizing solutions while warm. The films were allowed to soak in the sensitizing solutions for 16 hours in a dark cupboard. Immediately prior to measurements, the films were removed from the sensitizing solutions and rinsed with dichloromethane. After drying the film in a stream of nitrogen, a drop of propylene carbonate (PC) solvent was placed onto the film and a clean piece of glass slide placed on top to create a sandwich cell configuration. Capillary forces enabled the cover glass to adhere to the glass substrate supporting the sensitized film. Typical optical densities of the sensitizers on NiO were 0.3–0.6.
Steady-state absorption and fluorescence
Steady-state absorbance spectra were collected with a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer.
Emission spectra were collected with a FluoroLog emission spectrometer. Solution-phase samples were analyzed in quartz cuvettes with the desired solvent. The optical densities of the samples for emission spectroscopy were of the order of 0.1, whereas those for the solution phase and ultrafast measurements of NiO films were between 0.3 and 0.6.
Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)
A detailed description of the experimental setup has been given recently.32 In brief, the sample was excited with a picosecond diode laser (Edinburgh Instruments, EPL470) at 470 nm (pulses of 77.1 ps). The laser pulse energy was ca. 15 pJ and was attenuated (often by more than 1 order of magnitude) to the desired count rate of 1% or less of the excitation frequency.
Decay curves obtained by single-photon counting were analyzed by iterative reconvolution using an exponential decay model with 1 or 2 components in the SpectraSolve program. The instrument response function (IRF: 60 ps) was free to move relative to the decay during analysis.
Nanosecond transient absorption spectrometer
The sample was excited by a Q-switched YAG laser/MOPO combination (Spectra Physics) that delivered pulses of ca. 10 ns at a repetition frequency of 10 Hz. The pulses were attenuated to 1–10 mJ per pulse over ca. 0.3 cm2. The spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) was coupled to a probe light from a pulsed Xe lamp (long-pass filtered at 380 nm) at a 90° angle to the laser excitation, whereas the sample was placed at 45° with respect to both beams for the sensitized NiO films or in 1 cm cuvettes for the solution-phase samples. Kinetic traces were recorded using a PMT and a digital oscilloscope. Transient spectra were detected with a CCD (ANDOR).
Ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption spectrometer
Femtosecond time-resolved measurements were performed by means of transient absorption. For a detailed description, see Petersson et al.33 In brief, the output from a Coherent Legend Ti: sapphire amplifier (1 kHz, λ = 800 nm, fwhm 100 fs) was split into a pump part and a probe part. The desired pump wavelengths were obtained with a TOPAS, and with neutral-density filters the energy of each pulse was kept between 150 and 500 nJ over ca. 3 mm2. A white-light continuum probe was obtained by focusing part of the 800 nm light on a moving CaF2 plate. Polarization of the pump was set at the magic angle of 54.7° relative to the probe. The instrumental response time depended on the pump and probe wavelengths, but was typically about 150 fs. The sample was moved vertically to avoid photodegradation. Several consecutive scans of the optical delay line were measured for each sample. There was no difference in the results between the first and last scan, which showed that sample degradation was negligible.
Data analysis was carried out in MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc.), and a robust trust-region reflective Newton nonlinear least-squares method was used for fitting time traces. Traces (ΔA vs. t) were fitted to a sum of exponentials convolved with a Gaussian-shaped response. Also included in the fits was an artifact signal, which was due to cross-phase modulation during overlap of the pump and probe. All spectra were corrected for chirp in the white-light probe. Time zero was set at the maximum pump–probe temporal overlap. The region around the pump wavelength was removed due to scattering of the pump light (500–550 nm).
Results and discussion
Absorption and fluorescence measurements
The spectral features of DPPBr, DPPCN2 and DPP–NDI dyes in solution and on NiO films were first investigated by performing steady-state absorption and fluorescence measurements. Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of the DPP dyes on NiO/FTO films. The steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra of the DPP dyes recorded in dichloromethane (DCM) have been published in a previous paper (Fig. S2, ESI†).30 Time-resolved emission (TCSPC) decays for all three dyes were fitted with a double exponential function (Fig. S3, ESI†), which shows that the fluorescence lifetimes decreased with the increasing electron-withdrawing ability of the DPP substituent, from DPPBr (τ = 9.65 ns, 89%) to DPPCN2 with a conjugated acceptor group (τ = 0.78 ns, 88%) and DPP–NDI with a non-conjugated, separate secondary electron acceptor (NDI) (τ = 260 ps, 96%).

Fig. 1 shows a broadening of the absorption spectra of DPP-sensitized NiO films in the visible region (400–650 nm) compared with those in solution (Fig. S2, ESI†), which is attributed to electronic coupling of the dye with the semiconductor surface and probably the formation of aggregates upon immobilization on the NiO surface. Broadening of dye absorption spectra on a metal oxide has previously been observed for many dyes on NiO and TiO2.1,34–36 All three photocathodes were found to be photoluminescent. Most dyes inject holes in ∼200 fs (see below); therefore, this emission mainly arises from the fraction of dyes that for some unknown reasons inject slowly. Similar heterogeneous behavior is typically observed for dye-sensitized TiO2.37 Binding to NiO induces a red shift of 50 nm in the emission maximum (the peak shifts from 580 nm in DCM to 630 nm on NiO). NiO/DPP–NDI exhibits a similar red shift. This is assignable to the aggregation of molecular dyes on the surface of NiO. In addition, the maximum emission peak of DPPBr shifts from 680 nm in DCM to 665 nm after binding to the NiO film. The emission band of adsorbed DPPCN2 is thinner than in the solution phase in DCM (Fig. S2, ESI†): this is attributed to excited-state twisting (see below), which is hindered by adsorption on the NiO surface.
Determination of anion spectra of the DPP dyes
The spectra of the reduced DPP dyes were recorded for interpretation of the transient experiments below. The irreversibility of the reduction of DPP under electrochemical conditions precluded spectroelectrochemical determination of the absorption spectrum of the radical anion. Instead, we used the nanosecond laser flash-quench method in the presence of an external electron donor, triethylamine (TEA) or CoII(dtb)3. The difference spectra of DPPBr and DPPCN2 recorded with the addition of TEA solution in Ar-saturated DCM (Fig. S4a, ESI†) display a clear difference from those of the excited states of the dye in DCM (see below). In addition to ground-state bleaching, there is a positive absorption band at ∼430 nm and another broad band at >550 nm. As the signal was very weak, experiments with CoII as an electron donor were used to confirm this radical anion spectrum, with similar and higher intensities (Fig. S4b, ESI†).
The first reduction of DPP–NDI is localized on the NDI unit and should be electrochemically reversible.30 Therefore, the difference absorption spectrum of reduced DPP–NDI in DCM solution was recorded by using spectroelectrochemistry. DPP–NDI was reduced by applying a bias at −1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl reference, and reduced NDI exhibits a broad absorption in the visible region with a distinct peak at 475 nm and a weak and broad absorption peak at 610 nm (Fig. 2). This spectral feature is in good agreement with the reported absorption of NDI− in the literature38 and confirms that the first reduction of DPP–NDI is on the NDI group.

Transient absorption in solution
The three dyes were then investigated in solution by femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to determine the spectra of their excited singlet and triplet states for interpretation of the spectra recorded on the NiO surface. The femtosecond transient absorption spectra of DPPBr in DCM after excitation in the middle of the lowest S0–S1 absorption band are shown in Fig. 3a. The initially formed singlet excited state of DPPBr exhibits an absorption peak around 400 nm and an absorption band at >650 nm, in addition to ground-state bleaching (GSB) around 475 nm. The stimulated emission displays a strong dynamic Stokes shift with a time constant of ca. 1.5 ps, which is mainly caused by solvent relaxation, and causes the initial broad and negative signal from 450 to 650 nm to separate into distinct bleached and stimulated emission bands, respectively. Following this dynamic, the emission principally decays with a lifetime of >1.2 ns, which is in agreement with the TCSPC results. Kinetic traces at significant wavelengths for DPPBr and DPPCN2 are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), and for DPP–NDI in Fig. 4. The results from a global fit for the three time constants are given in Table 1. For DPPBr, the contribution of the intermediate component (97 ps) is small at most wavelengths.

Transient absorption spectra on the nano- and microsecond timescales after excitation with a 10 ns laser flash are shown in Fig. 5a for the DPPBr dye on a timescale when the singlet excited state has already decayed. The transient spectrum is also different from the spectrum of the singlet excited state; most notable is the absence of emissions (see footnote‡), the absorption band that peaks at 560 nm and the absorption band around 380 nm. The transient spectra decay with τ ∼ 10.8 μs in Ar-purged DCM, whereas they are strongly quenched in 320 ns in the air-saturated solvent (Fig. 5b). All these features are consistent with a triplet excited state, which is formed by intersystem crossing from the singlet excited state.

In the case of DPPCN2 (Fig. 3b), the fs spectra exhibit a strong dynamic Stokes shift in the stimulated emission, with an initial change from 640 nm to 670 nm on a timescale of a few ps. However, the shift continues until most of the transient signal has decayed, up to 2 ns, which also explains the broad fluorescence spectrum in solution (Fig. S2, ESI†). This is much too long a period for solvent dynamics, and we tentatively ascribe this to twisting of the dicyanovinyl group in the excited state, similarly to other conjugated cyanovinyl dyes.39 Most of the ground-state bleaching recovers with a time constant of 785 ps, which is in excellent agreement with the TCSPC results (780 ps). The nanosecond transient absorption spectra display an absorption beyond 550 nm with a peak at ∼685 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†), with lifetimes of 2.9 μs (Ar) and 280 ns (air), which was assigned to the triplet excited state of DPPCN2.
Finally, for DPP–NDI the fs transient spectra are initially very similar to those for DPP, but the decay of the signal is faster (Table 1). After ca. 1 ns a clear peak at 475 nm is seen within the ground-state bleaching, which can be attributed to the formation of NDI˙−. Nevertheless, most of the spectrum has the same appearance as that of the excited state and principally decays with τCS = 120 ps. The shorter lifetime compared with that of DPPBr can be ascribed to intramolecular electron transfer to the NDI unit, which forms a DPP˙+–NDI˙− state. However, the subsequent charge recombination is faster (τCR = 10 ps), which is seen in particular as a rising component at 480 nm (Fig. 3c). It is well known for consecutive reactions where the second step is faster than the first that the signal of the intermediate (counter-intuitively) increases with the time constant of recombination and decays with that of charge separation (see any textbook on chemical kinetics). On the ns timescale a spectrum attributable to the DPP-centered triplet is again observed (Fig. S6, ESI†), but with lower amplitude than for DPPBr because of rapid charge separation and recombination to the ground state. Its lifetime in Ar- and air-saturated solutions was similar to that of DPPCN2.
Transient absorption of dye-sensitized NiO films
Dye-sensitized NiO films for transient absorption spectroscopy were coated by propylene carbonate and covered with thin glass slides. The transient absorption spectra (chirp-corrected) and selected time traces after excitation for ∼120 fs around 525 nm at ∼500 nJ per pulse are shown in Fig. 6–8.

The initial transient absorption spectra of both NiO/DPPBr (Fig. 6a) and NiO/DPPCN2 (Fig. 7a) exhibit positive absorbance at ∼440 nm and >600 nm, ground-state bleaching around 520 nm and stimulated emission around 600 nm, which indicates the singlet excited dye. The signals rapidly decay, in particular the stimulated emission, which leads to a blue shift in the isosbestic point to ∼560 nm. This is attributed to the formation of DPP˙− by the injection of holes from 1*DPP to NiO with a time constant of 200–400 fs with slower injection components around 1–15 ps, which all lead to the formation of the charge separation state NiO+/DPP˙− (Table 2). The resulting spectrum is similar to the reference spectrum for DPP˙− obtained with TEA as an electron donor in solution (Fig. S4, ESI†). This spectrum decays almost completely within 2 ns, as mostly represented by the slow component in Table 2 (τ = 75 ps and 94 ps, respectively). This is assigned to charge recombination of the DPP˙− dye anion with holes in NiO.

In the case of NiO/DPP–NDI (Fig. 8a), the initial transient absorption spectra are very similar to those for NiO/DPPBr, again displaying the injection of holes from 1*DPP to NiO on a timescale of ∼200 fs, with a slower component represented by a lifetime of ∼2 ps. However, the slower injection occurs on a timescale that overlaps with further electron transfer from DPP˙− to the NDI acceptor, which is represented by the 2 ps and 13 ps components (Table 2). The isosbestic point around 470 nm that is seen for the other dyes is lost, and the 475–500 nm region already displays a positive signal after 1–20 ps (Fig. 8). As electrons shift from DPP˙− to the NDI unit, the transient absorption peak at 440 nm shifts to 480 nm and the absorbance in the red region changes to form a peak at 610 nm, which is in good agreement with the published absorption and spectroelectrochemistry results for reduced NDI˙− (Fig. 2). In an important contrast to the fs spectra for the other two dyes on NiO for NiO/DPP–NDI is that a much larger signal remains after a time delay of 2 ns. As we do not know the relative extinction coefficients of the DPP˙− and NDI˙− radicals, we cannot deduce the yield of NDI˙−. However, the signal around 480 nm increases until ca. 20 ps and then remains constant until at least 2 ns (Fig. 8b), which indicates that there is no recombination of NDI˙− and NiO holes on a timescale of <2 ns, and all possible recombination losses would be due to DPP˙− and NiO holes before electron transfer to the NDI unit.
A global fit with a sum of five exponentials (of which one had an infinite lifetime) was applied to the data in Fig. 6–8: see the decay-associated spectra (DAS) and recalculated species-associated spectra (SAS) in Fig. S7–S9 (ESI†). As we know, multi-exponential fitting of data for this type of system with heterogeneous kinetics is an approximation for illustrating the timescales of a process rather than giving precise numbers. DAS and SAS from global analysis of data can aid in interpreting the processes of electron transfer and the shape of transient absorbance curves for each species. The DAS and SAS for τ1 ∼ 200–400 fs are noisy due to early-time artifacts; nevertheless, the decay of the stimulated emission is obvious, which supports our assignment to the injection of holes. The relatively slow τ4 component of NiO/DPPBr and NiO/DPPCN2 displays instead clear signatures of DPP˙− recombination (cf. Fig. S4, ESI†). The SAS and DAS for the intermediate-timescale τ2 and τ3 components can be described as a mixture of those for τ1 and τ4 in different proportions and are assigned to slow injection (τ = 1–20 ps) in parallel with fast recombination components; injection and recombination are frequently found to overlap in time in NiO/dye systems, which reflects their heterogeneous kinetics.4,55 For the faster component at τ2 ≈ 1–2 ps, the injection of holes is dominant, as is also clear from the continued increase in the trace in the region of the stimulated emission (575 nm and 610 nm for DPPBr and DPPCN2, respectively, see Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†) until about 20 ps. For NiO/DPP–NDI instead (Fig. S9, ESI†), the slower components are consistent with the presence of long-lived NDI˙−, as discussed above.
In a summary of the results for ultrafast transient absorption, we have shown that all the dyes on NiO provide ultrafast injection of holes (τ = 200–400 fs) followed by slower ps components. Ultrafast charge recombination of DPP˙− with NiO holes was also found, predominantly on the timescale of ∼100 ps but with a small fraction (<5%) on the timescale of >1 ns. The secondary charge acceptor in DPP–NDI leads to the formation of DPP–NDI˙−, which strongly retards the charge recombination process. The long-lived signal from NDI˙− (>1 ns) will be discussed in detail in connection with the results for ns transient absorption below.
Slow recombination detected by nanosecond transient absorption
The ns transient absorption spectra after 100 ns for all the dyes on NiO (in 0.1 M LiClO4, propylene carbonate) are shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. S13 (ESI†) (laser power: 10 mJ per pulse). The spectral shapes are all in agreement with both the results for fs transient absorption and the reduced state of the dyes in solution, see above. The absorption peaks at 475 nm and 610 nm for NiO/DPP–NDI represent the radical anion of NDI−, whereas the peaks around 560 nm, 690 nm and 730 nm for the other two samples can be attributed to the absorption of DPP˙−. Thus, a significant fraction of the reduced dye remains on the timescale of 100 ns.

Dependence on pump power. 
The fs results above show that only a small fraction of the signal (∼1%) remains after a time delay of 2 ns for NiO/DPPBr and NiO/DPPCN2. Nevertheless, as was presented above, a significant signal attributable to DPP˙− was observed in the ns measurements (see also Fig. 9, Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†). This can be attributed to the pump power density used in the ns experiments (a few mJ per pulse over a spot size of ∼0.5 cm2) being higher than in the fs experiments (a few hundred nJ per pulse over a spot size of ∼0.001 cm2). To investigate whether this was a simple linear effect of exciting more of the sample in the ns experiments, or if non-linear effects were important, the experiments were repeated at different pump powers. Fig. 9 shows the fs and ns dependence on pump power for NiO/DPPBr. Both sets of experiments gave a linear relationship of ΔAbs. vs. laser power, and the traces overlapped well when normalized at the initial signal (Fig. S12, ESI†). This suggests that charge recombination was not affected by the pump power and that the fraction of slow recombination was essentially independent of the laser power; obviously, however, at low power densities the smaller, slower parts of the signal become difficult to distinguish from noise. Similar results for the dependence on pump power were also found for NiO/DPPCN2 and NiO/DPP–NDI (Fig. S10, ESI†). Wood et al. also reported that the charge recombination lifetimes of two organic dyes on NiO did not change significantly with the laser pump power, although the dependence of the TA amplitudes was not reported.8b

The absence of a dependence on power of charge recombination is an important result. Firstly, the linear power dependence also suggests that the results obtained here are relevant under conditions of solar irradiation and are thus useful for analyzing photovoltaic data from complete cells. Secondly, it means that the fraction of slow recombination observed for NiO/DPPBr and NiO/DPPCN2 is not an artifact, but that recombination occurs over a surprisingly wide range of timescales in the present systems, from a few ps to at least tens of μs. D'Amario et al. recently analyzed the recombination of a NiO/Ru-dye system on a timescale of 10 ns−1 s with a stretched exponential (KWW) function, resulting in β values of 0.10–0.15,40 which is already much less than for typical TiO2/dye systems (0.25–0.4);41–44i.e. recombination in the NiO/Ru-dye system occurs over a much wider distribution of timescales. The present data suggest at least an equally broad distribution of recombination timescales, but starting on the low-ps timescale. Thirdly, the independence of recombination from the excitation power is very different from what is known of TiO2/dye systems, where the recombination rate increases drastically with higher excitation powers.45 D'Amario et al.40 suggested that this difference is because NiO already has a high density of holes in the valence band edge region before excitation, whereas the electron trap density in TiO2 is comparatively low.


Prolonged charge separation in DPP–NDI. 
The majority of charge recombination in NiO/DPPBr and NiO/DPPCN2 occurs with a lifetime of 65 ps and 150 ps, respectively, as shown by the fs experiments above. The decay of the signal that remains on the ns–μs timescale (Fig. 9 and Fig. S10, ESI†) can be fitted by a biexponential function with τ1 = 1.5–2 μs and τ2 = 25–30 μs, with roughly equal amplitudes (Table 3). Charge recombination of the signal from NDI˙− in NiO/DPP–NDI is remarkably slow in comparison: no significant decay is observed up to 2 ns in the fs experiments, and the ns experiments show significant decay only from 1 μs to 1 ms (Fig. 10). A biexponential fit to the data in Fig. 10 resulted in values of τ1 = 49 μs (37% amplitude) and τ2 = 260 μs (63%). The weighted average of logarithmic lifetimes (eqn (1)) then gives 〈τ〉 = 140 μs. In contrast, for DPPBr and DPPCN2 〈τ〉 is <500 ps, as the μs components contribute less than 10% of the total decay. Thus, the secondary acceptor unit NDI results in an increase in average lifetime by five orders of magnitude. This is in line with previous reports for a PMI–NDI dyad,22,46 but here the resulting lifetime is another order of magnitude longer. The excess electron on the DPP dye is moved 15–20 Å away from the NiO linker group by electron transfer to the NDI unit (as judged from the centers of the distributions of the LUMO in DPPBr and DPP–NDI30). If recombination occurs mainly by through-bond electron transfer, this distance and the attenuation factor of β ≈ 0.5 Å−1 are sufficient to rationalize the increase in lifetime.47,48

 Fig. 10  Nanosecond transient absorption spectra (a) and kinetic traces (b) of the recombination and regeneration of NiO/DPP–NDI in the presence of LiClO4 and CoII/III after excitation at 532 nm. (The traces were monitored at 480 nm with a laser power of around 10 mJ per pulse.) 
Note that we found no evidence for the distinct dual recombination suggested by d'Amario et al. for the recombination of a Ru(II)–polypyridine–naphthalenemonoimide dye on NiO.40 They reported a fast, exponential recombination with τ ≈ 15 ns, followed by a much slower recombination represented by a stretched exponential decay. The relative amplitudes of these kinetic phases varied with the applied bias. The authors therefore proposed that the rapid recombination occurred in parallel with a hole relaxation mechanism that slowed down recombination. The traces in Fig. 9 and Fig. S10 (ESI†) for the present DPP dyes, however, show no sign of recombination on a timescale of ∼15 ns. One explanation for the differences compared with ref. 40 could be that the present systems do not exhibit recombination on the right timescale for the proposed relaxation effect to be observed: for DPPBr and DPPCN2 almost all recombination occurred within 1 ns, whereas for DPP–NDI almost no recombination occurred before 1 μs.

Regeneration and Interpretation of photovoltaic properties
A CoII/III(dtb)3(PF6)2/3 (dtb = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine) electrolyte was added to investigate the regeneration efficiency for NiO-based dye-sensitized solar cells. This electrolyte has given comparatively good results in NiO-based DSSCs, provided the dye-NiO charge recombination is slow enough.22,30 The transient absorption data for NiO/DPP–NDI (Fig. 10) show much faster decay of the signal from NDI˙− than in a plain LiClO4 electrolyte. The effect on the μs decay of the signal from DPP˙− in NiO/DPPBr and NiO/DPPCN2 is, in contrast, very small (Fig. S13, ESI†).
To approach a quantitative comparison of the data for the different dyes and with and without CoII/III, we used the weighted average of logarithmic lifetimes from a biexponential fit to the data (eqn (1)):49 log(〈τ〉) = ∑Ailog(τi)(1)where Ai is the fractional amplitude for each component. The more common definition of the average lifetime, 〈τ〉 = ∑Aiτi, overemphasizes components with longer lifetimes and has the related, unsatisfactory problem that 〈τ〉 ≠ 〈k〉−1. These two problems are solved by the definition in eqn (1), which gives equal weight to each decadic timescale just like plots of data on logarithmic timescales do. We emphasize again, however, as we did in connection with the fs data above, that a fit based on a sum of exponentials for these heterogeneous systems is an approximation for describing the timescales of a process rather than giving precise numbers. Although there is most probably an underlying exponentiality in the recombination process, each lifetime that is derived will not describe a discrete exponential process.
Fits using the KWW function (stretched exponential, eqn (2)),45,50–52 which is commonly used in DSSC research, gave worse fits to our data. Abs(t) = Abs(t0)exp(−(t/τ)β)(2) Also, the regeneration reaction is not expected to follow a stretched exponential function, and the comparison of average KWW lifetimes with and without electrolytes can therefore be problematic. Moreover, the average KWW lifetime is calculated using the ill-behaved Γ function. For cases where β < 0.3, as has been reported for NiO systems,40 the average lifetimes can be quite long, orders of magnitude longer than the time point at which the original data no longer show a detectable signal. In such a case, the average lifetime that is calculated has no physical relevance. For these reasons, we prefer not to use the KWW function here.
The ns–μs kinetic traces for the decay of DPP˙− and NDI˙− with and without the CoII/III electrolyte (Fig. 10 and Fig. S13, ESI†) were fitted using a biexponential function; the results are tabulated in Table 3. The largest effect of CoII/III is for NiO/DPP–NDI, where 〈τ〉 decreases from 140 μs (see above) to 5.6 μs. Control experiments suggested that the addition of CoII/III does not change the recombination kinetics: the addition of CoII alone has no effect, and the addition of CoIII alone has the same effect as adding both CoII and CoIII (Fig. S14, ESI†).53 Thus, we expect that the faster decay kinetics is entirely due to the regeneration of the dye by CoIII, which suggests a regeneration efficiency of ≈95% for DPP–NDI. In contrast, the generation of the μs fractions of DPPBr and DPPCN2 has an efficiency of only ≈65% and ≈35%, respectively. However, the greatest loss for these dyes lies in the fact that the majority of DPP recombines on the timescale of 100 ps.
These dyes have been tested in NiO-based DSSCs with I3−/I− as the electrolyte, and the maximum IPCE values were 25% for DPP–NDI, 22% for DPPCN2 and 8% for DPPBr.30 This trend agrees with that in the charge separation lifetimes observed here, although the small difference between DPP–NDI and DPPCN2 is surprising. However, I3−/I− is a non-trivial electrolyte that may regenerate dyes even on the low-ps timescale at both photoanodes52,54 and photocathodes, owing to static pre-association of the triiodide anion with the dyes.55 CoII/III, on the other hand, is slower, but gives a much higher photovoltage. Indeed, the greatest photovoltaic efficiency was obtained with DPP–NDI and the CoII/III redox couple.30 The IPCE still reached 20%, in spite of a more sluggish redox couple. In the present study we see that the regeneration of DPP–NDI from DPP–NDI˙− is very efficient. Most of the losses can then be expected to occur on the timescale of ∼10 ps, in the step in which recombination of DPP˙−–NDI competes with charge transfer to form the long-lived DPP–NDI˙− species. To minimize primary recombination is therefore the key to obtaining high-efficiency NiO/dye systems for DSSCs.
Conclusion
Femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption experiments demonstrate the ultrafast injection of holes (∼200 fs + ps components) by all three DPP dyes into NiO film. Subsequent charge recombination was found to occur over a remarkably wide range of timescales in each system. For DPPBr and DPPCN2 the main recombination lifetimes were ∼65 ps and ∼150 ps, respectively, yet recombination could still be observed up to the timescale of tens of μs. This confirms the results of earlier reports that the kinetic heterogeneity of NiO/dye photocathode systems is much greater than in their more well-known TiO2 photoanode counterparts, and it extends the timescale of observed recombination to span more than six orders of magnitude. It is clear that studies that use only slower methods such as ns laser spectroscopy to study dye-sensitized NiO may miss important parts of the recombination process.
Another important difference from TiO2/dye systems is the independence of the recombination kinetics from the excitation power in the range examined. These differences underscore the need to develop an independent understanding of NiO/dye systems in order to improve photocathode performance in DSSCs.
In DPP–NDI, we showed rapid intramolecular electron transfer (∼10 ps) after the injection of holes: NiO(+)/DPP˙−–NDI → NiO(+)/DPP–NDI˙−. This resulted in an ∼105-fold increase in the average charge separation lifetime to 〈τ〉 = 140 μs. The addition of a CoII/III electrolyte regenerated the dye in the DPP–NDI˙− state with an estimated efficiency of ∼95%, which explains previous reports of improved photovoltaic properties with DPP–NDI compared with DPPBr and DPPCN2. The main loss of charge appears to be in the competition between intramolecular electron transfer to the NDI unit and rapid recombination components of the NiO/DPP˙−–NDI state. Thus, the early recombination phases appear to be the main limiting factor for the performance of NiO/dye DSSCs, as has been suggested in some previous cases.
