    , Accepted 6th May 2015First published on 6th May 2015AbstractElectrode performances of MgH2–LiBH4 composite materials for lithium-ion batteries have been studied using LiBH4 as the solid-state electrolyte, which shows a high reversible capacity of 1650 mA h g−1 with an extremely low polarization of 0.05 V, durable cyclability and robust rate capability.
Nowadays, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become absolutely imperative devices to power mobile phones, laptops, electric vehicles (EVs), etc. Moreover, LIBs serve as energy storage devices to easily handle the renewable energy resources such as wind and solar energy.1,2 Developing high capacity materials for LIBs is necessary to meet the sustained growing demand for energy. Although advances have been made in improving the performance of LIBs in the past few decades, carbonaceous materials with low theoretical Li storage capacities are still mainly used as negative electrode materials for commercial LIBs. That is to say, the search for suitable high capacity negative electrode materials is essential and urgent.3
Recently, metal hydrides have been studied as conversion-type negative electrode materials for LIBs owing to their high theoretical Li storage capacities (>1000 mA h g−1), relatively low volume expansions (<200%) and suitable working potentials (0.1–1.0 V vs. Li+/Li).4–10 In particular, magnesium hydride, MgH2, has a theoretical capacity of 2038 mA h g−1 and a small polarization at an average potential of 0.5 V vs. Li+/Li. The Li+ insertion/extraction processes can be written by the following hydride conversion reaction: MgH2 + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Mg + 2LiH(1) From the reported results, the optimized MgH2 electrode shows a large reversible capacity of 1480 mA h g−1 in the first full discharge–charge cycle using a conventional organic liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in 1:1 dimethyl carbonate/ethylene carbonate). However, the capacity fades rapidly and reduces to less than 200 mA h g−1 after only 10 full cycles.4 A more recent report using nanoconfinement for MgH2 shows improved cycle life stability with a reversible capacity of 500 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles,11 but it is still far from sufficient. Therefore, to enhance the cyclability of MgH2 is one of the most important issues to realize its practical application.
In our earlier attempt, a sulfide-based solid-state electrolyte Li2S–P2S5 was used with MgH2 and Li metal to assemble an all-solid-state battery cell in order to obtain better cyclability.12 The results show that Li+ incorporation into MgH2 almost reaches the theoretical value; however, only ∼30% coulombic efficiency in the first cycle and a lack of cyclability indicate that the drawback had still not been overcome.
When searching for a suitable medium to achieve such a reversible hydride conversion reaction shown by eqn (1), Li+ conductivity is an important factor to be considered, another important factor being H− conductivity. As we know, the MgH2–LiBH4 composite is a well-known material in the hydrogen storage field.13–15 In this system, the mobility of H− in MgH2 can be strongly enhanced by LiBH4, due to a superior hydrogen exchange effect between MgH2 and LiBH4, which is revealed in our earlier work on hydrogen storage.15 In other words, this effect may lead to excellent H− conductivity when applying this material as a negative electrode for LIBs. Meanwhile, it was reported that LiBH4 exhibited a remarkably high Li+ conductivity on the order of 10−3 S cm−1 in its high temperature phase (>115 °C) with a stable operating window between 0 and 5 V vs. Li+/Li, which can be considered as a promising solid-state electrolyte candidate for LIBs.16–20 Combining the above two effects, when using MgH2–LiBH4 as the negative electrode and LiBH4 as the solid-state electrolyte, the hydride conversion reaction of eqn (1) could be dramatically accelerated, which leads to a much better battery performance.
In this communication, a battery cell constituted of MgH2–LiBH4|LiBH4|Li (illustrated in Fig. 1) has been fabricated for electrochemical tests. MgH2 used in this study was doped with 1 mol% Nb2O5 (named c-MgH2 hereafter), which had been proved to have a positive effect on the electrochemical performance for MgH2 in our previous study.12 The working electrode was prepared by simply ball-milling c-MgH2, LiBH4 and conductive carbon (acetylene black) with no further optimization. The thermal stability of the c-MgH2–LiBH4 composite was measured by thermogravimetry with differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), which shows a weight loss of less than 1 wt% at a temperature of RT–275 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating the good thermal stability and the wide operating temperature window of the electrode material. To obtain the fast Li+ conduction from LiBH4, all electrochemical measurements in this study were conducted at 120 °C by using an oil bath as the heating source. The electrode evolution upon the discharge–charge process at different stages was investigated by means of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).

Fig. 2(a) shows the first galvanostatic discharge–charge curves for the c-MgH2–LiBH4 composite electrode using LiBH4 as the solid-state electrolyte between 0.3 and 1.0 V vs. Li+/Li at a current density of 100 mA g−1. On the discharge curve (Li+ incorporation into MgH2), the potential gradually drops to around 0.5 V and shows a long flat plateau, corresponding to the hydride conversion reaction as shown by eqn (1). The discharge process was cut at 0.3 V to avoid the Li–Mg alloying reaction: Mg + xLi+ + xe− ↔ MgLix, which is a partially irreversible reaction and would weaken the cyclability of MgH2.4,7 On the charge curve (Li+ extraction), a plateau slightly above 0.5 V is observed. The polarization between Li insertion and extraction is only 0.05 V, which is much smaller than that of the MgH2 electrodes working with an organic liquid based electrolyte in some earlier reports.4,7 For comparison, this extremely low polarization is superior to all known metal oxide-based conversion-type negative electrode materials and even comparable to the well-recognized low polarization material of spinel Li4Ti5O12.21–23 The reason for such a low polarization could be owing to the fast diffusion of H− species and the high working temperature of 120 °C, which brings better kinetic properties to the hydride conversion reaction. The initial reversible capacity is 1650 mA h g−1 with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 94.7%. The above results indicate that the existence of LiBH4 significantly promotes the hydride conversion reaction due to its dual effects on Li+ conductivity and H− conductivity, resulting in such a low polarization and a high initial coulombic efficiency. In addition, the discharge/charge plateau voltage of around 0.5 V is much higher than the lithium plating voltage, making it a safe candidate as the negative electrode material for LIBs.

Ex situ XRD measurements have been carried out at different stages upon the initial discharge–charge process as shown in Fig. 2(b). The LiBH4 phase is observed at all stages since it is included in the electrode material. At the open circuit voltage (OCV) stage (i), a small amount of Mg phase is shown as an impurity which comes from the as-received MgH2 sample. As Li reacts with MgH2, the MgH2 peaks disappeared while LiH and Mg peaks appeared at 0.3 V (ii), which suggests that the conversion reaction shown by eqn (1) had occurred. When recharging the battery cell, clear MgH2 peaks emerged again together with Mg and LiH phases at the intermediate stage (iii). Finally, LiH peaks totally disappeared with only a small amount of Mg at 1.0 V (iv), which is equivalent to the OCV stage. These results verify the good reversibility of the conversion reaction. Interestingly, a new phase Mg(BH4)2 was generated (Fig. S2, ESI†) when further charging the battery cell to 2.0 V, which implies that a side reaction shown by eqn (2) might have occurred between 1.0 and 2.0 V. Mg + 2LiBH4 → Mg(BH4)2 + 2Li+ + 2e−(2) To avoid this side reaction, the galvanostatic discharge–charge cycling test was performed between 0.3 and 1.0 V at a current density of 800 mA g−1 as shown in Fig. 3. It shows that the c-MgH2–LiBH4 electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 1586 mA h g−1 in the first cycle, and this capacity rapidly fades in the first 5 cycles and stabilized to around 924 mA h g−1 within 50 cycles (Fig. 3 inset). It can be seen that the plateau voltage for discharge and charge processes nearly has not been changed during cycling up to 50 times, with a coulombic efficiency of over 99.5%, indicating that the electrode material works well between 0.3 and 1.0 V without any side reactions.

The rate capability of the c-MgH2–LiBH4 electrode was also investigated as shown in Fig. 4. Each discharge profile in this figure is created by the initial discharge cycle of independent cells at different current densities from 100 to 3200 mA g−1. It shows that the c-MgH2–LiBH4 electrode possesses excellent rate capability, in which the discharge capacity is 1742, 1704, 1659, 1600 and 1510 mA h g−1 at the current density of 100, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200 mA g−1, respectively. The fast kinetics could be ascribed to rapid Li+ and H− diffusion in the electrode material and on the electrode–electrolyte interface. It is noteworthy that the average voltage gradually decreases along with the increasing discharge rate, which could be caused by the insufficiency of electronic conductivity at high current density. Generally, the electronic conductivity of electrode material can be markedly improved by surface modification such as carbon coating,24 which can be considered in this system towards a future working direction in order to obtain better high rate performance.

In summary, we have demonstrated a metal hydride-based MgH2–LiBH4 composite material as a high performance negative electrode for lithium-ion batteries using LiBH4 as the solid-state electrolyte. LiBH4 acts as a multifunctional ion conductor and promotes not only Li+ but also H− conductivity, resulting in a much higher reversibility for the hydride conversion reaction. The large reversible capacity, durable cyclability, a suitable Li+ insertion/extraction voltage of around 0.5 V (vs. Li+/Li) and the extremely small polarization are particularly remarkable to make this material a promising candidate as a negative electrode material for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. Besides LiBH4, a large number of hydride-based solid-state alternatives e.g., Lim(BH4)nX (X = Cl, Br, I),16,25 LiM(BH4)3Cl (M = La, Gd, Ce),26,27 LiBH4–LiNH2,25,28 and LiAlH4/Li3AlH629 can also be considered for this system. The working temperature can be altered by substituting these various candidates, some of which even show high Li+ conductivity at room temperature. Moreover, this work opens a new way to search for suitable negative electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The electrochemical performance of numerous metal hydride-based materials will be investigated as negative electrode materials in this system.
