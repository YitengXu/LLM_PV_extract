J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 1992, 7, 215R-245RAtomic Spectrometry Update—Advances in Atomic Absorption and Fluorescence Spectrometry and Related Techniques(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )Steve J. Hill, John B. Dawson, W. John Price, Ian L. Shuttler and Julian F. TysonAbstractThis is the second review describing developments in atomic absorption and atomic fluorescence spectrometry since the restructuring of the earlier third and fourth ASU reviews on ‘Atomization and Excitation’ and ‘Instrumentation’ in 1990. Thus it follows on from the review published last year (J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 1991, 6, 187R) and includes fundamental processes and instrumentation in the areas of atomic absorption and atomic fluorescence spectrometry together with advances in related techniques such as atomic magneto-optical rotation spectrometry and laser-enhanced ionization. The review of ‘Atomic Emission Spectrometry’ may be found in JAAS, Volume 7, Issue 4. The full references, names and addresses of authors can be readily found from the Atomic Spectrometry Updates References in the relevant issue of JAAS. However, as an additional service to readers an abbreviated form of each literature reference quoted (except for those of Conference Abstracts) is given at the end of the review. Comments as to possible improvements in future reviews are always welcome.
