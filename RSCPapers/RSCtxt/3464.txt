    , Accepted 24th April 2023First published on 25th April 2023AbstractChalcogenide materials are being considered as some of the most promising systems for energy harvesting and energy conversion. Among them, the orthorhombic family of compounds X2Y3 (with X = Bi, Sb and Y = S, Se) has attracted special attention due to its interesting atomic structure and thermoelectric and optical properties. While Bi2S3 and Sb2Se3 have already been applied to solar cells, practical application of the new metastable Bi2Se3 is still a challenge due to the lack of data and knowledge on its properties. Here, the vibrational and structural properties of the orthorhombic metastable phase of Bi2Se3 are investigated by using Raman spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. We perform Raman spectroscopy measurements along with in situ thermal treatment on samples grown by electrochemical deposition. We show that by increasing the temperature an improved crystallization occurs in the orthorhombic structure, followed by recrystallization to the usual rhombohedral phase. Our results point out specific Raman modes of the orthorhombic phase. First principles computational results based on the density functional theory support the experimental data and describe three singlet Raman active vibrational modes, such as B(2)3g, B(2)2g and A(6)g.
Introduction
Bismuth selenide, Bi2Se3, has been widely investigated in the last 10 years, and the reason is that it may be the best so far known topological insulator.1,2 Facile synthesis, low toxicity, room temperature (RT) stability and, most importantly, a direct bandgap as large as 0.35 eV that could allow its application up to room temperature are among the advantages of Bi2Se3.3 Despite all these advantages, practical application of this material is still a challenge due to its electrical issues, such as a bulk native n-type conduction, due to high point defect concentrations which overcome the surface conduction4 and prevent its utilization in electronics and spintronics. In the course of development of this material, during this last decade, several new proposals for applications of Bi2Se3 have been often discussed, such as photovoltaics,5 energy storage,6 and thermoelectric technology for refrigerators and thermogenerators,7 and its utilization for the observation of novel and exotic phases of matter, such as topological superconductors8 and magnetic topological materials.9
The proposal of application in solar cells came with the possibility to synthesize a metastable crystalline phase with an orthorhombic structure,10,11 and a space group Pnma that shows a direct bandgap energy of about 1.2 eV.10,12,13 Several reports on solar cells using orthorhombic Bi2S3 and Sb2Se3 as sensitizers have shown promising results,14,15i.e., mainly a reduced recombination rate, due to grain-boundary and quasi-one dimensional crystal structures. These two materials in fact exhibit direct bandgaps in between 1.1 and 1.4 eV, respectively, which are close to the maximum attainable in the Shockley–Meissner limit.16
The orthorhombic Bi2S3 and other X2Y3 (with X = Bi, Sb and Y = S, Se, Te) compounds have also been highlighted due to their thermoelectric properties,17,18 which include their high Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity, reaching figures of merit of up to 0.6,18 which is a high value for room temperature applications. While the orthorhombic Bi2Se3 seems promising, a limited number of reports are not enough to discuss its full potential. Recent studies show that the bandgap of Bi2Se3 is really close to that required for achieving the maximum attainable efficiency and it can be used for the construction of tandem cells.12
The orthorhombic phase of Bi2Se3 is an isomorph of Bi2S3. Each bismuth is bonded to 6 selenium atoms in three distinct sites. The atoms are tightly bonded along the bc plane, but weakly grouped along the a-axis, giving a quasi-2D structure like the Sb2Se3 phase.14 Such an atomic arrangement propitiates the existence of inert surfaces, which have been reported as an outstanding property for solar cell applications, considerably reducing the dangling bonds and surface defects. Nonetheless, distinct from rhombohedral Bi2Se3, there is no van der Waals gap in between bc planes along the a-axis. This phase has been described as metastable because it can be recrystallized to the Rm structure at relatively low annealing temperatures.19 Experimentally, thin films of orthorhombic Bi2Se3 have been only grown by chemical13 or electrochemical10 synthesis at RT or low temperatures. The reason is still unknown, but may be related to either the substrate19 or the electrodeposition parameters.11 An alternative way to obtain the Pnma phase is to press the samples under high pressure,20 which keeps the orthorhombic phase under normal pressure conditions.
Despite the recent progress in the synthesis of Bi2Se3, there is still not much information available about its characteristics, for instance, its vibrational properties. The opposite occurs, instead, for the rhombohedral Rm phase, about which a significant amount of information is available. In this last case, the vibrational properties have been studied extensively, mainly focusing on the details and nature of the first few layers.21 Four Raman shifts describe the vibrational spectrum of this material: two at frequencies about 39 and 75 cm−1 due to active optical phonons with symmetry E(1)g and A(1)1g, respectively, one other at about 133 cm−1 with symmetry E(2)g and a last one (Ag(2)1) at about 175 cm−1.22 Another four Raman modes have been reported at the surface,23,24 such as an A(3)1 mode at about 160 cm−1, usually observed in few quintuple layers21 or superlattices.22 A recent report of the Raman spectroscopy of bulk samples that have a mixture of orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases shows the presence of a peak at about 157 cm−1 which could be probably related to the orthorhombic phase and not to a rhombohedral surface mode.11
Here, we present a structural and vibrational investigation of the orthorhombic phase of Bi2Se3 and compare the results obtained to those of the well-known rhombohedral phase. Theoretical results, based on ab initio calculations, indicate a rather complex vibration spectrum, showing a strong Ag singlet mode, which is in agreement with the Raman characterization results. This Ag mode was observed in orthorhombic Bi2Se3 samples grown by electrodeposition along with the Raman peaks of rhombohedral Bi2Se3 when thermal treatment is performed. Finally, the vibrational spectra were used to characterize the crystalline phase transition from orthorhombic to rhombohedral at about 140 °C. We also highlight that, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on orthorhombic Bi2Se3, using high quality samples, providing a full understanding of the vibrational properties of this system. Additionally, here we point out that Raman modes are much more effective to distinguish the rhombohedral from orthorhombic Bi2Se3, even compared to X-ray diffraction, which can be of high importance in further studies on information and energy applications of these two systems.
Methods
The high-quality samples used in this work are thin films of Bi2Se3 obtained by potentiostatic electrodeposition, with a thickness of about 1 μm; the preparation and overall characterization are described elsewhere.10,11,19 Raman spectra were collected using a Renishaw In Via Reflex Micro Raman Spectrometer with a laser light of wavelength λ = 512 nm at 5% of laser power through a L50 objective and grating of 3000 l mm−1. Also, Raman spectra were recorded during in situ annealing of the sample. This experiment was performed in a hot/cold stage filled with nitrogen gas. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 540 K, in steps of 30 K, and at the end of each step one spectrum was recorded.
Geometrical optimizations were performed using ab initio methods within the density functional theory (DFT).25,26 The calculations were made utilizing the VASP code (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package).27–31 The projector augmented wave (PAW)31,32 method was employed to account for the electron–ion core interaction, utilizing the GGA (Generalized Gradient Approximation) exchange–correlation functional with the PBE parametrization (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof)33 including van der Waals interactions by means of Grimme-D3.34,35 PAW–PBE potentials were selected for Bi and Se atoms. A k-space grid was sampled until reaching a reasonable convergence, that is a 2 × 4 × 2 mesh for the orthorhombic phase and a 4 × 4 × 2 mesh for the rhombohedral phase. The cut-off energy for the plane wave expansion was selected as 500 eV. Structures were optimized until the forces in all the atoms were lower than 0.01 eV Å−1.
Once the fully optimized unit cell and atomic positions were obtained, the determination of the vibrational information was carried out by means of density functional perturbation theory (DFPT),36–38 followed by a post-treatment using the Phonopy code.39,40 In DFPT, no supercell is needed for phonon calculations, which is an advantage in comparison to finite displacement methods. Raman off-resonant activity spectra were calculated applying the methodology established by Porezag et al.41 as implemented in a Python's script,42 with the objective of determining the polarizability derivative of every single phonon eigenmode at Γ-point. The structural models for the calculations were constructed based on the Rietveld refinement cell and are presented in Fig. 1(a) for the Pnma phase and Fig. 1(b) for the Rm phase. The atomic positions for each cell are displayed in Table S1 in the ESI.† The final optimized unit cell parameters corresponded to a = 4.132 D and c = 28.360 D for the rhombohedral case and a = 11.587 D, b = 4.1000 D and c = 11.412 D for the orthorhombic crystalline system.

Results
We start discussing the vibrational modes of orthorhombic phases of Bi2Se3 with ab initio calculations in the framework of DFT, as described in the Methods section. The cell has a Pnma space group with D2h symmetry. The lattice parameters used in the calculations are slightly smaller than the experimental ones, as expected from vdW-D3 corrections, as displayed in Table 1. The lattice parameter of the Rm phase is also presented in Table 1. For the D2h point group, eight 1D irreducible representations can be found, and about 60 phonon modes can be found for a cell with 20 atoms, although only 27 are Raman active modes. The Raman active modes are Ag ⊕ Bg ⊕ B2g ⊕ B3g. The calculated phonon branches and density of states (ph-DoS) for both rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases are respectively shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b). While the rhombohedral structure is composed of 12 optical branches forming four large bands of phonons, seen in the density of vibrational states, the orthorhombic phase has many more branches and a large dispersed phonon diagram. At the R point, 12 distinct phonon frequencies are found. The ph-DoS also indicates 12 phonon bands.

 Fig. 2  Phonon dispersion and phonon density for the (a) Pnma and (b) Rm phases of Bi2Se3. 
The atomic arrangement of Rm cells is well known, showing that a quintuple layer (QL) is composed of Se–Bi–Se–Bi–Se and interacted by van der Waals bonding leading to a large vacuum gap in the structure. The atomic structure of the Pnma phase is rather complex. This forms a closed bilayer of Bi2Se3, which can be seen vertically in Fig. 1(a), with a certain atomic roughness. Such bilayers are weakly bonded to each other, but do not present vacuum gaps as the Rm phase. The importance of such closed bilayers has been previously discussed for Sb2Se314 in the scope of solar cells.
As discussed above, for the Rm phase, only 4 Raman active modes are expected among the 12 phonon branches of this crystal. The active Raman shifts and their respective irreducible representations are presented in Table 2, for both phases of Bi2Se3, with comparison to experimental results (that will be presented in detail below) and another calculation results done elsewhere. Only the most active Raman modes are displayed. In the ESI,† in Table S2, all Raman modes can be found. The 13 most active Raman modes of the Pnma phase are 8Ag ⊕ 1Bg ⊕ 2B2g ⊕ 2B3g. The A(6)g mode at about 156.7 cm−1 and the B(2)3g mode at 125.6 cm−1 are the ones with high intensity.

In order to compare the activities of the main Raman modes, the simulated spectra of orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases are shown in Fig. 3. The simulation for the Rm structure counts only with the Ag(2)1 and E(2)g modes and is in agreement with the literature.45 The simulation for the Pnma structure counts with the 13 modes listed in Table 2.
 Fig. 3  Simulated Raman spectra for both the Pnma and Rm crystallographic structures of Bi2Se3. The inset with the atomic scheme shows the displacement vectors for the A(6)g mode of the Pnma phase. 
The A(6)g mode at about 156.7 cm−1 is the dominant peak in the Bi2Se3 orthorhombic spectrum in Fig. 3. The displacement vectors of the vibration are also shown in Fig. 3 and show that this mode is due to displacement along the “a” direction of the cell. This vibration is a stretching of the bilayer, discussed above, generating a kind of oscillation in the bilayer thickness. Previous results reported for the isomorphic Bi2S3, as a matter of comparison, the A(1)1g and B(2)3g modes were found at much higher frequencies 224.1 and 254.5 cm−1, respectively.46 The lower frequencies in Bi2Se3 could be mainly related to the higher atomic mass of Se, in comparison to S.
It is also important to mention that there are some peak overlaps on the spectrum of the two phases, once they have modes at almost same wavenumbers, such as at about 130 cm−1, where the Rm phase shows the E(2)g mode and the Pnma phase has the active B(2)3g mode. At about 173 cm−1, the orthorhombic B(2)2g peak is also close in energy to rhombohedral Ag(2)1. We notice, however, that the intensity of these peaks is distinct in both spectra in Fig. 3. E(2)g is more intense than Ag(2)1 in the Rm case; however, for the Pnma case, B(2)2g shows higher activity than B(2)3g. This behavior could be useful to separate contributions of both phases.
The Raman spectrum from the rhombohedral phase is widely reported and is in good agreement with the theoretical data described above. The Raman modes for the orthorhombic phase, nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, have not been presented so far. Here, to proceed with the investigation of the vibrational properties of the Pnma structure, we are carrying out a complete evaluation of the Raman spectrum of samples presenting the orthorhombic crystalline phase.
The samples used in this work present, in majority, an orthorhombic (Pnma) phase, with a small mixture of nanocrystalline rhombohedral grains. For more information about the sample preparation, refer to Methods section and ref. 11. In previous reports, two intense and characteristic peaks at about 128.4 and 173.1 cm−1 of the Rm phase of Bi2Se3 were clearly observed, due to E(2)g and Ag(2)1, respectively.11,19 A third peak at about 158.7 cm−1 could also be seen in these reports, but with a very small intensity. By adding 0.06 mM CuCl2 to the preparation electrolyte of refs. 8 and 9, the two peaks from the Rm phase described above are strongly reduced, making it more relevant at 158.7 cm−1. These changes in the Raman spectrum could be taken as evidence of the increase of the Pnma phase over Rm in samples produced with the CuCl2 additive. This increase of the Pmna phase in the detriment of Rm was not clearly observed in X-ray diffraction analysis (results not shown), which could be related to the low diffraction intensity of Pmna in comparison to Rm.
The Raman spectra recorded at different temperatures of a sample prepared with the addition of 0.06 mM CuCl2 to the deposition electrolyte are shown in Fig. 4(a), from RT to 540 K. In Fig. 4(b), the spectrum at 330 K is observed, which better shows the peak from the orthorhombic phase. Other than the peak at 158.7 cm−1, four other peaks could be identified by using Lorentzian peak profiling. All peaks in the fitting procedure have almost the same FWHM of about 20 cm−1, which is large compared to the single crystal, but acceptable for polycrystalline thin films. Five fitting peaks were used to better adjust the Raman data. The following peaks were observed at 109.0, 126.6, 141.1, 158.7 and 173.9 cm−1. They were attributed to the modes A(4)g, B(2)3g, B(1)2g, A(6)g and B(2)2g, respectively. No comparison was found in the literature. The peak at 158.9 cm−1 in the as-grown samples of Bi2Se3 has been previously discussed as a possible surface mode of Rm Bi2Se3 with A(3) symmetry.11 Here, by using DFT analysis, we show that such a peak is due to the orthorhombic phase vibrational mode with Ag symmetry, denoted as A(6)g.
 Fig. 4  (a) Raman spectra at different temperatures. (b and c) Fitted Raman spectra at temperatures of 330 and 540 K, respectively. (d) Peak positions of E(2)g, A(6)g, and Ag(2)1 as a function of temperature, where the dashed lines are the linear fit and the continuous lines are the simulated curves with eqn (1). 
By increasing the temperature from RT to 330 K, the peaks in the spectrum become narrower, which is attributed to improvements in the Pnma crystalline properties due to the low temperature annealing. At a temperature of 360 K, the peaks Ag(2)1 and E(2)g from rhombohedral Bi2Se3 start to appear at about 132.0 and 176.2 cm−1, respectively. This means that the onset temperature for phase recrystallization to Rm occurs in between 330 K and 360 K. From DFT calculations, the free energy, at zero kelvin, could be estimated to be −20.2105 eV and −20.0765 eV per formula unit, for the Rm and Pnma phases, respectively, indicating that the Rm phase is the most stable at 0 K, so no transition from Pnma to Rm should be expected by increasing the temperature and indicating that the orthorhombic Bi2Se3 thin film obtained by electrodeposition is metastable. By further increasing the temperature, one can see that the Ag(2)1 and E(2)g modes become more intense while the peak A(6)g at about 158.7 cm−1 decreases and vanishes at 510 K. Clearly, above 360 K and up to 480 K, both crystalline phases coexist in the Raman spectrum. At temperatures of 510 and 540 K, only the rhombohedral modes are observed. Fig. 4(c) shows the Raman spectrum at 540 K, showing clearly the Ag(2)1 and E(2)g modes at frequencies 130.3 and 174.2 cm−1, respectively. The Pnma phase is no longer detected in these samples. A similar result on recrystallization by heating was previously discussed on the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis.47

Fig. 4(d) shows the position of the peaks as a function of temperature obtained by fitting the peak profile with Lorentzian functions. All peaks present a frequency red-shift by increasing the temperature, which is probably related to the increase of lattice parameters due to thermal expansion, as discussed in refs. 40 and 41. The rate of frequency decrease of the Raman modes of the rhombohedral phase has been appropriately described by Irfan et al.44 with a linear behavior for the frequency–temperature relationship of the modes A(1)1g, E(2)g and Ag(2)1, with a coefficient of −0.0194 cm−1 K−1 for E(1)g and −0.0195 cm−1 K−1 for Ag(2)1, at temperatures ranging from 83 to 523 K. Kim et al.48 found a rather small value for the temperature coefficient of the Ag(2)1 mode, about −0.015 cm−1 K−1, showing that the thermal expansion accounts for 40% of the change in the frequency in single crystals.
Here, our results from 300 K to 570 K give a coefficient of −0.0125 cm−1 K−1 for Ag(2)1, which is smaller than previous reports. Additionally, our results point out small changes in the frequency of rhombohedral E(2)g and orthorhombic A(6)g modes. The reason could be intimately related to the overall crystalline structure. While previous reports were based on observations in single crystals, here, we describe results from polycrystalline thin films. The dashed lines in the graph of Fig. 4(d) are the linear fits that give the temperature coefficients. The continuous lines in the data for the E(2)g and Ag(2)1 modes stand for the simulation of Raman shift changes based only on thermal expansion, using the equation below: f(T) = f0e−γT(2αa + αc),(1)where f0 is the zeroth-temperature Raman shift. The equation was adapted from ref. 48 due to quasi-harmonic corrections considering the thermal expansion of the lattice. The expansion coefficients were assumed to be almost constant in the annealing range and equal to 1.9 × 10−5 K−1 and 1.1 × 10−5 K−1 for αa and αc, respectively.49γ is the Grüneisen parameter, which is a parameter that relates the changes in the phonon frequencies to the cell volume and for Bi2Se3 it is equal to 1.4.48 at about 270 K. For the simulation, the f0 constants for each mode E(2)g and Ag(2)1 were obtained from the extrapolation of a linear fit, which gives 133.2 and 180.1 cm−1, respectively. Notice that the simulation fairly agrees with the Ag(2)1 data, indicating that the thermal expansion may be the main origin of the temperature induced red-shift in this mode. The simulation for E(2)g indicates smaller frequency values compared to the values observed in experiments. No simulation was performed for the peak at 158.7 cm−1 once it is being attributed to the orthorhombic phase of Bi2Se3, and no estimation of the thermal expansion or the Grüneisen parameter could be found in the literature.
Based on the results described above for the E(2)g peak, i.e., the observation of a smaller red-shift in Raman frequencies in comparison to what should be expected from thermal expansion effects only (from the simulation), we argue that it could occur due to the thin film nature of the samples. The substrate in these films could introduce strain and texture in the lattice, which may lead to the distinct red-shift to each Raman mode of the material.
At this point, we consider that the peaks close to 132 and 175 cm−1 should be better discussed, since they appear in both the spectra of Pnma and Rm, as can be seen in Fig. 4(b) and (c), with just small deviations in frequency. Additionally, Table S2 (ESI†) indicates that peaks close to these frequencies are expected from DFT for both phases. Nonetheless, the peaks in Fig. 4(b) were indexed as the orthorhombic phase while the peaks in Fig. 4(c) were indexed as the rhombohedral ones. Our analysis here was based on the relative peak intensities. Raman modes for Rm have been extensively reported with the E(2)g peak always higher in intensity than Ag(2)1,11,44,50,51 in agreement with the DFT results. For the Pnma phase, however, the peak at 126.6 cm−1 is less intense than the one at 173.9 cm−1. The Raman data at low temperatures, in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b), present a peak relationship which was fully attributed to the orthorhombic phase, while increasing the temperature, the peak profile changes and agrees well with the expected for the rhombohedral phase extensively found in the literature.
As an example of the Raman peak indexation described above, we present in Fig. 5 the Raman spectra of a sample with a highly crystalline orthorhombic phase electrodeposited with the electrolyte described in ref. 17, without the addition of CuCl2, obtained with distinct excitation lasers. Four excitations were used: 785 nm (IR), 514 nm (green), 488 nm (blue) and 405 nm (violet). By using high energy excitations (violet, blue and green wavelengths), the peaks of the Pnma phase at 126 cm−1 and 158 cm−1 are more intense. The dashed vertical lines in the figure clearly show the Raman shift for the two phases. For the 405 nm laser, the Raman spectrum is the one closest to the one expected for the Pnma phase based on the computation results of Fig. 3. The spectra with IR excitations, however, show a more pronounced Raman shift for B(1)1g and A(8)g modes of the Pnma phase. Due to inversion symmetry of the Bi2Se3 crystal, the optical modes of the Rm phase have been reported to be either Raman active or IR-active.52 The signal intensity for IR excitation was also enhanced by 20-fold compared to those obtained for the other excitation wavelengths. Glinka et al.53 reported a 100-fold enhancement of the Raman signal by switching from 532 nm to 785 nm which was attributed in part to the optical coupling to surface states of the Rm phase.53 Alternatively, the depth of penetration of IR laser all the way down to the interface between the film and the substrate could help in explaining the emergence of 131 cm−1 E(2)g and 173.3 cm−1 Ag(2)1 modes of the Rm phase since the previous results indicate the existence of a mixture of Rm and Pnma phases during early stages of Bi2Se3 film growth (near the substrate) by electrodeposition.10 The relationship between the laser wavelength and phase selectivity could be additionally discussed in terms of resonant Raman scattering due to the excitation of electronic states. Notice that the orthorhombic Bi2Se3 should present a band gap in between 1.2 and 1.6 eV,10,19 mostly dependent on the syntheses, which will be excited by using a low wavelength laser, such as the green (2.41 eV), blue (2.56 eV) and violet (3.06 eV). So, we attributed phase selectivity to both, dependence on the penetration depth of the excitation and the activation of electronic levels by resonant Raman scattering.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the vibrational properties of the Bi2Se3 orthorhombic phase were calculated using DFT showing an intense peak for the A(6)1g mode at about 155.2 cm−1, which is in good agreement with experimental results. Other modes were also found in the experimental data as well as in the computational results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the vibrational and Raman properties of the Pnma phase of the Bi2Se3 compound. Additionally, the existence of an orthorhombic phase was confirmed in low-temperature-prepared Bi2Se3 samples. The thermal annealing of the samples promotes an improvement of the crystal lattice of the orthorhombic phase from RT to 330 K, but above 360 K the rhombohedral phase starts to recrystallize from the orthorhombic phase. At temperatures higher than 510 K, all orthorhombic phases totally transformed into the rhombohedral phase.
