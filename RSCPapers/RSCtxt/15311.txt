    , Accepted 3rd August 2022First published on 3rd August 2022AbstractNonfullerene acceptors have boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Rigid fused-ring molecular skeletons enable decent molecular planarity and stacking orientations, but suffer from tedious synthesis procedures for those with large π-backbones. Promisingly, the π-bridge strategy provides an alternative to readily manipulate the light utilization, but sometimes increases the conformation complexity. To rationally regulate the performance of π-bridged acceptors, herein, we report two new acceptors WA1 and WA2, functionalized with single or dual π-bridges flanking the phenylalkyl modified indacenodithiophene (IDT) backbone. The unilateral π-bridge endows WA1 with an asymmetric electron cloud distribution, affording a greater dipole moment and well-organized molecular orientation. In contrast, the bilateral π-bridges endow WA2 with two disparate molecular dipoles and disordered stacking orientations, generating inferior PCEs below 10%. Notably, the PM6:WA1 device shows a remarkable PCE of up to 15.45% with an impressive fill factor (FF) of up to 79.31%, both of which rank among the highest values of OSCs with π-bridged acceptors. More importantly, the PM6:Y6:WA1 ternary organic solar cell (TOSC) affords a high PCE of up to 18.15%, which is the best efficiency among Y6-based bulk-heterojunction TOSCs and the first example of an efficient ternary cell featuring a π-bridged guest acceptor.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have provided one promising approach to utilize inexhaustible solar energy, featuring low-cost, solution processability, portability, light-weight and translucent advantages.1–3 A typical optoelectronic conversion process usually consists of photon harvesting, exciton generation and separation into free charges, and charge transport and collection. Besides, charge recombination is inevitable for most solar cells.2 Excitingly, the consecutive development of novel organic photovoltaic materials has endowed OSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) surpassing 19%.4–6 Materials innovation has been recognized as one of the most important driving forces to realize high performance and low-cost OSCs for practical applications.
Fused-ring acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type ITIC could be one landmark to revive OSCs, because of the merits of a broad absorption profile and easy-tuning frontier energy levels.7 To further expand the absorption spectra for optimal solar light utilization, multiple fused-ring A–DA′D–A type acceptor Y6 and its derivatives have been elaborately designed and frequently researched, which constantly refresh the photovoltaic efficiencies of OSCs.8–14 Additionally, the π-bridge strategy, free of tedious ring expansion synthesis, is recognized as one alternative to further shift the absorption spectra of acceptors, via an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect and extended electron cloud delocalization. Consequently, the short-circuit current densities (JSC) of solar cells could be boosted, which may generate greater PCEs than those without π-bridges. For example, alkylthio thiophene π-bridged ACS8 (ITIC derivative) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene π-bridged ATT-9 (Y6 derivative) have recorded an impressive JSC of up to 25.3 and 30.0 mA cm−2, respectively.15,16 However, the consequent high-level highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels not only limit the utilization of donor materials, but also reduce the open-circuit voltages (VOC) of the resultant OSCs. Another outcome that should be particularly noted is that the π-bridge segment could give rise to two opposite impacts on intermolecular stacking, that is, the unfavorable irregularity induced by rotatable σ-bonds and favorable extension of π-conjugated planes. As reported widely, intramolecular weak non-covalent interactions could improve molecular planarity through partly “locking” the σ-bonds, which has been verified by theoretical calculations and single crystal X-ray diffraction.17–21 In practice, however, there is inadequate time for molecules to rearrange during the fast film preparation step of the solution procedure. This may result in fairly different final molecular conformations from those of theoretical simulations or slow solvent volatilization/exchange in single crystal cultivation. Therefore, π-bridges incorporated into rigid molecular systems would inevitably increase the complexity of intermolecular stacking and orientations. As a consequence, OSCs based on π-bridged acceptors often suffer from inferior fill factors (FFs) smaller than 75%, trailing far behind the competitive FFs surpassing 80% in some rigid molecular systems.22–24 In addition, in terms of efficient ternary organic solar cells (TOSCs) with dual acceptors, nearly all of the guest components belong to A–D–A or A–DA′D–A rigid molecules,4–6,23–33 and the π-bridged acceptors were considered unpopular owing to the drawbacks mentioned above. Nevertheless, the great potential of π-bridges drives us to conduct deeper research for constructing highly efficient acceptors for OSCs.
In this regard, we focus on regulating the performance of π-bridged acceptors. Based on the phenylalkyl attached acceptor LA1-4F, two new acceptors WA1 and WA2 flanked with single and dual alkylthio thiophene π-bridges are designed (Fig. 1a). The two acceptors show successive red-shifted absorption spectra and concurrently elevated molecular energy levels. More importantly, the unilateral π-bridge greatly alters the electrostatic potential (ESP) symmetry along the π-backbone, inducing a greater molecular dipole moment and markedly enhanced molecular assemblies for better charge transport. In contrast, the bilateral π-bridges not only bring about more complexity of intermolecular stacking, but also generate two significantly different molecular dipoles arising from the disparate spatial arrangement of attached alkylthio chains. These disadvantages disturb the molecular assembly, resulting in fairly disordered molecular orientations and undeveloped charge mobilities in neat films as well as bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blends. With the donor PM6, the acceptor LA1-4F delivers a moderate PCE of 10.61% with a decent FF of 76.29%. Encouragingly, the reduced energy loss, expanded absorption profile and optimized charge/exciton properties endow solar cells of PM6:WA1 with a collectively improved VOC of 0.860 V, JSC of 22.65 mA cm−2 and FF of up to 79.31%, yielding a boosted PCE of up to 15.45%. Particularly worth mentioning is that both the PCE and FF recorded from PM6:WA1 rank among the highest values of all OSCs based on π-bridged acceptors so far. In comparison, the devices of WA2 receive relatively inferior PCEs smaller than 10%. Furthermore, the PM6:Y6:WA1 ternary device with WA1 as the guest acceptor shows an optimal PCE of up to 18.15%. It is equally remarkable that this should be the first example so far featuring a π-bridged guest acceptor among high performance TOSCs (PCE ≥ 17%). Therefore, these findings emphasize the rational molecular design of π-bridged acceptors for state-of-the-art binary and ternary solar cells.

Results and discussion
The synthesis details of the three acceptors are collected in the ESI,† with chemical structures shown in Fig. 1a. All acceptors possess decent solubility in commonly used solvents ensuring a good solution processing ability. Firstly, we performed theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) to evaluate their molecular configurations, focusing on the impacts of unilateral and bilateral π-bridges (Fig. 1b and c). The molecular LA1-4F exhibits a highly planar molecular backbone as expected. The insertion of one or two π-bridges mildly disturbs the molecular planarity, owing to the trade-off between the negative σ-single bond and positive sulphur to sulphur noncovalent interactions. As a consequence, a small distortion with dihedral angles less than 9° was discovered for two π-bridged molecular planes. The molecular dipole moments are displayed in Fig. 1c. It is evident that the highly planar π-conjugated backbone of LA1-4F entirely offsets the dipole effect of each fragment, which is also confirmed by the decent symmetry of electrostatic potential (ESP) distributions along the backbone (Fig. 1d). Hence, a small dipole moment of 0.31 Debye was recorded, derived from the different spatial arrangement of the four phenylalkyl side chains, which are orthogonal to the molecular backbone of LA1-4F. As for the WA1 molecule, the insertion of one π-bridge produces asymmetrical ESP distributions along the π-backbone, affording a much higher dipole moment of 2.30 Debye. Influenced by the spatial effect of side chains and small distortion of the molecular backbone, WA1 gives rise to an excentric dipole position. Despite that, the greater dipole moment of WA1 could facilitate the molecular self-assembly owing to the stronger molecular electrostatic interaction.34
With regard to the WA2 molecule, the introduction of dual π-bridges increases the backbone symmetry and affords more balanced ESP distributions, greatly offsetting the dipole moments along the molecular backbone. Notwithstanding, the spatial conformations of two alkylthio chains in π-bridges bring about two splitting dipole moments (Fig. 1c). When the two alkylthio chains are located at one side of the backbone plane, the dipole effects of these side chains play a dominating role, generating a high dipole moment of 3.22 Debye, with the direction perpendicular to the molecular planarity of WA2 (Fig. S1†). However, the contributions of the two alkylthio chains are markedly counterbalanced when they are located at opposite positions, resulting in a small dipole moment of 0.50 Debye and an excentric dipole direction owing to the slightly distorted molecular plane (Fig. S2†). Allowing for the impact of dipole moments, the two splitting dipole effects could produce opposite impacts on molecular self-assembly behaviors. The much closer total energies of these two conformations (ΔEtotal = 0.26 kcal mol−1) allow an uncontrolled internal conversion and enable a probable mixture of conformations in WA2 samples, which may produce intricate intermolecular interactions and disturb the ordered molecular stacking. In comparison, the fair molecular planarity of WA1 offers negligible differences for the single alkylthio chains to locating above or below the molecular plane as displayed in Fig. 1c.
We then investigated the absorption profiles as shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1. The spectra both in dilute solutions and as thin films receive successive bathochromic shifts with the introduction of π-bridges, attributed to extended molecular backbones and an enhanced ICT effect. Despite the slightly smaller extinction coefficient of WA1 among the three acceptors in dilute solution, the film state of WA1 receives the highest absorbance instead (Fig. S3†). Besides, notable bathochromic shifts by over 40 nm were detected for thin films relative to solutions, signifying greatly enhanced intermolecular interactions in solid states. The temperature-dependent absorption spectra suggest that WA1 shows the strongest intermolecular interactions among the three acceptors, considering the smallest drop of absorbance during the heating process (Fig. S4†). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were conducted to evaluate the energy levels as displayed in Fig. S5.† The onset potentials of the oxidation and reduction processes are listed in Table 1. The calculated energy levels are also collected in Table 1. With the successive introduction of π-bridges, the resulting acceptors receive sequential rises of HOMO and LUMO levels concurrently. We subsequently performed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements for the three powers to preliminarily evaluate the crystallization properties. During the cooling process (Fig. S6†), WA1 receives a fairly exothermic crystallization peak at 78.73 °C. In comparison, there are no obvious exothermic transitions for the WA2 sample and small exothermic transitions between 60 and 72 °C for the LA1-4F sample, suggesting inferior crystallinity for both acceptors. More distinctions are recorded during the heating process (Fig. 2b). WA1 exhibits characteristic thermal transformations with the presence of a strong cold crystallization exothermic transition (181.72 °C and −34.77 J g−1) and a melting endothermic transition (251.35 °C and 77.49 J g−1). Therefore, the DSC information strongly indicates the highest crystallization of WA1, which is partly attributed to its high dipole moment in a definite direction.

In order to verify the crystallization behaviors of the three acceptors and further probe their molecular orientations, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) studies were performed, with the corresponding line-cut profiles and 2D images illustrated in Fig. 2c–f. It is evident that the three films show fairly different crystallization features and molecular orientations. Both the acceptors LA1-4F and WA1 adopt a typical face-on orientation with a lamellar stacking diffraction signal in the in-plane (IP) direction and a π–π stacking diffraction spot in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. However, the two signals were visibly enhanced from LA1-4F to WA1. Meanwhile, the π–π diffraction peaks move from Qz = 1.83 Å−1 to 1.86 Å−1, manifesting a tighter π–π stacking distance from 3.43 Å to 3.38 Å. According to Scherrer's equation, the π–π crystal coherence length (CCLπ–π) of LA1-4F and WA1 was calculated to be 12.50 Å and 27.13 Å, respectively. Therefore, these data again confirmed the increased molecular assembly and crystallinity of WA1 with the help of a single conjugated π-bridge. Differently, WA2 shows many weak diffraction rings in the 2D image and dense diffraction peaks in both the IP and OOP directions. For one thing, the increased diffraction signals suggest passable crystallization properties. In the meantime, the multiple diffraction rings indicate fairly directionless molecular stacking orientations. According to DFT calculations above, the mixed spatial conformations of the two alkylthio chains and the consequent vastly different molecular dipole effects could partly be responsible for the disordered molecular stacking orientations of WA2. Although most of the comparable A–π–D–π–A molecules exhibited ordered face-on or edge-on molecular orientations,15,35 in some cases disordered molecular stacking could be detected with the presence of side chains in two π-bridges.36 These results are reasonable as the various molecular structures including π-backbones and side chains could exert disturbance on the spatial transformations and therefore final molecular conformation ratios. The two types of molecular dipoles and disordered stacking orientations of WA2 undoubtedly weaken the π-orbital overlaps and electronic coupling with adjacent molecules, and therefore impair the charge transport or transfer process.
The electron mobilities (μacceptore) of the three neat acceptors along the vertical vector with the space charge limited current (SCLC) model confirm this speculation (Fig. S7†). The average μacceptore of LA1-4F, WA1 and WA2 was determined to be 1.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 3d. It is evident that the dominating face-on orientation of WA1 facilitates vertical charge transport, and the disordered orientations of WA2 molecules weaken this vectored charge transport process.

Next we fabricated photovoltaic devices to evaluate the photovoltaic properties, with PM6 as the donor. The optimizing processes including weight ratios and thermal annealing are collected in Table S1.† The optimal photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2 with the corresponding J–V plots displayed in Fig. 3a. Initially we compared the performance of LA1-4F with that of previously reported alkyl-substituted IDIC-4F. Apparently, the PM6:LA1-4F device shows an all-around increase in VOC, JSC, FF and the overall PCE, relative to those of the PM6:IDIC-4F device.37 This finding verifies the priority of phenylalkyl side chains over alkyl chains in the BHJ morphology, exciton and charge behaviors, as confirmed in rigid A–D–A molecular systems.38 As for WA1, a greater VOC of 0.860 V was recorded, attributed to the elevated LUMO energy level and further suppressed energy loss Eloss (0.58 eV). Meanwhile, the expanded absorption spectrum of WA1 contributes to a boosted JSC of 22.65 mA cm−2. We can also discover a broad and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) response in the PM6:WA1 cell, with an integrated JSC of 22.20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3b). Besides, it should be mentioned that the acceptors featuring π-bridges often suffer from low FFs below 75%, owing to the rotatable σ-single bonds and the resulting disadvantageous molecular assembly, morphology and charge transport properties. Encouragingly, the PM6:WA1 solar cell affords an impressive high FF of up to 79.31%, promoting the efficiency up to 15.45%. We collected most of the π-bridged nonfullerene acceptors reported (Table S2† and Fig. 3c). These statistical results again reveal the great priority of WA1 in enhancing FF and PCE, both of which rank among the highest values of OSCs with π-bridged acceptors. However, as for the WA2 acceptor with a higher LUMO level and further red-shifted absorption profile, a lower JSC of 14.88 mA cm−2 and FF of 67.71% were recorded, indicating poor charge generation, transport and collection efficiencies. Considering the relatively small HOMO energy offset of 0.04 eV between PM6 and WA2, we subsequently prepared solar cells with PBDB-T (an analog of PM6 but with a higher HOMO level) as the donor to enlarge the energy offset. The PBDB-T:WA2 cell generates a disappointing PCE smaller than 5% (Table 2). The appropriate HOMO offset of 0.20 eV in this system may suggest other causations for the low efficiencies of WA2 based solar cells. We found that both the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) in the PM6:WA2 cell are much lower by more than an order of magnitude than those of the WA1 counterpart (Table 2 and Fig. S8†). Based on the foregoing analysis, the disorder of WA2 molecular orientations probably takes the major responsibility for inferior oriented charge transport properties and low efficiencies in devices.

To study the charge transfer processes, we measured the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra for neat PM6 and the three BHJ films. As evident from Fig. 4a, the strong emission of PM6 was hugely quenched in all three blends. Note that the charge transfer efficiency between PM6 and WA1 should be the highest, as the emission of PM6 was almost completely canceled. In comparison, partial emission is maintained in the blends of PM6:LA1-4F and PM6:WA2, respectively (Fig. 4a and b). The most competitive charge transfer efficiency between PM6 and WA1 should be promoted by their equally strong face-on orientations and the resulting intermolecular π-orbital overlaps. The disordered stacking orientations of WA2 molecules would seriously reduce the π-orbital coupling with donor segments and therefore hinder the charge transfer between them. Then we explored the exciton dissociation and charge generation behaviors by plotting photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff). As shown in Fig. 4c, the devices of LA1-4F and WA1 show equally high exciton dissociation probabilities (ηdiss) of around 95%. In contrast, the photocurrent of the PM6:WA2 cell cannot reach saturation even at a high effective voltage of 5.0 V. Consequently, an inferior ηdiss of 64.65% was evaluated, taking responsibility, at least partially, for the low hole and electron mobilities (Table 2). Then we evaluated the geminate recombination behaviors by plotting JSCversus light intensity (Plight) following the equation of JSC ∝ Plights.40 Apparently, the PM6:WA2 solar cell suffers from serious geminate recombination with a small exponential factor s of 0.920 (Fig. 4d). The high s close to 0.98 in the PM6:WA1 system suggests negligible geminate recombination, benefitting from the strong and balanced charge transport in the device (Table 2). Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements give more details about the charge recombination and extraction dynamics. The carrier lifetimes and recombination time of photocarriers (τrec) could reflect the recombination degree in solar cells.41 As Fig. 4e shows, the PM6:WA1 device shows a relatively greater τrec, corresponding to a slower recombination rate. In comparison, the PM6:WA2 device is subjected to the highest recombination rate in the three systems. The calculated charge extraction times (τext) (Fig. 4f) show that the PM6:WA1 device exhibits a smaller τext of 2.81 μs than those in the other two solar cells, mirroring faster charge sweep-out and extraction efficiencies.42

As exciton and charge behaviors are strongly correlated with the microstructures of BHJ, we then performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. As suggested in Fig. 5a, b and d, e, both PM6:LA1-4F and PM6:WA1 blends afford comparable uniform surfaces with fibrous networks, which are highly favored by OSCs to transfer free charges.6,38,43 Note that more fine fibers were observed in PM6:WA1, conducive to further suppressing charge recombination. In comparison, some aggregates take shape in the surface of PM6:WA2, leading to a slightly higher root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.83 nm (Fig. 5c). Despite that, a favorable morphology could be detected by excluding these high-lying nodes, which is also confirmed from its phase image (Fig. S9†) and TEM image (Fig. 5f). Then we acquired the details of molecular stacking and orientations based on GIWAXS studies, as displayed in Fig. 5g–j. Again, comparable molecular orientations were observed in PM6:LA1-4F and PM6:WA1 blends. This finding also indicates that the relatively low crystallinity of LA1-4F was remarkably enhanced by PM6. Attributed to the intrinsic distinctions of π–π stacking for the two acceptors, a smaller π–π distance of 3.39 Å was calculated for the PM6:WA1 blend, relative to that of 3.45 Å for the PM6:IT-4F blend (Fig. 5j). This smaller π–π distance would accelerate the charge transport in pure domains and is consistent with the high and balanced hole/electron mobilities in the PM6:WA1 cell. However, the PM6:WA2 blend affords different molecular orientations, specifically, fairly disordered molecular stacking with mixed face-on and edge-on orientations (Fig. 5i), similar to the profiles of the neat WA2 film (Fig. 2f). Besides, the blend produces a weak π–π stacking in the OOP direction at a small Qz = 1.75 Å−1 and corresponds to a large π–π distance of 3.59 Å, which comes from the intermolecular stacking of PM6 instead of the acceptor. This indicates that the face-on orientation of PM6 was indeed disturbed by mixing the nondirectional WA2 molecules. Likewise, the π–π packing of WA2 molecules is weakened given the low diffraction signal at Qz ∼ 1.83 Å−1. Obviously, the excessively disordered molecular orientations in PM6:WA2 are disadvantageous to the vertical transport of free charges in solar cells, giving rise to inferior charge mobilities and photoelectronic conversion properties.

Considering the appropriate energy offset and absorption profile of WA1 relative to the typical acceptor Y6, we further fabricated PM6:Y6:WA1 TOSCs with WA1 as the guest component. As generally acknowledged, there are three common working mechanisms in ternary systems, including charge transfer, energy transfer and parallel-linkage mechanisms.44–46 The energy level of PDINO is extracted from a previous study.47 Specifically in the PM6:Y6:WA1 system, WA1 and Y6 share almost the same HOMO energy level (Fig. 6a and S10†); therefore, it is hardly possible to generate charge transfer between them. This can be further supported by the J–V measurements of photovoltaic devices containing acceptors only, where the JSC of the acceptor blend (Y6:WA1) falls in between those of the singe acceptors of Y6 and WA1 (Fig. S11†). Besides, the PL spectrum of WA1, which is fully covered by the broad absorption of Y6 (Fig. 6b), indicates a potential Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process from WA1 to Y6, where WA1 functions as an additional light absorber and transfer its photoinduced excited states to Y6. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were further conducted to probe the exciton dynamics in neat Y6 and Y6/WA1 blends. As shown in Fig. 6c, it is evident that the Y6/WA1 blend film gives rise to a much steady decay process with the fluorescence lifetime (τ) calculated to be 0.58 ns, greater than the τ of 0.34 ns in the Y6 film. This result suggests a longer exciton diffusion length in the host/guest acceptor blend, conducive to suppressing geminate recombination loss for greater photocurrent.48,49 Moreover, the well-complementary absorption spectra of Y6 and WA1 could maximize photon utilization in the full spectra of ternary blends, which helps to generate enhanced photocurrent in the resultant ternary devices.

Owing to the high content of Y6 in the optimal PM6:Y6 (1:1.2, w/w) binary system, the ternary active layer was fabricated with a small fraction of extra WA1 (PM6:Y6:WA1 = 1:1.2:0.2, w/w). Chloroform and chloronaphthalene (0.5%, v/v) were employed as the processing solvent and additive, respectively. The optimal conditions of ternary cells follow the PM6:Y6 binary devices according to previous literature.8,50,51 As Fig. 6d reveals, the PM6:Y6 control device delivers an optimal PCE of 17.09%, with a VOC of 0.849 V, JSC of 26.70 mA cm−2 and FF of 75.42%. Impressively, the ternary solar cells show a boosted PCE of up to 18.15%, with a collectively improved VOC of 0.870 V and JSC of 27.68 mA cm−2, accompanied by a decent FF of 75.36%. The close FFs in optimal PM6:Y6 and ternary cells may suggest comparable charge transport/recombination properties, which is commendable given the rotatable σ-bond linked π-bridges in the WA1 molecular structure. The impressive JSC in the PM6:Y6:WA1 ternary cell should be benefitting from the well-matched absorption features of Y6 and WA1, as well as the efficient energy transfer between them. As a consequence, the ternary cell shows a strong and flat EQE profile between 450 and 820 nm with a response greater than 80%, affording an integrated JSC of 26.80 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6e). In comparison, there are two distinct valleys at around 500 nm and 750 nm in the EQE plot of the PM6:Y6 binary device, giving a relatively smaller integrated JSC of 26.07 mA cm−2. Encouragingly, the TOSC exactly fills these gaps, promoted by the well complementary light-harvesting behaviors and prolonged exciton diffusion length. As a classical acceptor, Y6 has been frequently employed as the host acceptor to design TOSCs, and great progress has been made. As Fig. 6f and Table S3† suggest, the efficiency of the PM6:Y6:WA1 ternary device should be one of the highest values among Y6 based ternary solar cells so far. It is worth noting that, as for the Y6 and its analogs (eC9, L8-BO etc.) based high efficiency TOSCs (PCE ≥ 17%), all the guest acceptors belong to fully fused-ring molecules, including the A–D–A and A–DA′D–A type acceptors with high molecular planarity and decent molecular assemblies for efficient charge transport. However, as for guest acceptors with rotatable σ-bond linked π-bridges, most of the TOSCs steer clear of them. It is fairly inspiring that the ternary cells based on PM6:Y6:WA1 should be the first example with a high PCE of over 17% featuring a π-bridged guest acceptor. In comparison, we also tested the ternary cell of PM6:Y6:WA2 under identical conditions, which offers a lower PCE of 15.38%, with a VOC of 0.853 V, JSC of 24.61 mA cm−2 and FF of 73.25% (Fig. S12†). Therefore, this study further discloses the great potential of a π-bridged acceptor as an efficient guest acceptor to construct state-of-the-art TOSCs, in the premise of rationally regulating π-bridges.
Conclusions
In summary, based on an A–D–A type acceptor LA1-4F attached by phenylalkyl side chains, we have successfully reported two new π-bridged acceptors WA1 and WA2, with unilateral and bilateral alkylthio thiophene π-bridges, respectively. The results show that the unilateral π-bridge in WA1 exerts a positive optimization effect on molecular assembly and charge transport, while the bilateral modification triggers opposite results in WA2 with rather disordered stacking orientations and low charge mobility. Notably, the PM6:WA1 device exhibits a high PCE of up to 15.45% with a high FF of up to 79.31%, both of them far exceed those of the PM6:WA2 device (PCE = 9.17% and FF = 67.71%) and rank among the best values of OSCs with π-bridged acceptors. With WA1 as the guest acceptor, the TOSC of PM6:Y6:WA1 further shows a notable PCE of up to 18.15% with a VOC of 0.870 V and JSC of 27.68 mA cm−2 and a decent FF of 75.36%. It is highlighted that the efficiency of PM6:Y6:WA1 should be the highest and this is the first report of a high performance TOSC (PCE ≥ 17%) featuring a π-bridged guest acceptor. Thus, this study sheds light on the rational utilization of π-bridges to generate high performance OSCs, competitive with typical rigid A–D–A and A–DA′D–A structural small molecule acceptors.
