Traditionally, isoprene is obtained from crude oil during the refinery process. Nevertheless, plants and animals are also able to synthesize this important compound. This work compares two renewable approaches for isoprene production: by photosynthetic organisms (autotrophic microalgae/cyanobacteria) and by heterotrophic organisms (bacteria). These are two alternative pathways for the conventional isoprene production obtained from the petrochemical-based refinery process, which were assessed in this work using green metrics. Their performance was evaluated in terms of: material efficiency, energy efficiency, economic evaluation and land use. A 10-tonne scale was chosen to perform the green metrics evaluation for both biological processes leading to isoprene. For each process, a comparison was made between a scenario considering the highest isoprene produced reported in the literature and a scenario considering the maximum theoretical stoichiometric isoprene productivity.IntroductionIsoprene (C5H8, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) is a key intermediate compound for the production of synthetic rubber and adhesives, including car and truck tires. It is also an important polymer building block for the chemical industry, such as for a wide variety of elastomers used in surgical gloves, rubber bands, golf balls, and shoes.1 Isoprene can also be converted into advanced fuels to be used as gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel supplements.2,3 The total annual amount of isoprene collectively released into the atmosphere by plants is approximately 500 million tonnes.4 This amount would be enough to manufacture 60 billion car and truck tires, which is 50 times the current global production.4 Nevertheless, the collection of the isoprene released by plants and animals for commercial applications is economically unfeasible and therefore the current commercial production routes of isoprene are based on the refinery conversion of petrochemical feedstocks. The global industrial production of synthetic isoprene from petrochemical feedstocks is around 1 million tonnes per year; however, about 20000 metric tonnes of naphtha cracker are also produced.4Today, the pressure on fossil fuels and chemicals and the environmental concerns related to global warming have increased the need for the production of chemicals such as isoprene from renewable sources. The production of fuels and chemicals from renewable sources with minimal environmental impact offers the promise of closing the “energy gap” between the global supply and demand. It also helps to mitigate the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.Isoprene can be of natural origin metabolised by several organisms5 such as animals, plants (including macro- and microalgae), fungi and bacteria.6 In particular, two pathways have been identified for the biosynthesis of isoprene: the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) and plastidial 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) pathways.7 For the algae process the carbon partition to isoprene is able to go only through the DOXP pathway while bacteria are able to produce isoprene both through the DOXP and the MVA pathway through genetic modification.8,9The photosynthetic pathway of isoprene production has been well studied, and it has been shown to be uncommon and not genus specific. Several factors influence the plants’ isoprene production, such as light, leaf development, and temperature, and this production can represent up to 2% of the plant's fixed carbon.10 On the other hand the culture of photosynthetic microalgae might not require either arable land or potable water. The schematic production cycle of isoprene is presented in Fig. 1. Isoprene can be produced from one of the possible pathways of carbon partitioning after the Calvin–Benson cycle.2 Fig. 1  Carbon partitioning leading to the generation of sugars, terpenoids and fatty acids. This carbon partition allows the renewable production of volatile isoprene in the presence of sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) through the terpenoid pathways presented in Fig. 1. The isoprene can also be produced by different bacteria (both Gram-negative and Gram-positive) under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and using a carbon source (e.g. glucose). Among the different genera examined, Bacillus seems to be the best isoprene producer.11,12 Furthermore, the presented data show that under different fermentation conditions the production of isoprene is possible in both exponential and stationary phases of cell growth. Recently, Yang et al. reported on isoprene biosynthesis by a genetically engineered bacterial strain, obtained by co-expressing an optimized MVA pathway and the isoprene synthase (IspSPa) (from the higher plant Populus alba) on Escherichia coli.8 This recombinant strain allowed an accumulation of isoprene up to 6.3 g L−1 under 40 h of fed-batch fermentation. Danisco USA Inc. together with Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company patented the isoprene production method, using Bacillus bacteria. A modified strain achieves an isoprene production yield from glucose of 8.9% at 40 h or even 10.7% at 59 h.13The literature describes dozens of factors of green metrics that can be used to characterise “how green” the process is. However, the most commonly used metrics for the process evaluation are energetic efficiency, atom economy, environmental-factor (E-factor), economic efficiency, carbon efficiency, greenhouse gas emission, total land use, capital intensity, etc.14In the present work, two different biological routes are assessed and compared: (i) isoprene production by photosynthetic organisms (autotrophic microalgae/cyanobacteria) and (ii) isoprene production by heterotrophic organisms (bacteria). Two scenarios were studied for each pathway: a real scenario considering the productivities obtained by the literature data and a theoretical scenario considering the stoichiometric isoprene productivities. Green metrics was the methodology used to measure the efficiency of each proposed pathway using material efficiency, total energy input, economic evaluation and land use.MethodologyTwo isoprene production pathways were evaluated and compared using green metrics. Following the recommendations of the UBIOCHEM CM0903 COST Action, the green metric factors used in this work for isoprene production were: material efficiency, total energy input, economics (capital costs + raw material costs) and land use. The green metric calculations were performed using data taken from Acien et al.15 and Yang et al.8 for the microalgal and bacterial pathways, respectively, as well as modelled using SuperPro Designer software (Intelligen Inc., USA).16Two scenarios were considered for both the microalgal and bacterial isoprene production pathways. The first scenario is the real production of isoprene reported in the aforementioned papers, assuming the productivities and conditions obtained with the currently available literature. The second scenario reflects a theoretical situation considering the maximum productivity that can be obtained by stoichiometric carbon conversion.All the considered scenarios were modelled for a 300-day year base isoprene production process and for a 10-tonne per year scale of isoprene production.Isoprene production by microalgaeThe isoprene production by microalgae takes place in several unit operations such as the cultivation of microalgal biomass and isoprene production, harvesting and dewatering of biomass and isoprene separation from the photoreactor gas stream.The data used for the green metrics calculations of the microalgal production pathway were collected from Acien et al.,15 which describe a microalgal biomass production facility located in Almería (Spain). Isoprene separation from the gaseous stream leaving the reactors was modelled using SuperPro Designer16 using condensation of the mix gas with CaCl2 brine at −30 °C as a cooling agent. The complete production process lasted 10 h and one batch per day was considered.15The maximum productivity of isoprene from microalgae reported in the literature and used in this work was 1.9 × 10−8 mol (gdry weight of algae day)−1, found for Emiliania huxleyi.17Emiliania huxleyi is microalga which is largely found in ocean subarctic waters. The cultivation conditions and culture medium composition for this microalgae were therefore assumed to be similar to the ones reported by Acien et al.15 However, the amount of chloride salt in the culture medium was assumed to be the same as that present in ocean water (35‰) for the calculations of material efficiency and E-factor. For the theoretical scenario, the culture nutrient demand was assumed to be proportional to the higher biomass productivity15 which corresponded to a nutrient excess of about 34%. The possibility of recycling this excess (back to the photobioreactor at the beginning of each batch) was also considered in the calculations. In this case, the amount of nutrients added in each batch corresponds only to the amount consumed during the microalgae cultivation.Microalgal biomass is a valuable product with applications in the food, feed, energy, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.18 Therefore, for the calculation of the material and economic efficiencies, microalgal biomass was also considered as a product together with isoprene.Furthermore, for the material efficiency calculations, it was considered that glucose was 90% (on average) of the carbohydrate which in turn was 48.8% of the total microalgal biomass.19The climatic conditions are very important for the microalgae cultivation; however, the conditions in Almería are not significantly different from those of Portugal. Therefore the Portuguese electricity mix data (59% of energy was from renewable resources in 2012)20 were used in this work.Isoprene production by bacteriaFor the bacterial pathway considered in this study, isoprene is produced under fed-batch fermentation over 40 h which allows for the production of 180 batches per year. Fig. 2 presents the bacterial process analysed in this work and modelled in SuperPro Designer,16 including the isoprene separation process by condensation as described for the microalgal pathway. Fig. 2  The bacterial isoprene production process simulation using SuperPro Designer.16 Bacteria metabolise a carbon source (e.g. glucose) and convert it to isoprene resulting in a theoretical yield of 25.2%. For the real scenario a yield of 7% of isoprene from glucose was considered according to the findings of Yang et al. (2012).8 The data for the bacteria culture medium composition were collected from Yang et al. (2012).8 Similar to the microalgal process, a nutrient excess of 34% was considered for the calculations and the possibility of nutrient recirculation was also evaluated.Additionally, the bacterial biomass produced has a lower added value, compared to the microalgal biomass, and can be used as a raw material for energy purposes21,22 and therefore, their use as a co-product was also evaluated.Green metricsOne of the simplest ways to assess the greenness (regarding waste production) of a process is the E (environmental)-factor.23 The E-factor is defined as: (1)Thus the material efficiency based on the E-factor can be given as: (2)Energy efficiency is one of the major concerns for all chemical processes and the assessment of the energy balance is compulsory for current and new processes. The energy efficiency can be determined by the following: (3)or considering only the non-renewable energy sources that are required for the production (energy needed for the equipment and agricultural input) and the energy outputs in products, the energy efficiency can be represented as follows: (4)The energetic efficiency calculations were performed considering all the energy inputs during the isoprene production, which includes the energy requirements for the process equipment, utilities, fossil energy input resulting from nutrient production and cooling of the CaCl2 brine (used as a cooling agent in the isoprene separation). Table 1 depicts all the energy inputs used for this calculation, including the energy accumulated in the products (isoprene and (bacterial and microalgal) biomass high heating value – HHV). The other missing data required for the energetic evaluation (such as energetic demands for the equipment) were obtained from the process simulation performed in SuperPro Designer16 and from Acien et al.15

The economic efficiency of the processes was evaluated to give the cost of 1 tonne of product (isoprene). For both bacterial and microalgal pathways the depreciation and direct production costs were considered as presented in the literature15 and obtained from SuperPro Designer.16 Depreciation includes not only the amortization of the fixed capital, which is a function of the equipment and facility lifetime (ten years were considered for depreciation, in this work), but also the property tax, insurance and the purchase tax. The direct production costs include raw materials, utilities, labour and others (supervision, maintenance, tax, contingency, etc.). The raw materials and utilities (water, electricity and CaCl2 brine) were calculated from the mass balances. Labour includes the manpower necessary for the correct operation of the process and the general costs of supervision and management, in addition to maintenance, taxes, and a small contingency.Furthermore, in the utility cost, CaCl2 brine for the condenser, power consumption and the costs of the isoprene condensation unit were included according to data obtained from the SuperPro Designer simulation.16 For the comparison of both processes, the utility and nutrient costs were maintained equal in both processes.15,25Table 1 shows the cost inputs used in the calculations.The exponential law determined by the following equation: (5)was applied for the scaling up of the microalgal process (from 2.8 tonnes to 10 tonnes). This law allows us to ascertain the production costs of the isoprene with the microalgal biomass co-production, by modifying the cost of the major equipment according to the scale chosen.Lastly, the land used in the production of isoprene was also calculated. The purpose of this metric is to identify the need for arable land for the production of isoprene from renewable sources.Glucose is industrially produced from starch that can be extracted from corn (72% of starch in corn grain).35 In addition, the conversion of starch to glucose is characterised by a factor of 1.11 kgglucose kgstarch−1.35 In this work, the arable land in the Alentejo region in Portugal was chosen for the calculation of land used for the production of isoprene (for the bacterial pathway). Alentejo is characterised by the intensive production of corn which is 1/3 of the overall Portuguese corn production.36 The productivity of corn in the Alentejo region is 12 tonnes year−1.37Results and discussionThe literature review shows that among several microalgae tested Emiliania huxleyi exhibits the highest productivity of isoprene, although it is still negligible as it is only 1.9 × 10−8 mol (gdry weight of algae day)−1. The dramatically lower productivity of isoprene by microalgae compared to e.g. oak or spruce (0.5–2% of C fixation rate) might be explained by the carbon leak as opposed to a functional (isoprene) release.17 The microalgal biomass production depends on various factors, with the most important ones being the light (intensity and regime) and the presence of CO2. The production of isoprene by microalgae can be simply described by the following equation: CO2 + H2O + 9.5 hϑ → 1/6 (C6H12O6)(glucose) + O238(6)and (7)considering the complete C partition through the terpenoid pathway as demonstrated in Fig. 1. Consequently, the efficiency of the CO2 fixation by the biomass is 68.2% (relation between 1/6 of glucose and 1 CO2). According to Hanson et al.,39 isoprene is produced during the light periods according to the equation presented above. The second reaction, conversion of glucose to isoprene, demonstrates the theoretical efficiency of 100 mol% conversion or 0.454 gisoprene gglucose−1. Consequently, the overall theoretical efficiency of the process from the CO2 fixation to the production of isoprene is 0.310 gisoprene gCO2−1.After 40 h of fed-batch reaction, bacteria with the modified strain YJM25 of Escherichia coli containing also the optimized MVA pathway and isoprene synthase from Populus alba can accumulate isoprene up to 6.3 g L−1.8 As was presented before, the theoretical conversion rate of the C source (glucose) to isoprene is 25.2% of the initial mass of glucose according to the following equation: 1.5C6H12O6 + 2NADPH + 6NAD+ → C5H8 + 4CO2 + 6NADH + 2NADP+ + H2O + 4[H]8(8)Material efficiencyTables 2 and 3 present the data used for the calculation of the E-factor and the material efficiency for the real and theoretical microalgal and bacterial processes, respectively, assuming biomass as a waste or as a product.

Considering the microalgal biomass as a co-product, the results obtained for the real case are significantly more promising, although still much lower than the E-factor for pharmaceuticals or even lower than for bulk commodities.23,40 This level of isoprene productivity could be obtained through the present production units. Nevertheless, the research on microalgal production processes is still evolving and higher productivities are envisaged to be achieved in the future. Therefore, the theoretical scenario is considered to anticipate future increases in the productivity. Considering the aforementioned assumptions, the results obtained for the material efficiency are much more optimistic than those for a real scenario, as the E-factor for the entire process with a media recirculation varying from 0.006 to 6.71, depending on whether the microalgal biomass is considered as a co-product and whether recirculation of the culture media occurs or not. The material efficiency also gives significantly better results and varies from 0.12 to 0.98 for the theoretical scenario.The analysis data are presented in Table 3 for the bacterial pathway (Escherichia coli) of the isoprene production. It can be stated that the bacterial process is more material efficient than the microalgal process.The real experimental values allow an E-factor result in the range of 0.0014–4.50. This range depends on the bacterial biomass produced that can be considered as a co-product of the isoprene production process and also on whether the recirculation of the culture medium is considered or not. A nutrient excess of (inputculture media)/(excessculture media) ratio – 34% – was considered for the bacterial process which is identical to the one for the microalgae. This large surplus of nutrients and some C source excess were considered for the recirculation scenario. Taking into account the presented assumptions, the E-factor and the material efficiency values obtained in this work are similar to the values for bulky compounds.23,40Total energy efficiencyThe total energy efficiency, as well as the further studied metric factors such as economic efficiency and land use, is production scale dependent. The minimum scale of isoprene production which is necessary for the comparison of both processes has been arbitrarily determined to be 10 tonnes annually. Consequently, all the equipment and production facilities were scaled to a production of 10 tonnes year−1 of isoprene.For the microalgae real scenario, due to the extremely low productivity, the number of installation units needed to achieve the 10 tonnes of isoprene would be higher than 2000, making this process economically and technically unfeasible. Therefore to be able to provide a comparison with the bacterial process of isoprene production, further analysis was considered for the theoretical scenario. In this case, the number of production units needed to achieve 10 tonnes annually is 3.6, making this analysis more representative.Therefore considering the aforementioned assumptions, the energetic balance of the theoretical isoprene production by microalgae is presented in Table 4 and Fig. 3. Fig. 3  The energy input (left graph) and output (right graph) of the theoretical microalgal isoprene production. The nutrient output for better clarity was omitted due to its negligible value (0.152 MWh year−1).

The remaining energy must be delivered from the electricity mix. 59% of the Portuguese electricity mix in 2012 is obtained from renewable resources20 and therefore for the isoprene production by microalgae only less than 15% of the energy demand for isoprene production is from fossil fuel sources. The energy required for producing 10 tonnes of product per year, considering all energy inputs, is 431.4 MWh tonne−1 and this is only, considering the fossil energy inputs from electricity, 157.0 MWh tonne−1.Furthermore, the data obtained allow for the calculation of the energy efficiency as determined above which can be as high as 13.8%. However, considering only fossil fuel inputs to the system (energy consumption for equipment and agricultural input) and the energy outputs in terms of the product form, an energy efficiency as high as 38.1% is achieved.In the case of bacteria, the real scenario, with and without recirculation of the culture medium, was evaluated and the results obtained are presented in Table 5 and Fig. 4.

For the energy balance the drying process of bacteria biomass produced was considered (as an additional energy input) and the energy from combustion was considered as an additional output/co-product (represented by HHV of bacteria). The data obtained demonstrate that the energy demand for the production of isoprene with bacteria is significantly lower than that for the case of microalgae. Furthermore, the total energy input for producing 10 tonnes of product per year without and with recirculation of the culture medium is 120.6 MWh tonne−1 and 113.2 MWh tonne−1, respectively. Moreover, the data obtained allow for the calculation of the energy efficiency as defined above and the energy efficiency for scenarios without and with recirculation of the culture medium are as high as 41% and 43%, respectively.In the case of the theoretical scenario without and with recirculation of the culture medium the data obtained are shown in Table 6 and Fig. 5.

The energy efficiency gives values as high as 69% and 75% for both analysed cases. Consequently, it can be stated that more than 2/3 of the energy introduced in the bacterial process is converted into products (mainly isoprene and biomass).In summary, it can be concluded that the bacterial process considered in this work is energetically more efficient than the microalgal one. Furthermore, the recirculation of the culture medium acts positively on the energy balance of the process reducing the energy demands by 6%, mainly for nutrients and glucose with minimal counterbalance in the energy requirements for the operation of the equipment.Economic evaluationThe costs of both the microalgal and bacterial processes were analysed.

The investment cost represented by the depreciation is the second major part of the cost breakdown with a 30% share. Utilities and raw materials are minor in the whole process as they only represent 5% of the total cost. The absolute data values presented in Fig. 6 are shown in Table 7 which show the costs and revenues for microalgal isoprene production.The revenues from selling the biomass produced at a price of 36€ kg−126 allowed for a profit of 58.3 k€ tonne−1. In other words, the co-production of the microalgal biomass guarantees profitability of the venture, allowing additional benefits to be achieved from isoprene vending without the market price constraints.It is important to mention that further cost optimisation could be performed without compromising the biomass and isoprene production. Potential savings could be achieved by a complex automatisation of the production process, which would lead to a significant reduction in the labour cost which is a major portion of the overall costs. Following the recommendation of Acien et al.,15 the labour cost can be reduced to 1 men ha−1 or even less. This would lead to a dramatic reduction in the overall costs with only a partial increase in the additional investment for automatisation. Other potential cost reductions might be the use of combustion gases (source of CO2) from e.g. a power station41 and/or wastewater (source of nutrients).42 This would also reduce the cost of raw materials as combustion gases and/or wastewater could be obtained at no cost. However, before considering this beneficial process optimisation further, studies are necessary to evaluate the effects of such optimisation on the isoprene and/or biomass productivity and quality. The economic evaluation of the isoprene production for the bacterial process is presented in Table 8 and Fig. 7.The analysis of both the real and theoretical scenarios for isoprene production by Escherichia coli reveals that the cost of labour and other associated costs are a major part of the overall process cost which varies from 46 to 54%, respectively. An interesting fact is that the raw materials (glucose, culture medium) used in the bacterial process are significantly more expensive than those used in the microalgal isoprene production. However, considering both processes, this is evident as microalgae require CO2 and nutrients while for the bacterial process, the great part of the cost is glucose which is more expensive than the substrates used for the microalgal isoprene production. The recirculation of the culture medium also allows for a reduction in the raw material cost although this reduction is insignificant compared to the other costs. This low reduction in cost can be explained by the fact that there is a need for additional investment (e.g. recirculation pump) and higher labour costs for the recirculation of the culture medium to occur.Analysing the data presented in Table 8, it can be concluded that although savings on nutrients and C source are noticeable for the recirculation of the culture medium, the investment and labour costs are higher than these savings. This means that the recirculation of the culture medium, although required for material and energy savings, decreases the overall economic efficiency of the process.It is worth mentioning that even the theoretical production of isoprene by microalgae is very low for commercial proposes. However, the market value of microalgae biomass can make the processes economically feasible, but in this case the production of isoprene would represent a minor co-product with low impact on the market when compared with the other high-value compounds.Contrary to the microalgal process, the isoprene produced by the bacteria for the analysed 10 tonnes year−1 scale costs at least 53.8 k€ tonne−1. Since the current market price of bioisoprene is 2–3.4 k€ tonne−1,43 the proposed processes are not economically viable. Therefore, the proposed process is definitively unrealistic; however, it must be underlined that the main goal of this work was to compare these two technologies and to prove the use of the concept of green metrics.The way to reduce the isoprene cost is to increase the scale of the production as well as to optimise the costs of the analysed processes. A potential alternative for cost reduction, similar to what was proposed for the microalgal process, is the use of more extensive process automatisation. This would significantly reduce the labour costs and partially increase the capital cost. A large scale production of isoprene and a significant increase in the glucose demand would open the possibility for a price negotiation of C-source which would positively influence the economic efficiency of the process.Land useIn general, the microalgal processes are characterised by no arable land requirements as the only raw materials used are CO2 and nutrients which in the ideal case can even be taken from other facilities such as e.g. waste streams. From this perspective, microalgal facilities are very beneficial because they can also be constructed on marginal, degraded or low cost lands.44 Therefore, the algae processes are an intriguing alternative to the classical agriculture based technologies from a land use point of view.The bacterial process requires glucose which must be obtained from the agriculture crops. This first generation fermentable sugar can be obtained from corn through starch. To obtain a rate of 10 tonnes of isoprene production annually, 8.0 and 2.2 ha of corn plantation for real and theoretical isoprene productions are needed.In conclusion, the metric results obtained for microalgal and bacterial isoprene production pathways for both the real and theoretical scenarios are shown in Table 9.

The study was performed based on the microalgal and bacterial processes of isoprene production, and two real and theoretical scenarios were considered for both. Based on the resulting data, it can be clearly stated that from the material efficiency and economic point of view the 10 tonne production scale of isoprene is more attractive for the theoretical microalgal isoprene production process. However, from a practical point of view the realistic scenario of isoprene production (obtained from the best isoprene productivities available in the literature) by Escherichia coli seems to be an alternative to the conventional petrochemical based process. This is considering the aforementioned aspects of process scale up and cost optimisation which leads to the reduction of isoprene production cost and makes the process economically feasible/viable.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the European Commission through financing the COST CM0903 Action UBIOCHEM “Utilisation of Biomass for Sustainable Fuels & Chemicals” and the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT, Portugal) through projects of Cooperação Científica e Tecnológica FCT/Polónia – 2013/2014, “Green metrics” em bioenergia”, PTDC/PTDC/AAC-AMB/100354/2008 Microalgae as a sustainable raw material for biofuel production (biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-H2 and biogas) and FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-013935 SIMBIOALGA New symbiotic approach for a truly sustainable integrated microalgae production directed to a biorefinery platform.
