    , Accepted 16th January 2022First published on 20th January 2022AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites are unstable under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. To solve this profound issue, an all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite device is used as the top cell to overcome the ultraviolet light instability of the FAPbI3 photovoltaic device (bottom cell). The inorganic CsPbBr3 layer is prepared via an advanced nucleation process to decrease the Gibbs free energy, resulting in more nuclei as well as a dense layer. The prepared CsPbBr3 layer acts as a UV filter to avoid the problem of UV light instability on the bottom cell. When the dense CsPbBr3 layer acts as a top cell in the 4-terminal tandem device, the FAPbI3 based bottom cell exhibits excellent stability during the UV test.
Introduction
Organolead triiodide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received significant attention owing to their fascinating optoelectronic properties.1,2 Despite the rapid progress in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) associated with the development of fabrication techniques, the instability of organolead triiodide PSCs still remains challenging.3–5 Moisture, heat and ultraviolet (UV) light have significant influences on the stability of hybrid perovskites. Hence, investigating photovoltaic materials with high stability is promising to promote the commercial applications of these materials.6,7
Recently, the inorganic perovskite material of CsPbBr3 has attracted much attention in perovskite solar cells due to its superior stability.8–11 Different from the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, the all-organic CsPbBr3 device displayed negligible degradation after exposure to extreme humid air for more than 3 months. Additionally, CsPbBr3 with a large bandgap of 2.3 eV can act as a promising top cell in the four-terminal tandem device to enhance the UV stability of the bottom cell.12,13
So far, the CsPbBr3 layer has been deposited through the reaction of PbBr2 and CsBr at room temperature.8,14 The solution-processed prepared CsPbBr3 is significantly constrained by the different solubilities between CsBr and PbBr2 in common solvents. The film, based on equimolar CsBr–PbBr2 solution, shows many uncovered pin-hole areas between CsPbBr3 grains.15 This structure arose from the slow nucleation rate of CsPbBr3 during natural drying and rapid crystallization. Incidentally, the few nuclei on the surface lead to a larger crystal grain size with the disadvantage that shunting pathways (pin-holes and trap sites) are left between the grains.16 Antisolvent dripping has been used to promote the nucleation rate of CsPbBr3 in the one-step process. Unfortunately, no evident improvement of perovskite layer quality can be observed through utilizing antisolvent drop-casting because of the too fast crystal growth rate of CsPbBr3.15,17 Thus, it is urgent to develop a facile film-processing technique that could accelerate the nucleation rate before the fast growth.
Here, we report an advanced nucleation method (ANM) that prepared highly pure and tight CsPbBr3 thin layers through two-step sequential deposition. The advanced perovskite seeds act as nuclei to facilitate crystallization during the formation of perovskite. By inducing advanced nucleation, the surface coverage of the prepared CsPbBr3 is drastically improved. This facile technique could produce CsPbBr3 solar cells with high reproducibility and applied in the construction of integrated photovoltaics.
Results and discussion
Generally, bulk CsPbBr3 is fabricated through the reaction of PbBr2 and CsBr via two-step methods.11 However, the quality enhancement of the CsPbBr3 film is significantly limited by the large difference in concentration between PbBr2 and CsBr solutions. The large concentration difference leads to a slow nucleation rate as well as many uncovered pin-hole areas between CsPbBr3 grains. Therefore, an advanced nucleation approach is presented in this paper to yield highly pure CsPbBr3 thin layers. As shown in Fig. 1, the solution of 1.0 M PbBr2 containing 0.1 M CsBr was spin-coated onto the prepared TiO2 films to facilitate advanced nucleation. Then a solution of 0.07 M CsBr is further spin-coated for two cycles. The final layers were then calcined to evaporate the redundant solvent. During the crystallization process, the advanced nucleation process can swift the nucleation rate and make the final layer more uniform.18

(d) The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the corresponding CsPbBr3 thin films. 
As shown in Fig. 1b, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the CsPbBr3 film based on PbBr2 without CsBr (control) shows numerous gaps between grain boundaries. Differently, the advanced nucleation method (ANM) enables CsPbBr3 layers with a remarkably dense coverage without any pinholes (Fig. 1c). The typical XRD patterns of the CsPbBr3 layers are shown in Fig. 1d, and both perovskite layers display a cubic crystal structure.11 This result demonstrates that the CsPbBr3 films based on ANM are high-purity phases. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks for the ANM CsPbB3 layer are stronger than those for the control CsPbB3 layer, implying a significantly improved crystallinity. This XRD result is consistent with the SEM images (Fig. 1b and c).
Once a nucleus forms on the substrate, the crystal would grow spontaneously.16 The perovskite film growth process is determined by the Gibbs free energy G1 (Fig. 1a). Otherwise, a higher energy is needed for overcoming the critical free energy G1. The high free energy G1 leads to less nuclei on the substrate as well as large gaps between perovskite grains (Fig. 2b and c).19 When the advanced nucleation method is used for preparing thin films, the early stage of CsPbBr3 has been formed through the reaction between PbBr2 and CsBr during crystal growth. Thus, the Gibbs free energy G2 is lower than that without advanced nuclei (Fig. 2d). More nuclei are easily formed on the substrate, resulting in a highly dense thin film (Fig. 2e and f).

Fig. 3a presents the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the CsPbBr3 films. The ANM CsPbBr3 film reveals an increased intensity than the control one, indicating less defect-induced charge recombination.20 The PL intensity map (Fig. 3b) of the control CsPbBr3 film shows a lower absolute intensity, consistent with the PL data in Fig. 3a. The nonuniformity of the PL map may be mainly attributed to the numerous pinholes in the control film.21 In contrast, a higher absolute intensity was observed for the ANM CsPbBr3 film (Fig. 3c), indicating a high-quality perovskite film with fewer defects.22 The time-resolved PL characterization was also carried out (Fig. 3d). The carrier lifetime of the ANM CsPbBr3 film is longer than that of the control one due to its lower trap density. The trap state densities were investigated by dark current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics. As shown in Fig. 3e and f, the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) values of control and ANM CsPbBr3 films are 0.732 V and 0.572 V, respectively. The decreased VTFL in the perovskite based on ANM is ascribed to its dense surface coverage.12,23

Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 layer. The annealed CsPbBr3 film has a uniform and dense surface, which makes it applicable in perovskite solar cells. The grain size in CsPbBr3 is about 1 μm, which could reduce the grain boundaries and non-radiative recombination.24 The SEM image of the cross-sectional structure of FTO/TO2/CsPbBr3/carbon is displayed in Fig. S1b (ESI†). The thickness of the prepared CsPbBr3 layer is about 500 nm, which indicates uniform deposition. Fig. S1c (ESI†) demonstrates the UV-vis spectra of CsPbBr3, showing that the wavelength of absorbed light by the CsPbBr3 layer is shorter than ∼540 nm. Here, the method proposed by Tandon and Gupta was adopted for evaluating the optical bandgap of CsPbBr3.25 The plots of (Ahv)2vs. photo-energy (hv) is shown in Fig. S1d (ESI†), implying that the bandgap of CsPbBr3 is about 2.3 eV. This bandgap makes it suitable to act as a UV filter to avoid the instability problem of the bottom cell.5 Fig. S1e (ESI†) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 layer prepared by the advanced nucleation method. The inset exhibits the cubic phase of the CsPbBr3 crystal structure which shows a tridimensional framework of PbBr6 connected with Cs+ cations.
Formamidinium based lead triiodide (FAPbI3) has attracted increasing attention due to its high carrier mobility and extended absorption spectrum (840 nm).26 However, the FAPbI3 based perovskite is extremely difficult to maintain stability under exposure to UV light.12 Fig. S2a (ESI†) shows the SEM image of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3 layer. The morphology of the FAPbI3 film is highly uniform and dense, which is fit for carrier transport. The large crystal grain sizes could enhance the performance of perovskite films.27 The grain boundaries between perovskite grains might lead to the presence of charge traps as well as charge recombination. The average grain size of FAPbI3 is about 1 μm, reducing the grain boundaries. Fig. S2b (ESI†) displays the SEM image of the cross-sectional structure of ITO/TO2/FAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The thickness of the prepared CsPbBr3 layer is about 300 nm with uniformity over a large area. Fig. S2c (ESI†) shows the UV-vis spectra of FAPbI3, indicating that the absorbance edge of the FAPbI3 layer is about 840 nm. The plots of (Ahv)2vs. photo-energy (hv) is shown in Fig. S2d (ESI†), implying that the optical bandgap of FAPbI3 is about 1.48 eV. These results reveal that the resulting layer is pure α-FAPbI3.28 Fig. S2e (ESI†) shows the XRD spectrum of the FAPbI3 layer prepared by a previously reported method, demonstrating high crystallinity with a cubic perovskite phase. The inset shows the cubic phase of the FAPbI3 crystal structure.29
The CsPbBr3 based device can be used as a UV filter for protecting the UV-light stability of organic solar cells.12,13 We ascribe this to its excellent photostability in the UV-light region. In addition, the FAPbI3 based PSC with a wide broad absorption of ∼840 nm could complement well the absorption of CsPbBr3 (300 nm to 530 nm). Hence, 4-terminal cells (the CsPbBr3-based device as the top cell and the FAPbI3-based device as the bottom cell) were designed for improving the ultraviolet stability of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, Fig. 4b and c shows the current–voltage curves and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the CsPbBr3 top cell and the filtered FAPbI3 cell. The concrete device parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The short-circuit current (Jsc) of the filtered FAPbI3-based bottom cell is expected to be reduced, which is attributed to the decreased light intensity. The integrated current values of the CsPbBr3 cell and the filtered FAPbI3-based bottom cell are 6.6 and 10.4 mA cm−2, respectively. The total PCE of the 4-terminal tandem cell is 16.4%. To further accurately evaluate the true photovoltaic performance of the 4-terminal cell, the statistical PCE and stabilized output of the typical device are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The statistical PCE along with Gaussian fitting is displayed in Fig. S3a (ESI†), and the 4-terminal cell displayed an average PCE of 14.1% over 20 devices. Moreover, a steady-state efficiency of 15.1% for the 4-terminal cell was achieved under continuous illumination (Fig. S3b, ESI†).

The UV-light stability of organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites is still a great challenge for commercialization.3 The unsealed top cell CsPbBr3 and the FAPbI3 based bottom cell (with and without the optical filter) were stored in a N2-filled glove box at room temperature under UV-light irradiation (365 nm, 100 mW cm−2). The FAPbI3-based device without the optical filter rapidly degraded under continuous UV-light irradiation within 20 hours. By contrast, the filtered FAPbI3 could retain above 95% of the initial PCE after 120 h of UV irradiation (Fig. 5). We ascribe this to the CsPbBr3-based top cell acting as a UV light filter, thus avoiding the UV illumination of the FAPbI3 based bottom cell. These results indicate that the CsPbBr3-based device could serve as the top cell of the four-terminal device and prevent the organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite layers from being damaged by UV light.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated an advanced nucleation method by introducing CsBr in PbBr2 solution and obtained tight CsPbBr3 thin layers through two-step sequential deposition. The introduced CsBr could accelerate the rate of nucleation through “advanced nucleation” before annealing. Furthermore, these perovskite seed crystals could promote the following perovskite growth. When the CsPbBr3 device acts as a UV filter in the four-terminal device, the UV stability of the filtered FAPbI3 based bottom cell is substantially improved.
