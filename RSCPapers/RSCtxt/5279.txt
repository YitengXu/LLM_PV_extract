    , Accepted 20th September 2015First published on 22nd September 2015AbstractElectrocatalytic water splitting to produce H2 plays an important role in the capture, conversion, and storage of renewable energy sources, such as solar energy and wind power. As the reductive half reaction of water splitting, H2 evolution reaction (HER) suffers from sluggish kinetics, and hence competent HER catalysts are needed. Despite being excellent HER catalysts, noble metal-based catalysts (i.e. Pt) are too expensive to be economically competitive. Therefore, low-cost catalysts composed of solely earth-abundant elements have attracted increasing attention these years, among which nickel-based HER catalysts, particularly nickel chalcogenides, are considered as promising candidates. Although many nickel chalcogenides, including NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2, have been reported for hydrogen evolution, their intrinsic catalytic activities have never been investigated and compared in detail under the same conditions. Most of the previous investigations were limited to only one species of nickel chalcogenides under very unique conditions, rendering a fair comparison of their HER activities impossible. Herein, we report the preparation and characterization of three crystalline nickel sulfides, NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2, with comparable crystal sizes and specific surface areas. Detailed electrochemical studies under strongly alkaline conditions coupled with theoretical computations were performed to probe their intrinsic HER activities, resulting in the order of Ni3S2 > NiS2 > NiS. The superior HER performance of Ni3S2 mainly stems from the combined effect of large electrochemically active surface area and high conductivity (metallic conductor vs. semiconductor).
Introduction
Water splitting with renewable energy input to produce H2 and O2 has been widely considered as a promising approach to alleviate our reliance on fossil fuels, match growing energy demands, and simultaneously satisfy increasingly stringent environmental regulations because of the clean nature of H2 as a fuel.1–3 Water splitting consists of two half reactions: H2 evolution reaction (HER) and O2 evolution reaction (OER), both of which are multi-electron/multi-proton transfer processes and require catalysts to proceed at appreciable rates.4 State-of-the-art HER catalysts are usually composed of noble metals, such as Pt, whose limited reserve and thus high cost limit their large-scale applications. Hence, there remains an urgent need to develop competent and earth-abundant HER catalysts prepared by low-cost methods.
Recent years have witnessed the emergence of a wide library of solid-state catalysts composed of earth-abundant elements, such as metal chalcogenides,5–7 carbides,8–13 borides,8 and alloys.14 First-row transition metals are also frequently reported with competent HER activities; noteworthy examples include metal sulfides,15,16 selenides,17,18 and phosphides.19,20 Due to their thermodynamic convenience and potential application in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, most of the reported HER catalysts were developed and investigated under strongly acidic conditions. The preparation of these catalysts typically requires toxic gas treatment at elevated temperature. To eventually realize overall water splitting catalysis, the integration of HER and OER catalysts in the same electrolyte is mandatory. Because the overpotential loss of OER in acidic electrolytes is much larger than that of HER in basic media and most OER catalysts are vulnerable in acidic electrolytes, our group is particularly interested in developing and understanding high-performance HER catalysts under alkaline conditions.21
Due to its terrestrial abundance and involvement in [NiFe] hydrogenases,22 nickel has long been sought as a promising candidate for HER catalysis. Indeed, a variety of nickel-based catalysts have emerged for electrocatalytic H2 production recently. Typical examples include nickel alloys,14,23 sulfides,24–26 selenides,27 oxides/hydroxides,28 and phosphides,29 among which nickel sulfides are one of the most investigated because of their low cost, facile preparation, and high catalytic activity. In fact, many nickel sulfide-based HER catalysts of different crystal structures have been reported for H2 evolution under acidic, neutral, or alkaline conditions. For instance, metal–organic framework-derived NiS nanoframes have been demonstrated as HER catalysts in 1.0 M KOH.25 Similarly, NiS2 of various nanostructures was reported to exhibit remarkable HER catalytic performance in strongly acidic electrolytes.30,31 Last year, our group reported an electrodeposited Ni–S film with active and robust HER activity not only in neutral buffer but also in natural water.32 A suite of characterization techniques, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, were conducted and the main composition of the Ni–S film was revealed to be Ni3S2.32 This was the first time that Ni3S2 was found to be a competent HER catalyst. Although the three main crystalline forms of nickel sulfides, NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2, have all been separately studied as HER catalysts, a fair comparison of their performance on an equal footing has been challenging because of the diverse conditions employed in the aforementioned and other related studies. In order to gain a deeper understanding of their intrinsic HER activities, it is necessary to examine them under the same conditions in order to build a composition–structure–performance relationship of nickel sulfides for the development of improved HER catalysts.
Herein, we report a facile and novel microwave-assisted preparation of three crystalline nickel sulfides, NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2. Various physical characterization techniques were conducted to confirm that their crystal sizes and specific surface areas are within the same magnitude. Detailed electrochemical studies under strongly alkaline conditions revealed that the HER catalytic performance of the three nickel sulfides followed this order: Ni3S2 > NiS2 > NiS. The highest HER activity of Ni3S2 is attributed to the combined effect of large electrochemically active surface area, high conductivity, and unique surface chemistry beneficial for water dissociation, which is a critical step for H2 evolution under strongly alkaline conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of the electrocatalytic HER performance of three crystalline nickel sulfides under strongly alkaline conditions.
Experimental section
Materials
Nickel acetate tetrahydrate, sulfur, oleylamine, Nafion solution (5 wt% in alcohols), and ethanol were all purchased from commercial vendors and used directly without any further purification. Water was deionized (18 MΩ) with a Barnstead E-Pure system.
Catalyst preparation
All three nickel sulfides were synthesized via a convenient microwave-assisted solvothermal method. In a typical synthesis of NiS, 1 mmol of nickel acetate and 10 mL of oleylamine were placed into a 35 mL microwave reactor tube, followed by sonication for at least 30 min until a clear blue solution was obtained. Subsequently, 1.5 mmol of sulfur powder was added to the solution and the resulting mixture was stirred until sulfur was dissolved completely. The mixture was microwave-heated at 260 °C for 10 min, followed by cooling down to room temperature gradually. The reaction mixture was centrifuged and the solid product was washed with a copious amount of ethanol to remove residual sulfur and solvents. The final product was dried and stored under vacuum. NiS2 and Ni3S2 were synthesized in a similar fashion, except that the added amounts of sulfur were adjusted to 10 and 0.7 mmol, respectively.
Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Miniflex II desktop X-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected using a FEI QUANTA FEG 650 (FEI, USA). Elemental analysis of nickel and sulfur was performed on a Thermo Electron iCAP inductively coupled plasma spectrophotometer. Surface area results were obtained by nitrogen sorption on an Autosorb iQ automated gas sorption analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments, USA). Before measurements, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 200 °C for 6 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was utilized to calculate the specific surface area. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses were conducted on a Kratos Axis Ultra instrument (Chestnut Ridge, NY). The samples were affixed on a stainless steel Kratos sample bar, loaded into the instrument's load lock chamber, and evacuated to 5 × 10−8 Torr before being transferred into the sample analysis chamber under ultrahigh vacuum conditions (~10−10 Torr). X-ray photoelectron spectra were taken using a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.7 eV) at a 300 × 700 μm spot size. Low-resolution survey and high-resolution region scans at the binding energies of interest were performed for each sample. To minimize charging, the samples were flooded with low-energy electrons and ions from the instrument's built-in charge neutralizer. The samples were first sputter cleaned inside the analysis chamber with 1 keV Ar+ ions for 30 seconds to remove adventitious contaminants and surface oxides. Data were analyzed using CasaXPS software, and energy corrections on the high-resolution scans were calibrated by referencing the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon to 284.5 eV.
Electrochemical measurements
For the electrochemical measurements of each catalyst, 4 mg of the catalyst was mixed with 1.16 mL of ethanol, 0.8 mL of water, and 0.04 mL of 5% Nafion solution. The mixture was sonicated for at least 30 min until a black homogeneous catalyst ink was obtained. 2.5 μL of the catalyst ink was deposited on the surface of a rotating disk glassy carbon electrode or a carbon paste electrode 4 times in order to obtain an electrode surface with even distribution of the catalyst. The catalyst-loaded electrode was dried and stored under vacuum at room temperature. Electrochemical experiments were performed on a Gamry Interface 1000 potentiostat workstation with a three-electrode cell system. A rotating disk glassy carbon electrode (d = 3 mm, S = 0.07065 cm2) coated with the nickel sulfide catalyst ink was used as the working electrode, a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) electrode (CH Instruments) as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. The reference electrode in aqueous media was calibrated with ferrocenecarboxylic acid whose Fe3+/2+ couple is +0.284 V vs. SCE. All potentials reported in the paper were converted to vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). iR (current times internal resistance) correction was applied for linear sweep voltammetry and controlled potential electrolysis experiments to account for the voltage drop between the reference and working electrodes using Gamry Framework™ Data Acquisition Software 6.11. The linear sweep voltammetry experiments were conducted in a N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 and a rotating speed of 2000 rpm. Electric impedance spectroscopy measurements in deaerated 1.0 M KOH were carried out in the same configuration at multiple potentials from 105 to 0.1 Hz with an AC potential amplitude of 30 mV. The durability of each catalyst for electrocatalytic H2 evolution in deaerated 1.0 M KOH was assessed via long-term controlled potential electrolysis at −0.377 V vs. RHE for 20 h. The working electrode used in long-term electrolysis was a home-made carbon paste electrode. 1 g of graphite powder and 0.25 g of white paraffin wax were loaded into a 25 mL round-bottom flask, followed by the addition of 5 mL of hot toluene and sonication for 5 min. The final conductive graphite powder was obtained by solvent removal under vacuum. The carbon paste electrode was made via pressing the carbon paste powder into the void cavity of a home-made electrode linked to a copper wire for alligator connection.
Theoretical computation methods
The theoretical computations of the three nickel sulfides were performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code.33 The ion–electron interaction is described with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.34 Electron exchange correlation is represented by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional of generalized gradient approximation (GGA).35 A cutoff energy of 450 eV was used for the plane-wave basis set. The convergence threshold for structural optimization was set to be 0.02 eV Å−1 in force. For geometry optimization, the Brillouin zone was sampled by a 7 × 7 × 7 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh, while a larger 19 × 19 × 19 k-point mesh was used for computing the density of states. To take into account the electronic correlation of Ni 3d electrons, a simple rotationally invariant DFT+U version was used,36 which has been successfully applied to many strongly correlated systems, including nickel oxides and transition metal sulfides with accurate prediction on the structural, magnetic, and surface properties. In this method, parameters U and J represent the on-site Coulomb interaction energy and exchange energy, respectively. For the calculations herein, U and J were fixed at 4.5 and 0.9 eV, respectively.
Results and discussion
There are two common forms of NiS: α-NiS and β-NiS. α-NiS adopts a hexagonal nickel arsenide structure (Fig. 1a), wherein each nickel atom is not only surrounded octahedrally by six sulfur atoms, but also approached fairly closely by two other nickel atoms, in which the Ni–Ni distance is ~2.68 Å, implying a considerable degree of metal–metal bonding. The second common nickel sulfide is cubic NiS2 of the pyrite structure (Fig. 1b), which contains discrete S2 units. The S–S distance of these S2 units is very close to that of a single S–S bond. This structure can be visualized as a distorted NaCl structure, where nickel atoms occupy the Na positions while S2 groups are positioned with their centers at the Cl positions. The heazlewoodite Ni3S2 crystallizes in a rhombohedral structure (Fig. 1c), in which each nickel atom sits at a pseudotetrahedral site in an approximately body-centered cubic sulfur lattice. The Ni3S2 units were interconnected by short Ni–S (2.29 Å) and Ni–Ni (2.53 Å) distances, leading to appreciable metal–metal bonding interaction between nickel atoms. The trigonal bipyramidal core of Ni3S2 is also highlighted in Fig. 1c. Despite the distinctive stoichiometry and structure, all these three nickel sulfides were reported to be active catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen production under various conditions.

By simply adjusting the molar ratios of the starting nickel and sulfur precursors in oleylamine via a microwave-assisted solvothermal method, we were able to obtain highly crystalline nickel sulfides of the three crystal structures, hexagonal NiS, cubic NiS2, and trigonal Ni3S2. The purity and crystallinity of these nickel sulfides were first confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of each nickel sulfide, NiS (JCPDS no. 02-1280), NiS2 (JCPDS no. 11-0099), and Ni3S2 (JCPDS no. 44-1418). No impurity peaks were observed in all the three XRD patterns. The sharp and narrow XRD peaks demonstrated the high crystallinity of each nickel sulfide. Based on the Scherrer equation and the most prominent XRD peak of each sample, the calculated crystal sizes of NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2 are 28.6, 25.7, and 55.2 nm, respectively. The morphology of each sample was revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As included in Fig. 1, the SEM images of all the three samples present globular-like nanoparticles with the particle size ranging from 20 to 60 nm, in good agreement with the XRD-derived crystal sizes. The specific surface area of each sample was measured by nitrogen sorption (Fig. S1†). The calculated specific surface areas based on the BET method are 47.6, 21.1, and 37.8 m2 g−1 for NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2, respectively. Elemental analysis was also performed to obtain the molar ratios of Ni:S as 0.51, 1.03, and 1.51 for NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2, respectively, which are highly consistent with the corresponding stoichiometric ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5. Finally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to probe the valence states of nickel and sulfur in each sample (Fig. 2). Fig. 2a compares the survey spectra of NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2. All the observed peaks can be assigned to anticipated elements, including Ni, S, and adventitious C. The O signal is likely to be due to the partial oxidation of nickel sulfides during sample preparation for XPS measurements. No other metal impurities were detected. The high-resolution Ni 2p spectra display peaks at 852.9 and 870.1 eV, corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 features, respectively.37 The essentially similar binding energies of the Ni 2p3/2 peaks of NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2 were well anticipated, since it is known that the process giving rise to the Ni 2p3/2 peak is mainly of metal character bearing little contribution from the sulfur atoms.37 Therefore, the nickel 2p3/2 peaks of nickel sulfides are very close in position to that of metallic nickel (852.5 ± 0.2 eV). The high-resolution S 2p region is shown in Fig. 2c. The analogous broad feature between 162 and 164 eV for all the three samples is essentially an overlap of the S 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks, consistent with the reported spectra of nickel sulfides.32 In summary, the aforementioned experimental results, including those of XRD, SEM, BET, ICP, and XPS, unambiguously demonstrate that the three crystalline nanoparticles, NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2, have been synthesized successfully. The nanoparticle sizes and specific surface areas are within the same magnitude for all the three nickel sulfides which also bear similar globular morphologies.

The electrocatalytic HER performance of the three nickel sulfides was first evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in an alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH). A typical three-electrode configuration was utilized, where the working electrode was prepared by drop casting each catalyst ink onto the surface of a rotating disk glassy carbon electrode with a loading amount of 0.283 mg cm−2. Fig. 3 compares the LSV curves of NiS, NiS2 and Ni3S2 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 and a rotation speed of 2000 rpm. It's worth noting that the rotation rate varied between 1200 and 2400 rpm for each sample and a negligible difference was obtained (Fig. S2†). As shown in Fig. 3a, all three samples enabled electrocatalytic H2 evolution under negative bias, but there was a marked difference in performance. It is apparent that Ni3S2 exhibited the smallest onset potential and was able to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential (η) of −335 mV. The activities of NiS2 and NiS followed that of Ni3S2, achieving 10 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of −454 and −474 mV, respectively. The corresponding Tafel plots of these three catalysts are shown in Fig. 3b–d. Linear fitting of all the Tafel plots brought about the Tafel slopes of 124, 128, and 97 mV per decade for NiS, NiS2 and Ni3S2, respectively.

The green dashed lines are the linear fittings. 
Besides the catalytic onset and Tafel slope, another crucial factor in the evaluation of an electrocatalyst is its stability under long-term working conditions. Thus, controlled potential electrolysis was subsequently conducted to assess the robustness of NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2 for HER catalysis in 1 M KOH (Fig. 4). At an applied potential of −0.377 V vs. RHE, all the three nickel sulfides exhibited a stable cathodic current over 20 h (Fig. 4a), resulting in nearly linear charge accumulation versus time (Fig. 4b). As expected, Ni3S2 possessed the highest current density and hence produced the largest amount of H2, followed by NiS2 and then NiS. The induction period shown in the chronoamperometric curve of Ni3S2 is likely due to its surface arrangement and the dissolution of nickel oxides on the catalyst surface under cathodic potentials. These results demonstrate that all these nickel sulfides can catalyze H2 evolution continuously for an extended period of time albeit with different efficiency.

To better understand their HER performance trend and intrinsic activities, we should also consider the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of each catalyst, which is well known to significantly impact the electrocatalytic performance of a catalyst. Since it is very challenging to directly measure the absolute ECSA, a widely adopted method is to derive the relative ECSA based on the measurement of double-layer capacitance in the non-faradaic potential region.38 It is generally accepted that the double-layer capacitance is linearly proportional to ECSA.38 The double-layer capacitance of a catalyst can be conveniently deduced from cyclic voltammetry measurements at various scan rates. For instance, the cyclic voltammograms of Ni3S2 in −0.11 to −0.23 V vs. RHE at different scan rates are displayed in Fig. 5a. Similar cyclic voltammograms could be obtained for NiS and NiS2 (Fig. S3†). Plotting the difference in current densities of each anodic and cathodic scan versus the scan rate resulted in a linear relationship for each catalyst (Fig. 5b). Linear fitting of these plots produced capacitance values of 310, 445, and 741 μF cm−2 for NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2, respectively. Assuming a double-layer capacitance of 40 μF cm−2 for a smooth working electrode,39 the roughness factors of these nickel sulfides were calculated to be 7.75 (NiS), 11.13 (NiS2), and 18.53 (Ni3S2). Accordingly, the electrochemically active surface areas of NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2 are 0.55, 0.79, and 1.31 cm2, respectively. On the other hand, based on the loading amount of each catalyst on the working electrode, their physical surface areas were estimated to be 9.51, 4.21, and 7.56 cm2 for NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2, respectively. Fig. 5c compares the physical surface areas and ECSA of the three nickel sulfides. Although NiS possessed the largest physical surface area, its ECSA was the smallest. On the other hand, NiS2 with the smallest physical surface area in fact had a larger ECSA than NiS. In agreement with its highest HER activity, Ni3S2 showed the largest ECSA, nearly two times that of NiS2 and three times that of NiS. It is interesting to note that all the measured ECSAs are smaller than the physical surface areas, which is well anticipated since not all surface sites are active for HER electrocatalysis. In fact, taking Ni3S2 as an example, only about 17% of its physical surface area functions towards H2 production.

(c) Comparison of the physical surface area (red) and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA, blue) of NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2. 
The conductivity of a catalyst is another important factor that affects its overall electrocatalytic performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to reveal the conductivity of these three nickel sulfides. Fig. 6 presents the EIS results of the three samples measured at η = −257 mV. Each Nyquist plot starts at a resistance of 10–20 Ω, which is ascribed to the internal resistance of the strongly alkaline electrolyte. The fitted intrinsic resistance of Ni3S2 was 118 Ω, much smaller than those of NiS2 (264 Ω) and NiS (378 Ω) and in line with the best HER activity of Ni3S2. The Bode plots and corresponding fitting curves are included in Fig. S4.† As shown in Fig. 6, at a low-frequency region, a diagonal line with a slope of ~45° appears at the end of the EIS spectra of NiS2 and NiS, implying substrate diffusion-controlled kinetics, which further suggests that the relatively slow water dissociation plays an important role in the HER mechanism of NiS2 and NiS.

Finally, we conducted theoretical computations to gain more understanding of the electronic structures of NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2. Due to their rich electronic properties and diverse applications, nickel sulfides have been a subject of considerable theoretical investigations.40,41 However, due to the use of different calculation methods in previous studies, it is difficult to allow a fair comparison of the electronic properties of nickel sulfides with different crystal structures. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) computations of the three nickel sulfides were performed. It should be noted that all the calculations were based on the DFT+U method, in order to obtain more accurate predictions as demonstrated previously.36Fig. 7 shows the total and site-decomposed density of states for the three nickel sulfides. These plots reveal that the dominant interactions and contributions (in conduction bands and valence bands or at the Fermi level) are Ni 3d–S 3p in character for all the nickel sulfides, whereas the S 3s orbitals have little contribution. The most apparent difference in the computed electronic structures among the three nickel sulfides is that Ni3S2 was found to be metallic with its Fermi level crossing the Ni 3d orbitals, while both NiS and NiS2 were semiconductors with band gaps of ~1.1 and ~0.4 eV, respectively. These results are consistent with the EIS measurements. Since a larger band gap leads to higher resistance and hence lower conductivity, the theoretical computation results further corroborate the HER activities of the three metal sulfides in the order of Ni3S2 > NiS2 > NiS.

Conclusions
In summary, the crystalline nanoparticles of three nickel sulfides, NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2, were prepared via a facile microwave-assisted solvothermal method. Under the optimized synthetic conditions, the nanoparticle sizes and specific surface areas of these nickel sulfides could be controlled within the same magnitude. A detailed electrochemical study of the H2 evolution activities of these nickel sulfides was conducted under strongly alkaline conditions. Theoretical computations were also performed to aid in the understanding of the electronic structures of NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2. It was found that Ni3S2 exhibited the best performance for electrocatalytic HER, which could be rationalized by its large electrochemically active surface area and high intrinsic conductivity.
