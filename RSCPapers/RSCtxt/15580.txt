    , Accepted 17th November 2021First published on 17th November 2021AbstractLithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are considered to be among the most promising electrical storage devices for large-scale applications. In order to achieve a long lifespan and high performance for LIBs, however, it is necessary to replace the traditional graphite anode with appropriate advanced anode materials. Herein, a simple and cost-effective strategy was developed to synthesize a large–scalable nitrogen-rich sulfur-doped porous carbon (NSPC) material, which when used as an anode could deliver high-rate cycle performance with a prolonged cycle life. Benefiting from the higher nitrogen content and sulfur doping, the resultant heteroatom-doped porous carbon material exhibited a significantly high initial reversible capacity of 1096 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 with a high initial columbic efficiency of more than 67%. Even at a significantly high current rate of 5 A g−1, prolonged cycle life over 1100 cycles with outstanding cycle performance of 695 mA h g−1 was achieved. The observed ultrafast lithium ion storage is attributed to the synergic effect of heteroatom-doping and abundant mesopores with a large quantity of edge defects that enable additional lithium ion storage. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the introduction of N and S atoms into the porous carbon could efficiently change the charge density distributions over the carbon structure to improve the storage capacity of lithium ions and their electrochemical performance as an anode in LIBs.
1. Introduction
Substantial efforts have been dedicated worldwide for enabling next-generation sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies.1–3 Electrochemical storage systems offer higher power and energy densities and extended performance lifespans, which are extremely essential for large-scale electricity storage systems to accompany the extensive use of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, in modern electricity grids.4–8 Exploring the contemporary strategies in this area has realized global consideration, particularly focusing on the foremost performance requirements for electricity storage devices to facilitate ultralong cycle life, high energy density and an environmentally benign nature.9–12
Owing to their high energy density and prolonged cycling life, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are considered to be a promising option for electricity storage applications.13–17 Graphite is the only important commercial anode material that is still used in LIBs in the commercial market. However, its low theoretical specific capacity (372 mA h g−1) cannot meet the rapidly increasing demand for electric vehicles in the vastly emerging market in recent years.18–23 For large-scale commercial electricity storage, therefore, the performance capability, electrode durability and safety perspective need to be further improved.24–26 As such, it is urgent to design novel anode materials that possess high theoretical capacities with excellent cycling and rate performance for advanced LIBs. One attractive option is to construct anode materials with distinctive architectures.
Although carbon-based anode materials with unique architectures that deliver remarkable electrochemical performance with boosted lithium storage are still a substantial research focus,27,28 noteworthy efforts have been exerted to design carbonaceous anode materials with fascinating and novel nanostructures with a high specific capacity for lithium storage in LIBs.29–31 In particular, the electronic properties and structures of carbon materials can be regulated effectively by heteroatom-doping, leading to enhanced electrochemical properties for superb lithium ion storage capacity. However, most reported studies32 are focused on single-element doping; meanwhile, co-doping and its associated synergistic effects on electrochemical performance are much less discussed in the literature.
On the other hand, N-doped carbon nanostructures have been widely reported to efficiently improve the electronic properties of carbon materials.33,34 Of particular interest, sulfur doping has attracted rapidly increasing consideration, as sulfur can increase the interlayer distance (d002) of the carbon matrix due to its larger atomic radius.35 By increasing the graphite crystallite size (Lc) and micropores, sulfur-doping can significantly enhance the charge capacity and the electrochemical properties of carbon materials.36 Additionally, its tendency to polarize electron pairs could alter the charge state of adjacent carbon atoms. Hence, heteroatom-doping of sulfur into carbon-based nanostructured anode materials in LIBs can successfully enhance their specific capacity,37 and synergistic effects are realized with simultaneous doping of both nitrogen and sulfur into the carbon matrix.38–41 Nevertheless, most nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon materials have been used for improved electrocatalytic activities,42,43 and there is very limited research on N and S co-doped carbon materials for lithium storage.44,45 In the latter case, more studies are needed to further regulate the lithium storage properties of novel carbon materials for next-generation LIBs. In the present study, we developed a facile and versatile synthetic strategy to produce nitrogen-rich sulfur-doped porous carbon (NSPC) materials for high-performance LIBs. More specifically, NSPCs were prepared by heating a mixture of sulfur and N-containing polyacrylonitrile (PAN), which could be conveniently scaled up for large-scale production of the NSPCs with both of the sulfur and PAN precursors readily available at low cost. Meanwhile, the structure of the NSPCs can be changed through varying the sulfur content, and a class of NSPC anode materials with different sulfur contents and different carbon structures can be prepared at different heating temperatures to facilitate the mechanistic understanding of heteroatom-doping induced enhancement in lithium storage.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Material preparation
In a typical experiment, the N-rich S-doped porous carbon was prepared simply by grinding a mixture of polyacrylonitrile (Macklin, China, average M.W. 150000) and sublimed sulfur (Macklin, China) in a 1:1 mass ratio. The finely ground mixture was loaded in a ceramic boat and heated at 280 °C for 2 h in a vacuum atmosphere with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. Subsequent heating under an Ar atmosphere for 2 h at various temperatures with a heating ramp of 5 °C min−1 led to the products denoted as NSPCX, where X represents the heating temperature under Ar. For comparison, porous carbon (PCX) without sulfur-doping was also synthesized by directly heating polyacrylonitrile for 2 h in Ar atmosphere at appropriate temperatures.
2.2. Material characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D2 PHSDER X-ray diffractometer (Bruker Company, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540 56 Å). Raman spectra were performed on a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution instrument with a 532 nm laser at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) analysis was carried out using Al Kα radiation (Thermo VG ESCALAB MK II). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained using an ASAP 2460 N2 adsorption apparatus equipped with a surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics, USA). Morphologies of the prepared materials were examined by a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4700) with an attached EDAX micro analyzer to obtain the elemental compositions. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images were taken on a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 TEM using an accelerating voltage of 300 kV, while a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) (FEI Tecnai G2 F30) was operated at a voltage of 300 kV.
2.3. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance of NSPCX and PCX was investigated using coin cells (CR 2032) assembled in an argon-filled glovebox with oxygen and moisture contents below 1 ppm. Lithium foils were used as the counter electrodes, Celgard 2500 membrane as the separator, and 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture (1:1 by volume) of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DEC) as the electrolyte. To prepare the working electrode, the slurry was made with active materials (NSPCX or PCX, 80 wt%), a conductive material (Super P, 10 wt%), and a binder (poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), 10 wt%) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and it was then coated on a copper foil. The typical mass loading of the anode material was 1–1.5 mg cm−2. All the galvanostatic discharge/charge tests were performed on a LAND-CT2001A multichannel battery testing unit in the voltage range of 0.01 V–3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) in a frequency range of 0.01 Hz–100 kHz at open circuit potential (OCP) were measured on a SI 1287 and 1260 electrochemical measurement system (SOLARTRON CO.).
2.4. Simulation
In this study, all the calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) using the plane wave set Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.46,47 The projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudo-potentials48,49 were used to describe the interactions between nuclei and electrons, while the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)50 was used to describe the electronic and correlation effects. The cutoff energy was set as 500 eV. The value of Sigma was chosen to ensure that the energies were converged within 1 meV per atom. All structures were fully optimized until the force on every atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone was obtained using a 3 × 3 × 1 grid centered at the gamma (Γ) point using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme. A graphene supercell containing 57 atoms was used with a vacuum layer of 20 Å to ensure that the spurious interactions are negligible.
3. Results and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation process for NSPCX. As can be seen, the initial preheating at a low temperature of 280 °C caused short chains of –SX– to covalently bond onto the partially dehydrogenated, cyclized and ribbon–like backbone structure.51 The heteroatom-doped porous carbon matrix with some defects was synthesized by subsequent heating at higher temperatures under Ar atmosphere. The addition of sulfur to the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor ensured the formation of distinctive porous structures, whereas 3-D porous carbon spheres could only be synthesized by heating the PAN precursor together with sulfur at higher temperatures (900 °C, 1000 °C and 1100 °C) under an Ar atmosphere. The sulfur acted as a promising artificial template to guide the construction of 3-D porous structures through evaporation of the excessive sulfur under the Ar atmosphere.

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns, which indicate typical disordered carbon, with two broad peaks corresponding to (002) at around 25° and (100) at 43°. Table S1† lists the interlayer distances (d-spacing) estimated from the peak position of (002). It is noted that the d-spacing of the graphite domain in NSPCX increased with increasing heating temperature and that the relatively large d-spacing values of the NSPCX materials with respect to PCX depicted the sulfur-doping induced enlargement in the interlayer distance of the porous carbon materials, facilitating the electrolyte diffusion and insertion/extraction of lithium ions.52 As can be seen in Table S1,† NSPC1100 has the largest interlayer distance, whereas PC1000 shows the smallest d-spacing. Fig. 1b shows the Raman spectra for all samples investigated in this study, with the corresponding peak intensity ratios of the D band to G band (ID/IG), to monitor their graphitization degree.53,54 As expected, the graphitization degree increased with increasing the annealing temperature, and hence the electrical conductivity increased.35 Furthermore, the downshift of the G band wavelength is attributable to the charge-transfers caused by the heteroatom (nitrogen and sulfur) doping.55

We further used the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique to measure the specific surface area and porosity of all samples by employing nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S1†). The pore distribution analysis in Fig. S2† shows that the NSPCX samples are more dominant with the mesopores, which could support a very fast diffusion of lithium ions to increase their storage sites and the effective permeability of the electrolyte.56 Consequently, the heteroatom-doped porous carbon with a mesoporous structure could show high lithium storage properties.
To examine the surface chemistry and element-bonding configurations in NSPCX, we also performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. As shown in Fig. 1c, the XPS survey spectrum of NSPC-1000 shows four characteristic peaks, attributable to S 2p (164.6 eV), C 1s (284.6 eV), N 1s (400 eV), and O 1s (531.5 eV). The presence of nitrogen and sulfur signals in the XPS survey spectrum of NSPC confirmed the successfulness of the N- and S-doping. Fig. 1d shows the corresponding high-resolution XPS C 1s peak, which can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.6 eV, 286.8, and 289.8 eV attributable to C–C, C–O, and CO/O–CO, respectively. The additional peak at 285.6 eV indicates the presence of C–S and C–N,55,57 indicating, once again, the successfulness of both the N- and S-doping. Moreover, the high-resolution XPS N 1s spectrum in Fig. 1e could be deconvoluted into three characteristic peaks at 398.2, 400.6 and 401.8 eV, corresponding to pyridinic-type, pyrrolic-type and graphitic-N, respectively.58 Owing to their donation of the p-electron pair to the Π-conjugated system within the graphene sheets,34,59 pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen species are beneficial for improving the conductivity and reversible capacity of LIBs. Fig. 1f shows the high-resolution XPS S 2p spectrum, which was deconvoluted into three peaks at binding energies of 163.7, 165.2 and 168.3 eV, corresponding to SC, –S– and SO, respectively.35

Fig. 2a–c and Fig. S4 (ESI†) show scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of PC1000, NSPC-900, NSPC-1000 and NSPC-1100, which reveal the presence of large, bulk-shaped solid particles in PC1000 (Fig. 2a) due to the low melting point (317 °C) of PAN.35 Meanwhile, the NSPCX samples display porous spheres (Fig. 2b–d and Fig. S4†). Many interconnected pores exist in the porous carbon spheres, especially in NSPC-1000 (Fig. 2b and c). More interestingly, high magnification observation shows numerous distinctive nanoscale pores within the porous spheres of NSPC-1000 (Fig. 2c). This unique nanostructure contains abundant interpenetrative channels with connected large internal spaces formed via a soft-template route through excess sulfur evaporation during the carbonization process.52 The porous carbon framework thus formed could facilitate the fast access of electrolytes to promote efficient lithium ion transfer, providing additional spaces for lithium storage and engaging rapid charging and discharging processes of the electrode. Fig. S5† shows the SEM elemental mapping for NSPC-1000, which reveals a homogenous distribution of C, N, and S in the bulk material, while the elemental compositions of the as-prepared NSPCX samples are given in Fig. S6.†Fig. 2d shows the corresponding transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image, which reveals the typical porous structure of the spheres for NSPC-1000. High-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images of PC-1000 and NSCP-1000 (Fig. 2e and f) demonstrate disordered structures. Consistent with Fig. 1a and b, NSPC-1000 (Fig. 2e) exhibited a relatively low degree of graphitization with respect to PC (Fig. 2f) because the S-doping induced structural defects, as also confirmed by the corresponding selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAED) (Fig. 2e and f). Finally, TEM-EDS mapping images of NSPC-1000 are given in Fig. 2g–k, and they show a uniform distribution of C, N, and S within the porous NSPC-1000.

To test the electrochemical performance, we performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements on the prepared PC-1000 and NSPC-1000 electrodes for LIBs in the initial three cycles in the potential range of 0.01 to 3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. Notably, the first cycle of the CV curves is very different from the following cycles, particularly for the discharge of NSPC-1000. On the first cathodic curve, a redox peak is observed at 0.5 V for the PC-1000 electrode, and an obvious reductive peak appears at 0.7 V for NSPC-1000; these are usually attributed to the electrolyte decomposition and various side reactions on the electrode surface/interface due to the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI).37,60 The stronger intensity of these peaks in the first cycle than in the subsequent CV cycles indicates not only the SEI film formation but also some irreversible side reactions. The peaks observed near 0.0 V provide validation for the successful insertion of lithium ions into the carbon electrode, as previously reported.44 The oxidation peak appeared at 2.35 V (Fig. 3b), which can be attributed to the expected conversion reaction of LixS to polysulfides.44 Importantly, the CV curves of the PC-1000 sample showed redox peaks under 0.5 V, whereas the NSPC-1000 sample exhibited more redox peaks above 0.5 V due to the additional lithium storage reactions that occurred above 0.5 V in the presence of N- and S-doping. From the second cycle onward, all the CV curves are almost overlapped, implying superior cycling stability with improved performance for the NSPC-1000 electrode.

Fig. 3c and d shows the typical discharge/charge profiles for PC-1000 and NSPC-1000 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. In the first cycle, the presence of an obvious voltage plateau from 0.6 to 0.95 V can be ascribed to the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of an SEI film on the NSPC-1000 electrode surface.34 During the first cycle, the discharge curve of NSPC-1000 is as high as 1634 mA h g−1 (Fig. 3d), but it delivers a first reversible capacity of only 1096 mA h g−1, ensuring an initial coulombic efficiency of about 67%. The large surface area and the doping of heteroatoms into the carbon material could lead to the formation of thin SEI layers,56 thus delivering low initial coulombic efficiencies of 74.3% for NSPC-900 (Fig. S7a†), 62.2% for NSPC-1100 (Fig. S7b†), and 54.7% for PC-1000 (Fig. 3c) during the first cycle. It was found that the initial reversible capacity increased with increasing sulfur content in the order of 1129.6 mA h g−1 for NSPC-900, 1096 mA h g−1 for NSPC-1000, and 991.3 mA h g−1 for NSPC-1100. With continued cycling, the capacity showed a gradual decrease, as observed within the first 50 cycles (Fig. S7†). Based on these results, we envisioned that the relatively high sulfur-doping content of the NSPC matrices caused the structural instability and constraint of the lithium storage capability for NSPC-900 during the discharge/charge processes. Due to the formation of the SEI film, an irreversible capacity is inevitably shown during the first cycle for irreversible storage of lithium ions into distinctive positions/sites in the porous carbon materials.61 As a result of the irreversible capacity loss, the formation of the SEI layer, and the electrolyte decomposition, a relatively low initial coulombic efficiency was observed, consistent with the CV curves, in which the reduction peak appeared in the first cycle but almost disappeared in the subsequent scans. Despite this, a significantly higher initial coulombic efficiency than that previously reported for N-, S-co-doped carbon materials55,62 was obtained, suggesting that the special carbon architecture and the high-level N, S heteroatom-doping could efficiently decrease the irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle.

Fig. 4a shows the rate capabilities at different current densities. As can be seen, stable reversible capacities of 897, 745, 619 and 568 mA h g−1 were achieved at the current densities of 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 and 1 A g−1, respectively. When the current density was restored to 0.2 A g−1, the capacity promptly recovered to 837 mA h g−1, validating the excellent rate performance of the NSPC-1000 electrode. We further examined the cycling performance of PC-1000 and NSPC-1000 (Fig. 4b), NSPC-900 and NSPC-1100 (Fig. S8†). NSPC-1000 delivered a stable reversible capacity of 935 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, showing a high coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% after the initial few cycles. The high-rate discharge/charge performance is imperative for various practical battery applications,34,63 including portable power gadgets and electric vehicles. As shown in Fig. 4c, the NSPC-1000 electrode delivered a noticeably stable and excellent reversible capacity of 508 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles, with a superior coulombic efficiency of more than 99%. Interestingly, the capacity increases gradually after 400 cycles and reaches as high as about 695 mA h g−1 after 1150 cycles, demonstrating the excellent cycling stability of the NSPC-1000 electrode for high-performance LIBs. While the initial decrease in the capacity is due to the structural change and the SEI formation, the increase in the capacity during the subsequent discharge/charge cycles is attributable to the better access of lithium ions to the interior side of the porous NSPC spheres upon cycling for improved lithium accommodation.60,64 A similar trend in the increase of the reversible capacity with cycling has already been reported for other carbon-based electrode materials; this can be attributed to the persistent electrochemical activation process of the heteroatom-doped carbon anodes.30,55

(c) Cycling performance and corresponding coulombic efficiency of NSPC-1000 at a current density of 5 A g−1. 
EIS measurements were also performed for the PC-1000 and NSPC-1000 samples in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), Nyquist plots of both samples exhibit a similar profile composed of an obvious semicircle (in the high and medium frequency regions) with a sloping line in the low-frequency region. Apparently, the NSPC-1000 sample showed a smaller diameter of the semicircle than the PC-1000 sample, suggesting excellent electrical conductivity and a much lower charge-transfer resistance for the NSPC-1000 electrode.65 Compared to the PC-1000 sample, the NSPC-1000 electrode showed a larger Warburg slope, suggesting faster lithium-ion diffusion into the heteroatom-doped porous carbon material. Thus, these results indicate that the heteroatom-doping and the porous structures with a unique morphology can significantly accelerate the lithium-ion and electron transports. Thus, the N, S dual-doped porous carbons are promising electrode materials for high-performance LIBs, and the electrochemical performance of these electrodes is summarized in Table S2† and Fig. 3e in comparison with relevant electrodes reported in the literature.
4. Mechanistic studies
To gain a further mechanistic understanding of the superior lithium storage of the NSPC electrode, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Specifically, we first calculated the adsorption energy of Li (ΔEa) on the N and S co-doped carbon and non-doped carbon surfaces, which was determined to be −3.59 eV (Fig. 5a) and −1.64 eV (Fig. 5b), respectively. These results illustrated that the introduction of N and S atoms can significantly improve the adsorption of lithium compared to the non-doped carbon structure, suggesting that the doping of N and S can provide a stronger lithium-ion storage capacity. For comparison, the adsorption energies (ΔEa) of the single S atom-doped carbon (−3.40 eV, Fig. 5c) and single N-doped carbon (−1.13 eV, Fig. 5d) surfaces were also calculated; the results demonstrated that there is a synergistic effect between N- and S-doping on the improvement of the adsorption performance, as the lithium adsorption energy of the N and S co-doped carbon surface is higher than that of either the single N or S-doped counterpart. Our calculations also indicate that the introduction of S dopant atoms and the associated vacancy can significantly benefit the adsorption of lithium, whereas the introduction of only N dopant atoms could not facilitate the lithium adsorption in the nitrogen-doped carbon (Fig. 5d), as evidenced by the relatively poor performance of PC-1000. To better understand the enhanced lithium storage capacity, we further performed charge density difference analysis by subtracting the charge density of the lithium atom and the carbon substrate from the charge density of the combined structure as a single compound. The results are shown in Fig. 5e–l, which indicate that the charge transfer from the adsorbed lithium to the substrate is more significant in the structure regulated by N and S dopant atoms, suggesting preferable adsorption of lithium in the N and/or S-doped structures. Therefore, we can conclude that the introduction of N and S dopant atoms can efficiently change the charge density distribution of the carbon surface and improve the storage capacity of lithium-ion as well as the electrochemical performance of carbon-based anode materials in LIBs.

Top and side views of the charge density difference distributions of lithium adsorbed in the (e and i) N and S atoms co-doped carbon, (f and j) non-doped carbon, (g and k) S-doped carbon and (h and l) N-doped carbon surfaces. The carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and lithium atoms are represented by gray, blue, yellow and green, respectively. The yellow and blue isosurfaces with isovalues of 0.0014a0−3 represent increased and decreased charge density, respectively, where a0 is the Bohr radius. 
The observed superior lithium storage for the NSPC electrode materials can be qualitatively described as presented in the schematic (Scheme 2). The hierarchical and advanced pore structures with a relatively high surface area and the presence of copious micro and mesopores provide a large quantity of special sites for lithium ion storage, while the enlarged interlayer spacing, heteroatom-doping and numerous defects in the carbon matrix facilitate the absorption as well as fast insertion and extraction of lithium ions. Furthermore, lithium ions could diffuse into additional sites present in the interlayer spaces and defects that are perpendicular to the interlayer planes for efficient accommodation of lithium ions.61 The three-dimensional (3-D) porous spheres can also act as reservoirs for superior lithium storage by reducing their diffusion distance to ensure excellent cycling performance with a notable mechanical stability. Therefore, it is the interplay of the advanced porous structures, proper heteroatom-doping, and appropriate degree of graphitization that is responsible for the observed outstanding electrochemical performance of the NSPC samples. Moreover, sulfur-doping can increase the defect population and the interlayer spacing in the carbon matrix, providing additional storage sites for lithium ions. Consequently, sulfur-doping of advanced pore carbon structures has been demonstrated to show synergistic effects for enhancing the electrochemical performance of carbon electrodes.37

5. Conclusions
In summary, exceptional lithium storage performance has been demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically for nitrogen-rich and sulfur-doped porous carbon spheres, delivering a stable reversible capacity of 935 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. As a result, excellent cycle performance with a reversible capacity of 695 mA h g−1 even after 1150 cycles at 5 A g−1 was realized. The electrochemical analyses and DFT calculations exhibited that heteroatom-doping was highly beneficial in the carbon matrix, which is extremely worthwhile for fast lithium storage and long-term cycle performance. First-principle calculations suggest that the combination of N and S atom doping in the porous carbon structure can significantly change the charge density distribution of the carbon materials and enhance the storage capacity of lithium ions. In addition, an optimum sulfur content has also been found to avoid the excessive sulfur doping that can cause degradation of a carbon matrix. Our results suggest a new and facile strategy for the development of nitrogen-rich and sulfur-doped porous carbon-based anode materials for next-generation LIBs with a long lifespan for large-scale energy storage applications.
