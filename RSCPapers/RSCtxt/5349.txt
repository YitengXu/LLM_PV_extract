    , Accepted 26th August 2019First published on 26th August 2019AbstractIn recent reports, combinations of lead free organic inorganic halide perovskites have shown significant advances in solar cell devices. The aim of the present work is to prepare a defect ordered perovskite with nontoxicity, high stability and enhanced optoelectronic properties. We report the synthesis of high band gap cesium doped with methyl ammonium tin chloride ([(CH3NH3)0.5(Cs)0.5]2SnCl6, [(MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6]) defect perovskite nanocrystals for multi junction solar cell applications. The substitution of inorganic cesium metal cations with organic methyl ammonium cation nanocrystals in the ratio of 50:50 at the A site was performed to modulate the band gap level and enhance the thermal stability. The crystallinity, vibrational state analysis, thermal stability and surface morphology of the synthesised compounds were investigated. UV-vis and photoluminescence measurements revealed that the band gap value is tunable and the band gap value obtained for (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 is 1.89 eV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies showed enhanced thermal stability for (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 since the weight loss is meagre until it attains 900 °C. The electrical properties of (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 were studied using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) studies. EIS studies showed the recombination process was controlled for the (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 perovskite material by proper electron transfer, which may lead to an increase in the efficiency of solar cells.
Introduction
In recent years, organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have attracted prominent attention in solar cells, because of their high efficiency, tunable optical properties, better hole transport, cost effectiveness, simple preparation techniques and scalability.1,2 The general formula for the perovskite structure is ABX3, where A can be a monovalent organic or inorganic cation, B can be a divalent metal cation, and X can be a halogen such as Cl, Br and I. The power conversion efficiency of thin film photovoltaic (PV) solar cells based on these combinations has shown rapid progress in research areas from an initial value of 3.8% in 2009 to the extreme value of 22.1% in 20163–5 and the photovoltaic efficiency was recently certified as 24.2%.6 Preferably, methyl ammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX3) were considered to have a pronounced effect in the light absorbing capacity due to their superior properties such as high absorption coefficients, optimal band gaps, and long-range exciton diffusion lengths.7 Though there are many advantages with this combination of lead based perovskite material, there are a few limitations, which include poor long-term stability, toxicity and less tunable optical band gap properties.3,8,9 Hence, many research works are focused on other combinations of perovskite materials which could possess long-term stability, non-toxicity and enhanced tunability of band-gap properties. Organo-lead halide perovskites can be replaced by means of all lead free inorganic cesium tin halides (CsSnX3, X = Cl, Br, I).10 However, the instability of both organic cation (A site) and metal cation (B site Sn2+) towards moisture, air and heat, could leads to easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. It has been reported that Sn4+ based perovskite variants (Cs2SnX6) show enhanced stability compared to Sn2+ based perovskites including some optoelectronic properties.8,11,12
Cs2SnX6 is a defect variant of perovskites with a cubic structure, where half of the B sites are voids, creating isolated [SnX6] octahedra. Cs atoms are filled in between the sites of [SnX6] octahedra in a regular 12-fold coordination environment of X atoms as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic crystal structure of defect perovskite Cs2SnCl6. Cesium atoms occupy the interstitial sites and Cl atoms are represented by the green colour. 
In earlier reports, most of the research work was carried out with organic/inorganic based lead perovskites, substitution of lead with other elements and lead free perovskites in order to reduce the toxicity level of lead in solar cell applications. Kulbak et al. reported the synthesis of lead based perovskite materials CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. They showed that the efficiency of CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 is almost the same at 6%. But the thermal stability was very high for CsPbBr3 compared to MAPbBr3.13 Pallavi et al. reported the synthesis of manganese chloride (MnCl2) substitution for lead in a methyl ammonium lead based perovskite, in order to remove the toxicity level. They have substituted MnCl2 in different values of x from 1 to 0.2 and revealed that the weight percentage of lead incorporated in the material was decreased from 30.58 to 0.72 weight percent. The efficiency achieved was 0.83% with x = 0.8.14 Pallavi et al. reported Mg2+ cation substitution for Pb2+ in a hybrid lead halide perovskite. This substitution showed an enhancement in thermal stability. The PCE efficiency achieved was 14.2% and 14.50% for the device fabricated with CH3NH3PbxMg1−xI3−yCly and MAPbI3 respectively.15 Roshan et al. studied the synthesis of lead free perovskites by mixing group II (Ca, Sr) and XIV (Ge and Sn) into the B site cation of MAPbI3. They prepared different combinations of the material and achieved a high absorption coefficient by tuning the band gap (1.70–1.90 eV).16 L. J. Chen reported the synthesis of lead free perovskites by substituting Ge2+ divalent cations into the B sites of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I). This work revealed a maximum photo conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.94% for CsGeI3 whereas the PCE for CsGeBr3 & CsGeCl3 was 4.92% and 2.57% respectively.17
Many attempts have been made in perovskite synthesis by exchanging the halide ions. Kaltzoglou et al. studied the synthesis of Cs2SnX6 and its optical vibrational properties by changing the halide ions (X = Cl, Br, I). It was reported that Cs2SnI6 exhibited higher efficiency (4.23%) due to tuning of the band gap when compared to other perovskites such as Cs2SnCl6 and Cs2SnBr6.18 Zhu et al. synthesized lead free all inorganic perovskite Cs2SnIxCl6−x by mixing iodide with chloride halide ions. They showed an improvement in thermal stability and efficiency due to tuning the band gap into a wide range from the UV to the infrared region with low chloride content mixed with iodide.19
M. T. Horantner et al. synthesized and experimentally evaluated the performance of multi junction solar cells such as perovskite double junction (2PJ) and triple junction (3PJ). It was reported that the efficiency value can reach 33.8% and 36.6% respectively.20 T. C. Jenyang et al. reported high-bandgap (>1.7 eV) mixed halide perovskites for fabricating multi junction solar cells. They theoretically predicted multi junction solar cells with high efficiency, for which the band gap value of the top cell was reported in the range of 1.7 to 1.9 eV. It was shown that the efficiency can reach >35% in multi junction solar cells.21 The high band gap values of perovskite materials which are used in multi junction solar cells are shown in the ESI† (Table S1).
To the extent of our knowledge there is no work reported on an A-site combination organic and inorganic cation defect perovskite based solar cell device. The thermal stability and band gap tunability are very high in defect perovskites when compared to normal perovskite materials. In this aspect we have chosen a material by substituting cesium cations with methyl ammonium cations at the A site and using a non-toxic element (Sn) at the B site. In the present scenario, we have obtained a high band gap value of cesium doped with methyl ammonium tin chloride (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 using cesium tin chloride (Cs2SnCl6) and methyl ammonium tin chloride (MA2SnCl6) for multi junction solar cell application by means of a slow evaporation technique. The thermal stability, band gap characteristics, and optical and electrical properties of (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 were compared with Cs2SnCl6 and MA2SnCl6. These studies were performed to improve the efficiency of solar cells.
Experimental section
Cesium chloride (CsCl), tin chloride (SnCl2) and methyl ammonium chloride (MACl) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich with 99% purity and used without further purification. Cs2SnCl6 was synthesized by using CsCl and SnCl2 as precursors with molar ratio 1:1 and they were subsequently dissolved in solvent (deionized water).22 About 0.1 M HCl was added to prepare the SnCl2 solution in order to obtain a clear solution.23 The prepared solution was stirred for 4 hours at 300 °C for a homogenous mixture. Following stirring these solutions were exposed to air. Normally CsSnCl3 is unstable in air hence it can be easily oxidized to Cs2SnCl6 by a phase change.13 Finally pure white minute crystals (Cs2SnCl6) were obtained after one week by a slow evaporation method. The other two perovskite nanocrystals [(MA2SnCl6) and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6] were prepared by using the same procedure, by mixing stoichiometric quantities of their respective chloride salts. The pictures of the solutions are shown in a ESI† (Fig. S1).
The stoichiometric equation of the synthesized defect perovskites is given as follows
Cesium tin chloride: CsCl + SnCl2 → CsSnCl3(1) 2CsSnCl3 + O2 → Cs2SnCl6 + SnO2(2)
Methyl ammonium tin chloride: CH3NH3Cl + SnCl2 → CH3NH3SnCl3(3) 2CH3NH3SnCl3 + O2 → (CH3NH3)2SnCl6 + SnO2(4)
Cesium doped with methyl ammonium tin chloride: 2CH3NH3Cl + 2CsCl + 2SnCl2 + O2 → [(CH3NH3)0.5(Cs)0.5]2SnCl6 + SnO2 + Cl2(5)
Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite materials were collected using a Bruker-AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54186 Å) in the range of 10–60° (2θ) with a step size of 0.02°. Raman spectra were used to study the characteristics of the perovskite powder form of the materials (model Nano photon Raman11-I, Japan). The samples were recorded in the frequency range of 100–500 cm−1. The infrared (IR) spectra were recorded in the range of 450–4000 cm−1 on a JASCO 4600 FTIR spectrometer using the KBr pellet method. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) of the perovskite materials were carried out using a PerkinElmer Diamond TGA/DTA instrument. The thermal properties of Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 were studied in powder form under a nitrogen gas atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in the temperature range 10 °C to 1000 °C by using TGA and DTA. The absorption spectra were measured with a Varian Cary 6000i UV-vis-NIR spectrometer with an InGaAs detector. Photoluminescence (PL) was measured with a home-built system with a 532 nm CW laser and a Si photodetector. The high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction measurements were performed using a Tecnai F20 G2 operating at 200 kV. The surface morphology and elemental composition of the synthesized materials were characterized by FESEM and EDAX analysis (model CARL ZEISS SUPRA 55, Germany). The compositional analysis was carried out with the EDAX system attached to the FESEM. The EDAX spectra were recorded as an average of five consecutive runs on each sample. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on the synthesized defect perovskites at the open circuit potential (Voc) using the potentiostat Biologic-SP 240 (EC-Lab V10.37 software) at room temperature in the three-electrode configuration. Frequency scanning was done over the 10 mHz to 1 MHz range.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a–c show the XRD patterns of Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 along with the corresponding JCPDS file to clearly understand the difference, respectively. It is observed from Fig. 2a that the strong diffraction peaks of Cs2SnCl6 are at 2θ values of 14.791°, 17.11°, 24.35°, 28.46°, 29.97°, 34.61°, 37.88°, 42.53°, 45.56°, 49.65°, 52.21°, 56.08° and 59.27° corresponding to hkl Miller indices of (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), (422), (511), (440), (531), (620) and (622), which indicate that the well crystallized material has a cubic crystal structure of the Fmm space group with a lattice parameter of 10.38 Å. These hkl indices were compared with both JCPDS file card number (07-0197) and the literature.10,13,24 Rietveld refinement was performed using the FullProf program, for which the calculated and observed difference for Cs2SnCl6 is shown as ESI,† Fig. S2.
 Fig. 2  XRD pattern obtained for the synthesized defect perovskites (a) Cs2SnCl6, (b) MA2SnCl6 and (c) (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6. 
From Fig. 2b it is clear that MA2SnCl6 exhibited strong diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 12.19°, 14.91°, 16.58°, 21.626°, 24.72°, 27.79°, 29.95°, 31.46°, 33.25°, 38.57°, 39.35°, 40.91°, 43.76°, 44.88°, 51.01°, 52.48° and 53.86° corresponding to the (003), (101), (012), (104), (110), (113), (202), (107), (024), (211), (122), (214), (125), (119), (306), (223) and (315) crystal planes of rhombohedral perovskite respectively, which is in good agreement with the literature as well as JCPDS number (140822).25,26 MA2SnCl6 has the Rm space group with lattice parameters a = b = 7.156 Å and c = 22.044 Å. The increased peak intensity of the (003) lattice plane is due to the high concentration of methyl ammonium cations. These XRD patterns confirm the formation of methyl ammonium and cesium tin halide synthesized powder.
The XRD pattern of (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 is shown in Fig. 2c. Strong diffraction peaks were observed for (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 at different 2θ values of 12.19°, 14.79°, 17.11°, 24.35°, 28.46°, 29.97°, 34.61°, 37.96°, 39.18°, 42.53°, 45.56°, 49.65°, 52.29°, 56.08° and 59.27° corresponding to hkl Miller indices of (003), (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), (122), (422), (511), (440), (306), (620) and (622), which indicates that the well crystallized material has a cubic structure.1,2 All the peaks obtained are similar to the peaks obtained in Cs2SnCl6 but the peak obtained at 2θ value 12.19° corresponding to lattice plane (003) is slightly reduced when compared to the peak obtained in the same position in MA2SnCl6. The peak has reduced because the concentration of methyl ammonium has reduced in (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6.

Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of Cs2SnCl6, (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 and MA2SnCl6. Four Raman active vibration modes are present in the Cs2SnX6 system, among which three modes, namely ν1 (Sn–X symmetric stretching), ν2 (asymmetric Sn–X stretching vibration (doubly degenerate)) and ν3 (asymmetric bending X–Sn–X deformation (triply degenerate)) vibrations, are inside the SnX6 octahedron. The fourth vibration mode ν4 is the second degenerate mode, which is related to the Cs atoms in the rigid [SnX6] lattice. Three peaks are observed for Cs2SnCl6, (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 and MA2SnCl6, among which three active modes ν1, ν2, ν3 correspond to the SnCl6 octahedron at wavenumber 309 cm−1, 232 cm−1, and 168 cm−1 respectively.2,10,23,24,27–29 The strongest peak is observed at a 309 cm−1 wavenumber corresponding to symmetric stretching (ν1). These vibration modes confirm the presence of all the groups in the synthesized organic–inorganic halide [Cs2SnCl6, (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 and MA2SnCl6].

Fig. 4a–c shows the FTIR spectra of synthesized defect perovskites of MA2SnCl6, (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 and Cs2SnCl6, respectively. From Fig. 4c a broad intense peak at 3428 cm−1 confirms the presence of OH groups associated with water molecules, which might be due to the solvent used in the synthesis of the defect perovskites. The peaks at 600 cm−1 and 1632 cm−1 confirm the presence of cesium element and Sn–Cl in the perovskite respectively.30 This result confirms the presence of all the elements in the synthesized Cs2SnCl6.
 Fig. 4  FTIR spectrum obtained for (a) MA2SnCl6, (b) (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 and (c) Cs2SnCl6. 
From Fig. 4a it is clear that the peak at 3426 cm−1 corresponds to OH groups associated with water molecules. The peak at 3220 cm−1 confirms the presence of the N–H stretching vibration and the peaks at 1624 cm−1, 1480 cm−1 and 906 cm−1 confirm the presence of the N–H bending vibration in CH3NH3+. The peaks obtained at 1422 cm−1 and 583 cm−1 correspond to C–N and alkyl halide C–Cl.31 This result confirms the presence of all the corresponding groups in the synthesized MA2SnCl6. In Fig. 4b the peaks obtained were similar to the structure of MA2SnCl6 and all the observed peaks correspond to this perovskite and these results are already discussed for MA2SnCl6.

Fig. 5a–c present the TGA and DTA plots of Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6. From Fig. 5a it is observed that there is no weight loss of the substance till it reaches a temperature around 530 °C. About 10% weight loss of the substance is obtained at 550 °C and about 30% weight loss of the substance is achieved at 600 °C. These results indicate that Cs2SnCl6 is found to be stable up to 530 °C.19,29,32,33Fig. 5b shows that the weight loss was obtained in two stages. In the first stage there is complete decomposition (70% weight loss) around a temperature value of 226 °C, while at the second stage the weight loss of the substance is obtained as 80% and the remaining 20% of the substance remains stable until it reaches 900 °C. So it is evident that MA2SnCl6 is stable up to 226 °C.4,34Fig. 5c shows that there is a minute loss in weight around 200 °C due to the presence of organic methyl ammonium cations in (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6. The weight loss slowly increases with an increase in temperature but 50% of the weight of the substance exists until it attains 900 °C. Hence (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 has high stability when compared to Cs2SnCl6 and MA2SnCl6 due to much less weight loss with respect to temperature.

Fig. 6a–c show the absorbance spectra of Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 measured in the wavelength range of 200–1000 nm to determine the optical properties. The Tauc plot is used in UV analysis and the variation of (ahv)2versus photon energy (hv) was used to estimate the energy band gap of Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6. The energy gap was determined from the intersection of the extrapolated line on the photon energy axis. Band gap values of 2.14 eV, 1.89 eV, and 1.64 eV were determined for Cs2SnCl6, (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 and MA2SnCl6 from the Tauc plot respectively.35–39 Thus it confirms that the band gap value is tuned when cesium metal ions are doped with methyl ammonium cations. The optical band gap was further verified by PL spectroscopy.

Fig. S4a–c (ESI†) show the PL spectrum of Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6. Generally the band gap values for defect perovskite materials were in the range from 1.75 eV to 2.5 eV. A broad PL peak with high intensity was observed at 610 nm, 780 nm and 680 nm corresponding to band gap values of 2.03 eV, 1.59 eV, and 1.82 eV for Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 respectively. This is in good agreement with the band gap values obtained from the Tauc plot and theoretically predicted band gaps.38–40

Fig. 7a–c show the HRTEM images of Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 and the corresponding Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) patterns (inset). The planes are fixed in the SAED images, which are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S5). These planes are in good agreement with the XRD peaks. From the figure, it is observed that all the three defect perovskite materials are formed as polycrystalline nanoparticles and also each crystal is well separated by a grain boundary.30

Fig. 8a–f show the FESEM surface morphology of the synthesized Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 as well defined nanocrystals. This analysis indicates that the size of the Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 particles is 30 nm, 20 nm and 35 nm as shown in Fig. 8b, d and f respectively. It is observed that the size of the particles reduces as inorganic cesium metal cations are doped with organic methyl ammonium cations. As the particles are of nanosize recombination will be controlled and there could be an increased efficiency in solar cells.41
 Fig. 8  FESEM images for the synthesized Cs2SnCl6 (a and b), MA2SnCl6 (c and d) and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 (e and f). 
Fig. S6–S8 (ESI†) show the EDAX studies of the synthesized defect perovskite materials. In Fig. S6 (ESI†) the presence of the Cs, Sn and Cl elements indicates that the synthesized powder is Cs2SnCl6. As given in Fig. S7 (ESI†) the presence of the N, C, Sn and Cl elements confirms that the synthesized powder is MA2SnCl6.31 In Fig. S8 (ESI†) the existence of the Cs, Sn, Cl, N and C elements clearly shows that the synthesized material is a combination of both methyl ammonium and cesium tin chloride at the A-site [(MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6]. The weight percentage of carbon and nitrogen is high in MA2SnCl6 when compared to (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6. This is because of the substitution of cesium ions with methyl ammonium cations at the A site. The reduced weight percentage of carbon and nitrogen is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). These results agree very well with XRD.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique is carried out to find out the optimized efficiency of defect perovskites. This process is usually analyzed at electrode/perovskite interfaces. Fig. 9 shows the Nyquist plot for the synthesized defect perovskites Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6. The maximum resistance for Cs2SnCl6 and minimum resistance for MA2SnCl6 were obtained. (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 showed resistance in between MA2SnCl6 and Cs2SnCl6. This can be explained with the help of the equivalent circuit. The equivalent circuit model for these perovskites is shown in the inset of Fig. 9. The data obtained after fitting the spectra were analyzed using the Biologic – SP 240 instrument (EC-Lab V10.37 software). The most suitable spectra were selected on the basis of best fitting with a small chi square value. These values are tabulated in Table 1. The EIS spectra are fitted with the model [R1 + C1/R2/(Q3 + R3)] comprising the circuit components R1, C1, R2, Q3 and R3. The fitted values are tabulated in Table 2. R1 is the series resistance and it does not show any alteration in all the perovskites. R2 is the grain bulk resistance (Rb) of the perovskites and its corresponding capacitance is C1. R3 is the grain boundary resistance of the perovskites (Rgb) and its corresponding capacitance is a constant phase element (CPE) Q, which is an imperfect capacitor. The impedance of a CPE from Boukamp's formalism is given by the equation.42 (6)Here Q can be determined with the parameter Y0, ω is the angular frequency and n is the exponent of the CPE, which is associated with a non-uniform distribution of current. n values will be in the range between −1 and 1 (0 < n < 1). If n is equal to one Q behaves as a perfect capacitor. If n is equal to zero it describes a pure resistor.

Normally grain boundary resistance exists in the low frequency region and grain bulk resistance occurs in the high frequency region. These resistances could be measured at the counter electrode and perovskite interface since this process is related to transfer of electrons. The results from the UV plot show that Cs2SnCl6 has a higher band gap value of 2.14 eV when compared to MA2SnCl6 (1.64 eV) and (MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6 (1.89 eV). If the band gap value is very high then the Rb value increases. Also its Rgb value tends to be very high when compared to its Rb and the n value obtained for this perovskite is 0.80. So there will be resistance to flow of electrons and there will not be any recombination effects. This prediction relates to Cs2SnCl6 and its values are seen in Table 2. For MA2SnCl6, the Rb value decreased and its corresponding Rgb value also decreased and hence there will be more flow of electrons, which leads to high recombination, which could reduce the efficiency. The n value obtained for this perovskite is 0.45.43 In the case where the cation doped perovskite has Rb values and Rgb values in between the other two perovskites it has a tunable band gap value. The n value obtained for this perovskite is 0.63. Hence the flow of electrons will be controlled, thereby leading to less recombination, which could increase the efficiency.44 Hence the mixed cation perovskite could exhibit a tunable band gap with high efficiency when compared to the other synthesized perovskites.
Conclusions
Lead free inorganic perovskites Cs2SnCl6, MA2SnCl6 and incorporating 50% Cs with 50% methyl ammonium at the A-site [(MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6] using a slow evaporation technique were successfully synthesized. The crystalline nature and functional groups present in the synthesized perovskites were confirmed by XRD, Raman and FTIR respectively. The surface morphology and presence of elements in the synthesized powder were confirmed by HRTEM and FESEM with EDAX respectively. The mixed cations at the A site of the perovskite with equal content can moderately strengthen the optical properties due to tuning of the band gap and this was also confirmed by PL intensity studies. The mixing of cations at the A site of the perovskite [(MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6] shows greatly improved thermal stability without much degradation when compared with the Cs2SnCl6 and MA2SnCl6 perovskites. EIS studies confirmed that the [(MA0.5Cs0.5)2SnCl6] mixed cation perovskite has high efficiency due to less recombination than Cs2SnCl6 and MA2SnCl6. From the above results it is concluded that the mixed cation perovskite might have enhanced efficiency and thermal stability. Therefore our synthesized combination organic–inorganic cation high band gap value perovskite materials can be used as top cells in multi junction solar cells. Our future work is to synthesise low band gap value perovskite materials, which are going to be used as a bottom solar cell structure, and fabricate multi junction solar cells to improve the efficiency over single junction solar cells.
