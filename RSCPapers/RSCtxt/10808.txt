    , Accepted 11th August 2018First published on 14th August 2018AbstractA novel propeller-shaped molecule (HPB-PDI6) with a hexaphenylbenzene (HPB) core and six peripheral PDI units was synthesized via Co2(CO)8-catalyzed cyclotrimerization and used as an acceptor for organic solar cells (OSCs). The intriguing geometry of the HPB core and the spatial repulsion of the PDI rings created a twisted three-dimensional propeller-shaped conformation for HPB-PDI6. The propeller-shaped conformation could prevent the acceptor molecules from forming large aggregates in the active layer. As expected, the PTB7-Th:HPB-PDI6 blend films show a favorable morphology as well as high and balanced charge carrier mobility. Devices based on PTB7-Th:HPB-PDI6 achieved a PCE of 6.63% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 15.11 mA cm−2, and an FF of 48.0%. Our results have demonstrated that the easily prepared propeller-shaped HPB-PDI6 could be a promising acceptor for high efficiency organic solar cells.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) based on fullerene derivative electron acceptors have achieved great success in the past decades.1–5 However, the intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene derivatives, such as low absorbance in the visible region, limited tunability of the chemical structures and energy levels, costly production and purification processes, and instability of the morphology in the blend films, have limited the further development of fullerene-based OSCs.6,7 To overcome the drawbacks of fullerene acceptors, exploring new acceptors to replace fullerene derivatives is therefore highly demanded. Recently, nonfullerene small molecular acceptors (SMAs) have emerged as promising alternatives to fullerene derivatives in OSCs due to their advantages of low cost, adjustable chemical structures, energy levels and light absorption, and enhanced environmental/thermal stability.8–16 Hitherto, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction nonfullerene organic solar cells has reached beyond 14%.17
Perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives have been widely used as electron acceptors because of their high electron mobility, favourable photochemical stabilities and a suitable absorption range.18–20 High efficiency organic solar cells also require that the donor and acceptor could form the hole and electron transport path, respectively, in the active layer. However, due to the large coplanar molecular structure and high crystallinity, PDI-based simple SMAs tend to form large aggregates in the active layer, leading to poor photovoltaic performance.21,22 To solve this problem, various strategies have been developed to reduce the domain size of PDI derivatives in the active layer without sacrificing their higher electron mobility.23–45 Increasing the dimensionality of PDI derivatives could prevent the formation of oversized acceptor domains, improve electron transport and suppress the nongeminate charge recombination in the blend films.27–45 For example, star-shaped PDI derivatives with a spiro-bifluorene core,31 a tellurophene core,32 a triphenylamine core,40 a 1,3,5-triazine or a 1,3,5-benzene core,36 a spirobifluorene core,41 a tetraphenylethylene core,34 a 9,9′-bifluorenylidene core,42 a central BDT-Th core,43–45 and a tetrathienylbezene core37 have been prepared and improved power conversion efficiencies have been obtained.
Motivated by the above ideas, we developed a novel propeller-shaped PDI acceptor (HPB-PDI6) with a hexaphenylbenzene (HPB) core and six peripheral PDI units (Scheme 1). To the best of our knowledge, only star-shaped PDI molecules with three or four peripheral PDI units have been used as acceptors for OSCs, and there is no report on star-shaped PDI derivatives with six peripheral PDI units. The propeller-like structure should prevent HPB-PDI6 from forming large aggregates when blending with polymer donors and the congested PDI structure should endow the blend film with a high electron mobility. HPB-PDI6 can be easily prepared by a Co2(CO)8-catalyzed cyclotrimerization reaction with a yield of 48%. The photovoltaic performance of HPB-PDI6 was tested by choosing poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-(2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] (PTB7-Th)46 as the donor. As expected, the blend films showed a favourable morphology and the devices provided a PCE of 6.63% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 15.11 mA cm−2 and an FF of 48.0%, suggesting that the propeller-shaped HPB-PDI6 is a promising nonfullerene acceptor for high efficiency organic solar cells.

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of HPB-PDI6 are illustrated in Scheme 1. Compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized according to the reported literature.47,48 Compound 3 was prepared in a yield of 76% by Suzuki cross-coupling of 1 and 2. The Co2(CO)8-catalyzed cyclotrimerization of 3 gave HPB-PDI6 in a yield of 48%. HPB-PDI6 exhibited an excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF), o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and chlorobenzene (CB), etc. The thermal properties of HPB-PDI6 were investigated via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The 5%-decomposition temperature of HPB-PDI6 was found to be 400 °C under an N2 atmosphere, which revealed its good thermal stability. No obvious melting peak or glass transition was detected for HPB-PDI6 in the range of 50 to 350 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were performed to evaluate the molecular geometries of HPB-PDI6 with alkyl chains replaced by methyl groups for simplicity. The optimized molecular geometries of HPB-PDI6 are shown in Fig. 1 and the HOMO and LUMO orbitals are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The optimized molecular geometry showed that HPB-PDI6 possesses a twisted geometry with a high degree of rotational freedom. The six phenylene rings are almost perpendicular to the central benzene core with a dihedral angle of about 80° (Fig. S2, ESI†). And the twist angle between the PDI unit and the adjacent phenylene unit is around 60°. Additionally, the PDI unit became twisted with a torsion angle of about 17°.

The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of HPB-PDI6 and PTB7-Th in DCB solutions and as films are depicted in Fig. 1. HPB-PDI6 in DCB solution exhibits a strong absorption band in the range of 400–600 nm with a peak located at 542 nm, and the maximum extinction coefficient is 3.27 × 105 M−1 cm−1. In going from a solution to a film, the absorption profile of HPB-PDI6 is almost unchanged, suggesting that the intermolecular interaction is weak in films. From the absorption onset of the films, the optical band gap (Eg,opt) of HPB-PDI6 is calculated to be 2.10 eV. The complementary absorption between HPB-PDI6 and PTB7-Th is beneficial to harvesting more solar energy. The optical properties are listed in Table 1.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pristine PTB7-Th, HPB-PDI6 and the blend films under different conditions were measured and the results are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). When excited at a wavelength of 676 nm, PTB7-Th exhibited a strong PL emission at around 770–860 nm, which was mostly quenched by blending with HPB-PDI6. This indicates that the exciton dissociation in the PTB7-Th:HPB-PDI6 blend is efficient.
The electrochemical behaviours of HPB-PDI6 were investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal standard, and the CV curves are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The detailed data are summarized in Table 1. The potential of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was 0.09 eV. From the CV measurement results, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of HPB-PDI6 were calculated to be −5.69 and −3.93 eV, respectively, according to the equation of EHOMO = −e[Eox + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)] and ELUMO = −e[Ere + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)]. The HOMO and LUMO offsets between HPB-PDI6 and PTB7-Th are 0.47 and 0.29 eV, respectively.
Because of the complementary nature of the absorption and appropriate energy levels, PTB7-Th was chosen as the donor polymer to blend with HPB-PDI6 as the active layer. BHJ OSCs were fabricated with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/PTB7-Th:HPB-PDI6/MoO3 (8.5 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The ZnO layer was prepared according to the literature procedure.49 The active layer was spin-coated from a DCB solution of PTB7-Th and HPB-PDI6 with a polymer concentration of 10 mg ml−1. Initially, the weight ratio of PTB7-Th to HPB-PDI6 was screened from 1.5:1 to 1:2. The optimized weight ratio and active layer thickness are 1:1 and about 100 nm, respectively. The influence of an additive and thermal annealing on the performance of the devices was also studied in detail. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 2. The photovoltaic parameters of the optimized devices are illustrated in Table 2 and Table S1 (ESI†). The pristine devices provided a PCE of 5.12% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 13.18 mA cm−2, and an FF of 43.5%. After the addition of 0.1 vol% DIO as the additive, the PCE was further improved to 5.77% with a slightly enhanced FF of 47.8%. Upon thermal annealing at 140 °C for 5 minutes, the devices gave the best performance with a PCE of 6.63% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 15.11 mA cm−2, and an FF of 48.0%. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured to verify the accuracy of Jsc obtained from the J–V measurement. The devices showed a broad EQE response ranging from 300 to 800 nm, matching roughly with the absorption spectrum of the blend film. The deviation of the Jsc value from the J–V measurement and the one from the integration of the EQE curve is within 5%.

To study the charge transport properties, a hole only device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and an electron only device with a configuration of FTO/active layer/Al were fabricated. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the devices were investigated from dark J–V curves using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†) and Table 2, the pristine devices gave electron and hole mobilities of 2.70 × 10−5 and 1.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After adding 0.1% DIO as the additive, the μe and μh increased to 8.31 × 10−5 and 2.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μh/μe decreased from 5.41 to 2.91, indicating that the hole and electron mobility of the devices became more balanced. After annealing at 140 °C for 5 minutes, the μe and μh was further improved to 1.03 × 10−4 and 2.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The higher and more balanced charge mobility can well explain the higher Jsc of the optimized devices.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was used to investigate the molecular packing behaviours (Fig. S6, ESI†). For the pristine films, a broad diffraction peak centered at 20.16° and 22.24° can be observed for HPB-PDI6 and PTB7-Th, respectively, corresponding to the π–π distance of 4.41 and 3.99 Å. For the PTB7-Th:HPB-PDI6 blend film, the diffraction peak located at 21.90° becomes even broader. The morphology of the blend films was investigated via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 3a–c, the AFM images of the blend films fabricated under different conditions exhibit quite a similar morphology with a rather smooth surface and the RMS roughness values are all around 0.70 nm, indicating the good miscibility of PTB7-Th and HPB-PDI6. The morphology difference can be clearly seen from the TEM images. The pristine blend films are homogeneous with entangled nanofibrils. After adding 0.1% DIO (by volume) as the additive, the blend films are still homogeneous but the diameter of the nanofibrils became smaller. Upon further annealing treatment at 140 °C for 5 min, the morphology is almost unchanged.

Conclusions
A novel propeller-shaped Perylene diimide hexamer (HPB-PDI6) comprising a hexaphenylbenzene (HPB) core and six peripheral PDI units was synthesized and used as the acceptor for OSCs. HPB-PDI6 was prepared via cyclotrimerization of a 1,2-diphenylacetylene derivative with Co2(CO)8 as the catalyst. The intriguing propeller-shaped geometry of the HPB core and the spatial repulsion of the PDI rings created a twisted three-dimensional conformation for HPB-PDI6. HPB-PDI6 exhibits a good solubility in common organic solvents and can be easily purified via column chromatography on silica gel. PTB7-Th with a complementary absorption and matched energy levels was chosen as the donor to fabricate OSCs with HPB-PDI6. The optimized devices gave a PCE of 6.63% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 15.11 mA cm−2, and an FF of 48.0%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the synthesis of a benzene-cored six arm star-shaped molecule bearing six peripheral PDI functional groups to be used as a nonfullerene acceptor for high efficiency organic solar cells.
