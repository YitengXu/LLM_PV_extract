Large hysteresis in bilayer P3HT–TiO2 devices indicates the presence of charge traps at the interface, unlike in P3HT-COOH–TiO2 devices. The results provide insights into enhancing interfacial interactions between organic and inorganic materials using modifiers such as –COOH, for the rational design of efficient hybrid solar cells.
Bilayer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)–TiO2 hybrid solar cells were employed to evaluate the role of interfacial modifiers in enhancing charge separation and transfer processes at complex organic–inorganic interfaces. Substituting a mono-carboxylated, semi-telechelic P3HT (P3HT-COOH) in lieu of P3HT was found to improve solar cell performance, in particular the open-circuit voltage. In-device Fluorescence-Voltage Spectroscopy (ID-FVS) was applied to further probe the interfacial charge transfer processes, and a clear difference of bias-dependent fluorescence modulation between P3HT and P3HT-COOH was observed. The P3HT–TiO2 bilayer devices showed the presence of charge traps at the interface whereas the P3HT-COOH–TiO2 devices did not. These results establish new directions for increasing the efficiency of hybrid solar cells by enhancing the interfacial interactions between organic and inorganic materials using readily accessible modifiers. In addition to photovoltaic measurements, fluorescence modulation can also be useful in investigating the mechanism of charge injection, transport, and trapping in organic solar cells, light emitting diodes, and transistors.
Hybrid solar cells are a promising class of conjugated polymer-based photovoltaic devices that combine the unique properties of many inorganic materials, such as high stability, low toxicity, and facile nanostructuring, with the processing flexibility offered by organic materials.1–6 Hybrid solar cells are typically comprised of a conjugated polymer (e.g., P3HT) placed in contact with nanostructured inorganic layers (e.g., TiO2). Recent reports on hybrid solar cells exhibiting efficiency values exceeding 5% have brought renewed interest in this class of solar cells.7–9 The improvements in the device performance were mainly attributed to modifications carried out at the interface between the organic and inorganic layers using dye molecules,10 oligomers with carboxylic acid groups,7–12 or solid state layers such as Sb2S3.9,10
In general, inclusion of interface modifiers are reported to enhance device efficiencies of hybrid solar cells by improving TiO2 surface wettability or reducing backward recombination rates at the TiO2–polymer interface.7,10–12 However, their exact role is still under active investigation, mainly because of difficulties involved in direct measurement of interfacial processes. Unfortunately, only a few methods exist for direct probing of interfacial phenomena such as charge transfer and/or interfacial dipoles within working devices, wherein the internal electric field affects charge transfer mechanisms.10,13 In fact, the majority of previous efforts that examined the effect of interfacial modifiers on device structures drew conclusions by studying configurations in which no electrodes were present or by indirectly evaluating current–voltage curves of the corresponding photovoltaic devices.14,15 A fundamental understanding of the fate of charges generated at the complex interface between dissimilar materials is critical to further improve the efficiency of hybrid solar cells. For example, charge trapping can lead to enhanced backward recombination rates, and is, therefore, an important issue affecting device performance.
Herein we introduce In-device Fluorescence-Voltage Spectroscopy (ID-FVS) as a technique for directly probing charge transfer processes at the organic–inorganic interface of bilayer hybrid solar cells working under steady state conditions. Because excess charges are efficient quenchers, the fluorescence intensity of conjugated polymers can be used to probe charge injection/ejection. This technique was previously introduced to study charging and discharging of single conjugated polymer nano-domains in capacitor-type devices, which revealed details related to charge trapping processes in conjugated polymers.16–19 By applying this technique to bilayer hybrid solar cells, fluorescence quenching due to charge injection at the organic–inorganic interface was observed, and the effect of interfacial modifiers, such as carboxylic acid groups, on charge transfer processes was directly studied.
The device structure of the hybrid solar cells used in this study is depicted in Fig. 1a. The simple P3HT–TiO2 bilayer design of these devices also makes them ideal interfacial prototypes, while providing opportunities for both mechanistic studies and device optimization. Furthermore, the interface between the polymer and TiO2 layers is well defined in this system, which is an advantage since the direction of the applied electric field can be uniform within the device. Otherwise, it is extremely difficult to understand and discuss the effect of applied bias within devices. Using this scheme, we modified the hybrid P3HT–TiO2 interface by substituting P3HT with a P3HT derivative, containing a single carboxylic acid end-group (P3HT-COOH), envisioning an enhanced affinity of the –COOH groups toward the TiO2 surface in an effort to study how such a chemical modification affects interfacial charge transfer processes.
 Fig. 1  (a) Device structure and (b) current density–voltage (J–V) curves of hybrid solar cells. Insets show chemical structures of P3HT and P3HT derivative containing a single carboxylic acid end-group (P3HT-COOH). 
Initial efforts were directed towards device fabrication. Bilayer hybrid P3HT–TiO2 solar cells containing low molecular weight (Mn ∼ 10 kDa) samples of P3HT and P3HT-COOH were fabricated as previously reported (Fig. 1a).20 In these devices, the electron acceptor and the transporter were the dense 100 nm TiO2 layer and the photon absorber, the electron donor and the hole transporter were a 50 nm layer of one of the aforementioned polymers. It must be noted that devices based on such thin polymer films are ideal prototypes for studying interfacial phenomena because the effect of bias on fluorescence intensity is more drastic than in the case of thick films, but such a device is not necessarily optimized to give the highest possible efficiency. For this reason, thin polymer films were used here and, as might be expected,10,21 the power conversion efficiencies of the fabricated hybrid solar cells were not exceedingly high, although reasonable. However, the current density–voltage (J–V) curves showed that the bilayer devices containing P3HT-COOH exhibited improvements in open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) compared to devices containing pristine P3HT (Fig. 1b). Although all three photovoltaic parameters increased, the largest enhancement was seen in the Voc and FF values which tripled and doubled respectively, making P3HT-COOH-based devices five times more efficient compared to P3HT-based devices (Table 1).

Several possibilities have been reported that can explain such increase of the device efficiencies by the chemical modification of P3HT.13,22–24 The device fabrication steps may benefit from the presence of carboxylic acid anchoring groups, which promote better wetting of the TiO2 by the polymer in the case of P3HT-COOH,22 contributing to the improved fill factor (FF) and overall higher efficiency. The higher Voc values obtained with the P3HT-COOH could also reflect a reduced backward recombination or improved charge separation at the TiO2–polymer interface.23 The observed difference in photovoltaic parameters between P3HT and P3HT-COOH may be due to the local electric field introduced by the ordered layer of carboxylic acid molecular dipoles at the interface.13,24 Moreover, the interfacial dipole moment differences between P3HT-COOH and P3HT may also influence the distribution as well as the behavior of charge traps at the interface.
To further understand the effect of polymer modification on the charge transfer processes that occur at the interface, ID-FVS was performed on the bilayer devices. Briefly, ID-FVS measurements involve recording changes/modulation in fluorescence intensity under 488 nm excitation, while applying a triangular voltage bias (Fig. 2a) to the device. Intuitively, we expected negligible fluorescence under equilibrium (zero bias) conditions, because exciton dissociation at the interface should ideally prevent excitons from radiative recombination. However, a significant fluorescence signal was observed at zero bias when the experiment was performed, which may have resulted from the bilayer device architecture where a large fraction of excitons may be too far from the interface and from charge carrier recombination occurring in the polymer layer. Upon the application of a voltage bias, the energy bands tilt and lead to a modulation in fluorescence intensity. Fig. 2b and c display the bias-induced fluorescence intensity modulation exhibited by P3HT-based hybrid solar cells as a function of time and bias, respectively. Fluorescence intensity decreased when positive bias was applied (quenching), and fluorescence intensity was recovered under negative bias. A movie of wide-field fluorescence images of a P3HT-based device showing fluorescence intensity modulation as a function of bias is provided in the ESI.† Fluorescence quenching indicates that there are now excess charges in the polymer layer compared to the case of zero bias. We define quenching depth18 as: QD = (Io − I)/Io(1)where Io and I are the fluorescence signal intensities before and after the fluorescence quenching events, respectively. A fluorescence quenching depth of 0.65 is shown in Fig. 2. The mean and standard deviation of the quenching depth from a total of 10 measurements from multiple devices are summarized in Table 2.

Fluorescence quenching under positive bias may be attributed to electron transfer from TiO2 to P3HT, a process commonly referred to as back electron transfer, which increases backward recombination rates.25–27 Because of the direction of the slopes of the energy bands during positive bias (inset in Fig. 2c), electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 into P3HT can be relatively easy. The source of these electrons could be doped charges on the TiO2 surface, optically excited electrons generated in the TiO2 under 488 nm illumination (Fig. S3 in ESI†), or a combination of these cases.28,29 Although fluorescence quenching could be caused by the forward electron transfer process from P3HT to TiO230,31 due to charge separation and transfer mechanisms from singlet excitons that are optically excited in the polymer, these processes will typically occur during the application of zero or a negative bias, as indicated by the slope of the energy bands (inset in Fig. 2c). These results suggest that the fluorescence quenching observed at positive bias cannot be explained by the forward electron transfer process from P3HT to TiO2 across the interface. During negative bias, the bands slope up, impeding the back electron transfer process, leading to fluorescence recovery.
It is important to verify whether the fluorescence quenching observed in Fig. 2 was due to charge transfer at the polymer–TiO2 interface instead of charge injection at the polymer–electrode interface. To examine whether fluorescence quenching was caused by hole injection from the top Au electrode into the polymer layer, a series of capacitor-type hole injection devices were fabricated in which the semiconducting TiO2 layer was replaced by an insulating SiO2 layer16–18,30,31 as such devices should effectively function as an open circuit. Upon performing ID-FVS on these devices, we observed no fluorescence quenching (quenching depth <0.03 in Fig. S5 in ESI†). This result effectively eliminated the possibility of hole-induced quenching from the top electrode as a source of the observed fluorescence quenching in the polymer–TiO2 bilayer devices. Furthermore, we observed that the depth of fluorescence modulation was inversely dependent on the thickness of the polymer film (Fig. S6 in ESI†). As summarized in Table 2, thicker (∼100 nm) polymer films resulted in smaller quenching depths in both P3HT and P3HT-COOH devices, compared to thinner films (∼50 nm). This trend further confirmed that fluorescence quenching indeed originates from an interfacial charge transfer process, particularly in the case of devices featuring such thin (50 nm) polymer layers.
While both P3HT and P3HT-COOH-based devices exhibited fluorescence quenching under positive bias, clear differences were observed. Fig. 3 shows the plot of fluorescence intensity as a function of applied bias. A large hysteresis was observed only in the case of the P3HT devices, but not in the case of those which contained P3HT-COOH. The hysteresis may be an indication of the presence of (energetic) charge traps in P3HT devices. These charge traps can exist on the TiO2 surface or deep within the polymer. New charge traps can also arise at the organic–inorganic interface when the organic polymer layer forms a composite with the inorganic TiO2 layer. The difference between the two devices is the presence of carboxylic acid moieties that help anchor the polymer onto the TiO2 surface. As the acid group might affect the polymer morphology and, therefore, cause differences in hysteresis, absorbance spectra and AFM images of the P3HT and P3HT-COOH films on an underlying TiO2 layer were compared. Both P3HT and P3HT-COOH films showed similar absorption spectra (Fig. S4 in ESI†) and AFM images (Fig. S7 in ESI†). Collectively, these results confirmed that the morphologies displayed by these films were similar and largely do not account for the differences summarized in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Fluorescence intensity as a function of applied bias. Large hysteresis observed only for P3HT devices indicates the presence of charge traps in P3HT devices. 
There can be several possibilities as to why only P3HT devices show the presence of traps. One is that the carboxylic acid groups at the P3HT–TiO2 interface generate interfacial dipoles that might aid in de-trapping of the trapped charge carriers.13 During the positive bias cycle, charges are injected into the polymer from TiO2, and during the negative bias these charges are extracted. Hysteresis occurs because of the presence of charge traps, necessitating the use of more energy to fully extract the trapped charges. However, in the case of P3HT-COOH, it is plausible that the acid group may protonate the TiO2 surface to create interfacial dipoles, which provides an additional electric field that facilitates the de-trapping of charges.8,13,32 Another possibility is that the acid groups on the TiO2 fill the traps energetically, thereby eliminating the source of the traps. The presence of fewer traps could explain why P3HT-COOH-based devices showed no hysteresis. The steric effect due to the large size of –COOH moieties may also serve as an effective backward recombination barrier by blocking the back electron transfer from TiO2 to P3HT, while its conducting nature allows for efficient forward interfacial charge transfer.11,12 In this work, we were not able to clarify which mechanism caused the observed difference in hysteresis between P3HT and P3HT-COOH-based devices; however, it is still remarkable that the presence of the acid groups significantly reduced the observed hysteresis in devices which contained them.
The aforementioned results showed that ID-FVS complements conventional photovoltaic characterization methods by probing interfacial charge transfer in working devices and by providing information on how interface modifiers, such as carboxylic acids, alter the organic–inorganic interface within hybrid solar cells. While it is not straightforward to conclude that less trapping of charges is the reason why P3HT-COOH devices show higher Voc and power conversion efficiency, this possibility cannot be overlooked. The ideal interface modifier in hybrid solar cells must perform the dual roles of reducing the trapping of charge carriers and backward charge carrier recombinations at the interface.6,11 For example, organic molecules and ruthenium-based dyes are reported to be effective modifiers for the surfaces of inorganic oxides.6,13,23,33–35 In fact, the dye molecules in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) use carboxylic acid functional groups as tethers to anchor themselves onto the TiO2 surface in order to reduce surface defect sites and suppress backward charge carrier recombination.21,36,37 In polymer-containing devices, the incompatibility of the hydrophilic TiO2 with the hydrophobic polymer can also be significantly reduced by functionalization, thereby enhancing interfacial charge separation and transfer.34,35
Conclusions
In summary, the unique bias-dependent fluorescence modulation technique (i.e., ID-FVS) demonstrated here can be used to track the fate of charges at the organic–inorganic interface, and possibly determine their lifecycle inside a hybrid solar cell. Our results indicate that interfacial modification techniques can be utilized to alter the pathways of charges and provide new avenues to enhance device properties. For example, the devices containing P3HT-COOH showed an increase of Voc, and elimination of charge traps. Similar to the effect of interfacial dipoles on energy band edge positions,8,13 we hypothesize that the presence of trapped charges might also affect Voc. These results can improve our fundamental understanding of interfacial charge transfer not only within hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells, but also broadly in bulk heterojunction solar cells as well. Importantly, this technique can be performed on working photovoltaic devices and, in principle, can be extended to any type of device or application that contains well-defined interfaces, such as organic light emitting diodes and transistors. Taken in combination with standard photovoltaic device characterization techniques, ID-FVS can be developed as a powerful tool to study charge injection, transport, and trapping at the polymer–TiO2 interface, and is expected to guide the multi-level rational design of efficient, stable organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells.
