McAleer and Laurence M. PeterAbstractPhotocurrent spectroscopy has been used to examine the early stages of anodic film growth on titanium. Analysis of the photocurrent conversion efficiency as a function of wavelength for films formed at different potentials has shown that the film is essentially pure TiO2 above ca.1.5 V vs. SCE (at pH 0). Photocurrent spectroscopy has also been used to follow changes in the structure and thickness of the anodic film during breakdown at higher voltages.
