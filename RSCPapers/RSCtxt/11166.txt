    , Accepted 7th May 2018First published on 8th May 2018AbstractConsidering the environmental issues, it is essential to develop highly efficient and recyclable photocatalysts in purification systems. Conventional TiO2 nanoparticles have strong intrinsic oxidizing power and high surface area, but are difficult to collect after use and rarely absorb visible light, resulting in low photocatalytic efficiency under sunlight. Here we develop a new type of highly efficient and recyclable photocatalyst made of a three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured N-doped TiO2 monolith with enhanced visible light absorption. To prepare the sample, an ultrathin TiN layer (∼10 nm) was conformally coated using atomic layer deposition (ALD) on 3D nanostructured TiO2. Subsequent thermal annealing at low temperature (550 °C) converted TiN to anatase phase N-doped TiO2. The resulting 3D N-doped TiO2 showed ∼33% enhanced photocatalytic performance compared to pure 3D TiO2 of equivalent thickness under sunlight due to the reduced bandgap, from 3.2 eV to 2.75 eV through N-doping. The 3D N-doped TiO2 monolith could be easily collected and reused at least 5 times without any degradation in photocatalytic performance.
Introduction
One of the important applications of titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a photocatalyst that purifies pollutants in an eco-friendly way based on its high oxidation potential (∼2.8 V), high chemical stability, and non-toxicity.1 Over the past two decades, research studies have focused on increasing the surface area of anatase phase TiO2 through nanostructuring to maximize photocatalytic surface reactions. For example, various types of TiO2 nanomaterials, such as nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanotubes, have been proposed as nanostructured photocatalysts.2 Despite the improved photocatalytic activity of such nanomaterials, there are still two issues: (i) difficulty in collecting and reusing dispersed TiO2 nanomaterials, and (ii) limited absorption wavelength range (<380 nm; only 2% of sunlight) due to the intrinsic energy bandgap (Eg ∼3.2 eV) of TiO2. To practically utilize the nanostructured TiO2 photocatalysts working under natural sunlight, these two issues should be addressed.
Recently, our group reported a large-area (625 mm2), highly porous TiO2 monolith with periodic three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures that can be used as a reusable and highly efficient photocatalyst.3 An industry-friendly fabrication process consisting of atomic layer deposition (ALD) and proximity-field nanopatterning (PnP)4–12 ensures reproducibility and scalability. The resulting 3D nanostructured TiO2 film showed significantly improved photocatalytic activity compared to commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (P25), and was semi-permanently reusable due to its monolithic form. However, artificial high-power UV irradiation is still essential to activate the photocatalytic effect of TiO2 and it is difficult to achieve high photocatalytic activity under sunlight. The doping method can be helpful for increasing the light absorption and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 at visible wavelengths. Various dopants (N, S, C, and metals) reduce the Eg of TiO2 by inserting an intermediate energy level in a band structure or modifying a band edge. In particular, the conversion of TiO2 to N-doped TiO2 can be simply achieved by the thermal annealing of TiO2 in an N-fluent atmosphere.13 However, toxic gases (e.g. NH3, N2, etc.) and high-temperatures (<800 °C) are generally required for full conversion, which make preservation of the nanostructured porous template difficult without structural collapse.
Here, we report a new strategy for fabricating monolithic 3D nanostructured N-doped TiO2 directly converted from 3D nanostructured TiN in low-temperature (∼550 °C) and atmospheric environments. Large-area (625 mm2) 3D nanostructured TiN films (∼6 μm) with high porosity (∼90% air) were prepared by a well-established templating method based on the combination of PnP and ALD. Through the subsequent thermal annealing, TiN was converted to N-doped anatase TiO2 without structural collapse. The measured Eg of 3D N-doped TiO2 was 2.75 eV, much lower than that of 3D undoped TiO2 (3.2 eV). The resulting 3D N-doped TiO2 film successfully decomposed methylene blue (MB) solution under solar irradiation with ∼33.5% enhanced photocatalytic efficiency compared to 3D undoped TiO2. The monolithic film can be reused at least 5 times without any degradation in photocatalytic activity.
Experimental section
Fabrication of 3D N-doped TiO2
A 3D nanostructured epoxy template was prepared by PnP, as described previously.14 The area and thickness of the epoxy template were 625 mm2 and 5 μm, respectively. A thin (∼20 nm) TiO2 layer was conformally deposited on the 3D epoxy template by ALD at 90 °C (Atomic-Classic, CN1 Co., Ltd). Tetrakis-dimethyl-amido titanium (TDMAT) (UP Chemical) and H2O were used as a precursor and a reactant, respectively. The deposition rate was ∼0.75 Å per cycle. The epoxy template was then thermally decomposed in an oven at 500 °C to obtain a 3D TiO2 hollow nanostructure to be used as a high-temperature backbone. An ultrathin (∼10 nm) TiN layer was conformally deposited on the 3D TiO2 hollow nanostructure by ALD at 350 °C. TDMAT and NH3 were used as a precursor and a reactant, respectively. The deposition rate was ∼1.07 Å per cycle. The TiN layer was converted to an N-doped anatase TiO2 layer by thermal annealing at 550 °C in an atmospheric environment. The unstructured samples (referred to as undoped TiO2 and undoped N-doped TiO2) were prepared on a flat substrate under same processes as those for fabricating 3D nanostructured samples; also, the thickness of the unstructured samples is 40 nm, which is equivalent to the total shell thickness of the 3D nanostructured N-doped TiO2.
Measurement of photocatalytic activity
All samples were cut into a rectangular shape (1 × 2 cm2) with a diamond cutter and then immersed in a cuvette filled with 4 mL of MB solution. The initial concentration (C0) of MB solution was 10 μM L−1. Thereafter, the MB solution was stirred for 30 min to form the absorption/deabsorption equilibrium of the dye on the sample surface. A UV lamp with a wavelength of 365 nm, a diode laser with a wavelength of 405 nm and a solar simulator were used as three different types of light sources. The irradiation power densities of the UV lamp, laser diode and solar simulator were 1.5 mW cm−2 (at a wavelength of 365 nm), 2 mW cm−2 (at a wavelength of 405 nm) and 1 mW cm−2 (at a wavelength of 525 nm), respectively. The irradiation time was adjusted to 3 h at intervals of 30 min. The decomposition rate was evaluated by the change in absorbance of the MB solutions at 685 nm.
Characterization studies
The microstructure was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (SU5000, Hitachi). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo VG Scientific, K-alpha) was used to analyze binding energies and elements. An X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (D/MAX-2500, Rigaku) was used to analyze the crystal structure. Transmittance and absorbance were measured using a UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere (SolidSpec-3700, Shimadzu).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a illustrates the fabrication process of a monolithic 3D N-doped TiO2 film. At first, an epoxy template with a thickness of ∼5 μm is quickly prepared in a large area (625 mm2) by PnP, which can produce periodic 3D nanostructures in a single exposure as a result of Talbot interference from a conformal phase mask (Fig. S1a†). The structural unit cell of 3D nanostructures is elongated body-centered tetragonal (BCT) with planar and perpendicular structural periodicities of 600 nm and 1 μm, respectively. For a subsequent high-temperature ALD process required for TiN deposition,13 the epoxy template with poor thermal resistance (<100 °C) is converted to a hollow TiO2 backbone through a templating method consisting of sequential low-temperature (90 °C) ALD and thermal decomposition (500 °C) (Fig. S1b†). An ultrathin (∼10 nm) TiN layer is then conformally deposited on the 3D TiO2 backbone via high-temperature (∼350 °C) ALD. The resulting film contains a periodic 3D network of a total of 40 nm thick ceramic layers comprising a sandwich structure of TiN (10 nm)/TiO2 (20 nm)/TiN (10 nm). Thermal annealing at 550 °C in an atmospheric environment transforms the TiN layer into an N-doped anatase TiO2 layer without structural collapse over a large area (Fig. 1b and c).

Fig. 2 demonstrates the chemical transformation from TiN to N-doped TiO2via thermal annealing. The chemical binding energy of Ti 2p analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates that converted 3D N-doped TiO2 film contains three types of chemical bonds consisting of Ti–N, Ti–N–O, and Ti–O. Unlike the pristine TiN film, which shows a main peak at 455 eV corresponding to the Ti–N bond (Fig. S2a†), the converted 3D N-doped TiO2 film shows a main peak at 459 eV corresponding to the Ti–O bond (Fig. 2a). According to the N 1s scan, converted 3D N-doped TiO2 film contains two types of chemical bonds consisting of N–Ti and N–O. The center of the main peak corresponding to the N–Ti bond is 396.8 eV, which is in good agreement with the previously reported results.13 The intensity of the main peak corresponding to the N–Ti bond of the 3D N-doped TiO2 film is 2.8 times stronger than the undoped 3D TiO2 film, which is further evidence that N-doping has been achieved through thermal annealing (Fig. 2c). The doping ratio of N to TiO2 is estimated to be 2%. Fig. 2d shows the crystal structure and phase of the 3D N-doped TiO2 film by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The pristine TiN layer deposited by ALD is of NaCl crystal structure with very weak diffraction peaks, which is consistent with the previously reported results (Fig. S2c†).15 Since amorphous TiO2 generally undergoes a phase transition in the temperature range of 400 to 600 °C, the conversion of the TiN layer to anatase phase TiO2 and N-doping occur simultaneously through thermal annealing at 550 °C.

Fig. 3 represents optical characteristics of the converted N-doped TiO2 film through thermal annealing. The N-doping of TiO2 results in a red-shift of the absorption spectrum (Fig. 3a).16 The absorbance of N-doped TiO2 is higher than that of undoped TiO2 over the entire UV and visible wavelengths (from 300 to 800 nm). In particular, in the visible wavelength (>400 nm), the absorbance of the undoped TiO2 is nearly negligible (absorption coefficient: 1.09 × 104 cm−1 at 400 nm), while the N-doped TiO2 exhibits greatly improved absorbance (absorption coefficient: 1.36 × 105 cm−1 at 400 nm). The Eg can be simply calculated from the Tauc plot converted from the absorbance spectrum (inset of Fig. 3a). The Tauc curve consists of (αhv)1/2 on the Y-axis and hν on the x-axis, where α is the absorbance and hν is the photon energy calculated by 1240/wavelength. The Eg of N-doped TiO2, estimated by linear extrapolation of the Tauc curve is approximately 2.75 eV, much less than undoped TiO2 (∼3.2 eV). The band structure can be seen in Fig. 3b. The modification of the Eg originates from the generation of a new energy state (N 2p) near the valence band of anatase phase TiO2 as a result of N-doping (Fig. 3b). Considering the relatively lower Eg of the N-doped TiO2 compared to undoped TiO2, the upper limit of the absorption wavelength can be extended to the visible wavelength (∼450 nm). Fig. 3c compares the transmittance spectra of unstructured solid films versus 3D nanostructured films. The TiO2 layer thickness of all films is ∼40 nm. Due to the presence of numerous scattering centers resulting from porous nanostructures, the transmittance of 3D nanostructured films is significantly lower than that of unstructured solid films.17 For example, the transmittance of the N-doped TiO2 solid film and the 3D N-doped TiO2 film is 83.34% and 20.02% at a wavelength of 450 nm, respectively. This means that the repetitive light scattering within the 3D N-doped TiO2 film can give more light absorption opportunities and can make a synergy with enhanced visible light absorption through N-doping.

Fig. 4 shows the photocatalytic activity and reusability of the 3D N-doped TiO2 film. The photocatalytic activity is evaluated by the decomposition ability of methylene blue (MB) solution. When exposed to solar irradiation with a wavelength range of 200 to 2500 nm and a power density of 1 mW cm−2 at a wavelength of 525 nm for 3 h, the absorbance change of MB solution containing the 3D N-doped TiO2 film is approximately 50%, which is higher than reference samples (unstructured TiO2 film and undoped 3D TiO2 film) (Fig. 4a–c). This means that the photocatalytic decomposition of the organic matter occurs more rapidly due to the enhanced light absorption and surface area, resulting in a rapid decrease in the concentration ratio (C/C0) of the MB solution (Fig. S3†). The measured decomposition ratio of the 3D N-doped TiO2 film is 134% higher than the unstructured N-doped TiO2 film and 33% higher than the undoped 3D TiO2 film (Fig. 4d). One notable thing is that the difference in the decomposition ratio between undoped TiO2 and N-doped TiO2, whether nanostructured or not, is negligible when irradiated with a UV lamp (∼1.5 mW cm−2 at a wavelength of 365 nm), unlike when irradiated with a solar lamp. The possible explanation is low quantum efficiency of N–TiO2 by a decreased potential of photo-induced holes18 and increased recombination ratio of electrons and holes19 at a generated defect site, such as an oxygen vacancy or Ti3+. Nevertheless, this result clearly reveals that the improvement of the photocatalytic activity is mainly due to the enhancement of visible light absorption as a result of N-doping (Fig. 4d and S4†), and this enhancement is accelerated by the 3D nanostructure. In addition, 3D N-doped TiO2 has a monolithic form that allows it to be semi-permanently reused as a highly efficient visible photocatalyst without concern about performance degradation and collection after use (Fig. 4e). The periodic porous nanostructure of 3D N-doped TiO2 still remains fine even after 5 times reuse as a photocatalyst, and no pore clogging or structural collapse occurs at all (Fig. 4f).

Conclusion
We report a new type of photocatalyst made of 3D nanostructured N-doped TiO2, chemically converted from TiN through thermal oxidation at 550 °C, with greatly enhanced visible light absorption. Through N-doping, the Eg of N–TiO2 can be reduced from 3.2 eV to 2.75 eV, resulting in 15.6 times increased absorbance at a wavelength of 450 nm. In addition, the photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation is significantly improved (2.5 times) compared to the unstructured and undoped case. Furthermore, the sample can be reused repeatedly without degradation in photocatalytic activity more than 5 times, unlike conventional particle-type photocatalysts. Thus, the 3D N-doped TiO2 developed here can be considered as a potential candidate for an eco-friendly photocatalyst that actually operates under natural sunlight.
