    , Accepted 17th April 2020First published on 17th April 2020AbstractIn this work, a new kind of CdS/CdSe/CuS hollow nanospheres (HNPs) is successfully synthesized by one-step synthesis via vulcanization and selenization in aqueous solution, without using any additional templates, for the first time. The three components of CdS, CdSe and CuS in the HNPs are thoroughly combinated with each other at nano-scale, which creates a large quantity of intimate contact interfaces. As a result, the optimal CdSe30Cu2S HNPs exhibit an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 723 μmol h−1 (10 mg of catalyst) without adding any noble metal co-catalysts, which is 6.5 times higher than that of the pristine CdS HNPs. The hollow structure enhances the light absorption and provides the inner surface as active sites for the infiltrated water to receive the inner-shell electrons quickly for H2 evolution and the CdS/CdSe/CuS heterostructure with CuS acting as the co-catalyst forms three charge transfer pathways to promote the separation and migration of the photo-induced electrons and holes, resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic performance. This work may provide a strategy for the design and synthesis of other photocatalysts for highly efficient H2 evolution.
1. Introduction
With the imminent global energy crisis and environmental pollution, hydrogen energy being a clean energy source with high energy density has drawn extensive attention. Since Fujishima and Honda first discovered hydrogen production on a TiO2 photoelectrode,1 photocatalytic water-splitting over semiconductors provides an eco-friendly and promising way to convert solar energy into hydrogen energy. In the past decades, different kinds of semiconductors have been utilized as photocatalysts for hydrogen production by splitting water, but most of the photocatalysts can only absorb UV light due to the wide band gap, resulting in low efficiency for solar energy conversion. Owing to the narrow band gap (2.4 eV) and appropriate band position, CdS has been regarded as an ideal candidate for photocatalytic H2 evolution.2–4 However, pristine CdS without modification is still far from meeting the requirements of practical application due to the limited visible-light harvesting ability and fast recombination of the photo-generated electrons and holes.5 Therefore, a number of strategies such as morphology control,6,7 heterostructure fabrication8–10 and co-catalyst loading11–18 have been applied to overcome the disadvantages of CdS.
Morphology control is considered as an effective way to enhance the separation efficiency of charge carriers. The photocatalysts with hollow structure have drawn increasing attention owing to the low density, enhanced light absorption, excellent dispersion and sufficient active sites.19,20 To date, various researches focusing on TiO213,21–23 and CdS HNPs24–26 have been reported. However, most of these HNPs were prepared by using sacrificial templates such as silica13,22–25 and carbon nanospheres,21 which should be removed by a subsequent dissolution or calcination process. This additional process introduces several drawbacks such as redundant steps and high cost. So far, there is no report on the CdS HNPs prepared without additional templates for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Besides, another feasible strategy to facilitate the separation and migration of the photo-generated electrons and holes is to form a heterojunction between CdS and other semiconductors.27,28 Among the heterojunctions, CdS/CdSe is becoming a research hotspot as it generally exhibits high photocatalytic performance due to the improved light-harvesting efficiency and reduced charge recombination. However, all the reports about the CdS/CdSe heterojunction were focused on the CdS/CdSe quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS/CdSe core/shell QDs,29 CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs30–33 and CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod nanorods.34 Additionally, most of the QDs were synthesized in an inorganic system by several steps under the conditions of vacuum and heating, where the obtained QDs needed to be exchanged by hydrophilic ligands to realize water-solubility for H2 evolution and stored in solution to avoid agglomeration.35,36 The above method brings many shortcomings such as complicated synthesis process, poor yield and low reclamation,35 which severely restricts the practical application of the CdS/CdSe photocatalysts. One-step synthesis of the CdS/CdSe composites in aqueous solution may be an ideal choice to overcome the above shortcomings.35 In addition, co-catalyst loading is regarded as an efficient approach, which is usually used to suppress the recombination of charge carriers. The most frequently reported co-catalysts are noble metals, such as Pt,37–40 Au24,41–44 and Pd,19,45 due to high work function and excellent charge mobility. However, the co-catalysts are commonly loaded on the outer surface of the photocatalysts,24,46 resulting in limited interface contact between the co-catalysts and photocatalysts, which is disadvantageous for the transfer of photo-induced electrons and holes. Meanwhile, the reserve of noble metals is extremely limited, leading to their high price and making it difficult for large-scale use. It is worth noting that the non-noble metal sulfides such as MoS2,47–54 CuS55–59 and NiS60–62 have also been employed as effective co-catalysts to enhance the photocatalytic performance.
In this work, a new kind of CdS/CdSe/CuS HNPs were successfully prepared by one-step synthesis via vulcanization and selenization in aqueous solution, without using any additional templates, for the first time. The loading amount of CdSe and CuS can be accurately adjusted by the adding amount of Na2SeSO3 and CuCl2, respectively. The optimal CdSe30Cu2S HNPs displayed an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 723 μmol h−1 without adding any noble metal co-catalysts, which is 6.5 times higher than that of the pristine CdS HNPs. The AQE reached 13.3% at 365 nm wavelength. The reasons for the notably enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution rate were investigated in detail.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of Cd(OH)Cl nanospheres
The Cd(OH)Cl nanospheres were synthesized by using a simple method as reported in a previous report.63 In a typical procedure, 25 mL NaOH solution (1 M) was firstly added dropwise to 25 mL CdCl2 solution (1 M) including 1 wt% polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) under vigorous stirring. After half an hour, the mixture was transferred into an oil bath and the temperature was kept at 90 °C for 12 h. The precipitate was obtained by filtration and was then washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times. Finally, the product was dried at 60 °C for 12 h in an oven, yielding the Cd(OH)Cl nanospheres.
2.2. Synthesis of CdS hollow nanospheres
Firstly, 285.3 mg Cd(OH)Cl nanospheres were added into 30 mL distilled water under vigorous stirring. Then, 144.6 mg thioacetamide was added slowly into the above solution to produce yellow precipitation and the reaction was conducted for half an hour. Finally, the obtained precipitate was washed with distilled water and ethanol and was then dried at 60 °C for 12 h in an oven, resulting in the CdS HNPs.
2.3. Synthesis of CdS/CdSe, CdS/CuS, and CdS/CdSe/CuS HNPs
The preparation of the CdS/CdSe HNPs was same as the synthesis of the CdS HNPs except that a certain volume of Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution was added simultaneously into 30 mL aqueous solution. The mole ratio of CdSe to CdS was controlled by the added volume of Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution while the amount of the Cd(OH)Cl nanospheres was maintained invariant (285.3 mg). Therefore, the obtained CdS/CdSe HNPs with different mole ratios of CdSe to CdS (10 at%, 20 at%, 30 at% and 40 at%) were denoted as CdSe10S, CdSe20S, CdSe30S and CdSe40S, respectively. Similarly, the CdS/CuS HNPs were synthesized in the same way as the preparation of the CdS/CdSe HNPs except that the Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution was replaced by CuCl2 and the obtained samples with different mole ratios of CuS to CdS (1 at%, 2 at% and 5 at%) were marked as CdCu1S, CdCu2S and CdCu5S, respectively. The CdS/CdSe/CuS HNPs were synthesized in the same way as the preparation of the CdS HNPs except that both the optimal volume of Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution and the optimal amount of CuCl2 were added simultaneously into 30 mL aqueous solution. The obtained CdS/CdSe/CuS HNPs with a mole ratio of CdSe to CdS (30 at%) and mole ratio of CuS to CdS (2 at%) were labelled as CdSe30Cu2S. The synthetic procedure of the CdSe30Cu2S sample by simultaneous vulcanization and selenization is shown in Scheme 1.

2.4. Synthesis of CuS nanoparticles
The pristine CuS nanoparticles were prepared as follows: firstly, 891.5 mg CuCl2 was dispersed into 30 mL distilled water under vigorous stirring for 1 h. Then, 589.3 mg thioacemide was added slowly into the solution to produce black precipitation and the reaction was performed for half an hour. Finally, the obtained black precipitate was washed with distilled water and ethanol and was then dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven, resulting in the CuS nanoparticles.
2.5. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation of 1.5418 Å with a voltage of 40 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded on a FEI Quanta 250 SEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were measured on a JEOL JEM2100 TEM operated at 200 kV. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were recorded by a V-670 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB spectrometer. The specific surface area and pore distribution were obtained on a Quantachrome Autosorb IQ analyzer.
2.6. Photocatalytic measurements
The photocatalytic water splitting reaction was conducted in a top-irradiation quartz cell connected to a closed glass gas circulation system (CEL-SPH2N, Beijing). 10 mg sample was dispersed in 25 mL distilled water containing 0.35 M sodium sulfide and 0.25 M sodium sulfite as the sacrificial agents. A 225 W Xe lamp was used as the simulated solar light source and each measurement was carried out for 3 h. The amount of H2 evolution was analyzed by a TCD gas phase chromatograph (GC-9720) where nitrogen (N2) was used as the carrier gas. The temperature of the reaction solution was kept at 6 °C by a water-cooling circulation system.
2.7. Photoelectrochemical measurement
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photocurrent experiments were conducted by using an electrochemical work-station (CHI 660E) in a standard three-electrode quartz cell. The photocatalyst-coated FTO was used as the working electrode, Pt plate as the counter electrode and saturation calomel electrode as the reference electrode. A 225 W Xe lamp was taken as the simulated solar light source for the photocurrent experiment, and the light was switched on and off in every 20 s. The electrolyte was 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution.
3. Results and discussion
XRD was measured to investigate the crystal structure of the as-synthesized photocatalysts. All the diffraction peaks of the Cd(OH)Cl nanospheres (Fig. S1a†) were indexed to the hexagonal Cd(OH)Cl phase (JCPDS 74-1047). As shown in Fig. 1, the diffraction peaks of the CdS HNPs showed the typical diffraction peaks of the hexagonal CdS phase (JCPDS41-1049). The other hollow sphere samples, such as CdSe30S, CdCu2S and CdSe30Cu2S exhibited similar diffraction peaks as the CdS HNPs except that their diffraction peaks were wider than that of the CdS HNPs, suggesting that the introduction of Se or/and Cu may result in the decline of crystallinity.56 Moreover, the peak intensity of these samples decreased gradually with the increasing amount of Se or Cu (Fig. S2a and b†). For the diffraction peaks of CdS/CdSe composite, there were no obvious peaks of CdSe owing to the low crystallinity of CdSe.35 No obvious diffraction peaks of CuS were observed for the CdS/CuS composite, probably because the addition of CuS is too small.64 As for the reference sample, the CuS nanoparticles exhibited the typical diffraction peaks of the hexagonal CuS phase (JCPDS 75-2235, Fig. S2c†).

The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples were investigated by TEM and SEM characterizations. As the precursor, Cd(OH)Cl exhibited spherical morphology with a diameter of about 100–300 nm (Fig. S1b†). The interior of the nanosphere was hollowed out to constitute the hollow spherical structure by vulcanization treatment with thioacetamide. As shown in Fig. 2a, pristine CdS showed the hollow spherical structure with an outer diameter of about 100–300 nm and a wall thickness of about 25 nm. Different from the smooth surface of the Cd(OH)Cl nanospheres, the surface of CdS HNPs was more round and rough and some small nanoparticles could be observed, which can be ascribed to the fact that the CdS HNPs were constituted by numerous nanoparticles with a diameter of about 6 nm. Besides, the HRTEM image of the pristine CdS HNPs in Fig. 2b depicts a lattice fringe of 0.336 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of the hexagonal CdS phase,19 verifying that Cd(OH)Cl has been converted to CdS by the vulcanization treatment, which is in accordance with the result of XRD. When Na2SeSO3 or/and CuCl2 was added to participate in the vulcanization of Cd(OH)Cl, the obtained CdS/CdSe (Fig. S3a†), CdS/CuS (Fig. S3c†), and CdS/CdSe/CuS (Fig. 2c) retained the hollow spherical structure with nearly the same diameter and rough surface. For the CdS/CdSe/CuS composite (Fig. 2c–f), the inter-planar spacing of 0.336 nm matched well with the (002) plane of the hexagonal CdS phase, and the lattice fringes of 0.35 and 0.18 nm corresponded to the (002) and (201) planes of the hexagonal CdSe phase,65 respectively. Meanwhile, the other inter-planar spacings of 0.32 and 0.326 nm were in good agreement with the (101) and (100) planes of the hexagonal CuS phase,56 respectively. The three components connected intimately with each other to create close contact interfaces of CdS–CdSe (Fig. 2d), CdS–CuS (Fig. 2e) and CdS–CdSe–CuS (Fig. 2f), resulting in a ternary heterostructure. Additionally, as the reference sample, the pristine CuS exhibited relatively homogeneous granular structure with a diameter of 5–15 nm (Fig. 2g), and the lattice fringe of 0.32 nm corresponded to the (101) plane of the hexagonal CuS phase (Fig. 2h).

The SEM images of the as-prepared samples (Fig. S4†) exhibited the same morphological features as that displayed by the TEM images. The following points can be summarized from the SEM images. Firstly, all the samples showed a hollow spherical structure. Then, with the addition of CdSe, the surface of the hollow nanospheres became rougher and grew a few nanoparticles, which can be attributed to the external CdSe nanoparticles. As a result, both the specific surface areas (SBET) of the CdSe30S (73.38 m2 g−1) and CdSe30Cu2S (74.80 m2 g−1) samples (Fig. S5 and Table S1†) were obviously larger than that of the CdS HNPs (29.41 m2 g−1).
HAADF STEM imaging (Fig. 3a) and EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 3b–e) was used to further investigate the CdSe30Cu2S sample. The Cd and S mappings confirmed that the CdSe30Cu2S sample exhibited a hollow spherical structure (Fig. 3b and c). The density of the colored dots, which represented the concentration of the elements, was obviously lower in the Se and Cu mappings in comparison with that of the Cd and S mappings (Fig. 3d and e). Moreover, the dots representing the Se and Cu elements were uniformly distributed throughout the hollow nanosphere. In addition, no obvious interface between the distribution of Se (or/and Cu) and Cd (or/and S) was observed, suggesting that CdSe and CuS were adequately combined with CdS at nano-scale, which is distinctly different from the mostly used vulcanization method.66 For the other vulcanization method, the vulcanizing agent (thioacetamide, here) was added during the sulfidizing process without adding the precursors of target selenide and sulfide (Na2SeSO3 and CuCl2 in this work), which usually resulted in a clear and limited contact interface between the vulcanized product and the precursor and is unfavorable for the migration of the photo-generated electrons and holes. The percentages of S, Cd, Se and Cu in the as-synthesized samples were confirmed by EDX, and the results are displayed in Fig. S6 and Table S2.† Obviously, the measured percentages of Se and Cu in the as-synthesized samples were close to their dosages, indicating that the added Na2SeSO3 and CuCl2 were successfully transformed into CdSe and CuS, respectively.

XPS of the CdSe30Cu2S sample was carried out to investigate the chemical composition and elemental valence state. As shown in Fig. 4a, the XPS survey spectrum verified the presence of Cd, S, Se, Cu, O, and C. The peak at 284.6 eV related to the C 1s, which may come mainly from the double side tape used for the preparation of the test sample and the CO2 adsorbed on the surface of the sample.16 The O 1s peak may come from the O2 and H2O adsorbed on the surface of the sample.67 Two binding energy peaks at 405.2 and 420.0 eV appeared in the spectrum of Cd 3d (Fig. 4b), corresponding to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively, indicating the +2 oxidation state of Cd.19 The spectrum of S 2p can be fitted into three peaks at 160.5, 161.6 and 162.8 eV (Fig. 4c), confirming the presence of S2− species in the sample.19 Besides, the spectrum of Se 3d exhibited a peak at 54.4 eV (Fig. 4d), which was in accordance to the common distribution of the Se 3d peak position, suggesting the existence of Se2− in the sample.68 Additionally, the two peaks centered at 932.4 and 952.5 eV in the spectrum of Cu 2p were assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 (Fig. 4e), respectively, indicating the presence of Cu2+ in the sample.69 All of the above results confirm the successful preparation of the CdS/CdSe/CuS heterostructure.

The optical absorption properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As displayed in Fig. 5a, the pristine CdS HNPs exhibited high light absorbance from the UV to the visible light region (200–600 nm) because of the narrow band gap (2.4 eV).70 By coupling with CdSe, the CdSe30S sample displayed slightly enhanced absorption in the entire region (200–800 nm) due to the narrower band gap of CdSe (1.7 eV).29,34 Compared with the pristine CdS HNPs, the CdCu2S sample showed a slight decline in the 200–500 nm wavelength range, however, exhibited an obviously enhanced absorption in the 500–800 nm, owing to the strong optical absorption ability of CuS.71 As for the ternary CdS/CdSe/CuS composite, the CdSe30Cu2S sample presented a slight increase in the 200–500 nm region and a remarkable red shift in the 500–800 nm region, possessing the synergistic absorption feature of all the components. Additionally, the band gaps of the as-prepared samples were estimated by using the equation α(hν) = A(hν − Eg)1/2, (where α, hν, A, and Eg is the absorption coefficient, photon energy, a constant and band gap energy, respectively) and the results are shown in Fig. S7 and Table S3.†

The photocatalytic H2 evolution rates over these samples were measured under simulated solar light irradiation (320–780 nm) without the addition of any other co-catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5b, the pristine CdS HNPs exhibited a relatively high H2 evolution rate (111 μmol h−1), which is higher than that of the other CdS with different morphology, such as nanospheres, nanorods, and nanobelts.12,40,50 The reason for the high H2 evolution rate of the CdS HNPs can be ascribed to the hollow spherical structure, which can provide the inner surface of the nanospheres as active sites to receive the electrons for H2 evolution, promoting the separation and transfer of charge carries. After combining with CdSe, the H2 evolution rates of the CdS/CdSe HNPs were obviously increased and varied with different mole ratios of CdSe to CdS. As shown in Fig. S8a,† based on the photocatalytic H2 evolution tests over the CdS/CdSe HNPs with different CdSe loading amount, the best CdSe/CdS ratio was determined to be 30 at% and the corresponding H2 evolution rate of the CdSe30S sample reached 395 μmol h−1. It seems reasonable that the appropriate addition of CdSe can construct an efficient heterojunction with CdS to suppress the recombination of the photo-generated electrons and holes while excessive CdSe is unfavorable for the improvement of the photocatalytic H2 evolution due to the decline in crystallinity. Similarly, owing to the addition of CuS, the CdS/CuS HNPs exhibited improved photocatalytic activity in comparison with the pristine CdS HNPs (Fig. S8b†) and the optimal CuS/CdS ratio was confirmed to be 2 at%, indicating the fact that the amount of CuS also has an effect on the photocatalytic performance of the CdS/CuS HNPs. As an efficient electron-capturing co-catalyst,55,56 the moderate addition of CuS can effectively capture the electrons from the conduction band of CdS to generate hydrogen, promoting the separation and migration of charge carriers while the redundant CuS may reduce the amount of the photo-generated electrons and holes due to the metallicity of CuS, resulting in the decline of the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, it is worth noting that the CdSe30Cu2S sample exhibited the maximum H2 evolution rate of 723 μmol h−1, which is 6.5 times higher than that of the pristine CdS HNPs, owing to the synergistic effect of CdSe and CuS. We retrieved the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates over different CdS-based photocatalysts widely reported in the literatures (Table S4†), and found that the value of 723 μmol h−1 is relatively high in the CdS-based non-noble metal system. Additionally, the corresponding time courses of H2 evolution over these samples are shown in Fig. S9,† where the H2 evolution increased almost linearly with time for all the samples.
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) over the CdSe30Cu2S sample at different wavelengths (365, 380, 420, and 500 nm) was also measured. The measurement and calculation of AQE are described in detail in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 5c, the CdSe30Cu2S sample exhibited the highest AQE value of 13.3% at the wavelength of 365 nm and the AQE declined gradually with the increasing wavelength. The corresponding values of AQE at different wavelengths are displayed in Table S5.† Additionally, to reveal the stability of the photocatalyst, the cyclic photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the CdSe30Cu2S sample was conducted. Each cycle was measured for 3 h under the same conditions. As displayed in Fig. 5d, the H2 evolution rate remained almost unchanged after six cycles (18 h), confirming the excellent photocatalytic stability and recyclability of the CdSe30Cu2S sample. Moreover, as shown in Fig.S10,† the XRD pattern of the recycled CdSe30Cu2S sample exhibited no obvious change in comparison with the fresh sample, powerfully verifying its excellent photocatalytic stability.
In order to investigate the separation and migration ability of charge carriers, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) was performed over the as-prepared samples with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. As displayed in Fig. 6a, the pristine CdS HNPs exhibited the highest PL intensity due to the quick recombination of the photo-induced electrons and holes. After loading CdSe, the CdSe30S HNPs showed a lower PL intensity than that of the pristine CdS HNPs, suggesting that the recombination of the photo-induced electrons and holes can be effectively inhibited by the CdS/CdSe heterostructure. Similarly, owing to the addition of CuS, the PL intensity of the CdCu2S HNPs exhibited an obvious decline in comparison with the pristine CdS HNPs, indicating that the heterostructure formed between CdS and CuS can efficiently promote the separation of charge carriers. Besides, the CdSe30Cu2S HNPs displayed the lowest PL intensity, in accordance with its highest H2 evolution rate. It can be concluded that the ternary CdS/CdSe/CuS heterostructure can greatly facilitate the charge separation and migration.
 Fig. 6  PL spectra (a), transient photocurrent responses (b) and electrochemical impedance spectra (c) of the as-synthesized samples. 
The transient photocurrent responses (TPRs) over the as-synthesized samples were conducted under the irradiation of simulated solar light. As shown in Fig. 6b, the pristine CdS HNPs exhibited the lowest photocurrent response owing to the fast recombination of the photo-generated charge carriers. The CdSe30S HNPs presented an improved photocurrent response in comparison with the pristine CdS HNPs, which can be attributed to the more efficient mobility of the photo-generated electrons and holes resulting from the heterostructure consisting of CdS and CdSe. Similarly, due to the addition of CuS, the CdCu2S HNPs showed a higher photocurrent response than that of the pristine CdS HNPs, demonstrating the enhanced separation and migration of charge carriers. Due to the synergistic effect of CdSe and CuS, the CdSe30Cu2S HNPs displayed the highest photocurrent response, which matched well with the above results of H2 evolution rate and PL spectra. In addition, the ability of charge migration over these samples was further confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Normally, there is a positive correlation between the semicircle radius in the Nyquist plot and charge transfer resistance.72 As displayed in Fig. 6c, the CdSe30Cu2S HNPs possessed the smallest semicircle radius among all the samples, suggesting the lowest charge transfer resistance. The photocatalytic performance of these samples were well consistent with the results of PL, TPR and EIS measurements, indicating that the best photocatalytic performance of the CdSe30Cu2S HNPs corresponding to the strongest separation and migration ability of the photo-generated electrons and holes can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of CdS/CdSe heterostructure and CuS acting as an electron-capturing co-catalyst.
Based on the above experimental results, the possible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the CdSe30Cu2S HNPs is illustrated in Scheme 2. The Mott–Schottky plots of CdS and CdSe were measured to estimate the band positions. As shown in Fig. S11,† the Mott–Schottky plot of CdS exhibited a positive slope with a flat band potential (Efb) of about −0.34 V versus the Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE) and the Mott–Schottky plot of CdSe displayed a positive slope with a Efb of −0.24 V versus the NHE. In general, the conduction band (CB) is approximately equal to the Efb. Besides, the mentioned band gaps of CdS and CdSe were 2.4 eV and 1.7 eV,29,34,70 respectively. Then, the valence band (VB) values of CdS and CdSe can be calculated to be 2.06 and 1.46 V versus NHE, respectively. It has been confirmed by the TEM image of the CdSe30Cu2S HNPs that three interfaces (CdS/CdSe, CdS/CuS and CdS/CdSe/CuS interface) have been created in the ternary CdSe30Cu2S heterostructure, which can construct three pathways for the transmission of the photo-generated electrons and holes. At the interface between CdS and CdSe, the excited electrons migrate from the conduction band (CB) of CdS to the CB of CdSe and then react with H+ to produce H2 while the holes are transferred from the valence band (VB) of CdS to the VB of CdSe, resulting in a type-I heterojuntion (pathway I). At the CdS/CuS interface, the CuS co-catalyst captures the electrons from the CB of CdS to generate H2 (ref. 55 and 56) while the holes in the VB of CdS react with the sacrificial agents (pathway II). For the ternary CdS/CdSe/CuS interface, the electrons are transmitted from the CB of CdS to the CB of CdSe and finally reach CuS to produce H2 while the holes from the VB of CdS migrate to the VB of CdSe and then react with the sacrificial agents (pathway III). According to the above analysis, the hollow structure and ternary CdS/CdSe/CuS heterostructure acted synergistically to improve the photocatalytic activity. The hollow structure enhanced the light absorption and provided the inner surface as active sites for the infiltrated water to receive the inner-shell electrons quickly for H2 evolution and the CdS/CdSe/CuS heterostructure formed three pathways to promote the separation and migration of the photo-induced electrons and holes.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a new kind of CdS/CdSe/CuS HNPs was successfully synthesized from the Cd(OH)Cl nanospheres by one-step synthesis via vulcanization and selenization in aqueous solution. The loading amount of CdSe and CuS can be accurately adjusted by the adding amount of Na2SeSO3 and CuCl2, respectively. The optimal CdSe30Cu2S HNPs displayed an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 723 μmol h−1 without adding any noble metal co-catalysts, which is 6.5 times higher than that of the pristine CdS HNPs, and the highest AQE reached 13.3% at the wavelength of 365 nm. Moreover, the CdSe30Cu2S HNPs exhibited superior stability for the photocatalytic H2 evolution within six cycles in 18 h. The hollow structure and ternary CdS/CdSe/CuS heterostructure can efficiently inhibit the recombination of charge carriers, resulting in the improved photocatalytic performance. This work may provide new insights for the design of highly efficient and stable photocatalysts for solar energy conversion.
