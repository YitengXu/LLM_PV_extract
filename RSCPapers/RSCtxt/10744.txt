    , Accepted 9th October 2014First published on 9th October 2014AbstractDirectly converting CO2 to hydrocarbons offers a potential route for carbon-neutral energy technologies. Here we report a novel design, integrating the high-temperature CO2–H2O co-electrolysis and low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch synthesis in a single tubular unit, for the direct synthesis of methane from CO2 with a substantial yield of 11.84%.

Broader context
The rapid increase of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide as a result of the extensive consumption of fossil fuels to meet the ever-increasing energy demand has led to serious environmental concerns worldwide. Thus, the efficient management and utilization of carbon dioxide is a paramount challenge. Co-electrolysis of steam and CO2 in a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) is a promising solution to convert CO2 to syngas, a mixture of H2 and CO. It is also an effective storage medium for intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal heat. Furthermore, syngas is an important feedstock for hydrocarbon synthesis through the Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) process. Consequently, by integrating the co-electrolysis with F–T synthesis in a single unit, a carbon neutral sustainable energy supply can be achieved. However, these two processes have very different optimal operating temperatures; SOECs prefer temperatures above 600 °C while F–T synthesis prefers below 350 °C. The substantial difference makes the integration very challenging. In this contribution, we present a novel design for direct synthesis of methane in a single tubular unit, demonstrating excellent integration of SOEC for CO2–H2O co-electrolysis at 800 °C and an F–T reactor for methanation at temperatures down to 250 °C.

Global advances in fossil-fuel-driven industrialization exacerbate various disquieting problems, particularly, increased scarcity of nonrenewable energy resources and heightened levels of atmospheric CO2. Worldwide oil consumption has reached more than 90 million barrels per day, and still continues to increase at a considerable rate.1 At the same time, burning fossil fuels emits a significant amount of greenhouse gas, and the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased by 27% from 310 to 395 ppm during the past 60 years.2 It has been widely accepted that the increased atmospheric CO2 content is the major contributor to global warming and should be responsible for more and more intense weather phenomena and natural disasters. Consequently, alternative fuels and carbon-neutral energy technologies are indispensable in order to alleviate and potentially solve these energy and environmental problems. Co-electrolyzing CO2 and steam using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal heat is an efficient route for conversion of CO2 into a syngas consisting of CO and H2,3–5 which can be further used to produce hydrocarbons with the Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) process.6 Therefore, combining SOEC and F–T processes provides not only scalable energy storage means to solve the intermittency issues related to typical renewable power sources, but also an environmentally friendly solution to achieve quasi-carbon neutral fuel and chemical production with recycled CO2. The combination is encouraged by nickel, which is the most widely applied electrocatalyst for SOECs7 as well as the typical methanation catalyst for F–T synthesis. Methane, the main component of natural gas, has extensive industrial uses. Consequently, integrating the two processes in a single unit creates a novel strategy to convert CO2–H2O directly into methane.
However, there are technical challenges to effectively integrate the SOEC and F–T processes. High temperature (600–1000 °C) operation is preferred for SOECs due to favourable thermodynamics and kinetics considerations. The thermodynamic benefit is a decrease in the molar Gibbs energy of the reaction with an increase of temperature while the molar enthalpy remains almost constant.8 On the contrary, the F–T process of methanation is often conducted at low temperatures, typically 200–300 °C, to achieve high CH4 yield since COx hydrogenation is strongly exothermic and thus thermodynamically favoured at reduced temperatures. Therefore, integrating the SOEC and F–T methanation, which are favoured in different temperature ranges in a single unit, has to compromise on the operation temperature. For example, 650 °C for the previously reported units.9–11 Such temperature is selected to allow SOEC to be operated with reasonable efficiency to generate adequate syngas, but extremely impedes the methanation reaction. Consequently, only 0.2% CH4 yield has been detected in a planar SOEC configuration of LSM–Ce0.9Gd0.1O2−δ/YSZ/La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+δ, where LSM is strontium doped lanthanum manganate, the electrocatalyst for the air electrode, YSZ is 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia, the electrolyte, and La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+δ is the catalyst for the fuel electrode.9 A similar yield of 0.286% is reported for a planar unit of LSM–ScSZ/ScSZ/Ni–ScSZ/Ni–YSZ, in which ScYZ is scandia stabilized zirconia, the electrolyte.11 The CH4 yield has to be substantially improved for practical applications.
Here, we show a new design of the direct synthesis of methane from CO2–H2O co-electrolysis using a tubular unit, which allows one part be controlled at high temperature for SOEC while the other at reduced temperature for F–T process (Fig. 1, see also S1 in ESI†). This design is capable of conducting various reactions including:

And methanationCO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2OCO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O
The design is realized using a tubular porous Ni–YSZ substrate with a dense YSZ layer. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the cell part is operated at 800 °C while the electrolysis-induced syngas can be directly catalyzed to form methane in the F–T part at temperatures down to 250 °C. The design improves the CH4 yield substantially to 11.84% as well as showing a stable 24 h short-term performance, demonstrating significant progress in the direct CO2–H2O conversion into hydrocarbon.
The schematic diagram and experimental details for the fabrication process of the tubular units are presented in Fig. S2 and S3.†Fig. 2a presents the cross-sectional microstructure of the cell part consisting of a 310 μm thick porous Ni–YSZ fuel electrode, a 12 μm dense YSZ electrolyte and a 30 μm porous LSM–YSZ air electrode. The electrolyte is dense and has intimate bonding with the electrodes. The fuel electrode near the electrolyte is porous with fairly uniform distribution of micro size solids and pores, which provides a large number of three-phase boundaries for the electrochemical reaction. The remaining portion of the Ni–YSZ fuel electrode beneath the active area is very porous with some finger-like pores and microvoids. The porosity is about 55%, high enough for facile gas transportation. The unique porous structure is formed by the modified phase inversion process, the mechanisms and details of which can be found in our previous work.12

The up-right picture is the enlarged microview showing the electrode–electrolyte interfaces. (b) Cell voltage and power density as a function of current density in the fuel cell mode with 20 mL min−1 H2 (2 vol% H2O) as the fuel. The inset is the impedance spectra. (c) I–V curves and corresponding hydrogen production in the electrolysis mode obtained at different humidity and 800 °C using 20 mL min−1 H2 as the steam carrier. 
The electrochemical performance is investigated in the fuel cell mode. Fig. 2b shows the performance when 20 mL min−1 humidified hydrogen is used as the fuel and air as the oxidant. Peak power densities of 0.48, 0.36 and 0.25 W cm−2 are obtained at 800, 750 and 700 °C, respectively. At 800 °C, the cell ohmic resistance is 0.36 Ω cm2 while the total cell polarization resistance is 0.34 Ω cm2. The cell performance is comparable with the typical tubular fuel cells prepared with the phase-inversion process.12–14 The electrochemical performance is further investigated in the electrolysis mode at various steam concentrations using H2 as the steam carrier (Fig. 2c). The cell voltage at zero current density denotes open-circuit voltage (Voc), which decreases with the increase of the steam concentration as predicted from the Nernst equation. With an applied cell voltage of 1.5 V, a current density of 0.61 A cm−2 is observed for 20 vol% H2O and increases to 0.83 A cm−2 for 50 vol% H2O. Moreover, the current–voltage curves do not show any steam starvation phenomenon, demonstrating excellent gas transport property of the fuel electrode with the asymmetric porous microstructures (Fig. 2a and S4†). The corresponding hydrogen production rate is also presented in Fig. 2c. The hydrogen production rate increases with the electrolysis voltage and the humidity. For example, 3.16 mL min−1 cm−2 hydrogen can be achieved at 1.3 V and 40 vol% humidity.

Fig. 3a shows the results of CO2–H2O co-electrolysis. Voc is slight lower than that for H2O electrolysis (Fig. 2c), due to the increased oxygen partial pressure by CO2. The co-electrolysis performance is very close to the H2O electrolysis. For example, at 1.3 V and 40% humidity, the current density is 0.47 and 0.45 A cm−2 for the CO2–H2O (Fig. 3a) and H2O (Fig. 2c), respectively. Previous research has reported that CO2–H2O co-electrolysis is dominated by steam reduction to hydrogen whereas CO2 is reduced to CO by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.15 Assuming 100% current efficiency for steam reduction, 3.24 mL min−1 cm−2 hydrogen can be achieved at 1.3 V and 40 vol% humidity.
 Fig. 3  (a) I–V curves and corresponding hydrogen production in the electrolysis mode obtained at different humidity and 800 °C using ∼15 mL min−1 CO2–H2 (1:6, volume ratio) mixture as the steam carrier. (b) Component percentage in the outlet gas and total CO2 conversion ratio under different operation conditions. Model I: Position A (ESI, Fig. S1,† the whole unit is subjected to 800 °C), Voc, RWGS process only; Model II: Position A, external voltage applied, SOEC and RWGS processes; Model III; Position B (ESI, Fig. S1,† uniform 800 °C zone for SOEC part, 800–250 °C temperature gradient for F–T part), Voc, RWGS and methanation processes; Model IV: Position B, 1.3 V external voltage, SOEC, RWGS and methanation processes. The inlet gas is ∼15 mL min−1 CO2–H2 (1:6, volume ratio) mixture with 20 vol% humidity. 
The tubular unit can be used to conduct the SOEC, methanation and RWGS reactions using Ni as the catalyst (Fig. 3b). When the unit is in Position A (ESI, Fig. S1†), the F–T part and cell part are at the same temperature of 800 °C, which is favoured for the RWGS reaction but too high for the methanation. Under the open circuit conditions, only RWGS takes place (Model I), producing CO (15.98%) from the feeding CO2–H2 mixture. When the unit is under an external electrical field, both RWGS and SOEC are active (Model II). CO production is increased to 17.24% and 18.31% at 1.3 V and 1.5 V, respectively. As mentioned above, the improved CO production is mainly produced from the RWGS reaction through promoted H2 concentration from the electrolysis process. The total CO2 conversion ratio is increased by the electrolysis process from 52.7% for Model I to 66.6 and 75.4% for the Model II at 1.3 V and 1.5 V, respectively. However, no CH4 component can be detected when the unit is in Position A, demonstrating that the methanation reaction cannot proceed at 800 °C. When it is put at Position B (ESI, Fig. S1†), the tubular unit is in a non-uniform temperature field. The cell part is at 800 °C while the F–T part is subject to temperature gradient from 800 to 250 °C. The reduced temperatures are favoured for methanation, and CH4 (5.02%) is obtained at Voc (Model III). Much more CH4 is produced when an external electrical field is applied (Model IV). The CH4 yield is 11.84% at 1.3 V, significantly higher than those reported using planar SOECs at a cell temperature of 650 °C, in which the CH4 yield is only 0.2–0.3%.9,11 The 11.84% yield means 41.0% of CO2 is converted to CH4 through Model IV. It should be noted that a high mechanical stability is expected in Position B although a temperature gradient is applied to the F–T part, where the porous Ni–YSZ and dense YSZ have well matched thermal expansion coefficients.
For the methanation process, the increased CO and H2 concentrations and decreased H2O concentration are kinetically favourable. On the other hand, the reduced temperatures are thermodynamically favourable due to the exothermic process of hydrogenation. Therefore, a remarkable CH4 yield is achieved using the unique design that integrates the two functional chambers in a single tubular unit. This unique design allows the SOEC chamber to operate at 800 °C to increase the H2 concentration and decrease the steam partial pressure. Furthermore, high temperature can improve the electrolysis kinetics as well. Meanwhile, the methanation chamber at reduced temperatures is thermodynamically favourable for CH4 formation. Moreover, the temperature control can be easily realized with a mini-mite furnace (ESI, Fig. S1†). For scaling up test, the exhausted heat could be used to preheat the inlet CO2–H2O to achieve the thermal integration.

Fig. 4 presents the short-term performance of the tubular unit operated in Model IV (for details see Table S1, ESI†). Fig. 4a shows that the current density decreases slightly at first and then is stabilized at 0.42 A cm−2 with the elapsed time. Moreover, both CH4 and CO show a stable yield during the test. The average CH4 yield is 11.40% (0.84 mL min−1) with the total CO2 conversion ratio of 64.1%. The post tested impedance spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also confirm the stable performance under Model IV operating conditions (ESI, Fig. S5 and S6†). Moreover, the by-product (CO–H2 syngas) is also highly valuable and can be further cycled to improve methane yield. Higher hydrocarbons yield may be obtained by further improving the F–T synthesis conditions, such as employing high-efficiency methanation catalysts.

Conclusions
In this work, we have demonstrated a tubular design for direct synthesis of CH4 from CO2–H2O feedstock. This unique design substantially improves CH4 yield to 11.84% by combining the CO2–H2O co-electrolysis and methanation in a single tubular unit. 24 h short-term test shows that the co-electrolysis process presents a generally stable current density at 0.42 A cm−2 during the electrolysis operation while the average CH4 yield can reach 11.40% (0.84 mL min−1) with an overall CO2 conversion ratio of 64.1%. The novel integration of CO2–H2O co-electrolysis and methanation in a single tubular unit presents a significant advancement in hydrogen economy and a carbon neutral renewable energy cycle.
