    , Accepted 22nd August 2022First published on 26th August 2022AbstractCarrier/exciton trapping is detrimental for photovoltaic devices. Self-trapping has been observed in antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3), which has been confirmed to reduce the theoretical energy conversion efficiency in wide-band-gap Sb2S3 (∼1.7 eV) solar cells to nearly half of the Shockley–Queisser limit. This phenomenon raises concern about the photovoltaic performance of antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) in the same family, with the same crystal structure and a low band gap of 1.1–1.3 eV. However, dynamic information on their charge carriers, especially their intrinsic trapping characteristics, remains undiscovered. Herein, we conducted comparative spectral investigations into the carrier dynamics of Sb2Se3 with both anion-rich and cation-rich characteristics. Unlike Sb2S3, the saturation of a trapped carrier-induced absorption process indicates the limited trap states and absence of self-trapping in both the Se-rich and Sb-rich Sb2Se3 films prepared by thermal evaporation under study. Mechanistic investigations reveal how the defect, ionicity and one-dimensional lattice distortion contribute to the carrier trapping behaviour. Furthermore, we find that Se-rich Sb2Se3 enables the effective suppression of trap-assisted recombination and higher photovoltaic energy conversion performance in solar cells. Our study provides novel fundamental understanding regarding the ultrafast dynamic behaviour of carriers in Sb2Se3 films and guidance for the fabrication of high-efficiency Sb2Se3 solar cells.
Introduction
Self-trapping easily occurs in materials with low-dimensional crystal structures and strong carrier–phonon coupling.1 Potential wells with bound states are generated when excessive carriers/excitons deform the lattice and are trapped to form self-trapped polarons, which are localized in the subunits. Small polarons are formed when the polaron wave function lies within the range of the shortest inter-atomic distance. Large polarons are formed when the polaron wave function is delocalized over several unit cells. It is noted that large polarons do not seem to be remarkably detrimental for photovoltaic applications, whereas small polarons limit carrier/exciton transfer and result in carrier/exciton self-trapping.2,3 Furthermore, small polarons with correlated excitons are able to yield broadband light emission, which is significant for photovoltaics.4
Antimony chalcogenides Sb2S(e)3 have received significant attention in solar cell applications due to their excellent visible light absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1) and adjustable band gap in the range of 1.1–1.7 eV.5 Recently, antimony selenosulfide solar cells have made a breakthrough in efficiency of close to 10%.6,7 As a member of antimony chalcogenides, self-trapping has been reported in Sb2S3, which exhibits an upper power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only nearly half of the value obtained from the Shockley–Queisser limit.1 Sb2S3 possesses a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) crystal structure consisting of (Sb4S6)n ribbons that are bound by van der Waals forces (Fig. 1a).8 The low-dimensional soft lattice of Sb2S3 is deformable, which induces carrier self-trapping in Sb2S3. This observation brings forth the assumption that self-trapping would also occur in antimony selenide (Sb2Se3), which possesses an identical crystal structure to Sb2S3 (Fig. 1b). However, the atomic radius of selenium is larger than that of sulfur, and the van der Waals forces within adjacent (Sb4Se6)n ribbons should be stronger than those within adjacent (Sb4S6)n ribbons, which suggests a more difficult lattice deformation in Sb2Se3. In addition, the ionicity of Sb2S3 is considerably larger than that of Sb2Se3. These differences are usually related to the trapping behaviour. Therefore, it would be interesting to probe whether carrier self-trapping is exhibited in Sb2Se3, which would provide critical information on engineering materials for efficient solar cell applications.

There have been a few studies focused on the carrier dynamics in Sb2Se3 film solar cells.9,10 However, the intrinsic carrier trapping behavior of Sb2Se3 has been rarely investigated. Herein, in order to trace the real-time carrier dynamics and determine whether intrinsic self-trapping exists in Sb2Se3, we synthesize both Sb-rich and Se-rich Sb2Se3 thin-films and employ femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) to further study the carrier trapping property from a stoichiometric (i.e., the atomic ratio of Se/Sb) perspective. This ultrafast probing method shows that the dynamics of both free and trapped carriers are at the picosecond level. Three new findings are thus obtained: (1) unlike Sb2S3, there is no carrier/exciton self-trapping in our thermally deposited Sb2Se3 film, even though the soft quasi-1D lattice of Sb2Se3 can yield maximum transient trap states at a ∼1020 cm−3 density, which will act as deep-level recombination centres for charge carriers; (2) the hot carriers relax to the trap states within a few picoseconds after excitation by a pump laser and show enhanced intra-band absorption; (3) the Se-rich Sb2Se3 films show a longer average carrier lifetime and a weaker excited state absorption process than the Sb-rich Sb2Se3 films, which suggests that the Se-rich Sb2Se3 films can effectively reduce the population of trap states and suppress trap-assisted recombination by non-stoichiometric regulation.
Results and discussion
In brief, we employed the thermal evaporation deposition method to synthesize Sb-rich and Se-rich Sb2Se3 films using Sb, Se, and Sb2Se3 powder as precursor materials (detailed synthesis is provided in the Experimental Section, ESI†). We adjusted the Se/Sb atomic ratios of Sb-rich and Se-rich Sb2Se3 to 1.41 and 1.56, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). SEM images show that both the Se-rich and Sb-rich Sb2Se3 films show flat surface morphology without pin holes (Fig. 2a and b). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to characterize the crystal structure of Sb2Se3, showing the typical orthorhombic structure (JCPDS no. 15-0861) of Sb2Se3 without any impurity peaks identified (Fig. 2c).11

In order to further examine the compositional purity of the films, we performed Raman scattering and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization. The Raman spectra (Fig. 2d) show that three characteristic peaks exist in both the Se-rich and Sb-rich films at 152, 190, and 210 cm−1, which correspond to the B2g1, Ag2 and Ag1 vibrational modes of Sb2Se3.12 It is noted that no vibrational mode of Sb2O3 is found (∼451 cm−1).13 Furthermore, two XPS peaks with binding energies of 539.5 eV and 530.2 eV (Fig. 2e and f) are observed, which are attributed to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of Sb3+ in Sb2Se3, respectively. The binding energies of 55.6 eV and 54.8 eV are attributed to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of Se2− in Sb2Se3, respectively.13 Clearly, the fits for the Sb 3d region are well described by a single 3d doublet and no O 1s-fittable features are discovered (which would appear between the two XPS peaks of Sb 3d3/2 and Sb 3d5/2). Similarly, the Se 3d region shows only a single doublet with no other fittable features ascribable to selenium oxides.13,14 Combined with the above characterization results, we confirm that the as-prepared Sb2Se3 films are of high purity. Additionally, the measured optical band gaps of both the Se-rich and Sb-rich Sb2Se3 films are 1.24 eV (Fig. S1, ESI†).
In the TAS measurement, we selected a pump pulse of 360 nm to assure efficient carrier excitation in the Sb2Se3 films, which were probed by a white light continuum in the visible region (Note S1, ESI†). Intra-band electron transition is common in semiconductor materials, and is primarily probed to provide the carrier kinetics.15 The control experiment shows that there is no TA signal observed on the bare substrates, suggesting that the TA signal is from the Sb2Se3 films.
The TAS of the Sb-rich Sb2Se3 thin-film shows a negative TA signal at 580 nm, representing ground state bleaching (GSB), and a positive TA signal at 700 nm, suggesting excited state absorption (ESA) (Fig. 3a). GSB is the process wherein the free electrons at the band-edge state return to the ground state with energy loss. ESA is a process in which the bound charges within the band gap further absorb probe light and transit to a higher energy level. The duration of GSB is fitted to be as short as 0.3 ps (Fig. S2a, Table S2, ESI†). By contrast, the lifetime of ESA is longer and thus dominates the dynamics. Therefore, the GSB process of the charges has a negligible influence on the TA analysis.

The time-resolved ESA spectrum of Sb2Se3 shows the evolution of the carrier dynamics (Fig. 3b). The TA signal of Sb2Se3 rises abruptly from the zero-delay position, which indicates that the ground state electron–hole pairs are excited and transit to the quasi-continuum band to form excitons bound by coulombic attractive forces due to the energy of the pump pulse (∼3.1 eV) being much larger than the band gap of Sb2Se3.16 The excitation process is extremely short, typically at the femtosecond scale. Then, the electron–phonon coupling or electron–electron scattering undergoes rapid relaxation to dissipate the excess excitation energy and the electrons and holes relax to the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM), respectively.17–22 Afterward, the TA reaches its maximum (shown in the pink region) and begins to decay slowly (shown in the green region). Here, the gradual rise in TA shown in pink is due to the enhanced intra-band absorption of the trap states within the band gap. The green region shows the decay of the excited state carriers usually because of carrier recombination or charge transfer. In Sb2Se3 films, the decay at ESA indicates carrier recombination due to the absence of the charge transfer channel, while in heterojunctions with compact interface contacts, the decay indicates long-range charge transfer promoted by the built-in electric field.23 The kinetic decay of the carriers in Sb2Se3 can generally be ascribed to two categories, but the sources causing decay in practical applications are usually complicated.
By adjusting the pump fluence, we obtained a series of dynamic decay traces at various excitation intensities (Fig. 3c). Clearly, the TA shows different decay rates. In particular, the decay exhibits an accelerating trend with a continuous increase in excitation intensity. The variability of the decay rates reflects the difference in the carrier recombination pathways because they are highly dependent on the initial excitation density of the carriers. This suggests that there are at least two different recombination pathways in Sb2Se3, leading to inevitable energy loss. As discussed above, GSB of the free charges at the band-edge state is negligible owing to the short recovery time. In addition, we did not observe significant photoluminescence in the Sb2Se3 films. Therefore, we are able to exclude the direct radiative and non-radiative recombination of free electrons at the CBM and holes at the VBM since the decays of these two recombination pathways remain unchanged and independent of the excitation intensity after mathematically normalized fitting. Hence, this unique pump-dependent decay strongly confirms the presence of trap-assisted recombination, which divides the decay process into two steps, i.e., free charge trapping, followed by electron–hole recombination (Note S2, ESI†). It should be noted that the different decay traces reveal the presence of trap-assisted recombination regardless of whether the electrons or holes are trapped first. Our result indicates that there are huge trap states in the Sb2Se3 lattice. At a low excitation intensity, the TA decays more slowly with a longer carrier lifetime and lower carrier density. It was reported that point defects are easy to form in the Sb2Se3 lattice in both the experimental results and first-principles calculations.24,25 Here, we attribute the dynamic decay to defect-induced recombination at a low excitation intensity, which is common in semiconductor materials and extremely likely to take place due to the low defect formation energy.24–27 Unexpectedly, the TA decays rapidly at higher excitation intensity, which corresponds to a larger photoexcited carrier density. This unusual recombination mechanism will be discussed later.
Keeping the intensity of the probe laser fixed, we investigate the correlation between the pump fluence and the maximum TA value (ΔAmax). The carriers yield ESA owing to photo-induced absorption; thus, the pump fluence can be used to measure the transient carrier density. We can obtain the transient carrier density by the following equation.28 (1)where E represents the energy of the pump beam, α(λ) is the absorption coefficient of the materials at λ, Rpump represents the reflectance of the pump beam, and Aeff is the efficient overlap area between the probe and the pump beam.
Herein, to study whether there is carrier self-trapping in Sb2Se3, we prepared stoichiometric Sb2Se3 films (Se/Sb ∼1.50) by adjusting the addition of Sb or Se in thermal evaporation (Table S1, ESI†). We find that the ΔAmax increases gradually with increasing carrier density, and eventually reaches a plateau (Fig. 3d). Since the excited-state carriers yield ESA with photo-induced absorption, the intensity of ESA can characterize the population of the excited-state carriers. If the population of the excited-state carriers is higher, the absorption of the probe pulse is stronger, which suggests that the ΔAmax is larger. We attribute the ESA at 700 nm to the trapped carrier-induced absorption because of the dominance of trap-assisted recombination. Thus, the appearance of a plateau indicates the limited population of trapped carriers and the absence of self-trapping in the thermally deposited Sb2Se3, which is different from that in Sb2S3. Basically, self-trapping occurs easily in wide-band-gap materials because it is considered the first step of the defect formation mechanism.29 In addition, self-trapping is generally considered in ionic (polar) materials.30 The self-trapping properties of NaCl, KBr, SiO2 and diamond have been studied.31–34 They are divided into three groups according to their difference in ionicity, i.e., pure ionicity (NaCl and KBr), ionicity and covalence mixture (SiO2) and pure covalence (diamond). It is found that self-trapping occurs in NaCl, KBr and SiO2, but not in diamond. In addition, the trapping in NaCl and KBr is a two-step process (i.e., holes are trapped first, electrons are trapped later), while the trapping in SiO2 is a single step process, i.e., electron–hole pair trapping. As mentioned before, self-trapping was observed in Sb2S3 (Fig. 3d). In antimony chalcogenides, the optical band gap of Sb2S3 (1.7–1.8 eV) is larger than that of Sb2Se3 (1.24 eV in this study).35 Additionally, the electronegativities of S, Se, and Sb are 2.5, 2.4, and 1.9, respectively, indicating that the ionicity of Sb2S3 is stronger than that of Sb2Se3. Therefore, the carriers in Sb2Se3 are more difficult to self-trap than those in Sb2S3, even though Sb2Se3 has a smaller elastic constant.36
Although there is no self-trapping in the thermally deposited Sb2Se3 in this study, the increasing ΔAmax before reaching the plateau is clearly visible, and the density of trapped carriers is about 3 × 1020 cm−3 (Fig. 3d). This means that Sb2Se3 can produce trap states with a maximum density of 3 × 1020 cm−3. During the increase in pump fluence, the trap states are continuously filled with photogenerated carriers until they are all occupied finally.
Regarding the Sb-rich Sb2Se3 films, the ΔAmax increases with increasing carrier density and eventually reaches a plateau-like stoichiometric Sb2Se3 (Fig. 4a). The appearance of a plateau also shows the absence of self-trapping in the Sb-rich Sb2Se3 films, and the saturated density of trap states is about 3.5 × 1020 cm−3. According to the results of first-principles calculations, the anion vacancy (VSe) defect has the lowest formation energy, which is below 0.7 eV under Sb-rich conditions; thus, the density of VSe is estimated to be 1014 cm−3 at room temperature.24 This density is much lower than 1020 cm−3; so, the trap states observed by TAS with a density of 1020 cm−3 are not caused by defects in the Sb-rich Sb2Se3. Sb2Se3 possesses a quasi-1D crystal structure, and carriers are easy to transport along the (Sb4Se6)n ribbons. This unique crystal structure endows softness to the Sb2Se3 lattice, which tends to deviate from its original position to undergo lattice deformation. This deformation will generate potential wells that readily trap charges to form polarons within 1020 cm−3 and act as recombination centres for charges.1,30 Even if self-trapping is absent, charge trapping because of this potential well is also inevitable and significantly detrimental. The generation of potential wells is an intrinsic property of the quasi-1D Sb2Se3. Thus, we attribute the accelerated dynamic decay to the recombination mediated by the polarons at high excitation intensity. Herein, we summarize the two fundamental types of trap-assisted recombination present in Sb2Se3: (1) defect-induced recombination at low carrier density and (2) polaron-mediated recombination in the quasi-1D crystal structures at high carrier density. Particularly, the faster decay trace at high carrier density indicates that polaron-mediated recombination is more detrimental to charge transport.

(d) Carrier-trapping dynamics under different excitation intensities (from 84 μJ cm−2 to 585 μJ cm−2) for the Se-rich Sb2Se3 film and their fits by the biexponential model (solid lines). 
The decay of the carrier density can be calculated to obtain the corresponding decay parameters (k1 and k2) by the following equations.37 (2)where N(t) is the carrier density at moment t, k1 is the monomolecular recombination rate coefficient at low carrier density, and k2 is the bimolecular recombination rate coefficient at high carrier density. Since trap-assisted recombination belongs to monomolecular recombination and that is the focus of our research, we pay attention to k1. Based on the pump-dependent decay feature, we chose a low excitation intensity (84 μJ cm−2) to ensure a majority of trap-assisted recombination and obtain a rate coefficient k1 of 3.36 × 10−4 ps−1 (Note S2, ESI†). Herein, we conclude that the dominant recombination pathways of excited carriers can be regulated by adjusting the excitation intensity.
Similarly, the TAS of the Se-rich Sb2Se3 thin-films shows a GSB signal at 580 nm and an ESA signal at 700 nm (Fig. 4b). The duration of GSB is as short as 0.2 ps after fitting (Fig. S2b and Table S2, ESI†). The time-resolved ESA spectrum of the Se-rich Sb2Se3 shows the evolution of the carrier dynamics (Fig. 4c). The TA dynamics of Sb2Se3 also rise from the zero-delay position and reach a maximum gradually (shown in the orange region), then start to decay slowly (shown in the green region). By adjusting the excitation intensities, we obtain a series of decay traces. This shows that the carrier decay in Se-rich Sb2Se3 varies at different intensities, and the decay exhibits an accelerating tendency as the excitation intensities increases continuously (Fig. 4d). Keeping the intensity of the probe laser fixed, we investigated the correlation between carrier concentration and ΔAmax. We also find that the ΔAmax rises gradually with increasing carrier density and eventually reaches a plateau (Fig. 4a). As discussed above, the appearance of a plateau suggests the absence of self-trapping in the thermally deposited Se-rich Sb2Se3 film. Although there is no self-trapping observed, it shows that Se-rich Sb2Se3 can yield trap states with a maximum density of 2.9 × 1020 cm−3.23 According to the literature, the anion-replaced-cation antisite (SeSb) defect has the lowest formation energy, which is below 0.7 eV under Se-rich conditions; thus, the density of SeSb is estimated to be 1014 cm−3 at room temperature.24 This density is much smaller than 1020 cm−3; so, the trap states observed by TAS with a density of 2.9 × 1020 cm−3 are caused by potential wells in Se-rich Sb2Se3. These TA phenomena are almost the same as those in the Sb-rich Sb2Se3 films.
Although no carrier self-trapping is observed in both the thermally deposited Se-rich and Sb-rich Sb2Se3 films under study, their pump-dependent ΔAmax characteristics are completely different (Fig. 4a). It is shown that the ΔAmax of Se-rich Sb2Se3 is always smaller than that of Sb-rich Sb2Se3, especially at high carrier density. Furthermore, the plateau in Se-rich Sb2Se3 appears earlier than that in Sb-rich Sb2Se3, corresponding to carrier densities of 2.9 × 1020 cm−3 and 3.5 × 1020 cm−3. Because of the high excitation intensity generating huge carriers trapped in the lattice, these phenomena indicate that Se-rich Sb2Se3 can reduce the trapped carriers.1 We tried to explore the effect of trap-assisted recombination on the lifetime of excited carriers in both the Se-rich and Sb-rich Sb2Se3 films at an excitation intensity of 84 μJ cm−2. The TA dynamics of Se-rich Sb2Se3 decay slower (Fig. 5a), and the average lifetimes obtained by double-exponential model fitting are ∼4 ns and ∼4.5 ns for Sb-rich and Se-rich Sb2Se3, respectively (Table 1 and Note S1, ESI†). In addition, we determined the fitted constants by the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (Table S3, ESI†), which shows that the values of the fitted constants by the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm do not change notably. Clearly, the carriers in Se-rich Sb2Se3 possess a longer lifetime due to the alleviated carrier recombination, implying that the Se-rich condition can effectively reduce the population of the trap positions. The decay rate coefficient, k1, is calculated to be 1.73 × 10−4 ps−1 in the Se-rich Sb2Se3 films (Note S2, ESI†). In this regard, we conclude that Se-rich Sb2Se3 has a longer carrier lifetime and enables effective suppressing of the trap-assisted carrier recombination taking place in the trap positions, which is essential for the preparation of efficient Sb2Se3 solar cells, by tuning the chemical stoichiometry.

Previous studies have all been based solely on Sb2Se3 films, while the dynamic analysis is aimed at supporting the performance improvement of solar photovoltaic devices. In this case, we tried to explore the capability of charge separation and transfer in heterojunctions based on Sb2Se3 films. Herein, we applied CdS as an electron transporting material and fabricated two kinds of heterojunction structures, i.e., FTO/CdS/(Sb-rich) Sb2Se3 and FTO/CdS/(Se-rich) Sb2Se3, using the thermal evaporation deposition method. The interfacial contact between CdS and Sb2Se3 enables the formation of a built-in electric field, which can enhance the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges at the interface. Defect trapping mostly occurs in Sb2Se3, while charge separation mostly exists at the interface. The two processes take place simultaneously in the operation of solar photovoltaic devices in a competitive manner. The more efficient the charge separation, the more pronounced the inhibitory effect on the carrier trapping, leading to adverse recombination. We expect to strengthen the charge separation and hamper the charge recombination. Here, a suitable excitation intensity was selected to reliably simulate the operating conditions of photovoltaic devices. At this time, the charge separation is dominant because of the built-in electric field at the interface;23 thus, we improve eqn (2) as follows. (3)where N(t) is the carrier concentration at moment t, l1 is the monomolecular recombination rate coefficient at low carrier density, and l2 is the bimolecular recombination rate coefficient at high carrier density. Here, l1 and l2 are able to measure the capability of charge separation.
The TA dynamics of the CdS/Se-rich Sb2Se3 heterojunction decay more quickly (Fig. 5b), and the average lifetimes are ∼2 ns and ∼1.5 ns for CdS/Sb-rich and CdS/Se-rich Sb2Se3, respectively (Table 1), which indicates that Se-rich Sb2Se3 on CdS exhibits faster charge extraction capability. Similarly, we calculated the l1 for Sb-rich and Se-rich Sb2Se3, which are 1.19 × 10−3 ps−1 and 3.33 × 10−3 ps−1, respectively. In order to evaluate the overall competition within charge separation and carrier recombination, we define a new parameter, μ, to denote the competitive relationship between charge separation and the recombination interaction as follows. (4)

μ can reflect the ability of net charge transfer in the heterojunction. We calculated the μ for Sb-rich and Se-rich Sb2Se3 to be 3.54 and 19.25, respectively. It can be concluded that the ability of net charge transfer in the Se-rich Sb2Se3 heterojunction is greater. On this basis, we predict that the Se-rich Sb2Se3 solar cells should exhibit better performance than the Sb-rich Sb2Se3 solar cells.
Therefore, we fabricate solar cells conforming to the FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure (Fig. 6a). The current density–voltage (J–V) response of the best-performing Se-rich and Sb-rich devices was characterized under AM1.5G illumination (Fig. 6b). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) result shows that both the Se-rich and Sb-rich Sb2Se3 devices exhibit photoelectron responses in a broad range from 300 to 1100 nm (Fig. 6c). The identical onset wavelength means an equivalent band gap, which is in good agreement with the UV-vis absorption results. Particularly, the enhanced response at the wavelength range of 500–1100 nm for the Se-rich devices is related to the improved electrical performance of the Sb2Se3 films. In addition, the JSC extracted from EQE and the J–V features of the Sb-rich (22.64 mA cm−2) and Se-rich (25.67 mA cm−2) devices are highly consistent. Fig. S3a–d (ESI†) displays the statistical VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE of the Se-rich and Sb-rich Sb2Se3 solar cells, respectively. The best-performing Se-rich Sb2Se3 solar cell delivers a maximum PCE of 6.2%, VOC of 403 mV, JSC of 25.89 mA cm−2, and FF of 59.52%. In contrast, the best-performing Sb-rich Sb2Se3 solar device only delivers 3.7% of the maximum PCE, in which the VOC is 342 mV, JSC is 22.73 mA cm−2, and FF is 48.32%. Obviously, the Se-rich Sb2Se3 solar cells exhibit superior performance to the Sb-rich Sb2Se3 solar cells, which echoes the above spectral analysis. However, the maximum VOC of the Se-rich Sb2Se3 solar cells is well under the ∼600 mV VOC value from bath-deposited films and the ∼900 mV VOC of Sb2S3 thin-film solar cells, which may be influenced by the thermal evaporation deposition method or interfacial defects with the contacting phase.38–40 In summary, we are able to predict the photovoltaic performance of Sb2Se3 thin-film solar cells by analyzing the carrier dynamics.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have conducted extensive spectral analysis with regard to Sb2Se3 thin-films. TAS results show that the lifetime of band-edge free electrons is only less than one picosecond in Sb2Se3, and more excited carriers will be easier to relax to the trap states within the band gap after excitation by light. Interestingly, we do not observe carrier/exciton self-trapping in both the thermally deposited Sb-rich and Se-rich Sb2Se3 films under study. There are more trap states (∼1020 cm−3) in Sb2Se3, which is due to the inevitable quasi-1D lattice deformation. By adjusting the stoichiometry of Sb2Se3 from Sb-rich to Se-rich, we demonstrate a longer average carrier lifetime and a weaker ESA in Se-rich Sb2Se3, showing that the Se-rich condition can effectively reduce the population of trap states and suppress trap-assisted recombination. In addition, we observed that the as-fabricated Se-rich Sb2Se3 thin-film solar cells display better photovoltaic performance. We finally establish the relationship between the carrier dynamics and thin-film parameters as well as that between the thin-film parameters and device performance. Our study reveals the ultrafast dynamic behaviour and trapping property of carriers in Sb2Se3 thin-films, which offers a practical direction for realizing more efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cells.
