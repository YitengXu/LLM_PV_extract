, Accepted 1st August 2013First published on 5th August 2013AbstractA series of donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers based on furan-bridged benzodithiophene and different acceptor blocks were designed and synthesized. By incorporating various acceptors with differing electron-withdrawing abilities into the same polymer backbone, we were seeking to reveal the correlation between molecular structures and the corresponding film morphology as well as photovoltaic performance. The experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the selection of acceptor units has significant impacts on the polymer energy levels and backbone coplanarity, leading to differing intermolecular packing. By using atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we also observed that the size and topology of the alkyl-chains on acceptors can tune the polymer solubility and result in different film morphology. As a result of optimized morphology, we demonstrated power conversion efficiencies over 5% for the new polymer based devices, which are among the highest efficiencies of reported furan bridged D–A polymers.
1 Introduction
Over the past few decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have emerged and rapidly developed as promising candidates for generating electricity from the abundant and clean solar energy.1 One major obstacle to large-scale commercialization of PSCs is their currently modest power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to commercialized inorganic solar cells. However, impressive progress has been made through the optimization of polymer structures and device fabrication. PCEs of over 7% have been widely reported in recent years.2 Specifically, the best PCE of PSCs has reached over 9%,3 even exceeding 10% with official certification.4 Most efforts have been devoted to the design and synthesis of new p-type conjugated polymers that can simultaneously be sufficiently soluble for processing, in addition to being miscible with the ubiquitous n-type PCBM.5 Alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers are being examined as efficacious polymer candidates due to their easily tunable band gaps, energy levels, planarity and carrier mobility.6 To further enhance the device PCEs by developing new donor polymers the following strategies can be adopted: (1) fine tuning existing well-performing polymers by optimizing the backbone or side-chain structures; (2) incorporating new heterocyclic molecules instead of the classical thiophene block to expand the diversity of organic semiconducting polymers; (3) gaining further knowledge of the correlation between the polymer molecular structure and its optical and electrochemical properties, the morphology of the blend film and the corresponding charge transport as well as the photovoltaic performance of the bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) devices.
Following these strategies, we designed and synthesized a series of D–π–A conjugated polymers sharing the same donor unit bisalkylthienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT-T), which is bridged with different acceptors by a novel furan block, as shown in Scheme 1. The introduction of conjugated alkylthienyl side chains to the benzodithiophene (BDT) core results in a more planar configuration than BDT with alkoxy side chains,5a,7 which will further strengthen π–π stacking between polymer backbones, hence improving device performance in both PSCs and organic field effect transistors (OFETs).8 Recently, the furan block and its derivatives have been reported to help polymers adopting more planar conformations and achieving higher solubility than thiophene-based materials.9 Therefore, intensive efforts have been devoted to replacing thiophene rings with furan in both the backbone and side-chain of the BDT-T structure.10 In our previous study,8b furan bridged D–A copolymers demonstrated better performance in both OFETs and PSCs than thiophene bridged polymers, attributed to the better solubility, improved planarity and relatively lower HOMO level of furan-based materials.

Herein, following our previous work, we carried out a systematic investigation on the effects of furan bridges on the polymer optical and electrical properties, aiming to gain further insight into the polymer structure–property correlation. Three popular acceptor blocks N-alkylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTZ) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) were adopted and three furan bridged D–π–A conjugated polymers PBFTP, PBFBT and PBFDP were synthesized. By means of both theoretical simulations and experimental characterizations, the relationship between the molecular structure and the polymer physicochemical properties as well as the BHJ blend morphology was analyzed. Then the influence of material properties on the solar cell device performance was investigated. As a result of the rational selection of acceptor units, a large open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87 V and a high PCE of 5.64% were achieved for devices using PBFTP and PBFDP respectively, showing the potential application of these new materials in PSCs. More importantly, the understanding of the correlation between the polymer structure and photovoltaic performance is of great importance for the future design and synthesis of organic photovoltaic materials.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis
The synthetic routes to obtain the monomers and polymers are outlined in Scheme 1, with compound 7 and PBFDP prepared according to our previous report.8b Monomers 3 and 6 were prepared by a similar method starting from a commercial material 2-(tributylstannyl)furan, followed by a Stille cross-coupling reaction with dibromide of TPD and BTZ, and then the final monomers 3 and 6 were obtained by bromination with NBS. D–A structured polymers PBFTP and PBFBT were synthesized by Stille polycondensation between 7 and 3, and 7 and 6 with a yield of 85% and 86%, respectively. PBFTP and PBFDP exhibit excellent solubility at room temperature in common solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform (CF), and chlorobenzene (CB), while PBFBT shows limited solubility without heating due to the lack of alkyl side chains. Note that before the substitution of a thiophene moiety by a furan moiety, the original polymer solubility is very poor.8b,11 The molecular weight and dispersity of the three polymers are listed in Table 1. The thermal stability of the three polymers was also investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, all three polymers have good thermal stability under nitrogen with the 5% weight-loss temperature (Td) of 420 °C, 441 °C and 417 °C for PBFTP, PBFBT and PBFDP, respectively.

2.2 Optical properties
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of PBFTP, PBFBT and PBFDP in dilute chloroform solutions and in thin films are shown in Fig. 2, with the values of absorption maxima and edges listed in Table 2. Owing to the different electron-withdrawing ability (EWA) of the acceptor units, the three polymers show widely distributed optical band-gaps (Eoptg), from 1.41 eV to 1.88 eV, all in the range for application in solar cells. Due to the weak EWA of TPD, PBFTP shows a relatively narrow absorption range starting from 300 nm to 650 nm. Compared to the absorption spectrum in solution, the film absorption shows a red shift of ∼40 nm and a strong peak at 589 nm, which is attributed to the π–π stacking of the polymer backbone, indicating a strengthened coplanar conformation in the solid state. PBFBT exhibits three peaks in both its solution and solid state absorption spectra. The three absorption peaks, from short to long wavelength, are attributed to the intrinsic absorption of the BDT moiety, the π–π* transition band, and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor monomers, respectively.12 The film absorption is broadened and a red-shift of approximately 15 nm from the solution spectrum is observed. PBFDP shows strong absorption in the long wavelength region up to 850 nm because of the intrinsically strong EWA of DPP.13 The sharp absorption peak at ∼750 nm indicates a strong ICT interaction and a low band-gap. When measured in the solid state, the absorption spectrum is significantly broadened. Based on the optical properties, we concluded that the EWA of the acceptor units has an apparent impact on the polymer band-gaps.

2.3 Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical properties of the polymers were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV).14 The measurements were conducted in anhydrous acetonitrile with Bu4NPF6 (0.1 M) as the electrolyte under an argon atmosphere at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A Pt plate with a diameter of 1.0 mm was used as the working electrode. Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode and a Pt wire was used as the counter electrode. The results are shown in Fig. 3, with the corresponding data summarized in Table 2. The HOMO energy levels of PBFTP, PBFBT and PBPDP were calculated to be −5.48 eV, −5.19 eV and −5.24 eV, respectively. Previous reviews have concluded that the HOMO levels of D–A polymers are primarily decided by the donating strength of the donor comonomer.1b,15 However, our results evidently indicate that the selection of acceptor units can also influence the polymer HOMO. Likewise, the LUMO levels of PBFBT and PBPDP were directly measured to be −3.35 eV and −3.63 eV respectively. Due to the difficulty to record an evident reduction peak, the LUMO level of PBFTP was calculated to be −3.60 eV by the equation LUMO = HOMO + Eoptg. Among the three polymers, PBFDP shows the lowest LUMO level, likely due to the strong EWA of its DPP accepting monomer. It is worth noting that the introduction of a furan-bridge can also influence the polymer energy levels. PBFDP exhibits a deeper HOMO level and a larger optical band-gap compared to similar molecules with a thiophene-bridge, which can be ascribed to the higher ionization potential of furan over thiophene, leading to lower electron densities.8a,b PBFTP also shows a slightly deeper HOMO level and a larger band-gap compared to similar molecules without a π bridge.12b

2.4 Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for molecules using Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31g(d) level were performed, aiming to gain insight into the possible molecular geometries arising from the chemical structures. To simplify the calculations, only two repeating units of each polymer were subject to simulation, with alkyl chains replaced by CH3 groups. In Fig. 4a and b, our calculations indicate that the dihedral angles are −1.91°, 0.44° and −0.93° for PBFTP, 1.00°, −11.17° and −10.80° for PBFBT and −1.97°, 1.43° and −1.08° for PBFDP. The obviously smaller dihedral angles of PBFTP and PBFDP than PBFBT imply a better planarity, which will help to improve the intermolecular packing. Indeed, a high hole mobility8b of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBFDP is in accordance with the simulation results. We also calculated the materials' energy levels to confirm the CV measurement results. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the trends observed in the calculated LUMO, HOMO energy levels and band-gaps are consistent with the CV and optical measurements.

2.5 Photovoltaic performance
The conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al (Fig. 5b) was adopted to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of these new polymers. The results are shown in Fig. 5c and d, with the data summarized in Table 3. The optimization process included the selection of solvents, use of additives and adjustment of polymer concentrations and polymer:PCBM ratios. For PBFTP, o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) was selected as the optimal solvent with 2% 1,8-octanedithiol (DIO), which has been proven to be an effective additive in improving the film morphology.16 The optimal polymer concentration was 8 mg mL−1 with a polymer:PCBM weight ratio of 1:1.5. The optimal thicknesses of the active films were 70 nm, 120 nm and 90 nm for PBFTP, PBFBT and PBFDP based devices, respectively. As shown in Table 3, the PBFTP:PC61BM based devices using the additive exhibit a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 8.73 mA cm−2, a FF of 61.0% and a PCE of 4.46%, which is slightly improved compared to the devices processed without using DIO (3.80%). And a further improved PCE of 5.10% was achieved by using PC71BM to increase the absorption of the active film.

Due to the limited solubility of PBFBT, CB was chosen as the solvent and the solution was stirred over 3 days at 40 °C before device fabrication. An optimal PCE of 2.11% was obtained after using 2% DIO. Considering that the thiophene bridged polymer is insoluble,11b the moderate device performance of PBFBT is already a remarkable improvement, owing to the enhanced solubility by furan substitution. For PBFDP, the optimal solvent was selected as a mixture of ODCB/CF = 1/1 with 2% DIO, which led to slightly improved performance than that of the device cast from pure CF solutions. The PCE of the device can be further improved to 5.64% by using PC71BM to enhance the short circuit current. Compared to similar molecules without a π bridge or with a thiophene-bridge, PBFTP and PBFDP show a deeper HOMO level and hence a larger Voc by introducing a furan-bridge to the polymer backbone.8a,b,12b
To evaluate the photo-response of the three copolymers and calibrate the Jsc data, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the optimized devices were measured (Fig. 6). PBFTP shows a high EQE value of around 60% from 350–600 nm, while PBFDP exhibits a much broad response range from 400–800 nm with an average EQE peak value of 45%. The Jsc of PBFTP, PBFBT and PBFDP based devices calculated by integrating the EQE curve with AM 1.5G reference spectra is 9.26 mA cm−2, 6.50 mA cm−2 and 12.48 mA cm−2, which were within a 5% error range compared to the corresponding Jsc obtained from the J–V curves.

2.6 Morphology
The effects of polymer structure on film morphology were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 7, the AFM topography, stereoscopic and phase images of the optimal polymer films are presented. The PBFBT topography shows micron level grains, indicating excessive phase segregation and inefficient exciton separation. The undesirable morphology can account for the relatively low device performance and is likely caused by the poor polymer solubility due to the missing of side chains on the acceptor unit. Indeed, for acceptor units with side chains, the morphologies of the corresponding polymers are significantly improved. For FBFTP, containing an acceptor with a single alkyl chain, the surface is much smoother suggesting reduced sizes of polymer-rich domains and finer phase segregation. Consequently, the device photo-current and FF are enhanced as a result of a well developed D–A network for efficient exciton separation and transport. With two ethylhexyl side chains appended to the contained DPP acceptor, PBFDP possesses further improved solubility and consequently the film surface is more uniform than that of both PBFBT and FBFTP by judging from their AFM phase image (Fig. 7g–i).

Investigations of the film bulk morphology were carried out using TEM to further confirm the AFM observations. Consistently, we noticed huge polymer-rich and PCBM-rich domains in the PBFBT-based blend film (Fig. 8b). In contrast, PBFTP (Fig. 8a) and PBFDP (Fig. 8c) blend films show finer phase separation. Careful observations reveal that the dark PCBM-rich domains in the PBFTP blend film are slightly larger than those in the PBFDP film. The ethylhexyl on DPP is more solubilizing than the linear alkyl chain on TPD, which may be the reason for the further reduced domain size. In short, both the AFM and TEM results consistently indicate that the size and topology of the side chains can influence the polymer solubility and consequently have an important impact on their blend film morphology and photovoltaic performance.

3 Conclusion
Three D–π–A copolymers, PBFTP, PBFBT and PBFDP, composed of a furan bridged BDT-T donor and different acceptors were designed and synthesized to investigate the correlation between the molecular structure and properties. The UV-vis and CV measurements indicated that the selection of acceptor units had a significant impact on the polymer optical and electrochemical properties. The theoretical simulation further confirmed the experimental results and revealed the influence of the acceptor units on the polymer coplanarity as well as energy levels, which are vital to the device FF and Voc respectively. The AFM and TEM results suggested that the size and topology of the side chains on the acceptor units could affect the polymer solubility and consequently have a direct impact on their blend film morphology, leading to significantly different device performance. As a result of optimized morphology and fine tuned energy levels, we demonstrated PCEs over 5% for both PBFTP and PBFDP based devices, which are among the highest efficiencies of reported furan bridged D–A polymers.

4.3 Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
Polymer solar cells were fabricated with a general structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al. Patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, isopropyl alcohol and acetone, and the organic residue was further removed by treating with UV–ozone for 15 min. ITO substrates were spin-coated with a 40 nm thin film of PEDOT:PSS and dried at 150 °C for 10 min. A blend of polymer and PCBM was dissolved in chlorinated solvent with or without DIO, filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter, spin-coated at different rpm (1500 rpm for CF and 700 rpm for CB and ODCB) for 40 s; 0.6 nm of LiF (0.1 A s−1) and 100 nm of Al (2 A s−1) layers were then thermally evaporated on the active layer at a pressure of 1.0 × 10−6 m bar through a shadow mask (active area 7.25 mm2). The current density–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) digital source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity was calibrated using a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150V) and verified with a NREL calibrated Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using certified IPCE equipment (Zolix Instruments, Inc., SolarCellScan100).
