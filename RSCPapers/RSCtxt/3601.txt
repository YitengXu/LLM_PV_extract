    , Accepted 25th October 2021First published on 29th October 2021AbstractBifunctional luminescence materials have aroused considerable concern due to their wide application and high utilization. In this study, we have successfully integrated bright green up-conversion luminescence of K0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (KBT): Er/In ceramics with potential applications on cryogenic optical thermometry and photomemory. By employing the fluorescence intensity ratio based on thermally coupled levels of Er3+: 2H11/2/4S3/2, the splendid low-temperature sensing properties were demonstrated as the maximum relative sensitivities were 7.14% K−1 and 8.73% K−1 at 137 K for KBT: Er and KBT: Er/In ceramics, respectively. Moreover, the reversible photochromism performance could be triggered by the 365 nm irradiation and vanished by thermal stimulation at 150 °C. Remarkably, the coupling of up-conversion luminescence and photochromism performance has a promising application on rewritable photomemory. For the KBT: Er/In ceramic, the emission intensity could be reduced by 76.59% after coloration, and restored to its original value after bleaching. In order to evaluate the practicability of applying on photomemory, a reversible experiment was designed and successfully executed. It is believed that the KBT: Er/In bifunctional ceramic can be a great candidate for low-temperature sensing and optical information storage devices.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of science and technique, the growing demand for dealing with optical information has attracted attention of the research community towards multifunctional luminescence materials, which integrate multiple functions, effectively reduce production costs and expand the application scope.1–3 In general, the classic luminescence modes of materials include down-shifting, up-conversion, phosphorescence, and quantum cutting.4–7 In contrast, up-conversion materials can convert near infrared light to visible light, presenting promising applications on bioimaging, anti-counterfeiting, solar cells, optical thermometry and so on.8–11 In view of low-cost, nontoxicity and chemical stability, lanthanide ions (Er3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+)-doped inorganic up-conversion materials are superior to organic or quantum dot materials and have been studied extensively.12
From the perspective of applications, the optical thermometry based on up-conversion materials arose much concern due to being non-contact, and having a fast response and high sensitivity.13,14 Admittedly, optical thermometry is generally executed by the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) based on the photoluminescence (PL) of rare-earth ions,15 of which the PL intensity derived from thermally coupled levels (TCLs) shows different variation tendencies with the increase in temperature.15,16 It is known to all that the FIR is defined as: , where I, A, ΔE and k represent the UCPL intensity, fitting constant, the energy gap between TCLs and Boltzmann constant, respectively.17 In order to evaluate the performance of optical thermometry, the absolute sensitivity (Sa), relative sensitivity (Sr) and temperature uncertainty (δT) are proposed, and the estimated following equations are ,  and , respectively.12,15 For Er3+ ion-doped materials, 2H11/2 (∼528 nm emission) and 4S3/2 (∼548 nm emission) are widely reported TCLs, and present different temperature sensing properties in various host matrixes. For instance, Cui et al. found that Er/Yb co-doped Sr10(PO4)O transparent glass ceramic presents the maximum Sr of 0.769% K−1 at 303 K and Sa of 5.951 × 10−3 K−1 at 663 K.17 In addition, Tong et al. reported the maximum Sa of α-NaYF4:Yb/Er and β-NaYF4:Yb/Er nano-/micro-crystals were 4.54 × 10−3 K−1 at 541 K and 4.84 × 10−3 K−1 at 515 K, respectively.18 Besides, our previous work reported the decent temperature sensing properties of Er/Yb-doped in NaYTiO4 phosphors with the maximum Sr of 1.06% K−1 at 308 K, the maximum Sa of 3.55 × 10−3 K−1 at 618 K and the minimum δT of 0.18 K at 308 K.19 To the best of our knowledge, the temperature sensing of Er3+ ion-doped materials based on 2H11/2/4S3/2 TCLs at a cryogenic range have been rarely reported.
It is well known that the photochromism (PC) performance is related to color centers in the materials. Under irradiation with a short wavelength, the excited carriers are captured by oxygen vacancies in the host lattice.20 As a result, the generated color centers intensify the absorption of the material in a certain band of visible light, leading to the change in the apparent color.21 While after thermal stimulation or irradiation with a long wavelength, the captured carriers are released by oxygen vacancies, and the allochroic material changes back to its original color.21,22 In recent years, the coupling of photoluminescence and photochromism has been detected in composite oxides, such as Na0.5Bi2.5Nb2O9: Pr,23 Sr5(PO4)3F: Eu,24 Sr2SnO4: Er,25 and Na0.5Bi2.5Nb2O9: Er.20 It was found that the modulation of UCPL properties could be attributed to the overlapping of the absorption of color centers and the photoluminescence of luminescence centers.20,26 In particular, the up-conversion photoluminescence (UCPL) intensity reduces after being irradiated by visible light with a short wavelength, and increases after thermal stimulation or irradiation by a long wavelength light. Remarkably, the UCPL varying with coloration or bleaching processes demonstrates a great potential application on rewritable photomemory due to the revisable photochromism performance.24
Herein, we fabricated K0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (KBT): Er/In bifunctional up-conversion luminescence ceramics by successfully integrating optical thermometry and photomemory applications. On the one hand, the ladder-like energy levels of Er3+ ions exhibited the bright up-conversion luminescence and appropriate 2H11/2/4S3/2 TCLs for application in optical thermometry. On the other hand, distinct PC performance was observed under 365 nm irradiation. With an apparent color change from white to grey, the UCPL intensity conspicuously reduced. However, after a heating treatment, the allochroic ceramic restored its original color, with the UCPL returning to bright. This reversible modulation of the UCPL intensity under the continuous alternation of irradiation and thermal stimulation demonstrated the promising application on rewritable photomemory. More innovatively, the integration of optical thermometry and photomemory in a single material KBT: Er/In widens the scope of applications.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Material synthesis procedure
KBT: Er and KBT: Er/In ceramics were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction. Anhydrous potassium carbonate (K2CO3, Aladdin 99.99%), bismuth oxide (Bi2O3, Macklin 99.99%), titanium dioxide (TiO2, Aladdin 99.99%), erbium oxide (Er2O3, Hawk 99.99%) and indium oxide (In2O3, Meryer 99.99%) were used as raw materials. They were weighed precisely according to the chemical stoichiometry, and then ground by a planetary ball milling machine with moderate amounts of alcohol and zirconia pellets. The obtained slurry was dried, ground and pre-sintered at 900 °C for 2 h. Whereafter, the powders were re-ground and pressed into pieces with a radius of 15 mm. Subsequently, the pieces were transferred to a muffle furnace and sintered at 980 °C for 6 h. Finally, the as-prepared ceramics were characterized.
2.2 Material and property characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D8 Advance (Bruker) X-ray powder diffraction system with nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ ranging from 5° to 90°, and the working current and voltage were 40 mA and 40 kV, respectively. The morphologies and elemental mappings of KBT: 0.5 mol% Er and KBT: 0.5 mol% Er/0.5 mol% In ceramics were obtained by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Zeiss GeminiSEM 300) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB Xi +). UV-Vis reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi UH4150). The up-conversion photoluminescence (UCPL) at room temperature was measured by a fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-7100) equipped with a 980 nm laser. The decay curves and temperature-dependent UCPL spectra were recorded by a fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 980) attached with a 980 nm laser and a cryostat instrument (Oxford DN).
3. Results and discussion
According to XRD patterns at various In3+ ion concentrations, as shown in Fig. 1(a), the pure phase of KBT (space group P4mm) can be detected when the introduced In3+ ions were less than 0.7 mol%, beyond which the secondary phase In2O3 appeared. To figure out the effects of In3+ ions on the K0.5Bi0.5TiO3:0.5 mol% Er (KE) samples, the pieces were ground to fine powders and the subsequent Rietveld refinements of KE and K0.5Bi0.5TiO3:0.5 mol% Er/0.5 mol% In (KEI) were carried out by general structure and analysis system (GSAS),27 as depicted in Fig. 1(b and c). The refinement results are summarized in Table 1. As illustrated in Fig. 1(d), In3+ and Er3+ ions substituted Bi3+ ions in the KBT lattice, which can be ascribed to the same ionic valence state and smaller radius of In3+ (0.80 Å) and Er3+ (0.89 Å) ions than Bi3+ (1.08 Å) ions.28 Furthermore, according to the refinement results presented in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†), the introduction of In3+ ions can influence the three types of Bi–O bond length, leading to the contraction of a (b) and expansion of c of the KBT: Er samples, as shown in Fig. 1(e). Furthermore, the volume reduction was due to the smaller radius of In3+ than Er3+ ions. Fig. 2(a and b) reveal the morphologies of KE and KEI ceramics. It was obvious that the introduction of In3+ ions has tiny effects on the shape of particles. Nevertheless, according to Fig. S1(a–c) (ESI†), the grain size of the KE ceramic was hundreds of nanometers, while that of the KEI sample was dozens of nanometers. The adhesion between particles was significantly reduced by In3+ ion co-doping. In addition, the element mappings confirmed the uniform distributions of K, Bi, Ti, O, Er on the KE ceramic and K, Bi, Ti, O, Er, In on the KEI ceramic, respectively.

Fig. 3 presents the band structures of the KBT host, KE and KEI samples calculated using the “Vienna ab initio simulation package” (VASP). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were executed based on the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional with generalized gradient approximation (GGA). In addition, the ion–electron interaction was expressed by the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. The introduction of Er3+ and In3+ ions maintained the indirect bandgaps and moved up the valence band as well as conduction band. Although the bottom of the conduction band was located at the Γ point abidingly, the top of the valence band changed from point X to M of the Brillouin zone with Er3+ and/or In3+ ions co-doping. The indirect bandgaps were 1.6505 eV, 2.1620 eV and 1.9831 eV for KBT, KE and KEI lattices, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(a–c). Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig. 3(d–f), the impurity levels across the Fermi surface consisted of the 4f orbital of Er3+ ions.

Upon 980 nm laser irradiation, the bright green emissions can be observed in KE and KEI. It should be noted that the Er3+ ions concentration of 0.5 mol% was determined by comparing the UCPL intensities at various concentrations of Er3+ ions single-doped KBT ceramics, as described in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†). The emissions at 528 nm, 548 nm and 657 nm derived from 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively. In order to reveal the energy transition mechanism, the UCPL of KE and KEI varying with pumping power were monitored at room temperature, as presented in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S2(b) (ESI†). The UCPL intensity (I) has a relation with pumping power (P) as I∝Pn, in which n is the number of absorbed photons in the up-conversion process.29 According to the log–log plots of P vs. I shown in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. S2(c) (ESI†), all n values of 528 nm, 548 nm and 657 nm emissions for KE and KEI samples were around 2, suggesting a two-photon absorption in the up-conversion process. Fig. 4(c) shows the possible energy transition mechanism of Er3+ ions. When pumped by a 980 nm laser, the electrons at ground state 4I15/2 jumped to the excited state 4I11/2via a ground state absorption (GSA) process, and then, migrated to the 4F7/2 energy level by an excited state absorption (ESA) process. Afterwards, the electrons transferred to the lower excited states according to the non-irradiation (NR) process. Therefore, the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 energy levels were populated, and then depleted by transferring back to the ground state emitting at 528, 548 and 657 nm, respectively. To determine the effects of In3+ ions on KBT: Er ceramics, the UCPL spectra at various In3+ concentrations were recorded, as shown in Fig. 4(d), and the whole relative intensity was calculated, as shown in Fig. 4(e). It can be observed that the UCPL integral intensity was enhanced by co-doping In3+ ions in the KE ceramics. Moreover, the presence of secondary phase In2O3 restrained UCPL when the In3+ concentration was 0.7 mol%. Compared to Fig. S2(d) (ESI†) of the KE sample, the decay times (τ) of the KEI ceramic fitted by a single exponential function at 528 nm, 548 nm and 657 nm prominently promoted, as displayed in Fig. 4(f). This can be attributed to the aforementioned lattice contraction caused by the introduction of the In3+ ions, which shortened the distance and improved the energy transfer efficiency between the luminescence centers.

Fig. 5(a and b) display the temperature-dependent UCPL spectra from 77 K to 497 K of KE and KEI ceramics under a 980 nm laser excitation at 10.72 W cm−2. Based on the FIR, the energy gaps of 2H11/2/4S3/2 TCLs were calculated to be 783.30 eV and 884.92 eV for KE samples with and without co-doping In3+ ions, as described in Fig. 5(c and f). It is noteworthy to mention that the comparable nonradiative and decay rates of the excited states can lead to the fitting deviation below 137 K.30 Moreover, according to the calculation results shown in Fig. 5(d–e) and (g–h), the enhanced temperature sensing properties were demonstrated by In3+ ions co-doping in the KE ceramic. Detailedly, the maximum Sr increased from 7.14% K−1 (KE) to 8.73% K−1 (KEI) at 137 K, and the minimum δT decreased from 0.28 K (KE) to 0.20 K (KEI) at 137 K, while the maximum Sa values decreased from 5.25 × 10−3 K−1 to 4.35 × 10−3 K−1 at 497 K. It should be pointed out that the calculated Sr of the KEI/KE ceramics at the cryogenic temperature was superior to most of the reported values so far, as listed in Table 2, indicating its splendid application on cryogenic optical thermometry.31–34

So far, it has been reported that the PC performance can be observed in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3: Yb/Ho,35 Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3: Er36 and Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3–Na0.5K0.5NbO3: Er37 ceramics due to the oxygen vacancies induced by cation ion volatilization during the high-temperature sintering procedure. Given the similar composition and structure, the KBT ceramics were speculated to exhibit the PC reaction. Actually, when irradiated by 365 nm for a while, the apparent color of the sample changed from white to grey. Coincidently, the PC performance was also detected in KE and KEI ceramics. Fig. 6(a) shows the UV-vis reflectivity of the KEI ceramic after irradiation by 365 nm for various times, and the reflectivity reduced when the irradiation time was extended until 120 s. More precisely, as depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the reduction of reflectivity at 560 nm of KBT, KE and KEI were 16.85%, 23.31% and 25.25%, respectively. To further investigate the mechanism of PC, the O 1s XPS spectra of samples before and after 365 nm irradiation were obtained in Fig. 6(b). Through peak separation, two distinct peaks located at 529.1 eV and 530.6 eV are ascribed to lattice oxygen (O2−) and oxygen vacancy , respectively.20 By calculating the ratios of the area under O2− and  peaks at before (0.568) and after (0.341) irradiation, it can be inferred that the formation of color centers can suppress oxygen vacancies via trapping the carriers.38Fig. 6(d) illustrates the bleaching process of thermal stimulation. The reflectivity at 560 nm fell sharply after 365 nm irradiation for 120 s, and gradually restored to the original value with an elevated heating treatment until 150 °C for 30 s. Besides, the coloration and bleaching photos of KBT host, KE and KEI ceramics are presented in Fig. 6(c).

(f) Dependence of ΔRt values on the irradiation time and heating temperature. (g) UCPL modulation under alternate cycles between 365 nm irradiation for 240 s and thermal stimulation at 150 °C for 30 s. 
As mentioned before, the UCPL intensity of KEI ceramic can be modulated by the PC performance via irradiation and thermal stimulation (Fig. 6(e)). In particular, the variation degree of the UCPL intensity (ΔRt) can be expressed as , where R0 and Rt refer to the UCPL intensities before and after irradiation, respectively.39 As shown in Fig. 6(f), ΔRt increased instantly when the irradiation time was less than 60 s, became stable at around 76.59% when the irradiation time was further extended, and progressively recovered to 0 after thermal stimulation. Fig. 6(g) depicts the UCPL intensity (excited by a 980 nm laser at 10.72 W cm−2) modified by alternating cycles between 365 nm irradiation for 240 s and thermal stimulation at 150 °C for 30 s. If the states “1” and “0” mark the UCPL treated by 150 °C heating and 365 nm irradiation, respectively, the information in binary form can be recorded and obliterated via irradiation and thermal stimulation. Obviously, the distinction between “1” and “0” states is gigantic over multiple cycles, indicating the considerable potential of the KEI ceramic applied on rewritable photomemory. Likewise, the modulation of UCPL of KE was inferior to the KEI ceramic, as illustrated in Fig. S4 (ESI†), of which the maximum ΔRt was 59.10%. It is noteworthy to mention that the modulation performance of the KEI ceramic was outstanding via contrasting the maximum ΔRt value with other materials, as enumerated in Table 3.

In order to evaluate the practicability of the KEI ceramic applying on photomemory, a schematic is portrayed in Fig. 7(a). In general, the homogeneous and bright green emission can be observed upon 980 nm irradiation. Subsequently, the information (heart shape) was written by 365 nm irradiation with a photomask via the “Write-in” procedure and recognized through the “Read-out” process by 980 nm excitation. Subsequently, the “Erasure” process can be realized by thermal stimulation at 150 °C. Then, the UCPL of the KEI ceramic recovered to the normal situation and can be rewritten with other information. Fig. 7(b) shows the actual operations and photos of the photomemory application. In addition, Fig. 7(c) exhibits the detailed processes of “write-in” by 365 nm irradiation and “erasure” by a heating treatment. The triangle shape gradually emerged as the irradiation time increased and faded away with an increase in the heating temperature. Accordingly, the stable modulation of UCPL by the reversible PC performance demonstrates the anticipated application of the KEI ceramic on rewritable photomemory.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, the bifunctional up-conversion luminescence of KBT: Er and KBT: Er/In ceramics with promising applications on splendid cryogenic optical thermometry and rewritable photomemory was successfully achieved. Based on the FIR technique ranging from 137 K to 497 K, the admiring temperature sensing properties were declared as the maximum Sa of 5.25 × 10−3 K−1 (KE) and 4.35 × 10−3 K−1 (KEI) at 497 K, maximum Sr of 7.14% K−1 (KE) and 8.73% K−1 (KEI) at 137 K, as well as minimum δT of 0.28 K (KE) and 0.20 K (KEI) at 137 K. The increasing sensitivity values manifested the potential application on optical thermometry at a low-temperature region. Besides, the reversible PC reaction can be observed in the KBT host, KE and KEI ceramics due to the color centers generated by oxygen vacancies, which were induced by the volatilization of K+ and Bi3+ ions during the high-temperature sintering process. After irradiation by 365 nm for a while, the apparent colors of the samples changed from white to grey, and restored to white when heated at 150 °C for 30 s. Remarkably, the PC performance was able to regulate the UCPL intensities of the KE and KEI ceramics due to the overlapping of absorption of color centers and emission of luminescence centers, and the variation degree ΔRt increased from 59.10% to 76.59% with In3+ ions co-doping in the KE ceramics. The stable modulation of UCPL by the PC performance demonstrated anticipated application on rewritable photomemory. The integration of optical thermometry and photomemory applications profitably widens the acceptable range and improves the service efficiency of the KE and KEI ceramics.
