    , Accepted 2nd November 2021First published on 2nd November 2021AbstractThe stability of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) plays a vital role in practical devices. Besides silica coating, embedding PQDs in zeolites is another strategy to improve their stability significantly. Although the zeolite rigid framework has been reported to protect PQDs, there are few reports on the in situ synthesis of PQDs in zeolites. In this work, cubic phase CsPbX3 (X = Br, I) nanocrystals were successfully prepared by the ion exchange method combined with a non-polar organic trigger. Dropping a certain amount of ZnM2 (M = Br, I) solution into the intermediate product Cs4PbCl6 nanocrystals resulted in the formation of the final CsPbX3 nanocrystals. The ZnM2 solutions were prepared in non-polar solvents (hexane, octane, or chloroform). The highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the synthesized CsPbX3@zeolite composites can reach 83%, with a lifetime of 1.37 μs. The stability of the CsPbX3@zeolite composites thin film against damage from air and light is significantly improved. We fabricated white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) using CsPbBr3@zeolite as the green light source and CsPbI3@zeolite as the red light source to further emphasize the practical application effect of the CsPbX3@zeolite composites. This work not only provides a new method for the synthesis of CsPbX3 nanocrystals but also involves the in situ synthesis of high stability CsPbX3@zeolite composites within the zeolite.
1. Introduction
Nano-scale perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), as the most representative form of perovskites, show great potential applications in optoelectronic devices due to high luminous efficiency.1–4 Precise control of the luminescence wavelength can be achieved by changing the composition or size, and the tuning range can easily cover the entire visible light region.5,6 Since the first reported CsPbX3 NCs by Kovalenko et al. in 2015,7 significant progress has been made in the luminous efficiency and application of PQDs in the past few years.8–10 For example, the power conversion efficiency of lead halide perovskite solar cells has reached 23.7% in the year 2020.10 The potential application of lead halide perovskites in real life has also promoted its continuous exploration in catalysis and biomarkers.
Although PQDs have superior performance in solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), there are still many problems to solve before the commercialization of PQDs is realized. PQDs undergo a different degree of degradation in light, heat and air, resulting in severe fluorescence quenching, which further leads to a decrease in the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the device.11–14 Surface coating has become the most effective way to improve the stability of PQDs, among which, the inorganic coating of perovskites has attracted the wide attention of researchers. For instance, our group obtained CaF2 microsphere-coated PQDs by a hydrothermal method, which effectively avoids direct contact between the perovskite and the environment, reducing the environmental erosion of the PQDs and improving the stability of the PQDs.15 Silica coating is considered to be one of the universal and effective methods. Wang and co-workers obtained mesoporous silica-coated PQD composites by stirring the prepared PQDs and mesoporous silica in a nonpolar solvent, which exhibited high thermal stability.16 The Dirin group dissolved the prepared CsPbBr3 PQDs with N-methylformamide as a solvent and poured them into the pores of mesoporous silica. A nanocomposite of CsPbBr3@SiO2 was obtained by vacuum drying and crystallization.17 The Wu group synthesized non-luminescent Cs4PbCl6 nanocrystals to form high quantum efficiency CsPbX3 QDs with the assistance of water.18 The limitation of thermal stability has brought obstacles in some important applications. For example, film formation requires small particles and stability in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and display applications. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a surface modification method that combines high stability and nanoscale CsPbX3 NCs.
Porous zeolites can produce microscale composite materials with PQDs, which can be directly compatible with Micro LED packaging technology. Zeolite is a porous aluminosilicate with a unique regular three-dimensional structure, including open [SiO4]4− and [AlO4]5− tetrahedral skeleton structures connected to form a cage. Therefore, it is a promising host for packaging and stabilizing PQDs. Herein, we developed a ZnM2 (M = Br, I)-induced transformation method to obtain high-quality CsPbX3 NCs by dropping a prepared ZnM2 solution into Cs4PbCl6 NCs. ZnM2 solution was pre-dispersed in a nonpolar solvent (hexane, octane, or chloroform) and stirred overnight. The Na+ in the zeolite can be replaced by Cs+. The CsPbX3@zeolite composite was synthesized in the rigid structure of the zeolite, and the luminescence performance was optimized. In addition, the heat stability of the in situ synthesis of CsPbX3@zeolite composite was further improved. Furthermore, the prepared CsPbX3@zeolite composite with tunable emission presented higher stability in air. The WLED device was fabricated by combining a CsPbBr3@zeolite as green emission, CsPbI3@zeolite as red emission and blue InGaN LED. The device exhibited commission international de I'Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates (0.31, 0.31) and luminous efficiency of 90 lm W−1.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
All chemical were used without further purifications: Na+–zeolite–Y (SiO2/Al2O3 = 5.1, Sigma-Aldrich), CsBr (cesium bromide, 99.9%, Aladdin), CsCl (cesium chloride, 99.9%, Aladdin), oleic acid (OA, 90%+, Aladdin), oleylamine (OAm, 80–90%, Aladdin), ODE (90%, Sigma-Aldrich), TOP (n-trioctylphosphine), ZnBr2 (zinc bromide, Aladdin), ZnI2 (zinc iodide, Macklin), PbCl2 (lead chloride, 99.9%, Aladdin), n-hexane (97%, Aladdin), octane (≥95%, AR, Beijing chemicals), chloroform (≥95%, AR, Beijing chemicals).
2.2. Synthesis of Cs4PbCl6 nanocrystal
The Cs-precursor was prepared according to the literature.7 Briefly, 0.188 mmol of PbCl2, 2.0 mL of OA and 2.0 mL of OAm were loaded into a 100 mL three-necked bottle along with 10 mL ODE. The mixture was dried for 30 min at 120 °C under vacuum and stirring. Then, the reaction temperature was raised to 150 °C under N2 atmosphere and maintained for 10 min. The pre-prepared Cs-precursor solution (2.5 mL) was swiftly injected into the hot reaction mixture. The system was cooled with an ice-water bath after the reaction for about 5 seconds. Finally, the obtained product was washed twice with isopropanol, followed by centrifugation. Cs4PbCl6 nanocrystals were dried at 40 °C (vacuum) for one night.
2.3. Synthesis of ZnM2 (M = Br, I) solutions
Ion-exchanged precursor stock solutions were prepared by dissolving 0.3 mmol of ZnBr2 or ZnI2 in 10 mL of n-hexane (octane or chloroform) in the presence of 200 μL of OLA with stirring for one night.
2.4. Synthesis of CsPbX3 quantum dots (QDs)
A small amount of ZnM2 (M = Br, I) solution was added to Cs4PbCl6, which resulted in the conversion of Cs4PbCl6 to CsPbX3. The size of CsPbX3 in CsPbX3 could be controlled by the amount of ZnM2 (M = Br, I) solution added. By the above-mentioned observation, the transformation process can be written as 2Cs4PbCl6 + 3ZnBr2 → 2CsPbBr3 + 6CsCl + 3ZnCl2(1) 2Cs4PbCl6 + 3ZnI2 → 2CsPbI3 + 6CsCl + 3ZnCl2.(2)
Table S1† lists the formation energy of Cs4PbCl6, CsCl, CsPbBr3, CsPbI3, ZnBr2, ZnCl2 and ZnI2 calculated by DFT. The total energy required for the entire reaction processes in eqn (1) and (2) is 0.98 and 1.26 eV, respectively, which slightly absorb heat from the environment, indicating the possibility of the reaction process.
2.5. Preparation of Cs+–Y
1.0 g of zeolite–Y and 0.0021 g CsBr were dispersed in a 10 ml aqueous solution in a single neck flask. The mixture was stirred in a water bath at 60 °C for 24 h. The products were centrifuged and washed with deionized water, and then dried in air at 80 °C for 12 h. The formation of Cs+–Y can be represented by the following chemical equation Na+–Y + Cs+ → Cs+–Y + Na+.(3)
2.6. Synthesis of Cs4PbCl6@zeolite
PbCl2 solution was prepared by mixing 0.376 mmol of PbCl2, 2.0 mL of OA, 2.0 mL of OAm in a 100 mL three-necked bottle along with 10 mL ODE. The mixture was dried for 30 min at 120 °C under vacuum with stirring. After that, the mixture was purged under N2 flow until PbCl2 was completely dissolved. For preparing Cs4PbCl6@zeolite, PbCl2 was dissolved at 150 °C with TOP (1 mL). Then, Cs+–Y (1 g) was loaded into a 100 mL three-necked bottle along with 10 mL ODE. The mixture was dried for 30 min under vacuum at 120 °C. The reaction temperature was raised to 150 °C under an N2 atmosphere and maintained for another 30 min. The as-prepared PbCl2 solution was swiftly injected into the hot reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred for about 10 min. The mixture was then cooled using an ice-water bath. Finally, the obtained product was washed with isopropanol twice followed by centrifugation. The Cs4PbCl6@zeolite composites were dried at 40 °C for one night. The chemical equation corresponding to this reaction can be represented by: 4Cs+–Y + Pb2+ + 6X− → Cs4PbX6–Y.(4)
2.7. Synthesis of CsPbX3@zeolite
A small amount of ZnM2 (M = Br, I) solution was added to the Cs4PbCl6@zeolite composites, which results to the conversion of Cs4PbCl6@zeolite to CsPbX3@zeolite. The size of CsPbX3 in CsPbX3@zeolite can be controlled by the amount of ZnM2 (M = Br, I) solution added. 2Cs4PbCl6@zeolite + 3ZnBr2 → 2CsPbBr3@zeolite + 6CsCl + 3ZnCl2(5) 2Cs4PbCl6@zeolite + 3ZnI2 → 2CsPbI3@zeolite + 6CsCl + 3ZnCl2(6)
2.8. Fabrication of white LEDs
For the WLED shown in Fig. 10, 0.1 g of silicone resin A and 0.1 g of silicone resin B were mixed with 0.01 g CsPbBr3@zeolite and then 0.01 g CsPbI3@zeolite composite was added, and the mixture was stirred thoroughly. Afterward, the phosphor mixtures were deposited on a 460 nm InGaN LED chip.
2.9. Material characterizations
Phase identification is confirmed by X-ray diffraction using a D8 Focus diffractometer (Bruker) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å). TEM was recorded using a FEI Tecnai G2S-Twin with a field-emission gun operating at 200 kV equipped. Analysis of elements in polycrystalline CsPbX3@zeolite was performed using an energy dispersive spectrometer equipped with a scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). The absorption spectra were obtained using a U-3100 spectrophotometer (Hitachi). Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were recorded using a Vertex PerkinElmer 580BIR spectrophotometer (Bruker) with the KBr pellet technique. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were obtained on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M apparatus. Pore size distribution was calculated from the adsorption branch of N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm and the Barret–Joner–Halenda (BJH) method. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and temperature-dependent (at 25–150 °C) PL spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrophotometer with a 450 W xenon lamp as the excitation source (an Edinburgh Instrument FLS-920) spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller. The PL quantum yield (QY) of CsPbX3@zeolite were obtained directly using an absolute PL quantum yield measurement system C9920-02 (Hamamatsu photonics K.K., Japan). The EL performance of LEDs was measured using a StarspecSSP6612.
3. Results and discussion
Non-luminescent intermediate Cs4PbCl6 nanocrystals were synthesized (see more experimental details in the ESI†). Fig. 1a and b shows XRD patterns and TEM images of Cs4PbCl6 nanocrystals. The different amounts of ZnBr2 solution (50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 750, 1000, and 1500 μL) were added to a certain amount of Cs4PbCl6 nanocrystals. The blue color solution and original colorless Cs4PbCl6 nanocrystals turned into a bright green with the excitation at 365 nm during this process (Fig. S1†), implying a successful transformation from non-luminescent Cs4PbCl6 nanocrystals to bright CsPbBr3 NCs. A more intuitive transformation process can be seen in the video S1 in the ESI.† The powder XRD pattern of the obtained product is depicted in Fig. 1c and d. The diffraction peaks are in good agreement with the cubic phase CsPbBr3 (PDF#84-0464), further confirming the successful transformation. The products were characterized using TEM. As shown in the TEM image (Fig. 1e and f), CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs with cubic shape perovskite crystal structure can be observed. The measured d-spacing of 0.56 nm from HRTEM agrees well with the (100) plane of cubic CsPbBr3 shown in Fig. S2(a and b).† The average size of the crystals in CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs is 8 nm, as shown in Fig. S2(c and d).† The transformed CsPbX3 nanocrystals were further verified by UV-vis absorption and PL spectra. As depicted in Fig. 1g and h, the peaks at 505 and 660 nm can be observed in the absorption spectrum, which are indexed as CsPbX3 NCs. The corresponding PL spectrum shows a bright green emission (511 nm) and red emission (678 nm) with a narrow full width at half-maximum of 20 and 37 nm, respectively. The PLQY of the obtained product was measured to be 92% and 50% as shown in Table S1,† which are comparable to the PQDs obtained previously.18

The morphology changes during the transformation process were observed using TEM. As shown in Fig. 2a, the circular Cs4PbCl6 nanocrystals with a diameter of about 10–40 nm transformed to a cubic phase CsPbX3 NCs, after the addition of ZnM2 solution. The particle size was about 4–20 nm, which is similar to that obtained using the water-triggered process.18 With a prolonged reaction time, more and more circular Cs4PbCl6 nanocrystals were converted into cubic CsPbX3 NCs (Fig. 2b–d).
 Fig. 2  (a–d) TEM images obtained at different reaction times to show the morphology and composition evolution of CsPbBr3 NCs: (a) 0 min, (b) 2 min, (c) 5 min, (d) 10 min. 
The detailed transformation process is presented in the ESI (Fig. S1†). The solution composite is left in the air or in a vacuum until the solution evaporates to dryness, and the resulting sample was further characterized. Interestingly, Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals will be additionally generated when the ZnBr2 solution was added in excess. The two-phase coexistence of Cs4PbBr6 and CsPbBr3 were observed (Fig. S3†). In addition, CsPbBr3 NCs will completely transform into Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals after being placed in the air for a long time.
By the above-mentioned observation, the transformation process can be illustrated in Fig. 3. CsCl will be stripped out by n-hexane and oleylamine, when Cs4PbCl6 NCs encounter ZnBr2 solution containing n-hexane and oleylamine. Moreover, the excess Cl and Zn combine to form ZnCl2. Bright green emission CsPbBr3 PQDs are generated after ion exchange. The mechanism of obtaining red emission CsPbI3 PQDs is similar. CsCl and ZnCl2 are removed by centrifugation because they are dissolved in n-hexane and oleylamine.
 Fig. 3  (a and b) Schematic illustration of the whole formation process of CsPbX3 NCs. 
According to the proposed mechanism, Br− and I− ions should play a significant role in the reaction. It was found in the experiment that changes in divalent cations (Zn2+), such as Sn2+ ion can also synthesize CsPbX3 NCs. Although replacing Zn2+ with Sn2+ can still complete the reaction, it is worth noting that too much Sn2+ causes PQDs to be easily decomposed. When the same volumes of ZnBr2 and SnBr2 solutions are introduced into the reaction to generate PQDs with similar photoluminescence intensity (Fig. S4 and S5a†). However, the precipitate still emits light under UV light with the introduced excess volume, when the ZnBr2 solution evaporates.19–22 The precipitate no longer emits green light with SnBr2 solution evaporating (in right Fig. S5b†), because Sn2+ is usually unstable and easily oxidized into Sn4+. Moreover, PQDs are separated from the ZnM2 solution in time after ion exchange to avoid decomposition of PQDs.
We further explored the effect of preparing ZnM2 solutions in different solvents on the synthesis of PQDs. It was found that non-polar solvents, such as n-hexane, octane and chloroform, are essential for the synthesis of PQDs.
The PL spectra of CsPbX3 NCs with different solvents are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The emission intensity of PQDs synthesized with different solvents is also different (n-hexane > octane > chloroform). Fig. 4c and d shows the photographs of CsPbX3 NCs with different solvents under UV light illumination. The samples from left to right are n-hexane, octane, chloroform solvents. All samples show a bright green and red light emission in different solvents.

In order to further improve the stability of PQDs, the CsPbX3@zeolite composite was in situ synthesized. Fig. 5 schematically illustrates the three-step synthesis of the CsPbX3@zeolite composite. Firstly, Na+ ions were substituted by Cs+ ions in zeolite–Y to form Cs–Y, and Cs+ ions become a fixed component of zeolite (details in the ESI†). Then, PbCl2 solution was added to the Cs–Y solution by thermal injection to form a non-luminescent Cs4PbCl6@zeolite composite. Finally, the non-luminescent Cs4PbCl6@zeolite was converted into luminescent CsPbX3@zeolite composites by ion exchange.
 Fig. 5  Schematic illustration of the three-step synthesis of the CsPbX3@zeolite composites. 
The successful synthesis of CsPbX3@zeolite composites was confirmed using powder XRD and FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 6a and b). Compared with zeolite, it can be found that some diffraction peaks are enhanced and some are weakened, such as 10.2°, 11.84°, 15.7°, 27°, 27.76°. This interesting phenomenon occurs because the rigid structure of the zeolite crystal remains unchanged, but the electron density distribution in the unit cell changes as the ion exchange occurs.23

(b) FTIR spectra of CsPbBr3@zeolite composites. (c) SEM images of CsPbBr3@zeolite composites. (d) TEM images of CsPbBr3@zeolite composites. 
We can find that only the diffraction peaks of zeolite are found, but the diffraction peaks of PQDs are not detected. One reason is that the nano-scale PQDs are too small and are synthesized inside the zeolite. Although it is inevitable that some PQDs are synthesized on the surface of zeolite, the diffraction signal compared with micron-scale zeolite is weaker. Fig. 6b shows the FTIR spectrum of the CsPbBr3@zeolite composite. Organics containing deprotonated carboxylate group cause CO symmetric stretching vibration and OH stretching vibration with peaks located at 1642 and 3300 cm−1, respectively.
The C–H bending caused by organic-containing hydrocarbon chains corresponds to the peaks at 2862 and 2937 cm−1. The bands at 1021 and 1140 cm−1 can be attributed to the vibration of the zeolite-fixed components Si–O–C and Si–O–Si, respectively. Fig. 6c shows SEM images of Cs4PbCl6@zeolite composites. The TEM of CsPbBr3@zeolite after Cs4PbCl6@zeolite transformation is shown in Fig. 6d. We can clearly see that the PQDs are located inside the zeolite, and it is inevitable that some of them are synthesized externally. Due to the long reaction time and not being limited by the internal framework of the zeolite, the size of the externally-synthesized PQDs is larger than that of those PQDs synthesized inside. Surface areas and pore volumes of the two samples are given in Table S2.† It can be seen that zeolite–Y possesses a relatively high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 768 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 1.3 cm3 g−1, making these microspheres an ideal host for loading guest species of diverse sizes.
The prepared CsPbX3@zeolite composites exhibit strong green and red emissions under UV light excitation. As depicted in Fig. 7a and b, the corresponding PL spectra show a peak at 519 and 689 nm. The PLQY of the obtained product were measured to be 83% and 46%, respectively. CsPbX3@zeolite composites were made into a film to monitor their stability in the air. After surface modification with zeolite–Y, the protective effect of the zeolite–Y is reflected in CsPbX3@zeolite composites with better PL stability in the air compared with that of unmodified.

More importantly, after the surface modification, the average decay lifetime of CsPbX3@zeolite composites was determined to be between 0.02 and 1.37 μs (Fig. 7c–f). In addition, all CsPbX3@zeolite composites show longer decay components than pure CsPbX3 PQDs, which may be due to temporary charge-carrier trapping.24
CsPbX3@zeolite composites still maintained stable luminescence properties at high temperatures, which is very important for their practical applications. Therefore, we improved the luminescence stability of PQDs by combining zeolite encapsulation.
The temperature dependence PL spectra of the CsPbX3@zeolite composites are shown in Fig. 8a and b. As shown, the emission intensity decreases with increasing temperature, and the emission intensity is maintained at 40% of the original intensity at 100 °C (Fig. 8c and d). However, the emission intensity of non-encapsulated PQDs is already lower than 40% of the original intensity with the quenching temperature at 60 °C.16,25 In addition, the peak position is slightly red-shifted. The combination of zeolite and CsPbX3 PQDs improves their stability in air.

After 6 months of storage in a sealed vial under an ambient atmosphere, the emission intensity of the CsPbX3@zeolite composite changes slightly. Therefore, the zeolite structure combined with CsPbX3 prevents the QDs from phase separation and degradation.
Here, the CsPbX3@zeolite composite film was successfully prepared by the spin coating method, and placed in the air for a period to study the light stability of the CsPbX3@zeolite composite film. The corresponding photos show a uniform green and red light emission under 365 nm after being stored in air for two weeks (Fig. 9).

(b) The time-dependent PL intensity and peak position of the CsPbBr3@zeolite composites and CsPbI3@zeolite composites. (c and d) Photographs of the CsPbBr3@zeolite composites thin film stored in air (25 °C and humidity of 50%). (e and f) Photographs of the CsPbI3@zeolite composites thin film stored in air. 
As shown in Fig. 9c–f, a very weak intensity change was observed in the CsPbBr3@zeolite composites thin film after two weeks, while a significant intensity change was observed in the CsPbI3@zeolite composites thin film, and the emission peak was significantly red-shifted, indicating poor stability. The CsPbBr3@zeolite composite thin film shows higher stability in the air (25 °C and humidity of 50%). Fig. 9b and S6† show that the PL intensity and emission peak of the CsPbX3@zeolite composites film change with time. The CsPbBr3@zeolite still maintains 50% of its initial intensity after three months in the air. Therefore, air and light can induce the surface decomposition of CsPbI3@zeolite composites, leading to a decrease in luminescence performance. Zeolite has a good protective effect for CsPbX3 PQDs.
CsPbX3@zeolite composites have excellent photophysical properties, so it is likely to be used in real life, such as lighting and display. The 460 nm GaN chip is coated with green-emission CsPbBr3@zeolite composites and red-emission CsPbI3@zeolite composites, and finally, the three lights are mixed to obtain the white light emission. As shown in Fig. 10, the fabricated WLED device exhibits a luminous efficiency of 20 lm W−1 and CRI (Ra = 60) when operating at a voltage of 3 V. The corresponding CIE coordinate (0.31, 0.31) is still located in the white area shown in Fig. 10b,† other values are listed in Table S3.† In addition, on the right are two photographs. The bright white light emission further proves the feasibility of the CsPbX3@zeolite composites in practical applications.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the bright CsPbX3 PQDs and highly stable CsPbX3@zeolite composites were synthesized by ion exchange in a non-polar solvent. The reaction process was studied in detail, and a reasonable ion-exchange mechanism was proposed. It is believed that the ZnM2 non-polar solution plays a key role in the transition from Cs4PbCl6 to CsPbX3 NCs. The surface coating has become the most effective way to improve the stability of PQDs. After in situ synthesis of CsPbX3@zeolite composites in zeolite, CsPbX3@zeolite composites showed excellent luminescence stability. The stable and bright WLED device is coated with CsPbBr3@zeolite composites as the green light source and CsPbI3@zeolite composites as the red light source on the 460 nm chip. This work provides a way to synthesize CsPbX3 PQDs by ion exchange, and the surface coating of CsPbX3 PQDs by in situ synthesis method to produce CsPbX3@zeolite composites with high stability.
