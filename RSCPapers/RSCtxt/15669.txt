    , Accepted 21st September 2021First published on 21st September 2021AbstractIn this work, we studied the impact of Pb-free perovskite compositions on various properties including the crystal structure, carrier mobility and lifetime, photoresponse in lateral devices, and photostability. We focused on a set of materials with the general formula MA3B2X9, where MA is the methylammonium cation, B stands for a Sb or Bi cation and X is a Br or I anion. I–Br alloying results in a structural modification from 0D to 2D configuration upon 40% Br addition. This structural change, however, did not impact carrier transport properties, while synthesis parameters have a strong impact on the carrier lifetime. Moreover, there is no direct correlation between the material dimensionality and responsivity values in lateral devices. Bi replacement with Sb as well as a low Br content is the key to high performance in photodetectors in a wide wavelength range. We also observe clear performance–stability trade-offs that the best-performing systems in lateral devices are the least stable due to the volatile nature of Sb atoms. Thus, when choosing a specific material for optoelectronics, one should trade between the two parameters, sacrificing either the responsivity or the lifetime of the device.
Introduction
Complex lead halides with a perovskite structure continue attracting attention as an excellent semiconductor material in various optoelectronic applications. While showing extremely high power conversion efficiencies in solar cells,1 recent studies showed that hybrid lead halides are also good candidates for application in photodetectors. A long carrier diffusion length and defect tolerance allow obtaining good responsivity, while fast photoresponse is achieved by high carrier mobility. Moreover, the variation of perovskite composition gives a broad spectral detection region from UV-vis to NIR and even X-rays and gamma rays.2
Most successful results were obtained with Pb-containing perovskite photodetectors (PDs).3–5 However, the lead toxicity and solubility of PbI2 in water as well as poor stability6 hinder its widespread commercialisation. In this aspect, Pb-free perovskite photodetectors7 could be a promising alternative if all the important PD characteristics remain at the same level. Some attempts to obtain good-working PDs by replacing Pb with Sn were made.8–10 However, tin-based perovskites are even less stable than Pb-based perovskites.8 A lot of studies are dedicated to double perovskites such as Cs2AgInCl611,12 and CsAgBiBr6.13–15 These types of materials are more stable, but exhibit lower carrier mobility (∼1 cm2 V−1 s−1).16 An increasing number of studies focus on Bi17–20 and Sb-based21–24 lead-free perovskites with a general formula of A3B2X9. Replacing Pb with Sb or Bi cations improves air stability, but the performance of such systems is usually much lower than of the traditional Pb-based devices. Among methylammonium-based systems, promising results were obtained with MA3Bi2I9,17 MA3Sb2Br9,25 and MA3Sb2I9.26 It is worth nothing that the performance of PDs is strongly affected by the fabrication method. Most efficient PDs are based on single crystals,25–27 but polycrystalline thin films with improved defect tolerance are of particular interest.28–30
Compositional engineering on the B-site or X-site has to date been the most effective strategy to tune the optoelectronic properties of perovskites, leading to intensive studies on perovskite alloys. B-site Bi–Sb alloying has been employed for optical bandgap engineering altering the electronic structure via crystal chemistry, whereas X-site I–Br alloying is popular for bandgap engineering altering by transforming the crystal structure from 0D to 2D. However, it is not well understood whether the chemical or structural change led by alloying or the interplay of the two factors is more effective when it comes to the tuning of charge transport properties. In this study, we systematically study the effect of B-site, X-site, and dual-site alloying on the charge transport properties. We aim to decouple the effects of crystal chemistry and dimensionality influencing the optoelectronic properties of alloyed perovskites.
Results and discussion
We studied 9 different Sb–Bi-based halide perovskite materials with the common formula MA3B2X9 deposited from solution (Fig. 1). The film preparation procedure is detailed in the Experimental section. Below we discuss the structure of the obtained films, intrinsic charge transport, performance in lateral devices, and photostability of the prepared films.
 Fig. 1  Schematic grid with the studied materials. 
Crystal structure and chemistry
First, we looked at material chemistry and the crystal structure of the studied films. Fig. 2 shows that adding Br into the MA3(BixSb1−x)2(IyBr1−y)9 series leads to a change in the crystal phase as the value of y changes. A 2D connectivity was observed in MA3(Bi0.6Sb0.4)2(I0.6Br0.4)9. Further Br addition leads to a reduction in the lattice, as expected due to the smaller ionic radius of Br. Alloying the system with Sb alone, on the other hand, seems not have a significant impact on the crystal structure. Fig. 2d and e show the examples of 0D and 2D crystal structures of the studied systems. MA3B2I9 (B =Bi, Sb) exhibits a 0-dimensional dimmer structure, where the MI63−octohedra are connected by sharing edges. MA3B2Br9 (B =Bi, Sb), on the other hand, shows a 2-dimensional layered perovskite structure, where the corner-sharing MI63− octahedra form inorganic sheets with the organic MA ions sitting between the layers. Although the two crystal structures share similarities in the positions of the octahedra along the c-axis, the 3D arrangements of the inorganic framework are very different. The change of the crystal phase from 0D to 2D also results in morphological changes. Two representative scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) are shown in Fig. 3.

 Fig. 3  (a) SEM image of the 0D (a) and 2D (b) samples used in this study. 
The SEM images show that with the synthesis method used MA3Bi2I9, a 0D material, has a smaller crystal size than the 2D, Br-based sample MA3Bi2Br9. However, the same systems but with the additive NH4SCN showed the same size of crystals (Fig. S1, ESI†). The absorption edge shifts to lower wavelengths with increasing Br and Sb content as can be observed in Fig. 4. Along with the change from a 0D to a 2D structure, a 40% increase of the Sb content results in bandgap bowing. The estimated values of the bandgaps and dimensionality of all 9 systems are presented in Table S1, ESI.† In this way, based on XRD and UV-vis data, in the MA3(BixSb1−x)2(IyBr1−y)9 series, varying the value of x does not affect the phase; however, alloying Sb with Bi leads to a reduction in the bandgap, which is favourable for optoelectronic applications. To date, the key challenges for replacing lead halide perovskites with 0D MA3Bi2I9 lead-free perovskite in solar cells and photodetectors have been its wide bandgap and low conductivity.31 By alloying MA3Bi2I9 with Sb and Br, we aim to achieve high charge transport by structural dimensionality engineering (from 0D to 2D) and a low bandgap by chemical doping (from pure Bi to Bi–Sb alloys), and to understand the role of Sb and Br doping in emerging photodetection and solar cell applications.

Charge transport and dimensionality
In order to see how the change from 0D to 2D affects the electronic properties of the studied materials, we measured the photoexcited charge carrier transport properties of samples deposited on quartz. All samples were excited with 400 nm fs-laser pulses and probed with sub-picosecond THz pulses. Mobile charge carriers reduce THz transmission and from the reduction of THz transmission as a function of time (Fig. 5a), we calculated the THz carrier mobility (Fig. 5b) and lifetime (Fig. 5c). Fig. 3 shows the representative SEM images of the samples used for THz measurements. We found that the structural dimensionality has little impact on the THz mobility. Both 0D and 2D samples exhibited comparable charge carrier mobilities on par with literature reported 2D lead-based perovskites.32
 Fig. 5  Normalized THz transmission (a), calculated carrier mobility (b), and lifetime (c) of samples prepared on quartz. MA3Sb2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 are 0D materials. MA3 (Bi0.6Sb0.4)2(I0.6Br0.4)9, MA3Sb2Br9, and MA3Bi2Br9 are 2D materials, but all have comparable charge carrier mobility. 
Charge carrier lifetimes were not correlated with structural dimensionalities either, but rather with the crystal size. Fig. 5 shows that the carrier lifetimes of MA3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2Br9 are 3 and 9 ps, respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the grain size for MA3Bi2Br9 is considerably bigger than that for MA3Bi2I9. On the other hand, MA3Sb2Br9, another 2D sample, exhibited a carrier lifetime much shorter than that of MA3Bi2Br9, indicating that the dimensionality is not correlated with the carrier lifetime.
Another set of films were prepared with the additive NH4SCN to assist crystallization (Table S2, Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). In Fig. S1† we showed that by introducing additives, crystal grain sizes increased drastically. Hexagonal-shaped grains with around 5 μm size were achieved across all samples. The corresponding charge carrier lifetime also increased to at least 9 ps for all samples (Fig. S2†). The carrier mobility exhibited little change even though the grain sizes were larger. This is likely due to the fact that THz probes local carrier motion on a length scale much smaller than a grain.33 The crystal size has a direct impact on carrier lifetime values: recombination at grain boundaries likely is the reason why smaller grains have shorter lifetimes, while carrier mobility is independent of the crystal size.
We observed that despite structural changes from 0D to 2D, the carrier lifetime was largely determined by the crystal grain size and the local carrier mobility was not influenced by the connectivity of MX63− octahedra. It is widely accepted that layered perovskites (2D) exhibit lower carrier mobility than 3D perovskites,32,34,35 but little is known about how carrier mobility would vary from 2D to 0D structures. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggest that the 2D samples and 0D samples exhibit direct and indirect bandgap properties, respectively.36–39 Thus we would expect the carrier lifetime to be longer in the 0D indirect bandgap samples. We find, however, the predicted bandgap feature not strongly reflected in the light absorption curve. We also find that the crystal size has the dominant effect on the charge carrier lifetime. Thus, we do not expect that 2D structures would perform better than 0D in photodetectors.
Device fabrication and photodetection
In order to check our assumption that a structural change does not affect photodetector performance, we fabricated a set of lateral devices. Fig. 6 shows the schematic and actual photograph of the device. A detailed description of the fabrication procedure is described in the Experimental section. Each sample was exposed to 3 lasers: 405, 532, and 650 nm. The laser light intensity was varied from 1.75 μW cm−2 to 8.2 mW cm−2. The dependence of the light intensity of the laser on the applied current is given in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
 Fig. 6  Schematic (a) and visual (b) appearance of the studied lateral devices. 
When estimating the performance of the photodetector one should consider 3 main characteristics: photosensitivity (P), responsivity (R), and detectivity (D). Photosensitivity shows how sensitive the device towards a laser beam is. (1)where Iph, Iillum, and Idark are the photocurrent, current under laser illumination, and current in the dark, respectively.
For responsivity, the relationship between the generated current under the laser and the product of the photosensitivity and exposed sample area is (2)where Popt and Pinc are the optical and incident power respectively, and A is the exposed sample area. Finally, D is calculated using eqn (3): (3)where q is the absolute value of electron charge (1.6 × 10−19 coulombs).

Fig. 7a shows illumined I–V characteristics as well as responsivity at 405 nm. Complete P, R, and D characteristics for each system are presented in Table S1, ESI.† As can be seen, 2D MA3Bi2Br9 does not respond to any of the used lasers. This could be due to low absorption at 405 nm, but we found that by increasing the Sb content in the B-site the responsivity increased (0.17 mA W−1 for MA3(Bi0.6Sb0.4)2Br9 and 4 mA W−1 for MA3Sb2Br9).
 Fig. 7  Comparison of IV curves obtained with the 405 nm laser with 8.2 mW cm−2 intensity; (a) comparison of the responsivity (A W−1) and photostability (%) values of the studied materials (b). 
The addition of Sb and I atoms improves PD performance and expands the response region to 532 nm. The only material that showed photoresponse to all 3 lasers including 650 nm is 0D MA3Sb2I9. This material shows the highest responsivity of 19 mA W−1 and the highest P (314) and D (1.2 × 109 Jones) values. In this way, a combination of 2 factors: narrow bandgap and high content of Sb results in improved PD performance. We did not observe any correlation between the material dimensionality and PD performance. The I–V characteristics and transient photoresponse of all studied materials (Fig. S4–S6, ESI†) are available in the ESI.†
Stability and trade-offs between photoresponse and photostability
Next, each material was studied under illumination for 900 h in an inert atmosphere to reveal the most stable composition. The dynamic changes of XRD patterns and UV-vis spectra are presented in Fig. S7–S9, ESI.† Based on the XRD patterns of fresh and degraded samples, we can say that the crystallinity of all films significantly decreases with aging time. In some cases (MA3Sb2I9 and MA3Sb2(I0.4Br0.6)9), perovskite phases are completely destroyed by light due to the volatile nature of Sb atoms. In the case of Bi-based compounds (MA3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2(I0.4Br0.6)9), the perovskite phase degrades with the formation of new unknown phases and the color of the films changes from red to brown (Fig. S7, ESI†). The complete replacement of I with Br results in significant stabilization of perovskite phases; MA3Sb2Br9 and MA3Bi2Br9 did not degrade within the studied period of time. Bi–Sb alloys regardless of the I–Br content also showed improved stability. In fact, most of the Bi-containing systems withstand the aging test, showing superior photostability compared to traditional Pb-based perovskites.40
A combined photoresponse–stability diagram for all systems is presented in Fig. 7b. Photostability in % was estimated as the absorption edge of the aged sample after 900 h of light soaking (A900) @ 450 nm normalized to an initial level (A0): (4)
Photostability is a parameter that considers only absorption spectra decay with time. It is introduced here to simplify the comparison of the studied materials. As can be seen, the photostability of the materials is not connected with the structural dimensionality. 0D MA3(Bi0.4Sb0.6)2I9 is one of the most stable systems, while 0D MA3Sb2I9 is one of the least stable. Adding 40% Sb and Br improves the photostability up to 100%; however the complete replacement of Bi with Sb drastically reduces the film stability. In fact, 0D MA3Sb2I9, showing the best performance in a photodetector, turned out to be the least stable under illumination. The film disappeared within 100 h of light soaking according to UV-vis and XRD data (Fig. S9†). MA3(Bi0.6Sb0.4)2I9 showed the best stability among all the studied systems (Fig. 7b and S8, ESI†). However, the performance of this material in lateral devices is somewhat modest, and photoresponse was achieved only under the 405 nm laser with a R of 1.3 mA W−1 and D of 8.4 × 107 Jones (Table S1, ESI†).
In this way we can conclude that chemical composition is the key factor that affects the PD performance and photostability of thin films. A high content of Sb and I enables the highest responsivity of the photodetector; however, such systems are the least stable. Along with chemical composition, the photostability of thin films depends on crystallinity: the larger the grains, the more stable the material. MABi2Br9 having larger grains is more stable than MABi2I9 with smaller grains (Fig. 3 and 7b). To better understand how semiconductor chemical composition affects the photodetector lifetime, one should perform additional stability tests under electric bias to see if there is any charge transport decay. This direction of research remained beyond the scope of our work and should be addressed in future projects.
Experimental
Film fabrication
Perovskite precursor solutions were spin-coated onto clean UV-ozoned substrates (Quartz, FTO, or bare glass as discussed in paper). The substrates were cleaned with sonication in a 2% Hellmanex–DI water mixture, DI water, and IPA respectively for 15 minutes each. For sample set #1, we prepare perovskite solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma Aldrich) by mixing 3 ml of 0.8 M BiX3 or SbX3 (X = I/Br depending on the conjugate halide salt) solution with 2 ml of 0.8 M methylammonium halide (MAI or MABr), followed by heating at 323 K and vortexing until complete dissolution. The solutions were allowed to cool down before the subsequent mixing. The final solutions of desired compositions were prepared by mixing the prepared solutions of the same concentrations at the required volumetric ratio; for example, MA3Bi2(I0.6Br0.4)9 was prepared by mixing 40 microliters of MA3Bi2Br9 with 60 microliters of MA3Bi2I9. Sample set #2 was prepared with the addition of the NH4SCN additive (molar ratio of the additive: perovskite = 1:3). This recipe was reported previously.41 The glass substrates were pre-heated at 343 K for 10 minutes before the deposition. The spin-coating program follows a 2-step approach: 1000 rpm for 10 seconds and acceleration of 200 rpm s−1, with subsequent 6000 rpm for 30 seconds and acceleration of 2000 rpm s−1. Chlorobenzene (Sigma Aldrich) antisolvent at a quantity of 150 μL was added dropwise for 5 seconds at the beginning of the second step of spin-coating. The film thickness of all prepared samples is estimated to be 150 nm. The films were annealed for 30 minutes at 423 K for Bi-based films, 398 K for mixed Bi/Sb-based films, and 373 K for Sb-based films using the central part of a hot plate in a glovebox. The annealed samples were cooled to room temperature and cut into two parts using a glass cutter in the lab. One part remained fresh and used for THz, XRD, UV-vis, SEM measurements, and the second part was exposed to photodegradation.
Photodetector fabrication
To fabricate lateral devices, gold electrodes (100 nm) were deposited through a shadow mask on a set of samples prepared on glass substrates (the same recipe as mentioned above) using a physical vapour deposition (PVD) technique.
Photoaging conditions
The prepared films were subjected to light soaking in a specially designed aging chamber integrated into an MBraun glovebox (N2 atmosphere, H2O < 0.1 ppm, and O2 < 0.1 ppm). LED lamps were used as a light source with an average power of 70 ± 3 mW cm−2. The sample temperature during the experiments was approx. 55 ± 1 °C.
Characterisation tools
The charge carrier lifetime and mobility were measured using a 400 nm pump and THz probe setup. An amplified Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser (Coherent) was used for THz generation and sensing as well as generating the pump excitation at 400 nm. The 400 nm pulse (Fluence of 45 μJ cm−2) excites charge carriers in the sample, and free charge carriers attenuate the THz probe pulse, resulting in a negative change in THz transmission (ΔT). The photoconductivity of the sample is proportional to ΔT normalized by the initial THz transmission without pump excitation (T0). Assuming that each absorbed photon generates a free charge carrier, the peak of the photoconductivity at t = 0 is used to calculate the carrier mobility. In more detail, the carrier mobility is calculated using   where Z0 = 377 Ω is the impedance of air, Nphoton is the incident photon flux (#/cm2), q is the elementary charge, and nSiO2 is the index of refraction of the quartz substrate at THz frequencies. Fitting the photoconductivity decay as a function of time with an exponential function, we obtained the carrier lifetime in this material. Further details of the method can be found elsewhere.42
Scanning electron microscopy images were collected using a field emission SEM (Hitachi) at 5 kV and a signal was collected using a secondary electron detector.
UV-vis spectra were collected with an AvaSpec-2048-2 UV-vis fiber optic spectrometer integrated in a glovebox.
The X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained by using a Bruker Diffractometer with a CuKα source in an ambient atmosphere in fixed illumination mode with no sample rotation.
The photoresponse of the studied lateral devices was characterised by means of a Keithley 2612A instrument. The current–voltage characteristics were first measured in the dark. After that, the same characteristics were obtained under exposure to laser beams (405, 532, and 650 nm). To gain device responsivity data, the experiment was performed under a pulsed laser beam with 1 Hz frequency. The laser light intensity was varied from 1.75 μW cm−2 to 8.2 mW cm−2.
Conclusions
In this work, we studied how the composition of a Pb-free MA3B2X9 material affects its crystal structure, charge transport, photosensitivity and photostability properties. We found that adding 40% Br results in a change of material dimensionality from 0D to 2D regardless of the Sb–Bi content. However, this structural change affected neither the photoexcited carrier mobility nor the lifetime. However, the carrier lifetime was shown to strongly depend on the grain size. The crystal dimensionality has no impact on the photodetector performance either. What is important for high-performing lateral devices is a low bandgap (low Br-content) combined with a high content of Sb. Alloying MA3Bi2I9 with Sb and Br up to 40% results in improved photoresponse and photostability, which makes us conclude that mixed Bi–Sb and I–Br systems have good prospects for application not only in photodetectors but also in solar cells.
