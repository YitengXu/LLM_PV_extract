    , Accepted 6th February 2022First published on 7th February 2022AbstractA chlorophyll a derivative, namely pyropheophorbide a (Pyro), and the corresponding zinc(II) complex (Zn-Pyro) were used for the first time as visible-light photosensitizers (PS) for free-radical photopolymerization (FRP) when combined with an iodonium salt derivative (Iod) and different amines. The reaction mechanisms involving Pyro and Zn-Pyro coupled with Iod and/or MDEA were deeply investigated using steady-state photolysis, fluorescence experiments, laser-flash photolysis (LFP), and electron-paramagnetic resonance spin trapping (EPR-ST) methods. According to the remarkable absorption properties of Pyro and Zn-Pyro, FRP could occur under blue-light (LED@405 nm and LED@455 nm), and under red-light (LED@625 nm and LED@660 nm) irradiation. Conversions of up to 80% of PEG-diacrylate were obtained using two-component (PS/Iod and PS/amine) or three-component (PS/Iod/amine) photoinitiating systems. Several amines used as co-initiators were compared, and N-methyl-diethanolamine (MDEA) and the bio-based thiol-amine cysteamine (Cys) exhibited very interesting kinetic results. Notably, the performances in FRP obtained with the Zn-Pyro/Iod/Cys system constitute a promising step in the development of a fully bio-based photoinitiating system.
Introduction
To face both the economic and environmental issues of the last few decades, photopolymerization has provided impressive enlightenment. Indeed, this low-energy process allows high conversions to be obtained in a very short time, without the need for any solvent.1 This technology has notably attracted interest in industrial fields such as adhesives, coatings, inks, microelectronics1,2 and more recently 3D-printing technologies,3–5 and for medical applications.6 For the last decade, the photopolymerization process has made extensive use of UV-light irradiation. However, concerns emerged about UV handling safety, and its use is prohibited in some medical fields, such as dentistry7 or tissue engineering.6,8 This inspired growing research on the synthesis of new photo-initiators absorbing in the visible light range.2,9,10 Examples of blue-light sensitive photoinitiators for free-radical polymerization (FRP) or cationic photopolymerization (CP) have become abundant in the literature in the last few years.11 However, photoinitiation under red light12–14 or near-infrared light15,16 remains rare due to the low excitation energy of photons at these wavelengths. In this context, the use of macrocycles like phthalocyanines13,14,17–20 or porphyrins21–24 seems relevant because of their versatility and very high molar extinction coefficients in the visible spectrum, between 104 and 105 L mol−1 cm−1.25 This explains their wide applications ranging from photocatalysis26,27 to solar cells28–30 and photodynamic therapy.31–34
Not only do macrocycles present many functionalities for chemical modification, but their inner cavity can complex many different metals, modifying their chemical and photophysical properties.25 Recent environmental concerns lead to a decrease in the use of rare metals in preference of cost-effective and more readily available ones. Among them, magnesium and zinc are expected to conserve the photochemical stability of the macrocycles the best, thanks to their simple (ns)2 electronic configuration.35 In this respect, zinc(II)-5,10,15,20-meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (Zn-TPP) can be considered as the standard of porphyrin photo-initiators in the literature. Frequently used for RAFT photopolymerization,36,37 it has also been associated with iodonium salt to promote FRP and CP under visible light irradiation up to 530 nm.22 For instance, Zn-TPP was integrated in a three-component photo-initiating system with an electron-acceptor iodonium salt and an electron donor molecule (N-methyldiethanolamine, MDEA).21 Recently, Versace et al.24 highlighted the high potential of Zn-complexed and metal-free diphenyl porphyrins as photoinitiators for FRP and CP between 385 nm and 530 nm. Some examples of FRP under NIR were reported with porphyrin initiators, but using four-component systems to combine photothermal and photochemical initiation.23,38 Although synthetic products can show impressive photochemical properties, porphyrin derivatives also exist in nature, and take part in vital biological processes: chlorophyll a, which is the mainstay of photosynthesis; haemoglobin, which is the oxygen carrier in the blood; or the corrin structure at the base of vitamin B12.39 Several natural dyes have already been studied and found to promote photopolymerization under visible light,40–43 but they generally do not absorb in the red light range, contrary to free base porphyrins that possess absorption bands, namely Q bands, up to 650 nm. However, the application of natural porphyrin derivatives for free-radical polymerization is poorly described. Rodgers et al.44 used a derivative of vitamin B12 to initiate radical polymerization at long wavelengths, leading to the formation of hydrogels for tissue engineering. An attempt to use chlorophyll b and chlorophyllin copper salt as the PS for NIR photopolymerization revealed a low efficiency.14 Besides, natural macrocycles are mainly used in solution as a photosensitizer for RAFT photopolymerization, notably bacteriochlorophyll a,45 chlorophyll a,46,47 and its degradation product pheophorbide a.48
Although irradiation of porphyrins on their Q bands successfully leads to RAFT polymerization,47,49 it seems that red-light initiation of FRP remains challenging.11 The few reported works have highlighted that the efficiency of porphyrins as photoinitiators depends on many parameters (inner metal ion, peripheral substituents on the meso and β-pyrrolic positions, co-initiators). However, deep investigations on their initiation mechanism are often lacking in the literature.
In this study, we report the use of a chlorophyll a derivative, namely pyropheophorbide a (Pyro), as a visible-light photosensitizer (PS) for free-radical photopolymerization. This chlorin is frequently studied due to its fluorescence properties50,51 and its ability to generate singlet oxygen upon visible light irradiation.52,53 Its solubilization is easier than that of chlorophyll, due to the absence of a phytyl side chain. To evaluate the influence of metal complexation on the photochemical and photo-initiating properties, Pyro was also compared to the corresponding zinc(II) complex-Pyro (Zn-Pyro, Fig. 1). Low-intensity blue LEDs (LED@405 nm and LED@455 nm) and red LEDs (LED@625 nm and LED@660 nm) were used as visible-light sources. Pyro (or Zn-Pyro) was firstly associated with an iodonium salt (Iod) and/or N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), to form two-component (PS/Iod and PS/MDEA) or three-component (PS/Iod/MDEA) photo-initiating systems for FRP. The affinity of the PS toward each additive permitted the determination of which type of mechanism occurred in the three-component system (a photo-reducible or photo-oxidizable process). The kinetic performances in the FRP of PEG-diacrylate resulting from the addition of other co-initiators, i.e. N-benzyldimethyl amine (BDMA), N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA), and bio-sourced riboflavin (Ribo), L-arginine (Argi) and cysteamine (Cys) were also investigated. The originality of this study lies in the first use of a chlorophyll derivatives as a PS for blue and red-light initiated free-radical photopolymerization, with a deep investigation on the initiating mechanism, and the development of fully bio-based photo-initiating systems, with the first reported use of cysteamine as a co-initiator. The reactivity of the porphyrin-like structures was investigated in both the singlet and triplet states, using steady-state photolysis, fluorescence spectroscopy, laser flash photolysis (LFP), and electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The FRP of a biocompatible macromonomer, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), was also kinetically followed by Real-Time Fourier-Transformed Infrared spectroscopy (RT-FTIR) and the reactivities of the different chlorophyll-derived photoinitiating systems, under air and in a laminate, were compared.

Synthesis of pyropheophorbide a (Pyro)
Spirulina algae powder provided by PhycoBiotech® was used as the starting material and chlorophyll a was extracted using Soxhlet apparatus. Then, pyropheophorbide a was synthesized according to reported procedures.54–56 The spectroscopic data are in agreement with the structure of pyropheophorbide a. 1H NMR (400 MHz, Pyridine-d5):δ = 9.88, 9.73, 8.86 (each s, each 1H, 5, 10, 20-H), 8.22 (dd, J = 17.8, 11.5 Hz, 1H, 31-H), 6.38 (dd, J = 17.8, 1.5 Hz, 1H, 32-CH), 6.19 (dd, J = 11.5, 1.5 Hz, 1H, 32-CH), 5.59, 5.29 (each d AB syst, J = 19.8 Hz, 132-CH2), 4.64, 4.52 (each m, each 1H, 17-,18-H), 3.74 (q, J = 7.7 Hz, 2H, 81-CH2), 3.72 (s, 121-CH3), 3.39 (s, 21-CH3), 3.25 (s, 3H, 71-CH3), 3.02 (m, 2H, 172-H), 2.76 (m, 1H, 171-H), 2.53 (m, 1H, 171-H), 1.88 (d, J = 7.3 Hz, 3H, 181-CH3), 1.70 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 3H, 82-CH3), −1.43 (s, 2H, NH) ppm. 13C(1H) NMR (101 MHz, pyridine-d5):δ = 196.0, 176.1, 172.8, 162.4, 155.7, 151.7, 149.5, 145.8, 142.0, 138.7, 137.0, 136.7, 136.3, 132.5, 131.7, 130.0, 128.9, 123.0, 107.4, 104.9, 97.9, 94.5, 52.7, 50.7, 48.8, 32.3, 31.1, 23.7, 20.0, 18.1, 12.5, 12.3, 11.6 ppm.

Synthesis of Zn-pyropheophorbide a (Zn-Pyro)
The zinc complex of pyropheophorbide a was synthesized according to our reported procedure.57 Briefly, a saturated methanol solution of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (10 mL) was added to a solution of pyropheophorbide a (50 mg, 0.0935 mmol) in THF (50 mL). After stirring overnight, the solution turned from brown to green. The mixture was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum. The crude material was then recrystallized from a CH2Cl2/n-pentane 1:9 (50 mL) mixture to afford the desired Zn-pyropheophorbide a in 80% yield (45 mg, 0.0748 mmol). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, Pyridine-d5):δ = 9.98, 9.75, 8.71 (each s, each 1H, meso 5, 10 and 20-H), 8.31 (dd, J = 17.7, 11.4 Hz, 1H, 31-H), 6.32 (dd, J = 17.7, ∼1 Hz, 1H, 32-CH), 6.08 (dd, J = 11.4, ∼1 Hz, 1H, 32-CH), 5.50, 5.21 (each d AB syst, J = 19.6 Hz, 132-CH2), 4.61, 4.45 (each m, each 1H, 17-,18-H), 3.81 (q, J = 7.9 Hz, 2H, 81-CH2), 3.81 (s, 121-CH3), 3.41 (s, 21-CH3), 3.29 (s, 3H, 71-CH3), 2.99 (m, 2H, 172-H), 2.67 (m, 1H, 171-H), 2.55 (m, 1H, 171-H), 1.79 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 3H, 181-CH3), 1.72 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 3H, 82-CH3) ppm. HR ESI-TOF+MS: m/z calcd for C33H33N4O3Zn [M + H]+ 597.1839 Da, found 597.1828 Da.
NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry
NMR spectra were acquired at the Laboratoire de Mesures Physiques (LMP) of the University of Montpellier (UM) on a Bruker 400 MHz Avance III HD spectrometer at 298 K. Pyridine-d5 was used as received (purchased from Eurisotop, France). It was the most suitable solvent to obtain spectra with well resolved signals for both compounds. 1H and 13C(1H) NMR spectra were calibrated to TMS on the basis of the relative chemical shift of the residual non-deuterated solvent as an internal standard. Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in ppm from the residual non-deuterated solvent signal and coupling constant values (J) are expressed in Hz. The abbreviations used for the NMR spectra are as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quadruplet; m, multiplet. High resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker MicroTof QII instrument in positive/negative modes (ESI†).
UV-visible absorption spectra
UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda 2 UV-vis spectrophotometer.
Steady-state photolysis
Solutions of Pyro and Zn-Pyro were prepared in ACN. The different photosensitizers were irradiated under air with an LED@405 nm (25 mW cm−2), alone or in the presence of a co-initiator: Iod, amines or Iod/amines.
EPR experiment
The EPR spectra in the X-band (modulation frequency of 100 kHz) were measured by means of an EMX spectrometer (Bruker) with a TE102 cavity, or an EMXplus spectrometer (Bruker) with the High Sensitivity Probe-head (Bruker) in a small quartz flat cell (WG 808-Q, Wilmad-LabGlass) or using thin-walled quartz EPR tubes (Bruker). The solutions prepared in acetonitrile (ACN) or benzene carefully saturated with argon were irradiated at 293 K directly in the EPR resonator using an LED@400 nm source (λmax = 400 nm; Bluepoint LED, Hönle UV Technology), and the EPR spectra were measured in situ during/after a defined irradiation time as described previously.58 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, distilled prior to application, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the spin trapping agent. The experimental EPR spectra were processed by WinEPR software (Bruker) and the simulated spectra were calculated with the EasySpin toolbox working on the MatLab® platform.59 The detailed information regarding the EPR spectrometer settings is noted in the figure captions.
Nanosecond laser flash photolysis
The setup is based on a nanosecond Nd:TAG laser (Powerlite 9010, Continuum) at 5 Hz with a 7–8 ns impulse time. LP920 software (Edinburgh Instruments) is used to analyse the data and is coupled with a 450 W pulsed xenon arc lamp, a Czerny-Turner monochromator (bandwidth = 5 nm corrected with an emission filter LP314), a fast photomultiplier (PMT R928 fast mode) and a transient digitizer (TDS 340, Tektronix). A 1 cm-width quartz cell was used. Samples were irradiated at 355 nm in ACN, with [Pyro] = 10−5 M and [Zn-Pyro] = 5 × 10−5 M. The experiments were performed at room temperature and under an argon atmosphere.
Steady-state fluorescence experiment
Fluorescence spectra were recorded from a FluroroMax-4 spectrofluorometer according to a previously described method.58 5,10,15,20-Tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) in DMF (Φf° = 0.1160) was used as a reference to calculate the fluorescence quantum yields.
Cyclic voltammetry
An AUTOLAB potentiometer/galvanometer was used with a three-electrode cell configuration. A vitreous carbon electrode, a gold wire, and a saturated calomel electrode were chosen as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A solution of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate ([NEt4BF4] = 0.1 M) in DMF was used as the supporting electrolyte. Measurements were carried out on photosensitizer solutions (C = 10−3 M) between 0 and 2 V for oxidation, and between 0 and −2 V for reduction, with a 0.05 V s−1 scan rate. The data were analysed on GPES electrochemical software 4.9 (Utrecht, Netherlands).
Photopolymerization kinetic studies
0.5 mg of PS (0.2 wt% with respect to the monomer) were dissolved with 7.5 mg of Iod (3 wt% of active species with respect to the monomer) or/and 2 mg of amine co-initiator (0.8 wt%) in 250 mg of PEGDA. The formulations were stirred and left in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min before the experiment. 12 μm-layers of solution were laid down on BaF2 pellets and irradiated with LED@405 nm (25 mW cm−2), LED@455 nm (15 mW cm−2), LED@625 nm (45 mW cm−2) or LED@660 nm (10 mW cm−2) under air or in a laminate at room temperature. The infrared spectra of the samples were recorded by Real-Time Fourier Transform InfraRed Spectroscopy (RT-FTIR) on a JASCO FTIR 4700 Instrument. The decrease of the acrylate function absorption bands was followed at 1636 cm−1 for the acrylate of PEGDA.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and absorption properties of Pyro and Zn-Pyro
Free base pyropheophorbide a (Pyro) was prepared as reported in the literature in five steps: (i) extraction of chlorophyll a from commercially available spirulina powder with ethanol, (ii) demetallation of chlorophyll a, (iii) acid-catalyzed transesterification of the phytyl chain in methanol, (iv) decarboxylation of the ester moiety located on the 13-position with 2,4,6-collidine, and (v) hydrolysis of the ester group on the 17-position with hydrochloric acid in acetone.54–561H and 13C NMR spectra of Pyro are presented, respectively, in Fig. S1 and S2,† and its HR ESI-TOF mass spectrum is provided in Fig. S3.† Then, zinc(II) pyropheophorbide a (Zn-Pyro) was obtained in 80% yield by reacting free base derivative Pyro with Zn(OAc)2·2H2O in THF.57 As expected, the signal of the inner NH at δ = −1.43 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum of Pyro disappeared upon complexation of zinc(II). The 1H NMR and mass spectra of Zn-Pyro are reported in Fig. S4 and S5,† respectively.

Fig. 2 shows the superimposed UV-visible absorption spectra of Pyro and Zn-Pyro in ACN. Chlorin macrocycles, like porphyrins, are highly conjugated π-electron systems, which exhibit absorption properties due to strong π–π* transitions. Well-known characteristic bands of porphyrin derivatives can be identified. The Soret absorption (or B) bands at 420 nm and 427 nm for Pyro and Zn-Pyro, respectively, are attributed to the S0 → S2 transition. The Q bands, between 500 and 750 nm, have generally lower intensities and correspond to the S0 → S1 transitions. It is noticeable that the number of Q bands is reduced from four to three when the cycle is complexed by a Zn2+ ion, due to the increased symmetry in the structure.25 Introduction of Zn2+ leads to a red shift of the B band and a blue shift of the Q bands. The same behaviour was already observed for Zn-complexed chlorophyll a.35 The shifts observed in the B and Q bands can be qualitatively described by the four-orbital model.61,62 According to this orbital model, the UV/vis spectra are described as electronic transitions between four orbitals: (1) the a2u and a1u orbitals have, respectively, high electron densities and no electron density on the four nitrogens next to the metal center in the inner hole of the porphyrin structure, and (2) the egx and egy orbitals present low electron densities on only two nitrogens. The B bands correspond to both transitions from a2u to egy and from a1u to egy, whereas the Q-bands are considered as transitions from a2u to egx, and from a2u to a1u. Thus, changes in the effective charge at the inner center of the porphyrin structure are expected to modify the orbital energies, via electrostatic interactions with the π electrons. Therefore, the addition of Zn2+ ions inherently modifies the energy levels of the electronic transitions through electrostatic interactions between the N-centered π-electron densities and Zn metal. Shelnutt and coworkers also identified that the nonplanar distortions in the inner hole of the porphyrin structure twist the Cα–Cm bonds, resulting in the increase of the Cα–N–Cα bond angles directly leading to the Soret red shift.63
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of Pyro (C = 1.0 × 10−5 M (dash line)) and Zn-Pyro (C = 1.0 × 10−5 M (red solid line)) in ACN, superimposed on the emission spectra of LED@405 nm, LED@455 nm, LED@625 nm and LED@660 nm. 
High molar extinction coefficients, reported in Table 2, are in the expected ranges of chlorin structures, i.e. between 104 and 105 L mol−1 cm−1, and close to what was reported in the literature.64,65 The decrease of molar extinction coefficient following Zn-complexation is not systematic and depends on the macrocycle structure.24,35,66 The highest absorption bands B of Pyro and Zn-Pyro overlap with the emission spectra of LED@405 nm and LED@455 nm, while the Q bands overlap with those of LED@625 nm and LED@660 nm. This points out their high potential as photosensitizers under blue and red-light irradiation.

Iod and N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) are associated with Pyro and Zn-pyro and were chosen as reference co-initiators. Initiation by two components (PS/Iod and PS/MDEA) and three-components (PS/Iod/MDEA) was considered in the following section. Three-component photoinitiating systems are often used to increase the polymerization rates, conversions, and oxygen tolerance, but also for PS saving, as the latter could be regenerated in the mechanism.21 The PS/Iod/MDEA system either reacts following a photo-reducible or photo-oxidizable pathway, in which the PS is firstly reduced or oxidized, respectively. The Rehm–Weller equation (eqn (S1)†) was used to predict which mechanism may occur. The electrochemical characteristics of the compounds and values of electron-transfer Gibbs energy ΔG are reported in Table 3. Calculations indicate that the electron transfer reaction at the singlet state is thermodynamically possible from both Pyro and Zn-Pyro to Iod (ΔGIods < 0), contrary to the electron transfer process from MDEA to porphyrin derivatives (ΔGMDEAs > 0). Therefore, the involved photochemical mechanisms at the single excited state of Pyro and Zn-Pyro will be first verified by steady-state photolysis and fluorescence measurements. The generated radical species will be then identified by EPR spin-trapping, and laser flash photolysis experiments allow the determination of whether photochemical reactions are also possible from the triplet excited states of Pyro and Zn-Pyro.

Steady state photolysis of Pyro and Zn-Pyro in the presence of Iod, MDEA and Iod/MDEA
Steady-state photolysis was used as a first approach to observe experimentally the interaction of the chlorins with Iod and MDEA. Photolysis of Pyro and Zn-Pyro under LED@405 nm (25 mW cm−2) alone or in the presence of different additives is reported in Fig. 3 and S4,† respectively. Their irradiation alone emphasizes the lower photostability of Zn-Pyro (Fig. S9A†) compared to its free-base analogue (Fig. 3A). This photobleaching could be due to electronic interaction between the metal center and the chlorin ligand. Pyro slightly reacts with the addition of Iod or MDEA, with a low absorption decrease (Fig. 3B and C). This behaviour does not significantly differ when Iod and MDEA are added simultaneously (Fig. 3D). When Zn-Pyro is combined with Iod, both the B and Q band absorbance decreases significantly (Fig. S9B†), which suggests a high interaction between Zn-Pyro and Iod. On the contrary, no noticeable absorption change is observed when Zn-Pyro is associated with MDEA (Fig. S9C†), in agreement with Rehm–Weller's predictions. The photolysis of Zn-Pyro/Iod/MDEA (Fig. S9D†) leads to a lower decrease than those observed with the Zn-Pyro/Iod system, suggesting a regeneration of Zn-Pyro.

Reactivity of Pyro and Zn-Pyro in the singlet excited state observed by fluorescence quenching
To determine the reactivity of the PSs in the singlet excited state, fluorescence experiments have been done and all data are gathered in Table 3. As the internal conversion from S2 to S1 is generally an efficient process in porphyrin derivatives,25 only the fluorescence from the first singlet excited state S1, corresponding to the Q bands, is observable.25 Excitation was carried out from the B band maximal absorption wavelength to optimize photon absorption. Interestingly, the fluorescence signal of Pyro after excitation at 420 nm is identical to that observed when the Q-band of Pyro (maximal absorption at 690 nm) is excited. The same behaviour was observed with Zn-Pyro.
Regarding Pyro, a maximum of fluorescence is observed at 696 nm, with a fluorescence quantum yield of Φfluo = 0.16. A quenching of fluorescence was observed in the presence of Iod (Fig. 4) with a quite high fluorescence constant KIodSV = 13.8 M−1, comparable to the one reported for the metal-free diphenyl porphyrin (KIodSV = 9 M−1).24 The associated electron transfer yield φeT = 0.51 ([Iod] = 7.4 × 10−2 M) was calculated from φeT = KIodSV [Iod]/(1 + KIodSV [Iod]). When MDEA was added to Pyro (Fig. S10†), the quenching of fluorescence was calculated to be ten times lower (KSVMDEA = 1.4 M−1) than KIodSV, and a low electron transfer yield φeT = 0.10 ([MDEA] = 7.5 × 10−2 M) was demonstrated. This last value is not surprising as Rehm–Weller-equation predicted unfavourable PS/MDEA interaction (Table 3). In the case of Zn-Pyro, a fluorescence emission was observed at 663 nm with Φfluo = 0.18. Only the quenching by Iod was effective (Fig. S11†) with a fluorescence quenching constant (KIodSV = 111.8 M−1) about ten times higher than that for Pyro/Iod or Zn-diphenylporphyrin (KIodSV = 8.7 M−1)24 and about two times higher than the reported value for Zn-TPP/Iod (KIodSV = 59.3 M−1).22 The electron transfer quantum yield is evaluated at φeT = 0.89 ([Iod] = 7.4 × 10−2 M). This observation supports Rehm–Weller's predictions (Table 3) and our previous photolysis observations between Zn-Pyro and Iod (Fig. S9B†).

Reactivity of the triplet excited state of Pyro and Zn-Pyro by laser flash photolysis
Porphyrin derivatives are known to undergo intense intersystem crossing, leading to high triplet quantum yields.25 Laser Flash photolysis experiments allow the transient absorption spectra of the two photosensitizers to be obtained between 370 nm and 750 nm under excitation at 355 nm (Fig. S12 and S13† for Pyro and Zn-Pyro, respectively). All associated data are reported in Table 4. Maxima of absorption corresponding to the triplet states of Pyro and Zn-Pyro are observed at 470 nm and 460 nm, respectively, with lifetimes of 7.8 μs and 4.3 μs, respectively. Not surprisingly, the triplet lifetime of Zn-Pyro is shorter than that of Pyro according to heavy-metal interaction effects.35 The observations for Pyro are close to those reported in the literature for pheophorbide a.64

Both photosensitizers in their triplet state are sensitive to molecular oxygen (Fig. S14 and S15†), with an oxygen quenching constant kPyroO2 = 3.5 × 108 L mol−1 s−1 and kZn-PyroO2 = 3.8 × 108 L mol−1 s−1. These values are two to three times lower than those described in the literature for pheophorbide a (kO2 = 109 L mol−1 s−1).64 The reactivity of the triplet excited state of Pyro and Zn-Pyro toward Iod and MDEA at the triplet state are also evaluated by triplet quenching experiments. For both chlorins, addition of Iod seems to have no influence on the excited triplet state. Interestingly, new long-term living species appear by LFP in the presence of MDEA (Fig. 5 for Pyro and Fig. S16† for Zn-Pyro): one around 660 nm for Pyro, and one at the same wavelength as the triplet state (460 nm) for Zn-Pyro. Although this observation could not be cross-checked with literature data, it can be hypothesized that the newly formed species with MDEA are intermediary exciplex species prior to the formation of initiating radicals.69

Identification of radical species by EPR-spin-trapping (EPR-ST)
Species involved in the reaction mechanism were identified by EPR-ST. All experiments were performed in deoxygenated acetonitrile and using LED@400 nm as an irradiation source. The irradiation of Pyro/DMPO led only to the generation of a low-intensity signal corresponding to the DMPO-adduct with a carbon-centered radical (˙DMPO-CR′; aN = 1.470 mT, aβH = 2.157 mT; g = 2.0059 ± 0.0001;70 spectra not shown). The formation of the carbon-centred radical is probably due to an intramolecular H-abstraction reaction. Upon the photoactivation of Pyro/Iod/DMPO solutions under the given experimental conditions, a six-line EPR signal is observed (Fig. S17†) characterized by the spin-Hamiltonian parameters well compatible with the ˙DMPO-phenyl(4-methyl) spin-adduct (Table S1†),71 evidencing the photoinduced electron transfer between Pyro and Iod. Fig. S18† shows the experimental and simulated EPR spectra obtained upon irradiation of Pyro/MDEA/DMPO, revealing the superposition of two signals, i.e. the dominant ˙DMPO-CR (aminoalkyl) overlaps the second signal described by the spin-Hamiltonian parameters, which are almost identical to those obtained for the DMPO-adduct with a carbon-centered radical monitored upon exposure of Pyro/ACN/DMPO solution; consequently this six-line signal was assigned to the ˙DMPO-CR′ spin-adduct. The signal of the ˙DMPO-phenyl(4-methyl) spin-adduct (with well-resolved 13C-satellites) dominates the EPR spectrum measured upon irradiation of a deoxygenated acetonitrile solution of Pyro/Iod/MDEA, especially upon a short irradiation time (Fig. 6A, Table S1†). The best fit of the experimental EPR spectrum revealing the asymmetry in the line intensities was obtained by including a small contribution of the ˙DMPO-CR′ spin-adduct (relative concentration 12%). The prolonged exposure of Pyro/Iod/MDEA/DMPO resulted in the gradual increase of the relative concentration of the ˙DMPO-CR(aminoalkyl) adduct, and the simulated spectrum in Fig. 6B was calculated as the superposition of the three abovementioned EPR signals, along with the triplet representing the DMPO degradation product (* in Fig. 6B).

The normalized experimental (1) and simulated (2) EPR spectra obtained in Pyro/Iod/MDEA/ACN solutions in the presence of a DMPO spin trap under argon upon in situ LED@400 nm exposure: (A) 225 s; (B) 1350 s. EPR spectrometer settings: microwave frequency, ∼9.453 GHz; microwave power, 10.03 mW; center field, ∼335.3 mT; sweep width, 7 mT; gain, 1.00 × 105; modulation amplitude, 0.1 mT; sweep time, 45 s; time constant, 10.24 ms; number of scans, 5. The three-line signal (*) represents the DMPO degradation product (aN = 1.435 mT; g = 2.0060). 
The EPR spectra measured in the presence of DMPO in the photoinitiating systems containing Zn-Pyro (Fig. S19–S21†) reflect the analogous photoinduced processes, as were monitored for Pyro. The photoactivation of Zn-Pyro/Iod/DMPO resulted in the generation of a ˙DMPO-phenyl(4-methyl) adduct (Fig. S19†), and the photoinduced generation of a ˙DMPO-CR(aminoalkyl) adduct was evidenced during exposure of deoxygenated Zn-Pyro/MDEA/DMPO solutions (Fig. S20†). The EPR spectra measured in the photoinitiating systems Zn-pyro/Iod/MDEA/ACN represent superposition of two signals assigned to ˙DMPO-phenyl(4-methyl) and ˙DMPO-CR (aminoalkyl) adducts with the relative concentration affected by the irradiation time, and upon prolonged exposure the relative abundance of the latter adduct increased (Fig. S21;† the three-line signal (*) represents the DMPO degradation product).
Besides, the EPR spectra of Zn-Pyro/Iod and Zn-Pyro/MDEA without spin-traps (Fig. S22†) were measured to evidence the potential formation of ionic radical species. The photoactivation of Zn-Pyro in the presence of Iod resulted in the generation of a paramagnetic signal with a slightly indicated hyperfine structure and g = 2.0029 (Fig. S22A†), in good correlation with the reported g-values for the radical cation of Zn-tetraphenylchlorins (g = 2.0030),72 or Zn-tetraphenylporphyrins,22 but slightly lower than the g-values published for a series of one-electron oxidized bacteriochlorins.73 As the prolonged exposure of the photoinitiating systems led to the gradual decrease in the EPR signal intensity, the resolution was not sufficient to evaluate the hyperfine coupling constants. The low-intensity EPR signal observed in the irradiated Zn-Pyro/MDEA/ACN solution (Fig. S22B†) is characterized by a small increase in the g-value (g = 2.0035),72,73 and may be tentatively assigned to the corresponding radical anion generated via one-electron reduction of photoexcited Zn-Pyro by MDEA (as confirmed by LFP results).
Proposed mechanism
According to fluorescence experiments, EPR spin-trapping and LFP results, chlorins seem to preferentially react from their singlet excited state with Iod through a fast electron transfer reaction, consequently producing initiating (4-methyl)phenyl radicals. Rehm–Weller predictions (Table 3) and the high fluorescence quenching rate of Pyro and Zn-Pyro by Iod confirm that an electron transfer reaction in the singlet state is thermodynamically possible from both Pyro and Zn-Pyro to Iod as ΔGIod < 0. Pyro and Zn-Pyro can also undergo an electron transfer process in the presence of MDEA, followed by a H-abstraction reaction evidenced by the formation of exciplex species at the triplet state and the formation of aminoalkyl radicals from MDEA: however, according to the Rehm–Weller equation, this reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable with ΔGMDEA > 0. Therefore, the three-component photoinitiating systems, e.g. PS/Iod/MDEA, should react through a photo-oxidizable-type mechanism (Scheme S1†), which is considered as more efficient than the photo-reducible one.21 Indeed, if photo-reducible mechanisms are frequently met in the literature,74–76 back-electron transfer and recombination side reactions21 are the main drawbacks. In the photo-oxidizable mechanism involving PS/Iod/MDEA, irreversible fragmentation of Iod rapidly occurs, preventing the back-electron transfer reaction. PS radical cations (PS˙+) are subsequently generated along with phenyl-derived radicals from the photolysis of Iod. As a consequence of the reduction of PS˙+ by MDEA, PS is regenerated. Also, the highly reactive phenyl-derived radicals are likely involved in a H-abstraction reaction with a H-donor molecule (DH, MDEA) leading to efficient initiating radicals (D˙, aminoalkyl radicals) as confirmed by the EPR results.
Kinetic studies of the PEGDA free-radical photopolymerization
Photopolymerization kinetic studies were performed to validate the mechanism hypothesis presented above. Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), a biocompatible acrylate monomer, was chosen for its ability to undergo free-radical polymerization and its common use for medical applications.77–80 Irradiation was carried out on the B band of PS using LED@405 nm and LED@455 nm (Fig. 7 and S23†), but also on the Q band with LED@625 nm and LED@660 nm (Fig. S24†). PS/Iod/MDEA initiating systems were compared to PS/Iod and PS/MDEA ones to distinguish the contribution of each additive, and evaluate the benefit of using a three-component photoinitiating system. Final acrylate conversions are reported in Table 5, and the corresponding initial polymerization rates are summarized in Table S2.† A classical commercial porphyrin, 5,10,15,20-meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP), was used as a reference (Fig. S25 and S26†).

When MDEA is used as a co-initiator, high conversions were obtained for both chlorins under a laminate (Fig. 7(1) and S24-1†). The final acrylate conversions obtained under red light are higher than those previously reported in the literature for two-component systems.12 Interestingly, a high reactivity is also observed using Cys as a co-initiator (Fig. S23†) and constitutes an innovative and fully biobased photo-initiating system when combined with Pyro and Zn-Pyro.
High conversions are also observed with the Pyro/Iod and Zn-Pyro/Iod initiating systems in a laminate (Fig. 7(2) and S24-2,†Table 5(2)). The reaction occurred faster in the presence of Zn-Pyro/Iod than Pyro/Iod due to the higher reactivity of Zn-Pyro toward Iod in the singlet state and compared to Pyro/Iod, as previously described in the fluorescence experiments (KIodSV(Zn-Pyro) almost ten times higher than KIodSV(Pyro)). Under air, the high sensitivity of phenyl-derived radicals toward oxygen, a powerful radical-scavenger, prevents FRP from occurring, as frequently reported in the literature.20,81
In the three-component PS/Iod/MDEA systems (Table 5(3)), very high conversions (all above 60%) are obtained in the laminate, under both 405 nm and 455 nm, and within 100 s (Fig. 7(3)). These conversions are close to those reported with HEMA photopolymerization initiated by Zn-TPP/Iod/MDEA.21 Interestingly, high conversions are obtained under LED@625 nm and LED@660 nm (Fig. S24-3†), but they remain lower than those observed at 405 and 455 nm, certainly due to the lower molar extinction coefficients of the Q-band than the B-band. To our knowledge, this is the first use of a porphyrinoid-based three-component system for red-light FRP initiation without adding a thermal initiator.23,38 While chlorophyll b and chlorophyllin have been reported as slow initiating photoinitiators under red light,14Pyro and Zn-Pyro allow conversions of up to 60% to be reached under LED@625 nm in this study. Surprisingly, although Pyro/MDEA was the only two-component systems able to initiate polymerization under air according to the formation of aminoalkyl radicals (see EPR results), Pyro/Iod/MDEA could not. This is consistent with the photo-oxidizable mechanism, in which Pyro firstly reacts with Iod: the sensitivity of the methylphenyl radicals toward oxygen does not allow FRP to occur. However, polymerization under air is observed in the presence of Zn-Pyro/Iod/MDEA, which could be explained by the higher reactivity of Zn-Pyro toward Iod under air as compared to Pyro: indeed KIodSV (Zn-Pyro) is ten times higher than that with Pyro. Again, the highest rates of polymerization with Zn-Pyro in the laminate as compared to Pyro are obvious in the polymerization profiles at all wavelengths (Table S2†), confirming the higher interaction between Zn-Pyro and Iod than that observed with Pyro. The final conversions are comparable to those obtained with TPP-based reference systems (Fig. S25 and S26†).
Other amines were compared to MDEA for evaluating their performances as co-initiators (Fig. 8), i.e. N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA) and N-benzyldimethylamine (BDMA), and three bio-sourced compounds (riboflavin (Ribo), L-arginine (Argi) and cysteamine (Cys)). Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, can be found in food and is involved in many biological processes.82L-Arginine is an amino acid playing an essential role in the metabolism of birds, carnivores and young mammals.83 Cysteamine is produced endogenously from the degradation of coenzyme a and has many applications in the medical field.84 This last amine presents the advantage of having a H-donor group, i.e. a thiol function. The Zn-Pyro/Iod/amine photoinitiating systems lead to systematically higher polymerization rates than the Pyro/Iod/amine ones, but the final acrylate conversions for both systems are similar. The replacement of MDEA by DMA, BDMA, Ribo, Argi or Cys as the co-initiator emphasizes that the nature of the amine used is an interesting factor to play with for tuning the reactivity of the three-component system. Interestingly, the reactivities of the different amines in the three-component photoinitiating systems PS/Iod/amine (final conversions as well as polymerization rates) are not correlated to the amine oxidation potentials (Table S3†), but rather suggest that the reactivity toward acrylate monomers and the nature of the resulting aminoalkyl radical generated by the H-abstraction reaction between the amine and phenyl-derived radicals are the main factors as previously suggested by computational investigations.85 Noteworthily, the use of Cys promotes polymerization under air in the presence of both Pyro and Zn-Pyro. For Cys, the low sensitivity to oxygen can be easily explained by the involvement of the thiol group in the photopolymerization mechanism (eqn (1)–(3)). The phenyl radical generated by the photolysis of Iod can abstract a hydrogen from the thiol to form an initiating thiyl radical R-S˙. If this radical is scavenged by O2, the resulting peroxyl radical R-SOO˙ can regenerate a new thiyl radical by a H-abstraction reaction (eqn (3)):86 (1) H2N–CH2–CH2–S˙ + O2 → H2N–CH2–CH2–SOO˙(2) (3)

PS/Iod/amine (0.2%/3%/0.8% w/w/w). 
Therefore, the kinetic profiles demonstrate the benefits of using a three-component photoinitiating system over two-component ones, i.e. fast initiating process and high final conversions even in the presence of oxygen. According to the reactivity of the PS with either Iod or MDEA, it can be supposed that the occurrence of a photo-oxidizable mechanism has two strengths: (i) fast interaction between PS and Iod responsible to the formation of phenyl derived radicals and (ii) H-abstraction reactions generating amino-alkyl radicals even in the presence of oxygen: they act as oxygen-trappers to form peroxyl radicals that can abstract a proton from the amine to regenerate the amino-alkyl radicals.20
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that chlorophyll a derivatives, when associated with suitable co-initiators, can be used as efficient photoinitiating systems in FRP under visible-light irradiation. The replacement of classical amine co-initiators by bio-sourced ones can also promote free-radical photopolymerization. This is particularly true in the case of cysteamine, bearing a thiol group, which has been used here for the first time as a co-initiator in a laminate and under air. The deep mechanistic investigations on PS/Iod, PS/MDEA and PS/Iod/MDEA interactions by fluorescence, EPR and laser flash photolysis experiments highlight the interest of using three-component systems through a photo-oxidizable mechanism to reach high final acrylate conversions in a short time and under visible-light irradiation (from 405 to 660 nm). Chlorophyll a derivatives seem to preferentially react from their singlet excited state with Iod through a fast electron transfer reaction, consequently producing initiating (4-methyl)phenyl radicals along with PS radical cations (PS˙+), which are subsequently reduced by MDEA to regenerate PS. The highly reactive phenyl-derived radicals are likely involved in a H-abstraction reaction with the H-donor molecule (MDEA) leading to efficient initiating radicals (D˙, aminoalkyl radicals). Notably, interesting kinetics results with Zn-Pyro and cysteamine were observed under visible-light irradiation, which have never been described in the literature before. Interestingly, the chlorophyll a derived photoinitiating systems appear as efficient as those observed in the presence of commonly used petro-sourced porphyrins.
