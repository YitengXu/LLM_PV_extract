    , Accepted 6th May 2023First published on 8th May 2023AbstractWe fabricated CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) thin films with and without a ZnO layer and measured the heterodyne transient grating (HD-TG) responses of each film to investigate the charge injection dynamics from MAPbI3 to ZnO, based on the component arising from the recombination of the surface trapped electrons in the ZnO layer with the remaining holes in MAPbI3. In addition, we observed the HD-TG response of the MAPbI3 thin film coated with the ZnO layer in which phenethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI) was inserted between two layers as a passivation layer and confirmed that the charge transfer was enhanced when PEAI existed, based on the increase in the amplitude of the component arising from the recombination and its acceleration.
1. Introduction
Since Miyasaka and his co-workers employed organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite materials as light harvesting sensitizers (CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3),1 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention and various types of PSCs have been developed so far.2–9 Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites exhibit a wide-range light absorption including the visible light region, giving rise to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1,10,11 In order to figure out the main factors influencing the efficiencies of the PSCs, photo-excited charge carrier dynamics, taking place in the PSC devices, have been investigated using various spectroscopic techniques, which could be an aid for the further development of the highly efficient PSCs.12–17 Particularly, the charge transfer kinetics between the perovskite material and electron transport layer (ETL) has been intensively studied by ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopic methods.12,13
The ETL usually included in the PSC device plays very crucial roles in the extraction of the photo-excited electrons from the perovskite material and the retardation of the back electron–hole recombination with an aid of the spatially separated charge carriers between two layers, resulting from the construction of the type-II heterojunction. Generally, metal oxide materials such as TiO2, ZnO and so on have been utilized for this purpose.18–24 Because it has been regarded as one of the most important processes in improving the efficiency of the PSC device, it is very important to monitor the electron transfer between two layers for a better understanding of its mechanism.
There have been attempts to investigate the charge transfer between the perovskite and the ETL layer using ultrafast spectroscopic techniques as mentioned above due to its very high reaction rate (ps–ns).12,13,25 For example, Wang et al. investigated the electron injection dynamics in the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite with the TiO2 ETL layer and revealed the effect of the existence of PbI2 on the charge recombination, taking place at perovskite grain boundaries in the above-mentioned device.12 However, because the charge transfer kinetics has been indirectly investigated in the perovskite layer so far, the understanding of the charge injection is still inadequate. In addition, due to the drawbacks of the femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopic techniques such as the complexities of the setup and the necessities of the expensive equipment, the number of researchers who work on this topic is still not large.
Therefore, in order to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks of the femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, in this study, we fabricated MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/ZnO films as shown in Fig. 1A and B, respectively, and investigated the electron transfer between MAPbI3 and ZnO using a heterodyne transient grating (HD-TG) method, which is one of the time-resolved spectroscopic techniques utilized for the investigation of the photo-excited charge carrier dynamics at the solid/liquid interface,26–31 by monitoring the surface trapped charge carriers in the ZnO layer, originating from MAPbI3. The signal of the HD-TG response could be amplified by mixing a large reference field (0th order) with a weak signal field and the high sensitivity for the observation of the weak signal originating from such as the small number of the surface trapped charge carriers could be achieved by the linearization. With the aid of the above-mentioned advantages of the HD-TG technique, we propose a new approach for studying the charge transfer between the perovskite layer and the ETL by the observation of how many photo-excited electrons arising from the perovskite layer are trapped in the surface state in the ETL using the HD-TG method. In addition, we prepared a MAPbI3/phenethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI)/ZnO film (Fig. 1C) in which PEAI acted as a passivation layer32 and measured HD-TG responses to reveal the acceleration of the charge transfer as a case study.

2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis
The preparation method for the MAPbI3 sample was reported in the previous studies.33–35 Briefly, the MAPbI3 precursor was prepared by dissolving 1 mmol CH3NH3I (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mmol PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 mL DMF (Sigma-Aldrich). The solution was stirred at 100 °C overnight. After the plasma treatment was performed on the glass slide, the precursor was spin-coated on it. Subsequently, toluene was dropped on the substrates followed by the repetition of the spin-coating. The films were annealed at 100 °C for 1 hour.
Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle ink (Sigma-Aldrich) was deposited on the as-prepared MAPbI3 film to fabricate MAPbI3/ZnO films. ZnO nanoparticle ink was spin-coated on the as-prepared MAPbI3 films. The films were calcined at 100 °C for 10 minutes.
2-Phenylethylamine hydroiodide (PEAI, Tokyo Chemical Industry) was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (Tokyo Chemical Industry) at a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 for the fabrication of the MAPbI3/PEAI/ZnO films. PEAI solution was spin-coated on the as-prepared MAPbI3 films. Then, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min, followed by the deposition of ZnO on PEAI. The details of the deposition method for PEAI were reported in a previous study.36
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured using X-ray diffractometers (Rigaku, Miniflex 600) for the characterization of the crystal structures. The morphologies were also examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Carl Zeiss, ULTRA PLUS). UV-Vis absorption spectra were observed, ranging from 300 to 900 nm (Agilent Technologies, Cary 8454 UV-Vis), to investigate the optical properties of the samples.
2.3. Time-resolved measurements
To investigate the responses originating from the photo-generated phenomena in the as-prepared films, a near-field heterodyne transient grating (NF-HD-TG) technique was employed. The principle of the NF-HD-TG method was reported in the previous studies in detail.31,37 Briefly, the second harmonic output of Nd:YAG (YAG) (532 nm, 10 Hz) and CW diode lasers (660 nm) were used as pump and probe lights, respectively. The pump light was passed through a transmission grating and was irradiated on the target film located at a Talbot length, in which the transient grating was generated. The response generated by the refractive index change could be detected by the interference between the signal and reference fields, corresponding to the heterodyne detection. The imaginary part of the refractive index change could be simply removed by varying the distance between the sample and the transmission grating, resulting in the change of the phase difference between the signal and the reference. The response could be detected using a photodiode detector (Thorlabs, PDA36A2) at the position of the 0th order diffraction spot. In addition, bandpass (Thorlabs, FBH660-10, 660 nm, FWHM = 10 nm) and long pass filters (Thorlabs, FELH0600, 600 nm) were installed in front of the detector to remove the scattered pump light and fluorescence originating from the excited target sample. The response was monitored and recorded by an oscilloscope (Tektronix, TDS5054).
3. Results and discussion
Fig. S1A–C in the ESI† shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of MAPbI3, MAPbI3/ZnO and MAPbI3/PEAI. The preparation methods for each film are described in the experimental section. As can be seen in the figures, we were able to confirm that the MAPbI3 films were successfully fabricated38,39 and the diffraction peaks originating from PEAI were found in MAPbI3/PEAI.40–42 However, due to the thinness of the ZnO layer in MAPbI3/ZnO, the diffraction peaks arising from ZnO could not be observed. In order to confirm whether ZnO existed on the surface of the as-prepared films, alternatively, an additional film in which the thickness of ZnO was intentionally increased was prepared as presented in Fig. S1D in the ESI† and the peaks originating from ZnO could be successfully observed in this film,43–45 which implies that ZnO could be well deposited in the MAPbI3/ZnO and MAPbI3/PEAI/ZnO films. In addition, the XRD patterns of MAPbI3 as a function of time were measured to check the degradation rate of MAPbI3 in the films we fabricated in this study as shown in Fig. S1E in the ESI.† Based on the intensities of the peak arising from PbI2,46 resulting from the degradation of MAPbI3, we could confirm that its degradation was negligible within around three days after the sample preparation. In order to further ensure the accuracy of the experiments, in the present study, we conducted the experiments on the day we fabricated the samples and did not re-measure them on which the laser was already irradiated.
In order to investigate the morphologies of the as-prepared films, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were measured and presented in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† As can be seen in the image in Fig. S2A in the ESI,† the typical morphologies of MAPbI3, of which grain sizes were about 200–800 nm, were observed, which is consistent with former studies.9 In addition, as shown in Fig. S2B and C in the ESI,† ZnO nanoparticles deposited on the surface of either MAPbI3 or PEAI were clearly observed.
In order to select the appropriate wavelength of the pump light for the HD-TG measurements, UV-Vis spectra of MAPbI3 and ZnO thin films were observed and presented in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† It is noticeable that MAPbI3 absorbs wide range of light including visible light, while ZnO absorbs only UV light (<400 nm). It means that it is necessary to choose the wavelength of the pump laser within the visible range to selectively excite the MAPbI3 layer. Thus, in this study, the second harmonic output of a Nd:YAG (YAG) laser (532 nm) was employed as presented in the experimental section in the ESI.†
A normalized HD-TG response of the MAPbI3 thin film was observed in toluene, ranging from 10−4 to 1 s, and presented in Fig. 2. As can be seen in the response in the figure, the measured response could be classified into two, a decay from 10−4 to ∼10−3 s and a baseline from ∼10−3 s. In addition, to extract the time constants from the observed response, maximum entropy method (MEM), in which the lifetime distributions including the multiple number of the exponential functions could be extracted based on the maximization of the entropy of the errors between the observed and the fitting results,47,48 was applied to avoid overfitting and the obtained time constant distribution was presented in the inset in Fig. 2. According to the inset in the figure, it was demonstrated that a single component was extracted from the observed response of MAPbI3, shown in Fig. 2. The observed one could be fitted by a single exponential function (τ = 7.5 × 10−4 s) by taking into account the maximum point of the component appearing in the time constant distribution in the MEM analysis.
 Fig. 2  HD-TG response of MAPbI3 in toluene with the grating spacing (Λ) of 60 μm under the pumping energy of 1 mJ, probed by 660 nm light (black), and fitting curve (red). The time constant distribution obtained by the MEM analysis is presented in the inset of the figure. 
In order to reveal the origin of the component found in the observed response of MAPbI3 shown in Fig. 2, HD-TG responses of MAPbI3 were measured in toluene with the grating spacings (Λ) of 30, 60 and 80 μm as shown in Fig. S4A in the ESI.† The time constants of each response were also extracted by the MEM analysis, presented in the inset of Fig. S4A in the ESI† and listed in Table 1A, (30 μm: τ = 5.2 × 10−4 s, 60 μm: τ = 7.5 × 10−4 s, 80 μm: τ = 1.1 × 10−3 s), which were obtained by selecting the maxima of each component appearing in the time constant distributions. It is noticeable that the decays of each observed response could be fitted by the single component which significantly depended on Λ. It means that the components extracted from each response arose from the thermal diffusions at the thin film/solvent interface. It is likely that the time constants increased as the increase in Λ because the decay of the thermal diffusion resulted from the uniform distribution of temperature at the interface. Based on the results, we could conclude that the photo-excited charge carrier dynamics in MAPbI3 such as charge recombination was not observed in the range from 10−4 to 1 s. It implies that the photo-generated charge carrier dynamics in MAPbI3 takes place in much earlier time, consistent with the former studies.34,35

The HD-TG responses of the MAPbI3/ZnO thin film were measured in toluene as presented in Fig. 3. The time constants extracted by the MEM analysis from the response were presented in the inset of Fig. 3. It is noticeable that two distinct time constants were obtained from MAPbI3/ZnO, which was different from MAPbI3. Because the wavelength of the pump light used in this study was 532 nm, we could guarantee that the observed signal solely originated from the excitation of the MAPbI3 layer. In addition, based on the band alignment of MAPbI3/ZnO (Type-II heterojunction)21,22,24 and the high sensitivity of the HD-TG method at the interface,26–31 it is evident that the signal arising from the components in the ZnO layer, transferred from MAPbI3, was monitored.
 Fig. 3  HD-TG response of MAPbI3/ZnO in toluene with the grating spacing (Λ) of 80 μm under the pumping energy of 1 mJ, probed by 660 nm light (black), and fitting curve (red) constructed by two exponential functions (blue and violet). The time constant distributions obtained by the MEM analysis are presented in the inset of the figure. 
In order to figure out the origin of each component extracted from the observed response of MAPbI3/ZnO presented in Fig. 3, HD-TG responses of MAPbI3/ZnO were observed in toluene with Λ of 30, 60 and 80 μm under the pumping energy of 0.9 mJ as shown in Fig. S5A in the ESI.† The time constants extracted by the MEM analysis were presented in the inset of Fig. S5A in the ESI† and listed in Table 1B, (30 μm: τ = 1.6 × 10−4 s and 1.4 × 10−3 s, 60 μm: τ = 1.2 × 10−3 s, 80 μm: τ = 1.2 × 10−3 s and 1.3 × 10−2 s), which were obtained by choosing the maximum points of each component appearing in the time constant distributions. Two distinct time constants were extracted from the responses observed with Λ of 30 and 80 μm, while that with 60 μm could be fitted by a single exponential function. As can be seen in the time constant distributions in the inset of Fig. S5A in the ESI,† one of the time constants significantly depended on Λ (30 μm: τ = 1.6 × 10−4 s, 80 μm: 1.3 × 10−2 s). On the other hand, another was not so significantly influenced by Λ (30 μm: τ = 1.4 × 10−3 s, 80 μm: 1.2 × 10−3 s). This means that one of them could be assigned to the thermal diffusion and the other arose from another process. It is also probable that two components were incidentally overlapped in the response measured with Λ of 60 μm thus they were not distinguished by the MEM analysis.
In order to assign the unknown component in MAPbI3/ZnO, we investigated the dependence of the signal amplitudes of the responses in MAPbI3/ZnO on the pump light intensities as shown in Fig. S6A in the ESI.† The time constants of each response observed by varying the pump light intensity were also extracted using the above-mentioned method, presented in Fig. S6B in the ESI† and listed in Table 1C. In addition, the intensities of the unknown component were obtained by taking into account the amplitudes of the exponential terms, utilized for the generation of the fitting curves, and plotted in Fig. S6C and D in the ESI,† respectively. As can be seen in Fig. S6B in the ESI,† the time constants corresponding to the unknown component strongly depended on the pump light intensities, while those of the thermal diffusion did not. Namely, the decay arising from the unknown component was accelerated when the pump light intensity was increased. In addition, as shown in Fig. S6D in the ESI,† the amplitudes of the unknown component were almost saturated at a pump light intensity higher than 0.9 mJ. Based on the results of the acceleration of the decay and the saturation of the amplitudes, the unknown component could be assigned to the trap-mediated recombination of the charge carriers.29,49 Because the MAPbI3 layer was excited and the band positions of MAPbI3 and ZnO were aligned as the type-II heterojunction, with a high probability, the component observed in this study could be assigned to the recombination arising from the electrons trapped at the surface of ZnO with the remaining holes in the MAPbI3 layer. This means that the amplitude of this component could be utilized for the evaluation of the charge transfer efficiency from the perovskite material to the ETL. If the amplitude of this component is high, it implies that a large number of electrons are transferred from the perovskite material to the ETL, followed by the trapping of the electrons at the surface of the ETL.
In order to confirm whether the above-mentioned approach is indeed applicable, as a case study, we measured HD-TG responses of MAPbI3/PEAI/ZnO in which the passivation layer (PEAI)32 was inserted between MAPbI3 and ZnO. In order to assign each component, the responses were observed under the pump light energy of 0.75 mJ, in which the amount of the electrons could not be saturated in the surface trap states in ZnO as shown in Fig. S6D in the ESI,† by varying Λ and presented in Fig. S7A in the ESI.† The time constant distributions of each response were extracted by the above-mentioned method as shown in the inset of Fig. S7A in the ESI† and the values are listed in Table 1D. (30 μm: τ = 6.0 × 10−4 s, 60 μm: τ = 5.1 × 10−4 s and 1.5 × 10−3 s, 80 μm: τ = 5.0 × 10−4 s and 7.5 × 10−3 s) Because one of the components strongly depended on Λ, while the other did not, which could be assigned to the recombination of the trapped electrons at the surface of ZnO, it is possible for us to employ the immovable component as the indicator for the evaluation of the charge transfer efficiency in MAPbI3/PEAI/ZnO.
In order to investigate the effect of the existence of PEAI between the MAPbI3 and ZnO layers on the charge transfer efficiency, the HD-TG responses of MAPbI3/ZnO and MAPbI3/PEAI/ZnO were measured under the same conditions (pump energy: 0.75 mJ, Λ = 60 μm) and both of them are shown in the same figure (Fig. 4) with the time constant distributions extracted from each response as presented in the inset of Fig. 4 (MAPbI3/ZnO: τ = 5.6 × 10−4 s and 2.5 × 10−3 s, MAPbI3/PEAI/ZnO: τ = 5.1 × 10−4 s and 1.6 × 10−3 s). Based on the amplitudes of each component, obtained from the exponential functions used for constructions of the fitting curves, it was demonstrated that the component originating from the recombination of the surface trapped electrons in ZnO in MAPbI3/PEAI/ZnO was ∼three times larger than that in MAPbI3/ZnO, meaning that the amount of the transferred electrons in the ZnO layer increased by inserting PEAI. In addition, it was noticeable that the recombination was accelerated in MAPbI3/PEAI/ZnO, which could be attributed to the enhancement of the charge mobility with the aid of PEAI.

The time constant distributions obtained by the MEM analysis are presented in the inset of the figure. 
4. Conclusions
We successfully measured the photo-excited charge carrier dynamics in MAPbI3/ZnO and MAPbI3/PEAI/ZnO thin films to investigate the charge transfer between the perovskite material and the ETL, based on the component arising from the recombination of the surface trapped electrons in the ETL with the remaining holes in the perovskite material. With the aid of the high sensitivity of the HD-TG method and the appropriate selection of the wavelength of the pump light (532 nm), we revealed that only the trapped electrons in the ETL, surviving in the range from microseconds to milliseconds, could be selectively monitored using this approach. Furthermore, as a case study, we investigated the photo-excited charge carrier dynamics in MAPbI3 thin films consisting of the ETL (ZnO) and the passivation material (PEAI) and confirmed that the charge transfer could be enhanced by inserting PEAI, based on the increase in the amplitude of the component arising from the recombination and its acceleration. We believe that this study will pave the road for studying the charge transfer efficiency within PSCs.
