    , Accepted 6th May 2017First published on 22nd May 2017AbstractPhotoelectrochemical water splitting holds great potential for solar energy conversion and storage with zero greenhouse gas emission. Integration of a suitable co-catalyst with an absorber material enables the realization of highly efficient photocleavage of water. Herein, nanostructured hematite film was coated with an ultrathin and conformal CoOx overlayer through atomic layer deposition (ALD). The best performing hybrid hematite with a 2–3 nm ALD CoOx overlayer yielded a remarkable turn on potential of 0.6 VRHE for the water oxidation reaction. Moreover, material analyses revealed that the surface amorphous CoOx/Co(OH)2 component exhibited good optical transparency and hydrophilic properties, which were beneficial for the formation of an ideal hematite/electrolyte interface. In addition to the presence of the CoOx overlayer, a negative shift of flat band potential (VFB) as well as suppression of surface recombination helped to significantly promote the charge separation and collection properties, contributing to the overall solar conversion efficiency. As a result, the external quantum efficiency (IPCE) obtained on hematite increases by 66% at 1.23 VRHE.
Introduction
Due to the vast availability of water and sunlight, solar water splitting represents an environmentally benign pathway to convert solar energy into hydrogen gas, which can be readily stored and utilized.1–3 To successfully carry out the complete water splitting reaction using a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, two processes, hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), need to be balanced. When it is carried out in a tandem cell, the water oxidation process at the photoanode material is considered as a bottleneck due to its complex 4-electron/proton reaction mechanism. To date, a number of metal oxide semiconductor photoelectrodes have been investigated due to their low-cost, easy fabrication, and stability in an aqueous solution.4–6 Among these, hematite (α-Fe2O3) is one of the best candidates to serve as an photoelectrode due to its unique ideal band gap (2.0–2.1 eV), non-toxicity, earth abundance, and intrinsic N-type behavior.7,8
Despite promising attributes, hematite still faces the big challenges of low photocurrent and low late turn on potential (Von) for practical applications. These problems arise from its sluggish reaction kinetics, low electrical conductivity, and low visible light absorption coefficient coupled to a short hole diffusion length.9–14 Many nanostructured architectures have been applied to circumvent the mismatch between the short hole diffusion length and long light penetration distance.15–18 Surface modification is another strategy that has been successfully applied to promote the reaction activity on hematite, enhancing its Von behavior.19–22 To date, a great number of surface modification layers, such as CoOx/Co–Pi, RuOx, IrOx, and NiOx/NiOOH, NiFeOx, with robust OER activity and molecular catalysts have been demonstrated to work well when deposited on the hematite surface.10,23–28
However, exploration of the working mechanisms of these well-performing modification layers remains challenging, but is of great importance, especially in terms of distinguishing the contributions from the newly formed interfaces. The presence of a surface modification layer will not only alter the reaction kinetics, but also change the surface energetics, which are closely associated with charge separation and collection capabilities. A number of attempts have been made to clarify the confusion and settle the debates related to this topic. For example, a pronounced enhancement was achieved on Co–phosphate (Co–Pi) hematite by Gamelin et al.29 In subsequent studies, Durrant et al. attributed the improvement to long lifetime holes detected via transient absorption measurements.30 On the other hand, the Bisquert and Hamann groups attributed the promotion effect to the dual functions of Co–Pi.31 Recently, the Gamelin group studied the kinetics of a similar hematite system and revealed that the water oxidation kinetics slow down with Co–Pi, whereas electron–hole recombination slows down to a great extent, resulting in an improvement of the quantum efficiency.23 Another typical example is the NiFeOx-modified hematite reported by Wang et al. They claimed that the improved Von was a result of enlarged photovoltage generation.32 They utilized the intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) to study the NiFeOx/hematite system and found that a decreased surface recombination rate resulted in a better PEC water splitting performance although the charge transfer rate also decreased.21 However, all the modification layers reported in the aforementioned study alter the hematite light absorption property, which is undesirable while constructing a composite photoelectrode with a surface layer.30,33,34 This highlights the importance of exploring a suitable and viable route to integrate a semiconductor material with the modification layer, in which the optical absorption property and photovoltage of the composite photoelectrode will not be affected.
Herein, we used nanoporous hematite film as a prototypical photoanode material and applied the ALD method to couple it with an ultrathin CoOx overlayer deposited at low deposition temperature (150 °C). ALD is particularly suitable for the deposition of a uniform coating material on a high surface architecture with good reproducibility, due to its self-limiting reaction chemistry. The low temperature procedure ensured the retention of a good hematite surface, based on our previous study reporting the CoOx ALD growth on various substrates.35 Different from the previously studied integrated photoanode systems, this novel low-temperature ALD fabrication process leads to unique transparent, hydrophilic, and amorphous features of the CoOx ultrathin layer on the hematite substrate. In detail, structural characterizations confirmed the presence of an amorphous CoOx/Co(OH)2 component on the surface, prepared at low temperature, yielded a very hydrophilic surface, and played a critical role in determining the hematite surface energetics. Moreover, this facile synthetic approach successfully avoids the instance of drying the stress-induced cracking observed on other disordered or amorphous catalysts prepared by electrodeposition or solution methods. As a result, the formed Fe2O3/CoOx composite photoanode, with optimal performance achieved at 25 ALD cycles, provides a uniform and continuous coating with a thickness of 2–3 nm. An early water oxidation Von of 0.6 VRHE can be observed for the composite hematite sample when tested in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, corresponding to a 250 mV cathodic shift as compared to that of the bare hematite sample.
Experimental
Preparation of the hematite film and ALD CoOx overlayer
β-FeOOH nanorods were first deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass by the hydrothermal method, as reported in previous literature.36 Prior to deposition, the FTO substrate was ultrasonically cleaned by acetone, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and DI water for 15 min with each solvent. After drying with N2 gas, the FTO glass was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with 0.15 M iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 99.7%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) and 1 M sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 99.7%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) solution. The solution pH was adjusted to 1.5 using diluted HCl solution. Then, the synthesis reaction was carried out at 100 °C in a baking oven. After carefully rinsing with DI water and drying in air, the yellow β-FeOOH film was converted to reddish hematite film by post annealing at 800 °C under ambient air condition. The total reaction time was fixed at 3 h and thermal treating time was 9 min.
CoOx film was prepared using a commercial ALD (SUNALE™ R200, Picosun) reactor with Cobaltocene (98%, Co(Cp)2, Strem Chemicals) and Ozone (∼11% O3 in volume) as ALD precursors. During the growth process, high purity N2 gas (99.999%) was used as the carrier and purging gas. The stainless-steel bubbler containing Co(Cp)2 was maintained at 100 °C, and the deposition temperature was fixed at 150 °C. The ALD chamber pressure was adjusted to 500 Pa before each growth process. Each ALD sequence consisted of a 5 s pulse of Co(Cp)2 and 5 s pulse of O3, and after each pulse, 8 s N2 purging was performed to remove the excess precursor.
Characterizations of materials
The morphology of the hematite film was characterized by the field scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL-6200) at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. To improve the conductivity of the film, all hematite films were coated via 90 s sputtering of Au. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images were obtained using Tecnai G2F30 (FEI, Holland). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (2θ ranging from 10° to 80°) were obtained using an analytical X'pert PRO diffractometer. All XRD measurements were carried out at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu Kα radiation with λ = 1.5406 Å. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were carried out using a VG Multilab 2000 X-ray photoelectron spectroscope with Al Kα radiation. The XPS fine-scanned data were fitted with the XPSPEAK4.1 software, and the binding energy of C 1s was calibrated to 284.6 eV. The UV-vis absorbance spectra were obtained using a LabRAM HR800 spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as the reference. The contribution from the FTO substrate has been subtracted. The scanning wavelength for the UV-vis spectrum ranged from 350 nm to 750 nm.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
All the PEC tests were carried out via a potentiostat (Metrohm Autolab, PGSTAT302N) using a standard 03-electrode PEC cell, in which the hematite electrode was the working electrode, a Pt foil served as the counter electrode, and a Hg/HgO (1.00 M KOH) electrode (0.098 V vs. NHE, at 25 °C) was used as the reference electrode. The light source was a 350 W xenon lamp (Perfect Light-FX300) with full-spectrum simulated sunlight, and the light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a solar power meter (Perfect Light PL-MW 2000). Unless otherwise stated, all the PEC tests were performed in a 1.00 M KOH solution under constant stirring. All the potentials were converted to potentials vs. RHE (E vs. RHE = E vs. Hg/HgO ref + 0.198 V + 0.059 V × pH). The J–V curves were evaluated by measuring the current via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scanning rate of 10 mV s−1. The IPCE tests were carried out using the CrownTech QTest Station 500AD in the same three-electrode configuration, and the wavelength window was fixed at 350–700 nm. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained under both dark and light conditions, and the frequency applied ranged from 01 MHz to 0.01 Hz with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV. The flat band potentials of the hematite samples were derived according to the Mott–Schottky equation.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a displays the typical top-view SEM image of the hematite film grown on an FTO substrate with 25 cycles of ALD CoOx coating. The facile synthesis method produced well-ordered worm-like porous hematite structures with an average diameter of around 100 nm. The high surface area architecture is beneficial for the photogenerated carrier separation and collection during the water oxidation process. The cross-sectional view SEM image in Fig. 1b shows that the hematite film has a height of 500 nm. Instead of long and regular hematite nanorods, multi-layers of worm-like hematite units tightly stacked on the FTO substrate. From the top-view SEM images obtained for bare hematite in Fig. S1 (ESI†), it was concluded that the morphology of the hematite film was maintained well after ALD CoOx deposition.

The typical HR-TEM images of ALD CoOx-coated hematite are shown in Fig. 1d and e. It can be seen from Fig. 1d that 25 cycles of ALD growth yields a continuous, conformal, and amorphous coating along the hematite surface, and the thickness of the modification layer is between 2 and 3 nm. However, when the thickness of the modification layer increases to 10 nm, CoOx becomes crystalline, which can be observed in Fig. 1e. Moreover, Fig. 1c illustrates the TEM image of the bare hematite surface with a smooth and intact edge. The HR-TEM image of hematite with detailed lattice pitches is shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†), and the lattice planes are measured to be 0.367 nm, 0.272 nm, and 0.252 nm, corresponding to the hematite (012), (104), and (110) planes, respectively.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the hematite film with (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), and (300) peaks labelled with purple triangles, and the rest of the XRD signals are from SnO2 in the FTO substrate. The hematite nanostructure prepared in our study has the (110) XRD peak with highest intensity, leading to a favourable Fermi level position. As reported by Peter et al., higher (110)/(104) peak intensity corresponds to a more negative Fermi level on hematite.37 The CoOx peaks cannot be found in the XRD pattern, which is due to the low loading amount and amorphous nature of the CoOx overlayer. UV-vis spectra were obtained to understand the effect of the CoOx overlayer on the optical light absorption property of hematite. All the hematite films show absorption of light with a cut-off at 610 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.03 eV. It is verified in Fig. 2b that slight change occurs in the UV-vis spectrum with the addition of the CoOx overlayer. This is a huge advantage of the ultrathin film modification because it results in minimal coating material with high transparency on the semiconductor absorber.

Surface-sensitive technique XPS was applied to reveal the chemical composition of the as-prepared ALD CoOx overlayer on hematite. Fig. 2c–e show the raw XPS spectra obtained over the region of Fe, O, and Co, along with a detailed fitting result of the Co 2p3/2 peak. The fine-scanned XPS spectrum of Fe is presented in Fig. 2c, and two main peaks of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 are observed at the binding energies of 723.8 and 710.6 eV, respectively. Moreover, the fine-scanned O 1s XPS is located at the binding energy of 529.6 eV, with details displayed in Fig. 2d. In Fig. 2e, two peaks at the binding energies of 780.8 and 796.3 eV are assigned to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively. Because the binding energies of various cobalt oxide and hydroxide compounds overlapped in the XPS spectra, the composition of the deposited CoOx was qualitatively evaluated herein.38 The broad satellite peak at 786.1 eV indicated that ALD CoOx deposited at 150 °C was rich in Co(II), indicating a mixture of CoO and Co(OH)2. The strong XPS satellite signal is due to the unpaired electrons of the transition metal.39 This ALD Co(II) dominant CoOx film is very different from that observed on the thick ALD CoOx film or film previously grown at high temperature, in which Co3O4 is the main phase.40
As illustrated in Fig. 3a, compared to bare hematite, Fe2O3/CoOx showed a considerably enhanced water oxidation performance under AM 1.5 simulated excitation. At 1.23 VRHE, the LSV photocurrent densities of Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/CoOx samples are 0.25 mA cm−2 and 0.65 mA cm−2, respectively. At the same potential, the quantum efficiency (IPCE) at 350 nm was 15% for Fe2O3/CoOx, whereas for Fe2O3, it reached only 9% (Fig. 3b). Bare hematite had a water oxidation Von of 0.85 VRHE, and a pronounced Von ∼ 0.60 VRHE was obtained for hematite with the ALD CoOx overlayer, which was a significant enhancement achieved after only 25 cycles of the ALD surface coating. The detailed definition and calculation of the onset potentials can be found in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The water splitting stability test was carried out at 1.23 VRHE with 1 Sun illumination. Fig. 4a shows that both the Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/CoOx films show negligible decay during the first 3 h of operation. The small fluctuations seen in the stability curve are due to the formation of gas bubbles at the electrode surface via the water splitting reaction. The J–V curves of the CoOx-modified hematite obtained before and after the long-time stability test overlapped well, and the comparison results are presented in Fig. 4b. Overall, it can be concluded that the ultrathin ALD CoOx-coated hematite film enabled a prolonged water oxidation performance without the introduction of precious metals, which was ideal for large scale application.

The best PEC performance was achieved for the composite hematite film after 25 ALD cycles of CoOx coating (Fig. S4, ESI†). Hematite with ultrathin CoOx deposited at 250 °C shows slightly low water oxidation activity than that with ultrathin CoOx deposited at 150 °C, and the result is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). We believe that growth at low temperature is the key to the formation of an ideal interface with favourable features for the water oxidation reaction. First, a relatively mild environment is created during the low temperature ALD growth, which can avoid the substrate damage by highly oxidative ozone species during the ALD growth. Second, the existence of surface Co(OH)2 is a unique feature of the amorphous CoOx overlayer prepared at low temperature. Fitting of O 1s XPS data confirms the presence of hydrated Co(OH)2 species, with a strong peak corresponding to the surface hydrated O at the binding energy of 531.2 eV (Fig. S6, ESI†).41 Recently, Ian D. Shap and co-authors reported similar biphasic Co(OH)2/Co3O4 thin films on a Si photoanode prepared via a plasma-enhanced ALD method. They observed disordered, labile, and ion-impermeable Co(OH)2 on top of a compact nanocrystalline Co3O4 spinel layer.42 The Hamann and Martinson group also observed a mixture of Co(OH)2 and Co3O4 film prepared via ALD through the analysis of the XPS data.39
In Fig. S7 (ESI†), LSV photocurrent curves are shown when incident light is suddenly switched on and off. Both appreciable positive and negative spikes appear at low applied potential region, indicating a relatively severe transient phenomenon. These non-Faradic currents correspond to fast carrier injection and back flow processes.43 Compared to a bare sample, the Fe2O3/CoOx composite photoanode shows even larger spikes. It is reasonable to suspect that the loose and hydrated Co(OH)2 surface layer has the capability to trap photogenerated holes, thus providing an extra driving force for charge separation behavior. Similar conclusions have been drawn for a hydrated NiOOH and FeOOH surface layer in an integrated water splitting system.44,45 However, in the high applied potential region, the external bias causes greater band bending at the hematite/water interface, thus accelerating charge separation, and the abovementioned transient features are accordingly weakened. Furthermore, the LSV scans were carried out in both positive and negative directions for the Fe2O3/CoOx composite sample, and the results are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The small discrepancy between two traces confirms that the notable Von character is not a result of surface species oxidation or other side reactions. Since during the negative direction scan, high-applied potential region had a fully oxidized hematite surface, the redox-potential was already accurate and a well-established photoelectrode surface was obtained.
To gain insight into the working mechanism of the CoOx overlayer, flat band potential (VFB) derived from the Mott–Schottky plot helped to estimate the rough Fermi level position of hematite in contact with the testing electrolyte. Moreover, a VFB of 0.40 VRHE was measured for CoOx-coated hematite, with a negative shift of 120 mV as compared to that of bare hematite (Fig. 5). Detailed VFB and carrier concentrations results are summarized in Table 1. The non-ideal hematite/electrolyte interface and accompanying surface recombination have been widely discussed in literature.32,46 Moreover, most studies attribute these to the incomplete band edge pinning and/or partial Fermi level pinning on hematite. Thereby, the hematite band is less bent and photogenerated carriers are easily trapped at the surface. In the case of the CoOx overlayer, we speculate that the shift in the Fermi level is a result of fixing of the aforementioned problems via CoOx. Contact angle measurements using a DI water drop provide further information about the wetting characteristics of hematite before and after ALD CoOx modification. Results in Fig. 6 show that bare hematite has a relatively hydrophobic surface with a contact angle of 117°, which is detrimental to the formation of an ideal semiconductor and aqueous electrolyte interface. In contrast, when the CoOx overlayer was deposited via ALD, the contact angle dramatically decreased to 45°, resulting in a much more hydrophilic surface for the water splitting reaction.

Further evidence was obtained from the open circuit potential (OCP) measurements. With a zero net charge flow, OCP tests quantitatively probe surface equilibrium potentials under both dark and light conditions.33 In the ideal case, the dark OCP value of hematite lies at the same level as the water oxidation potential and an OCP of 1.23 VRHE is expected. The light OCP value refers to the quasi-Fermi level of holes, reflecting the Fermi level position of the hematite film under pseudo-equilibrium conditions. In this context, as shown in Fig. 7a, dark OCP of bare hematite was measured at 0.92 VRHE, referring to a band bending less significant than the ideal case. Owing to the existence of surface states, a non-negligible potential drop of 300 mV occurs for the Helmholtz layer. We can see, in the same figure, that the CoOx coating enables a positive shift of dark OCP potential by 120 mV, which is strong evidence of Fermi level pinning suppression. The light OCP values for the bare and composite hematite photoanodes are 0.52 VRHE and 0.55 VRHE, respectively, consistent with the trend of VFB derived from the Mott–Schottky analysis. Therefore, the key differences between the OCP results obtained under the dark condition for the bare Fe2O3 and those obtained for the Fe2O3/CoOx samples are a result of higher photovoltage generation and more desirable surface energetics for the water oxidation reaction with the CoOx overlayer.

Blue squares and pink squares are OCP data obtained under dark and light conditions, respectively. The grey error bars were calculated from OCP values obtained for at least three different samples for each data point. (b) Nyquist plot measured at an applied potential of 1.23 VRHE under 1 Sun illumination for bare Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/CoOx samples. 
Besides Fermi level pinning suppression and greater photovoltage generation discussed above, the reduction in the kinetic overpotential can also influence the PEC water splitting performance, as observed via the J–V analysis. To validate that CoOx with high OER activity will have a positive effect on the reaction kinetics, the EIS technique was employed to explore the kinetics information of the integrated hematite photoanode. The semicircle in the complex plane impedance data measured under light conditions roughly refers to the charge transfer resistance in the testing cell. The results in Fig. 7b agree well with our expectation that Fe2O3/CoOx has a slightly smaller impedance than bare Fe2O3 at 1.23 VRHE. The dependence of the OER activity on the CoOx growth amount is illustrated in Fig. S9a (ESI†), and CoOx fabricated via ALD enhances the electrochemical activity of hematite under the dark condition. In Fig. S9b (ESI†), the EIS data obtained on Fe2O3/CoOx under dark conditions shows a smaller impedance value than that obtained on the bare hematite. While the abovementioned two sets of measurements indicate that 250 ALD cycles of CoOx coating provide the best reaction kinetics, the modified hematite with best PEC water oxidation property was achieved after 25 ALD cycles of CoOx coating, taking into account a balance between reaction barrier reduction and surface energetics promotion. In our case, charge transfer rate does not greatly increase with the application of the overlayer since the suppression of surface recombination and improvement in surface energetics has already lead to higher photovoltage, thus pronouncing the overall water splitting efficiency.
Based on all the abovementioned discussion, the CoOx overlayer prepared via the low temperature ALD method plays multiple roles in enhancing the water oxidation activity when interfaced with a hematite photoanode, as shown in Scheme 1. The amorphous CoOx overlayer tends to be hydrated, and the Fe2O3/CoOx composite material exhibits a more hydrophilic surface to an aqueous electrolyte than the bare hematite sample. As a result, its surface energetic properties are more ideal as it exhibits a negative shift of flat band potential and a greater photovoltage. Moreover, the high OER activity of the CoOx overlayer promotes the surface reaction kinetics as well.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully fabricated conformal and ultrathin amorphous CoOxvia low temperature ALD with high water splitting activity and compatibility on a nanostructured hematite film. This low-temperature deposited amorphous CoOx film shows hydrophilic properties, excellent long term stability, as well as ideal optical transparency while functioning as the surface modification layer. The resulting composite hematite sample shows an early photocurrent onset potential of 0.6 VRHE, with a significant 250 mV enhancement compared to the bare hematite electrode. This Von represents one of the pronounced values achieved using co-based catalyst deposited by ALD. Our study provides a facile method to integrate nanostructured hematite with an ideal ultrathin modification layer, as well as a detailed understanding of the working mechanism of the surface modification layer.
