    , Accepted 28th January 2011First published on 21st February 2011AbstractWe report on a high-performance photoelectrode consisting of a nanocrystalline TiO2 film co-sensitized with CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) and CdS layers. In this photoelectrode, solvothermally synthesized CuInS2 QDs, monodispersed at sizes of 3.5 and 4.3 nm, are attached to a TiO2 substrate by means of a bifunctional linker, before it is coated with an in situ growth of CdS followed by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction. The QDs has a high-level conduction band for the efficient injection of electrons into TiO2. The CdS coating provides high surface coverage to prevent interfacial recombination and releases the quantum confinement of the QDs, resulting in band gap reduction from 2.10–1.80 eV and 1.94–1.76 eV for the 3.5 and 4.3 nm QDs, respectively. With AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, this heterostructural electrode exhibits a saturated photocurrent as high as 16 mA cm−2 in a polysulfide solution. Systematic analysis suggests that the photocurrent resulting from the CuInS2 QDs is increased by more than 100%, thanks to the CdS coating. This coating extends the absorption spectra of the QDs and facilitates charge separation by scavenging photogenerated holes in the valence band of the QDs.
Introduction
Due to global warming and shortages of crude oil in recent years, the development of environmentally friendly alternative energy sources has become an important issue.1–5 Photovoltaic and photosynthetic devices are one of the most promising technologies to satisfy the demand for clean energy and ultimately replace fossil fuels. Since the discovery by Honda and Fujishima in 1972,6 that titanium dioxide (TiO2) photoelectrodes were capable of splitting water through photosynthesis, researchers around the world have been focused on the conversion of solar light into electricity and chemical energy, using TiO2 electrodes. The photo-conversion process involves the absorption of solar photons by a semiconductor to induce the separation of electrons and holes in the energy bands of the semiconductor. TiO2 has a large band gap and absorbs solar light only in the ultraviolet region, which comprises approximately 5% of the solar spectrum. It has been possible to extend the spectral response into the region of visible light through surface sensitization. Ternary chalcopyrite CuME2 (M = Ga, In; E = S, Se, Te) and II–VI-type semiconductor (such as CdSe, CdS, and PbS) quantum dots (QDs) show promise in sensitizing applications owing to their high absorption coefficient and tunable band gap, well matched to the solar spectrum.7–15 Developing a strategy to augment the spectral absorption range and enhance the separation of photogenerated charges could greatly improve the photo-conversion performance and versatility of QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes.
TiO2 is a semiconductor extensively used in the field of photovoltaic or photosynthetic conversion due to its high stability, the suitable positions of its energy band, wide availability, and low cost.16,17 CdS or CdSe enhanced TiO2 nanostructures, produced through a chemical deposition process of successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), have attracted the most attention over the past two decades due to their simplicity of in situ assembly into a TiO2 film and the high surface coverage.7,8,18–21 Although the deposition of narrow band-gap QDs via the SILAR process is simple, difficulty in controlling the size of QDs has limited the feasibility of tuning the optical absorption spectrum by varying the size.22–24 In addition, the near-bulk characteristic of the devices reduces the probability of multiple exciton generation with phonon emission.25
In a previous study we succeeded in synthesizing high-quality CuInS2 QDs using a solvothermal route and depositing the QDs onto nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes with a bifunctional surface linker for the assembly of photoelectrochemical cells.14 The CuInS2 QD particles had a well-defined size and exhibited a pronounced quantum confinement effect in the electronic energy band structures, enabling the tuning of the optical absorption by varying the size of the particles. Furthermore, a widening of the band-gap due to quantum confinement enhanced the injection of photogenerated electrons into TiO2, due to the fact that the upward shift in the edge of the conduction band is significantly greater than the downward shift of the valence band edge for quantized semiconducting QDs.26,27 However, the inevitable defects contained in the ternary chalcopyrite QDs may have caused significant internal recombination of photogenerated charges.28 With recent advances in employing a co-sensitized layer to retard charge recombination, Mora-Seró et al. combined QDs and complex ruthenium dyes to augment the spectral absorption and rapidly scavenge the photogenerated holes in QDs through charge transfer.29,30 The latter action reduces the probability of photoexcited electrons relaxing back to the valence band, thereby enhancing the yield of electrons injected into the TiO2 substrate. Similarly, a coating shell of inorganic material outside the QDs can be used to promote the performance of QDs-sensitized photoelectrodes. Previous studies have reported that coating CdSe QDs with ZnS resulted in a doubling of the quantum yield,31,32 due to surface state passivation.
The present study demonstrates the first example of a TiO2 photoelectrode co-sensitized with ternary chalcopyrite (CuInS2) QDs with II–VI-compound (CdS) SILAR coating. Fig. 1 is a conceptual schematic of the nano-architecture designed for this photoelectrode. We first introduced presynthesized CuInS2 QDs on a nanocrystalline TiO2 film using a bifuctional surface linker, whereupon we deposited a CdS shell layer via the SILAR process. Due to the pronounced quantum confinement effect in the CuInS2 QDs, a higher conduction band edge drives the energetics of CuInS2 to more favorable levels for electron injection from photoexcited CuInS2 QDs into TiO2. On the other hand, the CdS coating promotes charge separation in CuInS2 QDs by scavenging photogenerated holes as well as extending the absorption spectra of the QDs through confinement remission. In addition, the CdS deposition amply covers the surface of the TiO2 exposed to the electrolyte, thereby hindering electron recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. This heterostructural composite has a significant synergistic effect on the photoelectrochemical response in a polysulfide solution. A detailed characterization regarding the photoactivity of this co-sensitized photoelectrode is discussed in this article.

Experimental
Materials
Copper(I) chloride (CuCl, 99.995%), indium(III) chloride (InCl3, 99.999%), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 99+%), sodium sulfide (Na2S, 98+%), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (97+%), titanium chloride (TiCl4, 98+%) and oleylamine (OA, 70%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Cadmium nitrate (99+%) and sulfur (99.999%) were obtained from Acros (USA). TiO2 powder (P25, a mixed phase of 70% anatase and 30% rutile; average size 30 nm) from Degussa (Japan) was used to prepare TiO2 anatase nanoparticles for photoelectrodes. Polyethylene glycol (PEG; 20000 in molecular weight) and ethyl cellulose from Fluka (Germany) were used to suspend TiO2 particles in viscous solutions. Sodium sulfite (Na2SO3, 97+%) was supplied by Showa (Japan). Hexane (99.9%) and methanol (99.9%) were purchased from Tedia (USA), and ethanol (99.5%) was obtained from Merck (Germany). All the materials were used directly without further purification.
Preparation of colloidal CuInS2 QDs
Solvothermal synthesis was used to synthesize CuInS2 QDs. CuCl (0.99 mg, 0.01 mmol) and InCl3 (2.2 mg, 0.01 mmol) were first dissolved in OA (0.198 mL) at room temperature. The resulting mixture was heated to 120 °C and maintained for 1 h with vigorous magnetic stirring to form a clear mixture. This mixture was added, with magnetic stirring, to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (200 mL in capacity) containing 30 mL of hexane. A sulfur solution (1 mmol dissolved in 1 mL OA) was then quickly injected into the above mixture. Solvothermal synthesis of CuInS2 QDs was carried out in a sealed autoclave for 1 h at a temperature of 110 or 150 °C. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature the products were washed, centrifuged with an ethanol–methanol (1/2, v/v) solution. The resultant OA-capped QDs were dispersed in hexane for characteristic analysis without any size-selective precipitation. Our previous study has identified the atomic composition of the QDs.14 The atomic composition ratio of Cu, In, and S varied little for the CuInS2 QDs, with an average composition ratio of 1.1:1.0:2.1, with a standard deviation of 0.2 for each value. This ratio indicates the presence of intrinsic defects in the QD specimens.
For the subsequent self-assembly of CuInS2 QDs on the TiO2 substrate, the OA ligands on the QDs were exchanged with MPA. In the exchange with MPA, dried OA-capped CuInS2 QDs were dispersed in a methanol solution of MPA (60 mM) and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (70 mM),33 and the mixture was then sonicated for 30 min to obtain a clear dispersion containing MPA-capped CuInS2 QDs. The MPA-capped QDs precipitated with an addition of ethyl acetate–hexane (12/50, v/v) solution and were redispersed in methanol.
Preparation of CuInS2 QDs/CdS co-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes
Phase-pure anatase TiO2 was employed to construct transparent TiO2 photoelectrodes. Colloidal TiO2 solution was obtained by treating P25 powder with concentrated NaOH in an autoclave at 130 °C and subsequently treating the resulting titanate product in HNO3 (pH = 1.5) in the autoclave at 240 °C.34 PEG was then added to the colloidal TiO2 at a PEG/TiO2 ratio of 0.4 to form a viscous TiO2 suspension. The suspension was spread on a conducting glass substrate (SnO2:F coated glass; Hartford Glass TEC7, USA) with an active area of 0.4 × 0.4 cm2. The TiO2-coated substrate was subsequently calcined at 450 °C in air for 30 min. Repeated spreading of TiO2 suspension and calcination were carried out to construct 11 μm-thick transparent TiO2 film. A 4 μm-thick light-scattering layer was spread on the top of the transparent layer by spin-coating a viscous suspension of P25 and 400 nm-TiO2 with a ratio of 1.3:1,35 followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. This TiO2 film was used as the electrode substrate for QD sensitization.
To attach linker molecules to the TiO2 surface, the TiO2 electrodes were heated to ∼110 °C and immersed in an acetonitrile solution of MPA (1 M) and sulfuric acid (0.1 M) for 12 h.36 The MPA-coated TiO2 films were subsequently immersed in the MPA-capped QD/methanol solution for 24 h to entrap the QD sensitizer. For further SILAR deposition of CdS, the CuInS2 QDs-coated TiO2 film was successively dipped into 0.05 M Cd(NO3)2/ethanol, rinsing ethanol, 0.05 M Na2S/methanol, and rinsing methanol solution. The dipping time in the Cd2+ and S2− solution was 30 s for each. The SILAR cycle was repeated 5, 8, 11, or 14 times.
Measurements
Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were obtained using a Jeol JSM-6700F (Japan) at a magnification of 150000× and a beam potential of 10 kV. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-4100 (Japan) spectrophotometer. Photoelectrochemical reactions of the sensitized TiO2 electrodes were carried out in a two-armed cell equipped with a quartz window, using a platinum sheet as the counter electrode. An aqueous solution of Na2S (0.24 M) and Na2SO3 (0.35 M) served as the sacrificial reagents to maintain the stability of the CuInS2 QDs and CdS. Photocurrent–potential characteristics were recorded under illumination with a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel class A, SP91160A, USA) at 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) using an electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments 614B, USA). All the measurements were conducted under ambient conditions. The sensitizers, CuInS2 QDs, CdS, or CuInS2 QDs/CdS, remained fairly stable in the electrolyte solution after a long period of measurements under illumination.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the sensitized electrodes
In the present study, we attached 3.5 and 4.3 nm CuInS2 QDs to nanocrystalline TiO2 films using a bifunctional surface modifier, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA).14 A process SILAR deposition of CdS was conducted to enhance the effects of sensitization. Due to the small pore size of TiO2 film and the presence of CuInS2 QDs, the deposition of CdS has to be well monitored to avoid clogging the pores due to excessive growth of CdS crystals. We conducted the SILAR process with a low concentration of Cd2+ and S2− (0.05 M) to maintain relatively slow CdS growth and assure a homogeneous deposition of CdS onto the surface of the electrode.

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the bare TiO2 film and those covered with 3.5 nm CuInS2 QDs and CuInS2 QDs/CdS. The bare TiO2 film (Fig. 2(a)) is a uniform network of TiO2 nanoparticles with an average size of ∼20 nm. After being coated with CuInS2 QDs, the size of the constituting nanoparticles increases to ∼25 nm (Fig. 2(b)), indicating a successful self-assembly of CuInS2 QDs on the surface of the TiO2via the bifunctional MPA molecule. With SILAR deposition (11 cycles) of CdS on the CuInS2-coated TiO2 film, the size of the constituent particles further increases to ∼29 nm (Fig. 2(c)) with a corresponding reduction in the interstitial space. Fig. 3 shows the change in color of the TiO2 photoelectrodes after sensitization. The TiO2 film was originally transparent (Fig. 3(a)), becoming pale orange or yellowish when it was coated with CuInS2 QDs (3.5 nm) and CdS (11 SILAR cycles), respectively (Fig. 3(b) and (c)). This indicates that the CuInS2 QDs have a smaller band gap, and thus a longer wavelength for the absorption edge, than the CdS. When the CuInS2-coated TiO2 was further coated with CdS (Fig. 3(d)), the photoelectrode became reddish-brown, indicating a red shift of the absorption edge relative to that of the CuInS2 QDs. This change in the optical properties of the CuInS2 QD sensitizer is explored further with absorption spectroscopy.

Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the absorption spectra of the CuInS2-sensitized TiO2 electrodes coated with CdS, with various numbers of SILAR cycles. The absorption edges were approximately 590 and 640 nm for the electrodes coated with 3.5 and 4.3 nm CuInS2 QDs, respectively. These results are similar to those for QDs dispersed in hexane.14 The distinct blue-shift in the absorption spectra of the CuInS2 QDs relative to that of bulk CuInS2 (with an edge at ca. 830 nm) and variation in the edge with particle size indicates that the size of the CuInS2 synthesized in this study is in the quantum confinement region. For the electrodes coated with both 3.5 and 4.3 nm CuInS2 QDs, the absorption spectra were progressively red-shifted with an increase in the number of cycles of CdS deposition from 5–14. Because CuInS2 is a direct transition semiconductor, the direct gap transition energy of each photoelectrode is determined by plotting (aE)2 against photon energy (E), where a is absorbance. Fig. 5 shows that gap transition energy varied from 2.10–1.80 eV (i.e. 590–690 nm) and 1.94–1.76 eV (i.e. 640–700 nm) with an increase in the uptake of CdS for electrodes coated with 3.5 and 4.3 nm CuInS2 QDs, respectively. Fig. 4(c) shows the absorption spectra of the CdS-sensitized TiO2 electrodes from 11 SILAR cycles. The absorption edge of CdS is 520 nm, corresponding to a band gap energy of 2.4 eV. Therefore, the red-shift resulting from CdS deposition on QDs-sensitized electrodes (Fig. 4(a) and (b)) is not due to the light absorption of CdS but to that of CuInS2 QDs. We ascribe the enhanced absorption in the longer wavelength region to the remission of quantum confinement effect on the CuInS2 QDs.29

The thickness of each nanocrystalline TiO2 film is 15 μm. The number in parentheses represents the cycle number of CdS SILAR coating. 
Enclosing QDs in a layer of a different materials for the fabrication of a core-shell heterostructure is a common approach to improving QD optical properties via a reduction in the surface state.37–41 The CdS coating is supposed to form a layered shell on the core of the CuInS2 (Fig. 1). The conduction and valence band edge levels of the CuInS2 QDs and CdS shell are close. The red-shift of the absorption edge of the QDs may infer with the tunneling of the QD electron wave function into the surrounding CdS shell, thereby reducing the confinement energy and causing a shift in the absorption spectra to longer wavelengths.29 Due to the wave function overlap, the probability of charge carrier delocalization increases and the charge carriers are no longer confined to a region as small as those in an isolated CuInS2 QD. A previous study showed that the interaction between the wave functions of the core and shell materials increases with an increase in shell thickness.42 The progressive red-shift in the absorption spectra of the CuInS2 QDs-coated TiO2 electrodes with an increase in the number of CdS SILAR cycles supports the remission mechanism for the QDs. A red-shift in the absorption edge of approximately 100 and 60 nm was reached for the 3.5 and 4.3 nm QDs, respectively. This is logical, because the degree of confinement remission should be more pronounced for the more highly confined QD specimen (i.e. the 3.5 nm one).
Photoelectrochemical performance of the sensitized electrodes
The sensitized TiO2 electrodes were used as photoanodes in the proposed photoelectrochemical system for water reduction in a sulfide/sulfite (S2−/SO32−) electrolyte under simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). The possible mechanisms for the reactions taking place on the cathode and photoanode can be summarized as follows.43–45 6 H2O + 6 e− → 6 OH− + 3 H2(R1) 3 SO32− + 2 S2− + H2O + 6 h+ → SO42− + 2 S2O32− + 2 H+(R2)

Fig. 6 shows the curves of the photocurrent density vs. bias potential (I–V characteristics) for the sensitized TiO2 under illumination, starting at a voltage slightly negative to the illuminated open circuit voltage of the photoelectrodes. The current density in darkness was negligible. Fig. 6 shows that the saturated photocurrent of the 3.5 nm CuInS2 sensitized TiO2 was slightly stronger than that of the 4.3 nm CuInS2 sensitized TiO2 (3.6 vs. 3.1 mA cm−2). The difference in photocurrent may have been the result of the higher conduction band edge of the 3.5 nm QDs. Fig. 6(a) shows the photocurrent of the CdS-sensitized TiO2 electrodes of 11 SILAR cycles, with a saturated value of 7.7 mA cm−2. The photocurrent data is in good agreement with the previous studies,28,29 in which it was reported that in situ growth of a sensitizer by SILAR can produce a close-packed layer on TiO2, whereas using a bifunctional linker to attach presynthesized colloidal QDs provides low surface coverage. The weaker optical absorption of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs electrodes (Fig. 4) relative to that of the CdS-sensitized electrodes indicates a sparser surface coverage through attachment of the QDs by a linker.
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent density versus bias potential (I–V characteristics) of the TiO2 nanocrystalline films with varying sensitization levels under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination: (a) the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS electrodes with 3.5 nm QDs and varying SILAR cycles of CdS; (b) the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS electrodes with 4.3 nm QDs and varying SILAR cycles of CdS. The photocurrent of the CdS-sensitized TiO2 electrode with 11 SILAR cycles is also shown in panel (a). The film thickness of the photoanodes was 15 μm, a Pt sheet was the counter electrode, and an aqueous sulfide/sulfite was the electrolyte. 
A high degree of coverage on the surface of the TiO2 substantially hinders electron recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, thereby improving photoelectrochemical performance.46–49 To further explore the surface coverage of TiO2, we subjected the CuInS2 QDs- and CdS-sensitized electrodes to open–circuit voltage (Voc) decay measurements, in which the electrodes were illuminated with a steady voltage of 100 mW cm−2 before the illumination was interrupted.50Fig. 7 shows the variation of normalized Voc with time after the interruption of illumination. The much more severe decay of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs electrode is explained by the low degree of coverage on the surface of the TiO2 film. This also led to a less negative Voc for CuInS2 sensitization (−0.49 V) relative to the Voc for CdS sensitization (−0.65 V). The data in Fig. 6 and 7 indicate that the in situ growth of CdS by SILAR provides close coating on the TiO2 surface.
 Fig. 7  The trend of open-circuit voltage (Voc) decay with time for the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS photoelectrodes after illumination interruption. The film thickness of the photoanodes was 15 μm, a Pt sheet was the counter electrode, and an aqueous sulfide/sulfite was the electrolyte. The cells were illuminated at 100 mW cm−2 before measuring the open-circuit voltage decay in the dark. 

Fig. 6 shows the I–V characteristics of the CuInS2 QDs-sensitized TiO2 electrodes coated with CdS via SILAR, showing that coating CdS on the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs electrodes enormously enhanced photocurrent. Nonetheless, the 3.5 nm CuInS2 QDs were more effective in sensitization than the 4.3 QDs when these electrodes were coated with CdS. This elucidates the fact that the CuInS2 QDs governed the photoelectrochemical performance of the electrodes under solar illumination. Fig. 4 shows that the remission of quantum confinement on CuInS2 by CdS coating extends the absorption spectra of CuInS2 QDs to longer wavelengths. This remission may have enhanced the photoelectrochemical performance of the CuInS2 QD sensitizer. For both the 3.5 and 4.3 nm CuInS2-sensitized TiO2 electrodes, a CdS deposition of 11 SILAR cycles gave the maximum photocurrent, although Fig. 4(a) and (b) show that the red-shift of the absorption spectra continued with an increase in the number of cycles of CdS deposition. A trade-off between light absorption enhancement and conduction band lowering for CuInS2 QDs must be accommodated, to optimize the CdS SILAR coating process. In addition to quantum confinement remission, the high-coverage characteristics of the CdS layer must have augmented the photon energy absorption and conversion for the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs electrodes as well as hindered electron recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The hindrance of electron recombination is supported by the Voc decay analysis in the dark (Fig. 7), showing that coating CdS significantly alleviated the voltage decay of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs electrode. This was accompanied by an increase in Voc under illumination from 0.49 to 0.57 V (Fig. 6).
Working principle of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS heterostructure
The I–V characteristics in Fig. 6 have demonstrated the significant influence of CdS coating on the enhancement of photocurrent. The saturated photocurrent of the co-sensitized TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS electrodes was greater than the sum of the photocurrents of the single-sensitizer electrodes (that is, the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs and TiO2/CdS electrodes), particularly for sensitization with 3.5 nm QDs. Mechanistic or structural changes promoting the injection of photogenerated electrons into TiO2 must be created to compensate for the CdS coating. To gain a better perspective on the energy related characteristics of the electrode heterostructure, Fig. 8 shows a schematic energy diagram to elucidate the probable charge transfer mechanisms involved in the irradiated electrodes. The conduction band edge to the vacuum for bulk TiO2, CuInS2, and CdS are approximately 4.0, 3.7, and 3.6 eV, respectively,11,51 and band gaps are shown in Fig. 8. Because the effective mass of the hole (mh = 1.3 m0, where m0 is the electron mass) is significantly greater than that of electrons (me = 0.16 m0) in CuInS2, the upward shift in the conduction band edge would be predominantly responsible for the enlargement of the band gap in the quantum confined CuInS2 QDs.26,27 Therefore, based on the band gaps shown in Fig. 5, the conduction band edge to the vacuum is approximately 3.1 and 3.3 eV for the 3.5 and 4.3 nm CuInS2 QDs, respectively (Fig. 8). The energy difference between the conduction band edges of a sensitizer and TiO2 is the driving force for the injection of photogenerated electrons from the sensitizer into TiO2. Assuming that the difference between the conduction band energies of the donor and acceptor is the exclusive factor governing the electron transfer rate, a previous study calculated electron transfer rate constants by comparing the bleaching recovery lifetime of quantized CdSe with and without linking it to TiO2 nanoparticles.26 Based on the same calculations and the difference in band energy levels (see the ESI†), the CuInS2 QDs–TiO2 heterojunction system has transfer rate constants of 1.2 × 1010 and 3.0 × 109 s−1 with the 3.5 and 4.3 nm QDs, respectively. This explains why the 3.5 nm CuInS2-sensitized TiO2 exhibited a higher saturated photocurrent than the 4.3 nm CuInS2-sensitized TiO2, even though the absorption spectrum of the former is narrower.
 Fig. 8  Schematic showing the band energy levels and the synergistic effect of a nanocrystalline TiO2 film co-sensitized with CuInS2 QDs and CdS. Processes 1–3 show a sequence of the injection of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of CuInS2 QDs, the scavenge of holes in the valence band of CuInS2 QDs by the electrons in the CdS coating, and the extraction of the photogenerated holes in the CdS by a reaction with sulfide/sulfite species in the electrolyte solution. 
The CdS-sensitized photoelectrodes, exhibited stronger photocurrents than the CuInS2-sensitized electrodes. Photocurrent as high as 7.7 mA cm−2 was obtained (Fig. 6(a)), which was considered high compared to the data reported for similar TiO2/CdS systems.7,52,53 Recent reports have demonstrated that carrying out SILAR processes with precursors of low concentration in an alcoholic medium could produce superior QD sensitizers within nanoporous TiO2 films and lead to improved photovoltaic performances.20,54–56 However, in the present study the CdS produced after 11 cycles of SILAR deposition should have a size beyond the quantum confinement region because the absorption edge of the deposited CdS was close to that of bulk CdS (520 nm). Fig. 8 shows that the difference in conduction band edge between CdS and TiO2 is only 0.4 eV, providing a driving force-dependent electron transfer constant of 5 × 107 s−1. The greater saturated photocurrent of the CdS-coated TiO2 relative to that of the CuInS2 QDs-coated TiO2 can be attributed to a larger amount of CdS deposition and a high number of defect states inevitably contained in the ternary chalcopyrite CuInS2 QDs. We have shown high CdS coverage on TiO2 with strong absorption spectra and minor Voc decay in the dark (Fig. 4(c) and Fig. 7). On the other hand, using a bifunctional linker, MPA, resulted in a substantial steric hindrance for CuInS2 QDs binding and thus a low surface coverage. Nevertheless, the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs electrodes still exhibited appreciable photocurrents, very likely due to the large driving force of electron injection from the CuInS2 QDs to TiO2. With an appropriate amount of CdS coating on CuInS2 QDs, the photoelectrochemical performance of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs electrodes was significantly enhanced.
Using the 3.5 nm CuInS2-coated electrodes as an example, Fig. 6(a) shows that CdS coating increased the saturated photocurrent contributed by CuInS2 from 3.6 mA cm−2 to as high as 7.8 mA cm−2. This gain is calculated by subtracting the CdS contribution (7.7 mA cm−2) from the saturated photocurrent of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS (16 mA cm−2). The enhancement of photocurrent exceeded 100%. The CdS coating may have passivated the surface state to enhance electron injection efficiency, due to an enhancement of the recombination rate in the surface region.57–59 To examine this possibility, we also conducted ZnS coating, which has been reported to effectively passivate the surface state of QDs.19,28,29,31,32 However, only slight photocurrent enhancement was observed as a result of ZnS coating on the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs electrodes (see the ESI†). Therefore, we have to rule out the possibility that surface passivation by CdS coating would significantly enhance the electron injection from CuInS2 QDs to TiO2. Remission of quantum confinement by CdS coating to extend the absorption spectrum of CuInS2 QDs may have contributed to the enhancement of the photocurrent for the TiO2/CuInS2 electrodes. However, the degree to which the absorption spectrum widened (Fig. 4(a)) cannot explain such a large increase (>100%) in photocurrent. Note that the photocurrent of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs electrodes increased progressively with the CdS SILAR cycle, and the resulting CdS shell from 11 SILAR cycles may have insulated the CuInS2 QDs from contacting the electrolyte. The CdS shell is supposed to inhibit the transfer of photogenerated holes into the electrolyte solution, based on the relative levels of the valence bands shown in Fig. 8. A mechanism must exist by which the heterostructure of the electrode to account for the rapid scavenging of holes in the CuInS2 valence band to facilitate the efficient transfer of conduction band electrons into TiO2.

Fig. 8 provides a schematic illustrating the mechanism that explains the remarkable synergistic effect of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS heterostructural system. Process 1 represents an inter-conduction band transfer of photogenerated electrons from CuInS2 QDs into TiO2. Due to the high concentration of hole scavengers, S2−/SO32−, in the solution, the photogenerated holes in the CdS shell can be effectively extracted through process 3, leaving behind the electrons in the conduction band of the CdS shell. The edge of the conduction band of the CuInS2 QDs is higher than that of the CdS shell, which prohibits the inter-conduction band transfer of electrons from the CdS shell to the CuInS2 QDs. Under these circumstances, the electrons in the conduction band of the CdS would scavenge the holes in the CuInS2 QDs through process 2. This process can substantially enhance the separation of photogenerated charges in the CuInS2 QDs and thus enhance the photocurrent of the electrode. Therefore, the enhancement of the photocurrent by CdS coating can be ascribed mainly to remission of the quantum confinement extending the absorption spectra in conjunction with the occurrence of process 2.
The band edge level diagram in Fig. 8 reflects the possibility of injection of the photogenerated electrons in the CuInS2 QDs to the CdS conduction band, in addition to injection to the TiO2 conduction band through process 1. However, the CdS coating would have not enhanced the saturated photocurrent contributed by CuInS2 if electron injection to the CdS conduction band occurred. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows that the CdS coating resulted in a significant increase in Voc under illumination, indicating that leakage of the photogenerated electrons in the QDs through the coated CdS was unlikely to occur. Therefore, the occurrence of process 2 to enhance the charge separation for photocurrent is very plausible.
Photon energy conversion optimization of the sensitized electrodes

Fig. 9 shows the photoresponses of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS photoelectrodes carried out by potentiostatic (current vs. time, I–t) measurements at two different bias potentials (zero and 0.4 V) under intermittent illumination. Under illumination, all three photoelectrodes showed a prompt rise in photocurrent. However, under zero bias (Fig. 9(a)) a sharp decrease in photocurrent was observed in the initial stage of each illumination period. In contrast, under a potential bias of 0.4 V (Fig. 9(b)), a steady photocurrent was obtained during the entire illumination period. The sharp drop in photocurrent has been used to determine the electron collecting efficiency of the TiO2 nanocrystalline films.60 Under zero bias the electron collecting efficiency, that is, the ratio of stabilized current to initial current, was 36%, 57% and 90% for the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs, TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS, and TiO2/CdS photoelectrodes, respectively. This indicates that the CdS coating by SILAR hindered electron recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, in agreement with the results of Fig. 7. Using a bifunctional linker to attach CuInS2 QDs provided an electrode prone to interfacial recombination. By biasing the potential to 0.4 V to facilitate rapid electron transport in the TiO2 film, electron collecting efficiency of nearly 100% for each electrode can be achieved. Under these circumstances, the tradeoff between photocurrent involved in photoelectrochemical reactions and the external power supplied to facilitate electron transport must be taken into account to optimize the efficiency of light conversion.
 Fig. 9  Photocurrent density versus time of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS photoelectrodes obtained by potentiostatic measurements at two different bias potentials of (a) zero and (b) 0.4 V under intermittent illumination. The size of CuInS2 QDs employed was 3.5 nm and the SILAR cycle number for CdS deposition was 11. 
Assuming that all of the photocurrent flowing from the photoelectrode to the Pt counter was consumed in hydrogen generation,10 the conversion efficiency ηc, representing the percentage of light energy converted to chemical energy at a given bias potential, is calculated by the following equation:1b,61ηc(%) = [(energy converted to chemical reactions − energy supplied by external bias)/energy of incident light] × 100ηc(%) = [Jp (ΔG°rev − Ebias)/J0] × 100where ΔG°rev is the Gibbs free energy per coulomb of electrons for the redox reactions on electrodes, Jp is the photocurrent density and J0 is the intensity of the incident light, which is 100 mW cm−2 in this study. The above equation reflects a tradeoff between the power output required for water splitting and the external power supplied in converting light energy. We used ΔG°rev of water splitting, 1.23 V, to calculate the conversion efficiency. This overestimates the conversion efficiency because the photoanode did not oxidize water to generate oxygen. Fig. 10 shows the conversion efficiency of the optimally-sensitized electrodes based on the potential dependence of the photocurrent density shown in Fig. 6. This tradeoff led to a maximum conversion efficiency of 3.1% for the 3.5 nm CuInS2 sensitized electrode at +0.29 V bias, 7.2% for the CdS sensitized electrode at +0.18 V bias, and 13% for the electrode co-sensitized with 3.5 nm CuInS2 QDs and CdS at +0.34 V bias. Although the conversion efficiency values in Fig. 10 are overestimated, the synergistic effect represents a significant advance in the field of ternary chalcopyrite QDs sensitization as well as that of II–VI compounds. The combined effect of quantum confinement remission and vectorial displacement of charges resulting from II–VI-compound SILAR capping the QDs is the key to the high photoelectrochemical performance.

The size of CuInS2 QDs employed was 3.5 nm and the SILAR cycle number for CdS deposition was 11. 
Conclusions
A photoanode fabricated by co-sensitizing TiO2 nanocrystalline films with CuInS2 QDs and CdS showed a saturated photocurrent as high as 16 mA cm−2 in a polysulfide solution under AM 1.5 solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The heterostructure of this electrode comprises presynthesized CuInS2 QDs attached to TiO2 film via a bifunctional linker with a CdS layers grown to cap the QDs and complete the coverage of the TiO2 surface. Coating the CuInS2 QDs with CdS significantly extended the light absorption spectra of the QDs to longer wavelengths due to remission of the quantum confinement effect. When the electrodes were assembled in photoelectrochemical cells, the CdS coating increased the photocurrent contributed by the QDs from 3.6 to 7.8 mA cm−2; that is, more than a 100% increase in the turnover frequency of the QDs in charge separation. Based on the band edge levels of the sensitizers and TiO2, the enhanced electron injection from the QDs to TiO2 is ascribed to quantum confinement remission and the scavenge of the photogenerated holes by photogenerated electrons in the CdS shell capping the QDs. By combining the advantages of presynthesized QDs and layers grown in situ by SILAR, the heterostructure of this electrode showed high charge separation efficiency and supracollector characteristics for the photoelectrochemical cells. This study provides useful insights for the development of new heterostructural supracollectors tailored for photosynthetic and photovoltaic applications by combining sensitizers of specialized functions.

Processes 1–3 show a sequence of the injection of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of CuInS2 QDs, the scavenge of holes in the valence band of CuInS2 QDs by the electrons in the CdS coating, and the extraction of the photogenerated holes in the CdS by a reaction with sulfide/sulfite species in the electrolyte solution.	 

 	Fig. 9  Photocurrent density versus time of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS photoelectrodes obtained by potentiostatic measurements at two different bias potentials of (a) zero and (b) 0.4 V under intermittent illumination. The size of CuInS2 QDs employed was 3.5 nm and the SILAR cycle number for CdS deposition was 11.	 
ηc(%) = [(energy converted to chemical reactions − energy supplied by external bias)/energy of incident light] × 100
ηc(%) = [Jp (ΔG°rev − Ebias)/J0] × 100

 	Fig. 10  Light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency of the TiO2/CuInS2 QDs, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CuInS2 QDs/CdS photoelectrodes obtained at varying potential bias under illumination with AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2. The size of CuInS2 QDs employed was 3.5 nm and the SILAR cycle number for CdS deposition was 11.
