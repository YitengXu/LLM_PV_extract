The maximum achievable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices1 is approaching that of amorphous silicon devices,2 but the efficiency of OPVs drops during power generation for reasons that are not well understood. Among the numerous conceivable causes of this phenomenon, the diffusion of molecular oxygen into the device is suspected to be a major factor,3 as has been experimentally demonstrated for organic light-emitting diodes and organic field-effect transistors.4 What chemical species actually causes the damage, and how it does so remain open questions yet to be addressed experimentally.5 Since it is not practical to isolate and fully characterize the oxidized products in a deteriorated device, we conjectured that we could synthesize a model compound that likely forms in the device under the influence of light and molecular oxygen, and then test the compound's effect on device performance. We identified a new class of photooxidation products (SIMEF-O2, Scheme 1) derived from an OPV fullerene acceptor, 1,4-bis(dimethylphenylsilylmethyl)[60]fullerene (SIMEF),6 as a model compound, and studied how it degrades the performance of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device containing a 0:100 to 100:0 mixture of SIMEF-O2 and SIMEF together with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor in the active layer. We report here the synthesis, crystal structure, and physical properties of SIMEF-O2, which is a unique open-cage [60]fullerene,7 and the effects of the SIMEF-O2:SIMEF ratio on device performance parameters.
 Scheme 1  Oxidation of SIMEF to SIMEF-O2. 
The present study was made possible by our discovery of a new photo-oxygenation reaction of a fullerene derivative that gives a single well-defined product. SIMEF in O2-saturated carbon disulfide (CS2) was irradiated with a 60 W incandescent lamp at 25–30 °C for 6 days to produce SIMEF-O2 (C60(CH2SiMe2Ph)2O2) in 25% isolated yield with 54% recovery of the starting material. We also observed further oxidized products such as SIMEF-O4, but did not find any regioisomer of SIMEF-O2. No oxidation took place in the dark under otherwise identical conditions. The same reaction took place in various solvents, albeit more slowly (toluene, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, chloroform, benzene, and a mixture of C6F6 and CS2; see ESI†). In addition, the oxidation occurred even in the solid state (7.7% SIMEF-O2 formed by oxidation for 24 h), but oxidation was slower in the solid state than in solution (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The product was purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. The purified product slowly decomposed in CS2 over 3 weeks at room temperature under air (ca. 15% loss), but was more stable in toluene and chlorobenzene (ESI†).
When we ran the reaction in the presence of gaseous 16O2 and 200 equiv. of H218O in CS2, we did not find any incorporation of 18O into SIMEF-O2 as judged by mass spectrometry (MS). Thus, we conclude that both of the oxygen atoms in SIMEF-O2 come from molecular oxygen.
The unique open-cage structure was determined by a variety of spectroscopic methods and by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization MS data (m/z = 1050) indicated that two oxygen atoms were added to SIMEF (m/z = 1018). The IR spectrum shows a CO stretch at 1714 cm−1 and the 13C NMR spectrum shows a downfield-shifted signal at δ 200.14, suggesting the presence of a ketone substructure on the fullerene cage. The 2D HMBC spectrum shows correlation peaks between the carbonyl carbon atoms and the methylene hydrogen atoms, indicating that the carbonyl and silylmethyl groups are near each other. The UV-Vis spectra of SIMEF-O2 and SIMEF are similar, with the exception that the absorption maximum around 450 nm,8 which is characteristic of 1,4-diadducts such as SIMEF, was absent in the spectrum of SIMEF-O2 (ESI†).
The X-ray crystallographic analysis of a black single crystal obtained by slow diffusion of ethanol into a CS2 solution of SIMEF-O2 confirmed the open-cage structure having a nine-membered ring diketone (Fig. 1). The two ketones are standing upright on the surface of the fullerene core and are not conjugated with the neighboring CC bonds (Fig. 1(a)). This geometrical arrangement is consistent with the short CO bond lengths (1.213(8) and 1.212(8) Å) and the IR absorption frequency of the CO stretch (vide supra). The distance between the two ketone carbon atoms is 2.77 Å which is very short. The molecule is nearly Cs symmetric (Fig. 1(b) and (c)). The fullerene cores are aligned along the a-axis (Fig. 1(d)).

Finally, we note that the two silylmethyl groups are essential for this reaction; exposure of a 1,4-dibenzyl analogue to the same conditions did not give any of the corresponding diketone. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was found to be stable under the present conditions.9
We next investigated some fundamental properties of SIMEF-O2 relevant to OPV device fabrication. Not unexpectedly, the solubility of SIMEF-O2 in a polar solvent is two- or three-fold that of SIMEF (SIMEF-O2: 279 mg mL−1 in CS2, 121 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene; SIMEF: 116 mg mL−1 in CS2, 41 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene), and their solubility in toluene is similar (SIMEF-O2: 7.5 mg mL−1; SIMEF: 8.9 mg mL−1). Along this line, we consider that SIMEF-O2 is miscible with P3HT as suggested from the visible light absorption spectra of a mixture of P3HT and SIMEF-O2:SIMEF, in which an increasing amount of SIMEF-O2 reduces the absorption around 600 nm that is characteristic of crystalline P3HT (ESI†).
Thermal analysis of SIMEF-O2 by differential scanning calorimetry showed glass-to-glass transition, crystallization, and decomposition temperatures of 114, 163, and 261 °C, respectively (ESI†). The melting point of SIMEF-O2 is higher than that of SIMEF (225 °C).
As judged by cyclic voltammetry, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of SIMEF-O2 (−3.84 eV) is slightly lower than those of the parent SIMEF and PCBM (Table 1), which can be attributed to the presence of the ketone groups. We used the Mott–Gurney law to estimate the electron mobility from space-charge limited current (ESI†). The electron mobility of SIMEF-O2 as a thin film is acceptably high (5.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; cf. SIMEF = 8.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).10

With the well-defined oxidized product SIMEF-O2 in hand, we examined the effects of its presence on the device performance of an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al BHJ OPV device containing a 0:100 to 100:0 mixture of SIMEF-O2 and SIMEF (total amount being kept constant) together with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor in the active layer. The device performance precipitously decreased as the amount of SIMEF-O2 was increased, and recovered slightly as the composition becomes 100% SIMEF-O2 (Table 2, device 7). The 100% SIMEF:P3HT device (device 1) showed a respectable PCE of 3.2% with good open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) values, and the presence of 1% SIMEF-O2 caused a remarkable 40% drop in PCE, primarily because of the decrease in Jsc, and the shape of the J–V profile remains largely unchanged (Fig. 2). This result suggests that even at 1% SIMEF-O2 content, this oxidized fullerene with a low-lying LUMO acted as a localized electron trap in the BHJ film.11 As the amount of SIMEF-O2 was increased to 25%, the PCE value dropped to as low as 0.19% and the J–V curve changed to an S-shape (Fig. 2), indicating that the efficiency of charge separation dropped. Notably, a large change in the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE; Fig. S8, ESI†) also occurred as the percentage was changed from 1% to 25%. Since the UV/vis spectrum of the SIMEF-O2:SIMEF mixture does not strongly depend on the mixing ratio (ESI†), the decrease in IPCE around 600 nm suggests a decreasing degree of P3HT order with increasing SIMEF-O2 content. Finally, for the 100% SIMEF-O2 device (device 7), the PCE value became twice that of device 6, owing to the increased Jsc value. This increase in PCE corroborates the larger current density of device 7 at the reverse bias voltage in comparison with devices 5 and 6 (Fig. 2).

J–V curves for ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al devices (active layer = P3HT:SIMEF (100 − x):SIMEF-O2 (x), (x = weight percentage of SIMEF-O2 to total amount of SIMEF and SIMEF-O2)), measured under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2, 1 sun). 
To gain further insight into the effect of the SIMEF-O2:SIMEF ratio on BHJ morphology, we examined the surface topography and phase images of the P3HT:SIMEF:SIMEF-O2 film by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surface roughness became small as the percentage of SIMEF-O2 became larger (Fig. S9a–c, ESI†), which agrees with the higher solubility of SIMEF-O2 in polar solvents. This also creates the less ordered BHJ structure (Fig. S9d–f, ESI†), leading to poor charge separation and transport in the active layer.
In conclusion, we found that SIMEF reacts with molecular oxygen under photoirradiation, and the presence of the oxidized product SIMEF-O2 in the active layer of a bulk heterojunction OPV device seriously degrades device performance. Even a miniscule amount of SIMEF-O2 acts as an electron trap and substantially lowers PCE. Further increases in SIMEF-O2 content reduce PCE by lowering the efficiency of charge separation. Inefficient charge separation likely occurs because of the loss of the BHJ morphology. These experimental results offer clues to understanding the mechanism of device degradation, and suggest the use of a photooxidation-resistant n-type semiconductor as a possible means to extend the lifetime of OPV devices.
