    , Accepted 10th February 2023First published on 10th February 2023AbstractHerein, we demonstrate cobaloximes as a bioinspired molecular platform for exclusive ammonia synthesis via electrocatalytic NO2− reduction (eNO2−RR), which attained 98.5% faradaic efficiency (FE) under close-to-neutral conditions. Mechanistic studies illustrated that cobaloximes furnished effective binding with NO2− and nitrogenous intermediates, along with continuous, rapid 6e−/8H+ transfer with an intramolecular hydrogen bonding framework. As the cobaloxime skeleton displayed tunable structures on axial and equatorial sites for selective NO2− to NH4+ transformation, integrating cobaloximes with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as working electrodes attained advantageous ammonia yields of 19.3 mg h−1 mgCat−1 with >95% FE at −0.5 V vs. RHE. More strikingly, cobaloxime-catalyzed NO2− to NH4+ transformation was coupled with plasma-driven N2 oxidation (pNOR) to convert ambient air into NH4Cl at a mmol-scale. This work demonstrates promising prospects of bioinspired molecular catalytic platforms for effective and selective ammonia and nitrogenous chemical synthesis via NOx−.

Broader context
Bioinspired cobaloximes with a CoN4 skeleton and intramolecular hydrogen bonds offer a clear molecular model for NO2− to NH4+ synthesis, by boosting effective NO2− binding and sequential 6e−/8H+ transfer. The cobaloxime skeleton not only exhibits advantageous molecular tunability, but also attains high mass-specific ammonia yields when immobilized onto MWCNTs. Coupled with plasma N2 oxidation, preparative-scale ammonia synthesis in the form of NH4Cl was executed with ambient air and renewable electricity. Compared with the energy- and emission-intensive Haber–Bosch process and electrocatalytic/photocatalytic N2 reduction, the competitive ammonia yield and selectivity demonstrate the viability of developing bioinspired molecular skeletons to accomplish sustainable ammonia synthesis from ambient air and renewable electricity via NOx−.

Introduction
Ammonia (NH3) is a promising fuel carrier and the basis for various N-containing fertilizers, explosives and pharmaceutical compounds.1–3 However, the synthesis of NH3 is notoriously energy-intensive, inefficient and unsustainable,4 as the state-of-the-art Haber–Bosch process requires harsh temperatures (∼700 K) and pressures (∼150 bar), consuming 1.5% of the world's fossil fuels. Painstaking efforts for ambient NH3 synthesis have been made in electrocatalytic N2 reduction (eNRR),5–8 photocatalytic N2 reduction (photo-NRR),9–13 and tandem electrocatalytic N2 oxidation and NOx− reduction (eNOR–eNOx−RR).14 Nevertheless, the faint NH3 yields (<0.1 mg h−1 mgcat−1)15–18 and severe H2 evolution side reactions19,20 pose tremendous barriers for scalable ammonia synthesis, owing to the particular difficulty of N2 activation (946 kJ mol−1) and poor N2 solubility (∼10−2 g L−1 at 1 atm). Comparatively, nitrogen oxyanions (NOx−, x = 2, 3) possess N–O bonds with high polarities and low dissociation energies (204 kJ mol−1), thus exhibiting tremendously greater solubility (>102 g L−1) and reactivity. Furthermore, NOx− have more favorable reduction potentials (+0.897 V and +0.876 V vs. RHE at pH = 0 for NO2− and NO3−, respectively) than N2 (+0.275 V vs. RHE at pH = 0),21,22 which suppress selectivity loss by the parasitic H2 evolution reaction.23–25 As indispensable participants in the global nitrogen cycle, NOx− have widespread presence in wastewater and can be continuously generated from the air by lightning26 and spark, glow and dielectric barrier discharges with electricity,27–29 which offers convenient and sustainable access for ammonia synthesis.
As NO2− to NH4+ transformation is a 6e−/8H+ process involving multiple nitrogenous species,NO2− + 6e− + 8H+ → NH4+ + 2H2Oa rational catalyst design is paramount, in order to address effective binding with NO2− and nitrogenous intermediates, along with rapid, continuous delivery of electrons and protons to the catalytic center. Natural cytochrome c nitrite reductase (CcNiR, Fig. 1) offers a role model for eNO2−RR with a remarkable rate of 1130 mg h−1 mg−1 at pH = 7.0.30 The close-packed FeN4 catalytic centers perform NO2− binding and multielectron reduction and well-oriented peripheral amino acid channels assist proton shuttling and N–H bond formation.30–33 Since cobalt demonstrates the optimum NO2− binding and N–O bond dissociation thermodynamics in the catalytic volcano plot,34,35 Co-based heterogeneous nanomaterials, including metallic Co,36 oxides,37,38 borides39 and phosphides40 with diverse structures and morphologies, attain attractive eNOx−RR current densities, but the unclear atomic active sites and uncontrollable second-sphere structures hamper rational catalyst development and optimization. On the other hand, eNOx−RR can be catalysed by homogeneous, macrocyclic Co complexes,41–46 but realizing complete and high-yield NO2− to NH4+ transformation is particularly challenging under mild potentials, due to the inefficiency of consecutive 6e− transfer to the catalytic centre.47

In this situation, we speculate that cobaloximes with a CoN4 skeleton should be an ideal platform for 6e−/8H+ NO2− to NH4+ reduction (Fig. 1). For diverse multiproton transformations,48–57 cobaloximes possess intramolecular hydrogen bonding frameworks to expedite consecutive proton delivery. Furthermore, cobaloximes are amenable to extensive structural modifications on equatorial and axial positions,49,58,59 giving access to cobaloxime-modified electrodes with greatly accelerated multielectron transfer kinetics and enhanced stability.60–62 Our results demonstrate that cobaloximes can accomplish electrocatalytic NO2− to NH4+ transformation with 98.5% faradaic efficiency (FE) under near-neutral conditions (pH = 6.7 phosphate buffer). During eNO2−RR, cobaloximes maintained their molecular identity and integrity. Mechanistic studies showed that cobaloximes facilitated strong interactions with NO2− and rapid multielectron and proton reduction kinetics via NO and NH2OH intermediates, which contributed to exclusive NH4+ synthesis. The cobaloxime framework maintained close-to-unity NH4+ selectivity after introducing axial pyridines and fused diimine–dioxime structures. When integrated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes on carbon paper (MWCNT@CP) electrodes, ammonia synthesis proceeded with a mass-specific activity of 19.3 mg h−1 mgCat−1 at −0.5 V vs. RHE with >95% FE, which is advantageous among various as-reported eNOx−RR catalysts. Benefitting from the stability (>10 h) of cobaloxime-modified MWCNT@CP electrodes for NO2− to NH4+ turnovers, eNO2−RR was coupled with plasma-driven N2 oxidation to implement mmol-scale NH4Cl synthesis and separation, using ambient air as the nitrogen source. Compared with ammonia synthesis via the conventional Haber–Bosch process and electro(photo)catalytic N2 reduction, the tandem N2 to NH4Cl synthesis presents a rewarding efficiency under ambient conditions with solar electricity, which demonstrates promising horizons for effective, sustainable and scalable ammonia synthesis, taking advantage of renewable electricity and bioinspired eNO2−RR catalysts.
Results and discussions
Molecular eNO2−RR
We first studied the Co(dmgH)(dmgH2)Cl2 (dmg = dimethylglyoximato, Co-1) complex as the model catalyst for molecular eNO2−RR in 0.25 M pH = 6.7 phosphate buffer. Upon NaNO2 addition, a dramatic increase of peak current at about −1.05 V vs. SCE (−0.41 V vs. RHE) close to the CoII/CoI reduction event50,63 was observed (Fig. 2(a)), showing evident dependence on the NO2− (Fig. S20a, ESI†) and Co-1 concentrations (Fig. S20b, ESI†). Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) at −0.34 V vs. RHE showed that Co-1 displayed enhanced current density, NH4+ yield and selectivity gradually under increased NO2− concentrations (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S21, ESI†), which transitioned from a H2 evolution catalyst to a NO2− reduction catalyst with initial NaNO2 concentrations from 0 to 18 mM. In 50 mM NaNO2, NH4+ was generated with 98.5% faradaic efficiency, giving very minor amounts of NH2OH (FE = 1.3%) and H2 (FE = 0.2%) as by-products. Under identical conditions, the rinse test gave reduced currents by an order of magnitude and minimal currents were observed with a bare glassy carbon electrode or CoCl2 instead of Co-1 (Fig. 2(c)), which excluded catalytic contributions of background electrode reactions or deposited particulate species and verified that the cobaloxime skeleton was essential for NO2− reduction. The source of generated NH4+ was confirmed by parallel 15NO2− reduction experiments, which gave comparable charges in CPE (Fig. 2(c)) and exclusively yielded a characteristic 1H NMR doublet of 15NH4+ at 7.31 ppm with 2JN–H = 73 Hz (Fig. S22, ESI†).

(c) CPE of Co-1 in the presence of 14NO2− and 15NO2− and control experiments in the rinse test, with CoCl2 instead of Co-1 and in the absence of Co-1 at −0.34 V vs. RHE with 50 mM NaNO2. (d) Proposed NO2− reduction mechanism of cobaloximes. (e) NH4+ faradaic efficiency and yields using different cobaloxime complexes with axial (L) and equatorial (R) modifications. All evaluations were conducted with 1.0 mM Co-x (x = 1, 2,… and 10) and 50 mM NaNO2 in 0.25 M pH = 6.7 phosphate buffer at −0.34 V vs. RHE for 3600 s, using a 1.00 cm2 glassy carbon working electrode. 
It is imperative to confirm the molecular identity of Co-1 in the eNO2−RR.64 The XPS of the working electrode showed no Co 2p signals after CPE (Fig. S23b, ESI†), suggesting negligible deposition of the Co species. Besides, dynamic light scattering (DLS) excluded solution-based particles beyond the dimensionality of the Co-1 complex (Fig. S24, ESI†). Pristine Co-1 has the M+ signal at m/z = 289.0345 in high-resolution mass spectrometry (Fig. S6, ESI†) and after CPE, the dominating m/z = 289.0334 signal was consistent with the Co-1 complex (Fig. S25, ESI†), indicating the well-preserved molecular structure. It was only after long CPE that slight structural variations of Co-1 appeared in 1H NMR (Fig. S26, ESI†). The newly-emerged signals in higher fields implied N–O bond hydrogenolysis and CN bond hydrogenation in Co-1, which were proposed as primary causes of catalyst instability in previous H2 evolution studies,65 but the rather minor portions (<10%) and low concentrations of these species prevented us from studying them in more detail.
The eNO2−RR mechanism was then studied. Upon NO2− addition, the axial pyridine exhibited an extra set of signals in 1H NMR (Fig. S27, ESI†) and the –CH3 resonances also transitioned to higher fields, showing significant interactions of NO2− with cobaloxime. The axial binding of NO2− with Co-1 was further corroborated by the Nernstian shift of the CoIII/CoII reduction potentials at different NO2− concentrations by −126 mV dec−1 (Fig. S28, ESI†).45 The catalytic peak for NO2− reduction exhibited pH-dependent potentials of −66 mV pH−1 between 5.9 and 7.4 (Fig. S29, ESI†). A kinetic isotope effect of 0.968 ± 0.082, by performing CPE at −0.34 V vs. RHE in H2O and D2O (Fig. S30, ESI†), showed that the proton transfer was not the rate-limiting step, indicating rapid proton delivery of the cobaloxime skeleton to furnish proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) for selective NO2− to NH4+ transformation.
Along with 6e−/8H+ reduction, the transformations of nitric oxide (NO) and hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as key nitrogenous intermediates were studied. Under −0.34 V vs. RHE, Co-1 also catalyzed the reduction of NO with steady and significant current densities (Fig. S31, ESI†), affording NH4+ as the dominant product with 82% faradaic efficiency. Feeding Co-1 with 10 mM NH2OH instead of NO2− as the substrate, NH4+ was also produced with 41% faradaic efficiency (Fig. S32, ESI†). For both NO and NH2OH reduction experiments, the absence of Co-1 gave very sluggish current densities of ∼1/30 and ∼1/200 with 1.0 mM Co-1, and NH4+ was barely detectable, clearly showing that the 5e−/6H+ NO to NH4+ and 2e−/3H+ NH2OH to NH4+ steps, which are necessary for NO2− to NH4+ reduction, must be catalyzed by the Co-1 catalyst, rather than the glassy carbon electrode alone. Therefore, the NO2− to NH4+ mechanism is proposed as in Fig. 2(d): Co-1 readily binds with NO2− and undergoes consecutive reduction events to CoI. The transfomation of Co–NO2 to Co–NH3 involves Co–NO and Co–NH2OH intermediates. Compared with other metal complexes documented in the eNO2−RR (Table S1, ESI†),42,43,45,66–69 Co-1 requires mild potentials and attains superior (>95%) faradaic efficiency for NH4+. In particular, in resemblance to CcNiR, bioinspired Co-1 rapidly and completely reduces in-situ-generated nitrogenous intermediates to NH4+, showing promising profiles for NO2− to NH4+ synthesis.
The close-to-unity NO2− to NH4+ selectivity of the Co-1 model can be extended to various cobaloxime complexes with the CoN4 skeleton and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. We introduced various pyridine-based axial ligands (Ls) by adding stoichiometric amounts of Ls to the hot methanolic solution of Co-1 (ESI†)70 and to our delight, the prepared Co-2–Co-8 complexes gave >86% FEs for the eNO2−RR (Fig. 2(e)). The presence of proton-shuttling groups (especially –COOH and –CONH2) in the axial pyridines afforded particularly impressive current densities and NH4+ yields under identical conditions (Fig. S33–S39, ESI†), owing to enhanced proton delivery. In addition, we prepared fused diimine–dioxime complexes Co-9 and Co-10 with –CH2CH2 and benzylic groups, which have enhanced structural stability.71 Excitingly, near-unity NH4+ FEs of 96% and 99% were recorded for Co-9 and Co-10 and the ammonia yields attained were 1.5 and 2.5 times that of Co-1 (Fig. 2(e) and Fig. S40, S41a, ESI†). The good catalyst stability maintained after electrolysis with no evidence of Co particle deposition (Fig. S41b, ESI†) and the preservation of mild reduction potentials and exclusive ammonia selectivity (Table S1, ESI†) with various axial and equatorial modifications demonstrate cobaloximes as a versatile and adaptable eNO2−RR platform for ammonia synthesis.
eNO2−RR with cobaloxime-modified electrodes
The impressive structural tunability and ammonia selectivity stimulated us to fabricate cobaloxime-modified electrodes, in order to expedite sequential 6e− electron transfer to the CoN4 skeleton and improve catalyst utilization. We introduced cobaloximes to multi-walled carbon nanotubes/carbon paper (MWCNT@CP) electrodes by physisorption and polymer coating with Nafion. The preparation of the cobaloxime/MWCNT@CP electrodes is described in the ESI† and the mass loadings were set at 0.1 mg cm−2. Uniform loading of Co-1 was confirmed by SEM elemental mapping (Fig. S42, ESI†). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of cobaloxime/MWCNT@CP showed that the current density of Co-1/MWCNT@CP increased dramatically with an onset (>1 mA cm−2) of −0.1 V vs. RHE in the presence of NaNO2. In the absence of NaNO2, the current density of Co-1/MWCNT@CP was inferior with an onset of −0.3 V vs. RHE and the absence of Co-1 gave sluggish current densities. Greatly enhanced current densities were also noted upon loading of Co-2, Co-9 and Co-10, showing general eNO2−RR activity of cobaloxime-modified electrodes (Fig. 3(a)).

(c) The ammonia yields and selectivities of different Co-n/MWCNT@CP (n = 1, 2, 9, and 10) electrodes. (d) The stability of the current density and ammonia yields for 10 h. (e) The progressive N2–NO2−–NH4+ transformation over time in tandem plasma-driven N2 oxidation (insets: the images of spark discharge and NO2− measurement by the Griess method at different times) and eNO2−RR (insets: the H-cell and isolated NH4Cl). 
Chronoamperometry was then performed and the ammonia yields were evaluated by both the colorimetric method and 1H NMR. As depicted in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. S43 (ESI†), the current density and NH4+ yields increased steadily from −0.30 V to −0.60 V, maintaining FENH3 at around 95%. Simultaneously, the amounts of NH2OH and N2H4 as possible by-products were below the detection limit, and H2 evolution only took ∼1% faradaic efficiency between −0.30 V and −0.60 V. Increasing the NaNO2 concentration also enhanced the NH4+ yield and faradaic efficiency (Fig. S44 and S45, ESI†), which attained 19.3 mg h−1 mgCat−1 and 98.1%, respectively, with 100 mM NO2− at −0.50 V vs. RHE. In control experiments, parallel 15NO2− reduction afforded 15NH4+ exclusively (Fig. S46, ESI†), showing consistent current density (Fig. S47, ESI†), faradaic efficiency (99.5%) and ammonia yield. Chronoamperometry of cobaloxime-free MWCNT@CP electrodes at −0.5 V vs. RHE gave sluggish current densities (Fig. S48, ESI†) and poor NH3 yield an order of magnitude lower than with Co-1. Nitrite-free electrolyte and open-circuit conditions produced minimal NH3 of 0.05 mM and 0.02 mM, further excluding ambient ammonia contamination. Interestingly, the MWCNT@CP electrode modified with Co-2 (axial pyridine) preserved impressive NO2−-to-NH4+ performance of 21.1 mg h−1 mgCat−1 with unity NH4+ selectivity. For MWCNT@CP electrodes modified with cobalt diimine–dioxime Co-9 and Co-10 complexes, effective ammonia synthesis was performed at 9.72 and 19.5 mg h−1 mgCat−1 with 91.7% and 99.6% faradaic efficiencies (Fig. 3(c)). Under moderate potentials, the mass-specific performances for Co-n/MWCNT@CP (n = 1, 2, 9, and 10) electrodes rank top among the various eNO2−RR catalysts reported so far (Table S2, ESI†),21,72–78 which demonstrates the outstanding eNO2−RR efficiency, selectivity and generality of cobaloxime-modified electrodes.
The stability of the cobaloxime/MWCNT@CP electrocatalysts was evaluated with long-hour electrolysis. Co-1/MWCNT@CP furnished ammonia synthesis at a steady rate of ∼120 μmol h−1 (Fig. 3(d)) for 10 h, presenting an extraordinary linear relationship between ammonia concentration over electrolysis time (Fig. S50, ESI†). A slow decline of current density was observed due to significant NO2− consumption (Fig. 3(d)). After electrolysis, Co 2p XPS (Fig. S51, ESI†) of the Co-1/MWCNT@CP electrode displayed neither a notable shift of the Co3+ and Co2+ binding energy, nor significant alteration of the Co3+/Co2+ ratios. The SEM elemental mapping of the Co-1/MWCNT@CP electrode (Fig. S52a and b, ESI†) presented that Co atoms remained uniformly distributed on the CNTs, without a noticeable tendency of aggregation. Post-electrolysis Co-2/MWCNT@CP and Co-10/MWCNT@CP also rendered clear Co mappings dominantly and evenly on the MWCNTs (Fig. S52d and h, ESI†), while catalyst detachment was observed for Co-9 (Fig. S52e and f, ESI†), which lacks planarity and π-conjugation.71 The observations indicate that cobaloxime-modified CNT@CP electrodes with planar, π-conjugating groups exhibit good stability with minimal surface structural transformations after long-hour electrolysis, which offers valuable information for further catalyst development.
Tandem plasma-driven N2 oxidation and eNO2−RR
The impressive eNO2−RR profiles of cobaloximes encouraged us to take further steps towards practical ammonia synthesis, using ambient air (78% N2 and 21% O2, 1 atm) as the nitrogen source. Here, atmospheric dinitrogen was fixed dominantly (>95%) into NO2− using spark discharge followed by NaOH absorption. Renewable solar-electricity powered the pNOR device to continuously produce 4640 μmol NO2− (Fig. S55, ESI†), with optimum rates of 50 μmol h−1 (Fig. 3(e)). Using the as-generated NO2− (51.6 mM) from pNOR as the substrate, an eNO2−RR FE of 88% was recorded for the Co-1 complex (Fig. S56, ESI†). More strikingly, the Co-1/MWCNT@CP electrode operating at −0.5 V vs. RHE furnished steady NH3 synthesis for 12 h (Fig. S57, ESI†) to yield 0.438 mmol NH4+ (Fig. 3(e)) with 89% FE. The mass-specific ammonia yield of this tandem pNOR-eNO2−RR system is advantageous compared with thermal N2 to NH3 transformation (including the Haber–Bosch process),79,80 electrocatalytic N2 reduction,81,82 electrocatalytic N2 oxidation coupled with NOx− reduction,83 photocatalytic N2 reduction,11,84,85 and Li-mediated ammonia synthesis (Table S3, ESI†).86 Its applicability for progressive N2–NO2−–NH4+ manufacturing was also manifested by sequential and complementary solar-driven pNOR in the daytime and eNO2−RR at night (Fig. 3(e)). In practice, high-purity ammonium salts (e.g., NH4Cl) separated from the electrolyte are preferable.87 The post-eNO2−RR catholyte was basefied and distilled to liberate the as-obtained NH3, which was intercepted by a HCl trap followed by evaporation, isolating 24.5 mg NH4Cl (Fig. 3(e)).
Conclusions
In summary, cobaloximes are established as an exclusive, effective and versatile eNO2−RR platform for ammonia synthesis. The outstanding ammonia selectivity is attributed to effective binding with NO2− and nitrogenous intermediates, as well as rapid electron and proton transfers of the imine–oxime framework with intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which demonstrated a biomimetic model of catalytic NO2−RR skeletons. During the eNO2−RR, cobaloximes preserved their molecular identity and integrity and displayed particular structural tunability with pyridine-based axial ligands and bridged diimine–dioxime structures. By introducing the cobaloxime skeleton to MWCNT@CP electrodes, a distinguishable NO2− to NH4+ yield of 19.3 mg h−1 mgCat−1 was attained at −0.50 V vs. RHE for consecutively 10 h with >95% faradaic efficiency. Using sustainable solar-electricity, ambient N2 fixation was realized by coupling the cobaloxime eNO2−RR platform with plasma-driven N2 to NO2− oxidation, which realized 0.438 mmol synthesis of high-purity NH4Cl from ambient air, attaining superior mass-specific ammonia yields over conventional N2 to ammonia methodologies and catalysts. The superb structural tunability and catalytic activity of cobaloximes highlight bioinspired molecular development for energy conversion and storage.88,89 The impressive performance of cobaloxime complexes and modified electrodes will encourage their applications for more effective, scalable, and valuable tandem multielectron and proton synthesis of ammonia and nitrogenous chemicals from N2 and NOx−, which is being actively studied in our lab.

Broader context
Bioinspired cobaloximes with a CoN4 skeleton and intramolecular hydrogen bonds offer a clear molecular model for NO2− to NH4+ synthesis, by boosting effective NO2− binding and sequential 6e−/8H+ transfer. The cobaloxime skeleton not only exhibits advantageous molecular tunability, but also attains high mass-specific ammonia yields when immobilized onto MWCNTs. Coupled with plasma N2 oxidation, preparative-scale ammonia synthesis in the form of NH4Cl was executed with ambient air and renewable electricity. Compared with the energy- and emission-intensive Haber–Bosch process and electrocatalytic/photocatalytic N2 reduction, the competitive ammonia yield and selectivity demonstrate the viability of developing bioinspired molecular skeletons to accomplish sustainable ammonia synthesis from ambient air and renewable electricity via NOx−.

NO2− + 6e− + 8H+ → NH4+ + 2H2O
