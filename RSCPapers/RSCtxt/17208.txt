Soc., Faraday Trans. 1, 1982, 78, 2279-2283Stabilization of cuprous oxide photocathode in aqueous thiocyanate solution by aliphatic alcohols(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )K. Tennakone, W. G. D. Dharmaratna and S. C. JayewardenaAbstractLong-chain normal aliphatic alcohols are found to suppress photocorrosion and increase the efficiency of a cuprous oxide photoelectrochemical cell with aqueous thiocyanate solution as the electrolyte. It is suggested that alcohols inhibit corrosion by surface adsorption.
