    , Accepted 23rd February 2017First published on 24th February 2017AbstractThe focus of this research is on the electron transfer and its reaction rate at the perovskite cathode of a photoelectrochemical cell for hydrogen production. By employing the density functional theory (DFT), the electron density, projected density of states (PDOS), electron distribution and electron transfer path between [Fe–Fe] hydrogenase and the perovskite cathode can be obtained. Simulation results show that the perovskite cathode is better than traditional cathodes for hydrogen production. Before transmission to the [Fe–Fe] hydrogenase, electron clouds mainly aggregate at the periphery of amine molecules. Simulations also show that the key to hydrogen production at the perovskite structure lies in the organic molecules. Electrons are transferred to the hydrocarbon structural chain before reaching the Fe atoms. The Rice, Ramsperger, Kassel and Marcus (RRKM) theory was used to predict the reaction rates at different temperatures. It was found that the reaction rates are in good agreement with the experimental results. This research provides more physical insight into the electron transfer mechanism during the hydrogen production process.
Introduction
Hydrogen production and hydrogen storage have become increasingly important as hydrogen is considered to be a prospective green energy carrier. Hydrogen can be produced through various methods, such as traditional steam reforming from hydrocarbons, electrolysis and thermolysis. The method used in this research utilizes hydrogenase, which serves as a hydrogen-producing enzyme that carries out redox reactions in organisms. In recent years, hydrogenase catalytic reaction related studies have increased in number.1–6 In photoelectrochemical cell applications, hydrogenase can serve as the key catalyst for producing hydrogen.
Hydrogenase plays the role of a core enzyme in the reactions of microorganisms.7,8 The enzyme can be categorized into [FeFe] hydrogenase and [NiFe] hydrogenase as shown in Fig. 1, according to the difference in the core metal atoms.9–11 In particular, the so-called H-cluster is the active site of the [FeFe] hydrogenase, which is composed of a standard [Fe4S4] cluster or alternative [Fe2(CO)3(CN)2].12 The core of the [FeFe] hydrogenase is the Fe atom, which activates the reduction reactions. Fe atoms can be divided into Fe proximal (Fep) and Fe distal (Fed), and the latter determines the electron transport path. Peters et al.13,14 and Nicolet et al.15–18 obtained a similar mechanism of proton transfer and electron transport from the related protein structure. Many research teams have used density functional theory (DFT) to study both [FeFe] hydrogenase and [NiFe] hydrogenase,19–32 mainly focusing on infrared frequencies and experimental data comparison. The main focus of this study is on the simulation of electron transfer and computation of reaction rate at the H-cluster of the [FeFe] hydrogenase for hydrogen production.

The mineralogist Perovskite was the first person who found ABX3 (A and B are cations while X represents halogen or oxygen; e.g., CaTiO3) with characterized crystal structures. Park33 used CH3NH3PbX3 as the sensitizer of a dye sensitizer solar cell and achieved a higher efficiency of 14%. The electrical activity and crystal structures of perovskites are extremely relevant. For example, when the ratio of halogen in the structure is adjusted, the energy gap varies in the range from 1.2 eV to 2.3 eV, and the structure also changes from tetragonal into cubic. Kojima et al. used CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoparticles as the light sensitizer to obtain 3.1% power conversion efficiency (PCE).33 Experiments also showed that MASnI3 (MA = CH3NH3, methylammonium group) and CsSnI3 are ideal hole transporters, while MAPb (I1−xClx)3 and MAPbI3 can facilitate rapid electron and hole transportation.34,35 This study explores the electron conductivity and electron orbital related properties between the H-cluster and the perovskite, which have not been discussed or studied before. Additionally, electron transport rates were also calculated based on the Rice, Ramsperger, Kassel and Marcus (RRKM) theory.
Computational methods
Density functional calculations on molecules (DMol3)36 were used to set up structures of the perovskite cathode and the H-cluster of the [Fe–Fe] hydrogenase. A minimum unit cell of a = 6.289 Å, b = 6.23 Å, c = 6.374 Å was found. Each unit cell includes two MA organic molecules, one iodine atom, one Sn (or Pb) atom, and two halogens. The electronic properties of the perovskite cathode, such as energy gap and energy levels, undergo optimization through the use of optimization task of the module. Due to the fact that the perovskite structure is periodical, we employed the exchange–correlation functional GGA/BLYP in the structure optimization. We preset the K point as 4 × 4 × 4, cutoff energy as 240 eV, and convergent condition to be within 10−5. Considering the delocalized electrons between the minimal H-cluster/perovskite interfaces, we used the meta-hybrid GGA M06-L functional37 to address the spurious charge transfer processes that may be induced by the very large delocalization of electronic states in the perovskite bulk caused by the self-interaction error of standard GGA approximations. In order to analyze the 20 energy levels above and below the energy gap, the exchange–correlation functional GGA/BLYP method was adopted again. The projected density of states (PDOS) diagrams and the energy levels of the minimal H-cluster/perovskite model were compared with the B3LYP/PBE0 calculations (shown in the ESI†). The differences with the GGA results are minimal, and the results from the gas phase cluster are different from those in the actual system.
Different spin states of the model H-cluster have been set and calculated. It turned out that the doublet state (the system had odd number of electrons) was the most stable state; any higher spin state or antiferromagnetic state was not as stable. At the doublet ground state, the oxidation states of the two Fe were both Fe(II); however, the Mulliken charges were less than +1, and the spin density of Fep was ∼1 while that of Fed was nearly 0. This low-spin situation could be explained by the crystal field theory: the Fe centers were 6-coordinated with strong-field ligands such as CN− and CO, and hence a large d-orbital splitting and the low-spin state resulted.
The VariFlex program was employed to estimate the reaction rate constants. This program employs the flexible transition state theory (FTST) with variable reaction coordinate (VRC) to carry out the reaction rate calculation. All the stationary points have been identified for local minima and transition states through vibrational analysis, of which the various chemical molecule frequencies are obtained through the DMol3 module. Zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections are obtained from the basis energy through optimized calculations. In order to obtain more accurate reaction rates, energies and frequencies of the H-cluster and H3O+ undergo optimization calculation. The results were in good agreement with those from the Gaussian09 program using B3LYP/6-311+G (2p). The data are then supplied to the VariFlex program for computing the rate constant.
The classical Langevin reaction rate constant, KL, is calculated by means of simple collisions between reactants as below: (1)where α represents the polarizability of the neutral, e stands for the elementary charge, and μ indicates the reduced mass of the ion–neutral pair. We used the RRKM theory for computation of rate constants of individual reaction steps.38 The rate constant k(E*) at an internal energy E* for a unimolecular reaction  can be expressed as: (2)where h is the Planck constant,  denotes the total number of states for the transition state (activated complex) A‡ with a barrier , ρ(E*) represents the density of states of the energized reactant molecule A*, and P is the product or products. It should be noted that we used the harmonic approximation to calculate the total number and density of states.
Results and discussion
Electron density of the H-cluster
The reaction center is the H-cluster molecule, which is surrounded by a large number of amino acid residues. Many important hydrogen production reactions, electron transport, and energy transfer take place in H-cluster molecules. The initial model of the H-cluster constructed and optimized by DMol3 is as shown in Fig. 2. The reaction key lies in the methyl group and the two Fe atoms, namely, Fed and Fep, in the molecules as mentioned in the literature. (This molecular structure is simplified in that the long carbon chain is shortened, with only one CH3 structure remaining39 and the central part also omits the diamond structure [Fe4S4].40 The original structure is shown in Fig. 1(b).) Fig. 2 shows the original diamond structure of the H-cluster molecule [Fe4S4] with a hydrocarbon chain (indicated by the red circle in (a)). The optimized structure of the H-cluster is shown in Fig. 2(b), in which the red circle indicates the key Fe atom (i.e., Fe distal), and the green circle indicates the remaining CH3 structure.

Hydrogen production occurs through the interaction between the hydronium ion (H3O+) and the H-cluster. Electron density calculation results show that electrons cover the H-cluster and partially cover the hydronium ion, as shown in Fig. 3. The uncovered proton (of H3O+) is not involved in the chemical reaction. This is due to the fact that only one of the hydrogen atoms in the hydronium ion bonds with Fed, then water is produced and it slowly drifts away.

Electron density and projected density of states (PDOS)
The oscillator strength analysis using GaussSum shows that the H-cluster electrons transfer from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital LUMO+8 energy level. This brings electrons from the external carbon chain to the reaction center Fed, as shown in Fig. 4, in which the yellow and blue clouds indicate the orbitals with spin up and spin down, respectively. The carbon chain is generally attached to the cathode in a photoelectrochemical cell.

In order to study the electron distribution between the H-cluster and H3O, PDOS diagrams were drawn as shown in Fig. 5a. This figure shows that the electrons occupy the s, p and d orbitals, in which the known electron configuration of the H atom is 1s1. Fig. 5b can be cross-matched with Fig. 5a and it reveals that the s orbital (blue) is occupied mainly by the electrons from H atoms, the p orbital (red) is filled mainly by the electrons of sulfur from the H-cluster, and the d orbital (green) is occupied mainly by the electrons of the two Fe-atoms of the H-cluster. Fig. 5c and d show the PDOS of the electrons from the core Fe atom and the hydrogen atom of H3O. The distribution is mainly between 1 eV and −12 eV, while the H system is distributed between −1 eV and −3 eV, and −11 eV and −24 eV, respectively. Fig. 5c shows that the main orbital is the d orbital (green), distributed between 1 eV and −4 eV. The figures of the electron orbital distribution from the key reaction atoms were analyzed to investigate the electron transfer mechanism. In summary, the electron transport mainly starts from the d orbital of the Fe atom to the s orbital of the H atom in the hydronium H3O.

Perovskite cathode
This paper intends to study the hydrogen production reaction of a H-cluster and associate it with the actual cathode of a photoelectrochemical cell. The chosen cathode has a perovskite structure that is commonly used in many research studies. The perovskite structure possesses a direct energy gap and better light absorption. From a study on the performance of hydrogen production, the cell achieved 12.3% efficiency and 1 V open circuit voltage.41 Additionally, complemented by simple electrolysis, water is electrolyzed in the anode and cathode. This paper, as part of our continued interest in this field, adopts a similar anode and cathode structure in place of halogen. Density functional theory is applied to calculate the key hydrogen production reactions on the nanoscale. Most of the general simulations and experiments used Pb and Sn as the central structure. The chemical composition is expressed as MAPbI2X and MASnI2X, where X is the halogen atom, and Br and Cl are used in this study. The model structures of MAPbI2X are shown in Fig. 6. Due to its structural periodicity and to reduce excessive calculations, the minimum unit cell was adopted for the model construction. The atoms represented by different colors are indicated in Table 1. The MASnI2X model construction method is the same as that of MAPbI2X. Besides the central structure used, the only distinct difference between these 2 models is the replacement of halogen atoms as seen in Fig. 6.

In general, the energy level of water is −4.80 eV in vacuum. In order to ensure that hydrogen production takes place, the electron energy level in the cathode must exceed the energy level of water to transport electrons. Based on the calculations, it was found that the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB) energy level of MAPbI2X, as listed in Table 2, clearly exceeds the electron energy level of water, thereby proving its applicability in cathode structures. On the other hand, the perovskite structure with Sn as the center has an electron energy level lower than −4.80 eV. Therefore, it is more suitable to be used as an anode instead. From the calculations, the energy gap is between 1 and 2 eV. In general, the experimental energy gap of a perovskite structure is about 1.5 eV, which falls within the range of the energy gap calculated.

Electron transfer

Fig. 7 shows that the electrons in the HOMO mainly aggregated near the MA. From different occupied orbitals, electron jumping can be observed. Those electrons are mainly distributed on MA in the right bottom corner of the perovskite. It is speculated that the key to hydrogen production in the perovskite structure lies in the organic molecules. The H-cluster enzyme is where the catalytic reactions take place in different unoccupied molecular orbitals. While electrons have to be successfully transported to the H-cluster enzyme, the hydrocarbon chain of the H-cluster is also transferred to Fe atoms where the key reactions take place. It therefore proves that MAPbI2X can serve as an effective cathode for enzymes to produce hydrogen. During electron transport, it is worth noting that the electron distribution aggregates near the Fe atoms and electron jumping occurs near MA in HOMO. In LUMO+2 and related orbitals, electrons are often distributed near the CO chain, which can be detected from the orbital distribution of density of states. On the other hand, electrons near the MA displayed a jumping phenomenon in different regions of different occupied orbitals. This is possibly due to the electric dipole movement of MA as well as Pb and halogen electronegativity. This finding shall serve as a reference for future research.

PDOS of perovskite and H-cluster
The above studies on electron density distribution show that the electrons of the MAPbI2Br and H-cluster system are mainly transported from HOMO to LUMO+2. In order to study the electron distribution between the H-cluster and the perovskite, selective PDOS diagrams were sketched. The electron density distribution in HOMO is near the CH3 group in the H-cluster, as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore, the main electron density distribution of the CH3 group was selected to analyze its PDOS, as shown in Fig. 8. The electron configuration of N atoms is [He] 2s2 2p3. Hence, the PDOS is mainly composed of s and p orbitals, as shown in Fig. 8a. When electrons jump to LUMO+2, the electron cloud is concentrated near the Fe atom. It is mainly composed of d orbitals and distributed between 1 eV and −6 eV as seen in Fig. 8c. Comparing Fig. 8b and c, it is found that the main p orbital electrons jump to the d orbital of the Fe atom. The same analytical method is applied on MAPbI2Cl as well. Its PDOS diagram is also drawn based on the distribution of atoms as shown in Fig. 8d. Its distribution and structure are similar to those of MAPbI2Br, mainly composed of 2s and 2p orbitals. At the HOMO level, the electron cloud is also concentrated near the CH3 group. From Fig. 8f, it can be seen that the electron density is concentrated near the Fe atom, where the DOS diagram shows that the electrons occupy d orbitals and distribute between 2 eV and −6 eV. The current conclusion is that the electron transport between the perovskite and the H-cluster starts from the p orbital of the CH3 group to the d orbital of Fe.

Panels (d) to (f) feature the same system except that MAPbI2Cl replaces MAPbI2Br. It can be concluded that the electron transfer starts from the p orbital of CH3 to the d orbital of Fe. 
Energy level diagram
The energy levels of the perovskites, and the H-cluster and the water molecule are summarized and drawn in Fig. 9 to study the electron transport between one another. After the electrons from the photoelectrochemical cell reach the cathode, the energy levels of those electrons have to be high enough to successfully jump over to the H-cluster in order to complete the electron transfer. The H-cluster has to receive electrons to successfully accept hydrogen atoms of hydronium ions and then form bonds to complete the subsequent hydrogen reactions. The experimental value of the energy level of H2/H2O is −4.80 eV, the HOMO value of the H-cluster is −4.30 eV, and the LUMO value is −4.13 eV. The electron energy level of a matching cathode material therefore has to be higher than −4.80 eV. The red square indicates the applicable cathode materials, which are MAPbI2Br and MAPbI2Cl.

Reaction rate constants
The key reaction in the hydrogen production process is shown in Fig. 10, which shows that the reaction is reversible, but with a strong bias towards hydrogen production, which means k−1 > k1. The reaction rate constant calculated using the Langevin rate equation [eqn (1)] is 6.61 × 10−9 cm3 s−1 mol−1. Compared to chemical reactions similar to those stated in the literature, the rate constant falls at the same level. The reaction rate constants calculated using the RRKM theory [eqn (2)] are listed in Table 3. Note that the frequencies and energy levels are calculated by DMol3/GGA/BLYP. The calculated frequencies of the hydronium ion and the H-cluster are shown in Table 4. The results calculated by Gaussian09 at the B3LYP/6-31+G level of theory are also displayed in Table 4. The program setting of the environment pressure is 1 × 10−8 Torr. Assuming that the calculation environment is near vacuum and that hydronium ions are abundantly found in the environment, the reaction rate constant changes at three different temperatures from 300 to 350 K. The reaction rate constant decreases with increasing temperature, which indicates that there is a possibility of a three state model in the transition path.

The reaction rate constant calculated using RRKM is lower than that obtained through the Langevin method. It can be verified that the results obtained using the classical method are overestimated. The reaction rate constants calculated in this paper were verified by the hydrogen production rate obtained by experiments.42 We assumed a second-order reaction to do the calculation that the experimental reaction rate constant is approximately 3.00 × 10−7 cm3 s−1 mol−1 after unit conversion. The experimental environment is at pH = 7 with an approximate volume of 10 cm3 under room temperature conditions. In our calculations, the model we used has only one hydronium ion and one H-cluster molecule, which has a great disparity with the realistic condition which considers molecule collisions. Although there is a limitation using the RRKM calculation in this study, the rate constant obtained is fairly in good agreement with the experimental results.
Conclusions
In this study, more in-depth research on perovskite cathodes for hydrogen production has been conducted. The results show that the electron transfer from HOMO to LUMO+8 takes place at the H-cluster which interacts with the hydronium ion. From the PDOS analysis, it is found that the electron density in the d orbital of the Fe is transported to the s orbital of the H atom. Perovskites MAPbI2Br and MAPbI2Cl are the applicable cathode materials. The VB and CB energy levels of these two perovskites are significantly higher than the electron energy level required for water reduction, i.e. −4.8 eV. Results show that the electrons of the MAPbI2Br and H-cluster system are mainly transported from the HOMO energy level to LUMO+2. The electrons of the MAPbI2Cl and H-cluster system are transported from the HOMO energy level to LUMO. During electron transport, it is worth noting that the electron transfer takes place near Fe atoms and electron jumping occurs near the MA. The PDOS analysis shows that the electrons mainly jump from the p orbital of the CH3 group to the d orbital of the Fe atom. Finally, the reaction rate constants of the H-cluster and H3O+ at different temperatures were calculated according to the RRKM theory. The reaction rate constant decreases with increasing temperature, which indicates that there might be a three state model in the transition path. The calculated rate constants were in good agreement with the experimental results.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Chemical composition and molecular structures of (a) [NiFe] hydrogenase and (b) [FeFe] hydrogenase.	 
	(1)
	(2)

 	Fig. 2  (a) The original diamond structure H-cluster molecule. (b) The optimized structure of the H-cluster used in this study.	 

 	Fig. 3  Electron density calculation results of the H-cluster and the hydronium ion. The red circle indicates that only one proton is not covered by the electron cloud. The other two may have the opportunity to bond with Fed.	 

 	Fig. 4  The major electron transfer from the Fe atom of the H-cluster to the hydronium ion when the system is excited from HOMO to LUMO+8.	 

 	Fig. 5  Projected density of states (PDOS) diagram of (a) H-cluster and H3O, (b) the H atoms of the whole system, (c) the key Fe atom, and (d) the hydrogen atom in H3O.	 

 	Fig. 6  The perovskite unit cell of (a) MAPbI2Br, (b) MAPbI2Cl, (c) MASnI2Br and (d) MASnI2Cl.

MAPbI2Cl	−1.743	0.093	1.836
MASnI2Br	−6.755	−5.855	0.900
MASnI2Cl	−6.782	−5.662	1.120
MASnI3	−6.925	−6.194	0.731

 	Fig. 7  The major path of electron transfer in the MAPbI2Br and H-cluster system.	 

 	Fig. 8  PDOS of (a) the MAPbI2Br and H-cluster system, (b) the main electron density distribution of the CH3 group, and (c) the key reaction centre of Fe atom in the H-cluster. Panels (d) to (f) feature the same system except that MAPbI2Cl replaces MAPbI2Br. It can be concluded that the electron transfer starts from the p orbital of CH3 to the d orbital of Fe.	 

 	Fig. 9  The energy levels of the perovskite, the H-cluster, and the water molecule. The red square indicates the applicable cathode materials.	 

 	Fig. 10  The key reaction in the hydrogen production process. The reaction is reversible, but with a strong bias towards hydrogen production, which means k−1 > k1.
