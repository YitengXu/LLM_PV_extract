1. Introduction
Nitrides, borides and carbides feature certain properties in common, such as high stability, high melting point, high mechanical strength, etc., which have aroused continuous and increasing research interest during the past decades owing to their potential applications as catalysis supports,1 thermionic electron sources,2 lithium ion rechargeable battery materials3 and so on. For example, nitrides including BN, GaN, Si3N4, the noble transition metal nitrides (OsN2, IrN2, PtN, RuN2, RhN2) have unique properties of high thermal and chemical stability, corrosion resistance and excellent mechanical properties, which may have potential applications in extended fields.4–10 Transition metal diborides MB2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) have the advantages of high melting point, high strength, and high chemical and thermodynamic stability, etc.11 The divalent alkaline-earth metal hexaborides (CaB6, SrB6 and BaB6) have potential applications in cathode materials and high temperature insulation and nuclear engineering.12 Furthermore, they have a controversial weak ferromagnetism and promising thermoelectric properties. LiMBO3 (M = Fe, Mn) have potential applications in lithium ion rechargeable battery; Carbides (including SiC, Mo2C, WC and NbC) have attracted much attention due to their useful properties, such as high thermal conductivity, prominent resistance towards oxidation, excellent mechanical strength, and good chemical inertness. Therefore, these carbides have applications in various fields such as biomaterials, semiconducting devices, light-weight/high-strength structures, and high-temperature-resistant materials.13,14
The nanoscale endows nitrides, borides and carbides with many novel or improved characteristic properties and functions, which enable their wider potential and practical application especially in catalysis, optics and energy related areas.15 It is widely known that the properties and reactivity of the nanomaterials are determined by their structures, especially their sizes and shapes. In addition, the synthesis method is believed to have vital effect on the final properties and applications of nanomaterials. Traditionally, various methods, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD),16 carbothermal reduction approach,17 and the autoclave route,18,107etc., have been successfully utilized for the general synthesis of nanoscale nitrides, borides and carbides. The reactions carried out via CVD or carbothermal reduction approaches are usually in a tube furnace under inert atmosphere at temperatures higher than 800 °C. These methods generally could obtain target materials with high crystallinity, high purity, and with less defects. The “autoclave route” is also one of the most effective methods for the low temperature and low cost synthesis of inorganic solid materials. Here, the “autoclave route” means that the target inorganic solid materials with controllable phases, dimensions and uniform shapes are fabricated within a stainless steel autoclave. The reagents (in the presence or absence of catalysts or solvents) in the autoclave tend to react with each other and yield the target sample through the designed chemical reactions along with the elevated and controlled temperature (the autoclave is tightly sealed and put into an electrical stove and the heating temperature in the majority of cases is below 600 °C) under the self-generated pressure within the autoclave. The “autoclave route” has many merits, for example: its reaction temperature is usually far below that of the traditional synthetic techniques; and it is a one-step process, which can dramatically reduce the negative effect of the toxic intermediate byproducts and simplify the manipulation processes. It should be emphasized that a wide range of inorganic nanometre scale materials including nitrides, borides, carbides, phosphides, chalcogenides, alloys, composites, etc. have been conveniently designed through the one-step “autoclave route”.
The synthesis, properties and applications of nanoscale nitrides, borides and carbides have drawn great scientific attention during the past decades due to their special properties and wide applications. In this feature article, recent development and breakthroughs on the synthesis, properties and applications of nanometre scale nitrides (BN, Si3N4, GaN, noble nitrides), borides (LnB6, LnB2, Fe3BO5, LiMBO3) and carbides (Carbon, SiC, TiC, NbC, WC) were briefly reviewed in sequence of their different dimensions (1D, 2D and 3D). In particular, our latest advances in the “autoclave route” fabrication of nanoscale nitrides, borides, and carbides were highlighted. For instance, a series of nitrides (TiN, ZrN, BN and AlN) have been prepared by using the corresponding elements (Ti, Zr, B, Al), NaN3 and sulfur in a stainless steel autoclave at 250 °C. Sulfur was used to facilitate the exothermic reaction between NaN3 and sulfur, and impelled the nitrides to form at a relatively low temperature. The nitride formation mechanism can be explained as a sulfur-assisted synthesis process (SAS).19 The modified method has presently been extended to synthesize a series of nanoscale nitrides, borides, and carbides through tuning the experimental parameters. A series of rare-earth hexaborides (RB6) and alkaline earth hexaborides (AB6) have been prepared via an Mg or I2 assisted “autoclave route” below 400 °C.20,21
Although much progress has been achieved, the low cost and high yield production of nanoscale nitrides, borides and carbides with well controlled dimensions, shapes, phases and adjustable properties still remains a great challenge. In the last section, the challenges, issues and perspectives of the synthetic methodologies, properties and potential applications concerning the above mentioned materials were also briefly discussed.
2. Nitrides
2.1 Boron nitride (BN)
As a synthetic material, BN has several well-defined crystallographic structures, such as cubic BN (c-BN), hexagonal BN (h-BN), rhombohedral BN (r-BN) and wurtzite BN (w-BN). Since the first synthesis of c-BN in 1957,22 the second hardest material was generated, and it soon achieved commercial application. Hexagonal BN was first reported in 1842; it is a structure analogy of layered graphite and has a wide bandgap energy. It has many special properties, such as low density, low conductivity, superb mechanical properties, high chemical stability, high melting point and high thermal conductivity, which have been widely used as an electrical insulator and heat resistant materials for decades. Recently, high quality h-BN crystal prepared at 2100 °C by using a nickel–molybdenum solvent was found to be a promising deep ultraviolet light emitter.23 Rhombohedral BN could be detected in the synthesis process of h-BN. It was reported that r-BN formed during conversion of c-BN into h-BN.24

2.1.1 One dimensional BN materials. 
1D boron nitride nanomaterials, such as nanotubes, nanoribbons, nanowires and nanofibers, have special electronic, mechanical and optical properties, which may be widely used in diversified fields.
2.1.1.1 BN Nanotubes (BNNTs). 
Hexagonal boron nitride nanotubes of high crystallinity and pure phase were first synthesized in 1995.25 Since then, the studies of this kind of special material have aroused great interest. Most well-established synthesis methods for production of carbon nanotubes, such as arc-discharge, ball-milling, substitution reactions, CVD and laser ablation, etc. are applicable for the production of BNNTs.26 Recently, a CVD method using boron powder and metal oxide as reactants at 1300 °C27 has been developed. It is a carbon-free method and can settle some problems which commonly exist in traditional methods, such as low yield and low purity. Straight BNNTs with a pure hexagonal phase (Fig. 1) have been produced by a one-step Co-pyrolysis method in a stainless steel autoclave around 450–600 °C.28,29 The majority of these BNNTs have at least one closed end and cone-like tips. Furthermore, the metal powders were demonstrated to play a quasi-catalytic function and they were significant in promoting the yield of BNNTs.28 Hexagonal-BN nanocages were found to coexist with the BNNTs. Utilizing synergic boron and/or nitrogen sources not only can efficiently reduce the reaction temperature and simplify experimental processes or equipment, but also can obtain high yield and high purity BNNTs. BN nanotubes possess excellent mechanical and thermal properties, high oxidation resistivity, and chemical inertness30 as well as molecular interactions and electronic defects,31 which make them promising materials as nanotube-based electronic devices, hydrogen storage materials, catalyst supports or composite materials under harsh conditions.32 In addition, atoms or functional groups could be doped or adsorbed on BNNTs, which would change the structures and properties of BNNTs and endow BNNTs with new applications. It was revealed that hydroxyl groups could be bonded to the B sites of BNNTs and the –NH groups were affiliated with N sites after that BNNTs were treated with hydrogen peroxide. These BNNTs were active and could be combined with polymers, which dramatically improved the mechanical properties of polymer film.33 Recently, Wang et al. synthesized novel B–C–N/BN coaxial nanotubes on a large scale via a carboxylate-functionalized BNNTs method, and the p-type semiconducting behaviors were elucidated by gate-dependent transport measurements.34 Though the production of large scale BNNTs has been achieved, to our knowledge, the synthesis of pure and defect-free BN nanotubes with homogeneous structure and the functionalization and practical application of BN nanotubes still remain significant challenges.

2.1.1.2 BN nanoribbons. 
As an excellent component in electric circuits and devices, BN nanoribbons have drawn extensive attention.35 Compared with BN nanotubes, there are much less reports on BN nanoribbons. Recently, hollow hexagonal BN nanoribbons were prepared using B–N–O–Fe as precursors by a simple hexagonal ZnS nanoribbon templating method. These products exhibit an extraordinary ultraviolet CL emission at 5.33 eV, such a property is believed by the authors to be highly advantageous for optoelectronic applications. This templating approach could also be extended to synthesize other hollow nanostructures such as boron carbonitride.36


2.1.2 Two dimensional BN materials. 
2D nanoscale BN materials are usually utilized as matrixes due to their smooth sheets and plates. The sizes and morphologies of these sheets and plates could be controllably synthesized via many methods. Nanosheets, nanoplates and nanomeshes are very common structures of 2D BN nanomaterials, which can be easily prepared via the “autoclave route”.
2.1.2.1 BN nanosheets (BNNSs). 
Various methods have been used to synthesize BN nanosheets, such as solution method,37,38 ultrasonication39 and pyrolysis decomposition.40 Coleman et al. produced layered BNNSs via liquid exfoliation method.38 Electron-beam-induced substitutional carbon doping of BNNSs were also reported.41 Linear assembles of BNNSs could be fabricated in a polysiloxane/BN nanosheet composite film under a high DC electric field.42 Li et al. prepared the BNNSs and investigated their mechanical properties. It was found that one of their bending modulus was depended on their thicknesses. It was also found that BNNSs were quite useful for reinforcing the strength of polymeric films by only using 0.3 wt% of BN nanosheets incorporated with the polymer.43 Ultrathin BN nanosheets (Fig. 2) with high specific surface area (226 m2 g−1) and with an average thickness of 4 nm were conveniently synthesized on the gram scale utilizing B2O3, N2H4·2HCl and Zn powders in a sealed autoclave at 500 °C by our group. Furthermore, monodispersed Pt and Au nanoparticles with mean diameters of about 4.0 and 3.3 nm were successfully loaded on the surfaces of BNNSs, and the composites performed optimal full conversion of carbon monoxide at 135 °C.40

2.1.2.2 BN nanoplates (BNNPs). 
BN nanoplates possess excellent electronic and optical properties, which may be potentially applied in thermoelectric, nanoelectronics and optoelectronic devices.44,45 BNNPs have applications in many fields, for example, triangular BNNPs have been demonstrated to be excellent luminescent materials.46 BNNPs can also effectively reinforce the strength of composites and the elastic modulus.47 In addition, the computational results showed that h-BNNPs could be used in the field of hydrogen storage and nanoscale electronics.48
The r-BN triangular nanoplates have been fabricated by using NaNH2 and NH4BF4 in the presence of a nickel sponge in an autoclave at 600 °C for 16 h. The r-BN triangular nanoplates with 100–300 nm wide and about 20 nm thick have a uniform structure free of planar defects (Fig. 3A). The metal Ni, which acted as catalyst, promoted the formation of BN triangular nanoplates. These BN nanoplates with a regular triangular shape and a band gap of 5.7 eV suggested that they could be used in nanoelectronics and photonics. It was found that r-BN triangular nanoplates could largely transform into uniform r-BN hexagonal ones (Fig. 3D) after thermal calcinations at 1000 °C for 8 h in flowing nitrogen. These r-BN hexagonal nanoplates might be used as promising materials for deep-blue and UV applications.49 R-BN triangular nanoplates (300–500 nm length and about 50–90 nm thick) with high crystallinity could also be fabricated via a facile chemical route without using any templates or catalysts at 600 °C for 6 h in a stainless steel autoclave. These r-BN samples had excellent anti-oxidation property and thermal stability, which made them useful as high temperature devices. Furthermore, the results of PL measurements revealed that the r-BN samples showed strong yellow–green emission. Those exhibiting excellent luminescence indicated that they could act as good candidates for research in optoelectronic and optical devices.50 Utilizing proper and common reactants, regular BNNPs with uniform sizes and morphologies could be controllably synthesized in a sealed autoclave. In addition, the thermally induced shape transformations from triangular nanoplates to hexagonal nanoplates were easily achieved via a calcination process. Further researches should focus on discovering new routes to fabricate pure and large scale BN nanoplates and their application in new fields.

2.1.2.3 BN nanomeshes (BNNMs) and BN micromeshes (BNMMs). 
BN meshes have unique structure and properties, such as the uniform pore size, which may act as an interesting substrate for potential technological applications. Crystalline and pure boron nitride nanomeshes with pore sizes of several nanometres were first synthesized in 2004 by using a self-assembly process on a Rh (111) single crystalline surface in case of lattice mismatch.51 The new BN model, which consists of a single and complete layer, has aroused extensive researches up to date. Since then, BN nanomeshes have been successfully synthesized on noble metallic surfaces, such as Ru, Ni, Pd and so forth.52–55 The applications of BN nanomeshes are still underway. It has been presented that the edges of the pores form strong confining potentials for trapping molecules well, such as Cu-phthalocyanine molecules and Xe molecules, which could act as highly selective catalysts and functional surfaces. BNNMs could also act as an oxygen- and carbon-free template for the synthesis of nanocatalysts and nanomagnets.52 Moreover, Berner and Goriachko et al. reported that BNNMs could be used as a template for the uniform dispersion Au nanoparticles.53 Recently, micro-sized BN meshes and mesh-like BN materials were synthesized in 2009 via an autoclave route.54 BN micromeshes (BNMMs) with diameters of up to 100 nm, thickness of 210 nm and pore size of 2.8 nm on average were obtained by using B2O3, NaN3 and Mg powders as reactants (Fig. 4 and 5). Their formation was due to the in situ produced MgO template and oriented aggregation mechanism. When B2O3 was replaced by H3BO3, Na2B4O7, NH4HB4O7 or Mg(BO2)2·H2O, h-BNMMs with different sizes could also be produced. Therefore, the “autoclave route” is a general way for the controlled preparation of BNMMs.55 BN nanomeshes have advantages of large and smooth areas, can form uniform pore sizes and structure, which are superior in supplying regular templates for composite fabrication, such as loading and functionalization of the noble metals or transition metal oxides.

2.1.3 Three dimensional BN materials. 
Three dimensional BN nanomaterials have been studied for decades. The main researches about 3D BN materials have been focused on the synthesis of hollow structures, composites and their applications.
2.1.3.1 Hollow BN nanospheres (BNNSs). 
Owing to their unique properties of a large specific surface area and light weight, inorganic materials with hollow structures have potential applications in a series of technology and engineering fields.56–58 Novel BN hollow microspheres with open mouths were synthesized and exhibited intense cathodoluminescence emissions in the region of 200–400 nm, indicating that they could be potentially used as compact ultraviolet laser emitters.59 Very recently, hollow BN nano-polyhedrons have been successfully prepared by annealing BN nanoparticles in N2 at 1800 °C without catalyst.60 BN hollow spheres and nanotubes could be produced by using NaBF4 and NaN3 in autoclaves at 300 °C for 20 h.61 The higher the reaction temperature, the higher the yields of BN hollow spheres and nanotubes that can be obtained, and the optional temperature of the highest proportions was 450 °C. The obtained products had a specific surface area of 89.79 m2 g−1. Moreover, controllable synthesis of vessel, hollow sphere, onion and peanut nanostructures of h-BN were also investigated by using synergic nitrogen sources.62 Though the synthesis methods of hollow BN spheres are multifarious, finding a convenient route to produce hollow BN nanospheres with high purity and high yield is still a challenge at present.
2.1.3.2 Hollow BN submicro-boxes (BNMB) and nanocages. 
Hollow BN nanomaterials have aroused interest due to their structures and binding energies, which allow them to be implemented as novel material for drug delivery applications and natural gas storage.63,64 Nanocages and boxes belong to the important category of hollow structures. Compared with other box-like materials, such as Au, Pt, SnO2, HZSM-5 and CaTiO3,65–71 h-BN boxes may be an ideal candidate for functional materials. For example, their properties of superb thermal stability and oxidation resistance can make them suitable for protective shields for materials, or for building skeletons to devices. Their advantages of large surface area, light weight and economic price enable them to act as carriers for functional species and catalyst supports. Zhang et al. presented that BN nanocages could be synthesized by nitrogenation of amorphous boron at 800 °C under N2/NH3 atmosphere.72,73 Very recently, BN hollow spheres with ultra thin shells (1–3 nm) have been synthesized via a sulfur-assisted route using NH4BF4 and NaN3 as raw reactants at 320 °C for 20 h in a stainless steel autoclave, which show a hydrogen uptake capacity of up to 4.07 wt% at 298 K and 10 MPa, indicating their promising role as candidates for energy storage and wastewater treatment.74 High yield hexagonal BN submicro-boxes (BNMB) have been fabricated by using KBH4, NH4F and Zn as reactants via an autoclave route at 450 °C (Fig. 6).75 It was considered that in situ formed intermediate (KZnF3) cubes may serve as templates for the BNMB formation. The composites of SnO2 and BNMB (defined as SnO2/BNMB) have the highest photocatalytic activity (∼92% within 30 min) towards the photodegradation of methyl orange solution when compared with the traditional photocatalysts (Fig. 7).75 The scaled fabrication of hollow BN nanocages under mild conditions and their application are presently less explored, and need further deep investigation.

2.1.4 Other BN structures. 
Other macroporous BN materials with high specific surface area of 230 m2 g−1 and high porosity of 85.6% were synthesized in the presence of sulfur powders via an autoclave route. The contrast experiments displayed that the textural and other properties of as-prepared BN were improved by the auxiliary effect of S powders.76 Different phases, sizes and morphologies of BN materials could be fabricated via an autoclave route, especially the cubic BN particles. It was reported that the cubic BN particles coexisting with minor h-BN particles could be obtained by using BBr3, NH4Br and metallic Na in the temperature range of 500–600 °C.77

2.2 BN related composites
The traditional methods for the synthesis of carbon doped boron nitride (BCN) are ball-milling, pyrolysis, arc-discharge,78 CVD, and laser ablation, etc. The BCN nanomaterials have unique advantages, such as more excellent mechanical and electronic properties and higher anti-oxidation than carbon materials.79,80 The BCN composites may be used as natural gas storage materials. For example, carbon doped boron nitride cages may be a competitive candidates for hydrogen storage materials, they can achieve a high hydrogen storage amount of 7.43 wt%, and dehydrogenations of BCN hydrides are used as hydrogen energy.81 Han et al. reported that controlled composition ratios of BN–carbon (BN–C) sheets could be assembled by using graphene sheets as the templates via a carbon-substitution reaction.82 BN–C nanoribbons were also observed coexistent with the sheets. Furthermore, the composites of single layer of carbon (graphene) and hexagonal BN have been pioneered by Oshima and Nagashima. The composites realized new properties due to their successful combination, which display not only the individual advantages of graphene and h-BN, but also prominent special properties, such as anisotropic elastic properties, good conductivity, higher melting point, higher strength and photoemission.83
The advantages of BN make it a potential and ideal candidate for catalyst support. There have been extensive researches that have focused on metal and boron nitride composites. Many noble metals and transitional metals which had many special properties could be loaded on the surface of BN nanomaterials, such as Au, Ag, Pt, Pt, Cu and Fe.84–89 The composites of metals combined with BN have been researched for decades. They could not only retain the unique properties of some metals, but also could maintain the advantages of BN. Thus, the composites were widely applied for gas adsorption and catalytic reactions. For example, novel yard-glass shaped BN nanotubes periodically filled with Fe nanoparticles were synthesized by a floating catalytic process of NH3 reacting with boron precursors at 1300 °C, which had excellent ferromagnetic properties and potential significant application in fabrication of nanoscaled electromagnetic devices.85 In addition, the composites of 3.3 nm Au functionalized with BN nanosheets were obtained, and they performed with good catalytic activity towards CO (about 40%) around 80 °C, at the same time, BN supported Pt composites were also prepared and tested for the transformation of CO to CO2. It is established that the greater the amount of Pt nanoparticles attached on BN nanosheets (16%), the lower full conversion temperature was required (around 135 °C) (Fig. 8). These catalysts also have excellent stability.34

(c) The catalytic performance of 1% Pt/BNNSs with different CO concentrations from 0.5% to 5.9% at a flow rate of 66.7 mL min−1 at 250 °C.

According to previous reports, BN nanomaterials can not only be combined with metals and non-metals, but also can be recombined with compounds. The composites of oxides (such as ZnO,90,91 Fe3O4,92etc.) and BN have been studied most frequently. BN nanotubes functionalized by oxides can be obtained through many methods, such as wet chemistry methods, ethanol–thermal processes,92 or sonication methods followed by a calcination treatment. As fluorine atoms could be adsorbed on graphene-like BN and ZnO single layer, the use of BN and ZnO single layer as interesting spintronics was explored. It was demonstrated that magnetic iron oxide had an effective arsenic removal ability.93 The nanocomposite, which combined the advantages of both BN and iron oxides is believed to be able to remove the arsenic from water solutions and is beneficial for the environment; Postole et al. reported that boron nitride supported metal oxide (In2O3, Ga2O3 and SnO2) nanocomposites prepared via a sol–gel method could be utilized as catalysts for selective reduction of NO by C2H4 in high oxygen atmosphere, illuminating BN as an ideal support material for assisting these oxides in a NOx reduction reaction mechanism.94
Besides the oxides, other compounds, such as sulphides,95 silicon carbide,96 and polymer compounds,97 were also successfully doped on BN materials. For example, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)–BN nanotube composites were fabricated by using a solution method. It was proved that the elastic modulus of PMMA was improved up to 19% when using only a 1 wt% BNNTs loading fraction. It was also found that the thermal expansion of a PMMA film would be dramatically reduced after loading BNNTs. Many researches and studies demonstrated that BN material was a promising candidate for forming interesting and useful composites with a lot of other materials, which could be widely applied in various engineering and industries.
Since the first synthesis of boron nitride, the related researches and studies have been never-ending. Table 1 shows some composites of boron nitride related materials and their potential applications. Nowadays, boron nitride as an excellent template has aroused great attention. It is believed that many new kinds of composites with expected amazing novel properties based on BN could be designed in the near future by using appropriate precursors, substrates or templates.

2.3 Gallium nitride (GaN)
Gallium nitride is another important III–V compound. It also has a wide band gap and high chemical inertness, which can be used in optoelectronics and high-power devices.11 GaN nanostructures have been fabricated via different methods, such as laser-induced growth,101 catalyst-assisted syntheses,102 direct reaction of Ga and NH3 gas, pyrolysis,103 and CVD methods.104 Traditionally, the temperature used to prepare GaN was in the range of 600–1100 °C.105 Yang et al. prepared single-crystal GaN nanotubes via an epitaxial casting CVD approach using ZnO nanowires as templates.106 Nanocrystalline GaN of mainly hexagonal phase coexisting with a small fraction of rocksalt phase was synthesized via a benzene-thermal synthetic route in an autoclave at 280 °C.107 Using a similar synthetic route, pure metastable rocksalt GaN was first prepared through the reaction of GaI3 and NaNH2 at 210 °C under 3 MPa pressure.108 Moreover, cubic GaN nanoparticles and nanorods were successfully fabricated from the nitridation of nanocrystalline GaP in nitrogen at 500 °C for 30 min.109 Simplifying the reaction devices or process and promoting the production of GaN nanomaterials with high purity, high orientability and high yield at mild temperature are still imperative targets for researchers to pursue.
2.4 Silicon nitride (Si3N4)
Si3N4 has favorable properties, such as high mechanical properties, thermal and chemical stability, wear resistance and corrosion resistance, which can be used in microelectronic/optic devices in radiation environments and at high temperatures.12 Compared with one-dimensional nanoscale building blocks, Si3N4 nanowires were proved to have a much higher bending strength than the bulk, which had potential applications in fabricating nanoscale electronic devices.110 The two hexagonal structures of α-Si3N4 and β-Si3N4 were respectively synthesized.111,112 Traditionally, Si3N4 powder was prepared via various methods, such as carbon thermal reduction,113 thermal de-composition of polyureasilazane,114 combustion synthesis,115 and so on. The reaction temperature of these methods is in the range of 1100–1700 °C.
Single-crystalline α-Si3N4 nanowires, with a preferred [001] growth direction, were fabricated on a large scale by using Mg3N2 and SiCl4 as reactants at 600 °C. Si3N4 nanowires or nanorods were obtained from SiCl4, NaN3, and metallic Mg at the temperature of 200–300 °C. α-Si3N4 and β-Si3N4 could be controllably synthesized by using different metals.116,117 Furthermore, α-Si3N4 nanorods could also be fabricated by using NaNH2 as the nitrogen source at 700 °C in an autoclave.118 It is interestingly reported by An et al. that the shape evolution of the un-stable shaped Si3N4 nanowires could gradually transform into nanobelts due to the affection of surface energy.119 In addition, Si3N4 nanomaterials with different phases and structures could be selectively prepared at rather low temperature (60–190 °C) in autoclaves by the assistance of different additives, such as N-aminothiourea, I2 or both of them.
2.5 Some transition metal nitrides
Other important metal nitrides, such as NbN, VN,120 CrN,121 TiN122 and AlN,123 could also be synthesized via various methods. They all have special advantages and have widely been used in diversified areas, such as electroanalysis devices, light and field-emitting devices, high temperature structure ceramics, high rate electrochemical capacitors and so forth.124–126 The successful synthesis of the nitrides of Os, Ir and Pt have broken the limited thoughts of none-forming of the transition metal nitrides.13,15,16 Nanoscale PtN and IrN were first synthesized by laser heating the relevant materials under high pressure in a diamond anvil cell.13 In summary, under the assistance of metals, sulfur, I2 or other materials, various nitrides could be synthesized by using the corresponding metal or non-metal materials and various nitrogen sources in a sealed autoclave at a relatively low temperature. The “autoclave route” is believed to be an economic and efficient method, which can be extended to synthesize many other interesting nanoscale nitride materials with ultra-high bulk modulus, super high strength and durability properties and multiple applications in optical, electronic and magnetic devices.13,127
3. Borides and borates
3.1 Hexaborides
Rare-earth hexaborides (RB6) and alkaline earth hexaborides (AB6) have structure similarity with CsCl, and also have the features of high melting point, high strength, high chemical and thermodynamic stability.128 LaB6 single crystals have been widely used as thermionic electron sources in the devices field due to their low work function (∼2.6 eV).129 The divalent alkaline-earth metal hexaborides (CaB6, SrB6 and BaB6) have potential application in cathode materials and high temperature insulation and nuclear engineering.130 Furthermore, they have controversial weak ferromagnetism, promising thermoelectric properties, and so forth.131
According to the Fowler–Nordheim equation,132 RB6 with elongated geometry and sharp tips or edges can possess higher emission current and brightness.133 Therefore, 1D RB6 materials have drawn much attention. Single crystalline LaB6 nanowires were synthesized in a tube furnace operated at 1150 °C on a silicon substrate.129 Qin et al. prepared single crystalline LaB6 and CeB6 nanowires via the CVD process.134 Zhao et al. prepared LaB6 nanowires and nanotubes by using BCl3 and La as raw materials, meanwhile, the La powders acted as catalyst.135 Single-crystal CaB6 nanowires with a preferred [001] growth direction were prepared by Xu et al. (Fig. 9). The nanowires with diameters of 15–40 nm, and lengths of 1–10 um were composed of CaB6 cores and thin (1–2 nm) amorphous oxide shell materials.137 The SrB6 nanowires with 20–100 nm in diameters and 2–5 μm in lengths were also fabricated. The BaB6 nanostructures have a rectangular cross section (width 20–300 nm) and are 5–20 μm in length. One-dimensional alkaline-earth metal hexaborides (MB6, M = Sr, Ba) have also been achieved in a low pressure CVD system at 840–870 °C.138

The “autoclave route” is also an effective method to prepare RB6. A general route was used to prepare the single crystalline cube-like RB6 (R = La, Ce, Pr, Sm, Eu, Nd) and AB6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba). The rare-earth oxides and H3BO3 were co-reduced with the assistance of Mg powder and I2 at 170–350 °C. Single crystalline hollow CaB6 particles were obtained at 400 °C by using CaCO3 as calcium source.21 RB6 (R = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) nanocubes were synthesized at 500 °C starting from B2O3, RCl3 and Mg powder in an autoclave. RB6 nanoparticles could be synthesized around 400 °C by using NaBH4 as boron resource.22 RB6 (R = Sm, Eu, Gd, and Tb) submicron cubes and SmB6 submicron rods (Fig. 10) were also fabricated by a similar method.139Table 2 shows some works on RB6 prepared via CVD and the autoclave route.

3.2 Ferroferriborate (Fe3BO5)
Ferroferriborate (Fe3BO5) possesses several interesting properties, such as catalytic oxidation of methanol and ethyl acetate,142 paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition at 114 K and a charge ordering crossover at about 220 K.143 Bulk Fe3BO5 have been fabricated via solid state reaction in 823–1120 °C.144,145 Nanoscale Fe3BO5 materials have been rarely reported. The magnetic measurement of single-crystal plywood-like Fe3BO5 nanorods showed their paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition temperature of 140 K.146 The Fe3BO5 and Fe3BO5/SiO2 materials were fabricated by using iron acetylacetonate and t-butylamine borane as raw materials and oleic acid and oleylamine as solvents (Fig. 11). The Fe3BO5/SiO2 nanorods can endure high temperature treatment.147 Urchin-like Fe3BO5@carbon core–shell nanostructure materials with high yield were prepared starting from ferrocene and H3BO3 in a stainless steel autoclave. The composites that composed of Fe3BO5@carbon cables (Fig. 12) have magnetic and catalytic properties.148 Hollow urchin-like carbon materials obtained after acid treatment can be used as templates to prepare materials with analogous features.

3.3 LiMBO3 (M = Fe, Mn)
LiMBO3 (M = Fe, Mn) materials have attracted interesting attention owing to their excellent properties and potential application in lithium ion rechargeable batteries. As polyanionic structure compounds, the LiMBO3 materials possess a high theoretical capacity (220–222 mA h g−1) and suffer a lesser volume change during the charge–discharge progress (Table 3). Furthermore, BO33− can reduce transition metal redox energies through the inductive effect and allow some tuning of such energies. Compared with cobalt, Fe and Mn elements are cheaper and less toxic. In addition, LiMBO3 shows an appropriate voltage stage. Therefore, much more efforts have been recently devoted to the LiMnBO3 and LiFeBO3 materials.

The Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple locates at 3.1–2.9 V per Li, demonstrating that the BO33− group has an obvious inductive effect. The electronic conductivity of LiFeBO3 is about 3.9 × 10−7 S cm−1.149 Legagneur et al. first synthesized LiFeBO3 by starting from Fe2C2O4·2H2O and LiBO2 at 750 °C for 15 h, while only a very little reversible capacity (less than 0.04 Li per formula unit) was obtained in their experimental results.150 Afterwards, LiFeBO3 and C–LiFeBO3 were obtained at 650 °C, the initial discharge capacity of the C–LiFeBO3 material was 72% of the theoretical one at a current of 5 mA g−1.151 Recently, Yamada et al. prepared LiFeBO3/C by using Li2CO3, FeC2O4·2H2O, B2O3, Ketchen Black and vapor-grown carbon fiber as raw materials sintered at 600 °C in Ar, and had tested their discharge capacity. Fig. 13 shows the cycle stability of the materials.152 The crystal structure of LiFeBO3 consists of face-sharing LiO4 tetrahedral, edge-sharing trigonal FeO5 bipyramid and BO3 triangles. Its possible Li diffusion pathways are parallel to [001]. The as-obtained LiFeBO3/C performs high cycle stability and ca. 200 mAh g¬1 after 20 cycles (which remains the highest capacity record up to now). The detailed properties of LiFeBO3 and its composite materials (C–LiFeBO3 or LiFeBO3/C) are listed in Table 4.

LiMnBO3 has two polymorphs: a hexagonal and a monoclinic system. The latter m-LiMnBO3 can be prepared at a relatively low-temperature. Bondareva et al. firstly synthesized m-LiMnBO3 below 400 °C via hydrothermal progress in 1978.155 However, until 2011, Ceder et al. first reported the electrochemical performance of m-LiMnBO3/C, the carbon coating was realized via subsequent calcining of m-LiMnBO3 and sucrose at 500 °C.156 In 2010, h-LiMnBO3 had been prepared at 850 °C, its capacity only faded by 0.09% per cycle from the second cycle.157 The related properties of LiMnBO3 and LiMnBO3/C are listed in Table 5.

At present, the electrochemical properties of LiMBO3 materials were all tested at mild current densities and a wide voltage range. The LiMBO3 materials were prepared mostly in 500–850 °C for about 18–58 h via multi-step solid state reactions. Meanwhile, the reactions also needed to be conducted in a protective atmosphere. Furthermore, the morphology of the as-obtained samples was particulate without regular shapes, which was interpreted that the relative high reaction temperature and long reaction time impelled the particles to aggregate and become larger.
In order to solve these problems, several strategies have been utilized presently. (1) In situ carbon coating and metal doping have been considered as two effective methods in improving the electroconductibility of the electrode materials. In particular, in situ carbon coating via organic matter decomposition can not only dramatically reduce the phenomenon of the aggregation and oxygenation of the final products, but also can reduce the experimental procedures. More important, it can improve the electronic conductivity and their cycling stabilities of the materials.158–160 Our present results on one-step synthesis of the LiMBO3/C also confirmed this point. (2) Traditional preparation methods, such as sol–gel methods and hydrothermal or solvothermal processes in autoclaves are expected to be used to prepare these materials. In addition, micro–nano technology combined with doping is also one of the most effective strategies.
4. Carbides
4.1 Carbon
Carbon is one of the most interesting elements in the Periodic Table. It has many forms, such as diamond, graphite, fullerenes, nanotubes, graphene and so on. Many synthesis strategies have been developed to fabricate nanometre-scale composites with different dimensions.
Bamboo-shaped carbon nanotubes have been prepared in a large scale through an ethanol thermal reduction process in an autoclave at 600 °C. The co-existent Y-junction carbon nanotubes can be used as the building blocks of nanoelectronics.161 Bamboo-shaped Fe3O4 particles embedded in carbon microtube core–shell composites with ferromagnetic properties were in situ produced by solvothermal pyrolysis of ferrocene and glycerol in a 20 mL stainless steel autoclave at 600 °C.162 Monodispersed Fe3O4 nanoplates between two carbon films were synthesized by pyrolyzing ferrocene and Na2C2O4 in an autoclave at 600 °C (Fig. 14).163 Bamboo-like multiwalled carbon nanotubes (BCNTs) were grown via catalytic decomposition of C2H2 on Ni catalyst at 650 °C. Recently, the growth dynamics of BCNTs through catalytic decomposition of C2H2 on Ni catalyst at 650 °C has been observed in real time by Foo et al. using an in situ ultrahigh vacuum transmission electron microscope. It is demonstrated that the growth of BCNT follows adsorption–decomposition–surface diffusion-step nucleation process instead of the previous precipitation reaction.164 The in situ TEM technique is expected to be a powerful way for researchers to further explore the unclear formation mechanisms of carbon related materials.

Graphene was first discovered in 2004, and is stable at room temperature.165 Rao et al. explored the effects of crystallite size on the linear and non-linear optical properties of CVD grown polycrystalline graphene. They also found that the layer stacking in graphene has no significant effects on the effective two-photon absorption coefficient.166 Besides graphene, other novel 2D carbon materials such as leaf-like carbon sheets or porous materials with a thickness of 50–200 nm have recently been obtained by the pyrolysis of dichloromethane and ferrocene in an autoclave in 300–600 °C on Cu ribbons for 90 min.167 Carbon nanocages (CNCs) with diameters of 200–350 nm were synthesized by using different alcohols and ferrous oxalate as reactants at 550 °C for 12 h in a sealed autoclave. They displayed higher removal efficiency for phenolic compounds, ammonia, and total particulate matter from cigarette smoke (Fig. 15a and b).168 After the CNCs were annealed at 600 °C for 10 h, they could act as anode materials and display a high reversible capacity of 520 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at current density of 100 mA g−1. Furthermore, a discharge capacity of 380 mA h g−1 can be obtained after 50 cycles at current density of 500 mA g−1 (Fig. 15c and d).169 Carbon spheres were prepared from glucose under hydrothermal conditions at 160–180 °C for 4–20 h by the group of Li, and they have been used in drug delivery, biodiagnostics, combinatorial synthesis, and photonic band-gap crystals.170 Copper microparticles (2–5 μm) encapsulated in carbonaceous shell polyhedral composites were mildly prepared via a one-pot hydrothermal process by using Cu(NO3)2, C6H6O6, and sodium citrate at 150 °C. The inner copper microparticles could be partially released under the convergent electron beams and then translated into crystalline Cu nanoparticles. Therefore, the composite might possess potential applications as a sensitive detector.171

4.2 Silicon carbide (SiC)
Since the late 1960s, SiC has drawn intense research interest for its characteristics of versatile electrical and structural properties;172,173 for instance, high temperature resistance, extreme mechanical strength and durability, high resistance for sintering, and unique properties (electron emission, optoelectronic, and biomedical properties). SiC has more than 250 polytypes.174 SiC consists of two categories: cubic SiC (3C-SiC/β-SiC) and hexagonal SiC (2H, 4H, 6H, 15R/α-SiC). It has been used for the fabrication of electronic devices, including Schottky rectifiers and metal semiconductor field-effect transistors. Much evidence demonstrates that their electrical and optical characteristics exhibit strong dependences on shape, structure and size.175
Generally speaking, synthetic methods for SiC can be divided into physical methods176 (such as laser ablation, arc-discharge and evaporation, pulsed-laser deposition) and chemical approaches. The latter is preferred owing to the low cost and convenience. All kinds of chemical approaches have been developed for the synthesis of SiC, such as the carbothermal reduction reaction,172 chemical vapor reaction,177 sol–gel techniques, self-propagating high temperature synthesis,175 the autoclave route,178–180 electrochemical etching181 and so on. Among these methods, the “autoclave route” is a common way to prepare SiC at low temperature. In recent years, researchers mainly focused on the preparation and application of optical properties of SiC nanoparticles.182
3C-SiC nanowires (with a mean diameter of 30 nm) were prepared via a sulfur-assisted reduction route (Si–S–Na–C2Cl4) at 130 °C in an autoclave followed by a subsequent H2SO4 reflux process to remove the co-existent amorphous graphite. In the absence of S powder, the reaction temperature should be raised higher than 270 °C.180 The “autoclave route” can produce SiC with controllable diameter (Table 6). SiC nanostructures could also be formed from waste plastics and silicon powder in an autoclave in 350–500 °C for 20–40 h. This procedure was conducted at moderate reaction conditions using low cost raw materials which provided an effective route to solve the problem of waste plastics pollution.183 Yang et al. reported the fabrication of mesoporous SiC fibers with a mean size of ∼30 nm via electrospinning of polyureasilazane and polyvinylpyrrolidone, followed by high-temperature pyrolysis at 1400 °C for 2 h. These as-fabricated mesoporous fibers with well defined shape and controllable structure might enable their promising utilization as photocatalysts and catalyst supports due to their high specific surface areas.184,185 Ultrathin 3C-SiC single-crystalline nanowires have been prepared by a molecule template assisted chemical co-reduction method in an autoclave, which have enhanced photoluminescence properties and exhibited a very strong green light emission. At the same time, it had a low turn-on field (3.57 V mm−1) and a large field-emission current density (20 mA cm−2). The product may be used as good field emitters (Fig. 16a–c).191

2H-SiC nanoflakes have been produced via a one-step solvothermal route starting from SiCl4 and CaC2 at 180 °C in an autoclave (2CaC2 + SiCl4 = SiC + 2CaCl2 + 3C). Their diameters are 200–500 nm, thickness is about 15 nm. The nanoflakes exhibit new photoluminescence peak at ∼314 nm due to defects in the SiOx.181
3D-SiC materials include nanospheres and polyhedrons. 3C-SiC nanoparticles encapsulated in branched wavelike carbon nanotube composites have been synthesized in an autoclave at 600 °C. This structure may have important applications in nanotechnology, such as nanoscale multiterminal electronic devices and light-emitting diodes (Fig. 16d and e).184
4.3 Titanium carbide (TiC)
TiC has attracted a lot of research interest for its high melting point, high hardness, low density, high modulus, extreme resistance to oxidation and corrosion, good thermal and electrical conductivity.192 Though changing the ratio of C:Ti stoichiometry, its cubic symmetry (Fm3m) structure is steady.193 Uniform and fine TiC hollow nanospheres with a homogeneous chemical composition are required for advanced materials applications.194 Nanosized TiC powders have similar catalytic properties to those of the Pt group metals.
Numerous methods for the synthesis of nanoscale TiC materials have been reported, for example, direct carbonization of Ti powder metal,195 CVD between TiCl4 and CH4,196 and Mg-thermal reduction of TiCl4 and CxCl4 solution at 1173–1373 K.197
The core–shell TiC/C nanofiber (1D) which acted as a conductive and mechanically robust scaffold for electron transport during the Li–Si alloying process were grown directly on a Ti alloy foil under acetone vapor at 850 °C via a thermochemical reaction (Fig. 17).198 TiC/C/Si nanocomposite nanofibers, which were formed by CVD of a thin layer of amorphous Si, show 3000 mA h g−1 discharge capacity and 92% capacity retention after 100 charge/discharge cycles. The mechanical integrity of the TiC/C scaffold was shown even after 50 charge/discharge cycles.199

Porous TiC films with high surface area (up to 840 m2 g−1) were fabricated by using physical vapor deposition in a gaseous ethylene ambient atmosphere, which are thermally robust and resistant to sintering and can retain more than 70% of their initial surface area after annealing to 1000 K.200
TiC hollow spheres with an outer diameter of 70–110 nm have been produced by our group via a co-reduction route using TiCl4, C2Cl4, and Na as reactants in an autoclave at 240–400 °C. This is a simple, effective and high yield method to produce TiC hollow nanospheres.194 The shape evolution of TiC particles from octahedra to cubes has been achieved by the assistance of the group VIII elements (Fe, Co and Ni). Transition-metal atoms, such as Ni and Fe, selectively absorb on {100} facets of growing TiC crystal due to interaction of Ni-3d and C-2p and reduce the specific surface energy of {100}.201
4.4 Some other carbides
Though the synthetic methods for nanoscale Mo2C, WC, NbC are similar with that of SiC nanomaterials, for example, SiC, Mo2C, WC could be fabricated by dry autoclaving (unique single-step, solvent-free synthetic) method,18 these materials are less explored compared with SiC.
Mo2C and WC possess an electronic structure similar to Pt and Ru, respectively (so-called “Pt and Ru behavior”). Mo2C has the properties of high melting point (2770 K), extreme hardness, superconductivity and has potential applications in the ceramic and catalytic fields. As a very active catalyst, Mo2C is used for dehydrogenation, methane reforming, aromatization, hydrodesulfurization, and alcohol amination.202–204 WC has been applied in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells due to its electronic structure.205 Composites of WC-OMC (ordered nano-mesoporous carbon), replacing Pt, are used as the counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cell systems.206 NbC is an attractive non-oxide ceramic because of its high melting point, excellent hardness, good chemical stability, high conductivity, and superior wear resistance.207 Very recently, the integration of superconducting NbC with the highly aligned CNT forests have been achieved using a chemical solution approach. NbC exhibits higher superconducting properties with a value of Hc2 around 5 T at 4.2 K, which is higher than that of pure bulk one. Moreover, the results also suggest that highly oriented CNTs embedded in superconducting NbC can function as defects and effectively enhance the superconducting properties of the NbC.208
Perspectives and outlook
In summary, we have provided an overview of the recent progress and achievements in the fields of synthesis, properties and applications of nanoscale nitrides, borides and carbides. However, the main object is not to make a systematic review of the topic, because there are too many breakthroughs to illustrate in detail, and also there are already many reviews that have been published, but instead to offer a personal view of the more interesting recent research trends and developments. Many convenient and effective strategies, including the low temperature and low cost “autoclave route”, have been developed for the synthesis of diversified inorganic materials, especially nanoscale nitrides, borides and carbides with controllable morphologies, phases and sizes. However, on one hand difficulties presently remain with respect to the highest selectivity, orientation and scaled production of uniform products with tailored properties, and there is still a lack of in situ or online detection instruments for the comprehensive and fundamental understanding of the exact formation processes of the target crystals (including their thermodynamics and kinetics, their shape or phase evolution), and mechanisms of the designed chemical reactions. On the other hand, effective purification and separation methods must also be further developed to obtained the desired materials. Once these issues are resolved, nanoscale nitrides, borides, carbides, together with their related heterostructures, functional materials and integrated devices with multiple useful and expected unique properties, will provide new opportunities and strong support to meet the wider applications and further development of modern nanoscience and nanotechnology.
