    , Accepted 5th June 2019First published on 25th June 2019AbstractThis paper follows on from the Concluding Remarks presentation of the 3rd Faraday Discussion Meeting on Artificial Photosynthesis, Cambridge, UK, 25–27th March 2019. It aims to discuss the context for the research discussed at this meeting, starting with an overview of the motivation for research on artificial photosynthesis. It then goes onto analysing the composition and trends in the field of artificial photosynthesis, and its scale relative to other related research areas, primarily using the results of searches of publication databases. As such, we hope it provides helpful insights to researchers in the field.
1. Introduction
Artificial photosynthesis is a term used to describe most widely any man-mediated process which stores sunlight energy in useful, high energy chemicals.1–4 One of its most studied applications is the production of fuels (so-called solar fuels) to replace fossil fuels and enable the carbon neutral exploitation of the energy subsequently freed to their combustion. Artificial photosynthesis draws inspiration from natural photosynthesis, which selectively and reversibly produces multiple sorts of chemicals under mild conditions, being the main source of energy-rich organic compounds on the planet.5–7 Artificial photosynthesis is usually composed of three main steps: (1) fast light absorption leading to an excited state, (2) charge generation and charge separation through space, and, finally, (3) slow chemical conversion of substrates and charges into fuels or other chemicals.8,9
Since Fukushima and Honda first reported the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen with light in 1972,10 many efforts have been devoted to this goal, but the most promising devices and materials still suffer from fast component degradation and/or large efficiency losses.11–13 Progress in the field has been limited by scientific factors (i.e. the fundamental understanding of the charge generation and separation processes,14–16 the available techniques,17–21 the development of better photoabsorbers and catalysts, etc.22–26) but also by other variables such as the severity of energy and climate crisis,27,28 differing funding priorities and changing innovation strategies.29,30 The main motivations to continue working on artificial photosynthesis, however, have remained intact.
In the 3rd Faraday Discussion on Artificial Photosynthesis in Cambridge, UK, different possible approaches to develop a functional and commercially viable solar-to-chemical energy conversion device were covered (Fig. 1). These approaches are based on different classifications of artificial photosynthesis research, which depend on the nature of the materials used (Section 4.2), the degree of system integration (Section 4.1), and the substrates and products involved (Section 4.3). In this article, we will firstly discuss the main motivations for artificial photosynthesis research. Secondly, the different trends in the field will be contextualised based on publication data.

2. Motivation: the energy problem
Artificial photosynthesis is one strategy to address the growing energy demand worldwide and the dependence of our current energy system on fossil fuels,32,33 complementary to the development of renewable sources of electrical power, sustainable bio-derived energy and increases in energy efficiency. It offers a potentially low carbon or carbon neutral pathway for the synthesis of sustainable fuels (e.g.: ‘green’ hydrogen from water). It also offers scalable pathways for carbon dioxide reduction and utilisation, as well as the potential for carbon neutral nitrogen reduction for fertiliser manufacture.
A key motivation for artificial photosynthesis concerns the geographical location of energy resources. Fossil fuel reserves are unequally spread geographically.32,33 The wealthiest countries in the world are the largest energy consumers, and they are typically dependent on the large scale transportation of energy to them, primarily in the form of fossil fuels transported in marine tankers or gas pipes.32,34,35 Sunlight is the largest available renewable energy resource (Fig. 2).36 It is geographically relatively dispersed compared to fossil fuels, although also often most intense in regions with less energy demand. Given the limitations of long distance electrical power distribution, the storage of solar energy in chemical fuels, and their transportation in tankers or gas pipes presents a scalable pathway to transport renewable energy globally.37

A further motivation for artificial photosynthesis results from the intermittency of most renewable electrical power sources. The availability of most renewable energies is variable, depending on the weather conditions, the time of the day, the month and the season. Since peak energy demands occur during the evening and in winter, and because energy-intensive industries and heavy-duty transport cannot rely on fluctuating and unpredictable energy sources, the large scale deployment of renewable energy systems increasingly requires that the energy generated can be stored efficiently and cheaply.38,39 Electrical power can be stored in batteries and related technologies to address short term (up to days/weeks) fluctuations in renewable electricity generation, but they lack scalability and their relatively high cost make them unsuitable for long term, and in particular interseasonal, storage.40,41 Moreover, batteries have a limited volumetric and gravimetric energy density (Fig. 3) compared to chemical fuels.42,43 This means that whilst batteries are rapidly becoming the energy storage medium of choice for cars, they are likely to remain too heavy to power effectively long-distance marine and aviation sectors. For both of these storage challenges, the efficient storage of renewable energy as chemical fuels (i.e. artificial photosynthesis) provides a potentially attractive low carbon solution.

A particular concern with many developing artificial photosynthesis strategies is that the best catalysts converting electrical potential into chemicals, both in electrolyzers and in many direct artificial photosynthesis systems such as photoelectrochemical devices, are based on metals belonging to the platinum group (i.e. ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium and platinum). These metals are classified as critical raw materials by the European Union because of their high supply risk and economic importance, and therefore of limited suitability for large scale mass production.44–46 This is a potentially limiting constraint for artificial photosynthesis and motivates fundamental research towards developing more sustainable components based on earth-abundant materials.23,25,26,47,48
3. Search criteria
The second part of this article is based on an analysis of the artificial photosynthesis literature. The results of any such search depends critically on the choice of search terms, and is therefore only partially objective. Many terms and expressions can be used to refer to processes inherent to artificial photosynthesis, with light-driven catalysis at their heart. Herein, publications are considered to address artificial photosynthesis if the title, abstract or keywords include words with the prefix photo followed by reduction or oxidation, or include the word electrochemical or words with the prefix photo combined with terms referring to water splitting and CO2 reduction (see ESI† for the exact search criteria). Different ways to express the same concept have been considered in each one of the searches, including singular and plural terminologies, chemical formulas and the most common synonyms, and broadly yielded similar trends. This search is not perfectly complete, because publications do not always explicitly mention the technical definition of the materials and devices studied, and because we have omitted less common expressions and word combinations. In any case, we hope the selected groups of publications are reasonably representative and indicative of trends in the artificial photosynthesis field.
4. The artificial photosynthesis field

Fig. 4 illustrates the growth in publications in the field of artificial photosynthesis. Whilst the field was initiated in the 1970s with the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda, it has only grown significantly since the early 1990s, motivated by increased concerns over oil prices and the environmental impact of fossil fuels, as well as scientifically by advances in our understanding of electron transfer in natural photosynthesis and liquid–semiconductor junctions.34,50–53 Since then, it has grown rapidly, exhibiting an exponential increase in the number of publications (Fig. 4).49 However, compared with other energy conversion technologies, artificial photosynthesis is still at an early development stage, with relatively few patents and companies compared with related fields such as batteries, electrolysers and solar cells (see Fig. S1†). This perhaps reflects the particularly high level of science challenge associated with the development of artificial photosynthesis technologies.

We turn now to consider the classification by research area of publications to date in the field of artificial photosynthesis.49 Perhaps unsurprisingly, chemistry is the largest discipline, followed by materials science, engineering, physics, and biochemistry and molecular biology (Fig. 5). On the other hand, electrochemistry stands out as the key area of expertise followed by energy fuels.54 From the geopolitical perspective, China, United States, the European Union and Japan are at the forefront in artificial photosynthesis research output, with most of these countries having implemented focused programs on this topic in the last 25 years (Fig. 6).55–57

4.1. Classification according to device type
The degree of integration of components performing one or more steps (i.e. light absorption, charge separation or catalysis) can be a criterion to distinguish different research categories. Most simply, three architectures have been proposed for artificial photosynthetic devices.8,58 The first comprises coupling photovoltaic panels with electrolyzers, which both comprise relatively mature technologies. The second architecture is based on photoelectrochemistry, where light absorbing materials are integrated with catalytically active materials into electrodes that could be used in unbiased light driven electrolyzers. The third architecture is based on photocatalysis, where light absorbing and catalytic materials are suspended in solution as homogeneous suspensions, most typically as particles. Other device architectures, such as photocatalyst sheets or photovoltaic buried junctions, are attracting increasing interest, but have attracted relatively few publications to date.
Among the total of 74000 articles published to date related to artificial photosynthesis, 6300 can be readily identified as focusing on devices, junctions and photoelectrodes, and 11300 on catalysis (including photocatalysis) (see ESI† for search criteria). A much lower proportion can be identified as targeting photoabsorbers, probably because such publications are rather oriented towards solar cell research and photovoltaics. Fig. 7 represents the historical trends in the proportions of publications related to photocatalytic homogeneous suspensions and photoelectrodes; it is apparent that, since 2010, there has been increasing focus on photoelectrodes rather than photocatalytic suspensions. Relatively few publications can be identified as focusing on combined photovoltaics and electrolyzers, which are most likely to be investigated together primarily at an industrial level, with ∼3500 patents on combined photovoltaic and electrolyser systems, significantly more than the number of publications on this approach.

4.2. Classification according to material
Leaving aside genetically modified photosynthetic organisms, the most widely investigated materials studied in the field of artificial photosynthesis as catalysts are earth-abundant metal oxides (e.g. TiO2, CuO, BiVO4), platinum group metals and metal oxides (e.g. platinum, RuO2, IrO2), enzymes, carbon nitrides, metal- and covalent organic frameworks (MOFs and COFs), molecular catalysts, polyoxometalates, dichalcogenides, perovskites, gallium nitrides and light-absorbing, conjugated polymers (Fig. 8). The first are often regarded as robust and, together with dichalcogenides, MOFs, COFs, semiconducting polymers and carbon nitrides, are used as photocatalysts. POMs have been used both as electrocatalysts and photocatalysts. It is striking from Fig. 8 that carbon nitrides and, to a smaller extent, POMs and dichalcogenides have experienced a particular growth in research activity recently. Carbon nitrides have also been used as dyes, while semiconducting polymers and oxides have been used as charge separation layers. On the other hand, enzymes, which have been investigated in both natural and artificial photosynthesis systems, and molecular catalysts need to be coupled to an electron source. Despite being faster, more selective and working at lower overpotentials, they are harder to obtain, typically less stable and more sensitive to the working conditions, which may account for the smaller representation in the field.
 Fig. 8  Publications in artificial photosynthesis related to different materials.49 We note that publications employing semiconducting silicon were not categorised separately due to overlap with its use as a dopant in metal oxides. 
Silicon has been excluded because of its wide use as dopant. Furthermore, we have omitted platinum group metals (PGM) and perovskites from the metal oxide search, PGMs and metal oxides from the perovskite search and carbon nitrides from the polymer one to guarantee that catalytic materials are not repeated twice. As a consequence, papers including mutually excluded materials have been filtered out (papers with polymers + carbon nitrides or metal oxides + perovskites). Publications including dyes based on PGM and perovskites or metal oxides, are represented by the PGM category in Fig. 8.
4.3. Classification according to substrates or products
Finally, artificial photosynthesis research can also be sorted according to the type of substrate converted or the final product. Two categories represent ∼90% of the publications in the field. The dominant one is water splitting, involving the reduction of water into hydrogen and its oxidation into oxygen.23,59,60 The second is CO2 reduction to form carbon monoxide, formate, formaldehyde, methanol or methane.61–63 Alternative chemical targets of interest for photo-electrochemical conversion include N2 fixation into ammonia,64–66 photo-degradation of organic pollutants67 or the utilization of low-value industrial side products such as glycerol.68Fig. 9 shows the percentage of publications focused on water oxidation, water reduction or CO2 reduction.

While 20 years ago a larger diversity of photocatalysed reactions was studied (including for example a range of organic oxidations), currently most published research in the field of artificial photosynthesis focuses on either CO2 reduction, water reduction or water oxidation. The proportion of research dedicated to water reduction (or H2 production) and CO2 reduction has increased, while water oxidation (or O2 evolution) has slightly decreased and plateaued at around 25%, although the total amount of publications has increased exponentially in all three sub-areas parallel to the general trend in the field. The evolution of water oxidation research may have been influenced by the progress in understanding Photosystem II in natural photosynthesis,17,69,70 while research in hydrogen evolution has been favoured by the huge potential of hydrogen as a fuel.71–74 Last, CO2 reduction, which can be catalytically more challenging and usually less selective, has gained more attention recently, although still significantly less than that on proton reduction (note thermochemical CO2 reduction was not included in this analysis).75–77
5. Conclusions
The analyses of the artificial photosynthesis publication data to date reported herein is only limited in scope and the selection of suitable search words. However, even with these limitations, it provides some overview of the field of artificial photosynthesis. Some results of the analysis are particularly striking, such as the rapid growth of interest in carbon nitride photocatalysts, and the continued dominance of publications on proton reduction rather than carbon dioxide reduction, despite major new initiatives on the latter. There is increasing focus on photoelectrodes rather than photocatalyst suspensions, despite some cost projections indicating photocatalyst architectures (either as suspensions or sheets) having the greatest potential to be cost competitive with PV plus electrolysis.78 The papers presented at the Faraday Discussion meeting addressed many aspects of current research in artificial photosynthesis. Hopefully this article helps to put these studies into context and provides a useful background to this field.
