    , Accepted 23rd October 2013First published on 23rd October 2013AbstractTwo non-porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with caged Ru(bpy)32+ chromophores, [Ru(bpy)3][Zn2(C2O4)3] (1) and [Ru(bpy)3][NaAl(C2O4)3] (2), were synthesized and characterized. Their emission properties were studied by both steady-state and time-resolved luminescence measurements. Air-free microcrystals of 1 and 2 exhibit long-lived triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) excited states with lifetimes of 760 and 1305 ns, respectively. Lifetimes are significantly shortened (to 92 ns for 1 and 144 ns for 2) by trapping of trace amounts of oxygen in the non-porous MOFs, presumably due to amplified luminescence quenching of Ru(bpy)32+*. Following MLCT excitation, Ru(bpy)32+*/Ru(bpy)32+ energy transfer migration in 1 and 2 results in efficient quenching of Ru(bpy)32+* by Os(bpy)32+ added as an energy transfer trap at doping levels of 0.2–1.0%. A kinetic analysis indicates that the three-dimensional chromophore connectivity in 1 and 2 provides a network for rapid excited state energy transfer migration among Ru(bpy)32+ units, ultimately, finding an Os(bpy)32+ trap site. These crystalline frameworks with caged chromophores have proven to be ideal systems for studying light harvesting processes in artificial supramolecular systems.
Introduction
Photoactive materials are of great interest in many fields including optoelectronics, solid-state lighting, and sensing as well as in solar energy conversion.1–7 They are commonly based on semiconductors whose properties are tuned by adjusting doping levels and crystallite sizes.8–10 Challenges arise in rational design of such solid-state materials because of the drastically different properties between the base material and individual dopants. Recently, photo-active metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a new class of materials that can be designed to have properties that are tunable by varying the molecular building blocks.11–16 The synthetic tunability of MOFs17–19 along with control of their crystalline structures and crystal sizes and shapes20–27 facilitates the design of new photoactive materials for potential applications in light-harvesting, sensing, and catalysis.11,13,28–34
Excited state energy transfer between chromphores in photoactive MOFs is key in enabling cooperative interactions between individual light absorbers. MOF microcrystals with chromophoric building blocks have dimensions large enough to absorb a high fraction of light and yet small enough for the excited states to be delivered by energy transfer processes to a redox reaction center at the MOF/solution interface.28 Previous photoactive MOFs were based on Ru(bpy)32+-derived bridging ligands whose electronic structures and energetics are significantly perturbed compared to those of the parent D3 symmetric Ru(bpy)32+. In order to gain new insights into the photophysics of Ru(bpy)32+-based MOFs, we have entrapped Ru(bpy)32+ in anionic three-dimensional MOFs with cage structures with the aims of increasing the dimensionality of energy transfer pathways while maintaining the electronic structure of the Ru(bpy)32+ chromophore unperturbed.
We report in this paper the synthesis, characterization, and photophysical properties of Zn-oxalate and Na/Al-oxalate MOFs with entrapped Ru(bpy)32+ with Os(bpy)32+ added as an energy transfer trap. We have observed highly efficient energy transfer migration among the caged Ru(bpy)32+ units and energy transfer quenching by trapped oxygen inside the non-porous MOFs as probed by luminescence quenching.
Experimental section
General experimental
Microwave synthesis was performed with a CEM Discover system with 300 watts maximum power. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Shimadzu TGA-50 equipped with a platinum pan, and all samples were air-dried and heated at a rate of 3 °C per minute in air. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected with a Hitachi 4700 FE-SEM. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses were carried out using a Bruker SMART APEX II diffractometer using Cu radiation. The PXRD patterns were processed with the APEX II package using the phase ID plugin. A Varian 820-MS inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer was used to determine the molar fractions of Os in the doped MOFs. Samples were introduced via a concentric glass nebulizer with a free aspiration rate of 0.4 mL min−1, a Peltier-cooled double-pass glass spray chamber, and a quartz torch. A peristaltic pump carried samples from a SPS3 autosampler (Varian) to the nebulizer. All standards and samples were in 2% HNO3, prepared with milliQ water.
All crystallographic measurements were made on a Bruker SMART Apex II CCD-based X-ray diffractometer system equipped with Cu – target X-ray tube and operated at 1600 watts. The frames were integrated with the Bruker SAINT© build in APEX II software package using a narrow-frame integration algorithm, which also corrects for the Lorentz and polarization effects. Absorption corrections were applied using SADABS. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined to convergence by least squares method on F2 using the SHELXTL software suit. All non-hydrogen atoms are refined anisotropically.
Steady-state and time-resolved emission experiments were performed on an Edinburgh FLSP920 spectrometer in 1 cm quartz cuvettes in ethanol. The time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements were collected using either an EPL-445 or an EPL-485 laser with sub-100 ps pulse width. Magnetic stirring was used to keep the particles suspended so that the emission signal did not decrease as a result of settling of the crystals. Long pass filters were used to eliminate light scattering artifacts. The presence of oxygen was determined by observing singlet oxygen emission (λmax = 1268 nm) by using a Bruker RFS-100 FT-Raman instrument outfitted with a liquid nitrogen cooled germanium detector and an IR macro lens. Excitation utilized all visible lines of an argon ion laser (Spectra-Physics 2017, 1 W at the sample). The RFS-100 was set to 10 mm aperture, 10 kHz interferometer scanning speed, 16 cm−1 resolution. Data points correspond to averages of 128 measurements. Emission spectra were not corrected for instrument spectral response.
Synthesis of [Zn2(oxalate)3][Ru(bpy)3] (1)
A mixture of [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 (10 mg, 0.012 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2 (10 mg, 0.053 mmol) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of DMF/H2O (3 mL/1.5 mL) in a screw-capped vial. After the addition of 30 μL of oxalic acid (0.75 M in DMF) and 300 μL of HCl (3 M, aq.), the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h. Dark red crystals of [Zn2(oxalate)3][Ru(bpy)3] (1) were obtained in 45% yield after filtration. Elemental analysis for RuZn2C36H24N6O12: calcd C 44.83%, H 2.51%, N 8.72%; Anal. C 44.69%, H 2.37%, N 8.77%.
Synthesis of MOF microcrystals
Microcrystals of 1 were prepared via microwave synthesis by the addition of [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2, Zn(NO3)2, and oxalic acid in DMF and water with added HCl. For the oxygen-free samples, the microwave vessel was sealed, degassed with nitrogen for 30 minutes, and heated to 120 °C for 5 minutes to afford MOF microcrystals in a 70% yield. Oxygen-free samples were centrifuged and washed with ethanol inside a glove box to prevent oxygen trapping. The sample denoted as prepared in air was not degassed and the sample prepared in oxygen was degassed with oxygen for 15 minutes. For the Os-doped microcrystalline MOFs, known amounts of [Os(bpy)3](Cl)2 (1 mg mL−1 in DMF) were added the above mixtures to achieve desired Os doping levels. Microcrystals of [NaAl(oxalate)3][Ru(bpy)3] (2), Os-doped 2, and [NaAl(oxalate)3][Os(bpy)3] (2-Os) were prepared in a similar manner by the addition of NaNO3, Al2(SO4)3, and oxalic acid with a variable amount of added [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 or [Os(bpy)3](PF6)2 in similar yields.
Results
Synthesis and characterization of 3D MOFs with caged M(bpy)32+ (M = Ru or Os)
The Zn-oxalate MOF with caged chromophore, [Zn2(oxalate)3][Ru(bpy)3] (1), was prepared by a solvothermal reaction between Zn (NO3)2 and oxalic acid in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 in a solvent mixture of DMF/H2O at 60 °C. 1 crystallizes in the cubic space group P4132, with one Ru(bpy)32+, two Zn atoms, and three oxalate molecules in the asymmetric unit. The Zn center adopts an octahedral geometry by coordinating side-on to three oxalate molecules, forming a 3D (10, 3)-a framework with 14-node cages of ∼12.3 Å in dimensions. These cages are filled by Ru(bpy)32+ which also provide the charge balance to the anionic Zn-oxalate framework. The tight packing of Ru(bpy)32+ chromophores inside the pores formed by the Zn-oxalate framework leaves limited space for inclusion of solvent molecules (7.5% solvent-accessible void space as calculated by PLATON); however, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated no weight loss in the 25–350 °C temperature range. 1 is thus non-porous in terms of its ability to accommodate solvent molecules, but can trap small gaseous molecules such as N2 and O2 in its void space. Each caged Ru(bpy)32+ has six nearest neighbors at a distance of 9.360(1) Å between Ru centers (Fig. 1).

Microcrystals of MOFs are desirable for photophysical measurements. Microcrystals of 1 were prepared via microwave synthesis that has been described by us previously (Fig. 2).28 Os doping into microcrystals was achieved by adding controlled amounts of [Os(bpy)3]Cl2 to afford doping levels of 0.2–100 mol%. The Os doping level was determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and corresponded to the molar Ru/Os ratios in the feed within experimental errors (±10%). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the Os-doped 1 and [Zn2(oxalate)3][Os(bpy)3] (1-Os) are identical to those for 1 (Fig. 3), indicating their isostructural nature.

 Fig. 3  PXRD patterns of 1 with various Os doping levels: the mol% Os (from top to bottom) is 100%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.2%, and 0.0%. The PXRD pattern at the bottom was simulated using the single crystal structure. 
We have also prepared microcrystals of [NaAl(oxalate)3][(Ru(bpy)3)] (2) and its Os-doped analogs using similar microwave synthesis procedures as described above (Fig. 2). The similarity of their PXRD patterns to a simulated pattern of the reported single crystal structure35,36 indicates the identity of the structure (Fig. S4, ESI†). 2 has the same structure as 1 except that the two Zn2+ ions are replaced by a Na+ ion and an Al3+ ion, which is further supported by the similarity of the PXRD patterns of 1 and 2. The cell dimension of 2 (15.407(4) Å) is slightly larger than 1, which is consistent with a small shift of peaks in powder XRD patterns. The Ru–Ru distance of 9.435(2) Å in 2 is also slightly larger than that in 1.
Steady-state emission spectra of oxalate MOFs with caged M(bpy)32+ (M = Ru or Os)
The steady-state emission spectra for oxygen-free samples of 1, 1-Os, 2, and 2-Os are shown in Fig. 4. The rigid environment of the oxalate framework leads to a high energy Ru emission with well-defined vibronic structure as has been observed from emission of crystalline samples of Ru(bpy)32+.37 The chromophores are isolated from solvent and therefore the emission is not broadened as in room temperature solution experiments. Remarkably efficient energy transfer quenching is observed in Os-doped samples. As shown in Fig. 4, when 1 and 2 are doped with low Os concentrations, 0.2% or 1.0%, their steady-state emission spectra are dominated by Os emission.

The rigid environment of the oxalate framework leads to a high energy Ru emission with well-resolved vibronic structure as a result of the shielding of the chromophores from solvent molecules. The spectra were fit by application of a standard Franck-Condon analysis based on eqn (1). In this analysis, the spectrum is constructed from a series of vibronic lines broadened by low frequency modes and the medium. The spectra were fit based on the average mode approximation with both medium and low frequency modes included in the fitting analysis.38–45 (1)
In eqn (1), I() is the emission intensity at the energy in wavenumber (cm−1), relative to the intensity of the 0 → 0 transition. E0 is the energy gap between the zeroth vibrational levels of the ground- and excited-states. ħωM and ħωL are the quantum spacings for two averaged acceptor vibrational modes of medium and low frequency, respectively. SM and SL are the Huang-Rhys factors or electron-vibrational coupling constants which are a measure of the change in equilibrium displacement between ground and excited states.46,471/2 is the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) for individual vibronic lines which include contributions from solvent librations and low-frequency molecular modes treated classically.
The photon numbers of the emission spectra were corrected in wavenumber scale by using the relation, I() = I(λ) × λ2. The parameters E0, SM, SL, ħωM, ħωL, 1/2 were optimized with a least squares minimization routine using a Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG2) algorithm.48 The summation was carried out over 11 vibrational levels (νM = 0 → 10, νL = 0 → 10). Attempts to fit the spectra to the usual one-mode Franck-Condon fit in eqn (2) were unsuccessful with two modes required to fit the vibronically resolved spectral profiles. The two mode fitting procedure did fit the spectra with spectral fitting parameters quite similar to those obtained for Ru(bpy)32+* in frozen glasses (Fig. 5). (2)

Based on the results of the Frank–Condon spectral fitting analysis the classical medium reorganization energy between excited and ground states (λo) can be calculated by eqn (3a) and the total intramolecular reorganization energy (λi) by eqn (3b) with the total reorganization energy given by, λ = λo + λi. The results are listed in Table 1. (3a) (3b)

In eqn (3a), kB and T are the Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature, respectively. As expected, vibronic structure is also observed for 2-Os which is similar to Os(bpy)32+ in a frozen solution.39 The results of emission spectral fitting can also be used to calculate the free energy of the excited states above the ground state, ΔGES, by using eqn (4).49,50 ΔGES = E0 + λo(4)
ΔGES values derived from the emission spectral fitting are also included in Table 1. The free energy change for energy transfer, ΔG0en, can be calculated from the ΔGES values for the donor and acceptor by using eqn (5).51–53 Based on the calculated ΔGES values, ΔG0en is −3301 cm−1 (−0.41 eV) for 1% Os-doped 1 and -3281 cm−1 (−0.41 eV) for 1% Os-doped 2, showing that energy transfer from Ru(bpy)32+* to Os(bpy)32+ is favorable in both Os-doped 1 and 2. ΔG0en = ΔGES(acceptor) − ΔGES(donor)(5)
Time-resolved emission spectra of oxalate MOFs with caged M(bpy)32+ (M = Ru or Os): evidence for oxygen trapping in non-porous MOFs

3MLCT lifetimes of the caged chromophores in 1 and 2 are extremely sensitive to oxygen, which was an unexpected observation since the oxalate MOFs with caged M(bpy)32+ do not have the void space required to accommodate solvent molecules. For example, when microcrystals of 2 were grown in air, the emission lifetime dramatically decreased to 144 ns from 1305 ns as observed for the sample prepared in N2 (Fig. 6a and Table 2). The lifetime cannot be significantly recovered by either bubble degassing a suspension or heating a solid sample at 80 °C under vacuum.

It appears that the nonporous MOFs with caged chromophores are able to trap trace amounts of oxygen which efficiently quench the 3MLCT states by energy transfer to produce singlet oxygen.54,55 Oxygen trapping and quenching were confirmed by measuring singlet oxygen emission at ∼7890 cm−1 from a sample prepared in air (Fig. 6b).56 In contrast, samples synthesized under nitrogen exhibit no singlet oxygen emission. In a related observation, when samples prepared in an oxygen-free environment are exposed to air, lifetimes decrease as oxygen is irreversibly trapped by the MOF. In an earlier study, oxygen quenching was observed with a porous molecular solid containing Ru-polypyridyl complexes in which the extent of quenching was found to be proportional to the volume of void space.57
The observation of emission quenching of 2* by oxygen was a surprise given the non-porous nature of the MOF. In this case, the origin of efficient energy transfer by trace oxygen appears to lie in an efficient internal amplification mechanism for excited state quenching as discussed below.
Time-resolved emission spectra of oxalate MOFs with caged M(bpy)32+ (M = Ru or Os): evidence for efficient energy transfer
Because of the sensitivity of emission lifetimes to oxygen trapping, all subsequent experiments were carried out on samples prepared in an oxygen-free environment (Fig. 7). The emission decay of 2 can be satisfactorily fit with a single exponential at all wavelengths; however, the lifetime was found to be 1305 ns at 580 nm and 1350 ns at 680 nm. This behavior is indicative of intra-MOF energy transfer to slightly lower energy excited state Ru sites in the lattice.
 Fig. 7  Time-resolved emission from oxygen-free, Os-doped 1 and 2. 
A time-dependent growth in the Os emission transient of 2, observed at 680 nm, is consistent with RuII* to OsII energy transfer (see discussion). The extent of quenching is sufficiently large in 1.0% Os-doped 2 that, after 500 ns, the RuII* emission is essentially completely quenched with only emission form OsII* remaining. In these MOFs with highly dilute Os sites, the OsII* excited-states are isolated from each other and decay with single-exponential lifetimes of 257 ns in agreement with an earlier observation on site-isolated Os(bpy)32+*.36
At the low Os doping levels used in the samples of 2, 1.0% and 0.2%, the extent of RuII* emission quenching is large by steady-state emission but the value cannot be quantified because of the difference in emission quantum yields between RuII* and OsII*. The extent of quenching can be calculated by integrating the emission transients at 580 nm if it is assumed that RuII* to Os energy transfer quenching does not occur more rapidly than the resolution of the instrument (∼1 ns). Calculated in this way, the extent of emission quenching is a lower limit because quenching that occurs more rapidly than the instrument response is not observed. This analysis shows that at 0.2% Os loading 78% of RuII* emission is quenched. At a 1.0% Os loading the extent quenching increases to 95%.
Emission decay for 1 at 580 nm occurs with biexponential decay kinetics giving an average lifetime of 760 ns. Direct evidence for energy transfer is also observed in 1 with a growth in the OsII* emission transient at 680 nm. In 1, quenching is slightly lower, 65% and 90% for the 0.2% and 1.0% Os loaded samples, respectively.
Emission from 2-Os is significantly red-shifted compared to OsII* emission from the Os-doped samples. Such red-shifts are common in condensed media containing multiple chromophores and result from energy transfer to lower energy sites where nonradiative decay is enhanced. Consistent with this trend, in 2-Os excited state decay occurs with τ = 53 ns compared to τ = 259 ns for the isolated Os excited-states in 1.0% Os-doped 2.
A modified Stern–Völmer lifetime analysis was performed on the Os-doped MOFs to estimate relative energy transfer rate constants. Relative rate constants were obtained by comparing the slopes of plots of τ0/τ vs. Os doping level (Fig. 8) with increased slopes indicative of more rapid quenching. Enhanced slopes for 1 and 2 compared with previously reported MOFs are consistent with more efficient energy transfer processes in oxalate MOFs with caged Ru(bpy)32+, presumably due to the 3-D connectivity in 1 and 2.

Discussion
Previously reported transient decay measurements on 2-D Ru MOFs all displayed multiexponential kinetics.11,28,58 In a trap-free structure, the expected lifetime of 2* should approach 2.5 μs, as reported by Hauser et al. for single crystals free of sample defects or surface quenching sites.36 In those studies emission decay by isolated chromophores was investigated by diluting either Ru or Os complexes to a concentration level of ∼1% with the remaining sites occupied by photochemically inert Zn(bpy)32+to eliminate complications from energy transfer. Mixed Ru, Os samples prepared by Hauser et al. demonstrated greatly decreased lifetimes at high chromophore loadings at room temperature.36 Dilutions by Zn(bpy)32+ led to limiting lifetimes of 2.5 μs for Ru(bpy)32+* and 250 ns for Os(bpy)32+* even though oxygen was likely trapped within the crystalline frameworks. Comparison of these results with the observations made here, with energy transfer quenching occurring with trace O2, point to rapid energy transfer migration in the oxalate MOFs. By inference, rapid RuII* → RuII energy transfer hopping/migration occurs to trace O2 where RuII* → O2 energy transfer sensitization to generate singlet oxygen occurs. The result of long-distance excited-state migration is an amplified quenching effect.58–61 Even small amounts of added quenchers in the MOF are sufficient to achieve quenching because of the high excited-state mobility in the 3-dimensional lattice.
RuII* to OsII energy transfer dynamics in the oxalate MOF point to a different energy transfer mechanism than observed in the diluted crystalline samples.36 In those experiments, long-distance RuII* to OsII energy transfer occurs and the dominant mechanism for energy transfer is Förster transfer. Although energy transfer in this case ostensibly occurs between “triplet” excited states, spin-orbit coupling has the effect of mixing spin and orbital character and RuII* is ∼10% singlet in character and OsII* ∼30% singlet and both Förster (singlet–singlet) and Dexter (triplet–triplet) mechanisms are accessible. Förster transfer benefits from the longer-range 1/R6 distance dependence compared to the exponential dependence for Dexter transfer but the coupling matrix element for the transition varies with the square of the spin-orbit coupling constant. In the MOF samples with compositions >90% Ru(bpy)32+, the Dexter mechanism is expected to dominate given the short-range of the transfer process.62
Emission by the Os doped samples at 680 nm is dominated by OsII* but there is a slight overlap with the Ru emission tail. Initial emission at 680 nm, immediately following the laser pulse is probably a convolution of emission from RuII*, Os sites directly excited, or OsII* formed by sensitized energy transfer from RuII*. Dynamic effects arise from an increase in OsII* by sensitized RuII* energy transfer and decay of OsII*. With 0.2% Os doping a maximum in emission at 680 nm is not observed until ∼200 ns after the laser pulse. With 1.0% Os doping the maximum emission occurs ∼100 ns after the laser pulse with the decrease due to the reduced energy migration distance between initially excited RuII* and an Os trap site.
Emission from 1 is slightly different in detail than emission from 2 but partitioning the differences between differences in structure and crystallinity of the samples is not obvious. The lifetime of 1 at 580 nm is 760 ns compared to 1300 ns for 2. Steady-state emission from 1 is also lower in energy than from 2, as shown in Fig. 4. The most revealing data on the relative roles of the oxalate frameworks of 2 and 1 appear in the 680 nm emission decay transients for the 1.0% Os doped samples. Because of the high efficiency of RuII* to OsII quenching after 500 ns, RuII* emission is nearly completely quenched. The only emission remaining is from isolated OsII* sites. Emission decay from these sites occurs with single exponential decay consistent with a uniform environment. Under these conditions, OsII* emission lifetimes are 259 ns in 2 and 228 ns in 1 for these sites with the comparable lifetimes consistent with the comparable energy gaps, Table 1.
The increased rate of energy transfer in the oxalate frameworks compared to previously studied MOFs may be a result of a change in dimensionality for energy transfer. In a Zn–Ru(bpy)[4,4′–(CO2)2–bpy]2 MOF, energy transfer occurs along 1-D chains as a result of an increase in three orders of magnitude for Dexter coupling within the chain compared to alternate energy transfer pathways.62 In the oxalate frameworks, each chromophore is surrounded by 6 nearest neighbors each at a distance of ∼9.4 Å. The resulting 3-dimensional energy transfer network greatly enhances the number of energy transfer pathways. This compensates for a 1.5 Å increase in separation distance compared to Zn–Ru(bpy)[4,4′–(CO2)2–bpy]2. The results of a detailed modeling study of energy transfer in this MOF have been reported recently.62
Conclusions
Metal-oxalate frameworks based on M(bpy)32+ (M = Ru or Os) chromophores have been prepared and investigated for intra-MOF energy transfer. Transient and steady state emission measurements are consistent with rapid three-dimensional energy transfer in the Ru(bpy)32+ MOFs to trace O2 in the lattice to give singlet oxygen and to Os(bpy)32+ added as an energy transfer trap.
