    , Accepted 29th January 2018First published on 30th January 2018AbstractHerein we report a new approach to fabricating nanoscrolls through the self-assembly of graphene oxide (GO) sheets in a dispersion. The assembly process for GO nanosheets was induced by the dropwise addition of an appropriate organic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) into the aqueous dispersion. The results show that nanoscrolls were gradually formed from the GO sheets by rolling-up in a piece-by-piece manner with the increase of the DMF content. The transmission electron microscopic analysis indicates that for a typical case, the nanoscrolls have an average diameter of 242 ± 102 nm at the central part and the interlayer spacing between adjacent GO layers is 0.58 nm. The scrolls were estimated to have 207 turns and include on average 42 pieces of GO sheets per scroll. By this method, GO sheets with different sizes and oxidation degrees were proved to be able to form GO nanoscrolls in a similar way. Moreover, it is interesting that the diffraction efficiency of surface-relief-gratings photoinduced on the film of azo molecular glass was significantly enhanced by doping the GO nanoscrolls with a very low content (0.5 wt%); this suggests a possible new application for the GO scrolls in optical devices. This facile approach, which is also feasible by using other organic solvents such as ethanol, can be used to fabricate GO nanoscrolls for large scale applications in supercapacitors, sensors and other devices.
Introduction
The world of carbon nano-materials is extremely colourful and truly amazing because of the ever-increasing allotropic forms such as C60 fullerenes,1 onions,2,3 nanotubes,4,5 nanoscrolls,6,7 peapods8 and graphene.9 The early exploration of this fascinating world can be traced back to the study of graphite rolls and whiskers.10,11 Both carbon nanotubes (CNT) and carbon nanoscrolls (CNS) are considered to be one-dimensional nanotubes obtained by rolling up a graphene sheet by the nested tube and scroll methods, respectively.6,7,12,13 Interestingly, studies also suggest that there exist energetically accessible pathways for the inter conversion between CNT and CNS.14–16 Compared with the enthusiastic research devoted to graphene and CNT investigations, much less attention has been directed toward CNS research. Recent investigations have however revealed many unique properties of CNSs,17–21 which have been purposefully prepared by various innovative methods from graphite, graphene and reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Some well-known methods include sonication of intercalated graphite in organic solvents,6,7 self-assembly of RGO sheets with ice-templates or upon sublimation of ice to induce scrolling,22,23 rolling up graphene sheets by the solvent effect of isopropyl alcohol on SiO2/Si wafers,24 scrolling RGO sheets with the effects of nanoparticles or nanowires as templates,25,26 and formation from exfoliated graphite with the assistance of microwave sparks.27 Recently, CNSs have been explored for various applications in different areas including actuators,28,29 hydrogen storage materials,17,30 tunable channels for water and ions,18 gas sensing,31 supercapacitors,32,33 and lubrication materials.19,20 To understand the formation process, the mechanism of CNS formation has been investigated by molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulation.34–36
Graphene oxide (GO), an oxidized form of graphene, can be obtained from graphite by chemical oxidation and ultrasonic exfoliation, yielding exfoliated GO sheets dispersed in water.37–39 In these processes, various functional groups, covalently conjugated at the graphene basal plane and edges, are introduced through oxidation reactions. GO can be converted into reduced graphene oxide (RGO), the analogue of graphene, by chemical reduction on a large scale.40,41 Typically, GO sheets are highly charged and can be well dispersed in an aqueous dispersion.38,40 Recently, nanoscrolls of GO and functionalized GO were fabricated by the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) method,42 template-induced assembly with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT),43 the microexplosion method,44 nanoparticle aggregation initiation,45 ultrasonication,46 and liquid nitrogen quenching.47 A piece of GO sheet can be treated as a huge macromolecule with a 2D honeycomb structure, which contains hydrophilic functional groups but is locally hydrophobic for the hydrocarbon regions. The properties of GO sheets in organic solvents have been studied.48,49 Some organic solvents can induce aggregation due to a strong tendency to reduce the interfacial area for avoiding contact with the solvents. Theoretically, it is possible to use a selective solvent to induce the self-assembly of GO sheets in solution, which is a method widely used for the self-assembly of amphiphilic polymers.50,51 This self-assembly approach can provide a versatile means to fabricate GO nanoscrolls. However, to our knowledge, a systematic investigation along this line is still lacking in the literature.
In this study, we developed a versatile self-assembly method to fabricate nanoscrolls from GO sheets. The monolayer GO sheets were obtained by the modified Hummers’ method.37–39 The nanoscroll formation was induced by adding an organic solvent (such as DMF) dropwise into a GO aqueous dispersion. The results revealed that nanoscrolls were gradually formed by rolling up GO sheets in a piece-by-piece manner, with the increase in the DMF content. The initially formed thin scrolls acted as templates to induce more GO sheets to curl onto them in a scrolling manner. This assembly behaviour was observed for three GO samples with different sizes and oxidation degrees. Moreover, ethanol was also used instead of DMF to induce scroll formation. To explore the possible applications of GO scrolls, we prepared thin films of azo molecular glass (IAC-4) doped with a very low content (0.5 wt%) of the scrolls. The surface-relief-gratings (SRGs) were photo-inscribed on the films and the diffraction efficiency was observed to be significantly increased for the IAC-4 film doped with GO scrolls.
Experimental
Materials
Graphite powder was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), methanol, and ethanol of chromatographic grade were purchased from Aladdin. Deionized water (resistivity > 18 MΩ cm) was obtained from a Milli-Q water purification system. Other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and directly used in the experiments without further purification.
Preparation of GO sheets
GO was obtained from graphite powder by the modified Hummers’ method.37–39,41 Two types of graphite powder with the sizes of 300 mesh (4.5 × 104–5.3 × 104 nm) and 600 nm were used in this study. Typically, graphite powder (300 mesh, 3.0 g) and potassium nitrate (3.6 g) were added to concentrated sulphuric acid (138 mL) with ice-bath cooling. Then, potassium permanganate (18 g) was added to the mixture after stirring for about 30 min. Finally, the mixture was kept in an oil-bath at 35 °C for 48 h with stirring. Excess water (300 mL, 1500 mL in two batches) was slowly added to the mixture with ice-bath cooling, followed by adding 18 mL H2O2 (30%). In this process, the colour of the dispersion was observed to change from brown to yellow. The mixture was repeatedly washed with water and concentrated with the centrifuge (with the centrifugal speed of 18000 rpm) until the pH of the supernatant reached about 6. The mixture was again dispersed in 2000 mL water in a mechanical shaker with the speed of 200 rpm for 24 h. The dispersion was then treated by centrifugation at the speed of 3500–6000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the concentrated part as the first sample. The supernatant was further concentrated with the speed of 6000–12000 rpm for 30 min to obtain the second sample. These two GO samples are referred to as 300 mesh/48 h/3500–6000 rpm (i.e. size/oxidation time/centrifugal speed) and 300 mesh/48 h/6000–12000 rpm, respectively. GO was also prepared from the 600 nm graphite powder via a similar procedure to that described above, while the time for the oxidation was reduced to 6 h. The dispersion was concentrated via centrifugation at the speed of 1000–18000 rpm for 30 min after removing the visible particles and multilayer GO sheets. This GO sample is referred to as 600 nm/6 h/1000–18000 rpm. The solid contents of the concentrated GO dispersions are given in Table S1 (in ESI†).
Scrolls from GO sheets
Nanoscrolls were prepared by adding an organic solvent dropwise into the aqueous GO dispersion. Typically, a stable GO dispersion was prepared at the concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1 in water. DMF (3.81 mL) was added dropwise into the GO dispersion (1 mL) with addition at a constant rate of 7.2 mL h−1. An excess amount of DMF (20 mL) was added to the dispersion to quench the structure formed in the dispersion. The structures formed in the dispersions were separated, freeze-dried and characterized by various methods. To investigate the GO scrolls formed in the intermediate states of the assembly process, an appropriate amount of DMF was added dropwise into the GO aqueous dispersion (1 mL) and the dispersion was diluted by adding 20 mL DMF–H2O mixed solvent with the same DMF content. The nanoscroll formation was also investigated by adding ethanol, instead of DMF, into the GO dispersion using the same procedure. For comparison, freeze-dried GO sheets were directly dispersed in DMF via sonication (40 kHz, 200 W, 2 h) to form another type of scroll, i.e., cylinder-like GO scrolls. Typically, the cylinder-like GO scrolls were obtained by ultrasonically dispersing the GO sheet sample (300 mesh/48 h/3500–6000 rpm) into DMF with the concentration of 0.05 mg mL−1. After that, the scrolls formed in the dispersion were put aside for over 12 h before separation for further characterization and analysis.
Photofabrication of surface-relief-gratings
The azo molecular glass (IAC-4) was synthesized as previously reported by us.52,53 The chemical structure and synthetic route of IAC-4 are given in the ESI.† The GO scrolls used here were fabricated by adding 3 mL DMF dropwise into 1 mL of the GO (300 mesh/48 h/6000–12000 rpm) aqueous dispersion (1.0 mg mL−1), followed by 20 mL DMF. The dispersion was then concentrated by centrifugation, with centrifugal speed of 18000 rpm for 30 min. IAC-4 and IAC-4/GO scrolls (0.5 wt%) were dissolved in DMF to obtain solutions with the concentration of 15 wt%. In the process, GO scrolls and IAC-4 were mixed in DMF with a mechanical shaker at the speed of 200 rpm for 48 h. The solid films were obtained by spin-coating with the solution. After spin-coating, the films were dried under vacuum at 40 °C for 24 h. SRGs were inscribed on the film surfaces by exposing them to the interference pattern formed by a beam from a solid-state laser (488 nm, 130 mW cm−2). In the experiments, half of the linearly polarized laser beam was directly irradiated on the films and the other half of the beam was reflected onto the films by a Lloyd mirror.54,55 The SRG formation was monitored by detecting the intensity of the +1 order diffraction beam (He–Ne laser, 632.8 nm, 2 mW cm−2). The diffraction efficiency was obtained as the ratio of the intensity of the +1 order diffraction beam to the incident probe beam.
Instrumentation and characterization
Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw 1000 microspectrometer using an excitation wavelength of 633 nm. The binding energies of the elements of the GO sheets were characterized by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi) using a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source of 1486.6 eV under normal incidence. X-ray diffraction (XRD) curves for the samples were recorded at room temperature by using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic analysis and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) measurements were carried out on a Nicolet 560-IR spectrophotometer. The images of atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the monolayer GO sheets were obtained by using an AFM apparatus from Bruker Corporation (Dimension ICON-PI). The tapping mode was adopted in the measurement with an amplitude set-point of about 340 mV and the probe had a tip radius of 6–8 nm. The images of TEM of GO scrolls were obtained using a Hitachi H-7650B instrument with electron beam of 80 kV. A high-resolution JEM2010 (03006800) TEM with the 120 kV electron beam was used to obtain images of monolayer GO sheets and lamellar structure as well as electron diffraction patterns of GO nanoscrolls. For the TEM sample preparation, the diluted dispersions of GO nanoscrolls were dropped onto the copper grids which were exposed to the air to evaporate solvents for 24 h and then dried under vacuum at room temperature for 12 h.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 illustrates the nanoscroll formation induced by adding DMF to the aqueous GO dispersion, similar to the assembly induced by adding ethanol. The scrolls with two types of morphology were formed in two stages. In the first stage, by adding DMF, some less hydrophilic GO sheets curled up to form the single-sheet or few-sheet scrolls with the cylindrical shape (Fig. 1A). In the second stage, with the further increased DMF content, the relatively small or more hydrophilic GO sheets aggregated on the already formed scrolls, which were rolled up around the cylinder-like scrolls to form the spindle-shaped scrolls (Fig. 1B) as discussed in detail below.

Graphene oxide nanoscroll formation
Three GO samples were prepared for this study, which were distinguished from each other by the differences in the sizes of the graphite powder, oxidation time, and centrifugal speed for the separation. To facilitate the discussion, the GO samples are subsequently referred to as GO-1 (300 mesh/48 h/3500–6000 rpm), GO-2 (300 mesh/48 h/6000–12000 rpm) and GO-3 (600 nm/6 h/1000–18000 rpm). The preparation details are given in the Experimental section. Fig. 2A and B show the typical images of the high-resolution TEM and AFM of the single-layered GO nanosheets. The thickness of the GO nanosheets is about 1 nm as shown in Fig. 2C and Fig. S1 in ESI.† The XRD curves show that the 2θ peak shifts from 26.6° for graphite to 10.9°, 10.9° and 11.6° for GO-1, GO-2, and GO-3, respectively (Fig. S2 in ESI†). This provides evidence for the exfoliation of the graphite after the oxidation. The FT-IR spectra of the GO sheets show the characteristic absorption bands for O–H (3440 cm−1), CO (1730 cm−1), COOH (1635 cm−1), and C–O–C (1066 cm−1) groups (Fig. S3†). As shown in Fig. 1D–F, the XPS spectra of the GO samples consist of four feature peaks for C–C (284.8 eV), C–O (286.9 eV), CO (288.0 eV) and O–CO (289.8 eV). The ratios of O/C (atomic percentage) for GO-1 and GO-2 are 37.59% and 36.79%, listed in Table S2 in the ESI,† which are obviously larger compared with the value (25.15%) for GO-3. This indicates that the oxidation degrees of GO-1 and GO-2 are higher than that of GO-3, due to the shorter oxidation time for GO-3.

GO nanoscrolls were obtained by adding DMF dropwise to the aqueous dispersions. Typically, the stable GO dispersion in water was prepared to have a concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1. DMF (3.81 mL) was added dropwise to the GO dispersion (1 mL) with a constant dropping rate of 7.2 mL h−1. Then, an excess amount of DMF (20 mL) was added to the dispersion to quench the structures formed in the dispersion. The GO nanoscrolls formed in the dispersions were separated and then freeze-dried for the characterizations. The GO nanoscrolls obtained from GO-1, GO-2 and GO-3 are referred to as GO-scroll-1, GO-scroll-2 and GO-scroll-3, respectively.

Fig. 3 gives the TEM images of the nanoscrolls obtained from the GO sheets. The spindle-shaped scrolls are observed for the samples obtained from three GO sheets with different sizes and oxidation degrees, which all curled up to form the GO scrolls. The average diameters and lengths of the scrolls are listed in Table S3,† which were estimated from TEM images for at least 50 pieces of the GO scrolls. For GO-scroll-1, shown in Fig. 3A, the nanoscrolls have the average diameter of 242 ± 102 nm (at the central part) and the average length of 1870 ± 706 nm. For GO-scroll-2 and GO-scroll-3 (Fig. 3B and C), the average diameters are 129 ± 47 nm and 114 ± 60 nm (at the central parts), and the average lengths are 1356 ± 304 nm and 723 ± 405 nm, respectively. Fig. 3D shows the typical high-resolution TEM image of the GO nanoscrolls (the same batch as shown in Fig. 3A). The lamellar morphology can be clearly identified, which proves that the scrolls are formed from GO sheets by tightly rolling-up. The interlayer spacing between adjacent layers is 0.58 nm for the GO nanoscrolls, which is larger compared with the values for MWCNT and graphene nanoscrolls (0.34 nm).4–7,24 This can be attributed to the steric hindrance of the introduced functional groups and the decrease of the van der Waals interaction between the GO sheets.

Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was employed to detect the elemental content of the scrolls. The EDS spectra are given in Fig. S4 in the ESI† and the elemental contents are listed in Table S2,† which were taken from the middle parts of the typical scrolls. The EDS results indicate that the GO scrolls are composed of carbon and oxygen atoms. The weak Cu signal is from the TEM grids, which can be seen for all the samples. The oxygen content of the GO-scroll-1 and GO-scroll-2 are higher than that of GO-scroll-3. This is attributed to the higher degrees of oxidation of GO-1 and GO-2 compared with that of GO-3. Although the absolute values of the EDS analysis cannot be directly compared with the XPS result for the GO sheets, the tendency reflected by the analyses is consistent, which further confirms that the scrolls were formed from the GO sheets.
Based on the diameters and lengths of the scrolls as well as the interlayer spacing, it can be estimated that the nanoscroll (GO-scroll-1) should include about 207 complete turns (T = (r − 1)/d) based on the minimal inner radius of about 1 nm,34–36 where T is the number of complete turns, r (= 121 nm) is the average radius of the GO scrolls and d (= 0.58 nm) is the interlayer spacing. The number of nanosheets included per nanoscroll (N) can be estimated from the equation N = T × 2π(1 + r)/2L, where L is the width of a GO sheet. In this equation, 2π(1 + r)/2 is the average circumference of a complete turn. Considering the irregular shape of the GO sheet, its lateral sizes are supposed to be equal to the scroll length. For this estimation, a sheet is approximated by a square and both sides of the square are equal to the scroll length. Therefore, N can be estimated to be about 42 on average based on the typical size of 1870 × 1870 nm2 for the GO sheets. The numbers of complete turns and pieces per scroll for GO-scroll-2 and GO-scroll-3, estimated by the same method, are given in Table S3 (in ESI†). From the above results, it is interesting to see that the spindle-shaped nanoscrolls are formed from many pieces of the GO nanosheets.
This statement is further justified by comparison with the nanoscrolls obtained via directly dispersing the freeze-dried GO in DMF under sonication. As exhibited in Fig. 3E, the GO nanoscrolls formed in this way only show the cylinder-like morphology with a much thinner diameter. The high-resolution TEM image shows that the interlayer spacing is about 0.62 nm (Fig. 3F), which is slightly larger compared with that of the scrolls obtained by gradually adding DMF. The average diameter and length of the GO nanoscrolls are 56 ± 38 nm and 989 ± 543 nm, respectively (Table S3 in ESI†). The scrolls can be estimated to include about 43 complete turns and about 4 pieces of the GO sheets per scroll on average, based on their sizes of 989 × 989 nm2, which were calculated by the same equations described above. The results confirm that GO scrolls formed by gradually adding DMF into the aqueous dispersions include much more pieces of GO sheets. This means that the spindle-shaped GO scrolls were formed from many GO sheets via a piece-by-piece scrolling process induced by gradually adding DMF. The typical yield of the GO scrolls (GO-scroll-2) was calculated to be 90% statistically from tens of TEM images for the nanostructures separated from the dispersion, which included a total of 183 pieces of nanoscrolls and 21 pieces of GO sheets in the field of view.
Raman and electron diffraction characterization
The nanoscrolls were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, and the results were compared with the results of the GO nanosheets. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of GO-scroll-3 and GO-3. The intensity ratio of the D band to the G band for GO-scroll-3 is 1.106, obtained from the maximum heights of two peaks.56,57 This value for GO-scroll-3 is slightly higher than that of GO-3 (1.079). The intensity ratios of the D band to the G band for GO-scroll-1 and GO-scroll-2 are 1.123 and 1.124, respectively, as shown in Fig. S5 (in ESI†), which are also relatively high compared with those of the GO sheets (1.095 for GO-1 and 1.097 for GO-2). The intensity ratio I(D)/I(G) is inversely proportional to the average size of the sp2 domains.58 Therefore, the higher I(D)/I(G) values of the scrolls compared with GO sheets are consistent with the curling of the GO sheets. The position of the G band for GO-3 was observed at 1599 cm−1. The G band of GO-scroll-3 was red-shifted to 1587 cm−1, which is similar to the observation on GO scrolls.46

To obtain information on the inner structure, GO nanoscrolls were characterized by selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Fig. 5A gives the typical electron diffraction (ED) pattern for the GO sheet (GO-1). Fig. 5B exhibits the typical ED pattern for the GO scrolls, which shows the diffraction of the ordered lattice. Due to the limited penetration depth, only the reciprocal lattice information related to the outside shells is revealed by the ED pattern. The outside shells of the scrolls can be considered as 2D lattices of GO sheets packed in a parallel manner, where the reflection can only be observed if the incident electron beam has a small Bragg angle (few degrees). Therefore, the ED patterns are similar to that observed for graphite in the …ABCABCABC… layer sequence when the electron beam is parallel to the hexagon sides.59 The reciprocal lattice points of the nanoscroll and nanosheet are depicted in Fig. S6 and S7 in ESI.† The points in the reciprocal space intersected by Ewald's sphere can well interpret the ED patterns. The interplanar spacing (002) was calculated from the ED lattice points with the diffraction vector perpendicular to the scroll axis. The values are in good agreement with those obtained by the high-resolution TEM (Table S4 in ESI†).

Morphology of the intermediate structures
To understand the scrolling process for GO sheets, the intermediate states in the assembly process were investigated by adding different amounts of DMF to the aqueous dispersions. Fig. 6 gives the TEM images of the structures separated from the dispersions and freeze-dried. Fig. 6A is a typical TEM image of the GO sheets in aqueous dispersion. When the DMF/H2O ratio is 0.1/1 (v/v), no scroll can be observed in the GO dispersion (Fig. 6B). However, GO sheets start to curl when the DMF/H2O ratio is increased to 0.4/1 (Fig. 6C). It can be seen that the edge of the monolayer GO sheets is not yet completely rolled up as the DMF/H2O ratio reaches 0.5/1 (Fig. 6D). The cylinder-like scrolls, which have smaller diameters compared with the final structure, can be seen when the DMF/H2O ratio is increased to 1.27/1 (v/v) (Fig. 6E). The spindle-shaped nanoscrolls are finally formed in the dispersions when the DMF/H2O ratio is 2.54/1 (v/v) (Fig. 6F). For the typical protocol discussed above, when 3.81 mL DMF is added dropwise to 1 mL of aqueous GO dispersion, the nanoscrolls including many pieces of the GO sheets, were formed in the dispersion. The addition of excess DMF (20 mL) in the following stage was just to quench the structures already formed in the dispersion.

Nanoscrolls in the intermediate states were further investigated by the high resolution TEM (Fig. 7). Fig. 7A and B show the scrolls from GO-2 separated from the dispersion with DMF/H2O of 1.27/1 (v/v), where the spacing between adjacent GO layers is 0.60 nm. Fig. 6C and D give the TEM images of the cylinder-like scrolls obtained by first adding 3.81 mL DMF to 1 mL aqueous GO (GO-2) dispersion, followed by the addition of 20 mL of water into the dispersion. The scrolls showed the average diameter and length of 110 ± 38 nm and 1287 ± 234 nm, respectively (Table S3†). The high-resolution TEM image shows the interlayer spacing of 0.62 nm between adjoining layers of the nanoscrolls. From the average size and interlayer spacing, the nanoscrolls were estimated to include an average of 87 complete turns to form the scroll and contain 12 pieces of GO sheets based on their size of about 1287 × 1287 nm2. On average, the numbers of complete turns and GO sheets contained in the disassembled nanoscrolls are obviously fewer than those of GO-scroll-2 (Table S3†). This indicates that due to the hydrophilic interactions with H2O, the spindle-shaped scrolls are partially disassembled by disassociating smaller GO sheets in the outside layers of the scrolls, which have relatively weaker van der Waals interactions with the adjacent sheets. On the other hand, the cylinder-like scrolls as the inner cores are relatively stable in the dispersion, because strong van der Waals interactions exist between the larger GO sheets inner scrolls.

GO sheets also showed similar assembly behaviour when ethanol was added dropwise into the aqueous dispersion of GO (Fig. S8 in ESI†). As shown by the high-resolution TEM (Fig. S8D†), the spacing between adjacent GO layers is 0.61 nm. Thus-obtained nanoscrolls are estimated to contain on average of 50 complete turns formed by 9 pieces of GO nanosheets based on their size of 537 × 537 nm2 (Table S3 in ESI†). The results indicate that for both DMF and ethanol, GO nanoscrolls can be formed to contain many GO sheets curling in the piece-by-piece manner, which is induced by adding the solvents into the GO aqueous dispersions. The scrolls formed as above will have difficulty being re-dispersed in water since they can be partially disassembled by disassociation of the smaller GO sheets in the outside layers. This problem can be a weakness for a variety of processing applications based on aqueous dispersions. However, for those applications using organic solvents, the dispersions of scrolls in the organic solvents can be used directly.
Mechanism of scroll formation
As discussed above, due to the use of the two types of graphite powder with the different sizes of 300 mesh (4.5 × 104–5.3 × 104 nm) and 600 nm as the starting materials, different oxidation times and centrifugal speeds, the three GO samples, GO-1 (300 mesh/48 h/3500–6000 rpm), GO-2 (300 mesh/48 h/6000–12000 rpm) and GO-3 (600 nm/6 h/1000–18000 rpm), possessed different sizes and oxidation degrees. The ratios of O/C (atomic percentage) for GO-1, GO-2 and GO-3 are 37.59%, 36.79% and 25.15%, respectively. The results show that the GO sheets with the sizes and oxidation degrees varying in this range can all form scrolls by gradually adding the organic solvents. The scroll formation was also observed for different DMF dropping rates ranging from 2.53 to 15.2 mL h−1 (Fig. S9 in ESI†). Besides the freeze-drying method used to obtain GO nanoscrolls, the GO nanoscrolls were also obtained by evaporating solvents from the dispersions and then drying under vacuum. These results show that the scroll formation is a self-assembly process with generality.
To further understand this process, the dispersion stability of GO in DMF and ethanol was quantitatively characterized by measuring their UV-vis absorbance variation (at 488 nm) in comparison with that of the water dispersion (Fig. S10 in ESI†). Compared with the aqueous dispersion, sedimentation occurs much faster for the dispersions of GO in DMF and ethanol, which is consistent with the previous study.60,61 It confirms that the dispersion stability in DMF and ethanol is obviously poorer compared with that in water. The dispersion stability of GO sheets is related to the Hansen solubility parameters of the solvents, which include δd (dispersion cohesion), δp (polarity cohesion), and δh (hydrogen bonding cohesion).62–64 The gradual sedimentation has been reported for the dispersions of GO in DMF and ethanol, which has been attributed to their Hansen solubility parameters (δp + δh) in the medium range.60–62 Based on the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory, the dispersion stability of GO sheets in aqueous and organic media are also affected by repulsion between the negative electric charges of the double layer on the GO sheets.65,66 The zeta potentials of the GO dispersions in water, DMF and ethanol were measured in this study (Fig. S11 in ESI†). The values for GO in DMF (ζ = −7.3 ± 2.1 mV) and ethanol (ζ = −36.2 ± 5.6 mV) are obviously less negative in comparison with that of the aqueous dispersion (ζ = −50.3 ± 6.4 mV). The above results all indicate that compared with water, the dispersion of GO sheets in these two organic solvents is less stable. To confirm that the zeta potential is a critically important factor, the scroll formation was also tested for methanol (ζ = −20.9 ± 3.8 mV) by the same procedure. The preliminary results show that the formation of GO scrolls can also be induced by methanol (Fig. S12 in ESI†). These results indicate that a water-mixable solvent with a significantly less negative zeta potential for its GO dispersion is a suitable solvent to induce the scroll formation.
CNS formation is controlled by two opposite energetic contributions, where bending the graphene sheet causes the elastic energy increase and the van der Waals interaction in overlapping regions of the graphene sheets reduces the free energy.34–36 For GO, the existence of the functional groups and defects/vacancies in the 2D crystal lattice can enhance the interaction of GO sheets with the solvent.36 The cylinder-like scrolls (Fig. 3E and F), formed by directly dispersing the freeze-dried GO nanosheets in the DMF under sonication, have a much thinner diameter than those obtained by gradually adding DMF into the aqueous dispersion of GO to high DMF content. This means that when the monolayer GO sheets are exposed to DMF, spontaneous scrolling will occur in the dispersions. In the process, the scrolling was induced by the relaxation of local stress at the regions of defects around the functional groups to overcome the energy barriers. The cylinder-like scrolls were observed in the intermediate states during the process of gradually adding DMF to the aqueous dispersion before the final spindle-shaped scrolls were formed (Fig. 6D, E and 7A). Moreover, the cylinder-like scrolls were also observed when an excessive amount of water was added to the DMF dispersion of the GO scrolls (Fig. 7C and D). These results reveal that the cylinder-like GO scrolls, including a few pieces of GO sheets, were formed in the first stage. The surface strain caused by isopropyl alcohol has been observed to serve as one of the driving forces to bend the graphene sheet.24 Recent theoretical study has also shown that the initial torsional bending energy barrier can be lowered or even eliminated to reach the initial scroll structure by allowing local stress relaxation around the defect sites, which is then stabilized by the van der Waals interaction in the curled regions.36 Both the dispersion stability and zeta potential discussed above show that DMF and ethanol are unfavourable solvents compared with water for the GO sheets. The tendency to reduce the contact interface with the unfavourable solvents is one of the driving forces that cause the scrolling in the initial stage. After the initial rolling up, the cylinder-like nanoscrolls can then act as templates to induce GO sheets to curl onto the templates with the continual increase of the DMF content. The template effect to induce the formation of GO scrolls has been verified by previous experiments.43,45
The initial scrolling in the dispersion is related to the GO sheet sizes, layer numbers and the inhomogeneous distribution of the hydrophilic groups on GO sheets. Generally speaking, the bending energy will increase with the increases in the bending stiffness and the rolling width.34–36 As the few-layer (such as two-layer, three-layer) GO sheets have the higher bending stiffness, it is more difficult for the sheets to initiate the bending. The current study also observed that the few-layer GO sheets can hardly curl up under the same conditions to induce the GO scroll formation (Fig. S13 in ESI†). According to the widely accepted Lerf–Klinowski model, the functional groups are not uniformly distributed on the GO sheets, where the carboxyl groups are rich at the edges, whereas hydroxyl and epoxy groups are more likely to be present in plane.67 GO sheets with the larger lateral sizes are less hydrophilic for their large hydrophobic planes. Therefore, on the one hand, GO sheets with large lateral sizes could be more difficult to curl up due to larger rolling widths. On the other hand, owing to the hydrophobic nature, they might tend to undergo the bending and curling when gradually adding an organic solvent. The zeta potential is related to the electrokinetic behaviour of the electric double layer (the Stern layer). A solvent with less negative zeta potential has a weak interaction with the GO sheets, which is unfavourable for stabilizing the dispersion. Therefore, the sizes of the GO sheets that can undergo bending will depend on a delicate balance between the factors.
For the case of DMF as a typical example, some less hydrophilic GO sheets with relatively large sizes can overcome the energy barriers and start to curl to form the single-sheet or few-sheets nanoscroll with the cylindrical shape in the first stage. In the second stage, the relatively smaller or more hydrophilic GO sheets aggregate on the already formed scroll precursors, which are rolled up around the cylinder-like scrolls to form the spindle-shaped scrolls with the further increase of the DMF content. As GO sheets are polydisperse, those sheets more vulnerable to the solvent quality variation curl up first in the dispersion. As the content of DMF further increases, the initially formed scrolls act as templates to induce the GO sheets with small sizes to curl up on them in the piece-by-piece manner. Finally, spindle-shaped GO scrolls were formed in the dispersions when DMF was increased to high content. This process is more or less similar for a selective solvent to cause gradual aggregation of the polydisperse polymers.68 In the present case, the extremely diluted dispersion is a necessary condition for the scroll formation. If the concentration is higher, coagulation instead of scrolling will be a predominant process, and more few-layer GO sheets formed in the dispersion can hardly form scrolls as discussed above. Moreover, due to the complex interplay between the solvent properties and the influences of the dispersed sizes and oxidation degrees of GO sheets on the scroll formation, which are related to the rolling width, hydrophilicity and interaction with organic solvents, the size distributions and yields of the formed GO scrolls should be varied from solvent to solvent, where the different sizes were observed for the scrolls formed in DMF and ethanol. The exact correlation of the scroll sizes with these factors will need further investigation.
GO scrolls used as dopant for fabricating surface-relief-gratings
The GO scrolls fabricated in this work were further explored for possible application in optical devices. Photoinduced surface-relief-grating (SRG) formation is one of the most interesting functions for azobenzene-containing materials.54,55,69 The surface modulation on the films is induced by irradiation with interfering laser beams. The sinusoidal patterns with modulated depths on the sub-micron scale can be inscribed on the film surfaces at a temperature below the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the materials, which can be erased by heating the films to a temperature above Tg.54,55 SRG formation is caused by mass transport driven by trans–cis isomerization of azo chromophores.69
The GO scrolls (GO-scroll-2) fabricated via the above process were used as a dopant to enhance the diffraction efficiency (DE) of SRGs. We observed that doping with graphene nanosheets grafted by an azo polymer can significantly increase the real time growth rate and the saturated value of DE at a very low dopant content (0.5 wt%).70 However, without the azo polymer-grafting, the nanosheets show poor dispersion ability in an organic solvent even for a solvent with strong dipole moment, such as DMF (Fig. S14 in ESI†). Therefore, it is impossible to homogeneously disperse GO sheets in a solution with the high concentration (>15 wt%) of the azo materials, which is required to prepare optical quality films by spin-coating. As discussed above, the scrolls prepared in the present study can be well dispersed in DMF, which is also a good solvent for azo polymers and azo molecular glasses. Uniform films for inscribing SRGs can be readily prepared by spin-coating. As a proof of concept study, we used an azo molecular glass (IAC-4) known to have high efficiency for inscribing the SRG.52 The synthetic route and chemical structure of IAC-4 are given in Fig. S15 (in ESI†), and the synthesis detail has been reported in our previous articles.52 SRG formation was investigated for both IAC-4 and IAC-4 doped with 0.5 wt% GO-scroll-2 (IAC-4/GO-scroll-2) by exposing their thin films to the interference pattern formed by linearly polarized laser beams (488 nm, 130 mW cm−2). The DEs of a low-power He–Ne laser beam (λ = 632.8 nm) in transmission mode were obtained as the ratios between the intensities of the +1 diffracted beam and the incident probe beam.
As shown in Fig. 8A and Fig. S16 (in ESI†), SRGs can be well inscribed on both IAC-4 and IAC-4/GO-scroll-2 films. Fig. 8B exhibits the relationship between the first order DE and the irradiation time. It can be seen that DE of SRG on the IAC-4/GO-scroll-2 film shows a much faster growth rate compared to that of SRG on the IAC-4 film. The saturated DE value of SRG on the IAC-4 film is about 8.7%, which is no longer changed after irradiation for 1710 s. On the other hand, DE of SRG on IAC-4/GO-scroll-2 film reached 13.4% when irradiated for 1980 s, which is a significant increase compared with DE of SRG on the IAC-4 film. A continuously increasing tendency can be seen for the SRG on the IAC-4/GO-scroll-2 film. This observation is consistent with that reported in our previous communication.70 Although the reason for causing the DE enhancement is still under investigation, this effect can provide a way to fabricate SRGs more efficiently for possible applications.

Conclusions
A versatile method for obtaining GO scrolls from GO sheets through self-assembly in their aqueous dispersions is reported herein. The assembly process was induced by gradually adding DMF or ethanol to the dispersions, which can cause the GO sheets to curl up to form cylinder-like scrolls. In the subsequent process with increasing organic solvent content, the GO sheets further curled onto the initially formed cylinder-like scrolls as the templates through van der Waals interactions. The solvent effect plays a key role in both initiating the scrolling process and forming scrolls to include many GO sheets in the stage following. As one possible application, the significant enhancement of the diffraction efficiency for photoinduced surface-relief-gratings (SRGs) was demonstrated by doping the azo molecular glass (IAC-4) film with 0.5 wt% of GO scrolls. The assembly process can be further exploited to fabricate scrolls with desired structures for applications in supercapacitors, sensors, solar cells, etc.
