    , Accepted 5th December 2013First published on 5th December 2013AbstractFour bis(triarylamine)-based polyimides were prepared from the polycondensation reactions of diamine monomers, N,N-bis(4-aminophenyl)-N′,N′-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine (1) and 4,4′-diamino-4′′-(3,6-di-tert-butylcarbazol-9-yl)triphenylamine (1′), with pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA), respectively. These polyimides showed high glass transition temperatures and high thermal stability. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that these polyimides were ambipolar; they showed well-defined and reversible redox couples during both p- and n-doping processes, together with multi-electrochromic behaviors and high contrast ratios in the visible and near-infrared regions. An all-plastic flexible electrochromic device (ECD) based on polypyromellitimide 3a was constructed and characterized. The device shows a maximum optical contrast (ΔT%) of 85% at 940 nm for green coloring and of 91% at 760 nm for deep blue coloring.
Introduction
Research in electrochromic devices has received a great deal of attention due to the importance of this phenomenon in applications such as electrochromic windows, displays, anti-glare mirrors, eye-glasses and solar-attenuated windows.1 In general, four major classes of materials have been used to construct electrochromic devices (ECDs), including metal oxides, inorganic coordination complexes, molecular dyes, and conjugated polymers.2 Among the different types of electrochromic materials, conjugated polymers such as polyanilines, polypyrroles, polyselenophenes, polythiophenes, and in particular, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and its derivatives attract much interest because of mechanical flexibility, ease in band-gap/color-tuning via structural control, and the potential for low-cost processing for large-area devices.3 For efficient operation of an electrochromic device, it is necessary to take a number of properties into consideration: electrochromic efficiency, optical contrast, response time, stability and durability. The difficulty in achieving satisfactory values for all these parameters at the same time stimulates the development of new methods of preparation of electrochromic films, new materials and components for the devices.4
Aromatic polyimides are commercially important materials used extensively in a wide range of optoelectronic applications due to their excellent chemical, thermal, and dielectric properties.5 Despite their outstanding properties, most of the conventional aromatic polyimides have high melting or glass-transition temperatures (Tg) and limited solubility in most organic solvents because of their rigid backbones and strong interchain interactions. One of the common approaches for increasing solubility and processability of polyimides without sacrificing high thermal stability is the introduction of bulky, packing-disruptive groups into the polymer backbone.6 Incorporation of three-dimensional, packing-disruptive triarylamine units into the polyimide backbone not only resulted in enhanced solubility but also led to new electronic functionality of polyimides, such as electrochromic7 and memory8 characteristics, due to the redox-activity of the triarylamino core. Recent studies have demonstrated that aromatic polyamides and polyimides containing N,N,N′,N′-tetraphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (TPPA) or (carbazol-9-yl)triphenylamine (CzTPA) segments show attractive electrochromic properties such as high coloration efficiency, high optical contrast, fast response time, long-term cycling stability, and multicolored electrochromism.9 The radical cations of these polymers generally showed rather strong bands in the near infrared (NIR) region due to a mixed-valence character (charge transfer transition between pairs of chromophores in different oxidation states).10
Aromatic imide dyes have been used as n-type semiconductors and electron acceptors in many fundamental studies of organic electronics including molecular switches and wires,11 solar energy conversion devices,12 n-channel thin film transistors,13 and electrochromic or light-emitting devices.14 These molecules have been used in electron-transfer studies because they undergo reversible one-electron reduction at modest potentials to form stable anion radicals localized on the electron deficient units. The electrochemical and spectroscopic properties of different imides, diimides and polyimides have been extensively studied.15 The most important electrochemical property of aromatic diimide-based compounds, such as pyromellitimides, naphthalenediimides and perylenediimides, is the existence of a stable anion radical and dianion reduced states. Thin layers of polyimides with the above-mentioned diimide units on electrodes are known to be electrochromic and undergo electrically reversible color change between the three redox states (neutral, radical anion, and dianion). In this paper, we successfully synthesized two polypyromellitimides (PPIs 3a and 3′a) and two polynaphthalimides (PNIs 3b and 3′b) from the polycondensation reactions of a TPPA-based diamine 1 [N,N-bis(4-aminophenyl)-N′,N′-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine] and another CzTPA-based diamine 1′ [4,4′-diamino-4′′-(3,6-di-tert-butylcarbazol-9-yl)triphenylamine] with pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA; 2a) and 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA; 2b), respectively. The optoelectronic properties of these polyimides have been measured and discussed. This study suggests that these polyimides are ambipolar multi-electrochromic materials with high redox stability during the oxidation process. The introduction of bulky tert-butyl substituents on the active sites of the pendent TPA and carbazole units increases the solubility and gives extra electrochemical stability of the resulting polyimides. A flexible ECD using PPI 3a as the active layer is also constructed and characterized. The device shows good electrochromic stability and high optical contrast ratios.
Experimental section
Materials
The TPPA-diamine 1 and CzTPA-diamine 1′ were synthesized according to a previously reported procedure.9e,16 Pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA; 2a, from Aldrich) was purified by recrystallization from acetic anhydride. 1,4,5,8-Naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA; 2b, from TCI) was heated at 250 °C in vacuo for 6 h before use. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) (TCI) was recrystallized twice from ethyl acetate under a nitrogen atmosphere and then dried in vacuo prior to use. All other reagents were used as received from commercial sources.
Synthesis of polyimides

Polyimides 3a and 3′a by the two-step method via thermal or chemical imidization reaction. 
A typical example of the synthesis of polyimide 3a is described as follows: the diamine monomer 1 (0.717 g, 1.30 mmol) was dissolved in 9.5 mL of dried DMAc in a 50 mL round-bottom flask. Then PMDA (0.283 g, 1.30 mmol) was added to the diamine solution in one portion. Thus, the solid content of the solution is approximately 10 wt%. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 12 h to yield a highly viscous poly(amic acid) solution. The inherent viscosity of the resulting poly(amic acid) was 1.11 dL g−1, measured in DMAc at a concentration of 0.5 g dL−1 at 30 °C. For the thermal imidization process, about 5 g of the obtained poly(amic acid) solution was transferred to a 9 cm glass Petri dish, which was placed overnight in a 90 °C oven for the slow release of the casting solvent. The poly(amic acid) in the form of a solid film was converted to polyimide 3a by successive heating under vacuum at 150 °C for 30 min, 200 °C for 30 min, and then 250 °C for 1 h. For the chemical imidization method, 2 mL of acetic anhydride and 1 mL of pyridine were added to the remaining poly(amic acid) solution, and the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 1 h to effect a complete imidization. The homogenous polymer solution was poured slowly into 200 mL of stirring methanol giving rise to a reddish brown precipitate that was collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with hot water and methanol, and dried. The IR spectrum of 3a (film) exhibited characteristic imide absorption bands at 1780 (asymmetrical CO stretch) and 1732 cm−1 (symmetrical CO stretch).


Polyimides 3b and 3′b by the one-step method via high-temperature solution polymerization. 
A typical example of the synthesis of polyimide 3′b is described as follows: into a 50 mL round-bottom flask were added 0.552 g (1.0 mmol) of NTDA, 0.268 g (1.0 mmol) of the diamine 1′ and 5 mL of m-cresol. The reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C for 2 h and then a few drops of isoquinoline were added to it. Next, the mixture was further heated at 180 °C for 5 h. After the reaction mixture was cooled to 80 °C, an additional 5 mL of m-cresol was added to dilute the viscous solution. The polymer solution was cooled to room temperature and precipitated into a large excess of methanol. A gray fibrous precipitate was washed thoroughly with hot water and methanol, collected by filtration, and dried in a vacuum at 100 °C for 6 h. The IR spectrum of 3′b (film) exhibited characteristic imide absorption bands at 1718 (asymmetrical CO stretch) and 1675 cm−1 (symmetrical CO stretch).

Fabrication of electrochromic device
An electrochromic polymer film was prepared by dropping the poly(amic acid) precursor solution of 3a (4 mg mL−1 in DMAc) onto ITO-coated glass (20 × 30 × 0.7 mm, 50 Ω per square) or ITO-coated PET slides (30 × 40 × 0.18 mm, 400 Ω per square). The poly(amic acid) was drop-coated onto an active area (about 20 × 20 mm2) then dried and converted to polyimide 3a by successive heating under vacuum at 100 °C for 30 min, 150 °C for 30 min, and then 250 °C for 30 min. A gel electrolyte based on PMMA (Mw: 120000) and LiClO4 was plasticized with propylene carbonate to form a highly transparent and conductive gel. PMMA (1 g) was dissolved in dry acetonitrile (5 g), and LiClO4 (0.1 g) was added to the polymer solution as a supporting electrolyte. Then, propylene carbonate (1.5 g) was added as a plasticizer. The mixture was then slowly heated until gelation. The gel electrolyte was spread on the polymer-coated side of the electrode, and the electrodes were sandwiched. Finally, a transparent epoxy resin was used to seal the device.
Measurements
Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720 FT-IR spectrometer. Elemental analyses were run in a Heraeus VarioEL III CHNS elemental analyzer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance 500 FT-NMR system with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The inherent viscosities were determined with a Cannon-Fenske viscometer at 30 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experiments were carried out on approximately 4–6 mg of samples heated in flowing nitrogen or air (flow rate = 40 cm3 min−1) at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. DSC analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 DSC at a scan rate of 20 °C min−1 in flowing nitrogen. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the polymer films were recorded on an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with a CHI 750A electrochemical analyzer using ITO as a working electrode (the coating area of the polymer film is approximately 1 cm2, 0.8 cm × 1.25 cm) and a platinum wire as an auxiliary electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 against a Ag/AgCl reference electrode in acetonitrile (CH3CN) or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Voltammograms are presented with the positive potential pointing to the left and with increasing anodic currents pointing downwards. Spectroelectrochemical experiments were carried out in a cell built from a commercial UV-visible cuvette using an Agilent 8453 UV-visible diode array spectrophotometer. The cell was composed of a 1 cm cuvette, ITO as a working electrode, a platinum wire as an auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Color measurements were performed by using Konica Minolta CS-100A ChromaMeter with viewing geometry as recommended by Commision Internationale de I'Eclairage.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
PPIs 3a and 3′a were prepared by the polycondensation reactions of diamines 1 and 1′ with pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA; 2a) via a conventional two-step process, that is, the formation of a poly(amic acid) and subsequent thermal or chemical imidization (Scheme 1). The poly(amic acid) precursors of 3a and 3′a had inherent viscosities of 1.11 and 1.36 dL g−1 in DMAc (Table 1) and could be cast into flexible and tough poly(amic acid) films, which could be subsequently converted into tough polyimide films by extended heating at elevated temperatures. The poly(amic acid) precursor also could be chemically dehydrated to the polyimide by treatment with acetic anhydride and pyridine. PNIs 3b and 3′b were prepared by a one-pot, high-temperature solution polymerization of diamine 1 and 1′ and 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA; 2b) in m-cresol at 180 °C in the presence of isoquinoline as a catalyst. A tough, fiber-like precipitate was formed when the resulting polymer solution was trickled into methanol (see the photo shown in Scheme 1). PNIs 3b and 3′b exhibited inherent viscosities of 0.51 and 0.60 dL g−1, respectively, in m-cresol. All the polyimides could afford flexible and tough films via solution casting, indicating that they are high molecular weight polymers. The structures of these polyimides were confirmed with elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy (Fig. 1). PPIs 3a and 3′a gave two characteristic bands at around 1780 and 1732 cm−1 (imide asymmetric and symmetric stretching), whereas PNIs 3b and 3′b showed the imide absorptions at lower wavenumbers around 1718 and 1675 cm−1 due to a less strained six-membered imide ring.

The thermal properties of the polyimides were investigated by TGA and DSC techniques. Typical TGA curves for PPIs 3a and 3′a are reproduced in Fig. 2 and the thermal behavior data of all polyimides are summarized in the Table 2. These polyimides exhibited good thermal stability with no remarkable weight loss up to 500 °C in nitrogen or in air. Their decomposition temperatures (Td) at a 10% weight-loss in nitrogen and air were recorded at 525–596 and 472–582 °C, respectively. The carbonized residue (char yield) of the polymers was more than 50% at 800 °C in the nitrogen atmosphere, ascribed to their high aromatic content. As shown in Fig. 2, polyimide 3′a exhibited a higher Td value in comparison with 3a because of the decreased conformational flexibility caused by the introduction of planar carbazole groups in the repeat unit. Judged from the baseline shift on the DSC thermograms (Fig. 3), PPIs 3a and 3′a exhibited high glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of 334 and 318 °C, respectively. However, PNIs 3b and 3′b did not show discernible glass transitions by DSC, possibly due to the highly rigid nature of their backbones. The thermal analysis results revealed that these polyimides exhibited excellent thermal stability, which in turn is beneficial to increase the service time in device application and enhance the morphological stability to the spin-coated films.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of the polyimides were investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy. Fig. 4 shows the UV-vis absorption profiles of these polyimide films, and the relative data are listed in Table 3. These polymers exhibited strong absorption bands at λmax = 298 and 310–315 nm, attributed to the π–π* transitions of the carbazole and other π-conjugated moieties in the polymer backbone, with absorption edges (λonset) at 407–452 nm corresponding to optical band gaps of 2.74–3.04 eV. As shown in Fig. 4b, the strong absorption bands at ca. 345–382 nm might have been resulted from the naphthalimide-based π–π* transitions.

The electrochemical behavior of each polyimide was investigated by CV using a conventional three-electrode cell assembly. The CV diagrams of all the polyimides are depicted in Fig. 5, and quantitative details are also summarized in Table 3. All the polyimides underwent a reversible two-electron oxidation and reduction, revealing their high electrochemical stability for both p- and n-doping (ambipolar) processes. The redox waves observed during the anodic sweep can be attributed to the formation of radical cations and dications originated from the oxidation processes of the TPPA and CzTPA units (Scheme 2). The significant difference between the first and second oxidations clearly indicates a strong electronic coupling between the two amino centers in both TPPA and CzTPA units. It is also worth noting that the TPPA-based polyimides 3a and 3b reveal a lower oxidation potential (E1/2Ox1 = 0.74, 0.65 V and E1/2Ox2 = 1.10, 1.03 V) compared to the CzTPA-based polyimides 3′a and 3′b (E1/2Ox1 = 0.99 V and E1/2Ox2 = 1.27, 1.33 V). This could be attributed to the fact that the lone pair electrons of the nitrogen atom of a carbazole prefer to localize within the coplanar ring, making the oxidation potentials of the CzTPA unit higher than those of the TPPA unit.

 Scheme 2  Proposed redox chemistry of polyimides 3a and 3′b. 
The CV diagrams of PPIs 3a and 3′a (Fig. 5a and c) show that the pyromellitimide groups underwent two quasi-reversible one-electron reductions, which occurred at Epc = −0.75 to −0.80 and −1.35 V. The first reduction corresponds to formation of radical anions, and the second reduction relates to formation of dianions.15b PNIs 3b and 3′b (Fig. 5b and d) displayed two redox couples at more positive potentials than those of PPIs 3a and 3′a, similar to that reported in the literature.15b The extended aromatic fused ring will increase the resonance energy and delocalize the negative charge more effectively. Therefore, the first one-electron reduction potentials of PNIs 3b and 3′b are less negative than those of PPIs 3a and 3′a. The proposed sequential oxidation and reduction reactions for the generation of cationic and anionic species of polyimides 3a and 3′b are shown in Scheme 2. The dianion form of polyimide 3′b is represented by reduced cis-carbonyls. It can also be represented by reduced trans-carbonyls, but this requires the loss of aromaticity in the naphthalene unit.14a
The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the corresponding polymers were estimated from the E1/2Ox1 and E1/2Red1 values. Assuming that the HOMO energy level for the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) standard is 4.80 eV with respect to the zero vacuum level, the HOMO and LUMO values for these polyimides were calculated to be in the range of 5.01–5.35 eV and 3.66–3.86 eV, respectively.
Spectroelectrochemical and electrochromic properties
The electro-optical properties of the polymer films were investigated using the changes in electronic absorption spectra at various applied voltages. For these investigations, the polyimide film was cast on an ITO-coated glass slide (a piece that fit in the UV-vis cuvette), and a homemade electrochemical cell was built from a commercial UV-vis cuvette. The cell was placed in the optical path of the sample light beam in a commercial diode array spectrophotometer. This procedure allowed us to obtain electronic absorption spectra under potential control in a 0.1 M Bu4NClO4/acetonitrile or DMF solution. The results of the PPI 3a film upon oxidation and reduction are presented in Fig. 6 as a series of UV-vis-NIR absorption curves correlated with electrode potentials. In the neutral form the film exhibited a strong band at 317 nm characteristic of π–π* transitions, but it was almost transparent in the visible and NIR regions. The band gap of polymer 3a was calculated as 2.74 eV from the onset of the π–π* transition at 452 nm. Upon electro-oxidation of the 3a film (increasing applied voltage from 0 to 0.9 V), the absorption of π–π* transition at 317 nm gradually decreased while a new absorption peak at 414 nm and a broadband having its maximum around 886 nm in the NIR region grew up. We attribute this spectral change to the formation of a stable monocation radical from the TPPA moiety. The absorption band in the NIR region is assigned to an intervalence charge-transfer (IV-CT) between states in which the positive charge is centered at different amino centers.10 Upon further oxidation at applied voltages to 1.5 V, the intensity of the IV-CT band gradually decreased, with a formation of a new strong absorption band centered at about 685 nm. We attribute these spectral changes to the formation of a stable dication of the TPPA moiety. The observed electronic absorption changes in the film of 3a at various potentials are fully reversible and are associated with strong color changes; indeed, they even can be seen readily by the naked eye. From the photos shown in Fig. 6a, it can be seen that the film changed from a transmissive neutral state (nearly colorless; L*, 90; a*, 1; b*, 1) to a highly absorbing semi-oxidized state (yellow; L*, 61; a*, −2; b*, 11 and green; L*, 43; a*, −6; b*, 4) and a fully oxidized state (blue; L*, 38; a*, −8; b*, −4). Fig. 6b and c show the spectral changes of the 3a film upon reduction. The radical anion 3a−, which appears at potentials between −0.5 and −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, exhibits a strong band at 330 nm and two peaks in the visible region (a stronger band at 724 nm together with a weaker one at 657 nm). As shown in the inset of Fig. 6b, the radical anion form of PPI 3a is pale green (L*, 65; a*, −6; b*, −3) in color. Further reduction at potentials below −1.4 V results in the two-electron reduced (dianion) state with a new peak at 564 nm, and the film turns to a red-violet (L*, 54; a*, 25; b*, −18) color during the second reduction (Fig. 6c). The spectral changes associated with the reduction reactions of the pyromellitimde unit are very similar to that of standard PMDA–ODA polyimide (ODA: 4,4′-oxydianiline) reported by Mazur et al.15a This result reaffirms that the diamine residue has very little direct influence on the reduction of the diimide moiety as reported in the literature.7e,15a

The photographs show the color change of the film on an ITO electrode at indicated potentials. 
Similarly, PNIs 3′b also showed a multi-colored electrochromic behavior upon electron oxidation or reduction. Fig. 7 shows the spectral and coloration changes of the 3′b film upon electrochemical oxidation and reduction. In the neutral form, PNIs 3′b exhibited strong absorption between 300 and 400 nm, but it was almost transparent in the visible and near IR (NIR) regions. Upon oxidation of the 3′b film (increasing electrode potential from 0 to 1.2 V), the intensity of the absorption band at 382 nm gradually increased while a new broadband from 800 nm extended to the NIR region grew up. Since the potentials examined are similar to the first anodic process, the spectral changes are assigned to the radical cation formation arising from the oxidation of CzTPA unit. The absorption band in the NIR region may be attributed to an intervalence charge transfer (IV-CT) between states in which the positive charge is centered at different amino centers (TPA and carbazole). Meanwhile, the color of the film changed from nearly colorless to yellow green. Upon further oxidation at applied voltages to 1.5 V, corresponding to the second stage oxidation, the dication (bipolaron) band at 736 nm formed, respectively. Concurrently, the IV-CT band decreased in intensity during this process and these films color turned deep blue (as shown in Fig. 7c). Fig. 7 shows the spectral changes of the 3′b film upon electro-reduction (n-doping). Applying a potential negative to −1.0 V resulted in a modest change in the absorption spectrum. The absorbance at 382 nm dropped, and a new absorption band at 458 nm arose with a concomitant color change of the film to orange-yellow. The spectral change is assigned to the radical dianion formation arising from the reduction of the naphthalimide unit. The surface plot diagram for the absorbance–wavelength–applied potential correlations of PNI 3′b film is presented in Fig. 7c. The L*a*b* values of the colors were also determined to allow color matching. Colors and L*a*b* coordinates of all the polyimide films at various redox states are summarized in Fig. 8. As the polymer film is p- or n-doped, a strong color change occurs and the L* value decreases because a more opaque film is formed. These multicolored electrochromic behaviors suggest that the novel TPPA- and CzTPA-based polyimides have great potential for electrochromic applications.

Fabrication and performance of electrochromic devices
On the basis of the foregoing results, it can be concluded that these polyimides can be used in the construction of electrochromic devices. Therefore, we fabricated as preliminary investigations single layer elecrochromic cells (Fig. 9a). As a typical example, an electrochromic cell using the cast film of PPI 3a as the electroactive layer was fabricated. The polymer film was pale yellow in the neutral state. When the applied voltage was increased to 2.0 V and 2.5 V, the color changed to green and deep blue, respectively, the same as was already observed for the solution spectroelectrochemistry experiments. The corresponding UV-vis transmittance spectra are shown in Fig. 9b. When potential square-wave cycles (−2.0 ↔ +2.0 V) were applied to the 3a film as shown in Fig. 10, the film exhibited a high contrast of the optical transmittance change (ΔT%) up to 85% at 940 nm (for the green coloring). The color switching time is defined as the time required for reaching 90% of the full change in % transmittance after the switching potential, since the naked eye cannot distinguish the color change after this point. The switching time is 5.5 s for coloration and only 1.5 s for bleaching. Fig. 10 also shows a very small change of ΔT% with increasing potential square-wave cycling numbers, indicating high stability of the polymer film upon oxidation. When the switching potential was set between −2.5 and +2.5 V, the electrochromic device (ECD) required 4.0 s for deep-blue coloring and 2.0 s for bleaching with initial ΔT% up to 89% (Fig. 11). However, the loss of ΔT% with increasing potential square-wave cycling numbers is larger than that found in the first oxidation process (the green coloring), indicating a slight decrease of stability in the fully oxidized state of this polymer film. The injected/extracted charge (Q) per unit electrode area was calculated by integration of the current density and time obtained from Fig. 10 and 11. Coloration efficiency (CE; η) is defined as measurement of the power efficiency of the electrochromic devices and can be calculated via optical density using the equation η = ΔOD/Q,2g where Q is the injected/extracted charge per unit electrode area (mC cm−2) and ΔOD is the change in absorbance at a specific wavelength maximum during a redox step. The electrochromic coloring efficiency (CE) of green (η = ΔOD940/Q) and deep-blue coloring (η = ΔOD760/Q) of the EDC were calculated to be 263 cm2 C−1 and 224 cm2 C−1, respectively.

In addition, a flexible all-polymeric ECD was also fabricated (Fig. 12). PPI 3a was spray-coated onto an ITO-coated PET slide and then dried. Afterwards, the gel electrolyte was spread on the polymer coated side of the electrode and the electrodes were sandwiched under atmospheric conditions. To prevent leakage, an epoxy resin was applied to seal the device. Upon increasing the potential from 0 V to 2.0 V and then to 2.5 V, the color of the device changes from pale yellow to yellowish green and then to deep blue, the same as was already observed for the ECD on the glass substrate. The color change is uniform, as can be seen in Fig. 13 where the letters NTUT were written by spraying-coating 3a solution over a stencil. The neutral state is pale yellow, while the oxidized states are yellowish green and deep blue. We believe that optimization could further improve the device performance and fully explore the potential of these multicolored electrochromic polyimides.

Conclusions
We have successfully prepared four bis(triarylamine)-containing redox-active polyimides and demonstrated that these polymers show high Tg, ambipolar and multicolored electrochromic behavior. Electrochemical and spectral results showed that these polymers can be employed as potential anodically and cathodically coloring materials in the development of electrochromic devices. Electrochromic devices made from the PPI 3a coated on glass or the PET substrate were successfully fabricated. The solid ECD presented a stable as well as multicolor electrochromic change from pale yellow to green and then to deep blue. Their environmental friendliness, easy preparation, abundant color, fast electrochromic switching at low voltages, along with their stability under atmospheric conditions, made the polyimides good candidates for ECDs.
