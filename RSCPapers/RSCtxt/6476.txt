    , Accepted 17th April 2020First published on 23rd April 2020AbstractIt is challenging to fabricate a simultaneously high-performance and stable Sn-based perovskite device owing to the inferiority of the Sn-based perovskite film and the rapid oxidation of Sn2+. Herein, a simple approach was employed and involved introducing an additive of aminoguanidine hydrochloride (NH2GACl) into a perovskite precursor solution to prepare efficient Sn-based perovskite solar cells. A higher film quality was obtained, due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonding between halide ions in the perovskite and NH2GACl, which helped to passivate the defects and lessen the rate of Sn2+ oxidation. Also, the addition of NH2GACl was indicated to effectively adjust the energy level alignment between Sn-based perovskite and the adjacent layer, with this adjustment facilitating the charge transport. The perovskite device modified with NH2GACl achieved a power conversion efficiency of up to 7.3%, and retained 90% of its initial efficiency after 30 days in a nitrogen glovebox without being encapsulated.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have in the past few years become a hot research topic because of their remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCE), low cost and facile fabrication processes.1,2 Recently, lead (Pb)-based PVSCs delivering a record PCEs of over 25.2% have been developed. However, the toxicity of Pb severely impedes the commercial applications of such PVSCs, and hence the development of PVSCs that are free of Pb or that have little Pb is in high demand.3,4 Other environmentally friendly elements, such as Sn, Ge, Bi, and Sb, have been proposed to replace Pb.5–12 Sn-based perovskites are in particular potentially promising candidates for use in solar cells due to their narrower optical bandgaps and higher charge-carrier mobilities than those of Pb-based perovskites.13,14 Unfortunately, it is challenging to fabricate compact and highly crystalline Sn-based perovskite films.15 In addition, Sn-based PVSCs suffer from the rapid oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ upon their exposure to air or even a trace amount of oxygen in a glove box, resulting in Sn vacancies in the perovskite lattice.16 For these reasons, Sn-based PVSCs exhibit inferior device photovoltaic performances (especially low open-circuit voltage (VOC) and poor environmental stability levels).17 In an attempt to improve their PCE and stability levels, extensive methods have been directed to passivate the defects of the Sn-perovskite films. Relatively recently, a few organic molecules containing the –NH2 functional group, including butylammonium (BA+),18 phenylethylammonium (PEA+),19 guanidinium (GA+),20 and 5-ammoniumvaleric acid (5-AVA+),21 have also been used to optimize the perovskite device performance. For instance, PEAI has been shown to be able to simultaneously improve the crystallinity of perovskite films and reduce the Sn4+ content with an efficiency of up to 9.0%.19 Furthermore, GA+ was incorporated in a formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) perovskite to adjust the energy levels of the perovskite layer, and achieved a record PCE of 9.6% with superior stability.20 In addition to ammonium cations, the chlorine anion has been shown to have a positive influence on the morphological evolution of perovskite films.21–23 GACl has been employed in Pb-based PVSCs as an additive to optimize the quality of the perovskite film,21 but there has been no report to the best of our knowledge about the application of GACl in Sn-based PVSCs.
In this work, an aminoguanidine hydrochloride (NH2GACl) additive was introduced into an Sn-based perovskite. The GA cation has been reported to serve as a cross-linker between neighbouring perovskite grains, with this function of GA due to its containing ammonium groups.24 Bulky organic cations with multiple ammonium functional groups could form relatively strong interactions with the Sn–I frameworks and suppress the formation of pinholes during film fabrication.20 Hence, in our work, NH2GACl effectively produced a passivation effect on the perovskite by forming hydrogen bonds with the perovskite, which apparently reduced the number of defects states in the Sn-perovskite film and impeded the oxidation of Sn2+. In this way, charge transport was improved, resulting in an increased PCE and better stability.
Results and discussion
NH2GACl samples of various concentrations were added into respective PEA0.1FA0.9SnI3-based perovskite precursor solutions. As shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†), NH2GACl additive was distributed homogeneously throughout each resulting perovskite film. The morphologies of the perovskite films (with or without NH2GACl) were visualized by acquiring scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. Fig. 1 and Fig. S3 (ESI†) show SEM micrographs of the tops and cross-sections of perovskite films that we produced. For the pristine perovskite films, rough surfaces with small grains (with dimensions of approximately 135 nm on average) were observed (Fig. 1a), features detrimental to device performance.25 By comparison, introducing a small quantity, specifically 0.02 mol (Fig. S1a, ESI†) or 0.05 mol (Fig. 1b), of NH2GACl exerted a positive effect on the morphology of the perovskite film. A compact perovskite film containing relatively large grains (with dimensions of 246 nm on average) was obtained by adding 0.05 mol of NH2GACl (Fig. 1b), and these features were also clearly observed in the cross-sectional SEM images of the devices (Fig. 1c and d). Cracks were observed in the perovskite films with a high amount (0.1 mol) of NH2GACl (Fig. S1b, ESI†), with these cracks attributed to excess NH2GACl having weakened its otherwise positive effect on the perovskite film morphology. Furthermore, AFM images of the perovskite films were acquired to calculate their root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values (Fig. S4, ESI†). The pristine film displayed a rough surface, specifically with a roughness value of 18.9 nm. In contrast, including NH2GACl apparently helped make a smoother perovskite film, with this film showing a reduced roughness of 12.7 nm. The better morphology of the perovskite film modified with NH2GACl could be attributed to strong interactions between the ammonium (–NH2) functional groups and the Sn–I frameworks, with such stronger interactions apparently favorable for charge transport.24,26

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the perovskite films with and without NH2GACl additive were taken to further confirm the crystallinity (Fig. S5a, ESI†). Strong diffraction signals were found at 2θ = 14.0° and 28.3°, corresponding to the (100) and (200) lattice planes, respectively. Other weaker peaks were observed at 24.4°, 31.6°, 40.3°, and 43.0°, and were assigned to the (120), (211), (222) and (300) planes, in agreement with previous reports.19 The peaks at 14.0° and 28.3° derived from the perovskite films including 0.02 and 0.05 mol NH2GACl were stronger than the corresponding peaks of the pristine film. Furthermore, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (100) plane peak (Fig. S5b, ESI†) decreased from 0.270° for the pristine film to 0.242°, 0.241°, and 0.256° for the films with 0.02 mol, 0.05 mol, and 0.1 mol NH2GACl, respectively. The Scherrer equation was employed to calculate the crystallite sizes for the perovskite films. These calculations showed that the crystallite sizes increased from 127 nm for the pristine film to 175 nm, 238 nm and 161 nm for the 0.02 mol, 0.05 mol, and 0.1 mol NH2GACl films, respectively. These results indicated that adding a moderate amount of NH2GACl can increase the crystallinity of the perovskite film, consistent with the SEM measurements.27 Besides the crystallinity, a similar improvement was predicted based on photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Steady-state PL spectroscopy and time-resolved PL (Tr-PL) decay tests of the perovskite films on glass were performed to further verify the quality and excited-state properties of the films. As shown in Fig. 2a, the perovskite films with NH2GACl showed a stronger PL peak than the pristine film, which resulted from the fewer pinholes in and higher quality of the modified perovskite films. The pristine perovskite film exhibited a short carrier lifetime of 8.15 ns (Fig. 2b). By comparison, the perovskite films with NH2GACl showed a longer carrier lifetime of 12.06 ns, which could reduce the recombination of carriers and facilitate charge transport.21,28 In addition, the surface potential was measured by using Kelvin-probe force microscopy (KPFM) to prove the effects of NH2GACl on surface defect passivation of perovskite films.29 As shown in Fig. 2c, the perovskite films modified with NH2GACl yielded a higher surface potential (17.90 mV) than did the pristine film (8.29 mV), indicating the reduced quantity of surface defects and enhanced hole transport of the modified films, which further lessened the opportunity for recombination to occur. To further investigate the effects of NH2GACl passivation on the charge-carrier mobility and trap-state density levels on the perovskite films, the hole mobility was measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. 2d). The Mott–Gurney law equation J = 9/8εε0μV2/L3 was used to estimate the mobility.30 The hole mobility of the NH2GACl-modified perovskite device was in this way calculated to be 3.42 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was higher than that of the pristine device (2.52 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, to calculate the trap-state density, we applied the equation26  in which ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite film (∼34, determined using impedance spectroscopy), VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit region, q is the elemental charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film. The calculated trap density decreased from 7.12 × 1016 cm−3 to 6.11 × 1016 cm−3 in the perovskite layer after NH2GACl was introduced. The increased charge carrier mobility and reduced trap state density was mainly attributed to the passivation effect of the NH2GACl molecule, which helped to decrease charge recombination and increase the FF.

To evaluate the antioxidation ability of NH2GACl, perovskite precursor solutions with and without NH2GACl additive were prepared and then exposed to ambient air. The color of each precursor solution changed, with time, from yellow to red after being exposed to air, due to the rapid oxidation of Sn2+ in the presence of oxygen.31 As shown in Fig. 3a, the pristine precursor solution turned rapidly orange after 5 minutes in air. However, it took 20 minutes for the precursor solution containing the NH2GACl additive to become orange, which demonstrated that NH2GACl could slow down the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in the precursor solution.32 Besides, perovskite films were also prepared for XRD examination to assess their stability levels under ambient conditions (humidity: ∼60%; temperature: ∼25 °C). The characteristic (100) plane peak almost disappeared and the signal corresponding to SnI2 (2θ = 12.5°) appeared in the XRD patterns of the pristine perovskite film after being exposed to air for 10 hours (Fig. 3b), which indicated that the perovskite film almost entirely decomposed. In contrast, the (100) plane peak was still clearly observed for the NH2GACl-modified perovskite film under the same condition (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, the pristine perovskite film changed from black to red after 4 h, while it took 6 h for the perovskite film with NH2GACl additive to become red, further implying that the rate of oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ was reduced by NH2GACl. In order to quantitatively determine the relative amounts of Sn2+ and Sn4+ in the films, XPS measurements were taken. As shown in Fig. S6a and b (ESI†), the Sn (3d) band in each of the different samples was deconvoluted into two components, which corresponded to Sn2+ (486.6 eV) and Sn4+ (487.4 eV).33 The perovskite film with NH2GACl additive contained less Sn4+ (2.2%) than the pristine perovskite film (6.6%), confirming the ability of NH2GACl to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, which was in accordance with the results of the tests described above.34 As reported, the –NH2 of NH2GACl allowed six hydrogen bonds to form with neighboring iodine ions of exposed SnI64− in the perovskite crystals, and in this way effectively enhanced the perovskite stability. Hence, NH2GACl with the ammonium ions was expected to passivate the oxidation of Sn2+, with a suppressed formation of Sn vacancies. Moreover, the NH2GACl-passivated perovskite film was more hydrophobic, according to its observed increased contact angles, than the pristine film (Fig. S6c, ESI†), and this greater hydrophobicity was beneficial for the moisture stability of the perovskite devices.

Based on the above-described results, a possible mechanism for the passivation effect of NH2GACl was derived, and a diagrammatic sketch of this mechanism is displayed in Fig. 4a. To probe the interaction between NH2GACl and perovskite, 1H NMR measurements of solutions of NH2GACl, perovskite, and an NH2GACl-perovskite mixture, each in deuterated N,N-dimethylformamide-d7 (DMF-d7) solvent, were taken (Fig. S7, ESI†). Resonance signals due to the –NH3+ group appeared at δ = 7.67 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra of the NH2GACl solution and at δ = 7.25 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra of the solution of the mixture of NH2GACl and perovskite. Compared with the chloride ions, the less-electronegative iodide anions can inductively extract less electron density out of the hydrogens, thus leading to an upfield shift in the resonance signals.35 Consequently, the N–H hydrogen signal underwent an upfield shift of 0.42 ppm, suggesting that the hydrogen-bonding interaction between this ammonium end group and halide ions had changed from N–H/Cl− to N–H/I−. Through this interaction, the passivation effect of the NH2GACl molecule was realized, and it enhanced the morphology and stability of the perovskite film.

(c) J–V curves of the PVSCs with various contents of NH2GACl. 
Energy level diagrams of the PVSCs are displayed in Fig. 4b. The valence band maximum (VBM) values were determined from analyses of the results of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (Fig. S8a, ESI†), and the conduction band (CB) values were derived on the VBM with the corresponding optical bandgap. The optical bandgap was calculated from the absorption spectra in Fig. S8b (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4b, the perovskite films containing 0.05 mol NH2GACl were observed to have a more favorable energy level alignment with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of PEDOT:PSS, which was expected to reduce the energy barrier at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface and thus suppress interface recombination.5,36 Finally, J–V curves of the PVSCs with different concentrations of NH2GACl were acquired (Fig. 4c) and the values of the corresponding parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The pristine PVSCs showed a low PCE of 4.92%. In contrast, the best PCE (7.30%) and higher JSC and VOC values were obtained upon adding NH2GACl (0.05 mol). (The device active area was 0.04 cm2.) The increased JSC stemmed from the morphological enhancement in the perovskite film with fewer Sn vacancy defects and better charge transport. Moreover, the increased VOC value was attributed to the favorable energy level alignments between the hole transport and perovskite layer.37 However, the electron transport layer (PCBM) was probably not the best electron transport layer, with an imperfect lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, resulting in a low VOC.38 Therefore, to improve the VOC, a more suitable electron transport layer with a shallower energy level can be selected, for example, indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA), which would allow for a larger maximum attainable voltage and suppress remote iodide doping to reduce recombination of interface carriers. The PCE dropped rapidly with addition of excess NH2GACl (0.1 mol), which was ascribed to the unfavorable morphology of these perovskite films. So far, the photovoltaic performances of currently available Sn-perovskite solar cells have been reported to be relatively poor, due to the poor quality of Sn-perovskite films and the oxidation of Sn2+. Therefore, all of the present studies have involved using small-area devices (Table S2, ESI†). We have tried fabricating devices with larger areas. But it is very difficult to prepare high-quality tin-based perovskite films on a large scale, as such attempts have resulted in poorer photovoltaic performance and poor repeatability.
In order to investigate the hysteresis phenomena of these perovskite devices, their J–V curves were acquired, as shown in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. A smaller hysteresis effect was observed for the perovskite devices modified with NH2GACl than for the pristine device. The device statistics for 20 devices is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Compared to the pristine device, those incorporating NH2GACl revealed generally better device parameters and better reproducibility. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of the PVSCs were also determined (Fig. 5b), and the integrated JSC values of the pristine and NH2GACl-modified devices were 15.32 and 19.07 mA cm−2, with <5% deviation. The significant improvement in the EQE of the perovskite device modified with NH2GACl could mainly be attributed to its efficient charge transport. In addition, the steady-state photocurrent and power output were measured at the maximum power point (Fig. S10, ESI†), and were close to the obtained JSC and PCE values. As shown in Fig. 5c, the dark current density of the device incorporating NH2GACl was lower than that of the pristine device, indicating that more charge carriers passed through the device.39 Furthermore, to further realize an understanding of the charge-carrier recombination details, VOC and JSC values were determined for various illumination intensities and are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). In general, the closer the slope is to 1 kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T stands for the absolute temperature and q represents the elementary charge), the lower is the extent of the trap-assisted recombination. As shown in Fig. S11a (ESI†), the NH2GACl-modified device showed a lower slope (1.04 kT/q) than did the pristine device (1.34 kT/q), and this lower slope confirmed its lower extent of trap-assisted recombination under open-circuit conditions.40 Moreover, the power law dependence of JSC on the light intensity can be expressed as JSC = Iα; the α value of the NH2GACl-incorporated device (0.96) was closer to 1 than was that of the pristine device (0.95), implying that the rate of bimolecular recombination of the NH2GACl-modified perovskite was reduced due to its higher quality (Fig. S11b, ESI†).41 Therefore, the device based on NH2GACl-modified perovskite exhibited higher VOC and FF values than the pristine device. The long-term stability of a PVSC is a major concern for commercialization. Long-term stability levels of the complete PVSCs in a nitrogen glove box and in the ambient environment (temperature ≈ 25 °C, humidity ≈ 60%), respectively, were determined. As shown in Fig. 5d, the PCE of the modified device retained 90% of its initial efficiency after being stored in the nitrogen glove box for 30 days. In contrast, the pristine device degraded dramatically after 30 days, showing just 64% of the original PCE value. The error bars here were obtained from the data from ten cells. Fig. S12 (ESI†) shows the degradation of photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC and FF). In addition, the unencapsulated PVSCs doped with NH2GACl also showed better stability (72% of the original) than the pristine device (25%) after 100 minutes under ambient conditions (Fig. S13, ESI†). The improved stability was attributed to the inhibition of oxygen penetration into perovskite films with favourable morphology.

Experimental
Device fabrication
A PEDOT:PSS (Clevios VP AI 4083) hole transport layer was spin-coated onto each of the ITO substrates and then annealed at 140 °C for 15 min in air. The perovskite film was deposited by using a solution made by dissolving 0.90 M FAI (≥99.5%), 0.1 M PEAI (>98%), 1 M SnI2 (99.999%), and 0.1 M SnF2 (>99%) in a mixed solvent of DMSO (anhydrous, ≥99.9%) and DMF (anhydrous, 99.8%), (1:4, v/v) at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The addition of SnF2 into the perovskite precursor solution resulted in a decrease in the rate of oxidation of Sn2+ and increased the energy of formation of Sn vacancies. NH2GACl samples (>99%) of different concentrations (0.02 mol, 0.05 mol, and 0.1 mol) were added into respective Sn-perovskite precursor solution samples. Chlorobenzene was rapidly pipetted for anti-solvent treatment during the spin-coating process. The perovskite films were then annealed at 65 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, PCBM/chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1) and PEI/isopropyl alcohol (0.1 wt%) solutions were employed at spin-coating speeds of 2000 rpm for 30 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. Finally, a 100 nm-thick layer of Ag was deposited by carrying out thermal evaporation to complete the device.
Characterization
A Keithley 2400 apparatus was used to acquire the current density–voltage (J–V) curves. The currents were measured under a solar simulator (Enli Tech, 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G irradiation). The light intensity was calibrated by means of a KG-5 Si diode with a solar simulator (Enli Tech, Taiwan). Devices were stored and tested in the nitrogen-filled glove box. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (SU8020) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (MultiMode 8-HR (Bruker)) images were recorded to study the morphologies of the perovskite films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were acquired by using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-B). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra were acquired by using a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence (Tr-PL) spectra were acquired by using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrometer. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was performed in nanoscope multimode (Bruker). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were taken using an ESCALAB 250 XPS with an Al (Kα) X-ray source (1486.6 eV). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data were collected using a Thermo Fisher Scientific apparatus with the He I (21.22 eV) emission line. All of the experiments for unencapsulated Sn-perovskite films were carried out under ambient conditions.
Conclusions
In summary, NH2GACl was introduced into an Sn-based perovskite as an additive to improve the device performance and long-term stability, and did so successfully. The incorporation of NH2GACl not only efficiently improved the quality of perovskite film with decreased trap density and decreased recombination of carriers, but also significantly tuned the energy level of the perovskite layer to facilitate the charge transport. In addition, NH2GACl impeded the oxidation of Sn2+ by suppressing the formation of Sn vacancies. As a result, the PCE of the PVSC was considerably improved, from 4.72% to 7.3%, by including the NH2GACl. And including the NH2GACl also increased the stability of the device, to 90% of the initial PCE retained after the device was stored unencapsulated in a glove box for 30 days. Hence, this work provides a simple route for the fabrication of efficient Sn-based PVSCs.
