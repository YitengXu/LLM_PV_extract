    , Accepted 21st June 2021First published on 21st June 2021AbstractA self-supported dual-cation (Mo,Cu) co-doped Ni2P@ nickel foam catalyst (Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF) has been prepared, and the co-doped samples can distort the lattice and expose a larger specific surface area, which provides more reaction locations, and exhibit an efficient water splitting performance.
With the continuous development of novel power generation methods, new energy sources such as wind power, hydropower, and solar power have been rapidly developed. These new power generation methods are environmentally friendly and sustainable, but the discontinuous nature and unpredictability greatly reduce their efficiency.1 It is a favorable choice to convert the intermediate energy into clean energy and store it in time. Based on this, electrochemical water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen is regarded as a promising approach.2,3
Transition metal phosphides have been intensively investigated toward electrochemical water splitting due to their specific electronic properties and stable structure.4 The outstanding electrocatalytic property of transition metal phosphides is ascribed to the isolated metal and non-metal atoms, which are beneficial to the adsorption of protons and hydroxide ions, respectively.5,6 Many reports show that transition metal phosphides have excellent performance in the field of electrochemical water splitting, and through reasonable structural design, the performance of transition metal phosphides can be further improved.7–9 For example, introducing defects by adding metal dopants or producing lattice vacancies can significantly increase the number of exposed active sites, resulting in a substantial increase in the catalytic performance of transition metal phosphides.10–12 Besides, due to the different atomic radii, heteroatom doping also can cause distortion of the crystal lattice, increase the exposure of active sites and regulate the electronic interactions.13,14 Thus, the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be improved to a certain extent.
Many mono-cation doped catalysts have been reported for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic property. Recently, Li developed Mo-VC@GC with a low overpotential of 198 mV at 10 mA cm−2 towards the HER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, which was ascribed to the desirable electronic structures and crystallinity regulated by Mo-doping.15 Shen reported Mo- and Fe-modified NiOOH that dramatically boosted the electrocatalytic OER activity. DFT+U calculations showed that Mo- and Fe-modified NiOOH is more stable than Fe-modified NiOOH, which contributed to better OER stability.16 Du prepared a Cu-doped Co9S8 nanorod array, which showed lower overpotentials for overall water splitting than the nanorod array without doping. The superior performance of Cu-doped Co9S8 was ascribed to the increased conductivity and water adsorption energy caused by Cu doping.17 Moreover, according to the principles of crystallography, when heteroatoms with different sizes enter the crystal lattice, it may cause lattice distortion, and these metastable structural regions can serve as the center of the catalytic reaction. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new strategies such as simultaneous incorporation of two foreign cations to continuously improve the catalytic performance.
Herein, a self-supported Mo,Cu co-doped Ni2P@NF catalyst (Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF) has been prepared by a simple hydrothermal method and low-temperature phosphorization. Since the size of the Ni ion is between that of Mo and Cu, the co-doping of Mo and Cu into Ni2P causes a strong lattice dislocation, resulting in a unique morphology of Ni2P exposing multiple active sites. Meanwhile, the introduction of Mo and Cu ions further enhances the electronic interaction and induces a more effective overall water splitting process. As expected, the Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF displays prominent catalytic performance towards both the HER (with a low overpotential of 34 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2) and OER (341 mV overpotential at a current density of 100 mA cm−2). Furthermore, when the catalyst is used as the anode and cathode in an electrolyzer, the cell voltage at 10 mA cm−2 displays a low voltage of 1.46 V for overall water splitting, which illustrates the excellent properties of the dual-cation doped catalyst.
As shown in Fig. 1, the Ni2P@NF, Mo-Ni2P@NF, Cu-Ni2P@NF and Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF catalysts were prepared through the hydrothermal method followed by low-temperature phosphorization, in which Ni foam (2.0 cm × 2.4 cm × 0.1 cm) and a mixed solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, NiCl2·6H2O, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, urea, and NH4F were used as precursors (Fig. 1). When only the Ni precursor salt exists, just Ni2P nanosheets uniformly loaded on the nickel foam can be obtained (Fig. 1a, Fig. S1a and b in the ESI†). Interestingly, when different transition metal ions are added to the reaction system, the morphology of the as-prepared samples undergoes meaningful changes. If Mo sources are added during the synthesis process, the Ni2P nanoflakes will transform to the rod-shaped Mo-doped Ni2P, which is also uniformly supported on the surface of the nickel foam (Fig. 1b, Fig. S1c and d in the ESI†). When Cu sources are added, Cu doped Ni2P nanoflowers will grow on the surface of nickel foam (Fig. 1c, Fig. S1e and f in the ESI†). Attractively, since the atomic radius of Mo is larger than that of Ni, and the atomic radius of Cu is smaller than that of Ni, when Mo and Cu are simultaneously doped into Ni2P, Ni2P nanorods uniformly covered by ultra-thin nanosheets are obtained on the surface of nickel foam (Fig. 1d, Fig. S1 g and h in the ESI†), which can further increase the specific surface area of the as-prepared sample and is conducive to exposing more active sites. In addition, Fig. S2 in the ESI† shows the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) diagrams of the as-prepared four samples, which confirm that the Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF catalyst has the largest specific surface area (98.9 m2 g−1), which is larger than those of Mo-Ni2P@NF (78.8 m2 g−1), Cu-Ni2P@NF (56.6 m2 g−1), and Ni2P@NF (14.5 m2 g−1).

The microscopic morphology of the Mo,Cu-Ni2P samples scraped from NF can be further observed through TEM investigation (Fig. 2a and b). The incorporation of Mo and Cu ions severely affects the microstructure of Ni2P. The nanosheets of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF are also covered with dense and small particles of a narrow size distribution (5.9 ± 0.7 nm) (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The corresponding high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2c displays lattice interplanar distances of 0.190 nm and 0.223 nm, which are assigned to the (2 1 0) and (1 1 1) planes of Ni2P. Noticeably, the curved lattice can be discovered in some units of the HRTEM image of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF (inset of Fig. 2c). The twisted arrangement of atoms is ascribed to the extraneous Mo,Cu ions doped into the Ni2P lattice. This rugged surfaces and atomic distortion not only increases the contact area between the catalyst and the reactants, but also supplies additional catalytic active sites for water splitting.18

By comparing the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ni2P@NF, Mo-Ni2P@NF, Cu-Ni2P@NF, and Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF samples (Fig. 2i and j), besides the characteristic peaks of NF observed (PDF: 88-2326),19 the small peaks at 40.8°, 47.3°, and 54.2° are attributed to Ni2P (PDF: 03-0953).20 Although the peaks that belong to MoP and Cu3P cannot be detected, the peaks of Ni2P shift obviously with heterogeneous element doping. As we know, Mo has larger and Cu has smaller ion sizes than Ni ions. Thus, compared to the pure Ni2P, the characteristic diffraction peak of Mo-Ni2P shifts to a lower angle, and those of Cu-Ni2P and Mo,Cu-Ni2P shift slightly to higher angles, respectively (Fig. 2j).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to survey the surface chemical composition of the Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF. The XPS spectra also identify the existence of Mo, Cu, Ni, and P (Fig. S4 in the ESI†), and the element molar ratio is Ni:Mo:Cu:P = 3:0.84:0.76:7.6. XPS results were further used to demonstrate the Mo and/or Cu modification. Fig. 3a shows the Ni 2p peaks of the as-prepared samples, in which the binding energy at 853.0 eV is assigned to Ni–P bonds (Niδ+), and the signal around 857.2 eV corresponds to Ni2+ with a satellite peak at 862.4 eV.21

Note that the peak of Niδ+ in Mo, Cu-Ni2P@NF shifts 0.26 eV to a lower binding energy, which reflects stronger electronic interaction than the mono-cation-doped samples. Noticeably, the redistribution of charge may mediate the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates on Ni2P, which is highly beneficial to the HER and OER processes. As shown in Fig. 3b, in the P 2p region, the peak at 129.7 eV is assigned to metal phosphides (Pδ−). It is clearly shown that the areas of the Pδ− and Niδ+ peaks of the co-doped sample are much smaller than those of pure Ni2P@NF and mono-doped samples, indicating the rich P vacancies induced by atomic distortion.22Fig. 3c shows the Mo 3d spectra of Mo-Ni2P@NF and Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF, and the peaks at 232.9 and 236.1 eV are assigned to Mo6+, which can be used as a universal coordination center and is conducive to the adsorption of OER intermediates, thereby enhancing the OER activity of the catalyst.15Fig. 3d presents the XPS spectra of Cu 2p, which are deconvoluted into four peaks at 935.4 eV, 955.7.0 eV, 933.0 eV, and 952.8 eV respectively, corresponding to the Cu2+ and Cu+ in Cu-Ni2P@NF.23 Interestingly, after Mo,Cu co-doping, the signal of Cu2+ completely disappears from the XPS diagram, which proves that only Cu+ exists in Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF. Since Cu3P has been reported as one of the active forms of the catalyst,24 Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF with more Cu+ species can benefit the HER and OER. According to the results of the XPS spectra, Table S1 in the ESI† lists the relative content of different active centers in the as-prepared electrocatalysts. The Mo, Cu-incorporation not only modulates the electronic environments of the metal centers, which leads to a low Niδ+ ratio and rich P vacancies, but more Mo6+ and Cu+ content can also play an important role in facilitating the electron transfer rate and promoting electrocatalytic reactions.
To reveal the electrocatalytic performance, Mo, or Cu-mono-cation doped and co-doped Ni2P@NF with different Mo/Cu ratios was measured in 1.0 M KOH solution. The stoichiometry of Mo and Cu plays an important role in the catalytic performance, and Mo0.4Cu0.4-Ni2P@NF has been evaluated as the most optimized sample among all electrocatalysts examined herein (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). The steady-state linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the HER and OER are displayed in Fig. 4 and Fig. S5 in the ESI.† Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF exhibits the best HER and OER activity, with a low overpotential of 34 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the HER, and 341 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm−2 for the OER, even better than that of the benchmark Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts, respectively. At a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF for the HER is much lower than those of Mo-Ni2P@NF (99 mV), Cu-Ni2P@NF (104 mV), and Ni2P@NF (177 mV). At a current density of 100 mA cm−2, the OER overpotential of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF is also much superior to those of Mo-Ni2P@NF (393 mV), Cu-Ni2P@NF (403 mV), and Ni2P@NF (419 mV). Thus, it can be seen that dual-cation doping can dramatically boost the electrocatalytic activity of Ni2P.

(e) Polarization curves and (f) long-term durability tests at 1.50 V of Mo,Cu-Ni2P @ NF for the overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. 
To confirm the practical applicability, the overall water splitting performance of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF is evaluated as a bifunctional electrocatalyst (Fig. 4e and f). Remarkably, in the two-electrodes of the electrolyzer, the overall reaction reached an applied potential of 1.46 V at 10 mA cm−2 (vs. RHE), which is superior to other similar bifunctional overall water splitting catalysts (Fig. 4e). Additionally, the stability was evaluated through the chronoamperometry method at 1.5 V as shown in Fig. 4f, and the electrolyzer displays a good stability of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF electrodes. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4f, obvious H2 and O2 bubbles can be discovered. The amount of H2 and O2 was also investigated using the drainage method, and both the HER and OER processes almost achieve nearly 100% faradaic efficiency (Fig. S6 in the ESI†). This significant enhancement in electrocatalysis performance of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF reflects the synergy of Mo and Cu co-doping.
Accordingly, the catalysis kinetics for water splitting of the as-prepared samples has been also examined in 1 M KOH. The Tafel slope can be fitted through the Tafel equation (η = a + blogj). η is the overpotential for the HER and OER, and b represents the Tafel slope. As shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI,† Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF displays the lowest Tafel slope of 66.32 mV dec−1 and 79.62 mV dec−1 for the HER and OER, respectively, which are both superior to those of Ni2P@NF (79.55 mV dec−1, 107.82 mV dec−1), Mo-Ni2P@NF (94.01 mV dec−1, 92.92 mV dec−1) and Cu-Ni2P@NF (97.92 mV dec−1, 93.68 mV dec−1). Such small Tafel slopes of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF deliver a promoted water splitting process and result in high HER and OER rates. These results present that the hierarchical nanostructures, rugged surfaces, and atomic distortion of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF can increase the exposure of active sites. Specifically, the incorporation of different cation ions also manipulates the electronic structure of metal phosphides, promotes electron transport, and tunes the adsorption energy of the intermediate products.
To further reveal the advanced exposure of active sites of the Mo, Cu-Ni2P@NF sample, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) has been obtained (Fig. S10 in the ESI†). The double-layer capacitances (Cdl) of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF is calculated to be 45.27 mF cm−2 for the HER, which is about 1.26, 2.43, and 6.17 times larger than those of Mo-Ni2P@NF (35.80 mF cm−2), Cu-Ni2P@NF (18.61 mF cm−2), and pure Ni2P@NF (7.34 mF cm−2), respectively. As for the OER, the Cdl of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF is also 2.21, 1.34, and 4.57 times larger than those of the corresponding samples. Meanwhile, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra (Fig. S11 in the ESI†) were further obtained to confirm that Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF possessed the lowest charge-transfer resistance (Rct) value, suggesting rapid electron transport. These results are well consistent with the order of electrocatalytic properties, and demonstrate that the dual-cation doping indeed leads to more active sites and accelerates the faradaic process. All the above results confirm the satisfactory overall water splitting performance of our rationally designed Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF in the strong alkaline electrolyte.
In order to gain a better understanding on the catalytic and durability mechanisms of the HER and OER, the Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF electrodes after stability testing are comprehensively characterized. The XRD (Fig. S12†) results show that although the Ni2P structure is still maintained, the characteristic peaks cannot obviously be observed after the HER and OER test. SEM (Fig. S13a, b and S14a, b†) and TEM (Fig. S13c, d and S14c, d†) images show that the nanosheet structure is well maintained after 20 h. The corresponding high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. S13d and S14d†) display a lattice distance of 0.223 nm, which is assigned to the (1 1 1) planes of Ni2P. XPS results show that the Ni2P is well maintained. To sum up, the results indicate that the catalyst has good stability.
Conclusions
In summary, Mo and Cu dual-doped hierarchical Ni2P@NF was successfully prepared via a facile hydrothermal process and low-temperature phosphorization. Since the size of the Ni ion is between that of Mo and Cu, the co-doping of Mo and Cu into Ni2P will cause a strong lattice dislocation, leading to changes in the morphology of Ni2P@NF and exposing multiple catalytically active sites. Such an electrocatalyst demonstrates a superior activity for the HER and OER performance. Moreover, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the cell potential of Mo,Cu-Ni2P@NF for overall water splitting is just 1.46 V at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. Considering its simplicity and availability, this strategy may provide a new choice for the design of other electrocatalysts.
