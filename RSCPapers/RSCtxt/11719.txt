    , Accepted 5th October 2012First published on 5th October 2012AbstractUsing a novel polymer (polythienothiophene-co-benzodithiophenes 7 F-20) as a donor and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester as an acceptor of bulk heterojunction, inverted organic photovoltaics (OPVs) were fabricated. Wet-chemically prepared ZnO and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) were used as buffer layers. Particularly, for PEDOT:PSS deposition, no annealing step was employed. This inverted OPV showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼7.0%, which is comparable to the hitherto reported highest efficiency of the inverted OPV with vacuum-deposited MoO3 as hole-collecting buffer layers without plasmonic enhancements. Incorporation of Au nanoparticles into PEDOT:PSS was performed for plasmonic enhancement of the electromagnetic field, whereas ZnO thin layers were deposited on ZnO using atomic layer deposition for quenching electron–hole recombination at surface defects of ZnO ripples. These additional treatments could be used for improving the performance of OPV, which ultimately resulted in a PCE of 7.9%.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) basically consist of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of donor–acceptor polymers and two electrodes and at least one of these electrodes should be transparent.1 OPV has been widely attracting attention due to the possibility of fabricating inexpensive and flexible solar energy devices.1–3 However, low stability due to fast (photo)degradation has been regarded as one of the most serious drawbacks of regular OPVs, which generally consist of transparent conducting oxide such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and Al as counter-electrodes.4,5 As an alternative to the conventional OPV structure, an inverted structure of OPV was suggested to be more resistant towards degradation, in which Ag or Au with higher work functions than that of Al can be used as a counter-electrode.6–8 Note that in the regular structure of OPV, electrons and holes are directed to the Al and transparent electrodes, whereas in the inverted OPV, the situation is the other way around.
A variety of efforts have been made for fabricating OPVs with higher performances in the past: primarily, novel low bandgap polymers as active donor materials were synthesized.9–13 As an acceptor, C60 or C71 derivatives (e.g. phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)) have been widely utilized.1 In addition, diverse polymer- and oxide-based buffers as hole- (e.g. poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), MoO3, NiO) and electron-collecting (e.g. ZnO) layers were utilized.7,14–16 As a result of all these past endeavors, OPVs with a PCE value of 7–8% and even beyond these can be nowadays fabricated.3,17,18 Not only enhancement in the PCE is an important issue, but also as many high-vacuum-processes during fabrication of OPVs as possible should be replaced by wet-chemical ones. Note that in many studies, deposition of oxide buffer layers using high-vacuum techniques has been attempted, and more recently, endeavors have been focused on replacing them by wet-chemical processes.2,19
Previously, OPV with polythienothiophene-co-benzodithiophenes (PTBx) series polymers as a donor in BHJ showed a PCE of 7–8%.9,11 It was demonstrated that introduction of F into the thienothiophene unit could increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of OPV.9 In the present work, we fabricated an inverted OPV with PTB7-F20 (purchased from Chemscitech Inc. in Canada) as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor (Fig. 1). ZnO ripples and PEDOT:PSS were used as electron- and hole-collecting layers, respectively (Fig. 1). The structural framework of PTB7-F20 is similar to those of other previously synthesized PTBx series polymers: in PTB7-F20, thienothiophene unit with and without F was mixed with a ratio of 2:8 (x = 0.2, see Fig. 1). In previously used PTBx series polymers, x is either 0 or 1, i.e. such a polymer with a mixture of fluorinated and nonfluorinated thienothiophene units is used for the first time in OPV here.9,11 We demonstrate that the use of PTB7-F20 can be promising for fabrication of highly efficient OPV. Moreover, improvement in the performance of the OPV using Au nanoparticles incorporated into PEDOT:PSS and additional ZnO thin films deposited on ZnO ripples using atomic layer deposition is shown.

2. Results and discussion
In Fig. 2, a band diagram of the inverted OPV fabricated in the present work is shown.2 For the characterization of the energy levels of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) of PTB7-F20, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used. For other materials, information on the band structures was obtained from the literature.2 It was found that the energy positions of the HOMO and LUMO of PTB7-F20 are between the respective values of PTBF0 (without F, x = 0, see Fig. 1) and PTBF1 (with F, x = 1, see Fig. 1).9
 Fig. 2  Band diagram of the inverted OPV fabricated in the present work is shown. For determining the HOMO and LUMO levels of PTB7-F20, CV was used. 
Using an inverted OPV with PTB7-F20 as a donor in the active layer in combination with ZnO ripples and PEDOT:PSS, a PCE of 7.0% could be reached (Table 1). This value is already comparable to that of the highest one of the inverted OPV without plasmonic enhancement reported in the literature so far, for which titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate) was used as electron-collecting buffer layers.7 There is another recent work, demonstrating a PCE of about 7.4% with an inverted structure of OPV.13 It is notable that in these recent studies of reaching a PCE of ∼7.3 to 7.4% using an inverted structure, MoO3, which is prepared by the vacuum-evaporation method, was used as hole-collecting layers. It should be emphasized that the use of MoO3 was avoided in the present work and wet-chemically prepared PEDOT:PSS without post-annealing was used as hole-collecting layers. Solution-based MoO3 has also been recently attempted, which resulted in a lower photovoltaic performances than that of the evaporated MoO3 layers.19 The fill-factor (FF), Voc and short-circuit current (Jsc) of our inverted OPV consisting of PTB7-F20, PEDOT:PSS and ZnO ripples were determined to be 0.663, 0.668 V and 15.763 mA cm−2, respectively (Table 1). It should be noted that polymers with x = 0 and 0.6 showed a PCE of 5.3 and 6.6%, which are lower than that of PTB7-F20.

In the recent literature, insertion of Au and Ag in buffer layers was found to result in plasmonic enhancement of the OPV performances.18,20 An attempt was also made in the present work for improving photovoltaic performances of the inverted OPV by inserting Au nanoparticles in PEDOT:PSS layers. As shown in Table 1, we found that Au nanoparticles incorporated into PEDOT:PSS layers further increased the photovoltaic performances of the inverted OPV, reaching a PCE value of 7.4%. The Voc value was independent of additional Au nanoparticles; however, the Jsc value significantly increased by Au, ultimately leading to an enhanced PCE comparing to the OPV without Au.
In Fig. 3, cross-sectional (transmission electron microscopy) TEM images of the fabricated OPV are displayed, in which an active layer thickness of about 100 nm can be identified. PEDT:PSS layers are much thinner (∼10 nm) than that of active layers so that this can only be discriminated in a magnified image (Fig. 3b). In Fig. 3b, Au nanoparticles incorporated into the PEDOT:PSS layers can clearly be identified. The PEDOT:PSS layer thickness is comparable to the size of Au nanoparticles used in the present work. Au nanoparticles mixed with the PEDOT:PSS layer are directly adjacent to the active layer. Therefore, light harvesting efficiency of the active layers can be increased by the plasmonic enhancement effect of Au nanoparticles.

For shedding light on the origin of the Au-induced enhancement in the performance of OPV, we used Raman spectroscopy for OPVs with and without Au nanoparticles (Fig. 4). The features between 1400 and 1600 cm−1 can be attributed to the hydrocarbon framework of PTB7-F20 + PC71BM/PEDOT:PSS, e.g. the pronounced peak at 1440 cm−1 can be assigned to the CC double bonds of these polymers.20 It is evident that in the presence of Au nanoparticles, the Raman peak intensities were considerably increased (Fig. 4). This result can be understood in terms of enhanced electromagnetic field in the presence of Au nanoparticles as a result of plasmonic excitations. The wavelength of the laser light we used for the Raman spectroscopy measurement is close to the known plasmon resonance energy of Au nanoparticles, and therefore, the electric field in the presence of Au nanoparticles can be amplified, ultimately resulting in a higher absorption efficiency of light of the active polymers, which are adjacent to Au nanoparticles incorporated into the PEDOT:PSS hole-collecting layers.20
 Fig. 4  Raman spectra collected from the OPVs with and without Au nanoparticles in PEDOT:PSS. 
It is also noteworthy that the series resistance of the inverted OPV was significantly decreased by incorporation of Au as shown in Table 1. This result implies that besides the plasmonic enhancement of the electromagnetic field by Au, increase in the conductivity of the OPV by Au should also be taken into account in order to fully explain the Au-induced enhancement in the performance of inverted OPVs in the present work.
Another strategy we used for improving the performance of the OPV is deposition of very thin ZnO layers on ZnO ripples using atomic layer deposition (ALD).21 We have recently demonstrated that the use of the ultrathin ZnO layers deposited by ALD can result in quenching of the electron–hole recombination at ZnO surface defects, which can ultimately lead to the enhanced performance of OPV.21 As shown in Table 1, deposition of ALD-deposited ZnO layers with a thickness of ∼2 nm on ZnO ripples resulted in an enhanced photovoltaic performance with respect to the value without ALD-layers.
By combining the aforementioned Au nanoparticles incorporated into PEDOT:PSS together with ALD-ZnO layers on ZnO ripples, a PCE of 7.9% could be reached.
In Fig. 5 external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the inverted OPVs with various structures shown in Table 1 were compared. It is notable that the external quantum yield increased by the presence of Au and additional ZnO layers on ZnO ripples by ALD. It is notable that the enhancement in the EQE by Au was more pronounced in the range of 400–600 nm, which is close to the plasmon resonance energies of Au nanoparticles.22 This result again suggests that the enhancement in the electric field by Au can play a pivotal role for the improvement in the OPV performances. In the presence of ALD-deposited ZnO layers on ZnO ripples, an increased EQE with respect to the reference cell (without Au, without ALD-ZnO) was found in a broader range of wavelength (400–700 nm) comparing to the OPV with Au in PEDOT:PSS.

In summary, we could fabricate an inverted OPV with a PCE of 7.9% using PTB7-F20 as a donor, PEDOT:PSS incorporated with Au nanoparticles as a hole-accepting layer and ZnO ripples with additional ZnO layers prepared by ALD as hole-blocking layers. We suggest that further optimization of the fabrication parameter based on our OPV-framework could be promising for making high-performing OPV for industrial applications.
3. Experimental
ZnO thin film
For the fabrication of an inverted OPV, the ITO-coated glass substrates (4 Ω □−1) were cleaned with detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath and then dried in an oven above 100 °C. For the preparation of ZnO sol–gel solution (concentration of solution; 0.75 M), zinc acetate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O] was dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol solution containing ethanolamine as a stabilizer. This solution was dissolved using a magnetic stirrer at 60 °C for 1 h to become a homogeneous solution. This solution was deposited onto the ITO-coated glass, which had been pretreated by UV ozone for 30 min, by spin-coating under atmospheric conditions. The details of synthesis and effects of the surface structure of ZnO ripples on the photovoltaic performance of inverted OPV have been reported elsewhere.23 ZnO thin films were additionally deposited on ZnO ripples using atomic layers deposition. Experimental details of ALD can be found elsewhere.21
Active layer
For the preparation of an active layer, PTB7-F20:PC71BM (8:12 mg) was dissolved in chlorobenzene–1,8-diiodooctane (CB/DIO; 0.97/0.03 ml, Aldrich). Both the donor/acceptor polymers were commercially available. The solution was stirred under the Ar condition at 60 °C overnight. The active layer was then deposited onto the ZnO-coated ITO electrode using spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 40 s after passing through a 0.20 μm-polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter. The thickness of the active layer was found to be about 100 nm, which will be demonstrated later.
PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS + Au
For the preparation of the PEDOT:PSS–Au nanoparticles, Au nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical reaction following a procedure previously reported.24 A stock solution of gold(III) chloride was prepared by dissolving 0.1 g of hydrogen tetrachloroaurate III) (HAuCl4·3.6H2O, Kojima Chemicals Co., Ltd.) in 250 ml of distilled water (DI water) (1.0 mM stock solution). A 25 ml of stock was diluted by 225 ml of DI water to make the 0.1 mM of gold(III) stock solution (S-1). A 0.5 g of trisodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7·2H2O, Aldrich) was dissolved in 50 ml of DI (38.8 mM trisodium citrate solution; S-2). The 250 ml of the S-1 solution was refluxed while stirring vigorously. After boiling the S-1 solution (about 110 °C), a 2 ml of the S-2 solution was quickly added, and the resulting solution was refluxed for 10 minutes. Finally, the solution was cooled down to room temperature while stirring. After formation of Au NPs, the particles were collected by centrifugation, and cleaned with ethanol several times. 0.026 g and 0.078 g of Au nanoparticles were added in the 70 μl of PDDOT:PSS diluted by 700 μl of isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Bare PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083, Heraeus) or PEDOT:PSS–Au were spin-coated onto the active layer at 5000 rpm for 60 min under the Ar condition. It is worth emphasizing that no post annealing of PEDOT:PSS layers was performed.
Deposition of top electrode (Ag)
The Ag metal as a top electrode (100 nm) was deposited by the thermal evaporation method under 3 × 10−6 torr conditions. The active surface area of the device with a metal mask was 0.38 cm2.
Measurement of PCE
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OPV devices were measured using a PEC-L11 model 13 (Pecell Technologies Inc.) under AM 1.5 simulated illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 The intensity of sunlight illumination was calibrated using a standard Siphotodiode detector with a KG-5filter.
Raman spectroscopy
Raman scattering was carried out using a HORIBA JOBIN YVON, Lab Ram HR 800 microscope. An Ar+ laser with a wavelength of 514.5 nm was used as the excitation source and the excitation power was 7 mW.
External quantum efficiency (EQE)
EQE spectra measurements were performed using a solar cell spectral response/QE/IPCE measurement system (Newport co., Oriel IQE-200™).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
For the characterization of the fabricated OPVs, TEM was used.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we could fabricate an inverted OPV with a PCE of 7.9% using PTB7-F20 as a donor, PEDOT:PSS incorporated with Au nanoparticles as a hole-accepting layer, and ZnO ripples with additional ZnO layers prepared by ALD as hole-blocking layers. We suggest that further optimization of the fabrication parameter based on our OPV-framework could be promising for making high-performing OPVs for industrial applications.
