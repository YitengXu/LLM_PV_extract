Herein, a favorable energy landscape picture at the device level is conceived by a synergistic approach of interface modification and morphology control to overcome the conundrum between performance and stability in BTP-based OSCs. With synergistic optimization of bilayered interfaces and ternary strategies, the energetic disorder for the charge carrier transport and the generation of trap states have been obviously suppressed in target OSCs. The resultant favorable energy landscape with less energy losses and charge recombination leads to simultaneously improved efficiency and photostability in target OSCs based on multiple organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems. Moreover, the multiple approaches of photophysical characterization of neat acceptor and blend films reveal that light soaking induces an additionally unfavorable energy landscape, which intensifies the nonradiative trapping of exciton-polaron species formed by enhanced back charge recombination from electronic to excitonic excitations due to reduced energy barrier. These results emphasize the importance of constructing and stabilizing a favorable energy landscape in addressing the performance-photostability problem of BTP-based small molecules and all-polymer OSCs.

Broader context
The commercial potential of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been dramatically boosted with the power conversion efficiencies exceeding 19%. However, it is still challenging to achieve high efficiencies and sufficient operational stability simultaneously in state-of-the-art OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors. More importantly, a clear picture of the degradation mechanism is still missing. Herein, we propose a general approach of triggering a favorable energy landscape via interface modification and morphology control to overcome the conundrum between performance and photostability in OSCs based on a series of most promising and representative non-fullerene acceptors. Furthermore, we provide unique and valuable insights into the degradation pathways, explicitly revealing the critical roles of non-radiative trapping of exciton–polarons formed in charge-back transfer processes due to reduced energy barriers. The proposed strategy of constructing and stabilizing a favorable energy landscape paves a new way towards highly efficient and photostable organic photovoltaic devices.

Introduction
The certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the recently emerged BTP-series non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have exceeded 18%,1–6 which is approaching the threshold of practical optoelectronic applications.7–10 However, the undesirable photostability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials, especially for the high-performance NFAs, remains to be a challenging obstacle severely preventing their commercialization process.11–14 In addition to the photoactive layers, interfacial layers mainly constructed from the conjugated organic compounds might suffer from serious decomposition against ultraviolet light soaking, thereby resulting in intrinsic photodegradation of OSCs under sunlight illumination.15–18 Although a few reports demonstrate that some typical non-fullerene OSCs exhibit the potential to achieve prolonged operational lifetimes under light-emitting diode (LED) illumination,18–21 it is still difficult to fabricate the high-efficiency BTP-based OSCs with superior photostability simultaneously.22–24 Furthermore, the fundamental identification of photodegradation pathways for BTP-series NFAs is considerably lagging behind their related efficiency thriving.22,25 Hence, tremendous efforts to reduce the large discrepancy between efficiency and photostability are urgently needed for the further development of OPVs.
Of note is that further photostability improvement requires a deeper understanding of the underlying degradation mechanisms of OSCs at both molecular and device levels. Previously, we have proposed a photophysical correlation picture between intermolecular electron–phonon coupling and trapping of electronic excitation behind the kinetic aggregation of BTP-eC9 under thermal stress.26 The BTP-eC9 aggregates give rise to the decreased intermolecular electron–phonon coupling and the increased density of trap states with more extended tails into the bandgap.26 Based on the above photophysical phenomenon inspiration, we point out that the existence of an unfavorable energy landscape in the actual OPV devices might induce the deterioration of photovoltaic performance under continuous sunlight illumination according to the following factors. First, the high degree of energetic disorder associated with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels widens the distribution of electronic states, thus creating a large number of band tail states.27–30 Second, the high density of trap states with broader energetic distribution into the bandgap brings out the severe localized photocarrier trapping.31–33 Third, the degradation of interlayers inevitably degenerates charge carrier extraction and enhances recombination.34–36 However, an effective approach to constructing and stabilizing a favorable energy landscape to address these issues is yet to be explored.
In this work, we proposed a synergistic method to construct a favorable energy landscape by taking advantage of both interface modification and morphology control in BTP-based OSCs. The V2O5/PEDOT:PSS and LiF/PDINN bilayer interfaces were employed as hole and electron transport layers, respectively, which significantly enhanced device photostability. Based on these interface modifications, adding a compatible NFA (IT-M) as the third component tailored intermolecular interaction and formed a cascaded energy landscape in PM6:L8-BO-based OSCs, yielding the further concurrently ameliorated PCE and photostability. The combined method exhibits good universality in other BTP-based OPV systems including Y6, N3, BTP-eC9 and PY-IT. It is noted that the congenerous strategy effectively restrains the increase of energetic disorder for charge transport and suppresses the formation of trap states, giving rise to less photocarrier trapping and energy loss than those of binary control devices. Along with a series of in-depth spectroscopic investigations, we identify the intensified nonradiative trapping of exciton–polarons as a result of unfavorable energy landscape additionally induced by light soaking. These photocarriers with weak excitonic interaction originate mainly from intensified back charge recombination due to decreased energy barrier between the polaronic charge-separated (CS) state and excitonic excitation coupling with dynamic polaronic screening. Therefore, the combinational analysis validates that the favorable energy landscape can indeed reduce energetic disorder and suppress nonradiative recombination to further overcome the performance-photostability conundrum of BTP-based small molecules and all-polymer OSCs. We believe that the synergistic construction strategy of a favorable energy landscape at the device level can provide new insights into developing highly efficient and photostable OSCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of photovoltaic materials used in this work. Five BTP-based photovoltaic systems including four PM6:NFA systems (PM6:L8-BO, PM6:Y6, PM6:N3, PM6:BTP-eC9) with IT-M as the third component, and an all-polymer system (PM6:PY-IT) with N2200 as the third component, were employed as platforms to investigate the relationship between photovoltaic performance and favorable energy landscape. Herein, the PM6:L8-BO-based binary and ternary blends were primarily taken as the representative. The absorption spectra of IT-M can be well complementary to those of PM6 and L8-BO (Fig. S1a, ESI†), thus yielding intensified light harvesting. The aligned cascaded energy landscape has been formed after adding IT-M (Fig. S2, ESI†), which provides a much larger driving force for charge transfer and transport.32,37 The introduced IT-M tends to be distributed in the L8-BO phase due to their better miscibility with the smaller Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†).38,39

To elucidate the effects of a favorable energy landscape on photovoltaic performance, we fabricated various types of OSCs in a conventional device configuration (Fig. 1b), where the inorganic V2O5 and LiF were adopted as the additional anode and cathode interlayers, respectively. As depicted in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the decreased work function and deeper HOMO (LUMO) of the PEDOT:PSS (PDINN) after inserting V2O5 (LiF) contribute to forming the better energy level alignment between the V2O5/PEDOT:PSS bilayered interfaces and ITO electrode (between the photoactive layer and LiF/PDINN bilayered interfaces). Fig. 1c illustrates the operating mechanism of a favorable energy landscape constructed by a congenerous approach consisting of interface modification and morphology control, which depicts multiple temporal-scale photocarrier dynamics in the actual devices. The representative current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PM6:L8-BO-based binary and ternary OSCs with different device structures are shown in Fig. 1d, and the detailed performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The binary PM6:L8-BO control device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINN/Ag gives a moderate PCE of 17.29% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.865 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 25.74 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 77.66%. The binary PM6:L8-BO OPV device with bilayered interfaces (V2O5 and LiF as extra interlayers) shows an enlarged PCE of 17.66% with a Voc of 0.871 V, a Jsc of 25.77 mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.68%. The ternary PM6:L8-BO:IT-M (weight ratio of 1:1.15:0.05) OSC with bilayered interfaces (target device) yields the maximum PCE of 18.19%, arising from the synchronously improved Voc (0.875 V), Jsc (26.22 mA cm−2) and FF (79.29%). The statistical analysis also confirms that the congenerous approach can indeed contribute to the improvement of device performance (Table 1). It should be noted that a favorable energy landscape is an important factor for reinforced device performance, which will be discussed in detail in the following part. Fig. 1e displays the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the above devices. The higher EQE value of the target device has been observed in the full spectrum range relative to that of the control OSC and the integrated JEQEsc values match well with the data obtained from J–V measurements within 5% mismatches.

To understand the reason for the elevated Jsc and FF, the exciton dissociation (Pdiss) and charge collection (Pcoll) probabilities were evaluated by measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves (Fig. S8a, ESI†). The higher Pcoll value demonstrates that the synergistic approach promotes charge extraction in target OSCs, whereas the efficient exciton dissociation is almost unchanged (Table S8, ESI†). Fig. S8b (ESI†) exhibits the dark J–V curves of the above devices. The reverse current density of the target device is much lower than that of the control OSC, indicating the larger rectification ratios and the restrained leakage current.40,41 The result manifests that the combined strategy can suppress charge recombination. In addition, the target device presents the boosted hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) concurrently, and the decreased μh/μe ratio relative to those of the control OSC (Fig. S8c, d and Table S9, ESI†), implying the ameliorative and more balanced charge transport.
Apart from photovoltaic efficiency, the photostability of the encapsulated PM6:L8-BO-based binary and ternary OSCs with different device structures (6 independent cells) were measured under continuous white LED illumination (equivalent to one sun intensity) in the ambient atmosphere at room temperature. The illumination spectrum of the white LEDs used in this study is provided in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The evolution of normalized PCEs over time was plotted in Fig. 1f. The binary control devices exhibit rapid performance decay and retain only 45.8% of their initial average PCEs after 500 h illumination. The serious degradation of PCEs stems from the different degrees of attenuation of all device parameters, especially in FF (Fig. 1g–i). In contrast, these devices with bilayered interfaces maintain 66.5% for a binary system and 72.7% for a ternary system of their initial PCEs after 500 h illumination. The rather stabilized Voc and FF parameters are mainly from the application of bilayered interfaces (Fig. 1g–i). It should be noted that V2O5 inhibits the corrosion of the acidic PEDOT:PSS on ITO electrodes and LiF reduces the interfacial charge recombination induced by the photodegradable PDINN layer.34,42,43 The further fortified FF stability of target devices primarily originates from the stabilized homogeneous microstructure with reinforced crystallinity and optimized molecular packing as discussed further on (Fig. 1i). Consequently, the proposed synergistic approach is apparently conducive to tackling the photoinduced degradation in the actual OPV devices.
Considering the beneficial effects of the congenerous approach in terms of both efficiency and photostability in the PM6:L8-BO system, we further explore its universality and validity in other BTP-based non-fullerene OSCs including PM6:Y6:IT-M, PM6:N3:IT-M, PM6:BTP-eC9:IT-M, and PM6:PY-IT:N2200. The corresponding J–V curves and EQE spectra are displayed in Fig. 2a–h. The improved photovoltaic performance has been achieved in target OSCs comprised of this three PM6:NFA blends and one all-polymer system, respectively (Table 1). Moreover, the fewer PCE changes as a function of photoaging time corroborate the markedly enhanced photostability in target OSCs (Fig. 2i–l), which is also mainly attributed to the more stable Voc and FF (Fig. S15–S18, ESI†). These results are quite consistent with the above analysis in PM6:L8-BO-based OPV devices. Therefore, the superior universality of the combined approach stimulates us to further understand and shed light on its underlying origin.

As mentioned in the introductory section, the unfavorable energy landscape might induce serious energetic disorder with extended band tail states in OPV devices. In principle, a low energetic disorder with decreased band tail states is a critical factor to realize highly efficient and photostable OSCs.28,44 In order to evaluate the energetic disorder of the PM6:L8-BO-based binary and ternary OSCs with different device structures before and after continuous illumination, the temperature-dependent hole and electron mobilities were measured via the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method.45 The energetic disorders (σh and σe) for hole and electron transport can be extracted from the slope of linear fitting curves according to the Gaussian disorder model (GDM) as follows:27,46 (1)where μ0 is the zero-field mobility, μ∞ is the intercept from the plot of μ0versus 1/T2, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the thermodynamic temperature. As depicted in Fig. 3a–c, the target OSCs give the smallest σh and σe values before and after continuous LED illumination, indicating the synergistic method can effectively reduce energetic disorder for charge transport to yield a favorable energy landscape.

To further verify the favorable energy landscape constructed by the congenerous method in target OSCs, the energetic disorder of trap states was probed by measuring the distribution of their electronic density of states (DOS) with capacitance spectroscopy in a dark environment. The frequency-dependent capacitance spectra without the applied bias are presented in Fig. 3d. The slightly elevated capacitance of the fresh target device testifies the better diode quality relative to that of the binary control OSC. All aged OPV devices show enlarged capacitance compared to the fresh ones, which is ascribed to the increased trap states. Interestingly, the obviously decreased capacitance value in the low-frequency region can only be observed in the aged binary control devices rather than these OSCs with bilayered interfaces. This phenomenon manifests the growing leakage current and trap states resulting from serious photodegradation of PEDOT:PSS and/or PDINN.47,48 Moreover, the distribution of trap DOS with a widespread Gaussian shape can be fitted by the following equation,49 (2)where Nt is the total density per unit volume, σ is the disorder parameter, and Et is the energy center of the DOS. By fitting the energetic traces of trap DOS (Fig. 3e), the lowest Nt and σ values have been obtained in the fresh and aged target OSCs in contrast to other devices (Fig. 3f and Table S10, ESI†). As expected, the narrowest distribution of trap DOS in target OSCs illustrates that the favorable energy landscape can reduce the energetic disorder of trap states as well, thereby leading to less localized photocarrier trapping before and after continuous illumination.
Generally speaking, the favorable energy landscape at the device level can suppress the nonradiative recombination effectively, which is an important channel to decrease Voc loss.30,50,51 We then investigated the Voc loss mechanisms in PM6:L8-BO-based binary and ternary OSCs with different device structures. Fig. S22 (ESI†) presents the normalized electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the above devices. The narrowest EL linewidth of the target device to some degree demonstrates the decreased nonradiative recombination loss in contrast with other OSCs.52,53 According to a well-established method described in detail in the ESI,†50,52,54 we calculated the non-radiative recombination energy loss (ΔEnonrad) via external quantum efficiency of EL (EQEEL) (Fig. 3g) and extracted the saturated current density for radiative recombination (Jrad0), radiative Voc limit (Vradoc) and device bandgap (EPVg) parameters from the sensitive EQE measured by Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS-EQE) (Fig. 3h). The detailed energy losses (Eloss) values are summarized in Fig. 3i and Table 2. The target device exhibits the lowest ΔEnonrad of 0.220 eV and Eloss of 0.578 eV among three types of OSCs, which means its favorable energy landscape at the device level.

As discussed above, achieving a favorable energy landscape at the device level is necessary to ensure both efficiency and photostability. In order to explore the origins of the unfavorable energy landscape, we studied the photophysical properties of neat NFA films under light soaking. Herein, the temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure BTP-based NFA films were first measured under different photoaging times. As shown in Fig. S24 (ESI†), the fresh L8-BO film exhibits growing PL intensity as the temperature increases from 80 to 300 K, which derives from the enhanced recombination of free charge carriers (produced by spontaneous dissociation of excitons upon photoexcitation) back into emissive excitonic species.55 Then, we quantitatively calculated the energy barrier (Ea) of back charge recombination by fitting the temperature-dependent integrated PL intensity with the Arrhenius equation,55 (3)in which I0 is the integrated PL intensity at 0 K and A is the frequency factor. As displayed in Fig. 4a and Fig. S25 (ESI†), the Ea value is 17.2 meV, which is very close to that of Y6 reported in the literature.55 After 30 h illumination, the Ea value decreases to 11.1 meV (Fig. 4b), indicating the enhanced interconversion from the polaronic charge-separated state to the lowest singlet excited state. Surprisingly, with increasing photoaging time, the PL intensity gradually decreased with temperature. Theoretically, the boosted back process can strengthen the emission intensity when the temperature is increasing.55,56 However, the opposite phenomenon observed here for aged acceptor films demonstrates that the newly formed excitonic species suffer stronger nonradiative recombination when the temperature is increasing. The intensified nonradiative decay is mainly from increased trap states under illumination, which might be related to the changes in the L8-BO molecular structure, conformation, aggregation state, etc.12,20,57 Moreover, we also measured a set of temperature-dependent PL spectra of neat Y6, N3 and BTP-eC9 films and extracted their evolution information of Ea parameter over aging time (Fig. S27–S35, ESI†). The corresponding results are in good agreement with the data obtained from the neat L8-BO film. It is noted that PY-IT shows a different trend compared to those of small molecular acceptor films, i.e., its emission intensity decreases as the temperature is increasing not only for aged but also for fresh films (Fig. S36, ESI†). This phenomenon might be attributed to more initial morphological trap states in polymer acceptor films, giving rise to thermally activated nonradiative decay at higher temperature.56

Given that the enhanced back charge recombination can affect the lifetimes of the emissive excitonic species, we further conducted the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra measurements. Fig. S39a and b (ESI†) present the TRPL spectra of the fresh and aged neat L8-BO films under different excitation intensities. Significantly reduced lifetimes are observed in the aged samples compared with the fresh ones. Generally, the emission lifetime is dominated by the radiative and nonradiative decay rates.55,58 Hence, we calculated the nonradiative (Anonrad) and radiative (Brad) recombination constants in accordance with a rate equation expressed in the ESI.†58,59 The photoaged films show obviously increased Anonrad and Brad values (Fig. 4c and d), implying accelerated recombination of emissive excitonic species after illumination, agreeing well with the trend observed with temperature-dependent PL spectra.
In order to distinguish the evolution of excitonic and electronic excitation under light soaking, ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy characterizations were performed on the BTP-based NFA films. The TA spectra in the near-infrared (NIR) region and the corresponding decay kinetic traces of L8-BO are illustrated in Fig. S44, ESI† and Fig. 4e, respectively. Herein, the excited state absorption (ESA) signals at 860 and 1280 nm have been extracted, which corresponds to the feature of excitons and polarons, respectively. Exciton decay dynamics are faster in the aged L8-BO films (Fig. S44, ESI†), agreeing well with the analysis of PL and TRPL spectra. In contrast, polaron decay kinetics become slower on the temporal scale of hundreds of picoseconds to a few microseconds after aging, demonstrating enhanced electronic trapping and the emergence of the long-lived trapped polarons (Fig. 4e and Fig. S45, ESI†).
Due to the existence of the trapped polarons with a longer lifetime, it is challenging to clarify the evolution of the total photocarriers before and after continuous illumination. Encouragingly, we developed a feasible approach to quantify the population and depopulation process of the total excitonic and electronic species according to the excitonic dynamics in the form of (4)where NTP is the density of the total photocarriers, NEX is the density of excitons, and k and γ are the radiative and nonradiative recombination coefficients, respectively.60,61 The details about the derivation process are provided in the ESI.†Fig. 4f and g illustrates the pump-fluence dependent TA dynamics at 860 nm together with the fitted curves in the fresh and aged L8-BO films, and the fitted parameters are summarized in Table S24 (ESI†). The larger k and γ values of the aged sample compared to the fresh one manifest the increased radiative and nonradiative recombination of the total photocarriers resulting from the unfavorable energy landscape. In addition, the TA decay dynamics of other BTP-based NFAs including Y6, N3, BTP-eC9 and PY-IT are displayed in Fig. 4h–k, respectively. It is worth noting that these NFAs except PY-IT also demonstrate the noticeable characteristics of the trapped polarons with persisting decay kinetic traces at 950 and 1280 nm extracted from their TA spectra (Fig. S46–S49, ESI†). As for PY-IT, its excitonic and electronic kinetics keep almost unchanged before and after light soaking, which might stem from a larger number of morphological trap states in its fresh film. That is to say, even though light soaking enhances photocarrier trapping, the initial morphological trap states still play a dominant role in excitonic and electronic dynamics after continuous illumination, keeping in line with the results of its temperature-dependent PL spectra.
According to the above analysis, we proposed a possible microscopic origin of the photoinduced unfavorable energy landscape in BTP-based NFAs (Fig. 4l). It has been already reported by many groups that the direct generation of free charge carriers can be realized spontaneously upon photoexcitation in these state-of-the-art NFAs at room temperature.31,55,62 The reduced energy barrier between excitonic and electronic excitation under continuous illumination leads to increased back charge recombination and the emergence of exciton-polaron species (electron and hole pairs with longer spatial separation) due to the polaronic screening effect.61,63,64 The formation of exciton-polaron species with weak excitonic interaction is most probably the consequence of local molecular deformation coupling with soft and polar properties of OPV materials under photoexcitation. The severe non-radiative trapping of polarons and exciton-polaron species degenerates the energy landscape of NFA molecules in the solid phase. Hence, the unfavorable energy landscape with serious photocarrier trapping might be a major factor for the performance-stability problem of BTP-based non-fullerene OSCs.
To gain more insights into the evolution of the energy landscape of NFA molecules in a condensed blend state, the transient kinetics of PM6:L8-BO-based binary and ternary bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films under light soaking were investigated by measuring their TA spectra. Herein, the acceptor L8-BO was selectively pumped through an excitation light of 800 nm. Fig. 5a and b present a series of representative TA spectra of the fresh and aged binary films, respectively. Two well-separated negative signals centered at around 630 and 800 nm correspond to the ground state bleaching (GSB) characteristics of PM6 and L8-BO, respectively. In principle, the GSB signal can reflect the population and depopulation processes of the total photocarriers to a certain extent.61 As displayed in Fig. 5c, the GSB signal of PM6 in the aged binary film takes a longer time to reach its saturation and then presents a slower decay rate relative to the fresh one. This phenomenon manifests the obviously decreased hole transfer rate and reinforced photocarrier trapping. The accelerated decay of the L8-BO GSB feature within ten picoseconds also validates the increased trap states after light soaking. In contrast, the ternary blends with IT-M show a stable hole transfer process and photocarrier dynamics (Fig. 5d–f), indicating effectively inhibited formation of trap states. The transient kinetics of the positive ESA response at 865 and 965 nm for binary and ternary films are illustrated in Fig. 5g and h, respectively. The ternary blends exhibit fewer changes in dynamics of both excitonic and electronic excitations compared with those of binary films before and after continuous illumination, which is well consistent with the results of their GSB dynamics. The comparably slow decay kinetics of electronic excitation in the aged binary blend derives mainly from the increase of long-lived trapped polarons. As for the origins of these long-lived polarons, although other factors associated with the photodegradation of molecules could not be completely excluded, morphological traps are highly relevant as reflected in the reduced π–π stacking ordering after aging (see the following X-ray scattering measurements). We thus put forward a reasonable speculation that NFA disordering could lead to an unfavorable energy landscape which promotes generation of long-lived polarons (Fig. 5i).26,55,62 Aggregation/reorganization of NFAs in the amorphous phases under illumination or thermal stress has been reported in many systems,20,65,66 which might also lead to long-lived polarons. The positive effects of ternary strategy on constructing the favorable energy landscape have also been observed in transient kinetics of other BTP-based BHJ blends (Fig. S51–S54, ESI†).

(i) Schematic diagram of NFA disordering-induced excitonic and electronic excitation changes. 
We further investigated the morphology evolution of binary and ternary blends before and after continuous illumination to reveal its correlation with unfavorable energy landscape. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images are shown in Fig. 6a–d. The obvious fiber network morphology can be clearly seen in all PM6:L8-BO-based blends, which is closely associated with the aggregation feature of polymer PM6.67 Both binary and ternary aged films give the slightly enlarged root-mean-square (RMS) roughness, implying that light soaking does lead to morphological changes. Of note is that more stable surface morphologies are realized in ternary BHJ blends in comparison to these binary ones, which enables improved optoelectronic properties. The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement was conducted to explore the crystallinity and molecular stacking in the relevant blend films. Fig. S55 (ESI†) and Fig. 6e depict the GIWAXS patterns and corresponding line-cut curves of PM6:L8-BO-based binary and ternary blends. Both binary and ternary films adopt face-on orientation with a stronger (010) π–π stacking peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction than that in the in-plane (IP) direction before and after light soaking.9,13 The slightly shifted (010) π–π stacking peak from 17.85 to 18.09 nm−1 and the increased crystalline coherence length (CCL) from 2.76 to 2.87 nm manifest the enhanced π–π stacking interactions and crystallinity in the fresh ternary system than those of binary film. Ternary films show more stable microstructures as evidenced by less attenuated (010) CCL values (Table S25, ESI†). Ultimately, the introduction of IT-M improves substantially intermolecular interactions of host donor and acceptor materials, thereby suppressing the related unfavorable energy landscape caused by morphological instability.

Conclusions
In summary, we have manifested that the construction of a favorable energy landscape via interface modification and morphology control is a feasible avenue to develop highly efficient and photostable OSCs. The V2O5/PEDOT:PSS and LiF/PDINN bilayer interfaces effectively suppress interfacial recombination and enhance device photostability. The introduction of IT-M improves thin film crystallinity and forms aligned cascading energy levels with a sufficient driving force to promote charge transfer and transport. This synergistic approach suppresses the initial and photoinduced increase of energetic disorder for charge transport as well as density of trap states. The FTPS-EQE, EQEEL and EL measurements testify the smaller nonradiative voltage losses with narrower EL emission linewidth in target OSC, confirming its more favorable energy landscape compared to that of the control OPV device. As for the degradation mechanism, the temperature-dependent integrated PL intensity, TRPL and TA spectroscopy measurements reveal the intensified nonradiative trapping of exciton-polaron species produced by boosted back charge recombination from electronic to excitonic excitation as a result of unfavorable energy landscape induced additionally by light soaking. The target OSCs achieve an enlarged PCE of 18.2% (compared to 17.29% of the control devices) and significantly improved photostability. More importantly, the correlation picture between the favorable energy landscape and photovoltaic performance shows superior universality in BTP-based non-fullerene OSCs. These findings clearly indicate an effective approach to building and retaining favorable energy landscape, thereby paving a new way towards high-efficiency OSCs with satisfactory operational stability.

Broader context
The commercial potential of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been dramatically boosted with the power conversion efficiencies exceeding 19%. However, it is still challenging to achieve high efficiencies and sufficient operational stability simultaneously in state-of-the-art OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors. More importantly, a clear picture of the degradation mechanism is still missing. Herein, we propose a general approach of triggering a favorable energy landscape via interface modification and morphology control to overcome the conundrum between performance and photostability in OSCs based on a series of most promising and representative non-fullerene acceptors. Furthermore, we provide unique and valuable insights into the degradation pathways, explicitly revealing the critical roles of non-radiative trapping of exciton–polarons formed in charge-back transfer processes due to reduced energy barriers. The proposed strategy of constructing and stabilizing a favorable energy landscape paves a new way towards highly efficient and photostable organic photovoltaic devices.
