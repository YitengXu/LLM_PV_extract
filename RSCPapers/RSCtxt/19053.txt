    , Accepted 27th February 2021First published on 9th April 2021AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) Janus structures such as MoSSe and Janus graphene have grabbed global attention for their novel properties and interesting behaviors. In this study, via first-principles calculations, we have systematically explored the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of Janus-functionalized Sc2CTT′ (T, T′ = H, O, OH, F, Cl). Interestingly, four Sc2COT′ were found to be ferrimagnetic half-metals with high predicted Curie temperatures, indicating their feasibility in spintronic applications. On the other hand, Sc2COHCl, Sc2CHCl, and Sc2CFCl are suitable photocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting. In particular, Sc2COHCl with a bandgap of 0.99 eV is highlighted as an infrared light-driven photocatalyst. Sc2COHH, possessing an ideal direct band gap of 1.08 eV and noticeable optical absorption in the visible light region, is very promising as the donor material for solar cells. It is highlighted that the designed type II Sc2COHH/InS heterostructure solar cell could present a high power conversion efficiency of up to 21.04% by inducing effective photo-excited electron–hole separation, which is favorable for photodetection harvesting. We believe that our study will provide a feasible strategy for the design and application of MXenes.
1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have remarkable properties as compared with their bulk counterparts.1 The 2D transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes)2–9 are produced by etching out the A layers from MAX phases, where M is a transition metal, A is a IIIA or IVA element and X is C or N. MXenes have been actively studied for various applications including electromagnetic interference shielding,10 battery anodes,11,12 supercapacitors,13 photocatalysts,14–16 and composites,.17,18
In MAX phases, the M layers are nearly close-packed with the X atoms filling the octahedral sites, while the MX layers are interleaved with the A layers. Since M–A bonds are much weaker than M–X bonds, A layers can be selectively chemically etched by hydrofluoric acid (HF) without disrupting the M–X bonds, resulting in weakly bonded MX layers.4,5 The surfaces of MX layers are always covered with a mixture of functional groups after the etching process. Therefore, the general formula of MXenes can be described as MXTx, where Tx represents the surface functional groups such as oxygen (O), hydroxyl (OH), and/or fluorine (F).19,20 These functional groups play an important role in the properties and applications of MXenes. Very recently, MXenes with O, NH, S, Cl, Se, Br, and Te surface terminations were successfully synthesized,21 which exhibit distinctive structural and electronic properties. For example, the functionalized MXene Nb2C exhibits superconductivity.21 It is worth mentioning that graphene functionalized with O and H on opposite sides is found to act as a ferromagnetic metal, and when semi-functionalized with F on one side, it is an antiferromagnetic semiconductor.22 Such surface group engineering is expected to uncover new directions for 2D functional materials.
Inspired by the experimental achievements of Janus MoSSe and Janus-functionalized graphene (asymmetrically terminated by H and F),23–25 the synthesis of Janus MXenes with asymmetrically surface-functionalized groups is expected in the future. In our previous high-throughput research on MXene, Sc2C was proved to be metal, while Sc2CT (T = O, F, OH) turned out to be a semiconductor.26,27 Zha et al. demonstrated that one intermediate state during the conversion from Sc2C(OH)2 to Sc2CO2 is a bipolar magnetic semiconductor.28 Before the trial and error experiments, the comprehensive theoretical screening for the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of Janus functionalized MXenes Sc2CTT′ (T, T′ = H, O, OH, F, Cl) is of great interest and importance. Based on first-principles calculations and materials screening, we show that the Sc2CTT′ are half-metals with ferrimagnetism when one side of the surface is covered with O terminations, while Sc2COHCl, Sc2CHCl, and Sc2CFCl are promising candidates for photocatalysts. In particular, Sc2COHCl exhibits good optical absorption performance in the infrared light wavelength region. Additionally, Sc2COHCl presents excellent optoelectronic properties and is very applicable as a donor semiconductor for heterostructure solar cells.
2. Theoretical methods
First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were adopted by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).29,30 For the electron exchange–correlation functional, the projector augmented-wave (PAW)31 of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)32 formalism was employed. A vacuum layer larger than 20 Å was set in the z-direction to avoid the interaction between repeated units. The cutoff energy was set to 500 eV. The atomic structures were analyzed by the VESTA code.33 The k-points of 11 × 11 × 1 and 15 × 15 × 1, automatically generated by the Monkhorst–Pack scheme, were used for structural relaxations and static calculations, respectively. The relaxation convergence for both electrons and ions was 1 × 10−6 eV. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)34 hybrid density functional was applied to calculate the band gaps. Time-dependent Hartree–Fock (TDHF)35 calculations based on the HSE06 were used to get accurate optical properties, which take the excitonic effects into account. The TDHF calculations were done in two steps. The first step is the HSE06 calculation. In the second step, based on the wave function from the first step, the dielectric function was evaluated by setting ALGO = TDHF. The PHONOPY code based on force constants obtained by the VASP-DFPT (density-functional perturbation theory) interface36,37 was employed to study the dynamic stabilities, for which a 6 × 6 × 1 supercell and a k-point mesh of 3 × 3 × 1 were used. The dipole correction has been considered for all the Janus structures during our calculations.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural properties
Firstly, we focused on the structural configurations of Janus Sc2CTT′ (T, T′ = H, O, OH, F, Cl). As presented in Fig. 1, there are four possible models for the surface groups on Sc2C: both T and T′ groups located directly toward the Sc atoms (model I); both T and T′ groups positioned above the C atoms (model II); with the T group in configuration II and T′ in configuration I (model III); with the T group in configuration I and T′ in configuration II (model IV). The calculated energy differences between these four configuration models are listed in Table 1. Interestingly, for all Janus Sc2CTT′, model I has the lowest energy, implying that it is energetically more favorable, whereas model II has the highest energy. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that model I is the most stable configuration when Sc atoms can provide sufficient electrons for the attached T and T′ groups. Such results are consistent with the preferred model of Sc2CO2 as discussed in previous work.38

Secondly, the formation energy (Eform) was calculated to evaluate the stability of Sc2CTT′, which is defined by the following equation:38,39 (1)where ESc2CTT′ and ESc2C respectively represent the total energies of Janus Sc2CTT′ and pristine Sc2C. E(T2) and  are the total energies of O2, H2, O2 + H2, F2 in the gas phase. Herein, ΔμT = μT − (1/2)E(T2) and , where μ is the chemical potential of the surface group. The chemical potential was calculated by the molecular energy of the most stable gas phase divided by the atomic number in the molecule. Fig. 2a illustrates the formation energies (Eform) for various Sc2CTT′ with respect to those of symmetrically functionalized Sc2CT2 and pristine Sc2C. Note that Eform of Sc2CTT′ is just between that of the corresponding symmetrically functionalized Sc2CT2, except for Sc2CHCl and Sc2CFCl. Evidently, Eform for both Sc2CTT′ and symmetrically functionalized Sc2CT2 have large negative values and are much lower as compared to pristine Sc2C, demonstrating the formation of strong bonds between the Sc atoms and the surface groups. Such results are consistent with the fact that the MXenes were synthesized experimentally with surface groups.40 The phonon calculations were adopted to confirm the lattice dynamic stability of Sc2CTT′, as illustrated in Fig. 2b and S1.† Sc2COH is used as an example in Fig.2b, which possesses the highest formation energy of all Sc2CTT′. No negative frequency was observed in the phonon dispersion curves, indicating that Sc2COH has lattice dynamic stability. The absence of imaginary frequency modes displayed in Fig. S1† suggests that all the other 9 Janus compositions are dynamically stable as well.

3.2 Electronic and magnetic properties
MXenes cover various electronic properties ranging from metallicity to semiconductivity.5 Commonly, the electronic properties of MXenes can be modulated by surface functionalization.38,41Table 2 lists the ground-state magnetic ordering and transport behavior of Sc2CTT′; here, it can be seen that four O-functionalized Sc2COT′ (Sc2COOH, Sc2COF, Sc2COCl, Sc2COH) show half-metallic natures with ferromagnetic (FM) ordering, while the other six (Sc2COHF, Sc2COHCl, Sc2COHH, Sc2CHF, Sc2CHCl, Sc2CFCl) exhibit nonmagnetic (NM) semiconducting features. The details of the electronic and magnetic properties are discussed in the following.

Firstly, we studied the electronic properties of six NM semiconductors. Fig. S2† shows the band structures of Sc2COHF, Sc2COHCl, Sc2COHH, Sc2CHF, Sc2CHCl, Sc2CFCl by the HSE approach. Interestingly, the Sc2C with the OH functional group (Sc2COHF, Sc2COHCl, Sc2COHH) have direct bandgaps of 0.89 eV, 0.99 eV, and 1.08 eV, respectively. Sc2CHF, Sc2CHCl, Sc2CFCl show indirect bandgaps of 1.91 eV, 1.84 eV, 1.79 eV, respectively. A deeper understanding of the electronic structure properties can be gained by exploring the total and partial density of states (DOS). As seen from the DOS plots in Fig. 3, the six semiconductors have similar features due to their similar atomic configurations. The valence states are dominated by Sc 3d states and C 2p states, while the conduction states are dominated by Sc 3d states. Since the Sc–C bonds have a mixed covalent/metallic/ionic character,42 Sc 3d states and C 2p states are strongly hybridized. A covalent bond also exists between Sc atoms and the surface group atoms.

To investigate the magnetic properties of Sc2COT′, we calculated the total energies of the ferromagnetic (FM), nonmagnetic (NM), and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin ordering to determine the magnetic ground state for Sc2COT′. The results are shown in Table 3. For a systematic understanding, three possible AFM configurations are considered and illustrated in Fig. S3.† Interestingly, among the four considered magnetic configurations and NM states for all Sc2COT′, the FM states are the most stable, with the lowest energies. The bond angles of Sc–C–Sc shown in Table 3 are very close to 90°, demonstrating that the Sc-d orbitals are nearly orthogonal to the C-p orbital. Our results follow the Goodenough–Kanamori–Anderson (GKA) rule very well,43–45 where the FM coupling is preferred for the bond angle of 90° for the super-exchange interaction between two transition atoms. As a result, Sc2COT′ favors an FM-ordered ground state. Furthermore, based on the mean-field theory approximation, the Curie temperatures were simply estimated by kBTC = (2/3)ΔE,46,47 as summarized in Table 3. Although the mean-field theory approximation always overestimates the Curie temperatures for 2D materials, the estimated value of 292 K indicates a probable high Curie temperature of Sc2COCl. It is worth mentioning that another ferromagnetic 2D semiconductor CrOCl was experimentally synthesized in 2019,48 which has been theoretically predicted in our previous work.49 Evidently, the estimated Curie temperature of Sc2COCl (292 K) is much higher than that for CrOCl (187 K) by the same mean-field theory approximation.

Having confirmed the magnetic ground state of Sc2COT′, we now turn to the electronic structures to gain further insight into the magnetic properties. Because Sc2COCl has the highest estimated Curie temperature, we take it as an example to study the electronic structure. The calculated spin-dependent electronic band structure and DOS are shown in Fig. 4. A remarkable feature of the band structure is the half-metallic character (majority-spin electrons show insulating behavior while minority-spin electrons show metallic behavior). The majority-spin electrons are insulating due to the existence of a wide bandgap as large as 3.46 eV. Thus, the electronic transport in such a system is completely spin-polarized, dominated by the minority-spin electrons. The half-metallic gap, defined as the minimum energy gap of majority-spin conduction and valence bands with respect to the Fermi level,50,51 is very important for guaranteeing the half-metallic character by preventing the spin-flip transitions. The calculated half-metallic gap for Sc2COCl is 0.98 eV, which is larger than those for chalcogenides and double perovskites.52,53 For the majority spins, the conduction band minima (CBM) are mainly contributed by the 3d electrons from the Sc atom and valence band maxima (VBM) are predominantly occupied by the 2p electrons from the C atoms. For minority spins, the 3d electrons from the Sc atom and the 2p electrons from the C atom are dominated at the Fermi level, resulting in the metallic behavior. The spin-dependent band structure and DOS for Sc2COF, Sc2COH and Sc2COOH are displayed in Fig. S4, S5 and S6,† respectively. Table 4 lists the calculated majority-spin bandgaps and half-metallic bandgaps of these four structures. Apparently, Sc2COF and Sc2COH exhibit very similar features to Sc2COCl, while for Sc2COOH, although the majority-spin bandgap is much lower, it holds a relatively high half-metallic gap of 0.61 eV. The above merits of Sc2COT′ make it very suitable for spintronic applications.

Strain engineering has been confirmed as a potential route for modulating magnetic behavior.54,55Fig. 5a shows the calculated energy differences between FM and NM states (ΔEFM–NM), AFM and NM states (ΔEAFM–NM), and FM and AFM states (ΔEFM–AFM) of Sc2COCl under tensile strain. One can see that ΔEFM–NM and ΔEAFM–NM are negative under the whole tensile stress range, suggesting that FM and AFM states are more stable than the NM state. More interestingly, the calculated ΔEFM–AFM is negative from ε = 0% to ε = 4.8%, that is, Sc2COCl prefers the FM state in this strain range. As the tension increases, the value of ΔEFM–AFM becomes positive. Thus, the AFM state was the most stable one until the maximum tension (ε = 10%) was applied in our study. Remarkably, FM to AFM magnetic switching was achieved at ε = 4.8%. Fig. 5b and c give the spin-resolved density of states of Sc2COCl under 4% tensile strain for FM states and 5% tensile strain for AFM states, respectively. As is seen, Sc2COCl is an FM half-metal under 4% tensile strain, which is very similar to that under 0% tension in Fig. 4b. Sc2COCl transfers to AFM metal under 5% tensile strain, in which Sc 3d electrons and C 2p electrons are responsible for the metallic behavior.

Sc2COF and Sc2COOH show the same magnetic state tendencies under tensile stress; the results are listed in Fig. S7 and S8,† respectively. Notably, the transformation tensile tension for Sc2COF and Sc2COOH are respectively 5.3% and 5.7%. Interestingly, Sc2COF and Sc2COOH turned out to be AFM semiconductors with bandgaps of 0.81 and 0.89 eV after the transformation tensile tension. For Sc2COH, under the tension from 0% to 10%, ΔEFM–NM and ΔEFM–AFM are always negative as illustrated in Fig. S9,† implying that the FM state is the most stable magnetic ordering. Moreover, Sc2COH can maintain the half-metal behavior with a very small majority-spin and half-metallic band gap decrease in the whole strain range. The DOS displayed in Fig. S9† under 5% and 10% is similar to Sc2COH under pristine conditions as well.
3.3 Photocatalytic applications
According to the traditional water-splitting mechanism, the CBM of a suitable photocatalyst should be higher (more negative) than the hydrogen reduction potential (0 eV vs NHE) and the VBM should be lower (more positive) than the water oxidation potential (1.23 eV). Hence, the smallest bandgap for a semiconductor to be applied as a photocatalyst is 1.23 eV. However, such bandgap limitation has hampered the utilization of the infrared part in the solar spectrum, which consists of almost half of the solar energy. The Yang group has proposed a new mechanism for efficiently utilizing infrared areas.56 In this new mechanism, the bandgap of a suitable photocatalyst can be reduced to the infrared region (Eg > 1.23 − ΔΦ) by tuning the intrinsic dipole with an appropriate band position. Herein, ΔΦ is the electrostatic potential difference between different surfaces of the photocatalyst. Thus, if ΔΦ is large enough, i.e., ΔΦ > 1.23 eV, one can relieve the restriction on the bandgap requirement of the photocatalyst. Yang et al. designed a surface-functionalized boron-nitride (BN) bilayer (F-BNBN-H) system with an internal field for water splitting under near-infrared light. Coincidently, the outer layer of Janus Sc2CTT′ is saturated with different functional groups. Motivated by this, a blueprint came to mind, where Sc2CTT′ could be endowed with satisfactory characteristics as a proposed photocatalyst for hydrogen production, utilizing near-infrared solar energy.
To confirm our hypothesis, we firstly focused on the built-in electric field in Sc2CTT′ induced by the asymmetric structures. The internal electric field self-introduced by the intrinsic dipole P is defined by the following equation:56 (2)where ε is the dielectric constant and S is the surface area. The electrostatic potential difference ΔΦ is expressed as follows:56 (3)where e is the elementary charge. Hence, from eqn (1) and (2), the electric field E can be achieved by the following expression:56 (4)
As far as we know, this is the first time that the value of the internal electric field has been directly and quantitatively calculated; it has only been discussed qualitatively in other Janus structures for water splitting.56–60 The calculated electric field E, intrinsic dipole P, and electrostatic potential difference ΔΦ are summarized in Table 5. Fig. 6 shows that there is a surface potential difference ΔΦ between two atomic surfaces of Sc2COHF, Sc2COHCl, Sc2COHH, Sc2CHF, Sc2CHCl, Sc2CFCl with the values of 3.90 eV, 4.80 eV, 3.67 eV, 0.16 eV, 1.26 eV, 1.21 eV, respectively. Taking Sc2CFCl as an example, the F atomic layer is positively charged and the Cl atomic layer is negatively charged, generating an intrinsic dipole of 0.31 Debye. Hence, an internal electric field in the direction from F surface to Cl surface induces an electrostatic potential difference of 1.21 eV between two surfaces.

To further verify the photocatalytic abilities, we calculated the band edge positions of CBM/VBM as compared with the redox levels of water, which are shown in Fig. 7 and S10.† The energy difference ΔEc, defined as CBM minus the water reduction potential, and ΔEv, defined as water oxidation potential minus VBM are summarized in Table 5. The band edge positions of the CBM/VBM energy levels were determined by shifting the energy scale to set the vacuum level at zero. For Sc2COHCl, Sc2CHCl and Sc2CFCl, the ΔEc are 3.71 eV, 0.90 eV, 0.95 eV, and the calculated ΔEv are 0.85 eV, 0.97 eV, 0.82 eV, respectively, all of which are correspondingly located outside the reduction potential and oxidation potential. The values of ΔEc and ΔEv are large enough, indicating the high redox abilities for dissociating water into H2 and O2. For Sc2COHF, Sc2COHH and Sc2CHF, although their CBMs are more negative than the hydrogen reduction potential, the VBMs are higher than the oxidation potential of water, indicating the relatively poor performances of water oxidation. Significantly, the band gap for Sc2COHCl is 0.99 eV, which broadens the range of light absorption from the visible to near-infrared region, resulting in the dramatically improved utilization of solar radiation.

Another predominant factor that has a notable impact on photocatalytic ability is the efficient utilization of solar energy. Fig. 8 presents the calculated absorption coefficients of Sc2CFCl, Sc2COHCl and Sc2CHCl by the HSE06-TDHF method. Herein, Sc2COHF, Sc2COHH and Sc2CHF are not under consideration since they do not have favorable band alignments as discussed before. Sc2CFCl, Sc2COHCl and Sc2CHCl exhibit a quite broad optical adsorption from the UV light to the visible light region, where the absorption coefficients can reach the 105 cm−1 level, which demonstrates the highly efficient utilization of solar radiation for photocatalytic water splitting. In particular, the absorption coefficient for Sc2COHCl in the infrared light range is still up to 104 cm−1. Hence the infrared light that constitutes almost half of the solar energy can be used to produce hydrogen. Such advantage agrees well with our previous analysis. Similar results have been reported in Janus MoOTe and PtSSe as photocatalyst for H2 generation.57,61

Thereafter, we drew the schematic of the photocatalytic process in Fig. 9 to investigate the photocatalytic mechanism in Sc2CFCl, Sc2COHCl, and Sc2CHCl. After photon absorptions in these three Janus structures, shown in Fig. 9a, the excited electron–hole pairs are separated into free electrons and holes. Due to the internal electric field, free electrons will transport to the (001) surface for hydrogen production and holes will transfer to the (00) surface for oxygen generation. Thus the oxidation–reduction reaction occurs on different surfaces, reducing the free carrier recombination rate, which can dramatically improve the photocatalytic efficiency.56 We then examined the band-decomposed charge density in Fig. 9b, which shows that the charge densities of the VBM and CBM accumulated on different surfaces, agreeing well with the previous discussions.

3.4 Solar cell applications
Photovoltaic materials converting solar radiation directly into electricity are very hopeful for clean and sustainable applications of solar energy. Excitonic solar cells (XSC) are combined with 2D donor–acceptor semiconductors via the interlayer van der Waals (vdW) interactions, in which the free carriers are generated and dissociated at the heterostructure interfaces. Previous studies have proved that XSCs are promising candidates for highly efficient solar cell devices.62–66 However, finding an appropriate donor semiconductor with both high stability and ideal direct bandgap is still an urgent and challenging task. Amazingly, we found that 2D Sc2COHH is very suitable as a donor material, and the reasons are discussed in detail below.
The calculated band gap of Sc2COHH by the HSE06 method is 1.08 eV, which is very close to that of bulk silicon (∼1.16 eV), which is the optimum gap for solar cell applications. Moreover, the direct bandgap structure of Sc2COHH is beneficial for photovoltaic applications. Thus, we have calculated the absorption coefficients of Sc2COHH to evaluate the optical performance. Fig. 10 displays the absorption coefficients obtained from the TDHF-HSE06 approach, which has taken the excitonic effect into account. The absorption coefficients calculated by the DFT-HSE06 approach and the experimentally measured absorbance of intrinsic silicon are represented for comparison.67 As is seen, the absorption spectrum by the TDHF-HSE06 method is significantly higher than that from the DFT-HSE06 method, demonstrating the existence of the excitonic effect in the visible-light region. Sc2COHH shows dramatically higher light-harvesting than bulk silicon in the overall visible light spectrum range from 380 to 750 nm. The outstanding absorption properties make Sc2COHH a promising material for ideal solar absorbers.

Appropriate band edge positions of donor and acceptor semiconductors play a crucial role in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of XSC. Given the CBM (−4.40 eV) and VBM (−5.48 eV) levels of Sc2COHH, displayed in Fig. 11a, we chose monolayer InS with CBM of −4.44 eV and VBM of −6.89 eV as a suitable acceptor semiconductor to form a type-II heterostructure solar cell. We plotted the density of states (DOS) of Sc2COHH and InS by setting the vacuum level to 0 in Fig. S11.† The type-II heterostructure nature can be observed in Fig. S11,† the VBM of which is contributed by the Sc2COHH layer, while the CBM is dominated by the InS layer. The donor bandgap Eg and the energy difference between the conduction band offset of donor and the acceptor ΔEc are marked in Fig. S11,† from which the very small ΔEc guarantees the high PCE of the heterostructure solar cell. In such a designed heterostructure, after the 2D InS contact with the H atomic surface of Sc2COHH, photo-generated electrons will transfer from the CBM (Sc2COHH) to the CBM (InS), while holes will transport from the VBM (InS) to the VBM (Sc2COHH) simultaneously since electrons and holes become stable through moving down and up, respectively.69–71 Such phenomena can efficiently separate the photo-excited electrons and holes, which is favorable for photodetection and energy harvesting.2,72–74
 Fig. 11  (a) Schematic of the Sc2COHH/InS heterostructure band alignments. (b) Calculated PCE contour versus the donor bandgap and conduction band offset. 
To assess the quality of the Sc2COHH/InS heterostructure, we calculated the PCE η by the method proposed by Scharber et al.63,75 The maximum PCE for solar cells can be described according to the following equation: (5)in which 0.65 is the band-fill factor, P(ℏω)is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the value of ℏω for photon energy, and Eg is the bandgap of donor Sc2COHH. The (Eg − ΔEc − 0.3) term is an estimation of the maximum open-circuit voltage. ΔEc is the energy difference between the conduction band offset of the donor Sc2COHH and the acceptor InS. The integral of the numerator and denominator denotes the short-circuit current, assuming an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 100%, and the incident solar radiation, respectively. As highlighted with black stars in Fig. 11b, the solar cell model of the Sc2COHH/InS heterostructure could yield a PCE of 21.04%. This PCE value is larger than that of the recently designed ZrS3/HfS3 (16–18%),76 MoS2/bilayer phosphorene (16–18%),75 phosphorene/MoS2 heterobilayer (17.5%),77 and HfTeSe4/Bi2WO6 (20.8%).78 From the above, Sc2COHH is a promising donor material for forming high-efficiency heterostructure solar cells.
4. Conclusions
In summary, based on first-principles computations, we have thoroughly investigated a novel class of Janus MXene Sc2CTT′ (T, T′ = H, O, OH, F, Cl) for multifunctional applications. The stabilities of these ten Sc2CTT′ monolayers have been confirmed by formation energy and phonon calculations. We highlight that Sc2CTT′ has non-magnetism or magnetism, depending on the different functional groups. Interestingly, four O-group-containing structures Sc2COT′ exhibit half-metallic features with ferromagnetic ordering, while the other six are non-magnetic semiconductors. Significantly, 2D Sc2COCl has a high half-metallic gap of 0.98 eV, the Curie temperature of which can be as high as 292 K. Such advantages allow for applications as spintronic materials. We have demonstrated that Sc2CFCl, Sc2COHCl and Sc2CHCl monolayers are promising candidates for photocatalytic applications due to the favorable band edge positions, large internal electric field, high and broad efficient absorption in the visible and UV light regions. In particular, Sc2COHCl with a bandgap of 0.99 eV can be applied in photocatalytic water splitting under the near-infrared light region. The 2D Sc2COHH, as characterized by a moderately direct bandgap and high optical absorption in the visible-light range, is a suitable donor material for constructing heterostructure solar cell devices. The proposed Sc2COHH/InS heterostructure can achieve a PCE of up to 21.04%. It is expected that these new 2D Sc2CTT′ monolayers can be applied in spintronic, photocatalysis and heterostructure solar cells. Our exciting results provide new insights into the possible applications of Janus Sc2CTT, and also pave the way for designing more Janus MXenes in this field.
