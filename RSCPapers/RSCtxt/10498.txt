    , Accepted 13th March 2019First published on 15th March 2019AbstractProper molecular packing is key to improving the performance of non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) based on perylene diimides (PDI). Herein, we implement a novel concept of introducing intramolecular π–π stacking for the design of PDI-based acceptors. We synthesized and systematically studied two isomeric PDI-tetramers with different functionalization positions (α- and β-positions) of naphthalene, and thus different extents of intramolecular packing. Interestingly, both PDI molecules exhibit two π–π stacking peaks with intramolecular and intermolecular stacking distances of 3.7–3.8 Å and 4.6–4.7 Å, respectively. Most importantly, the α-positioned PDI shows stronger intramolecular π-stacked features as evidenced by UV-Vis and photoluminescence, and morphological measurements. Consequently, the α-positioned PDI achieved a higher device efficiency of 8.6% with an open-circuit voltage of 1.15 V and a reasonably high fill factor of 60%. Our work highlights the importance of intramolecular π–π stacking in the design of novel PDI-based SMAs.
Introduction
Great progress has been made in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs) in recent years, which can be mainly attributed to the development of non-fullerene acceptors and matching donor polymers.1–6 Tremendous research efforts have been dedicated to the molecular design of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) due to their low-cost synthesis, readily tunable absorption and energy levels, and morphological compatibility with different types of donor materials.7–13 Perylene diimides (PDI) are some of the promising electron-withdrawing building blocks to construct high-performance SMAs, owing to their easy accessibility, high electron affinity and mobility and intense absorption in the visible region.14–17
One of the design rationales for PDI-based SMAs is to introduce three-dimensional geometries with a sterically congested aromatic core flanking three or more PDI wings resembling a “propeller”.18–23 The highly twisted molecular geometry breaks the planarity of PDI molecules, which greatly alleviates the excessive intermolecular aggregation of PDIs which form micron-sized phase segregation when blended with donor polymers.24 Although an improved bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology with small domain sizes can be obtained via this strategy, the electron mobilities of these highly twisted PDI molecules and the fill factors (FF) of the devices inevitably decrease.7,20 This is because the crowded aromatic cores separate the flanking PDI units far away from each other, which hinders not only intermolecular but also intramolecular electronic interactions which are equally important for efficient electron transport processes.25,26 An intuitive thought is how the concept of intramolecular π-stacked PDI molecules can be applied to the field of OSCs, as it would provide an extra pathway for electron transport and positive effects on the optical and morphological properties of PDI-based devices. Previously, enforcing intramolecular π-stacks by rational design of the core structure of PDI molecules was shown to dramatically affect the electronic and vibrational coupling between the adjacent PDI subunits.27 The “folding” geometries of PDIs exhibit unique optical and electronic properties which provide in-depth insight into the self-assembly behavior, and charge and energy transfer processes of chromophores.28–34 Nonetheless, these intramolecular π-stacked PDI molecules were primarily designed for the purpose of fundamental studies instead of OSC operation, and therefore, to the best of our knowledge, few efficient OSC devices were reported based on this type of acceptor. This encouraged us to explore novel core structures for constructing intramolecular π-stacked PDI molecules to reveal the structure–property–performance relationship, which is of great interest and importance to the OSC field.
Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and device performances of two isomeric PDI-based SMAs based on the novel tetrathienylnaphthalene (TTN) cores and show how the extent of intramolecular π-stacking affects the photovoltaic performances of PDI-based SMAs. The two PDI molecules differ in the functionalization positions of the naphthalene ring, i.e., α- and β-positions (Fig. 1a). Most importantly, morphological studies show that both molecules exhibit two distinct π–π stacking modes, which are assigned to intra- and intermolecular stacking. Theoretical calculations reveal that the α-isomer (a-FTTN-PDI4) features a “double-decker” geometry containing two pairs of intramolecular π-stacked PDI units, while the PDI units of the β-isomer (b-FTTN-PDI4) show a lower extent of overlap. The different intramolecular π-stacking of these two PDI molecules was evidenced by UV-Vis and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra. In addition, better molecular packing (larger coherence length) is observed for a-FTTN-PDI4, which leads to higher electron mobility and domain purity in the blend film. Consequently, the devices based on a-FTTN-PDI4 showed the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.6% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.15 V, which outperformed that of b-FTTN-PDI4 (7.4%). As far as we know, this work is the first report on efficient devices based on intramolecular π-stacked PDIs and highlights the significance of simultaneously enhancing intra- and intermolecular packing for improving the device performances of PDI-based SMAs.

Results and discussion
The details of the synthesis of the two SMAs are summarized in the ESI.† All compounds were identified using NMR, mass spectra and elemental analysis. Their thermal stability was evaluated by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The decomposition temperatures at 5% weight loss are higher than 350 °C for both SMAs, indicative of their good thermal stability for photovoltaic applications. In addition, no obvious crystallization or melting peaks can be observed for both PDI molecules in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Fig. S2†) measurements, suggesting their mostly amorphous nature.
To gain insight into the differences in their molecular geometries, theoretical calculations were performed with the alkyl chains replaced by methyl groups for simplification. The detailed calculation method and the Cartesian coordinates of two SMAs are provided in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 1b, the α-positions on the same side of the naphthalene ring are parallel and close to each other, which would create large steric hindrance between the adjacent PDI units attached to these positions.35 Therefore, the adjacent PDI units of a-FTTN-PDI4 are forced to adopt a “face-to-face” conformation with an interchromophore distance of ∼3.6 Å. Notably, we tried different initial conformations of a-FTTN-PDI4, and all the optimized geometries consistently exhibited similar intramolecular π-stacked conformations (Fig. S3†). In contrast to a-FTTN-PDI4, the larger distance between the β-positions compared with the α-positions of the naphthalene ring posed less steric hindrance between the adjacent PDI units, which may allow conformational changes to other low-energy conformations rather than the co-facially stacked one (Fig. 1c). As a result, the optimal geometry of b-FTTN-PDI4 exhibits a less extent of intramolecular π-stacking with partial overlap of the adjacent PDI units resembling a “head-to-tail” arrangement, and a larger interchromophore distance of >3.8 Å.
To verify the existence of intramolecular π-stacking, UV-Vis measurements of the PDI molecules were performed, as they are known to be sensitive to the interchromophore distance and orientation.14,27 To obtain deeper insight into the intramolecular interactions of these two SMAs, a reference molecule, thiophene-fused PDI named PDIT (Fig. 2a), was also synthesized and included in the comparisons. The absorption spectra of PDIT, a-FTTN-PDI4 and b-FTTN-PDI4 in diluted chloroform solution (1 × 10−7 M) are shown in Fig. 2b, and the corresponding optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. PDIT shows two main absorption bands centred at 504 and 470 nm corresponding to the 0–0 and 0–1 transitions, respectively. While b-FTTN-PDI4 exhibits absorption peaks (λ0–0 = 501 nm, ε = 1.28 × 105 M−1 cm−1; λ0–1 = 470 nm, ε = 9.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1) similar to PDIT, and a-FTTN-PDI4 shows a slightly hypsochromic shift in its absorption spectrum with enhanced absorption coefficients (λ0–0 = 493 nm, ε = 1.45 × 105 M−1 cm−1; λ0–1 = 468 nm, ε = 1.47 × 105 M−1 cm−1). In addition, a-FTTN-PDI4 exhibits a broad peak at 550 nm which is absent in the absorption spectra of PDIT and b-FTTN-PDI4. This peak can be assigned to the naphthalene-to-PDIT intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), which can also be found in previous reports on PDI-based molecules with strong ICT features.7,34,36 Notably, the relative intensity of 0–1 and 0–0 transitions (I0–1/I0–0) is widely regarded as an indicator of the aggregation of PDI chromophores. The I0–1/I0–0 ratios of a-FTTN-PDI4, b-FTTN-PDI4 and PDIT amounted to 1.01, 0.76 and 0.64, respectively. The largest I0–1/I0–0 ratio of a-FTTN-PDI4 strongly suggests the presence of a co-facially π-stacked arrangement and through-space exciton coupling of the PDI chromophores. Furthermore, minimal spectral changes from variable-concentration UV-Vis experiments (concentration = 10−4 and 10−7 M) were observed for a-FTTN-PDI4, generally indicating no intermolecular aggregation of PDIs (Fig. S4†). This is further supported by their absorption spectra in the thin-film state, where the shapes of the spectra changed dramatically from those in the solution state (Fig. S5†). Therefore, we draw the conclusion that the spectral differences between a-FTTN-PDI4 and b-FTTN-PDI4 in the solution state originate from the intramolecular π-stacks of the PDI chromophores of a-FTTN-PDI4.

Furthermore, the photoluminescence (PL) properties of the PDI molecules in the diluted solution state were studied by steady-state as well as time-resolved techniques. Upon excitation at 500 nm, PDIT exhibited three distinct vibronic peaks located at 513, 550 and 593 nm (Fig. 2c), which is a mirror image of its absorption spectrum and characteristic of emission from isolated molecules. In contrast, both a-FTTN-PDI4 and b-FTTN-PDI4 showed only red-shifted, broad and featureless peaks centred at 607 and 558 nm, respectively. The decay kinetics of these PDI molecules were also probed at 600 nm by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). Similar PL lifetimes (τ) of 1.50 and 1.55 ns were measured for b-FTTN-PDI4 and PDIT, respectively (Fig. 2d). However, a-FTTN-PDI4 showed a decreased lifetime of 0.99 ns. Such a decreased PL lifetime of a-FTTN-PDI4 was also observed in the thin-film state, which is speculated to originate from the electronic coupling between the co-facially stacked PDI units in a-FTTN-PDI4 (Fig. S5†).
The electrochemical properties of the two SMAs were estimated from cyclic voltammetry measurements in the solid state (CV, Fig. S6†) against Fc/Fc+ as the external standard, and the results are shown in Fig. 2e. The LUMO levels of a-FTTN-PDI4 and b-FTTN-PDI4 are estimated from their electron affinities to be −3.61 and −3.58 eV, respectively, which are close to that of the donor polymer P3TEA (−3.56 eV). It is expected that when blending P3TEA and these two SMAs, the energetic offset between the donor and acceptor should be very small. To further prove this, the electroluminescence spectra (EL, Fig. 2f) of pristine P3TEA and the blend films were recorded. It was observed that the EL spectra of the blend films showed minimal changes relative to that of the pristine donor polymer, suggesting very small energetic differences between the singlet excited state (S1) and the charge transfer state (ECT) of the blends, i.e., the charge separation driving forces were negligible. As a result, enhanced VOC and reduced Vloss were expected for both blends.
To evaluate the photovoltaic performances of these SMAs, solar cells were fabricated by using the inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/P3TEA:SMA/MoO3/Al (Fig. 3a). The J–V characteristics and the photovoltaic parameters of the optimized devices with the use of thermal annealing and 1,8-octanedithiol as a solvent additive are shown in Fig. 3b and Table 2, respectively. The P3TEA:b-FTTN-PDI4 devices showed the highest PCE of 7.4% with a VOC of 1.15 V, JSC of 11.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 55%, while the P3TEA:a-FTTN-PDI4 devices yielded a higher PCE of 8.6% as a result of a simultaneously improved JSC of 12.0 mA cm−2 and FF of 61%. It is noted that both devices show good stability under thermal stress, which is one of the advantages of PDI-based materials (Fig. S7†).

The high VOC values of the two devices are attributed to the low Vloss of 0.57 V (derived from Vloss = Eg/q − VOC, where Eg is the bandgap of P3TEA which is 1.72 eV based on the crossing point between the absorption and emission spectra), which is the lowest value for efficient PDI-based devices with efficiencies >7%.7,22,23,37,38 On the one hand, these low Vloss values of these two systems are partially attributed to the high-lying ECT which are close to the Eg of P3TEA, which minimized the driving force and this part of loss. On the other hand, the non-radiative recombination loss (ΔVOC,nr) is another important part of voltage losses in the range of 0.34–0.44 V for conventional OSCs, which can be determined by the equation qΔVOC,nr = −kTln(EQEEL).39 The electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of the a-FTTN-PDI4 and b-FTTN-PDI4 based devices was measured to be 5 × 10−3, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of the state-of-the-art SF-PDI2-based OSCs with an EQEEL of 5 × 10−4 (Fig. 3c).38 Consequently, a very low non-radiative recombination loss of 0.20 V is estimated for both SMAs, which is one of the lowest ΔVOC,nr values measured for efficient PDI-based OSCs.7,38,40,41 Considering the small driving force and ΔVOC,nr, it is reasonable that the resulting VOC values of the two devices are as high as 1.15 V. Despite the low Vloss, the devices still exhibit a high EQE of ∼60%, indicative of efficient charge dissociation and collection of the devices (Fig. 3d). The enhancement of EQE of a-FTTN-PDI4 devices relative to that of the b-FTTN-PDI4 devices is mainly ascribed to the stronger extinction coefficient and improved BHJ morphology, which will be discussed in the later part. The efficient charge dissociation process of the devices was supported by the photoluminescence quenching (PLQ) experiment. High quenching efficiencies of 92% and 94% were measured for the a-FTTN-PDI4 and b-FTTN-PDI4 devices, respectively (Fig. S8†).
The microstructures of the blend films were probed by grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The two-dimensional patterns and the corresponding scattering profiles in the in-plane and out-of-plane direction of the pristine and blend films are depicted in Fig. 4a–e, and the morphology data are summarized in Table 3. Very interestingly, two π–π stacking (010) peaks were fitted for the a-FTTN-PDI4 (qz = 1.37 and 1.70 Å−1, corresponding to the π–π distances of 4.58 and 3.69 Å, respectively) and b-FTTN-PDI4 (qz = 1.33 and 1.63 Å−1, corresponding to the π–π distances of 4.72 and 3.85 Å, respectively) pristine films (Fig. S9†). The first π–π stacking peaks with π–π distances larger than 4 Å are assigned to the intermolecular packing of the PDI molecules, which is consistent with previous reports.7,37,42 However, it is speculated that the second π–π stacking peaks with π–π distances of 3.6–3.8 Å originate from intramolecular packing, as the π–π distance of the PDI monomer was found to be ∼3.5 Å depending on different substituents.43 This is consistent with the aforementioned prediction of DFT calculations about the potential intramolecular stacking. Note that the intramolecular stacking peaks are still discernible in the GIWAXS patterns of the blend films. a-FTTN-PDI4 showed a larger coherence length (CL010) of 42.4 Å in the blend film when compared with b-FTTN-PDI4 (15.3 Å), indicating that a-FTTN-PDI4 exhibited a stronger intramolecular π–π stacking tendency than b-FTTN-PDI4. Additionally, the electron mobility of a-FTTN-PDI4 obtained from the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method is indeed higher than that of b-FTTN-PDI4 (2.7 × 10−4vs. 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) in the blend films. As a result, the P3TEA:a-FTTN-PDI4 blend achieved a more balanced hole/electron mobility (μh/μe = 1.0) compared to the P3TEA:b-FTTN-PDI4 blend (μh/μe = 1.8).

In addition, resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was employed to characterize the domain spacing and domain purity of the blend films (Fig. 4f). Similar domain spacings of 21.7 and 23.3 nm were determined for the P3TEA:a-FTTN-PDI4 and P3TEA:b-FTTN-PDI4 blend films, under their optimal processing conditions, respectively. The phase segregation is also confirmed by their corresponding atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showing a smooth surface morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of <1 nm (Fig. S10†). Besides, it is widely believed that domain purity is the key parameter that significantly affects the FF of OSC devices.37,44 The average domain purity derived from integrated scattering intensity of the P3TEA:a-FTTN-PDI4 blend is higher than that of the P3TEA:b-FTTN-PDI4 blend (1.00 vs. 0.92). Moreover, suppressed bimolecular recombination was found in the P3TEA:a-FTTN-PDI4 blend, which further supported that the P3TEA:a-FTTN-PDI4 blend exhibits purer domains compared to the P3TEA:b-FTTN-PDI4 blend (Fig.S11†). The better molecular packing and purer domains of the P3TEA:a-FTTN-PDI4 blend account for the higher electron mobilities and thus contribute to the enhanced FFs of the devices, which is in line with the larger extent of intramolecular π-stacking of a-FTTN-PDI4 which facilitates molecular packing and charge transport as discussed above.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized two isomeric PDI tetramers with different functionalization positions (α- and β-positions) on a naphthalene ring. DFT calculations revealed that a-FTTN-PDI4 featured a “double-decker” geometry in which the adjacent PDI units formed a co-facially stacked alignment, whereas b-FTTN-PDI4 showed relatively less intramolecular stacking. The differences in molecular geometries of a-FTTN-PDI4 and b-FTTN-PDI4 were evidenced by UV-Vis and TRPL. Most importantly, morphology studies revealed that a-FTTN-PDI4 showed better intramolecular and intermolecular packing than b-FTTN-PDI4, resulting in higher electron mobilities and FFs. Consequently, the P3TEA:a-FTTN-PDI4 blends exhibited the highest PCE of 8.6%, which outperformed those of the P3TEA:b-FTTN-PDI4 blends. Efficient charge separation was found despite a high VOC of 1.15 V and a very low non-radiative recombination loss of 0.20 V. The excellent optical and morphological properties of a-FTTN-PDI4 highlight the importance of intramolecular π–π stacking in the design of novel PDI-based SMAs.
