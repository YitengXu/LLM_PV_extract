    , Accepted 7th July 2021First published on 7th July 2021AbstractA new non-fullerene small molecule acceptor (MPU6) containing a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor unit as the core, connected to dicyanomethylene-3-ethylrhodanine end-capped units via thienylethynylselenophene bridges, has been designed and synthesized and its optical and electrochemical properties have been examined. MPU6 has been used as an acceptor along with a wide bandgap polymer (TDTBTA) as the donor for solution-processed bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells, thus resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.14%, which is higher than that obtained when PC71BM is used as the acceptor (6.69%). The increase in PCE for the MPU6-based polymer solar cell is due to the increase in both VOC and JSC, while the FF is lower than that for PC71BM. In addition, PC71BM has been used as a second acceptor to form ternary PSCs, thus achieving a PCE of 15.60%, which is significantly higher than those for the binary counterparts. The increase in PCE for ternary PSCs may be linked to better charge transport and energy transfer, which leads to better utilization of excitons and also leads to the enhancement of JSC and FF.
Introduction
A dramatic increase in research in the field of solar cells has been witnessed in recent years due to the growing demand for clean energy. At present, commercially available solar cells are made from silicon and other inorganic materials, but their manufacturing processes are very complex, thus making them expensive in comparison with non-renewable resources like fossil fuels.1
In light of the above, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk heterojunctions (BHJs), which comprise a blend of a donor and an acceptor, have received increasing attention due to their light weight, flexibility, semitransparency and tuneable colour, and low cost of fabrication from solution at low temperatures.2–7 In the early days of OSCs, fullerene derivatives were extensively used as electron acceptors in the active layer of BHJs, along with either a conjugated polymer or small molecule as an electron donor, as they provide good electron mobility and high electron affinity, thus resulting in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of about 11%.8,9 However, fullerene-based acceptors suffer from some inherent disadvantages, such as poor absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum, low dielectric constant, difficulties of tuning the energy levels, and high energy loss, which limit the JSC and VOC values and, therefore, the commercialization of OSCs.10 To overcome these shortcomings, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NFSMAs) have been developed as their optical and electrochemical parameters can be easily adjusted through design,11–16 thus leading to better photon absorption, a high short circuit current (JSC), and a high dielectric constant, which leads to low energy losses,17,18 a higher open circuit voltage (VOC) and lower exciton binding energy, which in turn leads to an improved rate of exciton dissociation. With the rapid development of NFSMAs, optimization of the BHJ active layer and interface engineering, the PCE has been boosted in the range of 17–18% for single-junction OSCs containing conjugated polymers as the donor.19–23
The Achilles heel of most of the OSCs reported to date is the low VOC, usually in the order of 0.8–0.9 V, limiting the PCE. Thus, it is very important to design new molecules able to allow VOC values higher than 1 V. In this sense, VOC values as high as 1.3 V have been reported.24–26
Since more than 50% of solar radiation lies in the NIR region of the solar spectrum, the development of NIR-absorbing organic semiconducting materials (electron donors or electron acceptors) with an optical bandgap of less than 1.5 eV is desirable for the efficient use of solar radiation and achieving a high photocurrent in PSCs.27–29
Herein, we describe a new NFSMA, namely MPU6, with an A2–D–π–A1–π–D–A2 structure, containing a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor unit as the core, connected to dicyanomethylene-3-ethylrhodanine end-capped units via thienylethynylselenophene bridges (Chart 1). Selenophene is an analogue of thiophene in which the S atom is replaced by selenium. The bandgap of selenophene-based organic semiconducting materials is lower than that for their thiophene counterparts since selenophene can stabilize the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level more effectively.30–32 Moreover, Se is more polarizable than S, which might induce intermolecular Se–Se interactions and thus improve the charge-carrier mobility.33,34 In general, the subtle modification from S to Se causes a substantial change in the molecular properties owing to the different atomic sizes and electron configurations,35–38 and several papers have described the success of including selenophene in the conjugated system to enhance JSC.39,40 This novel compound MPU6 was used as the acceptor and paired with a wide band-gap copolymer, namely poly{(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)-alt-(2-(5-(3-octyl-tridecyl)thiophen-2-yl)dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-d]thiazole-5,8-diyl)} (TDTBTA),41 as the donor in OSCs. MPU6 and TDTBTA have complementary absorption in the range of 450–850 nm. Binary devices constructed with MPU6 and TDTBTA yielded a PCE of 13.14%, while in ternary devices with PC71BM as the secondary acceptor an excellent PCE of 15.60% was obtained after optimization.

Results and discussion
The synthetic approach to MPU6 is depicted in Scheme 1. It starts from dibromo-DPP derivative 142via a double Sonogashira coupling with trimethylsilylacetylene in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4, CuI and trimethylamine to give intermediate 2 in 96% yield. Subsequent displacement of the TMS protecting groups by reaction with KF provided alkyne 3 as a purple solid, in 96% yield, which was treated with 3,4-dihexyl-5-iodothiophene-2-carbaldehyde (4) in a copper-free Sonogashira reaction to give the bis-aldehyde 5 in 39% yield. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation of 5 and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethylrhodanine (6), catalysed by ammonium acetate/acetic acid, afforded MPU6 as a greenish brown solid in 67% yield. MPU6 shows good solubility in usual processing solvents such as dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, or toluene. The detailed synthetic procedures and structural characterization data (1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopies and MALDI-TOF spectrometry) can be found in the ESI‡ (Fig. S1–S13). The thermal properties of MPU6 were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As depicted in Fig. S14a (ESI‡), under a nitrogen atmosphere MPU6 exhibits a decomposition temperature with 5% weight loss at 360 °C. DSC (Fig. S14b, ESI‡) exhibits a clear melting peak at 255 °C, with no exothermic peak. These properties suggest that MPU6 is suitable for use in OSCs.

Theoretical calculations using density-functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-31 basis set were used to study the molecular geometry and frontier orbitals (FOs) of MPU6. The hexyl chains were substituted by an ethyl radical to simplify the calculations. As shown in Fig. 1a, MPU6 is almost planar, with dihedral angles less than 0.97°, and the bond lengths of the π-conjugated system are close to 1.40 Å (see the ESI‡), which is between a double (1.34 Å) and a single bond (1.54 Å) length, thus suggesting the participation of the quinoidal structure. In addition, the Se–O bond length of 2.86 Å is smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii of both atoms [Se (1.9 Å) and O (1.55 Å)], thus confirming that the S–O interaction favours the planarity of the π-conjugated system.

As displayed in Fig. 1b, the FOs of MPU6 are distributed along the entire conjugated backbone, thereby favouring the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process; the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.33 eV and −3.55 eV, respectively, in agreement with the values calculated by electrochemistry (Table 1). Fig. 1c shows the electrostatic potential distribution, with a higher electron density on the N and O atoms.

The absorption spectra of MPU6 were recorded in dichloromethane solution (1.6 × 10−6 M) and as a thin film; the corresponding data are presented in Table 1 along with those of TDTBTA. As shown in Fig. 2a, in dichloromethane solution, MPU6 shows the π–π* maximum at 488 nm and a broad and intense absorption with a maximum at 646 nm (logε = 4.96), which is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The maximum extinction coefficient of MPU6 is higher than that for the thiophene-containing analogue MPU3,43 which can be explained by the enhanced electron richness of selenophene, which results in a stronger ICT effect. The redshift and more intense absorption of MPU6 can be attributed to the loose electron cloud and high polarizability of Se, which enable a more quinoidal character of the molecule than its S analogue.44–46 In contrast, for the film, the charge-transfer peak shows a more defined vibronic structure, with clearly defined maxima at 686 and 750 nm (Δλmax = 40 and 104 nm, respectively), thus indicating the formation of J-aggregates. In addition, the optical band gap is 1.43 eV. As the absorption of TDTBTA is located in the range of 400–600 nm (Fig. 2b), the paired absorption of MPU6 and TDTBTA will afford efficient absorption in OSC devices.

Electrochemical Osteryoung square wave voltammetry (OSWV), and the corresponding oxidation and reduction curves are shown in Fig. S18 and S19 (ESI‡). These curves were used to evaluate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of MPU6, which were calculated to be −5.38 and −3.30 eV, respectively. Considering the HOMO of TDTBTA, the high LUMO of MPU6 would be favorable for achieving a high open-circuit voltage. The energy diagram is depicted in Fig. 2c.
As can be seen from Fig. 2c, the HOMO and LUMO offsets between TDTBTA and MPU6 are 0.16 and 0.40 eV, respectively. The LUMO offset is higher than the threshold value of the driving force (∼0.3 eV) for efficient electron transfer from the donor (TDTBTA) to the acceptor (MPU6), whereas the HOMO offset between TDTBTA and MPU6 is only 0.16 eV. In order to gain further information about hole transfer from the acceptor (MPU6) to the donor (TDTBTA), we recorded the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pristine MPU6 and its blend with TDTBTA, excited at 710 nm (Fig. 3), and found that the PL intensity of MPU6 is significantly quenched, thus indicating an efficient hole transfer from the HOMO of MPU6 into the HOMO of TDTBTA, despite the low value of the HOMO offset, as observed in most combinations of donor and non-fullerene acceptors.47,48

Photovoltaic properties
In order to investigate the photovoltaic performance of MPU6 as an electron acceptor we fabricated the PSCs by pairing a wide bandgap D–A conjugated polymer TDTBTA in a conventional device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TDTBTA:MPU6/PFN/Al. We also constructed PSCs using TDTBTA:PC71BM active layers with the same device configuration for comparison. The photovoltaic performance was optimized by varying the weight ratio between the donor (TDTBTA) and the acceptor (MPU6 or PC71BM) using chloroform as the processing solvent. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S1a and b (ESI‡). We found that the best photovoltaic performance was achieved at a donor-to-acceptor weight ratio of 1:2 and 1:1.5 for MPU6 and PC71BM, respectively. The optimized BHJ active layer was then subjected to solvent vapor annealing (SVA) in THF for different exposure times (the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S2a and b, ESI‡), with exposure of the active layer for 40 s showing the best photovoltaic performance. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the optimized PSCs under illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G) are presented in Fig. 4a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 2.

The PCE for the binary PSC with MPU6 as the electron acceptor is significantly higher (13.14%) than that based on PC71BM (6.69%). The higher PCE for the MPU6-based PSC is associated with higher values of both JSC and VOC than for its PC71BM counterpart. This higher value of JSC may be attributed to the broader absorption profile of the MPU6 active layer than for PC71BM (Fig. S20, ESI‡), thus indicating that the light harvesting efficiency is greater for the former active layer, which leads to more exciton generation. The higher value of VOC for the MPU6-based PSCs may be linked to the upshifted LUMO energy level of MPU6 (−3.70 eV) as compared to PC71BM (−6.10 eV), since VOC for BHJ-based PSCs is directly proportional to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor.49 However, the FF for MPU6 is smaller than that for PC71BM, possibly due to the fact that charge transport is more efficient in the TDTBTA:PC71BM-based device than its TDTBTA:MPU6 counterpart due to isotropic charge transport in PC71BM.8
In order to get more information about the higher value of JSC for MPU6-based PSCs with respect to those based on PC71BM, we measured the incident photon to current conversion (IPCE) spectra of the PSCs (see Fig. 4b). The IPCE spectra of the PSCs follow the absorption spectra of the corresponding active layers, thus indicating that both the donor and acceptor materials contribute to photocurrent generation. The IPCE spectra of the TDTBTA:PC71BM-based PSCs are limited up to 680 nm, whereas they extend up to 840 nm for the TDTBTA:MPU6 counterpart, thus suggesting that the exciton-generation rate in TDTBTA:MPU6 is larger than that for TDTBTA:PC71BM. A greater harvesting of photon energy may be one of the causes for this higher JSC value. The JSC values estimated by integration of the IPCE spectra for the devices are about 20.15 and 10.94 mA cm−2 for TDTBTA:MPU6 and TDTBTA:PC71BM, respectively, and thus are in good agreement with the values observed in the J–V characteristics under illumination.
As can be seen from Table 2, the VOC and JSC values for TDTBTA:MPU6 are higher than those for its TDTBTA:PC71BM counterpart, whereas FF is higher for TDTBTA:PC71BM than for TDTBTA:MPU6. Moreover, the IPCE value for the PSCs based on TDTBTA:MPU6 is almost negligible in the shorter wavelength region (below 400 nm), whereas the IPCE value for TDTBTA:PC71BM is quite high in this wavelength region. Therefore, in order to increase the PCE of our photovoltaic devices, we manufactured PSCs comprising a ternary active layer, i.e.TDTBTA:PC71BM:MPU6. A ternary approach with either two donors and one acceptor or one donor and two acceptors has been proposed to improve the utilization of photon energy as much as possible.50–54 As the processing conditions for both the binary TDTBTA:PC71BM and TDTBTA:MPU6 are similar, we designed an approach to fabricate a donor:acceptor1:acceptor2 (D:A1:A2) ternary PSC to overcome the limitations of both binary devices and to improve the PCE of PSCs. MPU6 is used to extend the light absorption, and increase VOC, whereas PC71BM is used to disturb the molecular stacking of MPU6 to optimize its aggregation and phase separation as well as the donor/acceptor interfacial area in the blend active layers. Additionally, the high electron mobility of PC71BM increases the FF of the ternary PSCs. Moreover, these three-materials form cascade-like energy levels (Fig. 2c), which accelerates charge transfer at the D/A interfaces. There are three possible routes for charge transfer in ternary PSCs. We varied the weight ratios between the two acceptors and kept the concentration of donor constant. The photovoltaic parameters for the PSCs based on ternary active layers with different weight ratios for the two acceptors, processed using chloroform as the solvent, are summarized in Table S3a (ESI‡). Subsequently, the as-cast optimized ternary active layer was subjected to solvent vapor annealing (SVA) in THF for different exposure times, and the ternary active layer exposed for 40 s was found to show the best photovoltaic performance (Table S3b, ESI‡). The PSC based on TDTBTA:PC71BM:MPU6 (1:0.3:0.9 w/w/w) showed the best photovoltaic performance. The J–V characteristics of the optimized ternary PSC upon illumination are shown in Fig. 4a and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The VOC of the ternary PSCs (0.97 V) lies between the values for the binary PSCs (TDTBTA:PC71BM = 0.89 V; TDTBTA:MPU6 = 1.04 V), which is consistent with the LUMO levels of PC71BM (−6.10 eV) and MPU6 (−3.70 eV), thus implying that the two acceptors form an alloy.55,56 This means that MPU6 and PC71BM exhibit strong electronic interactions, have good miscibility and are well mixed at the molecular level.57,58 The JSC and FF values for the ternary PSC are 22.65 mA cm−2 and 0.71, respectively, and are thus higher than for binary TDTBTA:PC71BM (11.22 mA cm−2 and 0.67) and TDTBTA:MPU6 (20.38 mA cm−2 and 0.62). The increase in FF may be associated with the well-optimized phase separation induced when employing PC71BM as the third component. By optimizing the ternary active layer, the maximum PCE of TDTBTA:PC71BM:MPU6-based PSCs increased significantly to 15.60% (Table 2), which is 19% higher than for TDTBTA:MPU6 and 96% higher than for TDTBTA:PC71BM, thus demonstrating that MPU6 and PC71BM cooperate to overcome the drawbacks of each other.
It can be seen from the IPCE spectra that the binary TDTBTA:PC71BM PSC has a significantly narrower spectral response than that based on TDTBTA:MPU6 (Fig. 4b), thus indicating that MPU6 could significantly expand light absorption by PSCs in the longer wavelength region. The IPCE spectrum of the ternary PSC exhibits a broad spectral response in the range of 300 to 850 nm, thus demonstrating that photocurrent generation in the PSC is derived from all components in the ternary active layer. The overall IPCE value for the ternary PSC is higher than for TDTBTA:MPU6 over the whole wavelength region studied, thus indicating that more photogenerated excitons in the active layer are dissociated into free charge carriers that are efficiently collected by the electrodes. This indicates that the incorporation of a small amount of PC71BM in binary TDTBTA:MPU6 increases light absorption and also plays a role in improving charge-carrier transport, leading to an increase in both JSC and FF.
In order to examine the energy/charge transfer between the two acceptors in the present ternary active layer, PL spectra of pristine PC71BM, MPU6 and PC71BM/MPU6 were measured (excitation wavelength 490 nm; see Fig. 5a). It can be seen from this figure that pristine PC71BM shows a strong PL peak at 712 nm when excited at 490 nm, which is almost quenched in the blend, thus indicating that the excited charge carriers in PC71BM may be more efficiently transferred towards MPU6 than towards TDTBTA.
 Fig. 5  PL spectra of (a) pristine PC71BM, MPU6 and PC71BM:MPU6, excited at 500 nm, and (b) absorption spectra of MPU6 and PL spectra of PC71BM (excitation wavelength 490 nm). 
We assume that the MPU6/PC71BM acceptor alloy could generate an effective charge cascade energy level system, thus allowing charge flow from TDTBTA to MPU6 and PC71BM owing to the tuneable HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the acceptor alloy. It should be noted that the PL spectrum of the PC71BM film apparently overlaps with the absorption spectrum of MPU6 (Fig. 5b), thus suggesting that efficient energy transfer from PC71BM to MPU6 may occur according to a Förster resonance energy transfer (FERT) model.59–64 In order to validate the occurrence of FRET in the acceptor alloy, the PL spectra of the pristine films of MPU6, PC71BM and PC71BM/MPU6 (0.2/1.0) blend were recorded (see Fig. 5a). When excited at 490 nm, the PL peak of PC71BM (∼712 nm) is significantly quenched in the PC71BM:MPU6 blend, whereas the PL intensity of MPU6 in this blend is enhanced compared to the pristine MPU6 film. This observation indicates FRET from PC71BM to MPU6. Based on the above observations, we conclude that both efficient charge transfer and FRET between PC71BM and MPU6 exist in this ternary film. A proposed working mechanism is presented in Fig. 6.

To gain more information about charge transport in the binary and ternary devices, we employed the space charge limited current (SCLC) model to estimate hole and electron mobilities. The configurations ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/Al/active layer/Al were adopted for hole-only and electron-only devices, respectively. The dark J–V characteristics of hole- and electron-only devices are shown in Fig. S21a and b (ESI‡), respectively. The TDTBTA:MPU6 blend film exhibits a hole mobility (μh) of about 3.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility (μe) of 1.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with a μh/μe ratio of 2.60. TDTBTA:PC71BM showed a higher μh (4.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (2.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), with a μh/μe ratio of 2.06. The improvement in both μe and μh for the TDTBTA:PC71BM device is responsible for the higher value of FF for those PSCs based on PC71BM as the acceptor. The incorporation of PC71BM into TDTBTA:MPU6 increased the electron mobility from 1.24 × 10−4 to 2.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the hole mobility remained essentially unchanged (3.23 × 10−4vs. 3.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), thus indicating that the ternary blend exhibits a more balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 1.54) in comparison to binary TDTBTA:MPU6 (μh/μe = 2.60) and favouring a higher PCE.65
As the photocurrent in PSCs is normally associated with exciton generation and their dissociation into free charges and extraction by the electrodes, the variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) of the devices was employed to get this information66,67 (see Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Variation of photocurrent (Jph) with effective voltage for PSCs based on the optimized binary and ternary active layers. 

J
ph and Veff were estimated as Jph = JL − JD and Veff = Vo − Va, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively, Va is the applied voltage and Vo is the voltage when Jph is zero. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the Jph for all devices reaches the saturation photocurrent (Jsat) at a high value of Veff, thus indicating that all the photogenerated excitons in these devices are effectively dissociated into free charge carriers and then transported and collected by the two electrodes. The exciton generation rate (Gmax) is estimated as Gmax = Jsat/qL, where Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density, q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. The Gmax values for TDTBTA:PC71BM, TDTBTA:MPU6 and TDTBTA:PC71BM:MPU6 are 0.78 × 1028, 1.38 × 1028 and 1.52 × 1028 m−3 s−1, respectively. The fact that the Gmax value for TDTBTA:MPU6 is higher than that for TDTBTA:PC71BM may be associated with the broader absorption spectra of MPU6 as compared to PC71BM, since Gmax is directly associated with the absorption profile of the active layer. Moreover, this observation is consistent with the higher value of JSC for TDTBTA:MPU6 than for TDTBTA:PC71BM. The Gmax value for the ternary active layer-based device is higher than that for its binary counterparts, which may also be attributed to the broader absorption profile of the ternary active layer. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and charge collection efficiency (Pcoll) were estimated as Jph/Jsat under short circuit conditions and maximum power point, respectively. The ternary-based PSC exhibits higher Pdiss (0.98) and Pcoll (0.81) values than its binary counterparts, i.e. Pdiss/Pcoll for PC71BM (0.94/0.77) and MPU6 (0.93/0.76). These results suggest that the ternary-based PSC features more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection processes, which in turn lead to higher values for JSC and FF.
In addition to exciton generation and dissociation in the BHJ active layer, JSC and FF are also associated with charge recombination during transportation. To get this information, we investigated the variation of VOC and JSC with illumination intensity (Pin) for both binary and ternary PSCs (see Fig. 8a and b).
 Fig. 8  Variation of (a) VOC and (b) JSC with illumination intensity (Pin) for binary and ternary devices. 
The variation of VOC with Pin can be depicted as VOC ∝ ln(Pin) with a slope of nkT/q.68 As shown in Fig. 8a, the slope of 1.14 kT/q observed for TDTBTA:PC71BM:MPU6 is lower than that for its binary TDTBTA:PC71BM (1.26 kT/q) and TDTBTA:MPU6 (1.30 kT/q) counterparts. This indicates that trap-assisted recombination can be effectively suppressed by incorporating PC71BM into the host TDTBTA:MPU6 binary active layer, thus resulting in improved JSC and FF values for the optimized ternary PSCs. The variation of JSC with Pin can be expressed as JSC ∝ (Pin)α, where the exponential factor α gives information about the degree of bimolecular recombination.68,69 The α values estimated from Fig. 8b are 0.94, 0.91 and 0.98 for TDTBTA:PC71BM, TDTBTA:MPU6 and TDTBTA:PC71BM:MPU6s, respectively, thus indicating that tweaked bimolecular recombination occurs in the ternary PSCs. These observations show that the incorporation of PC71BM into TDTBTA:MPU6 can suppress bimolecular recombination, thus explaining the higher JSC and FF values for the ternary PSC. This is also consistent with the charge-carrier mobility data for the binary and ternary PSCs, as examined using the SCLC model.
In order to gain further information about the morphology of the active layers, we recorded transmission electron microscopy images of binary TDTBTA:MPU6 and ternary TDTBTA:PC71BM:MPU6 (see Fig. 9). It can be seen from this figure that the ternary film shows a slightly more phase-separated network than its binary counterpart, which results in more efficient charge transport. This may be one of the reasons for the increase in FF for the ternary PSC.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed a new narrow bandgap NFA (MPU6) with an optical bandgap of 1.43 eV and the HOMO and LUMO of about −5.54 and −3.70 eV, respectively. MPU6 has been used as an acceptor together with a wide bandgap D–A copolymer TDTBTA (HOMO and LUMO energy levels of about −5.38 and −3.30 eV, respectively) to construct PSCs with an overall PCE of 13.14%, which is higher than that obtained when PC71BM is used as the acceptor (6.69%). As the FF for the PC71BM-based PSC is higher than that for its MPU6-containing counterpart and JSC is higher for the latter, we manufactured PSCs using the ternary active layer (TDTBTA:PC71BM:MPU6). After optimization, a PCE of about 15.60% was achieved, possibly due to the enhancement of FF as well as JSC compared to TDTBTA:MPU6, associated with an efficient charge transport and energy transfer from PC71BM to MPU6.
