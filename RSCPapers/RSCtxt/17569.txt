    , Accepted 20th August 2014First published on 2nd September 2014AbstractLuminescent materials derived from the functionalization of zeolite with lanthanide (Ln3+/zeolite) constitute an intense research topic since such materials combine the attractive properties (e.g., tunable morphology, high stability, and low cost) of zeolite and unique optical properties of Ln3+ ions (such as sharp and long-lived emission in the visible to NIR region with high color purity). Starting from a short summary on some preparation strategies of Ln3+/zeolite, this highlight article reviews state-of-the-art research activities focusing on the improved visible and near-infrared (NIR) luminescence properties of lanthanide in these systems, the design and utilization of Ln3+/zeolite as new building blocks for the fabrication of multicolor oriented zeolite thin film, transparent zeolite–polymer hybrid materials and luminescence sensors.

1. Introduction
Zeolites are microporous crystalline aluminosilicates consisting of [AlO4] and [SiO4] tetrahedra that are connected to form a network of channels and cavities where cations, water and/or small molecules may reside.1–4 Zeolite crystals have been widely used in a broad spectrum of applications in catalysis, ion-exchange and separation due to their unique porous properties.5,6 In recent years, they have attracted considerable interest for the preparation of novel materials designed at the nanosized level and they are of particular interest in the area of optical materials where pre-defined distances or a specific spatial pattern of the guests is required to obtain a desired optical response.7–12 Especially, by the combination of the unique photophysical properties of Ln3+ ions (such as sharp and long-lived emission in the visible to NIR region with high color purity)13–16 and the attractive properties (e.g., tunable morphology, high stability, and low cost) of zeolites, a variety of luminescent Ln3+/zeolite host–guest materials are successfully prepared as new phosphors.17–23 Up to now, the typical hosts used for Ln3+ ions or lanthanide complexes are two types of synthetic zeolites, including faujasite-type zeolite (i.e. zeolite X and zeolite Y)7,20 and zeolite L.11,23–27 In addition, there have been a few reports on Ln3+/zeolite A or ZSM-5-based host–guest materials.22,28–34
Zeolites X and Y with the cubic faujasite (FAU) framework structure (Fig. 1a) are the most important zeolites for industrial applications, with two typical formulas: Na86[(AlO2)86(SiO2)106]·264H2O for zeolite X and Na56[(AlO2)56(SiO2)136]·264H2O for zeolite Y.13 They are distinguished by their Si/Al ratio (Si/Al <1.5 for zeolite X, Si/Al >1.5 for zeolite Y) and consequently by their Na+ content.35 All zeolite frameworks can be built by linking a building unit in a periodic pattern that is the tetrahedron. As a primary building unit of zeolite, the tetrahedron depicted as [SiO4] and [AlO4] is formed by the center atoms (such as SiIV and AlIII) with relatively low electronegativities and the oxygen atoms located at the corners.36 In the case of zeolites X and Y, the tetrahedral connection of [SiO4] and [AlO4] produces a cubic FAU framework structure consisting of two different types of cages: the sodalite cage (β-cage) and the supercage (α-cage). The sodalite cage, with an internal diameter of 0.66 nm and square and hexagonal faces, is the basic building block of this zeolite. The supercage, which is the largest cage with a diameter of 1.2 nm, is created from eight sodalite cages.37 The large channels and cavities of the faujasite structure allow the adsorption of relatively numerous organic molecules.13 As a representative example of the early investigation, in 1994 Kynast and co-workers7 successfully achieved Ce3+-doped zeolites X and Y and studied their optical properties. Efficient broad ultraviolet (UV) emission with extremely high quantum yields up to 99% was observed for the Ce3+ ion encapsulated in zeolites X and Y due to the allowed nature of the electronic f–d transitions within the Ce3+ ion, thus opening exciting prospects for optical and medical applications.

Zeolite L (ZL) is a crystalline aluminosilicate in which corner-sharing [SiO4] and [AlO4] tetrahedra produce one-dimensional (1D) channels arranged in a hexagonal framework structure as shown in Fig. 1b.38 These 1D channels, strictly parallel to the c-axis of ZL crystal, run through the whole crystal. The stoichiometry of ZL is (M+)9[(AlO2)9(SiO2)27]·nH2O, where M+ are monovalent cations compensating for the negative charge resulting from the aluminum atoms and n is 21 in fully hydrated materials and 16 at about 22% relative humidity.39 The channels of ZL with a unit cell length of 0.75 nm have the smallest diameter of about 0.71 nm, and the largest internal diameter is about 1.26 nm. The distance between the centers of two channels is 1.84 nm. Each ZL crystal consists of a large number of channels in which suitable guests can be incorporated. It has been synthesized in a size range starting from about 30 nm up to more than 20 μm as elongated, barrel, and disc-shaped crystals.39 ZL was originally studied for catalytic applications.4 Recently, it has attracted important interest as a host for preparing hybrid materials, and much research work on dye/ZL host–guest materials has been done by Calzaferri and co-workers.38,40 They have made a significant contribution in studying the intriguing optical, photochemical, and photophysical properties of these materials.10,40–42 Through supramolecular organization of dyes into the channels of ZL, extremely high concentrations of monomeric dye molecules can be nicely achieved, owing to the geometrical constraint of the ZL framework.38 In addition, the confined molecules can be well protected from chemical attack, photobleaching or thermal decomposition.43 Furthermore, ZL crystals show a very important property of different reactivity between the base and the coat because of their hexagonal structure, which allows for the selective modification of base or coat by carefully designing the reaction conditions and using crystals with the right morphology.40 Considering the merits of ZL crystals and encouraged by the promising results from Ln3+ species in other zeolites, we have developed a series of host–guest materials based on ZL crystals and Ln3+ species.11,23,26,44 The advantages of ZL instead of other zeolites and silica are as follows: 1) the size of the ZL crystal can be synthetically tuned from 30 nm to 20 μm with different morphologies, ranging from discs to elongated cylinders, for use in different experiments, 2) the hexagonal structure of ZL crystals has strictly parallel one-dimensional channels, and 3) the facile functionalization of the surface of ZL with targeting groups.
In this review article, we present an overview of the preparation methods, luminescence properties and hybrid systems of host–guest materials obtained from Ln3+-functionalized various microporous crystalline aluminosilicate crystals reported in the past two decades (Fig. 2). We firstly introduce how Ln3+/zeolite materials can be prepared. Then we demonstrate the very distinguished luminescence performance of these materials and explain why the luminescence properties of Ln3+ species incorporated into zeolite crystals can be strongly improved in visible and NIR spectral regions. In view of most recent work contributing to the studies of luminescence properties of Ln3+/zeolite host–guest materials, herein, we especially highlight the development of Ln3+/ZL as versatile building blocks for the fabrication of multicolor oriented zeolite thin films, transparent zeolite–polymer hybrid materials and luminescence sensors in our laboratory. The microenviroment in the channels of ZL as well as its influence on the luminescence behavior of encapsulated lanthanide complexes is also discussed. As an analogy of lanthanide-containing zeolite, lanthanide metal–organic frameworks (LnMOFs) are the subject of an intensive research field and have been well summarized in several excellent review papers,45–47 which are therefore not included in this review.

2. Preparation
The encapsulation of Ln3+ species into the cavities and channels of zeolite crystals can be achieved by ion exchange for only pure Ln3+ ions involved,7,48 or by direct physisorption27,49 or an in situ synthesis inside the zeolite voids called “ship-in-a-bottle” method17,18,20 for lanthanide complexes. Pure Ln3+-exchanged zeolites can be easily synthesized by stirring a zeolite suspension in an aqueous solution containing an excess of lanthanide(III) salt (such as lanthanide nitrate or chloride) at a suitable pH and room temperature or under heating conditions.50 Lanthanide ions can replace the exchangeable cations such as Na+ or K+ that compensate for the negatively charged framework due to the isomorphical substitution of a silicon atom by an aluminum atom. Except for a few rare pure Ln3+-exchanged zeolite samples with high luminescence quantum yields (QY),7 most of them usually exhibit poor emission intensity owing to their low absorption efficiency resulting from the forbidden nature of the f–f transition of the Ln3+ ions, which were used as a probe to obtain information on the structure and the environment inside the cages in which the cations are located rather than luminescent materials.31,49,51–53 There have been some effective ways, such as co-doping diverse ions or calcination after ion exchange, to strongly improve the luminescence efficiency of Ln3+-exchanged zeolite.26,50,54–58 Borgmann et al.54 firstly described the phase transformation of Ln3+/molybdate ion co-doped zeolite X into the highly luminescent sodalites with QY >50% after thermal treatment at 1000 °C. Normally, high temperature is required to produce high luminescence efficiency.
An alternative strategy, typically called “ship-in-a-bottle” method,18,59 is to in situ coordinate the Ln3+ ions confined in the cavities of Ln3+-exchanged zeolites under the rigorous exclusion of moisture in a sealed container by the use of organic ligands with large molar absorption coefficients for improving the luminescence efficiency of Ln3+via the so-called antenna effect.16,60 This name is derived from an artistic bottle incorporating a ship that is bigger than the neck of the bottle. In the field of chemistry, it means that the in situ synthesis of compounds as guest materials is confined in a host material. This can be achieved by inserting adequately small molecules and ions into the cavities of the host and then allowing further reaction until the product is too large to escape the cavities.8 A variety of efficient light-emitting lanthanide complex/zeolite materials in visible and NIR regions have been synthesized in different zeolite frameworks.11,17,18,20,21,61,62 Wang et al.11 prepared luminescent host–guest materials by insertion of 2,2′-bipyridine(bpy) into the channels of Eu3+/ZL and Tb3+/ZL. The procedure is illustrated in Fig. 3. The lanthanide complexes Eu3+(bpy)n and Tb3+(bpy)n are formed in the channels of ZL. A large increase in luminescence intensity is observed after the incorporation of bpy due to the energy transfer from bpy to Ln3+ ions. Most importantly, the encapsulated luminescent complexes show remarkably improved thermal stability. Upon heat treatment of Tb3+(bpy)n-ZL and pure Tb3+(bpy)2Cl3·2H2O complex in air at 400 °C for 4 h, the Tb3+(bpy)n-ZL host–guest material still displays green emission with the characteristic four strong and narrow lines, while most of the narrow lines for the pure Tb3+(bpy)2Cl3·2H2O complex have disappeared. This indicates that the lanthanide complex inside ZL is stable up to 400 °C; however, the pure Tb3+(bpy)2Cl3·2H2O complex completely decomposes at 400 °C. Besides, pre-prepared lanthanide complexes can be directly incorporated into the cavities of zeolites by a facile physisorption method.27,49 Some representative examples of Ln3+/zeolite host–guest materials achieved by the above-mentioned preparation methods with different parameters including zeolite type, Ln3+ ions, co-doped ions, organic ligands, emission spectral region and QY are summarized in Table 1. The luminescence enhancement of Ln3+/zeolite host–guest materials by some key influence factors will be discussed in more detail in the following independent section.

3. Luminescence enhancement of Ln3+/zeolite in visible and NIR spectral regions
3.1 Thermal treatment
The luminescence efficiency of most purely Ln3+-exchanged zeolite crystals is very low, for instance, quantum yield is <1% for pure Eu3+-doped zeolite X.18 Recent studies revealed that a low lying O → Eu3+ charge transfer (CT) transition of both hydrated and dehydrated samples is mainly responsible for the low efficiency, which strongly deactivates the excited state of Eu3+, along with low QY also partly resulting from the coupling of the Eu3+ 5D0 state with high-energy vibrations of OH species, such as water molecules in the zeolite cavity.13,18 The enhancement of luminescence by a suitable thermal treatment is generally attributed to the dehydration,18 the migration of the Eu3+ ions from the supercages to the sodalite cages,52 and the phase transformation to the sodalites.19,54 Interestingly, a strong and bright violet-blue emission color was observed upon irradiation of the calcined Eu3+/ZLs at 700 °C in air under UV light (Fig. 4a).26 The emission spectrum reveals a strong broad band in the range of 350 to 450 nm with a maximum at 409 nm, and almost no sharp emission lines due to the 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–4) can be observed. The band appears when the samples are annealed at 300 °C, the intensity of which increases with increasing annealing temperature from 300 to 700 °C. However, further increasing the temperature leads to a decreased intensity. The violet-blue emission band is attributed to Eu2+, resulting from the reduction of Eu3+ located in the channels of ZL. The presence of Eu2+ species in the channels of ZL was confirmed by XPS as reported by Ding et al.,68 and they also found that the emitting color of the annealed Eu3+/ZLs can be controlled by changing the solvents used in the washing step during preparation of the samples. Eu3+/ZL crystals washed with deionized water or methanol followed by calcination at 700 °C produce strong violet-blue emission (Fig. 4a and b), whereas those washed with ethanol produce bright red luminescence (Fig. 4c). The frameworks of ZLs play a vital role in protecting the Eu2+ species since only red emission can be obtained by heating the sample at 1100 °C, which causes the collapse of the frameworks of ZLs (Fig. 4d).
 Fig. 4  Eu3+/ZL samples washed by solvents and calcined at different temperature: (a) washed with H2O and calcined at 700 °C, (b) washed with MeOH and calcined at 700 °C, (c) washed with EtOH and calcined at 700 °C, and (d) washed with H2O and calcined at 1100 °C. 
Near-infrared luminescent lanthanide materials, as efficient NIR light emitters, have presented considerable potential for applications in optoelectronics and telecommunication technologies. Although zeolite crystals have been used as excellent host materials for loading NIR Ln3+ ions, it is difficult to observe NIR luminescence for pure NIR Ln3+-exchanged zeolites owing to the intensive nonradiative relaxation of the excited states of the NIR Ln3+ ions by the water molecules confined in the zeolite cages.13 However, upon calcination at high temperatures, microporous titanosilicate ETS-10 doped with Er3+ ions transforms into narsarsukite with strong NIR luminescence.67 Mech et al.69 recently reported an efficient NIR emission in the annealed Er3+/ZL crystals, which results from the energy transfer from the excited oxygen vacancies generated during the annealing process. The emission can be finely excited in the whole near UV-VIS-NIR spectral range of 355 to 700 nm. This work shows us the first step toward versatile, zeolite-based NIR sources that can be excited with white light (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  NIR photoluminescence spectra of the annealed Er3+/ZL sample recorded in the Ti:sapphire 360–700 nm excitation range, with a power pulse of 200 mW.69 
Interestingly, Bai and co-workers70 firstly observed a strong white-light emission from annealed pure zeolite Y crystals under ultraviolet light excitation. As shown in Fig. 6a, all samples exhibit broad emission bands covering the whole visible region, and the emission intensity of annealed zeolite samples increases by raising annealing temperature from 100 °C to 500 °C. Further increase in annealing temperature leads to the fast quenching of emission (Fig. 6b). Meanwhile, the emission peak shifts from 495 nm to 530 nm and then returns to 500 nm. The strongest emission intensity appears at an annealing temperature of 500 °C with highest luminescence quantum yield of ~10% (Fig. 6b). Moreover, the emission lifetime monotonously increases from 223 μs to 251 μs with increasing annealing temperature from 100 °C to 700 °C. The origin of white-light emission is ascribed to oxygen vacancies formed during the annealing process. These new findings make the annealed zeolites promising white-light-emitting luminophores for solid-state lighting (SSL).

The inset shows the photographs of the Z-100 °C (left) and Z-500 °C (right) samples excited by 325 nm with a power density of 2 mW cm−2.70 
3.2 Co-doping ions
Despite thermal treatment of Ln3+-exchanged zeolites, the total luminescence output remains relatively low owing to their weak absorption efficiency arising from the forbidden nature of the f–f transition of Ln3+ ions. In order to enhance the luminescence from Ln3+/zeolites, various ions, such as Ce3+,50,63 metalates (e.g., MoO42− and WO42−),19,54 Ag+,57 and Bi3+,55,65,71 have been co-doped into the Ln3+-functionalized zeolites. By heat treatment, the obtained multicomponent ion co-doped zeolites can be converted into efficient luminescent materials showing strong luminescence. Recently, energy transfer between Ce3+ and Tb3+ in zeolite X has been extensively studied by Kynast and co-workers.50 The Ce3+ ion can transfer the excitation energy to the Tb3+ ion with an energy transfer efficiency of about 90% after the strong absorption of 254 nm light. The highest QY of 85% for Tb3+ emission sensitized by Ce3+ can be achieved by excitation at 330 nm. Energy transfer from Ce3+ → Tb3+ can also occur in zeolite Y, whereas no evidence of energy transfer can be found in ZSM-5 and zeolite A.63 In addition, co-doping Eu3+ and Tb3+ in the same zeolite Y matrix followed by thermal treatment at 800 °C has demonstrated multicolor luminescence, including blue (434 nm), green (543 nm), and red (611 nm) colors.72 This luminescent material may lead to potential applications in white-light-emitting devices and erasable optical storage.
It is well known, owing to all inorganic bismuth compounds with a low melting point, that bismuth-related dissociation reactions in zeolite cages can occur upon calcination at a high temperature.73 Moreover, bismuth compounds tend to form agglomerates owing to bismuth migration in zeolite cages or channels. When the samples are suddenly cooled down, the agglomerates can act as blocks for selectively closing down the “in–out windows” of water molecules, i.e. Ln3+ can be sealed in a low-vibrational environment by bismuth agglomerates, which leads to strong and long-lived visible and NIR emission.65,71 Sun et al.65 demonstrated the highly efficient and air-stable NIR (1531 nm) emission from annealed erbium/bismuth co-doped zeolite Y crystals with a long luminescence lifetime of 4.2 ms at 1531 nm, which may be due to some Er3+ ions sealed completely in the sodalite cages and hexagonal prisms through bismuth agglomerates after thermal treatment of samples at 830 °C and water molecules mostly existing in the supercages without a chance to interact with them (Fig. 7a). The results clearly revealed that efficient NIR emission can be achieved under atmospheric circumstances by effectively separating Ln3+ ions from coordinated water in porous zeolite hosts, even a large number of water molecules trapping in the samples. Similarly, Li and co-workers55 observed strong red emission and NIR emission from annealed Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Nd) and Bi3+ co-doped zeolite L crystals at 700 °C (Fig. 7b). Photoluminescence studies reveal a lifetime of 1.93 ms and a 5D0 quantum efficiency (QY = 66.98%) for Eu3+ in the Eu3+/Bi3+-ZL when excited into the absorption line of Eu3+ at 395 nm. Besides, a longer lifetime of 0.196 ms for Nd3+ in the annealed Nd3+/Bi3+-ZL has been obtained compared to values for Nd3+ in the other zeolite hosts. Furthermore, the morphology and size distribution of ZL crystals are well retained during the synthesis process. The presented results show an important rational strategy for the design of strongly visible and NIR-emitting zeolite-based materials, and these findings may pave the way for the applications of Ln3+ ion-doped zeolite materials in different optical devices.

Very recently, the upconversion (UC) fluorescence properties of Bi/Er/Yb co-doped zeolite Y crystals have been investigated by Bai and co-workers.66 Intense green and red emission bands with emission peaks at 532 nm, 554 nm and 664 nm are simultaneously observed at room temperature. It is revealed that the UC emission bands can be well tuned by the change in Yb3+ concentration in zeolites. With the increase in Yb3+ concentration, the green and red emission bands are enhanced about 5 and 243 times, respectively. Moreover, the intensity ratio of red-to-green emission increases from 0.26 to 12.2. The tuned emission originates from an energy back transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ ions. It is expected that the resulting intense single band red emission of the Bi/Er/Yb co-doped zeolites will provide potential application for in vivo bioimaging.
3.3 Sensitized luminescence with organic molecules
The optical transitions of the lanthanide Ln3+ ions involve 4f orbitals which are strongly shielded from the chemical environment by 5s2 and 5p6 electrons. The f–f transitions are parity forbidden, which results in very small absorption coefficients and slow emission rates, as well as long-lived excited states and line-like emission bands. As a consequence, it is unfavorable to directly excite the Ln3+ ions.11,16 To overcome the difficulties of low light absorption of Ln3+ ions, a variety of organic ligand molecules as light collectors with large molar absorption coefficients have been introduced to sensitize Ln3+ ions for greatly intensifying their typical emission through the so-called antenna effect,13,60 which is a light conversion process in an absorption → energy transfer → emission sequence involving distinct absorption by a ligand (light collector) and emission by a Ln3+ ion (light emitter).22 The encapsulation of organic sensitizers within diverse Ln3+-exchanged zeolites has frequently been achieved by means of the in situ synthesis strategy typically called “ship-in-a-bottle” method.11,17,20,22,31 Strong sensitized luminescence of lanthanide complex/zeolite host–guest materials has been attained due to the effective energy transfer from organic ligands to Eu3+ or Tb3+ or both Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions simultaneously within the zeolite crystals. Consequently, the emission colors of the host–guest materials can be finely tuned by changing the relative amounts of the Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions in the zeolite hosts. Wada et al.20 succeeded in fine controlling red–green–blue (RGB) photoluminescence from Eu3+/Tb3+-exchanged faujasite-type zeolites by changing the amounts and ratios of Ln3+ ions and the nature of the photosensitizers (benzophenone or 4-acetylbiphenyl). Fig. 8a demonstrates how the emission from such host–guest materials can be tuned through an energy transfer process between sensitizer molecules and Ln3+ ions for giving full-color performance. The emission intensity can also be tailored by the change in excitation wavelength or the temperature. Ding et al.62 loaded 4-fluorobenzophenone (FBP) molecules into the channels of Ln3+/ZL (Ln = Eu, Tb or both Eu and Tb) through the gas diffusion method to achieve luminescent host–guest materials. Strong sensitized luminescence has been obtained due to the effective energy transfer from FBP to Eu3+ or Tb3+ or both Tb3+ and Eu3+ simultaneously within the crystal channels. As a consequence of this, the emitting colors of the host–guest materials can be tuned by changing the relative amounts of the Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions in the ZL microcrystals (Fig. 8b). They also prepared host–guest materials, Eu3+(tta)x/ZL and Eu3+(tta)x(phen)y/ZL, by gas insertion of tta as well as tta and phen within the channels of Eu3+/ZL, respectively. The lifetime of Eu3+ is shown to be longer than that of the Eu(tta)3·3H2O complex, which is attributed to the inhibition of nonradiative deactivation pathways by confinement in the nano-cavities or channels of zeolites. Furthermore, improved photostability has been observed.

Er3+-doped materials are of high importance in optoelectronics and telecommunications because the unique intra-4f transition 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 around 1.54 μm corresponds to the window of minimum attenuation in silica-based optical fibers widely used in optical communications.74 However, the weak light absorption ability of Er3+ ions leads to inefficient emission from 4f levels under direct excitation. The sensitization via the antenna effect for Er3+ is not as effective as that for Eu3+ and Tb3+ emitting in the visible region because Er3+ ions are particularly susceptible to vibrational deactivation from high-energy oscillators, such as C–H and O–H bonds typically contained in the ligand, coordinated solvents and moisture.75 It has been accepted that halogenated organic ligands can significantly increase the quantum yield of the NIR emission of the complex. Nevertheless, the presence of halogenations in organic ligands normally is detrimental to the structural stability of the complex.24 Mech and his co-workers have developed an alternative to overcome these limitations (Fig. 9).21 They inserted decafluorobenzophenone (DFB) within the channels of Er3+/ZL crystals, which produce effective luminescence around 1.54 μm with a longer lifetime of 0.21 ms via “antenna effect”, which is much longer than that obtained by using partially fluorinated benzophenes as reported by the same group.24 The importance of this approach is that it can produce effective NIR luminescence without the formation of stable complexes.

The insertion of organic ligands normally was performed under the rigorous exclusion of moisture in a sealed container. Li et al.76 recently reported a facile and effective way to improve the luminescence intensity of Eu3+/ZL crystals by simple surface modification with silylated molecules (TTA-Si) consisting of a reactive siloxane group and a light-absorbing moiety with the ability to coordinate and sensitize Eu3+ ions. The modification can easily be achieved by heating the mixture of Eu3+/ZL crystals suspended in THF solution in which TTA-Si is dissolved. The strong luminescence was attributed to the formation of complexes between Eu3+ and tta moieties, most of which are located at the entrance of the nanochannels due to the linkages derived from the nucleophilic substitution of the terminal triethoxy groups of TTA-Si by the surface hydroxyl groups on ZL crystals. They observed that the photoluminescence emission intensity, 5D0 lifetime, 5D0 radiative (kr) probabilities and the 5D0 quantum efficiency (q) of Eu3+ increase as the aspect ratio (length to diameter ratio) of the ZL crystals decreases. Furthermore, Li's group reported that new luminescent host–guest materials exhibiting tunable emission colors, upon changing the excitation wavelength, have been achieved by surface modification of terbium(III) bipyridine-loaded zeolite L crystals with the ionic europium(III) complexes.77 These obtained materials can be used as solid-state luminophores for UV-emitting LEDs because they can be excited in the near UV region.
3.4 Understanding the microenvironment in cages of zeolite crystals
The microenvironment in cages of zeolite crystals actually has a significant influence on the photophysical properties of the encapsulated lanthanide complexes, for instance, Ln3+-exchanged zeolite typically possesses Brønsted acid sites owing to cationic hydrolysis reaction,78 which results in most of the complexes being unstable and tending to decompose under such acidic conditions.13 Thus, understanding and tuning the microenvironment inside the cavities of zeolite crystals are highly important to achieve optimum luminescence properties of zeolite-based materials. To date, Li's group has made a large number of efforts to study them in detail.23,61,79 Interestingly, they observed that the luminescence performance of Eu3+(tta)x-ZL and Eu3+(tta)x(phen)y-ZL, including emission intensity, lifetime of Eu3+ and estimated 5D0 quantum efficiency of Eu3+ excited state, has increased significantly upon their treatment with ammonia gas (Fig. 10a).61 They claimed that the presence of NH3 can promote the structural transformation of β-diketonate ligands from the keto form to the enolate form, and the formation of complexes is thus favored. They also observed that the encapsulated europium(III) complexes in ZL crystals show remarkably increased photostability (Fig. 10b). Moreover, they investigated the acidity of Eu3+-exchanged zeolite L (Eu3+/ZL) and its influence on the luminescence performance of incorporated Eu3+-β-diketonate complexes, including excitation and emission spectra, lifetime of Eu3+ ions, quantum yield, and energy transfer efficiency.79 Acidity can hinder the formation of complexes between Eu3+ ions and tta molecules inside the ZL channels owing to the decomposition of Eu3+-β-diketonate complexes under acidic conditions.

Very recently, Li and co-workers23 have observed a surprising increase in the luminescence efficiency of Eu3+-β-diketonate complexes loaded in the channels of nanosized zeolite L (NZL) crystals after modification with an imidazolium-based stopper molecule (Fig. 11). They elucidated the responsible mechanism by comparing two different diketonate ligands with different pKa values and two aromatic imines (bipy and phen) and by using steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. The explanation of this luminescence enhancement is that the presence of the imidazolium-based stopper molecule is favorable to the sustainable formation of Eu3+-β-diketonate complexes with high coordination by decreasing the proton strength inside the channels of NZL. The optical characteristics of the new luminescent host–guest materials could make them very promising for developing novel optoelectronic devices.

4. Oriented ZL monolayers with functional linkers
The controlled assembly of zeolite crystals into oriented structures is highly important for them to be applied to innovative materials and devices. One of the assemblies is oriented ZL monolayers, and therefore all of their channels are standing on a different substrate such as quartz or glass. Another advantage of such monolayers is that the channels remain open on the side that is not blocked, thus leading to c-oriented open-channel monolayers (c-coMLs). Subsequent insertion of guests into the channels leads to materials with exciting properties, such as transfer of electronic excitation energy in one direction only.41,80 ZL monolayers can be achieved by covalently binding the crystals to a substrate,81–84 by using coordination bonding,85 or by microcontact transfer printing.86–88
Molecular linkers are of high importance in obtaining such an oriented ZL monolayer because they can bind and direct the arrangements and organization of zeolite crystals on substrates. Moreover, further addition of functionalities such as luminescence properties to the molecular linker can open a much wider entry for fabricating chemical devices as the linkers can transfer electronic excitation energy between the outside and inside of zeolite crystal nanochannels.90 Wang et al.44 have recently reported a strategy of achieving higher organization and luminescence in the oriented ZL monolayer by using functional linker 1 that has the ability to coordinate and sensitize lanthanide ions91,92 and to self-assemble on the substrate through hydrogen bonding (Fig. 12a). Dense, homogenous, well-oriented, stable and highly organized open channel ZL monolayers were thus obtained via this strategy by using triethoxysilylated bipyridine as the functional molecular linker (Fig. 12b). The emission color of the resulting layers can be finely tuned by changing the amount and type of Ln3+ ions coordinated to the linker, by changing the guest inside the channels of ZL, and by changing the excitation wavelength (Fig. 12c). By utilization of the same strategy, Cao et al.89 also succeeded in synthesizing dense, well-oriented and emission color-tunable monolayers of ZL with highly ordered structure by using triethoxysilylated β-diketone93,94 as the functional linker. They observed that the degree of coverage and of dense packing becomes much higher upon introduction of Eu3+ ions to the substrate surface. The coordination of the Eu3+ ion to the functional linker can favor the standing of the linker molecules on the substrate, which can account for the improved quality of the obtained ZL monolayers. Oriented ZL monolayers are usually opaque or semitransparent and they therefore strongly scatter light in the visible region. Transparency is highly desirable for some applications in developing optical devices. Calzaferri et al.43 realized the transparency by coating the polymer CR39 on the monolayer. Cao et al.89 obtained transparent monolayers of ZL by coating the polymer PVA on the monolayers (Fig. 12d).

(c) Photographs of such a monolayer upon UV excitation at 1) 270 nm, 2) 300 nm, 3) 340 nm, and 4) 365 nm.44 (d) Photographs of a ZL-(TTA-Eu)-quartz monolayer. Left: uncoated monolayer, right: similar sample coated with PVA. The background is the SEM image of the layer.89 
As discussed above, oriented monolayers of ZL can be prepared by the use of molecular linkers through covalent binding. Functional linkers that can coordinate to and sensitize Ln3+ ions can allow both the realization of oriented ZL layers with improved qualities and the tunable luminescence of the obtained monolayers. The cooperative interactions between metal ions and terpyridine as a ligand have been widely used in the preparation of supramolecular assemblies that display appealing magnetic or luminescence properties, which have also been applied to prepare one-dimensional arrays of ZL crystals.95 Li and co-workers85 prepared an oriented monolayer through the cooperative interaction of terpyridine and metal cations. They used two different strategies (i.e. S–L(M) method and S–(L–M–L) method) which lead to layers with different surface properties, as illustrated in Fig. 13a and b. The resulting layers display tunable emission colors depending on the coordinating cations (Fig. 13c). The self-assembly procedure is so versatile and robust that tailoring the properties of layers to meet the desired functionalities for a specific application is possible. The study underlines the fascinating, advanced supramolecular organization that can be achieved by using coordination chemistry as a tool for self-assembling ZL crystals. A variety of applications can be envisaged, ranging from biology, diagnostics, optical and electro-optical devices, and photoelectrochemistry to solar energy conversion.

5. Ln3+/ZL materials for constructing transparent zeolite–polymer hybrid materials and luminescence sensors
The properties of Ln3+/ZL host–guest materials outlined above make them very desirable for the development of various novel optical materials, such as lenses, infrared plastic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for use in telecommunications, luminescent nanostructured materials for optical data storage, and also for improving chemical physical properties of polymers. Typically, for many of these optical applications, the Ln3+/ZL host–guest materials have to be embedded in a polymer matrix without losing the transparency in the visible range. However, zeolite crystals usually tend to aggregate that leads to light scattering in the visible range.43 To overcome this drawback, Li et al.96 performed surface modification of nanosized lanthanide complex-loaded ZL crystals for better dispersing in the liquid monomer MMA (Fig. 14a). By polymerization, they achieved a novel transparent organic–inorganic zeolite–polymer hybrid material showing the characteristic emission of the Ln3+ ion. The luminescence color of the transparent materials can be tuned by simply changing the type of Ln3+ species located inside the channels of ZL (Fig. 14b). They found that the PMMA polymer can protect the luminescence of Ln3+ species incorporated into the channels of ZL from water quenching. The obtained transparent organic–inorganic hybrid materials could be used to prepare different plastic photonic devices.

Left: under daylight; right: under UV irradiation. 1) Material containing Tb3+ complexes, 2) material containing Eu3+ complexes.96 
Normally, the leakage of guest species from the nanochannels of zeolite crystals occurs when the host–guest materials are used in solution since the inclusion of the guest species is a thermodynamically reversible process.97 The same problem can still occur in lanthanide complex/zeolite host–guest systems, which hamper the further practical and optical applications of the materials in solution. Li and co-workers25 designed and prepared a novel luminescent core–shell material by initially coating the europium(III) complex Eu(tta)x-loaded zeolite L microcrystals with polyelectrolytes and subsequently with a silica shell. Coating a silica shell on Eu(tta)x/ZL crystals can prevent the leakage of tta molecules from the nanochannels of ZL crystals. Further functionalization of the silica-coated Eu(tta)x/ZL crystals with non-luminescent terbium(III) complexes makes them effective luminescent sensors for the detection of dipicolinic acid (DPA), i.e. an important molecular marker in spore-producing bacteria. The procedure is outlined in Fig. 15. In this case, the europium(III) complex inside the channel of ZL crystals encapsulated in silica, as an internal calibration, is protected from external influences such as solvents, providing stable reference signals. Furthermore, they also reported the new luminescent core–shell composite composed of a dye (coumarin 1)-loaded zeolite L nano-crystal and a silica shell with non-luminescent europium complexes immobilized on the surface.98 The obtained core–shell composites were used as an ideal sensor for the ratiometric detection of DPA molecules at nanomolar concentrations.

As aforementioned, the luminescence of Eu3+-β-diketonate complexes loaded in the channels of NZL shows a strong positive response upon exposure to ammonia gas,23,61,79 which implies that these luminescent materials can be used as a potential sensor for detecting various alkaline molecules.
6. Conclusions and outlook
In summary, we have briefly reviewed the main research that is ongoing in the field of the functionalization of zeolite crystals with lanthanide, including preparation strategies and improved luminescence performance. We also highlighted the versatility and importance of ZL crystals as host materials for the preparation of luminescent host–guest materials with characteristic emission of lanthanide ions. The most interesting results obtained so far for Ln3+-functionalized zeolite crystals are as follows: 1) annealing of Ln3+-exchanged zeolites or Ln3+/co-doped ions zeolites can lead to luminescence enhancement; 2) strong NIR emission via white light excitation can be obtained in the annealed Er3+/ZL; 3) incorporating lanthanide complexes inside the channels of zeolite crystals can improve their thermal stability and photostability which is highly important for practical applications such as LED lighting; 4) multicolor emitting lanthanide complex-loaded zeolite host–guest materials can be achieved; 5) effective NIR luminescence without the formation of stable complexes in ZL crystals can be observed; 6) the luminescence efficiency of Eu3+-β-diketonate complexes loaded in the channels of NZL crystals after modification with an imidazolium-based stopper molecule can be extremely increased; 7) highly ordered ZL monolayers with tunable luminescence properties can be obtained by using functional linkers that can coordinate to and sensitize Ln3+ luminescence; 8) transparent luminescent composites are available by embedding nanosized Ln3+-functionalized ZL into the PMMA matrices; and 9) luminescent core–shell materials can be used as an ideal sensor for the ratiometric detection of DPA molecules.
However, the study of this research topic is still in its infancy; efforts have been mainly focused on the preparation, morphology and luminescence properties. At least three key points should be taken into account in this research area in the near future: i) the composition and structure of the formed Ln3+ complexes inside the channels of zeolite crystals should be further clarified, which is highly important for us to understand the interaction between the host (zeolite crystals) and the guest (lanthanide complexes); ii) the oriented monolayers open a way for applications in biology, diagnostics and in optoelectronic applications, including artificial antenna systems, thin layer solar cells and light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs). However, the preparation of perfect monolayers on large substrates which are dense, homogeneous, and well oriented remains a challenging task, which is a prerequisite for many technological applications; and iii) the applications of these novel host–guest should be further strengthened in various fields such as LED lighting (some of the materials can be excited by 395 nm and 465 nm together with their regular and tunable morphology) and sensing, and in application as luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) for the production of cheaper solar electricity.
