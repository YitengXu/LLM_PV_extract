    , Accepted 25th October 2013First published on 28th October 2013AbstractFor the first time, a novel solar device has been fabricated by integrating fiber dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSCs) with luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) via a groove. Optical efficiencies from 8.27% to 22.05% have been achieved by the efficient solar devices. A Pmax up to 10 mW has been reached by fabricating a red solar module (70.56 cm2) with four FDSCs (5.50 cm). The high power output reduced the solar energy cost and showed the good potential application of the proposed device. The effects of electrolyte concentration, illumination area and light intensity were investigated in detail, which could be important in future module design.
Introduction
With the drastically increasing need for environmentally friendly energy, photoelectric conversion of clean and plentiful solar energy has received considerable interest worldwide. Despite the abundance of solar energy, the energy density on Earth is low because energy is widely distributed in the universe. Large photovoltaic panels are necessary to collect sufficient solar energy for practical applications, resulting in consumption of photoactive materials and the requirement for large areas of well-lit land. The concept of concentrated solar power1 using light-collecting devices such as solar concentrators,2,3 reflectors,4 scatter plates,5 and optical prisms,6 has been enthusiastically embraced. Novel solar devices are still badly needed to meet the demands of modern society, where the requirements include a high power output, economical cost and a favorable appearance.
Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), light-collecting and down-shifting devices, have elicited special attention since the 1970s.7–9 LSCs are utilized to concentrate direct and diffuse light radiation over a large area, down-shift it by luminescence, and guide it to the relatively small edges of the plate.10 LSCs are generally thin, light, and semi-transparent plates with various colors. They can be cut and spliced into decorative units or building components, such as windows and greenhouse panels. A novel type of solar technology can be produced by integrating LSCs with solar cells. Research groups around the world have utilized LSCs in various solar cells, including crystalline/amorphous silicon, gallium arsenide, and organic solar cells,11–17 to collect large amounts of sunlight and enhance photovoltaic (PV) performance. For example, Slooff et al. reported an LSC (5 × 5 × 0.5 cm3) solar device with mc-Si, GaAs and InGaP solar cells and electrical efficiencies of 2.9–7.1% were achieved.12 Desmet et al. reported a mono-crystalline silicon photovoltaic luminescent solar concentrator (10 × 10 × 0.5 cm3) with a 1.6–4.2% power conversion efficiency.13 Very recently, Chou et al. prepared flexible waveguiding photovoltaics (3 × 3 × 0.6 cm3) with several poly-Si solar cells and optical efficiencies of 12–48% and power conversion efficiencies of 1.67–6.40%.14 These practical examples demonstrate the promising applications of PV-LSC devices. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are potential candidates for integration with LSCs due to their low-cost manufacture, adjustable light absorption range and considerable temperature tolerance under light concentrating conditions. However, few studies have combined DSCs with LSCs, probably because it is difficult to prepare long, narrow, planar and efficient DSCs under normal conditions and to firmly attach the cells to the edge of the plate. In addition, having only one light-collecting face could mean that full utilization of the concentrated light from all directions does not occur. We expect a breakthrough by creating a new solar cell shape and a new method for DSC to LSC “attachment”.
Fiber dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSCs)18–20 are a novel type of low-dimensional DSCs fabricated on conducting “wires”. FDSCs and traditional DSCs have similar advantages,21,22 such as easy fabrication, low cost, and high efficiency. They also exhibit special characteristics, such as being transparent conductive oxide (TCO)-free and having 3D light-collecting abilities.23–26 FDSCs are particularly suitable for the study of LSC-integrated devices, designated “FDSC–LSC” solar devices, for several reasons. Firstly, as FDSCs are naturally small in size with a 1D extension that can be well fitted to the edge of LSCs, they require no special cutting process. Secondly, as FDSCs collect light through the electrolyte, the long specific wavelength transferred by LSCs can prevent electrolyte absorption and can match the sensitizer's effective trapping spectrum. Thirdly, the 3D light-capturing properties of FDSCs serve a purpose through the formation of a suitable “package” with LSCs. Thus, high energy output can be achieved.
Hence, for the first time, a novel FDSC–LSC solar device was fabricated by integrating FDSCs with LSCs via a groove. In this solar device, the semi-transparent LSC collects light over a large area and then converts it into an appropriate wavelength for effective solar power-to-electricity conversion. The groove combining the FDSC and LSC further condenses the luminescent light onto the solar cell. Optical efficiencies from 8.27% to 22.05% with electrical efficiencies of 0.0354–0.143% have been achieved. The well-designed FDSC–LSC solar module (70.56 cm2) achieved a high power output of up to 10 mW, indicating its potential application to novel building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) power generation.27,28 The effects of electrolyte concentration, illumination area and light intensity are considered in this study, thereby making the creation of novel solar art possible.
Experimental
1. Materials
All FDSC devices were assembled according to our previous reports.29 Unless specified otherwise, the FDSCs were 5.50 cm in length. The electrolytes were iodine solutions (0.03–0.15 M) in acetonitrile with 0.6 M 1,3-diethylimidazolium iodide, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, 0.1 M lithium perchlorate and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate. The LSCs (10.3 × 10.3 × 0.3 cm3; 3t) were purchased from Tokyu Hands (Japan). Fig. 1a presents an optical image of commercial LSCs in four different colors. The LSCs are semi-transparent and exhibit bright colors of purple, green, orange and red. The absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of the LSCs are shown in the ESI.† Extensive absorption ranges covering different wavelengths were observed with the purple, green, orange and red LSCs, indicating different light harvesting abilities (Fig. S1†). Sharp emission spectra were detected with maximum wavelengths at 429, 518, 572 and 617 nm, respectively (Fig. S2†). This diversity provides great potential for solar designs.

2. Measurements and characterizations
The LSCs were cut into small pieces (1.3 × 2.6 × 0.3 cm3) for spectroscopic study. Absorption spectra were obtained with a JASCO V-550 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Japan). Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a JASCO PF-6200 Spectrofluorometer (Japan) at 365 nm excitation. The current–voltage and power–voltage curves of the FDSCs were recorded on a Keithley Model 2000 multimeter under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5) illumination simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2; calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell) using a solar simulator (Yamashita DESO, Japan). Maximum power output is expressed as Pmax = Isc × Voc × FF, where Isc is the short-circuit current, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, and FF is the fill factor. Two kinds of efficiencies are measured to evaluate the photovoltaic performance. The apparent photo-to-electricity conversion efficiency (ηo), or optical efficiency, is calculated as ηo = Pmax/(AFDSCPin), while the electrical efficiency (ηe) is calculated as ηe = Pmax/(ALSCPin), where AFDSC is the diameter of the photoanode (d) multiplied by its length (l), ALSC is the illumination area of the LSC and Pin is the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2). Correspondingly, optical current density Jo is calculated by Isc/AFDSC and electrical current density Je is expressed by Isc/ALSC. The Pmax enhancement factor (N) is defined as the Pmax ratio of the FDSCs with and without LSCs under the same illumination.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the typical procedure for preparation of the FDSC–LSC solar device. Pieces of aluminum foil were cut into strips and folded into symmetrical grooves. The grooves were fixed at the each side of the LSC with a little double-sided adhesive tape. The FDSC was inserted in the slot between the last groove and the LSC and fastened to form the FDSC–LSC solar device. The use of this simple fabrication has several advantages. Firstly, the relatively closed optical path allows continuous light reflection, thereby ensuring efficient light utilization. Secondly, the FDSC becomes “hidden” after installation, thereby protecting the solar cell and meeting the aesthetic requirements for art design. Thirdly, aluminum foil, with its good thermal conductivity, is conducive to cooling under light concentrating conditions. The well-packaged semi-transparent FDSC–LSC solar device can be embedded into the building frame structure (Fig. S3†), indicating the potential use of this device in BIPV or even some kinds of solar artwork.
To check the validity of the newly developed solar device, its PV performance based on a green LSC was tested, along with control devices. The PV parameters of a typical FDSC–LSC (Green) solar device and the control devices are provided in Table 1 and the current/power–voltage curves are shown in Fig. 2. For the single FDSC (length: 10.30 cm; diameter: 300 μm), a considerable optical efficiency of 5.50% was achieved with a short-circuit current (Isc) of 2.99 mA (corresponding to a Jo of 9.68 mA cm−2), an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.745 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.763 and a maximum power output (Pmax) of 1.70 mW, which is an improvement on our previous results with respect to length and efficiency.5 When a FDSC–LSC (Green) solar device with one side covered with an aluminum groove (as shown in Fig. 2b) was tested, Isc, Voc, FF and Pmax came to 4.59 mA (corresponding to a Jo of 14.85 mA cm−2 or a Je of 0.0635 mA cm−2), 0.751 V, 0.741 and 2.56 mW, respectively. Though the FF dropped slightly, the ηo increased to 8.27% (corresponding to an ηe of 0.0354%). The Pmax enhancement factor of 50.6% (N = 1.51) indicates that the relatively simple solar device can help achieve effective photon capture for higher power output. By covering all of the LSC sides with grooves, a remarkably high Isc of 7.68 mA (corresponding to a Jo of 24.85 mA cm−2 or a Je of 0.1063 mA cm−2), a Voc of 0.763 V and a Pmax of 3.99 mW (N = 2.35) were achieved. The Jo and Voc improved by 71.4% and 1.60%, respectively, which reflects the special role of the grooves because they allow the waveguide on each side to be concentrated to the FDSC through reflection and scattering, thereby allowing more efficient photon collection. Though the FF decreased to 0.681, the ηo was enhanced by 56.1% from that of the device with just one side covered, to 12.91% (corresponding to an ηe of 0.0552%). Furthermore, the FDSC–LSC (Red) solar device achieved a Pmax of 6.82 mW (N = 4.01) and an ηo of 22.05% (corresponding to an ηe of 0.0943%) with the same FDSC, indicating its superior PV performance to the green solar device. It was worth noting that, by collecting light from a large area, converting it to a longer wavelength and concentrating it to the FDSC, the Pmax and ηo (and/or the ηe) are greatly improved with the well-designed solar device. Compared with other literature reports,14 our optical efficiencies (ηo) are similar to those of Si solar cell-based devices, indicating that the FDSCs might play a promising role in the photovoltaic field. However, the electrical efficiencies (ηe) remain relatively low, probably due to the fact that the conversion capability of a single FDSC does not match the lighting capability of the LSC. Thus, further improvement can be expected by optimization of the device. For DSC-based LSC devices, Li et al. achieved a Pmax enhancement of 27.6% (from 0.87 mW to 1.11 mW) with a fluorescent layer.30 The novel FDSC–LSC solar device presented here exhibits an impressive Pmax enhancement of 300%.

 Fig. 2  (a) Current–voltage and power–voltage curves of the single FDSC and the FDSC–LSC (Green) solar devices with one side covered (b) and four sides covered (c) with grooves. The illumination area of each LSC is 72.24 cm2 and the FDSC is 10.30 cm in length and the diameter is 300 μm. 
Considering the optical functions of LSCs and the aluminum groove, the light-harvesting diagrams of different package methods were qualitatively compared to demonstrate the effectiveness of the above method (Fig. 3). Typically, the LSC waveguide spreads to each edge evenly (Fig. 3a). As one side is equipped with an FDSC within the aluminum groove, the waveguide to the solar cell is collected as well as its reflected light (Fig. 3b). The aluminum groove therefore acts as a reflector, in addition to attaching the FDSC to the LSC concentrator. More packaged sides provide more light reflection loci, thereby guiding more stray light to the solar cell (Fig. 3c). Thus, the LSC and the aluminum package play synergistic roles to form one well-designed concentrator system for efficient solar energy collection. This finding is also beneficial for other LSC solar devices. Furthermore, the efficient FDSC converts the solar power to electricity. In other words, the light collecting function and the solar power-to-electricity generation function are separate in this solar device, which distinguishes it from standard solar designs and results in a “hidden” solar cell. This design is therefore a highly unique concept and represents a considerable advance in this research area.
 Fig. 3  Sectional view of the light-harvesting diagram for the bare LSC (a), the FDSC–LSC solar device with one side covered (b) and with four sides covered (c) with the groove. The violet circle represents the sectional view of a typical FDSC. The blue and red arrows present the incident light and the emitting light of the LSC, respectively. The brown wave represents heat. 
FDSCs follow the same general principle as DSCs. However, the former collects light through the electrolyte. The effect of the FDSC electrolyte must be considered to optimize the performance of an FDSC–LSC solar device. I2 concentration should not be too high to allow the LSC emission wavelength to prevent electrolyte absorption. A reasonable I2 concentration is required to maintain good charge transfer in the electrolyte for a high photocurrent. Fig. S4† shows the absorption spectrum of an electrolyte film (about 60 μm in thickness), with an I2 concentration varying from 0.03 M to 0.15 M. The onset of the spectrum red-shifted to a longer wavelength as the I2 concentration increased to 0.12M and almost remained at 0.15M. Fig. 4 compares the normalized fluorescence emission spectra of the LSCs and the normalized absorption spectra of the electrolyte thin film with different I2 concentrations. It appears that the emission wavelength of the purple LSC would be exposed to serious electrolyte absorption, followed by the green and then orange LSCs, while the emission wavelength of the red LSC avoids this electrolyte “shielding”. This phenomenon could affect the PV performance of the FDSC–LSC solar device.

Fig. 5 shows the Pmax and N of typical FDSC–LSC solar devices with different I2 concentrations. The changing trend of Isc (Fig. S5a†) is consistent with that of the Pmax (Fig. 5a) within the experimental range. Pmax and Isc values are ordered as follows: red > orange > green > AM 1.5 > purple, under the same I2 concentration. This order reflects the different utilization ability of the FDSC–LSC solar devices, although it is not easy to quantitatively describe the contributions of light-collection and down-shifting in these four LSCs as well as the electrolyte shielding. The trend differs for the different LSCs. The Isc, Voc and Pmax continue to decline in the purple LSC, with the highest values (0.595 mA, 0.677 V, and 0.293 mW, respectively) observed at the initial I2 concentration of 0.03 M. Given that the emission wavelength of the LSC was almost shielded by the electrolyte absorption range, a high I2 concentration would certainly reduce the amount of incident light to the FDSC. For the green and orange LSCs, the highest Isc and Pmax values (4.46 mA and 1.93 mW for green, and 6.64 mA and 2.76 mW for orange) appeared at I2 concentrations of 0.06 and 0.09 M, respectively. A higher I2 concentration allows a higher photocurrent and helps increase the Isc and Pmax, while a longer emission wavelength would better escape electrolyte shielding. For the red LSC the Isc and Pmax increased as the I2 concentration increased, with excellent values (7.28 mA and 3.03 mW, respectively) being reached at 0.09 M, which remained almost constant. As the emitted light of the red LSC can prevent electrolyte absorption, and the increase in iodine concentration can help maintain a good charge transfer for a high Isc, the red LSC is highly suitable for N719-based FDSCs. As a supplement, the Voc remained almost unchanged in each LSC, with the exception of a continued decline in the purple LSC as the I2 concentration increased (Fig. S5b†). The FF (Fig. S5c†) showed a slight trend towards growth with the increasing I2 concentration, further confirming the improved charge transfer. The Pmax enhancement factors (N) of the FDSC–LSC solar devices are shown in Fig. 5b. A continuous increase in N was observed for the orange and red LSCs, indicating a potential for applications in systems with a high I2 concentration. It is worth noting that the best result (7.09 mA, 3.09 mW) in the series was achieved from the FDSC–LSC (Red) solar device at a 0.15 M I2 concentration. The corresponding maximum N of 4.90 means an enhancement of 390% from the single FDSC under AM 1.5 illumination (1.28 mA, 0.630 mW).

max (a) and N (b) of the FDSC–LSC solar devices with different I2 concentrations. The illumination area of each LSC was 70.56 cm2. Each FDSC was 5.50 cm in length. 
The persistent Isc response was tested at different I2 concentrations to further verify the effect of I2 concentration on charge transfer. Fig. S6† shows the persistent Isc response of the FDSC–LSC solar devices over 120 s. As the I2 concentration increased from 0.03 M and 0.09 M to 0.15 M, the Isc peak at the first 10 s became less distinct. These observations indicate that a high I2 concentration helps maintain high current and that the charge transfer limitation gradually becomes the secondary factor as I2 concentration increases.
To further evaluate the performance of the FDSC–LSC solar devices, a series of tests were carried out using various illumination areas (from 10.68 to 78.32 cm2). The current–voltage and power–voltage curves of the FDSC–LSC (Green) and FDSC–LSC (Red) solar devices with different illumination areas are provided in Fig. S7.† As can be seen, higher Isc and Pmax values were obtained as the illumination area increased. To quantitatively evaluate the relationship between the performance parameters (Isc, Pmax, Voc and FF) and the illumination area, we conducted a mathematical analysis. Fig. 6 shows the trend of the performance parameters (Isc, Pmax, Voc and FF) as the illumination area increases. The red solar device showed a linear increase in the Isc and Pmax with increased illumination area. This result might be due to the fact that illumination intensity is enhanced with increased illumination area. For the same reason, there was a linear correlation between the Voc and a logarithmic increase in the illumination area. This observation is consistent with those reported in typical DSCs.31 There was a linear decrease in the FF as the illumination area increased, which is similar to that seen in a previous DSC report.32 This phenomenon could originate from the development of a large photo-shunt due to the increased charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface as the illumination area (light intensity) increases. However, this linear downward trend is more pronounced than that reported in the literature, probably because the higher I2 concentration and light intensity in our experiment leads to more extreme recombination. Although similar trends were observed for the green solar device, the contrasting gradients may reflect the different light-collecting abilities of the devices, derived from the LSC fluorescent material. The electrical efficiencies (ηe) of these solar devices with different illumination areas are provided in Fig. S8.† The ηe of the green devices remains almost constant as the area increases, while the ηe of the red devices drops linearly, indicating that the efficiency depends somewhat on the illumination area. This might be due to the limited conversion capability of a single FDSC, as mentioned above.
 Fig. 6  Performance parameters (Isc, Pmax, Voc and FF) of the FDSC–LSC solar devices as a function of different illumination areas. Red (red square) and green (green circle) LSCs were used in the experiment. The black line is the linear fitting of the experimental points. The blue line represents the parameters of the single FDSC under AM 1.5 illumination. The maximum illumination area of each LSC is 78.32 cm2. Each FDSC is 5.50 cm in length. The I2 concentration is 0.12 M. 
Energy modules can be designed according to the linear trend of the main performance parameters with regard to the illumination area. For the practical application of LSCs, the output of the FDSCs with LSCs should be higher than that of FDSCs without LSCs. Although the spectrum of light from the LSC is very different from the AM 1.5 illumination, the light source for the LSC devices and the single FDSC is the same. The critical concentrating area (CCA) is defined in this study as the light-collecting area of a specific LSC wherein the Pmax of the FDSC is equal to that of a FDSC without a LSC. The intersections of the blue and black lines in Fig. 6b indicate that the CCAs of the red and green LSCs are about 11 and 34 cm2, respectively. The CCA order of the LSCs in this study should be red < orange < green < purple according to the results in Fig. 5a. The CCA would always be greater than 0, mainly because the collected spectrum of the LSCs is always narrower than the AM 1.5 illumination, and light loss is almost inevitable at the top surface (light scatters during transmission).16 Moreover, the quantum efficiency of active materials in LSCs is usually less than 100%, and light is converted into heat during down-shifting and transfer. The CCA would be an important parameter in FDSC–LSC solar device design. Accordingly, the critical area can also be defined by the Isc or Voc if necessary.
For practical photovoltaic applications, light intensity is another important consideration. We explored the performance of the FDSC–LSC solar devices under different light intensities. Table 2 provides a summary of the Pmax values achieved at three different light intensities. As light intensity increased from weak to strong, Pmax also increased (1.15, 1.56, and 1.96 mW for the green LSC device; 2.10, 2.56, and 2.73 mW for the red LSC device). However, N exhibited the opposite trend (2.37, 2.22, and 2.08 for the green LSC; 4.32, 3.64, and 2.89 for the red LSC). These results reveal that high light intensity results in low power enhancement, a finding that is similar to the reported findings on traditional DSCs.33 An additional experiment was conducted under weaker light in a room (Fig. S9†), to give a reasonably high N value of 5.78. Thus, the solar device could have a special function under low light intensity conditions.

To make full use of the four light-concentrating sides, more FDSCs were introduced to the FDSC–LSC solar device. In addition, they were fabricated in series and in parallel for the FDSC–LSC solar module. Fig. 7 shows the current–voltage and power–voltage curves of the FDSC–LSC (Red) solar device (illumination area: 70.56 cm2) with four FDSCs (length: 5.50 cm; diameter: 280 μm) in series and in parallel. Table 3 provides a summary of the PV parameters in the two cases. Four FDSCs in series achieved a high Voc of 3.07 V with an ηo of 16.4% (corresponding to an ηe of 0.143%), while the parallel case achieved a high Isc of 24.97 mA with an ηo of 15.1% (corresponding to an ηe of 0.132%). The Pmax reached 10.09 mW (2.29 V, 4.41 mA) when the FDSCs were arranged in series and 9.31 mW (0.470 V, 19.82 mA) when they were arranged in parallel, values which can meet the requirements of several minor electronic devices. The parallel device can easily drive a motor and a video demonstrating this is provided in the ESI (Video†). The sustained short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage in 120 seconds (Fig. S10†) indicate the stable PV response of these two solar modules. Thus, the proposed FDSC–LSC solar module is suitable for BIPV and daily power generation. Additional experiments were conducted with two to four FDSCs for parallel fabrication with a red LSC (Fig. S11†). A reasonable Pmax of 4.5 mW to 9.3 mW was achieved (Table S1†). This result indicates that the FDSC–LSC solar device is a suitable module for FDSC and LSC applications, and can increase efficiency with respect to the ratio of the cost to the amount of solar energy produced. Considering the size of the LSC and the FDSC in the above experiments, an even higher power output can be expected with a larger-scale pilot study.

Compared to other light-collecting approaches, LSCs offer alternative color selection, flexible geometric scales, highly efficient output, and potential solar art. Aside from FDSCs, other fiber-shaped PV cells can also be applied to the device. Non-planar FDSC–LSC solar devices are currently being designed. Well-designed cylindrical solar concentrators34,35 might fit the shape of FDSCs even better and could provide exciting results. With respect to economic considerations, the use of cost-effective FDSCs based on metal substrates can completely avoid the requirement for transparent conductive glass, which offers a long-term solution for flexible solar cells at low cost, and they can be mass produced via “cup-to-cup” approaches.36 The “cup-to-cup” approaches are according to ref. 36. Moreover, the LSCs and the aluminium foil used here are cheap and can be directly purchased. Furthermore, our solar devices could be easily installed by directly attaching fiber solar cells and aluminium foil around the edges of the LSCs. Since the FDSC–LSC solar devices are relatively novel, further study is required to systematically evaluate their costs.37 Further research on LSCs and solar art is currently being conducted in our laboratory.
Conclusions
A novel FDSC–LSC solar device has been developed by integrating FDSCs with LSCs via an aluminum groove. The FDSC–LSC solar device has the advantages of the waveguiding properties of the LSCs, the stray light collecting ability of the aluminum groove and the 3D light-collecting ability of the wire-format solar cell. These allow the “hidden” solar cell to maximize the utilization of incoming photons to yield a high power output. Optical efficiencies from 8.27% to 22.05%, and electrical efficiencies of 0.0354–0.143%, have been achieved. The effects of electrolyte concentration, illumination area and light intensity were investigated in detail. The PV parameters of the FDSC–LSC solar device had a linear relationship with illumination area and the solar device showed special functionality under low light intensity conditions, both of which could be important in future module design. Furthermore, a Pmax of up to 10 mW has been reached by fabricating a red solar module (70.56 cm2) with four FDSCs (5.50 cm). The high power output reduced solar energy costs and reveals the good potential application of the proposed device.
