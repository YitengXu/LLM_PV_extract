One way to improve financial performance of such systems is to maximise value through a biorefinery approach (e.g. co-production streams, waste minimisation). This can be implemented via extraction of valuable intracellular compounds upon cell disruption; however both low-cost, energy efficient, and scalable cell disruption techniques, and green chemicals are required. Waste heat is a readily available resource in most production plants, and can be used to power a hydrothermal pre-treatment (HTP) step to disrupt the cells. In this study, we use HTP (120–180 °C, 5–30 min) to disrupt Chlorella sp. cell walls. We perform a subsequent water-miscible solvent and/or urea extraction (UX) to solubilise and recover proteins. The maximum extraction efficiency of 62% was achieved after HTP at 180 °C for 10 min. Regardless of the reaction time, 120 °C was found to be ineffective for protein extraction. The efficiency can be further increased to 84% if a filter-washing step with acetone and urea is implemented. Most of the recovered proteins are between 8 to 14 kDa across all temperature ranges, suggesting that extraction efficiency depended both on partial protein hydrolysis and on accessibility to solvent (i.e. cell wall degradation, solid dispersion, membrane solubilisation). The most significant amino acid losses on a per mole basis were lysine (22%) and arginine (14%). The production of flexible and high-value protein-based products via HTP-UX may enable a circular and sustainable production step for microalgal biorefineries, while improving the downstream fuel processes through nitrogen heteroatom reduction.
1. Introduction
Earth's surface receives about 5000 times more energy from the sun annually (3020 ZJ per year) than is required to supply the entire global primary energy demand (0.57 ZJ per year) that drives our combined economies.1,2 Photosynthetic organisms have evolved to tap into this huge energy resource and currently convert more than 4.5 ZJ of this energy into biomass each year.3 Through this conversion, both marine and terrestrial primary producers fix ∼105 gigatonnes of carbon per year which is around twice the CO2 emissions due to human activity.4,5 This stored energy and carbon can be harnessed to power a circular bioeconomy. In this context, next-generation photosynthetic microalgae-based production can play a significant role, through biomass growth on non-arable land with saline and/or wastewater, and through effective recycling of nutrients (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous) in contained systems, ultimately reducing freshwater and arable land use, reliance on energy-intensive chemical fertilisers and eutrophication.6
While microalgae biomass is a promising green feedstock, microalgae-based production for biofuels is not yet economically feasible, especially when fuel is the sole product, and cannot yet compete economically with conventional biofuel sources (e.g. maize, sugar cane). However, the integration of microalgae biofuel production systems with multiple streams of valuable co-products (e.g. pigments,7 omega-3 oils,8 bioplastics,9 protein-rich animal feeds6) would help offset the associated relatively high capital and operational costs.
One barrier to economically competitive microalgae production systems is that they require energy intensive cell disruption processes for the recovery of their intracellular constituents due to their robust cell wall structure.10 Cell wall disruption can be achieved by a variety of methods including mechanical, thermal, chemical, enzymatic, microwave, and ultrasound treatments.10 Each has its own strengths and weaknesses11 and can be useful for the extraction of different types of intracellular compounds from different species12 since morphologies and cell wall characteristics differ.13 While these cell disruption and product recovery applications are not difficult to perform at laboratory scale, when up-scaled in an industrial setting, the intensive energy requirements and high running costs of most techniques reduce the performance of microalgae production plants.
One inexpensive and readily available resource, especially in biofuel production plants, is waste heat, which could be used to power cell wall disruption in next-generation microalgae biorefineries. If the temperature used in this step is high enough to disrupt the cell wall, but low enough to not completely hydrolyse and modify major cellular constituents, the opportunity exists to selectively extract these constituents. Cellular protein is one such constituent that is not only valuable in its own right, but which causes problems for subsequent biomass treatment by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a promising wet-treatment method to convert biomass to fuels. Nitrogenous organic compounds in the HTL feedstock result in the formation of nitrogen heterocyclics in the HTL product, which poison the catalysts used during fuel upgrading and may create NOx species during combustion.14 As protein is the major source of nitrogen in the cell (59.3 to 96.8% of the total N)15 reducing its input into the HTL process will result in better quality crude biofuel with lower downstream processing costs.
Hydrothermal pre-treatment (HTP) has been examined as a technique to reduce the nitrogen content of subsequent fuel production,16–19 but has not been focussed on efficient recovery of the protein which is eliminated from the HTP feedstock, thereby neglecting a potential source of value from the production system. HTP allows the release of water soluble proteins and peptides via cell wall disruption and partial protein hydrolysis, without extensive subsequent lipid hydrolysis.16,19 Depending on the performance of protein recovery (i.e. recovery rate, protein quality, decomposition) the production of animal feeds (e.g. aquaculture feeds, supplements), bioplastics (e.g. polyurethane,20 plasticisers21), and alcohols (e.g. fusel alcohols22), among other bioproducts, may also be possible.
The temperature needed to disrupt the microalgal cell wall and solubilise the proteins is, to some extent, strain dependent (cell size, cell wall structure, overall morphology). In the case of spirulina, Huang et al.17 suggested that 150 °C is not high enough to break the cell walls of pre-dried biomass, while Kastner et al.23 showed that at 125 °C, about 20% N removal was possible. For eukaryotic algae, Eboibi et al.16 found that for a Tetraselmis sp. protein extraction occurred as low as 130 °C. Miao et al.24 found temperatures below 120 °C (at 20 min) were not sufficient to release ethanol insoluble polysaccharides from Chlorella sorokiniana, indicating the cell wall was not disrupted effectively. Yu et al.25 reported for Chlorella pyrenoidosa that at temperatures above 200 °C, H/C and O/C ratios of the resulting bio-oil decreased substantially attributed to decarboxylation and deamination subsequent to protein hydrolysis. These reports clearly indicate a trade-off between the temperature necessary to break the cell wall, and to hydrolyse the proteins into peptides on the one hand, and further degradation of the proteins and formation of nitrogen heterocyclics on the other.
In summary, temperatures over 120 °C are required to break the cell walls and release soluble peptides, but to avoid complete nitrogen partitioning, the upper temperature range of the HTP step should not exceed ∼180 to 200 °C. Costanzo et al.19 used a two-stage hydrothermal liquefaction process to reduce nitrogen heteroatoms in microalgal biocrude oil and found that at 175 °C (<5 min) the highest release of microalgal whole proteins into the aqueous phase was achieved. It is likely that there is an optimum HTP temperature (100–200 °C) at a short holding time (<30 min), which would maximize value for this type of a protein recovery process. Since HTP is performed at a much lower temperature (<200 °C) than HTL (250–375 °C for protein containing feedstocks26), energy requirements for the pre-treatment can be minimized by efficiently coupling HTP to the waste heat from HTL to further optimise the running costs and energy intensity. During HTP cooling, the heat would be returned to cold biomass. This approach would also eliminate any need to store and transport the energy required for the pre-treatment, as HTL and HTP can run successively while using the same or similar apparatus.
The apparent requirement for the partial hydrolysis of cellular protein to create soluble peptides suggests that many insoluble peptides must remain in the solid phase. For example, neither internal peptides from abundant globular proteins such as Rubisco, nor the membrane spanning portions of the photosynthetic apparatus are expected to be solubilised by partial hydrolysis. This affords the opportunity to obtain further extraction of the protein component by using inexpensive reagents that solubilise proteins. While many protein solubilising reagents are available, urea is a particularly inexpensive and non-toxic molecule that is a key global agricultural fertiliser. Urea is well known for its ability to completely solubilise proteins and peptides, at least those that are not covalently linked into larger complexes.27 It is also highly water soluble, making feasible its simple removal from the solid residue and subsequent recovery. Its low molecular weight also facilitates its removal from the extracted protein, for example by ultrafiltration. It is safe and simple to handle, does not require subsequent pH neutralisation nor will it harm other delicate biomolecules in a biorefinery context. At present, urea is industrially produced from carbon dioxide (CO2) and ammonia (NH3),28 which in turn is synthesised through the energy and carbon intensive fossil fuel-powered Haber–Bosch process.29 However, intense global pressure for greener urea production (e.g. via biomass gasification and PV electrolysis) is projected to drive the replacement of Haber–Bosch produced urea with renewable urea in the next 15–20 years.28,29
Here we examine the effects of combining HTP with subsequent urea extraction (UX). As hydrophobic peptides may be partially trapped in lipid membranes, and therefore inaccessible to the urea solution, we also examined the effect of pretreatment with a low toxicity water-miscible solvent, such as acetone extraction (AX), prior to attempted solubilisation with a non-toxic urea solution. The objective of this work was to conduct HTP experiments in the range of 120–180 °C for 5 to 30 minutes to determine the optimum temperature and holding time required for maximum protein extraction, followed by urea solubilisation to improve the extractability of protein from the solid residue following HTP. The use of water-miscible solvents maximises physical compatibility with the subsequent urea extraction step, and all three solvents examined here can be made sustainably.30,31
The outcome of this work may facilitate sustainable circular design of large-scale biorefineries and improve the triple bottom line performance of next-generation microalgae production plants through establishment of protein-based co-production streams from waste heat and green chemical powered processes.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Algal biomass
Algae cultivation was performed at the Centre for Solar Biotechnology plant located at Pinjarra Hills, Queensland.32 A high-productivity local Chlorella sp. strain (11_H5) related to Chlorella sorokiniana was grown in open raceway ponds, using the media recipe reported by Wolf.33 Once the algal culture reached an optical density of ≥0.6 at 680 nm and ≥0.8 at 750 nm the culture was harvested using a continuous flow centrifuge (GEA Westfalia disc stack centrifuge Cat no. SSD6-06, 5000 rpm, 20 °C, 10 min) and further concentrated with a benchtop centrifuge (Eppendorf, ∼12000 rpm, 20 °C, 1–2 bar, flow rate of 500–2000 L per hour) to increase the overall solids content to 15 wt%. After this, the mixed algae paste was frozen (−20 °C) in ice cube trays, with each cube being ∼64 cm3.
2.2. Hydrothermal pre-treatment
The HTP experiments were carried out in a stainless steel vessel, which was assembled using the fittings and tubings shown in Fig. 1, and a commercial electric deep fryer (Yescom Stainless Steel Electric Countertop Fat Deep Fryer 6 L) filled with a high-smoke point oil (rice bran oil, 250 °C). The vessel was designed to operate up to 180 °C and 1000 kPa, and was equipped with pressure and temperature sensors (at the top section of the stainless steel tee).
 Fig. 1  HTP reaction vessel. Vessel body (1), clamps (2), needle valves (3), pressure gauge (4), pressure relief valve (5), thermocouple probe (6), handle (7). 
One frozen algae block (64 cm3), obtained from the above algal cultivation was thawed and loaded into the HTP vessel (400 cm3 internal volume) for each HTP experiment. After biomass addition, the vessel was purged with nitrogen to displace air from the headspace. The vessel was then sealed and submerged in a pre-heated oil bath. While stirring is not incorporated into the process, the reactor has a large surface area to volume ratio which allows rapid heat transfer into the liquid. When the desired pressure (calculated from the corresponding saturated water temperature of 120–180 °C) was reached, it was held at that level for a pre-determined amount of time (5–30 min). At the end of the desired holding time, the vessel was cooled rapidly by plunging into a room temperature water bath.
2.3. Protein recovery
After the HTP step, a slurry containing algae, proteins, and other residual compounds was obtained. For protein extraction, the slurry was first mixed with and vortexed in acetone (final concentration 80%) to precipitate the water soluble peptides, improve the accessibility of the protein to the urea and reduce the level of chlorophyll and other pigments which could interfere with the protein assay. After an hour, the samples were centrifuged (∼17000g, 5 min) before the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 8 M urea and left for 1 hour at room temperature for protein extraction. Urea is a chaotropic agent, which disrupts hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between proteins and has been widely used as a protein solubilisation agent.27 At high concentrations, it solubilises proteins by denaturing their secondary protein structure and interacting via hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbone. The samples were spun down again (∼17000g, 5 min) and the supernatant was removed prior to analysis for protein content. Further analysis was also performed to calculate the process efficiency using solvents other than acetone (methanol and ethanol). Heat was not used in the urea extraction step, to minimise protein carbamylation.
As an alternative to centrifugation, a filtration technique to recover proteins was also investigated. A 2 ml aliquot of heat-treated algae slurry was loaded onto 47 mm diameter glass microfibre filter (Whatman™ GF/C grade) and subjected to vacuum filtration (−80 kPa). First, the filtrate (equivalent to the supernatant in the centrifugation method) was recovered, leaving the filter cake of residual biomass solids. This was washed with aliquots of acetone and subsequently subjected to urea extraction with aliquots of 8 M urea. The supernatant and urea aliquots recovered using this method were analysed for protein content using the Bradford protein assay.
2.4. Composition of algae
Elemental microanalysis was performed according to a modified Pregl and Dumas method with the FLASH 2000 CHNS/O Analyzer.34 The microalgae sample, in a tin capsule, was dropped at pre-set intervals into a vertical quartz combustion tube at 1020 °C that was constantly purged with helium. When the sample was introduced, the chamber was purged with pure oxygen, and flash combustion took place. The resulting gasses (N2, CO2, H2O, and SO2) were analysed via a gas chromatograph fitted with a thermal conductivity detector. The process for oxygen determination was similar. The sample was analysed in a silver capsule which was heated to 1060 °C. It was then passed over nickel coated carbon that converts the oxygen to CO, which was analysed by gas chromatography as described above. Biochemical composition of the algae feedstock is shown in Table 1.

To determine the amino acid composition and total protein content of untreated and heat-treated algae, the samples were hydrolysed in 6 M HCl at 110 °C for 24 h, and then analysed on a Waters Acquity UPLC (Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography) System. Cysteine and tryptophan are not estimated by this procedure.
2.5. Protein quantification
To determine the amount of protein extracted from the algae, a Bio-Rad protein assay kit was used, employing the Bradford Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye-binding assay method.35 A calibration curve was prepared using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). The optical density at 595 nm was measured using either a PowerWave™ XS Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.) or an Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader (Tecan Group Ltd).
SDS-PAGE was used to determine the average size of the extracted proteins, employing a 4% stacking gel and a 16% resolving gel in Tricine buffer.36 A PageRuler™ Prestained Protein Ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 to 180 kDa was used to estimate the protein molecular weight. The gel was run at 100 V for approximately 4 hours, stained in Coomassie blue stain (0.1% Coomassie blue R250 40% methanol/10% acetic acid) staining solution overnight and de-stained in 40% methanol/10% acetic acid. After de-staining, the gel was photographed for analysis.
2.6. Sephadex G-50 chromatography
Sephadex G-50 chromatography was performed to separate relatively high MW proteins from lower MW species, to enable an estimation of the protein content as a proportion of the high MW components of the HTP extracts. It was carried out with a liquid chromatography column (Merck, Luer Lock, Non-jacketed, I.D. × L 1.0 cm × 20 cm, bed volume 16 mL) for both the HTP supernatant and for the urea extract from the insoluble HTP pellet. In addition, the UV-visible spectrum was examined to identify possible adduct formation resulting from the HTP process.
Chromatography of the HTP supernatant was conducted in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6 and 20 mM NaCl. In the case of the urea extract of the HTP pellet, the chromatography solvent included 8 M urea to maintain the solubility of the proteins during separation.
2.7. Optical microscopy
To determine the level of cell disruption, the algae were examined by optical microscopy (Olympus IX71) throughout the HTP process. Samples of algae were taken fresh, after HTP, after AX, and after UX. These samples were compared visually.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Heat treatment experiment
Each aliquot of algae was heated in the HTP vessel to one of three different temperatures (120, 150, 180 °C) at one of four different holding times (5, 10, 20, 30 min). On average, it took around 1, 6, and 9 minutes for the vessel to reach the target temperatures of 120 °C, 150 °C, and 180 °C respectively. The average variation in temperature during the holding time is low (<3%). After cooling the vessel down using a water bath, the internal temperature dropped below 100 °C within 1 min across all experiments. The temperature readings were calculated from the pressure gauge (i.e. through saturated water pressure) which, according to calibration tests, proved to be a more accurate sensor than the thermocouple attached to the vessel.
3.2. Effect of heat treatment on algae
The effect of temperature and holding time on the microalgal biomass can be seen in Fig. 2A. As either temperature or holding time was increased, the pellet volume of the resulting microalgae biomass decreased, presumably due to breakdown of algal material into water soluble or gaseous compounds16 and/or due to the greater compressibility of the remaining cellular solids once the intracellular contents have been released. At the same time, the colour of the heat treated algae slurry shifted from green to a yellow/brown colour as the temperature was raised from 120 to 180 °C, probably due to Maillard reactions.37,38 Increased temperature also caused a “roasted peanut” smell from the algal slurry, which dissipated after a short time. Up to 150 °C, the heat-treated slurry had a smooth consistency but at higher temperatures, granular clumping was observed. The aqueous phase (Fig. 2A) has a solids concentration ranging from 29 mg ml−1 at 120–5 to 71.4 mg ml−1 at 180–30.

Protein yield. 

Fig. 2B shows the resulting protein extraction performances based on the protein content of the untreated algae, which is 38.81% (Table 2). It appears that 120 °C treatment actually impedes protein recovery, as the untreated algae demonstrate better protein extraction efficiency than the 120 °C treated sample after acetone and urea treatment. Possible explanations include a failure to disrupt the cell wall and/or protein denaturation and aggregation within the cell, making the extraction more difficult compared to non-HTP treated algae. At 150 °C an increased level of protein extraction was observed, and the optimum temperature level was found to be at 180 °C, where protein extraction efficiency was maximised. It was observed that protein extraction efficiency increased up to 10 minutes of holding time and started decreasing thereafter. The samples from the optimum (180 °C, 10 min) treatment were therefore utilised for other further analyses.

While it is possible that using a slightly higher temperature than 180 °C for a short holding time (<10 min) might offer a better extraction performance, for example by using continuous flow equipment, the rapid heating required is beyond the operating range of the research equipment used in this study. However, the decrease in extraction efficiency with longer holding times indicates that increasing the temperature will only improve performance to a limited degree. Automated (temperature and pressure) experimental setups with high quality heat-transferring materials may improve both the efficiency of the process and the overall performance of the greater biorefinery system. Besides proteins, removing non-volatile components (e.g. ash, metals) may further improve the downstream processes26 by increasing the higher heating value and purity of the produced biofuel. Additionally, the optimisation of microalgal growth parameters (e.g. culture conditions, protein/lipid productivity, bioreactor design, plant operation) would allow for efficient use of biomass and value maximisation for the co-produced proteins and biofuels.
It is important to note that all of the experiments were performed using algae that were frozen immediately after harvesting. Freezing can disrupt cell walls and could have affected the results. Nevertheless, the low protein extraction levels at 120 °C suggest that this effect is insignificant.
The total protein content and amino acid composition of the algae, before and after heat treatment (180 °C, 10 min), is shown in Table 2. The nitrogen-to-protein conversion factor for the Chlorella sp. used in this study, calculated from the elemental nitrogen and total protein content, is 3.92. It is clear that most amino acids are unaffected by the HTP process. As lysine and arginine readily participate in Maillard reactions, losses (22% and 14% respectively) of these amino acids (probably due to adduct formation) were anticipated, though losses of acidic sidechains also occurred.
Future work will examine yields of tryptophan and cysteine, which were not assayed here, as well as ways to reduce the loss of lysine and arginine. For instance, attempts to reduce Maillard reactions could be made by regulating pH and by the addition of small amounts of protective compounds, including antioxidants, phenolics, or amines, which can potentially interfere with glycation of lysine and arginine.39 These approaches may reduce both the colour of the product and the loss of these essential amino acids.37 Enzymatic40 or chemical39 removal of adducts to regenerate these sidechains is also possible but may not be economically feasible.
The HTP process is also potentially applicable to other types of biomass. For instance, Reisinger et al. (2013) has found a similar behaviour (protein yield vs. temperature and holding time) in protein solubilisation during hydrothermal treatment of wheat bran, with maximum extraction at 180 °C, 20 min.41


Cell wall disruption. 
Optical microscopy showed that the basic cellular morphology was retained even after treatment at 180 °C, with little non-cellular debris present (Fig. 3), in contrast to physical disruption procedures such as bead-milling42 or sonication,43 which typically fragment the cell into a multitude of small fragments. Regardless, the cellular structures are clearly permeable since the extractable protein amount increases with the temperature (Fig. 2B).
 Fig. 3  Optical microscopy brightfield photographs of Chlorella sp. 11_H5 at different subsequent stages in the process. A, fresh; B, heat-treated at 180 °C at 10 min; C, acetone-treated; D, urea-treated. 
Heat-treatment therefore results in the disruption of the cell wall but probably not the complete breakdown of the cell wall structure. From Fig. 3A–D the cells become successively smaller presumably due to the cell wall disruption and loss/extraction of compounds during each step.


Protein hydrolysis. 
The absence of specific bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) clearly demonstrates that the cellular protein has been randomly hydrolysed, the majority of the proteins after heat treatment being 8 to 14 kDa (i.e. 80–140 amino acids long), although smaller peptides are present, and a smear up to 50 kDa or so is also evident. This suggests 2–4 points of random hydrolysis per molecule for a typical 50 kDa protein (Fig. 4). Interestingly, although the average protein size did decline with higher temperature, the effect was not dramatic, suggesting that extraction efficiency depended as much on accessibility to solvent (i.e. cell wall degradation) as it did on protein hydrolysis. Since the urea-treated solids in these experiments were not completely dispersed to the level of individual cells, it may be that further extraction of residual protein is feasible with appropriate mechanical or chemical treatment.
 Fig. 4  SDS-PAGE gels stained by Coomassie brilliant blue G-250. 120, 150 and 180 lanes are filled with 20, 10, and 5 μl of UX solution, respectively. Magenta markers denote the location molecular weight peaks (kDa) in each lane. Std, protein standard; other lanes correspond to HTP temperature-holding time, respectively. 
If the extracted protein is to be used as animal feed or potentially as human food, it is important to assess its bio-functionality and digestibility. Intensive cell disruption methods denature proteins and result in loss of bioactivity44 but not necessarily digestibility. While limited heat could improve the digestion efficiency through modest protein denaturation and partial hydrolysis, more extensive treatments may result in severe losses of essential amino acids and lower protein digestibility.45 For an accurate determination of price, further evaluation of the protein extract is required to determine the most appropriate target markets for product realisation (e.g. aquaculture feed, cattle feed, food fortificant/additive), along with the development of techno-economic analyses of dedicated protein production and integrated biorefinery systems (i.e. plant design, protein recovery techniques such as ultra- or nano-filtration).
Similar pressure and temperature regimes to our HTP step are employed by other heat and or pressure based methods, such as flash hydrolysis46 and steam explosion47,48 which are expected to yield a similar, or possibly slightly higher, degree of cell disruption and protein hydrolysis. In the case of steam explosion the pressure related disruption (i.e. sudden pressure release) shows promise for microalgal biomass.48 However, whereas HTP can utilise the same equipment as the HTL downstream processing, steam explosion would require additional capital expenditure and so may be more suitable when different downstream processing steps are envisaged. Furthermore the drop in pressure may negatively impact heat recovery and so reduce system efficiency.

3.3. Effect of acetone and urea
Even when recycled, UX represents an additional cost in complexity and material, so it was of interest to examine the extraction efficiency with a reduced urea concentration or a reduced ratio of urea solution to biomass solids. Different concentrations of urea (4, 6, 8 M) were therefore utilised to examine how they affect protein recovery rates. Lower protein extraction resulted from using 6 M (10% lower) and 4 M (23% lower) urea. Since 8 M urea is normally sufficient to completely solubilise uncrosslinked proteins, there is no advantage in further increasing the concentration to the limit of solubility (∼10 M) but the reduced recovery with lower concentrations suggests that 8 M urea is preferable for extraction.
The effect of a 4:1 acetone, methanol, and ethanol pre-treatment on the efficiency of protein extraction by urea was also examined. It is known that solvent extraction of lipid from intact cells is often inefficient.49 However, after cell disruption, acetone, ethanol, and methanol should all be able to effectively delipidate the biomass. By partially or wholly depleting phospho- and sulfolipid from the biomass, hydrophobic membrane-embedded peptides may be better exposed to the urea solution. These solvents also remove chlorophyll and chlorophyll breakdown products which can potentially interfere with the protein assay. As these solvents lead to protein precipitation, losses of protein in the solvent supernatant is not likely. Although an additional cost of the process, these solvents are renewable, inexpensive, of low toxicity and relatively easy to recover, and may not be needed in large quantities since membrane disruption of the solids fraction, rather than complete delipidation, is probably sufficient. The results suggest that the use of acetone in particular leads to better and more consistent efficiencies in protein recovery (Fig. 5A). Although still reasonable in efficiency, UX without AX is both lower and less reproducible, yielding values from 33% to 42% extraction compared to over 60% with acetone. Performing the AX at a higher temperature (40 °C) did not increase the final protein recovery rates (Fig. 5B). Considerable amounts of green pigments (presumably mainly chlorophyll and carotenoids) were removed via AX, though the biomass remained strongly coloured. The use of methanol and ethanol in place of acetone (Fig. 5C) showed that these solvents also led to improved protein recovery, although acetone was the most effective. Methanol and ethanol are simpler organic solvents and might offer a more sustainable means of protein production, provided the loss in extraction efficiency is balanced with a lower bulk price of these solvents compared to acetone as well as the economic and energetic cost of solvent recovery for recycling.
 Fig. 5  Changes in protein extraction efficiency based on process conditions. A, protein extraction efficiency versus acetone concentration. The UX was performed with different acetone concentrations. B, the effect of acetone (80%) and its temperature on protein extraction efficiency. The UX was performed with and without acetone at different temperatures. C, the effect of solvent selection and concentration on protein extraction efficiency. The UX was performed with different solvents and concentrations. D, filter-wash runs on protein extraction efficiency. The filter was loaded with 2 ml of HTP slurry and the filtrate/supernatant (“SN”) was collected. The filter cake was then washed with 2 ml acetone aliquots. Subsequently aliquots of 8 M urea were filtered through the remaining cake to extract the protein. The protein in each aliquot was estimated using protein assays and expressed as a percentage of the total yield of protein extracted. 
3.4. Filter-washing experiment
Although reasonably reproducible, extraction by vortex mixing in centrifuge tubes is sub-optimal for dispersal of the heat-treated solids. Filtration was investigated as a more efficient way than centrifugation to separate the biomass solids from the liquid fraction following HTP, as well as a potential support for efficient, minimal use of solvents. The optimum (180 °C, 10 min) HTP sample was used to test the efficiency of filter-washing (Fig. 5D).
Acetone washing was efficient, with good flow rates and almost all of the recoverable chlorophyll extracted in the first wash, and with negligible quantities being extracted after the sixth wash. In contrast, for the urea filter-washes, the flow rate was slow once the filter surface was completely covered with filter cake. The highest extraction was achieved in the second wash, and significant extraction of protein continued until the sixth wash (Fig. 5D). The higher extraction in the second wash is probably due to the dehydrating effect of acetone and the vacuuming process, which caused the biomass to absorb some of the 8 M urea solution during contact. In addition, it is important to note that both acetone and urea filter-washing resulted in negligible extraction efficiencies after the sixth attempt.
The HTP liquid fraction (the filtrate/supernatant “SN”) has the highest protein concentration (21%) compared to individual UX fractions in this case, but the total amount of soluble protein in all urea extractions combined exceeds (63%) this value. Potentially, the extraction of proteins from both of these phases will result in an extraction efficiency of 84%. However, in this configuration, further loading of the filter with biomass might impede the speed of filtration as when loaded with 5 ml of algal slurry in a test run, the filter became clogged. In an industrial setting, acetone washing on a filter promises to be an efficient process but subsequent urea extraction is probably better carried out following physical dispersion of the filter cake. This suggests that a vacuum belt filter followed by a mixing tank for urea extraction might be a useful configuration in an industrial setting and could minimise the amount of solvent required.
It will be important to examine and compare physical methods to improve the dispersion of solids during urea extraction, as well as the minimum amount of solvent required to yield a satisfactory urea extraction; for example the minimal amount of urea solution that can be used has not yet been definitively determined. One advantage of acetone treatment is that, following filtration, the solids can be completely dehydrated (i.e. with 100% acetone) and this in turn facilitates protein powder formation and ease of handling. The resulting loss of water will also minimise the amount of urea solution required to maintain an effective 8 M concentration. Ultimately, detailed techno-economic (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) modelling of this process within a greater biorefinery system is required to understand and optimise the value and costs associated with these solvent, urea, and protein streams, and how they change the triple bottom line (economic, social, and environmental) performance of next-generation microalgae production plants.
3.5. Sephadex G-50 chromatography
To examine the distribution of high and low MW species resulting from the HTP process, a sample of the HTP liquid fraction (Fig. 2) immediately after HTP was centrifuged to remove residual solids, and subjected to Sephadex G-50 chromatography (Fig. 6A). The corresponding UV-visible spectra of the void and bed volume fractions are shown in Fig. 6B. Similarly, an acetone-urea extract of the HTP pellet was chromatographed in the presence of 8 M urea to maintain the solubility of the protein during separation (Fig. 6C and D). The chromatographic flow rates for the supernatant and the urea extracts were approximately 0.6 and 0.3 ml min−1, respectively.
 Fig. 6  Chromatography and UV spectra of the protein extracts. A, Sephadex G-50 size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the HTP liquid fraction (A280 profile); B, UV spectra of the corresponding column fractions from A (V0 fraction 7; Ve fraction 27); C, Sephadex G-50 SEC of the acetone-urea extract of the whole HTP sample; D, UV spectra of the corresponding fractions from C (V0 fraction 6; Ve fraction 27); for the bed volume (Ve) fractions (red lines), the spectra were downscaled 7-fold (panel B) or 2-fold (panel D) for comparison purposes. 
The majority of the 280 nm absorbance in the HTP liquid fraction (Fig. 6A) is due to low molecular weight species (fractions 20–30), probably water-soluble products of the Maillard reactions. Bradford assay of the void (V0) peak yields 0.33 mg mL−1 protein which is compatible with the A280 of 0.24 (assuming an average A1%1 cm of 1.0); the lower estimate from spectroscopy suggests a loss of tryptophan may have occurred (which is expected from the HTP process). The A280 peak is itself superimposed on a tail into the visible region with a distinct shoulder at ∼320–340 nm which is probably due to Maillard adduct formation (Fig. 6B, black line), most likely pentosidine, which is a common lysine adduct;39,50 carboxymethyl lysine is also to be expected.51 The low MW (Ve) species (Fig. 6B, red line) display a major peak at 287 nm with a substantial tail into the visible region which confers a distinct brown colour.
In the case of the urea extracted pellet (Fig. 6C and D), the peak void volume fraction shows a similar 280 nm protein spectrum with a ∼340 nm shoulder but also contains a small peak ∼420 nm and a very small absorption ∼560 nm which could be due to residual chlorophyll or chlorophyll breakdown products. Similarly to the protein from the HTP liquid fraction, the A280 (0.72) appears superimposed on the spectrum of the coloured adduct (and residual chlorophyll), preventing an accurate protein estimate. However, the corresponding Bradford assay value (0.42 mg mL−1) is again compatible with the UV-visible spectrum.
The existence of the 280 nm peak and its reasonable correlation with the Bradford assay suggests that protein comprises the majority of the molecular species in this high molecular weight fraction. As expected, some modification of the protein has occurred, presumably with lysine and arginine sidechains due to Maillard reactions, corresponding to the ∼15–20% drop in these amino acids seen upon amino acid analysis (Table 2).
Desalting, followed by hydrolysis and HPLC, may in the future allow the identification of the adduct species (including the 340 nm peak) which would be useful if the protein were to be employed as a food source. Such identification may assist when devising ways to inhibit or control protein glycation,37 to reduce sidechain modification during the HTP step.
4. Conclusions
Microalgae biorefinery applications for bulk commodities such as fuel are still currently expensive, with downstream costs accounting for 50–60% of total costs, against 20–40% in conventional bulk biotechnology applications.52 Sustainable circular production of algal products (e.g. sustainable bio-based production, nutrient and waste recycling, cascaded and resource-efficient value streams)53 can improve the overall performance of microalgae biorefineries through establishment of co-production streams. Co-production of protein as a microalgae-based feedstock is synergistic with biofuel production (i.e. especially for thermochemical processes) and offers significant opportunities for market expansion.
Our results suggest that the combination of HTP with a short holding time (180 °C for 10 min) combined with partial solvent delipidation and urea extraction (UX) allows for the highest protein recovery efficiency (currently 62%). Even without process optimisation, this value can be as high as 84%, if a filter-washing technique is employed. Lower temperatures (120 °C) were shown to be ineffective in disrupting cell walls, while at 150 °C, this effect is sub-optimal. HTP-UX allows processing of wet biomass with green chemicals, which can be commercially produced using renewable technologies (urea, through ammonia;29 ethanol or acetone through biomass30,54) and produces a flexible protein-rich feedstock, which can be processed in different ways for protein recovery. Industrial HTL processes can utilise the existing, energy efficient HTL equipment for this additional HTP step, along with simple filtration and stirred tank equipment for the solvent extractions. Consequently, little extra capital expenditure or energy would be required while a valuable product stream is created. Extraction of these high-value protein products may enable green production of food and feed sources, while potentially providing a better feedstock for the production of green biofuels as part of a greater circular bioeconomy.
