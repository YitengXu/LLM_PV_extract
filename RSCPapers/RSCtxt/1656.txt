    , Accepted 7th November 2020First published on 8th November 2020AbstractThe emerging inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite is regarded as a promising candidate for future photovoltaics due to its superior photo-physical properties and thermal stability, but it usually requires a high fabrication temperature (>250 °C) and suffers from possible phase transition from a cubic α-phase to a non-perovskite δ-phase under ambient conditions, restricting its commercial applications. Herein, we demonstrated an additive-assisted hot solution spin coating route to simultaneously lower the fabrication temperature and stabilize the cubic phase structure. The incorporated biuret additive, consisting of functional amino and carbonyl groups, can strongly associate with the halide plumbates in the solution and generate optimal intermediate adducts of CsI–biuret–PbX2 to seed the large crystal growth, which can significantly reduce the perovskite formation energy and enable the low-temperature (120 °C) fabrication of α-phase CsPbI2Br. It was realized that the added biuret was mainly retained at the grain boundaries that effectively passivated antisite or under-coordinated defects, boosting the crystal quality with an improved photoluminescence quantum efficiency. In addition, the biuret molecules can act as anchors among the grains to stabilize the phase structure and prevent moisture permeation. As a result, a champion efficiency of 13.3% with improved ambient air stability was achieved in inverted all-inorganic perovskite solar cells, providing a cost-effective route to prepare high quality inorganic perovskites.
Introduction
The emerging organic lead halide perovskites were regarded as one of the most promising candidates in the development of next-generation photovoltaic technology owing to their remarkable photo-physical properties and cost-effective low temperature fabrication process. Even though the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells based on perovskites has improved swiftly from 3.8% (ref. 1) to 25.5% (ref. 2) in the last decade, the thermal instability and inherent volatility of labile organic components caused an inevitable stability issue under operating conditions,3,4 restricting their practical applications. Recently, tremendous research attention has been shifted to the development of all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites, such as CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2, because of their superior thermal stability.5–8 Among the inorganic halide perovskites, CsPbI3 was firstly considered as an absorber to achieve high efficiency because of its appropriate bandgap (1.73 eV), and efficiency above 18% can be achieved.9 However, the intrinsic black phase CsPbI3 was unstable at room temperature and easily transformed into a yellow non-perovskite phase, especially in an ambient atmosphere.10 The undesired phase transition severely hindered the development of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells. Meanwhile, solar cells based on CsPbBr3 and CsPbIBr2 exhibited better device stability,6,8 but their wide bandgaps up to 2.3 and 2.05 eV limited the light harvesting. Therefore, a compromise between efficiency and stability must be achieved, and CsPbI2Br, which possesses both a reasonable bandgap (1.92 eV) and good phase stability at room temperature, has been spotlighted in the research community.11–13
The cubic CsPbI2Br (α-phase) perovskite is usually achieved by spin coating the precursor solution of CsI, PbI2 and PbBr2 with designed chemical stoichiometry in a polar solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by high-temperature (>250 °C) annealing due to the high formation energy of the α-phase CsPbI2Br,14–16 leading to high production cost and limited application in flexible electronics. At annealing temperatures below 150 °C,17 the CsPbI2Br perovskite exhibits a yellow orthorhombic phase (δ-phase) and poor crystallinity. Therefore, a route to regulate high quality α-phase CsPbI2Br perovskite growth at low temperature is highly demanded. It is known that triggering a high nucleation rate with a certain amount of nuclei is a prerequisite for high quality crystal growth.18 Accelerating solvent evaporation to reach supersaturation concentration or generating intermediate adducts with optimum molecular weight in the perovskite precursor have proven to be efficient strategies to enable fast nucleation. Moreover, creating an intermediate state in the precursor solution can significantly reduce the CsPbI2Br formation energy through modification of the direct transformation process (precursor → perovskite) to a two-step transformation process (precursor → intermediates → perovskite), and the conventional larger energy barrier for the perovskite formation can then be divided into two small barriers.19,20 Therefore, pre-treating the precursor solution was desirable to modify the crystallization kinetics. Some approaches have been developed to enable CsPbI2Br formation at low temperatures (<150 °C), for example, solvent engineering by using a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO to generate precursor–solvent adducts,19,21 hot-casting to firstly induce a CsPbBr3 phase in the precursor film that can seed the CsPbI2Br growth by mass exchange,22 incorporating additives such as hydroiodic acid,23 4-aminobenzoic acid,24 CH3COOCs,25etc. to generate precursor–additive adducts or compositional engineering by elemental substitution of the CsPbI2Br crystal lattice.26,27 The aforementioned methods can successfully generate intermediate states with low formation energy that further regulate perovskite growth so that α-phase CsPbI2Br can be formed at a relatively low annealing temperature. However, precisely controlling the molecular weight of the intermediates in a reproducible way is still a challenge. Additive engineering by incorporating organic molecules with functional agents into the precursor solution has proven to be a feasible strategy to create intermediate adducts with optimum molecular weight,23–25 but the material family of the specific molecules especially for those comprising different functional agents and bringing in synergistic benefits should be further exploited and their crucial roles in the crystallization dynamics, thin film quality and device performance need to be scrutinized.
Even though some progress has been achieved on CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells, most of the high-performance devices were based on the n-i-p architecture, in which a doping hole transport layer such as Spiro-OMeTAD was usually employed. The thermal instability of the Spiro-OMeTAD concealed the advantages of the superior thermal stability of CsPbI2Br, causing severe degradation of the n-i-p structure of the inorganic perovskite device under operating conditions.28,29 Therefore, the inverted (p-i-n) device structure, in which the hole transport layer can be replaced by some dopant-free organics30 or metal oxides,31 has recently received research attention because of its ease of fabrication and compatibility with the fabrication of tandem solar cells.32,33 However, the difference between the band gap (Eg) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) reflects large non-radiative recombination losses originating from bulk and interfacial defects and unfavorable energetic barriers to charge transport,33 especially for inverted devices.33–35 Some methods were developed to passivate the defect states via modifying the crystallization dynamics and elemental composition,36,37 chemically passivating the point defects of the crystal lattice and grain boundaries38 or smoothing the interfacial energy barrier.19,35 However, the efficiency of low-temperature processed inverted CsPbI2Br PSCs was still lower than 11%, which lagged behind that of state-of-the-art CsPbI2Br cells prepared by high-temperature annealing.35,38 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop low-temperature fabrication methods for efficient inverted CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells, and an ideal device optimization should advantageously combine the crystallization modification, defect passivation and phase stabilization in a feasible one-step deposition.
Herein, a functional carbamide molecule of biuret, which combines both amino (–NH2) and carbonyl (–CO) groups, was selected as a novel additive and added into the CsPbI2Br perovskite precursor solution, and its crucial role in determining the crystallization dynamics, film quality, photovoltaic performance and moisture stability was investigated in detail. The incorporation of the biuret molecules into the hot precursor solution enabled low-temperature (120 °C) fabrication of high quality α-phase CsPbI2Br perovskite, and the residual biuret effectively passivated defect states by chemical coordination and remained at the grain boundaries as an anchor to stabilize the cubic phase structure. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency of 13.3% with enhanced shelf-storage stability and moisture resistance was obtained in an inverted device with a configuration of ITO/NiOx/CsPbI2Br/PC61BM/Ag.
Results and discussion
As demonstrated in Scheme 1, a series of CsPbI2Br perovskite films were prepared via a one-step deposition method with different engineering on the precursor solution, such as room temperature spin coating (RTSC), hot solution spin coating (HSSC) and biuret additive-assisted hot solution spin coating (HSSC-biuret), in which a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO was used as solvent. Some obvious differences can be clearly distinguished during the spin coating process. Specifically, when prepared via RTSC (Scheme 1a), the as-spun film was nearly transparent (Fig. 1a) prior to thermal annealing, which was ascribed to the formation of a non-perovskite phase and some intermediate precursor–solvent adducts in the film.39 The as-formed adducts are supposed to regulate the perovskite crystallization, but usually a long duration (12 hours) of stirring or pre-heating the precursor solution is required to generate the intermediate adducts with optimum molecular weight.40 The so-called HSSC via preheating the precursor solution is one of the feasible ways to facilitate solvent removal and improve the solubility of PbBr2 and CsI in the polar solvent. Therefore, when the precursor solution was pre-heated at 70 °C for 10 minutes (HSSC, Scheme 1b), the appearance of the precursor film turned light brown (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, when a small amount of biuret molecules, consisting of functional amino (–NH2) and carbonyl (–CO) groups, was selected as additive and added into the hot solution (Scheme 1c), the color of the biuret-doped films right after the spin coating became dark brown (Fig. 1a), indicating that an accelerated crystal nucleation and partial perovskite phase was already formed during the spin coating process.

 Fig. 1  (a) Absorption spectra with photo images (inset) and (b) X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the perovskite precursor films prepared via RTSC, HSSC and HSSC-biuret, respectively. 
The corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the as-spun films are shown in Fig. 1. The absorption spectra with onset at around 680 nm (Fig. 1a and S1†) and characteristic peaks located at 14.6°, 20.8° and 29.5° in the XRD spectra (Fig. 1b) confirmed the presence of cubic α-phase CsPbI2Br in the precursor films. The intensity of the absorption and characteristic peaks in the XRD pattern followed the order of RTSC < HSSC < HSSC-biuret, suggesting different crystallization degrees in the precursor films prepared via different treatments on the precursor solution. In addition, an additional absorption peak at 520 nm was found in HSSC and HSSC-biuret treated samples (Fig. 1a), and the peak signal was more pronounced in the HSSC-biuret sample than the HSSC sample. Similar to previous reports,22 the absorption peak can be correlated with the absorption of CsPbBr3, which was prone to being formed because of the low formation energy and can further grow to CsPbI2Br via ion exchange upon thermal annealing. A close look at the XRD spectra (Fig. 1b) reveals that the bandwidths for the typical characteristic peaks were much broader compared to that of pure CsPbI2Br (Fig. 3d, discussed later on), confirming the existence of some bromide rich perovskites, such as CsPbBr3 and CsPbIBr2 in the precursor film. It was noticed from the inset of Fig. 1b that a small peak at 10.1° was observed in the precursor film prepared via RTSC, confirming the formation of δ-phase CsPbI2Br or CsI–PbX2–DMSO adducts.39 Based on the above observations, it seems that bromide-rich perovskites such as CsPbBr3 and CsPbIBr2 can be firstly generated in the precursor film, which can be used as nuclei to seed the CsPbI2Br crystal growth, and pre-heating the precursor solution and incorporating biuret molecules into the precursor are favourable for accelerating the nucleation and perovskite formation.
In order to investigate how the biuret molecules interacted with the perovskite precursors in solution, liquid state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy characterization was performed. As shown in Fig. 2a, the characteristic peaks at 8.48 and 6.76 ppm were assigned to the typical hydrogen signals of –NH– and –NH2 in biuret, respectively. When mixing the biuret with PbI2, PbBr2 or CsI, a clear position shift was observed for the two peaks, which was more pronounced when it was mixed with PbI2 than PbBr2 or CsI owing to the low ionization potential and low solubility of PbBr2 and CsI in the solvent.41 The peak shift in the 1H NMR spectra indicates the strong coordination of the amino and carbonyl groups with Pb2+ and halide ions, which is in accordance with previous reports.42–44 In comparison, when mixing the biuret with all perovskite components (CsI, PbI2, and PbBr2), a pronounced shift for the two peaks was observed as shown in Fig. 2a, suggesting an enhanced association of the additive with the precursor. It is known that a high concentration of free I− ions or some halide plumbate species in the precursor solution is prone to forming δ-phase perovskite45 or can be directly related to charge recombination centers in the as-achieved perovskite films.46 As seen from the UV-vis absorption spectra of the precursor solution in Fig. 2b, the absorption intensity in the range of 270–340 nm, related to the absorption of halide plumbates such as PbX2, PbX3−, and PbX42− (X = I, Br),46 was reduced as clearly shown in Fig. 2d, in which Δabs is equal to the absorption of CsPbI2Br minus absorption of CsPbI2Br–biuret. Therefore, the incorporation of biuret molecules into the perovskite precursor is able to generate a type of CsI–biuret–PbX2 adduct in solution with reduced halide plumbate concentration owing to the strong interaction between the base, acid group and the Pb2+, I− and Br− ions by denoting electrons from –CO to Pb2+ and hydrogen bonding between –NH2 and halide ions, and the structure of the as-formed adduct was speculated on as in Fig. 2e(I). The highly bonded adducts can act as nuclei to seed the perovskite growth, and the attached biuret molecules surrounding the crystals (Fig. 2e(II)) are favourable for mass transport because they drive free ions (Pb2+, Cs+, I−, and Br−) to move towards the nucleus and therefore facilitate large crystal growth and coalescence.47,48 The residual biuret molecules are retained at the grain boundaries and the surface (Fig. 2e(III)), and might act as anchor structures due to the formation of –CO⋯Pb2+ and –NH2⋯I− bonds at grain boundaries to reduce the phase vibration and hence improve the structural stability. Meanwhile, another peak at around 540 nm, correlated with the absorption of bromide-rich perovskites, appeared in the biuret-doped solution as shown in Fig. 2c, confirming that the bromide-rich perovskite was prone to being formed in the solution because of the low formation energy.

After spin coating, the samples were transferred to a hot plate for thermal annealing at a relatively low temperature of 120 °C. Fig. 3a–c show the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of CsPbI2Br films prepared from different precursor solutions. As shown in Fig. 3a, the film prepared via RTSC exhibited large crystals with numerous pinholes, which was due to aggressive crystal growth on limited nuclei. Particularly, the mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO is hard to remove via RTSC and has a rather weak interaction with the precursor, and only a few nuclei with low molecular weight can be generated. Upon high-temperature annealing, the crystals started to grow rapidly on these few nuclei, resulting in large crystal growth with limited coverage on the substrate. Some treatments, such as waiting for a certain time prior to the thermal annealing, anti-solvent method and gradient annealing, have been developed to facilitate the nucleation prior to the crystal growth and hence avoid the pinhole formation.3,49 However, the operation of these treatments was experience dependent with limited reproducibility. In contrast, the CsPbI2Br film with reduced grain size (∼150 nm) and improved surface coverage was obtained by preheating the precursor solution owing to the increased density of nuclei as confirmed by the light brown color and XRD pattern in Fig. 1. By further adding some biuret molecules into the precursor, the average grain size of the as-deposited perovskite film was increased to ∼240 nm. The XRD pattern in Fig. 3d presents some dominant peaks at 14.6°, 20.8° and 29.5° corresponding to the (100), (110), and (200) planes27 of 3D α-phase CsPbI2Br,39 respectively. The peak intensity of the as-obtained perovskite followed the same order as that of the precursor film. Compared with Fig. 1b, the bandwidths of the annealed samples were sharper, indicating a pure α-phase CsPbI2Br with improved crystal orientation. The elemental composition of the perovskite films was analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and as shown in Fig. 3e and f, the N element was detected and found to be distributed along the grain boundaries in the CsPbI2Br–biuret film (Fig. 3f).

In order to investigate the effect of biuret molecules on the photovoltaic performance of solar cells based on CsPbI2Br perovskites, inverted devices with a structure of ITO/NiOx/CsPbI2Br/PC61BM/Ag were fabricated as demonstrated in Fig. 4a, where 50 nm NiOx and 40 nm PC61BM were used as hole and electron transport layers, respectively. The typical J–V curves of the perovskite solar cells prepared by RTSC, HSSC and HSSC-biuret are plotted in Fig. 4b, and a PCE of 9.8% with a VOC of 1.03 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 13.9 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 68.8% was obtained for the device based on RTSC CsPbI2Br. By preheating the precursor solution, the PCE can be improved to 12.4% with a VOC of 1.09 V, a JSC of 15.3 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.3%. In contrast, a champion efficiency of 13.3% with a VOC of 1.12 V, a JSC of 15.6 mA cm−2 and a FF of 76.1% was achieved for the device based on HSSC-biuret CsPbI2Br at optimum biuret concentration and annealing temperature (Fig. S2 and S3†), respectively. The statistical deviations of the VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of the three types of devices are summarized in Fig. 4c–f. There is no doubt that all performance metrics of the device based on RTSC CsPbI2Br are relatively lower than those of the other two because of the presence of numerous pinholes within the films, which can act as charge recombination centers, seriously limiting the device performance.50,51

It is noted in Fig. 4 that the PCE enhancement of the device based on CsPbI2Br–biuret was ascribed to the gain from both VOC and JSC compared to that of pristine CsPbI2Br. To explore the origin of the enhancement in VOC and JSC, we compared the photo-physical properties of the pristine and biuret-doped perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S4,† the biuret doping did not change the optical properties of the perovskite, and the enhancement of the EQE was wavelength independent (Fig. S5†). In addition, no obvious difference was observed from the ionization energy measurements (Fig. S6†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels for both perovskite samples were located similarly at around 5.67 eV, which is on par with previous reports.52,53 Furthermore, we investigated the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite films on glass. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PL intensity of CsPbI2Br–biuret film was significantly higher than that of the pristine CsPbI2Br film, indicating reduced non-radiative charge recombination losses in the biuret-doped perovskite film. The TRPL spectra in Fig. 5b were fitted by a bi-exponential function with a fast (τ1) component and a slow one (τ2), which are listed in Table S1.† Typically, short lifetime τ1 represents the surface non-radiative recombination and the long lifetime τ2 is the bulk recombination.3 By introducing some biuret molecules, the surface and bulk recombination lifetimes of CsPbI2Br films were prolonged from 6.47 and 20.79 ns to 13.09 and 28.83 ns, respectively. It revealed that the residual biuret in the film can effectively passivate the trap states. To quantitatively evaluate the crystal quality of the perovskite films, we measured the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) for the pristine and biuret-doped perovskite films, respectively. As is clearly shown in Fig. 5c, the biuret-doped perovskite layer presents higher PLQE at all light intensities, with a value of 3.1% for 1 sun equivalent illumination, and reaching saturation at ∼7% for 10 sun equivalent illumination. In contrast, only 2% and 5% PLQE were obtained for 1 sun and 10 sun illumination in pristine CsPbI2Br films, respectively, suggesting a relatively low defect density in the biuret-doped perovskite. It is known that the PLQE can be directly correlated with the VOC,54 and the VOC difference (ΔVOC) of the two devices can be expressed as ,55 where VbiuretOC and VpristineOC, and PLQEbiuret and PLQEpristine are the VOC and PLQE for the biuret-doped and pristine CsPbI2Br device, respectively, while k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the electrical charge. Under 1 sun illumination, the ratio of PLQE is found to be around 1.5, suggesting a ΔVOC of ∼11 mV, which is in the same range of VOC enhancement extracted from statistical deviation of VOC in Fig. 4c. Therefore, the VOC enhancement can be ascribed to the improved crystal quality, in terms of enlarged grain size and the defect passivation effect of the residual biuret. To further confirm the defect passivation effect, we conducted Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum measurements. As shown in Fig. 5d, the typical –CO stretch peak in the CsPbI2Br–biuret film was shifted to a smaller wavenumber compared to that of pure biuret, which was attributed to the coordination between –CO and Pb2+,56,57 which can be confirmed by the formation of Pb–O bonds in the core energy level spectrum of Pb 4f7/2 in the biuret-doped perovskite (Fig. S7†), which effectively eliminate non-radiative charge recombination centers.

We further examined the shelf-storage stability of non-encapsulated CsPbI2Br devices by keeping them under a N2 atmosphere or ambient air conditions with relative humidity (RH) of 60%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, the stability of perovskite solar cells was significantly enhanced by incorporating biuret molecules into the CsPbI2Br perovskite. In particular, when stored under nitrogen conditions for 30 days as shown in Fig. 6a and S7,† 89.0 and 95.9% of the initial performance were retained for the pristine and biuret-doped perovskite devices, respectively. After 5 months of storage, the device based on the biuret-doped perovskite retained more than 90% of its initial performance as shown in Fig. S8,† suggesting a remarkable shelf-storage stability. It is known that the inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite is quite sensitive to moisture and a non-perovskite phase is prone to being generated when exposed to high humidity conditions because of the moisture-assisted perovskite phase transformation.3 It can only retain its device performance for a few hours or even minutes when exposed to high humidity conditions (RH = 60%). This is a big challenge for researchers working with inorganic perovskites especially in the summer season when the humidity is usually higher than 60%, because it is difficult to perform characterization experiments for which the samples need to be taken out of the gloveboxes. Therefore, the improvement of the moisture stability under high humidity conditions is very important. As shown in Fig. 6b, the solar cells based on biuret-doped CsPbI2Br were much more stable than those based on pristine CsPbI2Br within one day under high humidity conditions (RH = 60%, room temperature), and 5 times improvement was achieved. In order to investigate the mechanism of water-associated inorganic perovskite degradation, the CsPbI2Br films, with or without biuret additives, were stored in an ambient atmosphere for 0, 30, and 60 minutes and the XRD spectra and the sample appearance were monitored. As shown in Fig. 6c, some additional peaks at 10.1° appeared in the XRD pattern of the pristine CsPbI2Br, suggesting the transformation of α-phase perovskite to δ-phase perovskite.12 Moreover, the color of the samples in Fig. 6d started to become light and transparent, confirming the degradation of the CsPbI2Br film and the formation of a non-perovskite phase. Therefore, the poor moisture stability was ascribed to the extremely unstable α-phase CsPbI2Br under high humidity conditions. The stability enhancement of biuret-doped perovskite was attributed to two aspects. Firstly, as mentioned above, the biuret can effectively modify the crystallization kinetics and enhance the crystal quality in terms of enlarged grain size and preferred crystal orientation, which can reduce the water permeation channels and boost phase stability. And also, the incorporated biuret molecules are distributed within the grain boundaries and at the surface, and can act as anchor structures via the bonding between –CO and –NH2, and Pb2+, I−, and Cs− to reduce the phase vibration and hence improve the structural stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the crystallization kinetics of inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite could be finely tuned by engineering the perovskite precursor. The introduction of biuret molecules containing both Lewis base and Lewis acid groups into the perovskite precursor can generate intermediate adducts of CsI–biuret–PbX2, enabling a fast nucleation and facilitating the formation of cubic α-phase CsPbI2Br perovskite at low temperature (120 °C). The incorporation of biuret into the perovskite could significantly enlarge the grain size and passivate the defect states, thus increasing the carrier lifetime of the CsPbI2Br film. A champion efficiency of 13.3% was successfully achieved in an inverted device structure, which was among the highest efficiencies of inverted CsPbI2Br solar cells prepared at low temperature (<150 °C) as shown in Fig. S9,† and also the device stability was significantly improved under both N2 and ambient air conditions. Therefore, the doping of biuret molecules into the inorganic precursor provides not only a facile way to regulate the inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite growth at low temperature, but also to passivate the defects states and stabilize the phase structure by the association of the functional amino and carbonyl groups with Pb2+ and I− for enhanced efficiency and operational stability (Fig. S10†).

Then, 0.8 M CsPbI2Br precursor solution with (2 mg mL−1) or without biuret additive was spin coated on the NiOx layer at a speed of 2500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 10 min in a glovebox. The electron transport layer was spin-coated on the top of perovskite by using a PC61BM (15 mg mL−1) solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 120 nm thick Ag electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask with a defined area of 0.04 cm2.
Characterization
A Schottky field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7800F) was used to obtain the top-view SEM images and EDS mapping images of the perovskite films. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using fluorescence spectrometers (FLS980 and F-4600, respectively). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using Smartlab (3 kW). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded using a JNM-ECZ400S/L1 spectrometer. Current–voltage characteristics were measured under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G illumination) using an Enlitech solar simulator (Enlitech, SSF5-3A) and a Keithley 2400 meter. The light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was calibrated using a silicon reference cell (Enlitech, SRC-2020).
