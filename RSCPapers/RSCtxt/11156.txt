    , Accepted 8th December 2021First published on 9th December 2021AbstractOxidation reactions provide a wide range of important chemicals in industry; however, most of these chemicals are produced from fossil feedstocks. As a candidate of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the electrooxidation of biomass platform chemicals instead of a petroleum source offers a sustainable and atom-economic avenue toward organic oxygenates, with additional benefits when coupled with renewable electricity driven processes. This highlight article describes the representative examples in this nascent area, including oxidative dehydrogenation, coupling, and cleavage. We classify the examples into inner-sphere and outer-sphere electrode reactions based on the classical electrocatalysis concept for better understanding of the reaction mechanism. Moreover, we highlight the recent progress in oxidative biomass electrorefining via inner-sphere anodic reactions, which are strongly dependent on the nature of the electrode material. Particularly, the understanding of the formation of reactive oxygen species, adsorption of substrates, and reconstruction of anode materials is presented. Finally, the existing challenges and perspectives are discussed.

1. Introduction
Oxidative transformation of organic substrates is of importance for manufacturing polymers, pharmaceuticals, fragrances, fuels, etc., in industry and academic research.1,2 These commodities are mainly produced from non-renewable resources by selective oxidation via current petrochemical processes at elevated temperature and pressure with stoichiometric oxidants. For instance, the adipic acid production process produces adipic acid at an annual scale of multimillions of metric tons, in addition to stoichiometric amounts of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O).3 As a result, the dwindling supply of fossil resources and environmental issues are driving the development of sustainable synthesis of chemicals and fuels.
To circumvent these challenges, electrochemistry offers an efficient and sustainable route toward oxidative transformations instead of conventional chemical approaches.4 With sufficient potential bias, common organic substrates can lose electrons at the anode surface, producing highly reactive intermediates for dehydrogenation, oxygenation, and coupling.5,6 Particularly, the cost of renewable electricity (solar, hydro, and wind power) continues to plummet to below 10 cents per kW per h, which provides more economical possibilities for many electrotechnologies.7–10 In this context, many recent studies have been focusing on possible routes to make chemicals and fuels from renewable carbon resources (e.g., biomass),11–14 implementing completely sustainable and carbon neutral manufacturing (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Renewable electricity driven sustainable and carbon neutral biomass economy. 
Biomass represents an abundant and renewable alternative feedstock from photosynthesis, typically containing 40–45 wt% of oxygen in lignocellulose (Fig. 2).1 The highly oxygen-functionalized structure of biomass and its derivatives enables the energy-efficient and atom-economic production of organic oxygenates compared to that produced from petroleum feedstock without oxygen. Typical carbonyl compounds, such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA),15–19 adipic acid,14 glucaric acid,10,20 formic acid,21,22 acetic acid,12,23 lactic acid,24,25 and the precursor of gasoline,26,27 which can be obtained from biomass by electrooxidation are summarized in Fig. 2. The rapid development in this area along with a summary of reactions and progress of anode materials is well covered in recent reviews.11,28–32 Herein, we will focus on the reaction mechanisms involved in oxidative electrochemistry for deriving valuable products from biomass and its derivatives, including oxidative dehydrogenation, coupling, and cleavage reactions. Particularly, we aim to classify the reactions into the well-documented concept of inner-sphere and outer-sphere electrode reaction mechanisms for better understanding of the interaction between substrates, intermediates, and the anode.

2. Inner- and outer-sphere electrooxidation
The concept of inner-sphere and outer-sphere electron transfer reactions was introduced by Taube33 to deal with redox reactions of coordination complexes in solution, and was extended to heterogeneous electrode reactions by Bard.34 For outer-sphere reactions, as illustrated in Fig. 3 (left), the substrates, intermediates, and products do not interact strongly with the electrode material and electron transfer occurs by tunnelling across a solvation layer, while in an inner-sphere reaction there is a strong interaction between the substrate and the electrode surface. The outer-sphere reactions are generally insensitive to the nature of the electrode material,34 and thus cheap and inert materials (e.g., carbon,26 lead27) are often used as the anode in an aqueous electrolyte to avoid competitive OER in biomass electrooxidation. For example, various electrodes (Au, carbon felt, and BiVO4) give similar values of conversion and yield during homogeneous electrochemical HMF oxidation to FDCA mediated by a soluble redox mediator (Fig. 4a and b).35

In contrast, inner-sphere reactions show strong dependence on the electrode materials,34,36,37 where the substrates are adsorbed on the electrode via a shared ligand for heterogeneous electron transfer (i.e., proton coupled electron transfer, PCET) and react with interfacial reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Fig. 3). For instance, the electrooxidation of alcohols displays different onset potentials and pathways over different anodic catalysts.14,38,39 The concept of inner-sphere and outer-sphere reactions is well studied and discussed in conventional electrochemistry.33,34 The extension of this concept to the emerging area of biomass electrooxidation reactions is necessary, which is of significance for gaining insight into the reaction mechanism and designing electrode materials.
3. Outer-sphere electrooxidation of biomass derivatives
Outer-sphere electrooxidation reactions have long been demonstrated in organic synthesis, such as C–O coupling,40 C–N coupling,5,41 C–H oxidation,42,43 C–OH oxidation,44 oxidative aminocarbonylation,4etc. In these reactions, the carbon electrode is often used as the anode just for electron collection and transfer processes, while the solvent, electrolyte, additives and current are the main factors that determine the reaction pathway, selectivity and yield of the desired product. With the transition of fossil feedstocks to renewable resources for chemical synthesis in a sustainable way, outer-sphere electrooxidation was also applied for biomass conversion and is well summarized in recent literature.45–47 In this review, we briefly describe the representative cases for upgrading biomass derivatives via outer-sphere electrooxidation.
Molecule mediated electrooxidation
Soluble redox mediators are used for electrooxidation reaction, and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) is one of the successful examples. The Choi group reported that TEMPO can be used as a mediator for achieving near-quantitative conversion of HMF to FDCA with 100% faradaic efficiency in a (photo)electrochemical cell.35 The oxidation of TEMPO is thermodynamically more favourable than that of water or HMF at low onset potential (1.09 V vs. RHE), and thus the oxidized TEMPO (TEMPO+) can serve as a mediator to catalyse HMF oxidation in an electrolyte (Fig. 4a). Notably, the direct electrode–HMF interaction is no longer necessary in this outer-sphere reaction system. Therefore, inexpensive and high surface-area anodic materials (e.g., carbon felt) can give a higher reaction rate and comparable FDCA yield and FE instead of an Au electrode. This is beneficial for lowering the capital cost of the electrolyzer in the scale-up of process.
Another advantage of soluble redox mediators for electrooxidation reactions is their accessibility to macromolecules with steric hindrance, such as lignin, cellulose, or native biomass. As shown in Fig. 4c, Stahl's group recently developed a chemo-selective approach for the oxidation of primary alcohols in lignin to the corresponding carboxylic acids using TEMPO or 4-acetamido-TEMPO (ACT) as redox mediators.48 This method has been shown to be effective for the oxidation of various lignin model compounds as well as extracted lignin from poplar wood. In addition, the electrochemical oxidation method renders the modified lignin susceptible to depolymerization, allowing for conversion of lignin into monomeric aromatic chemicals in good yields. Our group also reported a general electrochemical strategy for the Cα–Cβ bond cleavage of the β-O-4 linkage in lignin models with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) as the oxidant, achieving a high yield of aromatic aldehydes and phenols (Fig. 4d).49,50 The electrogenerated Cβ radical from the substrate and radicals from t-BuOOH readily undergo cross-coupling reaction, inducing the subsequent cleavage of the Cα–Cβ bond to the corresponding products. This strategy was demonstrated to be efficient for the transformation of a broad selection of lignin model dimers, polymeric compounds, and even macromolecular lignin into the desired aromatic aldehydes. In addition to organic redox molecules, inorganic mediators, such as polyoxometalates (Fig. 4e)51 and metal ions,52 were also demonstrated to be available for complex biomass electrolysis, lowering energy consumption (∼83%) for H2 production and co-producing organic oxygenates (e.g., formic acid).51
Oxidative radical coupling reaction
During biomass conversion, most derivatives are compounds with a low-carbon number (≤6). In the oxidative outer-sphere reactions without mediators, the organic substrate molecules can be oxidized into radical cations via single electron transfer. These reactive radical cations are easily coupled to each other (e.g., Kolbe electrolysis6,27) or cross-coupled with nucleophilic reagents (e.g., Michael addition26), providing opportunities for sustainable synthesis of multi-carbon products starting from biomass.
Levulinic acid (LA) is produced from biomass by acid-catalyzed transformation of carbohydrates.53,54 The electroreduction of LA has long been described in the literature,55,56 yet apparently never found a suitable application.27 In this context, Schröder and co-workers demonstrated the tandem electroreduction and Kolbe electrolysis for liquid fuel (i.e., n-octane) production from LA (Fig. 5a).27 Pioneering works by Faraday and Kolbe in the late 1800s have revealed that the anodic oxidation of carboxylic acids leads to radical decarboxylation, giving the corresponding alkyl radicals for subsequent C–C coupling, as well summarized in a recent review.6

Chen and co-workers reported an electrochemically triggered chain reaction for the conversion of furan derivatives to the precursor of transportation fuel (Fig. 5b).26 Specifically, 2-methylfuran (2-MF) was oxidized over a graphite electrode to yield a cation radical, which subsequently reacted with 3-hexene-2,5-dione, a derivative of 2,5-dimethylfuran, to produce 3-(5-methylfuran-2-yl)hexane-2,5-dione. After further hydrodeoxygenation, a branched alkane 4-ethylnonane with 91% yield can be obtained as liquid fuel.
4. Heterogeneous inner-sphere electrooxidation of biomass derivatives
In contrast to outer-sphere reactions, a judicious choice of electrocatalysts is needed at the anode to carry out inner-sphere oxidation transformation at lower overpotential and considerable rates. As the counterpart, there are guidelines for the development of effective materials for water oxidation, in light of the well-studied mechanism of OER. However, the reaction mechanism of electrooxidation of biomass platform molecules, as well as other sources of organics, unfortunately continues to be underrepresented. Consequently, we herein focus on four representative advancements of heterogeneous inner-sphere electrooxidation of biomass derivatives, namely (1) features of inner-sphere electrooxidation, (2) reactive oxygen species, (3) adsorption of the substrate, and (4) reconstruction of the catalyst.
Features of inner-sphere electrooxidation
One can typically distinguish inner-sphere reactions from outer-sphere reactions because the former depend very strongly on the electrode materials.34 Thus, the onset potential, reaction pathway, selectivity, and reaction rate can be tuned by modulating the electrocatalyst, leveraging the principles for designing OER catalysts. For instance, the electrooxidation of ethylene glycol (EG), a polyol from hydrogenolysis of cellulose57–59 or the hydrolysis of waste polyethylene terephthalate plastic,60–62 shows absolutely different electrochemistry behavior on various anode materials (Fig. 6a–d).61 Specifically, CoNi0.25P/NF displays a high selectivity (FE to formate = 91.3%) and high formate productivity (4.01 mmol cm−2 h−1) for EG oxidation at 1.7 V vs. RHE, surpassing other known electrocatalysts (Fig. 6d). In contrast, Pt/C requires low onset potential (∼0.45 V vs. RHE) for EG oxidation and gives glycolate (GA) as the main product at 1 V vs. RHE, while it decays at 1.7 V vs. RHE. These results demonstrate the nature of inner-sphere reaction of EG oxidation over these electrocatalysts.

Reaction conditions: 0.3 M EG in 1 M KOH electrolyte at 1.7 V vs. RHE for 0.5 h over RuO2, NiFe-LDH/NF, CoNi0.25OOH/NF, CoNi0.25Oy/NF, and CoNi0.25P/NF.

Another extensively studied biomass model compound is glycerol, a by-product from the bio-diesel industry. The main reaction pathways of glycerol electrooxidation are summarized and shown in Fig. 6e.21,22,25,32,63–65 The initial step is catalytic dehydrogenation of the primary or secondary alcohol group to give glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone, respectively, while the subsequent reaction direction is dependent on the electrocatalyst and electrolyte environment. The formed intermediates are highly reactive in a base electrolyte (Fig. 6e, right direction), leading to lactate,23–25 glycolate,65 tartronate,64 and formate,25,65 when using noble-metal based catalysts. On the other hand, the intermediates readily undergo C–C cleavage over non-noble metal catalysts (Ni–Mo–N,21 CuCo2O4,22) to formate (Fig. 6e, left direction), which is probably attributed to the higher onset potential of these catalysts (>1 V vs. RHE).
Reactive oxygen species for the biomass platform electrooxidation
Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) play key roles in various oxidation reactions, including the direct insertion into products,7,66–69 activating chemical bonds,70 and removing electrons and adsorbates over the catalyst surface.70–72 Thus, molecular oxygen or stoichiometric oxidants are needed in many thermo-driven processes to generate ROSs.3,73,74 Along with this requirement, the requirement of a high-pressure O2 atmosphere and elevated reaction temperature and potential environmental pollution are often inevitable. In contrast, ROSs (i.e., OH*, O*, OOH*) are readily formed during electrocatalytic water oxidation under mild conditions. These in situ formed electrophilic intermediates can react with nucleophiles (such as alcohol molecules) prior to OER.38,75 Identifying the species and roles of ROS in the electrooxidation of biomass platform chemicals is pivotal for understanding the reaction mechanism and designing advanced catalysts; however, it is still underexplored compared with the well-studied OER mechanisms.
In this respect, our group recently carried out isotope labeling experiments to investigate the reaction mechanism in oxidative upgrading of lignin derivatives to carboxylates over a Mn-doped CoOOH anode (Fig. 7a).14 As shown in Fig. 7b and c, the mass spectra revealed that the labeled 18O atoms from H218O were incorporated into the intermediate (acetophenone) and the final product (benzoic acid), owing to base promoted reversible ketone hydration and keto–enol tautomerism, respectively. These results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that adsorbed OH* from oxidized water is critical for activating the chemical bond via insertion into the reactants or intermediates in this reaction. Consistently, many studies have proven that the reaction between alcohol molecules and surface adsorbed OH* takes place very fast.70,75,76

Wang and co-workers reported a comprehensive study to understand how electrocatalysts function in a nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) on β-Ni(OH)2 and NiO anodes.38 They proposed that two Ni coordinated oxygen (μ2-O) and adsorbed OH* are the activity origins for β-Ni(OH)2 and NiO, respectively. For β-Ni(OH)2, NOR consisted of two steps (Fig. 7d), including electrocatalytic dehydrogenation of two Ni coordinated OH (μ2-OH) to electron-deficient μ2-O and subsequently spontaneous extraction of H from nucleophiles (HMF, methanol, etc.). Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) proved that D of CD3OD replaces the hydrogen atom of β-Ni(OH)2 during NOR (Fig. 7e). In comparison, electrophilic oxygen in OH* is more likely to be the NOR activity origin of NiO because NiO lacks hydroxyl species (Fig. 7f).
Adsorption behavior of the substrate on the catalyst surface
In inner-sphere reactions, the reactants and intermediates are often specifically adsorbed on the electrode surface via a shared ligand for electron transfer and chemical bond activation.34 Therefore, the identification of adsorption sites of the catalyst and the preferred functional group is of key importance for understanding the reaction mechanism and structure–activity relationship of catalytic materials.
In this respect, Wang's group found that CoTd2+ and CoOh3+ in Co3O4 are responsible for adsorption and oxidation, respectively, in the electrooxidation of HMF by introducing Zn2+ and Al3+ for the occupation of tetrahedral and octahedral sites (Fig. 8a).77 On this basis, they created a CuCo2O4 spinel oxide to enhance the exposure degree of Co3+ and to boost acidic adsorption oxidation, leading to 4-fold enhancement for HMF oxidation to FDCA. In a recent work (Fig. 8b), they reported a strategy of modulating the adsorption energy of HMF on Co3O4 by decorating with single-atom Ir (Ir-Co3O4).78 Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements revealed that single-atom-Ir modification of Co3O4 can enhance the adsorption of CC groups of HMF, exhibiting a much lower onset potential of 1.15 V vs. RHE for HMF transformation. Moreover, they demonstrated the role of the oxygen vacancy on Co3O4 in the preferential adsorption of OH− by DFT calculations, which could accelerate the rate-determining step of the dehydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) intermediates in this reaction.79 In addition, DFT calculations also indicate that the oxygen vacancies in ultrathin CoAl-LDH facilitate the adsorption of HMF molecules and decrease the energy barrier of this step.80

Additionally, operando spectroscopic techniques can provide a more straightforward view of the adsorption behavior of molecules on the electrode surface.81–84 In this respect, Kornienko and Heidary used the operando surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to probe the HMF oxidation on gold nanoparticles as both the electrocatalyst and the SERS substrate (Fig. 8c).81 The signals at 338 and 355 cm−1 are likely from the Au–O interaction of Au with the HMF alcohol group, indicating the preferential oxidation of the HMF alcohol group to form 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF), via route I in Scheme 1. Furthermore, they constructed non-noble metal oxy(hydroxide) coated Au nanostructures to visualize catalyst surface reaction intermediates (Fig. 8d).83 For instance, a strong band at 1667 cm−1 corresponding to the aldehyde group was observed over the Ni(OH)2 surface and its blue-shift relative to that of the solution spectrum (1664 cm−1) suggests an interaction of this group of HMF with the Ni surface. On the other hand, the alcohol group was found at an identical band position (1027 cm−1) relative to the solution spectrum, indicative of minimal interaction between the alcohol and the Ni surface. This adsorption behavior leads to a different reaction route (route II in Scheme 1) over non-noble metal oxy(hydroxide) compared to that of the Au electrocatalyst for HMF transformation.

In addition, Wang and co-workers revealed the advantageous oxidation of the aldehyde group on HMF molecules (i.e., route I in Scheme 1) over a carbon-coupled nickel nitride nanosheet (Ni3N@C) electrode by in situ sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy.84 As shown in Fig. 8e, only the HMF signal can be detected at a lower potential of 1.25 V, while the characteristic fork-shaped peaks at 1335 cm−1 and 1380 cm−1 attributed to HMFCA appear when the potential is increased to 1.35 V. The same reaction pathway was proposed for HMF oxidation over a nickel boride (NixB) electrocatalyst based on operando infrared spectroscopy experiments.85
Structural evolution of the catalyst
Tracking the structural evolution of materials and elucidating the nature of catalytically active sites are essential to tailor improved catalysts.86,87 During the OER process, a critical fact is that most pristine materials tend to undergo dynamic reconstruction and/or surface rearrangement to form a catalytically active state, which has been widely evidenced by ex situ and in situ characterization techniques.87–94 This phenomenon was also observed in the case of materials for the electrooxidation of biomass derived compounds.12,21,61,95,96
Qi and co-workers fabricated efficient Ni nanosheet forests anchored on carbon paper (Ni(NS)/CP) for the electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA, which showed improved activity compared to bulk Ni nanoparticles (Ni(NP)/CP).97 To reveal the origin of activity, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques were used (Fig. 9a–c) and the results suggested that the Ni(NS)/CP catalyst easily undergoes in situ oxidation to form Niδ+ species (i.e., NiO or NiOOH), which may serve as the key active phases for highly efficient HMF electrooxidation. The Ni(NS)/CP sample has smaller crystal grain sizes and more edge sites than Ni(NP)/CP, facilitating the reconstruction of the catalytic state during the reaction. Similar structural evolution of materials was also reported in a recent study that reported a hierarchical porous nickel (hp-Ni) catalyst for transforming the raw biopolymer chitin to acetate.12 As revealed by XPS and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), a complete oxidation of the electrode surface was identified, which was attributed to the high activity of the catalyst for chitin oxidation.

In addition to metals or metal oxides, metal borides,85,96 pnictides,84,98–101 chalcogenides,16,102–104 and carbides105 are extensively studied as high-performance electrocatalysts for organic oxidation. It was revealed that these materials were oxidized through a reconstruction process during OER to form metal (oxy)hydroxides on the surface or even in the bulk, especially in an alkaline electrolyte.88,90,106 In this respect, operando Raman spectroscopy was extensively applied for monitoring the dynamic surface structure evolution of anode materials in the electrooxidation of organics.38,95,96,104 For instance, Sun and co-workers demonstrated the generation of NiOOH from NiBx in 1 M KOH at 0.50 V vs. RHE, from the observation of the Ni3+–O bending peak at 471 cm−1 and the stretching peak at 554 cm−1 in the Raman spectra (Fig. 9d).96 After introducing HMF into the electrolyte, the two peaks gradually disappeared (Fig. 9e), indicating that electrogenerated Ni3+ species are the active intermediates during HMF oxidation. This phenomenon was also observed in the case of other nickel-based catalysts, such as Ni(OH)238 and Ni3N,107 using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
In our recent study, we investigated the structural evolution of a nickel-modified cobalt phosphide (CoNi0.25P) electrocatalyst for the electrooxidation of EG toward formate by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy.61 The combined results of TEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) indicated that the CoNi0.25P catalyst undergoes complete reconstruction to form a low crystalline metal oxy(hydroxide) analogue after the reaction (Fig. 9f and g). Furthermore, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) and wavelet transform (WT) analysis of EXAFS spectra also verified the phenomenon that CoNi0.25P evolved into a coordination oxidized unsaturated metal oxy(hydroxide) analogue during anodic EG oxidation and OER (Fig. 9h–k). By contrast, the structure of CoNi0.25P was well preserved after HER. Additionally, the intensity of the first-shell Co–O and second-shell Co–Co peaks of evolved CoNi0.25P post EG oxidation are lower than that of the sample after OER, suggesting their different extents of disorder. Overall, detailed characterization combined with control experiments revealed the in situ evolution of the CoNi0.25P catalyst into a low-crystalline metal oxy(hydroxide) as an active state during EG oxidation, which might be responsible for its advantageous performances.
In addition, other operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray diffraction and surface-sensitive soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, are powerful tools to investigate the dynamic bulk or surface structure of materials and are widely used in OER studies.87,90,108,109 In contrast, there are only a few applications of these techniques in the electrooxidation of biomass derivatives. Overall, the surface or bulk reconstruction of pristine materials is a common phenomenon during electrooxidation reactions for upgrading biomass derivatives. Further understanding and manipulating the direct reconstruction of catalysts will provide us with effective tools to fabricate robust catalysts. Thus, it must be carefully considered when establishing the structure–activity relationships for the reactions.
5. Conclusions and future perspectives
In summary, a large variety of valuable products, such as monomers of bioplastics, liquid fuels, and additives,26,61,102 can be obtained from biomass via oxidative electrorefining. We have classified the representative cases for oxidative electrorefining of biomass platform compounds into outer-sphere and inner-sphere reactions according to the interaction between the substrates, intermediates and the electrode surface. Particularly, we have paid attention to the progress in heterogeneous inner-sphere reactions, where a large number of underexplored issues remain. The main concerns involve (1) the real active sites and ROSs for organic electrooxidation are still incoherent, especially considering the reconstruction of pristine materials under oxidative conditions. Thus, operando spectroscopic studies with higher spatial and temporal resolutions are necessary to uncover the correlation between structural evolution and activity. (2) There is plenty of room to explore more reaction types and substrates for the electrocatalytic biomass valorization. The application of electrocatalysis in biomass conversion is still in an infant stage, and only a handful model molecules have been explored, such as HMF, glycerol, ethanol, and glucose. However, the large potential of this “biomass electrorefining” to contribute to the generation of value-added bio-active compounds and advanced fuels remains unrealized. (3) In spite of the recent great progress, a considerable gap exists between academic research and industrial applicability. The long-term operation stability of the catalyst, reaction activity and selectivity, and downstream separation and purification issues need further improvement.
