    , Accepted 10th March 2009First published on 14th April 2009AbstractPositively and negatively charged functionalized polythiophenes and single walled carbon nanotubes were sequentially adsorbed on indium tin oxide electrodes by electrostatic and van der Waals interactions using the layer-by-layer deposition method. The resulting donor/acceptor photoelectrodes were tested as photoelectrochemical cells. Upon illumination, monochromatic incident photoconversion efficiencies of 8.2 and 4.3% were determined for eight stacks of single walled carbon nanotubes with ammonium and sulfonate polythiophene derivatives, respectively.
Introduction
Harvesting energy from sunlight using photovoltaic (PV) technology is increasingly recognized around the world as a sustainable energy source. In recent years scientists have been trying to increase the efficiency of solar cells, whilst at the same time reducing dimensions and costs. Polymer based solar cells have attracted considerable attention in recent years because of their unique advantages, such as low cost, light weight, solution processability and flexibility. In this respect, polythiophenes (PT) are optimal candidates as electron donors1 because of their high absorption coefficients exceeding 105 M−1 cm−1 and their charge-carrier mobility up to 0.014 cm2V−1 s−1.2 The most efficient organic photovoltaic device is in fact based on a PT derivative P3HT.3

Carbon nanotubes (CNT)4 are very appealing as electron acceptor moieties in the photoactive layer not just because of their energetically low-lying π* orbitals, due to their largely extended conjugation, but also because they are almost defect-free which greatly contributes to a decrease in carrier recombination. Moreover, CNT possess a wide range of direct band gaps matching the solar spectrum,5 show a valuable photoresponse from ultraviolet to infrared,6 exhibit high charge mobility7 and reduced charge transport scattering,8 and provide high surface area (1500 m2 g−1) and good stability.9
Films of CNT and PT supported on indium tin oxide (ITO) have already revealed appreciable photocurrent generation.10 This process starts with the generation of excitons after photoirradiation. The difference in electron affinity and ionization potential between the donor (PT) and the acceptor (CNT) then provides an inherent potential that breaks the symmetry, and thereby a driving force for the dissociation of the photogenerated excitons into electrons and holes that can be collected at opposite electrodes.11
However, devices fabricated using CNT and polymer blends, without previously processing the CNT, do not generally show efficient photocurrents. This is because of the poor dispersion of the CNT into the polymer, which leads to agglomeration across the film and shorting of the contacts.12
A valuable method used to obtain finely debundled CNT without altering their chemical structure consists of a non-covalent functionalization performed by sonicating them in an aqueous solution of pyrene-carrying carboxylate ions [1-pyrenebutyric acid (pyrene−)] or quaternary ammonium ions [1-(trimethylammonium acetyl)pyrene (pyrene+)] (see Scheme 1) as previously reported.13 The presence of these ionic groups was conveniently utilized for the construction of layer-by-layer (LbL) stacks on ITO previously covered with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Finally, as top layers, water soluble PT, namely poly{trimethyl-[7-(3-thienylsulfanyl)heptyl]ammonium iodide-co-thiophene} (1 I), or (sodium poly[2-(3-thienyl)-ethoxy-4-butyl-butylsulfonate] (Na 2) (see Scheme 1), were adsorbed on the CNT film.

LbL
14 is a simple and versatile method for preparing supported thin films. Since excitons have diffusion lengths limited to 7–20 nm, a bulk heterojunction with large donor/acceptor surface/unit volume will increase the solar cell efficiency. For that reason, the LbL approach, with its potential for obtaining heterojunctions at the monolayer level, is a very appealing technique. This process has several further important advantages over other techniques for preparing ordered multilayer thin films: the assembly is based on spontaneous adsorptions, the substrate can have, in principle, any size, shape, topography, or topology, surface functionality defects do not propagate and no stoichiometric control is necessary. A further technological advantage of the proposed process, relying on the LbL technique, is the drastically reduced materials consumption with respect to the conventional spin-coating deposition method. It is also proved that the necessary additional presence of charged groups on the polyconjugate materials does not affect the orbital energies of the π-delocalized framework and therefore the ionization potential of the conjugated polymer.14b
In preliminary work,10 a different ionic polythiophene derivative, that is, 7-(thien-3-ylsulfanyl)heptanoic acid (PSCOOH), was assembled by LbL with SWCNT pyrene+ and an internal photon to current efficiency (IPCE) between 1.2 and 9.3% was determined for single and eight sandwiched layers, respectively. In this case the construction of nanostructured photoelectrodes was carried out in THF solutions due to the limited solubility of PSCOOH in water.
In a step forward in the optimization of these types of solar cell, we have decided to use water soluble polymers such as 1, that bears a pH independent solvation of the quaternary ammonium group, and 2, that bears sulfonic acids.
Experimental
Materials

1-Pyrenebutyric acid was purchased from Aldrich. High-pressure carbon monoxide disproportionation single-walled carbon nanotubes (HiPCO SWCNT) were obtained from CNI. Poly{trimethyl-[7-(3-thienylsulfanyl)heptyl]ammonium iodide-co-thiophene} (1) was synthesized according to a previously published procedure.15Sodium poly[2-(3-thienyl)-ethoxy-4-butylsulfonate] (2) was purchased from American Dye Source.

Preparation of SWCNT pyrene+ suspension. 

            SWCNT suspensions were obtained in analogy to previous work.13a In detail, 1 mg of SWCNT and 4 mg of pyrene+ were dissolved in 20 ml of H2O and stirred at room temperature overnight. Next, the suspension was kept in a temperature-controlled (20 °C) sonication bath (115 W) for 1 h. To reduce the amount of free pyrene in solution, the SWCNT pyrene+ complex was centrifuged (i.e., 10000 rpm for 30 min) and decanted after 30 min standing. Finally, the recovered solid was resolubilized in water with concentrations of around 0.01 mg ml−1.


Preparation of SWCNT pyrene− suspension. 
1 mg of SWCNT was dispersed in 4 ml of H2O that contained 5 mg of pyrene−. The mixture was sonicated (115 W, 1 h), after which it was centrifuged. The solid, consisting of 4 mg, was removed and the solution was centrifuged further (6000 rpm, 10 min). However, to reduce the amount of free pyrene in solution, the SWCNT pyrene− complex was separated through ultracentrifugation (i.e., 10000 rpm for 30 min), and the recovered solid was resolubilized in water with concentrations of around 0.01 mg ml−1.


Preparation of films. 
Milipore® water was used in the preparation of the suspension/solutions and in the rinsing of all substrates/polymer films. ITO slides were cleaned in a detergent solution, acetone and isopropanol.


Preparation of ITO/PDDA/(SWCNT pyrene−/1)n. 
1% aqueous solutions of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) were used. ITO slides were coated with a precursor layer of PDDA (10 min exposure) followed by sequential deposition of SWCNT pyrene− and 1 (1 mg ml−1, 60 min exposure).


Preparation of ITO/PDDA/PSS/(SWCNT pyrene+/2)n. 
1% aqueous solutions of PDDA (pH = 8.5) and 1% aqueous solutions of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) PSS were used. ITO slides were coated with a precursor layer of PDDA (10 min exposure) and PSS (10 min exposure), followed by sequential deposition of SWCNT pyrene+ and 2 (1 mg ml−1, 60 min exposure each).

Characterization
UV–vis or UV–vis–NIR spectra were recorded with a Varian Cary 50 or a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were recorded by using a FluoroMax-3 spectrophotometer (Horiba Company). The experiments were performed at room temperature.
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a transparent cell that had provision to insert a working electrode (ITO), a counter electrode (Pt gauze) and reference Ag/AgCl (0.1 M KCl) (when bias voltage was applied). The electrolyte was 0.1 M Na3PO4 and 1 mM sodium ascorbate, and N2 was bubbled into the solution for 10–15 min prior to photoelectrochemical measurements. A Keithley 2400 multimeter and a PGSTAT100 Autolab potentiostat (when bias voltage was applied) were utilized. A collimated light beam from a 350 W xenon lamp was used for the illumination. When recording a photoaction spectrum, a monochromator was introduced into the path of the excitation beam for selecting the required wavelengths. All measurements were done after subtracting the stable dark current. When white light was used, a 360 nm cut-off filter was used. The IPCE efficiency, defined as the number of electrons collected per incident photon, was evaluated from short circuit photocurrent measurements at different wavelengths versus the photocurrent measured using a photodiode (from Coherent Deutschland GmbH model Fieldmax II).
For the AFM investigations, a Digital Instruments (Veeco) Nanoscope IIIa (Tapping Mode) with Veeco RTESP5 Tips was used.
Results and discussion
Suspensions of SWCNT pyrene−, SWCNT pyrene+ and films of ITO/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene− and ITO/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+ have been extensively characterized in previous contributions.13b,16

Fluorescence spectroscopy measurements of 1 and 2 in water demonstrate their good dispersability in aqueous solution—Fig. 1. In both cases, a fluorescence pattern evolves that is the mirror image of the ground state absorption with quantum yields of 0.20 and 0.22 for (1 I) and (Na 2) respectively.
 Fig. 1  
Fluorescence spectra in aqueous solutions of—upper part—1 that was excited at 500 nm where OD was 0.1 and of—lower part—2 that was excited at 400 nm where OD was 0.1. 
In the initial phase of the ITO substrate modification, a monolayer of PDDA polycation is adsorbed on the substrate surfaces—either quartz slides, silicon wafers, or ITO electrodes. The resulting hydrophilic and positively charged surfaces promote the deposition of PSS polyanions, bearing sulfonic acid functionalities, to yield ITO/PDDA/PSS templates. ITO/PDDA and ITO/PDDA/PSS slides are immersed in SWCNT pyrene− and SWCNT pyrene+ suspensions, respectively. After rinsing and drying, these slides were, respectively, immersed in aqueous solutions of 1 and 2. After rinsing and drying, ITO/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene−/1 and ITO/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2 slides were obtained.
In the absorption spectra of these transparent films—Fig. 2—the maximum at 556 nm and the shoulder at 402 nm are due to 1 and 2, respectively, and a set of sharp peaks between 300 and 370 nm are due to the pyrene units, in excellent agreement with those transitions seen in solution. In contrast, the van Hove singularities that arise from SWCNT in the 300 to 800 nm range are masked by the stronger absorptions of 1 and 2.15,16
 Fig. 2  
Absorption spectra of—upper part—ITO/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene−/1 and of—lower part—ITO/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2. 
The morphology of the films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The images were obtained directly from samples that were deposited by layer-by-layer deposition. Fig. 3 illustrates the AFM photographs obtained with Si/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene−/1 visualized SWCNT. In fact, thin bundles of SWCNT were observed in the scanned areas. More importantly, SWCNT appeared to be well dispersed throughout the surface and well distributed and/or embedded within the layer.

Conversely, AFM images that were gathered for Si/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2 reveal the presence of a soft film. In order to assess if the SWCNT layer was completely covered by a layer of 2, AFM images of Si/PDDA/2 and Si/2—see Fig. 4—were acquired as control experiments. These indeed confirmed that 2 formed films with the same characteristics when compared to those observed for Si/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2 and thus corroborate the SWCNT coverage.

Photoaction spectra, as depicted in Fig. 5, clearly identify the PT as the major photoactive species and match the absorption spectra. In particular, the visible regions, with absorptions that are centered around 550 nm (1) and 437 nm (2), correlate well with the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 2. The monochromatic IPCE maxima values for 1 and 2 are 1.40% and 1.39%, respectively. From our experiments we derive the following photocurrent mechanism: photoexcitation of PT is followed by rapid interaction with SWCNT leading to a sequential electron transfer to SWCNT and finally to ITO. Ascorbate, on the other hand, helps to regenerate the PT ground states.
 Fig. 5  Photoaction spectra of—upper part—a single ITO/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene−/1 stack and of—lower part—a single ITO/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2 stack. Experimental conditions: 0.1 M Na3PO4, 1 mM sodium ascorbate, N2-purged, no electrochemical bias. 
Additional proof for the proposed mechanism came from current–voltage characteristics, in which we probed ITO/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene−/1 and ITO/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2cells in a potential range between −0.5 V and +0.5 V. Fig. 6 exemplifies the behavior for these cells. Under open circuit voltage (VOC) conditions the acceptor level of SWCNT is in equilibrium with the conducting band of ITO and the electron flow is blocked. From this point the photocurrent increases systematically towards positive potentials. Increased charge separation and facilitated transport of charge carriers under positive bias are responsible for the enhanced photocurrent generation.

From a comparison of these last results, the very similar VOC, that is, −0.46 V (ITO/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene−/1) and −0.44 V (ITO/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2) confirm that the functional groups do not influence the orbital energies of PT. Despite that, ITO/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene−/1 revealed higher ISC values (2.43 µA) than ITO/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2 (1.69 µA).
Sequential repetition of SWCNT pyrene− and 1 or SWCNT pyrene+ and 2 deposition enabled the systematic construction of sandwich multistacks. Again, absorption spectroscopy was used to monitor the stepwise deposition procedure. From the absorption spectra of the deposited films on quartz—Fig. 7—repeatable absorption patterns are deduced. Important are the discernable SWCNT van Hove singularities that extend all the way to 2000 nm.
 Fig. 7  
Absorption spectra of—upper part—quartz/PDDA/(SWCNT pyrene−/1)n multistacks and of—lower part—quartz/PDDA/PSS/(SWCNT pyrene+/2)n multistacks. In both cases the absorption is increasing with increasing number of stacks. 
Interestingly, the photocurrents increased notably with increasing (SWCNT pyrene−/1)n and (SWCNT pyrene+/2)n multistacks—see Fig. 8. This observation can be rationalized on the grounds of higher absorption cross-sections at higher coverage. After transforming the photocurrents into monochromatic IPCE, we obtained maxima as high as 8.2 and 4.3% for SWCNT pyrene−/1 and SWCNT pyrene+/2, respectively.

The I–V characteristics of (SWCNT pyrene−/1)8 and (SWCNT pyrene+/2)8 reveal similar VOC values when compared with the corresponding monostacks, that is, SWCNT pyrene−/1 and SWCNT pyrene+/2 (Fig. 9). Notable, however, is that the ISC values increase five-fold, which leads consequently to the higher IPCEs. Table 1 also lists the fill factors (FF) and the power conversion efficiencies (η, %).

In line with the absorption spectra, the dominant absorption of 2 is blue shifted relative to that of 1. Moreover, less efficient stacking leads, especially in the case of the SWCNT van Hove singularities, to weaker overall absorptions. It is likely that these effects are responsible for the poorer light harvesting/device performance of 2.
Conclusions
To summarize, we have investigated the optical, microscopic and spectroelectrochemical properties of mono and multistacks of SWCNT and PT polyelectrolyte containing sulfonate (1) and ammonium (2) side groups, assembled in the form of thin films by means of the LbL technique. To this end, 1 revealed higher solar conversion efficiency. At present, a limitation of the donor materials 1 and 2 is their narrow absorption band, which restricts photovoltaic performance. Such a problem might be overcome by introducing other functional groups into the backbone or side chain to improve the ability of harvesting solar energy. In fact, by broadening the absorption bands higher energy conversion efficiencies are expected. Separation of metallic nanotubes and post-deposition treatments are also expected to improve the efficiency and in particular the fill factor of the cell.

 	Scheme 1  Chemical structures of poly{trimethyl-[7-(3-thienylsulfanyl)heptyl]ammonium iodide-co-thiophene} (1), (sodium poly[2-(3-thienyl)-ethoxy-4-butyl-butylsulfonate] (2), SWCNT functionalized with 1-pyrenebutyric acid (SWCNT pyrene−) and SWCNT functionalized with (1-(trimethylammonium acetyl)pyrene (SWCNT pyrene+).	 

 	Fig. 1  
Fluorescence spectra in aqueous solutions of—upper part—1 that was excited at 500 nm where OD was 0.1 and of—lower part—2 that was excited at 400 nm where OD was 0.1.	 

 	Fig. 2  
Absorption spectra of—upper part—ITO/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene−/1 and of—lower part—ITO/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2.	 

 	Fig. 3  
          AFM images of—upper part—Si/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene−/1 and of—lower part—Si/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2.	 

 	Fig. 4  
          AFM images of—upper part—Si/PDDA/2 and of—lower part—Si/2.	 

 	Fig. 5  Photoaction spectra of—upper part—a single ITO/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene−/1 stack and of—lower part—a single ITO/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2 stack. Experimental conditions: 0.1 M Na3PO4, 1 mM sodium ascorbate, N2-purged, no electrochemical bias.	 

 	Fig. 6  
I–V characteristics (dashed line under illumination, solid line in the dark) of—upper part—a single ITO/PDDA/SWCNT pyrene−/1 stack and of—lower part—a single ITO/PDDA/PSS/SWCNT pyrene+/2 stack. Experimental conditions: white light illumination, 0.1 M Na3PO4, 1 mM sodium ascorbate, N2-purged.	 

 	Fig. 7  
Absorption spectra of—upper part—quartz/PDDA/(SWCNT pyrene−/1)n multistacks and of—lower part—quartz/PDDA/PSS/(SWCNT pyrene+/2)n multistacks. In both cases the absorption is increasing with increasing number of stacks.	 

 	Fig. 8  Photocurrent dependence for—upper part—ITO/PDDA/(SWCNT pyrene−/1)n multistacks and for—lower part—ITO/PDDA/PSS/(SWCNT pyrene+/2)n multistacks.	 

 	Fig. 9  
I–V characteristics (dashed line under illumination, solid line in the dark) of—upper part—ITO/PDDA/(SWCNT pyrene−/1)8 multistacks and of—lower part—ITO/PDDA/PSS/(SWCNT pyrene+/2)8 multistacks. Experimental conditions: 0.1 M Na3PO4, 1 mM sodium ascorbate, N2-purged.	 

ITO/PDDA/(SWCNT pyrene−/1)8	−0.44	12.2	0.15	8.21 × 10−4
ITO/PDDA/PSS/(SWCNT pyrene+/2)8	−0.42	8.46	0.16	5.83 × 10−4
