    , Accepted 7th April 2021First published on 7th April 2021AbstractAs an efficient green water disinfection technology, photothermal synergy sterilization has been paid more attention in recent years with its immeasurable advantages. The development of photocatalysts for efficient sterilization is currently an urgent need. In this manuscript, pure Ti3C2Tx is first studied as a photothermal synergy sterilization material and shows an excellent sterilization effect. The sterilization rate of Escherichia coli (E. coli) reaches 99.9% under visible infrared (vis-IR) light for 40 minutes. The peeling of the Al layer from Ti3AlC2 is the fundamental reason for improving the photothermal conversion ability, and photogenerated free radicals have also proved to be improved. The dilution spreading plate method, enzyme activity test, and leakage of cell contents confirmed the complete death of bacteria. Two aspects, photogenerated free radicals and photothermal synergy, were carried to illuminate the mechanism.

Environmental significance
As an efficient and green water disinfection technology, the photothermal synergy sterilization was valued in recent years with immeasurable advantages. The development of photocatalysts for efficient sterilization is currently an urgent need. Ti3C2Tx as a representative of MXene, is a good application prospect in electrocatalysis, energy storage, water treatment and other fields. Recently, it was found that pure Ti3C2Tx also has light absorption and photogenerated radicals. Here, we proved that pure Ti3C2Tx is first studied as a photothermal synergy sterilization material, and shows an excellent sterilization effect.

1. Introduction
The high adaptability and reproduction rate of bacteria pose a serious threat to our living environment, especially to water resources.1,2 WHO statistics show that diseases caused by bacterial infections account for about one-third of global mortality.3 Traditional sterilization methods have the advantage of low cost. Still, environmental hazards and toxic substances produced from the process cannot be ignored.4,5 Therefore, it is a crucial problem to find new antibacterial technology with high efficiency, stability, and low cost.6 Photocatalysis technology is gradually flourishing in the exploration of new sterilization technology. This technology began in the 1990s when Agrawal et al. studied TiO2 as a photocatalytic sterilizer.7 Later on, a series of photocatalytic sterilizing materials with excellent performance, such as ZnO, CdS, CeO2, WO3, and BiVO4, were developed.8–14 Photothermal synergistic sterilization technology further improves the efficiency of photocatalytic sterilization. Photothermal materials partly convert light energy into heat energy, cooperating with photocatalytic active substances to inactivate bacteria.13,14
At present, materials with photothermal sterilization include gold nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles, transition metal sulfur compounds, and other nanomaterials.15–18 Killing bacteria by enhancing the photothermal effect of materials has been reported in the latest literature.19–21 MXene is a carbide/carbonitride two-dimensional material discovered in recent years. Their excellent conductivity, hydrophilicity, and stability have attracted many researchers to explore.22,23 Ti3C2Tx as a representative of MXene, is a good application prospect in electrocatalysis, energy storage, water treatment, and other fields.24–26 Although Ti3C2Tx has a similar structure to graphene, much more active groups were found in the surface of Ti3C2Tx than that of graphene oxide (GO), which contributes to its excellent separation performance in high-valent cations.24 Yury Gogotsi et al. has confirmed the bacteriostatic properties of Ti3C2Tx under dark conditions, but the efficiency is low.27,28 The bactericidal activity of most nanoparticles is related to three mechanisms: physical contact, photothermal effect, and reactive oxygen species (ROS).29,30 In addition, the photodynamic effect or the synergy of metal ions can also effectively kill bacteria, which is also studied in the latest literature.31–33
Herein, we firstly conduct sterilization experiments with pure Ti3C2Tx, and it shows an excellent efficiency of bacteriostatic action under vis-IR light illumination. The comparative experiment results indicate that Ti3C2Tx at 0.7 mg mL−1 delivers the best sterilization performance with an inactivation rate of 99% within 10 minutes. With the analysis of characterization and mechanism, it shows that photothermal synergistic sterilization action of Ti3C2Tx mainly depends on the following two aspects. Firstly, the redox reaction of ROS is of great significance in the photocatalytic sterilization process. Secondly, the photothermal synergistic effect driven by sunlight greatly enhances the sterilization effect.
2. Experimental methods

2.2 Preparation of Ti3C2Tx
A classic HF etching method was used to strip the Al layer. Typically, 2 g Ti3AlC2 was added to 30 mL HF (≥40%) under stirring and was kept for 24 h. Then, it was centrifuged (8000r, 2 min) and washed until neutral. It was finally dried for 12 h at 60 °C.
2.3 Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on Ultima IV, Japanese Science, at 25 °C with a 2θ rate of 2° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) of samples was determined by AXIS Supra, Shimadzu, Japan. Raman spectra were tested on a laser confocal Raman spectrometer (Thermo Scientific DXR). DRS was carried out using HITACHI, UH4150 for total reflection and diffuse measurements. SEM images were tested by Japan Electronics JSM-7500F emission scanning electron microscopy. TEM and HRTEM images, and element mappings were analyzed using a Tecnai G2 F30 field emission transmission electron microscope (Voltage 300KV). EDS spectra were determined by American EDAX GENESIS. ESR were tested on JEOL JESFA200 (type of spectrometer: Japan Electronics (JEOL) JES FA200; sweep time: 1 min; center filed: 323.1 mT; sweep width: ±5 × 1 Mt; micro wave frequency: 9054.638 MHz; micro wave power: 2.0 mW).
2.4 Sterilization experiments
The cultivation method of bacteria is the same as that in the previous literature.12 The xenon lamp intensity was 3500 W m−2 (Fig. S1†). The bacterial concentration was calculated by a dilution plate method: each concentration was diluted by 1/10, c = a × 10(n + 1), where c was the concentration of bacterial liquid, n was the number of dilution times, and a was the number of bacterial colonies on the plate. The pseudo-first-order kinetics was used to compare the activities of photocatalysis, thermal catalysis, and photothermal synergistic catalysis more intuitively. Use formula ln(C/C0) = −kt, to calculate the sterilization rate. k is regarded as the standard of the sterilization rate (C0: the residual concentration; C: the final concentration).
2.5 Photothermal effects
To explore the photothermal conversion capability of materials, a thermal imager was used to record the temperature changes of powder materials and aqueous solution after illumination.
2.6 Fluorescence spectroscopy
The mixed solution of Ti3C2Tx and E. coli was stained with a LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit (L7012, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The operation process is guided by the instructions. The solution was kept in the dark for 15 minutes; 5 μL solution was transferred to slide. Then a laser confocal microscope (Japanese Nikon A1R+) was used for observation.
2.7 Enzyme activity and cell content test
The Catalase Assay kit was used to determine CAT (Catalase) activity. TTC (triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) content was determined and analyzed to assess cellular respiration activity. The nucleic acid concentration is measured using a spectrophotometer. The MDA (malondialdehyde) concentration can be calculated using a standard curve. The SOD (superoxide dismutase) activity was measured using a kit. Detailed steps are provided by supporting materials. The detailed information is the same as the previous document.12
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure of Ti3C2Tx
XRD is used to characterize the structure and morphology of the materials (Fig. 1a). The peaks of Ti3AlC2 show strong intensities and have good crystallinity (JCPDS No. 52-0875). For Ti3AlC2, the 2θ rates of 9.5°, 19° and 39° are attributed to (002), (004) and (104) planes, respectively.34 After HF etching, the 39° peak disappeared, and the (002) and (004) peaks both shifted to low angles, which is due to the Al layer peeling off.35 Raman and XPS spectra also proved the fact that the Al layer is stripped. The Raman spectra of Ti3C2Tx and Ti3AlC2 show consistent results as previously reported. The peaks at 209, 383, and 600 cm−1 correspond to the vibration mode of Ti–C.36 The nitrogen isothermal adsorption and desorption curves show that the BET of the material after the Al layer is etched increased by more than three times (Fig. 1c). The pore size distribution affects the properties of the material. The reactive sites of the material are proportional to the specific surface area (Fig. S1†). XPS elucidates the surface chemistry of the sample. The XPS full spectrum shows that Ti3C2Tx mainly consists of four elements: O, C, Ti, and F (Fig. 1d). The XPS spectra of Ti3C2Tx are shown in Fig. 1e and f, respectively. Ti 2p has five different bonding situations (Fig. 1f). Ti–C 2p3/2, Ti(II) 2p3/2, and Ti–C 2p3/2 are located at 455.0, 455.9 and 458.1 eV, respectively. Ti–C 2P1/2, Ti(II) 2P1/2 and Ti–C 2P1/2 consist of peaks at 461.2, 461.4, 463 eV.37,38 The C 1s cores located at 281.8, 282.3, 284.8, 286.2, and 288.1 eV, correspond to C–Ti, Ti–C–O, C–C, C–O, and O–CO bonds, respectively.

SEM images and TEM images reveal morphologies of Ti3C2Tx and Ti3AlC2. Fig. 2a and d show the SEM images before and after the etching. The peeling of the Al layer turns a compact layered structure into an accordion shape (Fig. S2†). The surface of Ti3C2Tx has wrinkles and becomes relatively rough, making it easier to adsorb bacteria. It can be seen from the HRTEM images (Fig. 2b and S3†) that the lattice fringe of Ti3AlC2 is a regular hexagonal shape, and the corresponding crystal faces are (0110), (1010), and (1100).39 As shown in Fig. 2e, the crystal lattice with a width of 0.98 nm belongs to the (002) plane of Ti3C2Tx MXene, which is the same as that in the literature.40 EDS was used to analyze the element composition of the material before and after etching. Ti3AlC2 is mainly composed of C, Ti, O, and Al elements (Fig. 2c), which is consistent with the XPS spectrum (Fig. 1a). Compared with Ti3AlC2, the Al peak in the energy spectrum of Ti3AlC2 disappeared, which verified the successful peeling of the Al layer (Fig. 2f). Besides, the EDX element mappings show that the C and Ti elements are evenly distributed (Fig. 2g–i).

3.2 Photothermal conversion
DRS shows the light absorption properties of materials (Fig. 3a). With the peeling of the Al layer, the material changes from gray to black, contributing to the enhancement of light absorption (Fig. 3b). After etching the Al layer, the light absorption in the vis-IR part is enhanced, which is an important condition for photothermal sterilization. Compared with Ti3AlC2, the enhanced absorbance of Ti3C2Tx in the visible light region and infrared range contributed to its good photothermal conversion ability.

Additionally, to study the photothermal conversion capability of materials more directly, an IR thermo camera was used to record the temperature changes of materials in both powder form and solution. To obtain vis-IR light, a xenon lamp (Perfectlight, PLS-SXE300D) with a full-spectrum reflector and a 400 nm cut-off filter acted as the light source (3500 W m−2) (Fig. S4†). As shown in Fig. 4, the shade of color in the image represents the temperature levels – the bluer, the lower; the oranger, the higher, just as shown in the scale on the right side of the images. The powder material becomes stable after being irradiated with visible light and infrared light for 200 s, and the temperature of Ti3C2Tx is 10 °C higher than that of Ti3AlC2 (Fig. 4a–c). This is a piece of strong evidence that Al layer stripping increases the photothermal conversion capacity. The hydrophilicity of Ti3C2Tx is the reason for the excellent dispersion in the aqueous solution.41 After the sunlight irradiating, the light energy is converted into heat energy, and the temperature increases. The rising rate of solution temperature decreases with time (Fig. 4d–f).

3.3 Antibacterial assays
We compared the experimental conditions by controlling the concentration, material, light source, etc. to explore the influence of different factors on the sterilization effect. The sterilization light source is vis-IR light (3500 W m−2). The results are shown in Fig. 3. E. coli grows naturally in the dark without a catalyst (25 °C) being used as a blank control. Ti3C2Tx has weak sterilization activity under dark conditions. This is due to the physical contact between bacteria and materials. After a period of reaction, the cells are injured, and some bacteria died. This also indicates that Ti3C2Tx is non-toxic. Firstly, the sterilization effect of different concentrations of 0–1 mg mL−1 Ti3C2Tx is explored (Fig. 5a), and the best sterilization concentration is 0.7 mg mL−1. It can be seen that the sterilization effect tends to be stable after 40 minutes, and the sterilization effect of 0.7 mg mL−1 Ti3C2Tx is close to 100%, while the corresponding cell concentration dropped from log107.12 to 0 with the temperature up to 46.5 °C (Fig. 5b). Fig. S5† shows the growth photos of the bacterial solution in the medium after sterilization with different concentrations of Ti3C2Tx (the dilution ratio is 10−2). Under the same conditions, after 40 min of Ti3AlC2 treatment, the cell concentration is almost unchanged. This means that we successfully strip the Al layer to change the physical and chemical properties of the material, thus exhibiting excellent photothermal sterilization performance (Fig. 5c). The bacterial survival rate is an important indicator of the sterilization performance of materials. Fig. 5d shows that the survival rate of the bacterial solution treated with Ti3C2Tx is only 1% within 10 minutes, while there is about 90% in the Ti3AlC2 solution. We further compare individual photocatalysis, thermal catalysis and photothermal synergistic catalysis sterilization to explore the influence of different factors on the growth of bacteria. The results are shown in Fig. 5e. With the existence of a catalyst and vis-IR light irradiation, at the same time the temperature rises from 25 °C to 46 °C, the bacteria concentration is reduced by about log107 under the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and thermal catalysis. To determine the effect of photocatalytic sterilization, the temperature was maintained at 25 °C with a low-temperature thermostat to exclude the influence of the thermal effect. The bacteria decreased by about log103 in the solution, which manifests that bactericidal strength is limited by a photocatalytic factor. Similar to the photocatalysis experiment, the sterilization effect of thermal catalysis was carried out with a controlled temperature rise rate using a cryogenic thermostat, and the other experiment's conditions were consistent with above-mentioned ones. The activity of thermal catalysis is also limited, and its performance is almost the same as that of photocatalysis. The pseudo-first-order kinetics in Fig. 5f used to compare the activities of photocatalysis, thermal catalysis, and photothermal synergistic catalysis more intuitively. The k (min−1) value of the photothermal synergistic condition is the highest (0.48). The sterilization rate of photocatalysis (k = 0.12) is just about 1/4 of the synergy of light and heat. This result confirms the powerful synergy, achieving 1 + 1 > 2. Moreover, the cyclic sterilization experiment shows that Ti3C2Tx has good photocatalytic stability (Fig. S6†). The sterilization rate for the first time is as high as 99.9%. There has a slight decrease in the following cycles, but it also reached more than 95% each time. And the XRD patterns of Ti3C2Tx before and after cyclic sterilization experiment confirm the stable structure (Fig. S7†). In order to compare it to traditional sterilization methods, the improved Chick–Watson inactivation model was used to simulate the inactivation profile of Ti3C2Tx (Fig. S8†). It can be found that the log removal credit of sterilization (achieving 2log E. coli inactivation) was initially found to be 5.4 mg min mL−1.

3.4 The bacterial inactivation process
To further reveal the inactivation process of bacteria, it is necessary to analyze the leakage of cell contents, enzyme activity, ATP, etc.
To observe the survival of the cells, a laser confocal microscope (Fig. 6) was used. Two types of stains were carried out to stain E. coli. Green fluorescence can stain both live and dead cells, while red fluorescence can only stain dead cells. The bacteria that have not been treated with photothermal experiments are all green (Fig. 6a), indicating that they are all living bacteria with intact cell membranes. With the prolongation of the treatment time, the color of fluorescence gradually changes to yellow (this is the effect of green and red fluorescence staking) (Fig. 6b–d), indicating that a part of the bacterial cell membrane is broken. Finally, the red fluorescence takes the main force after 40 min (Fig. 6e). This result is consistent with the colony growth of E. coli in the plate.

(g) The content of CAT and SOD in the bacterial solution. (h) Content of DNA and RNA in the solution. (i) Production of MDA. (j) TTC concentration during cell respiration. 
The destruction of bacteria by antibacterial agents mainly reflected in the interaction with the cell membrane, impairing the essential functions of bacteria, and the result is the thorough destruction of the cell.42–44 The breakage of the cell membrane will cause the leakage of K+, protein, DNA, RNA, and other components in the cell, which will eventually lead to the complete death of the bacteria. Therefore, it is indeed necessary to prove the death of E. coli by examining the activities of several essential enzymes and testing the substance content.
As the most direct energy source in the organism, ATP guarantees the energy supply for cell life activities. Fig. 6f shows that after adding Ti3C2Tx to the bacterial solution, the ATP content dropped from the initial 0.64log ATP pmol per cell to 0 after 40 minutes. The energy metabolism system of bacteria is damaged and cannot maintain the normal operation of various cell functions. This is completely consistent with the previous experimental results. The photo-generated free radicals produced during the photocatalytic sterilization process oxidize the cell membrane and cause damage to the cell membrane. Therefore, the content of antioxidant enzymes will change during the sterilization process. SOD (superoxide dismutase) and CAT (catalase) can convert ˙O2− and H2O2 into O2 and H2O, respectively.45 Therefore, the two main antioxidant enzymes, CAT and SOD, were tested. From Fig. 6g, we can see that the antioxidant enzyme content continues to increase in the first 20 minutes of the reaction. This is caused by the stress response of the cells. As the treatment time went on, cell function was impaired, some cells died, and enzyme activity decreased. DNA and RNA leaked out along with the lysis of cell membranes, and the bacterial genetic system was destroyed, so the content of nucleic acid in the solution gradually increases. In the later stage, the nucleic acid decreased due to the degradation in the solution (Fig. 6h). The oxidation of the cell membrane during the inactivation of bacteria has been confirmed.46,47 The cell membrane is composed of lipid bilayers and unsaturated fatty acids. MDA (malondialdehyde) is the most widely used lipid peroxidation biomarker. According to the previous report, the steady growth of MDA is related to cell inactivation.47Fig. 6i shows that the MDA content keeps increasing during the Ti3C2Tx treatment of E. coli. The final result of membrane peroxidation is the change of membrane permeability and the destruction of cell membrane integrity, which will lead to the release of cell contents and the inhibition of respiration.46,48 In the process of bacterial respiration, the cytochrome system can oxidize the tetrazolium dye, such as TTC.49 Therefore, the decrease in TTC is used to assess the respiratory activity of cells. Fig. 6j shows that the respiratory activity of Escherichia coli is getting weaker and weaker with the extension of the sterilant addition time. From the above research results, we can conclude that Ti3C2Tx has excellent inactivation performance of E. coli as a disinfectant.
3.5 Mechanism
The photothermal synergistic sterilization mechanism of Ti3C2Tx was proved to be corrected by the detection results of photogenerated ˙O2− and ˙OH (Fig. 7). Effective sterilization by photocatalysis depends on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).29 The interaction of ROS with microorganisms can cause cell inactivation and death, for example, by reacting with functional components in the microbial cell envelope.50 In the process of photocatalysis, ROS first destroys the cell wall and decomposes the glycated lipid layer of the cell wall. This will cause the peptidoglycan layer to be attacked, lipid membrane peroxidation, and protein-membrane oxidation. Then the potassium ions leak from the bacterial cells, affecting the viability of the cells eventually leading to the loss of critical cell functions and cell death.51,52 There were no free radical signals of both Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2Tx, indicating that the generation of free radicals is caused by light illumination. The signal of DMPO–˙O2− for Ti3C2Tx increased with the prolongation of the illumination time, while Ti3AlC2 has a delicate signal compared with Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 7a). The ˙OH test also showed similar results (Fig. 7b). In conclusion, ˙O2− and ˙OH are the primary oxygen active species that work during the reaction process.

The comparative experiments of photocatalysis, thermal catalysis and photothermal synergistic catalysis confirmed that thermal catalysis has a certain effect on the sterilization process. The first-order kinetics indicates that the synergistic effect of light and thermal catalysis makes the bactericidal effect achieve excellent results of 1 + 1 > 2.
In summary, pure 2D Ti3C2Tx has excellent light-to-heat conversion ability. We have confirmed the efficient light–heat synergistic sterilization effect of Ti3C2Tx from many aspects. The sterilization effect of Ti3C2Tx is mainly achieved through the following two factors. The oxidation effect of photo-generated free radicals, and the photothermal synergy significantly improve the sterilization effect. The photothermal synergy sterilization mechanism of Ti3C2Tx is shown in Scheme 1.

Environmental significance
As an efficient and green water disinfection technology, the photothermal synergy sterilization was valued in recent years with immeasurable advantages. The development of photocatalysts for efficient sterilization is currently an urgent need. Ti3C2Tx as a representative of MXene, is a good application prospect in electrocatalysis, energy storage, water treatment and other fields. Recently, it was found that pure Ti3C2Tx also has light absorption and photogenerated radicals. Here, we proved that pure Ti3C2Tx is first studied as a photothermal synergy sterilization material, and shows an excellent sterilization effect.
