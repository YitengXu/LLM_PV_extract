    , Accepted 2nd February 2021First published on 4th February 2021AbstractPoly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is regarded as one of the most promising polymer donors for organic solar cells (OSCs) owing to its own merits of low-cost and controllable synthesis, and large-area and roll-to-roll printing device fabrication. However, the mutual restriction and imbalance of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) greatly limits further breakthrough of power conversion efficiency (PCE) for P3HT-based OSCs. Herein, a new A-π-D-π-A type acceptor (JC14) with the same conjugated skeleton as that of our previous acceptor (JC2) has been designed through removing an electron-withdrawing ester group from a thiophene-fused benzotriazole (BTAZT) unit as a “π-bridge”. In comparison, JC14 retains the BTAZT unit that can still stabilize the quinoid structure of the conjugated backbone to favor JSC. Remarkably, the fine structural regulation of the “π-bridge” significantly raises the LUMO energy level of JC14, which is more conducive to the enhancement of VOC. Thus, the P3HT:JC14-based OSC device achieves very balanced and high JSC (JSC = 16.04 mA cm−2) and VOC (VOC = 0.759 V) that leads to a high PCE of 7.72%, while the P3HT:JC2-based device shows a relatively lower PCE of 6.12% with JSC of 14.53 mA cm−2 and VOC of 0.685 V.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) have attracted more and more attention due to their advantages such as low cost, light weight, abundant raw materials, solution processability and large-area fabrication.1–5 Through the rational molecular design of active layer materials and fine control of interface engineering as well as the optimization of device fabrication, BHJ-OSCs have made rapid progress in recent years.6–17 In the past, most attention focused on fullerene and its derivative based BHJ-OSCs, and the PCEs had reached 11%.18–20 However, some drawbacks of fullerene acceptors such as difficult preparation and purification, difficult molecular modification to regulate the energy levels and very weak absorbance in the visible region had limited the improvement of photovoltaic performances. To overcome the disadvantages of fullerene based OSCs, Zhan's group21–24 developed fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) with a fused ring as the central core flanked with strong electron-withdrawing groups, which significantly improved the performances of OSCs. So far, various excellent NFAs have been designed and developed.25–35 Based on the adjustable energy levels, and broad and strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared region, NFA based BHJ-OSCs have achieved over 17% efficiency in single-junction and tandem devices.36–40
For practical application of OSCs, except the excellent photovoltaic performances, some other factors such as low cost and easy device fabrication for large-area and roll-to-roll manufacturing technology should also be considered. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is regarded as one of the most promising donor materials for OSCs for future industrial application, because it shows some unparalleled advantages of simple and controllable synthesis, low cost for large-scale production, and good repeatability in each batch for device parameters over some other classic polymers.41–43 For instance, classic polymer donors like PM6 show a strong batch variability and the PCE can thus change from 15% to 5% in PM6:Y6 based OSC devices.44 The main problem is still how to improve the device efficiency of P3HT-based OSCs. For fullerene acceptors, the efficiencies of P3HT-based OSCs had been limited to a low level, such as less than 5% for phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) based binary devices and 7.4% for indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA) based binary devices.45,46 The reasons for this limitation are mainly the narrow absorption band (350–650 nm) and a relatively high HOMO energy level (ca. −5.0 eV) of P3HT, which provide a poor match with fullerene acceptors. Fortunately, the recent rapid development of NFAs has completely changed this situation. Benefiting from the finely adjustable absorption properties and energy levels of some NFAs, which provide a good match with P3HT, the PCEs of the corresponding P3HT-based OSCs were dramatically improved, exceeding 8%.47,48
Through reviewing the reported studies on P3HT-based OSCs, it has been found that there are two main kinds of NFA including A–D–A and A-π-D-π-A type structures widely applied in P3HT-based OSCs. Different from A–D–A type NFAs, A-π-D-π-A type NFAs have a variable “π-bridge” that endows them with more structural blocks to regulate the properties and the structural compatibility in order to achieve a better match with donor materials. For example, some electron-deficient aromatic units such as benzothiadiazole (BT), benzotriazole (BTAZ) and their derivatives have been chosen as a “π-bridge” in A-π-D-π-A type NFAs to achieve relatively high performances for P3HT-based OSCs.49–52 However, seldom did P3HT-based OSCs show excellent short circuit current density (JSC), even though quite a lot of NFAs showed good complementary absorption to P3HT. Only two samples48,53 exhibited relatively high JSC exceeding 14 mA cm−2 among the reported P3HT-based OSCs (shown in Fig. 1a), so one of the main goals of designing new NFAs is to improve the JSC. At the same time, another purpose for designing NFAs is to lift the LUMO energy level to match well with the HOMO energy level of P3HT, so as to enhance VOC for achieving satisfactory cell performances.50 Nevertheless, the VOC and JSC values generally show an inverse relationship, in which an increase of VOC often leads to a sharp decrease of JSC.54 Therefore, the product of VOC and JSC, as an important parameter to evaluate their balance, seldom exceeds 10 mW cm−2 as shown in Fig. 1b. Obviously, the key factor to achieve excellent performances is to simultaneously obtain high and balanced VOC and JSC values for the P3HT-based OSCs.
 Fig. 1  The summary of (a) PCE and JSC and (b) JSC × VOC of P3HT-based OSC devices from reported results. 
In our previous work, a series of “A-π-D-π-A” type NFAs were designed.55–59 It has been proven that the introduction of a thiophene-fused benzothiadiazole (BTT) or thiophene-fused benzotriazole (BTAZT) unit as a “π-bridge” in “A-π-D-π-A” NFAs can significantly increase the JSC of the corresponding OSCs,55–57 which stems from the fact that the fusion of a thiophene ring onto a BT or BTAZ unit not only extends the π-electron delocalization, but also stabilizes the quinoid configuration of the conjugated backbone to further strengthen the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect.60 It is remarkable that a BTAZT-based A-π-D-π-A type NFA (JC2) was applied for P3HT-based OSCs to achieve a high JSC of nearly 14 mA cm−2 with a PCE of 6.24%.56 However, the presence of a strong electron-withdrawing ester group at the fused thiophene ring in the BTAZT unit lowered the LUMO energy level of JC2, which has a negative impact on VOC. Considering such an unfavourable structural factor for VOC, we wish to tune the structure of JC2 to lift the LUMO energy level, so as to enhance VOC in the case of maintaining high JSC. Generally, the removal of an electron-withdrawing group from the main-chain is an effective strategy to raise the LUMO energy level. At the same time, if the conjugated skeleton of the A-π-D-π-A type NFA remains unchanged, it can be expected that the high JSC value will be maintained for the corresponding P3HT-based OSCs. Along these lines, a new “A-π-D-π-A” type NFA (namely JC14) has been designed through the structural regulation of a “π-bridge” in JC2 as shown in Fig. 2. As expected, the removal of a strong electron-withdrawing ester group from the BTAZT unit in JC2 indeed significantly lifts the LUMO level of JC14, thus enhancing the VOC. Although the absence of an ester group in the BTAZT unit partially weakens the ICT effect which results in a slight blue-shift of absorption, JC14 still shows good complementary absorption to P3HT, thus maintaining a high JSC. Therefore, very balanced JSC and VOC is obtained for the P3HT:JC14-based device. Its PCE reaches 7.72% with relatively high JSC and VOC (JSC = 16.04 mA cm−2 and VOC = 0.759 V), which significantly surpass those of the P3HT:JC2-based device with a PCE of 6.12%, JSC of 14.53 mA cm−2 and VOC of 0.685 V. It is worth mentioning that both the JSC value (16.04 mA cm−2) and VOC × JSC value (12.17 mW cm−2) for the JC14-based device are very competitive with those of all the P3HT-based OSCs as shown in Fig. 1b, which is consistent with the molecular design that maintains high JSC while enhancing VOC.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route to the ester-free thiophene-fused benzotriazole unit and JC14 is shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed experimental procedures are presented in the ESI.† To remove a carboxyl group from the fused-thiophene ring of the BTAZT unit, the hydrolysis of ester was firstly performed on compound 1 to produce a carboxyl group in compound 2, and then the thermal decarboxylation process was carried out to get the ester-free thiophene-fused aromatic heterocyclic compound 3. Next, bromination and acylation were carried out in sequence for 3, and the π-bridge was connected to the donor core by Stille coupling reaction. Finally, JC14 was obtained in high yield through the Knoevenagel condensation of compound 7 with 3-ethyl-2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodamine. The chemical structure was characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MALDI-TOF MS, and elemental analysis. JC14 shows good solubility in some common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, which is necessary for solution-processed OSC devices. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of JC14 was performed as shown in Fig. S1.† It can be seen that JC14 exhibits a good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) over 385 °C.

Opto-electronic properties based on experiments and theoretical calculations
The UV-vis absorption of JC2 and JC14 was studied and compared to understand the structure–absorption relationship. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, JC14 exhibits two distinct absorption bands, similar to those of JC2 in solution and in thin film. The short-wavelength absorption band corresponds to the localized π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone, and the long-wavelength absorption band is attributed to the ICT transition. It should be noted that the removal of an electron-withdrawing ester group from the BTAZT unit in JC2 partially attenuates the coplanarity of the conjugated backbone and ICT effect, which results in a slight blue-shift of ICT absorption and weak absorption coefficient of JC14 (see Fig. S2†). As can be seen, the maximum ICT absorption of JC14 locates at 657 nm, which has a blue-shift of 16 nm relative to JC2 with the maximum absorption at 673 nm in the solution. In the thin film, a larger blue-shift of 53 nm is observed for JC14 compared with JC2.

Moreover, in the thin film, both of them show more red-shifted and broadened absorption spectra than those in solution, indicating that there is stronger intermolecular interaction in thin film. The Eoptg of JC14 was estimated to be about 1.57 eV from the absorption edge in thin film, wider than that (1.48 eV) of JC2,56 which can also be attributed to the removal of an electron-withdrawing ester group from JC2 which weakens the ICT effect. In particular, although JC14 has a slightly blue-shifted absorption compared with JC2 in the thin film, it still shows complementary absorption to P3HT in the range of 300–800 nm (shown in Fig. 3b), implying that the P3HT:JC14 blend film could exhibit good light-harvesting efficiency in this region.
As mentioned, the main target of molecular design in this work is to raise the LUMO energy level for the new NFA to enhance the VOC of OSCs through the structural regulation of JC2. In order to verify the rationality of structural modification, the electrochemical properties of JC14 were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (shown in Fig. 3c), and the HOMO/LUMO levels are calculated from the onset redox potentials (summarized in Table 1).

As can be seen, JC14 exhibits significantly uplifted LUMO/HOMO energy levels (−5.41/−3.63 eV) relative to JC2 showing HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.48/−3.73 eV,56 which can be ascribed to the removal of a strong electron-withdrawing ester group from the BTAZT unit of JC2. This is in agreement with the fine structural regulation from JC2 to JC14. Moreover, the upshift of LUMO energy levels of JC14 could help the JC14-based device to achieve a higher VOC than that of the JC2-based device, which was confirmed by the following device measurements.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to optimize the molecular geometries and the frontier orbitals using the Gaussian09 program at the PBE0/def2SVP level with Grimme's D3BJ61 empirical dispersion correction, in which the long alkyl chain was replaced by a simplified methyl group. The optimized structures and the frontier orbitals of JC2 and JC14 are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, no torsion between the end-group and “π-bridge” is observed. However, the torsion angle of 20° between the BTAZT unit and the adjacent IDT core in JC14 is larger than that (17°) in JC2, indicating that the molecular coplanarity of JC14 is poorer than that of JC2. Obviously, the removal of an electron-withdrawing ester group at the fused thiophene ring of the BTAZT unit in JC14 weakens the rigidity of the conjugated backbone and the intramolecular charge transfer. Therefore, JC14 shows slightly blue-shifted ICT absorption and a weaker absorption coefficient compared with JC2, which is in good agreement with the experimental results as shown in Fig. 3 and S2.†

Due to their identical conjugated skeleton, JC2 and JC14 show a similar LUMO and HOMO, where the HOMO is delocalized along the whole conjugated backbone, and the LUMO mainly distributes on the “π-bridge” and partially extends to the IDT core and rhodamine end-capping group. However, the removal of an ester group significantly raises the HOMO and LUMO energy levels compared with JC2, which is consistent with the experimental data (in Table 1).
Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of JC14 as a new NFA (A) paired with the P3HT donor (D) was investigated by fabricating BHJ-OSC devices with the inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:NFA/MoO3/Ag, in which the D/A blend active layer was built by spin-coating from chloroform solution. To optimize the device performances, different fabrication treatments were screened such as thermal annealing (TA), ratio of donor and acceptor, different additives and solvents, etc. The detailed experimental process and corresponding data are summarized in Tables S1–S4.† Firstly, the as-cast P3HT:JC14-based device with a D/A ratio of 1:0.6 was fabricated to evaluate the device performances. It shows a very low PCE of 1.36% with VOC of 0.843 V, JSC of 4.84 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.33. Since the annealing process can effectively improve the performances of the P3HT-based device,62 different annealing temperatures were employed to improve the D/A blend morphology. As can be seen in Table S1,† the annealing process at different temperatures indeed exerts a positive impact on the PCEs. The best device performance is obtained with a PCE of 5.57% (VOC of 0.769 V, JSC of 12.44 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.58) after annealing at 120 °C for 5 min. In addition, some solvent additives were added to try to further improve the D/A blend morphology. Fortunately, the addition of 0.5% 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) can significantly improve the device performances, and the PCE value for the optimal P3HT:JC14-based device was dramatically enhanced to 7.72% with VOC of 0.759 V, JSC of 16.04 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.63. In contrast, the P3HT:JC2-based device only exhibited a PCE of about 6.12% with VOC of 0.685 V, JSC of 14.53 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.61 under the same measurement conditions, as summarized in Table 2. It is worth mentioning that the JSC value of 16.04 mA cm−2 for the P3HT:JC14-based device is the second highest JSC value among all the P3HT-based OSCs (shown in Fig. 1a). Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves. As can be seen, the optimal P3HT:JC14-based device achieved excellent comprehensive performances, which surpass those of the P3HT:JC2-based device in all three parameters. Remarkably, the VOC × JSC value, as an important parameter to evaluate the balance between JSC and VOC, reaches 12.17 mW cm−2 for the P3HT:JC14-based device, which is one of the highest values among all the P3HT-based OSCs (shown in Fig. 1b). Obviously, the enhancement of VOC can be ascribed to the uplifted LUMO energy level of JC14, which stems from the removal of an ester group from the BTAZT unit of JC2. The improvement of JSC can be attributed to the retention of the fused-thiophene ring at the BTAZT unit, which stabilizes the quinoid structure of the conjugated backbone, and the complementary absorption of JC14 and P3HT, which leads to good light-harvesting efficiency in the visible range. In addition, the photo-stability of the JC2-based and JC14-based devices was not significantly different, indicating that the removal of the ester group did not affect the stability of the corresponding device (as shown in Fig. S3†).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized P3HT:NFA devices are presented in Fig. 5b. Although JC14 shows a slightly blue-shifted absorption compared with JC2, its device also shows a wide photo-response range covering the whole visible region of 300–800 nm. Especially, the EQE maximum of the JC14-based device reaches 70% at 520 nm, which is larger than the 62% of the optimized JC2-based device at 520 nm. In addition, the JC14-based device shows EQE over 60% in the range of 430–740 nm, which is higher than that of the JC2-based device. This indicates that a more efficient photoelectron conversion process occurs for the JC14-based device. The calculated JSC values from integration of the EQE spectra of the optimized JC14 and JC2 devices are about 15.57 mA cm−2 and 13.83 mA cm−2, respectively, consistent with the J–V measurements within the margin of error (less than 5%), as summarized in Table 2.
The exciton dissociation and collection capacity of the optimized P3HT-based devices were investigated by measuring the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff).63 As shown in Fig. 5c, the calculated JSC/Jsat value of the optimized P3HT:JC14-based device reaches about 94.2, which is higher than that (91.6) of the optimized P3HT:JC2-based device. This suggests that more effective charge extraction exists in the JC14-based device, and also explains why the P3HT:JC14-based device exhibits higher JSC than the P3HT:JC2-based device. Meanwhile, the dependence of the light intensity (P) on photocurrent (JSC) was measured to investigate the degree of bimolecular recombination in the D/A blend of OSCs.64 This relationship is defined as JSC ∝ Pα, where the exponent α approaching 1 means that bimolecular recombination can be ignored and all free carriers are collected by electrodes completely. As shown in Fig. 5d, the exponent α values of the optimized P3HT:JC14 and P3HT:JC2 based devices are calculated to be about 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. The α values close to 1 indicate that there is little bimolecular recombination for both optimized devices. In addition, the dependence of VOC on incident light intensity (I) described by VOC ∝ nkT/qln(I) is shown in Fig. S4.† The slopes (n) for the JC2-based and JC14-based devices are 1.36 and 1.38 kT/q, respectively, which are clearly deviated from n = 1 (trap-free condition), suggesting the presence of some trap-assisted recombination in both devices.65,66
As is known, the carrier transport capacity can greatly affect the device performance such as JSC and FF, so the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the neat films and optimized D/A blend films were studied by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method to further investigate the effect of structure on the carrier transport capacity.67 As shown in Fig. S5,† the electron mobility of JC14 and JC2 in neat films is calculated to be 2.75 × 10−4 and 4.10 × 10−4, respectively. The difference of electron mobility between JC14 and JC2 may arise from the structural difference, where the removal of the electron-withdrawing ester group from the fused thiophene ring at the BZAT unit not only reduces the conjugated system with the adjacent aromatic heterocycle, but also weakens the molecular coplanarity and the ICT effect for JC14.68 As for the optimized blend films in Fig. S6,† the optimized P3HT:JC14 blend shows a μh of 7.49 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 4.55 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a very balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.65, while the P3HT:JC2-based blend shows a relatively poor μh of 5.55 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 2.49 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 2.23. The simultaneous increment of hole mobility and electron mobility may be attributed to the fact that JC14 has better intermolecular packing and continuous transmission channels constructed in the P3HT:JC14 blend film than that in the P3HT:JC2 blend film. In addition, the more balanced and higher charge mobility of the P3HT:JC14 blend film can also contribute to improving the JSC and FF values.
Morphology characterization
To analyze the effect of structural modification from JC2 to JC14 on the device performances, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to measure the morphologies of the optimized D/A blend films, and the corresponding images are shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  AFM height (left) and TEM images (right) of (a and b) P3HT:JC2 and (c and d) P3HT:JC14 active layers under the optimized conditions. 
As can be seen in Fig. 6a and c, the optimized P3HT/JC2 and P3HT:JC14 blend films have relatively rough surfaces with root mean square (RMS) values of 4.76 and 13.8 nm, respectively. In comparison, the higher RMS of the P3HT:JC14 blend film suggests that the miscibility of P3HT with JC14 is not as good as that with JC2, implying that the domain size of the blend film is increased from JC2 to JC14. Fig. 6b and d display the TEM images of the optimized D/A blend films. Consistent with the miscibility of P3HT with JC2 or JC14 reflected by AFM, no obvious phase separation is observed for the optimized P3HT:JC2 blend film, which only shows tiny nanocrystals throughout the blend film. However, the P3HT:JC14 blend film exhibits larger aggregation domains with clearer phase separation and interpenetrating networks, which is more favourable for the exciton dissociation and charge transport.
Based on the DFT calculations shown in Fig. 4, the introduction of an ester group into the BTAZT unit causes JC2 to show better molecular coplanarity than JC14, which is favourable for the intermolecular interaction, but the presence of an ester group also has a little steric effect that hinders the intermolecular self-aggregation, which enables it to have better miscibility with P3HT, so the P3HT:JC2 blend film shows well-proportioned aggregation domains with poor phase separation, which is unfavourable for the exciton dissociation and carrier transport. For JC14, the reduced steric effect caused by removing an ester group from the BTAZT unit may offset its disadvantage brought about by the decline of molecular coplanarity, so the P3HT:JC14 blend film exhibits larger self-aggregation domains with clearer phase separation and interpenetrating networks, which form a continuous charge percolation pathway to help the exciton dissociation and carrier transport, thus improving JSC and FF for the corresponding OSC devices. Apparently, the fine-tuning regulation for the structure of the BTAZT unit from JC2 to JC14 has a crucial effect on the morphologies of the blend films that ultimately affects the device performances.
Meanwhile, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to investigate the molecular crystallinity and orientation information of the pure and blend films,69 and their two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns and corresponding line-cuts are presented in Fig. S7† and Fig. 7, respectively. To further describe the molecular crystallinity, the crystalline coherent length (CCL) was calculated using the Scherrer equation based on the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) (Tables S6 and S7†).70 The pure P3HT film exhibits strong bimodal lamellar peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction at qz = 0.378 Å−1 (d = 16.6 Å) and in-plane (IP) direction at qr = 0.371 Å−1 (d = 16.9 Å), and the film also has a weak π–π peak at qz = 1.652 Å−1 (d = 3.80 Å). Both of the JC2 and JC14 pure acceptor films exhibit face-on and edge-on orientations with the lamellar peak at qr = 0.325 Å−1 (d = 19.3 Å)/qz = 0.345 Å−1 (d = 18.2 Å) and qr = 0.317 Å−1 (d = 19.8 Å)/qz = 0.328 Å−1 (d = 19.2 Å), respectively. Obviously, JC14 displays better crystallinity and molecular packing relative to JC2 as indicated by the CCL values of pure acceptors. Compared to the P3HT:JC2 as-cast blend film, the P3HT:JC14 as-cast blend film exhibits a preferential face-on orientation with a stronger π–π stacking peak at qz = 1.720 Å−1 (d = 3.65 Å) with a CCL value of 29.9 Å. For the optimized blend films, both P3HT:JC2 and P3HT:JC14 films show a strong lamellar peak at qz = 0.382 Å−1 (d = 16.4 Å) and a weak π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction, which can be traced back to the P3HT and corresponding acceptor. The P3HT:JC2 optimized blend film shows a lamellar peak at qr = 0.330 Å−1 (d = 19.0 Å) in the IP direction, which originates from the lamellar peak of JC2. However, the optimized blend film based on JC14 exhibits two peaks at qr = 0.308 Å−1 (d = 20.4 Å, CCL = 117.8 Å) and qr = 0.371 Å−1 (d = 16.9 Å, CCL = 73.4 Å), which stem from the scattering of P3HT and JC14. Compared with the P3HT:JC2 film, the existence of the two phases in the P3HT:JC14 film results in a better nanoscale morphology, which contributes to better charge transfer.

Conclusions
In summary, by fine-tuning the structure of a promising small NFA (JC2), a homologous NFA with an A-π-D-π-A structure (JC14) has been designed for P3HT-based OSCs. Compared with JC2, the removal of a strong electron-withdrawing ester group from a thiophene-fused benzotriazole unit significantly lifts the LUMO energy level of JC14. Although the absence of an ester group partially weakens the ICT effect that makes JC14 show a slight blue-shift of absorption, it still shows good complementary absorption to P3HT in the visible region. Thus, well matched energy levels and complementary absorption of the donor and acceptor as well as good phase-separation domains of the D/A blend film together cause the P3HT:JC14-based device to achieve a high PCE of 7.72% with a very balanced and high JSC of 16.04 mA cm−2 and VOC of 0.759 V, which surpass all the device parameters for the P3HT:JC2-based OSCs with a relatively lower PCE of 6.12%, JSC of 14.53 mA cm−2 and VOC of 0.685 V. This work demonstrates that the suitable structural modification of some building blocks for A-π-D-π-A type NFAs can effectively balance JSC and VOC for high-performance P3HT-based OSCs.
