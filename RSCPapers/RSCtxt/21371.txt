        Cu0
nanoparticles with a diameter of 20 nm and a narrow size distribution are obtained by NaBH4-induced reduction of CuCl2·2H2O in diethylene glycol. The course of the reaction essentially involves an intermediate formation of copper citrate (Cu3(citrate)2·nH2O) nanoparticles to control the nucleation of almost monodisperse and non-agglomerated Cu0 nanoparticles. The as-prepared and citrate-capped Cu0 nanoparticles turn out as surprisingly stable against air oxidation. When left in contact with air for 14 months, the Cu0 powder samples and thin films do only show minor oxide impurities. Even short-time heating to 120 °C in air is tolerable. Via simple solvent evaporation, porous Cu0 thin-films are prepared on corundum substrates that exhibit a very low resistivity of 3 × 10−4 Ω cm after sintering at 220 °C in forming gas (N2:H2 = 90:10). With these features the as-prepared, citrate-capped Cu0 nanoparticles become highly relevant to thin-film electronics, thin-film sensors and high-power batteries.
1. Introduction

        Copper
        nanoparticles are prospective candidates for various applications in printable thin-film electronics, for instance, the fabrication of radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, thin-film transistors (TFT), ultra high frequency (UHF) antennas, membrane keyboards, solar cells or battery testers.1–3 Here, silver is currently applied most often, but its strongly increasing spot price and concerns regarding its biocide properties strongly favour a replacement by copper. To date, routes aiming at nanoparticulate, copper-based thin-film electronics are mainly limited due to the high reactivity of Cu0 nanoparticles.4,5 Reoxidation in air typically occurs right after synthesis, during the purification processes, or within hours to a few days when storing the material.2,5–7 The challenge, on the one hand, persists in the synthesis of well-dispersed, oxidation stable nanoparticles, and on the other hand, in the subsequent processing to form highly conductive thin films. These issues can be tackled by suitable surface-capping of the as-prepared Cu0 nanoparticles with organic molecules that give access to surface protection—and thereby increased oxidation stability. However, any kind of organic capping agent may cause contaminations in the copper thin-films, especially, when applying any type of thermal removal. Consequently, careful selection of capping agents is essential in view of an application of Cu0 nanopowders and layers in thin-film electronics.
In general, two strategies for surface protection of Cu0 nanoparticles have been reported.8 First is the coating of nanoparticles with “hard” shells of an inert material (e.g.carbon/graphene,9silica,10 noble metals11). Alternatively, long-chained or polymer-type capping agents can be used (e.g. long-chained alkyl thiols,12carboxylic acids,7 poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)13). Establishing specific “hard” shells on Cu0 nanoparticles typically requires elaborate multi-step syntheses or is associated with low yields. In addition, contamination of Cu0 thin-films and limitations regarding the sinter behaviour have to be taken into account. The use of long-chained molecules and polymers, in contrast, often enables a one-step formation of protected nanoparticles by initial complexation of the precursor (so-called seed control) and subsequent adsorption on the nanoparticles surface (so-called surface protection). All molecule-like surface-cappings allow for thermal removal of the protective sheath. Since oxygen has to be excluded, thermal removal is however restricted to inert atmospheres or vacuum, and is the more complicated the higher the molecular weight of the organic capping agent.
Following the strategy of molecule-like surface-cappings, the synthesis of oxidation-stable Cu0 nanoparticles and its processing to highly conductive Cu0 thin-films are to date restricted to high-molecular-weight poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP).14 In view of the above discussed restrictions of such high-molecular-weight stabilizers for technical application, expanding the range of stabilizers to low-weight molecules that still guarantee high oxidation stability of Cu0 nanoparticles, and also high conductivity of Cu0 thin-films is of crucial importance. With this concern, we here demonstrate the use of citrate as an efficient surface-capping agent and stabilizer. By intermediate formation of copper citrate nanoparticles, citrate serves as a seed control as well as a protective agent subsequent to the reduction of Cu3(citrate)2·nH2O to Cu0 nanoparticles. The obtained Cu0 nanoparticles turn out to be stable toward air oxidation even on a timescale of several months. Removal of the citrate capping, time- and temperature-dependent sintering of porous Cu0 thin films and the resulting conductivity are investigated in detail.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and synthesis
All chemicals were applied as received. This includes: copper(II) chloride dihydrate (99%, Riedel de Haën), sodium borohydride (95%, Riedel de Haën), trisodium citrate dihydrate (99%, Acros), diethylene glycol (≥99%, Merck), ethanol (98%, Seulberger), and isopropanol (technical grade, Seulberger). Aqueous solutions were prepared by using demineralised water.

Synthesis of Cu0 nanoparticles. 
A typical synthesis was performed under dynamic nitrogen purging in order to exclude moisture and oxygen during the reaction. 85.3 mg of CuCl2·2H2O and 100.0 mg of trisodium citrate dihydrate were dissolved in 20.0 mL of diethylene glycol and heated to 100 °C under vigorous stirring. During heating the clear green solution turned to a bluish green suspension which indicates the formation of nanoscaled copper citrate (cf. ESI†). Meanwhile, 10.0 mL of diethylene glycol were heated to 100 °C, too. At this temperature, 75.7 mg of NaBH4 were added and dissolved under vigorous stirring. When the NaBH4 had been completely dissolved, this solution was injected to the first-made Cu3(citrate)2·nH2O suspension. With this measure, the colour of the suspension instantaneously turned brownish black due to the formation of copper nanoparticles. After natural cooling to room temperature, the as-prepared nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation and washed three times by sequential redispersion in and centrifugation from a 1:1 mixture of ethanol and isopropanol. Colloidally stable suspensions were obtained by redispersing the washed nanoparticles in isopropanol; powder samples were obtained by drying the solid remnant for 12 h at ambient temperature in air. The Cu0 nanoparticles were obtained with a yield of 35 mg. Taking an amount of 10% of citrate as a surface capping agent into account, this represents a yield near 100%.



            Sintering of Cu0 thin-films. 

            Cu0 thin films for sintering experiments were prepared viadrop-coating on glass plates. With this concern, about 20 drops of a 1 wt% suspension of the washed copper nanoparticles in isopropanol were sequentially placed on the surface of a cleaned glass plate. The dried samples were sintered thereafter for 30 min at temperatures up to 500 °C under forming gas (N2:H2 = 90:10). Subsequent to cooling to room temperature, the layers were partly removed from the glass plate by scratching with a spatula. The obtained cross-sections were used for electron microscopic characterization; the removed powder was analyzed by XRD.


Conductive thin films of Cu0 nanoparticles. 
Conductive thin films of Cu0 nanoparticles were prepared viaevaporation of suspensions on Al2O3 substrates (CeramTec Rubalit 710). With this concern, about 1.0 mL of a 10 wt% suspension of the washed copper nanoparticles in isopropanol was placed on the surface of a cleaned Al2O3 plate and dried at ambient temperature. In terms of controlled and slow drying, the Al2O3 substrates were placed under a glass dome with a small hole at the bottom in order to guarantee a high partial pressure of isopropanol. The conductivity of dried samples was measured by four-point probing under a forming gas flow (N2:H2 = 90:10) in the temperature range from room temperature to 250 °C. To elucidate the structure and composition of the Cu0 thin-films, the layers were partly removed from the Al2O3 plate by scratching with a spatula. Suitable cross-sections were used for electron microscopic characterization; the removed powders were analyzed by XRD.

2.2 Materials characterization and analytical tools


Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Zeiss Supra 40 VP, using an acceleration voltage of 20 kV and a working distance of 4 mm, to analyse the size distribution and shape of the nanoparticles. All samples were prepared by evaporating a single drop of a dispersion of the as-prepared Cu0 nanoparticles in isopropanol in air at ambient temperature.



Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). 

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was conducted on the same electron microscope as the above SEM analysis, using an acceleration voltage up to 30 kV and a working distance of 4 mm. STEM samples were prepared from 2–3 drops of a sonicated suspension (0.1 wt%) on holey carbon-film copper-grids at room temperature.



            Dynamic light scattering (DLS). 

            Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed with a Nanosizer ZS from Malvern Instruments (equipped with a He–Ne laser (633 nm), detection via non-invasive back-scattering at an angle of 173°, 256 detector channels, polystyrene cuvettes). For analysis, the as-prepared nanoparticles were redispersed in diethylene glycol by ultrasonic treatment for 15 min.



            Sorption measurements
          . 

            Sorption measurements were performed based on Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. With this concern, as-prepared powder samples (with a weight of about 150 mg) were measured with a BELSORPmini II from BEL, applying N2 as adsorbate. The particle size D was calculated by D = 6/ABET·ρCu with ρCu = 8.92 g cm−3.



X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. 

X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out with a Stoe Stadi-P diffractometer using Ge-monochromatized Cu-Kα1 radiation.


Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR). 
Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were recorded on a Bruker Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr pellets. For this purpose 400 mg of dried KBr were carefully pestled with 1 mg of the sample and pressed to a thin pellet. All spectra of the nanoparticles were subjected to a correction of scattering effects to allow for comparison to reference spectra.



UV-Vis spectra
          . 

UV-Vis spectra were recorded with a Varian Cary Scan 100 using dispersions of the Cu0 nanoparticles in isopropanol. Measurements were performed in transmission geometry since a significant contribution from particle scattering is not expected with particle diameters below 50 nm.



Differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry (DTA-TG). 

Differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry (DTA-TG) were performed with a Netzsch STA 409C instrument, using corundum crucibles for the sample and as a reference. The Cu3(citrate)2·nH2O and Cu0 samples were heated in air or under nitrogen up to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 K min−1.


Conductivity measurements. 
Conductivity measurements of the Cu0 layers were carried out in a four-point DC conductivity measurement setup.15 Samples were prepared by depositing Cu0 nanoparticles on Al2O3 substrates with a size of 2.5 × 0.4 cm. The inner electrodes were placed at a distance of 8.0 mm to each other. The theoretical layer thickness was calculated to be 8.4 μm considering the weight of the deposited Cu0 particles and the size of the Al2O3 substrates. The samples were mounted in an Al2O3 sample holder in a tube furnace and heated with a rate of 1 K min−1 to a temperature of 250 °C under forming gas flow (N2:H2 = 90:10). A current of 0.1 A at a maximum voltage of 40 V was applied by a Keithley 224 current source. The current and voltage were recorded every 20 seconds by an Agilent 34970A unit. Since the layer thickness is increased by a factor of 3–4 due to the porosity of the as-deposited Cu0 layers, the effective film thickness was determined after sintering the Cu0 thin-films at 800 °C. Here, electron microscopy images of typical cross-sections confirm a layer thickness of 8 ± 2 μm.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of Cu0 nanoparticles

          Cu0
nanoparticles were prepared by reduction of Cu2+ with NaBH4 in diethylene glycol (DEG) as a solvent. To control particle nucleation and growth, the synthesis was performed in two separate steps that turned out to be essential with regard to the formation of nanoscale Cu0 with a high oxidation stability. Thus, a solution of CuCl2·2H2O and trisodium citrate dihydrate in DEG ([Cu]2+/[citrate]3− = 1.5) was heated to 100 °C. First, this results in a nucleation of copper citrate nanoparticles and the formation of a deep cyan suspension (Fig. 1). Although these copper citrate nanoparticles turned out as non-crystalline their chemical composition is qualitatively clarified by infrared spectra that show characteristic vibrations at 3650–3300 cm−1 (ν(OH)), 1750–1250 cm−1 (ν(COO)) and in the fingerprint area (1200–800 cm−1). These vibrations are well in agreement with spectra of bulk-trisodium citrate as a reference (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the intermediate compound was analyzed viathermogravimetry (TG) which suggests a composition of Cu3(citrate)2·nH2O (with n = 1–3, cf. ESI†).16 Nucleation of the copper citrate nanoparticles is controlled on the one hand by the surface-protecting properties of DEG, and on the other hand, by the complexing and stabilizing character of the citrate ion itself. Dynamic light scattering evidences a narrow size distribution with a mean diameter of 21(5) nm for the copper citrate.

Size distributions according to DLS analysis after redispersion of the nanoparticles in DEG; FT-IR spectra of copper citrate and Cu0 nanoparticles (black lines) with trisodium citrate as a reference (grey line). 
As the second step of the synthesis, the intermediate Cu3(citrate)2·nH2O nanoparticles were reduced to Cu0 by injection of NaBH4 at a temperature of 100 °C. With this measure, the suspension instantaneously turned brownish black (Fig. 1). Finally, the nanoparticles were carefully washed via repeated centrifugation/redispersion in/from mixtures of ethanol and isopropanol, and obtained with a yield near 100%. To verify the influence of the intermediate copper citrate precipitation on the oxidation stability of the final Cu0 nanoparticles further experiments at different pH values were carried out. If the copper citrate precipitation was prevented at low pH-level during the synthesis, the nanoparticles showed an increased tendency for agglomeration and/or reoxidation. This points to the essential role of the intermediate copper citrate nanoparticles that obviously act as a template, allowing for an adequate stabilization of the Cu0 nanoparticles right after the chemical conversion of the Cu3(citrate)2·nH2O nanoparticles (Fig. 1).
Subsequent to synthesis and purification, the as-prepared Cu0 nanoparticles were resuspended in isopropanol or DEG, forming deep black suspensions. Adequately diluted suspensions (i.e.Cu0 ≤ 1 wt%) do not show any appreciable sedimentation for weeks (Fig. 3). If the particle concentration exceeds 1 wt%, the suspensions still show only minor sedimentation after a couple of days. The size, size distribution and degree of agglomeration of the Cu0 in DEG were investigated by dynamic light scattering (Fig. 1). With this concern, a narrow size distribution of 15–45 nm and a mean diameter of 21(4) nm were obtained. This value is well in accordance with the size of the initial copper citrate nanoparticles, too. In addition to DLS, the particle diameter and size distribution of Cu0 are confirmed by electron microscopy. Typical SEM overview images exhibit uniform nanospheres with diameters of 20–30 nm (Fig. 2a). The particle size and degree of agglomeration were further verified by STEM investigation (Fig. 2b–d). Here, non-agglomerated particles with a mean size of 20(3) nm are observed in the bright-field as well as in the dark-field detecting mode. In addition, the crystalline nature of the Cu0 nanoparticles is confirmed by the distinctive dark-field contrast (Fig. 2b). The particle size was further verified vianitrogen sorption analysis and calculation of the specific surface area by means of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. With a porosity of 194 mm3 g−1 and a specific surface of 28.8 m2 g−1, a particle size of 20–25 nm can be deduced that matches well with the values obtained from DLS and electron microscopy.

SEM (a), dark-field STEM (b) and bright-field STEM (c) overview images as well as bright-field STEM detailed image (d) of as-prepared, citrate-capped Cu0 nanoparticles. 
The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of as-prepared Cu0 indicates all characteristic Bragg peaks of elemental copper and suggests the absence of appreciable amounts of crystalline impurities such as Cu2O, CuO, CuCO3 or Cu(OH)2 (cf.Fig. 5). Based on the full-width-at-half maximum of the (111) Bragg peak, the crystallite size can be deduced to 23 nm via the Scherrer formalism. This value is in good agreement with the mean particle size as determined by DLS, SEM/STEM and BET. Since Cu0 nanoparticles exhibit a characteristic surface-plasmon resonance in the visible spectral range, the presence of copper metal can also be confirmed by its optical properties. With this concern, UV-Vis spectra of Cu0 suspensions in isopropanol were recorded (Fig. 3). Here, the absorption maximum was determined at a wavelength of 614 nm, which is in good agreement with literature data (i.e. around 600 nm).17,18 Note that the position of the absorption maximum is not only influenced by the particle size and shape, but also by the surface capping and the surrounding medium. Hence, a slight shift as compared to literature data—reporting on Cu0 nanoparticles, but with different surface cappings/solvents—is within the expected range. In conclusion, the optical properties also indicate that the surface of the nanoparticles consists of elemental copper.

3.2 Surface conditioning and oxidation stability of Cu0 nanoparticles
The essential role of the citrate-capping for the formation and oxidation stability of the as-prepared Cu0 nanoparticles qualitatively becomes obvious based on the fact that the absence of citrate results in massively agglomerated copper particles with diameters largely exceeding 100 nm. Without citrate the obtained copper particles turned out to be much less stable against air oxidation. By now, XRD analysis indicates the formation of copper oxides when leaving the powder samples for just some hours in contact with air.

FT-IR spectra of the as-prepared Cu0 nanoparticles clearly evidence the presence of citrate as a surface capping agent. Although weak in intensity, the characteristic vibrations at 3650–3300 cm−1 (ν(OH)), 1750–1250 cm−1 (ν(COO)) and the fingerprint area (1200–800 cm−1) are well in agreement with spectra of bulk-trisodium citrate as a reference (Fig. 1). As the Cu0 nanoparticles were washed carefully before drying and preparing the IR samples, this finding indicates that the citrate is adsorbed on the nanoparticles surface during the reaction, and thereby allows an efficient stabilization and passivation of the copper surface. In fact, such citrate-capping is well-known to control nucleation and colloidal stability of nanoparticles. With gold as the most prominent example,19,20citrate-capping has been used for the liquid-phase synthesis of metals such as Co, Ag, Pd or Pt.21–23 In the case of Cu0 nanoparticles, a citrate-capping has been only reported to increase the efficiency as a catalyst in Ullmann reactions.24
To determine the amount of citrate adsorbed on the surface of the Cu0 nanoparticles, thermogravimetry (TG) was involved (Fig. 4a). For sample preparation, the as-prepared Cu0 was washed as described above and carefully dried in a vacuum at ambient temperature in order to remove all excess solvents. First, the TG was monitored under nitrogen atmosphere to avoid any oxidation of the nanoparticles. Here, a minor weight loss of 1.8% is observed up to temperatures of 220 °C. This is ascribed to slight amounts of solvents remaining on the particle surfaces and to the dehydration of citrate (i.e. >175 °C). In addition, a weight loss of 7.6% occurred between 220 and 280 °C, followed by 1.7% up to 410 °C. This finding is in accordance with the thermal decomposition of surface-bound citrate to form methyl maleic anhydride or acetone, accompanied by the simultaneous evaporation of the decomposition products.25 When heating even further to 800 °C the sample weight remains almost constant, indicating that no oxidation to Cu2O or CuO occurred under nitrogen atmosphere. Altogether, TG of citrate-capped Cu0 nanoparticles exhibits a total weight loss of 11.5% and evidences the presence of a considerable amount of about 10 wt% of citrate as the surface capping agent on the as-prepared Cu0 nanoparticles.
 Fig. 4  
Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetry (TG) of citrate-capped Cu0 nanoparticles as performed in nitrogen atmosphere (a) as well as in air (b) (total weight: 16 mg). 
To evaluate the thermal oxidation of the Cu0 nanoparticles, TG measurements were secondly performed in air (Fig. 4b). Therefore, the Cu0 sample was again washed as described above and carefully dried under vacuum. Now, TG shows a first weight loss of 1.0% at temperatures up to 115 °C that again indicates a minor loss of solvent residues. In contrast to TG under nitrogen, a significant increase in weight is observed next in the ranges of 115–240 °C (+13.0%) and 240–310 °C (+5.5%). This increased weight is in accordance with the oxidation of Cu0 to Cu2O (calc: +12.6%) in a first step, followed by oxidation to CuO (calc: +12.6%). When considering that this increase in weight is superimposed by the citrate-related weight losses of −1.8% (20–220 °C) and −7.5% (220–280 °C), the observed values are in accordance with expected values. Moreover, CuO is indeed identified by XRD analysis as the thermal remnant of the TG performed in air. Most remarkably, the citrate-capped Cu0 nanoparticles do not show any oxidation in air up to temperatures of 115 °C. Beside the long-term stability at ambient conditions, this finding underlines the outstanding stability of the as-prepared Cu0 nanoparticles.
To quantify the stability of the citrate-capped Cu0 under ambient conditions and to determine its oxidation stability against air and moisture, X-ray diffraction patterns were monitored (Fig. 5). With this concern, washed and dried Cu0 samples were deposited in open plastic boxes that were in contact with air. In steps of 2–3 weeks up to a period of 14 months in total, the Cu0 powder samples were investigated by XRD to verify the formation of copper oxides (i.e.Cu(OH)2, Cu2O, CuO, CuCO3) and to indicate the occurrence of re-oxidation processes. Accordingly, powder diffraction patterns indicate just a slight amount of Cu2O (Cu2O (111) at 36.4°, 2θ). Minor differences of, for instance, the signal-to-noise ratio are related to statistical differences when preparing the samples for X-ray diffraction analysis. The most relevant source of error regarding this type of analysis would be the formation of amorphous oxidation products. Since any oxidation would occur from the outside to the inside of the Cu0 nanoparticles, growing of such a non-crystalline oxide shell could be followed by two effects: (a) the Bragg peaks of the decreasing metallic Cu0 core would become broader with proceeding oxidation; (b) along with the consumption of Cu0, the intensity of Bragg peaks related to Cu0 would decrease. A detailed consideration of the most intense Bragg peak of Cu0 indicates that both effects do not occur on a timescale of 14 months (Fig. 5). In conclusion, these findings reliably evidence the stability of the as-prepared citrate-capped Cu0 nanoparticles under ambient conditions in air.

3.3 Layer formation, sintering and conductivity of nanoparticulate Cu0 thin-films
In order to study the sintering behaviour of Cu0 thin-films, cross-sections of the resulting layers—prior and subsequent to sintering—were investigated by electron microscopy (Fig. 6). Thus, a layer thickness of 20–30 μm was obtained for the as-deposited thin-films. Herein, the primary Cu0 nanoparticles are naturally agglomerated, but nevertheless clearly visible with its initial particle size of 20–30 nm. Although the Cu0 nanoparticles are in intimate contact with each other, high resolution images indicate a significant porosity inside of the as-deposited thin-films. With the thermal sintering under forming gas (N2:H2 = 90:10), the particle size and layer thickness remain almost unaffected up to temperatures of 200 °C (Fig. 6). Cross-sections of thin-films sintered at 400 and 500 °C, in contrast, show a significant reduction of the layer thickness to 14(4) and 8(4) μm, respectively. Moreover, the formation of sinter-necks between the individual particles becomes clearly obvious. Both effects—the reduced layer thickness as well as the observed sinter-necks—indicate the sintering of the nanoparticles to form infinite Cu0 sponges at temperatures above 300 °C. The area of fracture of sintered layers even shows a growth of copper needles that exhibit the diameter of the initial particle size but a length of several microns (Fig. 6g and h).
 Fig. 6  
            SEM cross-sections (right) and detailed images (left) of nanoparticulate, porous Cu0 layers on glass substrates subsequent to sintering at temperatures up to 500 °C (a–f). Cracks inside of thin-films sintered at 400 °C (g) and 500 °C (f) indicating the formation of Cu0 needles (some needles for clarity indicated by white arrows). 

          Sintering of the as-deposited Cu0 thin-films is confirmed by XRD patterns (Fig. 7). While the full-width-at-half maximum (FWHM) of the (111) Bragg peak remains constant up to a temperature of 200 °C, higher temperatures of sintering go along with a decreased peak width, which points to a growth of the crystallites. In detail, the determined crystallite size increases from 23(2) nm (25–200 °C) to 36 nm (300 °C) and 57 nm (400 °C) respectively. The peak width of the sample sintered at 500 °C is in the range of the instrumental broadening; a determination of the crystallite size is therefore not meaningful. Note that impurity phases such as Cu(OH)2, Cu2O, CuO or CuCO3 are still observed, but only with minor concentration. In accordance with sintering and crystallite growth, the color of the Cu0 powders changes from deep black to the characteristic reddish brown of the bulk-metal.
 Fig. 7  
            XRD patterns (zoomed-in plot) of sintered Cu0 powders illustrating the increased crystallite size at 300–500 °C. 
Finally, the conductivity of as-deposited porous Cu0 thin-films was measured via four-point probing (Fig. 8) while simultaneously heating the sample in forming gas (N2:H2 = 90:10) to 250 °C. No significant conductivity (i.e. 101–103 Ω cm) was measured for the as-deposited Cu0 thin-films up to a temperature of 195 °C. When increasing the temperature to 220 °C, however, a dramatic drop of the specific resistance by 5 orders in magnitude was observed and results in a specific resistance of 5.6 ± 0.4 × 10−4 Ω cm. This corresponds to a specific resistance of 3.1 ± 0.3 × 10−4 Ω cm at 20 °C which is only by a factor 50–100 higher than the resistivity of bulk-copper (1.7 × 10−6 Ω cm). The significant decrease in resistivity is attributed to the removal of the citrate-capping agent and coincides with the weight loss observed in thermogravimetry (cf.Fig. 4). Applying a temperature of 220 °C does however not lead to a significant sintering of the Cu0 nanoparticles—as demonstrated by electron microscopy and XRD investigation of the sintered layers (Fig. 6 and 7). Note that the Cu0 thin films represent highly porous, nanostructured layers. A further decrease of the resistivity to the range of bulk-conductivity is to be expected due to particle sintering at temperatures above 300 °C. Note that all experiments regarding layer deposition were performed without any optimization of those parameters that are relevant for real technical inks and its printing (e.g., viscosity, solids content, type of solvent, substrate pre-conditioning). Based on this proof of the concept significantly improved layers (e.g. with concern to homogeneity and density), and thereby increased conductivities are to be expected while applying professional printing technologies.26,27 A further cost advantage may arise from the use of Cu0 formulations—as ink and paste—in high-quality printing techniques for the mask-less production of structured conductive electrodes.

4. Conclusions

        Cu0
nanoparticles were prepared by a straightforward one-pot reaction, and in concrete gained viaNaBH4-initiated reduction of CuCl2·2H2O in diethylene glycol. As a result, non-agglomerated Cu0 nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 20 nm were obtained. The course of the reaction essentially involves an intermediate formation of copper citrate nanoparticles to control the nucleation of almost monodisperse and non-agglomerated Cu0 nanoparticles.
Surprisingly, the as-prepared and citrate-capped Cu0 nanoparticles turn out to be highly stable against air oxidation. Thus, Cu0 nanopowders and thin films do not show appreciable oxide impurities even when left in contact with air for 14 months. Even heating to 120 °C in air is tolerable. Via simple solvent evaporation, porous Cu0 thin-films are prepared on Al2O3 substrates that after sintering under forming gas at about 200 °C exhibit almost bulk-like behaviour with a specific resistance of 3 × 10−4 Ω cm. Such a facile liquid-phase synthesis of citrate-capped Cu0 nanoparticles with such air stability has not been reported so far. With these features the as-prepared, citrate-capped Cu0 nanoparticles become highly relevant for thin-film electronics, sensors or high-power batteries.
