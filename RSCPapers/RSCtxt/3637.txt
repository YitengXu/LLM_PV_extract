    , Accepted 28th May 2020First published on 28th May 2020AbstractThree new low-cost A1–D–A2–D–A1 type small molecule acceptors BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F have been designed and synthesized for high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs). In BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F, intramolecular noncovalent interactions are adopted to construct ladder-like planar molecular backbones. For BTOR-IC4F, the introduction of two alkoxyl chains at the 5,6-positions of the central benzothiadiazole unit can markedly improve the solubility, lift the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level, and optimize the morphology of the active layer. As expected, PBDB-T:BTOR-IC4F based OSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.48%, which is higher than those of devices based on PBDB-T:BT-IC4F (9.83%) and PBDB-T:BT2F-IC4F (8.45%). Meanwhile, the solar cells based on BTOR-IC4F demonstrate a low non-radiative energy loss of 0.28 eV.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are known as one of the most promising renewable energy conversion devices due to their advantages of light weight, low cost, mechanical flexibility, and large-area roll-to-roll printing.1–3 During the past several years, fullerene-free OSCs have achieved great progress4–8 with an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 17%. Most high-performance fullerene-free OSCs adopt A–D–A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs), which often contain a conjugated ladder core, such as indacenodithiophene (IDT)9,10 and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT), etc.11 Although such small molecule acceptors could afford high device performance, some intrinsic drawbacks such as complicated synthesis, multi-step purification, low yield, and high cost probably limit their future commercial applications.12–15 In our previous work,16 we have proposed a novel type of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), in which the ladder core is replaced by a ladder-like core. The synthesis of a ladder-like core, in which the covalent bonds are partially replaced by the noncovalent interactions17 (such as S⋯O, O⋯H, etc.), will be much easier than that of the ladder core. A series of A–D–A type NFAs based on intramolecular noncovalent interactions have been synthesized and utilized in OSCs.18,19 As expected, new ladder-like NFAs possess good solubility, near-infrared absorption,20,21 and high electron mobility, and achieve excellent power conversion efficiency.
Here, we design and synthesize three novel small molecule acceptors (BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F). The chemical structures of these three acceptors are shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, BT-IC4F is synthesized as the reference molecule. BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F possess a “ladder-like” core, which is composed of a central benzothiadiazole unit and two flanking 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) units. The two fluorine atoms or two alkoxyl chains at the 5,6-positions of the benzothiadiazole unit can form F⋯S or O⋯S intramolecular noncovalent interactions22–25 with the sulfur atoms at the two CPDT units, which give rise to a ladder-like structure.26,27 Additionally, the two substituents in the benzothiadiazole unit can also adjust the solubility, absorption and energy level of the acceptor molecules.28BT2F-IC4F shows a poor solubility and a quite strong crystallinity.29BTOR-IC4F displays a better solubility, larger molar extinction coefficient, and slightly higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level. With PBDB-T as the donor, BTOR-IC4F based devices demonstrate a PCE of 11.48%, which is higher than that of BT2F-IC4F (8.45%) and BT-IC4F (9.83%) based devices. The improved PCE of BTOR-IC4F based solar cells can be ascribed to the high VOC, appropriate morphology of the blend films, and a quite low non-radiative energy loss of 0.28 eV.

Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
The chemical structures and synthetic routes of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F are displayed in Scheme 1. The detailed procedures are given in the ESI.† Compounds 2 and 5 are commercially available and compounds 1 and 8 are prepared according to reported methods.30,31 Compound 3 is prepared by Suzuki coupling of 1 and 2 with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst precursor in a yield of 88%. Lithiation at the α-position of 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene is followed by quenching the formed anion with trimethyltin chloride to afford compound 4 in a yield of 91%. Pd(PPh3)4 catalyzed Stille couplings of 4 with 5 and 8 afford compounds 6 and 9, respectively, in yields of approximately 70%. The treatment of compounds 6 and 9 with the newly prepared Vilsmeier reagent in 1,2-dichloroethane affords compounds 7 and 10 in yields of 71% and 73%, respectively. Knoevenagel condensation of 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile with the dialdehyde intermediates 3, 7 and 10 affords the target small molecules BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F in yields of 63%, 61% and 62%, respectively. Chemical structures of the three SMAs are characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The thermal stabilities of these three acceptors are determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F show thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) of 348, 354 and 306 °C, respectively, indicating their excellent thermal stabilities (Fig. S4†).
Molecular design strategy and DFT calculation
Firstly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level are carried out to evaluate the molecular conformations and energy levels of these three A1–D–A2–D–A1 type SMAs, and the optimized molecular geometries are depicted in Fig. 1. To reduce the complexity of these SMAs, all the alkyl chains are simplified to methyl groups. Due to the existence of S⋯N, F⋯S and S⋯O intramolecular interactions, the central D–A2–D units of simplified BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F all display good planarity with dihedral angles of 0°, 0° and 5°, respectively. The same outer A1–D units of the three SMAs exhibit 0° dihedral angles due to S⋯O intramolecular noncovalent interaction.32 It can be found that all three molecules possess a V-shape geometry with a planar backbone, which ensures that the whole molecule is conjugated. The calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/LUMO energy levels (Fig. S1†) are −5.45/−3.68 eV, −5.54/−3.71 eV and −5.43/−3.57 eV for the simplified BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F, respectively. In order to further study the intramolecular interactions in these molecules, the relaxed potential surface energy scans of possible rotamers16,33 in BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F are conducted. The two potential rotamers BT2F-CPDT and BTOR-CPDT are selected in the central D–A2–D units of simplified BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F, respectively. As shown in Fig. S11,† the BT2F-CPDT rotamer could be locked-up in an energetically preferred conformation of −180° due to the F⋯S intramolecular interactions. Similarly, the optimal torsion angle of the stable BTOR-CPDT is −170° (S⋯O geometry) and there is a 5.7 kJ mol−1 energy barrier from the stable state to the metastable state (0° BTOR-CPDT rotamer, S⋯N geometry), which suggests that the S⋯O geometry in BTOR-IC4F is energetically preferred conformation.

Obviously, the introduction of two alkoxyl side chains at the 5- and 6-positions of the central benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole core can elevate the LUMO energy level of the acceptor because of the conjugation electron donating effect of alkoxyl chains. As expected, BTOR-IC4F based OSCs should give higher VOC. Additionally, the introduction of two alkoxyl chains can improve the solubilities of SMAs, which favors the formation of a better morphology of the blend film. The nanoscale phase separation of the blend film is the prerequisite for achieving high-efficiency OSCs. Hence, BTOR-IC4F based OSCs are expected to achieve the best device performance among these three acceptors.
Photophysical properties and energy levels
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F in CHCl3 solutions and as thin films are recorded and depicted in Fig. 2 and S2.† In dilute solutions, BT-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F exhibit a strong absorption in the region of 500–855 nm with the absorption maximum located at 746 and 750 nm, respectively, showing a bathochromic shift of approximately 25 nm relative to that of BT2F-IC4F (724 nm). As shown in Fig. 2a, the molar extinction coefficient of BTOR-IC4F (1.83 × 105 M−1 cm−1) is much larger than those of BT-IC4F (1.15 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and BT2F-IC4F (1.06 × 105 M−1 cm−1) in chloroform solutions. Upon going from solutions to neat films, as depicted in Fig. 2b, the absorptions become much broader, and the absorption maxima of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F are blue-shifted to 734, 703 and 710 nm, respectively. The broader absorption of the neat film is beneficial for the light harvesting of solar cells in a wide spectral range.34 The optical bandgaps of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F are quite similar and calculated to be 1.37, 1.38 and 1.37 eV, respectively, according to the equation: Egopt = 1240/λonset. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F are carried out to evaluate the frontier molecular orbital levels (HOMOs and LUMOs). As illustrated in Fig. 2c and S3,† the LUMO/HOMO of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F are determined to be −4.27 eV/−5.89 eV, −4.31 eV/−5.98 eV and −4.23 eV/−5.92 eV, respectively. It is worth noting that the CV results are fully consistent with DFT calculations. The optical and electrochemical properties of SMAs are also listed in Table 1. The results indicate that BTOR-IC4F with two alkoxyl side chains possesses not only a large molar extinction coefficient but also an elevated LUMO energy level, which is better for absorbing more sunlight and achieving higher VOC in OSCs.

Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic properties of these three acceptors are evaluated with an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:SMA/MoO3/Ag. The wide band-gap conjugated polymer PBDB-T is chosen as the electron donor and the ZnO layer is prepared according to previous literature.35,36 All the detailed optimization processes, including those for the weight ratios of donor to acceptor (D/A), additives and thermal annealing temperatures, are given in the ESI (Tables S1–S5†). The J–V characteristic and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the photovoltaic devices are plotted in Fig. 3, and the optimized device parameters are also listed in Table 2. The optimal weight ratio of polymer to SMA is 1:1.2 (w/w) and PCEs of 7.85%, 7.04% and 10.18% are achieved for BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F based as-cast devices, respectively. Subsequently, 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) is utilized as a solvent additive and thermal annealing is performed to further optimize the device performance. BT-IC4F based devices give an optimal PCE of 9.83% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.69 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 21.40 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 66.4%. BT2F-IC4F based devices give a slightly lower PCE of 8.45% with a simultaneously decreased VOC of 0.67 V, JSC of 19.43 mA cm−2 and FF of 64.7%. Amazingly, BTOR-IC4F based devices achieve the highest PCE of 11.48% with a much improved VOC of 0.80 V, a JSC of 20.57 mA cm−2 and an FF of 69.6%. As mentioned above, the higher VOC can be attributed to the elevated LUMO energy level of BTOR-IC4F, and the higher JSC and FF can be ascribed to its larger molar extinction coefficient and more balanced hole and electron mobilities (vide infra). Besides, the EQE measurement is used to check the credibility of our PCEs. As shown in Fig. 3b, BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F based EQE curves all show a broad response in the range from 300 to 860 nm, and BTOR-IC4F based devices display the highest EQE value of 73% at 650 nm, indicating an efficient sunlight absorption and charge collection. The JSC values of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F based devices calculated from the EQE curves are all within 5% error of the values obtained from the J–V curves.

To further study the charge recombinations of the optimal OSCs, JSC under different light intensities (P) (Fig. 3c) is measured. The relationship between P and JSC can be defined as JSC ∝ PS, where S is the power exponent. According to the literature,37 negligible bimolecular recombination occurs when S is close to 1. The S values of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F based devices are calculated to be 0.95, 0.93 and 0.96, respectively. The highest S value indicates that the bimolecular recombination in PBDB-T:BTOR-IC4F based OSCs is much suppressed, which is in accordance with their high FF.
The photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of OSCs (Fig. 3d) is also tested to reveal the exciton dissociation and charge collection processes.38Jph is estimated from Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. Veff is calculated from Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when JL = JD and V is the applied voltage. Under short-circuit conditions, exciton dissociation and charge collection probabilities (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat, where Jsat represents the saturation photocurrent density) of 95.3%, 89.4% and 96.0% are achieved in the optimal devices based on BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F, respectively. The Pdiss value of BTOR-IC4F based devices is the highest in these devices, which indicates that more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction processes occur with the BTOR-IC4F acceptor.
In order to understand the high VOC of BTOR-IC4F based devices, we carry out EQE and electroluminescence (EL) measurements to demonstrate a voltage loss analysis.39,40 As depicted in Fig. 4, the energy of the charge transfer state (ECT) is determined from the crossing point of Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) and normalized electroluminescence spectra. The non-radiative energy loss is related to the external quantum efficiency41 of electroluminescence (EQEEL) via the equation qΔVnon-rad = −kTln(EQEEL), where q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. The EQEEL of the solar cells based on these three acceptors is depicted in Fig. S8† and the voltage loss analysis data are summarized in Table 3. To our surprise, the lowest ECT for the BTOR-IC4F based solar cells gives rise to the highest VOC because of their lowest Vloss. We find that the non-radiative recombination loss of BTOR-IC4F based solar cells is only 0.28 eV, which is significantly lower than those based on BT-IC4F or BT2F-IC4F and comparable with those of inorganic materials. Besides, the degree of radiative recombination loss for BTOR-IC4F based solar cells is also the smallest (0.27 eV) among OSCs based on these three acceptors.

Space charge limited current mobilities
To explain the considerable photovoltaic performance difference of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F based OSCs, the charge mobilities of the blend films are tested by using the space charge limited current model. The device architectures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al are used to investigate hole mobilities (μh) and electron mobilities (μe), respectively. As depicted in Fig. S9† and Table S6,† the μh/μe of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F based blend films is determined to be 1.63 × 10−4/2.92 × 10−4, 8.99 × 10−5/1.30 × 10−5 and 1.34 × 10−4/7.17 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The relatively high hole and electron mobilities are beneficial for less charge recombination, which would lead to a higher JSC value. The μh/μe values of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F are 0.55, 6.92 and 1.85, respectively. The more balanced charge mobilities of BTOR-IC4F are helpful for a higher FF, which is consistent with the trend of photovoltaic performances.
Morphological characterization
The morphology of the blend film is closely related to the device performance. Therefore, the morphologies of blend films are tested by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the results are presented in Fig. 5 and S5.† As shown in Fig. S5a–c,† the as-cast blend films exhibit a relatively smooth surface morphology with nanoscale phase separation. The root-mean-square roughness (RMS) values of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F based blend films are 1.38, 1.49 and 1.27 nm, respectively. After the addition of the additives and thermal annealing, PBDB-T:BT-IC4F and PBDB-T:BT2F-IC4F based blend films show slightly large phase separation with the RMS values increased to 3.71 and 2.28 nm, respectively. However, after the same treatment, PBDB-T:BTOR-IC4F based blend films display a similar morphology to the as-cast blend films and the RMS value becomes slightly smaller. The TEM measurements are in line with the AFM results. All the as-cast blend films based on these three acceptors show a homogeneous morphology with nanofibrils. Compared with those in PBDB-T:BT-IC4F and PBDB-T:BT2F-IC4F blend films, the nanofibrils in the as-cast PBDB-T:BTOR-IC4F blend films are much thinner, better dispersed and more interpenetrated. Furthermore, more polymer nanofibrils can be observed in the optimal PBDB-T:BTOR-IC4F blend films, which can benefit the charge generation and transport.42 However, after the addition of the additives and thermal annealing, the PBDB-T:BT-IC4F and PBDB-T:BT2F-IC4F blend films show large aggregates with scarce polymer nanofibrils. To better understand the reason of such phenomena, we measure the solubility of these SMAs. As shown in Fig. S7,† a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 in n-hexane for each acceptor is used to investigate the solubility. BT-IC4F and BT2F-IC4F are almost insoluble in n-hexane; whereas BTOR-IC4F is highly soluble. Besides, we also conduct a quantitative experiment to test the solubility according to the literature.43 Consequently, the solubilities of BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F, BTOR-IC4F in chloroform are 141, 118, 192 mg mL−1, respectively and are derived from the concentration and absorption data (Fig. S10†). The good solubility of BTOR-IC4F can delay the precipitation of acceptors, which favors the formation of the appropriate morphology of the polymer nanofibrils during the drying of the blend films.

The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the pure acceptors, PBDB-T and the blends are measured to compare the difference of molecular packing in the blend films. As shown in Fig. S6,† a pure BT2F-IC4F film displays sharp diffraction peaks, indicating the strong π–π interactions.44 Yet the pure BT-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F films exhibit weaker π–π stacking peaks. These results are in line with the AFM and TEM measurements.
Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized three new A1–D–A2–D–A1 type SMAs, which comprise a central benzothiadiazole unit (A2), two flanking 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene units (D) and two electron-withdrawing acceptor units (A1). It can be observed that BT-IC4F, BT2F-IC4F and BTOR-IC4F have ladder-like molecular structures because of the intramolecular S⋯N, F⋯S and O⋯S interactions. Compared with those of traditional fused-ring acceptors, the syntheses of these noncovalently fused-ring electron acceptors would be much easier. Among these three acceptors, BTOR-IC4F gives the best device performance. BTOR-IC4F displays a broad absorption from 500 to 855 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient of 1.83 × 105 M−1 cm−1. Moreover, the introduction of two alkoxyl side chains could improve the solubilities of the small molecules, which is conducive to the formation of appropriate morphologies of the blend films. In addition, BTOR-IC4F displays slightly improved energy levels due to the introduction of alkoxyl chains, which gives rise to a higher VOC (0.80 V) in the devices. The fluorinated counterpart BT2F-IC4F displays a strong crystallinity, resulting in a slightly large phase separation in the blend film. Consequently, the PBDB-T:BTOR-IC4F based OSCs achieve the highest PCE of 11.48%, which is higher than those of PBDB-T:BT-IC4F (9.83%) and PBDB-T:BT2F-IC4F (8.45%) based ones. Moreover, according to the voltage loss analysis, BTOR-IC4F based devices exhibit the lowest non-radiative and radiative energy losses of 0.28 and 0.27 eV, respectively. Our work has demonstrated that we can achieve high-performance organic solar cells by the use of precisely designed small molecule acceptors with a ladder-like core.
