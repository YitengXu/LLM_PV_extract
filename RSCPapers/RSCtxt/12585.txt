    , Accepted 8th December 2022First published on 13th December 2022AbstractPerovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have recently captured tremendous research attention owing to their outstanding semiconductor properties such as tunable bandgap, high defect tolerance, efficient carrier mobility and narrow emission line width. Significant developments have been made in PeLEDs, achieving an external quantum efficiency of over 20%. However, there is still a long way to go for commercial applications. Recently, alkali metals (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+) have been used to obtain high-performance perovskite light-emitting diodes, presenting a thriving development trend. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the roles of alkali metals in the field of PeLEDs for better performance. The background and foundational concepts of PeLEDs are presented, and we discuss the introduction of alkali metals into PeLEDs as an effective strategy for adjusting energy level alignment, improving perovskite film properties and optimizing device performance. The incorporation of alkali metal ions into the charge transport layer is mentioned, which has been neglected in previous studies on PeLEDs. Several studies on high-performance PeLEDs based on alkali metals are also highlighted, and the challenges and perspectives are addressed.
1. Introduction
In recent years, metal halide perovskites have emerged as a family of the most competitive semiconductor materials. They have superior photoelectric properties with promising advantages due to their tuneable optical bandgap, long carrier diffusion length (100–1000 nm), low exciton binding energy (37–75 meV), high charge carrier mobility,1–8 and so on. Meanwhile, their low raw material cost9–11 and simple fabrication process at low temperatures9,12,13 provide the possibility for large-scale commercial application and mass production in the future. Hence, perovskite materials have been extensively researched in terms of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), perovskite photodetectors and lasers over the past few years. Benefiting from in-depth studies about perovskite material and the maturity of preparation technology, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVSCs has been boosted from 3.8%14 to 25.7%,15 which is outperforming conventional polycrystalline silicon solar cells. At the same time, perovskite materials have not only promoted the development of an efficient and low-budget photovoltaic industry but have also shown excellent performance in the application of light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
According to the Shockley–Queisser triangle equation,16 these perovskites, which are highly efficient absorbers, are also good choices for light-emitting diodes, making them the most promising candidates for the next generation of lighting and display. Despite there being an investigation of LEDs with 2D-layer perovskites in 1990, the devices only worked under low-temperature conditions (≈77 K), which restricted their applications in daily life.17–20 Friend's group was the first to fabricate multi-colour (green and near-infrared) PeLEDs with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 0.1% and 0.76%, respectively.21 Since this remarkable breakthrough, the efficiencies of PeLEDs have rapidly improved within a short time and exceeded 20% in 2008.22–24 To date, the highest reported EQEs of near-infrared-emitting, red-emitting and green-emitting PeLEDs are 22.2%, 23% and 28.1%, respectively, rivalling those of the organic light-emitting diodes.25–27 Although blue PeLEDs are still lagging behind, EQEs have improved gradually and are approaching 15%.28,29
However, there are still some issues to be addressed, which impede the further progress of PeLEDs. Therefore, intense strategies have been adopted to optimize the perovskite quality. For instance, doping engineering is considered an efficient and momentous way to modify both the bulk region and the surface/interface of the perovskite.30 For this strategy, it is crucial to introduce dopants into the pristine crystal lattice without destroying their inherent structure and properties.31,32 In general, dopants are divided into two categories including organic dopants and inorganic dopants, and both can control crystal growth and enhance device stability.33 However, some organic dopants passivate only the surface state34 and affect the carrier transport in the active layer.35–38 Among the inorganic dopants, alkali metals are regarded as ideal dopants because they can enter the bulk phase or adsorb at the surface to change the photoelectric device properties.9 There have been several reported studies about the benefits of applying alkali metals to perovskites in recent years. Cao et al.39 combined theoretical and experimental methods and reported that extrinsic alkali metals occupied the interstitials of perovskite lattices, leading to the suppression of ion migration. By decorating surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) with potassium-halide interlayers, Abdi-Jalebi et al.40 have ultimately decreased photoinduced ion migration and the nonradiative losses of perovskites. Additionally, experiments have proved that the introduction of a small amount of rubidium and cesium into perovskites resulted in higher external quantum efficiency and longer carrier lifetimes through controlling halide distribution and passivating defects.41,42 In fact, some landmark achievements of perovskite devices like PVSCs and PeLEDs have been made by doping with alkali metal ions.
Herein, we present an overview of the advances of alkali metal ions applied in the PeLED. The recent research about alkali metals doping in PeLEDs is summarized in Table 1. The review starts with the fundamental concepts of PeLEDs. The structure of the perovskite is discussed first, followed by device working principles and strategies towards high-performance PeLEDs. These include defect engineering to reduce the defect density of the perovskite, architecture engineering to improve balancing the carrier injection and quantum confinement to increase the exciton binding energy of the perovskite. Then, we summarize the role of alkali metals in the PeLED, with a focus on energy level alignment, perovskite film properties and device performances. It is worth mentioning that this review does not limit the use of alkali metals to doping. Incorporating alkali metal ions into the charge transport layer and their functioning as the buffer layer are also briefly described. Finally, challenges and the outlook related to PeLEDs are presented for future commercial applications.

2. Fundamentals of PeLEDs
2.1 Structure of perovskites
Perovskite materials have the chemical formula BX3, where A refers to a monovalent cation like cesium, CH3NH3+ (MA+), and CH(NH2)2+ (FA+), B represents a divalent metal ion like Pb2+ and Sn2+, and X denotes a halide anion such as Cl−, Br−, and I−. As shown in Fig. 1a, in a unit cell, B-site atoms located at the body-centered position are surrounded by six X-site halide atoms to form an octahedral structure. A-site atoms occupy the space between octahedrons to maintain the electrical neutrality of the crystal. The bandgap of perovskite is mainly determined by B-site atoms and X-site atoms, while A-site atoms tend to relate to the size and symmetry of the cell, which change the bond angle and length of B–X bonding and indirectly influence the perovskite bandgap.2,43,44 Therefore, adjusting the composition of B-site and X-site atoms can greatly change the bandgap of perovskites and regulate the emission colour of perovskites across a wide range (see Fig. 1b).45 The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) was put forward to predict the probability of forming new perovskite structures, according to the following formula: (1)RA, RB and RX stand for the ionic radius of the A-site atom, B-site atom and X-site atom, respectively. For the cubic perovskite structure, the values of t are in the interval between 0.8 and 1.0. When t > 1 or t < 0.8, either an orthogonal structure or a hexagonal structure could be formed.46–48

Based on the traditional 3D perovskite structure, low-dimensional perovskites have been investigated and widely applied in light-emitting diodes. By introducing bulky organic cations into the 3D perovskite structure, 2D or quasi-2D structures including Dion–Jacobson phases (see Fig. 1d) and Ruddlesden–Popper phases (see Fig. 1e) can be formed. This kind of material has the chemical formula LmAn−1BnX3n+1, where L represents a large-sized monovalent (m = 2) organic cation or divalent (m = 1) diammonium organic cation and n is the number of octahedral sheets with the case of n = ∞ standing for the 3D structure.49 The geometry of 2D or quasi-2D perovskite structures can be considered as slicing the 3D structure in a plane along the 〈100〉 directions.50–52 Compared with 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites are equipped with natural quantum wells that strengthen the quantum-confinement and dielectric effects.53–57
Apart from 3D and quasi 2D/2D perovskites above, 0D perovskites can also be used as emission layer materials that are usually described as perovskite quantum dots or nanocrystals. By adjusting the composition of halide elements or quantum tunning, the spectral characteristics of 0D perovskites vary from 400 to 700 nm, which is advantageous for visible light-emission applications.45,58–60
2.2 Working principle
Similar to the device structure of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), the general structure of PeLEDs is exhibited in Fig. 1c, where the perovskite emissive (EML) layer is sandwiched between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transport layer (HTL).61,62 The ETL and HTL also serve as the blocking barrier of holes and electrons, respectively. This structure is essentially a double heterojunction with a sandwich structure. The p-type and n-type semiconductor materials with wide bandgaps function as HTL and ETL, respectively, and materials with narrow bandgaps act as emissive layers.63 When a forward bias is applied to the electrodes, holes and electrons are injected into the HTL and ETL, respectively. Under an applied electric field, holes and electrons are brought into the emissive layer and form excited hole–electron pairs and finally, the photons are emitted via radiative combination.64
2.3 Strategies towards high efficiency
In this section, we briefly introduce the strategies to improve the performances of PeLED devices from three main aspects, namely, defect modulation, architecture engineering and quantum confinement. According to previous studies, defects cause trap states that increase the possibility of trap-assisted recombination. Owing to the electric nature of defects of the perovskite, ionic bonding and coordinating bonding can play the role of neutralizing charged defects.65 Various functional molecules like Lewis acids, Lewis bases, organic halides and alkali halides are introduced into perovskites to passivate defects on the grounds of the passivation mechanism. For example, the Lewis bases as electron donors can effectively passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ or Pb cluster by coordination.96 Similarly, the Lewis acids as electron acceptors can neutralize uncoordinated I− or antisite PbI3 by forming hydrogen bonds. Moreover, bifunctional molecules with both Lewis acids and Lewis bases are created to passivate both uncoordinated and interstitial defects.97,98 Except for the passivation agents above, organic halides and alkali metals neutralize the charge of perovskite defects. The excess organic halides added to the perovskite solution can compensate for the absence of organic halides in perovskites.99–102 The application of alkali metals will be explained in detail in Section 3.
Architecture engineering to improve carrier injection and transport has a great influence on the performance of PeLEDs. To our knowledge, unbalanced charge injection could cause carriers to accumulate at the interface of charge transport layers and the perovskite EML, which causes a non-radiative combination.103–106 There is always the barrier to hole transport, therefore, it is crucial to manage hole injection and transport within the PeLEDs. Until now, three main strategies have been discovered to promote hole injection and transport: (i) optimizing the energy level alignment of neighbouring layers and the perovskite layer, (ii) inserting an interlayer on the interface of the adjacent layer to form a step-by-step layer for hole transport, and (iii) the application of materials with high hole mobility.107–112 Concerning electron transport, there is almost no barrier between the organic ETL and perovskite EML, which leads to excess electrons. Many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, including the employment of materials with low electron mobilities113 and inserting the insulator layer between the ETL and EML.114 For the inorganic ETL, it is useful to use impurity-doped ETL materials and modify the interface of the inorganic ETL and perovskite EML to enhance electron injection.
Excited electron–hole pairs are bonded together by Coulomb forces. For traditional 3D perovskites with small bonding energies (Eb), excitons are easily separated into two free carriers that induce low-efficiency radiative recombination and degrade device performance.115,116 The exploitation of the quantum confinement effect can efficaciously improve Eb. When the size of materials approaches the Bohr radius, Eb increases drastically. For example, the Eb values of low-dimensional perovskite materials like quasi-2D and 0D are more than an order of magnitude greater than that of bulk perovskite materials.117,118
3. Alkali metal roles in PeLEDs
3.1 Energy level alignment
As discussed in Section 2.3, the energy level mismatch is an obstacle to carrier injection, therefore, having a negative impact on the performance of PeLEDs. On the one hand, selecting suitable carrier transport materials with high carrier mobility and injection and well-aligned energy levels are necessary conditions for realizing high-efficiency PeLEDs. On the other hand, chemical doping is a practical approach to adjusting the energy levels of the perovskite and balancing electrons and holes in the perovskite emission layer. Consequently, incorporating alkali metal cations into the perovskite has been reported as a useful way to handle band alignment. Tang et al.119 calculated the band gaps of the perovskites doped with Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+ based on the Tauc plot as shown in Fig. 2a. The bandgaps of the perovskites containing Li+, Na+ and K+ are 1.613, 1.607 and 1.609 eV, respectively. In contrast, the incorporation of Rb+ and Cs+ contributed to the widened bandgap of the perovskites. Combined with the data shown in Fig. 2a, the energy band alignment is illustrated in Fig. 2b. The doping of Li+, Na+ and K+ resulted in the increase in the valance band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the perovskites. However, doping with Rb+ and Cs+ showed the opposite variation in the displacement of the CBM and VBM. Zhang et al.59 elaborated on the method for determining the position of the energy levels of the perovskite films. Generally speaking, the optical bandgaps of the perovskites were obtained from UV-visible spectra. According to the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), the secondary electron cut-off (Ecutoff) and valance band maximum energy (EVBM) can be extracted as shown in Fig. 2c. The VB levels were calculated from the following equation: VB = 21.2 − (Ecutoff − EVBM). In this study, the VB levels of FAPbBr3, FA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3, FA0.8Cs0.2PbBr3, and FA0.7Cs0.3PbBr3 nanocrystals were evaluated to be −5.88, −5.63, −5.44, and −5.25 eV, respectively, which displayed an increasing trend, leading to the promotion of the hole injection process due to a reduced hole injection barrier between the EML and HTL. Hoang et al.70 demonstrated the use of K to realize efficient green CsPbBr3 NCs. Their results proved that the energy level position of the perovskites had changed, presenting the improved energy level alignment for hole and electron injection adjacent to the EML. As shown in Fig. 2d, the reference sample revealed the deep band level relative to the hole transport material PEDOT:PSS and the conduction band level relative to the electron transport material TPBi, which limited the carrier collection rate. When only a little bit of potassium was added, the energy levels of the perovskites shifted up from 0.17 eV for 1% potassium doping to 0.25 eV for 2.5% potassium doping. Under the circumstance of 5% doping, the position of the energy level was almost similar to 2.5%, implying that the K dopant concentration reached saturation with 2.5% doping. The better energy level alignment of the perovskite was achieved via K doping and hence the optimization of the device performance in principle. Several articles have reported that smaller-sized alkali metals improved the efficiency of blue PeLEDs without destroying the original emission spectrum. Cai et al.76 studied the role of NaBr doping in a mixed halide quasi-2D perovskite containing PBA for blue light emission. The NaBr works as the spacer ligand to provide extra modulation of the distribution of quasi-2D perovskite. The energy level diagram is plotted in Fig. 2f. The Fermi level was close to the valance band of the perovskites, which indicated the p-type semiconductor characteristics of perovskite films.120,121 When NaBr was added to the perovskite, the barrier between the HTL and EML was reduced which benefited the hole collection and avoided the hole accumulation at the interface.

3.2 Carrier dynamic process
Previous studies have highlighted that alkali metal additions are conducive to passivating halide perovskite films and lessening the trap state density, which is of great significance to improving carrier transport and recombination processes. Guo et al.71 introduced K+ into the quasi-2D perovskite PEA2(FAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 to promote the homogeneity of different-n phases and enhance energy transfer. Transient absorption (TA) is a common measurement for exploring the energy transfer dynamics of the quasi-2D perovskites as shown in Fig. 3(a)–(d).124–126 The TA spectra of the pristine and K-doped perovskites are illustrated in Fig. 3a and c where the intensity evolution of the photobleaching peaks agrees with the excited-state distribution of different phases.127 It was found that doping with K+ led to the increased bleaching intensity of the n = 2 phases, which indicated an increase in the amount of the n = 2 phase. Furthermore, the evolution of the TA spectrum at low-n phases and high-n phases were analysed and fitted for further research. As shown in Fig. 3b and d, the time constant of the K-doped perovskite film was shorted than the pristine film, which reflected the faster rate of energy transfer after doping with K. The faster energy transfer rate revealed less energy loss and many carriers in the emitting region, which improved the recombination behaviour.

Apart from doping alkali metal salts into the perovskite precursor, some researchers introduced them into the hole transport materials or used them as the buffer layer to realize less non-radiative recombination. Nowadays efficient PeLEDs are limited by the serious trap-assisted non-radiative recombination loss at the interface of the perovskite film. Shen et al.122 utilized the inorganic potassium salts to modify PEDOT:PSS HTL. Due to the strong dipole interaction between K+ and halide ions, K+ guided the nucleation process and grain growth, resulting in a well-packed (Cs/FA/p-F-PEA)Pb(Cl/Br)3 perovskite, which increased the radiative recombination efficiency. The impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurement was applied in this article as shown in Fig. 3e and f. It can be seen in Fig. 3e that the composite resistance and reactance of both devices substantially decrease because of the high carrier transport rate under a high electric field. However, owing to the influence of K+ in perovskite crystallization, the semicircle radius of K-modified PeLED was smaller than that of the reference sample, which indicated reduced charge-transfer resistance. As shown in Fig. 3f, the response speeds under the electrical pulses of two devices were tested by transient EL decay measurements. It was obvious that the K-modified devices possessed a faster response to the electrical pulse as compared with reference one, which indicated the improvement of hole transport.129 Also, the enhanced hole transport led to more balanced carrier transfer, which improved the EL stability of perovskite films. In addition, K-modified devices illustrated the prolonged EL lifetimes. To sum up, the description above supported the fact that introducing K+ into the HTL contributed to better carrier transport by guiding perovskite crystals with more oriented features and suppressing interface defects. More interestingly, alkali metal salts have recently been reported to boost the performance of PeLEDs. Zhao et al.130 first put forward inserting the ultrathin (∼1 nm) lithium fluoride LiF layer between the perovskite and the organic semiconductor hole-transport layer. The LiF interlayer can effectively address the problem of the compatibility of the perovskite precursor solution with the interfacial condition of the substrate. To further understand the role of the LiF interlayer, You et al.123 demonstrated efficient quasi-2D PeLEDs by depositing the LiF interlayer between ETL and EML. It can be seen from Fig. 3i that the perovskite device with the inserted LiF interlayer had a longer PL decay tail lifetime of up to 140.96 ns where the PL decay tail responded to the non-radiative recombination rate. Also, the longer PL decay tail lifetime indicated the effective control of defect-assisted nonradiative processes, which can be well proved by a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement in Fig. 3g and h.
In conclusion, the incorporation of the LiF interlayer not only strengthened the chemical bonds with uncoordinated lead ions to passivate defects but also suppressed the quenching effect of perovskite triggered by the electron transport layer and reduced the excess electrons to balance carrier injection. Recently, Li et al.131 studied the effect of the RbCl layer as the ETL to realize better carrier injection and the buffer layer between the ETL and EML to improve the power conversion efficiency. These discussions mentioned above show that alkali metals can effectively suppress non-radiative recombination and improve carrier lifetime.
3.3 Film properties
Concerning the doping of halide perovskites, A-site cations can be easily replaced by doped ions. Some researchers have highlighted that the application of doping cations with larger ionic sizes will enlarge the perovskite crystal lattices, leading to a narrow bandgap and red shift of the absorption spectrum, while doping with cations with smaller ionic sizes is thought to be a helpful strategy to optimize halide perovskites and settle the hysteresis problem. Currently, the existence of different kinds of defects in the perovskite film is a significant obstacle to PeLED efficiency. Qiao et al.128 explored the point defects at the MAPbI3 perovskite grain boundaries (GBs) and defect passivation with K and Rb by using nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamic (MD)132 and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).133–135 As can be seen from Fig. 4a and b, the MAPb defect caused the deep electron trap state of MAPb@GBs by forming the I-dimer, which acted as a non-radiative recombination center and sped up energy and carrier loss. K and Rb alkali metals were administered to eliminate the midgap state, suppress non-radiative recombination and prolong the lifetime of excitons as shown in Fig. 4c and d. Alkali metal salts are also used to rearrange low-dimensional phases in quasi-2D perovskites. Pang et al.77 reported a stable and efficient sky-blue PeLED by incorporating NaBr into mixed-Br/Cl quasi-2D perovskites to manage the phase distribution. As shown in Fig. 4e, the absorption peak of the n = 1 phase decreased and the peak of the n = 2 phase increased; nevertheless, the peak corresponding to the n = 3 phase appeared, which demonstrated the rearrangement of the low- dimensional phase distribution of the perovskite films. The change of phase distribution may be attributed to the influence of perovskite crystallization after the addition of Na+ to the perovskite precursor. Based on the PL spectrum, the PL peak shifted from 479 nm to 487 nm, which is close to emission of the 3D perovskite ABX3. Therefore, the red shift in the PL spectrum may have arisen from the recovery of the 3D nature of emitting domains or the increase in the size or reduced Cl concentration of the emitting domains. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement in Fig. 4f, it was further confirmed that the n = 1 phase was suppressed and the n = 2 phase was promoted. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in Fig. 4g and h showed almost the same spacing of the (020) lattice planes for both perovskite films, indicating that the doping of NaBr did not change the internal structure of the crystals. From previously published studies, alkali metal doping has been applied to adjust the crystallization process. The doping of Cs+ leads to perovskite seeding at room temperature, availing the crystallization to achieve high-quality perovskite films with uniform grains, which could ultimately reduce the current leakage and obtain high-performance PeLEDs.136 It has been demonstrated that a small amount of K+ has played an effective role in increasing the perovskite crystallinity because of the altered kinetics of crystallization and growth.137 In detail, Kuai et al.138 reported that doping with K+ promoted phase transformation to the vertically-oriented 2D perovskite phases without an intermediate phase, which induced a large crystalline 2D perovskite and heterogeneous crystallization along the vertical orientation. Some small alkali metals like Na and Li could also regulate the crystallization and nucleation process and optimize film morphology. Li et al.74 compared the morphologies of the MAPbBr3 perovskite films without and with different ratios of NaBr additives. As shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 4i, the MAPbBr3 perovskite film without any additives displayed cubic crystals with sharp edges and corners, which merely covered parts of the substrate surface with submicron distances between crystal islands. The addition of NaBr improved the film coverage and smoothed the sharp edges and corners. However, the excess amount of NaBr altered the cubic structure to an irregular shape, indicating the lattice destruction to some extent as shown in Fig. 4l. Moreover, the holes on the perovskite crystal started to be filled by NaBr, which suggested that the existence of NaBr can passivate ionic defects caused by the halide vacancies on the surfaces of crystal grains. Yang et al.73 reported halide perovskite CsPbI3−xBrx NCs passivated by KBr to fabricate the red and stable PeLED. They used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements to explore the morphologies with/without KBr perovskite NC thin films. It was found that the perovskite film with KBr was uniformly covered by a lot of NCs, while the pristine perovskite film presented a porous morphology with a large quantity of mesoscopic pores. Besides, the values of the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness declined from 2.43 nm to 1.93 nm. In addition, the KBr-enriched environment can effectively passivate trapping sites located on the grain boundary and inhibit the photoinduced halide segregation of CsPbI3−xBrx NCs.

An increasing number of studies have focused on incorporating two or even more alkali metals into the perovskite precursor solution to achieve high-efficiency PeLEDs. Li et al.42 indicated that the incorporation of binary alkali cations Cs+ and Rb+ can suppress ion migration and enhance device lifetime experimentally and theoretically. Based on Fig. 5a–d, the grain size could increase readily by the incorporation of Cs+ or Rb+, while the incorporation of Cs+ and Rb+ led to a larger grain size, which was beneficial for reducing defects at GBs. Meanwhile, the incorporated perovskite film appeared to have better crystallinity with a slight peak shift (see Fig. 5l). As can be seen in Fig. 5j and k, the Coulomb interactions of the incorporation of Cs+ or Rb+ increased, which indicated the larger formation energy of the halide vacancies. The passivation mechanism of Cs+ and Rb+ could therefore be distinguished. The Rb+ distribution on the surface passivated the vacancy defects at the GBs and blocked halide ion migration channels, whereas Cs+ tended to reduce the halide ion vacancies and suppress ion migration inside the grains. Yuan et al.82 brought forward an innovative strategy, that is, the multi-cation (Cs/Rb/FA/PEA/K)Pb(Cl/Br)3. Surprisingly, it was found that the doping of Rb drastically improved the quality of the perovskite film due to its consisting of continuous small grains as shown in Fig. 5e–i. Rb played an important role in modifying the orientation growth of the crystals, which could result in a smoother film morphology based on grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements in Fig. 5n and o. On the whole, the incorporation of alkali metal ions could improve the perovskite film morphology and lay the foundation for stable and efficient PeLED devices.

3.4 Device performances
The alkali metal doping strategy functions as a bridge to realize highly efficient and stable perovskite light-emitting diodes. As an adjacent element of Cs, Rb has a smaller size and is used for cation doping to promote the device performance of PeLEDs. Several reports related to perovskite solar cells have revealed that the partial substitution of the A-site cation is considered an effective way to stabilize the crystal lattice.139,140 Sun et al.59 reported a FA/CS mixed nanocrystal PeLED with the luminance of 55005 cd m−2, current efficiency of 10.09 cd A−1 and EQE of 2.8%, which later inspired researchers to probe into other alkali metals cation substitutions. Shi et al.79 investigated the optoelectronic properties of PeLEDs by Rb partial substitution. The device characteristic curves are shown in Fig. 6. According to the current density–voltage (J–V) curve in Fig. 6a, there was a slight decline in the current density when Rb ions were introduced into the perovskite, which could be due to the much more nonconductive RbBr precipitation. In addition, PeLEDs-doped Rb displayed a higher breakdown voltage as compared with pristine PeLEDs, which indicated the enhanced durability of the devices by Rb incorporation. Fig. 6b–d shows the luminance–voltage (L–V), current efficiency–voltage (CE–V), and external quantum efficiency–voltage (EQE–V) characteristics. The best performance of PeLEDs was from the device containing 7% Rb, achieving the maximum luminance, CE and EQE of 65353 cd m−2, 24.22 cd A−1, and 7.17%, respectively. Wu et al.75 incorporated alkali metals with smaller sizes, such as Na, to replace the long organic ligand to realize the high performance of PeLEDs. In addition to basic device performance testing, the EQE of PeLEDs devices versus encapsulation time was monitored as illustrated in Fig. 6h. It was revealed that PeLEDs with 10% NaBr possessed a longer operation lifetime, which can be ascribed to the uniform and compact perovskite films. At present, long-term stability is one of the mainstream research topics for PeLEDs. Generally, perovskites doped with alkali metals show superior stability.

Li et al.42 examined the stability of the devices with incorporated Cs or Rb. As shown in Fig. 6e, the EQEs of the resulting devices at a constant current density of 100 mA cm−2 were recorded. The incorporated PeLED devices showed significantly promoted operation stability at high current density in contrast to pristine PeLEDs. There was no visible sign of I− re-distribution in the FACsRb-based devices (see Fig. 6f and g) which inhibited halide ion migration during the operation period. It was noted that FARb-based devices showed better stability than FACs-based devices, suggesting the more important role of Rb in improving device stability. Li et al.91 compared the organic additive phenethylamine hydrobromide (PEABr) with the alkali metals additive LiBr in terms of stability. Previous reports have summarized that organic additives are disadvantageous to charge transport properties and thermal stability. As can be seen in Fig. 6j and k, the PEABr-based perovskite displayed poor thermal stability with PL disappearing after annealing under the same conditions for 40 min. However, the 20% LiBr-incorporated sample showed outstanding thermal stability, with the PL intensity remaining almost kept constant even after annealing at 120 °C for 24 h. These results implied that perovskite CsPbBr3 passivated by inorganic LiBr achieved higher efficiency and enhanced operation stability.
4. Challenges
4.1 Elemental distribution and location
To date, alkali metal cations have been confirmed as being positive for the performance of PeLEDs. Just as every coin has two sides, they also have disadvantages in PeLEDs, which depend on their distribution in the perovskite. Generally speaking, there are three situations to describe the formalization.9 Firstly, alkali metals lead to separate phases and are incorporated with perovskites as a bulk junction. Under this circumstance, the properties of the perovskite are hardly affected by additives. Secondly, alkali metals substitute one of the atoms of the perovskite lattice or occupy the interstitial. Thirdly, excessive alkali metal halides provide a halide-rich environment to passivate the surface and reduce the non-radiative recombination center due to the solid solubility, and there are probably complex situations occurring in the actual process. Currently, the lattice parameter variation is used as the judgement standard for whether the extrinsic cations enter the crystal lattice. However, this method is not totally accurate because the crystal lattices are also influenced by the bonding state and orbital hybridization.9 On the whole, future research could be focused on the interactions between extrinsic cations and host cations, as well as the cation distribution.
4.2 Carrier dynamics
Alkali metal doping has been proven to have a role in suppressing ion migration and enhancing migration activation energy. However, the quantitative relationships between ion migration and device efficiency, as well as the mechanism behind the inhibition effect, are still not clear and systematic. Particularly, the ion migration of small incorporated cations such as Li+ and Na+ that can diffuse across different functional layers or aggregate at the interface could present more complicated situations. Moreover, traditional steady-state characterization techniques should be further researched due to the influence of variable external environments on ion migration.141 Beyond that, it is of great importance to explore the activation energy of ion migration under working conditions for promoting the stability of PeLEDs. Moreover, the phase instability and operational stability caused by ion migration could be overcome from the system perspective, which implies that in the future, researchers should focus on the ion migration of each functional layer.
4.3 Toxicity
Presently, most PeLEDs contain elemental lead, which seriously impedes commercial applications. If PeLEDs are not mishandled, they will accumulate lead in the environment and pollute the food chain.142 Although alkali metal doping improves the performance of PeLED devices, it does not contribute to the attenuation of PeLED toxicity. Nowadays, the elements such as Sn, Bi and Sb near lead are utilized to substitute for lead in the perovskite. Though lead-free perovskites decrease the toxicity of the lead and appear highly stable, quite a few problems are arduous to solve, such as low PLQY caused by an indirect bandgap, self-trapped exciton luminescence mode and wide FWHM of light emission, etc.63 In the future, the developing techniques will avoid exposure to toxic lead and solve toxicity issues effectively.
5. Outlook
Recently, alkali metals have been playing optimizing roles in PeLEDs and have aroused extensive research attention. However, the research on alkali metals applied in PeLEDs is only at the early stages, which indicates that there remain some issues to be resolved. In particular, there is still a lack of systematic studies on the underlying functional mechanisms of doping alkali metals to improve the performances of PeLEDs. This is probably caused by the complexity of material systems or the limitations of existing characterization techniques. Looking forward, there is still tremendous space for development to design and perfect halide perovskites applied in optoelectronic devices. For instance, the passivation mechanism of alkali metal doping remains ambiguous. More studies need to be focused on the favourable influence of alkali metal doping for the further development of defect passivation. Also, it is expected that advanced characterization techniques can be implemented to investigate the doping of alkali metals given the sensitivity of perovskite materials. Herein, we have simply put forward several research directions from different points, which lay the foundation for related exploration in the future. Additionally, the evolution of alkali metal doping is beneficial for guiding the incorporation of other varieties of metal cations such as transition metals, main group metals and rare earth metals, which have the potential to optimize the optoelectronic properties. At present, the alkali metal doping strategy has mainly been reported for light-emitting diodes and solar cells. It is believed that the simple doping strategy can be applied in other perovskite devices that require long carrier lifetimes and low defect density such as photodetectors, X-ray detectors and low-threshold lasers. To sum up, we expect that alkali metal engineering further improves the performance of perovskite devices and speeds up industrial applications based on perovskite photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.
6. Conclusion
In summary, we have thoroughly reviewed recent advances in incorporating alkali metals (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+) into PeLEDs, including energy level alignment, film properties, carrier dynamic processes and device performance. A variety of characterization methods have been mentioned to prove the positive effects of the incorporation of alkali metals. Intriguingly, this review covers not only the use of alkali metals in doping but also the incorporation of alkali metal ions into the charge transport layer and their function as the buffer layer. By incorporating alkali metals, the energy level of the perovskite is adjusted to realize better carrier injection and device performance and, in particular, the stability can be greatly improved. Furthermore, alkali metals passivate the surface of the perovskite film and the resultant perovskite film appears smoother and has greater film coverage. Also, alkali metals can effectively suppress non-radiative recombination and prolong carrier lifetime. Despite the significant progress achieved in the PeLEDs above, several issues involving elemental distribution and location, the uncertainty of carrier dynamics, and toxicity need to be resolved by experimental and theoretical methods. It is believed that related mechanisms behind the advantageous effects of alkali metals will be clear, and simple alkali metal additives can be applied not only in PeLEDs and PVSCs but also photodetectors, X-ray detectors and transistors, etc., in the near future.
