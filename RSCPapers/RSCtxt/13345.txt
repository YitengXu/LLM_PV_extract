However, the high voltage loss of bipolar membrane imposes significant constraints on operating current density, leading to low current density (<50 mA cm−2) for hydrogen production. In this work, decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis assisted with MnO2/Mn2+ redox mediator demonstrated to separate the stiff couple between hydrogen and oxygen production into two independent processes, which enables hydrogen production to run under high power input (up to 1 A cm−2) with oxygen production under low power input. Furthermore, such an amphoteric decoupled water electrolysis system can be integrated with an Mn–Zn battery, which is able to realize flexible conversion from renewables to hydrogen and electric energy, thus making full use of renewables.

Broader context
The rational utilization of renewable resources such as wind and solar power is of great significance to build a sustainable energy future. However, they are generally intermittent and fluctuating, which cannot match well to the demand. Hydrogen is considered a green and high-energy-density fuel, offering an excellent candidate as a versatile energy carrier. Moreover, water electrolysis powered directly by renewables is an ideal approach to clean energy. However, conventional water electrolysis is hard to accommodate fluctuating renewables. By introducing a redox “buffer”, the decoupling strategy of water electrolysis could split the electrolytic process into divided HER and OER processes, which could run at different currents, making the decoupled electrolysis smooth to accommodate fluctuating renewables. Herein, a proof-of-concept demonstration of decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis (separated by a bipolar membrane) with a MnO2/Mn2+ mediator has been proposed. This decoupled electrolysis not only facilitates the flexible conversion from renewables to fuels, as is the high-power wind-driven HER and low-power solar-driven OER, but also improves the compatibility of electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the decoupled water electrolysis can be integrated with Mn–Zn battery to realize renewable-to-electric energy and/or renewable-to-hydrogen, thus yielding an effective and flexible solution for intermittent energy.

Energy supply based on hydrocarbon energy resources (fossil fuel) is strongly constrained by limited reserves, greenhouse gas emission, and geographical distribution, which are not adequate for increasing demand for sustainable and green energy.1–4 As an energy carrier, hydrogen possesses huge advantages in environmental compatibility and energy content compared with fossil fuels.5 Water electrolysis powered by renewables provides a green approach to produce hydrogen.5,6 However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are rigidly coupled in conventional water electrolysis, which means the production of hydrogen and oxygen is simultaneous, and the reaction kinetics of the HER and OER is explicitly dependent on each other. Such a rigid coupling between HER and OER is hard to adapt to the fluctuant and intermittent nature of renewable energy and aggravates the H2/O2 crossover plus degeneration of cell components.7–10 Decoupled water electrolysis is first proposed by Symes and Cronin to mitigate the abovementioned issues.11 By introducing a redox mediator during water electrolysis, HER and OER can be completely decoupled whether in time or in space,11–13 which is favorable to direct conversion from renewable to hydrogen through water electrolysis without any mediating platforms to smooth erratic and unpredictable renewables.
Alkaline and proton exchange-membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are the most widely used systems for water electrolysis.14–17 Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages. Generally, in an acidic electrolyte, HER kinetics is fast because abundant protons are available for immediate discharge and hydrogen production.18–20 OER shows much sluggish kinetics compared with HER due to the complex multistep proton-coupled electron transfer process, and the OER kinetics highly depends on the electrocatalyst.21–24 Unfortunately, only the catalyst that comprises Ir or Ru, which suffer from scarcity and high cost, can catalyze the OER with minimum overpotentials in acidic electrolytes.24–27 In alkaline electrolytes, there are various catalysts (oxides of VIII group 3d metals, such as Fe, Co, and Ni) that can efficiently catalyze the OER, which is characterized by low cost and stability in an alkaline electrolyte.22,28,29 However, the protons for HER in the alkaline electrolyte are supplied by the slow water dissociation process (deprotonation of water), leading to high kinetic energy barriers.18,19,30 Accordingly, we know that acidic electrolyte is favorable for HER and alkaline electrolyte for OER when considering the kinetics of HER/OER and compatibility of electrocatalysts. Recently, amphoteric water electrolysis (HER in acidic electrolyte while OER in the alkaline electrolyte) attracts considerable attention due to the ability to simultaneously accommodate the optimal pH conditions for both HER and OER.31–41 Generally, a bipolar membrane (BPM) is needed to sustain the pH difference between acidic and alkaline electrolyte under steady-state operation.37,42,43 Consequently, the voltage loss of BPM derived from ohmic loss (ion transport resistance in the membrane) and activation loss (which is caused by water dissociation in BPM)35,44 is more severe than that of monopolar ion-exchange membranes (cation or anion ion-exchange membrane, in which the voltage loss only derived from ohmic loss). The activation loss of the bipolar membrane partially offsets the advantage caused by fast kinetics derived from optimized pH condition of amphoteric electrolytes. And the voltage loss increases dramatically with the increase of current density.35 Furthermore, high current density causes delamination/blistering of BPM.45–47 Consequently, most of the studies on amphoteric water electrolysis are focused on photo-assisted water electrolysis, which is characterized by low operating current density (<50 mA cm−2).31–38 Therefore, hydrogen production at high current density using amphoteric water electrolysis is still a significant challenge.
In this work, a proof-of-concept demonstration of decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis with a high-performance redox mediator, MnO2/Mn2+, had been proposed to overcome the abovementioned challenge. Thanks to the decoupled strategy and high reversibility of MnO2/Mn2+ chemistry,48–55 the HER process was able to work at high current density (up to 1 A cm−2) while the OER process took place at low current density. Interestingly, the decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis could be integrated with an Mn–Zn battery to realize flexible energy storage/conversion from power to fuel and/or power to power, which provides a promising strategy for optimal utilization of renewable energy.
Results and discussion
Demonstration of decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis

Fig. 1a shows the working principle of the decoupled amphoteric water electrolyser, whereby it comprised one HER electrode for hydrogen production, one carbon felt for the redox of MnO2/Mn2+ and one OER electrode for oxygen production. The carbon felt and HER electrode in the acidic electrolyte, together with Mn2+, formed the HER cell. When charging the HER cell, the H+ was reduced to hydrogen on the HER electrode while Mn2+ was oxidized to MnO2, which was deposited on the carbon felt.48-55Note that the solid-state MnO2 deposited on the carbon felt will not diffuse into the HER electrode; therefore, there is no need for a membrane to avoid migration of high valence state Mn4+ during HER. After the HER production, the carbon felt with deposited MnO2 in the acidic electrolyte, and the OER electrode in the alkaline electrolyte formed an OER cell. A bipolar membrane was employed to separate the amphoteric electrolyte and maintain the pH difference, and avoid diffusion of soluble Mn2+ to the OER electrode. During the OER process, the deposited MnO2 was reduced to Mn2+ and dissolved back into the acidic electrolyte, which is accompanied by the oxidation of OH− to oxygen on the OER electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed that the onset potential of Mn2+ to MnO2 on carbon felt in 1 M MnSO4 + 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte was 1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl (purple curve, Fig. 1b). Furthermore, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) showed that the onset potential of OER on carbon felt in 1 M H2SO4 without MnSO4 was 1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl (black curve, Fig. 1b), which was much higher than that of MnO2/Mn2+. This indicates that the oxidation of Mn2+ will replace OER during hydrogen production. Here 1 M MnSO4 + 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte was employed due to the negligible influence of Mn2+ on HER (Fig. S1, ESI†). For the oxygen production, the onset potential of OER in 2 M KOH electrolyte was around 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which was about 0.7 V lower than 1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl for the redox potential of MnO2/Mn2+. Thus, it seemed that the reduction of MnO2 and oxygen production were spontaneous during the OER process if only considering the thermodynamic potential of the electrodes. However, considering the bipolar membrane voltage (Vmembrane), the overall thermodynamic voltage required for an amphoteric water electrolyte is unchanged compared with conventional water electrolysis (Fig. S2, ESI†).31,36,56

(b) CV of MnO2/Mn2+ chemistry and LSV of HER and OER in different electrolyte. Scan rate: 5 mV s−1. 
To confirm the feasibility of decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis, LSV of HER and OER in decoupled amphoteric electrolyzer were recorded using a two-electrode configuration (Fig. 2a, b and Fig. S3a, ESI†). Moreover, the LSV of HER in conventional acidic (Fig. 2a) and alkaline (Fig. S4, ESI†) water electrolysis were recorded for comparison. Compared with the conventional full acidic water electrolysis (black curve), the decoupled hydrogen production accompanied by the oxidation of Mn2+ to MnO2 (red curve) required a lower voltage bias (Fig. 2a). In detail, it required an external voltage bias of −1.58 and −1.37 V for the conventional full water electrolysis and decoupled HER, respectively, at 10 mA cm−2, indicating a 210 mV superiority by decoupled HER. At a higher current density of 100 mA cm−2, an external voltage bias of −1.84 and −1.58 V was required for the conventional and decoupled water electrolysis, respectively, which showed a 260 mV superiority by decoupled HER. Furthermore, during the HER process, no oxygen was observed, indicating the high purity of hydrogen produced (Fig. S5, ESI†). The volume of hydrogen produced was close to the theoretical calculating value, which demonstrated the high purity of hydrogen released (Fig. S6, ESI†). Fig. 2b shows the LSV of OER using an amphoteric water electrolyzer, in which bipolar membrane was used to separate the amphoteric electrolyte (OER cell in Fig. S3a, ESI†). As far as we are aware, a bipolar membrane comprises a cation-exchange membrane (CEM) layer and an anion-exchange membrane (AEM) layer.57 Here the CEM side of the bipolar membrane faced the acidic electrolyte. It required an external voltage bias of 0.24 V to reach an OER current of 10 mA cm−2, and the voltage bias rapidly increased with the increase of current density. Based on the above results, decoupled HER and OER in amphoteric electrolyte required a voltage bias of 1.37 V and 0.24 V, respectively, to reach 10 mA cm-2, corresponding to a total voltage bias of 1.37 + 0.24 = 1.61 V (with bipolar membrane) at 10 mA cm−2. Compared with 1.58 V (without proton exchange membrane), which was required for conventional one-step acidic water electrolysis at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2a, black curve), the results for decoupled water amphoteric electrolysis showed a high voltage efficiency of 1.58/1.61 = 98.1%, which was higher than that of previous studies on decoupled water electrolysis.11,58,59 Low current density and low voltage bias are beneficial for utilizing low power renewables such as solar power to drive oxygen production (only 0.24 V required for OER at 10 mA cm−2, right part of Fig. 2c), which are obtained using amphoteric electrolyzers (Fig. S3b, ESI†). Moreover, high power input can be used to drive the HER process (1.56 V required for HER at 100 mA cm−2, left part of Fig. 2c) such as wind power. The decoupled system allows HER and OER process to operate at different current densities, which helps improve energy efficiency (Table S1, ESI†), and fully utilize intermittent and fluctuating renewables.7,10

Carbon felt serves as working electrode in 1 M MnSO4 + 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, which is galvanostatic charged to 1 mA h cm−2 and discharged to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (reference electrode), another carbon felt serves as counter electrode. 
The electrochemical performance of redox mediator plays a significant role in the decoupled water electrolysis. Here MnO2/Mn2+ chemistry characterized by high reversible and low cost was first employed to conduct the decoupled water electrolysis. The CV curves of carbon felt in 1 M MnSO4 + 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte at 5 mV s−1 showed no significant changes during extended 300 cycles (Fig. S7, ESI†), demonstrating the high stability of the reversible redox of MnO2/Mn2+. The rate performance of MnO2/Mn2+ chemistry is shown in Fig. 2d. With the increase of current density from 100 to 500 mA cm−2, the discharge capacity showed slight decay from 0.97 mA h cm−2 at 100 mA cm−2 to 0.93 mA h cm−2 at 500 mA cm−2, indicating a high rate performance with discharge capacity retention of 95.9%. The charge/discharge curves at different current densities are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The high rate performance enabled the HER cell to work at a high current density of 0.5 and 1 A cm−2 (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†), much higher than that of previous works.31–38,59–61 Furthermore, the cycle performance of MnO2/Mn2+ chemistry with galvanostatic charge/discharge current of 500 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2e) exhibited high stability over 1000 cycles with high Coulombic efficiency of 98.7%, demonstrating high durability of MnO2/Mn2+ chemistry. In addition, the cycle performance of MnO2/Mn2+ chemistry under high deposition capacity is shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). There was a decent 93% Coulombic efficiency under a high deposition capacity of 10 mA h cm−2.
Influence of membrane orientation on membrane voltage
Due to the aeolotropism of the bipolar membrane, the influence of membrane orientation on the decoupled amphoteric electrolysis was investigated. Four-points probe measurement was conducted to obtain the values of membrane voltage at different current densities (Fig. 3a and Fig. S12, ESI†), and the CEM side of BPM faces the acidic electrolyte (denoted as orientation-1, Fig. S2, ESI†). Obtained membrane voltage (Vmembrane,total = voltage difference between Ag/AgCl and Hg/HgO electrode) as a function of current density based on the bipolar membrane area (2 cm2) is shown in Fig. 3b. Vmembrane,total was measured as 0.71 V at equilibrium state (no applied current), which offsets the potential difference between MnO2/Mn2+ and OER in Fig. 1b (∼0.7 V). Moreover, Vmembrane,loss (Vmembrane,total − 0.71 V) gradually increased with increasing applied current (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3a also shows the operating principle when electric current (current direction from OER to HER electrode) was applied across BPM. The dissociation of water at the junction of CEM/AEM occurred under the high local electric field intensity (108–109 V m−1) in the depletion layer.62–64 Furthermore, the dissociated protons and hydroxide ions will migrate into the acidic electrolyte and alkaline electrolyte, respectively, which compensates for the consumption of protons for HER and hydroxide ions for OER, respectively. Furthermore, the influence of Mn2+ on the membrane voltage was investigated (Fig. S13, ESI†), and it showed no clearcut on the membrane voltage when the current density was <10 mA cm−2. The membrane voltage with the opposite orientation of BPM (CEM side of bipolar membrane faces alkaline electrolyte, denoted as orientation-2) was investigated. The membrane voltage was ∼0 at the equilibrium state (Fig. S14, ESI†) because no depletion layer formed at the CEM/AEM junction (Fig. S15, ESI†). Therefore, the OER cell was spontaneously able to discharge with an average operating voltage of 0.57 V at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. S16, ESI†). From the above results, it seemed that orientation-2 was favorable for water electrolysis because of low membrane voltage. However, amphoteric water electrolysis using orientation-2 was unsustainable due to the continuous consumption of acidic and alkaline electrolytes during electrolysis (Fig. S17, ESI†), as well as the decomposition of BPM (Fig. S18, ESI†). Consequently, orientation-2 was not suitable for decoupled water electrolysis.

Integration of decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis and Mn–Zn battery
The redox of MnO2/Mn2+ can be used as cathode chemistry in rechargeable batteries, and many Mn-based battery systems have been recently proposed.48–55 Such Mn-based battery system inspired us to suggest an integration system combining decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis and Mn–Zn battery for flexible energy storage and conversion (Fig. 4 and Fig. S19, ESI†), in which another auxiliary redox electrode, zinc electrode, was employed in alkaline electrolyte, in addition to the Mn electrode in an acidic electrolyte. The working principle of the integration system is shown in Fig. 4a. The HER and manganese electrodes formed an HER cell in the acidic electrolyte. During the HER process, Mn2+ was oxidized to MnO2, corresponding to the charging process of manganese electrode. Moreover, the OER and zinc electrodes formed an OER cell in the alkaline electrolyte. During the OER process, Zn2+ species were reduced to metal zinc, corresponding to the charging process of zinc electrode. Subsequently, the obtained MnO2 and zinc electrodes form a Mn–Zn battery in a charged state, which can provide electricity on demand. The potential curves of HER cell, OER cell and Mn–Zn battery are recorded in Fig. 4b. It could be seen that after the production of HER and OER (the left and center panel in Fig. 4b, respectively), the charged Mn–Zn battery can exert an operating voltage of 1.72 V at 10 mA cm−2. Such an integrated system allows HER and OER to take place under fluctuant and discontinuous renewables due to the rapid response and fast kinetics for both HER and OER cells in the optimized electrolyte. Furthermore, renewable energy can be stored in a Mn–Zn battery to produce electric power. With an efficient switch between HER, OER and Mn–Zn battery, the multifunctional integration system with the capability of power-to-fuel (hydrogen production) and power-to-power processes (rechargeable Mn–Zn battery) showed excellent flexibility and high utilization degree that can be adapted to various demands.

Conclusion
In summary, a decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis that is enabled by a MnO2/Mn2+ redox chemistry and a bipolar membrane was demonstrated. The decoupled strategy enabled HER to react under a high current density of 1 A cm−2 (which can be driven by high power wind energy) and OER under low current density (driven by low power solar energy), which not only took advantage of optimal electrolytes (fast kinetics and response of HER and OER) but also minimize voltage loss of BMP using a low power input. Furthermore, an integration system combining decoupled water electrolysis and Mn–Zn battery was proposed to flexibly utilize renewable energy, whereby renewables can be converted to hydrogen and can be stored in Mn–Zn batteries, which realizes the simultaneous power-to-fuel and power-to-power processes, and thus offering an efficient approach to flexible energy conversion between renewables, hydrogen and electricity.

Broader context
The rational utilization of renewable resources such as wind and solar power is of great significance to build a sustainable energy future. However, they are generally intermittent and fluctuating, which cannot match well to the demand. Hydrogen is considered a green and high-energy-density fuel, offering an excellent candidate as a versatile energy carrier. Moreover, water electrolysis powered directly by renewables is an ideal approach to clean energy. However, conventional water electrolysis is hard to accommodate fluctuating renewables. By introducing a redox “buffer”, the decoupling strategy of water electrolysis could split the electrolytic process into divided HER and OER processes, which could run at different currents, making the decoupled electrolysis smooth to accommodate fluctuating renewables. Herein, a proof-of-concept demonstration of decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis (separated by a bipolar membrane) with a MnO2/Mn2+ mediator has been proposed. This decoupled electrolysis not only facilitates the flexible conversion from renewables to fuels, as is the high-power wind-driven HER and low-power solar-driven OER, but also improves the compatibility of electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the decoupled water electrolysis can be integrated with Mn–Zn battery to realize renewable-to-electric energy and/or renewable-to-hydrogen, thus yielding an effective and flexible solution for intermittent energy.

(a) The decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis consists of HER cell for hydrogen production and OER cell for oxygen production with BPM for separating acidic (pink colour) and alkaline electrolyte (pale green). (b) CV of MnO2/Mn2+ chemistry and LSV of HER and OER in different electrolyte. Scan rate: 5 mV s−1.	 

 	Fig. 2  Demonstration of decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis. (a) LSV of HER electrode in 1 M MnSO4 + 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte (red curve), carbon felt as the counter and reference electrode. LSV of HER electrode in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte (black curve), an OER electrode as counter and reference electrode. (b) LSV of OER electrode in 2 M KOH electrolyte, carbon felt deposited with MnO2 as counter and reference electrode in 1 M MnSO4 + 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, the amphoteric electrolyte is separated by BPM (CEM side of BPM faces acidic electrolyte). Scan rate: 5 mV s−1. (c) Potential curves of hydrogen production in HER cell (left part, 100 mA cm−2) and oxygen production in OER cell (right part, 10 mA cm−2). The detailed configuration of decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis is given in Fig. S3b (ESI†). The negative discharge platform of OER cell indicates that the OER process requires external voltage bias. (d) Rate performance of MnO2/Mn2+ chemistry. (e) Cycle performance of MnO2/Mn2+ chemistry at 500 mA cm−2 current density. Carbon felt serves as working electrode in 1 M MnSO4 + 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, which is galvanostatic charged to 1 mA h cm−2 and discharged to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (reference electrode), another carbon felt serves as counter electrode.

The manganese electrode is charged during HER process in 1 M MnSO4 + H2SO4 electrolyte (pink colour) and zinc electrode is charged during OER process in 4 M KOH with saturated ZnO (pale green), and the Mn–Zn cell could exert electric energy on demand. (b) Potential curves for charging HER cell (left side, 100 mA cm−2) and OER cell (center part, 100 mA cm−2), and discharging of Mn–Zn cell (right side, 10 mA cm−2).
