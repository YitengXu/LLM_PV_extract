    , Accepted 9th April 2018First published on 10th April 2018AbstractZeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) are ordered microporous carbons synthesized by using zeolite as a sacrificial template. Unlike well-known ordered mesoporous carbons obtained by using mesoporous silica templates, ZTCs consist of curved and single-layer graphene frameworks, thereby affording uniform micropore size (ca. 1.2 nm), developed microporosity (∼1.7 cm3 g−1), very high surface area (∼4000 m2 g−1), good compatibility with chemical modification, and remarkable softness/elasticity. Thus, ZTCs have been used in many applications such as hydrogen storage, methane storage, CO2 capture, liquid-phase adsorption, catalysts, electrochemical capacitors, batteries, and fuel cells. Herein, the relevant research studies are summarized, and the properties as well as the performances of ZTCs are compared with those of other materials including metal–organic frameworks, to elucidate the intrinsic advantages of ZTCs and their future development.
1. Introduction
Crystalline microporous materials such as zeolites and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) possess clearly defined structures at a molecular level, which are advantageous to exhibit size-recognition of molecules, sieving effects, and selective chemical reactions. In addition, the ordered array of nanopores can facilitate mass transfer. Moreover, they can be easily and flexibly functionalized by means of chemical modifications for a variety of applications. In contrast, microporous carbon materials represented by activated carbons generally consist of disordered and defective graphenes which are stacked and/or aggregated,1 and their structures are far from crystalline. Their chemical modifications are possible to some extent, but not as controllable as those in the crystalline microporous materials. Nevertheless, the microporous carbon materials possess unique advantages such as chemical stability both in acids and bases, thermal stability, hydrophobicity, and electrical/thermal conductivity, which cannot be realized in the aforementioned crystalline microporous materials. Therefore, microporous carbon materials have been practically used in a variety of applications as adsorbents, catalysts, catalyst supports and electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors. In this context, if ‘crystalline microporous carbons’ are realized, they must be very fascinating providing the advantages of both of these two types of microporous materials. Zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) which are featured in this article satisfy such an idea to a great extent, regarding their ordered microporous frameworks and structure regularity. Their unique structural properties2,3 and excellent capability for a variety of applications have attracted many researchers, and over 200 research papers on ZTCs have been published up to now since the first trial synthesis by our group.4 We briefly summarized the synthesis techniques and the basic properties of ZTCs as well as their applications in a book chapter in 2012.5 Since then, ZTC research has developed remarkably, and this update will be beneficial for the researchers working in the relevant fields. Moreover, there has been no review paper focusing only on ZTCs and published in a scientific journal. Thus, the purpose of this featured article is to provide a comprehensive review on ZTCs as a journal article, including an update of the most recent work.
Crystalline microporous carbons have been theoretically proposed as Mackay crystals6 or carbon Schwarzites7 which had emerged as analogues of fullerenes (Fig. 1). Though these imaginary frameworks have never been experimentally synthesized, our group has proposed a probable way as shown in Fig. 2. In this method, zeolite is used as a template for building a three-dimensional (3D) framework (Fig. 2a).4,8–10 Carbon can be introduced into the zeolite nanochannels by means of polymer-impregnation followed by carbonization and/or chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on the zeolite (Fig. 2b). By removal of the zeolite, a ZTC is obtained as a negative replica of the parent zeolite (Fig. 2c). Zeolite is an aluminosilicate-based crystalline porous solid. Presently, there are 235 different types of zeolites recorded in the International Zeolite Association, and many of them possess 3D interconnected nanochannels analogous to the inner spaces of the Schwarz minimal surfaces. For example, the channel morphology of FAU zeolite (Fig. 2a; including zeolite Y and X) corresponds to the inner space of the Schwarz D surface, i.e., the diamond-type network structure. While two types of carbon Schwarzites could specifically fit the nanochannels of FAU zeolite (Fig. 3),8 the actual ZTC structure has been found to have an open-graphene framework as shown in Fig. 48,11 rather than tubular closed-structures like Schwarzites (Fig. 1, 3c and d). Though ZTC is not a perfect carbon Schwarzite, the framework consists of curved and single-layer nanographenes forming a 3D structure order, making this material distinguishable from other nanoporous carbon materials.

In this featured article, we first describe the development background of ZTCs in the context of the history of the template carbonization technique, and the structural and chemical diversities of ZTCs are illustrated. Then, a brief summary is given on their capability in applications, including hydrogen storage12–70 and electrochemical capacitors.25,71–95
2. Brief history of template carbonization
The major history of template carbonization is summarized in Fig. 5. The use of template substances for the production of carbon materials began around the 1980s. One of the pioneer works was reported by Knox's group in 1982.96 They impregnated silica gels or porous glasses with phenol resin and the resulting mixture was carbonized at 1273 K. After removing the template by alkali, the carbon was heat-treated at 2273–3073 K to obtain porous glassy carbons. In 1987, Pekala et al. used porous monoliths prepared by sintering of NaCl particles (ca. 20 μm) as templates for producing low-density microcellular carbon foams.97 In these pioneering works, templates having disordered structures were used.
 Fig. 5  Development history of template carbonization and relevant materials. 
The first template with a structure regularity was montmorillonite, which is one of the layered clay minerals, reported by our group in 1988.98 Though the carbonization of polyacrylonitrile usually yields hard carbons, the carbonization in two-dimensional (2D) nanospace induces the formation of planar graphene sheets, yielding graphite thin films upon template removal.
In 1995, our group succeeded in extending the templated carbonization to a one-dimensional (1D) template, aluminium anodic oxide (AAO).99,100 AAO is a thin-film porous membrane with cylindrical mesopores which are vertically arrayed in the membrane. The diameter and the length of the mesopores are uniform and controllable. While Martin et al. reported the use of AAO template for the production of metal/polymer nanotubes/nanorods in 1994, our group produced multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with a uniform and controllable diameter and length by CVD. A similar AAO-templated carbonization was reported also by Martin's group in 1998.101,102
As mentioned above, 2D (montmorillonite) and 1D (AAO) ordered templates yield 2D and 1D nanocarbons respectively, whereas the resulting nanocarbons are lacking in 3D networks and cannot retain the ordered structures of their parent templates. To obtain 3D ordered carbons, the use of a 3D ordered template is necessary. The first attempt to use a 3D ordered template was done with zeolite by our group in 1997,4 and two methods were proposed: (1) polymer-impregnation followed by carbonization (an impregnation-carbonization method) and (2) CVD. Soon after our report, the production of ZTCs was also reported by impregnation-carbonization by Mallouk's group (in 1997)103 and the CVD method by Rodriguez-Mirasol's group (in 1998).104 Unfortunately, these groups did not examine the replication of the zeolite ordered structure at that time. The first ordered porous carbons were reported by Zakhidov et al. in 1998,105 as carbon inverse opals (CIOs) which were obtained by using silica opals. In 1999, Ryoo's group106 and Hyeon's group107 reported the production of ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) by using mesoporous silicas as templates. OMCs were the first carbon materials with long-range ordered structures which can be detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and had a great impact on the field of porous materials. In 2000, our group finally reported the production of ZTCs with structure regularity derived from zeolite.9,10
In the 2000s, more inexpensive and/or easier soft-template techniques were developed. Liang et al. reported the preparation of OMC films simply by carbonization of block copolymers having a mesoscopic structures formed by microphase separation in 2004.108 In 2005, Nishiyama's109 and Meng's110 groups reported the production of OMCs by using surfactant micelles, similar to the protocol for mesoporous silicas. In these soft-template methods, a nanostructured composite which consists of two phases is first prepared. Specifically, the two phases are (i) a continuous framework phase consisting of a thermosetting polymer and (ii) a thermally decomposable phase. By a heat treatment, the former phase turns into a carbon framework, while the latter phase is decomposed and turns into pores. Thus, a 3D ordered carbon is obtained.
On the other hand, the development of alternative pathways for ordered microporous carbons has been a challenge. One of the potential methods is to use organic-based porous crystals such as MOFs as templates or precursors. In 2008, Xu's group reported the use of MOF-5 [Zn4O(OOCC6H4COO)3] as a template.111 Polyfurfuryl alcohol (PFA) was synthesized inside the nanopores of MOF-5, and the composite was carbonized at 1273 K in Ar. Upon the carbonization, ZnO was formed and it turned into Zn (boiling point 1181 K) which can vaporize away. They reported also the use of ZIF-8 as a template.112 However, in both cases, the ordered structures of the MOFs were completely lost in the final carbon products. A direct conversion of MOFs to porous carbons or composite materials was also attempted113,114 and this has become a trend to date.115–124 Nevertheless, none of the studies succeeded in retaining the ordered structures of the precursor crystals. In 2017, our group finally succeeded in converting organic crystals into ordered carbonaceous frameworks (OCFs),125 in which the precursor crystal is used as a self-template as well as a carbon source. Though the resulting OCFs are poorly porous, they possess ordered frameworks together with molecular-derived functional blocks, exhibiting unique electrocatalysis towards selective CO2 reduction. The direct conversion technique can extend the controllability of the framework structures in ordered 3D carbonaceous materials.
The template carbonization was applied also for the production of so-called 3D graphene materials. It should be noted that ZTC consists of nano-sized and curved single-layer graphenes with a 3D ordered network, and thus, it can be considered as the first 3D graphene material. In 2011, Cheng's group126 produced macroporous graphene networks by using Ni foam as a CVD substrate and a 3D template. The specific surface area of the resulting material is ∼850 m2 g−1, which is about 1/3 of the theoretical value of single-layer graphene (2627 m2 g−1), meaning that on average ca. 3 layers of graphene are stacked. In 2016, our group reported mesoporous graphene materials by using Al2O3 nanoparticles as a template.127 Most of the framework consists of single-layer graphenes, and the specific surface area achieved is 1970 m2 g−1. However, these macroporous and mesoporous graphene materials do not have ordered pores. ZTC has been the only graphene-based microporous material with structure regularity.
As is found from Fig. 5, ZTCs were developed at a relatively early stage of the history of template carbonization, and had a great influence on the subsequent research. However, the number of relevant papers is not greater than those of OMCs. This is probably because more skilful techniques are required for the synthesis of ZTCs than for the cases of OMCs. In the following section, the key factors of synthesis conditions are summarized to reveal proper ways to obtain ZTCs with highly ordered structures.
3. Synthesis of ZTC
3.1 Classification of quality
Even when the same zeolite is used as a template, the resulting ZTC structure could greatly vary depending on the synthesis conditions, especially regarding the degree of ordered structure, and the inclusion of non-templated carbon structures. Thus, it is convenient to define the following three types for ZTCs.
Type-I: ZTCs almost solely consisting of the three-dimensionally ordered framework replicated by the zeolite template.
Type-II: A mixture of the Type-I structure and extra carbonaceous components, which are non-templated carbon formed outside of the zeolite template and/or disordered carbon structures formed by a failure of zeolite replication inside the zeolite template.
Type-III: The carbonaceous product that does not (or rarely) contain the Type-I structure. Strictly speaking, Type-III is intrinsically not ZTC, although many researchers use the term ZTC for such disordered materials. Thus, we refer to this group as Type-III in this article.

Fig. 6 illustrates the three types of ZTCs together with their representative preparation schemes shown as (a–l). Examples of TEM images and XRD patterns are given for Types-I, -II, and -III, and criteria for each type are shown in red-colour font. The explanations of individual schemes are mentioned when necessary in the following text. Type-I is obtained only when the synthesis is carefully performed with appropriate conditions, through the route (e)–(g)–(i) in Fig. 6: uniform carbon introduction only inside the zeolite nanochannels (Fig. 6e), heat treatment at more than 1073 K (Fig. 6g), and template removal (Fig. 6i). The framework thus obtained is nano-sized and curved single-layer graphene forming 3D structure regularity as shown in Fig. 4, without stacking of graphenes. The stacking-free framework exhibits a high geometric surface area at least over 2100 m2 g−1.82 A ZTC being Type-I can be judged by the following experimental data:
 Fig. 6  Classification of ZTC quality into Type-I, II, and III, together with their representative preparation schemes. Each preparation step is labelled with (a)–(l). As examples, XRD patterns and TEM images are shown for representative samples of Type-I, -II, and -III. Criteria for each type are shown in red-colour font. 
(1) Equipped with an ordered structure derived from zeolite (showing a sharp XRD peak(s) corresponding to the zeolite d-spacing(s)).
(2) Free from graphene stacking structure (the absence of a carbon 002 XRD peak).
(3) High surface area (>2100 m2 g−1).
When the zeolite ordered-structure is (partially) replicated, Type-II is formed through the route (k–l) in Fig. 6: carbon introduction into the zeolite nanochannels along with the formation of the non-templated carbon and/or the failure of zeolite replication (Fig. 6k) and template removal (Fig. 6l). A ZTC being Type-II can be judged by the following experimental data:
(1) Equipped with an ordered structure derived from the zeolite
(2) Presence of a graphene stacking structure (showing a carbon 002 XRD peak), or low surface area (<2100 m2 g−1)
Type-III is prepared from a variety of pathways (individual pathways are explained in the later sections), and this is the most frequent (in many cases undesired) product in the ZTC synthesis. A ZTC being Type-III can be judged by the following experimental data:
(1) Absence of an obvious ordered structure derived from the zeolite
In the Type-III ZTCs, an XRD pattern often contains a carbon 002 peak, but this is not mandatory.
The unique properties of ZTCs are derived from the nanographene-based ordered frameworks in Type-I (or partially included in Type-II), and Type-III is intrinsically not very much different from other disordered nanoporous carbons. Therefore, the preparation of Type-I or Type-II is desired for the applications utilizing the unique properties of ZTCs.
3.2 Selection of zeolite framework-type
While 235 types of zeolite frameworks are registered up to now (found in the database provided by the International Zeolite Association), it is important to choose an appropriate pore-entrance size as well as the dimensions of pore connectivity for obtaining Type-I ZTCs. Table 1 summarises the different types of zeolites used as templates in the ever reported ZTC syntheses. The pore-entrance of a zeolite can be simplified by a Si–O–Si ring, and its size is generally classified by the number of oxygen atoms included. Table 1 lists the largest pore entrance size and the dimensions of the pore network which are connected through the largest pore entrance.

It is found that Type-I and -II can be obtained only by using zeolites with a 3D pore network of oxygen 12-membered rings, i.e. BEA,16,18,46,53,70,72,76,81,87,103,128–137 EMT,19,26,27,35,42,48,53,135,138–145 and FAU.2,4,8–10,12–14,17,20–23,25,27–29,31,33,34,36–38,43–69,71–75,77,82,84,86–95,103,104,128,134,135,141,145–218 MFI zeolite has a 3D pore network of oxygen 10-membered rings, but only Type-III has been obtained [(a) in Fig. 6].128,130,132,134,137,219–225 Thus, it is found that oxygen 10-membered rings are not large enough to build a robust 3D framework without pore-blocking at the carbon introduction step into the zeolite.5 Also, other zeolites with oxygen 6, 8, and 10-membered rings cannot produce Type-I and Type-II regardless of pore dimension, as found from the results of AEL,79 CHA,79,226,227 HEU,228,229 IWT,230 JNT,231 LTA,15,135,230 MTN,232 and MWW83,164,233–235 in Table 1. The dimension of the pore network is another critical factor. As found in zeolite AFI,236 LTL,103,130,135 and MOR,130,134 the zeolite ordered-structure can never be replicated by the 1D pore network even when the pore-entrance size is large enough [(b) in Fig. 6b]. Also, the 2D pore network of oxygen 12-membered rings would yield Type-III, although there has been no report.
As discussed above, a zeolite template must possess a 3D pore network linked through pore entrances over oxygen 12-membered rings to obtain Type-I or Type-II ZTCs. Except for the already-reported ones (BEA, EMT, and FAU), promising candidates are BEC, BSV, CLO, IFT, IFU, IRR, IRY, ISV, ITV, IWS, POS, RWY, SAO, SBS, and SBT. If any of the above zeolites can satisfy other necessary requirements (Si/Al ratio and heat-stability) described later, new types of ZTCs can probably be obtained. Among these candidates, only FAU and BEA are commercially available presently. Further, FAU yields ZTCs with a higher degree of structure order, because BEA intrinsically contains a disordered moiety. Thus, FAU has been the most popularly used for the production of ZTCs so far. EMT can also yield ZTCs with a high degree of structure order, though it is not commercially available. As is found in Table 1, Type-I ZTCs obtained by using FAU and EMT achieve very high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas (SBET) over 4000 m2 g−1.
Most of the commercial synthetic zeolites are not very cheap, and therefore, inexpensive zeolite templates have also been explored. Natural zeolites generally do not possess large pore-entrance sizes, and, consequently, Type-III ZTCs are obtained.85,228,229,237 Another approach is to synthesize large-pore zeolites from inexpensive sources such as fly ash and clay.60,61
Apart from replicating the zeolite ordered-structure, the zeolite-template approach can yield also single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs)236,238 and carbon nanodots showing luminescence properties.135,226,227,230,231,239
3.3 Si/Al ratio of the zeolite
Zeolites have been widely used as solid acid catalysts. The origin of the acidic sites is substituted Al in their frameworks. During long-term use, the acidic sites are gradually covered by the deposition of polycyclic aromatic compounds called coke, and catalytic activity becomes degraded. This is called poisoning. In the ZTC synthesis, the catalysis for generating coke is positively used for carbon deposition inside the nanochannels of zeolite by CVD. Thus, relatively low Si/Al ratio (high Al content) is required for ZTC synthesis. In our experience, Si/Al less than 20 gives good results.
3.4 Cation type of the zeolite
A zeolite Al site has a negative charge, and is balanced by a counter cation. The catalysis of zeolite highly depends on the cation type. For the catalyst applications of zeolites, a proton (H) is often used due to its high acidity. For ZTC synthesis, however, H-type zeolite is a little difficult to handle. As described in 3.6, when a common carbon source, furfuryl alcohol (FA), is attached to H-type zeolite, FA is immediately polymerized, and pore blocking occurs, resulting in insufficient impregnation of the zeolite with FA. H-type zeolite is often too active also for CVD, and is likely to form non-templated carbon deposition on the outer surface of the zeolite particles, yielding Type-II ZTCs.14,82,146 Nevertheless, Type-II ZTCs with high surface area (SBET = 2750 m2 g−1) can be obtained if the Si/Al ratio is relatively high (∼20) and CVD conditions are properly selected.72
The NH4-type zeolite has less activity than H-type, and it is possible to be homogeneously impregnated with FA. When NH4-type zeolite is heated, NH4 cations are decomposed to release NH3 and the zeolite turns to H-type. Thus, appropriate CVD conditions should be almost the same as those for H-type zeolite. In addition, the NH4 cation could be a nitrogen (N) source, yielding N-doped ZTCs.87,147 Although Type-I and -II ZTCs have not been synthesized using NH4-type zeolites,21,22,37,44,46,50,59,65,87,134,147,153,163,171,186,190,240 Type-II ZTCs with high surface area can be prepared in our laboratory (unpublished data).
Na-Type zeolite is commercially available and has been the most popularly used for its moderate catalytic activity which allows homogeneous FA impregnation as well as uniform carbon deposition during CVD. With appropriate conditions, Type-I with a very high SBET (>4000 m2 g−1) can be obtained.138,151 An XRD pattern and a TEM image of the Type-I ZTC8 are shown in the inset of Fig. 6. There is almost no carbon deposition formed on the outer surface of zeolite particles.8,11 Not only Na, but also other alkali metals and alkaline earth metals can work well. Webley's group reported the production of Type-II ZTCs from zeolite Y with different cations (Na, K, and Ca) by propylene CVD.14 Zhao's group reported a Type-II ZTC with high SBET (3331 m2 g−1) by using CaX zeolite.54 Besides, Ryoo's group reported that the CaX zeolite shows larger carbon uptake for CVD with N2/ethylene/H2O flow than NaX zeolite, yielding a Type-II ZTC with a high surface area (SBET = 2770 m2 g−1).217 While Na- and K-type zeolites can be easily removed by hydrofluoric acid (HF), Ca-type yields insoluble CaF2. Thus, in the case of Ca-type zeolite, not only HF but also HCl wash is necessary to remove CaF2.
Other metal cations also have been investigated. Ryoo's group reported that La-type zeolites (BEA, EMT, and FAU) can yield Type-I ZTCs by ethylene CVD.135 Mokaya's group used Pt-type zeolite as a template, and prepared Type-II ZTCs containing well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles.35 On the other hand, zeolites containing transition metal cations such as Ni2+ and Co2+ function as catalysts for CNT growth241,242 upon CVD, being not appropriate as templates for ZTCs.
3.5 Heat-stability of the zeolite
To replicate the zeolite ordered-structure, a carbon framework formed inside the zeolite nanochannels has to be strengthened by a post high-temperature treatment at least above 1073 K [(g) and (k) in Fig. 6],146,218 and preferably above 1123 K in our experience. Therefore, the zeolite template needs to be stable up to 1073–1123 K when its nanochannels contain carbon. Note that zeolite thermal stability is slightly improved up to ca. 1173–1273 K, by the incorporation of carbon. Above the upper limit temperature of the zeolite, only Type-III ZTCs are obtained [(h) in Fig. 6] as mentioned in 3.7.
3.6 Carbon introduction methods into zeolites
There are the following three major methods for carbon introduction into zeolite nanochannels:

(1) Impregnation-carbonization method. 
In this method, an organic monomer(s) is introduced into zeolite channels, and it is polymerized to form a polymer/zeolite composite. Since zeolite catalysis can convert most of the organic compounds into polymers and then into carbonaceous substances, it is possible to use a variety of monomers including the ones which are not used for general polymer synthesis. In addition, polymerization without zeolite catalysis is also possible, for example by the irradiation of γ-rays to acrylonitrile monomers in zeolite channels.4 The monomer introduction can be achieved via vapour148,156,212,213 or liquid phases. As for the latter, a variety of monomers has been examined thus far: FA,4 acrylonitrile,4 phenol-formaldehyde,103 vinyl acetate,128 pyrene,128 sucrose,153 poly(styrene sulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) sodium salt,210 poly(styrene-co-maleic acid) partial isobutyl/methyl mixed ester,210 ethylenediamine,75,164 2-thiophenemethanol,143 lignin,87,134 pitch,87 glucose,198 and an ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate (EMIT).94 Among the monomers reported so far, FA has been the most popular. Liquid FA is easily introduced into zeolite channels with a vacuum impregnation technique. Extra FA remaining outside of the zeolite can be removed by a solvent with a larger molecular size than the pore-entrance size of the zeolite, for example mesitylene for FAU zeolite.4 A mild annealing at 423 K can polymerize FA into polyfurfuryl alcohol (PFA) inside the zeolite nanochannels by zeolite acid catalysis. However, the carbon yield of polymers upon carbonization inside the zeolite is relatively low (ca. 30 wt%), and the resulting carbon loading amount is not large enough (usually < 15 wt%) to build a robust framework which can retain the zeolite ordered structure upon the template removal. Thus, this impregnation-carbonization method usually generates Type-III ZTCs through the route (c–d) in Fig. 6: insufficient carbon introduction (Fig. 6c) and template removal (Fig. 6d).


(2) CVD. 
CVD4,103 is an essential process to introduce a large enough amount of carbon into the zeolite to obtain Type-I and -II ZTCs. Since the zeolite pore-entrance size is narrowed by the carbon deposition, CVD source molecules should be very small. For example, styrene132 and benzene175 are too large. The synthesis of Type-II ZTCs has been reported using methane,193 ethylene,27 propylene,130 butylene,14 and acetonitrile (AN).16,132 Type-I ZTCs can be obtained with acetylene CVD simply by a single step on a commercial zeolite.150 Moreover, a two-step CVD at different temperatures can yield Type-I ZTCs with high surface areas (up to 3370 m2 g−1).150 Ryoo's group reported that Type-I and -II ZTCs can be easily synthesized by introducing a small amount of water-vapour during a CVD process using AN136 or ethylene217 as a source gas. Also, they have discovered that ion-exchange of zeolites with La135 or Ca217 is effective to easily produce Type-I and -II ZTCs by ethylene-CVD.
As described in Section 3.3, zeolite catalysis for coke deposition is necessary for homogeneous carbon deposition. With the zeolite catalysis, the CVD source gas is decomposed and turned into carbon inside the zeolite nanochannels. A key point of the CVD process is the selection of temperature. Each CVD source gas has its thermal decomposition temperature above which the gas turns into carbon (soot) in the gas phase even without any catalyst. For example, the decomposition temperatures of acetylene and propylene are ca. 923 K and 1023 K, respectively. Above the decomposition temperature, carbon is deposited not only inside but also on the outside of the zeolite particles, giving rise to the formation of Type-II ZTCs containing non-templated carbon deposition. Accordingly, the CVD temperature should be lower than the decomposition temperature to obtain Type-I ZTCs. By such CVD conditions, polycyclic aromatic compounds are generated inside the zeolite nanochannels, whereas they are not robustly connected to each other yet.218 Therefore, upon the template removal, Type-III ZTCs are formed (the route (e–f) in Fig. 6). Above 1073–1123 K, the polycyclic aromatic compounds are condensed to form a continuous carbon framework which can retain the ordered structure of the zeolite even upon the zeolite removal.218 Thus, a CVD process needs to be followed by a high-temperature heat treatment (<1073–1123 K) when the CVD temperature is below 1073 K. The one-step carbon introduction by CVD can produce Type-I ZTCs although the SBET is not as high as those obtained by the following two-step method. For mass production, CVD is advantageous.135,214,217


(3) Two-step method. 
This method is the combination of (1) and (2). In most of the cases, FA is used for (1), and the subsequent CVD is performed with acetylene,166 ethylene,27 propylene,9 butylene,173 benzene,154 or AN149 as a source gas. Also, some combinations have been reported: (1) lignin and (2) acetylene,134 and (1) methanol and (2) 2-methylfuran.137 Type-I ZTCs with SBET over 4000 m2 g−1 have been synthesized only by using the two-step method,138,151 probably because of very uniform carbon introduction throughout the zeolite particles.

3.7 Porosity development methods
One of the advantages of ZTCs is their large surface areas as well as uniform and ordered micropores. However, the porosity actually varies depending on the preparation method and additional activation. Herein, several methods for porosity development are summarized.

(1) Zeolite replication. 
This is the most straightforward method to develop micropores in the ZTC synthesis, and a proper replication yields Type-I ZTCs. Fig. 4 shows the framework structure of this type of ZTC.11 The porosity accords with the space which was originally occupied by the zeolite framework, and therefore, an ordered microporous network with uniform size (typically ca. 1.2 nm) can be obtained, and the entire porosity should consist of micropores (micropore volume is ca. 1.8–1.9 cm3 g−1)11,138,151 The highest SBET achieved in this type of ZTC is ∼4000 m2 g−1.138,151
The ordered microporosity can be formed also in the case of Type-II, though it may contain non-uniform pores. Additionally, a non-templated carbon deposition is almost non-porous and lowers its porosity. When zeolite replication (mostly) fails, Type-III ZTCs are formed. The porosity of such a ZTC is significantly disordered, and not distinguishable from ordinary porous carbons like activated carbons.


(2) Thermal collapse of the zeolite. 
When a carbon/zeolite composite is heat-treated above the stability limit temperature of the zeolite (1173–1273 K), the zeolite is transformed into a disordered framework which still functions as a template for generating disordered nanopores. Thus, Type-III ZTCs can be obtained by removing the template (Fig. 6h).21,22,63,147,153,163,186 This method easily provides highly porous carbons: the SBET can be as high as 3683 m2 g−1.147


(3) Activation of ZTCs. 
When the original ZTCs are Type-II and -III which are not highly porous, activation can improve the porosity. Thus, the activation of ZTCs has been reported with CO2,75 KOH,25,31,44,75,137 and H3PO4.44 Nevertheless, the highest SBET reported so far is 3064 m2 g−1,31 still not as high as the maximum in Type-I ZTCs (∼4000 m2 g−1). The activation process involves oxidative gasification of a carbon framework to form CO and CO2, resulting in the destruction of the carbonaceous framework depending on the degree of activation. Thus, the activated ZTCs are likely to be Type-III [(j) in Fig. 6]. Note that activation of a Type-I ZTC is not effective, because it already has a fully porous framework (Fig. 4), and oxidative gasification of the framework results in a decrease of the surface area owing to restacking of graphenes. Moreover, the Type-I ZTC framework is not very stable at a temperature used for activation (>873 K). Type-I ZTC is stable up to ca. 673 K,91 and its porosity is gradually decreased along with the temperature above 673 K [(j) in Fig. 6].
Among the methods (1) to (3) described above, (1) for highly porous Type-I/-II ZTCs can yield materials which are equipped with a unique nanographene-based framework like the one shown in Fig. 4. Moreover, Type-I/-II ZTCs which are properly synthesized can achieve high porosity with a surface area over 3000 m2 g−1. On the other hand, the advantages of the methods (2) and (3) are ease of preparation and the introduction of significant mesoporosity. However, the resulting carbons are not greatly different from highly activated carbons which have very high SBET (>3000 m2 g−1) as well as a significant mesoporosity.

4. Structure of ZTC and its extension
4.1 Atomistic structure of Type-I ZTC
Although the first ZTC was reported as early as in 1997,4,103 the atomistic structure of Type-I ZTC has been unknown over the years. In 2006, Roussel et al. proposed framework models which have tube-like closed graphene frameworks and resemble Mackay crystals or carbon Schwarzites.158,161 However, their models consist of too many carbon atoms. When their models are embedded in FAU zeolite, the carbon content (wc) becomes 0.62–0.73 g-carbon g−1-zeolite, and these values are far larger than those for the case of a typical Type-I ZTC (0.29 g g−1). Ryoo's group also proposed a similar framework model for Type-I ZTC, but such a tubular framework needs too many carbon atoms and is inconsistent with the measured wc value (0.30 g g−1) of their Type-I ZTC.135 In 2009, we proposed that a structure consisting of an open-graphene framework rather than closed tubular ones can realize a stable 3D network with a realistic number of carbon atoms (wc = 0.29 g g−1).8 Most recently, we have updated the structure model with the one shown in Fig. 4, as a more realistic model including disordered and irregular structures.11 Curved and non-stacked graphene fragments are connected along the ordered zeolite nanochannels, forming a long-range structure order. The framework contains a diverse range of carbon polygons such as hexagons, heptagons and octagons, while pentagons are minor. The presence of carbon heptagons and octagons resembles Mackay crystals and carbon Schwarzites.
4.2 ZTC as a 3D graphene material
The 3D framework consisting of single-layer graphene without stacking is valuable to achieve a high surface area. Fig. 7 summarizes geometric (theoretical) and measured surface areas of representative nanocarbons: C60, SWCNT, graphene, and ZTC. Their morphologies are 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D, respectively. The outside surface area of a single C60 molecule is as high as 2625 m2 g−1, whereas C60 actually forms an fcc crystal and its surface area is almost 0 m2 g−1, because most of the molecular surface is hidden inside the crystal. SWCNT also has a high outside surface area depending on its diameter. For example, SWCNTs with 1 nm and 3 nm diameter have geometric surface areas of 1760 and 1460 m2 g−1, respectively. However, the measured values are at most ca. 1000 m2 g−1,243 because of bundling. Graphene is also well known to have a high geometric surface area of 2627 m2 g−1, whereas the measured value is ca. 700 m2 g−1 because of stacking.244 Thus, 0D, 1D, and 2D structures inevitably cause unfavourable surface loss. To fully expose the entire surface of graphene, a self-standing open 3D framework is necessary, and ZTC does realize this ideal. The high geometric surface area of ZTC (3707 m2 g−1) exceeding the value of graphene (2627 m2 g−1) is because of the significant contribution of the edge planes.5Fig. 8 illustrates the geometric surface areas of graphene (Fig. 8a), polycyclic aromatic compounds (Fig. 8b and c), and one benzene molecule (Fig. 8d). For infinitely large graphene, the contribution of edge planes can be ignored, whereas it becomes significant at nano-sized graphenes. As shown in Fig. 8b–d, the specific surface area increases with decreasing graphene-domain size because of the increasing contribution of the edge plane. Indeed, the width of the ZTC graphene framework is ca. 1 nm, similar to coronene (Fig. 8c), although the ZTC framework is continuous (like ribbon) and the geometric surface area is lower than that of coronene. Unlike other low dimensional nanocarbons, ZTC with a 3D graphene framework is free from graphene aggregation/stacking, and the experimentally measured surface area (3730 m2 g−1 by the subtracting pore effect method245) is almost the same as the geometric one.

Recently, so-called “3D graphene” or “porous graphene” materials have been intensively investigated.126,246–253 However, most of them have a much lower surface area (<1000 m2 g−1) than the geometric value (2627 m2 g−1) because of the graphene stacking.
The 3D graphene framework inherits the mechanical elasticity and strength of graphene,254 even in the form of a nanoporous material. The bulk modulus of Type-I ZTC is 0.51 GPa, much lower than that of zeolite (13 GPa) and MOF ZIF-8 (9.2 GPa).183 Thus, ZTC is mechanically very soft, and it is possible to precisely control the average micropore size by hot pressing (Fig. 9).159 Moreover, ZTC can be reversibly compressed/recovered by mechanical force like a plastic sponge. By using such elastic nanoporous materials, we have proposed an advanced adsorption control as shown in Fig. 10.183 By loading mechanical force to a nanoporous material, the nanopores are contracted, and the physisorption potential is increased, which is expected to enhance molecular adsorption (from Fig. 10a to b). Further contraction results in reducing the adsorption amount (from Fig. 10b to c). When the applied force is gradually released, the nanopores and the corresponding adsorption amount are recovered up to the original state (from Fig. 10c, b, and to a). We have indeed demonstrated a part of this idea using ZTC183 and also using a graphene mesosponge,127 which is another 3D graphene material with significant elasticity.

4.3 Structure variation of Type-I ZTC
In the Type-I ZTC with very high SBET (∼4000 m2 g−1), wc (the amount of carbon introduced in 1 g of zeolite) is 0.29 g g−1.8 This is almost the minimal carbon introduction amount which can retain a self-standing ordered framework. In other words, such a ZTC comprises the thinnest nanographene framework. When wc is increased, the framework becomes thicker and surface area decreases. Instead, electric conductivity is increased.77
We have tried to introduce carbon into FAU zeolite as much as possible by means of a pressure-pulsed CVD, and found that 0.54 g g−1 is almost the achievable upper limit which can be introduced inside zeolite nanochannels.82 In this case, Type-II ZTC is obtained, and it consists of a crosslinked fullerene-like framework (Fig. 11) formed inside zeolite nanochannels, and a thick outside carbon shell. SBET of only the fullerene-like framework was measured to be 1950 m2 g−1, close to the corresponding geometric value (2100 m2 g−1).

4.4 Chemical modification
Type-I ZTC possesses about 10-times larger amount of edge sites than conventional activated carbons.84 Moreover, the edge sites of ZTC are more reactive than those of other carbon materials.84 Thus, chemical modification of ZTCs has been investigated so far by means of oxygen-plasma treatment,33 modified hydroboration,91 sulfonation,182 fluorination,195 and bromination.200
Chemical modification is possible not only directly on ZTCs, but also on their precursors, i.e. carbon/zeolite composites. We have revealed that many of the carbon edge sites are not terminated by hydrogen and exist as dangling bonds at the stage of the carbon/zeolite composite.218 Thus, it is possible to modify such dangling bonds, for example by a high-temperature gas treatment with H2218 and H2S.70 Note that the dangling bonds are naturally terminated by oxygen-functional groups when they are exposed to O2 and/or H2O upon template removal. Thus, ZTCs usually contain a relatively large amount of oxygen (O), about 6–9 wt%.8,218
While the chemical modification is often too harsh for the ZTC framework, electrochemical modification proceeds under milder conditions, enabling the retention of the ordered framework. Berenguer et al. reported that the edge sites of ZTCs are effectively oxidized by electrochemical oxidation in an aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 12).181 Moreover, our group have revealed that the electrochemical oxidation in H2SO4 can introduce a large amount of quinone-type groups showing a large pseudocapacitance (∼500 F g−1; see Section 5.5.2) with a high selectivity of ca. 36%, compared to the case of conventional chemical oxidation on activated carbon (ca. 5.2%).84 González et al. demonstrated the electrochemical functionalization of ZTC with aminobenzene acids in an aqueous electrolyte.90 Furthermore, our group have reported that ZTC edge sites can be oxidized also in an organic electrolyte, and redox active quinone and furan-type ether groups can be introduced to exhibit a large pseudocapacitance of up to ∼330 F g−1 (see Section 5.5.3).

4.5 Heteroatom doping
The function of ZTC can be extended also by heteroatom-doping. Not only O-doping mentioned above, but also doping by other heteroatoms such as nitrogen (N), boron (B), and sulfur (S) has been reported.

4.5.1 N-Doping. 
There have been many reports on N-doping into ZTCs.12,16,18,23,50,71,73,87,91,132,136,140,145,147,149,156,161,180,219,232,234 The N-doped ZTCs prepared by different methods are listed in Table 2. Su et al. synthesized N-doped ZTCs simply by using NH4-type zeolite as a template and a N source in 2004.147 They applied the impregnation-carbonization method with FA as a carbon source, and Type-III ZTCs were obtained. Regarding the impregnation-carbonization method, our group used acrylonitrile in 1997,103 Garsuch et al. used pyrrole,156 and Ruiz et al. used lignin.87

Mokaya's group used AN as a N-containing CVD source on BEA zeolite, and obtained Type-II ZTCs doped with N in 2005.16,132 The similar AN-CVD has been applied to FAU and MET zeolites by Portet et al.73 and Wang et al.,145 respectively. Ryoo's groups have reported that the mixture gas of AN and H2O vapor can also yield Type-II ZTC.136
Our group developed the two-step method using FA and AN as a primal carbon source and a N-containing CVD source, respectively, to obtain the first Type-I ZTCs doped with N in 2005.149 Ania et al. also reported a two-step method consisting of polymerization of acrylonitrile (ACN) in zeolite, followed by propylene CVD, and obtained Type-II ZTC doped with N.71 As is found from Table 2, the N content is ca. 3–7, and SBET varies in the range of ca. 900–3700 m2 g−1.
N-Doping is effective to improve hydrophilicity,149 electric conductivity,91 electrochemical capacitance,71,87 and electrocatalysis for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR),94,136 while it is not effective to enhance H2 physisorption at room temperature.23


4.5.2 BN-Doping. 
The introduction of B into porous carbons is generally difficult, because B has an unoccupied orbital and is very likely to react with O, which usually exists in chemical/physical activation processes. Thus, there have been only three reports on ZTCs as shown in Table 3, and all of them are accompanied with N-doping.

Wang et al. reported the introduction of B and N into ZTC via a post-treatment of Type-I ZTC with B2O3 and NH3 at 1423 K. By the harsh treatment, the ordered structure was totally destroyed, and the resulting BN-doped ZTC was Type-III. Nevertheless, the BN-doped ZTC exhibited enhanced hydrogen storage through a spillover mechanism induced by Ru nanoparticles (see Section 5.2). Our group fabricated Type-I BN-doped ZTC by a modified hydroboration using dimethylamine borane (DMAB) as a BN-source.91 Most of the B was doped in the form of –B(OH)2, and we found that the –B(OH)2 group has no enhancement effect on the electrochemical property of ZTC. Furthermore, our group synthesized Type-II BN-doped ZTCs with high surface areas using an ionic liquid, EMIT, as a BN source (Fig. 13). Compared with N-doped ZTC, BN-doped ZTC exhibited better catalysis for the ORR, whereas BN-doping was found to be less effective in increasing the electrochemical capacitance than N-doping.

4.5.3 S-Doping. 
S-Doping has been also reported in several different ways as listed in Table 4. Xia et al. synthesized Type-II ZTCs doped with S by a two-step method in which EMT zeolite impregnated with 2-thiophenemethanol (2TM) was heat-treated, followed by ethylene-CVD.143 They have reported that S-doped ZTCs exhibited enhanced heat of adsorption for H2 and CO2. Fukuhara et al. introduced –SO3H groups into ZTCs by a post-treatment with chlorosulfuric acid (CSA).182 The resulting sulfonated ZTCs (Type-III) exhibited enhanced catalysis for hydrolysis of cellobiose and the Beckmann rearrangement. Choi et al. synthesized highly S-doped (17 wt%) ZTC by using a gas mixture of acetylene/H2S for CVD at 823 K on NaX zeolite, followed by a heat-treatment in a gas mixture of He/H2S at 1073 K.215 A large amount of S sites can accommodate Pt to achieve its high dispersion (Fig. 14), and the Pt-loaded S-doped ZTC exhibited a unique electrocatalysis for the ORR. A similar method has been reported also by Martínez de Yuso et al.70 A propylene-CVD was performed at 973 K on zeolite Hβ, and then the gas was switched to pure H2S for S-doping. They reported that S-doping was effective for hydrogen and CO2 storage, as was reported also by Xia et al.

4.6 Composites
The introduction of other substances into the nanochannels of ZTCs has been investigated to extend the versatility of ZTCs as follows.
Metal: Pt,17,19,20,23,28,33,35,43,48,57,69,154,174,177,178,188,191,208,209,215 Pt–Ru,192 Cu,211 Co,211 Fe,211 Ru,19,26 Ni,19 Pd,20,38,51 Ir,20,178 Rh,20,178 and Ag.20,178
Metal oxide: TiO2189 and Fe3O4.222,223,225
Others: LiBH4,62 sulfur,216 and quinone molecules.203
ZTCs decorated with metal nanoparticles have been applied to methanol oxidation,154,174,192 the ORR,177,188,208,209 separation,211 hydrogen storage,17,19 and catalytic hydrogenation,191 and exhibited superior performances to conventional materials due to their highly developed porosity and good mass transport property. While it is easy to disperse small metal nanoparticles (3–6 nm) in ZTC by using conventional metal-loading methods,19,154 anchor site introduction (Fig. 14)215 or the use of an organometallic complex as a metal source (Fig. 15)69 can achieve subnanocluster dispersion and even single-atom dispersion. A TiO2/ZTC composite showed superior photocatalysis due to the excellent adsorption capacity of ZTC, and Fe3O4/ZTC composites could be used as adsorbents which can be easily collected by a magnet.222,223,225 LiBH4 confined in ZTC nanopores showed better cyclability for hydrogen storage than bulk LiBH4.62 Sulfur-loaded (46 wt%) ZTC functioned as a cathode for Li–S batteries.216 Nueangnoraj et al. assembled a stable organic proton battery by using ZTCs loaded with two different types of quinones as positive and negative electrodes.203

When preparing ZTC-based composites, it is necessary to be careful about the stability of ZTC at the compositing process. Type-I ZTC is thermally stable up to 673 K under inert atmosphere despite the desorption of thermally weak oxygen-functional groups,91 whereas the ZTC framework gradually collapses above 673 K. In our experience, ZTC is not very stable in basic media and also in oxidizing conditions. The compositing conditions need to be selected to avoid the structure collapse of ZTC as much as possible.
4.7 Exterior shape
The control of exterior shape is important for most applications. In principle, the particle shape of ZTC accords with that of its template. As shown in Fig. 16, the bulk shapes of the zeolite templates are well transferred to those of the corresponding ZTCs.155 Moreover, if the zeolite template is molded into a certain shape, it is transferred into the resulting ZTC. According to this mechanism, a variety of exterior shapes have been reported: spherical beads,131 pellet,64,160 thin film,80 core–shell particles composed of a ZTC core and mesoporous shell,185,190 monolithic foam,220 and various forms of monoliths.201

Pelletization is possible also by direct pressing of ZTC powder with163 and without159,171 binders (Fig. 17). For many applications, not only gravimetric surface area, e.g. SBET [m2 g−1], but also volumetric surface area, Sv [m2 cm−3], is of great importance.

v can be calculated by the following equation: Sv = Sgρ(1)where Sg [m2 g−1] and ρ [g cm−3] are gravimetric surface area and density of pellet, respectively. There are several different methods to obtain Sg, and BET surface area (SBET) is most popularly used as Sg. For obtaining the Sv of a powdery sample, tap density is used for ρ. Indeed, the reported Sv values of pelletized ZTCs in the literature are found to be calculated from SBET and ρ (Table 5). However, the density of the pellet (ρ) is often significantly overestimated, causing overestimation of Sv. This can be revealed by calculating the theoretical maximum volumetric surface area (Sv-max) based on SBET and the theoretical maximum density (ρmax) as follows. Sv-max = SBETρmax(2)In MOFs, the crystallographic density is used to calculate ρmax.255 In non-crystalline materials including ZTCs, ρmax can be calculated by the following equation: (3)where Vtotal [cm3 g−1] is a total pore volume determined by gas adsorption measurement, e.g. N2 adsorption, on the pelletized sample, and ρtrue [g cm−3] is the true density of the pellet excluding its pore volume as well as any spaces inside the pellet. Note that Vtotal can include only the volume of pores which are less than ca. 100 nm. If the porous material includes large macropores (>100 nm), Vtotal underestimates the pore volume, resulting in the overestimation of ρmax. However, Type-I ZTC is intrinsically microporous, and other types of ZTCs are usually not macroporous, too. Thus, eqn (3) works well for ZTCs. The value of ρtrue can be practically determined as a He density, and the ρtrue of ZTC has been reported to be 1.5–1.9 g cm−3.23,64ρmax is actually an apparent density of a ZTC particle having the properties of ρtrue and Vtotal. If ZTC particles are compacted to be a pellet without any additional inter-particle spaces, the density of the pellet becomes ρmax. In other words, ρmax is the upper limit of the packing density. Actual pellets contain some amount of inter-particle spaces which are too large to be evaluated by N2 physisorption, and therefore, the actual ρ of pellets always becomes smaller than ρmax. Thus, Sv has to be smaller than Sv-max. As found from Table 5, the reported ρ and Sv exceed the theoretical upper limits (ρmax and Sv-max), and it is found that they are overestimated. This may be caused by the underestimation of the pellet volume. One probable reason for this underestimation is the remarkable flexibility of ZTC (see Section 4.2).183 If the pellet volume is measured under loading force, the volume can be smaller than that at a force-free condition. The actual Sv values achieved by ZTC pelletization seem to be at most ∼1200 m2 cm−3.

4.8 Synthesis of other materials by using ZTC
ZTCs or their precursors (carbon/zeolite composites) are useful also for the synthesis of other functional materials. Schlienger et al. synthesized boron nitride-based porous materials by using ZTC as a template.256 Though the ordered structure was lost, the resulting materials exhibited a high SBET (570 m2 g−1).256 Asgarian et al. reacted ZTC with boron oxide and magnesium to prepare nanostructured boron carbide.221 Moreover, Nourbakhsh224,257 and Shcherban et al.258 converted carbon/zeolite composites into silicon carbides.
5. Applications of ZTC
ZTCs have been used for a variety of applications. The relevant literature is summarized in this section. For each application, introductive statements are provided for the minimal necessary background to help readers to grasp the significance of ZTCs in the individual fields.
5.1 Adsorbents
Type-I or II ZTCs have been examined for the removal of monoaromatic compounds165,169 and pharmaceutical antibiotics.167 Compared to microporous activated carbons, ZTCs exhibit faster adsorption/desorption kinetics and a larger normalized adsorption amount per surface area because of their three-dimensional ordered pore network and good pore accessibility.165 The adsorption properties of Type-III ZTCs have been also examined,153,213,235,237 whereas their advantages are not very clear because of the random pore structures similar to those of activated carbons. For bulky applications, e.g. water treatment, a large amount of adsorbent is required with a very low material price. Rather than such purposes, ZTCs would be advantageous for more specific applications in which ZTCs are distinguished from other adsorbents regarding their ordered pore network and/or uniform pore size.
5.2 Hydrogen storage
From the developed microporosity of ZTCs, physisorption-based hydrogen storage has been investigated by many researchers.12–70 The detailed background of hydrogen storage in nanoporous materials can be found in some excellent review papers.259–261

5.2.1 Measurement and data analysis. 
Before mentioning the relevant literature, it is important to know the background of measurement techniques and data analysis as well as interpretation. There are two major measurement techniques, gravimetric and volumetric using a microbalance and a Sieverts apparatus, respectively. For the measurement below 1 bar of hydrogen pressure, conventional volumetric adsorption apparatuses (Sieverts type) have been commonly used. For high-pressure examination, both gravimetric and volumetric methods are found in the literature, while the Japanese Standards Association has adopted the volumetric method (JIS H 7201) due to its accuracy and reliability. Temperature has a great impact on the physisorption amount, and hydrogen storage data have been reported mainly in the following two temperature regions: liquid-nitrogen temperature (77 K) and ambient temperature (273–353 K). Cryogenic hydrogen storage at 77 K is potentially expected for mass-transfer of hydrogen, for example transportation for hydrogen stations, which is presently done by liquid hydrogen trailers. On the other hand, hydrogen storage around ambient temperature is required for ubiquitous applications including fuel cell vehicles (FCVs).262 At both temperatures, a large storage amount is achieved in a high-pressure range, and therefore, the high-pressure data are highlighted here.
Particular attention has to be paid to the two different expressions of hydrogen storage amount: surface excess amount (Mex [g-H2 g−1]) and total storage amount (Mtotal [g-H2 g−1]). The former is the net increase from bulk hydrogen-gas concentration by the interaction with adsorbent. The surface excess amount is measured experimentally. The total storage amount is the sum of Mex and hydrogen gas existing in the pore of the material without interaction, and is expressed by the following equation. Mtotal = Mex + ρH2Vtotal(4)where ρH2 [g-H2 cm−3] and Vtotal [cm3 g−1] are density of bulk hydrogen gas and total pore volume of the porous material, respectively. Thus, Mtotal is always larger than Mex. In the previous literature for high-pressure hydrogen storage in ZTCs, the storage amount data were often shown without any description, often causing misunderstanding. For fundamental discussion on hydrogen adsorption associated with material properties, Mex is more meaningful, and Mtotal is of importance for practical use.


5.2.2 Cryogenic hydrogen storage in ZTC. 

Fig. 18 shows Mex of several different types of materials including ZTCs, measured at 77 K and 20 bar, plotted against micropore volume (Vmicro) of the materials. The relation between material properties and cryogenic high-pressure hydrogen adsorption amount has been thoroughly investigated on ZTCs already,12,16,18,22,25,27,29,31,34–37,42,45,46,51–56,58,64,67 and it has been revealed that Mex depends on Vmicro (or also roughly on SBET) almost regardless of the type of ZTCs.37,43,58,67 This is a common tendency also in other porous materials including activated carbons, zeolites, and MOFs.58,259 Indeed, a good correlation can be seen in the data obtained by the volumetric method regardless of the type of material and the presence of metal in Fig. 18. Thus, ZTC with developed microporosity is advantageous for cryogenic hydrogen storage compared to mesoporous materials. On the other hand, the data obtained by the gravimetric method diverges upwards in Fig. 18, suggesting the tendency of overestimation and/or large measurement errors.
 Fig. 18  Literature data on surface excess amounts (Mex) of H2 at 77 K and 20 bar, which are plotted against micropore volume (Vmicro). Reference numbers are shown besides each plot. In the references associated with an asterisk, only Mtotal is found, and therefore, Mex is calculated using eqn (4). Blank and solid symbols are for the data measured by the gravimetric and volumetric methods, respectively. Circle, square, triangle, and diamond symbols are for ZTCs, metal-doped ZTCs, activated carbons, and MOFs, respectively. An approximation line for the data obtained by the volumetric method is shown. 
The van der Waals interactions of hydrogen molecules with adsorbents is very weak, and its noticeable enhancement by the chemical structure of adsorbents is unfortunately not expected even at cryogenic conditions, in porous carbon materials. Indeed, chemical functionalities like N-containing groups have been revealed to be not effective.25 Though there have been some reports on enhanced hydrogen storage by Pt28,35,43 and Pd51 through the hydrogen spillover mechanism at 77 K, the occurrence of hydrogen spillover at such a low temperature seems to be actually difficult.17,20 Spillover is a well-known phenomenon in porous materials doped with metal nanoparticles such as Ru, Pt, and Ni.19 H2 molecules are dissociatively adsorbed on the metal surface (chemisorption), and atomic hydrogens (H radicals) migrate to the support materials. The migration step is called spillover.263,264 At 77 K, however, chemisorption does not occur on Pt. Moreover, the spillover-based storage amount is decreased with decreasing temperature,57,265 and it is estimated to become negligible at 77 K. Indeed, Yang et al. reported no enhancement effect in ZTCs which were doped with many different kinds of metals.20 As shown in Section 5.2.3, the effect of metal becomes effective around ambient temperature.
Representative hydrogen storage data on ZTCs are summarized in Table 6, together with that of a high-performance activated carbon monolith.266 For comparison, the data of the best MOFs are shown in Table 6, and also in Fig. 18 and 19.267,268 The data of the best MOFs were selected from review papers providing comprehensive catalogues of MOFs.259,260 At 77 K, Mtotal is in the range of 6–7 wt% (0.064–0.075 g g−1) in ZTCs. These values are comparably high to those of other highly porous carbon materials,56 but not as high as that of the best MOF.

 Fig. 19  Literature data on surface excess amounts of H2 (Mex) at 298 K and 100 bar, which are plotted against BET surface area (SBET). Reference numbers are shown besides each plot. All the data are measured by the volumetric method. Circle, square, triangle, and diamond symbols are for ZTCs, metal-doped ZTCs, activated carbons, and MOFs, respectively. Measurement conditions are shown in parenthesis, when they are different from 298 K and 100 bar. An approximation line is calculated with excluding the data of metal-doped ZTCs. 
For practical application, not only Mtotal, but also the storage amount based on the material volume (MV [g-H2 cm−3]) is important to reduce the volume of the storage media. MV is calculated by the following equation: MV = Mtotalρ(5)As mentioned in eqn (1), ρ [g cm−3] is a pellet density for a pelletized sample, or a tap density for a powdery sample. Instead, by using the theoretical maximum density (ρmax) obtained by eqn (3), the theoretical maximum MV (MV-max [g-H2 cm−3]) can be calculated as follows: MV-max = Mtotalρmax(6)MV-max is the upper limit of MV.
Though very high MV values (50.6 and 40 g L−1) have been reported at cryogenic conditions,56,64 they exceed the corresponding MV-max (39 and 34 g L−1, respectively), most probably because of the reason described in Section 4.7. The actual achievable values in ZTCs would be in the range of 30–40 g L−1 (Table 6). Nevertheless, MV-max of ZTC is more catching up to those of MOFs, compared to Mex. This is probably because of the graphene-based framework. The in-plane carbon-atom density of graphene is high, and the occupied volume by a graphene-based framework becomes relatively small, compared to MOFs. Moreover, porous carbons have advantages of superior thermal stability, chemical stability, hydrophobicity, and mechanical strength, over MOFs. Thus, ZTC is still one of the promising candidates for cryogenic hydrogen storage.
The isosteric heat (Qst) of adsorption in ZTCs at the lowest coverage state is in the range of 6–9 kJ mol−1,12,29,46 almost the same as those in activated carbons23 and MOFs.259


5.2.3 Hydrogen storage around ambient temperature in ZTC. 
Around ambient temperature, Mex correlates well with specific surface area, regardless of the type of material and N-doping.23,46,48,58Fig. 19 shows Mex measured at 298–303 K at 100 bar versus SBET. Indeed, the data on ZTCs, activated carbons, and MOFs display a good correlation with SBET. Similar to the case of cryogenic conditions, ZTCs are advantageous in volumetric capacity rather than gravimetric over MOFs (Table 6). Moreover, porous carbons can be molded into high-density pellets,266 and this is very important for practical application. Under high pressure, ZTCs with high surface areas exhibit Mtotal up to 5.7 wt% even at ambient temperature (Table 6), yielding MV-max of 27 g L−1. These values are very competitive with those of the best MOFs, and approach the US Department of Energy (DOE) target for 2020: 4.3 wt%-H2 in a system and 30 g-H2 L−1-system at an operating temperature range of 233–333 K, but still much less than the corresponding ultimate target: 6.1 wt%-H2 and 50 g-H2 L−1-system.262 To further enhance hydrogen storage at ambient temperature, spillover-assisted hydrogen storage has been expected. As is found from the data on TC and Ru/TC in Table 6, doping with Ru nanoparticles greatly enhances the storage amount, together with a noticeable increase of Qst. Indeed, in Fig. 19, metal-doped ZTCs are significantly deviated from the physisorption-based line. However, the remarkable enhancement effect by metal doping on ZTCs has been reported only by Yang's group up to date,17,19,26,33,48 and no one including us (see the datum #23 in Fig. 19) can reproduce similar results.23 Additionally, the data above 100 bar have not been reported. It is actually not easy to obtain sufficient reproducibility in hydrogen uptake measurement on metal-doped samples. As Ghimbeu et al. pointed out, the presence of surface oxide layers on metal particles often inhibits precise measurement.38 We have developed a reliable protocol for the measurement at a low-pressure range (<1 bar), and confirmed reproducible spillover storage, which is enhanced with increasing temperature in Pt-loaded ZTCs.57 However, there are still difficulties in high-pressure measurement on metal-doped ZTCs, and further effort is necessary to develop a reliable protocol of material preparation as well as analysis. Only based on such a reliable protocol, promising materials could be fabricated.


5.2.4 Hydride/ZTC composites. 
Shao et al. introduced LiBH4 in ZTC, and the resulting composite exhibits high Mtotal and MV (Table 6).62 By the nano-confining effect, the composite can release hydrogen at 467 K, 181 K lower than in the case of bulk LiBH4. Such a strategy may be further developed to reduce the uptake/release temperature down to the target range (233–333 K) for on-board hydrogen storage.

5.3 Methane storage
Methane storage has also been investigated in ZTCs,63,163,166,171,187,198,199,240,255,269–272 aiming to evaluate their potential for natural gas storage towards vehicle applications. The general background of methane storage in nanoporous materials has been summarized in previous review papers,255,269–273 and we focus on the performance of ZTCs here. For methane storage, a volumetric total storage amount (MV/V) is popularly expressed by the unit of cm3 (STP) cm−3 (equivalent volume of methane at the standard temperature and pressure: T = 273.15 K, P = 1 atm, divided by the volume of the adsorbent material). MV/V is obtained by the following equation: MV/V = 11.1 × MV(7)Besides, the maximum MV/V (MV/V-max) can be calculated by the eqn (7) using MV-max instead of MV. Practically, the deliverable capacity (Mdel) is of importance and it can be obtained by subtracting the amount of methane remaining at the depletion pressure from the amount of methane stored per volume of material in a fully loaded state. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-energy (ARPA-E) of DOE sets a target of 315 cm3 cm−3 at ambient temperature with a storage pressure of 65 bar and a depletion pressure of 5.8 bar.273 Thus, the maximum deliverable capacity (Mdel-max) is calculated by the following equation. Mdel-max = MV/V-max(@65 bar) − MV/V-max(@5.8 bar)(8)Stadie et al. reported the methane storage in Type-I ZTC with a high-surface area (ZTC-3 in Table 6) at 298 K up to 100 bar, and found an unusual increase of Qst with increasing methane uptake, which could be advantageous for large uptake.187 Nevertheless, Mdel-max is 125 cm3 cm−3, far less than the ARPA-E target. Simon et al. performed a systematic survey of methane uptake in over 650000 materials by using computer simulation, and found that the Mdel-max of the best material is ca. 200 cm3 cm−3, unfortunately still less than the target. Similar values have been indeed reported in several types of MOFs.274–277 Considering the large gap between the capacities of ZTC (up to 125 cm3 cm−3) and the best MOFs and the systematic material survey (ca. 200 cm3 cm−3), it seems to be difficult to achieve a fascinating performance in ZTCs.
5.4 CO2 capture
Towards saving the earth from global warming, the reduction of CO2 emissions is a very important issue in the world. Physisorption-based CO2 capture in nanoporous materials has been one of the promising options for industry.271,278–280 There are three major methods for CO2 capture: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion.278 The former two methods especially have room for improvement of the efficiency by using nanoporous materials.
In the post-combustion, CO2 is separated from the mixture gas generated by combustion. The gas composition (volume ratio) is as follows: 73–77% N2, 15–16% CO2, 5–7% H2O, 3–4% O2, and minor components (<1%) such as SO2, SO3, NOx, HCl, CO, hydrocarbons, and Hg.278 Thus, highly-selective adsorption of CO2 in the gas mixture around ambient temperature and pressure is required. Post-combustion has been the most explored strategy to date because it is easily installed to the existing factories and power plants.
Pre-combustion aims to separate pure H2 fuel gas from coal-derived shifted synthesis gas (called shifted syn gas) containing ca. 70–80% H2, 15–25% CO2, 1–3% CO, and 3–6% CH4.278 While post-combustion needs a temperature or vacuum swing-based process, pre-combustion can be operated by a pressure-swing process above atmospheric pressure because the shifted syn gas is produced at a high pressure. Thus, the desorption (regeneration) of CO2 from the sorbent is much easier than that of post-combustion.
For both the methods, adsorbents have to satisfy several requirements such as high CO2 uptake, high CO2 selectivity, good cyclability, fast kinetics, stability against water vapor and acidic gases, and inexpensive material cost.

Table 7 summarises the representative data on the CO2 capture in ZTCs together with high-performance activated carbons281 at low and high pressure regions, applicable for post-combustion and pre-combustion, respectively. For comparison, the data of the best MOFs282–284 are also shown, which were selected from the comprehensive review paper.278 The performance of nanoporous materials for post-combustion can be roughly evaluated by single-component adsorption isotherms of CO2 and N2 at ambient temperature and pressure. By using the amounts of CO2 uptake (qCO2 [mmol g−1]) and N2 uptake (qN2 [mmol g−1]) at their partial pressures (PCO2 and PN2) in the target gas mixture, the selectivity of CO2 to N2 (S) can be calculated as follows: (9)PCO2 and PN2 are often selected as 0.15 and 0.75 bar, respectively.278 Though the Ideal Absorbed Solution Theory (IAST) provides more reliable selectivity, S is still useful for a quick grasp of a tendency, and it is easy to compare the data in the literature.

Compared to the cases of H2 or CH4, the tuning of pore size is of great significance in CO2 uptake. The appropriate pore size for efficient CO2 uptake is in the range of 0.3–0.4 nm,280 and narrow micropores below 0.35 nm are effective to achieve high selectivities for CO2 over N2 and CO2 over CH4.278 Moreover, polar functional groups do enhance the CO2 uptake because of its higher polarizability and quadrupole moment than those of N2. Indeed, Xia et al.142 and Wang et al.145 have reported the noticeable enhancement of CO2 uptake along with the increase of Qst by N-doping into ZTCs (Table 7), and N-doped ZTC exhibits better CO2 uptake than that of high-performance activated carbon. Nevertheless, the CO2 uptake and selectivity are far less than those of the best MOFs at 0.15 bar. As is found from their data (Table 7), high porosity is not directly related to the performance. Much more important is the tuning of pore size and introduction of polar groups. As mentioned earlier, a precise pore-size control is possible by hot-pressing in ZTCs, and the introduction of polar groups is also possible by a variety of methods. Thus, there might still be room to improve the CO2 uptake in ZTCs.
At a high-pressure region, developed microporosity is of importance for a high CO2 uptake, and MOFs seem to be superior to ZTCs (Table 7).
5.5 Electrochemical capacitors
ZTCs have been intensively investigated for their potential as electrode materials in electrochemical capacitors (also called supercapacitors or ultracapacitors), due to their sufficient electrical conductivity and excellent microporosity.25,71–95

5.5.1 Background of electrochemical capacitors. 
In electrochemical capacitors, capacitance (C [F g−1]) is the amount of charge which is stored in a pair of two electrodes, basically through the formation of an electric double-layer at the interface of the electrode and an electrolyte. Therefore, C in principle depends on the surface area of the electrodes. However, there are several factors which modulate this relation through both negative and positive effects. The negative effect occurs through the following reasons: (N1) poor wettability by an electrolyte; (N2) inner resistance of a carbon electrode; (N3) limitation of ion diffusion in narrow pores; and (N4) inhibition of ion invasion in very narrow pores. On the other hand, the positive effect occurs by: (P1) pseudocapacitance; and (P2) shortening of the electrode-ion distance through de-solvation in very narrow pores. Among the negative and positive enhancements, (N3) and (P2) are conflicting. At a low current, the capacitance can be increased by (P2), whereas the (N3) effect becomes dominant at a high current.
It should be noted that the capacitor performance significantly varies depending on the measurement method or conditions. For example, the amount of active material, type of cell (two or three electrodes), electrolyte, potential (or voltage) range, and charge/discharge rate. Note that potential and voltage are different. Hereafter, ‘potential’ is used when an energy level can be defined by a reference, while ‘voltage’ is used to express the potential difference between two electrodes. The method to calculate capacitance significantly affects the results, too. The value of C can be calculated from cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic discharge curves (GDC). Among them, GDC is generally considered as the most reliable method.29 Thus, it is not easy to simply compare the reported capacitance values which are measured using different techniques. More details about the background of the electrochemical capacitors can be found in some excellent review papers.285–287
While C is measured by a two-electrode cell, a three-electrode cell provides single-electrode capacitance (Csingle). Csingle has the following relation with C measured by the corresponding symmetrical two-electrode cell. Csingle = 4C(10)Many authors prefer to express capacitance by Csingle even if it is measured with a two-electrode cell, by using eqn (10). Eqn (10) works as long as each electrode in a two-electrode cell functions symmetrically in the voltage range applied. However, the electrochemical behaviour is actually very asymmetric in Type-I and some of the Type-II ZTCs, which consist mainly of an ordered framework of single-layer graphenes. On the other hand, the behaviour of Type-III ZTCs is almost the same as those of activated carbons, and some of them can work symmetrically. The aforementioned background has often caused misunderstanding of the electrochemical property of Type-I ZTCs, which shows very unique behaviour as shown below.


5.5.2 Aqueous electrolytes. 
Type-I ZTC with a high surface area (ca. 3800 m2 g−1) shows relatively low specific capacitance per surface area. This is because some segments of the ZTC framework are very narrow like graphene nano-ribbons, and show semiconductive nature.91,94 Nevertheless, the capacitance can be remarkably enhanced by in situ introduction of electrochemically active functional groups as described below. Unlike Type-III or some of Type-II ZTCs with relatively low ordered structures, Type-I and some Type-II ZTCs contain very active edge sites compared to activated carbons, probably because of the unique curved nanographene framework (Fig. 4). In aqueous electrolytes, they are easily oxidized at relatively low anodic potential (Fig. 12).181 As shown in Fig. 20, Type-I ZTC is intensively oxidized at the first anodic scan in 1 M H2SO4. The chemical structure change of ZTC is illustrated in Fig. 21. ZTC (Fig. 21a) originally contains some amount of oxygen-functional groups. By the anodic oxidation, a large amount of oxygen-functional groups are introduced on the edge sites rather than the basal plane.84 Interestingly, a large amount of quinone-type groups can be introduced unlike the case of chemical oxidation (Fig. 21b), thereby showing a large pseudocapacitance around 0.28 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in the following cycles (Fig. 20). The capacitance measured by GDC achieves 300–500 F g−1, because of the reversible quinone-hydroquinone redox reactions (Fig. 21b and c).84

While ZTC exhibits a promising performance in the positive potential range in an acidic electrolyte, its capacitance is much lower in the negative potential range because of the lack of the pseudocapacitance, and moreover, a stable potential range of Type-I ZTC is limited to ca. −0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a negative-electrode side.86 Therefore, a symmetric capacitor using Type-I ZTC cannot exhibit a high energy density (E [W h kg−1]),86 which is calculated by using C as follows. (11) (12)where Ej is energy with a unit of J g−1, and V [V] is the range of applied voltage. To achieve a high energy density, capacitance should be high at both electrodes, and more importantly, the voltage range should be wide as much as possible.
In order to efficiently utilize the advantage of ZTC, we assembled an asymmetric capacitor using ZTC together with a high capacitance porous carbon, which is KOH-activated carbon (SBET = 2600 m2 g−1) derived from a Spanish anthracite and possesses a wider potential window at the negative-electrode side.86 Such a configuration can exhibit a high energy density of 24.5 W h kg−1, which is comparable to those of conventional capacitors utilizing an organic electrolyte.


5.5.3 Organic electrolytes. 
In an organic electrolyte, Type-I ZTC shows similar but slightly different behaviour. Fig. 22 shows CV patterns of Type-I ZTC measured in 1 M Et4NBF4/propylene carbonate (PC). In the potential range of −1.5 to 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgClO4), ZTC is intensively oxidized above 0.5 V at the first anodic scan. It has been revealed through the analyses with temperature-programmed desorption, FT-IR, and XPS that oxygen-functional groups are introduced by this anodic oxidation, and that the PC is an oxygen source.89 By the electrochemical oxidation, ZTC begins to exhibit a large pseudocapacitance at two potential regions (a possible mechanism is shown in Fig. 23).89 A similar behaviour can be seen also in another organic electrolyte: 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (EC:DEC = 1:1), which is commonly used for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and lithium-ion capacitors (LICs). Thus, ZTC can exhibit a large pseudocapacitance in several different organic electrolytes.

Another advantage of ZTC is the compatibility of a high apparent density (ρmax) and a high rate capability. It is well known that mesopores and macropores can greatly accelerate ion diffusion to achieve a high rate performance, but micropores (<2 nm) are inferior. Thus, there have been many publications on the development of “hierarchical” porous carbons with micropores and meso- and/or macropores. However, the presence of mesopores and especially macropores terribly lowers ρmax, giving rise to a quite low volumetric capacitance (Csingle-V [F cm−3]). The ordered pore-arrangement of ZTC enables a high rate capability despite the small pore size of 1.2 nm. Moreover, the ρmax of ZTC is much higher than those of the hierarchical carbons.77 Thus, ZTC achieves a high Csingle-V of 89 F cm−3, together with a good capacitance retention up to a high current.77
To utilize its high pseudocapacitance, ZTC might be applied to a high-capacitance positive-electrode for LICs, in which the positive electrode works in a relatively narrow potential range within about ±1 V from an open circuit potential.
It is not advantageous for ZTC to be used for symmetric capacitors. A potential window of Type-I ZTC is ca. −2.0 to 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgClO4) in 1 M Et4NBF4/PC.89 This means that its symmetric capacitor can stably work approximately only within 2.0 V, which is much less than the voltage of commercial capacitors (2.7 V). Thus, the improvement of anodic stability of ZTC is desired. The chemical modification of active edge sites is one of the possible ways for such improvement. For example, it has been reported that N-doping can improve the anodic stability of ZTC in aqueous electrolytes.71,95
As described above, Type-I ZTC shows unique electrochemical properties. Its single-layer graphene framework provides a large surface area to achieve a high capacitance, while its large amount of active edge sites can be a double-edged sword with a high pseudocapacitance and a limited stability. To take only the advantage of high capacitance, it is desirable to construct a nanoporous framework by single-layer graphene which is free from edge sites. We have recently realized such a material called graphene mesosponge, and demonstrated that it indeed exhibits an excellent anodic stability to achieve a high voltage charge/discharge up to 4 V in a symmetric cell.127


5.5.4 Potential window of ZTC. 
The potential windows of Type-I ZTC84,86,89 in several electrolytes are summarized in Table 8. In addition to the data reported in the literature, we show the results in 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 by volume) in Fig. 24. As described above, in most of the cases, ZTC is oxidized at the first anodic scan, and becomes stable in the potential range shown in Table 8. Note that the potential window can be actually changed depending on several factors, such as the quality and property of ZTC, N-doping71,95 or other chemical modification, the construction of an electrochemical cell, and temperature. Nevertheless, Table 8 can be useful as a rough approximation. For electrochemical applications of ZTC, it is a matter of first priority to confirm the applicable potential range.

 Fig. 24  CV patterns of Type-I ZTC (the same grade as that in ref. 89) in (a) negative and (b) positive potential ranges. An electrode sheet (ZTC:CB:PTFE = 8:1:1) was cut out as a circular shape (∅ 12 mm), and it was sandwiched by two circular SUS304 meshes (∅ 16 mm), and used as a working electrode. The other settings for a three-electrode cell were the same as those reported elsewhere.288 Scan rate is 1 mV s−1. (a) and (b) were carried out by two separated cells. The measurement was started in the narrowest potential range, followed by the potential expansion by 0.1 V to negative (a) and positive (b) potential directions. At each potential range, CV was repeated four times. Only the 1st scan results at each potential range are shown here. In (a), the capacitance decrease becomes evident below 1.1 V, while the anodic current becomes intense at 4.8 V in (b). Thus, the stable potential window of ZTC is between 1.2 to 4.7 V (vs. Li/Li+) in 1 M LiPF6/EC + DEC. 

5.6 Batteries

5.6.1 Lithium-ion batteries. 
There have been some reports on the anode properties of ZTCs for LIBs.135,185,193 The potential range of an anode is usually from 0.01 to 1.5 V (vs. Li/Li+) in 1 M LiPF6/EC + DEC, exceeding the stable range of ZTC (Table 8). Fortunately, at the first negative-direction polarization, the electrolyte is decomposed to form an ion-conductive layer called a solid–electrolyte interface (SEI), which stabilizes the carbon framework. Thus, ZTCs exhibit a high reversible capacity over 1000 mA h g−1. However, there are two serious problems:
(1) A large irreversible capacity of ca. 700–1200 mA h g−1, upon the formation of SEI. When assembling a full cell together with a cathode material such as LiCoO2, the irreversible capacity consumes lithium existing inside the full cell. Therefore, it is necessary to supply the corresponding amount of lithium by increasing the amount of cathode material to compensate the lithium loss in the anode side. This significantly increases the total mass of the full cell, resulting in the decline of the energy density.
(2) Non-constant delithiation potential which distributes up to ca. 3.0 V (Li/Li+). This lowers the voltage of a full cell, resulting also in the decline of the energy density. In conventional graphite, the delithiation potential is constant at ca. 0.1 V.
To use ZTC for LIB anodes, these two problems have to be solved; otherwise it is difficult to expect its significance over other high-performance candidates such as Si.289–291


5.6.2 Aluminium batteries. 
Stadie et al. applied Type-I ZTC to a cathode of aluminium batteries using Al metal as an anode (Fig. 25) in AlCl3/[EMIm]Cl.207 They have confirmed that ZTC is stable in the potential range of 0.01–2.2 V (vs. Al/Al3+) (Table 8), corresponding to 1.4 to 3.6 V (vs. Li/Li+). Like the case of LICs, the cathode charges electricity by physical adsorption forming an electric double layer, and therefore, ZTC is superior to other high-surface activated carbons. Thus, the full cells exhibited both high energy density (up to 64 W h kg−1, 30 W h L−1) and power density (up to 290 W kg−1, 93 W L−1), with a good reversibility within the charging voltage of 2.2 V.

5.6.3 Organic proton batteries. 
The developed porosity with relatively small pore size (ca. 1.2 nm) can be advantageous to stably immobilize active species which tend to be dissolved in an electrolyte. Nueangnoraj et al. used Type-I ZTC as hosts for two types of quinones, anthraquinone (for negative electrode) and tetrachlorohydroquinone (for positive electrode) for organic proton batteries. Their redox potentials are ca. −0.3 to −0.15 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and 0.3 to 0.7 V, respectively, inside the potential window of ZTC in 1 M H2SO4 (−0.5 to 0.8 V).84,86 ZTC can accommodate these quinones up to ca. 60 wt% without forming crystalline solids (Fig. 26), while a high-surface activated carbon, Maxsorb©, can accommodate ca. 50 wt%. The assembled device achieves an energy density of 30.6 W h kg−1 which is superior to the activated-carbon-based capacitors working in the organic electrolytes and also to lead batteries.

5.6.4 Lithium–sulfur batteries. 
Cui et al. prepared a ZTC with very small particle sizes (30–50 nm), and used them as a host of sulfur for cathodes of Li–S batteries. They expected better sulfur–carbon contact and polysulfide retention in a porous carbon host with ultrafine sizes. The ZTC nanoparticles were seemingly Type-III, though no XRD data were provided. The potential range of the cathode is 1.7–2.6 V (vs. Li/Li+) in 1.0 M lithium bis(trifuoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 0.1 M LiNO3 dissolved in 1,3-dioxolane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (1:1, v/v). Though the stability data were not provided, the range of 1.7–2.6 V seems within a potential window in analogy to the one in 1 M LiPF6/EC + DEC (Table 8), and additionally, Type-III is generally more stable than Type-I despite its other inferior performances. ZTC was modified by amphiphilic N-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in advance, and the modified ZTC could accommodate 46 wt% of sulfur. The resulting composite exhibited the initial lithiation capacity of ca. 1240 mA h g−1 based on the sulfur mass (670 mA h g−1 based on the composite mass), and it became 880 mA h g−1 (475 mA h g−1, composite-mass base) at the 50th cycle. Since the ZTC used was Type-III prepared by the simple impregnation-carbonization method, there would be still room to improve this system.

5.7 Fuel cells
Pt- or Pt–Ru loaded ZTCs have been tested as anodes for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs)154,174,192 and as cathodes for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs),177,188,208,209 and it is found that their performance is almost comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts. In most of the cases, ZTCs were Type-III or Type-II with poor structure regularity, and therefore, the advantages of ZTC have been not very evident compared to other nanoporous carbons. For practical applications, an anodic stability is of significance. This is important even for the cathode of a PEFC because the cathode side is actually subjected to a severe oxidative environment upon the re-starting of the PEFC system from a rest state. Compared to other porous carbons and carbon blacks, ZTCs are inferior regarding the anodic stability because of their larger amount of edge sites.
Metal-free ZTCs have been used as non-Pt ORR catalysts. Kwon et al. demonstrated that N-doped ZTC (Type-II) exhibits a better catalysis for the ORR than N-doped reduced graphene oxides.136 The activity of N-doped ZTC approaches that of a commercial Pt/C (Pt: 20 wt%) in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. On the other hand, our group reported that the ORR activity of N-doped ZTC (Type-I) can be further improved by BN-doping.94 However, its activity is not as high as that of a commercial Pt/C in an acidic electrolyte (0.1 M HClO4). A further improvement is necessary for leading to the development of non-Pt catalysts for PEFC based on ZTC.
5.8 Catalysts
ZTCs have been investigated also as catalyst supports or catalysts.164,178,182,189,191,194,205,215
As a catalyst support, ZTC provides a large microporous space for accommodating catalyst nanoparticles. Moreover, the developed and uniform microporosity of ZTC is advantageous for fast mass transportation, large capacity of adsorption, and size-exclusion of large molecules. Donphai et al. loaded TiO2 nanoparticles onto Type-I ZTC, and demonstrated a good photocatalysis of the resulting composite towards the degradation of organic contaminants.189 Jiang et al. reported high catalysis of Pt-loaded ZTC (Type-I) towards hydrogenation reaction.191 Choi et al. prepared S-doped ZTCs, and found that they can accommodate single Pt atoms (Fig. 13) to show selective reduction of O2 into H2O2.
It is also possible to use ZTCs or chemically-modified ZTCs directly as catalysts. Melo Freire et al. reported high activity of several types of N-doped templated carbons for the Knoevenagel condensation.164 However, the tested ZTC was poorly porous Type-III (SBET = 412 m2 g−1), and therefore, the performance may be further improved. Fukuhara et al. reported high activity of Type-II ZTC modified with –SO3H towards the hydrolysis of cellobiose and the Beckmann rearrangement.182 Fukuoka's group discovered a unique catalysis of Type-I ZTC towards the depolymerization of long-chain glucan.194,205
Considering the chemical-structure variety of a ZTC framework described in Section 4, there is a great possibility to develop new catalyst applications using ZTCs.
5.9 Solar evaporation
Wang et al. recently reported an application of ZTC towards solar evaporation,137 which is one way of solar energy harvesting and expected as a means of seawater desalination and wastewater treatment. Carbon materials have broadband absorption properties, and can efficiently absorb the solar spectrum. While the relevant investigation has focused on crystalline carbons such as graphite, graphene, and carbon nanotubes so far without rational reasons, Wang et al. used ZTC as a low crystalline carbon material and examined the relation between the property of ZTC and its performance. They used Type-II ZTC with relatively low surface area (SBET = 1704 m2 g−1), but they still found that ZTC exhibits a high energy conversion efficiency of 72%, thanks to the good wettability by the presence of a large amount of oxygen-functional groups. The performance might be further improved by applying high-quality Type-I ZTC.
6. Conclusions and perspective
In this review article, the development and applications of ZTCs have been summarized over the past 20 years since the first synthesis in 1997. We have defined the three categories for ZTC according to quality, Types-I, -II, and -III (high to low), depending on the degree of ordered structure and inclusion of non-templated carbon portion. The Type-I ZTCs consist of a curved and single-layer narrow graphene framework, affording unique properties and advantages over other nanoporous carbon materials, while the Type-III ZTCs are not greatly different from the conventional nanoporous carbons like activated carbons. Type-II is just between Types-I and -III. As explained in this review, it is highly recommended to synthesize Type-I or Type-II rather than Type-III; otherwise it is not possible to utilize the specific and unique properties of ZTC.
In ZTC, it is possible to draw molecular models more accurately than the cases of other disordered nanoporous carbons, and this is beneficial to understand the fundamental relation between the molecular structure and properties/performance of nanoporous carbons. Due to their well-ordered and uniform graphene-based frameworks as well as the presence of a large amount of active edge sites, ZTCs have a good compatibility with chemical modifications, and therefore, their function can be further extended by either heteroatom doping or forming composites with other components.
ZTCs possess a high surface area up to ca. 4000 m2 g−1, comparable to highly porous MOFs. Thus, ZTCs are competitive materials against MOFs regarding applications for adsorbents and gas storage applications. Though the microporosity is not as high as that of the best MOFs, ZTCs have great advantages of thermal stability, chemical stability, hydrophobicity, and a high thermal conductivity, as carbonaceous materials. ZTCs are useful also as stable catalyst supports, and moreover, their frameworks exhibit unique catalysis for some specific reactions. Unlike MOFs or organic-based nanoporous materials, ZTCs are electrically conductive, and can be used for electrode applications for electrochemical capacitors, rechargeable batteries, and fuel cells. For electrochemical applications, grasping the stable potential range is crucial, because it is often different from those of other nanoporous carbons due to the large amount of active edge sites in ZTCs.
We hope that this article well illustrates the major features and advantages of ZTCs, thereby providing a further understanding of the science of nanoporous carbons and graphene-based frameworks.

 	Fig. 24  CV patterns of Type-I ZTC (the same grade as that in ref. 89) in (a) negative and (b) positive potential ranges. An electrode sheet (ZTC:CB:PTFE = 8:1:1) was cut out as a circular shape (∅ 12 mm), and it was sandwiched by two circular SUS304 meshes (∅ 16 mm), and used as a working electrode. The other settings for a three-electrode cell were the same as those reported elsewhere.288 Scan rate is 1 mV s−1. (a) and (b) were carried out by two separated cells. The measurement was started in the narrowest potential range, followed by the potential expansion by 0.1 V to negative (a) and positive (b) potential directions. At each potential range, CV was repeated four times. Only the 1st scan results at each potential range are shown here. In (a), the capacitance decrease becomes evident below 1.1 V, while the anodic current becomes intense at 4.8 V in (b). Thus, the stable potential window of ZTC is between 1.2 to 4.7 V (vs. Li/Li+) in 1 M LiPF6/EC + DEC.
