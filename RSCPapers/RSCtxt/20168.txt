    , Accepted 17th November 2016First published on 17th November 2016AbstractPr3+/Yb3+ doped materials have been widely reported as quantum-cutting materials in recent times. However, the question of the energy transfer mechanism in the Pr3+/Yb3+ pair in light of the quantum-cutting phenomenon still remains unanswered. In view of that, we explored a series of Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped low phonon fluorotellurite glass systems to estimate the probability of different energy transfer mechanisms. Indeed, a novel and simple way to predict the probability of the proper energy transfer mechanism in the Pr3+/Yb3+ pair is possible by considering the donor Pr3+ ion emission intensities and the relative ratio dependence in the presence of acceptor Yb3+ ions. Moreover, the observed results are very much in accordance with other estimated results that support the quantum-cutting phenomena in Pr3+/Yb3+ pairs, such as sub-linear power dependence of Yb3+ NIR emission upon visible ∼450 nm laser excitation, integrated area of the donor Pr3+ ion's visible excitation spectrum recorded by monitoring the acceptor Yb3+ ion's NIR emission, and the experimentally obtained absolute quantum yield values using an integrating sphere setup. Our results give a simple way of estimating the probability of an energy transfer mechanism and the factors to be considered, particularly for the Pr3+/Yb3+ pair.
Introduction
Quantum-cutting (QC), a phenomenon where one high energy photon is cut into two or more low energy photons, has become an intense topic of research in recent times in view of its potential application in solar energy harvesting. Lanthanides are preferred as the primary candidates for realizing such phenomena because of their affluent energy level structure, which facilitates numerous absorption and emission transitions throughout the solar spectral region.1 The initial work on QC materials dates back to the 1970s, which was aimed at the conversion of one vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) photon into two visible (VIS) photons in a single rare earth ion for their promising use in the plasma displays and mercury-free fluorescent tubes.2,3 Presently, QC studies are focused on conversion of VIS photons to the near-infrared (NIR) region to enhance the efficiency of silicon photovoltaic (Si-PV) cells with the help of co-doping ions where the donor ion has maximum spectral absorption in the UV-VIS region and the acceptor ion has maximum emission near the bandgap region of silicon (∼1.1 eV). In the recent past, numerous papers/review articles have been published on spectral conversion;4–7 however, studies on Si-PV efficiency enhancement through QC are very limited and in fact such studies have emerged only in the current decade.8–18 In particular, Pr3+/Yb3+ ion pairs are being extensively studied19–27 because of their spectral response in terms of the QC phenomenon, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Though many investigations on Pr3+/Yb3+ systems have been reported, the proper mechanism of the energy transfer process with experimental results is still lacking. The energy transfer (ET) mechanism is still controversial when it comes to Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped QC materials. Van der Ende et al.8 described a two-step sequential ET mechanism (Pr3+: 3P0 → 1G4 ⇒ Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 + Pr3+: 1G4 → 3H4 to Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2) in Pr3+/Yb3+ doped SrF2 crystals. Moreover, a two-step ET mechanism has been recounted for Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped YF3,9 CaF2,10 LaF3,11 and CaYAlO412 crystalline powders as well as in tellurite glass.13 Van Wijngaarden et al.14 showed a one-step (first order) ET mechanism (either Pr3+: 3P0 → 1G4 to Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 or Pr3+: 1G4 → 3H4 to Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2) in LiYF4: Pr3+/Yb3+ crystals through Monte Carlo simulations. A first order ET mechanism has also been proposed in Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped oxyfluoride glass ceramics by Tanabe et al.15 Quantum-cutting co-operative energy transfer (QC-CET) mechanism (Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 to 2Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2) has been reported in LiTeO4 phosphors,16 Y2O3 transparent ceramics17 and boro-aluminosilicate glasses/LaBO3 glass ceramics.18 However, none of these papers have considered the probability of the emission transitions contributing to first order ET/2-step ET/QC-CET mechanisms in the particular host material. Further, quantum cutting co-operative energy transfer from Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 to 2Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 has been reported but neither of these papers showed the laser power dependence of Yb3+ NIR emissions nor considered the Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 transition probability and its decay kinetics in the presence of acceptor Yb3+ ions.
Mostly, single or poly-crystalline materials have been explored for QC applications because of their low phonon energy, which avoids multiphonon assisted non-radiative relaxations from excited states.28 Glasses have distinct advantages over crystals/phosphors because of their potentially higher doping level of active ions, flexible geometry and easy fabrication process. The broader spectral features of rare earth ions in the glasses also improve the energy transfer process and favour a greater spectral response. Among various types of glasses, oxide glasses are more viable, environmental friendly and cost effective compared to halide and chalcogenide based low phonon non-oxide glasses. In this respect, we have developed a new class of fluorotellurite glass (TBLAF) with a lower phonon energy than the other oxide glasses reported so far (FTIR and Raman spectra are depicted in Fig. S2, ESI†).
In this work, systematic investigations have been carried out on the spectroscopic properties, fluorescence decay kinetics and ∼450 nm laser power dependent Yb3+ NIR emission to elucidate the proper energy transfer mechanism among Pr3+–Yb3+ ions in the TBLAF glass host considering both theoretical models and experimental results. A simple way of estimating the probability of a quantum cutting process has been described by considering the relative emission intensity ratios of donor Pr3+ ions in the presence of acceptor Yb3+ ions. The absolute quantum yield values of all samples were measured by using an integrating sphere setup to validate its practical performance as a down converting material.
Materials and methods
Sample preparation
A series of singly Pr3+ doped and Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped Ba-Al-La-Fluorotellurite (TBALF) glasses having chemical composition (mol%) 75TeO2–15BaF2–5AlF3–(5 − x − y)LaF3–xPrF3–yYbF3 (where x = 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and y = 0 for singly Pr3+ doped glasses and x = 0.5, y = 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 for Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped glasses) were prepared by melt quenching technique. All the chemicals used were of AR grade with 99.99% purity and were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Approximately 10 g of each batch was thoroughly mixed to a fine power in an agate motor and transferred to a pure platinum crucible covered with a platinum lid for melting in an electrical furnace at 800–850 °C for about 1 h. During melting, the melt was intermittently stirred with a thin platinum rod to attain chemical homogeneity and ensure a bubble free melt, then it was poured onto a preheated graphite mould to form a clear glass followed by annealing at glass transition temperature for 2 h to remove thermal stress in the formed glasses.
Optical spectral measurement techniques
Absorption spectra of all glasses at room temperature were recorded in the wavelength region of 300–2500 nm (slit width of 2 nm) on a UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectrophotometer (Model: UV-3101PC, Shimadzu, Japan). The samples for this measure were polished to a plate shape with an average thickness of 2 mm. The baseline was corrected with respect to air by placing standard external slits in the reference and sample beam paths constantly.
The emission and excitation spectra and fluorescence decay kinetics of the samples were recorded at room temperature on a spectrofluorometer (Model: Quantum Master enhanced NIR from PTI, USA) fitted with double monochromators on both the excitation and emission channels. The instrument was equipped with a PMT (photo-multiplier tube) for the visible (VIS) region and an LN2 cooled gated NIR-PMT (model: NIR-PMT-R 1.7, Hamamatsu) as the detectors for acquiring both study state spectra and phosphorescence decay in the VIS and near infrared (NIR) regions. The VIS emission spectra for all the samples were recorded in the PMT detector to gain the maximum spectral response as the excitation and emission gratings were blazed for maximum diffraction efficiency at 300 nm and 400 nm, respectively. The NIR emission spectra of all the samples were recorded through the NIR-PMT detector for a better spectral response. Suitable low pass and high pass filters supplied by Edmund Optics Inc., USA were used at the source and detector side, respectively, to avoid unwanted higher harmonic peaks related to the excitation and emission wavelength in the recorded emission spectrum. Decay measurements were carried out using a Hamamatsu NIR-PMT in gated mode by employing a 60 W xenon flash lamp as the excitation source.
Excitation power dependent emission spectra were recorded upon exciting with a variable power (up to 1 W) 447 nm continuous wave laser diode (model: MDL-111-447-1W) supplied by Opto Electronics Tech. Co. Ltd, China. The 447 nm LD excited emission spectra were recorded using a silicon detector (model: AvaSpec-3648) supplied by Avantes, Netherlands. Fluorescence quantum yield (QY) measurements were carried out at room temperature with an integrating sphere of 150 mm diameter from Labsphere with 99% reflectance over the 400–1500 nm region attached to the same fluorimeter. The reflected light was collected using a fibre optic cable positioned on top of the sphere at a right angle to the excitation port. The absolute quantum yield measurements were carried out for all the samples in the wavelength region 425–1200 nm. The excitation and emission spectra were recorded in the same LN2 cooled NIR-PMT detector and corrected for its spectral response in real time. Each experiment was repeated at least three times and the average value was used to calculate the QY (%) with an error limit of ±5%. The QY (%) can be obtained from the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed. To calculate the number of photons absorbed, the excitation spectra in the wavelength region 425–1200 nm were recorded in the integration sphere without and with sample in real time correction mode with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm. The difference between the integrated areas of these two excitation spectra will give the number of photons absorbed by the sample. Further, to calculate the number of photons emitted at 450 nm excitation (a suitable high pass filter was placed at the emission channel to nullify any contribution from the excitation wavelength), the emission spectrum was recorded in the wavelength region 475–1200 nm in real time correction mode. The integrated area under the emission spectrum will give the number of photons emitted. Thus the QY% can be obtained from the ratio of number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.
Results & discussion
Optimization of donor (Pr3+) ion concentration
To optimize the donor (Pr3+) ion concentration in the present TBLAF glass, a series of glasses was prepared by varying the PrF3 concentration from 0.25 mol% to 1 mol%. The emission spectra recorded under 450 nm excitation show a number of distinct and well established peaks pertaining to different excited states to ground state transitions of the Pr3+ ion,29 as depicted in Fig. 1. The inset spectra in Fig. 1 shows the excitation spectra corresponding to the 492 nm (VIS) and 1040 nm (NIR) intense emission peaks of the Pr3+ ions. It was observed that the intensity of all the emission bands increased up to 0.5 mol% doping of PrF3 and was quenched thereafter owing to the reduced interaction length of Pr ↔ Pr ions, which eventually enhances the cross-relaxation rate among Pr3+ ions owing to the superimposition of many absorption and emission transitions, particularly in the lower wavelength region.30,31 The top right inset of Fig. 1 reveals the possible cross-relaxation mechanisms encountered in Pr3+ ions. From the spectra it can be observed that the relative intensities of all bands gradually decreased with increasing concentration; however, the band corresponding to the 1D2 → 3H4 transition at 598 nm showed a significant change in its profile with concentration and totally disappeared for the 1 mol% PrF3 doped glass. This can be attributed to the enhanced cross-relaxation rate (CR3, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1) corresponding to the 1D2 ↔ 3H4 transition.28 From the emission spectral analysis, 0.5 mol% PrF3 doped glass has been optimized for Yb3+ ion co-doping.

To understand the transition probability strengths of the absorption and emission transitions, modified Judd–Ofelt (J–O) analysis was applied to the base glass corrected absorption spectrum (Fig. S3, ESI†) of 0.5 mol% PrF3 doped TBLAF glass using relevant expressions.32 The mixing of the 5d–4f orbitals of Pr3+ often results in a negative value of the J–O intensity parameter, Ω2. Omission of the 3H4 → 3P2 hypersensitive transition may offer positive values for Ω2 but it results in a great deviation between experimental and calculated oscillator strengths with large RMS (root mean square) values. We have also derived J–O parameters using the normal J–O method including and excluding the 3H4 → 3P2 hypersensitive transition and using modified J–O theory including all experimentally observed absorption transitions. The details of J–O analysis regarding Pr3+ ions are discussed and presented in the ESI.† The modified J–O theory calculated intensity parameters are Ω2 = 11.407 × 10−20, Ω4 = 7.076 × 10−20 and Ω6 = 8.975 × 10−20. The electric dipole linestrength (Scaled) and oscillator strength (Pcal) values of various absorption transitions along with the estimated RMS deviation values were calculated using normal and modified J–O theory and are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). Since the J–O analysis is valid for the estimation of electric dipole line strengths, the contribution of the magnetic dipole linestrengths (Smd) was subtracted from the line strength values for the magnetic dipole induced transitions 3H4 → 3F3 + 3F4 and 3H4 → 1G4. Good agreement between experimentally measured lifetime values (Table S2 and Fig. S4, ESI†) and calculated lifetime values was observed from modified J–O theory with low RMS values comparable to 3P2-included normal J–O theory.
The calculated J–O intensity parameters were utilized to estimate the emission transition line strengths, spontaneous emission probabilities, radiative rates and branching ratios of the respective emission transitions. The values are depicted in Table 1 for each emission transition originating from the excited states 3P0, 1D2 and 1G4 to their lower lying levels. The most probable emission transitions under 450 nm excitation are 3P0 → 3H4 at 492 nm and 3P0 → 3F2 at 647 nm with electric dipole line strength values of 1.21 × 10−20 and 3.36 × 10−20, respectively. Though there are eight emission transitions involved from the 3P0 excited state, only these two emission transitions are fully dominating with higher branching ratios of 30.4% (492 nm, blue) and 57.9% (647 nm, red), respectively. Since the Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 emission at 492 nm has double the energy of Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2, absorption at ∼980 nm plays a crucial role in the QC mechanism arising from the Pr3+/Yb3+ couple.

Optimization of acceptor ion (Yb3+) concentration
To optimize the acceptor (Yb3+) ion concentration, a series of glasses co-doped with fixed 0.5 mol% PrF3 (optimized) and 0.25–2 mol% concentrations of YbF3 was prepared. The absorption spectra of the sample are presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The photoluminescence excitation and emission (PLE & PL) spectra recorded for Pr3+ singly doped and Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped samples at room temperature under identical experimental conditions are shown in Fig. 2a–d. Fig. 2e depicts the variation of emission intensities of the Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 (492 nm) and Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 (980 nm) transitions as a function of Yb3+ ion concentration. Usually, it is difficult to observe the blue emission corresponding to the Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 transition in high phonon glasses, such as silicates, borates and phosphates,28 owing to the dominant and fast non-radiative relaxation rate from the 3P0 to the 1D2 level. However, the low phonon energy of the present TBLAF glass host restricts the fast depopulation of the 3P0 excited state and hence an intense 3P0 → 3H4 blue emission at 492 nm was observed. Interestingly, with the increase in Yb3+ ion concentration, the visible PLE and PL intensities of the Pr3+ ions were drastically reduced, revealing direct evidence of energy transfer from Pr3+ to Yb3+ ions.
 Fig. 2  Photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. (a) PLE for intense Pr3+ VIS emission, (b) PLE for intense Pr3+/Yb3+ NIR emission, (c) Pr3+ VIS emission, (d) Pr3+/Yb3+ NIR emission, and (e) variation of Pr3+ 492 nm emission and Yb3+ 980 nm emission with Yb3+ ion concentration. 
Further, the excitation spectra recorded by monitoring the Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 NIR emission at 980 nm also exhibit an intense Pr3+ excitation band in the VIS region (400–650 nm) and are very much overlapping with the excitation spectrum recorded for VIS and NIR emissions of only Pr3+ doped glass (Fig. 2b) as well as the absorption spectrum of Pr3+ ions in the VIS region substantiating the energy transfer phenomenon from Pr3+ → Yb3+ ions. In addition, the Pr3+: 3H4 → 3P2,1,0 excitation bands recorded by monitoring the Yb3+ emission at 980 nm show almost two times higher intensity (∼1.8 times) than that of the Pr3+-only doped sample, confirming that the energy transfer process is taking place via QC mechanism in the present host. The mechanism of QC can be illustrated by a simple two-step energy transfer process from Pr3+ → Yb3+, as revealed by many authors8–13 and given below:Pr3+: 3P0 → 1G4 → Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 (+) Pr3+: 1G4 → 3H4 → Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2i.e., under 474 nm excitation two sequential emissions from Pr3+: 3P0 → 1G4 and 1G4 → 3H4 will excite two Yb3+ ions (Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2). However, from modified J–O analysis, the calculated radiative properties of Pr3+ ions (Table 1) in the present host explain the above mechanism in a different way. The emission probability (branching ratio) of Pr3+: 3P0 → 1G4 is only 0.92% with poor line strength (Sed = 0.301 × 10−20) among other transitions originating from the 3P0 excited state. Furthermore, the Pr3+: 1G4 → 3H4 emission transition probability (14.3%) with line strength (Sed = 0.352 × 10−20) is even less when compared to other transitions originating from the 1G4 excited sate. However, the existence of these emission transitions under 474 nm excitation reveals the presence of a QC mechanism via two-step energy transfer process in the present host but its probability is very low.
On the other hand, Fig. 2d depicts the NIR emission spectra of only Pr3+ doped and Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped samples under 474 nm excitation, which shows a number of Pr3+ NIR emission bands that are assigned to 3P0 → 1G4, 1D2 → 3F2,3,4 and 1G4 → 3H4 transitions and an intense band in the case of the co-doped sample at 980 nm is assigned to the Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 emission transition. Since the Yb3+ ion absorption and Pr3+ ion NIR emissions particularly in the region 880 nm to 1040 nm overlap very well, it is expected that a resonant energy transfer may take place from Pr3+ → Yb3+ ions in the co-doped sample. The same has been reflected in Fig. 2d whereby the Pr3+ NIR emissions are severely quenched in the presence of Yb3+ ions. In addition, the excitation spectrum recorded for the Yb3+ ion emission at 980 nm reveals a band at 594 nm corresponding to the Pr3+: 3H4 → 1D2 absorption transition and the integrated area of this band is very much similar to the only Pr3+ doped glass signifying the energy transfer taking place via a one to one photon process (i.e., normal ET process). The higher values of calculated line strengths and branching ratios of emission transition originating from the Pr3+: 1D2 excited state i.e., 1D2 → 3F2,3,4 transitions (Table 1) further strengthen the higher probability of normal energy transfer from Pr3+ → Yb3+ ions in co-doped sample.
In addition to the above two energy transfer mechanisms, the possibility of a quantum cutting co-operative energy transfer process (QC-CET) cannot be ruled out in the present host as the Pr3+ VIS excitation band intensity monitored for the Yb3+ 980 nm emission in the co-doped sample is almost twice that of the excitation band intensity of the Pr3+-only doped sample. Thus, it strongly supports the chances of a QC-CET mechanism in the present host as follows:Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 → Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 (+) Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2i.e., the intense Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 blue emission (492 nm) will be utilized to excite two Yb3+ ions simultaneously. From the modified J–O analysis, it can be observed that the 3P0 → 3H4 emission transition is the second most probable emission transition from the 3P0 excited sate having a branching ratio of 30.45% with a stronger electric dipole line strength of 1.21 × 10−20 (Table 1). Additionally, when Yb3+ ions are co-doped, a drastic reduction of this emission (Fig. 2e) also supports the persistence of QC-CET in the present host. The detailed decay kinetics of the Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 transition and energy transfer mechanisms are discussed in the following sections.
From Yb3+ ion luminescence spectral analysis, it has been observed that 0.5 mol% is the optimized concentration for Yb3+ ions in the present Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped TBLAF glass. Beyond 0.5 mol% Yb3+ ion concentration, the quenching of Yb3+ 980 nm emission intensity may be attributed to the Yb–Yb re-absorption losses33 or energy back transfer (EBT) from Yb3+ → Pr3+ ions. To understand the EBT process, Pr3+ NIR spectra were recorded by exciting Yb3+ ions at 987 nm. Fig. 3 presents the Pr3+ NIR emission spectra for Pr3+-only doped glass upon 474 nm excitation and Pr3+/Yb3+ (0.5 mol%) co-doped glass upon 474 nm as well as 987 nm excitation. On Pr3+ 474 nm excitation in Pr3+ singly doped glass an intense and broad NIR emission peaking at ∼1370 nm, ∼1479 nm and ∼1580 nm corresponding to the transitions 1G4 → 3H5, 1D2 → 1G4 and 3F4,3F3 → 3H4 have been observed, respectively.34–36 The NIR emission intensities have been quenched in Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped glass due to the QC-CET mechanism, as described above. However, upon 987 nm excitation only the 1G4 → 3H5 (∼1370 nm) emission transition is observed owing to the resonant energy transfer Yb3+: 2F5/2 → Pr3+: 1G4. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the variation of Pr3+: 1G4 → 3H5 emission intensity as a function of Yb3+ ion concentration upon Yb3+ 987 nm excitation. The observed Pr3+: 1G4 → 3H5 emission transition under Yb3+ 987 nm excitation confirms the possibility of energy back transfer from Yb3+ → Pr3+ ions. However, with the increase in Yb3+ ion concentration (beyond 0.5 mol%), the Pr3+: 1G4 → 3H5 emission intensity is still quenched. This can be attributed to the increased Yb–Yb ion interactions that lead to the re-absorption losses.33 Moreover, the observed intensity is very low, indicating that the probability of EBT is negligibly small.

Fig. 4a represents the decay profiles for the Pr3+: 1D2 → 3F4/1G4 → 3H4 and Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transitions under Pr3+: 474 nm excitation for Pr3+ singly doped and Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped samples and Fig. 4b for Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 emission transition in the co-doped sample under Yb3+: 924 nm excitation. The decay curve of Pr3+ doped glass (Pr0.5) is best fitted to a single exponential function with a value of 29.4 μs. In the co-doped samples, the observed curves are best fitted to a double exponential function. In case of Pr3+-only doped glass, it is more plausible to assign the 1040 nm emission to the Pr3+: 1D2 → 3F4 transition (under 474 nm excitation) since the linestrength (6.00 × 10−20) and branching ratio (39.14%) of this transition are 17 and 2.7 times stronger, respectively, than that of Pr3+: 1G4 → 3H4 transition (0.352 × 10−20 and 14.33%; Table 1) indicating the dominance of the 1D2 → 3F4 over the 1G4 → 3H4 transition for 1040 nm.

The observed bi-exponential nature in the co-doped sample can be attributed to the presence of Yb3+ ions. The slower decay rate (τm2) is best assigned to the Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition and the faster decay rate (τm1) to the Pr3+: 1D2 → 3F4 /1G4 → 3H4 transition. With the increase in the Yb3+ ion concentration, the lifetime of Yb3+ ions under both 474 nm excitation (Fig. 4a) and 924 nm excitation (Fig. 4b) follows a similar trend as that of emission spectra shown in Fig. 2d. From the perspective of decay analysis, the energy transfer probabilities among Pr3+ ↔ Yb3+ are very effective and dominate up to the 0.5 mol% doping level, beyond which Yb3+ ion reabsorption losses augment the quenching mechanism. In the case of the Pr3+ → Yb3+ QC mechanism, Pr3+: 3P0 excited state dynamics play a crucial role. In particular, the Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 emission transition (492 nm) is more vital when it comes to the QC-CET process since it is double the energy of the Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 absorption transition. So it is very much essential to understand the energy transfer mechanism and its dynamics to estimate the efficiencies of the energy transfer processes.
Pr3+ → Yb3+ energy transfer mechanism and Pr3+: 3P0 excited state dynamics
The Pr3+, Yb3+ concentration optimized (0.5 mol%) sample was chosen for the energy transfer dynamics from Pr3+ to Yb3+ ions. Since Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 emission transition (492 nm) is crucial for QC-CET process, the decay kinetics of this transition would be more appropriate than the commonly reported Pr3+: 3P0 → 3F2 transition (649 nm). Fig. 5 presents the measured decay profiles for the Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 transition under 474 nm excitation for Pr3+ singly doped and Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped samples. The decay profile for Pr3+ doped glass follows the single exponential path (R2 = 0.99914), while it is bi-exponential for all Pr3+/Yb3+ co-doped samples (R2 > 0.999). The lifetime values are presented in the inset of Fig. 5. A close observation of the decay profiles reveal a change in the slope at the initial part of the curve, as shown in the inset (a) of Fig. 5. Accordingly, the faster component of the lifetime (τ1) is drastically reduced to 1.2 μs (∼7 times less than the lifetime of the Pr3+-only sample). However, the lower lifetime component (τ2) is pretty much similar to that of the Pr3+-only doped glass. In the case of the co-doped sample, when a Yb3+ ion resides within the interaction sphere of another Pr3+ ion, the faster lifetime component (τ1) can be attributed to the energy transfer effect from the Pr3+ to the Yb3+ ion and the slower component (τ2) can be assigned to the non-interacting (isolated) Pr3+ ion. The energy transfer efficiency has been calculated using the faster lifetime component (τ1) values. The inset (b) of Fig. 5 shows the energy transfer efficiency with respect to the Yb3+ ion concentration. The energy transfer efficiency varies in a very narrow region (85–87%) with increasing Yb3+ ion concentration, which can be ascribed to the attainment of an equilibrium state of energy transfer process among Pr3+ ↔ Yb3+ ions. As said earlier, Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 emission contributes to the absorption of two Yb3+ ions (2F7/2 → 2F5/2) simultaneously; owing to its faster decay (τ1) nature in the case of the co-doped sample, it could be much quicker than any other emission transitions that are contributing to the ground state absorption of Yb3+ ions under 474 nm excitation. Hence, the observed QC-CET process is much faster than the other energy transfer processes, like normal radiative energy transfer and two-step sequential energy transfer process, in the present host.

Since the decay curves are not single exponentials, to calculate the weighted average of the faster and slower lifetime components, the decay curves of Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 emission transition have been fitted to a ‘stretched exponential function’37 as shown below: I(t) = I0exp(−(t/τch)β)(1)where I(t) and I0 are the emission intensities during the decay and at t = 0, respectively. The parameter τch provides the characteristic lifetime of Pr3+ ions providing the weighted average over the fast and slower components of the lifetime. The parameter β, ranging from 0 to 1, represents the degree to which the measured decay differs from a purely exponential decay (β = 1). Fig. 6 presents the decay profile of the Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 emission transition fitted to the ‘stretched exponential function’ with a regression coefficient of R2 > 0.999. The fitted weight average lifetime τch and β values are presented in Table 2. The τch value decreased with increasing Yb3+ ion concentration and the β value varies from 0.75 to 0.6, signifying the increase of non-exponential behaviour with concentration.

Further, to understand the influence of donor–acceptor interactions on the nature of the energy transfer mechanism, the well-established Inokuti–Hirayama (IH)38 theoretical model for direct donor–acceptor energy transfer processes was implemented on the donor decay analysis. (2)where NA is the acceptor ion concentration, Γ is Euler's gamma function, s is the electrostatic interaction parameter (s = 6 for dipole–dipole interactions) and CDA is the microscopic energy transfer parameter between the donor and the acceptor.

Fig. 6 also presents IH model fitted decay profiles of the Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 transition for all the samples. Interestingly, IH model fitting is improved with increasing Yb3+ ion concentration (regression coefficient R2 from 0.9317 to 0.99480), signifying the direct energy transfer from Pr3+ to Yb3+ ions. The characteristic lifetime (τIH) of Pr3+ ions residing within the interaction sphere of the Yb3+ ion has also been derived from the IH fitting model. As interpreted earlier, the τIH lifetime values also decrease with increasing Yb3+ ion concentration, as shown in Table 2. By using the IH model, the energy transfer micro parameters and energy transfer rates were estimated and are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The energy transfer rate, γ2, increases with decreasing critical distance, R0, as a function of Yb3+ ion concentration.
The energy transfer efficiencies, ηET (%), were estimated from the Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 measured decay curves fitted to bi-exponential, stretched exponential and IH functions. The calculated average weighted lifetimes both from the stretched exponential function and the IH model also reveal a considerable increase in energy transfer efficiency with respect to the Yb3+ ion concentration. In case of resonant energy transfer, the Pr3+: 1D2 lifetime plays a crucial role. Since the 1040 nm emission corresponds to both Pr3+: 1D2 → 3F4/1G4 → 3H4 and Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transitions, the measured lifetimes are influenced by both ET and EBT processes in the co-doped samples. The theoretical QC efficiency (ηQC) estimated by considering the efficiency of Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 (492 nm) as unity is around 185% in the present TBLAF glass host.
Quantum cutting cooperative energy transfer (QC-CET)
The QC-CET process in the present host has been explained so far using emission transitions strengths and decay measurements. To validate the mechanism, the emission spectra were recorded at different pump powers using a 447 nm laser diode. QC of one high energy photon in two simultaneous low energy photons implies that the slope of the excitation power versus integrated emission intensity will be ∼0.5.39–42Fig. 7 presents the excitation power dependent emission spectra for the optimum Yb3+ ion concentration (0.5 mol%) sample. Inset (a) depicts the magnified view of the emission spectra in the NIR region upon 447 laser diode excitation. As shown in inset (b) of Fig. 7, the slope value of 0.495 for Yb3+ 980 nm emission confirms the QC-CET process in support of our explanation based on modified J–O as well as decay analysis. Furthermore, the slope values of 1.118 and 0.979 for Pr3+ VIS: 520 nm and NIR: 870 nm emissions, respectively, further support the validation of the Yb3+ QC-CET mechanism at this concentration. The effect of the Yb3+ ion concentration on the QC-CET process was examined by evaluating the slope values as shown in Fig. 8 with log–log plots of laser excitation power versus Yb3+ NIR emission intensity. The slope values are ∼1 for all other concentrations except Yb3+ 0.5 mol%, indicating that the QC-CET mechanism highly depends on the Pr–Yb interaction length, which is in turn governed by the active ion concentrations. The inset of Fig. 8 shows a sharp dip at ∼978 nm in the emission spectrum, signifying the enhanced re-absorption losses at higher Yb3+ ion concentrations. The effect of the Yb3+ ion concentration on the 447 nm LD excited power dependent emission spectra is presented in Fig. S6 (ESI†).

Absolute quantum yield measurements
To validate the theoretical efficiency with the practical efficiency, absolute quantum yield (QY (%)) measurements were carried out using an integrating sphere setup. The QY (%) was calculated from the ratio of number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed, as described in the experimental section. Fig. 9 presents the absolute quantum yield (%) values for various Yb3+ ion concentrations. The inset of Fig. 9 shows the QY (%) for various Pr3+ ion concentrations in Pr3+ singly doped TBLAF glasses. The obtained QY (%) values for Pr3+-only doped as well as Pr3+/Yb3+ doped samples follow a similar trend to that of the emission spectra. In the donor (Pr3+) optimised samples (in the case of singly Pr3+ doped samples, Pr0.5), the QY (%) obtained was 24.46%. When Yb3+ ions are co-doped (0.5 mol%), the QY (%)increased to 41.98%, which is approximately ∼172% of the QY (%) of the Pr3+-only (Pr0.5) doped sample and the values is almost the same as the QC efficiency (ηQC) calculated from the lifetimes values (∼185%). The dominant QC-CET process at this concentration (PrYb0.5) is responsible for the enhanced QY (%) value. The measured absolute QY value of ∼42% is the highest value reported so far in the case of Pr3+/Yb3+ codoped samples to the best of our knowledge.

A simple way of predicting the probability of an ET mechanism
The intensities of the Pr3+ VIS and NIR emission bands have a significant effect on the energy transfer mechanism in the presence of Yb3+ ions.
To study the effect, some of the valid points were considered as below.
(1) 3P0 → 3H4; 492 nm is the main contributor for the QC-CET process since the energy of this photon is double the energy gap of Yb3+ ions and two Yb3+ ions can be simultaneously excited with one 492 nm photon.
(2) 1D2 → 3F2,3,4; 880, 990, 1040 nm are the main contributors for the resonant one-to-one photon normal ET process as the energy of these photon exactly matches with the energy gap of the Yb3+ ion.
(3) 3P0 → 1G4 + 1G4 → 3H4; 930 and 1040 nm are the main contributors for the two-step sequential ET process since the 1G4 state acts as an intermediate state for the two photons originating from the 3P0 and 1G4 states, which has the same energy to excite two Yb3+ ions consecutively.
In all the three cases, the excitation energy would be double the energy gap of Yb3+ ions i.e., ∼450 nm. If the above points are valid then the relative ratio of the emission intensity of these bands would be strongly influenced by the ET mechanism and in turn the Yb3+ ion concentration. The emission spectra recorded in the same experimental conditions were considered for this analysis.
The relative intensity of the 3P0 → 3H4; 492 nm emission (sole contributor for the QC-CET process) in the presence of Yb3+ ions was calculated with respect to the Pr3+-only (Pr0.5) doped sample and is presented in column ‘A’ of Table 3.

The relative intensity of the 1D2 → 3F2; 880 nm emission (contributor for one-to-one photon normal ET process) was calculated with respect to the Pr3+-only (Pr0.5) doped sample and is presented in column ‘B’ of Table 3. Since the 990 and 1040 nm emissions are very much overlapped with the Yb3+ ion emission, it is not possible or won’t be appropriate to consider the emission intensity in the presence of Yb3+ ions. So for this study we considered only 880 nm.
Similarly, the relative intensity of the 3P0 → 1G4; 930 nm emission (first photon contributing to the 2 step ET process) was calculated with respect to the Pr3+-only (Pr0.5) doped sample and is presented in column ‘C’ of Table 3. Again, as mentioned above, it is not possible or won’t be appropriate to consider the emission intensity of 1040 nm.
• The relative ratio of ‘A:B’ will give the dominance of QC-CET or normal ET
• The relative ratio of ‘A:C’ will give the dominance of QC-CET or 2 step ET
• The relative ratio of ‘B:C’ will give the dominance of normal ET or 2 step ET
From the calculated values presented in Table 3, it is observed that for the PrYb0.25 sample either of three ET mechanisms is possible. However, ‘A:C’ clearly shows the dominance of QC-CET over 2 step ET. Again, the number of Yb3+ ions available within the interaction sphere of the Pr3+ ion has a considerable influence on QC-CET. In the case of the PrYb0.5 sample, the dominance of the QC-CET process over the other two ET mechanisms clearly indicates that two Yb3+ ions are simultaneously excited with one high energy Pr3+ ∼490 nm photon. At higher Yb3+ ion concentrations (>PrYb0.5), the energy transfer mechanism dominantly follows the one-to-one photon normal ET process. ‘A:B’ values for PrYb1.0 and 1.5 samples indicate the equal probability of QC-CET as well as one-to-one normal ET. However, the Yb–Yb reabsorption losses significantly quench the Yb3+ emission at these or higher concentrations, which can be seen distinctly in the ∼450 nm laser excited emission spectra shown in the inset of Fig. 8.

Table 3 also presents the probable energy transfer mechanism with respect to Yb3+ ion concentration. Interestingly the results are in good agreement with the predicted energy transfer probability considering the radiative properties of the emission transition calculated from modified J–O theory as well as experimental evidence from Pr3+ excitation spectra (Fig. 2b) in the presence of Yb3+ ions, the sublinear power dependence of the Yb3+ ion NIR emission intensity on ∼450 nm laser excitation and absolute quantum yield measurements (Fig. 9). Overall, by considering the above experimental and theoretical results, the probable energy transfer mechanisms in the Pr3+/Yb3+ pair are presented in the partial energy level diagram shown in Fig. 10.

Conclusions
Experimental evidence for the QC-CET process in Pr3+/Yb3+ pairs has been demonstrated in a low phonon fluorotellurite glass system. The QC process is highly dependent on the active ion concentration and has been optimized to 0.5 mol% in the present glass system. The probabilities of the ET mechanisms have been explained considering the emission transition strengths and radiative properties of Pr3+ ions derived using modified Judd–Ofelt analysis. Since the Pr3+: 3P0 → 3H4 emission transition is the main contributor to the QC process, the decay dynamics of the 3P0 excited state were thoroughly examined in the absence and presence of acceptor Yb3+ ions. The weighted average lifetime of the 3P0 excited state was calculated by using a stretched exponential function and the effective Pr–Yb interaction mechanism was confirmed by using the IH model on donor decay times as a direct donor–acceptor energy transfer process. Though EBT has been noticed in the co-doped samples, the forward energy transfer mechanism, i.e., Pr3+ → Yb3+, is more efficient than EBT. The predicted slope values from log–log plots of 447 nm excitation laser pump power versus NIR emission intensity clearly indicate that the QC-CET process is highly dependent on the interaction length of Pr–Yb ions. As revealed through the relative ratios of the luminescence spectral analysis, it can be concluded that the Pr3+ → Yb3+ energy transfer takes place dominantly via QC-CET process in the PrYb0.5 sample and via one-to-one photon normal energy transfer process in other samples. The measured absolute quantum yield of the system was found to be 42% in the Pr3+/Yb3+ concentration optimised sample (PrYb0.5) owing to the effective QC-CET mechanism and is the highest value reported so far to the best of our knowledge.
