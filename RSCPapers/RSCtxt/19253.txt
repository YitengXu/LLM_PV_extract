A diverse range of MOFs was investigated for separation, capture, and storage of greenhouse gases and other pollutants (including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulfur compounds, and chemical warfare agents (CWAs)). It should however be noted that some drawbacks of MOFs are also found such as: poor selectivity, high energy and fiscal cost, low capacity, and difficulties in regeneration. Here, we provide an up-to-date review on the promising role of MOFs in the field of AQM in relation to the diverse available synthesis methods. As such, we hope to provide future directions such that MOFs/PCPs can make a bright contribution to air quality control.Pawan KumarDr Pawan Kumar obtained his Ph.D. (Engineering) from the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research-Central Scientific Instruments Organization (AcSIR-CSIO), Chandigarh (India).

Introduction
A wide array of anthropogenic hazardous pollutants including NOx, SOx, CO, H2S, NH3, hydrogen cyanide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs) are released from both static and mobile sources (e.g., industrial, transport, household, fossil fuel use, and many others). They are emitted into the atmosphere, taken up by plants, and ingested by animals to be bio-accumulated along the food chain up to the apex predator. Most of these pollutants are classified as being toxic/carcinogenic by varying degrees and pose a worldwide risk to the environment and human health.1–4
Exposure (through different pathways i.e., inhalation, dermal absorption, ingestion, etc.) to those hazardous pollutants can damage the immune, neurological, reproductive (e.g., reduced fertility), developmental, and respiratory systems of humans and animals.4–7 As summarized in recent articles, the toxicity levels of hazardous pollutants are established by different agencies on the basis of their metabolic impacts and physico-chemical properties.8,9 In summary, clean air is one of the most daunting challenges to improve the quality for life on Earth.
For more eco-friendlier and economical air quality management (AQM), much research has been done over the last 60 years.8,9 More recently, the practical applications of porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)/porous coordination polymers (PCPs) are being recognized for AQM because of their potential versatility, especially in capture and/or adsorption and the enhanced catalytic effects on air-borne pollutants due to high selectivity, chemical and thermal stability in the low and mid temperature range, moderate/low heat of adsorption, and enhanced mass uptake (e.g., through modification of the pore size).8–17 Thus, MOFs/PCPs are recognized as alternative sorbent or catalytic media to replace or support conventional materials (such as charcoal, activated carbon, aluminosilicates, and zeolites) for adsorbent and catalytic degradation applications (Fig. 1).12

Basically, a framework of coordinately bound metal ions with organic linkers can offer flexible chemical properties, extremely low framework density (0.2–0.6 g cm−3), wide range of tunable pore sizes, and specific high surface areas with quasi-infinite selection of crystal structures.18,19 More interestingly, various options for synthetic methods (solvothermal, hydrothermal, microprecipitation, layer by layer, etc.) for PCPs or MOFs facilitate the expansion of their applicabilities. For instance, MOF-5, MOF-177, and MOF-199 have demonstrated unique optical, electrochemical, and electromechanical properties to trap guest species.20–23 Additionally, improvement in the modification of a rigid MOF chemical structure (modified functionalized MOFs, isoreticular metal–organic frameworks (IRMOFs), multivariate metal–organic frameworks (MVTMOFs), etc.) allows to enhance chemical flexibility with reversible and variable pore sizes (and volumes) to simulate a ‘breathing effect’.18–23 Furthermore, excellent catalytic properties at the low and mid temperature ranges were regarded as the ideal goal of air purification treatment to produce low-risk secondary emissions to some extent; it should thus allow us to overcome many limitations encountered in sorptive approaches, e.g., secondary emission of captured pollutants after saturation.24,25 If one enables fine tuning of the catalytic properties of MOFs, then it possibly degrades toxic substances into nontoxic products. However, as there are only a limited number of reports detailing such processes, it is desirable to establish future scientific benchmarks that can be directly applicable to AQM.
Many advances in (human) lifestyle quality have been achieved through the improvements in air quality and its protection. A number of review articles and monographs have been reported to describe the fundamental science of MOFs on the applications of adsorptive and catalytic treatment of pollutants.18–28 In this review, we discuss the synthesis methods of MOF/PCP to account for their application toward AQM. To this end, the underlying capacity of MOFs has been evaluated in the viewpoint of their potent role in the technological advancement of AQM. The state of the art performance of MOFs in AQM is hence described by emphasizing a number of case studies made in field applications. The scope of this review will be extended further to address the future opportunities to furnish a desirable roadmap for their applications in AQM.
Current strategy for MOFs in AQM
The excellent identified features of MOFs for AQM applications can be achieved or maximized with the aid of effective strategies in their synthesis. For their synthesis, the combination of several variables like the choice of metal ions, organic linkers, solvents, synthetic/post synthetic methods, and experimental conditions is important.29,30 In addition, improved performance of MOFs has also been reported by modifying their structures (e.g., functionalization, pre-functionalization of organic linkers, mixed organic linkers, mixing of different metal nodes, thin film coating, hybrid textiles, and shell adsorbents).29–36 For instance, one target can be retained strongly in preference to others through particular surface chemistry offered by MOFs. Likewise, adsorption selectivity can be easily enhanced through a change in the structural properties towards coordination bonding, acid–base/electrostatic interactions, π-complex/H-bonding formation, and open metal sites on the pore surface in MOFs.37–40
In terms of cost-effectiveness, the synthesis cost of MOF/PCP is high relative to commercialized/conventional agents for AQM. As such, it becomes major question as to their practicality on megascale applications. For instance, if CO2 is adsorbed and desorbed by MOFs using a temperature-swing adsorption (TSA) approach, then both energy and financial cost are expected to be very uncompetitive compared to existing sorbents. According to a survey, the free on board (FOB) commodity prices (in USD) for two of the mostly studied MOFs (MOF-5 and MOF-177) are $200 kg−1 and $130k kg−1, respectively, which are more expensive in comparison to more conventional sorbent materials such as monoethanolamine ($2.66 kg−1) and quicklime ($0.18).41,42 In the case of MOF-TSA, the energy cost is high due to high parasitic energy consumption and in addition, the MOF material costs are extremely high. Thus, for an example, if two columns of MOFs are working 14 hours per cycle for capturing CO2 using a parasitic 220 megawatt (MW) power load from a 500 MW coal-fired power plant, the actual cost for CO2 capture and storage using MOF/PCP would be $0.66 M per day.41,42 In comparison, a conventional and well established material like MEA, would cost $0.26 kg−1 for CO2 capture and storage. Hence, MOF/PCP has currently a low appeal for future industrial applications for CO2 capture based on material and infrastructure costs. Therefore, an effective and low cost MOF synthesis strategy is a primary requirement for any industrial application. However, some excellent performance features (e.g., chemical tunability, high adsorption capacity, and adsorption selectivity) of MOF/PCP can partly offset the high material costs and thus play an increasingly promising role for AQM in the near future.
In addition, separation and regeneration of MOFs for the purpose of heterogeneous catalysis has been considered one of the most attractive research areas for AQM. The catalytic activity of MOFs has been investigated for the removal of toxic airborne gaseous chemicals.8,9,43,44 Basically, as the catalytic activity is highly contingent on MOF/PCP's crystal lattice structure, specific synthetic strategies for the selection and arrangement of basic building blocks (metal or organic linkers) with desired chemical structures and properties could be expected. Interestingly, heterogeneous catalysts in MOFs were thought to occur by the host–guest mechanism through transition state recognition, regulation of luminescence, and allosteric nature enforced by their physical, chemical, and environmental stimuli response.45,46 Nonetheless, a number of issues (waste disposal and high cost) still remain as the major drawbacks in the heterogeneous catalysts of porous materials. Therefore, there is a crucial need for functional engineering of MOF/PCP to attain excellent and specific catalysis properties with their advantageous physicochemical properties for their future practical utilizations.
MOFs as media for adsorptive removal of air pollutants
Among various AQM control techniques, the use of sorbents has been most developed and employed as an effective option to treat or remove toxic air pollutants. Various commercialized sorbent materials (e.g., activated carbon, zeolites, polymers, activated alumina, silica gel, etc.) have been evaluated and utilized for storage, separation, purification, and removal of pollutants in industry (Table 1).47–59 However, these existing conventional sorbents may not fully meet the high quality standard required for the future technological demands in terms of environmental regulations (e.g., disposal of spent sorbents) and more stringent “greener” energy requirements. This section will therefore focus on these issues and present an up-to-date appraisal and information on numerous MOFs reported in the literature.

Fundamental aspect and mechanism of adsorptive removal by MOF/PCP
The unique permanent porous structure of MOFs (in air) has been recognized which led to practical AQM applications.60,61 The PCP/MOF adsorption properties depend on well-known factors: [1] solute hydrophobicity, [2] sorbent surface area and porosity, and [3] organic carbon content and mineral composition.61–63 In addition, the fundamental mechanism for selective adsorption is favored by various adsorption mechanisms (such as electrostatic interaction, acid–base interaction, hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking/interaction, and hydrophobic interaction) for AQM (Fig. 2).63 These different classes of MOF mechanism have also been described for hazardous organics from aqueous media.63 This well organized review was helpful to explain the selective adsorption mechanism with respect to MOFs. In this review, we are mainly focusing to describe the fundamental aspects of these diverse mechanisms for the selective adsorption processes mainly to deal with various airborne species.

Adsorption isotherms have generally been interpreted by well-known theories developed by Freundlich, Langmuir, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET).8,9 Basically, an adsorption isotherm is the plot of adsorbate mass on the surface of adsorbent as function of adsorbate partial pressure at constant temperature. The recommended definitions and characteristics of adsorption isotherm hysteresis have been discussed in an IUPAC report (1985) with an update being scheduled in 2015 to classify the effect of important variables (e.g., pore size, isotherm type, and hysteresis loops).64 In this review, we have followed the definition of the adsorption isotherm and hysteresis given in the older IUPAC report (1985).64,65Fig. 3 illustrates the classification of different fundamental isotherms and hysteresis types.60,64 For the sorptive removal by MOFs, the adsorption isotherm can provide the direct information regarding their hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature. In some mesoporous materials, hysteresis loops are always close and the adsorbate remains in the pores even at near zero pressure. In such materials, high temperature should either lead to desorption or irreversible adsorption in pores with the same size as the adsorbate molecules.8,65,66 The adsorption processes in MOFs can proceed according to their chemical nature and structural stability in aqueous or non-aqueous phase with isotherm type I (microporous MOFs with strong adsorbate–adsorbent interactions), III (an unusual hybrid with a larger pore size), and IV (mesoporous MOFs with ≥20 Å diameter pore size).65,66 Note that type II isotherms have been investigated for unrestricted monolayer–multilayer adsorption from non-porous or macroporous materials.65,66 However, there should be very different adsorption mechanisms between different MOFs, e.g., MOF-53 due to its flexible chemical nature and stability.65,66

MOFs for the removal/storage of greenhouse gas (GHG): CO2
In the last few years, a large number of MOFs were investigated to generate extensive experimental data on the strategic adsorption of pollutants for industrial applications. The adsorption, storage, and removal of CO2 under standard temperature pressure (STP) conditions have been reported for more than 130 MOFs (e.g., Cu-BTTri, CPO-27, HKUST-1, bio-MOF-11, MIL-53, MOF-5, MIL-100, MIL-101, and YO-MOF).67–71 The performance or capacity of CO2 capture by MOFs can be classified by the following criteria: open metal sites, flexible chemical structure, and functionalization.69 Likewise, the combination of open metal sites and H-bonding donor–acceptor groups in MOFs should contribute to the efficient removal of other gaseous pollutants as well. Functionalization or surface modification of MOFs (e.g., with ethylene diamine and other alkyl amines) has been investigated to seek for the extension of their applications in more broad areas (as discussed in Section 2).
In this section, the adsorption capacity of the modified/functionalized MOFs is explored for low molecular weight gases at low pressure with a special emphasis on CO2 (Table 2).72–82 For example, Britt et al.72 investigated open magnesium site based Mg-MOF-74 for the CO2 capture with 8.9 wt% dynamic capacity which underwent facile CO2 release at a significantly lower temperature (80 °C). These results were obtained in ambient atmosphere and regeneration of Mg-MOF-74 was also demonstrated on the breakthrough apparatus under a N2 atmosphere at at least 250 °C before use.72 Recently, the synthesis of a highly robust unprecedented anionic MOF (JUC-132) based on an aromatic 12-carboxyl ligand 1,3,5-tris(3,5-di(3,5-dicarboxy-phenyl-1-yl)-phenyl-1-yl)benzene (H12TDDPB) and two Cd clusters (Cd2(COO)6 and Cd(COO)4) was investigated for selective adsorption of CO2 over CH4.73 JUC-132 exhibited high heat of adsorption for CO2 with high selectivity over CH4 due to high interactions between CO2 and filling of dimethylammonium ions in the pores. He et al.73 reported uptake values of activated JUC-132 for CO2 (2.72 mmol g−1 and 1.71 mmol g−1 at 1 atm) and CH4 (0.28 mmol g−1 at 1 atm) at different temperatures (273 K and 278 K, respectively).

To enhance the adsorption capacity of CO2, the capacity of several virgin (and some modified/functionalized) MOFs is compared in Table 2.72–82 A simple modification or functionalization of the Mg(DOBDC) MOF was carried out with ethylene diamine (ED) to improve the adsorption properties of CO2 at low partial pressures.76 Based on theoretical and experimental analyses, these authors confirmed that one ED molecule was added to each unit cell of the Mg(DOBDC) MOF. This modification allowed improved CO2 adsorption–desorption temperature swings (at both low and high temperatures) with increased CO2 adsorption capacity at ultra-low CO2 partial pressures at 1 atm total pressure together with improved Mg(DOBDC) MOF regenerability over 20 swings. According to this report, the first MOF was demonstrated to yield significant adsorption capacities from simulated ambient air (e.g., 400 ppm CO2 at 1 bar pressure) compared to the common conventional adsorbents (e.g., amine-oxide composites).76 Similarly, diamine-functionalized en-Mg2(dobpdc) was achieved through post-modification to yield exceptionally high sorption capacities e.g., 3.62 mmol g−1, 13.7 wt% for both ambient air (4.0 × 10−4 bar of CO2) and typical post-combustion flue gas (0.15 bar of CO2) at 1 bar.76 The adsorption of CO2 onto the free amines of MOF/PCP led to the formation of carbamic acid which significantly increased the CO2 adsorption capacity. Finally, to facilitate the practical utilization of MOFs, the adsorption–desorption cycling of CO2 was optimized at the real dilute concentrations of air and flue gas.76
A pioneering study on the unprecedented mechanism of step-shaped isotherms was carried out by McDonald et al.80 Their study demonstrated that the replacement of Mg2+ with other divalent metal ions (e.g., Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, and Zn2+) can tailor the CO2 adsorption isotherm steps depending on the metal–amine bond strength. Here, the diamine-appended MOF/PCP behaved as ‘phase-change’ adsorbents to facilitate the efficient capture of CO2.80 The CO2 adsorption was thus improved via thermodynamically non-spontaneous reactions at low pressure which had been demonstrated by spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and adsorption analysis. Actually, the proton transfer and nucleophilic attack of N proceeded simultaneously on a CO2 molecule to form ammonium carbamate. The amine coordination at the next metal site was then destabilized by diamine-appended MOF/PCP to initiate the cooperative adsorption of CO2 by a chain reaction (Fig. 4).80

MOFs for the removal/storage of common gases and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs)
The utilization of MOFs for low molecular weight gases other than CO2 has also been studied extensively for their storage potential (e.g., for H2 and CH4 as alternative vehicle fuels).83–96 Other adsorbent media for low molecular weight gasses (such as H2, CH4, N2O, and N2) using various approaches have been tested. In this respect, Eddaoudi et al.84 reported a remarkable improvement in CH4 storage capacity by using a series of isoreticular MOFs (IRMOFs). Likewise, IRMOFs-6 with an exceptionally high surface area and pore volumes was also tested for sorption measurement 10 mmol (CH4) per g at 40 atm but at lower pressures, e.g., 1 atm; the sorption is only ∼0.4 mmol (CH4) per g, implying good PSA performance at constant temperature (Fig. 5A and B).84 In an analogous way, Duren et al. (2004) evaluated the storage capacity of CH4 based on molecular modeling of IRMOFs, two zeolites, MCM-41, and carbon nanotubes.85 Accordingly, the amount of adsorbed CH4 per volume increased by 23% and 36%, when 1,4-tetrabromobenzenedicarboxylate and 9,10-anthracenedicarboxylate were used as organic linkers, respectively. Their experimental study underlined the usefulness of the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation method as a screening tool to identify new materials for adsorption applications and for the design of novel materials. For hydrogen adsorption studies, similar approaches were also investigated.86,87 Furthermore, GCMC simulation results demonstrated that chemical structural properties of MOFs with unsaturated metal centers can be incorporated to increase the magnitude of hydrogen interaction within their framework.90 Such a molecular modelling method was also utilized to determine the adsorption of ammonia for a number of MOFs (MIL-47, IRMOF-10, IRMOF-1, and IRMOF-16).87

It is found that the selection of different functional groups (e.g., –OH, –NH2, and –COOH) and metal ions (Cu++, Ag+, Na+ or K+) can be made to enhance chemisorption hydrogen-bonding between MOFs and ammonia for improved adsorbate removal.88–96 For example, Britt et al.91 investigated NH3 adsorption and dynamic breakthrough using –NH2 functionalized MOFs (IRMOF-3). The adsorption capacity of IRMOF-3 was found to be 6.2 mmol g−1 which was superior to the most commonly studied MOF-5 (0.35 mmol g−1 at 3.6 atm) as a reference. This may be due to the presence of Zn4O SBUs in MOF-5 which becomes unstable when exposed to ammonia. However, in the case of IRMOF-3, the capacity of ammonia adsorption increased due to hydrogen bonding between the –NH2 pendant groups and ammonia.90–92 In another study, –OH functionalization of DUT-6 was found to improve the uptake of ammonia from 12.0 to 16.4 mmol g−1 at 1 bar and 298 K (Fig. 6A and B).93 Such an enhancement in sorption capacity was accounted for by strong binding between ammonia and functional groups (–OH).93

For the removal of ammonia from air, a number of Zr-based MOFs (UiO-66, UiO-66-OH, UiO-66-(OH)2, UiO-66-NO2, UiO-66-NH2, UiO-66-SO3H, and UiO-66-(COOH)2) were also investigated.94 A comparison of performance was made between those Zr-based functionalized MOFs synthesized by a solvothermal method. Accordingly, different functional groups such as –OH, –NO2, –NH2, –SO3H, and –COOH played an important role in ammonia adsorption processes under dry and humid (80% RH) conditions due to the competitive interactions between water and ammonia molecules for the active sites. Interestingly, –COOH and –SO3H based functionalization of Zr-MOFs showed lower ammonia capacity as compared to –OH and NH2 (UiO-66-OH and UiO-66-NH2) due to the presence of high and least bulky functional groups which caused significant reduction in the framework porosity (surface area and pore volume), respectively. Finally, the adsorption capacity of ammonia by UiO-66-OH was reported to be ∼5.7 mmol g−1 under dry conditions.94 The GCMC simulations were also carried out for the practical applications of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) using a MIL-53(Al).94 These authors investigated the feasibility of MOFs for methane purification at industrial-scale. The adsorption capacity of MIL-53(Al) (4.3 mol kg−1 at 3.5 bar) was assessed against CO2 and CH4 by dynamic experiments in a fixed-bed reactor at 303 K. As MIL-53(Al)-based separation is found to be highly energy-efficient, the proposed PSA was suggested as a promising option for the separation of CO2 and CH4.94
MOFs have also been identified as attractive sorbent candidates for PSA separation of O2. Many research groups investigated the O2 selectivity against H2, CO2, or N2 based on the tunability of MOFs with unsaturated metal centers (UMCs).91–99 For example, the selectivity of O2 over N2 was examined through utilization of two different MOF (Cr2(BTC)3vs. Fe2(DOBDC)) prototypical phases that have accessibility to UMCs for single gas sorption studies at 298 K.97 Likewise, the combination of experimental and molecular modeling was tested more recently using metal-substituted Cu-BTC (HKUST-1) with enhanced O2 selectivity versus N2.97 Here, the structure–property relationship was examined between the metal centers and the gas adsorption (O2 or N2) at variable temperatures (77 K vs. 273–298 K) (Fig. 7A and B).97 A comparative analysis was also made for O2versus N2 sorption capacities and binding energy dependency on temperature based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and GCMC.97 Moreover, MOFs have also been studied for purification and storage of C1, C2, and C3 light hydrocarbons.98,99 As part of such efforts, Fu et al.99 recently reported FIR-51 (CPs/MOF) for selective sorption of light hydrocarbons (Fig. 8A and B). The synthesized MOF/PCP was highly stable (thermally and chemically), exhibiting high storage capacity (3.12–7.06 mmol g−1) for light hydrocarbons with high selectivity for C2 and C3 over methane at 273 and 294 K (Fig. 8B).99

Presently, the efficient adsorption removal of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) is one of the most attractive research areas in AQM. This section summarizes the recent efforts made on the adsorptive removal of those pollutants contained in fuel, water, and air by employing advanced MOFs. For the adsorptive removal of H2S, VOCs, and PAHs, the feasibility of many MOFs (such as Material de Institut Lavoisier (MIL), IRMOFs, and M-CPO) has been investigated intensively (Table 2). The interactions between HAPs and different MOFs should proceed via diverse mechanisms; (a) adsorption through coordinately unsaturated sites, (b) acid–base interactions, (c) complex formation, (d) hydrogen bonds, (e) electrostatic interactions, and (f) lattice breathing.99–105
Recently, amino functionalized UIO-66 was reported to absorb pyridines with the hydrogen bonding and base–base repulsion in both liquid and vapour phases.101 The possible interaction between pyridine and amino functionalized UIO-66 is shown in Fig. 9A.101 The temperature effect on such absorption by functionalized UIO-66 is also illustrated in Fig. 9B–D.101 It was concluded that the uptake rate of pyridine increased for both vapor and liquid phases in line with the amino group content in UiO-66s. The specific and favorable interactions between pyridine and NH2-UIO-66 should be carefully interpreted with the opening of pores of UiO-66 with increasing temperature to accommodate pyridine.95 Likewise, a number of other similar studies are shown in Table 2.100–105

In a recent study, the absorption capacity of Cu-BTC was examined against three toxic hydride gases (ammonia, arsine, and hydrogen sulfide) with the changes in its color (Fig. 10A).105 The capacity of Cu-BTC for these hydride gases was determined from a micro-breakthrough test using a real-world packed-bed under both dry and high humidity conditions (Fig. 10B).105 These authors demonstrated the potential of Cu-BTC as an effective adsorbent for ammonia. They also used it for sensing purposes through colorimetric and fluorescence changes. Interestingly, a recent computational study on Cu-BTC has been made to validate its potential for ammonia capture in the presence of water through quantum chemical methods.104,105 The free energies of binding were calculated for the first time for ammonia and water separately with a series of metal catecholates (i.e. Be-, Cu-, Zn-, Pt-, and Pd-catecholates). As a result, Pt- and Cu-catecholates were found to be the excellent choice for ammonia capturing under humid and dry conditions, respectively.101–105

MOFs for catalytic degradation-fundamental aspects and mechanism
In Table 3, a list of MOFs employed for the catalytic degradation of airborne pollutants are summarized based on the synthesis processes, active metal ions, and the basic mechanism.106–112 As long as the precise synthesis plan is established and used, different catalytic sites can be tailored in MOFs such as (A) embedding of their active sites in the cavities, (B) the use of postsynthetic methods, and (C) incorporation (or encapsulation) of guest species (such as functional groups, metal nanoparticles, and other guest molecules) (Fig. 11).45

Recently, Al, Zn, Fe, Zr, and Cu-based MOFs have been utilized for photo-catalytic applications to degrade chemicals (of varying toxicity) such as phenols, alcohols, and toxic chemical warfare agents (CWAs) (Fig. 12).8 For example, Wang et al. first reported the UiO-67 (Zr-MOF) heterogeneous catalyst for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, water oxidation, and visible light-driven organic photocatalysis (Fig. 13A and B).106 This doped MOF/PCP behaved like an efficient aerobic oxidation catalyst for thioanisole, as shown in Fig. 13B.106 Moreover, the doped MOF is convenient to reuse for heterogeneous catalysis, while effective enough to provide mechanistic insights into CO2 reduction.106 Similarly, Shen et al. reported efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysis for selective oxidation of alcohols with the reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) using a multifunctional Zr-2-NH2-benzenedicarboxylate (UiO-66(NH2)).107 In another study, photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants was also achieved by the chemical oxidation with strong oxidative agents. Because of the transition metal species present in MOFs, oxidants can be generated for the activation of free radicals. For example, MIL-53(Fe) was tested for the decolorization of methylene blue (MB) dye.108 MIL-53(Fe) exhibited the first-order kinetics in the photocatalytic decolorization of MB.108 The rate of photocatalysis decreased in the order of (H2O2 > (NH4)2S2O8 > KBrO3) under normal UV-vis light irradiation. However, under visible light irradiation, the ordering changed to (NH4)2S2O8 > H2O2 > KBrO3. Interestingly, MIL-53(Fe) showed the first-order kinetics with the rate constant (0.0133 min−1 and 0.0036 min−1) which is comparable with TiO2 under UV-vis light and visible light irradiation, respectively.108

MOFs as media for catalytic degradation of air pollutants
Although a number of MOFs have been employed for catalytic treatment, there are only a few reports that actually covered or described their applications toward diverse air pollutants. Many excellent features of MOFs (such as controlled fine structures, dispersion of active sites, high crystallinity, and no theoretical pore size limitations) have been recognized for catalytic applications.112–114 However, to employ these advanced materials in such aspect, one has to overcome the major conventional problems such as secondary emissions after adsorbent saturation.8,9,112–114 Nonetheless, the versatile nature of MOFs is advantageous to use in a variety of catalytic degradations. For example, Férey et al. (2005) demonstrated the potent role of a nanoporous metal–organic framework (e.g., MIL-101) through immobilization of Keggin heteropolytungstate within the cages of the framework.112 Interestingly, a rigid crystal structure of MOFs with large pores and outstanding surface area exhibited a great structural resistance to air, water, and common solvents with thermal treatment.112
The potential role of MOFs as a photocatalytic agent has been proposed for artificial photosynthesis wherein gaseous CO2 can be converted into useful products.98–103 However, as of now, MOFs have not been studied intensively in that respect. For example, the [ReI(CO)3(dcbpy)Cl]-Zr6O4(OH)4(bpdc) MOF yielded carbon monoxide from CO2 and H2O at a rate of 42 μmol (CO) per h per g under 450 W Xe lamp irradiance.115 In a practical sense, one may consider a hypothetical case in which a 500 MW power station burning coal (specific energy content of 24 MJ kg−1 and 85% carbon content) is operating at 50% thermal efficiency. Then, the amount of CO2 produced from such operation would correspond to 11000 tonne per day. Hence, in order to convert CO2 + 2H2O into CH4 and 2O2 (ΔH = 890 kJ mol−1),116 the area of a hypothetical MOF/PCP/solar farm, operating at 100% quantum efficiency and 12 hour averaged solar irradiance of 100 W m−2 should be ∼52 km2 (maximum CO2 uptake is 215 g m−2 day−1). If the following conditions are taken (MOF catalyst bed = 1 mm deep, MOF density = 0.5 tonne m−3, and MOF cost = 200000 USD tonne−1), then the amount required and cost would be ∼26300 tonnes and 53 B USD, respectively. Based on this proposed hypothetical case for the utilization of the MOF/solar farm area, conversion of CO2 into useful products is impractical for industrial applications. In other sense, this area still needs immense efforts to meet economic feasibility.
The use of MOFs for catalytic degradation of chemical warfare agents
MOFs have also been investigated for the catalytic degradation of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) due to the possibly significant environmental contamination problem after their deployment.117–121 Usually, redox or acid–base active MOFs have been used as catalyst agents for degradation processes. Interestingly, CWAs can be degraded either by oxidation and by hydrolysis after exposure. For the interested readers, catalytic degradation mechanisms for selected CWAs can be found in a study by Mondloch et al. (Fig. 14).119 These authors reported both experimental and computational analyses of catalytic hydrolysis of nerve agent stimulants like dimethyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (DMNP) and O-pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate (soman) using NU-1000 and NU-1000-dehyd (Zr-MOFs), respectively.119 In their experimental study, catalytic hydrolysis of DMNP by NU-1000 was carried out efficiently in aqueous N-ethylmorpholine buffered solution (at pH 10) with the formation of p-nitrophenoxide monitored by visible-region adsorption spectroscopy at Emax = 407 (Fig. 14A and B).119 In this report, computational simulations have also been performed on soman and O-ethyl S-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonothiolate (VX) using Cr-MOFs. Cr-MOFs were the fastest heterogeneous catalyst of all tested MOFs (e.g., HKUST-1) due to the π-stacking behaviour of DMNP and more general attractive van der Waals interactions between the organic linker and the alkyl group of GD or its analog.119

Catalytic degradation of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DIFP) sarin simulant was also investigated similarly using both NH2-MIL-53(Al) and NH2-MIL-101(Al) (Al-NH3-MOF) through the incorporation of highly nucleophilic 4-methylaminopyridine residues.120 This progressive strategy was developed by depositing the MOF particles on a reactive adhesive material composed of polyisobutylene/toluene diisocyanate (PIB/TDI) blends. These modified-MOFs exhibited high mechanical flexibility with the capability of degrading diisopropyl fluorophosphates (DFP) due to their reactivity between the covalent attachment and protective surfaces.120
The detoxification of some CWAs (e.g., VX and soman) by HKUST-1 (Cu-MOF) was monitored by NMR.121 However, Cu-MOFs underwent slow degradation of these CWAs (more than one day (VX) and 13 h (soman)) due to the Lewis acidic nature and the presence of Cu open metal sites. This type of the interaction was found to be crucial in determining the hydrolysis processes between Cu-MOFs and CWAs.113 It was also found that the catalytic activity of H3[(Cu4Cl)3(btc)8]2[PW12O40]3(C4H12N)6 (NENU-11) should be stimulated by the incorporation of acid polyoxometalates in the pore structure.113 Consequently, NENU-11 exhibited a good sorption behavior (15.5 molecules per formula unit) for a model nerve agent dimethylmethylphosphonate (DMMP) while facilitating its decomposition (Fig. 15).121

Summary
It is found that most MOFs reported recently in the literature (2005–2015) have a number of shortcomings for AQM applications. Most of these studies generally lacked a systematic approach to evaluate practical performance metrics in some important aspects, e.g., (a) low final product cost and well established synthesis methods, (b) hydrothermal stability, (c) chemical stability towards humidity and temperature, (d) simple regeneration at low energy penalty, and (e) recycling and disposal of the spent material. Because of such a research gap in this emerging area, one needs a systematic evolution of MOFs for air purification to comply with international guidelines (e.g., OSHA/NIOSH). Furthermore, it is very important that every investigation on the MOFs for air purification be evaluated at partial pressures of environmental pollutants at ambient air pressure (1 bar). However, such specific conditions for the adsorption are found to be difficult to attain to cover all different permanent and/or toxic gases (such as CO2, O2, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, chlorine, iodine and cyanogen chloride) due to the physical interaction of functional groups of MOFs. Therefore, specific chemistry of MOFs needs to be specified for any practical application in AQM.
The functional tailorability of MOFs is recognized as a great merit to offer improved performance for capture and storage of gaseous pollutants over conventional materials (such as MEA, activated carbon, or other filtration media). In addition, direct and low cost functional and hierarchical pore structures of MOFs are desirable for developing novel approaches for post-synthetic modification (such as controlled etching). Such applications may open a great opportunity for their practical implementation at industrial scale. It is anticipated that in the near future, research and development on MOFs will find its special need to fulfill various demands for AQM.
