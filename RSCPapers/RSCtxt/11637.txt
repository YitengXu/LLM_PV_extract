    , Accepted 4th June 2016First published on 7th June 2016AbstractA solar-bio-powered refining concept has been developed to establish sustainable lignocellulosic biodiesel production. The refining concept applies a combined hydrolysis process without detoxification to release sugars from corn stover, uses aerobic oleaginous fungal fermentation to accumulate lipids on the hydrolysate for biodiesel production, and implements solar-bio-power generation to satisfy the energy demand. The results demonstrate that system integration of solar-bio-power generation and fungal lipid accumulation is an effective approach to create a sustainable lignocellulosic biodiesel production. Compared to concentrated solar power (CSP) units, photovoltaics (PV) are a more suitable solar technology to satisfy the energy needs of the lignocellulosic biodiesel production. The PV-bio-powered lignocellulosic biodiesel production has a net energy output of 28.70 MJ kg−1 biodiesel produced, and a net energy ratio (NER) of 1.08.
1. Introduction
Biofuels are defined as liquid or gaseous fuels that are principally produced using biomass as a feedstock.1 Currently, most biofuels on the market are those termed “first-generation”, which are produced from various food crops such as corn, soybean, canola, or other vegetable oils. First-generation biofuels face their own drawbacks. First, any increased demand for first-generation fuel crops may result in land use changes. If areas containing a significant amount of stored carbon such as forests or peat bogs are converted to agriculture production (which stores comparatively less soil-organic carbon compared to forests and bogs), then a net release of sequestered carbon into the atmosphere may occur, creating a carbon debt that could possibly take the biofuel production system decades to pay off.2 Another issue for first-generation biofuels is the fact that their increased production may lead to competition with food resources, and cause shortages and price increases of feed commodities.
One possible solution is the use of lignocellulosic sources as biofuel feedstock, termed “second-generation” biofuels, which could avoid competing with food resources for productive land, while providing environmental benefits. Lignocellulosic materials represent the most abundant source of renewable carbon on earth with approximately 140 billion tons produced annually, including forest and agricultural residues, pulp and paper waste, municipal solid waste, and dedicated woody and herbaceous energy crops.3 In order for lignocellulosic biofuels to be considered as a viable alternative to petroleum-based fuels, they must demonstrate that they can be produced in a sustainable manner. This means that an ideal biorefinery system should have a positive net energy output; otherwise it is no different from a traditionally energy-intensive pulp mill of cellulosic fiber production that has a negative net energy balance.4 Evaluating a biofuel system must start with a basic mass and energy analysis. The energy balance results can be expressed as the ratio of energy produced to energy consumed during biofuel production, known as the net energy ratio (NER).5,6 Increase of NER is key to establishing a sustainable biorefining industry.
Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass could be applied to supplement power to biorefineries and improve their NER. Among these sources, solar energy with the advantages of abundance and availability represents an excellent candidate to be combined with a lignocellulosic refinery to produce biofuels. Many solar technologies have been developed in the past several decades such as silicon wafer photovoltaics (PV), thin-film PV, low-temperature solar thermal systems, and concentrated solar power systems.7–11 According to their conversion mechanisms, these solar technologies are mainly divided into two categories: PV and solar thermal. PV uses semi-conducting materials to convert sunlight into direct current electricity, while solar thermal uses heat absorbers or reflective surfaces to collect solar energy for both low temperature (i.e., hot water heater) and high temperature (i.e., concentrated solar power technologies) applications. Thin film PV and parabolic trough power generation (a concentrated solar power) as commercially used solar technologies are selected by this study to power lignocellulosic biofuel production. Integrating these solar technologies with lignocellulosic biofuel production is expected to lead to a novel biorefining concept that replaces fossil fuel consumption during the process and improves NER for next-generation biofuel production.
Regarding lignocellulosic biofuel production, much effort has been made in the process development and system analyses of ethanol production.12–19 There are no detailed analyses that have been conducted on microbial lipid accumulation on lignocellulosic feedstock, nor on a solar-bio-powered lignocellulosic biodiesel refinery. Current research and development efforts on lipid accumulation from lignocelluloses mainly focus on oleaginous yeasts.20–24 Some yeast strains present high cell density and lipid yield on lignocellulosic sugars, such as Lipomyces starkeyi, Rhodosporidium toruloides and Trichosporon fermentans, which are able to utilize glucose as the carbon source to accumulate 56%, 67.5% and 62% intracellular lipids, respectively.25–27 However, key technical roadblocks for yeast lipid accumulation on lignocellulosic materials are (1) inhibitory effects of carbohydrate and lignin degrading compounds (acetic acid, furfural, HMF, and phenolic compounds) and (2) incomplete utilization of all potential carbon sources (glucose, xylose, and organic acids) in the hydrolysate (Table 1).23,24,28,29 Compared to oleaginous yeasts, oleaginous fungi demonstrate the capabilities to effectively overcome these technical issues and still maintain comparable lipid accumulation on lignocellulosic hydrolysates.20,30–33Mortierella isabellina is a filamentous fungus that has shown such capabilities.30–32,34,35 It has been reported that M. isabellina can effectively utilize not only glucose and xylose but also acetic acid as its carbon sources for lipid accumulation.36,37 The fungal strain has also demonstrated a high tolerance to the carbohydrate and lignin degrading compounds (Table 1).36 Moreover, the lipid profiles of M. isabellina are shown to be of good quality for biodiesel production.38 Therefore, M. isabellina fermentation was used by this study to carry out the system analysis. A combined hydrolysis process has been developed by our previous study to improve the overall efficiency of M. isabellina lipid accumulation on the lignocellulosic feedstock via removing the chemical neutralization and detoxification steps after feedstock pretreatment,37 though, the system energy consumption is still high, and the corresponding energy balance is not favorable for a commercial lignocellulosic biodiesel production. The goal of this study is to integrate solar and biological technologies to create a sustainable aerobic biofuel refining concept. The mass and energy balance was first conducted based on individual unit operations, and then a system analysis on the entire solar-bio-powered system was carried out to conclude an energy positive lignocellulosic biodiesel refinery.

2. Approach
In keeping with the principles of mass and energy balances, we first determined the major unit operations in a lignocellulosic biodiesel refinery capable of producing 10 million gallons of biodiesel a year, including (1) corn stover collection & transportation to the biorefinery, (2) corn stover pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, (3) lignin processing, (4) fungal lipid fermentation, (5) fungal biomass drying, (6) lipid extraction and transesterification, (7) wastewater treatment, and (8) solar-bio-power generation. The boundary for the process is shown in Fig. 1. The details of individual unit operations are described in the supplemental material. Second, we aimed to conduct a mass and energy inventory in order to calculate the net energy production and thus determine the amount of solar and biological energy needed to create a sustainable biodiesel production. Two solar technologies, photovoltaics (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP), were investigated to be combined with lignin, glycerol, and methane combustion to generate the power to satisfy the energy needs of the system (Fig. 2). Since the power generation principles of PV and CSP are different, the PV-biological power and CSP-biological power were compared to delineate the effects of different solar technologies on the energy balance of the sustainable lignocellulosic biodiesel production system. An appropriate solar technology for the production system is selected based on the NER of the system and heat/electricity distribution. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to identify those factors that may have significant impacts on the overall energy balance. A functional system with 1 kg of biodiesel production serves to quantify the mass and energy products throughout the biorefinery. Fertilizer inputs to the feedstock were converted to common energy units based on their life-cycle energy content, which is defined as the energy needed to produce and transport them. The energy equivalent for fuel sources in the refinery were taken to be their low heating value (LHV). The electricity usage associated with the pumping of products and workspace lighting was neglected as those demands vary between plants as the electricity consumed by said operations is relatively small compared to key unit operations such as fermentation.39 It should also be noted that when converting electricity consumption to a common energy unit, the conversion factor of 3.61 MJ kW−1 h−1 is used.

Meade County, Kansas (37.28, −100.4), one of the major corn producing counties in Kansas, is selected as the location of the studied system. Meade County has an annual corn stover production of approximately 500000 metric ton (corresponding to an annual corn production of 410000 metric ton) that can satisfy the feedstock demand of the 10 million gallon biodiesel production. Environmental variations (i.e., temperature change during a year) are not explored as this study focused on the basic net energy production of a conceptualized biorefinery. Facility construction and the production of capital equipment are excluded from the scope of this study as well. Since fungal biodiesel production from lignocellulosic material is still at the research stage, there are no current operating facilities to serve as a foundation for the analysis. However, many of the unit operations identified are currently used in other industries, and it is reasonable to assume that if and when such a process is developed on an industrial scale it will resemble existing practices as closely as possible.40 Thus, much of the processing data are based on current peer-reviewed resources and industry-derived reports. Thermodynamic calculations were utilized for certain process steps where existing data were deemed incomplete or inadequate, such as drying of biomass after fermentation, the heat energy required for pretreatment reactions, and the cooling demand of fungal fermentation.
3. Results and discussion
Mass and energy data for the solar-bio-powered lignocellulosic biodiesel production system are presented in Tables 2–5 and Fig. 3 and 4. The studied biodiesel production requires 15.09 kg dry corn stover and 29.34 kg water (net amount) along with other chemical and enzyme substances to produce 1 kg lignocellulosic biodiesel (Fig. 3). The net energy output for the system without combined solar-bio-power generation is −232.80 MJ kg−1 biodiesel (Table 5). This equates to an NER value of 0.39. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the lipid yield is the most important parameter to significantly improve the net energy output (reducing a large amount of the energy demand) (Table 3). The net energy output for the system without combined solar-bio-power generation is changed by 33% responding to a 20% change in lipid yield (Table 3). The net energy outputs are improved to 28.70 and 693.55 MJ kg−1 biodiesel for the systems with PV- and CSP-bio-power generation, respectively; the corresponding NER values are changed to 1.08 and 2.82 (Table 5). The detailed interpretation for individual unit operations and integrated systems are discussed as follows.

3.1 Lignocellulosic biodiesel production

3.1.1 Corn stover collection and transportation. 
Mass balance data in Fig. 3 reveal that nitrogen fertilizer replacement is the largest individual input for this unit operation at 0.13 kg per kg biodiesel, followed by potassium fertilizer replacement (0.11 kg per kg biodiesel), diesel fuel for harvesting and transporting stover (0.09 kg per kg biodiesel), and phosphorus fertilizer replacement (0.01 kg per kg biodiesel).
The energy consumption for corn stover collection and transportation amounted to 12.03 MJ kg−1 biodiesel (Table 2). Due to the fact that the corn stover available in Meade County is enough to satisfy the feedstock demand of the studied 10 million gallon biodiesel production (within 30 mile radius), extra energy for feedstock transportation is not needed. Paralleling its mass input, nitrogen fertilizer replacement is shown to be the greatest energy consumer at 6.33 MJ kg−1 biodiesel, followed by diesel fuel for harvesting and transportation (4.69 MJ kg−1 biodiesel), potassium fertilizer replacement (0.88 MJ kg−1 biodiesel), and phosphorus fertilizer replacement (0.12 MJ kg−1 biodiesel) (supplemental mass and energy balance analysis). The energy demand for fertilizer replacement significantly outweighs that for harvesting and transportation to the biorefinery. This is largely owing to the intense energy production of agricultural chemicals, particularly nitrogen fertilizers. Even though advances by the fertilizer industry have greatly increased the efficiency of nitrogen production over the last several decades, and may continue to play a role, near-term energy reductions will most likely be achieved through optimizing fertilizer application rates. This poses its own issues, as there is little agreement in the literature with the proper nutrient replacement scheme after corn stover harvest. Petrolia indicates that in a corn–soybean rotation, nitrogen supplementation would be unnecessary after stover harvest41 while Brechbill and Tyner show nitrogen replacement values nearly identical to those assumed in this study.42 Sensitivity analysis on fertilizer application rates shown in Table 4 indicates that slight reductions in the nitrogen fertilizer input can lead to some energy savings. It is clear that the best nutrient management practice could play a role in energy saving of corn stover collection and transportation operations, though at the present time there is much uncertainty regarding this unit operation.


3.1.2 Corn stover pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. 
Mass balance for corn stover pretreatment shows significant inputs for both corn stover (15.09 kg per kg biodiesel) and water (132.34 kg per kg biodiesel) (Fig. 3). These two components represent the largest single mass contributors in the entire system. The water input during pretreatment accounts for over 98% of all water consumption. Though water usage is significant, the combined hydrolysis process actually serves to conserve process water compared to traditional pretreatment methods. Besides water conservation, the combined hydrolysis also reduces chemical usage and improves the energy efficiency of the pretreatment.37 Without combined hydrolysis, water and chemical consumption would be double their current values.
Total energy consumption of this unit operation amounted to 36.83 MJ kg−1 biodiesel, or roughly 10% of the total energy demand (Table 2). The bulk of this energy comes from the thermal heat required to raise the pretreatment slurry to its final temperature. Due to the water conservation during combined hydrolysis, significant energy savings are realized, as any additional water input would likewise require heat energy for sterilization. This means that any reduction in water usage leads to a proportional drop in energy consumption.
The thermal energy demand is largely dependent on the reaction temperature, time, and solid loading. Sensitivity analysis shows that solid loading is a more sensitive parameter than the reaction temperature and time (Table 3). Increasing the corn stover loading from 10% to 12% results in 3% of reduction in the net energy deficit. Therefore, adjustments in the pretreatment process should focus efforts on increasing the solid loading. However, it should be noted that at higher solid loading, additional water must be added in order to match the dilution requirements imposed by the M. isabellina fermentation, thus the energy savings may not be as much as suggested.
Enzymatic hydrolysis requires a significant input of enzymes (0.34 kg protein per kg biodiesel) (Fig. 3). The enzyme loading (22.28 g protein per kg corn stover) is approximately two times higher than what is reported by other literature studies with similar pretreatment conditions.4 The data from our lab indicate that enzymatic loading can be further dropped by nearly half with little loss in saccharification efficiency (the result is not used for the mass and energy balance analysis in this study).43


3.1.3 Lignin processing. 
Lignin has a LHV of 24.40 MJ kg−1 dry matter.44 Utilizing residual lignin as a fuel source is critical to improving the overall energy balance of the biorefinery system. After enzymatic hydrolysis, 3.51 kg dry lignin-rich residue per kg biodiesel remains (Fig. 3 and supplemental mass and energy balance analysis), along with 6.29 kg water per kg biodiesel, which is lost to evaporation. The residue provides approximately 65.06 MJ kg−1 biodiesel of energy, more than enough to offset the energy demand associated with lignin drying (15.67 MJ kg−1 biodiesel) (Table 2). The sensitivity analysis shows that changing the drying temperature of the lignin process has a relatively small impact on the net energy output (Table 3). A 20% reduction of the drying temperature leads to a 1.35% saving on the net energy output.


3.1.4 Fungal lipid fermentation. 
Aerobic fungal fermentation proved to be by far the largest energy consumer of all unit operations at 273.33 MJ kg−1 biodiesel (Table 2), approximately 72% of all energy input. Much of the energy needs associated with this unit operation is due to the electricity consumption required to agitate (36.21 MJ kg−1 biodiesel), aerate (209.60 MJ kg−1 biodiesel) and cool (26.43 MJ kg−1 biodiesel) the fermentation broth. Large reductions in energy input are possible with modest adjustments to the mixing speed, aeration rate, and culture time as shown in the sensitivity analysis (Table 3). When the agitation speed and aeration rate are reduced from 180 rpm and 1 vvm to 144 rpm and 0.8 vvm respectively, 3% and 18% of the net energy deficit are cut. If the fermentation time is shortened from 96 hours to 76.8 hours, a 23% saving on the net energy output is achieved. Thus, decreasing the fermentation time is likely best addressed by maximizing the lipid productivity. Ruan et al. demonstrated that once the initial lag phase is overcome, the lipid productivity is similar to that when grown on a synthetic sugar substrate.37 A fed-batch culture could be a good solution to reduce the lag phase, which is currently under investigation. The aeration rate and agitation speed are both critical parameters as presented in this study. Any proposed large-scale culture should thus strive to decrease agitation and aeration rates by all possible means to reasonable levels while still maintaining sufficient lipid yields.


3.1.5 Fungal biomass drying. 
Once fungal fermentation is complete, a total of 14.03 kg wet biomass per kg biodiesel is produced for harvest after dewatering by the pressure filter (Fig. 3). Drying the fungal biomass removes 10.52 kg water per kg biodiesel, which requires an energy input of 27.86 MJ kg−1 biodiesel (Table 2). Much of this energy input is due to the latent heat of vaporization of water. Decreasing energy consumption for this unit process is likely to come from upstream optimization of the enzymatic hydrolysis or fermentation parameters in order to increase the fungal biomass yield. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrates that reducing the drying temperature to 80 °C can reduce the net energy output by 2% (Table 3).


3.1.6 Lipid extraction and transesterification. 
Many methods have been studied to extract lipids from oleaginous microbes, such as conventional organic solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, and organic solvent free extraction.45,46 Since it has been demonstrated in our lab that the lipids in M. isabellina can be extracted without mechanical disruption of its cell membrane, the extraction and downstream processing of fungal lipids follows well-established industrial practices from the soybean biodiesel industry including hexane lipid extraction and alkali catalyzed transesterification.47,48 Microbial lipid extraction converts 3.51 kg of dry fungal biomass into 1.04 kg of fungal lipid, and is the most energy intense step in this unit operation, accounting for 7.64 MJ kg−1 biodiesel (supplemental mass and energy balance analysis), mainly due to thermal energy requirements. The extraction also requires 2.65 kg of water per kg biodiesel. The final transesterification step to produce 1 kg of biodiesel requires 0.14 MJ (supplemental mass and energy balance analysis), and produces 0.120 kg of glycerol co-product48 (Fig. 3). Combustion of waste glycerol produces 1.82 MJ kg−1 biodiesel of energy (Table 4). The whole lipid extraction and transesterification process requires 7.78 MJ kg−1 biodiesel to power the operation (Table 2).


3.1.7 Wastewater treatment. 
Applying anaerobic digestion to treat fungal fermentation wastewater significantly improves the overall energy balance of the biodiesel refinery by saving 43.39 MJ kg−1 biodiesel (Table 4). The methane production of 0.91 kg per kg biodiesel is from the digestion in the fermentation and lipid extraction wastewater (Fig. 3). After the anaerobic digestion, the AD effluent of 127.18 kg per kg biodiesel is treated by the aerobic treatment process that consumes 0.15 MJ energy (ESI†). 114.47 kg of reclaimed water from the aerobic treatment is further treated by a combined RO and hydrated lime treatment. 1.38 MJ kg−1 biodiesel and 1.07 kg lime per kg biodiesel are used by the treatment to convert the reclaimed water into 91.57 kg of clean water and 9.89 kg of wet CaSO4 with 80% moisture (Fig. 3 and supplemental mass and energy balance analysis).

3.2 Sustainable aerobic biofuel refining by systematically integrating solar-bio-power generation
According to the corn stover availability in Meade County, KS (approximately 500000 metric ton corn stover), a 10 million gallon per year biodiesel production is selected as the system in this study. The total energy demand is 380.56 MJ kg−1 biodiesel (Table 5). The process co-products of lignin, glycerol, and fermentation wastewater are used to generate energy via combustion and anaerobic digestion technologies in order to compensate for the energy demand of the production process. The lignin and glycerol combustion (with 95% boiler thermal efficiency) can generate 65.06 and 1.82 MJ kg−1 biodiesel of thermal energy, respectively (Table 4). The methane from the anaerobic digestion of the fermentation effluent can be combusted (with 95% boiler thermal efficiency) and produces 43.39 MJ kg−1 biodiesel of thermal energy (Table 4). The total energy output of the stand-alone lignocellulosic biodiesel production is 147.77 MJ kg−1 biodiesel including both biodiesel and thermal energy of lignin/methane/glycerol combustion (Table 5). The net energy output is −232.79 MJ kg−1 biodiesel, and the corresponding NER is only 0.39, which means that the energy output from the utilization of these co-products is not enough to cover the energy demands of biodiesel production (Table 5, Fig. 4a). Thus, a renewable energy source, solar energy in this case, is integrated into the on-site power generation system to realize a self-sustaining lignocellulosic biodiesel production.
The solar technologies of PV and parabolic trough CSP are both examined in combination with the aforementioned biological power generation to determine the preferred configuration of an on-site solar and biological power unit. Since the electricity demand of the lignocellulosic biodiesel production is the biggest portion of the overall energy usage (Fig. 4a), 284.71 MJ electricity per kg biodiesel is used as the baseline for the analysis. According to the annual average solar radiation at Meade KS, the PV-biological power system uses 0.34 m2 kg−1 biodiesel of thin-film PV panels to generate 261.50 MJ electricity per kg biodiesel, and combusts glycerol, lignin and methane to produce 87.05 MJ thermal energy per kg biodiesel and 23.21 MJ electricity per kg biodiesel. The total energy output (including thermal energy, electricity, and biodiesel energy) is 409.28 MJ kg−1. The NER for the process with the PV-biological power generation is 1.08 (Table 5), thus making the lignocellulosic biodiesel production an energy positive process, and completely sustainable (Fig. 4b).
In the case of the CSP-biological power generation, CSP, lignin, glycerol, and methane are used to generate steam and power a steam co-generator to produce electricity and heat for the process uses (Fig. 2b). Since the thermal efficiency of the steam co-generator for electricity generation is 25% and boiler efficiency is 95%, the total thermal energy needed from solar heat, lignin, glycerol, and methane to produce 284.71 MJ electricity per kg biodiesel is 1252.72 MJ kg−1 biodiesel. Subtracting the thermal energy (110.27 MJ kg−1 biodiesel) from combustion of lignin, glycerol and methane, the thermal energy needed from solar heat is 1142.46 MJ kg−1 biodiesel (Fig. 4c) that requires a parabolic trough solar panel area of 0.26 m2 kg−1 biodiesel. Using the CSP-biological power generation, the NER of the studied lignocellulosic biodiesel production is increased to 2.82 (Table 5).
The energy balance analysis demonstrates that an energy positive lignocellulosic biodiesel production can be achieved by integrating biodiesel fermentation technology with solar and biological power generation. Considering the total energy output, the CSP-biological power generation uses a smaller solar panel area (0.26 m2 kg−1 biodiesel) to generate more energy (1074.11 MJ kg−1 biodiesel) to power the process than the PV-biological power generation with the corresponding panel area of 0.35 m2 kg−1 biodiesel and an energy output of 409.28 MJ kg−1 biodiesel (Table 5). However, the largest energy demand of the studied lignocellulosic biodiesel production is electricity (Fig. 4), the CSP-biological power generation has 25% thermal efficiency for electricity generation, which leads to a huge amount of extra heat. The lignocellulosic biodiesel production only uses 15% of this thermal energy, and the remaining thermal energy is not needed by the biodiesel production process. This means that the CSP-biological power generation does not exactly match the energy demand of the lignocellulosic biodiesel production. Meanwhile, as an on-site power plant unit, the simple configuration is an important criterion. CSP-biological power generation consists of a solar thermal collector with sun tracking, a heating fluid transfer unit, a thermal storage tank, a heat exchanger, a boiler, and a turbine, which is a fairly complicated system.49 As for the PV-biological power generation, since it directly converts sunlight into electricity, it avoids the low thermal efficiency issue of heat-to-electricity conversion. Even though the NER for the process combined with the PV-biological power unit (1.08) is lower than the one with the CSP-biological power unit (2.82) (Table 5), the PV-biological power unit has much better energy distribution between electricity and heat than the latter. Only a small amount of energy (28.70 MJ kg−1 biodiesel) is the surplus energy from the combined PV-biological power unit (Table 5). In addition, the PV-biological power unit has a relatively simple configuration that consists of a PV panel, boiler, and turbine for steam and electricity generation (Fig. 2a). Therefore, the PV-biological power system is preferred as the power unit to be integrated with the fungal biodiesel production process.
However, the key disadvantage of PV energy (or solar energy in general) is that the sun does not shine 24 hours a day. The PV power generation requires electricity storage to continuously power the biodiesel production. Conventional battery storage is very expensive and not applicable for the operation at such a large scale. On the other hand, distribution of electricity uses by the fungal biodiesel production indicates that the continuous electricity demand of the system is mainly from aeration, agitation and cooling of the fungal fermentation (73% of the total electricity usage, and the aeration is the largest energy consumer among them) (Fig. 4 and ESI†). According to the electricity demand of the fungal biodiesel production, a unique energy strategy is developed to realize a continuous operation of the PV-biological power biodiesel production. A storage tank of the compressed air is implemented between the air compressor and fermenters. During the daytime, the electricity from the PV is used by the air compressor to generate and store the required amount of air for the aeration at night and other times when solar radiation is not available. Thus, the compressed air plays the role of electricity storage, which is a more economically and technically sound approach than battery storage for such an application. As for the agitation, the agitation can be powered by both PV and biological electricity. Considering average annual sunny days of 241 in Meade, KS, 60% of agitation power (22 MJ kg−1 biodiesel) still needs to be provided by biological power. The available biological electricity (23 MJ kg−1 biodiesel) can satisfy this requirement. Regarding the cooling, the fungal fermentation gradually generates the heat, and a small temperature variation (±2 °C) has minimum influence on fungal lipid accumulation, so that daytime cooling (PV electricity is available) should be sufficient to maintain the culture temperature. Other unit operations can be operated in batch mode and adjusted according to solar availability. Therefore, with implementation of this energy strategy, the expensive battery storage can be avoided. A technically feasible self-sustaining biodiesel production system can be achieved by integrating the PV-biological power and lignocellulosic biodiesel process.
4. Conclusion
This study has delineated a new solar-bio-powered lignocellulosic biodiesel refining concept with a positive energy balance to address the issues that aerobic biofuel production systems encounter. The mass and energy balance analysis demonstrates that aerobic fungal fermentation is the largest energy consumer in the refining concept, which makes the energy balance not favorable for stand-alone lignocellulosic biodiesel production. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the lipid yield and fungal fermentation (agitation, aeration, and culture time) appear to be the critical factors that significantly influence the energy balance. Incorporating PV-bio-power generation into the system provides a sustainable approach to achieve an energy positive lignocellulosic biodiesel refining. The new concept of solar-bio-powered biodiesel refining can be further extended to other energy-intensive aerobic fermentation processes, so that aerobic biofuel and chemical production can be sustainably realized.
