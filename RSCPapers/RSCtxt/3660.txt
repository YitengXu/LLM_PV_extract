    , Accepted 21st March 2016First published on 22nd March 2016AbstractShaped Ir–Ni bimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized and used for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The obtained bimetallic nanoparticles showed significantly enhanced Ir mass activity and durability compared with Ir nanoparticles.
Power generation using renewable resources such as solar or wind power has recently been a focus of intense attention. Because these renewable power sources are inherently intermittent, the storage of produced energy using large-scale batteries or water electrolyzers has been studied as well.1,2 The electrolyzer dissociates water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity, and the hydrogen can then be used as a fuel for various fuel cell systems. The conversion of electrical energy into chemical energy can be especially effective for the storage of massive amounts of energy for a long time in a transportable form.
The electrolyzer can be operated under either acidic or basic conditions. A proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer exhibits more advantages than an alkaline electrolyzer because the PEM electrolyzer has higher hydrogen production rates, higher gas purity, and better control for safety.3–5 When protons are used as charge carriers, the overpotential is much larger at the anode (2H2O → 4H+ + 4e− + O2) than the cathode (4H+ + 4e− → 2H2); therefore, an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is very important. An anode catalyst that minimizes the overpotential for OER is essential for the development of an acidic PEM electrolyzer.6 Such a catalyst can also be potentially useful for electrochemical CO2 hydrogenation.7,8
Theoretical density functional theory (DFT) studies have shown that several metal oxides, such as CoOx, RuOx, and IrOx, are located near the top of the volcano plot showing the relation between activity and adsorption energy of reactant intermediates.9,10 Ir is the most widely used element for OER due to its high activity and durability. Although OsOx and RuOx exhibit higher OER activities than IrOx, they are typically leached out easily during OER, prohibiting their utilization for OER catalysts.3,11 However, the high price and scarcity of Ir hinders the large scale development of PEM electrolyzers. While many ‘3d transition metal’-based catalysts have been studied for OER under the alkaline or neutral conditions,12–18 attempts to minimize Ir utilization under the acid conditions are also highly important for practical applications. Recently, Reier et al. reported that Ir nanoparticles could be effective OER catalysts even under acidic conditions without significant leaching.19 Modulation of the nanoparticle shape or composition may further enhance the Ir mass activity for OER.
The size of colloidal Ir nanoparticles synthesized using a conventional wet chemistry typically ranges between 1 and 3 nm. Shaped Ir nanoparticles with well-defined facets have not been reported. Xia et al. estimated that the energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation is smaller than the barrier for heterogeneous nucleation for Ir; therefore, more Ir nuclei would be formed instead of the nuclei being overgrown into larger Ir nanoparticles.20 However, there could be Ir overgrowth on other transition metal nanoparticles, such as Pd, Cu, and Ni, with a size of 10–20 nm forming the Ir shell and the other metal core structure. The Ir overgrowth on other transition metals is preferred to homogeneous nucleation producing Ir nuclei. Various shapes and compositions of Pd@Ir cubes, Pd@Ir octahedra, and Cu@Ir octahedra have been reported.20,21
Recently, Strasser et al. showed that an Ir–Ni mixed oxide structure can exhibit enhanced OER activity compared with Ir-only surfaces.22–24 Reactive surface hydroxyl groups formed on Ir atoms adjacent to surface Ni atoms can accelerate OER with better activity.22 In this work, we synthesized shaped Ir–Ni bimetallic nanoparticles using a facile one-step recipe and showed that the obtained Ir–Ni bimetallic structure exhibited unprecedentedly high OER activity. This work introduces a new approach for minimizing Ir utilization in acidic PEM electrolyzers.
Ir and Ni precursors (IrCl3 and Ni(NO3)2) with different molar ratios were dissolved in a small amount of water; the aqueous solution was added to oleylamine at 160 °C under Ar flow, and then the temperature was increased to 280 °C and maintained at that temperature for 5 min. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the effect of the Ir to Ni molar ratio added during the synthesis on the final shape of Ir–Ni bimetallic nanoparticles. When the Ir precursor was not added, large Ni nanoparticles with a size of approximately 60 nm were synthesized. When a small amount of Ir was added (Ir/Ni = 0.17), the resulting nanoparticles became smaller and facets started to appear, as shown in Fig. S1(b) (ESI†). When the Ir/Ni ratio increased to 0.38, well-defined rhombic dodecahedral Ir–Ni nanoparticles were observed. Fig. 1(a–c) shows the low and high magnification TEM images and the HAADF-STEM image demonstrates elemental distribution within a single nanoparticle. Ir appears to be located at the shell, while Ni is located at the core. These Ir thin layer nanoparticles (denoted as Ir–Ni TL) exhibit a uniform size of 18.3 ± 1.7 nm (the size histogram is shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). When the Ir/Ni ratio was further increased to 1.0, the shape changed to that of a star candy (denoted as Ir–Ni SC), as shown in Fig. 1(d–f). Ir was selectively deposited on the vertices while the overall size was similar to that of the Ir–Ni TL nanoparticles, with an average size of 20.6 ± 1.5 nm. When the Ir/Ni ratio increased even further to 3.0, the Ir vertex region became larger, with the shape of Ir lumps connected to a Ni core (denoted as Ir–Ni LP). Their average size was 20.5 ± 2.2 nm. The bimetallic nature of the three shapes of Ir–Ni nanoparticles was confirmed using XRD as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). When the Ir/Ni ratio increased from 0.38 to 1.0 to 3.0, the overall size was similar, but Ir was deposited more on the vertices with smaller Ni cores. When the Ni precursor was not added, Ir was not reduced immediately at 280 °C. When the reactant solution remained at 280 °C for 30 min, then the Ir precursors were reduced, forming Ir dendrites, as shown in Fig. S1(f) (ESI†). The size of the Ir dendrites was much smaller with an average size of 9.3 ± 1.4 nm. Clearly, the reduction of Ir precursors is promoted in the presence of Ni. When the amount of Ir precursor was very small, most Ir would be reduced on the Ni surface. However, as the amount of Ir precursor increased, Ir tended to assemble forming Ir-abundant vertices. XPS data in Fig. S4 (ESI†) show that both Ir 4f and Ni 3p peaks were observed for Ir–Ni TL, but Ir–Ni SC and Ir–Ni LP did not have the Ni 3p peak indicating that less Ni presided at the surface. Interestingly, the presence of water during the synthesis was essential for the formation of uniform Ir–Ni bimetallic nanoparticles. When the water was excluded from the synthesis, the bimetallic structure was not formed, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The dissolution of metal precursors in water seems to change the chlorine or nitrate ligands to hydroxide ligands, modulating the reduction potential of both metal precursors into similar values.25–27

The bimetallic Ir–Ni nanoparticles were deposited on a carbon black support, and their electrocatalytic properties were evaluated for OER. Ir nanoparticles with a size of 1–2 nm or Ir black were also supported on carbon black and used for control experiments. Their TEM images are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The same Ir amount of 2 μg cm−2 was deposited on the rotating disk electrode for all cases. The carbon-supported Ir-based nanoparticles were activated by repeating cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a range of 0.05 to 1.5 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 500 mV s−1 for 50 cycles. Significant amounts of Ni were leached out during the activation process, forming hollow structures shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Nevertheless, Ni still exists on the nanoparticles, forming Ir–Ni alloy shells. Ir/Ni atomic ratios estimated by EDX after the activation process were 0.39, 1.56, and 2.03 for Ir–Ni TL, Ir–Ni SC, and Ir–Ni LP, respectively.
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results were obtained from 1.35 V to 1.6 V with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and a rotating rate of 1600 rpm. Fig. 2 shows the LSV results for various Ir-based catalysts. The Ir–Ni bimetallic nanoparticles demonstrated much higher activity than the Ir nanoparticle (Ir NP) catalyst with a very small size. The estimated mass activity at 1.51 V was 498 A gIr−1 for Ir–Ni TL, 256 A gIr−1 for Ir–Ni SC, 217 A gIr−1 for Ir–Ni LP, 130 A gIr−1 for Ir NP, and 64 A gIr−1 for Ir black, respectively. Ir–Ni TL showed 3.8 times higher mass activity than Ir NPs. Because Ir–Ni TL contains many carbon materials due to the low Ir weight fraction, the currents derived from carbon oxidation were also estimated. Fig. 2 also shows that when the same amount of carbon as in the Ir–Ni TL was deposited on the electrode without any metal, the current was negligibly small. Thus, Ir–Ni bimetallic nanoparticles, especially Ir–Ni TL, showed a superior mass activity to Ir only catalysts. The shape effect was confirmed further by comparing the activity to unshaped Ir–Ni nanoparticles. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows a TEM image of the spherical Ir–Ni nanoparticles and their electrocatalytic properties for OER. The unshaped nanoparticles would have metal atoms located at a poorly-defined surface with more step/edge sites, and those surface atoms would be leached out more easily with less OER activity. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurement results shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) indicate that the Ir in Ir–Ni bimetallic structure has a more reduced state than the Ir in Ir nanoparticles. In XPS data of Fig. S4 (ESI†), Ir on Ir–Ni bimetallic structures shows a smaller binding energy than the Ir nanoparticles, also supporting its more reduced state.
 Fig. 2  Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results of various Ir-based catalysts supported on carbon black. ‘C only’ shows the LSV results for the same amount carbon as Ir–Ni TL/C (280 μg C per cm2) without any metal nanoparticles. Measurement conditions: 2 μgIr cm−2, Ar-saturated 0.05 M H2SO4, 1600 rpm, scan rate 5 mV s−1. 
The durability of the various Ir-based catalysts was tested by performing chronopotentiometry at 1 mA cm−2 with a rotating rate of 1600 rpm. As shown in Fig. 3, whereas Ir black functioned for at most 2 hours, Ir–Ni TL functioned for more than 12 hours. The amount of leached Ir or Ni after 1 h of chronopotentiometry was estimated from the electrolyte solution using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS); the results are shown in Table 1. The degree of Ir leaching for the Ir–Ni bimetallic structures was greater than that for the Ir black sample but smaller than that for the Ir nanoparticle sample. The contribution of Ni leaching to the OER charge was estimated for the Ir–Ni TL/C sample. While the OER produced 7.3 μmol of electrons for 1 h of reaction, Ni leaching from Ni to Ni2+ would produce only 0.04 μmol of electrons when calculated based on 12.4 ppb Ni at the electrolyte solution. Ir leaching from Ir to Ir4+ would produce only 0.0008 μmol of electrons when calculated based on 0.4 ppb Ir in the electrolyte solution. Although a significant extent of Ni leaching was observed, the contribution of Ni leaching on the measured charge was negligible. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows the TEM images after 1 h of chronopotentiometry at 1 mA cm−2. The shape of hollow Ir–Ni TL was degraded during the reaction although the OER was maintained over 10 hours. The shapes of Ir–Ni SC and Ir–Ni LP were maintained. It was previously suggested that hydroxide groups connected to surface Ir atoms would be formed during Ni leaching for the Ir–Ni phase and that these hydroxide groups are responsible for a highly efficient OER.22 When the Ir content was very low, more hydroxide groups are formed, giving rise to the higher Ir mass activity for the OER. The actual O2 production was also checked by measuring O2 directly using gas chromatography. Faraday efficiency was estimated as 99% for Ir/C and 95% for Ir–Ni TL/C after 1 h of OER as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†).

In conclusion, shaped Ir–Ni bimetallic nanoparticles have been synthesized in one pot. When the Ir content was very small, a thin primarily Ir shell was formed on the Ni core with a rhombic dodecahedral shape. As the Ir content increased, Ir was deposited more on the vertices. These Ir–Ni bimetallic nanoparticles exhibited high activity and durability for electrocatalytic OER. This work shows that nanostructure control of Ir-based alloy materials can contribute to minimizing Ir utilization for water electrolysis.
