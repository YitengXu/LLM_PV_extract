    , Accepted 26th April 2021First published on 26th April 2021AbstractWe report the optical and thermoelectric properties of the two-dimensional Dirac material T-silicene (TS) sheet and nanoribbons (NRs) by first-principles calculations. Both the optical and thermoelectric properties of TS can be modified by tailoring the sheet into nanoribbons of different widths and edge geometries. The optical response of the structures is highly anisotropic. A π interband transition occurs in the visible range of incident light with parallel polarization. The optical response for asymmetric arm-chair TS nanoribbons (ATSNRs) is larger than for symmetric ATSNRs. The absorptions of asymmetric ATSNR are redshifted due to a decrease in the bandgap with the width of the NRs. Plasma frequencies of the sheet and the NRs are identified from the imaginary part of the dielectric function and electron energy loss spectra curves. Thermoelectric properties like electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, and electronic figure of merit are also studied. Compared with graphene, the TS sheet possesses a higher electrical conductivity and a better figure of merit. Among the NRs, asymmetric ATSNRs exhibit a better thermoelectric performance. All these intriguing features of TS may shed light on fabricating smart opto-electronic and thermoelectric devices.
1 Introduction
Recent years have seen incredible interest directed towards the experimental and theoretical study of two-dimensional (2D) materials with Dirac cones. Beginning with the eminent accomplishment of graphene,1–5 the emphasis has additionally been on non-carbon-based 2D Dirac materials like silicene, germanene, stanene and so on.6–8 Also, stable non-hexagonal allotropes of these materials possessing Dirac cone(s), like S-graphene (SG),9,10 buckled tetragonal-silicene (TS)11 and tetragonal-germanene (TGe),12etc., have been proposed. In contrast to TS and TGe, the stable tetragonal graphene (TG) structure is planar with metallic behavior.13 Apart from graphene or silicene, 2D heteroatomic structures consisting of both carbon and silicon atoms – silicon carbide (SiC)14–16 structures – have also been predicted and the existence of such 2D structures in the form of grains in graphene oxide pores have been confirmed experimentally. Among the predicted SiC structures, the hexagonal form possesses a direct bandgap,16 while the tetragonal SiC17 has a single Dirac cone in its band structure.
The high optical transmission and absorption in the visible range have opened up the possibility of applications for graphene in photonics and opto-electronics,18 although the zero bandgap feature of graphene reduces its prospect in practical applications. Nonetheless, the optical response of graphene nanoribbons (NRs) can be controlled by its edge and width modulation, leading to its suitability for opto-electronic devices.19–21 Beyond the hexagonal form, square symmetric TG has been shown22,23 to have optical absorption in the low- and high-energy regions for parallel and perpendicular polarization, respectively. Moreover, TG has been predicted to have potential prospects in gas sensing,23,24 and non-linear optical devices25etc. Recently, Nath et al. have also reported the highly anisotropic optical response of another non-hexagonal graphene allotrope, the SG sheet and NRs.26 The low-buckled silicene and germanene exhibit a bandgap opening higher than graphene due to spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Also, a band gap opening at Dirac point can be tailored by external functionalization.27,28 It has also been established that only the low-buckling form of silicene is stable, while high-buckling and planar silicene structures are unstable.29,30 The optical response of the silicene has been found to possess two intense peaks in the visible and ultra-violet (UV) regions arising due to the top π–π* band and σ band transitions respectively.31,32 At the same time, silicene has a wonderful optical response in the visible to infra-red (IR) region33 making it a potential candidate in the present optical and opto-electronics industries. For heteroatomic structures like SiC, this has an optical response mainly in the visible range, though is greatly affected by the positions of the C and Si atoms.16,17
Another technological aspect of a material is its thermoelectric properties, which deal with the ability to directly convert heat into electricity or vice versa. Along with other phenomenological properties, graphene has an extremely high thermal conductivity,34 though this reduces its efficiency as a decent thermoelectric material. Also, it has been shown that thermoelectric merit is not improved for doped graphene NRs.35 On the other hand, silicene and germanene have a better thermoelectric performance than graphene,36 and it is considered that a small bandgap in the system improves the thermoelectric merit. Besides, it is natural to focus on the thermoelectric properties of silicon- and germanium-based materials being compatible with current technology.
Though the prediction and synthesis of the non-hexagonal form of graphene have been plentiful, allotropes of silicene with non-hexagonal symmetry are quite scarce. Among the few, T-silicene (TS)11 possesses square symmetry with two Dirac cones in its band structure and has zero negative phonon frequency. Tu et al.37 have shown that the bandgap of the TS sheet can be modulated upon hydrogenation (passivated by hydrogen atoms), which may find its application in spintronic devices. Similar band tuning has also been predicted for silicene nanosheets passivated by hydrogen.38 Very recently39 studying the electronic properties of TS nanoribbons (TSNRs), the authors predicted the existence of multiple Dirac cones, finite band gaps in their band structures depending on the width and the edge states of the nanoribbons (NRs).
Inspired by the above results, we have extended our previous work39 in determining the optical and thermoelectric properties of the TS sheet and TSNRs using first-principles calculations. We have organized the paper as follows. In the next section (Section 2), we discuss briefly the structures. Also, the methodology used for our calculation is presented. Then in the ‘Optical properties’ section (Section 3), we study the optical properties like the real and imaginary parts of dielectric the functions, electron energy loss spectra (EELS), absorption coefficients, etc. as a function of frequency for different optical polarizations. In the subsequent Section 4, we investigate transport properties such as the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of TS sheet and TSNRs as a function of the chemical potential and temperature. We have also estimated the figure of merit, which characterizes the thermoelectric value.
2 Model and methodology
The structure of the TS sheet, shown in Fig. 1(a), consists of 8-atoms per unit cell and exhibits square symmetry with a lattice constant a = 7.6074 Å. The two different bond lengths are 2.252 Å (l1) and 2.302 Å (l2), which are also schematically depicted in the figure. The structure has a buckling of ΔZ ≈ 0.49 Å. This silicon-based structure has a cohesive energy 4.58 eV per atom, which is slightly lower than silicene (4.77 eV per atom).11 Moreover, the structure does not have any imaginary frequency in the phonon dispersion and is mechanically stable up to 1000 K. Also, the mechanical properties of this structure are comparable to silicene.39 NRs with armchair edges (ATSNRs) and zigzag edges (ZTSNRs) of different widths are cut along X- and XY-axis (45° with the X-axes) respectively from the relaxed sheet as shown in Fig. 1(b–d). The ATSNRs can be divided into two groups, based on the symmetric (S-ATSNR) and asymmetric (A-ATSNR) opposite edges.

Structure of (b) S-ATSNR, (c) A-ATSNR and (d) ZTSNR. Unit cells for each NR are shown in black boxes, where N denotes the primitive unit cell of the TS. 
The optical properties are explored using the SIESTA DFT package40–42 using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.43 A Troullier–Martins44 norm-conserving pseudopotential in a fully separable form of Kleinman and Bylander is used for the calculations. The double ζ plus polarised (DZP) basis set is used for the whole range of the systems. The TS sheet is optimised using a 32 × 32 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack (MP)45 with the forces on individual atoms below 0.001 eV Å−1. NRs of different width and edge geometries (S-ATSNRs, A-ATSNRs, and ZTSNRs) are tailored from the optimized sheet, and the dangling bonds at the edges are passivated with hydrogen for stability purposes. The sheet is further optimized using a 32 × 1 × 1 MP with a force per atom below 0.01 eV Å−1. For calculating the optical properties, the Brillouin zone (BZ) is sampled with a dense k space sampling with an equivalent of 151 × 151 × 1 and 151 × 1 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack (MP) for the sheet and nanoribbons respectively. A vacuum region of 15 Å is kept between two TS layers to avoid interaction between the neighboring layers. The mesh cutoff is set at 360 Ry.
It has already been established that the DZP basis set provides well-converged results in calculating the lattice parameter, Bulk modulus, and cohesive energy of bulk silicon.42 However, to validate its applicability on the optical properties, we have computed the optical properties of bulk-silicon and silicene by DFT and compared them with a previous experimental and theoretical study (ESI†). In addition to the DZP basis set with PBE, we have considered a single ζ-polarised (SZP) and triple ζ-polarised (TZP) basis set. In the local density approximation (LDA) of the exchange–correlation, we have chosen the Perdew–Zunger46 functional with the DZP basis set. Our DFT calculation of optical properties with the PBE/DZP level of theory gives good agreement with the experimental result of bulk-silicon (ESI Part-I†) and the theoretical result of silicene (ESI Part-II†). Since the PBE/DZP level of theory provides sensible results with an optimal computational cost for bulk silicon and silicene, it may be applied to any silicon-based structure to explore its optical properties including TS. Also, it is well known that DFT with various exchange functionals underestimates bandgap of bulk Si.47,48 In this paper, we have used the band structure to illustrate the role of some important transitions between the valence band and conduction bands responsible for the peaks in the imaginary part of the dielectric function, and we believe that the GGA with the PBE functional and DZP basis provides reasonable good quality results with optimal computational cost.
The optical properties for all three directions have been calculated from the frequency (ω) dependent dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω), where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric functions respectively. In the long-wavelength limit (q → 0), using first-order time-dependent perturbation theory in the dipole approximation, the imaginary part of the dielectric function can be written as49 (1)where ΨCBK and ΨVBK are the corresponding wave functions of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) respectively at the K point, and Ω, ε0, , and  represent the volume of the supercell, the free space permittivity, the polarization vector of the electric field, and the position vector respectively. The ε1(ω) depends on ε2(ω) via the Kramers–Kronig (KK) relation.26
Different optical properties like the absorption coefficient (α(ω)), electron energy loss spectra (EELS, (L(ω))) etc. have been calculated from the complex dielectric function for the X-, Y- and Z-directions. A large number of empty bands (Nbands = 500) have been considered with an optical broadening of 0.2 eV for more accurate results, due to the incorporation of high-frequency effects in interband transitions. The excitonic effect has not been considered in this work. We are keen on investigating the optical properties of the systems utilizing DFT as a computationally inexpensive method.
We have also calculated the effective number of the valence electrons (Neff) in each unit cell50 that contribute to the direct interband transitions using ε2(ω) as a parameter given by the following sum rule (2)Here m, e, h, N0, ω and ωm are the mass, the charge of the electrons, Planck's constant, the electron density, the energy, and the upper limit of the energy in eV.
The effective dielectric function εeff, which is determined by an interband and low-lying transition among the core and semi-core bands in the same range, can be expressed as (3)
The effective dielectric function determines the most important contribution of the transitions to the static dielectric function in the energy range 0 (zero) to ωm.
The EELS function has been calculated from the complex dielectric function as (4)The peak position of the EELS can be used to estimate the total energy of the plasmons. A peak in EELS is obtained when ε1(ω) → 0 and ε2(ω) < 1.
The optical absorption coefficient (α(ω)) is related to the imaginary part of the refractive index (extinction coefficient, k(ω)) by the equation (5)where the complex refractive index has been calculated from the dielctric function using . The parameters n(ω) and k(ω) are related to ε1 and ε2 as (6) (7)
The thermoelectric properties of the TS sheet are calculated using the QUANTUM ESPRESSO (QE)51,52 package with plane-wave basis48,49 and the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with the relaxation time approach as implemented in the BoltzTraP code.53 The BoltzTraP code uses the constant relaxation time approximation and rigid band approximation for the solution of the BTE. For the input of the BTE solver, we perform spin unpolarised simulation with a Projected Augmented Wave technique (PAW), with the GGA in the shape of the PBE to approximate the exchange–correlation energy as executed in the QE package. The kinetic energy cutoff for charge density and wave function are taken as 600 Ry and 50 Ry respectively, and the BZ integration is performed by using a dense 24 × 24 × 1 and 24 × 1 × 1 k point mesh45 for the sheet and nanoribbons respectively. In all calculations, we used the Gaussian smearing technique with a width of 0.005 Ry. A vacuum region of more than 15 Å is kept between the TS layers to avoid interaction between neighboring layers. The geometries of the sheet and hydrogen passivated nanoribbons are optimized until the forces in each atom are less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The convergence for kinetic energy cutoff, k-grid points, is checked by calculating the total energy and formation energy of the TS sheet and is compared with earlier results. We have also calculated the formation energy and bandgap of bulk silicon using this same technique and found the results to be consistent with the experimental value.
The electrical conductivity (σαβ), Seebeck coefficient (Sαβ) and electronic thermal conductivity (κeαβ) tensors are the important transport properties calculated by the code. These quantities are approximated in terms of temperature (T) and chemical potential (μ) as:53 (8) (9) (10)with (11)where α and β represent the tensor indices. The symbols ε(k), v(k), τ(k), f, e and Ω represent the band energy, band velocity, relaxation time, Fermi function, electronic charge and volume of the cell respectively.
The thermoelectric performance of a material is defined in terms of its figure of merit (ZT), a dimensionless quantity, expressed as follows: (12)where ZTel = σS2T/κel is the electronic figure of merit, and describes the upper bound of the total figure of merit. κel and κph are electronic and phononic contributions of thermal conductivity.
Within the constant relaxation time approximation, the Seebeck coefficient and figure of merit can be calculated independently of the relaxation time (τ) but the evaluation of the electrical conductivity as well as the electronic thermal conductivity requires knowledge of τ. As a result, τ has been set as a fixed parameter to look for the variation of all the transport properties with temperature.
3 Optical properties
It is well established that the optical properties of the system strongly depend on the electronic properties. The electronic properties of the TS sheet and the NRs were explored in ref. 39. The band structure of the TS sheet possesses two Dirac cones in the irreducible Brillouin zone. S-ATSNRs exhibit multiple Dirac cones in their band structure depending on the width of the NRs, while A-ATSNRs are semiconductors. The ZTSNRs are also degenerate semiconductors with the existence of Dirac-like cones.
We have calculated the optical properties of the systems from the frequency-dependent complex part of the dielectric function ε2(ω) under the condition of polarized light. We have considered the electric field parallel and perpendicular to the samples on the X–Y plane. We denote Ex (Ey) for parallel polarization along X- (Y-) direction, while Ez represents perpendicular polarization. For the sheet, both Ex and Ey are equivalent due to the symmetry of the structure, and hence conveniently we show the results for Ex only. In general, the optical response of the TS system is seen to be in the infrared (IR) to UV region (0–6 eV) and the UV region (6–15 eV) for light incidence with parallel and perpendicular polarizations respectively. Since the response for perpendicular polarization is in the UV region, we mainly study the optical properties for parallel polarization for the NRs unless otherwise stated. The anisotropy in the dielectric function arises due to the two-dimensional nature of the TS sheet.
3.1 Imaginary part of dielectric functions

3.1.1 TS sheet. 
Before discussing the optical properties of TS structures, we first check the convergence behavior of the PBE/DZP level of theory by calculating the imaginary part of the dielectric function ε2(ω) for parallel and perpendicular polarization (Fig. 2a and b respectively) using the PBE/DZP, PBE/SZP, PBE/TZP and PZ/DZP levels of theory. A good convergence of ε2(ω) is achieved for PBE/DZP with the PBE/TZP level of theory for both polarizations. Since all other optical properties are calculated from this imaginary part of the dielectric function, we can consider only the DZP basis with the PBE functional of the GGA exchange–correlation for our study.
 Fig. 2  Imaginary part of dielectric function ε2(ω) for incidence of light with (a) parallel polarization and (b) perpendicular polarization with different levels of theory. 
The imaginary part of the dielectric function ε2(ω), which measures the amount of energy dissipated in the system with frequency, shows two intense peaks with maxima at ω = 1.32 eV and 4.32 eV appears for parallel polarization (Ex) irrespective of the choice of the basis set and functional. The low energy peak (A) at 1.32 eV arises due to the interband transition from the VB to CB, arising due to π–π* sp-hybridized electrons. The high energy peak (B) arises due to the σ–σ* transition in the band structure. The peaks of the εx2(ω) can be well explained in terms of the DOS and band structure of the TS. It is clear from the DOS that the pz orbital only contributes to the band structure near the Fermi level (EF).39 The interband transitions for the peaks at ω = 1.32 eV and 4.32 eV are shown in Fig. 3 with the band structure of the TS sheet. Four possible transitions at different K points between the highest VB and lowest CB contribute to peak ‘A’. The few possible transitions for the peak ‘B’ arise from the bands deep in the VB and CB.
 Fig. 3  Transitions for the peak ‘A’ at ω = 1.32 eV (red arrows) and a few of the possible transitions for peak ‘B’ at ω = 4.32 eV (blue arrows) are shown using the band structure of TS. The transitions are shown for the PBE/DZP level of theory. 
For perpendicular polarization (Ez), the εz2(ω) shows a response in the region of 7–10 eV. A single intense peak (C) is observed at 8.88 eV, associated with some small peaks in the low energy region. The peak(s) arise due to σ–σ* band transitions. The few of the possible transitions leading to peak ‘C’ at 8.88 eV are shown with the band structure in the ESI,† Fig. S5. All these peaks arise as the number of transitions is large at these energy values compared with its vicinity.
The variation of Neff (expressed in the unit of ) and εeff(ω) with energy for Ex and Ez are shown in Fig. 4(a and b) respectively. For Ex, the εeff(ω) is nearly equal to unity up to ω ≈ 0.6 eV and then increases rapidly and reaches saturation at ω ≈ 7.0 eV. The rapid increase occurs between 0.6 and 5 eV, which suggests that the maximum contribution from the interband transition occurs between 0.6 and 5 eV. However, for Ez the saturation region is obtained at ω ≈ 11 eV, with a sharp rise for ω between 5 and 10 eV. This is the direct consequence of the interband transition within the σ–σ* band transition, which generally lies in the UV range. The plot of Neff with energy indicates a saturation region at ω ≈ 20 eV for Ex. Thus it can be concluded that deep-lying valence electrons lying far from EF do not contribute significantly in the optical transition with parallel polarization. For Ez, the saturation region occurs even at lower energy ω ≈ 15 eV. Interestingly, for perpendicular polarization Neff is very small in the region ω = 1–6 eV, which suggests that the electrons are not at all excited at small energy values for perpendicular polarization.

3.1.2 Nanoribbons. 
Polarization along the X-axis. 
We now present the variation of ε2(ω) for all TSNRs with different widths (N = 1–4) for parallel polarization along the X-direction, in Fig. 5(a). For all S-ATSNRs, a peak is observed around ω ≈ 1, except for N = 1. The maximum in εx2(ω) is observed for N = 2 at at ω ≈ 0.94 eV, which is blue-shifted with the increase in width. For N = 3 and 4, the peak in εx2(ω) occurs at ω ≈ 1.06 and 1.12 eV respectively. Also, the maximum value decreases with the increase in the width. The peak occurs due to the transition in the π–π* band in the band structure. Additionally, a moderate optical response is observed at 3.8–5 eV for all N values under study, which can be attributed to the π–σ* transition. Contrary to the above findings, the width N = 1 has the maximum around ω ≈ 4.80 eV with no optical response in the IR to the visible region.
Compared with S-ATSNR, the intensities of the peaks are very large for A-ATSNR and increase with the width. Additionally, the peak positions are red-shifted with the increase in the width. This result is a direct consequence of the decrease in the bandgap of A-ATSNR with width. Moreover, for A-ATSNR the optical response is observed in the IR region of the EM spectrum.
The width-dependent variation of εx2(ω) for ZTSNRs is quite irregular. A small optical response for the narrowest ZTSNR is observed in the UV region only with a peak at 4.26 eV. However, for N ≥ 2, a strong response in both the IR to visible region is observed along with a weak response in the UV region. For the even N, the peak in the IR region is red-shifted while for odd N the peak is blue shifted. In the UV region, the peaks for all ZTSNRs are observed around ω ≈ 4.5 eV.
Polarization along the Y-axis. 
The dependency of ε2(ω) on ω for polarization of light along Ey, for all types of TSNRs, is shown in Fig. 5(b). Both S-ATSNR and A-ATSNR show similar behavior in εy2(ω) with ω. However, the peak intensity of εy2(ω) for S-ATSNR is large compared to εx2(ω). The intensity of the optical response is proportional and is red-shifted towards smaller frequencies with the increase of width. For example, the peak positions are observed at ω = 0.94, 0.78, and 0.68 eV for S-ATSNR while for A-ATSNR they are at ω = 1.02, 0.86 and 0.70 eV for N = 2, 3, 4 respectively. The narrowest NRs show a negligible optical response, which can be attributed to the confinement effect.

The ZTSNRs show a weaker response compared with the S-ATSNRs and A-ATSNRs. However similar to the other two NRs, the peak height increases with width and is red-shifted. Contrary to the other two NRs, N = 2 and 3 shows a response in the IR to visible region of the EM spectrum. The peak positions for N = 2–5 are at ω = 1.7, 1.18, 1.04 and 0.88 eV respectively.
Polarization along the Z-axis. 
For perpendicular polarization, the optical response of all TSNRs is observed in the UV region i.e. at 7–11 eV and is depicted in Fig. 5(c). The most intense peak for all NRs and widths is observed around ω ≈ 8.9 eV. These peaks are related to the σ–σ* band transitions. A few small peaks are also observed other than the maximum intensity peaks.

3.2 Real part of dielectric functions and EELS
The real part of the dielectric function ε1(ω) measures the amount of energy stored in the system. In the metallic system, it plays an important role in determining the collective role of free electrons. A rapid fluctuation is observed in ε1(ω) at each peak in ε2(ω). The real part of the dielectric function along with electron energy loss factor (EELS) for the sheet and different NRs are discussed in the following subsection.

3.2.1 TS sheet. 
The real part of the dielectric function for the TS sheet is shown in Fig. 6(a). Our study reveals that the static part of the dielectric function is εx1(0) = 3.9 and εz1(0) = 1.60 for polarization along the X- and Z-directions respectively. These values are comparable to free-standing silicene where εx1(0) = 5.43 and εz1(0) = 1.47.33 The availability of a large number of free carriers in the TS sheet, which behaves like a semimetal, results in a non-zero value of ε1(0). The behavior of a material as a metal or a dielectric can be well understood by calculating the plasma frequency. It is the characteristic frequency, corresponding to the collective excitations of electrons, at which the real part of the dielectric function vanishes with ε1(ω) evolving from negative to positive i.e. at ε1(ω) = 0. Few plasma frequencies (ωp) are observed for both incidences along the X- and Z-axes. The plasma frequencies for incidence along parallel polarization are ωxp = 5.65, 6.07, and 7.49 eV, while for perpendicular polarization ωzp = 10.15 eV. The values of the plasma frequencies are tabulated in Table 1. Thus all the plasma frequencies for both polarizations appear in the UV region. The existence of plasma frequency from the real part of the dielectric function can well be verified from the EELS curve (shown in Fig. 6(b)), which shows a sharp peak at the plasma frequency. The sharpest plasmon peak in EELS for parallel polarization occurs at 7.64 eV and with a few small humps at 5.58 and 6.16 eV, in good agreement with the plasma frequencies. These peaks originate due to the loss of energy by fast-moving electrons in non-magnetic materials. Two prominent peaks of εx1(ω) at 0.94 and 3.16 eV (visible region) occur for polarization along the X-direction. Three small peaks are observed for εz1(ω) in the range of 6–9 eV.

3.2.2 Nanoribbons. 
Polarization along the X-axis. 
The real part of the dielectric function of the nanoribbons for Ex is shown in Fig. 7(a). It is clear from the figure that the static part of the dielectric function εx1(0) for the A-ATSNR is larger than S-ATSNR and Z-ATSNR. The typical values of εx1(0) for the NRs of different widths are given in Table 2. One of the reasons for the large value of the static dielectric function for A-ATSNR may be due to the asymmetry in the structure. The plasma frequency for all the TSNRs for polarization along the X-direction is tabulated in Table 1. The low energy plasma frequency for A-ATSNR is blue-shifted with an increase in width. EELS peaks for all TSNRs match well with the plasma frequency. While the EELS peak for S-ATSNR is red-shifted, it is blue-shifted for A-ATSNR. Moreover, the EELS peak for A-ATSNR for N = 1 is very intense compared with other peaks. For ZTSNR, an intense peak is observed only for N = 3.

Polarization along the Y-axis. 
The variation of ε1(ω) for Ey with frequency for all TSNRs is depicted in Fig. 8(a). It is clear from the figure that the static part of the dielectric function ε1(0) is larger for Ey than Ex, except for A-ATSNR. However, for all types of TSNRs, εy1(0) increases with the increase of the width. The typical values of εy1(0) are tabulated in Table 3. The obtained plasma frequencies are also listed in Table 1. The data indicate that all the NRs exhibit plasma frequency in the visible range, which is further confirmed by the EELS peaks in Fig. 8(b). Both ε1(ω) and EELS curves show that a few plasma frequencies also lie in the deep UV region.

3.3 Absorption co-efficient
The absorption co-efficient α(ω) for polarization Ex and Ez for the TS sheet is shown in Fig. 9(a). The maximum value of α(ω) for Ex is 12.15 and 12.05 at energy 4.60 and 5.16 eV, which is in the UV region. The maximum of α(ω) for Ez is 22.83 at energy 9.02 eV, which lies deep in the UV region. The energy for maximum absorption is blue-shifted compared with pristine silicene (ω = 4.07 eV for αmaxx) for parallel polarization while it nearly matches that for perpendicular polarization (ω = 9.11 eV).54 For the TSNRs (Fig. 9(b and c)), polarization of incident light along the X- and Y-axes shows strong absorption in the IR region (ω ≈ 1–1.5 eV) and the UV region. However, the absorption in the UV region is stronger compared with the IR region. Generally, the absorption intensity increases with the width of the TSNRs and is redshifted. It is well established that the interband transition is mainly responsible for the absorption spectra peaks. With the increase in width, the bands are closely spaced, and hence the absorption can happen at low energies and hence is red-shifted. Irrespective of the width and the direction of the polarization of light, a very low value of the absorption coefficient is observed beyond the incident energy range ω = 10 eV. The large absorption co-efficient of ATSNRs in the IR and UV range may lead to its application in solar cells.

We finally compare the optical properties of the TS sheets in terms of the static dielectric constant, plasma frequency, and energy of absorption maximum (ωα) with silicene and graphene and this is tabulated in Table 4. The values are quite comparable to silicene and graphene and in some cases they are better.

4 Thermoelectric properties
In a material, both charge and heat are transported by electrons. The electric field produced by the temperature gradient in any material opposes the natural diffusion of electrons. Thermoelectric energy conversion is the ability of a material to convert a steady temperature gradient into an electric current or vice versa. The thermoelectric properties of a material depend on its electronic structure. A small bandgap and higher carrier mobility are the prime requisite of good thermoelectric materials. Besides, functionalization and chemical potential also play a pivotal role in determining the thermoelectric properties. TS has two Dirac cones in the band structure (shiowing semi-metal behavior) and is expected to be a good thermoelectric material. The performance of TS as a thermoelectric material has been considered by studying various parameters like the electrical and thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, and the figure of merit as a function of temperature and chemical potential. These results are depicted in Fig. 10. Also, we have plotted these thermoelectric parameters with temperature for arbitrary values of μ − εf for a better understanding of the temperature dependency of the thermoelectric performance. The relaxation time constant is assumed to be isotropic and constant in all directions. The pristine condition is represented by μ = 0 and μ > 0 (μ < 0) indicates the electron (hole) doping.
 Fig. 10  Variation of the (a) electrical conductivity, (b) Seebeck coefficient, (c) power factor, and (d) electronic figure of merit with respect to the chemical potential. 
4.1 TS sheet
The electrical conductivity σ/τ, which measures the ability of materials to conduct electricity, shows a nearly symmetric behavior around the chemical potential μ → εf at all temperatures and tends to saturate at a higher temperature and chemical potential (Fig. 10a). As expected, the electrical conductivity tends to increase with temperature due to the formation of electron–hole pairs. For example, the σ/τ ≈ 2.06 × 1019 Ω−1 m−1 s−1 and 6.12 × 1018 Ω−1 m−1 s−1 at 700 K and 100 K respectively for μ → εf. However, for the doped systems the electrical conductivity is higher than the pristine system due to the injection of charge carriers by doping (Fig. S6(a), ESI†). At room temperature, the maximum of the electrical conductivity 4.52 × 1019 Ω−1 m−1 s−1 appears at μ − εf = 0.40 eV. The DOS shows a symmetric nature in the VB and CB around the Fermi surface,39 which suggests equal carrier concentrations around the VB and CB edge. This implies a nearly symmetric behavior of the electrical conductivity around μ − εf = 0.
The variation of the Seebeck coefficient (S) with the chemical potential (μ) is shown in Fig. 10b. The sign of the Seebeck coefficient indicates the nature of the majority carriers (electrons/holes) for the system with μ − εf ≠ 0.0. It is evident from the figure that the Seebeck coefficient reaches a minimum (−67.0 × 1018 μV K−1) at μ − εf = 0.053 eV (this corresponds to the maximum value of the Seebeck coefficient for electron doping), while it reaches the maximum value (72.7 × 1018 μV K−1) at μ − εf = −0.056 eV (maximum value for hole doping) at room temperature. These values are better compared with values of graphene55 and are comparable to silicene on a graphene substrate (Si2C6).56 While the Seebeck coefficient is nearly constant for pristine TS systems (μ − εf = 0.0), S reaches a maximum value at around 250–300 K for μ − εf = ±0.05 (Fig. S6(b), ESI†).
The power factor is another important parameter for the transport properties. The calculated value of the power factor P = S2σ/τ is shown in Fig. 10c. The variation of power factor with chemical potential is anisotropic. The maximum value of the power factor is higher in the μ − εf < 0 region than with μ − εf > 0, and the obtained value is 9.29 × 1010 W m−1 K−2 s−1 for μ < 0 (μ − εf = −0.063 eV) at room temperature. The power factor for pristine TS is independent of temperature and is negligible, while for a doped system it rises to a maximum value at around 300 K. It is interesting to note that for a hole-doped system the power factor is higher than the electron-doped system (Fig. S6(c), ESI†).
Finally, we calculated the electronic figure of merit (ZTel) using eqn (12), which is a dimensionless parameter, determining the thermoelectric performance of the material and this is shown in Fig. 10d. As a general rule, materials with good thermoelectric components have ZT ≈ 1. Although large values of ZT have been predicted in a few materials, concerning their practical application and synthesis, however, it is far from reality.57 Larger values of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity and a small value of thermal conductivity should lead to a larger ZT. But due to the Weidemann–Franz law, κel/σ = constant × T (generally for metals), the increase of any one of these conductivities will lead to the increase of the other.58 Also, ZTel as given in eqn (12) is not a physically measurable quantity but is still important as it provides the maximum value of the total figure of merit ZT. A small ZTel will always imply a smaller ZT. Our results show that the maximum ZTel ≈ 0.156 appears at μ − εf = −0.063 eV at room temperature. The figure of merit for μ − εf = 0.0 is nearly zero for all temperatures (Fig. S6(d), ESI†). For μ − εf = ±0.05 the figure of merit reaches a maximum at 250 K, with the value ZTel for hole-doped systems being slightly higher than the electron-doped system. With the rise of temperature both the electrical and thermal conductivities increase according to the Weidemann–Franz law, and ZTel is nearly proportional to S2. The maximum value of ZTel is large compared with graphene,55 but it is smaller than silicene or germanene.59 We have compared the thermoelectric properties of a few 2D materials in Table 5. A higher value of the power factor, as well as the figure of merit, suggest that TS will give a better performance when hole-doped with an optimal efficiency around 300–350 K. Based on these values we can conclude that TS can be a better option for its potential application in thermoelectric devices.

4.2 Nanoribbons
The electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, and figure of merit for the nanoribbons were also studied as a function of chemical potential with temperature as a parameter (Fig. S7–S12, ESI†). We considered nanoribbons of width N = 3 and 4 for S-ATSNR and ZTSNR, while N = 3.5 and 4.5 for A-ATSNR. The maximum values of these four thermoelectric parameters at room temperature are tabulated in Table 6. The electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and power factor for the nanoribbons are of the same order as the TS nanosheet. The maximum electrical conductivity of all NRs appears away from the pristine state. Also, the NRs show a large figure of merit at low temperatures (100 K). This suggests that NRs could be suitable for high thermoelectric performance for low-to-room-temperature regions. Among the NRs the power factor of A-ATSNR is higher than that of the comparable width S-ATSNR and ZTSNR, also the higher value of the figure of merit indicates that A-ATSNR exhibits a better thermoelectric performance with appropriate doping.

Our theoretical study of these optical and thermo-electrical properties of the TS nanosheet and TSNRs will surely motivate further research, both theoretical and experimental, synthesis, application, and exploration of other properties. In this respect, we believe that the theoretical results of free-standing T-silicene may be a roadmap for experimentalists. However, similar to silicene, this material needs a metal substrate for its growth during synthesis. The formation energy comparable to silicene, absence of negative phonon modes, and its mechanical and dynamical stability suggest that it may be synthesized in the near future. In ref. 39 the authors suggested a possible route for the synthesis of this material.
5 Conclusion
In summary, we have systematically investigated the optical and thermoelectric properties of the 2D non-hexagonal TS sheet and nanoribbons using first-principles calculations. The optical properties of these structures are highly anisotropic. The optical properties of the NRs are largely dependent on the edge state and the types of polarization. Strong optical responses are observed in the IR to visible region for incident light of parallel polarization whereas for perpendicular polarization it is in the UV region of the EM spectrum. Calculation of the imaginary part of the dielectric function of the sheet reveals the existence of both π–π* interband and σ band transitions. Multiple plasma frequencies for the sheet and TSNRs are observed for parallel polarization, which are also confirmed by the EELS peaks. The ATSNR shows strong absorption in the IR and UV regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The electrical conductivity, the figure of merit, and the power factor of the TS sheet are found to be higher than graphene at room temperature, which suggests TS as a better material for its performance in thermoelectric devices over graphene. The TS sheet will perform better in the hole-doped region than in the pristine or electron-doped region. The figure of merit calculation shows that A-ATSNR provides a better thermoelectric performance than the TS sheet. So the wonderful optical and thermoelectric properties of the TS sheet and its nanoribbons may register them as an obvious choice for present optical, opto-electronics, and thermoelectric devices.
