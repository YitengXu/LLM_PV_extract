    , Accepted 11th October 2020First published on 12th October 2020AbstractThe application of two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon-based materials in photocatalysis has been limited to date, because the nature and role of π-conjugated moieties in them remain unclear. Herein we propose and study bilayer BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N van der Waals heterostructures as direct Z-scheme photocatalysts for overall water splitting using density functional theory calculations. The roles of polar π-conjugated moieties in the formation, stacking configuration, and electronic and optical properties of bilayer van der Waals heterostructures are discussed. It is shown that polar π-conjugated moieties of graphitic BCN monolayers lead to a favorable π–π interaction, determining the most stable stacking configuration, and a long-range charge transfer between components. The former makes the electronic band structure of heterostructures favor photocatalytic water splitting in efficiency and energetics. The latter generates a built-in electric field for the interface recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, indicating a Z-scheme mechanism. The delocalized nature of π-conjugated electrons in monolayer components allows for high carrier mobility of bilayer heterostructures, promoting the photocatalytic reactions on graphitic BCN monolayers. These findings show that 2D π-conjugated materials, including graphitic carbon-based materials and biological systems, have great potential in the design and development of 2D metal-free direct Z-scheme photocatalysts for environmental purification and energy conversion.
Introduction
Since its discovery in 2004,1 graphene has been leading the way in the development and application of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials in the fields of condensed matter physics, materials science, and chemistry, because of its stable and perfect hexagonal structure2,3 and unique and extraordinary physical and chemical properties.4–6 The former offers the convenience of processing of innovative materials for devices, and the latter accommodates the diversity of devices. To some extent, these advantages make carbon-based materials comparable to or even beyond silicon-based materials in nanodevice applications.7,8 From a local-bond point of view, the conjugated π bond in graphene is thought to be responsible for its high carrier mobility (∼200000 cm2 V−1 s−1),9 which would typically be prevalent in most 2D graphitic carbon-based materials. However, the zero band gap of graphene limits its practical applications involving electronics, such as field-effect transistors, and photoelectrochemistry, such as photocatalysts. So, a range of strategies and approaches, such as heteroatom doping, strain engineering, electric field, substrate effect, and multilayer stacking and so on,10–14 have been developed to open the band gap. Among them, the substitutional doping is a popular and fruitful approach.15,16 In view of the compatibility of charge and ionic radii, boron (B) and nitrogen (N) are always the preferred choices for substitutional doping, which can be achieved in the fabrication of graphene.17,18 It is of course also commonly used in the design of other popular graphitic carbon-based materials for a broad range of applications.19,20
Unlike random doping, uniform doping is expected, to the greatest extent possible, to inherit the property of the host by the inherited structure, and thus has attracted renewed attention. A decade ago, a uniform graphitic BC3 honeycomb sheet with high crystalline quality like graphene was prepared on the NbB2(0001) surface in an epitaxial manner.21 Until a few years ago, a similar 2D graphitic C3N sheet was fabricated from the polymerization of 2,3-diaminophenazineis by a hydrothermal treatment.22 Such graphitic C3N nanofilms have remarkably high elastic modulus and tensile strength comparable to those of graphene, identifying them as promising candidates for new application in nanoelectronics. More recently, with the aid of borylation reactions, a variety of B,N-codoped graphenes, containing a structural unit of the formula of BC6N, have been synthesized in two steps from commercially available starting materials.23 The experimental measurements and theoretical calculations indicated that monolayer BC3 and C3N are respectively p-type and n-type semiconductors with the indirect band gaps of 1.0–2.0 eV, while the graphitic BC6N monolayer is a direct band gap semiconductor of 1.8 eV. Apart from the band gap suitable for visible-light absorption, these uniformly B- and N-doped, and BN-codoped graphene materials have a common structural feature, that is, uniformly distributed doped species (B or N) connecting benzene rings as building blocks into a hexagonal lattice. Two fragments of benzene ring and coordinated B or N atoms construct a polar π-conjugated moiety, with an uneven distribution of charge on the monolayer. It should be noted that it is due to the difference of electronegativity between C and B or N in BCN systems. The delocalized π-conjugated nature of benzene rings, involving carrier mobility, is partially inherited to facilitate electron transport of BCN monolayers. For example, the electron and hole mobilities of graphitic BC6N monolayers were estimated to be higher than those of MoS2 and black phosphorus (BP).24 Even so, the recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in a graphitic π-conjugated BCN monolayer is very high, which is harmful to photocatalytic water splitting.
Following the natural photosynthesis process in green plants and based on type-II heterostructures, a Z-scheme system composed of two semiconductors is proposed.25 The two half reactions of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occur simultaneously in different semiconductors.26 The design is capable of realizing the requirements in efficiency and energetics of photocatalytic water splitting, and has been completed in ZnO/Cu2O,27 NiS/CdS,28 ZnO/CdS,29 BP/BiVO4,30 γ-MnS/Cu7S4,31 Fe2O3/g-C3N4,32 MoSe2/HfS2,33 BCN/C2N,34 and g-C3N4/TiO235 heterostructures and so on. For its construction, the critical issue is how to channel and accelerate the interlayer recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs through the interface. An early characterization of atomically thin p–n heterostructures using transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) revealed that the tunneling dominates the interlayer recombination of the majority carriers, which is responsible for the electronic and optoelectronic processes.36 Further experimental and theoretical studies showed that the ultrafast charge transfer between layers occurs very rapidly, typically within 50 fs, in TMDC heterostructures with type-II band alignment,37,38 which is attributable to excitonic resonances of the constituent layers.39 Moreover, recent density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the C3N/graphene heterostructure exhibits a metallic behavior and is stable under the applied large strains of about 10%.40
In the light of appropriate band gap, high carrier mobility especially, and different behaviors in redox processes of p-type and n-type semiconductors, we propose and design vertically stacked BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures with π-conjugated moieties. A recent DFT study has demonstrated that there exists an effective electron coupling in 2D BC3/C3N heterostructures, which would result in a large interlayer built-in electric field, improve the optical properties and generate new physics. In view of this, the 2D BC3/C3N heterostructures are expected to be available for electronics and photoelectronics.41 Inspired by this exciting finding, we thoroughly evaluate, from the energetic, kinetic and thermodynamic points of view, the potential of BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures as direct Z-scheme photocatalysts for overall water splitting, which is recognized as an important application of heterostructures. We focus on the nature of π–π stacking interaction of layered hexagonal BCN systems and interesting physics associated with polar π-conjugated moieties using first principles calculations. That is, the effects of π–π interaction on the stacking configuration, interlayer coupling, electronic structure and photocatalytic properties of heterostructures are explored. The reason is that a number of studies have shown that catalysts immobilized by π–π stacking have superior selectivity in various fields.42,43
Methodology and calculation model
The periodic slab model considered here includes monolayers of BC3, C3N and BC6N, and bilayers of BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N. In general, 2D hexagonal BC3, C3N and BC6N monolayers have similar simulation unit cells (eight atoms), where there are six C atoms of a benzene ring, and either two B or N atoms (for the BC3 or C3N),44,45 or one B and one N atom (for the BC6N).23,24 As depicted in Fig. 1, a representative unit cell is used to model graphitic BC3, C3N and BC6N monolayers and BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N bilayers.

All calculations including structural optimization and total energy calculations are performed using DFT as implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation package (VASP).46 The projector augmented wave (PAW) method47 and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional48 are used for the interaction between the core and valence electrons and the exchange–correlation energy, respectively. The plane-wave cutoff energy is set to 500 eV. The Brillouin zone for the unit cell is sampled with a 11 × 11 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh.49 A vacuum region of more than 20 Å along the normal direction of the monolayer (i.e., the z axis) is chosen to avoid the spurious interactions between the periodic images. The van der Waals interaction in the bilayer is primarily responsible for the interlayer binding energy, interlayer spacing and stacking order. So, the DFT-D2 method of Grimme50 with its default force-field parameters is employed. The convergence criteria for the electronic self-consistent energy and the ionic relaxation are 1 × 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional51 is adopted to obtain accurate electronic structure and optical properties.
The interlayer binding energy, Ebinding, of the A/B heterostructure, constructed by monolayer components A and B, is defined as below Ebinding = EA/B − EA − EB(1)where EA/B, EA and EB are the total energies of the A/B heterostructure, isolated A and B monolayers, respectively. After full geometry optimization, the calculated lattice constants of monolayer BC3, C3N and BC6N are, respectively, 5.174, 4.860 and 4.979 Å, in good agreement with those previously reported by others.24,44,45 More precisely, the bond lengths of C–B and C–C for the BC3 monolayer are 1.565 and 1.422 Å, the bond lengths of C–N and C–C for the C3N monolayer are 1.403 and 1.404 Å, and the bond lengths of C–B, C–N and C–C for the BC6N monolayer are 1.471, 1.453 and 1.413 Å. Based on these calculated values, we estimate that the lattice mismatches between monolayer BC3 and C3N, and between monolayer BC3 and BC6N are less than 6.1% and 3.8%, respectively. In the actual calculations of heterostructures, we first put two different constituent layers together in the same unit cell with the lattice constant of BC3 (Fig. 1d and e). Next, we calculate the total energy of the unit cell with decreasing the lattice constant. After a series of test trials, we obtain the equilibrium lattice constant of the unit cell of heterostructures, which has the minimum total energy.
Results and discussion
As components of heterostructures, the calculated band structures of monolayer BC3, C3N and BC6N are shown in Fig. 2a–c. Rather different from graphene (a zero gap semiconductor with the conduction and valence bands meeting at the Dirac point4), both graphitic BC3 and C3N monolayers are semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 1.83 and 1.04 eV, respectively, while the BC6N monolayer is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.83 eV. More precisely, the valence band maximum (VBM) of the BC3 is located at the Γ point, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) lies at the M point. In contrast, for the C3N monolayer the VBM is at the M point and the CBM is at the Γ point. While both the VBM and CBM of the BC6N monolayer are situated at the K point. All of these results are in good agreement with the previous reports.24 Under visible-light or infrared light for water splitting reaction, electrons are excited from the valence band into the conduction band to drive the hydrogen reduction, and simultaneously, holes are left in the valence band to catalyze the water oxidation. The partial density of states (PDOS) and electronic charge density (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†) clearly show that except for the VBM of the BC3 (σ-character), the VBMs and CBMs of others have the pz π-character. Fig. 2d reveals that the band edges of all three monolayers do not straddle the H2O redox potential levels, indicating that they are not suitable for overall water splitting. But, importantly, the VBM of the BC3 is lower than the standard water oxidation potential of O2/H2O (−5.67 eV at pH = 0) by 0.83 eV, while the CBMs of monolayer C3N and BC6N are higher than the standard hydrogen reduction potential of H+/H2 (−4.44 eV at pH = 0) by 1.92 and 0.98 eV. The obvious complementary relationship suggests that the three π-conjugated monolayers likely function as paired components of the Z-scheme system to achieve overall solar water splitting. In particular, such large potential differences between the CBM and reduction potential of H+/H2, and the VBM and oxidation potential of H2O/O2 will allow the proposed heterostructures with π-conjugated moieties to have strong redox abilities for water splitting.

The bilayer BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures are respectively constructed by stacking monolayer BC3 and C3N, and BC3 and BC6N in the vertical direction (i.e., the z axis). To get the best combination structure, we consider five and eight possible high-symmetry stacking configurations for BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N bilayers, respectively. For the BC3/C3N bilayer, they are denoted as AA, AB, AC, AD and AE (Fig. S3, ESI†). In pattern AA, the BC3 and C3N layers are eclipsed completely. Starting from the AA (eclipsed) stacking, the AB, AC and AD patterns are generated by the translation of the BC3 layer by a C–B bond length along the armchair direction (i.e., the x axis) in each step. The AE pattern is obtained by the shift of the BC3 by half a unit cell along the zigzag direction (i.e., the y axis). The same procedure is also performed for high-symmetry stacking patterns of the BC3/BC6N bilayer. They are denoted as AA, AB, AC, AD, AE, AF and AH, except for the AG one that is obtained by the translation of the BC6N by one and a half C–B bond lengths along the armchair direction (Fig. S4, ESI†). After a series of test trials, we see that the AA stacking, whether for the BC3/C3N or BC3/BC6N bilayers, is the highest-energy configuration. This is the same as the case of graphene on h-BN sheet,52 to some extent, indicating a special π–π stacking interaction involving polar π-conjugated moieties in layered hexagonal BCN systems. More interestingly, for the BC3/C3N bilayer the AC stacking where the B atom of the BC3 is situated above the center of the benzene ring of the C3N, is energetically most favorable, with an interlayer binding energy of −39.33 meV per atom (Table S1, ESI†). While in the BC3/BC6N bilayer, except for the AA stacking, other stacking configurations are nearly degenerate in energy, although the AG stacking has the lowest-energy (with an interlayer binding energy of −28.99 meV per atom) (Table S2, ESI†). In the AG stacking, the C atom of the BC3 is positioned above the center of the benzene ring of the BC6N, and simultaneously, the C atom linked to the N atom of the BC6N is located below the center of the benzene ring of the BC3 (or the N atom of the BC6N sits on top of a C atom of the BC3). Both the lowest-energy stacking patterns of BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N bilayers are similar to the case of graphene on h-BN sheet too, which also follows the π–π stacking interaction protocol of layered hexagonal BCN systems mentioned above. That is, the electrostatic π–π repulsive interaction between the benzene rings is partially neutralized by the electrostatic attractive interaction between the B and N atoms of different constituent layers in the heterobilayer. As a direct consequence, the interlayer binding energies of BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N are lower than those of bilayer graphene (−27.08 meV per atom)53 and graphene/h-BN (∼−20.75 meV per atom).52 The interlayer spacings of 3.05 Å for the BC3/C3N and 3.17 Å for the BC3/BC6N are both smaller than those of bilayer graphene (3.25 Å) and graphene/h-BN (3.35 Å). So in what follows, we choose the AC and AG stackings respectively as the most likely structures of BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N bilayers, to elucidate the design and construction of direct Z-scheme photocatalysts immobilized by π–π stacking for overall solar water splitting.
To gain insight into the band compositions, the orbital resolved band structures of BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures are calculated and plotted in Fig. 3. From it, we can see that different from monolayer components, the BC3/C3N heterostructure has a direct band gap of 0.41 eV, while the BC3/BC6N heterostructure has an indirect band gap of 1.35 eV. The difference in the band gap between them is related to the interlayer interactions. As expected, the CBM is contributed by the BC3 monolayer (an electron-deficient system), and the VBM is dominated by the C3N or BC6N monolayer (an electron-rich system). It is evident that both the semiconductor–semiconductor bilayers immobilized by π–π stacking have a type-II staggered band structure, which would be in favor of the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Furthermore, the strains are −3.03% and 3.23% for the BC3 and C3N in the BC3/C3N heterostructure, while in the BC3/BC6N heterostructure, they are −1.89% and 1.95%, respectively, for the BC3 and BC6N. Consequently, the artificial lattice strain (from structural effects) and the interlayer interaction (from electronic effects) affect the band gap of heterostructures. More precisely, the band gaps of the BC3 reduce from 1.83 (isolated) to 1.58 and 1.71 eV in BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures, respectively, under compressive stress. While the band gaps of C3N and BC6N components increase from 1.04 (isolated) and 1.83 (isolated) to 1.37 and 1.87 eV, respectively, under tensile stress. By contrast, we also study the effect of strains, comparable to the values in heterostructures, on electronic structure of the three monolayers. Results (Fig. S5, ESI†) show that the band gaps are slightly changed, but the positions in K-space of the CBM and VBM remain unchanged under these strains. More precisely, the band gap of BC3 decreases by 0.32 eV under the compressive strain of −3.5%, the band gap of C3N increases by 0.14 eV under the tensile strain of 3.5% and the band gap of BC6N decreases by 0.02 eV for under the tensile strain of 2%, respectively. As a direct consequence, the monolayer BC3, C3N and BC6N components in heterostructures can be excited by visible-light irradiation. In detail, Fig. 4 illustrates the optical absorption coefficients α of BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures, with respect to monolayer BC3, C3N and BC6N. The absorption intensities of the three π-conjugated monolayers, which have two or three absorption peaks, are up to 105 cm−1. It is clearly seen that monolayer BC3 shows strong light absorption in the blue region of the spectrum, while monolayer C3N and BC6N exhibit excellent and considerable light absorption in the visible-light region, respectively. In comparison with these monolayers, the two proposed van der Waals heterostructures, especially BC3/C3N, exhibit significantly improved visible-light (and even near-infrared light) absorption capability.

From Fig. 2d, we also evaluate the work functions of monolayer BC3, C3N and BC6N, with respect to the vacuum level. They are 5.24, 2.96, and 4.54 eV, respectively (Fig. S6, ESI† for the calculation procedure of the work function). Once two constituent monolayers are in contact, owing to their work function difference, electrons certainly will flow from C3N or BC6N to BC3 until their Fermi levels are aligned at the same level. Bader charge analysis shows that the BC3 gains 0.12e or 0.05e from the paired C3N or BC6N, respectively. To further illustrate the electron transfer process and pathway, the electron density difference and the planar-averaged electron density difference along the z direction of BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures are calculated and depicted in Fig. 5. It is the interlayer electron transport, involving the tunneling of electrons between monolayers. The charge redistribution mainly occurs at the interface region. Specifically, positive charges build up in the C3N or BC6N (forming the electron-deficient region), while negative charges accumulate in the region close to the BC3 (forming the electron-rich region), as shown in Fig. 5a and b. A built-in electric field is thereby established between the two constituent monolayers. Its direction is from C3N or BC6N monolayer to BC3 monolayer (Fig. 5b). In this case, the induced built-in electric field will accelerate the transfer of photoexcited electrons of the BC3 (the electron-rich region) to the paired C3N or BC6N (the electron-deficient region) through the heterostructure interface.

E is a build-in electric field pointing from C3N (BC6N) to BC3, as indicated by the red arrow. 
Based on BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures, a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system immobilized by π–π stacking is designed. As shown in Fig. 6, when BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures are irradiated by visible-light, electrons of BC3, C3N and BC6N monolayers are excited from the respective VBM to the respective CBM, and simultaneously holes are left in the respective VBM. Since the two junction band gaps (0.41 eV for the BC3/C3N, and 1.35 eV for the BC3/BC6N) are considerably smaller than those of the isolated monolayers (1.58 eV for BC3 and 1.37 eV for C3N in the BC3/C3N, and 1.71 eV for the BC3 and 1.81 eV for the BC6N in the BC3/BC6N, as indicated in Fig. 3), the recombination rate and probability of photogenerated electron–hole pairs through the junction interface are higher than those in the respective hosts. This is quite different from the case of type-II TMDC heterostructures,36 in which the charge transfer between layers occurs very rapidly, far more quickly than the interlayer recombination.54 More importantly, the built-in electric field on one hand prevents the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CBM of C3N or BC6N to the CBM of the BC3, and photogenerated holes from the VBM of the BC3 to the VBM of C3N or BC6N. On the other hand, it also accelerates the interlayer recombination of photogenerated electrons from the CBM of the BC3 and photogenerated holes in the VBM of paired C3N or BC6N in the interface region, being an ultrafast dynamic process.34 The separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is achieved in BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures. In addition, the built-in electric field extends the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes on the surfaces of the respective hosts. As a consequence, the remaining photogenerated electrons in the CBM of C3N or BC6N and photogenerated holes in the VBM of BC3 will participate in the following reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively. More typically, the CBM of the C3N locates at 0.83 eV above the standard reduction potential of H+/H2, and the VBM of the BC3 locates at 0.51 below the standard oxidation potential of H2O/O2 in the BC3/C3N heterostructure (Fig. 6a). Similarly, the potential of the CBM for the BC6N is 0.36 eV higher than the standard reduction potential of H+/H2, and the potential of the VBM for the BC3 is 0.65 eV lower than the standard oxidation potential of H2O/O2 in the BC3/BC6N heterostructure (Fig. 6b). These potential differences correspond to the reducing and oxidizing powers regarding photogenerated carriers in the HER and OER.55 They are large enough to suggest that under solar irradiation, the HER and OER for water splitting can proceed spontaneously on the surfaces of C3N or BC6N and BC3 in heterostructures, respectively. More precisely, the redox ability of the BC3/C3N heterostructure is stronger than that of the BC3/BC6N heterostructure due to larger potential difference. Further tests show that from the perspective of adsorption energies of reaction intermediates (i.e., O, OH and OOH for the OER, and H for the HER), we can speculate that the C of C3N or BC6N are the active sites for the HER and the B of BC3 are the active sites for the OER, in BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures (Tables S3 and S4, ESI†). These results are consistent with previous DFT studies of the HER and OER on BCN or C3N monolayers.56,57

From the perspective of reaction kinetics, the mobility of photogenerated carriers, like as the separation of photogenerated carriers, is also a crucial factor for determining the photocatalytic activity and efficiency of catalyst materials. In principle, the high mobility of carriers means that there are more available photogenerated electrons and holes at the respective reactive sites per unit time. Here, we study the transport properties of carriers of heterostructures using the deformation potential theory.58 The carrier mobility is calculated using the below formula: (2)where C2D is the elastic modulus and derived from (E − E0)/S0 = C(Δl/l0)2/2, in which E0 and S0 are the total energy and the lattice volume at equilibrium for a 2D semiconductor. me* is the effective mass of electrons or holes in the transport direction and md is the average effective mass defined by . And Ei1 is the deformation potential constant determined by Ei1 = ΔVi/(Δl/l0), where ΔVi represents the energy change of the ith band under proper cell compression and dilatation, l0 is the lattice constant in the transport direction and Δl is the deformation of l0. T is the temperature used for the carrier mobility calculations. The calculated mobilities of electrons and holes for monolayer BC3, C3N and BC6N, and bilayer BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures at room temperature are listed in Table S5 (ESI†) and Fig. 7. As expected, the mobilities of carriers in these π-conjugated monolayers as well as π–π stacking heterostructures display evident anisotropy, which will facilitate the migration and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity and efficiency of water splitting. More precisely, the electron mobility of graphitic BC3 in the x direction is significantly higher than that in the y direction and the hole mobility. While in the graphitic C3N, the hole mobility in the x direction is predominant over others. The mobilities of carriers of graphitic BC3 and C3N are much lower than those in graphitic BC6N. In the latter, the electron mobilities are about 8.73 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.24 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x and y directions, while the hole mobilities are about 1.39 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.85 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x and y directions, respectively. These values are two orders of magnitude higher than those of transition metal chalcogenides.59,60 This is quite compatible with the delocalized π-conjugated nature of layered hexagonal BCN monolayers. When the graphitic BC3 and C3N or BC6N are combined into bilayer BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures, the carrier mobility is significantly enhanced (Table S5, ESI†). To this end, we study the contribution of strains, induced by the lattice mismatches, to the high carrier mobility. For comparison, only the strains, which are comparable to the values in heterostructures, are considered here. Results show that the effect of stains on the high carrier mobility is relatively small for the three monolayers (Table S6, ESI†). According to the calculation formula (2) of carrier mobility, we can also infer that the enhanced carrier mobility in heterostructures is mainly attributed to the drastically increased elastic moduli and lower deformation potentials of heterostructures than those of separated components (Table S5, ESI†). Moreover, according to the reaction mechanism of water splitting (Fig. 6), we calculate the hole mobility of BC3 electrode for the OER and the electron mobility of C3N electrode for the HER in the BC3/C3N heterostructure, and the hole mobility of BC3 electrode for the OER and the electron mobility of BC6N electrode for the HER in the BC3/BC6N heterostructure. The results are listed in Table S7 (ESI†). It is found that the electron mobility for the HER in the BC3/BC6N heterostructure along the y direction is up to ∼1.12 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, far exceeding the value in the BC3/C3N, and it is only an order of magnitude lower than that in graphene. In a word, from the extremely high carrier mobility, it can be inferred that direct Z-scheme BC3/BC6N heterostructures immobilized by π–π stacking have good photocatalytic performance.

Conclusions
Our calculations from the stability, efficiency and energetics show that BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures can be used as direct Z-scheme photocatalysts for overall solar water splitting. The constituent hexagonal BCN monolayer contains a benzene ring and the coordinated B or N atoms, being a polar π-conjugated moiety. The two fragments have different properties and functions. The stacking interaction of bilayer BCN heterostructures arises from the repulsion of the benzene ring and the electrostatic attraction between the B and N atoms. The lattice strain and the interlayer interaction allow the band gap and the positions of the VBM and CBM of components to be beneficial for both light harvesting and redox reactions. The special π–π interaction determines the interlayer charge transfer, which induces an electric field between monolayers. The electric field accelerates the recombination of photogenerated electrons of the graphitic BC3 and photogenerated holes of paired graphitic C3N or BC6N through the heterostructure interface, and increases the availability of photogenerated electrons and holes on the surfaces of graphitic C3N or BC6N and BC3. The BC3/C3N and BC3/BC6N heterostructures follow the Z-scheme mechanism. The π-conjugated property of layered hexagonal BCN monolayers endows heterostructures with high carrier mobility of up to ∼1.12 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, which will promote the HER/OER on monolayer components from a dynamic perspective. Our present work opens up a door for the design of direct Z-scheme photocatalysts based on 2D heterostructures immobilized by π–π stacking for overall water splitting and environmental purification. The available candidate materials are graphitic carbon-based materials and biological systems that should at least contain π-conjugated moieties.
