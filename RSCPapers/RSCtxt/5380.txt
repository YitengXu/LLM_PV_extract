    , Accepted 11th August 2020First published on 12th August 2020AbstractIn this work, two novel electron-deficient groups phenanthrothiadiazole (PT) and triphenylenobisthiadiazole (TBT) are utilized to construct donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type hole-transporting materials (HTMs). The electronic, optical and charge transport properties are evaluated by performing quantum chemical calculations. Our results show that, in comparison with that of the benzothiadiazole (BT, SM-1) unit, the newly designed SM-2 and SM-3 display more deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. Meanwhile, the blue-shifted light absorption spectra are also obtained, which will be helpful in enhancing the absorption of the perovskite layer. Unfortunately, the hole mobilities of SM-2 and SM-3 are slightly lower than that of SM-1 due to the weak intermolecular electronic coupling. In addition, we also find that better solubility and stable dimeric configuration are obtained for the new HTMs. Overall, this work provides some useful clues for designing new acceptor structures in D–A–D-type HTMs, and a potential HTM SM-3 is proposed.
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been extensively investigated as promising alternatives to conventional silicon-based solar cells due to their low cost, easy fabrication, and high power conversion efficiencies of up to 25.2%.1–3 In typical PSCs, sunlight is absorbed by the perovskite material to generate excitons, meanwhile the electron- and hole-transporting materials (HTMs) act as indispensable buffer layers to enhance interfacial charge separation following transport, and to reduce the loss of undesirable electron–hole recombination. To date, a large variety of HTMs, from organic small molecules to polymers, and inorganic compounds, have been utilized in PSCs to improve the cell performance.4–15 Among the varied HTMs, linear-conjugated organic small molecules with a donor–π–donor (D–π–D) configuration have been largely investigated due to their easy synthesis and simple molecule architecture,16–21 whereas the donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type HTMs are rarely reported.22–30 Moreover, the incorporation of an electron-deficient acceptor unit in D–A–D-type HTMs can rationally decrease the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and boost the intramolecular charge transfer between the donor and acceptor moieties.
The engineering of acceptor structures can help in tailoring the physicochemical properties of D–A–D type HTMs. However, to date, only several electron-deficient units, such as benzothiadiazole,22,23 quinoxaline,25 and thienopyrazine,26 have been employed to construct high-efficient HTMs. As we know, the acceptor group with the stronger electron-withdrawing ability can make the HOMO level of HTMs negatively shift. Meanwhile, introducing a big π-conjugated core is one of the most effective strategies to facilitate the hole transport in HTMs because the planar molecular conformation is favorable to enhance the intermolecular π–π interaction. The structural versatility of D–A–D-type HTMs allows the incorporation of different electron-deficient groups to improve the performance of HTMs. With this in mind, two novel D–A–D-type HTMs (SM-2 and SM-3) are designed based on the electron-deficient phenanthrothiadiazole (PT) and triphenylenobisthiadiazole (TBT) groups, where p-methoxy-substituted triphenylamine (MeOTPA) is selected as an electron-donating moiety, as shown in Fig. 1. In comparison with the benzothiadiazole (BT) unit (SM-1 in Fig. 1), PT and TBT possessed different electron-deficient properties, which are believed to be useful for regulating the HOMO energy level of HTMs. The electronic, optical and charge transport properties are investigated by combining first-principles calculations and the Marcus theory of electron transfer. The detailed computational procedures are presented in the ESI.† By introducing the PT and TBT, the HOMO levels of SM-2 and SM-3 exhibit obvious down-shift compared with that of SM-1. Meanwhile, the less light absorption in the visible region and high hole mobilities are also displayed for SM-2 and SM-3. The calculated results show that the PT and TBT can be potential acceptor groups to construct highly efficient HTMs. We hope our work provides useful clues for further experimental synthesis.

The optimized molecular geometries and the TBT core are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). As displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the similar dihedral angles between the MeOTPA moiety and the central core can be found for designed HTMs, which range from 31° to 34°. Especially, the TBT displays a steric twisted core configuration, the torsion angle for the biphenyl and bithiadiazole in both sides of central ethylene is 16.4° (Fig. S1, ESI†). The optimized molecular coordinates are provided in the ESI.†
In order to guarantee an effective hole transfer at the perovskite/HTM interface and to block the undesirable electron transfer from the perovskite to the metal electrode, the HOMO energy level of HTMs should be higher than the valence band maximum (VBM) of perovskite (such as (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, −5.65 eV),26 meanwhile the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level should be higher than the conduction band minimum (CBM) of perovskite (Fig. 2, −4.05 eV). A deeper HOMO level is favorable to get a larger open-circuit voltage of PSCs because its value usually depends on the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the ETMs and the HOMO level of HTMs. Therefore, obtaining reliable molecule energy levels is an important step for designing new HTMs. The HOMO levels of designed HTMs presented in this work are revised by a semi-rational formula,31 which has been demonstrated to be effective for estimating the experimental HOMOs. As shown in Fig. 2, the HOMO energy level of SM-1 is −5.31 eV, which is in good agreement with the experimental value (−5.35 eV).26 Due to the increased conjugated length between the acceptor group and MeOTPA-donor, SM-2 and SM-3 display more stable HOMO levels with the data of −5.38 and −5.36 eV, respectively. The negative shift of 50–70 meV compared with that of SM-1 is believed to be useful for enlarging the open-circuit voltage. In addition, to further testify the reliability of the obtained HOMO levels, the functional PBE33 and PBE38, coupled with the 6-31G** basis set, are also employed.32 As listed in Table S1 (ESI†), the data with the PBE33/6-31G** and the PBE38/6-31G** methods are in good accordance with that revised by the semi-rational formula. Compared with the experimental value of SM-1, the error of the functional PBE33 and PBE38 is 0.08 eV, whereas the data obtained by the B3LYP/6-31G** method are largely underestimated in absolute number. For the LUMOs, the relatively reliable values can be obtained by adding the first singlet excitation energies to the HOMOs.31 As displayed in Fig. 2, all the LUMOs are higher that the CBM of perovskite, which guarantee that the loss of electron–hole recombination can be effectively inhibited. Furthermore, the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) usually displays an important role for the charge transport in organic semiconductors. The HOMOs of investigated HTMs are almost delocalized on the whole molecule skeleton except the less distribution on the thiadiazole units. By contrast, the LUMOs are mainly localized at acceptors, which indicate that the designed HTMs tend to display good hole transport properties.
 Fig. 2  Calculated frontier molecular orbital energy levels and the spatial distributions of designed HTMs. 
To evaluate the effect of the acceptor group on the optical performance of designed HTMs, the UV-vis absorption spectra are calculated based on the optimized ground-state geometries by the time-dependent DFT method at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G** level. As listed in Table 1, the maximum absorption wavelength (λabs) of SM-1 is located at 446 nm, which is close to the experimental value of 480 nm.26 For new tailored HTMs (SM-2 and SM-3), the absorption spectra show an obvious blue-shift in comparison with that of SM-1 (Fig. 3) with values of 367 and 400 nm, respectively. As reported previously,33,34 it is desirable for small molecule HTMs to be transparent in the visible light region with no absorption screen effect toward the perovskite layer. Therefore, the blue-shifted absorption spectra of designed HTMs will be helpful to enhance the light absorption of the perovskite layer in the visible spectrum due to the potential optical competition between the HTMs and perovskite. Furthermore, it should also be noted that the low band gap HTMs are likely to offer possibilities to boost light absorption at the longer wavelengths in the near-infrared (NIR) region, where the absorption of perovskite is weaker, to further enhance the photocurrent of PSCs. For all HTMs, the lowest singlet excitation is mainly contributed by the HOMO → LUMO transition.

 Fig. 3  Calculated absorption spectra of the designed HTMs. 
Particularly, we also find that the energy gap of SM-3 is the lowest compared to those of SM-1 and SM-2 (as shown in Fig. 2), which seems to be inconsistent with the blue-shifted absorption spectra of SM-3 because a smaller energy gap between the HOMO and the LUMO usually means the more red-shift of the absorption spectra. Firstly, to verify the reliability of the calculated results, the CAM-B3LYP, MPW1K and BMK functionals, coupled with the 6-31G** basis set, are utilized to calculate the energy levels and absorption spectra of designed HTMs, which has been demonstrated to be effective for evaluating the electronic and optical properties of small molecule HTMs.20,35,36 As listed in Tables S3–S5 (ESI†), the calculated results are in good accordance with the data in Table 1, therefore we believe that calculation methods in this work are reliable. Moreover, to evaluate the electron-withdrawing ability of acceptors, the adiabatic electron affinities (EA) are calculated. As listed in Table S2 (ESI†), the TBT core exhibits the largest value of 2.62 eV, which indicates that the electron-withdrawing ability of the TBT is stronger than that of the BT and PT cores. The obtained LUMO levels of investigated HTMs are consistent with the electron-withdrawing abilities of acceptor groups. As is known, apart from the energy gap, the spatial overlap between the HOMO and the LUMO also plays an important role in the optical excitation of organic small molecules. For SM-3, the LUMO is distributed on the acceptor group, and mainly located at the bithiadiazole unit of the TBT core, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), and the contributed percentage is 79.4%. The HOMO of SM-3 is mainly distributed on the MeOTPA-donors, therefore, the spatial overlap between the HOMO and the LUMO is less. Coupled with the steric twisted configuration of the TBT core, the electron transition from the HOMO to the LUMO is partially inhibited, and thus a large excitation energy, small oscillator strength, and blue-shifted absorption spectra are produced for SM-3 though it has the lowest energy gap compared with that of SM-1 and SM-2. By scrutinizing the detailed transition ratios for several lowest excited-states of SM-3 (Tables S6–S8, ESI†), we also find that the strongest absorption which is located around 350 nm is mainly contributed by the HOMO−3 → LUMO transition. Combined with the orbital distributions (Fig. S6, ESI†), the calculated data show that the strongest absorption of SM-3 is a localized electron excitation, which results in the blue-shifted absorption spectra, as displayed in Fig. 3 and Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†).
To further describe the intramolecular charge transport from the ground-state to the first singlet excited-state, the amount of charge transfer (qct) and transferred distance (dct) are calculated, and the charge density difference (CDD) maps are depicted with the Multiwfn 3.3.8 program.37 As presented in Table 1, SM-3 display a larger qct (0.92 e) and dct (2.38 Å) than SM-1 (0.77 e and 1.30 Å) and SM-2 (0.73 e and 1.27 Å), which derives from the stronger electron-withdrawing capability of the TBT core. Normally, the larger amount of transferred charge, the easier electron–hole dissociation and the weaker Coulomb attraction, and thus the more preferable charge transfer property can be anticipated for SM-3. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the electron is mainly transferred from the donor unit of MeOTPA to the acceptor group during the first singlet excitation.
Besides charge transfer amounts (qct), transferred distances (dct) and CDD maps, the exciton binding energy (EB) is another important parameter for describing the Coulomb attraction in electron–hole pairs. The smaller the exciton binding energy, the easier the bound electron–hole pairs to be dissociated into fully separated positive and negative charges. As listed in Table 1, the calculated EB values of tailored HTMs are 0.78 (SM-1), 0.59 (SM-2) and 0.58 (SM-3) eV, respectively. In comparison with that of SM-1, SM-2 and SM-3 display the smaller exciton binding energies, which mean that the electron–hole pairs of new designed HTMs can more easily dissociate into free charge carriers. On the basis of the discussion above, a better charge transfer property can be anticipated for SM-3 due to its large amount of transferred charge, transferred distance, and small exciton binding energy.
Besides the electronic structure and light absorption, the hole transport is also an important property for scrutinizing potential HTMs. The charge mobility of organic semiconductors is generally evaluated by the thermally activated hopping and diffusion model due to the weak electronic coupling between adjacent molecules. Recently Chi et al. have shown that the simplified hole transport pathway from three-dimension to one-dimension can produce a good estimate of HTM mobility because the more stable dimers have the larger transfer integrals, which further determine the hole mobility of HTMs,31,35 and thus the procedure was adopted in this work. Based on the optimized dimeric structures from the dynamic simulations, the hole transfer integrals (Vab) are calculated, and the results are listed in Table 2. The total electronic energy evolutions and the optimized dimers of the investigated system are shown in Fig. 4. As presented in Table 2, the hole transfer integrals of designed HTMs are 5.48 × 10−3 (SM-1), 3.26 × 10−3 (SM-2) and 3.94 × 10−3 (SM-3) eV, respectively. Interestingly, the new HTM SM-2 and SM-3 display lower Vab values compared with SM-1 though the larger binding energies (ΔEBSSE in Table 1, as discussed below) and the smaller centroid to centroid distances (ri, Table 2) are shown for them due to the stronger intermolecular interactions. To probe the essential elements that influence the couplings, the HOMOs of optimized dimers are further investigated. As displayed in Fig. 5, the HOMO of SM-1 is delocalized over the whole molecule, which is consistent with that of the free HTM, whereas SM-2 and SM-3 exhibit a relatively localized HOMO, and mainly distributed on one of the TPA-donors. Therefore, SM-1 shows a larger Vab due to the easier orbital overlap, and the localized HOMOs of SM-2 and SM-3 make it hard for hole transfer, and thus generates the lower transfer integrals.

According to Marcus theory,38 the reorganization energy (λ) is another important parameter to determine the hole transport in HTMs, and the lower λ value is helpful to facilitate the hole transport. As listed in Table 2, the reorganization energies of SM-1, SM-2 and SM-3 are 0.158, 0.144 and 0.138 eV, respectively. The decreased λ values, which display an adverse influence on the hole hopping rate in comparison with that of the transfer integrals, will be favorable to promote the hole transport in HTMs. Subsequently, the hole mobilities (μ) of designed HTMs are calculated with the Einstein relation.39 As listed in Table 2, the μ values of the designed systems are 1.36 × 10−2 (SM-1), 5.39 × 10−3 (SM-2), and 7.75 × 10−3 (SM-3) cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The mobilities of SM-2 and SM-3 are somewhat lower than that of SM-1 due to the weak electronic couplings, which may affect the hole transport properties of newly designed HTMs.
Generally, a large solubility of HTMs in organic solvents can promote the formation of uniform thin films, and further facilitate charge transport at the perovskite/HTM interface. To estimate the solubility of the newly designed HTMs, the solvation Gibbs free energy (Gsolv) is calculated as the free energy difference of the solute in solution and in the gas phase.36,40 The more negative Gsolv denotes the better solution of HTMs. As shown in Table 1, the solvation free energies of SM-1, SM-2 and SM-3 are −24.48, −27.82 and −30.64 kcal mol−1, respectively. The negative-shifted Gsolv values show that the easier solution can be expected for two new HTMs. Furthermore, to evaluate the intermolecular interaction, the binding energies (ΔEBSSE) of optimized dimers are calculated.41 The basis set superposition error (BSSE) and the dispersion (B3LYP-D3) correction are considered in the calculations. As listed in Table 1, the binding energies of the designed systems are −1.35 (SM-1), −1.76 (SM-2) and −2.07 (SM-3) eV, respectively. The more negative ΔEBSSE values of SM-2 and SM-3 than that of SM-1 mean that the combined configurations of SM-2 and SM-3 are more stable and difficult to separate. Based on the above analysis, SM-2 and SM-3 can be expected to have good solubility and dimeric stability.
In order to evaluate the stability of free HTMs, the absolute hardness (η) and the electrostatic surface potential (ESP) are investigated. The absolute hardness shows the resistance of chemical potential to the change of the electron number, and the larger value implies the better HTM stability. As reported,42 the η is estimated as half of the difference between adiabatic ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA). The obtained data are listed in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 6. The η values of designed HTMs are 1.07 (SM-1), 1.24 (SM-2) and 1.02 (SM-3) eV, respectively. Obviously, SM-2 exhibits larger η than SM-1 and SM-3 due to its larger EIP and smaller EEA values, showing that the better stability can be anticipated for SM-2. Moreover, the ESP maps illustrate that most of the negative charges are located on the central cores, especially for the nitrogen atoms of thiadiazole, and the positive charges are mainly distributed on the hydrogen atoms of methoxy.

In conclusion, we methodically investigated the influence of electron-acceptors on the performance of D–A–D-type small molecule HTMs. On the basis of the electron-deficient PT and TBT units, two new HTMs with a D–A–D configuration are designed and their electronic and charge transport properties are scrutinized with first-principles calculations and Marcus theory. The designed SM-2 and SM-3 display a down-shifted HOMO energy level compared with SM-1, which is favorable to get a large open-circuit voltage of PSCs. Meanwhile, obvious blue-shifted absorption spectra, large amounts of charge transfer, and better solubility are also obtained for the new HTMs. Unhappily, the hole mobilities of SM-2 and SM-3 are slightly lower than that of SM-1 due to the hard intermolecular orbital overlap. To improve the hole mobility, the further structural tailoring of the acceptor group is also underway and will be reported in due course. By considering the various elements, SM-3 is believed to be a potential efficient HTM, and some useful clues are provided in this work as a theoretical foundation for further experimental synthesis.
