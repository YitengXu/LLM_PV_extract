    , Accepted 24th December 2021First published on 24th December 2021AbstractLow work-function metal oxides have been widely used as electron transport layers (ETLs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the ubiquitous contact barrier and intrinsic surface defects of such ETLs severely restrained the efficiency and stability of OSCs. Here, a strategy for multi-site coordination was adopted by designing and introducing an anthraquinone derivative (1-DPAQ) to passivate the surface defects of SnO2 ETLs. We find that the modification of 1-DPAQ can optimize the work function and improve the conductivity of the SnO2 layer. Besides, systematic theoretical analysis and characterization studies have revealed that stable coordination interactions exist between SnO2 and 1-DPAQ, filling the oxygen vacancy of SnO2. 1-DPAQ effectively inhibits the charge recombination and improves the charge collection ability simultaneously. In addition to achieving high PCEs of 17.7% and 18.1% for the binary and ternary active layer, the OSC devices based on the SnO2/1-DPAQ composite ETL exhibit significantly improved device stability. This work highlights the working mechanism of multi-site coordination on interface modification and represents a feasible and straightforward method to optimize the properties of metal oxide ETLs for efficient and stable OSCs.

Broader context
As one promising solution to the energy crisis, photovoltaic technology, which can efficiently harvest solar energy and convert it directly into electricity, has been the source of intense research and innovation efforts in the last few decades. Organic solar cells (OSCs) with the possibility of producing flexible, lightweight, and low-cost devices offer a promising look at renewable resources, which have experienced rapid developments in recent years. To meet the urgent requirement towards commercial application, simultaneous improvements in power conversion efficiency and stability are the main pursuits of OSC innovations. Among the varieties of upgrading strategies, interface engineering has been regarded as one of the most critical aspects in the fabrication of stable and highly efficient OSCs. In this work, interfacial modification via multi-site coordination was realized via coating an anthraquinone derivative (1-DPAQ) onto an SnO2 layer. The obtained SnO2/1-DPAQ-based OSC devices demonstrated higher efficiency and better stability than the SnO2-based ones, showing a feasible and efficient strategy for interface engineering of OSCs.

Introduction
Advances in materials science have provided a major breakthrough in organic solar cells (OSCs), dramatically improving their power conversion efficiency (PCE) to the 18% threshold.1–9 The typical structure of an OSC device is composed of a transparent conductive electrode, bulk heterojunction active layer, and metal electrodes. Generally, the active layer will be sandwiched between the hole and the electron transport layer (ETL) to obtain a better ohmic contact with the corresponding electrodes.10–15 In addition, the charge transport layers play a vital role in modulating the work function (WF) and morphology of electrodes, thus promoting the charge extraction and collection process.16–19 High charge mobility and good transmittance guaranteeing light absorption are the two prerequisites for efficient charge transport layers. Besides, low-cost charge transport layers with easy processability and favorable stability are badly needed to meet the criteria for the large-scale manufacturing of OSCs.
Among the varieties of ETL materials, n-type low WF metal oxides, including ZnO, SnO2, and TiO2, etc., have been popularly used in OSCs and other organic electronics, such as perovskite solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes.20–26 Although significant progress has been achieved based on metal oxide ETLs, the intrinsic drawbacks of such materials lead to unsatisfactory performances and stability, which need further improvements. Specifically, due to the “Fermi level pinning effect,” severe charge barriers exist at the interface between the metal oxide ETLs and organic semiconductors, resulting in inefficient charge transfer and accumulation.26,27 Meanwhile, the oxygen vacancies and interstitials are the main defects of the metal oxide surface, which will act as electronic trap states, inducing severe trap-assisted charge recombination along with the “light-soaking” phenomenon.23,28–31 Besides, the formation of vacancies as oxygen absorption centers gives rise to severe degradation in device stability. Accordingly, high-temperature annealing treatments on the metal oxide films are usually required for obtaining a high-quality surface with fewer defects.32 However, such a processing condition costs extra energy and restrains its application on flexible plastic substrates.33 Thus, dedicated efforts have been applied to tackle these issues, among which composing bilayer ETLs via introduction of polymers, fullerene or quantum dots onto the metal oxide layer is one of the most simple and effective ways.34–37 However, up to now, the selection and application of modified layers on metal oxide ETLs have progressed via a trial-and-error approach with a limited understanding of the underlying working mechanism. In addition, these reported modified layers suffer from the complex-synthesis-resulted high cost and batch-to-batch polymeric variations.38–42 Consequently, the realization of high-performance and stable OSCs based on cost-effective metal oxide ETLs is still challenging due to the lack of suitable modified materials and distinct working mechanisms.
The use of anthraquinone derivatives exhibiting good electron acceptability and easily tunable properties through chemical modifications has been spread to different fields, such as pharmacology, dyes, sensors, and capacitors43,44 but the feasibility of anthraquinones as interface modification materials in OSCs has been rarely studied. In this study, a water/alcohol soluble and low-cost anthraquinone derivative, 1-((3-(dimethylamino)propyl)amino)anthracene-9,10-dione (1-DPAQ), was designed using multiple coordination sites and was applied as an interface-modified layer for SnO2 to improve the PCE and stability of OSCs. Systematic theoretical analysis and characterization studies revealed the stable coordination conformations between SnO2 and 1-DPAQ via different coordination sites, which could effectively suppress the surface oxygen vacancies of SnO2 for better surface contact. Moreover, the modification of SnO2 by 1-DPAQ could effectively improve the conductivity of the ETL, and reduce the work function and the surface energy of the interface. For the 1-DPAQ/SnO2 composite ETL, the OSC device based on binary and ternary active layers can obtain high PCEs of 17.7% and 18.1%, respectively. Most importantly, due to the restrained surface vacancies and the outward arrangement of hydrophobic groups, the devices based on the 1-DPAQ-modified SnO2 ETL exhibit better storage and light stabilities than the control device.
Results and discussion
The chemical structure of the 1-DPAQ and the crystal lattice structure of rutile SnO2 are shown in Fig. 1a. 1-DPAQ can be easily synthesized in a two-step synthetic route from some low-cost materials, which is more convenient than the synthesis of polymeric or fullerene materials. The detailed synthesis routes are presented in the Supporting Information. The composite ETL was prepared by coating an ultra-thin layer of 1-DPAQ onto the SnO2 films. We examined the optical properties of the composite ETL compared with the pristine ones. As exhibited in Fig. 1b, 1-DPAQ has the primary absorption in the wavelength range from 450 to 600 nm. The SnO2/1-DPAQ composite ETL shows high transmittance in the whole visible region due to the ultra-thin thickness of the 1-DPAQ layer. Then, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out to determine the WF of SnO2, 1-DPAQ, and the composite ETL (Fig. 1c). The second electron cutoff edges (Ecutoff) of the three ETLs are 16.86, 17.43, and 17.05 eV, respectively. Calculated from the difference between hν and Ecutoff, the WFs of SnO2 and 1-DPAQ layers are 4.36 and 3.79 eV, respectively. After being modified by 1-DPAQ, the WF of the composite ETL is effectively reduced to 4.17 eV. The lower WF can decrease the energy barrier between the active layer and the cathode electrode, forming a better energy-level alignment at the cathode interface, which is beneficial for charge transmission and extraction.

(d–g) Optimized configurations of 1-DPAQ binding on SnO2via different coordination sites, including α-O, β-O, α-N, and β-N. 
According to the chemical structure of 1-DPAQ, four possible coordination sites, including α-O, β-O, α-N, and β-N, have the potentials to form interface coordination with the SnO2 layer. To explore the most thermodynamically stable configuration between 1-DPAQ and SnO2, theoretical calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) based on density functional theory (Fig. 1d–g).45 It can be found that the α-O site of 1-DPAQ cannot coordinate with SnO2 due to the large steric hindrance of the side chains. Both β-O and α-N can form thermally stable coordination structures with Sn atoms on the surface of SnO2, leaving large combination energies of −32.34 and −32.38 kcal mol−1, respectively. The obtained energies verified that the formation of such coordination structure is a spontaneous exothermic process. The optimal vertical interlayer distance between 1-DPAQ and SnO2 in the β-O coordinated structure is 2.10 Å, smaller than that in the α-N coordinated structure (2.49 Å). Notably, double-coordination with different Sn atoms formed by β-N and β-O is achieved in the optimized configurations. It delivers a slightly larger combination energy of −33.76 kcal mol−1 with the optimal vertical interlayer distance of 2.53 and 2.41 Å, respectively, suggesting the formation of a more stable configuration. The theoretical simulation results indicate that stable coordination conformations exist between SnO2 and 1-DPAQ via different coordination sites, which can effectively suppress the surface oxygen vacancies of SnO2, expectedly to improve the efficiency and stability of the OSC devices.
Next, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to verify the coordination effect between 1-DPAQ and SnO2. Fig. 2a shows the XPS full spectrum of SnO2 and SnO2/1-DPAQ. The inset is the core level spectrum of N 1s. Compared with the SnO2 film, N 1s peak at 400.1 eV in the XPS spectrum of SnO2/1-DPAQ verified the adherence of 1-DPAQ on the SnO2 surface. As exhibited in Fig. 2b, the XPS spectrum of the core level of Sn is extracted to analyze the chemical shift of the Sn atom in SnO2 and SnO2/1-DPAQ films. Compared with the pristine SnO2 film, the Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 peaks of the SnO2/1-DPAQ film located at 495.8 and 487.4 eV, which were shifted to the low binding energy direction by 0.70 eV. It can be attributed to the Sn–N bonds replacing part of the Sn-O bonds due to the lower electronegativity of the N compared to the O atom. For further verification, methanol was used to soak the SnO2/1-DPAQ film, which can better dissolve 1-DPAQ rather than SnO2. After being soaked in methanol for 30 s, the Sn 3d peak of SnO2/1-DPAQ film has a slight left shift due to the partial dissolution of 1-DPAQ in methanol. However, it is still biased towards the low binding energy direction than that of the pristine SnO2 film. It indicates the compact combination between 1-DPAQ and SnO2, which is consistent with the results obtained from the theoretical calculations. Meanwhile, we measured the absorption spectra of the pristine 1-DPAQ film and the composite SnO2/1-DPAQ film before and after rinsing with chloroform (CF) to examine the solvent resistance of ETL for the process of active layer spin-coating (Fig. S1, ESI†). It can be found that although 1-DPAQ has poor solvent resistance for CF rinsing, the strong coordination effect between SnO2/1-DPAQ makes it resistant to CF rinsing, becoming an adequate ETL for inverted OSCs.

(c) WCA and diiodomethane contact angle (DCA) of the corresponding films. (d) AFM height images of SnO2, 1-DPAQ and SnO2/1-DPAQ films. 
Subsequently, we tested the contact angles of water and diiodomethane on the SnO2, 1-DPAQ, SnO2/1-DPAQ, and the methanol-soaked SnO2/1-DPAQ films. As shown in Fig. 2c, the water contact angles (WCA) of SnO2 and 1-DPAQ are 8.2° and 8.6°, respectively. After being coated with 1-DPAQ, the WCA of the composite ETL is significantly enhanced to 35.7°, indicating that SnO2 coordinates with the hydrophilic groups in the lower interface and the hydrophobic ends of 1-DPAQ are aligned upward on the top surface. This structure will help the interface layer to resist the invasion of moisture for better stability. Notably, the WCA of SnO2/1-DPAQ film remained 33.9° after being soaked in methanol, verifying the strong coordination interaction between 1-DPAQ and SnO2. As listed in Table 1, the surface free energy (γs) of the active and interface materials have been calculated from the contact angle results according to the Owens–Wendt method.46 The calculated γs of SnO2 and 1-DPAQ are 73.97 and 75.20 mN m−1, respectively, and the introduction of 1-DPAQ on SnO2 can effectively reduce the γs to 62.43 mN m−1. The γs of the polymer donor materials (PM6) was 34.61 mN m−1 (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI†), which was smaller than that of the non-fullerene acceptor BTP-eC9 (37.17 mN m−1). The reduced γs of the SnO2/1-DPAQ composite ETL makes the acceptors prefer to aggregate at the ETL/BHJ interface, contributing to a favorable vertical phase separation structure and thus better charge transport and collection.47 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were then performed to characterize the surface morphology of different ETLs (Fig. 2d). Compared with the pristine SnO2 film, a smoother surface presents in the SnO2/1-DPAQ composite film with an effectively reduced root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of 2.50 nm, which intuitively validates the defect-filling effect of 1-DPAQ on the SnO2 surface.

The conductivities of SnO2, 1-DPAQ and SnO2/1-DPAQ films were estimated by measuring the current–voltage (I-V) curves of the ITO/ETL/Al devices in the dark.48–50 The conductivity of the bare SnO2 is 1.81 × 10−3 S m−1, and that of 1-DPAQ is 1.87 × 10−4 S m−1 (Fig. S3, ESI†). Benefitting from the defect filling effect of 1-DPAQ, the I–V curve of the device based on the SnO2/1-DPAQ composite ETL shows a typical diode characteristic, giving an improved conductivity of 2.12 × 10−3 S m−1, higher than that of the SnO2. Such improved charge transport properties will be beneficial to obtain reduced charge recombination at the interface.
Keeping in mind that 1-DPAQ can effectively modify the surface defects of SnO2, inverted OSCs based on PM6:BTP-e-C9 using different ETLs were fabricated and the chemical structures of active layer materials are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The energy level diagram of the materials used in the device fabrication is presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The thickness of the SnO2/1-DPAQ composite film was optimized by adjusting the concentration of 1-DPAQ in methanol (Fig. S6, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are exhibited in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The OSC device with SnO2 as the ETL showed a short-circuit current (JSC) of 25.9 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.83 V, and a filling factor (FF) of 72.4%, delivering a moderate PCE of 15.6%. The 1-DPAQ-based devices demonstrated a poor PCE of 10.0% due to the intrinsic absorption and low conductivity of 1-DPAQ. Compared with SnO2-based devices, the PCE of devices based on SnO2/1-DPAQ composite ETL is significantly improved to 17.7%, with a higher JSC of 26.6 mA cm−2 and an enhanced FF value of 78.3%. Due to the reduced WF of the composite ETL, which is closer to that of BTP-eC9, enabling smooth electron transport from the acceptor to the cathode side with fewer energy barriers and recombination losses, the SnO2/1-DPAQ-based device exhibited an improved VOC of 0.85 V. Besides, the device based on the as-cast composite ETLs delivered a comparable PCE of 17.4% with the annealed one, making it a competitive candidate ETL for flexible devices (Fig. S7, ESI†). For further performance improvement, a conjugated polymer with a deep-lying HOMO level (PB2F) was introduced into the active layer.51 The application of SnO2/1-DPAQ composite ETL in ternary devices based on PM6:PB2F:BTP-eC9 (0.8:0.2:1.2) yielded a high PCE of 18.1%. Fig. 3b and Fig. S8 (ESI†) displayed the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices based on different ETLs and the ternary device, respectively. The SnO2/1-DPAQ-based device delivered the highest integrated current of 26.1 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the J–V curves measured results.

The J–V curves of the inverted OSCs based on SnO2 and SnO2/1-DPAQ composite ETLs measured in the dark are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Compared with the OSCs based on bare SnO2 the SnO2/1-DPAQ-based devices show a much smaller leakage current under a reverse bias voltage with a larger rectification ratio, indicating that the introduction of 1-DPAQ can effectively optimize the charge injection process. According to eqn (S2) in ESI,† the inverted OSC based on SnO2/1-DPAQ composite ETL has a higher VOC than that based on SnO2 only. Then we investigated the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties of the devices based on different ETLs by measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves (Fig. 3c). Jph is calculated by Jph = Jlight − Jdark, where Jlight is the current density under light and Jdark is the current density in the dark. Veff is defined as V0 − Vapply, where V0 is the applied voltage when Jlight equal to Jdark, and Vapply is the applied voltage. We calculated the exciton dissociation probability by Pdiss = JSC/Jsat, which is the ratio of the number of excitons that can be dissociated to the number of excitons that reach the interface under zero bias (short-circuit state). The Pdiss of the inverted OSC based on SnO2/1-DPAQ is 93.4%, which is obviously higher than that of bare SnO2 with 90.5%, demonstrating that a more effective exciton dissociation and charge collection process occur in the OSC with SnO2/1-DPAQ as the ETL. As shown in Fig. 3d, we explored the dependence of VOC on the light intensity to analyze the monomolecular/bimolecular recombination for these devices. The slope of the curve can be used to judge the dominant recombination mechanism, which will be kBT/q if the bimolecular recombination is dominant in the carrier dynamics. In contrast, the slope close to 2kBT/q indicates that trap-assisted recombination is the dominant mechanism. The slope of the SnO2/1-DPAQ device is 1.19 kBT/q, which is smaller than the SnO2 (1.29 kBT/q) and 1-DPAQ (1.44 kBT/q) devices. This indicates that the trap-assisted recombination of the inverted OSC based on SnO2/1-DPAQ is suppressed, which is consistent with the aforementioned reduction of J0, accounting for the improvement of JSC and FF. Next, we conducted further research on the inhibition of recombination through the light intensity dependence curve of JSC (Fig. 3e). As we all know, the value of JSC has a power-law dependence on Plight (i.e. JSC ∝ Pαlight, where Plight is the light intensity and α is the exponential factor). For the devices with SnO2 and SnO2/1-DPAQ composite ETLs, similar values of α (0.97 and 0.98) indicate that the insertion of the 1-DPAQ layer will slightly suppress the bimolecular recombination. According to the above analysis, it can be concluded that the modification of 1-DPAQ on SnO2 can effectively promote exciton dissociation and play a key role in inhibiting charge recombination for improved photovoltaic performances. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the interfacial resistances of the devices (Fig. 3f). A bias voltage equal to VOC was applied so that the total current vanished and the data were fitted by an equivalent-circuit model. The surface resistance of the devices with SnO2 and SnO2/1-DPAQ was determined to 67.59 and 41.29 Ω, respectively, indicating the depressed interfacial charge recombination and improved charge extraction in the SnO2/1-DPAQ-based OSCs.
Finally, we compared the storage stability and light stability of inverted OSCs based on SnO2 and SnO2/1-DPAQ. The unpackaged devices were stored for about 2000 h in a N2-filled glovebox, and the PCEs were measured irregularly during this period (Fig. 4a). Due to the oxygen deposition at intrinsic oxygen vacancies of SnO2,52 the PCE of the SnO2-based device dropped sharply, which reduced to 82.2% of its initial value after storage for 2000 h. In contrast, the PCE of the OSC based on SnO2/1-DPAQ showed a slow loss during storage, and it could still maintain 97.9% of the original value after storage for 2000 h. We also tested the light stability of the two devices under a continuous illumination of 370 h (Fig. 4b). The PCE of the SnO2/1-DPAQ-based device maintained 59.3% of the initial PCE, while the SnO2-based device accounted for only 13.7% of the initial PCE. The charge recombination kinetics in the degradation process was performed and compared with that of the initial devices (Fig. S10, ESI†). The data summary is provided in Table S2 (ESI†). Compared to the initial devices, the VOC slope of the aged SnO2-based device increased from 1.27 to 1.40 kBT/q, indicating the occurrence of more severe trap-assisted recombination in the aged devices. In contrast, the difference between the initial and aged devices based on the composite ETL is smaller, from 1.19 to 1.21 kBT/q. Such results suggest that compared with the SnO2-based devices, trap-assisted recombination was effectively suppressed in the aged devices based on the SnO2-1DPAQ composite ETL. These results confirmed that the insertion of the 1-DPAQ layer filled the oxygen vacancies on the surface of SnO2, effectively improving the device stability. Furthermore, the molecular arrangement of 1-DPAQ with hydrophobic groups outward also prevented moisture erosion on the interface between ITO and the above active layer. The improved stability 1-DPAQ-modified ETL will be beneficial for the OSC commercial application to go one step further.

Conclusions
To sum up, 1-DPAQ with a simple chemical structure of multiple coordination sites was designed and applied as a modified layer of SnO2 to simultaneously improve the stability and efficiency of OSCs. Theoretical calculations suggest that stable coordination conformations exist between the multi-sites of 1-DPAQ and SnO2 surfaces, which can effectively reduce the defect-induced charge recombination. Meanwhile, the modification of 1-DPAQ on the SnO2 layer leads to high conductivity and better energy level alignment simultaneously. The optimal OSC based on SnO2/1-DPAQ composite ETL showed a higher PCE of 17.7% than the control ones, and the ternary devices delivered a high PCE of 18.1%. Due to the reduction of oxygen absorption centers and the outward arrangement of hydrophobic groups, the SnO2/1-DPAQ-based devices demonstrated superior stability. Besides, the insertion of 1-DPAQ could decrease the annealing temperature of ETL even to room temperature, making it a good candidate for the application of flexible devices in the future. Our work not only provides a cost-effective approach to modify SnO2 for simultaneous enhancement in the OSC efficiency and stability but also sheds light on the material design rules and working mechanism of the interface modification on metal oxide ETLs.

Broader context
As one promising solution to the energy crisis, photovoltaic technology, which can efficiently harvest solar energy and convert it directly into electricity, has been the source of intense research and innovation efforts in the last few decades. Organic solar cells (OSCs) with the possibility of producing flexible, lightweight, and low-cost devices offer a promising look at renewable resources, which have experienced rapid developments in recent years. To meet the urgent requirement towards commercial application, simultaneous improvements in power conversion efficiency and stability are the main pursuits of OSC innovations. Among the varieties of upgrading strategies, interface engineering has been regarded as one of the most critical aspects in the fabrication of stable and highly efficient OSCs. In this work, interfacial modification via multi-site coordination was realized via coating an anthraquinone derivative (1-DPAQ) onto an SnO2 layer. The obtained SnO2/1-DPAQ-based OSC devices demonstrated higher efficiency and better stability than the SnO2-based ones, showing a feasible and efficient strategy for interface engineering of OSCs.
