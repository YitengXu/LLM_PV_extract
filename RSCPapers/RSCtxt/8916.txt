    , Accepted 30th March 2021First published on 30th March 2021AbstractOrganic semiconductors (OSs) are emerging candidates as light-harvesting materials in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells for direct solar-to-chemical conversion. Despite significant recent progress with OS-based photocathodes, the development of efficient and stable OS-based photoanodes remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate the concept of an in situ formed covalent polymer network (CPN) in a hybrid CPN:SnO2 bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) to increase the photocurrent density (Jph) and stability of OS-based photoanodes for PEC splitting of hydroiodic acid (HI). Our results indicate that the CPN:SnO2 BHJ overcomes the limited exciton diffusion length in OSs and provides a Jph improvement of more than three orders of magnitude compared to equivalent bilayer heterojunctions. Furthermore, insight into the operation of the hybrid BHJ in direct contact with aqueous electrolyte is gained with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and PEC measurements under varying pH. With 1 M HI (pH 0) as the electrolyte, an optimized CPN:SnO2 photoanode without catalyst or protection layer delivers a Jph of 3.3 mA cm−2 at the thermodynamic potential of iodide oxidation (+0.54 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode) and a continuous operation for 27 h (Jph loss of 12%), representing a new benchmark for OS photoanodes for solar-to-chemical conversion. Complete HI splitting is further demonstrated in an all-OS photocathode/photoanode PEC cell to produce H2 and I3− from simulated sunlight without applied bias.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar-to-chemical conversion is a promising approach to directly convert power from the sun into the chemical energy of molecular bonds (e.g. water splitting to H2 and O2), effectively storing solar energy as renewable chemical fuels and paving the way for a sustainable low-carbon economy. The definitive characteristic of a PEC cell is a direct semiconductor–electrolyte junction, which offers increased simplicity over competing approaches (e.g. photovoltaic plus electrolysers). However, the development of high-performance and inexpensive semiconductor photoelectrodes that can also withstand the relatively harsh PEC operation conditions stands out as the main challenge in this field. Organic semiconductors (OSs) consist of earth-abundant elements, offer tunable optoelectronic properties, and have achieved excellent solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency in organic photovoltaics. In this context, there is a rapidly-growing interest to apply OSs in PEC-based approaches. However, their robustness remains a critical point to address. Moreover, given the sluggish nature of the water oxidation reaction, alternative approaches including HI splitting to produce H2 and I3− are also gaining increased attention for practical application.

Introduction
While photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar fuel production is a promising approach to enable the chemical storage of renewable solar energy, the identification of light-harvesting semiconducting materials that can offer suitable performance at low cost remains a current challenge.1,2 As an alternative to the traditionally-used inorganic semiconductors (e.g. silicon,3 III–Vs,4 chalcogenides5 and metal oxides6), organic semiconductors (OSs) are attracting increasing attention as photoactive materials in PEC solar energy conversion, given their earth abundance, molecularly-tunable optoelectronic properties, ease of processing, and success in photovoltaic devices.7–9 A variety of different OS structures,10 such as conjugated polymers,11–14 small molecules,15 covalent organic frameworks,16,17 and donor:acceptor bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OS blends18–21 have been applied as photocathodes for solar-driven water reduction (to produce H2) or CO2 reduction (to afford CO or alcohols). Furthermore, significant progress towards enhancing solar photocurrent density, Jph, to a state-of-the-art of ∼10 mA cm−2 as well as extending operational stability has been achieved.20
In contrast and despite the vital necessity of photoanodes in PEC devices to drive a corresponding oxidation reaction, the development of OS-based photoanodes falls far behind. While a number of OS-based photoanodes22–30 have been reported for the prototypical anodic reaction (oxidizing water to produce O2), the observed Jph has nevertheless been limited to only hundreds of μA cm−2 with stabilities on the order of tens of minutes. Dye-sensitized (DS) photoanodes, which use a monolayer of molecular light absorber (e.g. an OS dye31) adsorbed on a mesoporous inorganic semiconductor (e.g. TiO2), have demonstrated slightly higher Jph (on the order of ∼1 mA cm−2).32 Nevertheless, the demonstration of long-term durability using these DS photoanodes with relatively high Jph has also been unsuccessful to date.33
Even by replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with alternative oxidation reactions that possess more favorable kinetics while also producing value-added products (a trend recently established to improve the efficiency and economic attractiveness of solar H2 production34–39), OS-based photoanodes do not perform significantly better. Indeed, demonstrations of the solar-driven oxidation of hydrazine40,41 and thiols42–44 with OS-based photoanodes gave low Jph of the same order of magnitude as for the OER, indicating that developing new strategies to realize high-performance OS-based photoanodes remains an urgent task to validate the feasibility of OS-based PEC solar-to-chemical conversion.
A poor connection between the organic light-harvesting material and the typically-used transparent conductive inorganic substrate (e.g. TiO2 or F-doped SnO2) has been recently identified as an important origin of the poor performance of OS-based photoanodes that leads to the desorption of dyes or delamination of OS films under the harsh oxidation conditions.27,45 Herein we address this critical issue by employing an in situ formed covalent polymer network (CPN). Indeed, while CPNs are known to possess a superior robustness among various types of OSs,46 their poor processability limits their application in thin-film devices unless appropriate strategies are employed like post-monomer-deposition networking reactions.47 We further establish that the formation of a hybrid BHJ between the CPN and SnO2 nanoparticles is a promising strategy to afford high-performance and robust photoanodes using an important alternative oxidation reaction—namely the PEC oxidation of hydroiodic acid (HI)—as a target reaction as this represents one of the most important alternatives to PEC water oxidation.48,49 Specifically, while both H2O and HI splitting produce H2 at the photocathode, HI oxidation at the photoanode is a two-electron transfer process forming triiodide, which is kinetically favorable compared to the four-electron OER. Moreover, triiodide is easily isolated as iodine which possesses a higher economic value compared to O2 since it can be used in various energy and hygiene industries.50 Indeed, the photoelectrochemical or photocatalytic splitting of HI into H2 and I3− has recently been considered with methylammonium lead iodide,50–54 transition metal dichalcogenides,55 and silicon.56–58 However, despite these demonstrations and the merits of PEC-driven iodine production over oxygen evolution, it remains a challenge to develop robust, efficient, inexpensive and scalable semiconductor photoelectrodes to implement solar-driven HI splitting due to the corrosiveness of HI and the intrinsic instability of most inorganic semiconductors under strongly acidic conditions, especially for the anodic reaction. Given the established stability of OSs in acidic electrolyte,20 and the performance of our OS-based photoanode demonstrated herein, we finally combine our CPN photoanode with an OS-based photocathode to demonstrate unassisted solar-driven HI splitting with an all-OS based PEC cell for the first time.
Results and discussions
A schematic of the CPN:SnO2 BHJ photoanode is shown in Fig. 1a in the PEC cell configuration used for initial photoanode development for HI splitting into H2 and I3− with Pt as cathode under applied bias. F-Doped SnO2 (FTO) coated glass was used as a substrate for the photoanode active layer, which was prepared by simple solution-based processing techniques. The light harvesting OS material, namely the CPN, was formed by an in situ thermal azide–alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) between an alkyne functionalized triazine (Triazine-TA) and an azide containing perylene diimide (PDI-DA),47 as shown schematically in Fig. 1b. The in situ TAAC strategy was employed since this approach has been previously demonstrated to overcome the challenge of poor CPN processability by allowing the deposition of soluble monomers by simple spin-coating followed by a catalyst-free networking reaction.

Moreover, the perylene diimide chromophore was chosen since its derivatives are well-known for light harvesting and have been reported as photoactive materials for PEC water oxidation.25 The resulting CPN film is known to not only possess an excellent resistance to various solvents, but also to serve as a functional optoelectronic material (e.g. as an electron acceptor in organic solar cells).47 In initial PEC investigations, a planar photoanode prepared by forming a CPN layer directly on flat FTO substrates afforded only a negligible Jph (∼1 μA cm−2) for PEC iodide oxidation at an applied bias of +0.54 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) in 1 M I− electrolyte (pH 1) under standard simulated 1 sun illumination (see Fig. S1, ESI†). This poor performance is likely due to the short exciton diffusion length and relatively poor charge carrier mobility in the CPN, as the Jph decreases with increasing CPN thickness (Fig. S1, ESI†).
With the intent to enhance exciton dissociation and extract more free charge carriers from the photoactive CPN, a mixture of the Triazine-TA and PDI-DA monomers was infiltrated into a mesoporous SnO2 (m-SnO2) film on FTO prepared using SnO2 nanoparticles in the 5–10 nm size range (see Fig. S2, ESI,† and full details in the Experimental methods section), aiming toward the formation of a hybrid CPN:SnO2 BHJ after carrying out the TAAC networking reaction. SnO2 was chosen since, given its energy band positions relative to the CPN as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), a type II heterojunction is expected. Such an energy alignment should facilitate exciton dissociation at the CPN/SnO2 interface. The ability of the Triazine-TA and PDI-DA monomers to infiltrate the m-SnO2 can be presumed from the larger particle size of the SnO2 nanoparticles employed compared to the molecular size of Triazine-TA and PDI-DA, which is below 2 nm (as simulated by density functional theory, see Fig. S4, ESI†) implying both monomers could infiltrate into the pores of the mesoporous SnO2. Indeed, cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of a ∼300 nm thick m-SnO2 film that was subjected to three monomer infiltration/TAAC networking reaction cycles is shown in Fig. 2a. No obvious CPN layer is observed on the top of m-SnO2 layer in this case, however, the same 3× monomer deposition/TAAC networking reaction cycles on a planar FTO substrate affords a clearly detectable CPN layer with a thickness of ∼120 nm (Fig. S5, ESI†).

The scale bar of the images is 500 nm. (c) HAADF-STEM image and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping (carbon, tin, nitrogen and oxygen) of CPN:SnO2 BHJ. The scale bar of the images is 100 nm. (d) Morphological characterization of SnO2, CPN:SnO2 and CPN (coated on FTO). Height topography, KPFM potential image, and contact potential difference (VCPD) are shown in the top, middle and bottom panel, respectively. All the measurements were performed under dark ambient condition. The scale bar of the images is 500 nm. 
To better understand the morphology of the of the CPN-infiltrated m-SnO2 films, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy of the film shown in Fig. 2a was performed. The resulting EDX elemental maps of carbon, tin, silicon and oxygen (Fig. 2b), show carbon corresponding to the CPN overlapping with the tin from the m-SnO2, indicating CPN is well blended with the SnO2 nanoparticles. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was also performed on a CPN:SnO2 film (prepared with 1× monomer deposition/TAAC, delaminated from the substrate, and transferred to a TEM grid) to further support the intimate mixing of the CPN and SnO2 nanoparticles. Fig. 2c shows the high angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM of CPN:SnO2 BHJ and corresponding elemental maps by EDX. The signals from carbon and nitrogen, corresponding to the CPN, overlap considerably with tin through the entire image at the scale of hundreds of nm demonstrating a homogeneous mixture of the CPN and SnO2. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) further establish the formation of a hybrid organic–inorganic BHJ as shown in Fig. 2d. Relative AFM height images (top images, Fig. 2d) show that a 1× monomer deposition/TAAC cycle on m-SnO2 does not significantly change the surface morphology and roughness, further supporting the infiltration of CPN monomers in SnO2 nanoparticles. We note that a bare FTO substrate shows a roughness of 14 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†) while the CPN coating leads to a decreased roughness of 7 nm.
Surface potential maps by KPFM (middle images in Fig. 2d) give indication of the electronic condition of the different films examined by AFM. It can be seen that the m-SnO2 and CPN exhibit homogeneous surface potentials, as evidenced by the narrow distribution in contact potential difference, VCPD, over each KPFM image (shown in Fig. 2d bottom), however the average VCPD is significantly different comparing these cases. Indeed, the average VCPD for the pure m-SnO2 and pure CPN are −0.40 V and +0.25 V, respectively. Interestingly, the KPFM map of the CPN:SnO2 BHJ shows a similarly narrow distribution in VCPD, however the average value is +0.09 V, which is between the VCPD values of SnO2 nanoparticles and CPN. We note that the VCPD value determined by KPFM is given by (Ef − φtip)/e, where Ef and φtip represent the Fermi level of the semiconductor film and the work function of the tip, respectively, and e is the charge of an electron. Since the same tip was used for all KPFM measurements, the intermediate average VCPD of the CPN:SnO2 strongly suggests the equilibration of the film Fermi level over the length scale measured, which is expected for the formation of an intimately mixed BHJ.59
Finally, the success of the monomer networking reaction inside the SnO2 nanoparticle film was verified by demonstrating the solvent resistance of CPN:SnO2 BHJ after washing in the monomer processing solvent (chloroform). UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. S7, ESI†) shows only a minor change in the light absorption of the film after washing. This observed solvent resistance of the CPN:SnO2 BHJ together with the above characterization suggests an important difference between the CPN:SnO2 BHJ and the commonly-reported DS photoelectrode approach.60 In addition, we note that our organic light absorber is infiltrated into the SnO2 nanoparticle film via a simple spin-coating technique rather than a chemical adsorption step, giving an estimated equivalent CPN thickness of ∼100 nm for a 450 nm m-SnO2 layer using a single deposition cycle (based on UV-Vis measurements). The established morphology, the networking reaction offering robustness, and the ability to control the CPN loading by changing the number of deposition/TAAC cycles indicate significant differences compared to the monolayer dye adsorption used in DS photoelectrodes or single-layer OS-based photoanodes. Moreover, we note that our CPN:SnO2 BHJ photoanodes are used with the photoactive layer in direct contact with aqueous electrolyte, as described below, setting it apart from other reports with organic semiconductors that employ complex encapsulation techniques18,19,21,61 and are better characterized as buried-junction devices.
With the established morphology of the CPN:SnO2 BHJ photoanodes we next subjected them to PEC characterization for I− oxidation in aqueous 1 M I− electrolyte (pH 1) to determine the optimum active layer thickness. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves under intermittent simulated 1 sun illumination were collected for a series of photoanodes with various thickness as shown in Fig. 3a. By increasing the thickness of the BHJ from 480 nm to 1.77 μm (see SEM images in Fig. S8 for thickness characterization, ESI†), the observed Jph increases significantly. This enhancement is ascribed to an increased loading of CPN when thicker m-SnO2 films are used, leading to increased light absorption (as shown by UV-vis spectra in Fig. S9, ESI†). Interestingly, a further increase of the BHJ layer thickness to 2.40 μm does not increase Jph significantly, despite a considerable increase in light absorption, which is likely attributed to a more pronounced charge recombination, as the charge transport distance for both carriers is increased. Moreover, an increase in dark current is also observed when a thicker BHJ is used, which is likely due to an increased contact between bare SnO2 and the electrolyte. Indeed, increasing the CPN loading while keeping the same BHJ thickness showed an important effect on the dark current and Jph as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). While coating a 480 nm thick BHJ layer with 1× or 2× of the monomer deposition/TAAC cycles gave photoanodes with similar Jph as expected for a photocurrent limited by exciton transport to the CPN/SnO2 interface, further coating (3×) gave a diminished photocurrent and dark current consistent with a limitation of poor free hole transport through the organic semiconductor, and a reduced direct contact of the oxide with the electrolyte.

(b) LSV scans of CPN:SnO2 photoanode with 1.77 μm SnO2 nanoparticle film at different pH. (c) Open circuit potentials under dark and illumination at each pH. 
The best performing CPN:SnO2 BHJ photoanode (i.e. prepared using 1× CPN coating on a 1.77 μm m-SnO2 film) offers a Jph of 2.1 mA cm−2 at the thermodynamic potential for I− oxidation, +0.54 V vs. NHE, (and over 3.5 mA cm−2 at +0.74 V vs. NHE), which is three orders of magnitude greater than a planar CPN photoanode prepared on FTO (Fig. S1, ESI†). We note that a m-SnO2 nanoparticle film without CPN shows a negligible photo-response under the same conditions (Fig. S11, ESI†) and that a control photoanode based on a planar sol–gel processed SnO2 coated with CPN (i.e. a bilayer heterojunction device) exhibits a low Jph (∼0.02 μA cm−2, Fig. S12, ESI†), similar to the planar FTO substrate. Thus the enhanced dissociation of CPN excitons and a reduced transport distance for dissociated holes, due to the morphology of the CPN:SnO2 BHJ, are the critical factors affording the improved performance.
It should be emphasized that the formation of the CPN via the TAAC reaction is critical to the performance and stability of the photoanodes. Indeed, BHJ photoanodes with and without the thermal treatment to form robust covalent network are compared in Fig. S13 (ESI†). While the monomer film does deliver a Jph of 0.76 mA cm−2 at +0.54 V vs. NHE, a larger dark current is observed likely due to the exposure of the SnO2 to the electrolyte (Fig. S13a, ESI†). Moreover, the stability under constant operation at +0.75 V vs. NHE shows a drastic increase in the dark current and a 30% reduction of Jph over 2 h, implying the detachment of monomers from the m-SnO2. In contrast, after forming the CPN, an excellent stability under 2 h continuous operation is observed without an obvious Jph decrease or dark current increase (Fig. S13b, ESI†).
Further insight into the organic–inorganic BHJ CPN:SnO2 photoanode is obtained by investigating the PEC performance of our CPN:SnO2 BHJ photoanodes in 1 M I− electrolyte with varying pH. While the robustness of the CPN:SnO2 active layer is further demonstrated by Jph stability at pH 7 and pH 12 under constant operation for 2 h (Fig. S14, ESI†), the pH has a significant effect on the Jph as shown by the different LSV behaviors (Fig. 3b). At pH 7 and pH 12, the Jph of the best-performing CPN:SnO2 photoanode is only 0.57 mA cm−2 and 0.07 mA cm−2 at +0.54 V vs. NHE, respectively, for 1 M I− oxidation. These relatively smaller Jph values are despite a favorable shift in the photocurrent onset potential, which becomes more negative with increasing pH indicating an increased photovoltage. We note that this inverse relationship between Jph and photovoltage when changing electrolyte pH is very reproducible and independent with varying BHJ thickness. As shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), a 480 nm thick CPN:SnO2 photoanode displays the same trend. Quantifying the photovoltage via open circuit potential measurements (Fig. 3c) further verifies this behavior as the photovoltage is increased from 79 mV at pH 1 to 282 mV at pH 12.
Since uncovering the origin of the pH effect is important for understanding the operation of hybrid oxide/organic semiconductor photoanodes for I− oxidation in general, further investigations were performed. It is known that I− oxidation mainly produces I3− in acidic and near-neutral electrolyte, and IO3− in basic media. In contrast to water oxidation where the thermodynamic potential (relative to the NHE) and the reaction kinetics change with pH, oxidizing I− to I3− involves no proton transfer, thus these effects can be excluded when I3− is the product. To show support for this claim, polarization curves were obtained for the (dark) electrochemical I− oxidation by a blank FTO substrate with pH ranging from 1 to 12 (see LSV curves, Fig. S16, ESI†). While a slightly larger overpotential is observed at pH 12, which is due to a more complex I− oxidation process when pH > 10,62 the dark LSV curves at lower pH from 1 to 9 are all almost identical. Therefore, the opposite trend between Jph and photovoltage with increasing electrolyte pH is likely to originate from changes of the optoelectronic properties of the hybrid CPN:SnO2 BHJ photoanode. Indeed, the electron energy bands of inorganic oxide semiconductors typically show a Nernstian shift with varying electrolyte pH (due to the dynamic equilibrium of H+ and OH− adsorption/desorption at the interface),63–65 while the energy levels of organic semiconductors typically remain unchanged.22 Thus we hypothesize that the behavior of our CPN:SnO2 photoanode originates from a relative energy band offset change with different pH. To support this, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of m-SnO2 and planar CPN films were performed in I− electrolytes (1 M) at three different pH (1, 7, and 12). Nyquist plots showed a single semicircle, which was fit to a simple RC circuit model (Fig. S17, ESI†) so that Mott–Schottky (MS) plots could be constructed from the bulk (semiconductor) capacitances. Fig. 4a and b show the MS plots for m-SnO2 and CPN films, respectively. Interestingly, the estimated flat band potential (EFB) of m-SnO2 at pH 1, 7 and 12 is calculated to be +407 mV, +60 mV, and −254 mV vs. NHE, respectively, displaying the expected Nernstian shift.

A schematic energy band diagram of CPN:SnO2 photoanode under flat-band conditions at pH 1, pH 7 and pH 12. 
We note that the MS analysis of the m-SnO2 films gives a relatively high electron donor density of 1.52 × 1020 cm−3, confirming the good electronic conductivity of these films and implying that the depletion width, W, is well within the nanoparticle size (W = 1.2 nm at +0.6 V vs. NHE). In contrast to the Nernstian shift of the SnO2, the CPN film shows a constant EFB of 281 ± 9 mV in the various pH electrolytes. Correspondingly, in low pH electrolyte the estimated potential offset between the CB of SnO2 and the LUMO of CPN is large (e.g. 0.74 V at pH 1), compared to the offset under higher pH (0.39 V at pH 7, 0.09 V at pH 12). Given the increasing dark current observed with increasing m-SnO2 film thickness in our CPN:SnO2 BHJ photoanodes (Fig. 3a) it is reasonable to consider that the surface of the SnO2 continues to have an electronic interaction with the electrolyte in the BHJ case, and since the CB-LUMO offset represents the driving force for exciton dissociation and electron injection from the CPN into the m-SnO2 layer, a larger Jph would thus be expected at lower pH. In contrast, the decreasing offset as pH is increased reasonably leads to a lower driving force for exciton dissociation, lowering the Jph, but also leads to a higher photovoltage measured between the FTO (which is governed by the Fermi level of the SnO2) and the redox potential of the electrolyte. Overall this analysis underlines the importance of designing the CB-LUMO offset for the desired pH in general for hybrid BHJ photoelectrodes, and in this case suggests that the highest Jph should be afforded at lower pH.
Indeed, pure 1 M HI electrolyte at pH 0 was next employed as the electrolyte to validate the performance of our CPN:SnO2 photoanodes under conditions best suited for the overall splitting HI into H2 and I3−. As expected, the LSV curve resulting from a CPN:SnO2 BHJ photoanode based on a 1.77 μm m-SnO2 film exhibits a slightly higher Jph of 3.3 mA cm−2 at +0.54 V vs. NHE as shown in Fig. 5a. The stability of CPN:SnO2 photoanode, as tested under continuous illumination chronoamperometry (CA) at +0.54 V vs. NHE, shows an initial drop in Jph over the first four hours, followed by a gradual decline to 2.1 and 1.8 mA cm−2 after 10 h and 20 h continuous operation, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5b. This Jph decline is partially due to the in situ I2 deposition55 on the electrode surface (as supported by EDX analysis after operation, Fig. S18, ESI†). Indeed, after washing the CPN:SnO2 photoanode with a water:ethanol mixture following a 27 h continuous test, 88% of the initial Jph was recovered as seen by LSV (Fig. 5a) and CA (Fig. 5b) measurements. It is noteworthy that the operational stability of our CPN:SnO2 photoanode represents an unprecedented result among OS-based photoanodes for solar-to-chemical conversion (see Table S1 (ESI†) for relevant literature comparisons), and is even comparable to reported inorganic photoanodes with protecting overlayers for HI splitting.55–58 To confirm the performance of our photoanode, the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured in 1 M HI at +0.54 V vs. NHE. As shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†), the IPCE spectrum shows a good match with the shape of the CPN:SnO2 photoanode UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. S9, ESI†), and the predicted Jph based on the AM 1.5G standard solar spectrum (calculated to be 2.8 mA cm−2) confirms the performance measured under simulated solar irradiation.

The performance of the optimal CPN:SnO2 photoanode for HI oxidation was further investigated by measuring the carrier dynamics using intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). The data and details are discussed in the ESI† (Fig. S20). The mean transit time of photo-generated electrons (τd) and the first-order electron lifetime (τn) are estimated to be 1.61 ms and 20.21 ms, respectively. Thus, the electron diffusion length (Ln) is calculated to be 3.14 μm, larger than the thickness of m-SnO2 (1.77 μm), ensuring effective electron diffusion across the film. It is noteworthy that the resulting Ln of CPN:SnO2 photoanode is larger than the Ln of organic solar cells66 (on the scale of 100 nm), while similar with the Ln of dye-sensitized solar cells67 (on the scale of 10 μm). The result is consistent with the fact that photo-generated electron diffusion occurs in m-SnO2. Meanwhile, we also noticed the performance of CPN:SnO2 photoanode still has a room for further improvement, since the maximum Jph at +0.54 V vs. NHE reaches an estimated 10.6 mA cm−2 according to the UV-vis absorption spectrum and AM 1.5G standard solar spectrum, and the theoretical photovoltage is estimated to be 1.4 V from CB-LUMO offset at pH 0. Reducing the carrier recombination at CPN/SnO2 interface and during carrier transport to achieve better performance is ongoing in our laboratory, and the strategies including SnO2 doping and increasing SnO2 crystallinity are under consideration.
Additional testing was performed to quantify the production of I3− and H2 under continuous operation at +0.54 V vs. NHE (see LSV and CA curves Fig. S21, ESI†) for 11.4 h where an amount of photogenerated electrons equivalent to 261 μmol was collected (based on integration of the CA curve, Fig. S22, ESI†). The I3− formation was measured by UV-vis absorption, and Fig. 5c shows the absorption spectrum of the electrolyte after 11.4 h of operation (with a dilution factor of 50×) compared to a control electrolyte (stored in an ambient environment for the same amount of time as the used electrolyte). The absorption peaks at 350 nm and 275 nm, corresponding to I3− absorption, increase with the accumulation of I3− in the electrolyte corresponding to a total I3− amount evolved of 40.3 μmol (see calibration curve details in Fig. S23, ESI†). Hydrogen gas evolution was monitored during the CA PEC measurement via gas chromatography (see H2 evolution amounts in Fig. S24, ESI†) and the integrated results are presented in Fig. 5d. An average hydrogen evolution rate of 3.11 μmol h−1 was observed giving a total H2 amount of 35.5 μmol over the 11.4 h run. The evolved ratio between I3− and H2 is fairly close to 1:1, as shown in Fig. 5e, consistent with the production of both I3− and H2 through a two-electron process. The relatively low faradaic efficiency for I3− and H2 production (30.9% and 27.2%, respectively) likely originates from the one-compartment cell used, which does not prevent the back reactions (I3− reduction at the cathode and H2 oxidation at the photoanode) from occurring. This issue can be addressed by cell engineering approaches that avoid the direct contact between the I3− and the counter electrode, such as using a flow system or membrane-separated cell.
Finally, to demonstrate the possibility to employ our CPN:SnO2 photoanode in an photocathode/photoanode PEC cell for solar-to-chemical conversion without an applied bias we next sought a system for light-driven overall HI splitting. We note that despite the importance of demonstrating unassisted PEC solar-to-chemical conversion with lab-scale devices with respect to the goal of advancing the field of artificial photosynthesis research,68–71 no all-OS based PEC photocathode/photoanode cell for unassisted solar-to-chemical conversion has been reported until now, to the best of our knowledge. To perform the seminal demonstration we coupled our CPN:SnO2 photoanode with a previously-developed20 stable OS-based (conjugated polymer BHJ) photocathode in a side-by-side configuration as shown schematically in Fig. 6a.
 Fig. 6  Unassisted solar HI splitting with all-OS based PEC cell. (a) Shows a schematic of the side-by-side configuration and the different layers of the photocathode (0.48 cm2) and photoanode (0.42 cm2). (b) Shows the two-electrode (no applied bias) current measurement obtained in 1 M HI electrolyte (pH 0) with a photocathode (0.48 cm2) and photoanode (0.42 cm2), under the illumination intensity of 65 mW cm−2 and 75 mW cm−2, respectively. Hydrogen bubbles are observed at the photocathode surface during the CA test as shown in the inset photograph. 
The photocathode, prepared on an FTO substrate, uses a MoO3 underlayer for charge transport and an overlayer of RuO2 to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction in conjunction with the OS-based BHJ active layer (containing polymers coded as PTB7-Th and PDI-V, see previous work for chemical structures20). In 1 M HI electrolyte, this photocathode gives a photocurrent onset potential of +0.43 V vs. NHE, offering a photocurrent overlap with CPN:SnO2 photoanode (see LSV curves in Fig. S25, ESI†). The side-by-side photocathode/photoanode assembly gave a stable photocurrent of 10 μA over 10 min operation in 1 M HI under simulated solar illumination (65 mW cm−2 for the photocathode and 75 mW cm−2 for the photoanode), in the two-electrode configuration without applied bias as shown in the CA data presented in Fig. 6b. The transient photocurrent spike upon switching the illumination on and off is due to the unbalanced photocurrent generated from the PTB7-Th:PDI-V photocathode and CPN:SnO2 photoanode. During the operation, hydrogen bubbles are seen to evolve at the surface of the PTB7-Th:PDI-V photocathode, which is shown in the inset photograph in Fig. 6b and Video V1 (ESI†). While these results represent the first demonstration of an all-OS-based unassisted PEC cell for solar-to-chemical conversion, further molecular tuning and electrode optimization remains needed and will likely lead to rapid advances in the emerging field of OS-based PEC cells for artificial photosynthesis.
Conclusions
In summary, we report a hybrid covalent polymer network (CPN):SnO2 heterojunction photoanode for photoelectrochemical solar-to-chemical conversion, fabricated by a novel in situ approach. Precursor molecules, PDI-DA and Triazine-TA, are infiltrated into a mesoporous SnO2 nanoparticle film before the thermally-triggered networking reaction affords a robust active layer. Electron and atomic force microscopy, together with elemental analysis and Kelvin probe mapping establish the morphology of the hybrid BHJ as an intimate mixing of the organic and inorganic components, and PEC investigations confirm the working mechanism for HI splitting. In pH 1 aqueous electrolyte, the large estimated energy difference (0.74 V) between the LUMO of the CPN and the CB of SnO2 offers a suitable driving force for exciton dissociation and free charge generation, delivering a Jph enhancement of more than three orders of magnitude with respect to bare CPN or SnO2/CPN bilayer heterojunctions. Interestingly, the driving force for exciton separation and the observed Jph decreases in increasingly alkaline electrolyte due to the different behavior of the energy level positions with respect to the pH of the organic and inorganic components. Optimized CPN:SnO2 BHJ films, in the absence of any co-catalyst or protecting overlayers, were successfully demonstrated as photoanodes for splitting 1 M HI into H2 and I3− with a benchmark 1 sun photocurrent density, Jph of 3.3 mA cm−2 at +0.54 V vs. NHE and excellent stability (88% of Jph remained after 27 h continuous operation) representing a significant advance compared to previously reported OS photoanodes. Furthermore, the CPN:SnO2 photoanode together with a conjugated polymer BHJ photocathode, the first all-organic semiconductor based PEC cell was demonstrated for unassisted solar-to-chemical conversion. Given the easily-scalable processing and robust operation of our CPN:SnO2 photoanode, we believe our results open a new route for developing efficient and stable organic–semiconductor-based photoanodes.
Experimental methods
Photoelectrode fabrication
FTO coated glass substrates (Solaronix, 15 ohm sq−1.) were sequentially cleaned with water, acetone, and isopropanol by ultrasonication. SnO2 nanoparticle paste was purchased from Sharechem Co., Ltd (South Korea). Before use, the pristine SnO2 paste was diluted with EtOH and stirred at room temperature for overnight. The mesoporous SnO2 nanoparticle film was deposited on FTO by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 1 min, followed by annealing in air at 450 °C for 1 h. The SnO2 layer thickness was adjusted by means of dilution with EtOH. Nanoparticle paste at 50 wt%, 33 wt%, and 20 wt% in EtOH resulted in a thickness of 770 nm, 480 nm, and 200 nm, respectively (as determined by SEM, Fig. S8, ESI†). Thicker SnO2 nanoparticle films (i.e. 1.77 μm and 2.40 μm) were obtained via multiple coating steps. PDI-DA and Triazine-TA were synthesized according to the reported procedure47 and their blend solution was prepared by dissolving 3 mg PDI-DA and 0.97 mg Triazine-TA in 1 mL chloroform (1:1 molar ratio between azide and alkyne). The CPN:SnO2 bulk-heterojunction was prepared by spin coating PDI-DA:Triazine-TA blend solution on the m-SnO2 film at 1000 rpm for 1 min. To achieve monomer infiltration, the blend solution was allowed to penetrate the m-SnO2 film for 5 seconds before spin-coating started. Thermal azide alkyne cycloaddition between PDI-DA and Triazine-TA was carried out by annealing the film at 150 °C for 10 min. The preparation of PTB7-Th:PDI-V photocathode was performed as reported elsewhere.20
Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were performed by a potentiostat (SP-200 BioLogic) in a three-electrode configuration with the CPN:SnO2 photoanode as the working electrode (active area of 0.275 cm−2 unless otherwise specified), an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode as reference electrode, and a Pt wire or foil as the counter electrode. Aqueous 1 M iodide electrolyte with varying pH was prepared by dissolving KI in deionized water and adding 5 M H2SO4 to obtain pH 1, or dissolving KI in 0.1 M potassium phosphate with the desired pH. Aqueous 1 M HI was prepared by diluting concentrated HI (Aldrich, 57 wt%) with deionized water. Simulated 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) was provided by a 450 W Muller Electronik Xenon-arc lamp and calibrated by a Si photodiode. PEC performance evaluation was performed by illuminating from the substrate side. All experiments were carried out at ambient temperature and electrode potentials were converted to the NHE or RHE scale using ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 and ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.197, respectively. To construct Mott–Schottky plots, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed in 1 M iodide electrolyte at different pH without illumination, using a 25 mV amplitude perturbation between 300 mHz and 1 MHz in the same three electrode configuration. The equivalent circuit used to fit impedance data is shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†). The EFB was extracted from the well-known Mott–Schottky equation as:  where ε0 represents the permittivity of free space, εS the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of the semiconductor, Cbulk the bulk capacitance, e the electronic charge, ND the concentration of donors, k the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, V the electrode potential applied, and EFB the flat band potential. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured with a tunable illuminator (Optical Building Blocks Corp. PowerArc) as the light source at +0.54 V vs. NHE, using 1 M HI as the electrolyte. The photon flux at each wavelength was calibrated by a standard photodiode power sensor (Thorlabs S120VC). Unassisted solar-to-chemical conversion was tested in 1 M HI (pH 0) with a two-electrode configuration with no applied bias. The optimal CPN:SnO2 photoanode and PTB7-Th:PDI-V photocathode were placed side by side and illuminated in parallel. The light intensity illuminated on the photocathode and the photoanode was calibrated to be 65 mW cm−2 and 75 mW cm−2, respectively.
IMPS/IMVS measurement
IMPS/IMVS measurements were carried out in a customized light modulation system as previously reported.72 In brief, an array of white LEDs (Cree XLamp MC-E Color) was used as the light source. The background light intensity was controlled by a customized power supply with 600 mA DC current. The light intensity was sinusoidally modulated by an arbitrary function generator (Tektronix AFG3021C) with a 10% modulation depth (ca. 60 mA amplitude) ranged from 100 kHz to 0.5 Hz. For IMPS measurements, the three-electrode configuration was connected to a potentiostat (Thompson Electrochem model 251) and the counter electrode was in series with a 50 Ω resistor (Velleman E6/E12). The photocurrent response was recorded on a digital phosphor oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO7254C) through a differential probe (Tektronix TDP3500) in parallel with the 50 Ω series resistor. For IMVS experiments, the open-circuit photovoltage response was directly recorded by the oscilloscope through a BNC to banana adapter (Pomona Electronics). The entire light modulation setup was enclosed with blackout materials (Thorlabs).
Hydrogen evolution determination
Hydrogen produced at the Pt counter electrode was monitored by gas chromatography (Trace ULRTA, Thermo Fisher) periodically during chronoamperometric measurement for 11.4 h under illumination. The photoanode was illuminated from the substrate side with a solar simulator (Oriel 91160, 300 W xenon lamp) equipped with a calibrated AM 1.5G filter to provide one-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). A gas-tight single chamber polyether ether ketone (PEEK) cell filled with 3 mL 1 M HI as the electrolyte was utilized to perform the test. Argon as carrier gas for the GC test was introduced into the cell at a constant flow rate of 5 cm3 min−1. The gas phase in the cell was sampled automatically at an interval of around 11 min during the chronoamperometry via a 6-port switching valve. A micropacked Shincarbon Column (Restek) and pulse discharge detector (PDD, Restek) equipped on the GC was used to separate and analyze the gas phase, respectively. Hydrogen was identified from the retention time and the amount was calculated with the corresponding peak area. The peak signal was calibrated using standard calibration gas (Carbagas AG) before the measurement.
Other characterization
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) were measured with a Cypher S (Asylum Research), equipped with a Pt coated cantilever (Olympus AC240TM). The resonance frequency of the cantilever was 62 kHz. Imaging was performed at a scan rate of 1 Hz under dark condition in ambient environment. Top-down and cross-sectional SEM images were taken by a Zeiss GeminiSEM 300 microscope with an EDX detector. The UV-vis spectra were measured with a UV-3600 spectrometer (Shimadzu). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were measured by using a FEI Talos electron microscope operated at 200 kV. To prepare the TEM sample, the CPN:SnO2 BHJ was delaminated from the substrate and then transferred to copper support grids.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar-to-chemical conversion is a promising approach to directly convert power from the sun into the chemical energy of molecular bonds (e.g. water splitting to H2 and O2), effectively storing solar energy as renewable chemical fuels and paving the way for a sustainable low-carbon economy. The definitive characteristic of a PEC cell is a direct semiconductor–electrolyte junction, which offers increased simplicity over competing approaches (e.g. photovoltaic plus electrolysers). However, the development of high-performance and inexpensive semiconductor photoelectrodes that can also withstand the relatively harsh PEC operation conditions stands out as the main challenge in this field. Organic semiconductors (OSs) consist of earth-abundant elements, offer tunable optoelectronic properties, and have achieved excellent solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency in organic photovoltaics. In this context, there is a rapidly-growing interest to apply OSs in PEC-based approaches. However, their robustness remains a critical point to address. Moreover, given the sluggish nature of the water oxidation reaction, alternative approaches including HI splitting to produce H2 and I3− are also gaining increased attention for practical application.
