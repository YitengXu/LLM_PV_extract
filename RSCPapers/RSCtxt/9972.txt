    , Accepted 20th December 2022First published on 28th December 2022AbstractAn amorphous hydrated vanadium oxide induced by Zn2+ intercalation in Mg-ion inserted V2O5·nH2O (MgVOH) is developed as a high-performance cathode for ZIBs. In particular, zinc pyrovanadate as the product of the second phase transition is found to suppress the dissolution issue of the vanadium species for the cathode to facilitate long lifespan.
Burgeoning aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have triggered tremendous attention owing to their reliable safety, low cost, and environmental benignity.1–4 Vanadium-based compounds, as one of the most important cathode materials for ZIBs, show phase transition as an interesting phenomenon, which is closely related to electrochemical performances.5–7 For example, the layered V2O5 is prone to transform into hydrated vanadium oxide due to the uptake/removal of hydrated Zn2+ in the initial cycling stage, in which the interlayer spacing would be enlarged from 4.4 to 13.4 Å, accompanied by the performance rise to form the activation process of the battery.8 However, the generated hydrated vanadium oxide usually presents rapid performance degradation owing to the dissolution issue.9 Although some effort has been made to alleviate the vanadium dissolution by constructing a protective layer, the inactive coating would block the Zn2+ transport rate, leading to the loss of specific capacity and rate capability.10,11 Some new phases, such as Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O (ZOV), are observed as the product of phase transition in the discharge/charge process, whereas the effect of these products on the battery is still unclear.12–14 In addition, researchers have recently demonstrated that amorphous V2O5 possesses more active sites and isotropic Zn2+ diffusion routes than crystalline oxides, which can render superior rate capability for ZIBs.15–17 However, the related phase transitions of the amorphous cathode in the period of cycling thus far were overlooked.
Herein, amorphous hydrated vanadium oxide is obtained by the in situ conversion of the Mg2+-intercalated V2O5·nH2O (MgVOH) in the first zinc-ion intercalation process. The amorphous MgVOH cathode exhibits enhanced charge storage capacity and preeminent cycling stability compared with layered V2O5·nH2O. Noteworthily, the amorphous cathode is found to undergo a tardy phase transition where Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O (ZOV) emerges and increases in the cycling period. It suggests that some Zn2+ that cannot be completely extracted tends to gradually recombine with the amorphous V–O polyhedrons in the charge process, resulting in the phase transition. Importantly, the tardy phase transition could immobilize the vanadium species to resist the cathode dissolution. In addition, the tunnel structural ZOV can realize Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation as the active host material to supply capacity. As a result, the amorphous MgVOH electrode could deliver a high reversible capacity of 295 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and a long cycling life of 2000 cycles with a capacity retention of 72% at a large current rate of 2.0 A g−1. Furthermore, a quasi-solid-state (QSS) ZIBs fabricated with the MgVOH cathode presents prominent robustness to resist extreme conditions, including punching and cutting, demonstrating its promising application prospect for reliable and safe energy storage devices.
The precursor electrode was synthesized via a facile one-step solvent evaporation method, in which VO2+, Mg2+, and water molecular were crystallized on the surface of carbon paper (CP) as the extra HCl and H2O volatilized, as shown in Fig. 1a. The synthesis proceeded under ambient temperature and the obtained self-supported CP@MgVOH electrode can be directly assembled into cells, indicating the energy- and cost-efficient method of manufacturing, which might be exploited in future industrial production. The as-prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction. As seen in Fig. 1b, the XRD pattern for the orthorhombic V2O5 precursor (PDF#41-1426) is completely transformed into a set of peaks corresponding to the typical layered hydrated vanadium oxides. Compared with V2O5·nH2O (VOH), the (001), (002), and (003) peaks of MgVOH shift distinctly toward low degree, suggesting that the lattice spacing is expanded owing to the intercalation of Mg2+, which simultaneously verifies the successful Mg-ion insertion into the interlayer of VOH.18,19 Furthermore, Fig. S1a (ESI†) visualizes the uniform distribution of Mg element in MgVOH. MgVOH presents a homogenous grass-like nanostructure with interlaced porous morphology (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1b, ESI†), which could increase the accessible area with the electrolyte and facilitate ion transport.20 A lattice spacing of 1.38 nm corresponding to the (001) plane of the layered vanadium oxide is observed from the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 1d), which is also in good agreement with the XRD analysis.

(f) TEM image of amorphous MgVOH. 
An interesting transformation from layered to amorphous structure is detected for MgVOH as the electrode undergoes Zn2+ intercalation. As seen in Fig. 1e, the diffraction peaks disappear since the electrode completes the first discharge process, and no peaks emerge even at the subsequent charged or discharged states, implying that the amorphous product is formed to serve as the active material in the battery. Meanwhile, the phenomenon is further verified by the HRTEM results (Fig. 1f). To get more details about this electrode, the Raman and XPS spectra were conducted. The Raman spectrum for the electrode after the 1st cycle shows similar vibration modes to the Mg2+-inserted hydrated vanadium oxide (Fig. S2, ESI†). In addition, the XPS analyses could confirm that the active material after the initial cycle possesses almost identical oxidation state to the raw electrode (Fig. S3, ESI†). Therefore, it can be elucidated that the layered MgVOH smashes to amorphous structure during the Zn2+ intercalation process.15 Meanwhile, despite the crystal structure change and the extraction of Mg2+ after the 1st cycle (Fig. S4, ESI†), the amorphous MgVOH electrode still maintains the grass-like morphology (Fig. S5, ESI†), ensuring the abundant exposed active sites and unimpeded electrolyte ion transport in the subsequent dis/charge process. It is noted that the amorphous structure of the vanadium oxide cathode could reportedly conduct Zn2+ storage via enlarged active sites and unimpeded Zn2+ diffusion routes.15,17 In contrast, the layered structure is well reserved for VOH cathodes after Zn2+ (de)intercalation from the XRD patterns in Fig. S6 (ESI†), indicating that pre-inserted Mg2+ facilitates the induction of structural transformation. To elaborate the role of Mg2+ comprehensively, a density functional theory (DFT) calculation was employed to analyze the atom vibration and potential crystal stability for the layered MgVOH material. As a result, imaginary frequency is obtained when the atom vibrates along some special orientation (b axis as seen in Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI†). It indicates that the Mg atom would move readily in this direction, leading to its extraction in the first cycle. In addition, the existence of imaginary frequency also reveals a low crystal stability of the MgVOH material that has the possibility of phase transformation.
The electrochemical properties of the amorphous MgVOH electrode are systematically investigated using coin-type ZIBs. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Fig. 2a) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) profiles (Fig. 2b) display typical redox characteristics of the vanadium-based cathode.21 The amorphous MgVOH renders a superior reversible capacity of 295 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 in comparison to the layered VOH (Fig. S8a, ESI†) owing to the more active sites from the amorphous cathode. At the deep discharge/charge state of the small current rate of 0.1 A g−1, the MgVOH electrode shows more tardy capacity decline than layered VOH (Fig. 2c). In the meanwhile, MgVOH exhibits superior rate capability and long-term cyclability (Fig. 2d and e, and Fig. S8b, ESI†). Most vanadium-based cathodes, as we know, usually suffer from structure collapse and vanadium dissolution in the repeated cycling process, especially under the constant attack of the polar water molecule in the aqueous electrolyte, which ultimately leads to the rapid performance deterioration of batteries.9,22,23 It indicates that the amorphous cathode possesses higher electrochemical stability than the layered one. Moreover, the electrochemical kinetics for the two cathodes were probed via CV measurements and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) tests. As shown in Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†), amorphous MgVOH exhibits higher pseudocapacitive contribution and ion diffusion coefficient than layered VOH electrode, which might account for its superior capacity and rate capability.

The reaction mechanism of the high-performance MgVOH cathode is further investigated. The sharp intensity changes for Zn 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 3a) indicate Zn2+ intercalation in the discharge process,24 which can also be supported by uniform Zn distribution in the EDS images (Fig. 3d). It is noted that a spot of Zn2+ is trapped in the cathode and unable to be thoroughly extracted in the charge process, which is conducive to maintain the stability of the host material.25 In the XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 3b), the split peak involving H2O rises in the discharge process and weakens upon charging, indicating that the (de)intercalation of Zn2+ in amorphous MgVOH is accompanied by the migration of the solvent water owing to Zn2+ solvation.15 Besides, the V 2p XPS spectrum could suggest that the Zn2+ (de)intercalation process is accompanied by the evolution of the valent state for vanadium atoms, demonstrating a good reversibility of the electrochemical reaction in the MgVOH-based ZIBs.

(d) Elemental mapping images of the electrode in the fully discharged state. (e) XRD patterns recorded after different cycling numbers. (f) Schematic of the tardy phase transition process. (g) Optical images of different electrodes immerged in 2 M ZnSO4 electrolyte for different periods, where VOH-100 refers to the VOH electrode after operating for 100 cycles, and MgVOH-100 and MgVOH-1000 correspond to MgVOH after 100 and 1000 cycles, respectively. Samples in (e) and (g) are obtained at the fully charged state. 
In addition, the XRD test was carried out when the electrode was charge/discharged for different cycles. As shown in Fig. 3e, a new set of peaks arises in the 100th cycle, which can be indexed to the zinc pyrovanadate. Also, the peaks for ZOV gradually intensify as the cycling number increases, indicating that the generated ZOV accumulates continually in the repeated dis/charge process, which might be embodied in the change in the Nyquist plots (Fig. S11, ESI†). This reveals that the MgVOH electrode undergoes a phase transition from amorphous hydrated vanadium oxide to ZOV in the electrochemical reaction. Partial Zn2+ that could not extract from the host material might recombine with vanadium-based framework in the charged process, realizing the phase transition, as illustrated in Fig. 3f. This process does not require any extra charge transfer because the valence states of V atoms for both ZOV and MgVOH are +5 in the fully charged state, which guarantees the high Coulombic efficiency (∼100%). Impressively, the generation of ZOV could fix the vanadium species against dissolution into the electrolyte, which effectively alleviates the notorious problem for vanadium-based cathode. As shown in Fig. 3g, VOH and MgVOH electrodes after different cycles are immersed in 2 M ZnSO4 electrolyte. The soaking solution of MgVOH-100 and MgVOH-1000 remains colorless after 7 days, benefiting from the protection of the generated ZOV, while that of VOH exhibits yellow visible light due to the uncontrolled dissolution/decomposition of vanadium species. In particular, the soaking solution for MgVOH-1000 could remain colorless even when immersed for 14 days. It strongly verifies the significant role of ZOV in dissolution suppression. Moreover, SEM observation can further support the results. The pristine VOH electrode possesses a similar grass-like morphology (Fig. S12a, ESI†); however, the nanostructure fades out after 1000 cycles owing to the spontaneous dissolution of VOH (Fig. S12b, ESI†). In comparison, the MgVOH-1000 electrode retains the well-defined nanostructure of nanograss (Fig. S13, ESI†), indicating that the product of tardy phase transition effectively fixes the vanadium species against dissolution and retains the favorable nanostructure. Importantly, ZOV possesses tunnel structure with open framework and high valence state (V5+), which is a suitable host material to store Zn2+.26,27 This implies that MgVOH can remain active to supply capacity contribution even after phase transition. Therefore, the advantageous phase transition endows the amorphous MgVOH with high capacity and long-term stability via the active ZOV product and suppression of vanadium dissolution simultaneously.
The second phase transition into ZOV is a tardy process where the remaining vanadium oxides still suffer from the dissolution issue (the light-yellow soaking solution of MgVOH-100 in Fig. 3g can provide an indirect proof). Hence, the MgVOH electrode exhibits continuous performance decline though its cycling life improved substantially (as seen in Fig. 2c and e). It means that this work corroborates the positive contribution of the ZOV product in dissolution suppression and provides a promising route in electrode design for high-performance robust cathode, but how to eliminate the issue thoroughly still needs further comprehensive electrode engineering.
To expand the feasibility of the free-standing MgVOH cathode in the practical application, a quasi-solid-state ZIB is assembled using a 2 cm × 3 cm MgVOH as the cathode, Zn foil as the anode, and low-cost PAM/ZnSO4 gel as the electrolyte (Fig. 4a). As seen in Fig. 4b, the discharge/charge profiles exhibit similar shape with two pseudo-platforms to that in the aqueous electrolyte, suggesting that the excellent electrochemical behaviors are well preserved in the quasi-solid-state pouch cells.21 The QSS pouch battery can deliver a high capacity of 217 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and supply stable capacity of more than 150 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 for 100 cycles (Fig. 4c), demonstrating its excellent cycling durability in scalable QSS cells. The electrochemical properties exhibit a slight rise in the initial stage, which might be caused by the gradual infiltration of the gel electrolyte in the MgVOH nanograss. Impressively, the QSS cell is endowed with remarkable stability to resist different extremely damaging conditions. As shown in Fig. 4d and Video S1 (ESI†), the mini fan powered by a single QSS Zn/MgVOH battery can keep working even when the battery is punched and cut. These results verify MgVOH as a promising cathode for durable and safe batteries in practical application.

In summary, we have synthesized an amorphous hydrated vanadium oxide via intercalation-induced conversion of layered Mg-inserted V2O5·nH2O. The amorphous MgVOH electrode possesses abundant active sites and isotropic Zn2+ transport routes, thereby showing higher capacity and rate capability than the layered structural VOH cathode. In addition, a tardy phase transition from amorphous MgVOH to zinc pyrovanadate is found in the period of cycling. The generated ZOV can suppress the dissolution of cathode by fixing the vanadium species and serve as the active material to supply the discharge capacity, which ensures the good cycling durability and long lifespan. This work provides a new insight for understanding the phase transition of the vanadium-based compound cathode.
