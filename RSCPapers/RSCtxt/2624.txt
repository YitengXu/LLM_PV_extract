1. Introduction
1.1 Supercapacitors and flexible supercapacitors
With the depletion of fossil fuels and aggravation of CO2 emission, the development of efficient renewable energy technologies for energy conversion and storage will become more and more significant in the future. For various energy conversion systems, the storage of electricity will be unquestionably important because electricity is the most convenient for use. Today, supercapacitors (i.e. electrochemical capacitors or ultracapacitors) and lithium-ion batteries are at the leading edge of electrical energy storage research.1,2 Generally, supercapacitors (SCs) can possess higher energy density than traditional dielectric capacitors and deliver much higher power rates than batteries, showing attractive potential in bridging the gap of energy/power demand (as shown in Fig. 1) and envisioned applications such as hybrid electric vehicles, power back-up for mobile electronics, load-leveling and other uninterruptible power supplies.3 Electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors are two main categories of commonly studied SCs. In EDLCs, energy is stored via reversible ion adsorption at (or near) the electrode/electrolyte interface using electrochemically stable carbon materials with high accessible surface areas. Whereas pseudocapacitors store charges via fast surface redox reactions on electroactive materials (e.g. transition metal oxides RuO2, MnO2, conducting polymers, etc.).4,5 Even though significant progress has been made on exceptional capacitance and cycling durability, SCs still require more innovative active materials to achieve higher energy density without sacrificing high power delivery and uptake. Further breakthrough in the scalable processing to manufacture SCs toward commercial utilizations is also challenging.

Meanwhile, flexible/stretchable electronic devices that are suitable for arbitrary installation and applications have attracted great attention in recent years,6,7 which are very desirable for developing lightweight, thin, elastic, aesthetic and efficient portable/wearable electronics. As a type of flexible energy device, flexible SCs are extensively studied, in order to further boost the advanced technology for next-generation energy storage.8–15 Flexible SCs are usually built on metal sheets, plastics, papers, carbon cloth, cotton and textile-type substrates. Aside from flexible substrates, mechanically flexible active materials/films, electrolytes, separators and strong interface bonding are also prerequisites for the accommodation of flexible SCs under a wide range of bending and pressure conditions.
1.2 Characterization of flexible supercapacitors
To evaluate the performance of a flexible SC, there are some typical characteristics for consideration, which could be divided into two parts including the electrochemical performance and the mechanical property characteristics. As to the electrochemical performance, the overall capacitance (CO) of the entire device and the specific capacitance (CS) of an electrode or electrode materials can be expressed viaeqn (1) and (2): (1) (2)where CP and CN represent the capacitance of the positive electrode and the negative electrode, respectively. Ci is the capacitance of the electrode or electrode materials, Bi could be the weight (resulting in gravimetric capacitance, F g−1), the area (resulting in areal capacitance, F cm−2) or the volume (resulting in volumetric capacitance, F cm−3) of the electrode or electrode materials.
The energy density (E) and power density (P) can be calculated as following: (3) (4)where V is the operating voltage, RESR is the equivalent series resistance of the device and tdischarge is the discharge time. From the above equations, it can be concluded that the energy and power capacity of the SCs are mainly determined by C, V and RESR, especially V. Generally, the selection of internally active materials and the involvement of pseudo-capacitive materials can improve C. Accompanied by well-tailored electrode materials and stable electrolytes (e.g. organic electrolyte and ionic liquid) with wide voltage windows, asymmetric SCs and hybrid-structured strategies can always expand the potential. To reduce RESR, more conductive electrode materials and electrolytes and effective contact between the active materials and the current collector are beneficial. Besides, the cycling life and the reversibility of charge–discharge are important parameters to assess the electrochemical performance of SCs.
As for the mechanical performance, no unified and perfect evaluation standards have been well established to characterize the flexible SCs to date. Among most reported related studies, mechanical flexibility (fewer discussions on stretchability) is usually evaluated by simply measuring the capacitive performances under different bending circumstances, for instance, various bending curvatures and performance retentions during repeated bending cycles.16,17 As flexible SCs aim to largely promote future energy storage technology, more efforts should be taken to exactly investigate the mechanical properties under conditions that are close to the actual application situations.
1.3 The scope of this feature article
While there are many good reviews relevant to SCs, almost all focused on various nanostructured electrode materials.3,5,18–21 In this feature article, we review the recent advances in flexible SCs with relative emphasis on the preparation of active materials on flexible substrates and feasible ways to fulfill efficient interface bonding, the electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility, and some good examples as well (Table 1). In Section 2, progress on planar-type flexible SCs which are classified based on different substrates is presented. For each part, flexible SCs based on the same type of substrate are mainly organized according to the different active materials used, i.e. from carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, graphenes) to pseudocapacitive materials (metal oxides and conducting polymers). In Sections 3 and 4, the new-type fiber SCs for electrochemical energy storage and integrated/hybrid fiber energy systems are highlighted, respectively. Together, some summaries and perspectives on the future development trends are given in the last part.

2. Flexible planar-structured supercapacitors
Common SCs are always planar-structured with the electrolyte and the separator sandwiched by two active electrodes. For a specific active electrode or the entire device, the electrode substrate is often necessary unless the active electrode film is free-standing itself. In order to achieve efficient flexible SCs, substrates with excellent mechanical properties and easy modifications by active layers are basically required. Typically, a substrate mainly acts as an electrode support to fabricate mechanically stable SCs, also it can act as a current collector if it is conductive, which favors the reduction of the device's internal resistance. Hence, metal-type substrates being applied in commercial capacitors are also used for flexible SCs.22–24 For example, stainless steel mesh was employed as conductive substrates in flexible SCs.22 Jeong et al. developed high-performance ultracapacitors based on nitrogen-doped graphene that was cast onto nickel foils and other flexible substrates, leading to a high capacitance of about 280 F per gelectrode.23 However, no details on the device flexibility were found in these studies. Shen and coworkers reported flexible all-solid-state symmetric SCs with NiCo2O4 nanowire (NW) arrays supported on Ni foam electrodes, showing a high areal capacitance of 161 mF cm−2.24 Good mechanical properties of the flexible SC were confirmed by the insignificant change in electrochemical performance after 60 bending cycles and high capacitance retentions under twisted and bent states.
2.1 Flexible supercapacitors using plastic substrates
Though metal substrates are ideal electrical conductors, they suffer from heavy weight and limited flexibility. As SCs are designed for practical energy storage systems, other features of the substrate material such as being lightweight and thin will help in increasing the ultimate gravimetric (or volumetric) performance. In this regard, light, soft and thin plastics were broadly adopted to prepare flexible SCs.
However, insulated plastic substrates are essentially modified by conducting materials to achieve efficient electron collection. For instance, metal layer deposited polyester substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are selected in flexible SCs. Wang et al. developed all-solid-state and flexible interdigital-like micro-SCs on a PET chip through photolithography,25 in which the Au/Cr film was thermally evaporated as the current collector and polyaniline (PANI) NW arrays were deposited on the surface of the Au layer via in situ chemical polymerization. The micro-SC acquired a high capacitance of about 588 F cm−3 and can be in series or parallel connection to enhance the potential or current range. In the work by Yu's group, novel planar comb-teeth patterned flexible and semitransparent SCs were designed on the Ni deposited PET substrate.26 The Ni film was deposited by e-beam evaporation, followed by dip-coating carbon ink as the active layer. Though the reported capacitance was not high (2.89 F g−1), the device showed good bending tolerance during 100 bending cycles at a bending radius of 10 mm.
Developing integrated and portable electronics is an important aspect for SCs in future applications, flexible SCs with high transparency that can be easily combined with power conversion devices such as solar cells and displays will be very appealing. Hence, transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) coated plastic substrates are also useful. In 2006, flexible and transparent SCs were reported by electrophoretically depositing ruthenic acid nanosheets on ITO/PET.27 In 2009, optically transparent SC was prepared by simply coating room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) gel and ITO on PEN substrates.28 Through chemical bath deposition, Hu et al. synthesized layered MnO2 films on ITO/PET substrates to obtain flexible transparent SCs with a capacitance of 229 F g−1.29 Good mechanical flexibility and stability of the MnO2 thin film electrode rather than the complete device subjected to compression and tension were demonstrated.
To replace metal or ITO materials and further improve the capacitive performance of plastic-based flexible SCs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphenes possessing high conductivity, transparency, lightweight and considerable electrochemical activity are attractive candidates. Shen et al. developed flexible high frequency response SCs using MnO2 nanoparticle deposited porous single walled CNTs (SWCNTs) as electrodes, showing a specific capacitance of 529.8 F g−1, energy density of 73.6 W h kg−1 and power density of 14.6 kW kg−1.30 Similarly, aligned multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) incorporated with PANI were adopted to fabricate transparent and flexible SCs.31 After bending for 50 cycles, the capacitance value decreased by less than 8%.
Yu et al. reported transparent and flexible graphene SCs. A thin graphene film (25–100 nm thick) was prepared on a PET substrate by vacuum filtration through an alumina anodisc membrane and then etching away the alumina membrane.32 Taking advantage of layer-by-layer assembly, ultrathin and transparent multilayer films of Co–Al hydroxide nanosheets/graphene oxide (GO) were deposited onto PET substrates.33 A high specific capacitance of 1204 F g−1 and an area capacitance of 90 F m−2 were demonstrated after treating the films with H2. Yet, the performances of the complete device or the flexible SC were not found in the study. The work by Xie and colleagues showed a good example of high performance graphene-based flexible SCs, which employed hybrid nanostructures of quasi-2D ultrathin MnO2/graphene nanosheets.17 The 2D δ-MnO2–graphene hybrid thin film on a cellulose acetate membrane was prepared by a vacuum filtration process, and then transferred onto the PET substrate. The planar flexible SC was robust, which have good electrochemical performance (267 F g−1) and exceptional flexibility simultaneously. Capacitance retention of over 90% after 1000 times of folding/unfolding was achieved because of the high planar malleability of the device.
In addition, studies have showed that graphene is highly desirable for building free-standing or self-supporting active films. Choi et al. described a flexible asymmetric SC based on an IL functionalized-chemically modified graphene (IL–CMG) negative electrode and RuO2–IL–CMG positive electrode.34 The CMG-based films are self-supporting and used as active electrodes and current collectors for flexible SCs, showing good flexibility and performance stability (capacitance retention > 95%) over 2000 cycles under either bent or twisted states. Kaner and coworkers reported high-performance flexible laser-scribed graphene-based electrochemical capacitors (LSG-ECs).15,16 Specifically, LSG films with high conductivity (1738 S m−1) and specific area (1520 m2 g−1) were produced from direct laser reduction of graphite oxide films. The produced LSG films were free-standing and can be put onto various substrates to prepare SCs with different designs, e.g. all-solid-state flexible LSG-EC (Fig. 2). The corresponding stack capacitances were impressive. Under extreme bending, the device capacitance showed almost no change, indicating outstanding mechanical flexibility. The LSG-EC units can also be readily combined in series or in parallel to meet various voltage or current requirements. He et al. presented lightweight and free-standing graphene–MnO2 composites for flexible SCs with specific capacitances of 465 F g−1 (for the active materials) and 130 F g−1 (for the entire electrode).35 Shao et al. demonstrated flexible asymmetric SCs using graphene/MnO2 nanorod thin films as positive electrodes and graphene–Ag hybrid thin-films as negative electrodes.36 The graphene films were also assembled through vacuum filtration. A maximum energy density of 50.8 W h kg−1 and power density of 90.3 kW kg−1 were exhibited and the bent device can spin a fan.

(c) CVs tested at a scan rate of 1 V s−1 for the flexible EC under different bending conditions. (d) Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves for four tandem ECs connected in series that can light a red light emitting diode (LED, inset).16 
The plastic substrates used in the above flexible SCs were mainly used for supporting and packaging. Compared with substrates discussed in the following, plastic substrates have no capacitance contribution and increase the inert component, which are disadvantageous for the actual performance (e.g. the gravimetric or volumetric performance) of the complete device. However, when considering the device encapsulation issue, long-term stability and compatibility with other flexible electronic devices, plastics may still be a good choice.
2.2 Paper-based supercapacitors
Substrates in paper format have attracted much attention because they are ultrathin, flexible and light-weight, which are precious qualities for flexible, foldable and wearable electronic devices. Thus, various kinds of papers, e.g. carbon papers, graphene papers and cellulose papers, could play a role in SCs as thin, light, cheap and flexible current collectors, active components or separators. Generally speaking, paper-like substrates can be divided into two types according to the original conductivity, i.e. carbon-based conductive “paper” and cellulose-based paper. The former can be used as current collectors and/or active components due to its inherent properties, such as good conductivity, large surface area and electrochemical activities. The latter can be modified to improve its electrical conductivity or just acts as a separator.
Carbon-based conductive “papers”, such as carbon paper, carbon fiber (CF) paper, CNT paper and graphene paper, have favorable properties such as easy production, excellent flexibility and light weight. Hence, carbon-based paper has been promising as thin free-standing electrodes. Also, the impressive specific surface area of carbon materials would provide sufficient active area for excellent capacitive performance.
Previous work reported carbon paper coated with polypyrrole (PPy) or poly-(N-methylpyrrole)s doped with heteropolyacids for SCs. With the Nafion electrolyte, the specific capacitance was 776 F g−1 and 0.79 F cm−2 at 1 mV s−1. However, the device flexibility was not discussed.37 In recent years, carbon papers were directly used as conductive substrates to support active nanomaterials. SCs based on vertically aligned oxidized CNTs grown on conductive carbon papers via water-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) achieved a high specific capacitance of ∼180 F g−1 at ∼150 A g−1.38 Well-ordered whisker-like MnO2 arrays were prepared on CF paper for flexible SCs.39 The devices yield a high-capacitance performance of up to 274.1 F g−1 and long cycle-life with 95% of its specific capacitance being retained after 5000 cycles at 0.1 A g−1.
Though CNTs have a flexible random network and a high surface area, CNT-based SCs use metallic current collectors due to the limited conductivity of CNT films. In 2007, M. Kaempgen et al. reported highly conductive and porous CNT networks as the sole electrically conducting material in SCs.40 The dense free-standing CNT network was prepared by filtering a CNT suspension and peeled off from the membrane after washing and drying. The conductivity of roughly 20 μm thick CNT network reached 103 S cm−1. Its high surface area and good conductivity led to a novel lightweight device with a specific capacitance of 44 F g−1 at 20 mV s−1, which is comparable with that of metallic current collector-based devices. In the same year, Ajayan and coworkers introduced a reliable self-releasing technique for producing free-standing vertically aligned CNT films via the CVD method. The CNT films were directly used as electrodes in EDLCs with a specific capacitance of 51 F g−1 according to galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at 5 mA.41 Later, Niu et al. realized the assembly of compact-designed SCs using large-scale, flexible, high tensile and freestanding SWCNT films.42 The calculated specific capacitance was about 35 F g−1 and the high energy density of 43.7 W h kg−1 and power density of 197.3 kW kg−1 were reported. Activated carbon (AC) incorporated CNT paper electrodes were fabricated for flexible SCs.43 The corresponding capacitance reached a maximum of 267.6 F g−1 with a CNT loading of 5 wt%, and the energy density and power density were 22.5 W h kg−1 and 7.3 kW kg−1 at a high current density of 20 A g−1. Good cycling performance was displayed with 97.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 200 mV s−1.
Apart from being employed as current collectors and active materials, CNT paper could act as a good conductive matrix for transition metal oxides or conducting polymers with high pseudo-capacitance. SCs based on free-standing, electrodeposited flexible MnO2 NW–CNT composite paper were fabricated, with specific capacitances as high as 167.5 F g−1 at 77 mA g−1.44 Using free-standing CNT–V2O5 NW composite paper, SCs exhibiting a power density of 5.26 kW kg−1, an energy density of 46.3 W h kg−1 and the calculated specific capacitance of 48.5 F g−1 (based on the electrode weight) were prepared. The presence of Li+ can further improve the overall performance and cycling stability substantially.45 These results clearly confirm that after modification with pseudocapacitive materials, CNT paper-based flexible SCs can gain much higher specific capacitance and cycling life via the combination of electrical double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. Through PANI polymerization on free-standing CNT networks, ultrathin and flexible paper-like SCs with PANI/CNT nanocomposite films were demonstrated (Fig. 3),12 showing a high specific capacitance of 350 F g−1 for the electrode materials (31.4 F g−1 for the entire device) and good cycle stability under the highly flexible (twisted) state. Accordingly, three flexible SCs in series can drive a LED.

Likewise, graphene paper-based SCs were extensively investigated. The synergistic effect of large surface area graphene paper and the ultrathin pseudocapacitive layer could offer great promise for high-performance energy storage device applications. For example, graphene paper pillared by carbon black nanoparticles was used as electrodes for SCs,46 which have a specific capacitance of 138 F g−1 and 83.2 F g−1 (at 10 mV s−1) with negligible capacitance degradation after 2000 cycles in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. According to a simple dip-coating process, a graphene/MnO2 nanostructured sponge was fabricated and used as hybrid electrodes for flexible SCs,47 showing a maximum energy density of 8.34 W h kg−1 and high power density of 47 kW kg−1. Perera et al. reported V2O5 NW–graphene composite paper prepared by filtering with nylon filter paper.48 Through an electrostatic adsorption method, free-standing graphene nanosheet/PANI nanofiber composite paper was prepared.49 After filtration of the graphene suspension through a cellulose membrane and following in situ electropolymerization, free-standing graphene/PANI paper that exhibited good tensile strength (12.6 MPa) was obtained.50 As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the composite paper showed an excellent gravimetric capacitance of 233 F g−1 and volumetric capacitance of 135 F cm−3, and excellent cycling durability as well. Similarly, uniform PANI nanorods were electropolymerized onto lightweight (0.2 g cm−3) and conductive (15 Ω sq−1) graphene paper with the ordered microstructure, which was prepared from a reduction-assembly method. The further resulting flexible graphene/PANI SCs with a specific capacitance of 763 F g−1 but relatively limited cycling stability were demonstrated.51

To improve the potential window, asymmetric SCs based on free-standing CNT/graphene paper and Mn3O4 nanoparticle/graphene paper electrodes (Fig. 4c and d) achieved an increased cell voltage of 1.8 V, and specific capacitance of 50.8 F g−1 at 10 A g−1.52 Repeated bending and twisting had not nearly degraded the capacitance. The device showed remarkable cycling stability and retained 86.0% of its initial capacitance after 10000 cycles.
Nonconductive cellulose papers, e.g. filter papers and commercial typing papers, have the advantages of low cost, high flexibility, easy cutting and simple attachment by functional layers. To become efficient electrodes, a key step is to make them conductive to ensure high electrochemical performance, especially in an easy-to-handle, facile and reproducible way. Still, the mechanical flexibility of the paper electrode would be virtually important for practical flexible/foldable applications.
Owing to the 3D hierarchical porous structures and functional groups of paper, strong adhesion and large contacting surface area between the paper substrates and the active materials would result and readily enable the formation of high quality paper electrodes with high mechanical strength. In 2007, Victor L. Pushparaj et al. developed cellulose/CNT nanocomposite paper-based flexible SCs,8 in which nanoporous cellulose paper was embedded with aligned MWCNTs and a Ti/Au thin film was deposited on MWCNTs acting as the current collector. Specific capacitances of 36 F g−1 and 22 F g−1 were achieved in KOH and RTIL electrolytes, respectively. Cui's group has also done creative research on paper-type SCs. In 2009, they coated SWCNT ink onto commercial paper by a simple solution process to prepare highly conductive (10 Ω sq−1) and bendable CNT paper53 (Fig. 5a and b). SCs made from conductive CNT paper realized high performance with a specific capacitance of 200 F g−1, a specific energy of 30–47 W h kg−1, a specific power of 200 kW kg−1 (7.5 W h kg−1 for all the dead components), and stable cyclability over 40000 cycles. To make printable SCs toward practical paper electronics, they further attempted to integrate the CNT film and separator into a single sheet of commercial printer paper.54 Before directly coating or ink-jet printing CNT ink on both sides of the paper, the paper was treated with PVDF to block micropores to avoid short-circuiting because of CNT penetration. A specific capacitance of 33 F g−1 at a high power density of 250 kW kg−1 using an organic electrolyte was reported. Afterwards, flexible paper SCs fabricated by directly drawing graphite on cellulose paper were invented.55 As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the drawing process was simply fulfilled by a pencil. The paper SC showed a specific capacitance of ∼23 F g−1 (areal capacitance of 2.3 mF cm−2) and nearly 90% capacitance retention over 15000 cycles. The solvent-free drawing method demonstrated a viable approach for low cost and environmental energy storage devices. Later, Kang et al. described bacterial nanocellulose/CNT (BNC/CNT) papers for all-solid-state flexible SCs.56 The CNT layer was deposited onto BNC paper via a common vacuum filtering process. The SCs showed desirable capacitance (50.5 F g−1 or ∼20.2 mF cm−2) and cyclability with a capacitance reduction of less than 0.5% over 5000 charge–discharge cycles at 10 A g−1. Benefitting from the considerable Young's modulus and tensile strength of the BNC paper, the SCs showed excellent mechanical integrity as device performance was highly maintained during 200 bending cycles to a radius of 3 mm. Besides, they also prepared flexible SCs by coating CNTs and IL-based gel electrolytes on office papers via a drop-dry method, exhibiting a specific capacitance of 135 F g−1. The maximum power density and energy density were 164 kW kg−1 and 41 W h kg−1, respectively.57 In 2011, Cheng's group reported graphene-cellulose paper (GCP) flexible SCs.58 The GCP electrode was prepared by vacuum filtration and can not only withstand a stress as high as 8.67 MPa with a 3% elongation, but also has high specific capacitance (120 F g−1 of graphene) and mechanical stability. The bending had almost no effect on the capacitive behavior. The SCs showed a high capacitance of 46 mF cm−2 (for the complete devices) under highly flexible conditions.

(b) Capacitance retention of CNT conductive paper SCs measured in H2SO4 and organic electrolytes.53 (c) Schematic diagram of drawing a conductive electrode on cellulose paper using a graphite pencil and the finished conductive paper electrode. (d) Cycling stability and capacitances at different current densities for drawing-derived paper SCs.55 
When the pseudocapacitive contribution was involved, paper/CNT/MnO2 SCs showed a high specific capacitance of 540 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1, together with a specific energy of 20.5 W h kg−1 and specific power of 1.5 kW kg−1 at 5 A g−1, respectively.59Via a facile “soak and polymerization” approach, highly conductive (15 S cm−1 and low sheet resistance of 4.5 Ω sq−1) papers were produced by coating PPy on common printing papers.60 The corresponding flexible SCs based on PPy-coated paper electrodes had an excellent areal capacitance of 0.42 F cm−2. When the volume of the whole cell was considered, a high energy density of 1 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 0.27 W cm−3 was achieved. In addition, the PPy-coated paper SCs demonstrated exceptional mechanical stability under different bending curvatures. Wang and coworkers extended the use of paper SCs to self-powered systems.61 Highly flexible all-solid-state PANI-based SCs were built on Au-coated paper substrates and can function as efficient energy storage units to store energy produced by a solar cell or a piezoelectric nanogenerator. It is worth noting that commercial papers with a porous structure can also act as an efficient separator in addition to supporting substrates.
To prepare new kinds of paper electrodes, Wu et al. pressed three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen and boron co-doped monolithic graphene aerogels to make graphene paper electrodes and SCs.62 The SC shows a high specific capacitance of 62 F g−1, energy density of 8.65 W h kg−1 and power density of 1.6 kW kg−1. Very recently, Chen et al. fabricated a flexible paper-like SC with a nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber electrode derived from pyrolyzed bacterial cellulose.63 The 3D structure with coadjacent NWs (10–20 nm) and cross-linking pores of the electrode can provide large interfacial area and many ion diffusion paths. The devices deliver a maximum power density of ∼390 kW kg−1 and exhibit good cycling durability with 95.9% retention after 5000 cycles.
In brief, paper-based SCs have been one of the most promising flexible/foldable SCs for future energy storage devices because of the impressive electrochemical performance, long cycling life, lightweight and scalable processing. Despite the great progress that had been made for paper SCs, more comprehensive investigation on the optimal integration of the paper substrate, the active materials and the electrolyte is necessary to maximize the electrochemical and mechanical performance. Besides, fine encapsulation might be needed for long-term device stability and safety considerations. However, we are optimistic that high-speed printing technology could lead to low-cost, high-performance paper SCs, and thus, open a door to recyclable all paper electronics.
2.3 Carbon fabric-based supercapacitors
The intrinsic flexibility, reasonable chemical stability and a 3D structure with high porosity have endowed carbon fabrics (or textiles) with wide recognition for producing high cost-performance flexible SCs. Activated carbon fabrics (ACFs) can be directly used as electrodes in SCs because of their large surface area and moderate activity. To improve the capacitance, further coating with carbon materials, metallic oxides or conducting polymers is an effective route.
In 2001, Schmitt et al. incorporated carbon cloth into resorcinol formaldehyde to build button cell supercapacitors. Although the capacitance is not high, this is an early study of applying carbon fabrics into SCs.64 In 2009, Hung et al. demonstrated ACF-based SCs that could withstand wide temperatures (−40 °C to 100 °C) and a voltage window ranging from −2 V to 2 V by using an organic electrolyte system.65 The ACF electrodes had uniform slit-type micro-pores and a high specific surface area, so the device could obtain appreciable capacitance (73 F g−1) at extremely low temperature (−25 °C). Also, carbon fabrics can be modified by chemical reactions66 and electrochemical treatments67 so as to realize intentional tailoring of electronic properties.
One of the most popular approaches to optimize the carbon fabric electrode is surface modification with nanostructured carbon films, e.g. graphite paste, CNTs and GO having large specific surface areas. Hu et al. coated electronically conductive paste on ACFs. The paste was composed of graphite (60 wt%) and PVDF (40 wt%),68 when the voltammetric curves of ACF-pasted electrodes showed ideal capacitive behavior. The average specific capacitance of the modified ACF could reach ∼250 F g−1. Chen and coworkers employed CNTs grown on carbon fabrics as SC electrodes. CNTs were prepared by a microwave plasma-enhanced CVD technique and the surface area was much larger than that of bare carbon fabrics. The SCs displayed a high specific capacitance of 210 F g−1. Moreover, it also possessed excellent cyclability over 10000 cycles with a capacitance decrease of ∼10%.69 In the study of Wang et al., a GO-assisted electrophoretic deposition method to deposit CNTs onto carbon fabrics was developed. The GO–CNT/carbon fabric showed remarkably enhanced SC performance in terms of specific capacitance, rated capability, power density and energy density.70
Because of the limited electrochemical capacity of carbon materials, the energy and power density of carbon fabric-based SCs through nanocarbon modification are still a major drawback. For the sake of more efficient SCs, metal oxides, such as Ru oxide and Mn oxide, have been extensively studied to make metal oxides and carbon fabric composites so as to combine the virtues of both flexibility and high specific capacitance. Wang et al. reported electrochemical catalytic oxidation of ACFs by ruthenium chloride. The total specific capacitance of ca. 180 F g−1 was achieved.71 In spite of good capacitive performance, the high cost and toxicity of Ru oxide restricts its scope of application. Cheaper MnO2 with lower toxicity can be a substitute. Via the anodic electrodeposition technique, microporous MnO2 nanosheets exhibiting high specific area were synthesized on carbon cloth (CC).72 The optimal specific capacitance of the MnO2 nanosheet–CC hybrid electrode was 425 F g−1. The bent SC showed good cycling life over 3000 cycles. Through a simple flame synthesis method, carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) were grown on carbon fabric, followed by electrochemical deposition of MnO2 nanorods.73 The carbon fabric supported CNP–MnO2 hybrid electrodes were further assembled for flexible all-solid-state SCs, which exhibited the highest areal capacitance of 109 mF cm−2, and an energy density of 4.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 14 kW kg−1. Moreover, the devices are flexible and efficient, showing good cycling stability over 10000 cycles and favorable stability under different bending curvatures. The poor electrical conductivity is a crucial challenge for applying MnO2 to SCs. Meanwhile, WO3 semiconductor is highly conductive, and it could offer a channel for charge transfer. Lu et al. designed and fabricated highly flexible SCs from hybrid WO3−x@Au@MnO2 core–shell NWs grown on flexible carbon fabric,74 as displayed in Fig. 6. The specific capacitance reached 1195 F g−1 (calculated by MnO2 mass) at 0.75 A g−1, and it remained almost constant over 5000 cycles. The assembled device can power a LED well for about 20 min. The same group also prepared WO3−x/MoO3−x core–shell NWs on carbon fabric negative electrodes by physical evaporation deposition and electrodeposition,75 respectively. Assembled with a PANI positive electrode, whole flexible asymmetric SCs showing a high areal capacitance of ca. 216 mF cm−2 and energy density of 1.9 mW h cm−3 were reported. One-dimensional WO3 NW arrays could serve as accessible pathways for fast ion and electron transport. Shen and coworkers prepared high-performance SCs based on ordered WO3 NWs on carbon cloth by a hydrothermal method.76 The device exhibited a high specific capacitance of 521 F g−1 and nearly 100% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. Based on their previous finding that the conductivity and electrochemical activity of ZnO NWs can be greatly improved after hydrogenation, Wang and colleagues developed hydrogenated single-crystal ZnO@amorphous ZnO-doped MnO2 core–shell nano-cables (HZM) on carbon cloth for high-performance flexible SCs and self-powered systems.77 For the SC electrodes, an areal capacitance of 138.7 mF cm−2 and specific capacitance of 1260.9 F g−1 were reported, while the whole device had a total areal capacitance of 26 mF cm−2. After 10000 charge–discharge cycles, 87.5% of the original capacitance was retained. A stand-alone self-powered system was further built by the flexible SCs integrated with additional series-wound dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and a LED.

Conducting polymers are generally attractive for their desirable electroactivity, conductivity, stability and good adhesion properties with carbon substrates as well. PANI and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) are two main conducting polymers that are mostly used in carbon fabric-based SCs. Owing to the large surface area of carbon fabrics, electrochemical polymerization is the most efficient approach to coat PANI on CFs. Hu et al. prepared ACF–PANI by electrochemical polymerization. The specific capacitance of the composites reached 125 F g−1, which was much higher than that of bare ACF.78 Surface treatment of carbon fabric is an effective strategy to improve the interface contact. Cheng et al. used electro-etched CF cloth as a SC electrode by coating PANI NWs.79 The electro-etched CFs were more hydrophilic and had a larger surface area, thus PANI nanofibers can grow on the etched CFs quite uniformly. The PANI NWs can achieve a specific capacitance of 673 F g−1. By an electrochemical method, PANI NWs were directly fabricated onto carbon fabric for flexible SCs, which obtained a high gravimetric capacitance of 1079 F g−1, area capacitance of 1.8 F cm−2 and stable performance under high curvature.80 In Laforgue's work, an all-textile flexible SC was set up from a carbon fabric current collector and electrospun PEDOT nanofibers.81 The device had a capacitance of 20 F g−1 and 90% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles.
2.4 Cotton/textile-type supercapacitors
Cotton cloth, one of the most universal materials in the textile industry, is a flexible and porous fabric made from natural cotton fibers. The fibers have a complicated structure with high porosity, large surface area and hydrophilic functional groups. As a result, cotton is an ideal material for lightweight flexible/wearable SCs, yet it should be processed by loading conductive carbon or active pseudocapacitive materials to make it suitable for use in SCs.
CNT, porous activated carbon and GO are the carbon materials that are often adopted in SCs. Pasta et al. coated SWCNTs onto cotton fabric to make porous conductors.82 A cotton sheet was soaked into SWCNT ink and the resultant conductive cotton showed high conductivity and high surface area. A high specific capacitance of 70–80 F g−1 was reached, and negligible decay was observed after 35000 cycles. Cui and coworkers developed stretchable and flexible SCs via coating SWCNTs on everyday textiles.83 The conductive textile had high conductivity (125 S cm−1) with sheet resistance less than 1 Ω sq−1. SCs based on conductive textiles achieved high capacitance up to 0.48 F cm−2, and high specific energy. Gogotsi's group described carbon-coated flexible fabric SCs (Fig. 7) by infiltrating porous carbon into woven cotton using a screen printing technique.14 The complex structure of cotton could improve the distribution of carbon particles, and the diffusion distance of ions can be shorter. The electrodes achieved specific capacitances as high as 85 F g−1 (0.43 F cm−2), and the device had a capacitance decrease of 8% over 10000 cycles. Through a simple “brush-coating and drying” process, GO ink was coated onto daily cotton cloth for preparing SCs.84 The GO–cotton composite showed 3D network architecture, which facilitates fast ion diffusion. The specific capacitance of 81.7 F g−1 for the whole cell and good cycle durability was demonstrated. Cotton is mainly composed of cellulose fibers, and it can turn into carbonized cotton directly by simple thermal treatment. The carbonized cotton possesses both high conductivity and structural complicacy. Xue et al. reported an all-cotton-derived, fully foldable SC that is constructed by using two pieces of carbonized cotton mats as electrodes.85 Although the specific capacitance was not high (12–14 F g−1), high-rate capacitive performance could be maintained even when the device was bent, fully folded and rolled-up.
 Fig. 7  Design of fabric SC and porous carbon impregnation from the weave, to the yarn and to the fibers.14 
To introduce active metal oxides in cotton-based SCs, high conductivity carbon and metal oxide composites should be prepared to compensate the low conductivity of common metal oxides. In this case, SWCNT thin film electrodes were produced on flexible substrates and cloth fabrics by inkjet printing in a controllable way.10 To enhance the capacitive performance, RuO2 NWs synthesized from the CVD method were combined, leading to a specific capacitance of 138 F g−1, specific energy of 18.8 W h kg−1 and power of 96 kW kg−1. Besides, Wang et al. assembled flexible SCs based on the PANI/SWCNT/cloth composite electrode.86 SWCNTs and PANI NW arrays were deposited on a non-woven wiper cloth through a dip coating method and dilute polymerization, respectively. A large specific capacitance of 410 F g−1, high rate capability and stability were reported. In addition, cotton T-shirt textiles were converted into foldable and highly conductive activated carbon textiles through NaF chemical activation.87 After integrating MnO2 to the activated textile, the specific capacitance can reach 269.5 F g−1.
In spite of the demand for further enhancement of device performance and flexibility, flexible SCs built on carbon fabrics, textiles or cotton cloths have become more and more competitive due to their low cost and high capacity, particularly for improving wearable/woven energy storage devices.
3. Fiber/wire-shaped supercapacitors
Different from conventional two-dimensional (2D) planar electronics, fiber electronic devices are commonly built on fibrous or interwoven substrates, and thus show incomparable advantages for the direct use as weavable and embedded device units or integrated textile modules, which are attractive in realizing miniaturized portable devices and multi-functional “smart textiles (fabrics)” for sensors, environmental monitoring, display and implanted medical devices. The recent emerging 1D fiber electronics, including fiber logic circuits,88 fiber solar cells,89,90 fiber displays,91 fiber nanogenerators,92etc., have inspired much interest in developing efficient, lightweight, highly flexible/wearable energy conversion devices. Once solar light, thermal and mechanical energy are scavenged from the environment, high performance energy storage devices and flexible fiber energy harvesting devices are quite essential.
In 2011, a prototype of fiber micro-SC (Fig. 8a) made from ZnO NW electrodes was invented by Wang's group for the first time.93 The SC was fabricated with a flexible plastic (PMMA) wire-supported ZnO electrode entangled around a Kevlar fiber-supported ZnO electrode. To improve the charge collection ability and facilitate the hydrothermal growth of high quality ZnO NW arrays simultaneously, a thin gold film was coated onto the fiber substrate. Meanwhile, MnO2 was deposited on ZnO NWs to enhance the specific capacitance. The fiber SC demonstrated specific capacitances of 0.21 mF cm−2 (0.01 mF cm−1) using the 1 M KNO3 electrolyte and 2.4 mF cm−2 (0.2 mF cm−1) using a gel electrolyte. Due to a double twisted structure, the direct contact of the two fiber electrodes could occur sometimes, and it will be more serious during bending, which may cause severe leakage current and even short circuit. Though the obtained power and energy density were poor, this new fiber SC (FSC) successfully established a methodology to develop wearable energy storage devices.

(a) Fiber micro-SC made from two fiber ZnO NW electrodes.93 (b) FSC based on two fiber electrodes and a helical spacer wire.94 (c) A two-ply yarn SC based on CNTs and PANI NW arrays.98 (d) FSC fabricated from two twined GF@3D-Gs.100 (e) A coaxial FSC consists of carbon microfiber bundles coated with MWCNTs as a core electrode and carbon nanofiber paper as an outer electrode.103 
When a helical spacer wire was introduced, a novel and efficient tri-helix structured FSC consisting of three fiber electrodes (two active electrodes and a spacer wire electrode) was developed by our group, as shown in Fig. 8b.94 Pen ink was directly adopted as the FSC active material and coated onto nickel wires, CFs and plastic fibers. High areal capacitances (19.5 mF cm−2), energy density (2.70 × 10−6 W h cm−2) and power density (9.07 mW cm−2) comparable to the reported values of some planar counterparts were achieved. Along with excellent rate capability and long cycling life of over 15000 cycles, the well-maintained capacitance of a flexible FSC under high curvature demonstrated high flexibility. In this FSC, the elaborated spacer wire played key functions in preventing the devicefrom short circuit, allowing for efficient ion transport and scalable preparation of large-size FSCs as well.
Afterwards, FSCs have drawn much more attention and rapid progress in material diversity has been made.95–105 For instance, two aligned MWCNT fibers were employed as electrodes to produce twisted wire-shaped micro-SCs.95 FSC showed specific capacitances of 3.01 mF cm−2 and 13.31 F g−1 respectively, which were less than satisfactory with the incorporation of pseudocapacitive MnO2 nanoparticles into the composite MWCNT fibers. Based on the same twisted structure, PANI or ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) was incorporated into MWCNT fibers to improve the performance. Correspondingly, flexible and weavable micro-SC wires with a specific capacitance of 274 F g−1 (ref. 96) or 39.7 mF cm−2 (ref. 97) were reported, respectively. Wang et al. developed a two-ply yarn and thread-like SC that was formed by two CNT yarns infiltrated with PANI NW arrays, which is shown in Fig. 8c.98 The well-defined PANI NW arrays were proved to be effective to accommodate the mechanical stress changes. Accordingly, the resulting FSC is highly flexible and can be easily woven or knitted into conventional fabrics.
Also, attractive and promising graphene materials were investigated in FSCs. Through electrochemical reduction of GO on Au wire, Shi and coworkers prepared a flexible fiber-shaped solid electrochemical capacitor with good rate capability.99 The corresponding performance can be easily modulated by controlling the electrodeposition conditions. Meng et al. reported all-graphene core–sheath fibers for flexible and stretchable fibriform SCs (Fig. 8d).100 The all-graphene fiber electrode (GF@3D-G) was comprised of a graphene fiber core and a sheath of 3D interpenetrated porous graphene network. To obtain an all-solid-state FSC, two GF@3D-Gs were intertwined together with H2SO4–PVA gel which acted as both an electrolyte and a separator. Owing to the intrinsic high conductivity and mechanical flexibility of GF in combination with highly exposed surfaces of graphene sheets, moderate capacitances of ca. 1.2–1.7 mF cm−2 (ca. 25–40 F g−1) were reported. The GF@3D-G FSC was highly compressible, stretchable and flexible, which can be further woven into a textile without performance loss. Further, to make use of the benefits of 1D CNT and 2D graphene, graphene–CNT hybrid fibers were fabricated and woven into textile electrodes to construct flexible SCs,101 which showed acceptable tolerance during bending cycles.
Apart from the double twisted-structured FSCs and trihelix-structured FSCs, coaxial single FSCs were recently reported. By sequentially depositing ink, gel electrolyte, activated carbon and silver paints onto a stainless steel wire via simple dip-coating, a coaxial single FSC was attained.102 Lee and colleagues presented a coaxial FSC that consisted of MWCNT coated carbon microfiber (CMF) bundles as a core electrode and carbon nanofiber (CNF) paper as an outer electrode, as illustrated in Fig. 8e.103 The FSC capacitance reached 6.3 mF cm−1 (86.8 mF cm−2) and the energy density was measured to be 0.7 μW h cm−1 (9.8 μW h cm−2) at a power density of 13.7 μW cm−1 (189.4 μW cm−2). In particular, the relatively good performance was attributed to the effective surface area of the coaxial structure and high conductivity of all-carbon materials. In another attempt, coaxial FSC was produced from an aligned CNT fiber electrode and CNT sheet electrode with a gel electrolyte sandwiched between them.104 The coaxial FSC showed good mechanical flexibility and stretchability. A specific capacitance of 81.6% can be maintained after being stretched by 10% for 75 cycles.
It is noteworthy that a novel technology of gradient biscrolling was exploited to produce weavable, braidable and knottable biscrolled yarn SCs with outstanding energy storage and power performance.105 The yarn SCs were built on PEDOT-infiltrated CNT biscrolled yarns (Fig. 9a–c). An exceptionally high volumetric capacitance of up to ∼179 F cm−3, areal capacitance of 73 mF cm−2 (at 1 V s−1) and prominent rate capability (Fig. 9d) were obtained. For the complete SC, exceptionally high power (40 W cm−3) and energy (1.4 mW h cm−3) were observed, which are even higher than certain commercial SCs. The exciting performance mainly originated from the accessible yarn porosity, the continuous pathway for fast ion transport, and the topology of the biscrolled yarns, as well as the good adhesion and low contact resistance between the biscrolled yarns and the Pt wire current collector. Fig. 9e displays a flexible yarn SC that has been woven into a glove. Indeed, the yarn SC performance was little affected during bending or long-time cycling. This work set a good example that if only the fibrous active electrodes are appropriately designed, FSCs can not only offer the advantage of weavability, but also realize comparable performance to (even exceeding) that of existing flat SCs.

4. Fiber supercapacitors for integrated or hybrid energy systems
In general, FSCs are highly attractive because they could also act as efficient constituent parts or building blocks, and be easily integrated or shaped to construct multifunctional or self-powered hybrid energy systems. Wang and his coworkers reported the first creative invention of integrating energy converters and storage devices along a single micro-sized PMMA fiber.106 The single fiber power system consists of a DSSC, a nanogenerator, and a SC, which can simultaneously harvest solar and mechanical energy, and store it in the SCs. ZnO NWs and graphene were used as the basic active electrode materials for the hybrid fiber power system, as presented in Fig. 10a. However, the performance of each energy device was independently characterized, and the results related to the efficiency of the entire hybrid system were not shown. Based on the concept of FSCs, our group proposed a new integrated power fiber formed by a DSSC and a FSC, which can convert solar energy into electricity and subsequently store electricity as chemical energy.107 An active PANI coated stainless steel wire electrode was jointly shared by the DSSC and the FSC (Fig. 10b). The overall energy conversion efficiency of the integrated power fiber reached 2.1%, and the stored energy in the FSC charged by the DSSC can be used to light a red LED. The fabrication of the fiber integrated device is facile and easy to scale-up. This work demonstrated a feasible approach to produce inexpensive, high efficiency, flexible and self-powered fiber energy integration systems. Similarly, an integrated energy wire consisting of a DSSC and FSC was developed, as shown in Fig. 10c.108 The integrated energy wire was made from aligned TiO2 nanotubes and CNT fibers, which exhibited an overall efficiency of 1.5%.

Apart from serving as an energy storage component in a hybrid fiber system for both energy scavenging and storage, multiple FSCs can be integrated to SC modules to meet a variety of operating voltages and energy demand. Fig. 10d shows an integrated FSC assembly with three flexible FSCs connected in series.109 Every individual FSC was gained by two core–shell structured CF/MnO2 fibrous electrodes that were parallelly placed and H3PO4/PVA electrolytes. A high rate capability of 20 V s−1 scan rate, volume capacitance of 2.5 F cm−3 and energy density of 2.2 × 10−4 Wh cm−3 were achieved. When combined with a triboelectric generator, the FSC integration can form a self-powered system, which was confirmed to efficiently power a commercial liquid crystal display or LED. Shen and co-workers also described a new type of flexible planar-integrated FSCs through the alignment of fiber electrodes on a flexible substrate, which can be observed from Fig. 10e.110 The composite fiber electrode was acquired from hierarchical ZnCo2O4 NW arrays grown on CFs. The specific capacitance of the planar-integrated FSCs showed an obvious rising trend as the number of fiber electrodes increased, which was ascribed to a distributed-capacitance effect according to the researcher's interpretation. Despite that more improvement is required as to the electrochemical performance, the planar-integrated FSCs illustrated a novel method for constructing multifunctional, size-minimized and flexible 2D modules from 1D fiber device units.
Though the FSC research field is relatively new, it is currently full of vigor and active mind. Considering the unique merits of FSCs and their significant importance in flexible/wearable energy storage devices and integrated electronic systems, there are some useful generalizations for future work to maximize the great potential toward practical applications. First, high-performance materials and FSCs still remain an issue. On account of the lightweight, conductivity and high strength, CFs, CNT fibers and graphene fibers may be good candidates for flexible substrates. However, efficient, mechanically stable and nanostructured active materials that are compatible with the fibrous substrate should be developed to achieve more efficient FSCs. Perhaps mix-spun and biscrolling techniques can provide enlightenment to acquire ideal composite yarn electrodes. Second, FSCs are definitely suitable for building highly efficient micro-energy storage devices, which will particularly favor the development of miniaturized, embedded, flexible/stretchable, weavable and self-powered hybrid energy systems, even if FSCs can achieve considerable performance. Third, more attention on several technical challenges including interface engineering, the production of strong yarn electrodes, low cost, large-scale assembly of FSC units and textile modules is quite necessary.
5. Summary and outlook
In association with the delightful electrochemical performance, mechanical flexibility, low-cost and lightweight, flexible SCs are undoubtedly emerging as promising renewable energy technology for future energy storage systems. The rapid progress made on flexible SCs has further proven their immense potential. Whether the flexible planar SCs are built on plastics, papers or on fabrics/textiles, high capacitances, excellent rate capability, considerable specific power and energy, and long cycling life have been achieved by applying active nanocarbon materials such as CNTs, graphenes, etc., in conjunction with suitable modifications for improving the conductivity and accessible surface area of the flexible substrate. Generally the incorporation of nanostructured metal oxides and conducting polymers can always make significant pseudocapacitive contribution to enhance the capacitive performance of flexible SCs. Regarding the new research area, FSCs commonly based on metal wires, CFs, CNT fibers and graphene fibers have realized acceptable and comparable electrochemical performance to their planar counterparts. The unique 1D architecture and weavable feature of FSCs will further boost the development of highly flexible/wearable electronics and integrated fiber power devices.
Despite the above mentioned impressive achievements, there still remains a challenge to further develop high-performance flexible SCs which can simultaneously ensure high energy and power capacities toward practical applications. According to the related publications, it can be noticed that current studies are still at the initial stage and focused on basic electrochemical performance, while much less attention is paid to the mechanical properties of flexible SCs. In particular, the lack of a unified evaluation system is a problem as reported values in terms of specific capacitance, power and energy density are quite confusing. It is better to provide the performance for the complete device when considering the practical application requirements. Looking forward, more efficient and innovative materials will hold the key. Abundant, electroactive, flexible carbon materials with high conductivity and large specific area are still showing prospects for building high cost-performance flexible SCs. The development of efficient composite electrodes, e.g. carbon–metal oxide composites, core–shell nanostructures, may be an important research direction. Also, further understanding of the interface properties and collaborative optimization of SC components (substrate, active film, electrolyte and separator) could maximize the device performance. Furthermore, printable SCs, self-powered energy devices and high-performance flexible hybrid/integrated systems including SC units will probably attract more interest.
