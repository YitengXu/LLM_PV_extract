    , Accepted 16th July 2020First published on 16th July 2020AbstractVisible light-driven H2 production contributes to an efficient solar energy conversion. Here, we demonstrate a visible light-driven, mediator-free H2 production system by coupling a photosensitizer and a genetically engineered whole-cell biocatalyst: Escherichia coli expressing clostridial [FeFe]-hydrogenase and maturase genes. The system consists of three components: a photosensitizer, eosin Y; an electron donor, triethanolamine; and the E. coli whole-cell biocatalyst. Under light irradiation, the whole-cell-based system formed H2 without an additional electron mediator and achieved a high apparent quantum yield at 530 nm (over 10%). This whole-cell-based system provides simple, efficient, and clean H2 production.
Introduction
H2 production via photocatalytic water splitting contributes to efficient solar energy utilization.1–4 With the aim of developing an efficient light-driven H2 production system, researchers have focused on a hybrid system coupling an H2-forming biocatalyst with an abiotic light energy-conversion material, such as inorganic semiconductors5–9 or molecular photosensitizers.10–12 These biocatalysis-based hybrid systems, which catalyze highly efficient, selective, and environmentally benign reactions, will provide a new H2 production system for achieving a sustainable low-carbon society.13,14
The use of a whole-cell-based biocatalyst, instead of a purified enzyme, is a promising approach for developing an inorganic–bio hybrid system as costly protein purification can be avoided. For example, light-driven CO2 fixation was accomplished using non-photosynthetic Moorella thermoacetica with bacterially-precipitated CdS nanoparticles as photosensitizers.15,16 A similar approach has been used for light-driven H2 production using whole cells of Escherichia coli with self-precipitated CdS17 and AgInS2/In2S3 (ref.18) nanoparticles or externally added TiO2.19 These systems used E. coli whole cells without genetic engineering as E. coli possesses endogenous [NiFe]-hydrogenase involved in anaerobic H2 fermentation. However, in these E. coli-based systems, light-driven H2 formation required supplementation of glucose for H2 fermentation, indicating that the photoexcited electrons were not directly delivered from the semiconductor to endogenous hydrogenase despite the redox potential of the conduction bands of CdS, AgInS2/In2S3, and TiO2 being satisfactory for driving proton reduction. Such a complicated electron pathway, from a semiconductor to H2, restricts further improvement in system efficiency.
We also developed an inorganic–bio hybrid H2 production system using the combination of an inorganic semiconductor, such as TiO2, and whole cells of genetically engineered E. coli expressing the genes encoding [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydA) and its maturases from Clostridium acetobutylicum.20–22 [FeFe]-hydrogenase with extremely high H2-formation activity is suitable as a biocatalyst component of an H2-production system.23 Similar to purified HydA, the whole cells of E. coli possessing HydA genes can serve as the biocatalyst part of the hybrid system. Notably, simple electron relay from a semiconductor to intracellular HydA mediated by methylviologen (MV) was observed in this system20–22 unlike other E. coli whole-cell-based systems.17–19 In addition, the host strain, E. coli BL21(DE3), exhibited no detectable H2 decomposition activity: this contributes to the high yield of light-driven H2 formation of the hybrid system.21 Indeed, the system, which consisted of TiO2, the whole-cell biocatalyst, an electron donor (Tris), and MV, exhibited highly efficient photocatalytic H2 production with 31% apparent quantum yield under 350 nm light (AQY350).21 However, the system was not capable of utilizing visible light (AQY420 = 0.1%)21 because it used wide band gap TiO2. Whereas progress has been made in developing a visible light-driven inorganic–bio hybrid by applying an oxynitride photocatalyst such as GaN:ZnO, which responds to visible light up to 520 nm, further improvement of the system is still required.22 Furthermore, the well-known toxicity of MV also hampers the practical application of this system. Therefore, a new E. coli whole-cell-based, visible light-driven, mediator-free H2 production system must be developed.
Molecular photosensitizers have been used as part of light-driven biocatalysis.24–28 The commercially available, low-cost, metal-free xanthene dye, eosin Y (EY, maximum absorbance λmax in water = 517 nm) (or its derivative, 5′-carboxyeosin Y) is widely applied in visible light-driven biocatalysis, including H2 production coupled with [NiFeSe]-hydrogenase purified from Desulfomicrobium baculatum10 or the purified recombinant [FeFe]-hydrogenase derived from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrHydA1).11,12 Such photosensitizer/enzyme systems revealed that hydrogenase could form H2 by directly receiving photoexcited electrons from EY with sacrificial electron donors, such as triethanolamine (TEOA), without the addition of any electron mediator.10–12 In addition, EY is also applied as an intracellular photosensitizer in whole-cell-based, light-driven biocatalysis.24 For example, EY (or its derivatives) was applied to the recombinant E. coli whole-cell-based, light-driven P450 catalysis29 and multi-component Rieske oxygenase reactions,30 or whole cells of Shewanella oneidensis with MV for light-driven H2 evolution or CC and CO bond hydrogenation.28 Based on these EY abilities, we expected that EY as part of the new hybrid system had the possibility of achieving visible light-driven and external mediator-free H2 production by coupling with whole cells of recombinant E. coli expressing HydA genes.
The objective of this study was to develop a new visible light-driven and external mediator-free H2 production system based on recombinant E. coli whole-cell biocatalysis (Fig. 1). In this report, we describe three investigations: 1) demonstration of EY photoredox cycle applicability in recombinant E. coli whole-cell-based H2 formation; 2) examination of the advantages of using an E. coli whole-cell biocatalyst; and 3) H2 production performance evaluation of the newly developed system.

Experimental
Materials
Analytical grade chemicals were used. Disodium eosin Y and TiO2 P-25 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St Louis. MO, USA). BugBuster® 10X protein extraction reagent, Benzonase® nuclease, purity >90%, rLysozyme™ solution, and Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filters were purchased from Merck Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). A Strep-Tactin® Superflow 1 ml gravity flow column and D-desthiobiotin were obtained from IBA GmbH (Göttingen, Germany). A TaKaRa BCA protein assay kit was obtained from Takara Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan). All aqueous solutions were prepared using Milli-Q water. For O2-free experiments, aqueous solutions and plastic tubes and tips were stored for at least five days in a N2 atmosphere (O2 concentration <1 ppm) in a glove box (UNICO Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan).
Microorganism and expression plasmid vectors

E. coli BL21(DE3) (Merck Millipore) was used as the host. The expression vectors, pEHydEA and pCHydFG,20 harboring [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydA) and maturase genes (hydA, hydE, hydF, and hydG) from C. acetobutylicum NBRC 13948, and their parent empty vectors, pETDuet-1 and pCDFDuet-1 (Merck Millipore), were transformed into the host BL21(DE3) to obtain E. coli BL21(DE3)/pEHydEA + pCHydFG [E. coli (Hyd+)] or E. coli BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-1 + pCDFDuet-1 [E. coli (Hyd-)].
HydA gene expression and whole-cell biocatalyst preparation

E. coli (Hyd+) or E. coli (Hyd−) were routinely grown in LB Miller medium (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin and 40 μg ml−1 streptomycin. For gene expression and whole cell biocatalyst preparation, E. coli Hyd+ was aerobically grown in 400 ml LB Miller medium supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin, 40 μg ml−1 streptomycin, 250 μg ml−1 ferric ammonium citrate, and 100 mM 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH) in a 2 l Erlenmeyer flask at 37 °C and 150 rpm, until OD600 reached 0.4. Then, the culture was transferred to Nalgene™ PPCO centrifuge bottles with sealing closure (3141-0500PK) and cysteine (final concentration, 2 mM) and disodium fumarate (20 mM) were added to the culture. The culture in the centrifuge bottle was then transferred into a glove box and the genes were induced by adding 0.1 mM IPTG; cultivation continued for 20 h at room temperature (25 °C) with stirring. After gene induction, the centrifuge bottle was removed from the glove box and the cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000g, 10 min, 4 °C). After centrifugation, the bottle was returned to the glove box and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (0.2 g l−1 KH2PO4, 0.2 g l−1 KCl, 1.15 g l−1 Na2HPO4, and 8 g l−1 NaCl) and the resulting suspension was used as the whole-cell suspension. A suspension of E. coli Hyd− was obtained via the same procedure and used as the negative control.
HydA purification
Recombinant HydA purification was performed using the Strep-Tactin system as previously reported.20 Recombinant HydA was produced as a Strep-II-tagged protein in E. coli Hyd+. All purification manipulations were performed in the glove box. The E. coli cells were suspended in 5 ml of lysis solution containing 0.5 ml of BugBuster 10× solution, 125 U of Benzonase nuclease, and 6 kU of rLysozyme solution in PBS and stirred for 20 min at room temperature. To remove cell debris, the lysed cell suspension was centrifuged at 14100g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected as a cell-free extract (CFE) and applied to a 1 ml Strep-Tactin Superflow column equilibrated with PBS. The column with absorbed HydA was washed with five column volumes (CVs) of PBS, and the purified enzyme was eluted with PBS containing 2.5 mM D-desthiobiotin. Protein concentrations were measured using a TaKaRa BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol; bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Protein synthesis and purification were assessed by SDS-PAGE.
H2 formation specific activity
H2 formation specific activities of whole-cell E. coli and purified HydA were determined as the rate of H2 formation with MV2+ chemically reduced by sodium dithionite. A reaction solution consisted of the biocatalyst (whole-cell suspension or purified HydA), 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7), 5 mM MV2+, and 25 mM sodium dithionite under a N2 atmosphere in a 10 ml glass vial sealed with an aluminum cap and rubber septum. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C, initiated by adding sodium dithionite solution, and terminated by adding 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid solution. The amount of H2 formed in the headspace was detected using gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-2010, Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a molecular sieve 5A column. Ar gas was used as a carrier gas.
Photocatalytic H2 production
Photocatalytic H2 production was performed using a gas circulating system connected to a GC-TCD (GC-3210; GL Science, Tokyo, Japan) with a molecular sieve 5A column and monochromatic LED light sources (LED385/L-STND, LED420/L-STND, LED470/L-STND, LED530/L-STND, LED590/L-STND and LED630/L-STND; Optocode Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) or an AM1.5G solar simulator (HAL-320, Asahi Spectra Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as an external light source. The light intensity from the solar simulator was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5G) using a 1 SUN intensity checker (CS-20, Asahi Spectra Co., Ltd.). Ar gas was used as the circulating carrier. In a typical reaction, 30 ml of the reaction mixture containing 0.1 mM EY, 100 mM TEOA–HCl (pH 8), and the biocatalyst (0.1 g-wet cell of whole-cell E. coli) was prepared in a quartz reaction vessel with valves to prevent oxygen exposure inside the glove box (N2 atmosphere). After the vessel was connected to the gas circulating system, the system was evacuated to remove N2 from the glove box atmosphere and filled with Ar gas. When starting the reaction, the pressure of the system was adjusted to about −70 kPa. During light irradiation, the reaction mixture was agitated with a magnetic stirring bar. The reaction was initiated by light irradiation and the amount of H2 was analyzed using a GC-TCD connected to the circulating line with a gas sampling valve.
UV-vis spectra
UV-vis spectra were measured using a V-670-G (JASCO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
Apparent quantum yield for photocatalytic H2 production
The apparent quantum yield (AQY) with monochromatic LED light was calculated as AQY (%) = 100 × (2 mol H2 formed) × (mol incident photons)−1. The incident photon flux by LED light irradiation was calculated from the light power measured using a Si photodiode S2281 (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Shizuoka, Japan). The value of light power (W cm−2) was measured using a Si photodiode.
Results and discussion
Demonstration of EY photoredox cycle applicability in recombinant E. coli whole-cell-based H2 formation
To demonstrate the applicability of EY in E. coli whole-cell-based H2 formation, light-driven H2 production through coupling EY and the E. coli whole cells (EY/whole-cell system) and its optimal pH were investigated.

Fig. 2a shows the amounts of H2 formed under 530 nm LED light irradiation from a 30 ml reaction solution containing 0.1 mM EY and 0.1 g wet cell of recombinant E. coli cells in 100 mM TEOA (pH 7.0, adjusted by HCl) at 25 °C. Turnover numbers (TONs) for H2 formation based on the added EY (mol-H2 per mol-EY) are shown in Fig. 2a. The H2 formation-specific activity of the whole cells of E. coli (Hyd+) in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7) (average ± standard deviation, n = 3) was 0.320 ± 0.023 μmol-H2 per min per mg-wet-cell (the capacity of H2 formation added to the system was approximately 1.9 × 103 μmol-H2 per h); that of E. coli (Hyd−) was not detected. Light-driven H2 formation was observed in the combination of EY and whole cells of E. coli (Hyd+) (indicated as “EY/whole cell (Hyd+)” in Fig. 2a). No or trace amounts of H2 were formed during the negative control experiments—this included EY with whole cells of E. coli (Hyd−) [EY/whole cell (Hyd−)], whole cells of E. coli (Hyd+) without EY [whole cell (Hyd+)], and EY only (EY). Light-driven H2-formation by EY/whole-cell (Hyd+) was wavelength-dependent (Fig. S1a†), similar to that by the combination of 5′-carboxyeosin Y (λmax = 516 nm) and purified CrHydA1.11 A few micromoles of H2 were formed from reactions of the EY/Hyd+ system without TEOA (Fig. S2†), indicating that a component of the E. coli cells hardly behaved as an electron donor. H2 formation required EY, TEOA, and the H2-forming whole-cell E. coli, indicating that the photoexcited EY and TEOA facilitated H2 formation by HydA without the need for addition of an external electron mediator.
 Fig. 2  Light-driven H2 production by the EY/whole-cell system. (a) Amount of H2 formed under 530 nm LED irradiation. Standard reaction conditions: 30 ml of 100 mM TEOA–HCl (pH 7), 0.1 mM EY, and 0.1 g-wet cell of the E. coli whole cell biocatalyst, at 25 °C. Whole cell (Hyd+), whole cells of E. coli (Hyd+); whole cell (Hyd−), whole cells of E. coli (Hyd−). (b) Amount of H2 formed by coupling 0.1 mM EY and 0.1 g-wet cell of whole cells of E. coli (Hyd+) in 100 mM TEOA–HCl at various pH values from 6 to 8.5. Incident photon rate, 1.65 × 10−5 mol-photons per min. 

Fig. 2b shows the effects of pH on light-driven H2 formation by the EY/whole-cell system in 100 mM TEOA. Under pH conditions above 7.5, the H2-formation rates were almost the same (61 μmol h−1) in the first 1 h of irradiation; those at pH 6 and pH 7 decreased to 46% and 85%, respectively. The low system activity at an acidic pH can be explained by an increase of protonated TEOA (pKa = 7.8), which is not capable of behaving as an electron donor.10,31,32 The optimal pH for the EY/whole-cell system is related to the optimal pH for H2 formation by HydA. The optimal pH for H2 formation of whole cells of E. coli (Hyd+) with chemically reduced MV was pH 8 in TEOA–HCl buffer (Fig. S3†). Morra et al. also reported an optimal pH of 8 for H2 formation of purified HydA derived from C. acetobutylicum in Tris-HCl buffer.33 However, because the EY/whole-cell system utilized just a small percentage of H2-formation capacity of the whole cells added to the system based on the H2-formation rate of the system during light irradiation, the photoredox cycle of EY and TEOA had a large effect on the H2-formation rate. Based on these results, pH 8 was adopted for the subsequent experiments.
The advantages of using an E. coli whole-cell biocatalyst
To demonstrate the advantage of using E. coli whole-cell light-driven H2 production, coupling of EY with different biocatalysts [E. coli whole-cells, cell-free extract (CFE), and purified HydA] was investigated.
All EY/biocatalyst systems formed H2 under light irradiation (Fig. 3). The amounts of H2 formed in the first 1 h of irradiation were almost the same, suggesting that the cell membrane did not function as a barrier for electron transfer from photoexcited EY to HydA despite the existence of the cell wall under the tested conditions. Generally, the cell permeability for substrates and products is a major challenge for efficient whole-cell-based reactions. Interestingly, the uptake problems of EY and TEOA have not been reported in recombinant E. coli whole-cell-based systems,29,30 including the system mentioned in the present study. In contrast, light-driven biocatalysis through the combination of EY, TEOA, and whole cells of S. oneidensis requires an electron mediator, such as MV.28 It is unclear why light-driven reactions can be easily carried out in E. coli-based systems with EY; however, this external mediator-free reaction is appealing in terms of the use of E. coli whole-cell-based systems.
 Fig. 3  Light-driven H2 production by EY with various biocatalysts systems. (a) Amount of H2 formed under 530 nm LED irradiation. Standard reaction conditions: 30 ml of 100 mM TEOA–HCl (pH 8), and 0.1 mM EY and biocatalysts at 25 °C. As biocatalysts, 0.1 g-wet cell of whole cells of E. coli (Hyd+) or a cell free extract (CFE) prepared from 0.1 g-wet cell of E. coli (Hyd+) were added to the system. The H2-forming activity of the 0.1 g-wet cell of E. coli (Hyd+) based on the reaction in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7) with 5 mM reduced MV was approximately 30 U (one U is defined as one μmol-H2 per min). Therefore, 30 U of the purified HydA solution was added to the EY/purified HydA system. The activity (U μl−1) of the HydA solution was measured at the period immediately before conducting the light irradiation reaction. (b) Reaction system consisted of 30 ml of 100 mM TEOA–HCl (pH 8), 0.1 mM EY, and 30 U of purified HydA (EY/purified HydA) supplemented with 1 mM MV2+ (EY/MV/purified HydA) or CFE prepared from 0.1 g-wet cell of E. coli (Hyd−) [EY/purified HydA + CFE (Hyd−)]. Incident photon rate, 1.65 × 10−5 mol-photons per min. 
Additionally, the high stability of a whole-cell biocatalyst is an advantage compared to that of a purified enzyme. As shown in Fig. 3a, the EY/whole-cell system and EY/CFE system exhibited greater durability than the EY/purified HydA system. Similar to other EY-based, light-driven H2 formation with a cobalt catalyst,31 EY photobleaching is key to the durability of light-driven H2 production. Fig. S4a and b† show the UV-vis absorbance spectra of the reaction solution of the EY/whole-cell and EY/purified HydA systems before and after light irradiation for a total of 12 h as shown in Fig. 3a. As shown in Fig. S4a and b,† after 12 h of light irradiation, the 516 nm EY peak from the EY/whole-cell solution diminished to approximately 30%, whereas that from EY/purified HydA almost disappeared. A relationship between H2-formation rate and residual EY during light irradiation was also observed in parallel experiments. During light-driven H2 production using the EY/whole-cell system with various added concentrations of EY and whole cells (Fig. S5†), the EY/whole cell system with 0.5 mM EY formed more H2 with a total of 12 h of light irradiation compared to the EY/whole cell system with 0.1 mM EY. The H2-formation rate decreased in EY/whole cells with 0.5 mM EY not being clearly observed, and, indeed, the EY peak in UV-vis absorbance spectra after light irradiation was not significantly diminished (Fig. S4c†). In contrast, as shown in Fig. S4d and e,† EY photobleaching was also observed in the reaction of EY only or EY with whole cell (Hyd−) as in Fig. 2a, suggesting that active HydA inhibited EY photobleaching. HydA seems to be more stable inside the whole cells or with CFE than its purified form; this stabilized HydA avoids EY photobleaching. Further, this high stability of the EY/whole-cell system is one of the advantages of using whole-cell biocatalysis. The relationship between the termination of light-driven H2 formation and the photobleaching of EY was further investigated by successive addition of EY to the system. The EY addition partially revived the light-driven H2 formation after the reaction was almost stopped, supporting that EY photobleaching was a main reason for the termination of the reaction (see Results and discussion, and Fig. S6–S8 and Table S1 in the ESI†).
Furthermore, in the EY/purified HydA system, continuous, light-driven H2 production was observed by supplementation with MV (Fig. 3b). The coexistence of MV in EY/purified HydA remarkably decreased the rates of light-driven H2 formation, but H2 formation continued after three 4 h sets of light irradiation. This H2-formation durability was caused by avoiding EY bleaching during light irradiation as shown in Fig. S4f.† In the presence of TEOA, there are two routes for quenching photoexcited EY (EY*) (Fig. S9†). If there is no appropriate destination for the electron donation from the photoredox cycle of EY, which exhibits a low redox potential (EY+˙/EY*, −0.87 V vs. NHE; EY/EY−˙, −1.07 V vs. NHE),31 unfavored electron donation from the EY photoredox cycle (besides providing an electron to form H2 from HydA) can occur. This causes EY photobleaching and HydA deactivation. Based on reports of the photobleaching of EY and other xanthene dyes,34–36 MV2+ seems to act as a stabilizer of EY in the EY/purified HydA system during a series of rapid reactions; besides, MV˙+ acts as an electron donor for H2 evolution by HydA. The electron transfer from EY* to MV2+ forms EY˙+–MV˙+, and then the electron returns from MV˙+ to EY˙+, yielding EY and MV2+. These reactions competitively suppressed H2 formation by HydA, but also avoided the unfavored electron transfer from EY* to EY itself or HydA in the EY/purified HydA system. Components involved in whole cells or CFE can act in a manner similar to that exhibited by MV.
Performance evaluation of the newly developed system
The light-driven H2-formation performance of the EY/whole-cell system was evaluated.
The amounts of EY and biocatalyst added to the system had no effects on the light-driven H2-formation rates (Fig. S5†). Therefore, under the tested conditions, H2 formation was limited by light intensity.
The values of AQY530 calculated with the H2-formation rate during the first 1 h of reaction depend on the light intensity, and these values reached above 10% (Fig. 4). The AQY decreases with increasing light intensity, similar to that observed in other EY/hydrogenase systems.10 AQYs under several wavelength irradiations are shown in Fig. S1b† based on the calculations in Table S2.†
 Fig. 4  Effects of light intensities on light-driven H2 formation by the EY/whole-cell system. (a) Amount of H2 formed by the EY/whole-cell system under 530 nm light at various light intensities. (b) AQY530 calculated based on the amounts of H2 formed and incident photons in the first 1 h of light irradiation. AQY (%) = 100 × (2 mol H2 formed) × (mol incident photons)−1. 
The AQY530 of our system is higher than that reported for the bio-based EY/MV/S. oneidensis system (0.6% at 500 nm),28 and EY with an abiotic cobalt-based catalyst system (4% at 520 nm).31 Whereas the quantum yield was low in the EY/MV/S. oneidensis system, its remarkable durability for light-driven H2 formation (over 4 d) was reported.28 Our E. coli-based system is appealing in AQY and external mediator-free contexts; however, the system durability is low (10 h under strong light irradiation as shown in Fig. 4a) owing to EY photobleaching in the absence of MV. Notably, though MV supplementation decreases the light-driven H2-formation rate of the EY/whole-cell system (AQY530 = 0.5%), sustained H2 formation was observed for 5 d (Fig. S10†). This is caused by no H2 decomposition activity by endogenous enzymes of the host E. coli.
Additionally, light-driven H2 production of the EY/whole-cell system was performed with an AM1.5G solar simulator (Fig. 5). Under stronger light irradiation than that provided by a LED, the EY/whole-cell system with 0.5 mM EY exhibited a higher H2-formation rate. In comparison to the previous inorganic–bio hybrid system (TiO2 P-25/MV/whole cell),21 the new EY/whole-cell system features greater H2 formation under irradiation by an AM1.5G solar light simulator. The amounts of H2 formed after 24 h light irradiation by the EY/whole-cell and TiO2 P-25/MV/whole cell systems reached 830 μmol and 157 μmol, respectively. However, whereas the H2 formation was almost terminated after 20 h light irradiation in the EY/whole-cell system, a linear increase in H2 formation was observed in the TiO2 P-25/MV/whole cell system even after 24 h of light irradiation. Though the system durability of EY/whole cell system should be improved by further investigations, the application of the visible light responsive photosensitizer to the system is effective in improving the solar energy conversion compared with the previous system employing TiO2.

The EY/whole cell system consisted of 100 mM TEOA–HCl (pH 8), 5 mM EY, and 0.1 g-wet cell of E. coli (Hyd+). The P-25/MV/whole cell system consisted of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7), 5 mM MV, and 0.1 g-wet cell of E. coli (Hyd+). Light, AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 (area, 3 cm × 3 cm). 
Limitations and future directions
In future investigations, we plan to conduct 1) the screening of photosensitizers, 2) the screening of electron mediators, and 3) the replacement of the sacrificial electron donor, for further improvement of the system.
Efficiencies of the photoredox cycle and the electron donation from the photosensitizer to the biocatalyst are bottlenecks for the overall performance of photocatalytic H2 production by the new system. The screening of photosensitizers could contribute to improving the system as Adam et al. reported the significant differences for light-driven hydrogen formation by purified CrHydA1 with various pairs of photosensitizers and electron donors.11
The system achieved mediator-free photocatalytic H2 production with high AQY. However, this mediator-free reaction is not durable, even though the whole-cell-based system is more stable than the purified HydA system. The addition of the electron mediator, MV, decreased the AQY for H2 formation, but, in fact, dramatically increased the stability of the system. In-depth understanding of the role of the electron mediator, and applying a non-toxic natural electron mediator, such as ferredoxin from coexpression, could enhance either the AQY or the system stability.
The replacement of the sacrificial electron donor (TEOA) with an abundant electron source, ideally water, must be addressed for complete water splitting. This is possibly achieved with physically-separated, two-compartment photoelectrochemical reactions. The new system contributes to the future development of an efficient solar-to-H2 system as a reductive half-reaction component of water splitting.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed a new visible light-driven, external mediator-free, and highly efficient H2 production system based on the combination of the photoredox cycle of a photosensitizer with a whole-cell biocatalyst. In addition to easy biocatalyst preparation, our results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using EY and E. coli whole-cell biocatalysis in the development of a simple, three-component system consisting of a photosensitizer, biocatalyst, and electron donor for light-driven H2 formation.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Photocatalytic H2 production by a combination of a photosensitizer (EY), electron donor (TEOA), and recombinant whole-cell E. coli expressing [FeFe]-hydrogenase and its maturase genes. The photoredox cycle of EY facilitates H2 production using [FeFe]-hydrogenase located in the E. coli cell.	 

 	Fig. 2  Light-driven H2 production by the EY/whole-cell system. (a) Amount of H2 formed under 530 nm LED irradiation. Standard reaction conditions: 30 ml of 100 mM TEOA–HCl (pH 7), 0.1 mM EY, and 0.1 g-wet cell of the E. coli whole cell biocatalyst, at 25 °C. Whole cell (Hyd+), whole cells of E. coli (Hyd+); whole cell (Hyd−), whole cells of E. coli (Hyd−). (b) Amount of H2 formed by coupling 0.1 mM EY and 0.1 g-wet cell of whole cells of E. coli (Hyd+) in 100 mM TEOA–HCl at various pH values from 6 to 8.5. Incident photon rate, 1.65 × 10−5 mol-photons per min.	 

 	Fig. 3  Light-driven H2 production by EY with various biocatalysts systems. (a) Amount of H2 formed under 530 nm LED irradiation. Standard reaction conditions: 30 ml of 100 mM TEOA–HCl (pH 8), and 0.1 mM EY and biocatalysts at 25 °C. As biocatalysts, 0.1 g-wet cell of whole cells of E. coli (Hyd+) or a cell free extract (CFE) prepared from 0.1 g-wet cell of E. coli (Hyd+) were added to the system. The H2-forming activity of the 0.1 g-wet cell of E. coli (Hyd+) based on the reaction in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7) with 5 mM reduced MV was approximately 30 U (one U is defined as one μmol-H2 per min). Therefore, 30 U of the purified HydA solution was added to the EY/purified HydA system. The activity (U μl−1) of the HydA solution was measured at the period immediately before conducting the light irradiation reaction. (b) Reaction system consisted of 30 ml of 100 mM TEOA–HCl (pH 8), 0.1 mM EY, and 30 U of purified HydA (EY/purified HydA) supplemented with 1 mM MV2+ (EY/MV/purified HydA) or CFE prepared from 0.1 g-wet cell of E. coli (Hyd−) [EY/purified HydA + CFE (Hyd−)]. Incident photon rate, 1.65 × 10−5 mol-photons per min.	 

 	Fig. 4  Effects of light intensities on light-driven H2 formation by the EY/whole-cell system. (a) Amount of H2 formed by the EY/whole-cell system under 530 nm light at various light intensities. (b) AQY530 calculated based on the amounts of H2 formed and incident photons in the first 1 h of light irradiation. AQY (%) = 100 × (2 mol H2 formed) × (mol incident photons)−1.	 

 	Fig. 5  Light-driven H2 production by the E. coli whole-cell-based system with an AM1.5G solar simulator. The EY/whole cell system consisted of 100 mM TEOA–HCl (pH 8), 5 mM EY, and 0.1 g-wet cell of E. coli (Hyd+). The P-25/MV/whole cell system consisted of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7), 5 mM MV, and 0.1 g-wet cell of E. coli (Hyd+). Light, AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 (area, 3 cm × 3 cm).
