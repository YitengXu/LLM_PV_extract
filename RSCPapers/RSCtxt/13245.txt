In the last three decades, such an “embedding heteroatom” strategy has been actively explored in order to realize attractive electronic, optical, and electrochemical properties. This review aims to cover a variety of synthetic methodologies that have been developed for the construction of heteroatom-embedded porphyrins. Moreover, we also summarize their structure–property relationships as well as possible applications in various research fields including artificial photosynthesis, molecular engineering, organic electronics, and bioimaging.
1. Introduction
Porphyrin is an 18π-aromatic macrocycle consisting of four pyrrole units and four bridging carbon atoms with a square-planar conformation. Because porphyrin is a main skeleton of various natural products such as chlorophylls and hemes, it has been extensively studied for a long period in order to understand their roles in biological systems. Furthermore, recent studies have described that porphyrin exhibits dramatically altered electronic, optical, and electrochemical properties upon the peripheral modifications, hence attracting considerable attention in various research fields.1
For the purpose of granting novel functionalities to porphyrin, peripheral functionalization by heteroatoms has occupied an important position in porphyrin chemistry as underlined by the following advantages. (1) Heteroatoms can be easily set up and transformed to other functional groups by various well-established reactions including electrophilic substitution, dehydrative condensation, transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling, and nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr). (2) Diversity of heteroatoms (nitrogen, boron, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and so on) enables the tailor-made tuning of the electronic properties of the porphyrin core. (3) Heteroatoms themselves act as functional units such as Lewis acid/base, hydrogen-bond acceptors, and external coordination sites. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that coplanarization of the peripherally substituted heteroatoms into the extended π-system realized numerous intriguing electronic, optical, and structural properties which could be hardly observed in simple heteroatom-substituted porphyrins. Consequently, the resulting π-extended porphyrins containing planarized heteroatom(s) have offered their promising applications in diverse research fields including artificial photosynthesis, molecular engineering, organic electronics, and bioimaging.
In this review article, we define the term “heteroatom-embedded porphyrin” as a π-extended porphyrin having planarized heteroatom(s) on its direct periphery. Although a number of researchers have already summarized the chemistry of π-extended porphyrins,2–13 the “heteroatom-embedded porphyrins” were only sporadically seen in these reviews. Hence, we have set the purpose of this review article to provide a unified view from “heteroatom-embedded porphyrin chemistry” and evaluate the effect of the embedded heteroatoms on the functionalities. As necessary, selected examples of the analogous porphyrinoids will also be mentioned in this paper. However, π-extended porphyrins fused with heterocycles without sharing the heteroatoms are outside the scope of this review article. In addition, porphyrinoids bearing heteroatoms in the macrocyclic conjugations also fall outside the scope, since they have been reviewed elsewhere.14–16
Before summarizing the chemistry of heteroatom-embedded porphyrins, we have classified them into the following three categories (Scheme 1). (a) The first is β,β-heterocycle-fused porphyrins, whose heteroatoms at the β-positions are parts of the directly fused heterocyclic ring. (b) The second is β-heteroatom-embedded porphyrins, in which the β-attached heteroatom is anchored by the meso-substituent. (c) The last one is meso-heteroatom-embedded porphyrins, in which one or two β-substituents enforce the meso-heteroatom to be planar toward the porphyrin core.

2. β,β-Heterocycle-fused porphyrins
Most β,β-heterocycle-fused porphyrins can be prepared by simple transformations from readily accessible 5,10,15,20-tetraarylporphyrins. Hence, they have been investigated by a number of researchers for a long period, and numerous heterocycles such as pyrazine, quinoxaline, imidazole, triazole, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), 1,4-dithiine, indole, benzothiophene, phosphole, and benzosilole have been constructed at the β-positions. In this section, we summarize these β,β-heterocycle-fused porphyrins with regard to the fused-heterocycles.
2.1 Pyrazine- and quinoxaline-fused porphyrin
Dehydrative condensation of α-dione with 1,2-diamine is a reliable synthetic path to afford pyrazine and quinoxaline skeletons with high functional tolerance. The porphyrin analogue of α-dione is 17,18-dioxo-5,10,15,20-tetraarylchlorin 1, which is readily available from 5,10,15,20-tetraarylporphyrin 2via three routes passing through β-aminoporphyrin 3, β-hydroxyporphyrin 4, and 17,18-dihydroxychlorin 5, respectively (Scheme 2).17–19 In 1987, Crossley and co-workers subjected porphyrin-dione 1 to condensation with 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine tetrahydrochloride, and obtained rigidly bridged bis-porphyrin 6 as the first example of peripherally pyrazine-fused porphyrins (Scheme 2).20 Furthermore, they extended this strategy for the syntheses of the corresponding linear trimer 7 and tetramer 8,21,22L-shaped trimer 9,22 and redox-switchable dimers 10 and 11 (Scheme 3).23 In these oligomers, the porphyrin units are effectively conjugated through the fused pyrazinoquinoxaline linker, as evidenced by the red-shifted absorption bands and split first reduction potentials (ΔE = 0.17 V for 6a). Therefore, these authors have proposed that these pyrazinoquinoxaline-bridged porphyrin oligomers are a potential candidate of a molecular wire.4,24

After the pioneering work on the pyrazinoquinoxaline-linked porphyrin arrays, Crossley, Reimers, Kadish, and co-workers evaluated the fundamental properties of the molecular components.25–30 They prepared a series of mono-, bis-, tris-, and tetrakis-quinoxaline fused porphyrin monomers 12–16, and studied their photophysical and electrochemical properties (Scheme 4). The absorption spectra of 12–16 became wider and red-shifted with an increase of the fused quinoxaline units, which reached 697 nm for tetrakis-fused porphyrin 16b.30 These results clearly indicate that the π-conjugation is widely extended over the fused quinoxaline units. Upon electrochemical oxidation, the first oxidation potentials of reference porphyrin 2b, mono-fused porphyrin 12b, and linear bis-fused porphyrin 13b remained almost constant (0.72–0.76 V vs. SCE), while the reduction potentials positively shifted in the order of 2b (−1.42 V), 12b (−1.31 V), and 13b (−1.14 V).27 Namely, the introduction of fused quinoxaline units clearly enhances the electron-accepting ability, which can be attributed to the inherently electron-deficient imine-type nitrogen atoms. It is worth noting that the reduction potential of L-shaped bis-fused porphyrin 14b (−1.29 V) was close to that of 12b rather than that of 13b.27 In other words, the addition of a second quinoxaline group to 12b at the adjacent β-pyrrolic site has only a minor effect on the macrocyclic conjugation.

Kadish, Crossley, and co-workers actively investigated the detailed electrochemical redox processes of the various metal complexes.31–36 While the single-electron reduction of CoII-porphyrin 2f predominantly proceeded at the metal center, that of quinoxaline-fused porphyrin CoII-complex 12f led to a product with mixed CoI and porphyrin π-radical anion character, as evidenced by the thin-layer UV/Vis spectral changes.31 These results can be ascribed to the enhanced electron-deficiency of quinoxaline-fused porphyrins. Furthermore, the authors found that AgII-complexes 12g and 13g displayed a unique ambipolar character to act as both a good electron donor and acceptor.32 This phenomenon had not been previously observed in other metalloporphyrin complexes, and can be attributed to the extended π-conjugation with electron-withdrawing nitrogen atoms. Moreover, during the course of the studies on tin-complex 12h,33 they found that addition of an acid effectively activated the fused quinoxaline group to undergo the reduction process prior to that of the whole macrocycle.34 As an extension of this finding, they demonstrated that bis-quinoxaline-fused porphyrin AuIII-complex 13i experienced an unusual multi-step sequential AuIII/AuII process.35 Namely, although the initial single-electron reduction occurred at the highly electron-deficient AuIII-center,36 the subsequent protonation at the fused-quinoxaline unit followed by electron transfer to the activated quinoxaline unit immediately regenerated a new AuIII-complex fused with a reduced quinoxaline unit. It further underwent a second AuIII/AuII reduction process.
Utilizing the synthetic accessibility and enhanced electron-accepting character of the quinoxaline-fused porphyrins, a series of donor–acceptor assemblies have been actively explored in order to mimic natural photosynthetic systems (Scheme 5).37–45 Crossley, Ghiggino, and co-workers prepared quinoxaline-fused porphyrin assemblies 17 and 18 as model compounds of the photosynthetic reaction center.38–40 In the molecular design of 17 and 18, the central cofacial porphyrin units, which are linked by a Tröger base, mimic the “special pair”, and the appended AuIII-complex acts as an electron-acceptor. As expected, 17 and 18 underwent photoinduced charge separation upon irradiation at 541 nm in benzonitrile to produce charge-separated species with long lifetimes of 150 ns and 59.4 μs, respectively.

Fukuzumi, Kadish, Crossley, and co-workers synthesized donor–acceptor dyad 19 consisting of ZnII- and AuIII-quinoxaline-fused porphyrins.41,42 Interestingly, 19 underwent fast charge separation in nonpolar cyclohexane to give a charge-separated state with a long lifetime of 10 μs. Furthermore, metal coordination on the fused quinoxaline unit enabled further modulation of the photophysical properties of 19.43 Indeed, addition of Sc3+ effectively activated the fused quinoxaline unit to enhance its electron-accepting ability. Consequently, the electron-accepting unit shifted from the central AuIII-ion to the fused quinoxaline unit, and the charge separation lifetime of 19 in benzonitrile was prolonged by 1700 times.
As a different donor–acceptor system, Jia, Liu, Bhosale, Fukuzumi, and co-workers prepared TTF-appended quinoxalinoporphyrin 20, where the TTF and quinoxalinoporphyrin units acted as an electron-donor and acceptor, respectively.44,45 Upon photoexcitation at the porphyrin unit, the intramolecular charge-transfer successfully proceeded from the TTF unit to the singlet porphyrin core. Furthermore, they achieved a relatively long lived charge-separation (τ = 385 ps) in a supramolecular coordination complex consisting of 20 and N-(4-pyridyl)-3,4-fulleropyrrolidine.
Quinoxaline-fused porphyrin has also been expected as a nice scaffold to create high-performance organic photovoltaics because of its efficient light-harvesting abilities (Scheme 6). Araki, Imahori, and co-workers fabricated dye-sensitized solar cell devices with employing quinoxaline-fused porphyrin derivatives 21 and 22 as the sensitizers, and achieved the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4.0% and 5.2%, respectively.46 Furthermore, they synthesized donor–acceptor type dye 23 having a diarylamino group at the opposite site of the fused quinoxaline unit, and recorded an improved PCE of 6.8%.47 Wong and co-workers manufactured a bulk heterojunction photovoltaic device containing hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene-porphyrin hybrid 24 as a donor material, which exhibited a PCE of 1.2%.48

Crossley and co-workers synthesized phenanthroline-appended porphyrins 25, and examined their potential as a “molecular alligator clip” to connect with metal electrodes (Scheme 7a).49 As expected, the Zn-complex 25a cleanly reacted with Zn(OAc)2 to form the 2:1 complex 26a almost quantitatively. Reversely, the bridging ZnII-ion was sequestered by addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to recover 25a in 55% yield. Curiously, the complexation of free base 25b with Zn(OAc)2 proceeded predominantly at the appended phenanthroline unit without metalation at the inner cavity of the porphyrin skeleton, giving 26b in 98% yield. Liu and co-workers synthesized a series of phenanthroline-appended porphyrins chelating a PdII-ion at the fused-phenanthroline unit 27, and subjected them to the Mizoroki–Heck cross-coupling reaction as a catalyst (Scheme 7b).50 Although the precise mechanism remained unclear, these catalysts exhibited different reactivity depending on the inner metals of the porphyrin units.

Crossley et al. examined the potential of quinoxaline-fused porphyrin arrays in molecular recognition (Scheme 8).51 They synthesized partially protected pyrazinoquinoxaline-linked dimer 28, which formed a strong intramolecular 1:1 complex 29 with 1,12-diaminododecane whose molecular length (16.4 Å) was optimal to span the two zinc binding sites (15.3 Å). On the other hand, coordination of relatively shorter 1,8-diaminooctane (11.3 Å) afforded a 1:2:1 sandwich complex 30. Such a selective recognition of 1,12-diaminododecane is attributable to the role of the rigidly fused quinoxaline linker to align the two zinc centers in a precise geometry. From these results, they proposed a concept of “molecular ruler”.

Shinokubo and co-workers serendipitously found that oxidation of 2-amino-5,10,15-triphenylporphyrin 31 with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) in CHCl3 efficiently provided pyrazine-fused diporphyrin 32 in 82% yield (Scheme 9).52 A similar dimerization was also applicable to 2-amino-5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin 33 despite the increased steric hindrance, which afforded the corresponding dimer 34 in 18% yield. After this discovery, they challenged to more sterically congested 2-amino-5,10,15,20-tetramesitylporphyrin 35.53 Although oxidation under the previous conditions gave the desired dimer 36 in a miserable yield, they found that oxidation in α,α,α-trifluorotoluene/trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) furnished 36 in an excellent yield. Interestingly, owing to the significant steric repulsion between the neighboring mesityl groups, 36 took a highly twisted conformation with an edge-to-edge twisting angle of 125.6(8)°. Furthermore, the authors repeated this transformation to synthesize the corresponding tetramer 37, and elucidated the unidirectionally twisted structure with an extraordinarily large edge-to-edge twisting angle of 281–298° (Fig. 1). In addition, the Shinokubo group recently succeeded to control the helical chirality of the ZnII-complex 38 by addition of a chiral amine ligand, as evidenced by the circular dichroism spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.54

Other synthetic routes toward pyrazine-fused porphyrins have also been established (Scheme 10). Mandoj et al. subjected ZnII-diketochlorin 39 to dehydrative condensation with 2,3-diamino-ZnII-porphyrin 40, which gave the corresponding pyrazine-bridged dimer 41 in 20% yield (Scheme 10a).55 In the next step, they aimed to synthesize pyrazinopyrazine-linked dimer 42via dioxopyrazinoporphyrin 43 generated in situ by the condensation of 40 with diethyl oxalate. However, the reaction gave 41 instead of 42 in 42% yield probably because the nucleophilic attack of diaminoporphyrin 40 proceeded at the more reactive imine unit of the intermediate 43. Nath et al. developed a versatile synthetic method to prepare pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazinoporphyrins 44 by a Pictet–Spengler reaction (Scheme 10b).56 Namely, 2-amino-3-(pyrrol-1-yl)porphyrin 45 reacted with various aldehydes in the presence of p-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) to provide 44 up to 86% yield.

2.2 Imidazole-fused porphyrin
Imidazole-fused porphyrins as well as pyrazine- and quinoxaline-fused porphyrins have been actively investigated. In 1999, Crossley et al. developed a versatile procedure to synthesize imidazoporphyrins 46via Debus–Radziszewski condensation of porphyrin-2,3-dione 1b with various aryl aldehydes in the presence of NH4OAc (Scheme 11a).57 Thereafter, Birin, Guilard, and co-workers verified other porphyrin-2,3-diones having diverse meso-substituents 1c–f, and revealed that the reaction gave the desired imidazoporphyrins in moderate to high yields (Scheme 11b).58
 Scheme 11  Synthesis of imidazole-fused porphyrins via Debus–Radziszewski condensation. TFA = trifluoroacetic acid. 
Owing to the high functional tolerance of the above-mentioned synthetic procedure, a number of functional dyes consisting of the imidazoporphyrins have been reported (Scheme 12). Crossley, Imahori, and Fukuzumi et al. synthesized imidazoporphyrin-fullerene dyad 47, and demonstrated that 47 underwent intramolecular charge transfer upon photoexcitation to afford a long-lived charge-separated state with a lifetime of 310 μs.59 Furthermore, Reimers, Fukuzumi, Crossley, and co-workers subjected ferrocene-imidazoporphyrin-fullerene triad 48 to photoexcitation.60,61 Interestingly, the charge-separation lifetime of 48 (630 μs) was distinctly elongated from that of the related triad 49 (8 μs).62 From the detailed experimental and theoretical investigations, they revealed that, while the photo-generated radical cation of 49 was localized on the ferrocene unit, that of 48 moderately delocalized into the neighboring imidazole unit. Consequently, the effective donor–acceptor distance was distinctly reduced, hence dramatically slowing the charge-recombination reaction due to the small reorganization energy. In addition to these examples, a supramolecular complex of imidazoporphyrin and fullerene 50 has also been reported, and it underwent photoinduced charge separation with the lifetime of 9.8 μs.63

Richeter and co-workers pursued the utilization of imidazoporphyrin as an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand (Scheme 13). The desired imidazolium salt 52 was synthesized from 2,3-diaminoporphyrin 51 by condensation with HC(OMe)3 followed by N-methylation.64,65 After it, they showed that 52 actually worked as a NHC ligand, and underwent complexation with PdII- and AuI-ions to afford the corresponding metal-bridged dimers 53 and 54, respectively.64,66,67 Furthermore, they prepared a series of cis-[(NHC)RhCl(CO)2] complexes 55, whose CO-stretching frequency ν(CO) could be used to quantify the σ-donating ability of the NHC unit.68,69 Interestingly, the σ-donating abilities of the fused NHC units strongly depended on the electron-donating ability of the metalloporphyrin core, and increased in the order of 55a (M = MnCl) ≪ 55b (M = Ni) < 55c (M = 2H) < 55d (M = Zn). Consequently, these controllable electronic properties affected the catalytic ability for the ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide. In addition, these authors have also synthesized a series of bis-, tris-, and tetrakis-imidazole-fused porphyrins 56–59, which will be a key intermediate to create more elaborate metal-porphyrin networks.70

2.3 Triazole-fused porphyrin
Cavaleiro and co-workers reported the synthesis and transformation of triazole-fused porphyrins 61 (Scheme 14).71 They treated 2-nitro-5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin 60a with sodium azide in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 80 °C for 2 days to obtain triazole-fused porphyrin 61a in 30% yield. A similar transformation of relatively electron-deficient 2-nitro-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin 60b proceeded more efficiently even at room temperature, affording the corresponding triazole-fused porphyrin 61b in 80%. Furthermore, the authors examined N-functionalizations at the fused imidazole unit, and found that 61a underwent an SNAr reaction with tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin 62 to provide the corresponding pentamer 63 in 40% yield.

2.4 TTF-fused porphyrin
TTF is an attractive molecule in light of the multiple stable redox states, and has found widespread use in materials chemistry. Therefore, a number of researchers have already reported a variety of TTF-annulated oligopyrrolic macrocycles including porphyrin, calixpyrrole, phthalocyanine, and so on as summarized by Jeppesen, Sessler, and co-workers.72 In this section, we will focus on β,β-TTF-fused porphyrins and their derivatives.
In 2001, Becher and co-workers synthesized directly TTF-fused porphyrins 65a and 65b by acid-mediated condensation of pyrrolo[3,4-d]TTF 64 with aldehydes followed by oxidation (Scheme 15a).73 Thereafter, Sessler and Jeppesen et al. synthesized mono- and bis-TTF-fused porphyrins 66 and 67, and examined the fundamental photophysical properties (Scheme 15b).74,75 Judging from the scarcely perturbed absorption spectra, the electronic communication between the TTF and porphyrin units was substantially small despite the coplanar structure. On the other hand, electron transfer from the TTF unit to the porphyrin unit immediately proceeded upon photoexcitation at the porphyrin unit, resulting in fluorescence quenching of the porphyrin unit.

Lee, Kim, Sessler, and co-workers reported free base and ZnII-porphyrins 68 and 69 possessing two fused TTF subunits in a cis-manner (Scheme 16a).76 Curiously, these two molecules exhibited different behaviors upon electrochemical oxidation. Namely, the oxidation of the two TTF units of the free base 68 occurred at different potentials because the flexible free base porphyrin core enabled significant interaction between the neighboring TTF units. On the other hand, the TTF units were simultaneously oxidized indicating negligible interaction between the TTF units attached in the rigid ZnII porphyrin. Hill, D'Souza, and co-workers synthesized tetra-TTF-fused tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin 70 as an electron-rich derivative (Scheme 16b).77 Interestingly, in spite of the presence of bulky tert-butyl groups, 70 aggregated appreciably in solution to form spherical particles. Although the precise structure of the aggregates remained unclear, the UV/Vis spectroscopy implied the formation of J-aggregates.
 Scheme 16  Structures of TTF-fused porphyrin derivatives. Pr = n-C3H7. 
Several research groups achieved the modification of the porphyrin core to other porphyrinoids. Lee, Fukuzumi, Kim, and Sessler et al. selected [28]hexaphyrin(1.1.1.1.1.1) because they considered that attachment of TTF subunits on the flexible π-framework of hexaphyrin would provide a system containing multiple redox centers whose interactions could be controlled through molecular motion (Scheme 17a).78 The TTF-fused [28]hexaphyrin 71 exhibited weakly antiaromatic figure-of-eight conformation 71a in CH2Cl2 and relatively planar Möbius aromatic conformation 71b in MeCN. Consequently, in CH2Cl2, the TTF units of 71 were oxidized in a stepwise manner because the significantly twisted geometry allowed the TTF units to interact with each other. In contrast, such behavior was not observed in MeCN. Ishida, Lee, and co-workers synthesized bis-TTF-fused dithiaporphyrin 72 and tetrathiarubyrin 73 (Scheme 17b).79 Due to the lack of the inner NH units, protonation of the inner imine units easily occurred to enhance the electron-accepting ability of the macrocycle. Consequently, the corresponding protonated species underwent thermally excited intramolecular electron transfer at room temperature, and exhibited near-infrared (NIR) absorption.

2.5 1,4-Dithiine-fused porphyrin
Incorporation of directly fused 1,4-benzodithiine units was achieved by Crossley and co-workers in 1991 (Scheme 18a).80 The authors subjected 2,3,12,13-tetrabromoporphyrin 74 to the SNAr reaction with o-benzenedithiol in the presence of LiOH as a base, which afforded bis-1,4-benzodithiine-fused porphyrin 75 in 48% yield. Recently, Osuka et al. applied this synthetic scheme to hexachlorosubporphyrin 76, and obtained tris-1,4-benzodithiine-fused subporphyrin 77 in 74% yield (Scheme 18b).81 While the analogous hexasulfanylsubporphyrin 78 exhibited a substantial electronic interaction with the peripheral sulfur atoms by σ*–π* interaction, the attached sulfur atoms of 77 were locked to be deconjugated with the macrocycle. On the other hand, they found that 77 acted as a nice host of C60, and captured C60 with an association constant of (8.6 ± 0.6) × 102 M−1 in toluene. The X-ray crystallographic analysis indicated that the fused 1,4-benzodithiine units facilitated the binding with C60 with the concave side of the subporphyrin (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, the authors synthesized fused-1,4-dithiine linked subporphyrin dimers 79, which successfully bound C60 like a molecular tweezer with a remarkably large association constant of (1.9 ± 0.2) × 106 M−1 in toluene.82 The X-ray crystal structure of the co-crystal of 79 and C60 revealed that the C60 was sandwiched by the two subporphyrin units to form a one dimensional columnar stacking with contacting both the concave and convex surfaces (Fig. 2b and c).

2.6 Indole-fused porphyrin
Cavaleiro and co-workers found that the Nenitzescu indole synthesis of β-aminoporphyrin 33 with 1,4-benzoquinone nicely proceeded in the presence of a catalytic amount of H2SO4 to provide indole-fused porphyrin 80 in 65% yield (Scheme 19).83 The authors also examined the reaction with 1,4-naphthoquinone to obtain benzo[g]indole-fused porphyrin 81. However, instead of the desired product 81, the reaction afforded benzo[f]indolone-fused porphyrin 82 in 25% yield.

2.7 Benzothiophene-fused porphyrin
Attachment of fused benzothiophene units was achieved by Ono and co-workers (Scheme 20).84 The authors synthesized benzothiophene-fused pyrrole 83 by the reaction of 3-nitrobenzothiophene with isocyanoacetate in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) in 60% yield. In the next step, they converted 83 to benzothiophene-fused porphyrin 84via a reaction sequence of reduction with LiAlH4, acid-catalyzed condensation with Montmorillonite clay K-10, and oxidation with chloranil. The benzothiophene-fused porphyrin 84 exhibited a red-shifted absorption spectrum compared to that of 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin, suggesting the effective π-extension over the fused benzothiophene units.

2.8 Phosphole-fused porphyrin
Higashino, Imahori, and co-workers synthesized (phosphole sulfide)-fused porphyrin dimer 87 by the acid-catalyzed condensation of bis(pyrrolo)phosphole sulfide 85 with tripyrrane dicarbinol 86 followed by oxidation in spite of the low reaction yield of 0.7% (Scheme 21).85 In this dimer, the two porphyrin units were conjugated with each other, as evidenced by the red-shifted absorption spectrum and split first reduction potential (ΔE = 0.25 V). Interestingly, the first reduction potential was positively shifted by 0.46 V from that of porphyrin monomer, being comparable to that of [60]PCBM. The enhanced electron-deficiency of 87 can be attributed to the incorporation of an electron-withdrawing pentavalent phosphorus atom.

2.9 Benzosilole-fused porphyrin
Construction of fused benzosilole segments was achieved by Yorimitsu, Kim, Osuka, and co-workers by utilizing an intramolecular sila-Friedel–Crafts reaction (Scheme 22).86 The key precursor 89, which was synthesized by the Negishi coupling of 2,18-diiodoporphyrin 88 with 2-(diphenylsilyl)phenylzinc reagent, underwent an intramolecular sila-Friedel–Crafts reaction in the presence of trityl cations to furnish bis-benzosilole-fused porphyrin 90 in 45% yield. It is worth noting that, at that time, the intramolecular sila-Friedel–Crafts reaction also proceeded at the free meso-position to afford a minor product 91 in 10% yield.

3. β-Heteroatom-embedded porphyrins
Most β-heteroatom-embedded porphyrins as well as β,β-heterocycle-fused porphyrins can be readily prepared by using 5,10,15,20-tetraarylporphyrins. In this section, we wish to group them by the embedded heteroatoms, in which nitrogen atoms have been further classified into amine-type and imine-type nitrogen atoms.
3.1 Amine-type nitrogen
Incorporation of an amine-type nitrogen atom was initially examined by Ruppert, Callot, and co-workers in the course of their research on metal-bridged porphyrin arrays. In the previous work, these authors reported that porphyrin-based enaminoketone ligand 92 chelated a PdII-ion to form the PdII-bridged dimer 93.87 As an extension of that work, they designed new enaminoketone ligand 95 by switching the carbonyl group with the amino group, which can be regarded as one of the β-(amine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrins.88 The synthesis of 95 is shown in Scheme 23. A Cadogan reaction of β-nitroporphyrin 60a with an excess amount of P(OEt)3 at 155 °C in 1,2-dichlorobenzene afforded the cyclized product 94 in 75% yield. The subsequent Vilsmeier–Haack reaction underwent selectively at the adjacent β-position to give the desired ligand 95 in 90% yield. Interestingly, the complexation of 95 with Pd(OAc)2 furnished two isomeric dimers 96-cis and 96-trans as thermodynamic and kinetic products, respectively, although the formation of a cis-isomer was not observed in the case of 92.
 Scheme 23  Synthesis and structures of porphyrin enaminoketones and their PdII-bridged dimers. o-DCB = 1,2-dichlorobenzene, DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide. 
Other synthetic routes to obtain β-(amine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrins have also been established (Scheme 24). Chen et al. found that refluxing a toluene solution of β-porphyrinyl azide 97 afforded β-(amine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrin 94 in 85% yield (Scheme 24a).89 In this reaction, thermolysis of the azide unit probably generated a nitrene unit, which inserted into the C–H bond of the neighboring meso-phenyl group in analogy with the Cadogan reaction. Cavaleiro and co-workers reported that β-arylaminoporphyrins 98 underwent an intermolecular oxidative cyclization in a refluxed nitrobenzene solution to provide 99 in 75–87% yields (Scheme 19b).90,91 In this reaction, the presence of the halogen-substituents or acetal units did not retard the reaction.
 Scheme 24  Synthesis of β-(amine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrins. 
Late-stage transformations of β-(amine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrins are depicted in Scheme 25. Cavaleiro, Ruppert, and co-workers attempted the N-arylation of 94 (Scheme 25a).92 Although the Buchwald–Hartwig amination under the PdII/rac-BINAP catalysis was unsuccessful, the Ullmann amination of 94 with iodobenzene in the presence of CuI, L-proline, and K2CO3 provided the desired N-phenylated product 100 in 66% yield. Clément et al. reported the N-alkylation of 94 with 1-(6-iodohexyloxy)-4-nitrobenzene in the presence of NaH, which afforded 101 in 57% yield (Scheme 25b).93 After further transformation of 101 to the corresponding isocyanide 102, copolymerization with poly(3-hexylthiophene) furnished a donor material 103 showing a superior light-harvesting profile and thin film morphology which are advantageous for application in photovoltaic devices. Ruppert and co-workers examined the oxidation of 104, and found that it underwent intermolecular oxidative C–C coupling at the adjacent β-position to give the β–β directly linked dimer 105 in 85% yield (Scheme 25c).94 Due to the large steric hindrance around the β–β direct bond, 105 has axial chirality, and could be separated into the corresponding enantiomers by chiral HPLC.

3.2 Imine-type nitrogen
After the above-mentioned research studies on β-(amine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrins, Ruppert et al. explored the transformation of the amine unit to imine (Scheme 26). Treatment of porphyrin enaminoketone 95 with p-toluenesulfonic acid facilitated the intramolecular cyclization of the formyl group with the neighboring meso-phenylene, and the subsequent dehydration provided the desired β-(imine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrin 106 in 72% yield.95 As an extension of this study, the authors also synthesized doubly β-(imine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrin 107 from 94via a reaction sequence of the N-protection, nitration, and intramolecular cyclization.96
 Scheme 26  Synthetic route to β-(imine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrins developed by Ruppert and co-workers. TsOH = p-toluenesulfonic acid. 
Brückner and co-workers found a different synthetic route toward the β-(imine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrins during the course of their chemistry on pyrrole-modified porphyrins (Scheme 27).97 While treatment of 2,3-dioxoporphyrin monooxime NiII-complex 108a with TsOH gave the corresponding Beckmann-rearranged product 109,98 freebase 108b was converted to β-(imine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrin 110 by the intramolecular cyclization.99,100 The same transformation for 110 afforded the doubly β-(imine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrin 111. Furthermore, these authors recently reported the pyrrole modification of 110 at the opposite side of the fused quinoxaline unit.101
 Scheme 27  Synthetic route to β-(imine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrins developed by Brückner and co-workers. TsOH = p-toluenesulfonic acid. 
Brückner, Zhu, and co-workers evaluated the detailed photophysical properties of 110, and noticed that it should be a nice candidate as a contrast agent in photoacoustic imaging (PAI) because of the following two reasons.102 (1) 110 displayed a relatively intense absorption band (logε = 4.30) in the near-IR region (728 nm), which was located in the “spectroscopic window” of the tissues (ca. 700–1000 nm). (2) The S1-state of 110 relaxed rapidly via nonradiative decay, converting more than 98% of the incident light into heat. Consequently, 110 exhibited a 2.5-fold contrast enhancement over that of indocyanine green 112, which is a benchmark contrast agent (Scheme 28). Moreover, they introduced polyethylene glycol (PEG) units to obtain water-soluble analogue 113 as an in vivo contrast agent.103 As expected, when used for the PAI of an implanted tumor in a mouse model, 113 exhibited a multi-fold contrast enhancement rather than 112.
 Scheme 28  Structures of PAI contrast agents. 
3.3 Sulfone
Incorporation of sulfone was achieved by Dixon and co-workers (Scheme 29).104 They treated 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin 114 with fuming H2SO4 to obtain β-sulfone-embedded porphyrin 115. Interestingly, the Soret band of 115 was red-shifted by about 32 nm compared to that of 114, although sulfonation at the β-positions generally results in a bathochromic shift of 3–5 nm per one sulfonic acid unit. The distinct red-shift of the Soret band will be attributed to the effective perturbation by the incorporated sulfonyl group and/or coplanarization of the meso-aryl group.
 Scheme 29  Synthesis of β-sulfone-embedded porphyrin. 
3.4 Silicon
Yorimitsu, Kim, and Osuka et al. accomplished the incorporation of a silicon atom during the course of the studies on β,β-benzosilole-fused porphyrins 90 and 91 (Scheme 30).86 The authors subjected meso-[2-(diphenylsilyl)phenyl]porphyrin 116 to the intramolecular sila-Friedel–Crafts reaction, and obtained β-silicon-embedded porphyrin 117 in 90% yield. The structure of 117 was elucidated by X-ray diffraction analysis, in which the embedded silicon atom took typical sp3 hybridization, and the porphyrin core was slightly distorted to take a ruffled conformation.

3.5 Oxygen
Incorporation of a planarized oxygen atom has been achieved in [28]hexaphyrin by Kim, Osuka, and co-workers (Scheme 31).105 [28]Hexaphyrin 118 was formed by simple heating of [26]hexaphyrin in acetic acid. In the structure of 118, the incorporated oxygen atom rigidified a twisted Möbius conformation. Consequently, while a conventional [28]hexaphyrin(1.1.1.1.1.1) exists as a mixture of various conformational isomers in solution at room temperature, 118 maintained the distinct Möbius aromaticity even at 100 °C.

4. 
        meso-Heteroatom-embedded porphyrins
It has been widely known that perturbation by the peripheral substituent on the porphyrin π-system becomes more effective at the meso-position rather than the β-position.106 In this connection, we can expect more effective electronic perturbation by a planarized heteroatom at the meso-position. In this section, we classify these porphyrins by the embedded heteroatoms. In particular, nitrogen atoms have been further classified into amine and imine types.
4.1 Imine-type nitrogen
In 1998, Dolphin et al. explored the incorporation of a planarized imine-type nitrogen atom (Scheme 32). Encouraged by the synthesis of benzochlorin 120 from porphyrinylallyl alcohol 119 under the acidic conditions,107 they applied a similar transformation to meso-(formylmethylimino)porphyrin 121.108 Namely, refluxing of a toluene solution of 121 in the presence of acidic clay Montmorillonite K10 provided 122 in 20% yield via intramolecular cyclization followed by migration of the β-ethyl group. The absorption spectrum of pyridochlorin 122 was qualitatively similar to that of benzochlorin 120, but the long-wavelength absorption of 122 (λmax = 672 nm) was slightly red-shifted from that of 120 (λmax = 658 nm).

Gold and co-workers serendipitously found that attempted FeII-metalation of meso-anilinoporphyrin 123 with FeCl2·4H2O gave not only FeIII-complex 124, but also non-metalated cyclized product 125 (Scheme 33).109 In a similar manner, these authors also synthesized the fluoranthene- and pyrene-fused derivatives 126 and 127, respectively.
 Scheme 33  Synthesis of quinoxalinochlorin and structures of the derivatives. 
4.2 Amine-type nitrogen
While the coplanarization of an imino nitrogen atom was achieved two decades ago, that of an amino nitrogen atom had remained unexplored until quite recently. It is surprising because the introduction of an amino nitrogen atom at the meso-position is a popular and reliable strategy to enhance the electron-donating ability of the porphyrin core as seen in donor–acceptor type porphyrins for dye-sensitized solar cells.110
In 2013, two research groups independently worked on this research topic, and both planned to synthesize meso-(amine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrins via oxidative fusion reactions of meso-diarylaminoporphyrins (Scheme 34). Gryko et al. reported that treatment of 5,10-bis[di(2-naphthyl)amino]porphyrin 128 with Fe(ClO4)3·H2O afforded singly fused product 129 in 35% yield.111 Yorimitsu, Kim, and Osuka et al. found that oxidation of mono-diarylaminoporphyrin 130 with FeCl3 and DDQ gave singly fused product 131 in 69% yield.112 Furthermore, they employed more forceful conditions with an increased amount of oxidants and prolonged reaction time, which resulted in double cyclization along with β-chlorination to furnish 132 in 25% yield. The superfluous chlorine atoms were removed by the aid of a Pd-catalyst to provide 133 in 81% yield.
 Scheme 34  Synthesis of meso-(amine-type nitrogen)-embedded porphyrins by oxidative fusion reactions. DDQ = 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone, SPhos = 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2′,6′-dimethoxybiphenyl, Ar1 = 3,4,5-tridecyloxyphenyl, Ar2 = 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl. 
After the above-mentioned studies, Yorimitsu and Osuka et al. established an improved synthetic route to doubly diphenylamine-fused porphyrin 136 (Scheme 35).113 Initially, they planned to synthesize the target compound 136via an SNAr reaction of meso-chloro-β,β-diiodoporphyrin 134 with diphenylamine to give meso-diphenylamino-β,β-diiodoporphyrin 135, which might be convertible into 136 by utilizing an organometallic approach. However, surprisingly, the SNAr reaction in the presence of NaOtBu provided 136 directly in 81% yield. Although the precise mechanism remained unclear, single-electron transfer to the intermediate 135 followed by liberation of I− would produce a porphyrinyl radical, which would react with the neighboring phenyl group to form 136. With this synthetic method in hand, these authors also achieved the synthesis of meso–meso linked diphenylamine-fused porphyrin dimer 137 (Scheme 36).114 Furthermore, 137 was converted to meso–meso β–β doubly linked dimer 138 by oxidation with tris(4-bromophenyl)aminium hexachloroantimonate (Magic Blue).

The cyclic voltammograms of meso-diarylaminoporphyrin 130 and doubly fused product 133 are shown in Fig. 3.112 While the first reduction potential of 133 remained almost constant after the planarization of the nitrogen atom, the first oxidation potential was negatively shifted by 0.21 V as compared to that of 130. These results clearly indicated that the electron-donating ability was distinctly enhanced by embedding the electron-donating amino-nitrogen atom. Furthermore, the large difference between the first and second oxidation waves (ΔE = 0.56 V) suggests that the electrochemically generated radical cation has been effectively delocalized over the large π-conjugated system.

Encouraged by these results, Furukawa, Yorimitsu, Kim, and Osuka et al. attempted to isolate the radical cation (Scheme 37).115 After kinetic protection at the reactive β-positions of 136 furnishing β,β-dichlorinated diphenylamine-fused porphyrin 139, these authors finally discovered that oxidation of 139 with Magic Blue afforded remarkably stable radical cation 140 which could be handled like a usual closed-shell molecule. The observed stability can be attributed to effective spin-delocalization over the whole molecule and appropriate steric protection at the meso- and β-positions. Furthermore, these authors also accomplished the synthesis of phenoxazine-fused porphyrinium radical 141 as a more planar analogue, and disclosed the effect of planarity on the solid-state magnetism. Namely, while 140 loosely packed in the solid state and the intermolecular interaction was negligible, 141 stacked as a face-to-face dimer with a relatively strong antiferromagnetic interaction (Fig. 4).

Pawlicki and Latos-Grażyński et al. synthesized aniline-fused porphyrin 142, and disclosed the effect of redox and protonation/deprotonation processes on the electronic properties (Scheme 38).116 Upon oxidation with DDQ in the presence of TFA, aniline-fused porphyrin 142 lost two electrons and one proton to become mono-cationic form 143, which could be reduced back to 142 upon treatment with NaBH4. On the other hand, deprotonation of 142 with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) provided mono-anion 144, which was again protonated with HCl to recover 142. Judging from the 1H NMR spectra, they suggested that 143 exhibited a partial antiaromatic character, while 144 preserved aromaticity. These results will be attributed to the contributions of antiaromatic and aromatic resonance circuits passing through the embedded imino-nitrogen atoms as observed in related compounds 145 and 146, respectively.117

4.3 Boron
While the incorporation of a planarized nitrogen atom around the porphyrin framework has been actively investigated, its boron-counterpart had remained unknown. It can be apparently attributed to the difficulty in handling organoboron compounds, since they generally undergo degradation under air unless suitably protected thermodynamically or kinetically. Besides this, recent studies have revealed that “structurally constrained” triarylborones, in which the boron atom is embedded in a planar π-system, exhibit high chemical stability.118
Inspired by these backgrounds, Yorimitsu, Kim, and Osuka et al. designed diphenylborane-fused porphyrin 148, and constructed a reliable synthetic route via a key intermediate 147 bearing an unsubstituted meso-position and two trimethylsilyl- (TMS-) phenyl groups (Scheme 39).119 This synthetic plan consists of the following three C–B bond formation steps. (1) One of the TMS groups would be convertible into a BBr2 group by a Si–B exchange reaction with BBr3. (2) The second C–B bond can be formed by an intramolecular bora-Friedel–Crafts reaction at the nucleophilic meso-carbon atom. (3) Finally, a ring-closing Si–B exchange reaction at the other TMS groups should furnish the desired 148. As expected, the designed one-pot borylation proceeded efficiently by treatment of 147 with BBr3 to give 148 in 32% yield. Moreover, the same transformation was also applicable to synthesize bis(diphenylborane)-fused porphyrin 150 from the corresponding precursor 149. The obtained diphenylborane-fused porphyrins 148 and 150 were stable toward moisture, oxygen, and silica gel, which allowed for their purification without any special cares.
 Scheme 39  Synthesis of diphenylborane-fused porphyrins. TMS = trimethylsilyl, o-DCB = 1,2-dichlorobenzene, Ar = 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl. 
The cyclic voltammograms of meso-dimesitylborylporphyrin 151 and diphenylborane-fused porphyrin 148 are shown in Fig. 5. While the first oxidation potential of 148 (0.51 V) was close to that of 151 (0.48 V), the first reduction potential of 148 (−1.23 V) was distinctly shifted to the positive direction by 0.51 V compared to that of 151 (−1.74 V). The observed tendency is opposite to that of the nitrogen counterparts shown in Fig. 3, and clearly suggests that the planarization of the electron-withdrawing boron-atom effectively enhances electron-accepting ability. Bis(diphenylborane)-fused porphyrin 150 exhibited a more positively shifted first reduction potential at −0.91 V in benzonitrile, which is comparable to that of C60.

Furthermore, these authors examined the Lewis acidity of the embedded boron atom of 148 (Fig. 6). Addition of pyridine to a solution of 148 in CH2Cl2 causes a distinct spectral change owing to the formation of the adduct 148·py. Namely, while 148 exhibited the Soret band at 478 nm and Q bands at 649, 689, and 755 nm, these absorption bands apparently blue-shifted upon addition of pyridine because of the interrupted conjugation between the boron and porphyrin π-system. Based on the titration experiment, the association constant was determined to be 1.7 × 105 M−1, which was larger than those of previously reported structurally constrained triarylboranes.

4.4 Carbon radical
Although “carbon” does not belong to heteroatoms, we would like to introduce one intriguing finding on a carbon-embedded porphyrin, which was prepared as the extension of the studies on the nitrogen- and boron-embedded porphyrins (Scheme 40). Furukawa, Yorimitsu, Kim, and Osuka et al. attempted to synthesize carbon-embedded porphyrin 153 by a twofold palladium-catalyzed intramolecular C–H arylation of meso-diphenylmethyl-β,β-dichloroporphyrin 152.120 Surprisingly, the reaction afforded not expected product 153 but neutral radical 154, which was as an isoelectronic structure of stable radical cation 140, in 72% yield. Similar to 140, the obtained carbon radical 154 was amazingly stable under ambient conditions because of the extensive spin delocalization over the whole π-conjugated system. In addition, treatment of 154 with hydrogen-donors such as nBu3SnH and ascorbic acid did not cause any change probably because the sp3-carbon center of 153 is substantially destabilized by the enforced planar structure. They also investigated redox properties of 154. Cation 155 and anion 156 were successfully generated by treatment of 154 with Magic Blue and cobaltocene, respectively, and subjected to spectroscopic analyses. Detailed experimental and theoretical results suggested that the cation 155 and anion 156 displayed distinct antiaromatic and aromatic character, respectively, probably due to the contributions of the macrocyclic conjugations passing through the embedded carbon atoms.

4.5 Period 3 elements (silicon, phosphorus, and sulfur)
Yorimitsu, Kim, and Osuka et al. accomplished the synthesis of silicon-embedded porphyrins by utilizing an intramolecular sila-Friedel–Crafts reaction (Scheme 41).86 The Negishi coupling of 2-chloro-18-iodoporphyrin 157 with 2-(diphenylsilyl)phenylzinc reagent afforded key intermediate 158 in 48% yield. The subsequent intramolecular sila-Friedel–Crafts reaction of 158 proceeded nicely in the presence of trityl cations to furnish meso-silylated product 159 in 55% yield. Finally, the palladium-catalyzed intramolecular C–H arylation of 159 provided triphenylsilane-fused porphyrin 160 in 23% yield. The X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the non-fused Si–Ph group of 160 was almost perpendicular to the slightly distorted π-surface. Consequently, the σ*-orbital of the Si–Ph bond conjugated with the porphyrin π-system to stabilize the LUMO level.

Quite recently, Osuka and co-workers also succeeded to incorporate a phosphorus atom into a fused π-conjugated system (Scheme 42).121 The SNAr reaction of meso,β,β-trichloroporphyrin 161 with diphenylphosphinyllithium followed by oxidation with H2O2 afforded meso-diphenylphosphinyl-β,β-dichloroporphyrin 162 in 70% yield. The intermediate 162 was transformed to diphenylphosphine-oxide-fused porphyrin 163 by an intramolecular C–H arylation reaction in 45% yield. The oxidized form 163 was subsequently reduced with HSiCl3 to give diphenylphosphine-fused porphyrin 164 in 85% yield. In these two phosphorus-embedded porphyrins 163 and 164, the oxidation states of the phosphorus atoms (PV or PIII) crucially affected the whole electronic properties to be a good electron-acceptor and electron-donor, respectively. Furthermore, owing to the high coordinating ability of the trivalent phosphine atom, diphenylphosphine-fused porphyrin 164 formed a covalently linked face-to-face dimer in the solid state, where the embedded PIII atom coordinated to the NiII atom in a complementary manner. Consequently, the central NiII atom of 164 became high-spin paramagnetic (S = 1) in the solid state, while it was low-spin diamagnetic (S = 0) in solution.

Although attachment of a planarized sulfur atom at the meso-position of porphyrin has never been reported, the analogous subporphyrin 167 was studied by Kim, Osuka, and co-workers (Scheme 43).122 They subjected meso-bromosubporphyrin 165 to the SNAr reaction with 2-bromothiophenol in the presence of Cs2CO3 as a base, which afforded the substitution product 166 in 77% yield without degradation of the bromo group on the thiophenol unit. The following intramolecular C–Br/C–H coupling nicely worked under the Pd/tBuCOOH catalysis, giving the desired thiophenol-fused subporphyrin 167 in 55% yield.

Conclusions
For the last three decades, various heteroatom-embedded porphyrins have been actively explored. In the early period, the main molecular design was devoted to constructing a directly fused heterocyclic ring at the β-positions (section 2). Most of these heterocycle-fused porphyrins were synthesized from easily accessible tetraarylporphyrins via relatively simple transformations, and exhibited diverse properties depending on the intrinsic features of the fused heterocycles. After these pioneering studies, the research interests have been gradually shifted to evaluate the perturbation by the neighboring heteroatom itself as described in section 3. Furthermore, recent progress in synthetic porphyrin chemistry enabled the attachment of various heteroatoms at the more susceptible meso-position, hence encouraging the active investigations on the interactions between the porphyrin and coplanarized heteroatoms (section 4).
These heteroatom-embedded porphyrins displayed diverse and intriguing properties depending on the fusion patterns and/or the intrinsic nature of the embedded heteroatoms. In addition to pure academic interest, increasing attention has been paid to these compounds because of the recent demands in practical applications such as artificial photosynthesis, molecular engineering, organic electronics, and bioimaging. We hope that this review article will be helpful for future designs of novel heteroatom-embedded porphyrins as well as their practical applications.
