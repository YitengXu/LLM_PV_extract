It was found that these dopants, especially DMA+, can significantly improve the phase stability of the desired α phase of CsPbI3 by compressing the transition temperature between the photoactive α phase (cubic perovskite structure) and the photoinactive δ phase (orthorhombic structure). However, the incorporation of organic cations decreases the absorption coefficient of the CsPbI3 perovskite in the visible spectrum. The details of the improvement of the phase stability and the degradation of the optical properties arising from the organic dopants are revealed. Our results are valuable for developing stable and high performance hybrid perovskite photovoltaic materials.
1. Introduction
Lead halide perovskites have been research hot spots in the current photovoltaic field due to the remarkable advantage of efficiency-to-cost ratio.1 Since their first successful implementation in dye-sensitized solar cells,2 the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) have increased from 3.8% to 23.7% in the past decade.3 Currently, the best performing materials in this family are based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3).4,5 However, owing to the volatile nature of the organic cations, hybrid perovskites suffer from poor thermal stability,6 which has been the key issue hindering further commercialization. An alternative solution to this problem is replacement of the organic components with an inorganic Cs cation for fabricating all-inorganic perovskites.7 The black cubic α phase of CsPbI3 has a direct band gap of around 1.7 eV,8 making it a promising photovoltaic material. Unfortunately, the desired α phase can only be obtained at elevated temperature (>310 °C), and it spontaneously turns into the yellow photoinactive orthorhombic δ phase by the α-to-δ phase structural transition when the environment temperature is below the critical point.9
Many schemes have been proposed to improve the phase stability of black α-CsPbI3. For example, partial substitution of the I ion with the smaller Br ion has been proved to be a feasible approach for stabilizing the α structure.10 However, the incorporation of Br enlarges the band gap of the CsPbI3 perovskite, which is undesirable for solar cell applications.11 The stable α phase can also be obtained by preparing CsPbI3 nanocrystals or quantum dots, but the increased grain boundaries and the exposed surfaces lead to more charge traps.12–14 Although the recombination can be compressed through organic molecule surface passivation, the coating blocks the charge transport.15 Another effective strategy focuses on the selection of solvent and precursor in producing samples, and most of them are mixtures containing dimethylformamide (DMF), such as DMF/HI,16 DMF/HI/H2O,17 DMF/DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide)18 and DMF/HPbI3.19,20 Using these solutions, a series of high-quality all-inorganic α-CsPbI3 thin films have been prepared, and the solar cells exhibit significantly improved stability and high PCE, including the record ones. Despite the great success, the role played by the organic solvent in stabilizing α-CsPbI3 is still debated. Very recently, a study reported that DMF can slowly hydrolyze into the dimethylammonium cation (DMA+), and the decomposition process is further accelerated with the addition of HI.21 Thus, the reaction solutions contain a considerable amount of DMA+, which could occupy partial Cs+ sites of the perovskite lattice, forming the double-cation DMAxCs1−xPbI3. Interestingly, such mixtures also have a black appearance and a close band gap similar to the pure α-CsPbI3. If this is true, many claims of obtaining stable all-inorganic α-CsPbI3 would have to be reexamined carefully, as the black samples might in fact be the organic–inorganic hybrids. Therefore, it's essential to confirm whether DMA+ doping can increase the stability of black α-CsPbI3, and the effect of DMA+ on the geometry structure, electronic structure and optical properties of the CsPbI3 perovskite need to be studied for assessing the photoelectric performance. Besides, two other monovalent cations, EA+ (2.74 Å) and GA+ (2.78 Å), have ionic radii close to that of DMA+ (2.72 Å) [Fig. 1(c)],22,23 so it's interesting to investigate their doping effect for the purpose of comparison.

In this work, we carry out first-principles calculations to study the influence of cation replacement with DMA+, EA+ and GA+ on the properties of CsPbI3. We find that all dopants can improve the phase stability of the desired α-CsPbI3, and DMA+ is shown to be more efficient than EA+ and GA+. It's revealed that the structural distortion of CsPbI3 arising from cation doping is responsible for the increased phase stability. At 25% dopant content, the perovskite phase exhibits a slightly blueshifted band gap, increased hole effective mass and reduced optical absorption in the visible spectrum. Our results suggest that organic cation doping is a viable way for obtaining a stable CsPbI3 perovskite at ambient temperature.
2. Computational details
To study the evolution of the properties of CsPbI3 as a function of organic cation concentration, we substitute one Cs cation with one DMA+ (or EA+, GA+) in three different supercells consisting of 20, 40 and 80 atoms for both α and δ phases,9,24 which corresponds respectively to replacement ratios of 1/4, 1/8 and 1/16, or dopant concentrations of 25%, 12.5% and 6.25%.
All systems are handled at the level of density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).25 Core-valence interactions are described by the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method.26 The energy cutoff of the plane wave basis is set to 550 eV. Exchange and correlation interactions are treated by the optPBE-vdW functional accounting for dispersion interactions in the perovskites.27,28 8 × 8 × 8, 4 × 4 × 8, 4 × 4 × 4, and 2 × 4 × 4 Γ-centered grids of k point are used to sample the Brillouin zones of α cells containing 5, 20, 40, and 80 atoms, respectively. For the δ cells consisting of 20, 40, and 80 atoms, the corresponding k-point grids are 4 × 8 × 2, 4 × 4 × 2, and 4 × 2 × 2, respectively. Note that the orthorhombic δ unit cell comprises 20 atoms, while the cubic α unit cell has only 5 atoms. During the electronic self-consistency loop, the criterion of 1 × 10−5 eV for the total energy convergence is required. The cell size, cell shape, and the atomic coordinates of each system are fully optimized until the residual Hellmann–Feynman forces are smaller than 0.02 eV Å−1. The number of energy bands is increased by two fold with respect to the VASP default in calculating the frequency dependent dielectric matrix. Using VASPKIT,29 a pre- and post-processing program for the VASP code, we obtain the optical absorption coefficients with the calculated dielectric tensors.
Table S1 (ESI†) shows the optimized lattice parameters, cell volumes and band gaps of CsPbI3 with and without spin–orbit coupling (SOC). It can be found that the results of PBE without SOC are in agreement with the experiments. However, such agreement is just fortuitous, and it stems from the error cancellations by using PBE and neglecting SOC.30 In order to reflect the real geometric structures and band gaps of CsPbI3, we adopt PBE without considering the SOC effect in this work.
3. Results and discussion
A. Pure systems
In pure α-CsPbI3, Pb–I octahedrons connect each other in a corner-sharing way, and Cs is surrounded by these octahedrons [Fig. 1(a)]. Because of the striking electronegativity difference between Cs and I,31 Cs donates one electron to the neighboring I ion. Interestingly, we don’t find the apparent state contribution from Cs around the band edge [see Fig. 2(a)], indicating that Cs has no direct impact on the basic electronic structure of CsPbI3. The main function of Cs should be to maintain the stability of the system structure by bonding with the surrounding Pb–I frameworks in an ionic manner, which is similar to the role played by CH3NH3 in CH3NH3PbI3.32 Unlike the Cs–I bond, the Pb–I bond exhibits more complicated bonding characteristics owing to the lone pair of 6s electrons of Pb. Generally, the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are commonly contributed by the bonded atoms in covalently bonded semiconductors. However, because of the charge transfer, the CBM and VBM of the ionic crystals mainly consist of the orbitals of cation and anion, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the CBM is mainly contributed by the p orbitals of Pb, which is characteristic of ionic bonding. Whereas the s orbitals of Pb have strong antibonding coupling with I p at the VBM [Fig. 2(a) and (c)], indicating the covalent bond nature. Thus, the CsPbI3 perovskite is a mixed ionic and covalent compound. A detailed discussion about the bonding/antibonding features of the CsPbI3 perovskite is given in the ESI† [Fig. S1]. It should be noted that the predicted band gap for the α phase is about 1.5 eV [Fig. 2(a)], which is slightly lower than the experimental value (1.7 eV).8 Considering the general underestimation of the band gap by the PBE functional, such minor difference should be acceptable.

(e and f) Partial charge densities at CBM and VBM of δ-CsPbI3. The Fermi energy is set to 0 eV. For the partial charge density plots, the deeper the red (blue) color, the higher (lower) is the charge density. 
When the structure of CsPbI3 changes from the α phase to δ phase, some Pb–I bonds are broken, resulting in quasi-one-dimensional edge-shared Pb–I octahedron chains along the b axis [Fig. 1(b)]. These structural changes significantly affect the electronic structure of the δ phase. On the one hand, the CBM is composed of Pb 6p and minor I 5p states [Fig. 2(d) and (e)]. On the other hand, since the lengths of the Pb–I bonds increase, the antibonding coupling of Pb s and I p orbitals is weakened [Fig. 2(d) and (f)], making the VBM constituted by s–p antibonding states drop in energy. Consequently, compared with the α phase, the δ phase has a larger band gap [Fig. 2(d)]. Our calculation results show that the energy of the δ phase is lower by 300 meV per formula unit than that of the α phase.
B. DMA+, EA+ and GA+ doped systems
In view of the relatively large sizes of DMA, EA and GA, it's necessary to assess whether or not these molecules can be incorporated into the lattice of CsPbI3 in terms of energy. To do this, we have examined many different orientations of the molecule in each chosen supercell, and only the results corresponding to the most stable configurations are presented. The formation energies of the dopant molecules are defined as, Ef = E(MxCs1−xPBI3) − E(CsPbI3) − xE(M) + (1−x)E(Cs).(1)where M refers to the DMA, EA, or GA molecule, and x is the replacement ratio of Cs by M. E(MxCs1−xPbI3) and E(CsPbI3) are the total energies of the doped molecule and the pure CsPbI3, respectively. E(M) is the energy of the individual M molecule, while E(Cs) is the energy per Cs atom of the body centered cubic metal. Table 1 lists the calculated formation energies of DMA, EA and GA for both α- and δ-CsPbI3 at different contents. Clearly, all values are negative, no matter which dopant is used, indicating that the DMA, EA and GA doping are allowable in terms of energy. Besides, because the formation energies of organic dopants in the α phase are lower than that in the δ phase, it is easier to dope the high temperature α structure, in other words, high temperature synthesis is preferable. In addition, at the same concentration, these are no obvious distinctions in the formation energies among the three dopants, which can be attributed to their close sizes and ionic valences in the perovskites.

Next, we turn our attention to the change in the phase stability of α-CsPbI3 upon DMA+, EA+ and GA+ doping. The phase stability mentioned here is the relative stability of the α phase with respect to the δ phase in CsPbI3, which is generally measured in terms of the energy difference between the two phases. But what we are more interested in is the phase diagram of CsPbI3, as it provides a convenient and intuitive way of evaluating the phase stability, such as observing the stable temperature range of a certain phase. The reason for plotting the phase diagram is to determine the transition temperature from the α phase to δ phase. However, it's difficult to simulate the phase transition directly using DFT calculations. Alternatively, we can estimate the transition temperature by using a simple relation which is defined as33,34: (2)In formula (2), ΔH and ΔH0 are the changes of enthalpy associated with the phase transition of the doped and pure systems, respectively. Tc,0 is the transition temperature between the pure α and δ phases of CsPbI3, which is about 310 °C (583 K) according to ref. 9. Combining formula (2) with the calculated enthalpy differences between α and δ phases listed in Table 2, we compute the transition temperatures of DMA+, EA+ and GA+ doped CsPbI3 at different doping levels, which are summarized in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, the transition temperatures of the organic cation doped systems range from 80 K to 350 K, which are lower than that of the pure CsPbI3. This indicates that the α-to-δ phase structural transition is significantly suppressed and stable α-CsPbI3 could be obtained at a reduced temperature. It should be noted that the evolution of the transition temperatures with the dopant concentration is different for DMA+, EA+ and GA+, even though they have almost the same effective ionic radii. Specifically, the transition temperature decreases linearly with increasing DMA+ concentration, but remains nearly constant (∼240 K) in the case of EA+. As for GA+, a more complex trend is observed, where the transition temperature decreases first and then increases sharply at higher concentration. In addition, the DMA+ doped CsPbI3 has a lower transition temperature as compared to the EA+ and GA+ doped ones in the considered concentration range, suggesting that DMA+ is a more efficient dopant in stabilizing α-CsPbI3 than EA+ and GA+. The results of molecular dynamics simulations at a finite temperature also show that the relative stability of the α phase with respect to the δ phase can be improved by DMA+, EA+ and GA+ doping [Table S2, ESI†].

 Fig. 3  Phase transition temperature between α-CsPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 as a function of DMA+, EA+ or GA+ concentration. 
To explore the nature of the reduction of the transition temperature arising from organic dopants, we examine the structural changes in both α- and δ-CsPbI3. Empirically, as DMA, EA, and GA have larger ionic radii than Cs, the substitution of Cs by any one of the three dopants should give rise to the expansion of the cell volume. As displayed in Table 3, the cell volumes of the δ phase increase as expected upon doping, but the α phase exhibits an opposite change regardless of the nature of the dopant. As the Pb–I bonds become longer in organic cation doped α-CsPbI3, it does not cause the volume contraction of the α cell. Interestingly, we find that the Pb–I octahedrons rotate and tilt upon doping, which leads to smaller Pb–I–Pb angles ranging from 150° to 160° for the α phase [Table 3]. Besides, such octahedral rotation distortion decreases the extra space around the Cs cation, which explains the reason why the organic cation doped α-CsPbI3 has a smaller cell volume with respect to the pure system. Accordingly, the coulomb attraction between the Cs cation and the surrounding Pb–I framework increases, which is beneficial for the stabilization of the α structure. In addition, as discussed in Part A, the longer Pb–I bonds will lower the energy of the system owing to the drop in the s–p antibonding states, which further improves the stability of the α phase. In the case of δ-CsPbI3, the increase of the lengths of the Pb–I bonds is much less than that in α-CsPbI3, indicating a negligible effect on the stability of the δ phase. In contrast, because of the noticeable expansion of the cell volume for δ-CsPbI3, the coulomb interaction is weakened, thus destabilizing the δ structure. Therefore, DMA+, EA+, or GA+ doping has an opposite influence on the stabilities of α- and δ-CsPbI3, namely, it stabilizes the α phase but destabilizes the δ phase, thus lowering the transition temperature between the two phases.

Another unusual aspect about the structure of the organic cation doped α-CsPbI3 is that the heavily doped systems have less distortion than that at a low doping level. For example, the mean length of the Pb–I bonds decreases from 3.253 Å to 3.241 Å, while the Pb–I–Pb bond angle increases from 150.5° to 157.4° along with the expansion of the cell volume of α-CsPbI3 when the concentration of DMA+ changes from 6.25% to 25% [see Table 3]. Such a trend indicates that the α phase has a narrower and more optimal band gap at 25% dopant concentration as compared to the case of 6.25% or 12.5% because of the shorter Pb–I bond, which is verified by the results presented in Table 3. We examine the band structures of DMA+, EA+ and GA+ doped α-CsPbI3 with 25% doping level for further studying their electronic structural features. As shown in Fig. 4, all doped systems have direct band gaps, but the band widths are enlarged by 0.15–0.2 eV with respect to pure α-CsPbI3. Moreover, because of the weakening of the antibonding coupling between Pb s and I p orbitals in doped α-CsPbI3, the upper valence bands are less dispersive. Then we estimate the effective mass of holes around the top of the valence band using the approximate equation,35 (3)where ε(k) is the energy dispersive relation function in the wavevector (k) space. The calculated hole effective masses for DMA+, EA+ and GA+ doped α-CsPbI3 are 0.59m0, 0.69m0, and 0.58m0, respectively, which are greater than the value of 0.39m0 for the pure system.

The blue, red and pink lines denote the highest valence band, the lowest conduction band and the second/third lowest conduction band, respectively. For undoped α-CsPbI3, the conduction band minimum is triply degenerate. It should be noted that PBE underestimates the band gap slightly. 
We also compare the optical transition of the organic cation doped α phase at a doping level of 25% with that of the pure counterpart, as shown in Fig. 5. Due to the wider band gap, the doped systems exhibit a blueshifted onset with respect to the undoped ones. Besides, the organic cation incorporation decreases the optical absorption coefficient in the visible spectrum, even though a slight absorption advantage for ultraviolet light is observed. Interestingly, the GA+ doped compound exhibits a slightly better visible light absorption than DMA+ and EA+ doped ones. The deterioration of the optical properties can be ascribed to the enlargement of the band gap and the change of the conduction band structure arising from the doping. For the latter, it can be found from Fig. 4 that three lowest bands coincide at the bottom of the conduction bands for the pure α phase, showing the degenerate feature. Such a band edge structure is advantageous to increase the number of possible direct transitions. However, owing to the distorted structure and reduced symmetry, there is a noticeable separation between the two lowest bands for the GA+ doped compound and the separation is more pronounced for two other organic cation doped systems, which lowers the photoelectric transition efficiency and degrades the optical absorption. Furthermore, as the proportion of visible light is much higher than that of ultraviolet light in the solar spectrum, a thicker absorber film is required for the DMA+, EA+ or GA+ doped CsPbI3 so as to attain the same absorptivity as that of the undoped material in the solar cell.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, it's revealed that the α-to-δ phase transition temperature of CsPbI3 can be significantly lowered by DMA+, EA+ and GA+ doping, making the stable α perovskite phase available at ambient temperature. However, these organic cation doped materials exhibit blueshifted band gaps, increased effective masses for holes and reduced absorption coefficients in the visible spectrum. Further analyses indicate that the distortion of the α structure is responsible for the improved phase stability and degraded photoelectric properties. Our work can provide theoretical guidance to the development of the CsPbI3 perovskite with superior stability and high performance.

 	Fig. 4  Band structure of the α perovskite phase for (a) CsPbI3, (b) DMA0.25Cs0.75PbI3, (c) EA0.25Cs0.75PbI3, and (d) GA0.25Cs0.75PbI3. The blue, red and pink lines denote the highest valence band, the lowest conduction band and the second/third lowest conduction band, respectively. For undoped α-CsPbI3, the conduction band minimum is triply degenerate. It should be noted that PBE underestimates the band gap slightly.	 

 	Fig. 5  Calculated absorption coefficients for undoped α-CsPbI3, and DMA+, EA+ and GA+ doped ones with a dopant concentration of 25%.
