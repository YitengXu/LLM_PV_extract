    , Accepted 17th October 2013First published on 17th October 2013AbstractAn ionic polymer based on a polythiophene backbone with appended imidazolium moieties was successfully implemented as a donor material in fully solution-processed efficient bi-layer solar cells prepared by the low impact meniscus coating technique. High fill factors and device reproducibility were obtained, even for ultrathin polymer layers, indicating excellent film formation properties and good compatibility with solution processing techniques. The possibility of smooth counter ion exchange, allowing solubility modification and efficiency tuning, enables exploration of new functionalities and other device architectures.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have attracted a lot of attention in the last few years, not in least due to significant breakthroughs in device efficiencies.1–6 Most of the best performing cells rely on bulk heterojunctions (BHJs), optimized for maximum light absorption and efficient charge generation. Less attention has been paid to the much simpler planar heterojunctions in bi-layer OPVs. Although bi-layer cells have lower efficiencies as a consequence of the use of thinner active layers (imposed by the limited exciton diffusion lengths), they still possess interesting features which make them excellent platforms for the screening of new materials and for fundamental studies. Thanks to the planar structure (one organic layer on top of another) the charges generated at the interface are spatially separated which means that holes are confined within the donor layer while the electrons are confined within the acceptor layer. Since recombination between free charges is practically eliminated, it is possible to obtain information on physical phenomena such as exciton diffusion length, efficiency of charge transfer etc. in a straightforward way.7 Most bi-layer devices studied up to now where prepared by vacuum sublimation, which is a suitable technique for low molecular weight materials.8–10 This had led to a wealth of information, yet it is limited to materials that can be sublimed, excluding polymeric and ionic materials.7,10–13 The preparation of neat bi-layers from solution, however, is not trivial, not in the least as both donor and acceptor materials are frequently soluble in the same common solvents.14 Therefore, alternative deposition techniques such as film-transfer have been explored to allow the study of polymer–fullerene bi-layer OPVs.15 A few works were published in which bi-layer planar heterostructures were prepared from solution using ionic donor molecules in combination with evaporated acceptor molecules.16–19 Recently it was also demonstrated that a bi-layer inverted OPV device could be prepared using a low impact solution coating technique referred to as meniscus coating.20,21
Among the organic molecules applied as donor materials in OPVs, poly(3-hexylthiophene) or P3HT is without any doubt the most commonly applied.22,23 More advanced polythiophene derivatives, e.g. end-group or side-chain functionalized and (block) copolymer structures, have been synthesized towards morphology control and stability.24–34 Bi-layer devices using P3HT and PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) have been reported, yet due to the similar solubility of these materials the PC61BM molecules diffuse into the P3HT layer generating concentration gradients in the vertical direction. In this way power conversion efficiencies are obtained that are rather similar to BHJ devices.35,36 To prevent the intermixing of the two materials upon solution processing, chemically modified or modifiable polythiophenes should be used.25 On the other hand, conjugated polyelectrolytes based on ionic polythiophenes, obtained via the introduction of pendant ionic functionalities on the alkyl side chains, have shown large potential as interlayer materials in OPVs.37 These materials have a very different solubility compared to their neutral counterparts. Therefore, ionic P3HT derivatives37–42 are of particular appeal for the preparation of neat bi-layer OPVs, as they allow processing from orthogonal and environmentally friendly solvents (e.g. alcohols).
Here we present a solution-processed planar heterojunction OPV system using an ionic poly(3-alkylthiophene) (i-P3AT) (Scheme 1) as the donor material and PC61BM or PC71BM (Fig. 1) as the acceptor. Due to the ionic nature of the polythiophene it is completely insoluble in chlorobenzene, used to deposit the fullerene acceptor layer. This, together with the high film qualities obtained by meniscus coating (the deposition technique used in this work), allowed for the preparation of neat bi-layer devices. The best performing devices with active layers of 40 nm using PC71BM as the acceptor exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in excess of 1.5% (1.9% for the best device).

Experimental section
Synthesis and characterization
Unless stated otherwise, all reagents and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were dried using a MBraun MB-SPS 800 solvent purification system, operating under N2 according to the principles described by Pangborn et al.43 NMR chemical shifts (δ, in ppm) were determined relative to the residual 1H absorption of CHCl3 (7.26 ppm) or the 13C resonance shift of CDCl3 (77.16 ppm). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses were carried out applying Chrompack Cpsil5CB or Cpsil8CB capillary columns. UV-Vis measurements of the polymers in solution were performed with a scan rate of 600 nm min−1 in a continuous run from 200 to 800 nm. Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were determined relative to polystyrene standards (Polymer Labs) by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Analysis of the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the precursor polymer was performed on a Tosoh EcoSEC System, comprising of an auto sampler, a PSS guard column SDV (50 × 7.5 mm), followed by three PSS SDV analytical linear XL columns (5 μm, 300 × 7.5 mm), and a differential refractive index detector (Tosoh EcoSEC RI) and a UV detector using THF as the eluent at 40 °C with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. The SEC system was calibrated using linear narrow polystyrene standards ranging from 474 to 7.5 × 106 g mol−1 (K = 14.1 × 10−5 dL g−1 and α = 0.70). Polymer concentrations were in the range of 3–5 mg mL−1. The ionic polythiophenes were analyzed on a 1260 infinity SEC system from Agilent Technologies with UV (200 nm) and RI detector, a Zorbax PSM Bimodal column (6.2 × 250 mm, 5 μm) at 30 °C, hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) with potassium trifluoroacetate (0.1 M) as the eluent, 1 mL min−1 elution speed, and calibrated with linear PMMA standards from Agilent (Polymer Laboratories).
Monomer synthesis
2,5-Dibromo-3-(6-bromohexyl)thiophene (M1) was prepared using a modified procedure based on literature protocols by Bäuerle44 and Miyanishi.24 More detailed information is provided in the ESI (Scheme S1†).
Precursor polymer synthesis: poly[3-(6-bromohexyl)thiophene] (P3BHT)24
Monomer M1 (0.51 g, 1.27 mmol) was added to a flame-dried three-neck flask and dissolved in dry THF (15 mL). The reaction mixture was put under inert atmosphere and heated to reflux temperature. A MeMgBr solution (0.65 M in THF, 1.96 mL, 1.27 mmol, 1 equiv.) was added and the mixture was stirred for 1 h at reflux temperature. To start the polymerization, 0.8 mol% of Ni(dppp)Cl2 (5.5 mg, 0.01 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at reflux temperature. The polymer was precipitated into an ice cold HCl–MeOH (5%) mixture and filtered off on a PTFE membrane (47 mm/0.45 μm). The crude polymer was purified using Soxhlet extraction for 24 h with methanol, n-hexane and chloroform, respectively. After evaporation of the solvent, the polymer was redissolved in chloroform and precipitated again from methanol, filtered, washed with methanol and dried, affording P3BHT as a black powder (0.153 g, 49%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 6.96 (s, 1H), 3.41 (t, J = 6.7 Hz, 2H), 2.81 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, 2H), 1.88 (q, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), 1.71 (br, 2H), 1.56–1.41 (m, 4H); UV-Vis (CHCl3, nm): λmax = 440; SEC (THF, PS standards): Mn = 1.2 × 104 g mol−1, Mw = 3.5 × 104 g mol−1, D = 3.1.
Polymer functionalization with N-methylimidazole: poly{3-[6-(1-methylimidazolium-3-yl)hexyl]thiophene} bromide (P3(mim)HT-Br)

P3BHT (0.050 g, Mn = 1.2 × 104 g mol−1, D = 3.1) was suspended in acetonitrile (1 mL) in a 10 mL vial and N-methylimidazole (1 mL) was added. The vial was filled with argon and closed. The suspension was heated at 70 °C for 48 h in the dark before it was added dropwise to Et2O and a dark red precipitate was obtained. The precipitated polymer was filtered off using a PTFE membrane (47 mm/0.45 μm) and (freeze-)dried carefully, affording P3(mim)HT-Br as a purple-black powder (0.061 g, 91%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ = 9.39 (s, 1H), 7.85 (s, 1H), 7.75 (s, 1H), 7.21 (s, 1H), 4.21 (br, 2H), 3.87 (s, 3H), 2.78 (br, 2H), 1.81 (br, 2H), 1.64 (br, 2H), 1.46–1.24 (m, 4H); UV-Vis (MeOH, nm): λmax = 442; SEC (HFIP, PMMA standards): Mn = 1.9 × 104 g mol−1, Mw = 6.6 × 104 g mol−1, D = 3.5.
Counter ion exchange: poly{3-[6-(1-methylimidazolium-3-yl)hexyl]thiophene} bis(trifluorosulfonyl)imide (P3(mim)HT-TFSI)

P3(mim)HT-Br (0.040 g) was dissolved in distilled water (4 mL) and a solution of Li-TFSI (0.4 g, 1.4 mmol) in distilled water (1 mL) was added dropwise. A precipitate was immediately formed and the mixture was stirred for another 8 h at rt. The sticky precipitate was filtered off on a regenerated cellulose membrane (47 mm/0.45 μm) and dried under vacuum, affording P3(mim)HT-TFSI as a sticky black powder (54 mg, 84%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ = 9.06 (s, 1H), 7.71 (s, 1H), 7.67 (s, 1H), 7.15 (s, 1H), 4.13 (br, 2H), 3.82 (s, 3H), 2.77 (br, 2H), 1.78 (br, 2H), 1.63 (br, 2H), 1.44–1.22 (m, 4H); UV-Vis (MeOH, nm): λmax = 443; SEC (HFIP, PMMA standards): Mn = 1.6 × 104 g mol−1, Mw = 8.4 × 104 g mol−1, D = 5.4.
Device fabrication
Devices were prepared using the meniscus coating technique (Fig. 2).20,21 The choice for this non-standard technique was based on the high quality of the solution-processed films that can be obtained by this method20 and the extremely low material usage.45 A drop of solution is placed in between the substrate and the bottom of a flat blade (3 by 20 mm). Because the distance between the blade and the substrate is small (0.2 mm), the drop is maintained within the gap by capillary forces creating the so-called meniscus. When moving the blade over the substrate, this meniscus is stretched, leaving behind a thin film of the organic material. The resulting dry film thickness is primarily determined by the drawing speed of the blade and its distance to the substrate.20,46
 Fig. 2  Schematic drawing of the meniscus coating technique. 
Pre-patterned ITO-covered glass substrates (http://www.naranjosubstrates.com) were first pre-cleaned by a standard procedure in detergent (5 min), deionized water (5 min) and isopropanol (5 min) using an ultrasonic bath. Then the samples were transferred to a UV-ozone lamp for 15 min and 70 nm of PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS™ P VP AI 4083, aqueous dispersion, 1.3–1.7% solid content, Heraeus) was spin-coated immediately after the ozone treatment. The residual water was removed from the PEDOT:PSS layer by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. Then approx. 50 nm of the P3(mim)HT-TFSI polymer was deposited from a 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propanol (TFP; 10 mg mL−1) solution using the meniscus coating technique (Fig. 2). For a 50 nm thick P3(mim)HT-TFSI film, the drawing speed of the blade was 20 mm s−1, and the gap between the blade and the substrate was 0.2 mm, corresponding to approximately 43 μL of solution. After deposition, the polymer layer was left to dry for approx. 1 min and 40 nm of PC61BM (Solenne) was deposited on top from a chlorobenzene solution (20 mg mL−1) by the same technique. The drawing speed of the blade in the case of the fullerene film was varied from 20 mm s−1 up to 40 mm s−1, resulting in film thicknesses between 30 and 60 nm. To complete the devices, samples were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box (1 ppm O2 and <0.1 ppm H2O) where 5 nm of Ba and 70 nm of Ag were evaporated as a cathode (<5 × 10−6 mbar). Solar cells (active area 9 mm2) were illuminated by a white light halogen lamp in combination with interference filters for the EQE (external quantum efficiency) and J–V measurements (MiniSun simulator by ECN, the Netherlands). An estimation of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) under standard test conditions was calculated by convolving the EQE spectrum with the AM1.5G reference spectrum, using the premise of a linear dependence of Jsc on light intensity. J–V characteristics of the solar cells were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter. All characterization was performed in a nitrogen-filled glove box (1 ppm O2 and <0.1 ppm H2O) without device encapsulation. AFM measurements were performed with a multimode SPM-Nanoscope IVa controller (Veeco) in tapping mode. Sharp silicon probes type PPP-NCH were purchased from Nanosensors (∼42 N m−1, ∼330 kHz). All AFM images were processed with WSxM software from Nanotec Electrónica S.L.
Results and discussion
Polymer synthesis and characterization
In order to synthesize the desired ionic polythiophenes, a highly regioregular (rr) precursor homopolymer was prepared first using the standard Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization protocol (Scheme 1).23,47–49 The isolated yield for the polymerization of 2,5-dibromo-3-(6-bromohexyl)thiophene (M1) towards P3BHT24,39–41 was ∼50% (not including the 15–25% loss of the non-selective transmetalation), with average molecular weights Mn = 1.2 × 104 and Mw = 3.5 × 104. The rather broad distribution (D = 3.1) is mainly due to the high sensitivity of the GRIM method to traces of moisture in the reaction mixture and impurities in the monomer solution. Functionalization of the precursor polymer with N-methylimidazole was performed over 2 days to ensure complete conversion to the ionic polythiophene derivative P3(mim)HT-Br (Scheme 1).37–42 The polymer was precipitated in the non-solvent diethyl ether, washed several times with ether and used without any further purification. The resulting ionic polymer was soluble in polar solvents such as water, methanol, DMF and DMSO. UV-Vis absorption spectra of the polymer material in solution showed a distinct broadening and red-shift in water, compared to the absorbance in methanol and DMF (Fig. S2†). Although in methanol and DMSO the polymer seems molecularly dissolved, some problems were encountered upon filtration of the solutions before preparing the devices. Some extent of aggregation seems to occur at the concentrations used for devices (which is not apparent in the UV-Vis studies nor by the naked eye). The bromide counter ions of P3(mim)HT-Br were then exchanged for more apolar bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (TFSI) organic counter ions (Scheme 1) to render the polymer less hygroscopic and more soluble in solvents suitable for bi-layer processing.50 After anion exchange, the P3(mim)HT-TFSI polymer was not soluble anymore in water (nor in THF, chloroform or chlorobenzene), but it was still soluble in acetone, acetonitrile and TFP. This solubility behaviour enables to use this ionic polymer for the construction of neat bi-layer devices. TFP was chosen since it is a good and environmentally acceptable solvent for film casting.
From 1H NMR characterization of the obtained polymers (Fig. S1†) one can easily see that the substitution protocol was successful, by following the shift of the protons on the side-chain carbon atoms next to the end groups, going from 3.41 ppm (in CDCl3) for the P3BHT polymer to 4.21 ppm (in DMSO-d6) for P3(mim)HT-Br and 4.13 ppm (in DMSO-d6) for the final P3(mim)HT-TFSI polymer. The aromatic protons of the imidazole moiety also showed a shift when the counter ion was exchanged. The exchange was quantitative (within the NMR detection limit) as no residual peaks of P3(mim)HT-Br were found in the P3(mim)HT-TFSI spectrum.
Device construction and analysis
The ionic polythiophenes were then applied as donor materials together with PC61BM as the acceptor in a simple bi-layer configuration, as is shown in Fig. 3. The film absorption spectrum of P3(mim)HT-TFSI (as casted from TFP) is blue-shifted with respect to that of a film of rr-P3HT (Rieke metals, 4002-EE) (Fig. 4). The origin of this blue-shift is not completely clear but it can indicate a poor packing of the chains, and as a consequence the typical absorption band around 600 nm is not observed. Yet, the absence of the higher wavelength absorption leads to a slightly higher bandgap for the P3(mim)HT-TFSI material. Additionally it was observed that, keeping the same thickness of the polythiophene layers, the P3(mim)HT-TFSI absorbs less light compared to the non-ionic polymer. The difference in absorbance might be (partly) due to the slightly lower density of the conjugated polythiophene part by the addition of bulky ionic groups at the periphery of the polymer chains.

To find optimal thicknesses of the layers a series of device experiments was performed in which the polymer layer thickness was kept constant (between 45 and 50 nm) and the PC61BM layer thickness was varied from 30 to 60 nm. Fig. 5 and Table 1 show the average output parameters collected from approximately four solar cells for each PC61BM film thickness. The best values in the series were obtained for a PC61BM layer of 40 nm, resulting in an average PCE of 0.5%. This optimum PC61BM thickness was then used for the remaining experiments described below.

To ensure that there was no intermixing between the active layers, a series of simple experiments was performed. First, the absorption of a thin layer of P3(mim)HT-TFSI was measured. The absorption of the thin film was also repeatedly determined after subsequent washing steps with chlorobenzene. No notable changes were observed after as much as 10 washing steps (Fig. S4–S5†). These results showed that no P3(mim)HT-TFSI was removed by exposure to chlorobenzene. To verify if the PC61BM did not diffuse into the polymer layer, a PC61BM layer was deposited on top of the ionic polymer, dried either at room temperature or at 150 °C, and then removed by washing with chlorobenzene. After the washing step, the absorption spectrum for both experiments was identical to the pristine P3(mim)HT-TFSI layer, suggesting that all PC61BM material was removed and no PC61BM had diffused into the donor layer.
For the optimized bi-layer solar cells the incident photon to current efficiencies (IPCE) versus wavelength were determined (Fig. 6). The highest efficiencies were obtained close to 400 nm where the principal absorber is PC61BM. The P3(mim)HT-TFSI polymer has an absorption maximum at ∼450 nm, which is in agreement with the secondary maximum visible in the IPCE curve around that wavelength. The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves (Fig. 6) were reasonably rectangular, resulting in good fill factors (∼60%). The Voc for these cells is rather typical (∼0.6 V). The current density is significantly lower than observed for P3HT/PCBM BHJ devices, due to the limited interface in these planar cells and additionally due to the lower light absorption in the P3(mim)HT-TFSI layer. The finding that no increase of the current was observed with increasing PC61BM layer thickness is an extra indication that the bi-layers formed are “neat”, without intermixing at the interface. If such intermixing would occur, the current would increase proportionally to the active layer thickness, as is usually observed in BHJ devices.14

To put the key performance characteristics of the solution-processed devices in perspective they were compared to those obtained from cells prepared via the dry film transfer method recently published by Tada et al. (Table 2).15 The results obtained from the solution-processed bi-layer cells are comparable with those obtained from the dry transfer method. The slightly lower current observed in the solution-processed layer is compensated for by a higher Voc.15,25,35,36 It should be noted as well that all devices presented were very reproducible, even if repeated after some period of time and using different batches of the same polymer (see ESI, Table S1 and S2†).

Even though the absorbance of the P3(mim)HT-TFSI polymer is blue-shifted and partially overlapping with that of PC61BM, its presence in the device is important, as is shown below. A PC61BM-only device (ITO/PEDOT-70 nm/PC61BM-50 nm/Ba-5 nm/Ag-70 nm) was prepared and compared with devices with a thin and normal P3(mim)HT-TFSI layer (∼20 and 50 nm, respectively). Using meniscus coating it was possible to prepare very high quality PC61BM films, as evidenced by the reasonable J–V curve for a PC61BM film of only 50 nm thickness. It is clear from Fig. 6 and the values reported in Table 2 that without the polymer layer the excitons created within the PC61BM layer do not contribute much to the current. With the addition of a thin layer of P3(mim)HT-TFSI, the excitons can efficiently dissociate at the interface leading to a reasonable current flow in the device. Moreover, the high fill factors of the cells (over 60%) reveal excellent film-forming properties of the ionic polymer (as can also be seen from AFM, Fig. S3†).
The highest efficiency is observed for the device with the thicker P3(mim)HT-TFSI layer, which could have been expected based on its superior optical density compared to the thinner one (see Fig. S6†). Nevertheless, the corresponding increase in IPCE (around 400 nm) is higher than what the increased absorption can account for. An explanation for this can (partly) be provided by means of (transfer matrix) optical simulation.51 This revealed that, when a thicker polymer layer is present in the device stack, the electric field intensity in the active layer (polymer + PC61BM) originating from light around 400 nm appears to be much higher compared to the intensity from higher wavelength light (see Fig. S7†). As a result, the IPCE around 400 nm is improved.
Finally, since a significant part of the current of the cell originates from the fullerene layer, we decided to switch from PC61BM to PC71BM (Fig. 1), which has a much broader absorption. The comparison between bi-layer cells using the different fullerenes as acceptor layers is shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3. As expected, the current of the cells increased significantly, improving the cell efficiency up to 1.6%, which is a good value for this type of structures.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we report on polythiophenes with pendant ionic liquid-like side chains as a promising class of materials for organic solar cells. The main difference between a non-ionic and an ionic polythiophene is the fact that the latter one is not soluble in chlorobenzene, thus enabling processing of bi-layer configurations from solution. We have shown that our modified P3(mim)HT-TFSI polymer shows the same or even slightly superior performance as compared to standard P3HT in a bi-layer configuration. We underline that the ionic P3HT derivative shows excellent film-forming properties and devices were highly reproducible. Using it in combination with PC71BM as the acceptor, power conversion efficiencies of 1.6% were achieved for simple solution-processed bi-layer solar cells. An important benefit of the imidazolium-substituted ionic polythiophene scaffold over alternative polar polythiophene structures37–42 is the smooth tunability of the chemical structure – polymer architecture (e.g. random and block copolymers varying the density and organization of ionic groups), side chain structure, counter ion – starting from simple precursor monomers, which allows to optimize the material properties towards different OPV applications. Activities in this direction are ongoing in our groups.52,53
