, Accepted 7th August 2013First published on 29th August 2013AbstractIn this work, we demonstrate the importance of the interface between FTO and TiO2 on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and carried out the modification on such an interface by utilizing self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with multiple carboxylic acid functional groups. The SAMs were passivated on the FTO electrode surface prior to the fabrication of the TiO2 absorption layer. Charge transfer through the FTO/TiO2 junction after the SAM modification process was shown to be improved compared to the pristine device interface without SAM modification. Careful investigation indicated that the extreme hydrophilic nature of the SAMs fabricated on FTO and the possible chemical interaction between the SAMs and TiO2 facilitated the TiO2 initial layer to be more compact and crystalline in nature, resulting in a decrease of the impedance and an increase of the electron mobility in the FTO/TiO2 junction. Thus, the photocurrent and the overall conversion efficiency of the DSSCs was increased. The largest improvement in the cell conversion efficiency was from 7.7% to 9.1% under AM1.5G (1 sun).
Introduction
Photovoltaics (PVs) have been extensively studied due to their potential as clean and economical sources of energy. Among them, PVs that utilize organic species as the active material have attracted widespread interest owing to their low cost, easy production and potential for large-area fabrication.1–5 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), an efficient type of thin-film photovoltaics, are a promising class which have the potential to overtake conventional silicon-based PVs. DSSCs have been the subject of very intensive academic and industrial research over the past 20 years6 since the pioneering research was reported by O'Regan and Grätzel.7 Recently, overall conversion efficiencies of 10 to 12% have been achieved.8–10 Typically, a DSSC consists of three main components: a photoanode, which is usually a dye-sensitized n-type wide band gap semiconductor (such as TiO2) film deposited onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass; an electrolyte solution containing I−/I3− as the redox couple, in contact with a counter electrode, which is a platinum (Pt)-coated FTO conducting glass.11 The mechanism of DSSCs is based on the dye absorption of photons from the solar spectrum during illumination (with light of energy greater than the bandgap of the semiconductor) of the cell; electrons are injected from the photoexcited dye into the conduction band of a semiconducting oxide. They are then transported through a transparent conducting electrode into an external circuit. The dye is regenerated by electron transfer from the iodide ions, which are dissolved in the electrolyte solution. The triiodide ions formed during the reaction diffuse to the counter electrode where they are reduced back to iodide by the electrons which have been transported through the external circuit.
Numerous investigations have been carried out globally to study various materials for the different components of DSSC to improve the conversion efficiency, including the substrate, semiconductor oxide, dye, electrolyte and the electrodes.12 As a result, many factors influencing the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs have been investigated: molar absorption coefficient, energetically suitable HOMO–LUMO levels, available surface area for dyes, transport kinetics of the electrons, regeneration by a redox couple, and the losses of recombination and back reactions.13 Among the components of DSSCs, photoelectrodes have been studied intensively. TiO2 is one of the most widely used n-type large band gap semiconductors, with an energy band gap of 3.2 eV.14 However, many other oxides, including zinc oxide (ZnO),15 tin oxide (SnO2),16 iron oxide (Fe2O3),17 niobium oxide (Nb2O5),18 zirconium oxide (ZrO2)19 and aluminium oxide (Al2O3),20 have been investigated for photoelectrical conversion even though they have low conversion efficiencies.
Though the optimization and quest of the individual components of DSSCs have been given due consideration in order to increase the overall power conversion efficiency, the literature reports that the conversion efficiency has increased by 2–3% in nearly two decades of intense research.8,21 Thus, except for the seeking of new materials, other approaches, for instance, the improvement of the interfaces among the different components, are required to be investigated to further improve the conversion efficiency for the development of commercially viable DSSCs. Many reports have described that a compact TiO2 under layer improves the conversion efficiency of DSSC.22–24 The hydrolysis of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) is one of the methods to introduce the compact layer on the FTO surface.25 However, the correlation between the photovoltaic properties and the TiCl4-treated compact-layer thickness has not been clearly investigated yet.26
The approach which has recently received attention is interfacial modification using various materials such as SAMs. This approach is believed to provide a unique way to change the properties of the surface to be modified, which in turn improves the overall efficiency of the DSSC device.27–32 Among the variety of phenomena which manifest on the surface are wetting phenomena (hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity), electronic phenomena (from affecting band bending and work function to charge conduction), and the ability to form tailored three-dimensional supramolecular arrays by attaching a specific molecule or particle to an external functional group.33 For example, introducing a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) in the interface between the ITO and PEDOT:PSS layers improved the device stability.34 Another report demonstrated that surface treatment of TiO2 photoanodes improved the surface morphology and promoted interactions between the sensitizer and the TiO2 surface.35
In this article, we focused on the interface between FTO and TiO2, which has rarely been investigated, and demonstrated the importance of such interfacial properties on the performance of DSSCs. We present an approach which inserts SAMs with carboxylic acid (–COOH) groups in the interface between the FTO and TiO2 layers. The charge transfer impedance at the FTO/TiO2 junction was reduced, while the charge mobility was increased. As a result, the overall efficiency of the device was significantly increased as compared to the DSSCs without SAM modification.
Experimental section
Materials
The molecules employed in the fabrication of SAMs were terephthalic acid (B2C), benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid (B4C) and benzene hexacarboxylic acid (B6C), which were obtained from Aldrich. The dye used in the study was cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,20-bipyridyl-4,40-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719), obtained from Solaronix. The FTO was purchased from Merck, and the TiO2 paste was obtained from Everlight Chemical. The acetonitrile and ethanol were acquired from Acros.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes
The FTO glass was cleaned by sonicating in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially, each for 30 min. The FTO substrates were then immersed in pure EtOH solution (pristine) or 1 mM EtOH solutions of the respective SAM molecules (B2C, B4C or B6C) for 24 h. Thereafter, the substrates were removed, rinsed thoroughly with fresh EtOH and dried under a stream of N2 gas. A commercially available TiO2 paste was doctor-bladed on the pristine or SAM-modified FTO glass to form a 6 μm absorption layer. The TiO2 film was allowed to dry at room temperature for 15 min prior to removal of the spacer, and then subsequently sintered at 120 °C for 50 min and slowly increased to 500 °C. Afterwards, a 4 μm TiO2 scattering layer was fabricated on top of the absorption layer by the same process. Thereafter, the TiO2-coated FTO was soaked in a 0.4 μM N719 dye acetonitrile solution for a period of 24 h to adsorb enough of the dye as the sensitizer.
Device fabrication
The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode comprising the SAM-modified FTO substrates (photoanode) and Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich-type cell. An electrolyte containing 5 × 10−2 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) in a mixture of 10 mL acetonitrile was injected in between the two electrodes. The devices were finally sealed with glass to avoid evaporation of the electrolyte.
Characterization
The properties of the pristine and SAM-modified FTO were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS; VG Thermo Theta Probe) and a water contact angle (CA) meter (Creating Nano Technologies Inc.). The properties of the TiO2 working electrodes were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JSM-6500F, JEOL Ltd.), atomic force microscopy (AFM; ICON, Bruker) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD; PANalytical X'Pert PRO). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out, and thin-film transistors (TFT) were fabricated to analyze the charge transfer properties of the FTO/TiO2 interfaces. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source under illumination by an AM1.5G class A solar simulator (Oriel) at 100 mW cm−2, referenced to a standard silicon cell. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured by a JASCO 550A spectrometer.
Result and discussion
The chemical structures of the three SAM molecules (B2C, B4C, and B6C) are presented in Fig. 1a. To characterize the properties of the SAM-modified FTO surfaces, we performed CA measurements and XPS. The contact angle of the pristine FTO surface was also offered as a reference, as presented in Fig. 1b. Since –COOH is a strongly hydrophilic functional group, a decrease in the CA with respect to the increased number of –COOH groups would be anticipated. In addition, a clear chemical shift at ∼289 eV in the C 1s XPS spectrum can be observed for all of the SAM-modified FTO substrates (Fig. S1, ESI†). Such a chemical shift denotes the non-bonded –COOH group.34 From the C 1s spectra, we calculated the ratio of carbon in the non-bonded –COOH group to the total quantity of carbon, and listed the results in the table in Fig. S1.† From the table, it is clear that the number of free –COOH on the SAM-modified FTO surfaces increased with respect to the –COOH number of the SAM molecules, which further confirmed our expectations.

To investigate the effects of SAM/FTO modification on the photo conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSCs, we fabricated four different devices, one with a pristine FTO surface and three with B2C, B4C and B6C SAM-modified FTOs. The device fabrication process is indicated in the inset of Fig. 2.

Fig. 2 shows the J–V characteristics obtained from the pristine and SAM-modified DSSCs. The photovoltaic characteristics of these DSSCs are summarized in Table 1. After the modification of FTO with B2C, B4C and B6C SAMs, we observed that the short circuit current density (Jsc) significantly increased from 16.50 (pristine) to 17.00, 17.65 and 18.29 mA cm−2 for the B2C, B4C and B6C SAM-modified devices respectively, while the open-circuit voltage (Voc) remained almost unchanged. As a result the overall conversion efficiency (η) improved from 7.70 (standard) to 7.99 (B2C), 8.29 (B4C) and 8.73% (B6C), as indicated in Table 1. Notably, the series resistance (Rs) decreased with respect to the increased –COOH number in the SAM molecules, that is, pristine > B2C > B4C > B6C. The most remarkable conversion efficiency, which is a 13% enhancement, was observed for the device modified with the B6C SAM. This efficiency increase is mainly due to an increase in Jsc.

To confirm the effect of the SAMs on the PCE of the DSSCs, UV-Vis absorption spectra (UV-Vis) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out. The photon absorption of the pristine and SAM-modified devices showed negligible changes, as demonstrated by the UV-Vis results in Fig. 3a, which indicated that nearly the same amount of dye was loaded in each sample. This in turn leads us to conclude that no significant differences in the TiO2 surface exist among all of the samples, as dye loading is directly related to the surface area.
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-Vis absorption and (b) external quantum efficiency spectra of the pristine and SAM-modified DSSCs. 
However, significant changes can be observed to the EQE upon the SAM modification, as demonstrated in Fig. 3b. A clear trend was evident, that the EQE increased with respect to the increased number of –COOH on the SAM molecules across the entire absorption spectrum, which correlates well with the I–V measurement results. Furthermore, we compared the device characteristics of the pristine and SAM-modified DSSCs by showing the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the cell devices in Fig. S2.† An improvement of the IQE for the SAM-modified cells across the entire spectrum, particularly for the B6C-modified DSSC, was evident compared to the pristine device. Notably, an enhanced peak at ∼700 nm for B6C can be observed from the IQE spectra, possibly due to the small changes at the absorption tail of the dye molecules, which might not be a real enhanced peak. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the enhanced Jsc is due to the improved electrical properties of the devices upon the SAM modification.
Since the SAM modification varied only the properties of the FTO/TiO2 interfaces, for a better understanding of the effect of the SAMs, we focused on the properties of the FTO/TiO2 interfaces upon the SAM modification. For the fabrication of the TiO2 working electrode, the TiO2 paste was coated on FTO and then sintered at ∼120 °C for 50 min, before increasing the sintering temperature to 500 °C for 10 min to complete the heating procedure. We performed XPS measurements on the SAM/FTO at room temperature and after sintering at 200 °C and 500 °C. The results are shown in Fig. S3.† From the results, it is clear that the SAMs remained intact after sintering at 200 °C. However, degradation of the SAM molecules occurred upon the temperature increase to 500 °C, shown by the intensity of the peaks corresponding to –COOH decreasing.
Electrochemical impedance is a measure of the ability of a circuit to resist the flow of electrical current. Several reports have revealed that electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can be used for investigating the kinetics and energetics of transport and recombination in DSSCs.36,37 Thus, to determine the charge transfer impedance in the FTO/TiO2 interfaces in our case, we performed EIS measurements for the DSSCs comprised of pristine and SAM-modified FTO substrates. The Nyquist plots of the pristine and SAM-modified DSSCs are indicated in Fig. 4, and the equivalent circuit38 for analysis is presented in the inset of Fig. 4. The measured data are presented by circles while the fitted results are demonstrated by solid lines. The semicircle profile of the Nyquist plot of a DSSC represents the charge transfer resistances at different interfaces. We observe the first semicircle (at high frequency) corresponding to the charge transfer impedance at the FTO/TiO2 interface, the second semicircle (mid frequency range) is associated with the charge transfer impedance of the TiO2 electrode and the dye/electrolyte interface, and the third semicircle (low frequency) is related to the charge transfer impedance of the diffusion processes in the electrolyte.39,40 The charge transfer rate at each interface can be compared based on the radius of the semicircles. A larger radius represents a larger charge transfer impedance, and a smaller radius represents a smaller charge transfer impedance. The estimated values of the charge transfer impedance for each interface of both the pristine and SAM-modified DSSC devices are presented in Table 2. The SAM-modified devices showed a significant decrease in the charge transfer impedance at the FTO/TiO2 interface compared to the pristine cell, suggesting that electrons are easily transferred to the charge collector. Moreover, the impedance decreased as the number of –COOH on the SAM molecules increased. The EIS results were consistent with the Rs values, which suggested that the improved Jsc of the DSSCs upon the SAM modification was due to the reduced interfacial resistance of FTO/TiO2.

To study the effect of the SAM modification on the interfacial resistance, we fabricated ∼150 nm thickness TiO2 layers (initial layers) on both the pristine and SAM-modified FTO with an identical sintering procedure as for fabricating the working electrode for the devices. To evaluate the surface morphology, we carried out SEM measurements. The surface morphology of the TiO2 on pristine and SAM-modified FTO is shown in Fig. 5. The SEM images reveal that the TiO2 on the SAM-modified FTO surfaces are more packed compared to the TiO2 film on the pristine FTO. For instance, high roughness with large holes in the surface are obvious for the TiO2 layer on pristine FTO (Fig. 5a). However, a smoother surface with only small pin holes can be evidently observed for the TiO2 generated on B6C-modified FTO (Fig. 5d). In addition, the compact nature of the TiO2 surfaces would be in the order: B6C > B4C > B2C > pristine, as demonstrated in Fig. 5. In addition, we obtained cross-sectional SEM images, as revealed in Fig. S4.† Although the cross-sectional images are not convenient to quantify the surface area, it is helpful to describe the compactness of the film qualitatively. As can be seen from the cross-sectional images, the TiO2 film on the B6C SAM-modified FTO exhibited the most packed morphology compared to the others, and the pristine film revealed the poorest packing configuration. This can be further confirmed by the surface roughness measured by AFM. The roughness of the TiO2 initial layer fabricated on pristine and B2C, B4C and B6C-modified FTO are 32.9, 30.4, 28.5 and 24.5 nm, respectively (Fig. S5† and Table 3). Though the difference is not large among the pristine, B2C and B4C samples, a significant change in roughness is observed between the pristine and B6C samples. Thus, it is suggested that the decrease in the charge transfer impedance at the FTO/TiO2 interfaces of the DSSCs for the SAM-modified devices is due to the compact nature of the initial TiO2 layer.24 From Fig. 1, we observed that the contact angles of the pristine and SAM-modified FTO were in the order: pristine > B2C > B4C > B6C. Among them, the B6C-modified FTO substrate showed an extreme hydrophilic nature. Therefore, it is proposed that the hydrophilic nature of the FTO modified by SAMs assisted the initial TiO2 layer in being more compact once fabricated on FTO. This is rational since the TiO2 paste was also hydrophilic. As a result, such a compact constitution of the TiO2 layer results in the decrease of charge transfer impedance at the FTO/TiO2 interface.

Moreover, as for the fabrication of the TiO2 electrode, the TiO2 layer was first heated at 120 °C for 50 min. We performed the SEM measurements on TiO2/FTO and the TiO2 fabricated on the most hydrophilic surface, B6C-SAM/FTO, at room temperature and after the sintering at 120 °C, to investigate the effect of the SAMs on the morphology of the TiO2 layers upon sintering at this temperature. The images are revealed in Fig. S6.† At room temperature, the as-passivated TiO2 layers on FTO (S6a†) and SAM-modified FTO (S6c†) show minor differences in the morphological constitution, although small holes can be observed on the TiO2/FTO. However, significant differences can be clearly seen upon sintering the TiO2 films at 120 °C for 50 min. High roughness with large pores in the surface were evident of the TiO2 layer on pristine FTO (Fig. S6b†). Meanwhile, a smoother and more compact surface can be clearly observed for the TiO2 fabricated on B6C/FTO (Fig. S6d†). From these results, we conclude that the densification improvement of the TiO2 modified with SAMs occurs at the sintering temperature of 120 °C.
Afterwards, we performed XRD to investigate the effect of the SAMs on the crystallinity of the TiO2 initial layer. The results in Fig. S7† showed only moderate TiO2 peak intensities, possibly due to the film being too thin. Nevertheless, the characteristic peak at ∼25° for the TiO2 initial layer on the pristine and SAM-modified FTO can be assigned as the (101) plane of the anatase crystal structure (JCPDS no. 21-1272). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (101) peaks for TiO2 on pristine and SAM-modified FTO were 0.55 and 0.52, respectively. It has been reported that both the SAMs and their residuals (due to thermal decomposition) could facilitate modulation of the crystallinity of the oxide films during the fabrication process.41 Therefore, it is rational to believe that the improved crystallinity of the TiO2 initial layers is due to its facilitation by the SAMs and residuals during the device fabrication process. Such an improvement may facilitate the electron mobility in the TiO2 layer and help to improve the Jsc. To study the charge mobility in the TiO2 layer, we fabricated thin film transistors (TFTs) comprised of TiO2 on pristine and SAM-modified oxide surfaces, by the same procedure used to fabricate the TiO2 electrodes of the DSSCs, as the active semiconductor layer. The SAM-modified TiO2 showed higher charge mobilities compared to the pristine TFT as indicated in Fig. S8† and Table 3. Moreover, the electron mobilities increased in the order: pristine < B2C < B4C < B6C SAM-modified TiO2.
To confirm that the hydrophilicity of the SAM molecules on the FTO surface is crucial to the performance of the DSSCs, we fabricated a SAM on FTO using benzoic acid (B1C) molecules, and then fabricated the DSSC device accordingly. The I–V measurement results of the pristine and B1C-modified devices are shown in Fig. 6, with the water contact angle of the B1C-modified FTO surface and the SEM image of the TiO2 initial layer fabricated on B1C/FTO in the inset. The I–V curves clearly demonstrate that the Jsc of the cell diminished upon the B1C fabrication. Moreover, the SEM image of the B1C-modified FTO shows a very rough, less packed morphology with small aggregates and holes in the TiO2 surface. The B1C molecule is comprised of a benzene ring and one carboxylic acid group, which has a similar structure and chemical composition to B2C, B4C and B6C but the lack of a free –COOH group when passivated on FTO. Therefore, we conclude that the number of free –COOH functional groups of the SAM is vital to the improvement of the DSSC performance upon the FTO/TiO2 interfacial modification.

To further confirm the effect of the hydrophilicity of the FTO surface on the device performance, we fabricated a DSSC device with a FTO surface treated with O2 plasma for 30 min (CA = 3.8°). The TiO2 layer was then immediately passivated on top of this hydrophilic FTO surface. The characteristics of the plasma-treated, the pristine and the SAM-modified DSSCs are summarized in Table S1.† The device performance of the plasma-treated device was better as compared to the pristine and B2C-modified DSSCs. This is rational as the surface of the plasma-treated FTO was more hydrophilic than the pristine and B2C-modified surfaces. However, the characteristics of the plasma-treated cell were poorer than for the B4C and B6C-modified DSSCs, and the CA of the plasma-treated FTO is lower than for the B4C and B6C-modified surfaces. This is possibly due to the increase in resistance of the FTO caused by the plasma deterioration of the FTO. Nevertheless, such a plasma-treated device evidenced the impact of surface hydrophilicity on the DSSC performance.
Finally, we utilized 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4′-propargyloxyphenyl)-Cu(II)-phthalocyanine (B16C), a molecule with 16 –COOH functional groups as the interfacial modifier to fabricate the DSSC device. The I–V measurement results shown in Fig. S9† revealed that the Jsc increased to 18.64 mA cm−2, and the FF improved to 63.7% due to the lowering of the Rs. The overall efficiency of the B16C-modified DSSC was improved to 9.14%.
Summary
In summary, the DSSCs with carboxylic acid SAM modification showed an enhancement of the Jsc compared to the pristine cell. The hydrophilic nature of the SAMs fabricated on the FTO facilitated the TiO2 initial layer to be more compact and with better crystallinity, resulting in a decrease of the impedance of the FTO/TiO2 junction and enhancement of the electron mobility in the TiO2 layer, which assisted the improvement of the Jsc and led to a higher PCE of the DSSCs. Moreover, the degree of improvement of the devices was associated with the number of –COOH groups in the SAM molecules. Our findings show the importance of the interfacial properties between FTO and TiO2 on the performance of the DSSCs, and suggest a simple approach for the modification of FTO.
