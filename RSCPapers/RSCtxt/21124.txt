    , Accepted 31st March 2021First published on 31st March 2021AbstractThe chemical state of Pt in cocatalysts has a major influence on the activity and selectivity of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear owing to the co-existence of different Pt chemical states and mutual transformation between them. In this study, PtO/TiO2 catalysts were prepared through photodeposition and Pt/TiO2 was prepared by the photoreduction of PtO/TiO2 to avoid interference arising from co-existing Pt forms and different loading amounts. These catalysts exhibited completely reversed selectivity for CO and CH4 production during CO2 photoreduction: PtO/TiO2 tended to produce CO (100%), whereas Pt/TiO2 favored the production of CH4 (66.6%). By combining experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, the difference in selectivity was ascribed to the different charge transfer/separation and CO/H adsorption properties of PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2. Photoelectric and photoluminescence (PL) analysis showed that Pt was more advantageous to the photogenerated carrier separation compared with PtO, which was conducive to the multi-electron CH4 reduction reaction. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption/temperature-programmed reduction, and density functional theory calculations indicated that the adsorption of CO and hydrogen on Pt was stronger than that on PtO, which favored the further reduction of CO to CH4. Based on the above results, a mechanism was proposed to explain the reversed selectivity of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over Pt/TiO2 and PtO/TiO2.
Introduction
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 may have applications in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the production of solar fuels; thus, this reaction may be of great importance in solving climate change and the global energy crisis. Despite an initial focus on improving photocatalytic efficiency, researchers have gradually begun to consider how to convert CO2 into specific products and improve the selectivity of CO2 photocatalysis.1–4 As a cheap, stable semiconductor material with low toxicity, TiO2 can be used to study the activity and product selectivity of CO2 photoreduction. Therefore, researchers have attempted various strategies to modify TiO2, such as metal deposition,5,6 facet engineering,7–9 and construction of a heterojunction.10–12
The noble metal Pt has been used as cocatalyst to improve the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction and product selectivity,13–15 because metallic Pt can capture photogenerated electrons and act as the active site for CO2 reduction.16–20 It is noteworthy that oxidized Pt species usually co-exist with the metallic Pt particles, likely owing to the easily oxidation of metallic Pt nanoparticles.21–23 Therefore, it is important to investigate how the oxidation states of Pt nanoparticles affect CO2 photoreduction.
In previous studies, researchers have observed that oxidation states and the existence of different Pt species in co-catalysts can greatly affect the photocatalytic performance.24–26 For example, Xing et al.27 reported that a PtO cocatalyst was more conducive to photocatalytic H2 evolution than metallic Pt because the formed H2 could desorb easily from the PtO surface, suppressing the reverse oxidation reaction. Hu et al.28 studied photocatalytic NOx oxidation over Pt/TiO2 catalysts and reported that Pt4+ ions in the TiO2 lattice and PtO deposited on the surface of TiO2 enhanced visible light absorption and charge separation, resulting in high photocatalytic efficiency. In our previous study,29 we found that the presence of Pt2+ in the TiO2 lattice extended the light absorption of TiO2 and that a suitable Pt0/Pt2+ ratio could markedly enhance CO2 photoreduction. Nevertheless, clear understanding of the effects of Pt species with different chemical states during CO2 photoreduction remains difficult because they usually co-exist in different forms on Pt/TiO2 catalysts. Metallic Pt usually exists as nanoparticles, whereas the oxidized Pt species may be doped into the lattice of TiO2 and/or exist as Pt oxides on the surface of TiO2.30,31 In addition, the different Pt species may mutually transform during photocatalytic reactions,32 complicating the process. To further clarify the roles of different Pt species in CO2 photoreduction, it is necessary to determine the mechanism through which the chemical states of Pt co-catalysts affect CO2 photoreduction.
In this work, PtO/TiO2 catalysts were prepared via photodeposition, and Pt/TiO2 catalysts were prepared through further photoreduction of PtO/TiO2 catalysts with the aim of eliminating interference from co-existing forms and the loading amount of Pt species. The performance of Pt/TiO2 and PtO/TiO2 in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was evaluated and compared. The transfer and separation of photoexcited charges and the adsorption/desorption of intermediates over Pt/TiO2 and PtO/TiO2 were analyzed. Finally, a mechanism was proposed to explain the different selectivity of Pt/TiO2 and PtO/TiO2 catalysts.
Experimental results
Catalyst preparation

Synthesis of PtO/TiO2. 
PtO/TiO2 was prepared by photodeposition. First, 1 g of TiO2 (P25) was dispersed into 200 mL H2PtCl6 solution (the mass ratio of Pt to TiO2 was 1%), and stirred for 30 min to fully mix the components. The suspension was then irradiated by a Xe lamp under continuously stirring in air. After irradiation for 1 h, the solid samples were centrifuged, washed three times with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain PtO/TiO2.


Synthesis of Pt/TiO2. 
Pt/TiO2 was also prepared by photodeposition. To minimize the irrelevant variables in the comparison experiment and keep the loading concentration as consistent as possible, 1 g of the PtO/TiO2 sample obtained above was used as a raw material, dispersed into a 200 mL deionized water solution, and stirred for 30 min. The suspension was then irradiated by a Xe lamp under continuous stirring with N2 as a protective gas. After irradiation for 1 h, the solid samples were centrifuged, washed three times with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain Pt/TiO2.

Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all powder samples were recorded on an Empyrean diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) in the range of 20°–80°. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were obtained from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms measured at 77 K using a Micrometrics model ASAP 2000 instrument; all samples were degassed at 150 °C and 10−6 Torr for 3 h prior to the measurement. The concentration of Pt in the catalysts was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a SPECTRO ARCOS instrument. The surface atomic composition of the catalysts and the chemical states of Pt were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using Shimadzu/KRATOS AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W equipment with Al/MgKα radiation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 instrument. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed using a confocal laser LabRAM HR800 instrument with a 325 nm excitation light source. The UV-vis spectra of the samples were recorded over the wavelength range of 200–800 nm using a Lambda 35 spectrophotometer. Temperature-programmed H2 reduction (H2-TPR) measurements were conducted using an Autochem II 2920 instrument. Temperature-programmed CO desorption (CO-TPD) measurements were conducted using a ChemiSorb 2720 instrument.

In situ Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected using a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with a Praying Mantis DRIFTS accessory. The IR reaction cell (Harrick Scientific, HVC-DRP) was equipped with two ZnSe windows and a quartz window for IR- and UV-light transmission. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the UV-light source. First, the baseline was collected after continuous introduction of ultrapure N2 gas into the reactor cell filled with sample for at least 30 min.
In a typical humidified CO2 photoreduction IR experiment, humidified CO2 vapor was introduced to the IR reaction cell for 60 min, and the signal was collected. Then, the light source was switched on and the signal was recorded after irradiation for 60 min.
In a typical CO adsorption IR experiment, the sample was exposed to 1% CO/N2 flow for 30 min, and purged again with N2 for another 30 min until the gas phase CO signal was completely reduced and the catalyst surface adsorption spectra showed no obvious differences between the IR scans. Afterwards, CO adsorption spectra were collected.
Photoelectrochemical analysis
All photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed using a standard three-electrode electrochemical workstation (CHI770E) consisting of platinum foil as the counter electrode, ITO coated with a catalyst as the working electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM1.5 filter was used as the irradiation source and 0.5 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrode. The function of photocurrent density changing with time (J–t) was measured under a fixed bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at an amplitude of 5 mV and a frequency range of 0.01–100 kHz.
CO2 photocatalytic reduction
CO2 photocatalytic reduction experiments were conducted at 15 °C under UV-light irradiation in an internal circulated reaction system, as reported in our previous work.33 A 300 W Xe lamp was employed to supply the UV light irradiation (300 nm < λ < 400 nm, 20 mW cm−2). Typically, 20 mg of catalyst in a Petri dish (diameter, 40 mm) and 5 mL of deionized water were added to the bottom of the reactor. After the system was placed under vacuum, ultrapure CO2 (99. 999%) was injected to pressurize the reaction system to 71 kPa. A GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a methanizer was employed to analyze the concentrations of H2, CO, CH4, and hydrocarbons every hour. Blank experiments with CO2, catalyst, and illumination as control variables were performed before the reaction to ensure that the gas components detected by GC all resulted from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculation method
CO adsorption on Pt8O8/TiO2(101) and Pt12/TiO2(101) surfaces in different positions was studied by using periodic density functional theory (DFT).34,35 Generalized gradient approximation (GGA), based on the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional36 was used for the exchange–correlation energy. The Kohn–Sham one-electron valence states were expanded from a basis of plane waves with an energy cutoff of 450 eV. All calculations were performed by the CASTEP software package. The anatase TiO2(101) surface was modeled as a three-layer p(1 × 3) slab, corresponding to 36 TiO2 unit cells (108 atoms), to which a vacuum layer of 15 Å was applied and the top layer of TiO2 was allowed to relax. Because of the large size of the supercell, Monkhorst Pack mesh with Γ point k-point sampling in the surface Brillouin zone was used.37 The force convergence criterion in the structural was set to 0.05 eV Å−1. The adsorption energies were calculated using the equation Eads = Esys − Eiso, where Eads is the adsorption energy, Esys is the calculated total energy of the system, and Eiso is the summed energy of the isolated molecule and bare surface.
Results and discussion
CO2 photocatalytic performance
The cumulative production of CH4, CO, and H2 after UV irradiation for 8 h with PtO/TiO2, Pt/TiO2, and TiO2 as catalysts, is presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1. Production over PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 was increased compared over TiO2, but an even more noticeable difference was the different product selectivity of the catalysts. The selectivity of both TiO2 and PtO/TiO2 for CH4 was very poor. When PtO was loaded onto TiO2, the yield of CO and H2 increased significantly, by 43% and 47%, respectively, indicating that PtO loading could facilitate the generation of CO and H2. However, for Pt/TiO2, CH4 was produced and the yield reached 3.99 μmol g−1, while the production of CO was suppressed, indicating good selectivity for CH4. The cycling performance was analyzed to investigate the stability of PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), after 3 cycles over a total of 24 h, the total production has decreased by approximately 11% and 16%, respectively, demonstrating a good stability and sustainability. The reduction of CO2 to CH4 requires more electrons and protons than the production of CO. Therefore, to explore the reasons for the reversed selectivity – that is, after the reduction of PtO to Pt, the dominant product of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over the catalyst changes from CO to CH4 – the physicochemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed.

Structure and morphology
The XRD patterns (Fig. 2) showed that Pt and PtO loading did not change the crystal structure of TiO2. The peaks marked A are the characteristic peaks of anatase, and the peaks marked R are the characteristic peaks of rutile, indicating that the TiO2 in the three samples existed in a mixed phase of anatase and rutile; these findings were in good agreement with the literature.38 The ICP-OES results, listed in Table 2, confirmed that the Pt concentration of the prepared samples was consistent. The chemical states of the Pt species on the surface of catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 3a). A pair of peaks corresponding to Pt2+ were clearly observed in the spectra of PtO/TiO2 at to the binding energies of 72.7 eV and 75.8 eV.21,22 No obvious signal attributable to Pt0 was observed, indicating that Pt2+ was the dominant Pt species in PtO/TiO2. The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO2 indicated binding energies of 71.0 eV and 74.7 eV corresponding to Pt0, accompanied by two weak peaks of Pt2+, which may have been caused by the oxidation of Pt0 nanoparticles.23 It is generally believed that the binding energy of Pt0 as Pt 4f7/2 is 71.2 eV.39,40 In contrast, the peak in Fig. 3a had a slightly negative deviation, corresponding to the configurations of 2p for Ti (Fig. 3b) and 1s for O (Fig. 3c), which indicated the formation of a heterojunction between TiO2 and Pt and, consequently, the transfer of electrons from TiO2 to Pt.

 Fig. 3  XPS spectra of PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2. 
The HR-TEM images of PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 4a and f, and the size of the loaded particles is listed in Table 2. For PtO/TiO2, ultrafine PtO nanoparticles (average size 0.9 nm) were highly dispersed on the surface of TiO2; in contrast, for Pt/TiO2, the Pt nanoparticles obtained by PtO reduction were clearly larger (average size 1.9 nm) and there were fewer particles. In addition, the size distribution of PtO particles was much narrower than that of Pt particles. These findings indicated that Pt nanoparticles migrated and grew up during the photoreduction process of PtO. As shown in the HADDF-STEM images (Fig. 4b and g), the PtO and Pt nanoparticles were distributed evenly on the TiO2 surface. To further verify the components of PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2, EDX elemental mappings of Ti, O and Pt were investigated by STEM (Fig. 4c–e and h–j). The red and green areas are consistent with TiO2 in HAADF-STEM images, whereas the yellow areas are consistent with the particles supported on TiO2 surface. In addition, the XPS spectrum showed that the Pt element exists mainly in the form of Pt2+ in PtO/TiO2 and Pt0 in Pt/TiO2. Given this information, we can conclude that the particles on the surface of the two catalysts comprised mainly PtO and Pt.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of samples are presented in Fig. 5a. The bandgap energy (Eg) was calculated from the formulas, Eg = 1240/λ and (Ahν)n = k(hν − Eg), where A is the absorption coefficient, k is a constant, n is 0.5 for semiconductors with an indirect band gap, hν is the energy of absorbed photon, and Eg is the band gap energy.41 As shown in Fig. 5b, the bandgap energies of TiO2, PtO/TiO2, and Pt/TiO2 were calculated as 3.41 eV, 3.25 eV, and 3.16 eV, respectively. The results showed that Pt and PtO both reduced the band gap of TiO2 and enhanced the movement of photogenerated carriers; however, Pt resulted in a greater reduction. The reduced bandgap of PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 may be cause by the formation of Pt–O–Pt bonds between PtO and TiO2 as well as Pt and TiO2. Additionally, Pt particles are more active and interact more strongly with TiO2, leading to a greater reduction in the TiO2 bandgap.42

The PL emission spectra of PtO/TiO2, Pt/TiO2, and TiO2 were recorded to investigate the efficiency of carrier transfer and separation (Fig. 6). For all samples, the emission peaks were present at approximately 550 nm, and were attributable to the band gap transition.43 The luminescence intensity of the three catalysts was different, from strong to weak, respectively: TiO2 > PtO/TiO2 > Pt/TiO2. This indicated that the loading of either Pt or PtO was beneficial to the separation of photoelectron–hole pairs. In addition, the loading of Pt nanoparticles had a greater ability to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs than compared with loading of PtO, thus increasing the concentration of free electrons and providing more electrons for CO2 reduction, which can be helpful for the production of CH4.
 Fig. 6  PL spectra of TiO2, PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2. 
The photocurrent response is reflection of the separation property of photogenerated electron and photogenerated hole. The higher the photocurrent, the higher the separation efficiency of photoelectron-hole pairs. As shown in Fig. 7, the photocurrent response exhibited the same trends as the PL emission spectra: the loading of Pt helped to enhance the photocurrent intensity, but the loading of PtO resulted in a weaker enhancement compared to Pt. These results indicated that the loading of Pt increased the concentration of free electrons and accelerated charge separation. Further, EIS Nyquist plots were generated to characterize charge transfer resistance (Fig. 8). The relative size of the radius of the arc on the Nyquist diagram corresponds to the size of the charge transfer resistance and the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron hole pairs. The smaller the arc radius of the impedance spectrum, the better the separation effect of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Compared with TiO2, Pt/TiO2, with the smallest radius, showed the lowest resistance; hence, PtO/TiO2, with the largest radius, showed the highest resistance, meaning that Pt loading assisted electron transfer but PtO loading suppressed electron transfer. Therefore, we concluded that Pt/TiO2 could not only inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs but also facilitate charge transfer.

Discussion on the selectivity of CO2 reduction
The first step in CO2 reduction is the adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface. Therefore, the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CO2-carrying water vapor adsorbed on Pt/TiO2 and PtO/TiO2 surfaces in the dark for 60 min and under illumination for 60 min were collected (Fig. 10). The peak at 1662 cm−1 was assigned to H2O.44 The peaks at 1595 cm−1 and 1392 cm−1 were attributed to HCO3−, which was formed by CO2 and OH groups on the surface, and the peak at 1489 cm−1 was attributed to CO32−, which was formed by the CO2 and O groups.45,46 For Pt/TiO2, after irradiation with UV light for 1 h, the IR peak for the CO2− species, an important intermediate in CO2 reduction, was observed at 1714 cm−1,44,47 suggesting that CO2 was successfully adsorbed and activated on the Pt/TiO2 surface. Meanwhile, HCO3− and CO32− clearly increased, indicating that Pt/TiO2 could further activate and transform CO2. However, no obvious peaks at 1489 cm−1 and 1392 cm−1 were observed in the spectrum of PtO/TiO2, and the peak of CO2− was hard to observe, suggesting that the activation and conversion of CO2 over PtO/TiO2 did not occur as easily as over Pt/TiO2.
It is known that the selectivity of CO2 reduction is greatly affected by the chemical state of the metal cocatalysts. The Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/TiO2 (Fig. 9a) and PtO/TiO2 (Fig. 9b) before and after CO2 photoreduction experiments were recorded and compared. The results showed that the chemical state of the Pt species did not change after the reaction, which eliminated the possibility that the reversed product selectivity was caused by a change in the chemical state of Pt during the photoreduction of CO2.

To further study the effect of platinum valence states on the hydrogenation of CO2 to methane, H2-TPR experiments were conducted (Fig. 11). A strong peak appeared at 332 °C in the profile of the Pt/TiO2 catalyst; this peak was attributable to the reduction of TiO2 near Pt particles by H2, assisted by Pt,48 indicating that Pt could effectively activate the catalyst surface, allowing the easy adsorption and dissociation of H2 on the surface of Pt/TiO2. In comparison, there was a weak peak in the TPR profile of the PtO/TiO2 catalyst at 314 °C, indicating that it was hard for H2 to adsorb and dissociate on PtO/TiO2. Therefore, in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, as H+ will readily form H2 and then desorb from the PtO/TiO2 surface when reduced,49 the H2 back-reaction is suppressed on PtO/TiO2, thereby not only promoting H2 production but also inhibiting hydrogenation of CO2. In contrast, on the Pt/TiO2 surface, the presence of Pt keeps reduced H atoms on the Pt surface, which favors the participation of hydrogen in the hydrogenation of CO2 to methane.

For the solid–gas reaction, the main product of CO2 reduction is CO, rather than CH4, owing to the high energy barrier and the increased number of carriers and protons needed during CH4 formation. As the key intermediate during the process, the further reduction of CO is crucial to the product selectivity change of Pt and PtO as co-catalysts in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.50,51 To further explore the mechanism, TPD and in situ DRIFTS were used to analyze CO.
CO-TPD was performed to study the adsorption of CO on Pt/TiO2 and PtO/TiO2. The results in Fig. 12 show that Pt/TiO2 had significantly larger CO chemisorption capacity than PtO/TiO2 as determined from the area of CO desorption peaks. Notably, the CO desorption on Pt/TiO2 peaked at approximately 152 °C, but that on PtO/TiO2 began to flatten out at approximately 110 °C, demonstrating that CO adsorption on Pt/TiO2 was stronger than that on PtO/TiO2. This suggested that Pt/TiO2 favored the further reduction of CO to CH4. This may be because the highly dispersed PtO particles, which were smaller, occupied more adsorption sites on the TiO2 surface, whereas Pt particles migrated and aggregated during the photochemical reduction of PtO into Pt, re-exposing the adsorption sites on the catalyst surface.52

CO-FTIR analysis was also performed to provide further understanding of the adsorption sites of CO on Pt/TiO2 and PtO/TiO2. The IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the surface of PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 13. The bands for linearly adsorbed CO were observed at 2091 cm−1 and 2070 cm−1, corresponding to Pt terrace sites and low-coordination sites, respectively, and the band for bridge-type adsorbed CO was observed at 1853 cm−1.53,54 The intensity ratio of IR peaks for linear-type to bridge-type was 1.7:1 for Pt/TiO2 and 1.2:1 for PtO/TiO2, indicating that linearly coordinated CO could form more easily on the surface of Pt than PtO co-catalysts. In addition, it is well known that the low-coordination sites can more easily activate the reactants, acting as a trap for electrons and facilitating the photocatalytic reduction of CO.20 Compared with Pt/TiO2, no significant enhancement was observed for the IR peak of CO adsorbed on the Pt terrace sites of PtO/TiO2 despite the larger quantity and smaller size of PtO particles compared with Pt particles; this may have been due to the overstabilization of the Pt atoms by coordination with the oxygen in PtO/TiO2,52 resulting in the deactivation of this site and the inhibition of further CO reduction.

To explore how the relative activity of metallic Pt and oxidized Pt species affects CO reduction, the CO adsorption energies on the surface platinum atom of Pt8O8/TiO2(101) and Pt12/TiO2(101) were calculated. The Pt12 cluster and Pt8O8 cluster supported by the TiO2(101) surface were selected to simulate these two co-catalysts (Fig. S2, ESI†). The number of Pt atoms in the cluster was determined from the distribution and particle size obtained by TEM (Fig. 4), and the adsorption sites were determined by CO-FTIR (Fig. 13). All the successful adsorption structures of CO on Pt8O8/TiO2(101) and Pt12/TiO2(101) are shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†); the adsorption energy and Mulliken charges are listed in order in Table S1 (ESI†). The most stable sites are listed separately (Fig. 14 and Table 1), and further partial density of states (PDOS) analysis of CO adsorption was conducted for these sites. As shown in Table 1, the CO adsorption energy on Pt/TiO2 was higher than that on PtO/TiO2 at the top site and bridge site, respectively, suggesting that the adsorption of CO on metallic Pt was stronger than that of oxidized Pt species.

The enhancement of CO adsorption ability by Pt and PtO was further examined by analysis of the PDOS of CO adsorbed on the Pt8O8/TiO2(101) and Pt12/TiO2(101) surfaces, as shown in Fig. 15, as well as the Mulliken charges listed in Table 3. As shown in Fig. 15, compared with free CO, in the PDOS of CO adsorption on these two models, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of CO shifted down toward the Fermi energy level, demonstrating electron transfer from PtO and Pt clusters to CO. Even more remarkable was the more intense hybridization near the Fermi energy level in the PDOS of CO on Pt/TiO2, suggesting that the Pt cluster had a greater ability to transfer electrons to CO, corresponding to the more negative Mulliken charges of adsorbed CO, which were −0.19e− and −0.34e− at the top site and bridge site, respectively, whereas those of CO adsorbed on the PtO cluster were −0.08e− and −0.21e−, respectively (Table 3). The results provide a good explanation for the 1.36 eV and 1.38 eV higher CO adsorption energy on the Pt/TiO2 surface at the top and bridge sites, respectively, than on the PtO/TiO2 surface. Furthermore, from the PDOS (Fig. 15b) and Mulliken charges (Table 3), more electrons on the Pt/TiO2 surface at the top site are donated to CO as compared with the bridge site, indicating that there were stronger electronic interactions between CO and the Pt/TiO2 surface at the top site, providing good support of the results of CO-FTIR.

Reaction mechanism of selectivity change between PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2
In the photoreduction of CO2, CO2 with H2O was first adsorbed on the active sites on the PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 surfaces to reach an equilibrium state, with the concurrent gradual formation of CO2−, HCO3−, and CO32−. Then these surface groups were reduced to CO by photogenerated electrons that migrated to the surface of the catalysts. Finally, CO was desorbed from the surface or further hydrogenated to CH4 with the participation of H+ obtained from H2O dissociation. For PtO/TiO2, although PtO particles were more densely distributed on the surface of TiO2, CO was more easily desorbed from the surface owing to its weak adsorption on PtO/TiO2, resulting in a decrease in the number of CO molecules involved in the subsequent reductions. Further, as H+ formed by H2O on the surface of the catalyst could easily form H2 when it gained electrons and then desorbed from the surface, the H2 back-reaction on PtO/TiO2 was suppressed, which not only promoted the formation of H2 but inhibited the hydrogenation of CO2. In contrast, for Pt/TiO2, it is difficult to desorb CO from Pt owing to the strong adsorption ability and electronic interactions, and H+ can remain adsorbed on the Pt surface after being reduced, further hydrogenating CO to CH4 (Fig. 16).

Conclusion
PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts were prepared to investigate the effect of chemical states of Pt on the product selectivity of CO2 photoreduction. Compared with PtO, the Pt nanoparticles were larger, and there were fewer particles. PtO/TiO2 showed good selectivity for CO (100%) whereas Pt/TiO2 favored the production of CH4 (66.6%). This reversed product selectivity was found to result from charge separation and the adsorption/desorption of CO and H on the catalysts, which were mainly dependent on the oxidation state of the Pt nanoparticles on TiO2. Electrochemical and PL analysis showed that Pt loading was conducive to an improvement in the efficiency of photogenerated carrier separation and the concentration of free electrons, which helps the processing of multi-electron reduction reactions, such as CH4 formation. CO-TPD analysis indicated that metallic Pt had more CO adsorption sites and stronger adsorption capacity, and these findings were verified by comparing the CO adsorption energies using DFT calculations. More specifically, in situ CO2/CO-FTIR experiments showed that metallic Pt could promote the conversion of CO2 to CO2− efficiently in the first step of CO2 reduction and helped the formation of a linear CO adsorption structure at the top sites. As a result, the intensity ratio of IR peaks between the linear type to the bridge type was 1.7:1 on Pt/TiO2, but 1.2:1 for PtO/TiO2. Furthermore, Mulliken charges and PDOS analysis indicated intense hybridization of CO electron orbitals on the Pt/TiO2 surface, especially at the top sites rather than the bridge sites, which indicated that the top site was more favorable for the subsequent CO reduction reactions. In addition, H2-TPR experiments proved that the hydrogen atoms were easily adsorbed on the surface of Pt/TiO2, which also favors the reduction of CO to CH4. Consequently, CH4 production was favored with Pt/TiO2 catalysts, whereas CO production was favored with PtO/TiO2 catalysts.
