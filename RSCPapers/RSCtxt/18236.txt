    First published on 15th May 2023AbstractChemical doping of organic semiconductors (OSCs) enables feasible tuning of carrier concentration, charge mobility, and energy levels, which is critical for the applications of OSCs in organic electronic devices. However, in comparison with p-type doping, n-type doping has lagged far behind. The achievement of efficient and air-stable n-type doping in OSCs would help to significantly improve electron transport and device performance, and endow new functionalities, which are, therefore, gaining increasing attention currently. In this review, the issue of doping efficiency and doping air stability in n-type doped OSCs was carefully addressed. We first clarified the main factors that influenced chemical doping efficiency in n-type OSCs and then explain the origin of instability in n-type doped films under ambient conditions. Doping microstructure, charge transfer, and dissociation efficiency were found to determine the overall doping efficiency, which could be precisely tuned by molecular design and post treatments. To further enhance the air stability of n-doped OSCs, design strategies such as tuning the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, charge delocalization, intermolecular stacking, in situ n-doping, and self-encapsulations are discussed. Moreover, the applications of n-type doping in advanced organic electronics, such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and thermoelectrics are being introduced. Finally, an outlook is provided on novel doping ways and material systems that are aimed at stable and efficient n-type doped OSCs.

1. Introduction
The doping of organic semiconductors (OSCs) enables their promising applications in organic electronic devices. For example, the doping of OSCs as transporting layers in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) to achieve balanced electron–hole injection and transport, leads to the successful OLED market.1–6 Moreover, the device performance and device stability of organic photovoltaics (OPVs)7–15 and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs)16–21 are significantly influenced by the chemically doped OSCs inserted between the active layer and electrodes. Filling charge traps in pristine organic semiconductors and reducing contact resistance by doping in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) or organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), significantly improve the charge transport and device stability.22–27 Very recently, high-performance organic thermoelectric (OTE) materials are obtained by doping of OSCs to increase carrier concentrations and electrical conductivities, which reach device performances comparable to inorganic TEs at low/medium temperature regions.28–36
To achieve efficient chemical doping, frontier molecular orbital energy levels, and charge-transfer process in the dopants/OSCs binary system should be carefully considered.37–41 Moreover, good miscibility in this binary system is required to obtain high doping levels (Fig. 1).42–45 For example, in p-type doping (Fig. 2a), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of dopants are required to align lower or close to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of OSCs to enable electron transfer from HOMO (OSCs) to LUMO (p-type dopants). The resulting dopant counter anions are then coulombically bound to the positively charged species (polaron or bipolaron) on OSCs to maintain charge neutrality. After dissociation with counterions, the resulting charged species become free charge carriers and contribute to electrical conductivity. Attributed to rational molecular design strategies and insightful investigations of doping mechanisms, p-type doped OSCs have been highly developed in the past two decades.

1.1. n-Type doping mechanism of OSCs
In comparison with p-type doping, n-type doping has lagged far behind. It is still difficult to achieve both high n-type doping efficiency and air stability, which limits the development of n-type doped OSCs and their applications in organic electronics. For typical n-type doping, the LUMOs of OSCs should principally be deep enough to accept electrons from HOMOs or singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of dopants (Fig. 2b).35,46,47 Achieving deep LUMOs and high electron mobility in OSCs remain a great challenge. Meanwhile, the requirement of high-lying HOMOs or SOMOs in n-type dopants also leads to stability issues.48 Besides, the bad miscibility between n-type dopants and OSCs results in low doping levels.42 To address the challenges in n-type doped OSCs, a series of new dopants and OSCs are developed (as shown in the following sections), and novel doping processes are also investigated recently, which has moved this new research field forward. For example, polar side chain engineering on conjugated backbones,49 and weakening crystallinity in OSCs,50 are proven to be effective in improving miscibility. Tuning rigidity and planarity of molecular backbones,51,52 and branching positions of the alkyl side chains,53,54 or developing dopants with smaller size and lower ionization,55,56 significantly improve the doping microstructure and contribute to high doping efficiency and electrical conductivities. Moreover, n-type self-doped OSCs are developed to address the unsettled issues in external chemical doping, which would unavoidably perturb the initial π-stacking, decrease crystallinity, and induce disordered in organic semiconductors.47,57–60 Notably, electrons on HOMOs of dopants are unable to be transferred to the acceptors when HOMOs of n-type dopants such as DMBI-H derivatives are aligning much lower than the LUMOs of OSCs. However, high doping efficiency is still achieved in these systems. Possible hydride (H−)-transfer mechanisms are proposed and experimentally proved in recent reports (Fig. 2b).61–63 Besides, novel doping methods such as anion–π interaction,64,65in situ n-type doping,66 ground-state charge transfer,41 and heavily p-type doping67 have been applied for n-type doped OSCs, which enriches the n-type doped materials systems. Though ion exchange doping68 has not been used in n-type doping, in principle, this strategy can facilitate charge transfer and enhance doping efficiency. The earlier progress in n-type doped OSCs has been well summarized in recent reviews which mainly focus on charge mobilities,28 backbone, and side-chain engineering on n-type OSCs,69 molecular dopants’ design,70 morphologies control,71 or electronic structures72etc. However, less attention is being paid to the design and development of air-stable and efficient n-type doping in OSCs, which remains a great challenge in n-doped organic conductors and is critical for the applications of organic electronics. For example, it is found that n-type doped OTE devices work efficiently in an inert atmosphere. However, when exposed to air, the electrical conductivities and thermoelectric performances of n-type doped OSCs will decrease dramatically within a short time as summarized in Table 1.

1.2. The origin of air instability in n-doped OSCs
In contrast to air-stable radical cations generated after p-type doping, the resulting radical anions in n-type doped OSCs are volatile when exposed to air (Fig. 2c and d), because of the H2O and O2 electron traps. As a result, most of the n-type doped OSCs are prepared and measured in an inert atmosphere. The investigation of air stability of n-type doped OSCs dated back to 1997. It was proposed that an n-type organic semiconductor exhibiting an electrode potential of about 0 to +0.5 V (SCE), for example, in tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ, LUMO ≈ −4.8 eV), was required for stable n-type doping.73 Moreover, it was found that the anion radical peaks in n-type doped TCNQ solutions were stable even under ambient conditions.74 In contrast, the anion peaks in n-type C60 were unable to be observed due to their high-lying LUMO energy levels (−4.0 eV). However, there was no stable n-type doped conductors reported in the last two decades. Until very recently, quinoidal oligothiophene derivatives (QOTs) with LUMO energy levels at around ∼−4.7 eV doped by N-DMBI exhibited both high electrical conductivity (1.4 × 101 S cm−1) and excellent air stability (σ240h, in air = 82% σ0) in spin-coated thin films.47 Before that, the community was convinced that n-type OSCs with LUMO energy levels around −3.6 eV were air-stable in their n-type doped films when competing with H2O/O2.29,75,76 In 2012, it was reported that trap-free electron transport could only be obtained in semiconducting polymers with LUMO energy levels lower than −3.6 eV, after a series of J–V curves measurements in sandwich-type devices.75 Later (2016), the limits of air stability in n-type doped conductors (Table 1) were further explored.76 A series of n-type organic semiconductors were doped with W2(hpp)4, and their stabilities of electrical conductivity in n-type doped thin films were tested under ambient conditions. The best in-air electrical conductivity of bis-HFI-NTCDI (10−4 S cm−1) with LUMO energy levels of −3.8 eV decreased to 33% of the initial value within 0.5 h. Notably, neither the electrical conductivity nor air stability are high enough for practical applications. Based on the discussion above, it is necessary to reconsider the energy level diagram of air stability for achieving high-performance air-stable n-type doped OSCs. According to the electrochemical redox potential of H2O/O2, its LUMO is calculated to be around −4.1 eV.77 In OFETs, it is well recognized that only n-type organic semiconductors with LUMO energy levels close to or lower than −4.1 eV, can function efficiently under ambient conditions. As shown in typical thin-film OFET (Fig. 3a), the interface with a thickness of several nanometers (nm) between organic semiconductors and the dielectric layer is electrically n-doped and acts as the electron conductive channel. The rest of the neutral n-type organic semiconductor layers with thicknesses much larger than that of the conductive channel, serve as the self-encapsulation layer. Besides, the injection and transport of electrons in OFETs are completed within a few minutes. Though, the required LUMOs of n-type OSCs for achieving air stable OFETs, are still deeper than the values previously proposed for n-type doped OSCs. In n-type doped OSCs with high doping levels (Fig. 3b), the bulk films are n-type doped and conductive, which should require deeper LUMO energy levels (∼−4.7 eV) to stabilize the non-encapsulated and higher concentrated radical anions than that in OFETs (−4.1 eV). Very recently, a series of new design strategies were proposed to improve air stability of n-type doped OSCs, such as engineering of LUMO energy levels,78 extending charge delocalization,79 increasing crystallinity,80,81 self-encapsulation,65,82 and self-doping,58,60 which significantly enhanced the air stability and also the electrical conductivities of n-doped OSCs.

In this review, the key factors that determine the air stability and doping efficiency of n-type doped OSCs are organized and discussed, including: (1) n-type doping mechanism and doping process: doping microstructure, charge transfer, dissociations with dopant counterions; (2) strategies designed for improving air stability: deep LUMO energy levels, charge delocalization, intermolecular stacking, in situ n-doping, self-encapsulations and etc.; (3) novel n-doped materials systems. The thermoelectric performances of the n-doped OSCs were introduced along with the discussion of n-type doping since the key parameters of OTE materials were closely related to doping. Besides, the promising applications of n-type doping in exciting advanced electronics such as PSCs, OPVs, OFETs, OLEDs, and conductive inks were also introduced. We combined the design strategy of efficient and air-stable n-type doping of OSCs in this review to give a clear picture that doping efficiency and doping air stability can be optimized synergistically, which should guide the community to develop high-performance n-type doped OSCs and lead to the potential organic electronic markets.
2. n-Type doping process
The doping process is separated into three steps (Fig. 1). Firstly, dopants and n-type OSCs are mixed by either vapor doping or solution doping, which requires good miscibility in this binary system to facilitate charge transfer. Secondly, the OSCs are reduced by dopants to generate ionized species by direct charge transfer from HOMO or SOMO electron or indirect intermediate reduction species such as hydride or anion–π interactions. The ionized species are bound to the dopant counterions coulombically, which can’t directly contribute to charge carriers. Thirdly, the ionized species dissociate with dopant counterions to become free charge carriers. The dissociation efficiency is controlled by the energy levels, the identity of counterions, and charge delocalization.
2.1. Miscibility
Notably, most of the n-type doped systems are selected from the reported n-type OSCs with high electron mobility, because they are potentially excellent organic conductors after n-type doping, according to the composition and equation of electrical conductivity: σ = nμq, where n is the charge carrier concentration, μ is the charge carrier mobility (unless otherwise noted, all the mobilities are determined by FET measurements), q is the carrier charge. However, high electron mobility not always results in high electrical conductivity, if doping efficiency is low. To enable high doping efficiency, the dopant, and OSCs should have good miscibility, which relates to the effective “dopants-OSCs interface” for further charge transfer. In general, OSCs with compact π–π stacking and high crystallinity, may impede the diffusion of dopants and lead to the separated aggregation of dopants and OSCs (Fig. 4). For example, poly{[N,N′-bis(2octyl-dodecyl)-1,4,5,8-napthalenedicarboximide-2,6-diyl]-alt5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (PNDIT2) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) showed high electron mobilities and strong crystallinity (Fig. 5).42,49 After doping with the n-type dopant, N-DMBI (Fig. 6), the electrical conductivities were determined to be 10−3–10−2 S cm−1, which were due to the poor miscibility and low doping levels. To address the miscibility issue, a series of design strategies, such as polar side chain engineering, amorphous morphology control, and increasing branching position at alkyl chains were proposed.
 Fig. 4  Miscibility between n-type dopants and OSCs during doping process. Strong aggregation in OSCs will prevent dopants from diffusing inside the OSCs films, which lead to separate aggregation and low doping efficiency. In the contrary, OSCs with amorphous morphology may have better miscibility with dopants and contribute to higher doping efficiency.

2.1.1. Polar side chain engineering. 
The polar side chains attached to conjugated backbones were shown to improve miscibility and enhance doped thermal stability in p-type doped OSCs. Recently, the introduction of ethylene glycol (EG) polar side chains on n-type OSCs was also proved to be very effective in improving doping efficiency. With EG side chain substitutions on the naphthalene-diimide (NDI) unit, the orientations were switched from face-on (PNDIT2) to edge-on (TEG-N2200), and the LUMO energy levels were slightly upshifted due to the electron-rich oxygen atoms (Fig. 5).43 Interestingly, the crystallinity of PNDIT2 was disturbed after doping and obvious aggregations were found for dopants, while less influence was found in TEG-N2200 because the dopants were dispersed in polar side chains. As a result, the miscibility between dopants and TEG-N2200 was significantly improved. Besides, the dopant counter ions would be strongly binding to polar side chains, which might overcome the coulombic interaction between radical anions on OSCs and dopant counter cations, and thus facilitate the dissociation of radical anions and contribute to free charge carries. In comparison with n-doped PNDIT2, both carrier concentration and doping efficiency were enhanced in N-DMBI doped TEG-N2200, which resulted in higher electrical conductivity in TEG-N2200 (1.7 × 10−1 S cm−1) than that of PNDIT2 (8.6 × 10−4 S cm−1). More significant enhancement of electrical conductivity was reported in fullerene derivatives after substitution with EG side chains. σ was increased from 1.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 in PCBM to 8.8 S cm−1 in PTEG-2 with doubly EG side chains (Fig. 5).83 This high electrical conductivity achieved in solution-process doped PTEG-2 thin films enabled the application in n-type OTE. OTE performances are measured by the figure of merit, ZT = σS2T/κ, or power factor, PF = σS2, where σ is the electrical conductivity, S is the Seebeck coefficients, κ is the thermal conductivity, and T is the absolute temperature. Together with the high Seebeck coefficient of −220 μV K−1 and the low thermal conductivity of 0.086 W−1 m−1 K−1 determined in PTEG-2, a power factor of 46 μW m−1 K−2 and a ZT value as high as 0.15 were obtained at room temperature, which demonstrated that n-doped fullerene derivatives were promising OTE materials by the introduction of polar side chains. Notably, the increased hydrophilic properties would also lead to chemical stability issues in these n-doped OSCs, which should be carefully considered when designing n-type OSCs with polar side chains.


2.1.2. Amorphous microstructures for better miscibility. 
In addition to polar side chain engineering, decreasing the crystallinity in OSCs by molecule design would also improve the miscibility between dopants and OSCs. For example, in BDPPV derivatives (Fig. 7), TBDPPV and TBDOPV-T exhibited amorphous microstructures with low crystallinity.50 TBDOPV-2T (Fig. 7d) with bithiophene as a conjugation linker exhibited rigid planar backbones and ordered microstructures with edge-on orientations (Fig. 7a–c). However, after doping with N-DMBI, the previously highly-ordered microstructure in TBDOPV-2T was disturbed and led to low crystallinity, in which, low doping efficiency and carrier concentrations were obtained. In comparison, TBDPPV and TBDOPV-T with amorphous microstructures improved the miscibility with dopants and provided free space for dopant ions, thus increasing doping efficiency and doped electrical conductivities. As summarized in Table 1, σ of 2.3 S cm−1 and PF of 8.0 μW m−1 K−2 were achieved in N-DMBI doped TBDOPV-2T. In contrast, an impressive σ of 9.2 × 101 S cm−1 and PF of 7.6 × 101 μW m−1 K−2 were achieved in N-DMBI doped TBDPPV. TBDOPV-T with a slightly higher LUMO energy level showed relatively lower doping levels but higher charge mobility in doped films, which contributed to the relatively lower σ (6.5 × 101 S cm−1), but higher S (1.3 × 102 μV K−1) and PF (1.1 × 102 μW m−1 K−2). However, due to the high-lying LUMO energy levels (>−4.0 eV) in TBDOPV-T and TBDPPV, only 1% of the initial electrical conductivity (σ0) can be retained after exposure to air for 2 h (Table 1).

2.1.3. Branching position at alkyl side chain. 
The previous strategy will partially sacrifice the crystallinity and electron mobility to improve miscibility. However, to achieve excellent n-doped electrical conductivity, both high electron mobility for charge transport and good miscibility for high doping efficiency and carrier concentrations are required. To optimize the electron mobility and miscibility synergistically, the branching position at the alkyl chain attached to the conjugated polymeric backbone was carefully tuned. As shown in naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-b′]dithiophenediimide (NDTI) based n-type copolymers (Fig. 8), increasing the branching positions at alkyl side chains on NDTI units had a neglectable influence on energy levels, but would significantly increase the electron mobility because of the improved crystallinity.53,54 Notably, good miscibility and high doping efficiency were achieved in PNDTI-BBT-DP and pNB-TzDP with second branching positions at alkyl chains, which provided larger free spaces in the sidechain layer for good accommodation of dopants or dopant cations after charge transfer. The higher electron mobility and doping efficiency achieved in PNDTI-BBT-DP and pNB-TzDP contributed to over ten times higher electrical conductivity than that in PNDTI-BBT-DT and pNB-Tz (Table 1).

2.2. Charge transfer

2.2.1. Decreasing LUMO energy levels to enhance the doping efficiency. 
When the prerequisite, good miscibility is achieved in dopant and OSCs mixtures, the doping efficiency is then determined by the charge transfer between dopants and OSCs. Generally, n-type dopants with high-lying HOMO or SOMO energy levels and OSCs with low-lying LUMO energy levels are ideal for n-type doping, in which electrons can be smoothly transferred from dopants to OSCs. Therefore, considerable attention has been paid to developing n-type OSCs with deep LUMOs and dopants with strong electron-donating abilities.
As shown in Fig. 9, after thionation of the NDI unit,92 the LUMO energy level of analogous co-polymer 2S-trans-PNDIT2 (−3.96 eV), was effectively lowered in comparison with PNDIT2 (−3.75 eV).78 The decreased LUMO energy levels in 2S-trans-PNDIT2 enabled higher doping efficiency and carrier concentrations as confirmed by ESR measurements. The electrical conductivity of the N-DPBI-doped 2S-trans-PNDIT2 thin film (5.9 × 10−3 S cm−1) was about five times higher than that of PNDIT2 (1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1) (Table 1). 2S-trans-PNDIT2 maintained 50% of σ0 over 16 h of continuous air exposure. In contrast, n-type doped PNDIT2 with high-lying LUMO energy level was highly unstable in air, with only 0.1% of σ0 kept after exposure to air for 3.5 h (Table 1). It demonstrated that deeper LUMO energy levels enhanced air stability. Notably, both the electrical conductivity and air stability achieved in 2S-trans-PNDIT2 were still very poor. Further lowering LUMO energy levels and enhancing the doping efficiency is in need. By replacing bithiophene linkers (PNDIT2) with more electron-deficient bithiazole (PNDI2OD-Tz2) in NDI-based copolymers, the LUMO energy level was further decreased to −4.10 eV (Fig. 9).52 The electrical conductivity of PNDI2OD-Tz2 was enhanced to 1.0 × 10−1 S cm−1, over 30 times higher than that of PNDIT2, after vapor-doping by TDAE, which was attributed to its higher doping efficiency and enhanced rigid planarity. Very recently, a charge-compensated n-doped π-conjugated polymer was developed. The alkyl side chains on NDI units of PNDIT2 were replaced with positively charged side chains, which enabled lower LUMO energy level: −4.5 eV and higher doping efficiency in charge-compensated P(NDIC3AI-T2F). The positively charged side groups helped to stabilize the radial anions on conjugated backbones after n-type doping and contribute to the high stability of n-doped states in water and under ambient conditions.93

Low-lying LUMO energy levels, rigid planarity, and high electron mobilities achieved in BDPPV derivatives enabled high doping efficiency and high-performance n-type doped OTE materials.50,55,56,79,86,87 The tight π–π stacking between conjugated backbones and long alkyl chains made the n-type dopants disperse in amorphous side chains and retained the initial intermolecular packing, which improved miscibility and enhanced the charge mobility in doped films. Halogen atom substitutions in BDPPV proved to be a facile way to tune the LUMO energy levels and charge mobilities.86 In comparison with BDPPV (−4.01 eV), chloride (Cl) and fluorine (F) substituted derivatives, FBDPPV and ClBDPPV showed deeper LUMO energy levels of −4.17 eV and −4.30 eV, respectively (Fig. 9). Among them, FBDPPV showed the highest σ (1.4 × 101 S cm−1) and PF (2.8 × 101 μW m−1 K−2) after doping by N-DMBI (Table 1), which was attributed to its deep LUMO energy level, high doping level, and high electron mobility.


2.2.2. n-Type dopants with strong electron-donating ability. 
To enable efficient charge transfer, a series of n-type organic dopants with strong electron-donating ability was developed, as summarized in Fig. 6. DMBI-based small-molecule monomers, such as N-DMBI, N-DPBI, and o-MeO-DMBI were the most common n-type dopants.61,74 In addition, similar monomer dopants, DPDHP94 and TAM56 were also developed. Among them, TAM with small size, low ionization, and strong binding with side chains, contributed to higher carrier concentration than that of N-DMBI in BDPPV derivatives.55 To further increase the electron-donating ability, dimer dopants were designed and synthesized.37,95 For example, monomer dopant, 2-Cyc-DMBI-H, dimer dopant, (2-Cyc-DMBI)2, and methyl-substituted dimer dopant, (2-Cyc-DMBI-Me)2 were used to dope n-type small-molecule 2DQTT-o-OD.46 (2-Cyc-DMBI-Me)2 doped 2DQTT-o-OD showed the highest electrical conductivity and thermoelectric performance, which was due to its highest HOMO energy levels and high doping efficiency. Dimer dopants can also effectively n-dope small molecules during co-deposition under a high vacuum.95 For example, (2-Cyc-DMBI)2 doped C60 thin films showed good miscibility and an average electrical conductivity of 12 S cm−1, which was the highest room-temperature value for n-doped C60 thin films. In comparison, ruthenocenyl and ferrocenyl substituted (DMBI)2: (2-Rc-DMBI)2 and (2-Fc-DMBI)2 doped thin films showed intensive aggregations and low doping efficiency, which resulted in low electrical conductivities of 1.0 × 10−1 and 8.0 × 10−2 S cm−1, respectively. The morphological trends in the doped C60 with these three dimer dopants were similar to the solution-processed n-doped films.
In addition to DMBI-based dimer dopants, organometallic dimer dopants such as (RhCp*Cp)2 were developed that showed good miscibility with OSCs and achieved high doping efficiency.96,97 The dimer dopants can contribute to twice higher the carrier concentrations than that of monomer dopants because one dimer dopant will undergo cleavage and generate two reducing monomer species for charge transfer. In addition to traditional n-type dopants, carbene-based n-type dopant precursors such as DMImC were developed recently.87 DMImC was stable under ambient conditions and not reductive when mixing with n-type OSCs at room temperature. After heating for decarboxylation, the carbene was generated, which would undergo direct charger transfer or act as a nucleophilic reagent and adhere to OSCs for n-type doping.


2.2.3. Hydride generation and n-type doping efficiency. 
Most of the reported n-type OSCs showed moderate LUMOs (≥−4.0 eV), which might prevent the direct charge transfer from monomer dopants such as N-DMBI with moderate HOMO energy levels. Though unmatched energy levels were found in these doped systems, high doping efficiency and impressive electrical conductivities were obtained, which could not be explained by the traditional doping mechanism. Both SOMO electrons35 or hydride charge transfer56,62 doping mechanisms were proposed. Recently, hydride (H−) transfer intermediate products were detected and thus supported this mechanism.62 In monomer dopants with active hydrogen, the very reductive H− could be generated to effectively dope n-type OSCs after thermal-annealing or at room temperature. However, it was still unclear how the H− left the OSC, since not all OSCs carried H− after doping. Very recently, the classic transition metal-catalyzation of the C–H activation mechanism in organic synthesis was used to explain the generation of H− and the resulting n-type doped products.63 As shown in Fig. 10, one DMBI-H generated one H− and one DMBI cation (DMBI+) under the activation of transition metals, such as gold (Au) at the first step. H− then reduced one acceptor (A) and resulted in one radical anion (A˙−) and one hydrogen radical (H˙) attached to Au. In the second step, another DMBI-H generated another H−, which was also attached to Au (AuH2˙−). After reducing another acceptor, another radical anion (A˙−) and hydrogen gas (H2) were generated and released Au for the next cycle. Therefore, the doping process of N-DMBI-doped OSCs could be simply summarized with the reaction equation in Fig. 10, which also explained the leaving question of H−. Moreover, the transition metal catalyzation process significantly enhanced the doping efficiency even in n-type OSCs with high-lying LUMO energy levels. When mixing N-DMBI and f-BTI2TEG-FT (Fig. 5) under the assistance of transition metal nanoparticles, an impressive electrical conductivity over 102 S cm−1 and a power factor of 7.1 × 101 μW m−1 K−2 were obtained, which was due to the good miscibility and high doping efficiency.

2.2.4. Anion–π interactions as reducing species. 
Anion–π interactions were found to be able to n-dope carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and OSCs. For example, 18-crown-6-ether and K+OH−(or BH4−, Cl−) complex (Fig. 6) would n-type dope CNTs and switch the Seebeck coefficients from positive (p-type) to negative (n-type).98 A thermoelectric PF of 2.3 × 102 μW m−1 K−2 was obtained due to the high σ 2.05 × 103 S cm−1 and moderate S of −3.3 × 101 μV K−1 in the n-doped CNTs. However, due to the high κ of around 4.0 × 101 W m−1 K−1, only ZT of 2.0 × 10−3 was achieved. Thermoelectric analyses revealed that these n-type single-walled CNTs displayed excellent air stability and preserved the n-type TE performances even heating at 100 °C for over 30 days, which was much superior to that of n-type doped OSCs and might be attributed to the extended charge delocalization of the radical anions in CNTs. Recently, tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF)65 and polystyrene-polyvinyl pyridinium ionic copolymer salt (PSpF)64 were used to dope the BDPPV derivatives, ClBDPPV and PFClTVT, respectively (Fig. 6). TBAF-doped ClBDPPV showed a σ of 6.2 × 10−1 S cm−1 and PF of 6.3 × 10−1 μW m−1 K−2. In comparison, PSpF-doped PFClTVT exhibited σ of 4.2 S cm−1, PF of 6.7 × 101 μW m−1 K−2, and a ZT of 0.1, which demonstrated that copolymer PSpF was an effective n-dopant. Notably, the doping mechanism of anion–π interactions as n-type dopants is still unclear. A possible route is that anions reacted with the π-units, and then the resulting acceptor anion reduced another acceptor, which generated one acceptor radical and one acceptor radical anion as charge carriers.

2.3. Dissociation of charge carriers with counterions
Doping in OSCs may undergo charge transfer (CT) complex or integer charge transfer (ICT) depending on the energy levels alignment, the identity of counterions, and charge delocalization. In the CT complex, counterions have strong coulombically binding interactions with charge species on OSCs, which limit the number of free charge carriers and lead to low doping efficiency. In the case of ICT, counterions form weak interactions with charged OSCs, and thus a higher doping efficiency is achieved. When small energy level differences between LUMOs of OSCs and HOMOs or SOMOs of dopants, or aromatic and small-size counterions are generated after the charge transfer, the counterion will tend to interact strongly with induced radical anions on n-type doped OSCs and form CT complex. Besides, the energy difference between the LUMOs of the undoped OSCs and the ionization potential of its doped counterpart will also play an important role in doping efficiency and charge transport.37 To address this issue, frontier energy levels, polar side chains, or bulky dopant counterions are applied to dissociate with counterions and generate ICT to enhance doping efficiency.48 As discussed in the previous sections, the energy levels of OSCs and dopants could be feasibly tuned by molecular design, which could increase the energy difference and form ICT after n-type doping thermodynamically. The switch from alkyl chains to polar side chains such as EG would dissociate with counterions dynamically because the dopant counterions strongly interacted with polar side chains rather than charge species on conjugated backbones.72 Moreover, a recent study showed that the bulky counterions would weaken the coulombic interactions and contribute to higher doping efficiency and electrical conductivity.99 Notably, there were also some results supporting the different idea that the size of counterion was not critical in the case of electrical conductivity, but the morphology or para-crystallinity really mattered.100

2.3.1. Ion-exchange doping. 
The systematic investigation of the effects of dopant counterions on doping efficiency and electrical conductivity was enabled by ion-exchange doping of OSC.68,101–104 For example, p-type OSC, PBTTT formed a CT complex with F4TCNQ after sequential solution doping, which led to low doping efficiency and carrier concentrations. When mixing high concentrations of the ionic salt Li+TFSI− with F4TCNQ dopant solution, the fully ionized TFSI− would swap out the dopant counterion F4TCNQ− that was previously coulombically bound to the charged PBTTT, which resulted in Li+F4TCNQ−, and TFSI− that were held by weak interaction with the free charge carriers on PBTTT.68 Significant enhancement of doping levels was observed in UPS spectra after ion-exchange doping, which explained the increased electrical conductivity. The new strategy could also be applied to ion-exchange doping of n-type OSCs to further enhance the doping efficiency as shown in Fig. 11. The overcome of the coulombic interaction between dopant counterions and OSCs, and the formation of ICT are critical for improving doping efficiency.
 Fig. 11  Ion-exchange doping of n-type OSCs to facilitate the dissociation of radical anions with counterions in CT complex to increase the amount of free charge carriers. 


2.3.2. Charge delocalization in n-type doped ladder-conjugated polymers. 
Except for weakening of the coulombic interaction, enhancing the charge delocalization will also facilitate the dissociation with counterions and increase electrical conductivity. Taking CNTs or graphene as examples, the extended π-conjugations allowed the charge carriers to delocalize over the whole molecule backbones, which contributed to the excellent charge mobility and electrical conductivity after doping. Besides, the delocalization of radical anion charge carriers on n-doped CNTs could significantly lower the electron density and thus help to stabilize radical anions against H2O/O2 under ambient conditions, which was consistent with the high air stability. Therefore, developing n-type OSCs with extended conjugated backbones, such as ladder polymers or small molecules, could enhance charge carriers’ delocalization in comparison with the traditional OSCs and contribute to higher doping efficiency and air stability.
For example, ladder polymer, BBL (Fig. 12), and traditional conjugated polymer, PNDIT2 were vapor doped by a small-molecule dopant, TDAE.51 PNDIT2 showed σ of 5.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 and PF of 1.3 × 10−2 μW m−1 K−2, while in comparison, σ of 1.7 S cm−1 and PF of 4.3 × 10−1 μW m−1 K−2 was obtained in doped BBL thin films. Based on the DFT calculations, the induced radical anions can be delocalized over three repeating units on BBL. In contrast, the radical anion could only be delocalized within one unit on PNDIT2. The linear and torsion-free ladder backbones on BBL enabled more extended delocalization of charge carriers, which contributed to higher performance. Recently, a series of ladder lactam conjugated polymers were synthesized and doped by N-DMBI.88,105 Interestingly, all the three ladder polymers AA, A–N, N–N (Fig. 12), outperformed PNDIT2 as summarized in Table 1. Reducing acene core size from A–A to N–N, effectively lowered LUMO energy levels, thus facilitating charge transfer and leading to higher doping efficiency and electrical conductivity as addressed in previous sections. By fusing the BDPPV units, two ladder-conjugated polymers, LPPV-1, and LPPV-2 were synthesized.79 The π-extended electron-deficient rigid structures endowed deep LUMO energy levels of −4.49 eV. After doping by N-DMBI, σ up to 1.1 S cm−1 and a PF of 2.0 μW m−1 K−2 were obtained in LPPV-1, which was consistent with its large charge delocalization, deep LUMO energy levels, and optimal microstructures.
 Fig. 12  Ladder-polymers enhance charge delocalization, which lead to enhanced electrical conductivity and air stability in n-type doped OSCs. 


2.3.3. Charge delocalization enabled by radical interactions in diradical molecules. 
Ladder OSCs provide an intrachain way for charge delocalization that facilitate ion pair dissociations. In comparison, π-extended diradical molecules enabled both intrachain and interchain charge delocalization ways by radical interactions, which not only significantly enhanced the free charge carrier concentrations, but also improved charge transport and thus contribute to high electrical conductivity. Besides, the tight intermolecular packing and long-range charge delocalization also result in excellent air stability of the n-type doped OSCs.
Recently, a series of quinoidal-resonant quinoidal oligothiophene derivatives (QOTs) were designed and synthesized by introducing quinoid-enhancing thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TbT)106–108 and electron-deficient thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)109 moieties, as shown in Fig. 13.46,47,57 The HOMO-LUMO energy bandgaps became narrow and the LUMO energy levels decreased with the enlargement of π-conjugation by increasing the number of TPD units (from n = 0 (2DQBT) to n = 3 (2DQPT)).47,110 Notably, the diradical characters also increased with the narrowed bandgaps. As a result, quinoidal and aromatic resonant states co-existed in these QOTs, as depicted in Fig. 13. The amorphous characters in diradicals, 2DQQT and 2DQPT improved the miscibility with dopants. Interestingly, the crystallinity was enhanced after the introduction of dopants, which might be due to the radical interactions that induced tight and ordered molecular packing. After doping by N-DMBI, the highest electrical conductivities achieved in 2DQBT, 2DQTT, 2DQQT, and 2DQPT, were 1.4 × 10−4, 2.1 × 10−1, 1.4 × 101, and 2.85 S cm−1, respectively (Table 1). Among them, 2DQQT showed the highest σ and PF (4.2 × 101 μW m−1 K−2), which was attributed to the good miscibility, high doping levels, and small diradical character that provided efficient intramolecular and intermolecular charge delocalization and transporting ways. After exposure to air for 240 h, the attenuation ratio of electrical conductivity for n-type doped 2DQBT, 2DQTT, and 2DQQT thin films were 5%, 52%, and 82%, respectively (Fig. 13), which were consistent with the decreased LUMO energy levels. However, the excessive diradical character in 2DQPT led to σ-polymer and the breaking of the quinoidal backbone after doping, which up-shifted the LUMO energy level, and thereby resulted in relatively low electrical conductivity and air stability (σt=240h,air/σ0 = 37%). The high OTE performance and excellent stability achieved in 2DQQT demonstrated that deep LUMO energy levels (∼−4.70 eV) and incipient diradical character that facilitated charge delocalization and enhanced molecule packing, were prerequisites for air-stable n-type doped OSCs.

3. Design strategy toward air stable n-type doped organic semiconductors
In the previous section, it was shown that lowering LUMO energy levels and enhancing charge delocalization, contributed to both high n-doped electrical conductivity and air stability. In this section, we focused on the other design strategies: high crystallinity, self-encapsulation, self-doping, in situ doping, and coordination polymers that were applied to further enhance the air stability of n-type doped OSCs.
3.1. Tight π–π stacking in n-type doped OSC thin film improves air stability
Increasing the crystallinity of OSCs and forming compact intermolecular stacking between conjugated backbones would keep off H2O/O2 and improve the air stability of n-type doped OSCs. Recently, cyano (CN)-substituted thiophene building block was used to copolymerize with DPP and synthesize the new copolymer, P(TDPP-CT2), which showed a LUMO of −3.70 eV, and high electron mobility of 3.1 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 14a).80 By replacing the thiophene donor with electron-deficient pyrazine, deeper LUMO (−4.03 eV) and higher electron mobility (7.9 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1) were achieved in P(PzDPP-CT2) due to more rigid planarity, and a shorter π–π stacking distance of 3.38 Å. After doping by N-DMBI, σ of as high as 8.4 S cm−1 and excellent PF of 5.73 × 101 μW m−1 K−2 were obtained in P(PzDPP-CT2) thin films. As shown in Fig. 14b, after exposure to air, the σ decreased dramatically within 3 h and retained 45% of the initial value within 24 h. Notably, the air stability was much improved in comparison with the other n-type-doped OSCs, as discussed above, though similar LUMO energy levels were achieved (Table 1). This could be attributed to its tighter π–π stacking (dπ–π = 3.38 Å) than that of PNDIT2 (dπ–π = ∼3.9 Å), BTI derivatives (dπ–π > 3.6 Å), and BDPPV derivatives (dπ–π > 3.4 Å).

3.2. Self-encapsulation and the function of LUMO in n-type doped thick films
The discussion above demonstrated that the LUMO energy level, charge delocalization, and intermolecular stacking were critical to the air stability of n-type doped organic conductors. Besides, self-encapsulation in thick films could help to protect the inner conductive channel by sacrificing a part of the outer layer that exposure to air, in which a dramatic drop of electrical conductivity was observed at the early stage, and then the value became almost constant with a longer exposure time, regardless of competitive ability of the n-type semiconductors against H2O/O2 (Fig. 15d and e). For example, TBAF was used as an n-type dopant (Fig. 6) to dope the polymer ClBDPPV (LUMO = −4.3 eV, Fig. 15a and d) by anion–π electronic interaction.65 When exposed to air, the electrical conductivity of the n-type doped ClBDPPV (6.2 × 10−1 S cm−1) thick films with a thickness of around 8 μm, decreased to 50% of the initial value within 24 h. After three days in the air, the electrical conductivity decreased to around 1.0 × 10−1 S cm−1 (σt/σ0 ≈ 25%) and was nearly kept constant with longer exposure time (Fig. 15d). Very recently, the same group synthesized a highly crystalline polymer, PClClTVT with LUMO energy levels of −4.03 eV (Fig. 15b), and investigated the air stability of doped films with N-DMBI as the dopant in a self-encapsulation way.81 After exposure to air, the electrical conductivity (1.6 × 101 S cm−1) decreased dramatically within the first few days (Fig. 15e), and was then kept at 31% of the initial value for 222 days. Though a high-lying LUMO energy level in PClClTVT, good air stability was still achieved in PClClTVT, which could be attributed to its high crystallinity in self-encapsulated thick films that blocked O2 and H2O. A similar strategy was used to investigate the air stability of the ladder polymer LPPV-1 (LUMO = −4.49 eV) doped by N-DMBI (Fig. 15c).79 As shown in Fig. 15e, the electrical conductivity decreased quickly in the first few days and then was kept 61% of the initial value for 76 days in air. Of the three kinds of n-type-doped polymer thick films, LPPV-1 was the most stable one due to its low-lying LUMO energy levels. Notably, the spin-coated n-type doped LPPV-1 thin films with a thickness of 20 nm, just kept less than 50% of the initial electrical conductivity within 1 h (Fig. 15f), which demonstrated that the doped system itself was still unstable in air. Therefore, the investigation of air stability of the n-type doped OSC materials should start by exploring the limits of air stability in n-doped conducting thin films firstly, by tuning the LUMO energy level, charge delocalization, and intermolecular stacking. After that, (self)encapsulation as a mature technique can be used to further improve air stability.

3.3. Self-doping for air-stable n-type doped OSCs
In comparison with external n-type doping, self-doped n-type OSCs might be more superior because n-type dopants were not prerequisites and the issue of doping miscibility and doping microstructures could be avoided. Self-doped n-type OSCs could be air-stable and highly conductive materials by precise molecular design. As shown in Fig. 16, the self-doped n-type fullerene derivative, fulleropyrrolidinium iodide (FPI) was synthesized by attaching ammonium iodide to fullerene.89 The anion–π interaction in a single-component FPI thin film enabled an electrical conductivity of 2.0 × 10−2 S cm−1. A similar strategy was also applied in perylene diimides (PDI), in which self-doped PDI-3 exhibited a high σ of 5.0 × 10−1 S cm−1 and PF of 1.4 μW m−1 K−2.90,111 Notably, the doping process in these self-doped materials were similar to the externally chemically-doped n-type OSCs. Though no air stability was reported, the value should be low due to the high-lying LUMO energy levels in FPI (−3.9 eV) and PDI-3 (−4.0 eV). Recently, another kind of self-doped OSC materials, single-component diradical conductors, 2DQQT-S and 2DQQT-Se were designed and synthesized as shown in Fig. 16.58 As discussed in the QOTs sections, the co-existence of electron-deficient quinoidal and electron-rich aromatic resonant structures might provide self-doping to generate free charge carriers. As shown in Table 1, σ of 8.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 and PF of 3.4 × 10−1 μW m−1 K−2 were achieved in pristine 2DQQT-S thin films. In comparison with 2DQQT-S, higher σ of 2.9 × 10−1 S cm−1 and PF of 1.4 μW m−1 K−2 were achieved in 2DQQT-Se, which was attributed to its larger diradical character and higher self-doping levels. After exposure to air for 260 h, no obvious attenuations were found in 2DQQT-S and 2DQQT-Se thin films (Fig. 16). The high air stability should be attributed to the deep LUMO energy levels (<−4.70 eV) and self-doped ways in these two diradical OTE materials. Later, a quinoidal BTI derivative, QTICN was synthesized as a diradical conductor, in which, σ of 3.4 × 10−1 S cm−1, PF of 1.5 μW m−1 K−2, and σ260h/σ0 > 30% were obtained.60 The relatively low air stability in QTICN was due to the higher-lying LUMO energy levels in comparison with 2DQQT-Se.

          In situ n-type doped conducting polymers with ultra-high electrical conductivity and air stability
The solution-processable in situ n-type doped conducting polymer, PBFDO, was developed very recently.66,112 As shown in Fig. 17, the polymerizations started from duroquinone (TMQ) that promoted dimerization by the generation of radicals, and then followed by oxidation dehydrogenation.66 During oxidative polymerizations, the formed polymer, PBFDO was doped with the generated electron-rich tetramethylhydroquinone (TMQH) simultaneously. Interestingly, the doped PBFDO showed good solubility in polar solvents, such as DMSO and DMF, due to the strong interaction between charged polymer backbones and solvents. In comparison with the other reported n-type OSCs, more planar polymeric conjugated backbones and tighter interchain stacking were achieved, because of the absence of side chains, which would benefit the delocalization and transport of charge carriers. Strong polaron peaks and decreasing LUMO energy levels were found in PBFDO oligomers prepared in DMF, in comparison with the neutral states in THF or acetone, suggesting that monomer would undergo the keto–enol tautomerism promoted by polar aprotic solvents and thus facilitate polymerization and in situ n-type doping. The addition of TMQ would further increase the doping efficiency, which contributed to the highest electrical conductivity: 2.0 × 103 S cm−1 among n-type doped OSCs. Notably, due to the ultra-deep LUMO energy level of −5.18 eV and self-encapsulated thick films, the electrical conductivity was kept over 93% even after exposure to air for 35 days. The high σ and moderate S of 2.1 × 101 μV K−1 led to a PF of 9.0 × 101 μW m−1 K−2, which made PBFDO a promising candidate for OTE applications.

3.5. Highly conductive and air-stable n-type coordination polymers
Coordination polymers are composed of metals and π-conjugation moieties, as shown in Fig. 18.36,113–117 The unique π-d electrons overlap and the large bandwidth in these coordination polymers enables intrinsically high electrical conductivity. Without external chemical doping, these coordination polymers showed excellent air stability. Recently, novel n-type coordination polymers were developed and applied in thermoelectric conversions, conducting wires, and superconductors. For example, poly(Kx[Ni-ett]) showed a room-temperature electrical conductivity of 40 S cm−1 and a power factor of 66 μW m−1 K−2, which was one of the best thermoelectric performances among the n-type organic thermoelectric materials.116 The replacement of Ni with Cu could feasibly switch the dominant charge carriers from electron to hole, and thus a thermoelectric module consisting of both p-type and n-type thermocouples was fabricated. Later, the same research group extended the π-conjugation and synthesized CuBHT. The 2D charge transporting way and enhanced crystalline were found in CuBHT, which led to an electrical conductivity of 1580 S cm−1.114,115 The 2D coordination polymer, CuBHT also displayed excellent balanced charge transport, in which electron mobility and hole mobility of 116 cm V−1 s−1 and 99 cm V−1 s−1 were obtained. In general, highly ordered structures and high crystallinity were required for achieving high-performance organic conductors. However, very recently, an amorphous n-type coordination polymer, NiTTFtt with heavily disordered structure was shown to be highly conductive (σ = 1200 S cm−1) and displayed intrinsic glassy-metallic transport behavior.36,118 Based on the theoretical simulations, these unusual properties might be attributed to strong molecular orbitals' overlap regardless of the structural perturbations. Notably, NiTTFtt was robust even under extreme conditions such as humid air, strong acids or bases, and high temperature up to 140 °C, which should make this coordination polymer promising in new applications.

4. n-Type doping in organic optoelectronics
In the last two decades, various OSCs with excellent optoelectronic properties including electroluminescence, photovoltaics, and field-effect were developed for organic electronic devices. However, it is still challenging to integrate multiple properties into a single OSC by molecular design. Therefore, it is necessary to separate different functions into different layers in electronic devices. Chemical doping of OSCs can feasibly tune the energy levels, carrier concentrations, charge injection, and charge transport, which become more and more important in designing and fabricating electronic devices. In comparison with mature p-type doped organic electronic devices, n-type doping is less explored. As a result, in the following sections, the applications of n-type doping in a series of advanced electronic devices were highlighted.
4.1. n-Type doped electron transporting layers for perovskite solar cells
PSC is one of the most promising renewable energy generators for practical applications (Fig. 19). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single junction PSCs has been over 20% in the past ten years.17,19,119 Currently, the most critical challenge in PSCs is the long-term stability.18 Design strategies including: modification of the perovskite active layer, the introduction of hole-transporting layer (HTL), and electron-transporting layer (ETL) are applied.17,19,119 The insertion of the p-doped small-molecule, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as HTL was proved to be the most effective way to passivate defects, improve hole extraction and transport, and enhance the device stability.20 Various doping methods were developed to feasibly tune the electronic property of the HTLs. In comparison, less attention was paid to the developments of organic ETLs, which is due to the difficulty in achieving efficient and air-stable n-type doping. The optimization of ETLs might further enhance the device's performance and stability. For example, a series of DMBI derivatives with methoxy (–MeO) groups substitution at o- and p-positions were used to dope PCBM for the application of inverted PSCs (Fig. 6).120 The SOMO energy levels of these n-type dopants were increased when increasing the numbers of electron-donating MeO groups. Both the morphology and charge mobilities [determined by space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements] were improved when mixed the dopants with PCBM, which contributed to higher fill-factor (FF) and short-current density (JSC) and minimized open-circuit voltage (VOC) loss. Among them, the n-type dopant with the highest SOMO energy level (H3) showed the highest doping efficiency and a high PCE of 18.1% was obtained in the corresponding PSC devices. Moreover, the n-doped unsealed PSCs kept over 85% of the initial PCEs after exposure to air for 30 days in darkness. n-Type self-doped PCBM derivatives, such as Bis-FIMG, and Bis-C60 (Fig. 20) were also used in 2018 as ETLs in PSCs, which effectively extracted and transported electrons, and blocked holes and thus contributed to PCE of over 19%.15,21,121–125 Besides, the device's hysteresis effect and stability were obviously improved under ambient conditions. In addition to self-doped ETL, transition metal-catalyzed N-DMBI doped OSCs were also used in PSCs, in which the PCE was dramatically increased from 9.3% to 18.9%.63

4.2. n-Type doping in the electron transporting layers and active layers of OPVs
Different from PSCs, the active layer of OPVs has two components: electron donor and electron acceptor (Fig. 21a). In comparison with highly conductive perovskites, organic semiconductors for OPVs usually suffer from low charge mobility (SCLC measurements). As a result, ETLs and HTLs become indispensable. The insertion of charge-transporting layers between the active layer and electrodes, will promote Ohmic contact, enhance charge extraction and transport, and mitigate recombination, which improves FF, JSC, and VOC. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate), PEDOT:PSS is a versatile HTL and significantly improves the device performance of OPVs. However, when compared with HTLs, the investigation of ETLs lagged behind. An effective ETL should be transparent, stable, electron conductive, and have matched energy levels. Recently, n-type self-doped fullerene derivatives (PCBB-3N-3I),15 PDI-50,126 and externally doped PFN-Br with a dopant, melamine127 were used to replace the undoped organic semiconductors as ETLs for OPVs, in which impressively PCEs were achieved (Fig. 20). Interestingly, due to the good contact and high electrical conductivities of n-doped ETLs, the devices kept high-performance with varied thickness of ELTs.15,125 Except for n-doped ETLs, n-type dopant was also used to dope acceptor in bulk heterojunctions because electron transport was unfavorable relative to hole transport. For example, benzyl viologen (BV),128 diquat (DQ),7 and DMBI-BDZC129 (Fig. 21b and c) with high-lying HOMO energy levels were used to n-dope the non-fullerene acceptor Y6. Obviously, an increased EPR signal was observed after the addition of DQ in the active layer (Fig. 21b), which demonstrated the generation of radical anions. TBABr was also used for n-type doping of BHJ by anion–π interaction.130 Notably, the n-type dopants, not only improved the electron transport, which led to balanced hole and electron mobilities, but also help to modify the microstructure. Based on this synergistic effect, the PCEs of OPVs were significantly enhanced. The effectiveness of n-type doping highlighted in OPVs demonstrates that electron transport is critical for achieving higher performance and there is still plenty of room for chemical scientists to develop new n-type doping systems.

4.3. n-Type dopants for channel and contact doping in organic field-effect transistors
Various high-performance OSCs for OFETs (Fig. 22) have been developed during the last twenty years.131–135 The devices’ performance, especially charge mobility, is now comparable to the amorphous silicon. Meanwhile, the devices’ stability and reliability are improved due to the enormous effort of scientists. However, n-type OFETs still show relatively low device performances and stability when compared with their p-type counterparts. n-Type OSCs with sufficiently deep LUMO energy levels (<−4.1 eV) and high electron mobility are highly deficient. The relatively unfavorable charge transport in n-type OFETs is due to the existence of large energy barriers and electron traps. The energy barrier between metal electrodes and OSCs is due to the unmatched work function of metals and LUMO energy levels of OSCs, which prevent the efficient electron injection. The electron traps are possibly generated from the H2O/O2, the molecular moieties, or the unfavorable microstructures, which impede electron transport. As a result, n-type doping is used for channel and contact doping in OFETs, which significantly improved the devices’ performances, and air stability, and served as an effective way to tune charge carriers (Fig. 23).26,63,123,136–157 For example, the insertion of amine-based n-type dopants between metal electrodes and OSCs for contact doping were shown to feasibly tune the metal work function and reduce the electron injection barriers, which contributes to increased electron mobility and smaller threshold voltages.138,144,148,155 Different from contact doping, channel doping should be carefully controlled. As shown in the case of the typical n-type OSC, PCBM, low and suitably n-type dopant ratios were able to effectively fill electron traps, improve microstructures, and thus improve both device parameters and air stability.137 When the dopant ratios were over a certain level, it would break microstructure and increase carrier concentrations, which led to low OFET performances: high off current, small Ion/off, and low electron mobility. In addition to the above applications, n-type doping was also used to modulate the type of charge carriers. TIPS-pentacene is a well-known p-type OSC with impressively high hole mobility. When mixed with n-type dopants, for example, o-MeO-DMBI (Fig. 6), electrons were injected into the TIPS-Pentacene: o-MeO-DMBI layer and a high electron mobility of 6.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 and Ion/off of 106 were obtained.139 Similarly, in ambipolar OFETs, one type of carrier could be aided when suppressing the other one, which enables the feasible tuning of charge transport.158

4.4. n-Type doping in organic light-emitting diodes
For the commercialization of OLEDs, reactive alkali metals with strong electron-donating capability, such as lithium (Li) and cesium (Cs) were used as n-type dopants to modify the work functions of cathodes, which effectively facilitated the electron injections and improved devices’ performances.159–161 However, high evaporation temperature, hazardous reactivity, and exciton quenching by diffusivity of alkali metals limited their further applications. Recently, in the presence of chelating ligands, traditional air-stable and inactive metals could also release free electrons by the irreversible coordination reaction to n-dope electrodes, which effectively upshifted work functions (WF) of the cathodes and enhanced electron injection efficiency in OLEDs.162–168 For example, silver (Ag) and diphenanthroline compounds formed tetrahedrally coordinated double-helical metal complexes during co-evaporation. The coordinated metal complexes shifted the WF of the aluminium (Al) cathode from 3.6 to 3.0 eV, which matched well with the LUMO energy levels of commonly used electron transport molecules. Notably, the charge injection efficiency achieved in the Ag:diphenanthroline doped OLEDs was even better than that in lithium fluoride (LiF) and 8-hydroxyquinolinato lithium (Liq), which thus contributed to an EQE of 10.3%, among the highest EQE values for triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA)-driven deep-blue OLEDs.
Small-molecule-based OLEDs have been investigated extensively and become commercially available.1–6,169 In comparison, polymer-based OLEDs are lagged behind. The fabrication of all-polymer OLEDs shows great potential in stretchable light-emitting displays, which can be used in e-skin and other wearable electronic devices.170,171 Intrinsically stretchable emissive semiconducting polymers or polymer blends were developed recently as active layers.170,172 p-Type doped OSC, PEDOT:PSS as a well-known hole-transporting layer could be easily deposited and was stretchable. However, stretchable electron transporting layers were deficient due to the lack of n-doped conducting polymers, which exhibited matched energy levels and electron transporting capability. n-Type dopants can n-dope p-type OSCs or metal electrodes to upshift the work function for electron injection and transport, as discussed above. Therefore, effective n-type dopants such as PFN-Br/PEIE were deposited on top of PEDOT:PSS to act as an electron injection layer and electron transporting layer for the fabrication of all-polymer stretchable OLEDs (Fig. 24).170 The devices showed high brightness (about 7450cd m−2), current efficiency (about 5.3cd A−1), and stretchability (about 100% strain). Moreover, three different colors including red, green, and blue OLEDs were achieved on the skin and in real-time displays.

4.5. n-Type doped conducting polymer inks
The development of printable organic electronics requires stable and soluble p-type and n-type conducting materials. The successful commercialization of the p-type conductive polymer, PEDOT:PSS water solutions, has greatly facilitated the development of electronic devices. The feasible tuning of electrical conductivities and energy levels in PEDOT:PSS makes it an effective hole-transporting layer in solar cells, OLEDs, or an active layer in organic electrochemical field-effect transistors, OTEs, etc. While in comparison, the n-type conductive polymers are highly deficient. Recently, an n-type doped ladder semiconductor, BBL (Fig. 25) has shown great potential as a conductive ink.82 After ultrasonic mixing with an n-type dopant, PEI in an environment-friendly solvent such as ethanol, the n-type doped conductive ink was formed. The BBL:PEI ink was able to deposit on various substrates by spray coating. After thermal-annealing in an inert atmosphere, the resulting thin film showed an electrical conductivity of 8.0 S cm−1. The BBL:PEI ink was then used in thermoelectric generators, and electrochemical transistors, in which a power factor of 11 μW m−1 K−2 was achieved, and a unique depletion mode of operation was observed. However, the moderate LUMO energy level (−4.15 eV) of BBL led to the air stability issue: the electrical conductivity of self-encapsulation thick films decreased by 20% within 24 h. Very recently, an in situ n-type doped conductive PBFDO ink (Section 3.4) was developed.66,112 The PBFDO ink showed enhanced air stability, electrical conductivity, and device performances due to its much deeper LUMO energy levels (−5.18 eV). Besides, the highly conductive PBFDO could function as transparent electrodes and flexible conductive wires for multiple applications such as electrochromic switching, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes. The development of n-type conductive inks may reshape the electronic devices’ structure and significantly enhance the devices’ performance in the near future.

5. Conclusions
In this review, the issues of doping efficiency and doping air stability in n-type doped OSCs were carefully addressed. We first clarified the main factors that influenced chemical doping in n-type OSCs and then explained the origin of instability in n-type doped films under ambient conditions. The doping microstructure, charge transfer, and dissociation efficiency were found to determine the overall doping efficiency, which could be precisely tuned by conjugated backbones, side chains, dopants, frontier-orbital energy levels, intermolecular interactions, and post-treatments such as ion-exchange. Notably, lowering LUMO energy levels and enhancing charge delocalization would contribute to both high n-doped electrical conductivity and air stability. A molecular backbone exhibiting tight π–π stacking in n-type doped thin films could keep off H2O/O2, which would benefit air stability. In comparison with external chemical doping described above, self-doping, in situ doping and coordination polymerization could make OSCs more conductive and robust in air. Self-encapsulation could be used to further improve the air stability when deep LUMO energy levels (∼−4.7 eV) were achieved and the initial n-doped performance of thin films could be retained in thicker films.
In addition to the design strategies discussed above, very recently, a series of novel n-type doping methods such as ground-state charge transfer, switch from heavy p-doping to n-doping, and mixed electron and ion conductors were proposed, which might serve as an alternative to address the critical challenges in n-type doping. As shown in the recent work, ground-state electron transfer was found and moderate n-type doped electrical conductivity was achieved in two semiconducting polymer bulk heterojunctions: BBL and P(g42T-T), in which the HOMO energy level (−4.43 eV) of P(g42T-T) was close to the LUMO energy level of BBL (−4.15 eV).41 Since the traditionally non-conductive and unstable n-type dopants are avoided in this new doping way, higher electrical conductivity and air stability in this n-type doped conducting materials could be expected if the LUMO energy level of the n-type semiconductor is deep enough (∼−4.7 eV) and doping efficiency is further enhanced. Besides, the excessive p-type doping could be applied in n-type OSC materials.67,173–175 The strong oxidant, FeCl3 was used to dope p-type semiconducting polymer PDPP-4T, and the Seebeck coefficients changed from positive (p-type) to negative (n-type) with increasing doping levels, which might be attributed to the switch of dominant charge carriers from the hole to electron, and transporting modes from hopping to band-like. The high n-type power factor of 9.2 μW m−1 K−2 achieved in this doped system would make this unique doping way very attractive in developing air-stable n-type doped OSCs. In comparison with NDI, its extended π-conjugated derivative, perylene diimide (PDI) obtained less attention in n-type doped OSCs. Very recently, hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) was used to dope PDI, and an excellent PF of 165 μW m−1 K−2 was obtained, which could be attributed to the high doping efficiency and the Soret effect.91,176 After exposure to air for 24 h, only 13% of the initial electrical conductivity was kept due to its high-lying LUMO energy level of −4.0 eV. Further decreasing the LUMO energy levels of PDI by CN or halogen atom substitutions as reported previously, might make n-type doped PDI more attractive in air-stable n-type OTE materials.177 Besides, chemical modification of organic material systems such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs)178–180 or metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)181–183 enabling deep LUMO energy levels and efficient charge transporting ways may become a possible way to achieve more stable and high-performance n-type doped OSCs.
Further exploring self-doping material systems with deep LUMO energy levels as summarized in this review is also an attractive way, since problems in external chemical doping can be relieved. Moreover, developing new or applying the reported single-component radical or diradical conductors with deep LUMO energy levels for n-type doped OSC materials may become a good choice. The (di)radical compounds can achieve a low HOMO–LUMO band gap by chemical modulations. Intermolecular spin–spin interactions due to the existence of unpaired electrons can enhance the molecular orbital overlap and thus increase the bandwidth, which leads to high pristine electrical conductivities without external chemical doping as reviewed recently.59,184,185 High Seebeck coefficients can also be retained in the pristine films, which may together contribute to higher thermoelectric performances.186 In addition to single-component small-molecule radical conductors, conjugated polymeric (di)radicals exhibiting high electrical conductivities were also developed very recently.187–191
Notably, the development of high-performance air-stable n-type doped OSCs materials is in an early stage. Still, there are a series of unsettled issues: for example, how to achieve high doping efficiency and clean doping (without by-product) at a low dopant ratio? How to improve thermal stability, morphology stability, and air stability simultaneously? What is the role of dopant counterion in n-doped systems? Besides, the application of n-type doped OSCs in OTEs would require the balance of Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivity, both depending on the precise tuning of doping efficiency. It remains a great challenge to achieve high-performance and air-stable n-type OTEs. Moreover, n-type doping is playing an important role in improving electron transport and device performances in optoelectronics, which will greatly inspire chemical scientists since there is plenty of room for developing new and high-performance n-type OSCs and dopants. Therefore, more insightful investigations of the structure–property relationship and the proposal of new mechanisms in n-type doped OSCs, with the aid of artificial intelligence are required to achieve the synergy between device performances, air stability, and doping efficiency. Meanwhile, developing new doping methods and material systems with deep LUMO energy levels that aim for stable and efficient n-type doped OSC materials become emergent.
