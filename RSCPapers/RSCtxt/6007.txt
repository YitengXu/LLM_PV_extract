    , Accepted 13th September 2016First published on 16th September 2016AbstractIntegrating photosynthetic membrane proteins with non-biological materials such as polymers and electrodes is attractive, as it could allow new ways of harvesting solar energy for direct electrical power, sensing, or chemical production. However, such integration is challenging, as these proteins have to be “wired” to electrodes and oriented to maximize light capture and electron transfer all while maintaining long-term activity. In this work we present a durable and unique solution to the challenges of stabilization and wiring of photosynthetic membrane proteins on electrodes. A block copolymer, poly(butadiene)12-poly(ethylene oxide)8 (PB12-PEO8), that mimics the bilayer assembly of lipids was used to stabilize photosystem I (PSI) in a near-native hydrophobic environment. At high protein concentrations, large, highly packed planar membranes (∼4 nm thick) were formed, which allowed high surface loading of protein at the electrode interface. To “wire” these membranes with metal electrodes, a conductive block copolymer bilayer based on the same PB12-PEO8 but with intercalated conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) was used. This photo-active conductive layer was used to conduct electrons while maintaining a stabilizing cell membrane-like hydrated environment at the protein–metal interface. Photocurrents approaching 35.0 ± 3.5 μA cm−2 were generated upon illumination of these assembled devices with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), among the highest reported so far for such systems on a per protein basis. This is the first application of membrane proteins completely stabilized in and on a block copolymer support for an energy-relevant electrochemical device and may represent the highest photocurrent generation per protein.
Introduction
Photosynthetic proteins are of increasing interest for applications as biosensors2–4 and solar-to-electric5–13 and solar-to-hydrogen14–16 energy conversion devices. Their efficient light harvesting and electron transfer machinery is commonly exploited at electrode interfaces.17 However, while native photosynthetic membrane proteins are stabilized in lipid bilayers,18 many engineered systems stabilize photosynthetic proteins in detergent micelles19,20 or small peptides,21 which may limit protein adsorption and function on electrodes.22,23 A lipid bilayer-like membrane matrix is advantageous, since the membrane can densely pack these membrane proteins with proper alignment and protect the protein structure from strong surface interactions.1 In fact, electron transfer across membranes is an essential process in a variety of biological systems including respiration,24 photosynthesis,25 drug metabolism,26 and extracellular electron transport through bacterial nanowires.27 Here, we use an artificial membrane approach that generates stable photocurrents by reconstituting photosystem I (PSI) into poly(butadiene)12-poly(ethylene oxide)8 (PB12-PEO8) block copolymers (BCPs) to form a highly packed PSI–BCP composite membrane and interfaced these membranes with an electrode through a BCP–conjugated electrolytes (COEs) composite conductive polymer interface (Fig. 1). BCP membranes are highly stable compared to previously-used lipid membranes and biocompatible, supporting long-term membrane protein incorporation and functional stability.28–30 Membrane protein containing BCPs have been proposed for various applications including drug delivery,31 biosensors,32 and water filtration technologies.33 A challenge with interfacing proteins with electrodes is the proper design of an interface that not only stabilizes the protein but also allows efficient electron transfer between the protein and the electrode. Nature again presents an excellent inspiration for such electron transfer through membranes, however, many current bioelectric systems lack membrane integration.
 Fig. 1  Design of Photosystem I (PSI) block copolymer integrated membrane. A block copolymer (BCP) bilayer membrane based interface with conjugated electrolytes (COEs) provides efficient electron transfer to Photosystem I (PSI) proteins incorporated at high density in another block copolymer membrane. COEs and the photosynthetic membrane protein, PSI, were stabilized in poly(butadiene)12-poly(ethylene oxide)8 (PB12-PEO8) BCP membranes. Short-chain amphiphilic BCP membranes can have similar thickness as lipid bilayers (∼4 nm). Hydrophobic regions (pink) represent the PB block of the BCP and stabilize the hydrophobic region of COEs and the protein surface. COEs intercalated into a BCP bilayer form two-dimensional membranes on electrodes and enable efficient electron transfer to the proteins, which allows large photocurrent generation. This hydrated film provides a biocompatible environment to the protein components protruding from the BCP membrane, in the absence of which could lead to protein denaturation on un-functionalized metal electrodes. The hydrophilic blocks (blue regions) of the BCP are PEO blocks and are hydrated with water, making them compatible with amino acids located near the membrane interface. The hydrophobic interactions between membrane proteins, such as PSI, and BCPs lead to large, self-assembled planar membrane structures in water. The photosynthetic protein functionalized membranes can then be integrated into a bioelectronic device using electrostatic interactions to immobilize PSI membranes on the COE intercalated BCP bilayer. Light energy collected by the PSI protein pumps electrons from the electrode to the solution phase. 
Bioelectric systems are interfaced with electrodes in enzymatic fuel cells,11 microbial fuel cells,34 and photosynthetic devices17 in a variety of ways. Emerging interfacial materials used in this context include carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene,35 nanoparticles,36 and conductive polymers (CPs).36–38 Conjugated CPs such as polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI) and osmium redox polymers (OsRPs) are of significant interest due to their tuneable redox potentials39 and use as a functional support matrix for drugs and enzymes.37 However, when used as the sole interfacial material, CPs have poor mechanical properties and bio-compatibility, resulting in film delamination.38,40 Composite materials of CPs integrated with elastomers, hydrogels and CNTs offer enhanced flexibility, biocompatibility, and mechanical stability.38
Here, we devised a bioinspired strategy to provide a native membrane-like interface for electron transfer from electrodes to PSI. We utilized BCP membranes on electrodes as cell membrane mimicking interfaces. Lipid-mimicking amphiphilic BCPs can self-assemble into structures resembling lipid bilayers41 that mimic cell interfaces. BCP membranes stay assembled with stronger hydrophobic interactions than lipid molecules30 and can be cross-linked together to form stable films.42 We further functionalized PB12-PEO8 BCP membranes with intercalated short (∼4 nm) COEs that span the membrane thickness to allow electron transfer across the artificial membranes. These COEs have a phenylene vinylene conjugated core and at each end have two alkyl chains with terminal quaternary ammonium functionalities.43 COEs are known to incorporate into lipid membranes and have recently been applied in bioelectrochemical systems for energy generation, environmental remediation, and antimicrobial treatment.44 We show for the first time intercalation of COEs into polymer membranes and use this composite conductive membrane in a bio-electrochemical device for photocurrent generation. We further show that this interfacial approach can be chemically crosslinked without loss of electron transfer activity.
We show by pump-probe optical spectroscopy that PSI retains activity within the BCP membrane and when deposited on the BCP–COE interface formed on electrodes. Our system can produce a photocurrent of 35.0 ± 3.5 μA cm−2 when the PSI–BCP membranes are linked to COE modified gold electrodes, which is twice the photocurrent produced from PSI-lipid crystals on COE/lipid bilayers using the same amount of PSI.45 These results show for the first time functional photosynthetic proteins in BCPs in an electrochemical device and with a long-term photocurrent that is almost an order of magnitude higher than previous studies.46
Results and discussion
Conjugated oligoelectrolytes intercalate into block copolymer membranes
We used poly(butadiene)12-poly(ethylene oxide)8 (PB12-PEO8) as a bilayer membrane forming block copolymer for incorporation of the conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE), 4,4′-bis(4′-(N,N-bis(6′′-(N,N,N-trimethylammonium)hexyl)amino)-styryl)stilbene tetraiodide (DSSN+). We formed small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) of ∼200 nm diameter by using film rehydration methods41 and confirmed their assembly with cryo-TEM (ESI, Fig. S1†). To assemble larger vesicles (>1 μm diameter) for use in confocal microscopy, we formed giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) from PB12-PEO8 (Fig. 2B) using the cross-linked dextran (ethylene glycol) hydrogel method.47 With the addition of DSSN+ (Fig. 2A), the GUVs exhibited a fluorescent signal characteristic of membrane intercalated DSSN+ (Fig. 2C and D). In DMPC lipid bilayers, the absorbance/excitation of DSSN+ is red shifted by 21 nm from 412 nm to 433 nm and the emission/fluorescence is blue shifted in the bilayer by 62 nm from 594 nm to 532 nm.43 We see a 28 nm red shift from 402 nm to 430 nm for excitation and a 24 nm blue shift for emission from 372 nm to 348 nm (Fig. 2E). The extent of the emission shift depends on the difference in polarity in the aqueous versus hydrophobic environment. Since we use BCP instead of lipids, we hypothesize that the observed difference is an indication of the hydrophobicity difference between a lipid bilayer core and the block copolymer hydrophobic region.43

The hydrophobic region of the PB12-PEO8 stabilizes the conjugated core structure of DSSN+. DSSN+ was added at 0.5 mol% relative to the BCP (1 mg mL−1). (B) Bright field image of PB12-PEO8 giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) after addition of DSSN+. GUVs were formed by a dextran hydrogel (C and D) with the addition of DSSN+, the GUVs exhibited a fluorescent signal characteristic of membrane intercalated DSSN+. (E) When fluorescent DSSN+ intercalates into PB12-PEO8 GUVs, there is a 22 nm red shift for excitation and a 24 nm blue shift for emission. The extent of the shift depends on the difference of polarity in the aqueous versus hydrophobic environment. 
Functional photosynthetic protein arrays form in the presence of block copolymers
Photosystem I (PSI) protein was isolated from cyanobacteria cells using sucrose gradient centrifugation and was verified using 77 K fluorescence spectroscopy (ESI, Fig. S2†).48,49 Purified PSI was reconstituted into PB12-PEO8 BCP membranes at a polymer–protein ratio (PoPR) (w/w) of 0.5 to 1.0. These ratios approach those used to assemble two-dimensional (2D) membrane protein crystals in lipids and block copolymers (Fig. 3A and B). At higher PoPRs, membrane proteins form vesicles in PB-PEO (see Fig. S3 for TEM of lower and higher PoPRs†).28,45 Membrane proteins such as aquaporins (AQP) and outer membrane protein F (OmpF) can associate with PB-PEO to form unilamellar flat sheet membranes and crystals via a dialysis technique developed by Kumar et al.50,51 We used dialysis to form membranes with the photosynthetic membrane protein PSI and PB12-PEO8 BCPs (Fig. 3A–C). PB-PEO without PSI proteins are known to form small (∼200 nm) vesicles (Fig. S1†), micelles or worm-like micelles.28,52 In contrast to the thick, multi-lamellar photosynthetic–BCP structures developed by Kuang et al.53 and Hua et al.,54 and polymersomes developed by Tangorra et al.55 and Zapf et al.,56 our membranes are large (>200 nm diameter) and unilamellar and assembled at a very low PoPR (high protein concentrations).

Planar sheets formed after detergent dialysis of PSI and poly(butadiene)12-poly(ethylene oxide)8 (PB12-PEO8) at PoPRs between 0.5 and 1. (C) Large membranes are ideal for bioelectric devices, as PSI is densely packed into the membrane and oriented perpendicular to the membrane to enable photosynthetic electron transfer across the membrane similar to that seen in biological photosynthetic membranes. 
Pump-probe optical spectroscopy (Fig. 4A) shows that a photo-induced charge separated state is generated for both PSI in detergent micelles and in BCP membranes under continuous illumination. This technique has been demonstrated previously to show activity of PSI in detergent micelles and lipid membranes.45 During PSI-actinic illumination conditions (actinic light turned on at 10 seconds and turned off at 15 seconds), the primary electron donor of PSI (P700) becomes photooxidized, causing a negative absorbance change at 700 nm. Following cessation of illumination (at 15 seconds), P700+ is fully reduced by soluble acceptors as shown by the recovery of the photobleaching at 700 nm. Our results indicate that the reversible photooxidation and reduction of P700/P700+ is maintained in the BCP membrane environment. This is consistent with the results of Kuang et al., 2014 who demonstrated the primary rate of charge separation in reaction centers from Rhodobacter sphaeroides was similar in both a native membrane as well as in the block copolymer PB-poly(4-vinyl-N-methylpyridine iodide)2 (P4MVP2).53 In addition, we demonstrate that the BCPs did not influence the UV-vis spectrum and 77 K fluorescence signal of PSI (Fig. S2 and S3†).
 Fig. 4  (A) The light harvesting and charge separation function of PSI within PB-PEO membranes was confirmed by pump-probe optical spectroscopy. Continuous actinic light turned on at time 10 seconds leads to the photooxidation of the primary electron donor P700 as seen by the photobleaching of the absorbance at 700 nm. At time 15 seconds, the actinic light is turned off and the oxidized P700+ population is reduced by soluble electron donors. The reversible photobleaching of P700 demonstrates that the primary electron donor site of PSI is accessible to the solution and light-induced electron transfer through PSI is maintained in BCP membranes as in detergent micelles. (B) The use of synthetic BCPs and conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) increase the electron transport efficiency to a redox couple. A tethered polymer bilayer membrane formed on electrodes creates a biomimetic interface for protein immobilization, but is not highly conductive. On the other hand, bare gold electrodes are highly conductive, but may damage the protein due to strong metal–protein interactions at the interface.1 When the COE, DSSN+, is intercalated into the bilayer, a conductive, hydrated interface is formed. This interface is ideal for redox protein immobilization and functionality. (C and D) DSSN+ BCP bilayers have a photocurrent of 0.55 ± 0.13 μA cm−2. A 3.5 times PSI-driven photocurrent increase is observed when DSSN+ is incorporated into the immobilized BCP layer. The PSI–BCP and DSSN+/BCP composite membrane produces a maximum of 35 ± 3.5 μA cm−2. Electron transfer proceeds from the electrode, through the COE-bilayer, to the PSI–BCP membrane during illumination (1000 μmol m−2 s−1) for a period of approximately 40 seconds. 
Surface functionalization of gold electrodes with conductive polymer bilayer membranes shows excellent electron transfer capabilities
COEs, such as DSSN+, spontaneously intercalate into lipid vesicles and membranes which can be tethered or absorbed on electrodes to show enhanced conductivity across the bilayer.43,45 Here we assemble a BCP bilayer on gold electrodes by using detergent dialysis in the presence of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM).57,58 In this method, a gold electrode is SAM functionalized with a thiolated block copolymer, which acts as an anchor for the formation of a bilayer during dialysis (Fig. S4 and S5†). We formed tethered BCP bilayers with and without DSSN+ and used cyclic voltammetry (CV) to compare surface conductivity to un-functionalized gold electrodes (Fig. 4B). By modifying gold electrodes with a polymer bilayer (without COEs) the electric current from a ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple decreases substantially as compared to un-functionalized gold. When DSSN+ is introduced during assembly, electron transfer to a redox couple is increased as shown by the CV trace (Fig. 4B). We also studied the spreading and homogeneity of the DSSN+ on the electrode using fluorescent imaging (Fig. S7†). We characterized the immobilized DSSN+ by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to show that, as expected, the DSSN+ is highly stable (with very low lateral diffusion) and spans the immobilized bilayer membrane deposited on the electrode surface (Fig. S8†). Lastly, we attempted to cross-link the polybutadiene block and showed the conductivity of the interface is not compromised when exposed to UV light for over 12 hours (Fig. S11†).
Photocurrent generation from 2D arrays of photosystem interfaced to conductive polymers is two times higher than similar systems based on lipids
We utilized a tethered composite BCP membrane with intercalated conductive polymers using DSSN+ to facilitate electron transport to the PSI–BCP membrane. Relatively large photocurrents can be achieved from anchoring two-dimensional crystals of PSI in lipid membranes on modified lipid/COE electrodes.45 COE-modified electrodes enhance cathodic photocurrent activity by at least a factor of four, which may be attributed to increased electron transfer across the support layer to the protein and electron mediators (100 μM 1-methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methyl sulfate (PMS), 100 μM potassium ferrocyanide and potassium ferricyanide).43 In a similar manner, we show that DSSN+ increases electron transfer across block copolymer membranes to the PSI protein (Fig. 4C). The DSSN+, PB-PEO membrane produces a photocurrent of 0.55 ± 0.13 μA cm−2 when illuminated (a PB-PEO membrane without DSSN+ and with all electron mediators present produced zero photocurrent; Fig. S9†). This result is comparable to the ranges for DSSN+ within immobilized lipid bilayers reported by Lee et al. 2013 (ref. 59) and Saboe et al. 2014.45 The photocurrent stability of the COE/BCP bilayer was sustained for over a month (Fig. S10†). Highly packed PSI–BCP membranes were absorbed onto a COE/BCP interface through electrostatic interactions. PSI has a net negative charge60 and the 25 mol% DSSN+ BCP mixture used to form the active layer of the electrode had a slightly positive zeta potential (∼4 mV). A photocurrent of 35.0 ± 3.5 μA cm−2 was generated from immobilized PSI/BCP membranes on the DSSN+/BCP interface (Fig. 4D). This photocurrent is 3.5 times higher than from PSI–BCP membranes on the BCP interface without DSSN+ (Fig. 4D). The photocurrent from PSI–BCP membranes on DSSN+/BCP films was stable for at least a month, indicating high stability of the overall system (Fig. S12†). Our results show that the COE/block copolymer hybrid material may provide the most stable interface for efficient electron transfer to proteins (see Table S1†), and that photosynthetic membrane proteins can be functionally incorporated at high densities in block copolymer membranes.
The proposed electron transfer interface presents several advantages over current interfaces and may be a robust interface for a number of redox proteins. Redox enzymes, including PSI, are often immobilized on electrodes by using interfaces such as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs),61 osmium redox polymers,62 and PANI.63 These interfaces were designed to prevent protein denaturation that is known to occur when proteins contact bare metal electrodes.64 SAMs provide a stabilizing environment for protein deposition but are not conductive nor are they designed to stabilize membrane proteins,45,65,66 such as photosynthetic membrane proteins. Osmium polymers offer tuneable redox potentials39,62 and protein stabilizing hydrated interfaces, but are limited by the use of a transition metal element and by their non-homogeneous electrical and physical film properties.67–69 Composite CP hydrogels are a promising interface for biological electron transfer applications.38,40 However, the extent of solvation and phase separation between the CP and supporting matrix materials often limits the electrical performance and mechanical properties of the hydrogel.70 We used PB-PEO BCP membranes with a PEO block acting as a single layer bilayer interface between the electrode and biological components. PEO is commonly used as a hydrogel material in tissue engineering applications71 and provides a stabilizing environment for proteins.50 We show that COE molecules intercalate homogeneously into PB-PEO bilayer membranes, lowering the barrier for electron transport across the membrane. The composite membrane can thus be an efficient interface for electron transfer to the photosynthetic membrane protein, PSI.
Conclusions
Here we show that DSSN+ and PSI are functional within a biomimetic block copolymer membrane in solution and when immobilized on an electrode. These composite membranes were combined into a photo-active device that was able to generate high photocurrents, making this device ideal for integration into a stable bioelectrochemical hydrogen cell or other bioelectrochemical devices. Composite BCP–COE materials have implications for improved biomedical devices and energy technologies, particularly those challenged by non-ideal abiotic–biotic interfaces. We anticipate additional interest in demonstrating and utilizing electron transport to other redox proteins and biological systems by tuning surface proteins and electrochemical properties of the interface. Additionally, the development of artificial photosynthetic protein “maquettes”, raises the possibility of a completely artificial bioinspired organic photoactive membrane.72

 	Fig. 1  Design of Photosystem I (PSI) block copolymer integrated membrane. A block copolymer (BCP) bilayer membrane based interface with conjugated electrolytes (COEs) provides efficient electron transfer to Photosystem I (PSI) proteins incorporated at high density in another block copolymer membrane. COEs and the photosynthetic membrane protein, PSI, were stabilized in poly(butadiene)12-poly(ethylene oxide)8 (PB12-PEO8) BCP membranes. Short-chain amphiphilic BCP membranes can have similar thickness as lipid bilayers (∼4 nm). Hydrophobic regions (pink) represent the PB block of the BCP and stabilize the hydrophobic region of COEs and the protein surface. COEs intercalated into a BCP bilayer form two-dimensional membranes on electrodes and enable efficient electron transfer to the proteins, which allows large photocurrent generation. This hydrated film provides a biocompatible environment to the protein components protruding from the BCP membrane, in the absence of which could lead to protein denaturation on un-functionalized metal electrodes. The hydrophilic blocks (blue regions) of the BCP are PEO blocks and are hydrated with water, making them compatible with amino acids located near the membrane interface. The hydrophobic interactions between membrane proteins, such as PSI, and BCPs lead to large, self-assembled planar membrane structures in water. The photosynthetic protein functionalized membranes can then be integrated into a bioelectronic device using electrostatic interactions to immobilize PSI membranes on the COE intercalated BCP bilayer. Light energy collected by the PSI protein pumps electrons from the electrode to the solution phase.	 

 	Fig. 2  (A) The conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) DSSN+ inserts into poly(butadiene)12-poly(ethylene oxide)8 (PB12-PEO8) vesicles. The hydrophobic region of the PB12-PEO8 stabilizes the conjugated core structure of DSSN+. DSSN+ was added at 0.5 mol% relative to the BCP (1 mg mL−1). (B) Bright field image of PB12-PEO8 giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) after addition of DSSN+. GUVs were formed by a dextran hydrogel (C and D) with the addition of DSSN+, the GUVs exhibited a fluorescent signal characteristic of membrane intercalated DSSN+. (E) When fluorescent DSSN+ intercalates into PB12-PEO8 GUVs, there is a 22 nm red shift for excitation and a 24 nm blue shift for emission. The extent of the shift depends on the difference of polarity in the aqueous versus hydrophobic environment.	 

 	Fig. 3  (A and B) TEM micrographs and of negatively stained photosystem I (PSI) protein reconstituted within block copolymers (BCPs). Planar sheets formed after detergent dialysis of PSI and poly(butadiene)12-poly(ethylene oxide)8 (PB12-PEO8) at PoPRs between 0.5 and 1. (C) Large membranes are ideal for bioelectric devices, as PSI is densely packed into the membrane and oriented perpendicular to the membrane to enable photosynthetic electron transfer across the membrane similar to that seen in biological photosynthetic membranes.	 

 	Fig. 4  (A) The light harvesting and charge separation function of PSI within PB-PEO membranes was confirmed by pump-probe optical spectroscopy. Continuous actinic light turned on at time 10 seconds leads to the photooxidation of the primary electron donor P700 as seen by the photobleaching of the absorbance at 700 nm. At time 15 seconds, the actinic light is turned off and the oxidized P700+ population is reduced by soluble electron donors. The reversible photobleaching of P700 demonstrates that the primary electron donor site of PSI is accessible to the solution and light-induced electron transfer through PSI is maintained in BCP membranes as in detergent micelles. (B) The use of synthetic BCPs and conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) increase the electron transport efficiency to a redox couple. A tethered polymer bilayer membrane formed on electrodes creates a biomimetic interface for protein immobilization, but is not highly conductive. On the other hand, bare gold electrodes are highly conductive, but may damage the protein due to strong metal–protein interactions at the interface.1 When the COE, DSSN+, is intercalated into the bilayer, a conductive, hydrated interface is formed. This interface is ideal for redox protein immobilization and functionality. (C and D) DSSN+ BCP bilayers have a photocurrent of 0.55 ± 0.13 μA cm−2. A 3.5 times PSI-driven photocurrent increase is observed when DSSN+ is incorporated into the immobilized BCP layer. The PSI–BCP and DSSN+/BCP composite membrane produces a maximum of 35 ± 3.5 μA cm−2. Electron transfer proceeds from the electrode, through the COE-bilayer, to the PSI–BCP membrane during illumination (1000 μmol m−2 s−1) for a period of approximately 40 seconds.
