    , Accepted 24th September 2012First published on 28th September 2012AbstractRecent developments in supramolecular strategies have enabled us to construct novel well-defined assemblies of dye molecules. These fundamental researches of such organic materials also entail the synthetic and photophysical processes of molecular aggregates at the nano- and micro-meter scale, since their optical properties significantly differ from those of monomeric species. One of the promising candidates for such functional molecules is a porphyrin dye, which acts as an electron donor as well as a sensitizer. In this perspective, the focus is on the recent advances in the construction of optically and electronically functionalized molecular architectures of porphyrins for light energy conversion and electronics. First, porphyrin aggregates with morphologies such as cube, rod and fiber, which are prepared by three different supramolecular techniques, are reported. Then, we discuss composite molecular nanoarchitectures of porphyrins and carbon nanotubes such as single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), stacked-cup carbon nanotubes (SCCNTs) and carbon nanohorns (CNHs). Finally, the structural and photophysical properties of the composite assemblies of porphyrins and graphenes including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are presented.Taku HasobeTaku Hasobe is an associate professor at the Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University.

1 Introduction
In the past decade, great effort has been devoted to the construction of supramolecular architectures because of their unique structures and potential applications.1–3 Self-assembly as a method for organizing molecules is a simple and convenient way to design size- and shape-controlled molecular architectures at the nano- and micro-scale.4–8 Such a technique makes it possible to achieve novel phenomena and properties in comparison with those of the corresponding monomeric forms.9–16 The driving force of self-assembly in aggregate structures is mainly dependent on single interactions such as π–π interactions.7,17,18 However, by introducing new functional groups onto the peripheral positions, which induces additional intermolecular interactions including van der Waals,19,20 hydrogen,4,9 and coordination bonds,5,21–23 we can construct high-order organization systems. Thus, cooperative and/or competitive effects between two different interactions lead to the organization of functional molecular materials with different morphologies. Such a strategy enables us to construct a variety of superstructures with different sizes and shapes. Promising applications include solar energy conversion and electronics etc.24–27
One of the good candidates for photo- and electro-functional materials is a porphyrin, which is involved as a chromophore and an electron donor in a number of important biological systems including the primary photochemical reactions of chlorophylls (porphyrin derivatives) in the photosynthetic reaction centers.13,28–31 Therefore, porphyrins are also suitable for efficient electron transfer because of small reorganization energies.32–35 Additionally, the rich and extensive absorption features of porphyrinoid systems guarantees increased absorption cross-sections and an efficient use of the solar spectrum.36 On the other hand, porphyrins are also promising building blocks for superstructures. So far, various porphyrin assemblies such as particles, tubes and rods have been reported.23,37–57
In recent years, major research efforts have been devoted to the investigation of the physical and chemical properties of nanoscale carbon materials such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphenes with the intention of developing nanomaterial-based devices that could lead future technologies.15,58–77 Although the construction of molecular electronics and devices based on such π-electronic conjugation in cylindrical, spherical and sheet-like structures has already been attempted, new design strategies and approaches are continuously sought to tailor their performance. The increasing demand for clean energy in recent years has motivated researchers to design the next generation of solar cells and electronic devices using nanocarbon materials.78,79
As stated above, carbon nanotubes prepared using various synthetic strategies are useful in nanodevices as they exhibit unusual electronic and optical properties. On the other hand, graphene is also a two-dimensional (2-D) nanomaterial consisting of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which are analogous to unrolled 2-D carbon nanotubes, forming a one-atom thick honeycomb lattice.80,81 They are individual sheets separated from the large, stacked-sheet structure of graphite.82,83 Because of its unique structure and electronic properties, graphene has drawn the attention of scientists for electronic applications in recent years.84–86 Moreover, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) constitute a class of molecules whose members are formed by condensing benzenoid units. The first member of this particular series is benzene, while graphene may be seen as the ultimate member. In between, there exist PAH molecules having disk-shaped structures such as triphenylenes.87,88
A promising approach for light energy conversion is the design of a sophisticated charge-separation system. Covalent linkages (or surface modification), as well as the supramolecular organization of these carbon nanomaterials with organic dyes such as porphyrins, is a useful way to improve the initial light-harvesting and subsequent electron-transfer process.69,89–91
Therefore, in this perspective, the focus is on recent advances in the photo- and electro-functional supramolecular materials of porphyrins for light energy conversion and electronics. The synthesis, structural, photophysical and energy conversion properties are widely discussed.
2 Supramolecular rods and fibers of porphyrins
2.1 Sonication-assisted porphyrin nanorods
Ultrasonics are often utilized for the formation of crystal nuclei and growth in the preparation of molecular crystals; however, they seldom favor the formation of an ordered assembly. We have constructed novel supramolecular nanorods and fibers controlled by intermolecular interactions such as π–π stacking interactions of porphyrins without the other bonds/interactions or aiding surfactants, which are prepared in sonicated solution media.92
The porphyrin nanorod was prepared by the following procedure. First, 3.5 mM 5,15-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)porphyrin H2P solution was prepared in toluene. Then, the toluene solution was mixed with a 9-fold excess of acetonitrile (final concentration: 0.35 mM in a poor/good solvent = 9:1 v/v). The solution was sonicated (45 kHz) for 30 min at 15 °C to form macroscopic self-assembled porphyrins such as rod-like structures by using our original set-up. To check the substituent effect of the porphyrin ring on the macroscopic aggregate structures, a reference porphyrin, 5,10,15,20-tetra(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)porphyrin [H2P(tBu)4], was also employed.

Fig. 1A–D show the TEM images of H2P nanorods and the reference H2P(tBu)4 assembly, and the fluorecence images of H2P nanorods and H2P fibers, respectively. In contrast with the large square crystal structures (2–3 μm scale) of the H2P(tBu)4 assembly (Fig. 1B), H2P nanorods (Fig. 1A) form a number of long bar shaped-structures. The H2P nanorods are 360 ± 130 nm in diameter and 5.02 ± 1.94 μm in length. The fluorescence image data of the H2P nanorods also clearly show similar assemblies with uniform luminous structures (Fig. 1C). To construct much longer fiber structures, the suspended solution of nanorods was further allowed to stand for 6 days. Then, the crystallized porphyrins were stirred for 5 min at room temperature. The nanorod crystals finally grew to longer fiber structures. In Fig. 1D, we can clearly see much longer fiber structures analyzed as being 890 ± 270 nm in diameter and 27.2 ± 6.9 μm in length. In the formation of fiber structures, a large increase of length from 5.0 to 27.2 μm (∼6 times) relative to that of diameter (∼2 times) indicates that anisotropic crystal growth largely occurs toward the length direction. Thus, we have successfully controlled the structures of pophyrin fibrous assemblies within a certain definite range. This trend is also observed between 5,15-diphenyl-porphyrin and 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-porphyrin. Additionally, the internal structures of the self-assembled porphyrins are investigated by XRD analysis. We can observe strong diffraction peaks of the a and c axes such as (100) and (002) in the unit cell, whereas the diffraction intensity based on the b axis is very weak. Considering the unit cell structure (monoclinic structure: dihedral angles 90° in axes a–b and b–c), growth direction of the rod-crystals may be along the b axis direction.92

In Fig. 2A, the absorption spectrum of H2P nanorods (spectrum a) exhibits a much broader and more intense absorption in the visible and near infrared regions than that of the corresponding simple drop-cast film prepared by H2P in toluene (spectrum b) and toluene solution (spectrum c). This drastic change in absorption characteristics is likely because of strong supramolecular π–π interactions between a porphyrin and its nearest neighbor in nanorod structures.

To further check the photoresponse behavior, we constructed a photoelectrochemical solar cell composed of a H2P(tBu)2 nanorod-modified optically transparent electrode (denoted as OTE/SnO2/H2P-rod) prepared by drop-casting. The photoelectrochemical performance of the OTE/H2P-rod was measured in a standard two-compartment electrolyte cell.67 Photoexcitation of the porphyrin film electrode assembly in a photoelectrochemical cell with visible light produces relatively high photocurrent generation. The incident photon-to-photocurrent generation efficiency (IPCE) was calculated by normalizing the photocurrent values for incident light energy and intensity using eqn (1).93 IPCE (%) = 100 × 1240 × Isc/(Win × λ)(1)where Isc is the short circuit photocurrent (A cm−2), Win is the incident light intensity (W cm−2), and λ is the wavelength (nm). The IPCE spectrum (spectrum a in Fig. 2B) also shows a broad photoresponse in the visible region (maximum IPCE: ∼5.5% at 460 nm),92 which parallels the corresponding absorption (spectrum a in Fig. 2A) and excitation spectra (spectrum b in Fig. 2B). These experiments confirmed the role of H2P nanorod towards harvesting light energy and generating photocurrent during the operation of a photoelectrochemical cell.
2.2 Metal coordination-assisted supramolecular architectures
In the above section, the driving force for supramolecular formation is mainly a single interaction such as π–π interaction. In addition to the utilization of π–π interactions, one of the useful methods for controlling the organized structures is to employ coordination bonding such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) since we can design a topology network of internal structures with metal ions and organic ligands.94,95
The porphyrin assemblies are synthesized by the following method. Briefly, first, the solutions of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(4-carboxyphynyl)-21,23H-porphyrin (H2TCPP, Fig. 3A) were prepared at three appropriate concentrations (52.5, 105 and 420 μM) in mixed solvent (DMF/dioxane/H2O = 4:1:1, v/v/v). Then, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (2.0 equiv.) was added to the porphyrin solution. The solution was stirred for 3 h at 100 °C to form the aggregate structures. Finally, after centrifugation and washing, H2TCPP assemblies are very stable in DMF. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to examine the sizes and shapes of these porphyrin self-assemblies as shown in Fig. 3B–D. In the case of low concentration (52.5 μM), the H2TCPP assembly shows cubic structures (Fig. 3B), whereas longer bar-shaped structures with high aspect ratios (i.e., rods) are observed with increasing the concentration of H2TCPP (Fig. 3C and D). To perform the quantitative discussion about structural sizes of these H2TCPP assemblies, we calculated several hundred samples, respectively, and the analyzed data are summarized in Table 1. The low concentration condition provides the nanoscale cubic formations with ca. 40–50 nm size (Fig. 3B). In contrast, a large increase of length direction from 50 nm to 2.5 μm (50-fold increase) relative to that of width from 37 to 190 nm (5-fold increase) is observed (Fig. 1C and D). This indicates that the anisotropic structural growth largely occurs along the length direction. Thus, the aspect ratios have been successfully controlled in the range of ca. 1 to 14 (Table 1).

The possible organization process of H2TCPP assemblies is summarized in Fig. 4. The initial process is the planar checkerboard patterned formation of H2TCPP organized by paddle-wheel complexes between carboxylate and zinc ions, which is followed by the subsequent stacking formation of the checkerboard units. In this case, with increasing concentrations of H2TCPP in the parent solution, the stacking formation of planar units becomes accelerated and grows into H2TCPP rod-like assemblies with high aspect ratios. The results of XRD and the infrared absorption (IR) spectra also support the stacking formation of H2TCPP.96 Additionally, the lifetimes of triplet excited states of H2TCPP assemblies with paddle-wheel complexes [0.59 μs (66%), 4.2 μs (34%)] are more than 20 times larger than that of our reported 100 nm-sized H2TCPP self-assembled nanoparticles organized by relatively weak π–π interactions and hydrogen bonding (26 ns).97 Therefore, such organic nanocrystals combined with a MOF strategy could pave a new way for developing novel organic–inorganic hybrid materials for light energy conversion and electronics.

2.3 Fullerene-encapsulated porphyrin nanorods
Recent attention has been drawn to develop inexpensive renewable energy sources. New approaches for the production of efficient and low-cost organic solar cells are necessary for the future development of next generation devices. The fundamental photovoltaic mechanism is (i) light-harvest and exciton diffusion, (ii) charge-separation for carrier generation, and (iii) carrier transport.15,24,26,98 A bar-shaped structure composed of two different molecules with separated inside and outside layers is a good candidate for the photovoltaic application since these processes are simultaneously and continuously performed within the molecular assembly. Therefore, we have succeeded in constructing new molecular composites: fullerene-encapsulated porphyrin hexagonal nanorods composed of zinc meso-tetra(4-pyridyl) porphyrin [ZnP(Py)4] and fullerene derivatives [denoted as fullerene-ZnP(Py)4 nanorod], which are prepared by aiding surfactant: cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in a DMF/acetonitrile mixed solvent (Fig. 5).99,100
 Fig. 5  An illustration of fullerene nanoparticle-promoted organization of ZnP(Py)4 nanorods. CTAB is omitted for clarity. The electron micrographs show (A) immediate formations of C60tBu and ZnP(Py)4 composites (1 min) after injection, (B) hexagonal C60–ZnP(Py)4 rod, and (C) distorted polygonal C60tBu–ZnP(Py)4 rod.99 
The preparation method is as follows. A mixed proper ratio of ZnP(Py)4 and fullerene derivatives in DMF solution (starting monomer) was injected into a 7.5-fold excess of continuously stirred 0.20 mM CTAB acetonitrile solution at room temperature. The final concentrations of ZnP(Py)4 and fullerene derivatives are 0.03 and 0.02 mM in DMF/acetonitrile (2:15, v/v), respectively. On injecting, they largely form ZnP(Py)4 flake assemblies and fullerene-based nanoparticles, separately (Fig. 5). With an increase in the bulkiness of the substituent groups of the fullerene derivatives, the average diameters increased from 15 to 80 nm (Table 2). In ZnP(Py)4 assemblies, with the diffusion of DMF into acetonitrile, the Zn–N axial coordination of pyridyl N-atoms to zinc atoms of ZnP(Py)4 promotes the growth of aggregates, which continue to grow into a flake-like structure. In this case, the organization process of ZnP(Py)4 moieties is initially derived from coordination bonding in contrast with C60 assemblies based on relatively weak π–π interactions. Then, fullerene-ZnP(Py)4 nanorods are finally formed (Fig. 5B and C). In scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, ZnP(Py)4 pristine hexagonal nanotubes with large hollow structures (denoted as ZnP(Py)4 tube) are observed, whereas the hollow hole is completely closed in the case of nanorods composed of fullerenes (C60 and C70) and ZnP(Py)4 (fullerene-ZnP(Py)4 rod).99,100 In the C60 derivative-ZnP(Py)4 rods, distorted polygonal columnar structures with large diameter and length are formed, as compared to the hexagonal structures of C60–ZnP(Py)4 and C70–ZnP(Py)4 rods. The reference ZnP(Py)4 hexagonal nanotube without C60 was also prepared in the same manner for comparison (denoted as ZnP(Py)4 tube).

ZnP(Py)4 tube shows a bar-like structure with a large hollow hole, whereas the hole is completely closed in C60–ZnP(Py)4 rods (Fig. 5B). C60–ZnP(Py)4 nanorods are analyzed as 4.12 ± 0.94 μm in length and 490 ± 90 nm in outside diameter by SEM images. As compared to ZnP(Py)4 tubes analyzed as 2.13 ± 0.27 μm in length and 540 ± 30 nm in outside diameter, a large increase of length direction from 2.13 to 4.12 μm relative to unchanged diameters (∼500 nm) indicates that anisotropic crystal growth largely occurs toward the length direction due to π–π interaction of encapsulated C60 moieties within ZnP(Py)4 assembly.99,100 Moreover, in the case of C60 derivatives, the increased sizes of bar-shaped structures are in good agreement with the trend of fullerene nanoparticles (Table 2). This indicates that an encapsulated process of fullerene assemblies by ZnP(Py)4 flake assemblies plays an important role in the final structural organization.
The absorption spectrum of fullerene-ZnP(Py)4 rod exhibits much broader and more intense absorptions in the visible and near-infrared regions than those of the corresponding monomers: ZnP(Py)4 or C60 in DMF because of aggregated interactions (Fig. 6A). Such a broad absorption characteristic is useful for solar energy conversion.

Electrolyte 0.5 M LiI and 0.01 M I2 in acetonitrile.99 
The picosecond fluorescence lifetime and nanosecond transient absorption measurements of fullerene-ZnP(Py)4 rod suggest the efficient quenching of the singlet excited state by C60 moiety because of photoinduced electron transfer (PET), which is in sharp contrast with PET via3ZnP(Py)4* in reference non-organized system prepared without CTAB.100 In the transient absorption spectrum of C70–ZnP(Py)4 rod at 0.1 μs, the broad peak observed at 500–780 nm can be attributed to the radical cation of ZnP(Py)4, [ZnP˙+(Py)4] moieties. The inset time profile in Fig. 6B shows the rapid decay of the C70˙− at 1380 nm. This indicates that the charge separation process takes place via the 1Zn(Py)4* moiety. Thus, the formation of a charge-separation state, C70˙−–ZnP˙+(Py)4, in the nanorods was suggested by the transient bands. The decay rates of the transient absorption bands can be attributed to charge recombination, after the formation of the charge separation state, C70˙−–ZnP˙+(Py)4. In the case of C60–ZnP(Py)4 rod, C60Ph–ZnP(Py)4 rod, and C60tBu–ZnP(Py)4 rod, the radical anion appears at 1080 or 1020 nm, respectively. The forward and back electron-transfer rate constants are largely dependent on the structures of the nanorods.99
The photocurrent action spectrum of OTE/SnO2/fullerene-ZnP(Py)4-nanorod shows a broad photoresponse in the visible region, and the maximum IPCE (∼35%) is much larger than the sum of the two individual IPCE values (∼6.5%) of OTE/SnO2/ZnP(Py)4-tube and OTE/C60-assembly under the same conditions.99,100 These results clearly indicate that an organized structure between C60 and ZnP(Py)4 as well as an excellent electron acceptor property of C60 plays an important role for the improvement of the light energy conversion properties.
Photocurrent generation in the present system may be initiated by photoinduced charge-separation from 1ZnP(Py)4* (1ZnP*/ZnP˙+ = −1.0 V vs. NHE)93 to C60 (C60/C60˙− = −0.2 V vs. NHE)93 in ZnP(Py)4–C60 rather than direct electron injection into the conduction band of SnO2 (0 V vs. NHE).93 The reduced C60 injects electrons into the SnO2 nanocrystallites, whereas the oxidized porphyrin (ZnP/ZnP˙+ = 1.0 V vs. NHE)93 undergoes the electron transfer reduction with the iodide ion (I3−/I− = 0.5 V vs. NHE).93
3 Supramolecular formation composed of porphyrins and carbon nanotubes
3.1 SWCNT-driven aggregation of protonated porphyrins
Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) can provide an ideal network to promote charge transfer with dye molecules and transport electrons to the collecting surface (e.g., photovoltaic cells) because of the π-conjugated cylinder structure. On the other hand, protonated porphyrins provide a convenient way to construct ordered molecular assemblies.56,101,102 Therefore, we have prepared novel SWCNTs driven aggregation of protonated porphyrins to produce supramolecular assemblies in the form of macroscopic bundles (Fig. 7).103
 Fig. 7  An illustration of a supramolecular assembly between protonated porphyrins (H4P2+) and single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their application to phoelectrochemical cells in this study.103,104 
The general strategy and procedure of constructing a supramolecular assembly between 5,15-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)porphyrin (H2P) and SWCNTs is shown in Fig. 7.103 First, 1 mg purified SWCNTs were added to 0.2 mM solution of porphyrin in THF containing 1.0% H2SO4 (v/v). The suspension was sonicated for 1 h at room temperature, which was followed by centrifugation of the suspension for 30 min at 10000 rpm to separate the SWCNT–H4P2+ composite. The solid was resuspended in acidified THF with sonication (1 h) and centrifuged again to wash out any unbound porphyrin. The first step involves binding of H2P on the surface of SWCNTs, which is followed by van der Waal's interactions to form aligned macroscopic rods. The protonated form of H2P (H4P2+) and SWCNT composites forms 0.5–3.0 μm sized rod-like structures.
These rod-assemblies can be assembled onto nanostructured SnO2 films (OTE/SnO2) using an electrophoretic deposition method. These organized assemblies are photoactive and absorb strongly in the entire visible region. Then, we have also constructed the photoelectrochemical solar cell in the electrolyte. In the present study, we employed I3−/I− redox couple to regenerate the sensitizer. Photocurrent measurements were performed in a standard three-compartment cell as a working electrode along with Pt wire gauze counter electrode and saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE).
The charge separation in the OTE/SnO2/SWCNTs–H4P2+ electrode assembly can be further modulated by the application of an electrochemical bias. Fig. 8A shows current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the OTE/SnO2/SWCNTs–H4P2+ electrode under visible light illumination. The photocurrent increases as the applied potential is scanned towards positive potentials. Increased charge separation and the facile transport of charge carriers under positive bias are responsible for enhanced photocurrent generation.104 At potentials greater than +0.3 V vs. SCE direct electrochemical oxidation of iodide interferes with the photocurrent measurement. Furthermore, the IPCE were calculated by normalizing the photocurrent values. The IPCE of OTE/SnO2/SWCNTs–H4P2+ is ∼13% under an applied potential of 0.2 V vs. SCE (Fig. 8B).104 This value is much larger than those of the respective single component systems (i.e., SWCNTs or H4P2+). Thus, the dual role of SWCNTs in promoting photoinduced charge separation and facilitating charge transport is presented.

3.2 Photoinduced electron transfer between porphyrins and semiconducting SWCNT having different band gaps
The SWCNTs consist of graphitic layers wrapped seamlessly into cylinders that originate from defined sections of two-dimensional graphene sheets. The structure of SWCNTs relates to a pair of indices (n,m) referring to their diameter and chirality. SWCNTs are semiconducting except for those in which the difference between n and m is a multiple of 3, which are metallic. Recent efforts involving non-covalent chemical functionalization and physical techniques have resulted in the separation of metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs according their (n,m) index.62,105–107
So far, various elegant covalently linked and non-covalently assembled donor–acceptor hybrids containing SWCNTs have been reported. However, all of these studies used a mixture of SWCNTs having both metallic as well as semiconducting properties with different (n,m) indices, making it impossible to derive meaningful and conclusive structure–reactivity relationships. In the present study, we have overcome this barrier by constructing donor–acceptor hybrids made out of semiconducting SWCNTs of largely a single (n,m) index type, that is, two types of semiconducting nanotubes, viz., (6,5) and (7,6) having different band gaps (difference up to 0.1 eV) have been utilized.108
First, zinc porphyrin was covalently functionalized to possess four pyrene entities [ZnP(pyr)4] as shown in Fig. 9. Exfoliation of the semi-conducting nanotube bundles occurred due to π–π type interactions with the pyrene and porphyrin entities in organic solvents. The nanohybrids thus formed were isolated and characterized by TEM, UV-visible-near IR, and Raman spectroscopy. Free-energy calculations suggested the possibility of electron transfer in both the (7,6)- and (6,5)-possessing ZnP(pyr)4/SWCNT nanohybrids. Accordingly, fluorescence studies revealed efficient quenching of the singlet excited state of ZnP in the nanohybrids, originating from the charge separation as confirmed by detection of the ZnP π-cation radical in the transient absorption spectra. The rates of charge separation (i.e., forward electron transfer) were found to be slightly higher for (7,6)-SWCNT derived hybrids as compared to the (6,5)-SWCNT derived hybrids. The charge recombination revealed an opposite effect indicating that the (7,6)-SWCNTs are slightly better for charge stabilization compared to the (6,5)-SWCNTs. The present nanohybrids were further utilized to photochemically reduce a hexyl viologen dication in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor in an electron-pooling experiment, offering additional proof for the occurrence of photoinduced charge-separation and the potential utilization of these materials in energy conversion applications.

The photocurrent action spectra of OTE/SnO2/ZnP(pyr)4/SWCNT electrodes were measured by examining the wavelength dependence of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). The IPCE values are calculated by normalizing the photocurrent densities for incident light energy and intensity in the usual manner. The IPCE of the OTE/SnO2/ZnP(pyr)4/SWCNT(7,6) electrode reaches 1% as a maximal value at 420 nm with the second maximum near 460 nm, which is about 3 times larger than that of the OTE/SnO2/ZnP(pyr)4/SWCNT(6,5) electrode (0.35%).
3.3 Supramolecular assemblies composed of porphyrins and stacked-cup carbon nanotubes
Stacked-cup carbon nanotubes (SCCNTs) are a new class of carbon nanostructures that differ significantly in morphology compared to other carbon nanostructures.109–112 Whereas conventional CNTs are made up of seamless cylinders in a hexagonal carbon network, the cup-stacked structure provides a hollow tubular morphology (Fig. 10). This stacked-cup morphology provides a large portion of exposed and reactive edges in the outer and inner surfaces of the hollow tubes. The availability of the inner and outer edges of these stacked-cups for chemical functionalization or surface modification opens up new avenues to utilize them in electronic and catalytic applications.110 Upon ball-milling, the longer stacked cups can be broken into smaller stacked cups which further increases the number of accessible active sites.111

SCCNTs can be readily suspended in organic solvents such as THF using sonication for 30–60 min. The SCCNT remained suspended in THF for more than 24 h. We adopted an electrophoretic deposition method to cast the films of SCCNT on conducting glass electrodes (OTE/SnO2). A photoelectrochemical cell consisting of OTE/SnO2/SCCNT and a Pt counter-electrode was constructed and the generation of photovoltage and photocurrent in the presence of a I3−/I− redox couple were recorded. These SCCNT films on OTE/SnO2 undergo charge separation and deliver a photocurrent under visible light irradiation. A maximum IPCE of 17% at +0.2 V vs. SCE is much larger than those reported for pristine carbon nanostructures.113 For example, C60 films exhibit a maximum IPCE of ∼5% and SWCNT films exhibit a maximum IPCE of less than 0.2% (Fig. 11). In the measurement of I–V characteristics of the OTE/SnO2/SCCNT electrode using a three-electrode system, the increased photocurrent generation at anodic potentials shows that the SCCNT films possess n-type semiconducting behavior.113

Moreover, molecular assemblies composed of SCCNT and 5,15-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)porphyrin (H2P) prepared in acetonitrile/toluene (5:1, v/v) were deposited as three-dimensional arrays onto nanostructured SnO2 films to further improve the photoelectrochemical response in the visible light region. The composite electrode of SCCNT-H2P (OTE/SnO2/SCCNT-H2P) exhibits an IPCE of 32% under an applied potential of 0.2 V vs. SCE (Fig. 12).114 The observed increase in IPCE is greater than that of the additive effects observed from the single component systems (viz., OTE/SnO2/SCCNT or OTE/SnO2/H2P).

3.4 Porphyrins and carbon nanohorns composites
Carbon nanohorns (CNHs), a nanostructured graphene-based material within the family of SWCNTs, are receiving great attention, particularly due to their unique morphology and unusually high purity.115–117 CNHs have a tubular form with a diameter of 2–5 nm and a length of 40–50 nm with a conical end. CNHs form a secondary aggregate having dahlia flower-like spherical morphology with an aggregate diameter of 80–100 nm. The absence of transition metal catalyst during production (i.e., CO2 laser ablation of a graphite pole, at room temperature under noble gas conditions), greatly differentiates them from conventional carbon nanotubes. In this study, CNHs covalently functionalized at the conical tips with porphyrin moieties were used to construct photoelectrochemical solar cells (Fig. 13).118 Electrophoretic deposition was also applied to fabricate films of the modified CNHs onto OTE/SnO2. The CNH–H2P film on the nanostructured SnO2 electrode exhibited an IPCE of 5.8% at an applied bias of +0.2 V vs. SCE in a standard three-compartment electrochemical cell.119 The measured IPCE was found greater than the one observed for the sum of the single components, namely CNHs and porphyrin films. Fluorescence lifetime measurements revealed that photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of the porphyrin to the CNHs takes place while direct electron injection from the reduced CNHs to the conduction band of the SnO2 electrode occurs.119 These processes are responsible for the photocurrent generation.
 Fig. 13  A chemical structure of carbon nanohorns and porphyrin composites (CNH–H2P).119 
We also synthesized CNHs and porphyrin dimer composites [CNH–(H2P)2] for enhancement of the light energy conversion properties.120 The maximal IPCE value of 9.6% at 430 nm was observed for OTE/SnO2/CNH–(H2P)2 whereas that for OTE/SnO2/(H2P)2 was significantly smaller (3.9% at 430 nm). These results and photophysical data suggest that the process responsible for the photocurrent generation includes electron-transfer from 1[(H2P)2]* to CNHs, followed by electron mediation from the reduced nanohorns to the conduction band of the SnO2 electrode. Here, it is worth mentioning that CNH–H2P (Fig. 13) shows an IPCE value of only 2.7% without applying any bias potential (two-electrode system). Thus, the dimeric porphyrin (H2P)2 covalently grafted onto CNHs, as shown in the present study, has an enhancing effect on the IPCE value. For such an enhancement, the following two factors may be crucial: (i) the higher molar absorption of dimeric porphyrin as compared with the monomeric one, and (ii) the higher loading of porphyrin units onto CNHs based on the TGA results.120
Furthermore, we recently reported a supramolecular assembly of zinc porphyrin–carbon nanohorns (CNHs), which was constructed in a polar solvent.121 An ammonium cation was covalently connected to the CNH through a spacer (sp) (CNH-sp-NH3+) and bound to a crown ether linked to a zinc porphyrin (Crown-ZnP) as shown in Fig. 14. In the similar photovoltaic measurement, the maximum IPCE value (9%) obtained for the OTE/SnO2/CNH-sp-NH3+;Crown-ZnP electrode is comparable to that of the covalently grafted porphyrin to CNHs.119 Even by comparison with the covalently linked porphyrin to the SWCNT, the obtained IPCE value for CNH-sp-NH3+;Crown-ZnP is comparable or better.122 These results clearly demonstrate that photoinduced electron transfer processes in the CNH-sp-NH3+;Crown-ZnP hybrid possess light-energy conversion ability, supporting considerably high potentials for applications in photovoltaic devices.

4 Graphene-based porphyrin nanoarchitectures
4.1 Graphene-porphyrin composites
Graphene-based materials hold strong potential for practical applications such as nanoelectronics,123 energy-storage,124 energy conversion,65 polymer composites,125,126 and biosensors.127 A major obstacle towards the realization of these applications is the preparation of single-layer graphene and its insolubility, with the latter being responsible for poor handling and manipulation during processing. Therefore, in this work, the successful covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) with 5-(4-aminophenyl)-10,15,20-triphenyl-21,23H-porphyrin (H2PPh) is reported (Fig. 15).128
 Fig. 15  A schematic illustration for the GO with covalently linked porphyrins.128 
The resulted GO–H2PPh hybrid material forms stable dispersions in DMF and has been thoroughly characterized by spectroscopic (UV-vis and Raman etc.) and thermal (TGA) analysis. Microscopy techniques such as AFM and TEM have been employed to probe the morphological characteristics as well as to investigate the exfoliation of graphene sheets. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence emission studies have shown efficient fluorescence quenching, suggesting that photoinduced electron transfer occurs from the singlet excited state of the porphyrin moiety to the GO sheet. Photoexcitation resulted in the one-electron oxidation of the porphyrin with the simultaneous one-electron reduction of GO, yielding (GO)˙−–(H2PPh)˙+, as revealed by transient absorption measurements. The electrochemical redox potentials of the graphene–H2PPh composite materials were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulsed voltammetry (DPV) and the energy gap for the charge-separated state of (GO)˙−–(H2PPh)˙+ is calculated as 0.87 eV, while the negative free-energy change for the photoinduced charge-separation of GO–H2PPh has been evaluated to be −1.00 eV, which confirms the thermodynamically favorable formation of (GO)˙−–(H2PPh)˙+. Eventually, the GO–H2PPh hybrid materials have been deposited onto SnO2 electrodes, and the OTE/SnO2/GO–H2PPh electrode exhibited an IPCE of 1.3% in a standard photoelectrochemical cell.128
4.2 Triphenylene core-centered porphyrin hexamer for molecular patterning
The construction of complicated submicrometer-scaled patterns on surfaces serves as a basis for the fabrication of integrated circuits and MEMS etc.129–132 Aggregation or self-assembly of molecules on a surface can be a simple and versatile approach, if the simple physical processes such as dewetting are effectively combined with supramolecular techniques.53 Particularly, disc-like molecules (i.e., PAH derivatives) functionalized with alkyl groups such as triphenylene derivatives self-assemble into supramolecular columnar structures that organize into hexagonal and nematic phases because of the stacking π–π interactions.88,133,134 Therefore, such stacking interactions of PAH connected by dyes enables us to construct organized assemblies of dyes. A combination of triphenylenes and porphyrins has promising potentials for such aggregate formations and the light-driven functionalities such as energy/electron transfer.
First, a new series of triphenylene core-centered porphyrin hexamers with different alkyl chain lengths and the respective reference compounds was synthesized, as shown in Fig. 16.135,136 Then, by casting the toluene solutions of these porphyrin hexamers onto carbon-coated films, monolayered patterning structures (height: ca. 70–80 Å) with an average pitch of ca. 500 nm were systematically observed. The key role for patterning formation is the control of solute-substrate interaction based on dewetting process. These aggregate structures are in sharp contrast with the macroscopic bundle assemblies of the corresponding triphenylene references without porphyrin units.135 This indicates that porphyrin sites in a hexamer effectively suppress bundle formation. In particular, with increasing alkyl chain lengths between porphyrin and triphenylene units, highly aligned and ordered molecular patterns are formed. In the similar photoelectrochemical cell using electrolyte, a broad action spectrum and an efficient maximum IPCE (∼10%) are observed because of the aligned aggregation.135 Such a superstructure is promising for future applications such as molecular electronics.

5 Conclusions
In this perspective, recent developments of photo- and electro-functional molecular architectures of porphyrins were widely described. Utilization of supramolecular techniques enables us to effectively organize aggregate formations such as cubes, rods and fibers. In general aggregate formations (i.e., molecular crystals), the driving force is mainly dependent on a single interaction such as π–π interactions. Therefore, one of the strategies is the appropriate configuration of substituents in a porphyrin ring (monomer). Consequently, steric control leads to a macroscopic organization of molecular architectures with different morphologies. The other strategy is to employ cooperative and/or competitive effects between two different interactions. Namely, the introduction of new functional groups for additional intermolecular interactions (i.e., coordination bond) enables us to construct a high-order organization. Furthermore, we have constructed a rod-shaped assembly composed of two different molecules with separated inner fullerene and outer porphyrin layers. The organized structure is useful for photovoltaic applications since photovoltaic processes are simultaneously and continuously performed. The maximum IPCE is ∼35% because of efficient photoinduced electron transfer from singlet excited states of porphyrins to fullerenes.
In the case of carbon nanotubes, the π-conjugated cylinder structures can provide an ideal network to promote charge transfer with dye molecules and transport electrons to the collecting surface. However, compared to the fullerene derivative-based composite systems, the light energy conversion property is actually small. One of the reasons for the low energy conversion property may be due to the ultrafast relaxation of the excited states of CNTs.62,137 Therefore, further structural control of D–A composites for an ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer process and a stable charge-separated state is essential since CNTs possess an ideal fibrous structure for charge carrier transport.
The graphene-based molecular composites with porphyrins also demonstrate new potentials for light energy conversion and molecular electronics although the IPCE values are relatively small. Finally, in triphenylene core-centered porphyrin hexamers, highly sophisticated patterning structures are effectively formed. Although the number of reported systems is very limited to date, such supramolecular strategies combined with dewetting processes could lead to the construction of novel molecular electronics.
