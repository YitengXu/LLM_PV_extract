    , Accepted 9th February 2011First published on 7th March 2011AbstractPolycrystalline CuInS2 films were fabricated by sulfurization of electrodeposited Cu and In metallic precursor films in a Cu-rich composition at 520 °C in H2S (5% in Ar). Structural analyses revealed that the adherence of the thus-formed CuInS2 film to the Mo substrate was strongly dependent on heating profiles of the Cu/In bilayer film: a CuInS2 film with poor adherence having many crevices was formed when the Cu/In bilayer film was heated monotonously from room temperature to 520 °C in Ar within 25 min followed by sulfurization, whereas CuInS2 films with good adherence were obtained when the Cu/In films were pretreated at 110 °C in Ar for 10–60 min just before increasing the temperature up to 520 °C for sulfurization. It was also clarified that the CuInS2 film obtained without 110 °C pretreatment had pinholes inside the film, whereas the CuInS2 films formed after 110 °C pretreatment showed no notable pinholes. Photoelectrochemical responses of these CuInS2 films in an electrolyte solution containing Eu(III) indicated that the CuInS2 films obtained after 110 °C pretreatment had higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) values than those of films obtained without 110 °C pretreatment, mainly due to better adherence of 110 °C pretreated CuInS2 films to the Mo substrate than the CuInS2 film obtained without 110 °C pretreatment. The performance of solar cells with an Al:ZnO/Zn(S,O)/CdS/CuInS2/Mo structure also depended on the structural characteristics of the CuInS2 films, i.e., preliminary conversion efficiencies of ca. 5% were obtained for devices based on the CuInS2 films obtained after 110 °C pretreatment, whereas the device prepared by the CuInS2 film without 110 °C pretreatment showed the conversion efficiency less than 1.5%.
Introduction

        Chalcopyrite compounds of the I–III–VI2 family, specifically CuInSe2, CuGaSe2, CuInS2 and their mixed crystals, have been used in photoabsorber layers for solar cells. The sulfide analogue of CuInS2 has a favorable direct band gap energy of 1.5 eV,1 which closely matches the solar spectrum, and an absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1 (at 730–750 nm),2 which is about 10 times greater than that of CdTe.3 Moreover, CuInS2 is less toxic than its selenide analogues. Owing to these favorable properties, CuInS2 has been studied as one of the most promising candidates for photovoltaic applications, though its record energy conversion efficiency (12.5%)4 is much lower than that of the selenide analogue Cu(In,Ga)Se2, for which the current conversion efficiency achieved is more than 19%.5
A CuInS2 photoabsorber for efficient solar cells is usually prepared by sputtering of Cu and In metallic precursor films followed by sulfurization with either H2S or elemental sulfur.4,6,7 The two-stage process is rather simple compared to the fabrication of Cu(In,Ga)Se2, which requires sophisticated high-vacuum technologies such as co-evaporation8–10 and selenization.11–13 However, it should be further advantageous that reliable and efficient solar cells based on a CuInS2 absorber are prepared by non-vacuum processes instead of the expensive vacuum technique of sputtering. Therefore, various non-vacuum processes, such as spray pyrolysis14–17 and electrodeposition,18–24 have been proposed for fabrication of a CuInS2 film.

Electrodeposition is an attractive process for CuInS2 film fabrication because of its low equipment cost, negligible waste emissions and possible formation of a compact film for solar cell application. The simplest process for CuInS2 electrodeposition is the direct formation of a CuInS2 precursor film by using a bath containing the three elements.18,19 However, due to the specific electrochemical irreversibility of sulfur, different from selenium, there have been only a few reports on fabrication of one-step electrodeposited CuInS2 films, while there have been many reports on direct deposition of a selenide analogue (i.e., CuInSe2).25–32 For CuInS2 electrodeposition, therefore, a sequential route consisting of electrodeposition of a Cu/In bilayer followed by sulfurization has been studied.20–25 In this route, the sulfurization step is usually performed by using H2S gas or sulfur vapor in much the same way as the above-mentioned sputtering technique.
Regardless of the deposition technique of Cu and In metallic precursor layers, morphologies of resulting CuInS2 films after sulfurization depend strongly on sulfurization conditions. Common failures encountered with these CuInS2 films are formations of rough surfaces and voids. Due to its low melting point, In forms a droplet in the initial stage of the sulfurization step. This provides an inhomogeneous distribution of indium during sulfurization to form CuInS2, leading to the formation of a low-quality film. Studies on the sulfurization process have suggested that phase formation to form an intermetallic compound, Cu11In9, is important to avoid these structural faults.33–36 Hence, some research groups have employed two-step sulfurization, i.e., pretreatment of metallic precursors at temperatures ranging from 120 to 150 °C for several hours to form a Cu11In9 intermetallic compound and then sulfurization at around 450–550 °C.21–24
Apart from the significance of the Cu11In9 phase formation discussed in the literature, further examinations of the sulfurization step of an electrodeposited Cu/In bilayer have revealed some remarkable structural aspects of the resulting CuInS2 films, specifically at the interface of these films to the Mo back contact. In order to study these structural aspects related to solar cell properties, we examined the effects of time profiles for sulfurization of a Cu/In bilayer stacked by electrodeposition on physicochemical properties of the CuInS2/Mo interface.
Experimental
Preparation of CuInS2 films
Metallic layers of Cu and In were deposited successively on a molybdenum-coated soda-lime glass (Mo/glass, ca. 20 Ω per square) by using a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt wire as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode under potentiostatic control using a Hokuto Denko HSV-100 potentiostat–galvanostat. Prior to deposition, the Mo/glass substrate was precleaned by sonication in acetone, followed by immersion in 25 vol% ammonia solution for 5 min to remove the molybdenum oxide layer (MoOx) on the surface.37Cu deposition was performed at −0.4 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) in an aqueous solution containing 10 mmol dm−3CuSO4 and 10 mmol dm−3citric acid (pH 2.3). After the Cu layer deposition, an In layer was deposited on the Cu-covered Mo/glass at −0.8 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) in 12 mol dm−3 of aqueous InCl3 solution (pH 2.2). During the deposition of these metallic layers, the temperature of the deposition bath was kept at 24 ± 1 °C by immersing it in a thermostatted water bath. The amount of each metal deposited was estimated by the electric charge, which was monitored by using a Hokuto Denko HF-201A coulomb/ampere-hour meter. In the present study, electric charges of Cu and In depositions were fixed at 0.83 C cm−2 and 0.95 C cm−2, respectively, i.e., the composition ratio of Cu and In (Cu/In) in the Cu/In bilayer film was fixed at a Cu-rich composition (Cu/In = ca. 1.3) compared to the stoichiometric ratio of the final CuInS2 film.
The thus-obtained metallic precursor film was sulfurized to form a CuInS2 film using a three-step temperature profile as shown in Fig. 1. First, the precursor film was heated to 110 °C in Ar, and then heating at this temperature was continued for a certain period. In the second step, the film treated at 110 °C was heated to 520 °C in Ar using a heating ramp of 25 °C min−1. Finally, sulfurization of the film was performed by introduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S, 5% in Ar) at 520 °C for 10 min, and then the film was allowed to cool down to ambient temperature in Ar. In this study, we changed the duration of the 110 °C treatment in the first step from 0 to 60 min. Hence, precursor films after the 110 °C treatment and those after the 520 °C heating and CuInS2 films as obtained after sulfurization were labeled Cu/In110(duration of 110 °C treatment), Cu/In520(duration of 110 °C treatment) and CuInS2(duration of 110 °C treatment), respectively: for example, the CuInS2 film obtained after 110 °C treatment for 60 min was designated CuInS2(60).

Microscopic features of films during fabrication steps shown in Fig. 1 were observed using a Hitachi S-5000 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα, Ni filter). Atomic compositions of some of the CuInS2 films were analyzed by energy-diffuse X-ray (EDX) analysis using a Hitachi S-2250N EDX analyzer.
Photoelectrochemical and solar cell properties
Photoelectrochemical properties of CuInS2 films were measured in an aqueous solution containing 50 mmol dm−3Eu(NO3)3 as an electron scavenging electrolyte with pH adjusted to 4. A standard three-electrode configuration with a Pt counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pyrex electrolytic cell having a flat window were employed. Before the experiments, CuInS2 films as-obtained were etched by immersion in an aqueous KCN solution (10%) for 2 min to remove excess CuxS component. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of these films were measured at −0.8 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) under N2 using the lock-in technique. For these measurements, irradiation of the CuInS2 film was performed by chopping at 10 Hz of monochromatic light, which was obtained by passing light from a 300 W Xe lamp through a monochromator. The number of incident photons was determined by an OPHIR Orion Laser power meter equipped with a photodiode.
For evaluation of solar cell properties of CuInS2 films, the films were processed to form an Al:ZnO/Zn(S,O)/CdS/CIS/Mo/glass structure. On the CuInS2 films after removing the CuxS component by KCN etching, CdS and Zn(S,O) buffer layers were deposited successively by chemical bath deposition (CBD).32,38 An Al:ZnO window layer was then deposited on the top of the Zn(S,O) layer by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering.31 Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under simulated AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) and those under dark of thus-obtained solar cells were measured with a Bunkoh-Keiki CEP-015 photovoltaic measurement system.
Results and discussion
Structural and optical properties

Fig. 2 shows representative SEM micrographs of the electrodeposited Cu layer and Cu/In bilayer. A top view SEM image of the Cu layer shows that the film has a compact morphology with a small grain size of less than 1 μm as shown in Fig. 2a. After electrodeposition of In to form the Cu/In bilayer, the SEM image of the film surface showed an island-shaped morphology with many crevices between the grains (Fig. 2b). As can be seen in Fig. 2c and d, cross-sectional SEM images of the corresponding Cu/In bilayers indicate the formation of a condensed Cu bottom layer with a thickness of ca. 500 nm, while the upper In layer showed a very rough film, as expected from their surface morphologies. It should be noted that a thin In layer with a thickness of ca. 200 nm was also observed on the Cu layer when we observed the crevice part at high magnification (Fig. 2d), suggesting the entire coverage of the In layer over the Cu layer.

Fig. 3 shows XRD patterns of the as-deposited Cu/In bilayer and that heated at 110 °C in Ar for 10 min and 60 min (i.e., Cu/In110(10) and Cu/In110(60) samples, respectively). The XRD pattern of the as-deposited Cu/In bilayer film showed several diffraction peaks assignable to In and CuIn in addition to a strong reflection derived from the Mo substrate (Fig. 3a). It is known that the metallic In easily diffuses into metallic Cu and forms intermetallic compounds.39 Thus, a certain amount of the CuIn compound was formed after deposition of the Cu/In bilayer even at ambient temperature. The absence of any diffractions of Cu suggests a less crystalline nature of the Cu layer. As shown in Fig. 3b, the XRD pattern of the Cu/In110(10) sample shows disappearance of In reflections as well as complete formation of intermetallic compound phases of CuIn and CuIn2. When the 110 °C treatment in Ar was extended to 60 min, the Cu/In110(60) sample thus-obtained showed formation of a Cu11In9 phase, which is a thermally stable phase at a given temperature,40 from CuIn and excess Cu (Fig. 3c). Despite such structural changes in the Cu/In bilayer after the 110 °C treatment in Ar, top view SEM images of Cu/In110(10) and Cu/In110(60) samples presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†) did not show remakable differences compared to that of the as-deposited Cu/In bilayer, i.e., island-shaped morphologies remained for all samples regardless of structural changes by the 110 °C treatment. However, comparison of the cross-sectional SEM images of Cu/In110(10) and Cu/In110(60) samples shown in Fig. 4 with the cross-sectional SEM image of the as-deposited Cu/In bilayer (Fig. 2c) indicates appreciable interdiffusion between the bottom Cu layer and the upper In layer resulting in bluring at the boundary, as expected from the above-described XRD results.

For further investigation of the structural changes in the Cu/In bilayer, as-deposited Cu/In bilayer, Cu/In110(10), and Cu/In110(60) samples were further heated to 520 °C in Ar. As can be seen in Fig. S2 (ESI†), XRD patterns of all of the samples mainly show reflections of the Cu7In3 phase, though the intensities are low. Although there is no significant differrence between the XRD patterns of these samples, corresponding SEM images showed obvious differences in their morphologies as can be seen in Fig. 5. The Cu/In520(0) sample, the 520 °C heated sample obtained from the Cu/In bilayer without 110 °C treatment, showed no island morphology on its surface (Fig. 5a); instead, there were some voids over the entire surface. As shown in the cross-sectional SEM image of the sample (Fig. 5d), voids were also present inside the film and the interface between the film and the Mo substrate. Due to the presence of voids at the interface, the film also showed relatively poor adhesion. On the other hand, samples obtained after 110 °C treatments (i.e., Cu/In520(10) and Cu/In520(60) samples) had a dense film morphology without any voids (Fig. 5e and f), while traces of island morphologies were still observed on their surfaces, as shown in Fig. 5b and c. The fact that these films have smaller thicknesses (ca. 800 nm) than that of the Cu/In520(0) sample (more than 1 μm) strongly supports formation of compact films of Cu/In520(10) and Cu/In520(60) samples.

            SEM images of 520 °C-heated films obtained from (a, d) the as-deposited Cu/In bilayer and the Cu/In bilayer after 110 °C treatment for (b, e) 10 min and (c, f) 60 min: (a–c) top views and (d–f) cross-sectional views. 
At a given temperature, the bottom Cu layer in the Cu/In bilayer moves to the upper In layer as out-diffusion behavior. On the other hand, the top metallic In diffuses to the bottom Cu layer as in-diffusion behavior. When the temperature rises higher than the melting point of indium (156 °C), the as-deposited Cu/In bilayer without 110 °C heating forms a Cu(solid)/In(liquid) interface. Hence, the thermally stable Cu7In3 phase, which would appear at a temperature over 310 °C,41 is likely to be formed by the interdiffusion of solid Cu and liquid In. The formation of a smooth surface of the Cu/In520(0) sample (see Fig. 5a) strongly supports this hypothesis. On the other hand, Cu/In bilayers treated with 110 °C heating consist of a Cu layer and intermetallic compound (mainly Cu11In9) layers. Since the melting point of the Cu11In9 phase (310 °C)40 is much higher than that of In and since the present film includes excess Cu component, formation of the Cu7In3 phase occurs prior to the melting of the Cu11ln9 phase. The presence of traces of island morphologies on the surfaces of Cu/In520(10) and Cu/In520(60) films (Fig. 5c and e) is attributable to the reaction pathway based on the solid–solid interface. Although detailed reaction models have not yet been established, these different interface structures should result in modulation of the qualities of intermetallic compound films during the heat treatment.
Morphologies of films after sulfurization of Cu/In bilayers
The 520 °C heated samples were then sulfurized at 520 °C in H2S (5% in Ar) for 10 min to form a CuInS2 chalcopyrite phase. Fig. 6 shows XRD patterns of thus-obtained films obtained from the Cu/In bilayer without 110 °C treatment (CuInS2(0), Fig. 6a) and those with 110 °C treatment for 10 min (CuInS2(10), Fig. 6b) and 60 min (CuInS2(60), Fig. 6c). These films show typical diffraction peaks of (112), (004)/(200), (204)/(220), and (116)/(312) reflections that coincide with the CuInS2 crystal with a chalcopyrite structure (JCPDS 27-0159). It should be noted that there is no diffraction peak of the CuxS phase despite the use of Cu-rich bilayer films, indicating an amorphous nature of this component. The fact that all of the films have a slightly bluish gray color also suggests the presence of the CuxS component. By KCN etching, the binary Cu compound was dissolved out, as evidenced by disappearance of the bluish color of the film, whereas no alteration of diffraction peaks of these films occurred with this treatment (data not shown). Selective removal of the CuxS component was also confirmed by EDX analyses of the CuInS2(60) film before and after KCN etching, i.e., Cu/In/S composition ratio of the film changed from a Cu-rich composition (29/20/52) to an almost stoichiometric composition (24/25/51) after KCN etching treatment. Another point worth noting is that all of the films exhibit enhanced crystal growth with preferable (112) direction; peak intensity ratios of I(112)/I(204)/(220) of CuInS2(10) and CuInS2(60) films (ca. 1.8) are somewhat larger than that of the CuInS2(0) film (ca. 1.4). The (112) preferred orientation in the CuInS2 film is advantageous for efficient solar cell device fabrication because it can minimize lattice mismatch with the CdS buffer layer,42,43 suggesting that the CuInS2 films formed with 110 °C treatment are more suitable for solar cell application in view of crystal orientation than that obtained without 110 °C treatment.

Fig. 7 shows SEM images of CuInS2(0), CuInS2(10), and CuInS2(60) films after KCN etching. The top view SEM images indicate that these films consist of compact agglomerates of angular-shaped crystallites (Fig. 7a–c); there seems to be no appreciable difference between these images. Cross-sectional SEM images of the corresponding samples in Fig. 7d–f also show regularly shaped crystals with grain sizes of more than 1 μm. The surfaces of these films are rough; there are wide distributions of film thicknesses ranging from 1.2 to 1.7 μm. These rough surfaces would be beneficial for light absorption, whereas they should increase dark current when they are used as solar cells.
 Fig. 7  
            SEM images of CuInS2 films obtained from (a, d) the as-deposited Cu/In bilayer and the Cu/In bilayer after 110 °C treatment for (b, e) 10 min and (c, f) 60 min: (a–c) top views and (d–f) cross-sectional views. 
One of the most significant differences that appeared in the cross-sectional SEM images is adhesion to the bottom Mo substrate. The CuInS2(0) film showed specifically poor adhesion; crevices were frequently observed at the interface between the CuInS2 crystallites and the Mo substrate, as shown in Fig. 7d. On the other hand, CuInS2(10) and CuInS2(60) films showed relatively good adhesion to the Mo substrate (Fig. 7e and f). As mentioned above, there is a significant morphological difference between the 520 °C-treated samples fabricated without and with 110 °C treatment (see Fig. 5). Hence, different adherences between these CuInS2 films and the Mo substrate can be attributed to this difference, i.e., pretreatment at 110 °C is effective for achieving good adherence of the resulting CuInS2 film to the Mo substrate.
Photoelectrochemical and solar cell properties
Linear sweep voltammograms of CuInS2(0), CuInS2(10), and CuInS2(60) films after KCN etching measured in an aqueous Eu3+ solution indicated that all of the films gave cathodic photocurrents (Fig. S3, ESI†), i.e., these CuInS2 films behaved as p-type semiconductor electrodes. Fig. 8 shows EQE spectra of these CuInS2 films measured at −0.8 V (vs.Ag/AgCl). The EQE spectra of all of the films rise steeply at 850 nm, and the absence of an appreciable Urbach tail at longer wavelengths suggests small amounts of sub-gap states near the band edge in these CuInS2 films. These results suggest sufficient qualities of these CuInS2 films for photovoltaic applications. The CuInS2(60) film showed the highest EQE values in the whole wavelength region, while the CuInS2(0) film performed poorly. As discussed above, the relatively low EQE of the CuInS2(0) film is likely to be due to the poor adherence between the CuInS2(0) film and the Mo substrate, as shown in Fig. 7d, i.e., the presence of many crevices at the CuInS2/Mo interface induced a large series resistance to suppress efficient transports of carriers. In addition, smaller EQE values of the CuInS2(10) film than those of the CuInS2(60) film might be due to a relatively high internal resistance of the CuInS2(10) film caused by low carrier density compared to that of the CuInS2(60) film, though there is no significant structural difference between CuInS2(10) and CuInS2(60) films. Further investigations of the electric properties of these CuInS2 films are now in progress.

These CuInS2 films were obtained from (a) the as-deposited Cu/In bilayer and the Cu/In bilayer after 110 °C treatment for (b) 10 min and (c) 60 min. 
Solar cells with a device structure of Al:ZnO/Zn(S,O)/CdS/CuInS2/Mo (without an antireflection coating) were prepared by depositing CdS, Zn(S,O), and Al:ZnO layers on CuInS2(0), CuInS2(10), and CuInS2(60) films after KCN etching. Fig. 9 shows J–V curves of these devices under irradiation of AM1.5, together with their semi-logarithmic dark J–V characteristics. It is clear from the figure that all of the devices exhibited solar cell performance. Short-circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (η) of these cells were determined form the illuminated J–V curves; corresponding series resistance (Rs), shunt resistance (Rsh) and diode factor (n) were also calculated by using the dark J–V data.44 These cell parameters are summarized in Table 1. The solar cell made from the CuInS2(0) film showed low η compared to that of the other solar cells. The J–V characteristics of the device show poor electrical rectification with a significantly high Rs and a large n value. The high Rs should be mainly caused by a high interfacial resistance, due to many crevices between the CuInS2 film and the Mo substrate (see above). The high Rs not only resulted in a large drop in the FF value but also induced a decrease in JSC, i.e., the high Rs should be the dominant factor of its low cell performance. In addition to the faults, less (112) preferred orientation in the CuInS2(0) film might induce appreciable interfacial defects of the CuInS2(0)–CdS heterojunction (see above), leading to lowering of the VOC value.

As shown in Fig. 9b and c, solar cells based on the CuInS2(10) and CuInS2(60) films show relatively good rectification with low n values; their η achieved ca. 5%. Significant improvements of Jsc values compared to that of the cell based on the CuInS2(0) film are due to good adherences between the CuInS2 films and the Mo substrate, leading to relatively low Rss. Moreover, a good junction formation between these CuInS2 films and the upper CdS layer derived from preferable (112) orientations of the CuInS2 crystals led to larger VOC values than that of the cell based on the CuInS2(0) film. A slightly higher solar cell performance of the cell made from the CuInS2(60) film than that of the cell made from the CuInS2(10) film is likely to be due to its larger carrier density, as discussed above for photoelectrochemical studies. In addition, when compared to other high-quality devices reported in the literature,4 limiting factors of present devices are their significantly low FF values, as well as their moderate VOC and JSC values. Insufficiently low Rs would result in lowering FF and JSC, whereas the low Rshs of present devices should also reduce FF and VOC. These faults might be partly attributable to insufficient carrier densities of the present CuInS2 films. As mentioned above, moreover, rough surface morphologies of these films, leading to increase in interface areas of p–n heterojunctions to induce enhancement of dark currents, should also result in decreases in these parameters. Hence, surveys of alternative conditions that enable us to improve these properties are needed in order to realize a high η value of the present device.
Conclusions
We examined the effects of 110 °C heat treatment of an electrodeposited Cu/In precursor film in Ar prior to sulfurization at 520 °C in H2S (5% in Ar) on structural, photoelectrochmical, and solar cell properties of resulting CuInS2 films after the 520 °C sulfurization. We found that 110 °C treatment was important for the formation of a CuInS2 film with good adherence to the Mo substrate; the treatment also allowed the suppression of the formations of crevices and pinholes in the CuInS2 film. Solar cells fabricated from 110 °C-treated CuInS2 films showed relatively high η values (ca. 5%) compared to the cell based on the CuInS2 film obtained without 110 °C treatment (ca. 1.5%). Hence, we have clarified the effectiveness of pre-heating to make high-quality CuInS2 films suitable for solar cell applications from electrochemically stacked Cu and In layers. The electrochemical deposition that can be used to fabricate a high efficiency solar cell without using vacuum technologies would reform the existing processes for solar cell fabrications. However, electrochemical-based solar cells, including the cells fabricated in this study, require significant improvement of conversion efficiency by further understanding how to regulate film properties, such as carrier density and surface morphologies. Studies on these improvements are in progress in our laboratory. Moreover, while the materials used in the present study include typical rare In and toxic Cd elements, we think that basic knowledge can be applicable for making solar cells based on mass abundant and less-toxic elements.

The solar cell is expected to consist of three distinctive regimes: (1) a linear regime at reverse and low forward bias voltages where the current is limited by Rsh, (2) an exponential behavior at intermediate forward bias voltages where the current is controlled by the diode, and (3) a second linear regime at high forward bias voltages where the current is limited by Rs. Hence, Rsh, n, and Rs values were extracted from slopes of these three regions.
