Herein, by combining the core units of triphenylamine and carbazole with different peripheral groups, three small molecular HTMs termed TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM are designed and synthesized. The effects of the configuration of the core building block and the donating ability of the terminal group on the optical, electro-chemical and photovoltaic properties are systemically examined. The research results demonstrate that the material CZ-DF with a planar carbazole core unit and N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine as the terminal donor group shows the most suitable energy level and the highest hole mobility and conductivity among these three HTMs. Applied in PSCs, the CZ-DF based device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.5%, and can retain 79.5% of its the initial PCE after aging at 65 °C, 45–60% relative humidity (RH) in an air atmosphere.
Introduction
Recently, with the rapid progress of perovskite composition optimization, development of novel charge transport materials and interfacial modification technologies, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved unprecedented success in merely 15 years. At present, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a PSC has reached 25.8%, which is very close to that of commercial monocrystalline silicon solar cells.1–7 In PSCs, the hole transport material (HTM) sandwiched between a perovskite film and a metal electrode is vital for improving the PCE as well as the stability of the device.8–13 The ideal HTM should have a suitable energy level above the valence band (VB) maximum of the perovskite and high hole mobility to facilitate hole extraction and transport.14–16 In addition, good thermal and photochemical stabilities are also preferred for efficient HTMs.17–19
Up to now, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) featuring a spiro framework and four electron-rich arylamine substituents is still the most commonly used HTM in highly efficient PSCs.20–22 Unfortunately, the complex synthesis and purification process of the spirobifluorene central core make the cost of Spiro-OMeTAD extremely high, which significantly limits its future commercial application.5,10 To solve this problem, great efforts have been devoted to developing novel, low-cost alternative highly efficient HTMs for PSCs. It is worth noting that small molecular organic materials have become one of the most extensively studied HTMs because of their simple structure and easy synthesis route.23–26 Molecular engineering of central building blocks is proved to be an efficient way to develop low-cost and highly efficient HTMs. The propeller structured triphenylamine (TPA), butterfly-shaped phenothiazine (PTZ) and phenoxazine (POZ), planar structured carbazole (CZ), fluorene, pyrene, anthracene, etc. have been successfully explored as central units to construct HTMs, and various HTMs with excellent hole mobility and tunable energy levels have been reported.27–31 Besides the optimization of the central building block, the peripheral donor groups also play crucial roles in determining the properties and photovoltaic performance of corresponding HTMs.32–39 However, the effects of the planarity of the core building block together with the peripheral donor groups on the photovoltaic performance of HTMs haven’t been compared in detail. Revealing the impact of the planarity of the core building block and peripheral donor groups on the material properties will be favorable for better developing highly efficient HTMs.
In this study, by selecting triphenylamine and carbazole with different planarities, together with N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine and 4,4′-dimethoxy-diphenylamine with different electron donating abilities as the core building block and terminating donor groups, respectively, we designed and synthesized three new HTMs TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM. The detailed molecular structures of the newly developed HTMs are illustrated in Scheme 1. The effects of changes in the molecular geometry, which is caused by the different planarity of the core building block, on their properties and the photovoltaic performance are well investigated. The results revealed that compared with triphenylamine units with rotatable propeller configuration, the nearly planar rigid conjugated carbazole-based HTM exhibit better intramolecular π–π stacking in the film state, leading to better film quality and hole mobility. In addition, the N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine donor group with extended π-conjunction due to the introduction of peripheral fluorene groups is beneficial for the enhancement of hole mobility of the HTM. Correspondingly, when the HTM CZ-DF is applied in PSCs with (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 as the light harvesting material, a PCE of 21.5% is delivered, which is comparable with the reference HTM Spiro-OMeTAD based PSC, and even higher than the devices based on TPA-DF and CZ-DM. Moreover, the CZ-DF-based unencapsulated device also shows the best long-term stability among these reported HTMs, maintains 79.5% of the initial efficiency when stored in an air atmosphere (65 °C, relative humidity (RH) of 45–60%) for 1000 h.

Results and discussion
The straightforward synthetic routes of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM are shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed description is supplied in the ESI.† All HTMs have been fully characterized by 1H NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry. TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM can be facilely synthesized with a total yield of 62%, 53%, and 55%, respectively. According to the preparation routes and previously reported cost calculation model, the synthesis costs of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM were evaluated to be 12.50 $ per g, 13.03 $ per g and 10.00 $ per g (Table S1–S3, ESI†), respectively, which are much lower than that of the classical HTM Spiro-OMeTAD (57.07 $ per g). The newly developed HTMs are more cost-effective than Spiro-OMeTAD.

As shown in Fig. 1, we utilized density functional theory (DFT) to explore the effect of the central building block and peripheral donor groups on the configuration of HTMs. The results indicate that HTMs CZ-DF and CZ-DM with carbazole as the central building block exhibit better planar configuration compared with TPA-DF. This result means that the carbazole unit is more favorable for intramolecular π–π stacking in the film state, which will lead to higher hole mobility and conductivity. Based on the calculated results, it can also be found that the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM are all delocalized over the whole main molecular skeleton, whereas the charge distribution of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) is different from each other. Especially for CZ-DF, the LUMO moves towards the central donor group connected to the N of the carbazole ring, separating well from the HOMO, which is favorable for efficient charge extraction and transport.
 Fig. 1  DFT calculation results of HTMs TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM. 
We first studied the optical and electrochemical properties of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM by analysing the UV-vis absorption spectra, the fluorescence emission spectra, and the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of HTMs. The UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of HTMs TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM in solution are presented in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Compared with TPA-DF, the HTMs CZ-DF and CZ-DM show a blue shifted main absorption peak with a trailing weak absorption peak at 459 nm. In addition, with the introduction of N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine as the donor, the HTM CZ-DF shows a red-shifted and broader main absorption band than CZ-DM due to the extension of π conjunction. The redshifted light absorption of CZ-DF and CZ-DM relative to that of TPA-DF indicates that CZ-DF and CZ-DM have a larger degree of conjugation, which demonstrated that the carbazole core building block possibly leads to more extended intermolecular π–π stacking. Meanwhile, TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM exhibit weak absorbance in the visible region, therefore, they will not generate competitive absorption with perovskites in the visible region. Furthermore, according to the intersection points of UV-vis and emission spectra of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM, the bandgaps of these three HTMs are calculated to be 3.02 eV, 2.91 eV and 2.91 eV, respectively.

To check the energy levels of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM, we performed cyclic voltammetry measurements (CV) (Fig. 2b) for these HTMs. The HOMO levels of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM are calculated to be −4.86, −5.15 and −5.10 eV, respectively (Table 1). From the results, we can see that both the planarity of the core building block and the electron donating ability of the peripheral donor groups have a significant impact on the HOMO levels of the corresponding HTMs. The HTM TPA-DF shows a higher HOMO level than CZ-DF due to the stronger electron donating ability of triphenylamine than carbazole. For HTMs CZ-DM and CZ-DF, the more positive HOMO energy level of CZ-DM results from the stronger electron donating ability of peripheral donor groups. Thus, when CZ-DF with the HOMO energy level of −5.15 eV is used as the HTM in PSCs, less energy loss and higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) could be expected. According to the equation of ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg, the LUMO energy levels of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM were calculated to be −1.84, −2.24 and −2.19 eV, respectively. The values are all more positive than the conduction band (CB) of the perovskite (−4.15 eV), suggesting that the electron can be well blocked to ensure efficient charge transport and suppression of the charge recombination. Therefore, all these three HTMs TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM possess suitable energy levels for application in PSCs as HTMs, and the experimental data are consistent with the DFT calculation.
The hole mobility and conductivity of the HTMs are very important parameters to evaluate their potential for PSC applications. In this respect, the hole mobility of the TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM was determined by using the space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs) with a hole-only device of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au. As shown in Fig. 2c, the hole mobility of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM was extracted to be 3.01 × 10−4, 6.47 × 10−4, and 4.35 × 10−4 cm2 v−1 s−1, respectively. Clearly, the hole mobilities of CZ-DF and CZ-DM are slightly higher than that of TPA-DF. The conductivity of CZ-DF is calculated to be 9.31 × 10−4 S cm−1, which was higher than that of TPA-DF (2.26 × 10−4 S cm−1) and CZ-DM (3.89 × 10−4 S cm−1), as shown in Table 1. The higher hole mobility and hole conductivity could be attributed to the more planar configuration of carbazole-based HTMs. Moreover, the extension of π-conjunction of the peripheral donor group is also favorable for improving the hole mobility and hole conductivity.
Before application as HTMs in PSCs, the film formation properties and film morphologies of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The top views of hole transport layers are shown in Fig. 3, and it can be noted that the CZ-DF and CZ-DM films uniformly cover the top of the perovskite films, which is essential for restricting the direct contact of the perovskite and metal counter electrode that may lead to serious recombination. In contrast, the films of TPA-DF are loosened together with obvious pin-holes due to their twisted molecular structures. These pinholes will become the charge recombination center and the entry channels for moisture and oxygen, which would accelerate perovskite decomposition. From the AFM results, we found that with the cover of HTM films, the root mean square (RMS) roughness significantly decreases, and all samples show comparable RMS values, indicating all HTMs are conducive to interfacial contact with the metal electrode and hole transport.

To investigate the photovoltaic performance of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM as HTMs in PSCs, we prepared cell devices based on TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM with a device configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05/HTM/Au. The schematic device structure together with the energy-level alignment of PSC is shown in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding cross-sectional SEM image of the PSC containing CZ-DF as the HTM is shown in Fig. 4b, exhibiting well a layer-by-layer structure. The composition of the perovskite layer is (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05, and the thickness is around 800 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best devices employing TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM as HTMs under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G solar illumination are shown in Fig. 4c and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The HTM TPA-DF based device only obtained a PCE of 17.4%, with obvious lower open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc). The excessive energy loss between the CB of the perovskite and the HOMO of TPA-DF leads to a low Voc. The lower Jsc mainly results from the lower hole mobility of TPA-DF. With a more suitable energy level alignment and higher hole mobility and hole conductivity, the CZ-DF based PSCs achieved the highest PCE of 21.5% among these three HTMs, with a Voc of 1.15 V, a Jsc of 23.8 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 78.9%. Under the same conditions, the devices based on the CZ-DM and the reference HTM Spiro-OMeTAD showed PCEs of 19.4% and 20.6% (see Fig. S1, ESI†), respectively. These results indicate that CZ-DF could be a good alternative HTM of Spiro-OMeTAD in view of PCE and cost. From the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra represented in Fig. 4d, it can be observed that all devices exhibit excellent conversion efficiency from 300 to 820 nm. Due to the highest hole mobility of CZ-DF, the CZ-DF-based PSC showed the highest IPCE values in the long wavelength region, consistent with the highest Jsc obtained by the CZ-DF-based PSC. The integrated Jsc values are calculated to be 22.2, 23.9 and 23.3 mA cm−2 for TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM-based devices, respectively, which are consistent with the J–V data.

In order to further examine the hole extraction from the perovskite layer to the hole transporting layer (HTL) and the hole transport properties of these three HTMs, we performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5a, the perovskite film shows a strong fluorescence emission, while the original emission of the perovskite is obviously quenched after the deposition of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM on the top perovskite film. The sample containing CZ-DF as the HTM exhibits the highest quenching efficiency, indicating the most effective hole extraction and transport properties of CZ-DF among these HTMs. Furthermore, the PL decay lifetimes (τavg) of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM coated perovskite films were calculated to be 136.98, 64.53 and 72.06 ns, respectively (see Fig. 5b). The faster hole extraction rate for CZ-DF than that for other HTMs further confirmed that CZ-DF is more efficient in hole extraction and transport. This is consistent with the higher hole mobility and conductivity, and better matched energy level discussed above. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis results (Fig. 5c) show that the CZ-DF based device exhibits the largest recombination resistance (Rrec) and a smaller series resistance (Rs) than TPA-DF and CZ-DM, suggesting better restricted charge recombination at the perovskite/CZ-DF interface, which is consistent with the higher hole extraction and transport efficiency. The light-intensity dependency of Jsc (Fig. 5d) reveals that the CZ-DF based device shows an α value of 0.93, which is much closer to 1 than the devices using TPA-DF and CZ-DM as HTMs, further confirming the most efficient hole transport properties of CZ-DF.

We also evaluated the long-term stability of the unencapsulated PSCs containing TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM as HTMs in an ambient atmosphere (65 °C, relative humidity (RH) of 45–60%) and the test results are shown in Fig. 6. After 1000 h of aging, the PSC containing CZ-DF as the HTM retained 79.5% of the initial PCE. In stark contrast, the TPA-DF based PSC almost fully degraded, showing a poor PCE of 5.28%. Considering that the only difference is the HTM, the main reason for the different degradation trend is the different hydrophobic properties of HTMs. To confirm this, we measured the contact angle (θ) of TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM films coated on the perovskite (see Fig. 6b). It is found that the CZ-DF film showed the largest water contact angle of 96.99° among these three HTMs, suggesting better hydrophobic properties of CZ-DF than TPA-DF and CZ-DM. Therefore, the CZ-DF based device showed the best stability. Compared to TPA-DF and CZ-DM based PSCs, although CZ-DM was slightly less hydrophobic than TPA-DF, the CZ-DM based device exhibited better stability. The reason may be the more compact morphology of the CZ-DM film than that of TPA-DF, which can restrict well the contact of moisture with the perovskite.

In summary, in this work, we focus on developing alternative HTMs and three new HTMs TPA-DF, CZ-DF and CZ-DM were designed and synthesized by utilizing triphenylamine and carbazole-based derivatives as a core building block, together with N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine and 4,4′-dimethoxy-diphenylamine as terminating donor groups. The planar core building unit endows CZ-DF and CZ-DM with better intramolecular π–π stacking, leading to better film morphology and higher charge transport properties. Moreover, the lower electron donating ability of carbazole renders CZ-DF and CZ-DM much deeper HOMO levels, which is helpful to minimize the energy loss. Applied in PSCs, the HTM CZ-DF based device achieved a PCE of 21.5%, and the device retained 79.5% of the initial PCE after 1000 h of aging in an ambient atmosphere with 65 °C heating and 45–60% RH.
