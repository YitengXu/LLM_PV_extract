    , Accepted 26th June 2015First published on 26th June 2015AbstractIn recent years, the intensive development of π-conjugated small molecule acceptors has yielded viable alternatives to fullerene acceptors in state-of-the-art organic photovoltaic devices. Small molecule acceptors are designed to replicate the favourable electronic properties of fullerenes and to overcome their inherent optical and stability deficiencies. Concurrently, advances in device engineering through rigorous optimization have seen the development of intricate device architectures and led to impressive performance increases. This review highlights a number of recent high performance non-fullerene acceptors, focusing on the design of π-conjugated structures, device optimization and the ensuing power conversion efficiencies.
1. Introduction
Solution processed organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) have emerged as a promising clean energy generating technology due to their potential for low-cost manufacturing via printing or coating techniques.1–7 Traditionally, the field of OPVs has been dominated by the conjugated polymer–fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell;8–10 however, the use of soluble organic small molecules in place of both polymer and fullerene components in BHJ solar cells represents a promising alternative. The key advantages of molecular alternatives to fullerene acceptors are well-known,11–13 and this has led to a rise in the development of non-fullerene electron accepting small molecules. The deficiencies of fullerene acceptors are related to their cost, synthetic accessibility, poor light harvesting properties and photochemical stability in air. Further details pertaining to the history of fullerene acceptors and their small molecule alternatives have been reviewed in our previous work,14 and several other publications.15–20
Non-fullerene small molecule acceptors can be designed from low-cost building blocks, assembled through straightforward synthetic protocols, and easily purified, rather than the expensive and demanding synthesis of fullerene acceptors. In terms of material properties, small molecule acceptors have large extinction coefficients, providing acceptor domains with complementary light harvesting (to their respective donor components) in contrast to weakly absorbing fullerene acceptors. Considering the remarkable progress in the development of small molecule non-fullerene acceptors within the last year, a timely review of high performance non-fullerene acceptors is needed to keep up with their rapidly evolving development and guide researchers towards further improvements.
In the pursuit of new electron accepting materials, the deficiencies of fullerene acceptors are well known, but the reasons for which they remain excellent electron acceptors cannot be understated. Li et al. have recently summarized these characteristics.21 The electrochemical properties of fullerenes are highlighted by the existence of several low-lying excited states,22 providing a density of LUMO levels at similar energies, facilitating efficient charge separation without compromising charge recombination.23,24 Structurally, the large π-conjugated structure can efficiently delocalize electrons, and the rigidity facilitates aggregation into phase-separated morphologies ideal for charge separation and transport.25–28 The spherical three-dimensional structure is also an important feature, and can decrease the Coulombic barrier for charge separation while also inducing entropic effects to enable isotropic charge transport.29–32 It has been demonstrated that the tunability of small molecule acceptors can target the favourable properties of fullerene acceptors, and coupled with their aforementioned benefits, reach improved efficiencies.
Reviewed hereinafter are a collection of high performance non-fullerene acceptors that, when paired with appropriate donor materials, have led to the fabrication of solar cell devices with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 3.0% within the past year. Considering the favourable properties of fullerenes, the designs of these materials are generally focused on one or more of the following strategies: (1) electron deficient building blocks and extended π-conjugated frameworks to promote charge delocalization (2) dimeric or higher oligomeric structures to access a large density of states at the LUMO and (3) steric demand along the molecular backbone to enforce a non-planar geometry and target a blend morphology that is efficient for charge separation and transport.
In this review of recent high performance non-fullerene acceptors we hope to provide the reader with guidelines for the development of new fullerene alternatives based on current successful strategies. Foremost, it is evident that materials design is not the principal consideration for the development of non-fullerene acceptors, where donor selection, device engineering and active layer processing are equally important components to realizing high PCEs. In contrast to the development of donor materials, where common practice involves screening new materials with fullerene acceptors in standard device architecture to determine the best material for further optimization, there does not exist a standard procedure for evaluating non-fullerene acceptors. Therefore, we have organized this review to highlight the importance of appropriate donor selection, device engineering, and active layer processing conditions before engaging in the discussion pertaining to the design of new small molecule acceptors.
2. Device engineering
Accompanying the development of new materials, advances in device engineering have proven to be crucial to achieve high efficiencies. Beyond the choice of conventional or inverted device architecture, there are many intricate components to consider, including the interfacial layers, active layer blend thickness, ratios and processing, which includes solvent additives and post-deposition annealing techniques. These components of device engineering are summarized in the following section to emphasize the importance for rigorous device optimization to reach high efficiencies.
2.1 Architecture
High performance non-fullerene acceptor BHJ devices are generally built in one of two anode/BHJ/cathode architectures: the “conventional” architecture, in which the transparent conductive electrode coated substrate (generally indium tin oxide, ITO coated glass substrate) acts as the anode, collecting holes; and the “inverted” architecture, in which the transparent conductive electrode acts as the cathode, collecting electrons (Fig. 1). The inverted device architecture gained widespread attention relatively recently upon publication of the record breaking polymer–fullerene inverted device by He et al., one of the first examples of a system in which the BHJ inverted device outperformed the conventional device. The superior performance of the inverted device was attributed to improved optical absorption and the creation of an efficient charge-carrier collecting ohmic contact at the ITO cathode, produced by including poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) as an interlayer.33

High PCEs have been achieved by non-fullerene acceptor blend devices in both architectures, but several recent publications report that changing from the conventional to inverted structure can improve PCE. For example, Zhong et al. demonstrated that a 3:7 mass ratio blend of polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene (PTB7) polymer donor with a helical perylene diimide (Helical PDI) acceptor achieved PCEs of 3.5% in a conventional device architecture and 4.5% in an inverted structure.34 Similarly, Zang et al. found that BHJ blends of PTB7-Th donor with bay-linked perylene bisimide (di-PDI) achieved a higher PCE of 5.3% in an inverted device architecture than of 4.2% in the conventional structure.35 Conventional device PCE of 4.2% and inverted device PCE of 5.0% were reported by Li et al. for blends of a thiazolothiazoledithienosilole copolymer donor (PSEHTT) with non-fullerene acceptor 2,5-bis(8-(17-phenyl)-7,9,16,18-tetraazabenzodifluoranthene-3,4,12,13-tetracarboxylic acid diimide)thiophene (DBFI-T).21 Lu et al. found that optimized blends of polymer donor PBDTTT-CT with a perylene diimide dimer acceptor Bis-PDI-T-MO achieved 3.3% PCE in the conventional architecture and 4.2% in the inverted architecture, though notably, with different optimal processing amounts of the solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), related to tailoring the surface blend composition.36
2.2 Interfacial layers
Interfacial layers (or interlayers) are essentially used to tailor energy levels and electric fields within both conventional and inverted devices in order to facilitate efficient charge carrier collection from BHJ active materials by electrodes.37 They can also influence the film morphology of adjacent layers. Herein, we summarize the interlayers used in recent high performance non-fullerene solar cell devices with PCEs greater than 3.0% (structures shown in ESI†).
In conventional non-fullerene acceptor device architectures, the work function of the cathode (typically Al) is most commonly reduced by the inclusion of a thin evaporated layer of Ca38–42 (∼5–15 nm thick) or LiF21,43 (∼1 nm thick). Both Ca and LiF interlayers may be susceptible to oxidation (LiF may dissociate to produce reactive and diffusive Li during subsequent Al deposition)44 and may allow the diffusion of oxygen and water into the cell, thereby contributing to device degradation.45,46 Methanol solution processed organic cathode interlayers such as PFN47 (5 nm thick) and amino-substituted perylene diimide (PDIN)48–50 (methanol solution with 0.2% acetic acid, 14 nm thick) have also been used to achieve exceptional conventional device performance with relatively longer device stability. For example, Lin et al. demonstrated a PCE increase from 5.2 to 6.3% with improved device stability over time by replacing Ca with PDIN.49 The successful cathode work function lowering is attributed to the formation of interface dipoles, and the development of related materials is an active area of research.51
In inverted high-performance non-fullerene devices, ZnO (20–30 nm thick) is commonly used as an electron transport material interlayer between the BHJ and the ITO cathode. The solution processed ZnO layer is typically spin-coated in the form of nanoparticles52 or more often, a sol–gel precursor solution.21,34,36,53–56 The ZnO interlayer may be further tuned with the addition of a solution processed fullerene-based self-assembled monolayer (C60-SAM) to passivate electron-trapping hydroxyl groups.35,57 Zang et al. showed that inverted devices containing the BHJ blend of PTB7-Th donor with di-PDI discussed above achieved a further improvement in PCE from 5.3% to 5.9% through the inclusion of this SAM.35 Li et al. reported using a thin layer of ethanolamine to modify the ZnO surface of their inverted devices to achieve the 5.0% PCE of PSEHTT:DBFI-T discussed above.21
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the dominant hole transport material used in conventional non-fullerene small molecule devices.21,34,39–43,47–49,58 PEDOT:PSS is typically spin coated to a layer thickness of 30–40 nm onto the ITO anode following UV-ozone cleaning. Despite being acidic, and thereby possibly contributing to device degradation,59 PEDOT:PSS is used widely for its superior hole transporting ability.
Transition metal oxides may also act as hole transport materials.60 Thermally evaporated MoOx21,34–36,54,56,61 (5–10 nm) is the most prevalent hole transport interlayer employed in high-performance inverted non-fullerene devices, followed by V2O5 (ref. 55, 62 and 63) (2–20 nm). MoOx and V2O5 are often incorrectly reported to have conduction band minima of −2.3 and −2.4 eV relative to the vacuum level respectively, and work functions of 5.3 and 4.7 eV respectively.60,64 UPS and IPES studies have revealed the electron affinity, work function and ionization energy of MoOx to be 6.7, 6.86, and 9.68 eV respectively,65 and those of V2O5 to be 6.7, 7.0 and 9.5 eV respectively.66 The high work functions and deep lying unoccupied states leads to enhanced hole injection, attributed to electron extraction from the active layer HOMOs into these n-type materials. Although both materials can be solution processed67,68 (very recently from Cs-intercalated metal bronze solutions),69 in the high-performance devices reported herein, they are generally vacuum deposited followed by an Ag or Al anode.
2.3 Morphology
The vast majority of recent high-performance non-fullerene devices are solution processed from chlorinated solvents such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), with typical concentrations of ∼20 mg mL−1 for a resulting active layer thickness of ∼100 nm. One notable step towards greener solvents was made by Zang et al.35 with the use of o-xylene. The morphology of BHJ active layers is often tuned to improve device performance in two ways: (1) solvent variation and the inclusion of additives such as DIO and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)70–74 or solvent blends such as CF mixed with o-DCB42,54 and (2) through the incorporation of one or more gentle thermal annealing steps (typically 80–120 °C) in the device fabrication procedure.
For example, Holliday et al. showed that by using a unique 4:1 CF:o-DCB mixture an approximate 1.5-fold increase in PCE was observed when compared to using the common CB solvent. The D:A ratio is also critical, where the same study revealed significant drops in PCE when moving away from a 1:1 ratio.54 Zhong et al. demonstrated that the inverted device performance of the 3:7 mass ratio blend of PTB7 with Helical PDI discussed above could be improved beyond 4.5% PCE through the use of 1% DIO and 1% CN solvent additives, achieving a best inverted cell efficiency of 5.2%.34 On the other hand, Kim et al. found that the introduction of 0.5–3.0% DIO did not improve device performance, but that blended P3HT donor and fluorene-based (Flu-RH) acceptor devices processed from o-DCB outperformed those from CB and CF, at 3.1, 1.3 and 1.3% respectively.58 Zhang et al. reported that blends of PBDTTT-CT donor with PDI dimer Bis-PDI-Se-EG also deteriorate with the inclusion of DIO or CN from a best PCE of 4.0%, and instead achieved this optimal performance with a unique 6 hour o-DCB solvent vapour anneal step.75
Heating steps vary from recipe to recipe and may be nuanced; for example, Zhao et al. reported heating both the CB blend solution and ITO substrate on a hot plate at 110 °C prior to spin casting, followed by a 5 minute anneal at 100 °C before thermally depositing the top electrode,63 while Singh et al. casted from a CF blend solution at 40 °C and anneal for 15 minutes at 100 °C,62 and Liu et al. heated their CB solution at 110 °C and then annealed for 5 minutes at 80 °C.63 Park and co-works demonstrated a remarkable increase in PCE from 0.02% to 5.54% in an all small-molecule fullerene-free system upon thermally annealing the active layer at 110 °C.76 Here, thermal treatment induced phase-separation of the two blended materials resulting in domains suitable for effective charge separation and transport.
A recent review by Liao et al. discussed the idealized hierarchical morphology of BHJs as the balance between improving phase separation and suppressing oversized phase separation. AFM and TEM imaging often reveal optimized BHJ films to be relatively smooth with grain sizes typically on the order of tens of nanometers. Non-optimized blend films of the same active materials often have either significantly larger crystallites or amorphous character, and correspondingly poorer device performance.36,73,77–79 In addition to processing conditions, the choice of donor and donor/acceptor blend ratio are important factors in device optimization.
3. Donor considerations
The development of new donor materials, molecular or polymeric, is a rapidly expanding field and has led to a massive quantity of materials with proven photovoltaic potential.80–84 The OPV device performance of these materials has generally been evaluated in conjunction with fullerene acceptor materials in the active layer blend, providing a point of comparison for new materials.
Conversely, for the evaluation of non-fullerene acceptors, no comparable “universal donor” exists. In most cases, P3HT, the historical standard for donor materials, cannot compare to the efficiencies achieved by active layer blends containing new high performance donor materials that have been developed over the years.85,86 For this reason, the importance of selecting an appropriate donor material to assess new non-fullerene acceptors cannot be overstated. Cheng et al.87 have demonstrated the essential pairing of donor/acceptor materials and its correlation with device performance. This was highlighted by four unique active layer blends where only two of the four realized appreciable performances, approximately 10-fold increases, in comparison to the other two analogous combinations. Therefore, there are several guidelines to consider when selecting an appropriate material. Optoelectronic compatibility is crucial; most donor materials have been designed with narrow band gaps and thus non-fullerene acceptors can offer a complementary absorption profile to harness higher energy photons. Other considerations include appropriate energy level offset for efficient donor–acceptor charge transfer, as well as active layer thin-film properties where material solubility, crystallinity, and blend morphology each play an important role in realizing high performance.
This review of high performance non-fullerene acceptors reveals that high efficiencies can be achieved by blends with a range of different donor materials and serves to highlight the importance of screening various donor materials to determine the most compatible pairing.
4. Rylene-based acceptors
Rylene diimide-based π-conjugated materials are among the most efficient polymeric and molecular non-fullerene acceptors to date.88 Interest in rylene diimide-based systems results from their innate high electron affinities and mobilities. Coupled with their excellent chemical, thermal and photochemical stability, the ability to tune molecular electronic properties through variation at either the imide nitrogen atoms or the rylene skeleton makes these materials excellent candidates in optoelectronic devices.
Naphthalene diimides (NDIs) have been shown to be effective constituents of several polymeric non-fullerene acceptors,89–91 with the best efficiencies to date reaching 5.0% PCE,92 employing an all-polymer active layer composition. Unfortunately, the progress of NDI-based small molecule non-fullerene acceptors has not reached similar heights. To date, the record performance of an electron-accepting small molecule based on the NDI core structure has only reached a best efficiency of 2.4%.93 Despite their success in polymeric materials, NDI-based small molecule acceptors are not widely studied. On the other hand, perylene diimide, another rylene-type dye, has reached impressive performances as a small molecule non-fullerene acceptor and will be the focus of this section.
Perylene diimides (PDIs) are well-established organic dye molecules with a high electron affinity similar to fullerenes.94–97 They possess large extinction coefficients within the solar spectrum and high electron mobilities. One major obstacle facing PDI derivatives for OPV applications is their tendency to form poor bulk heterojunction morphologies. These extended π-conjugated structures strongly aggregate, leading to crystalline domains that are far too large, in comparison to exciton diffusion lengths (∼10 nm), for efficient exciton splitting.98,99 Recent synthetic efforts to minimize the formation of such unfavourable domains have focused on the introduction of bulky “swallow tail” branched aliphatic side chains to disrupt the packing structure,41,62 often in combination with a twisted PDI material through substitution on the aromatic core.40,61,63
4.1 Monomeric PDI small molecules
Linear PDI materials as non-fullerene acceptors have been designed according to the principle that bulky aliphatic side chains or aromatic substitution are sufficient to promote solubility in common processing solvents for solution processed BHJ OPV devices.
The simplest example of this design methodology for a high performance PDI non-fullerene acceptor is 1EP-PDI (Fig. 2), an unsubstituted perylene diimide core functionalized with bulky 1-ethylpropyl side chains. The location of a branching point nearest to the π-conjugated structure sufficiently disrupts the π–π interactions and allows for solubility in organic solvents.41,621EP-PDI offers a broad absorption profile, with maxima at approximately 500 nm and extending beyond 600 nm.100 The electrochemical properties of the material highlight the inherent π-accepting character of the PDI framework, with an LUMO energy level of approximately −3.8 eV.97 The optoelectronic properties of 1EP-PDI are dictated solely by the PDI chromophore, and serves as an excellent benchmark for comparison with the other PDI-based non-fullerene acceptors discussed in this section. The performance of this non-fullerene acceptor was evaluated in conventional architecture devices in combination with the high performance donor small molecule, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. These two materials proved to be complementary, with broad spectral coverage (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 absorbing beyond 750 nm) and a LUMO energy offset of 0.5 eV.100 The optimized devices, processed from chlorobenzene with 0.4 v/v% DIO additive, reached 3.1% PCE.411EP-PDI has also seen success with inverted device architectures. In combination with PBDTTT-CT, a donor polymer with similar optoelectronic properties to that of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, optimized devices with active layers processed from chloroform with 0.4 v/v% DIO additive and a V2O5 interlayer between the active layer and the anode reached performances of up to 3.7%.62 The addition of small volume fractions of DIO proves to be very important in these examples, providing a means to suppress the formation of large crystalline domains to access a favourable morphology. The high yields and ease of synthetic accessibility coupled with its proven performance highlights 1EP-PDI as an excellent benchmark material for screening various donor materials and for comparison with new non-fullerene acceptors.

Another high performance linear PDI acceptor, Phenyl-PDI (Fig. 2), was designed through a high-yielding Ru-catalyzed aromatic substitution with phenyl groups at the “headland” position (C2, C5, C8, and C11). This variation has demonstrated a significant influence on material morphology, leading to a slip-stacked structure, while not completely disrupting the π-stacking. The presence of these substituents also facilitates the solubility of the material in common organic solvents, which can be achieved with simple straight chain octyl aliphatic functionalization, as opposed to the aforementioned branched chains. It was found that the tetrasubstituted PDI core with phenyl groups outperformed those bearing hexyl or phenethyl functionalization, with a red shifted absorption spectrum, stabilization of the energy levels, and moderate thin-film crystallinity. In comparison to 1EP-PDI the absorption onset of Phenyl-PDI remained nearly the same; however, headland phenyl substitution red shifted the absorption maxima by nearly 80 nm, and lowered the LUMO energy level by 0.2 eV. To investigate the photovoltaic performance of Phenyl-PDI, active layer devices employed the donor polymer PBTI3T,101 and despite its relatively low-lying LUMO energy level of −3.8 eV, proved to be a worthy candidate. Phenyl-PDI realized PCEs approaching 3.7% in an inverted device architecture, optimized with 0.5 v/v% DIO additive.61
This class of non-fullerene acceptors offers a compelling combination of good photovoltaic performance and simplistic designs accessible from high-yielding and straightforward synthetic procedures. Ultimately, their success serves as a benchmark for the development of more complex PDI acceptors where greater efficiencies have been reached for a number of different structures.
4.2 Non-linear PDI small molecules
Despite the success of simplistic linear PDI materials, the pursuit of high performance PDI materials has been trending towards the development of non-linear PDIs, often consisting of two or more PDI units. The motivation for the design of this class of materials includes the versatility of tailoring different morphologies by molecular design and increased density of states near the LUMO energy. Non-linear PDI materials can be tethered into dimer, trimer or tetramer geometries through carbon–carbon bonds, either directly between PDI units or through a secondary bridging building block.
The design of di-PDI (Fig. 3), two PDI monomers connected at bay-positions by a single carbon–carbon bond through the Cu-catalyzed homo-coupling of two halogenated PDI monomers, is an excellent introduction to this methodology. This PDI derivative has led to a soluble and flexible structure, a result of a 70° dihedral angle between the two PDI units and imide nitrogen functionalization with symmetrical branched aliphatic side chains. The tethered di-PDI material offers more stabilized energy levels than a single PDI unit; however, its spectral coverage is less broad and falls short of 600 nm despite a more than 30 nm red shift in its absorption maxima. It should be noted that this singly-bound PDI dimer yields better OPV device performance than derivatives linked by two or three carbon bonds, which lead to structurally rigid, planar materials.102 Devices were fabricated in standard conventional and inverted architectures with an PTB7-Th:di-PDI active layer blend. The LUMO level of PTB7 is situated at −3.5 eV, offering a 0.5 eV offset between the two active layer materials. This donor polymer also plays an important role in broadening the spectral coverage, with absorption out to 750 nm and a λmax at 700 nm, well past the λonset of di-PDI. Devices were made to include two processing additives, DIO (1 v/v%) and CN (2 v/v%) and reached efficiencies of 4.2 and 5.3% respectively. Further device optimization involved the inclusion of ZnO modified self-assembled PC61BM monolayer (C60-SAM), and efficiencies rose to 5.9%.35 Interestingly, di-PDI proved to be quite adaptable; it was shown to be processable from o-xylenes, a common non-halogenated alternative to chlorobenzene. Devices returned impressive 5.2% PCEs, while the inclusion of the DIO and CN additives had only marginal effects in the non-halogenated system. The use of this processing solvent is an important feature of this material, where the sustainability of material synthesis, processing, and device fabrication become crucial for eventual large-scale commercial applications.103,104di-PDI also proved to be compatible with another high performance donor polymer, PffBT4T-2DT.55 Benefitting from a smaller LUMO energy offset than PTB7 (−3.7 eV versus −3.5 eV) devices reached 5.4% in an inverted architecture employing a V2O5 interlayer. This is noteworthy, as a similar trend was not observed for the another PDI acceptor, SF-PDI2, when paired with the same two donor polymers.55
 Fig. 3  Carbon bond tethered dimeric PDI small molecules. 
A slightly more rigid PDI dimer has exceeded the performance benchmark established by di-PDI. The PDI dimer, Helical PDI (Fig. 3), is formed from the photocyclization of two PDI units tethered by an ethylene bridge,105 and leads to an approximate 40° twist in the molecular backbone, reducing its propensity to aggregate. Further functionalization with branched aliphatic side chains at the imide nitrogen ensures good solubility in common organic solvents. This alternative tethering of two PDI monomers only slightly raises the LUMO energy level by 0.2 eV to −3.8 eV, but has a much more pronounced influence on the absorption profile. A massive blue shift in the λmax (533 nm versus 390 nm) and a 26 nm blue shift in the absorption onset demonstrates the drastic difference in morphology adopted by Helical PDI in comparison to di-PDI. An active layer blend with the same donor, PTB7, reached initial efficiencies of 3.5% in a conventional architecture, and 4.5% in an inverted architecture. Although initially low performance in comparison to di-PDI, the substitution of polymeric donor PTB7 for a the slightly less electron-rich analogue PTB7-Th, saw the smaller energy offset return efficiencies that reached 6.1% with co-additives, DIO and CN.34
The incorporation of various bridging units adds to the structural diversity available for linked non-linear PDI materials. Bis-PDI-T-EG (Fig. 4) introduces a thiophene bridging unit between two PDI materials through a Stille reaction protocol, albeit leading to three different isomers of the final material.38 The presence of the bridging thiophene units has a dramatic effect on material conformation, inducing a highly twisted dimeric backbone, with dihedral angles between the planes of 50°–60°. The inclusion of a thiophene bridging unit also had a noticeable influence on the optoelectronic properties of the material. Bis-PDI-T-EG exhibited a narrowed band gap in comparison to di-PDI (1.9 eV versus 2.1 eV), which translated into a broadened absorption profile, red-shifted by more than 100 nm. This structure bearing aliphatic side chains at the imide nitrogen, as well as ethylene glycol substituents at bay positions, showed adequate solubility in common organic processing solvents. Despite the twisted structure, AFM measurements showed that Bis-PDI-T-EG still exhibits strong aggregation and micrometer-sized domains in thin-film blends. Following the incorporation of DIO as a solvent additive, the number of micrometer-sized domains decreased. Improved device performance is attributed to favourable morphology achieved with the DIO additive, as conventional device architectures reached 4.0% efficiency in combination with the complementary donor polymer PBDTTT-CT (0.5 eV LUMO energy offset) but only 0.8% without the solvent additive. Rigorous optimization of DIO concentration and the use of solvent vapour annealing of the active layer blend led to an impressive additional increase in PCE rising from 4.0 to 6.1%, clearly morphology was the limiting component of these devices.39

The performance of both conventional and inverted device architectures was assessed for an analogous material bearing methoxy (MO) substituents, Bis-PDI-T-MO (Fig. 4) in place of the ethylene glycol (EG) side chains of Bis-PDI-T-EG. Clearly the substitution of EG for MO side chains was morphologically motivated as this modification only slightly blue-shifted both the onset and maxima of Bis-PDI-T-MO, while the electrochemical properties remained essentially the same. It was found that the conventional architecture devices with the same donor polymer PBDTTT-CT reached optimum PCEs of 3.3% with 7 v/v% DIO additive. When an inverted architecture was employed, active layer processing required only 2 v/v% DIO to reach the highest performance of 4.3%. Greater DIO concentration was found to perturb device performance, due to the favourable solubility of Bis-PDI-T-MO in DIO, leading to the formation of larger aggregates.36 This serves to emphasize the differences between conventional and inverted device architecture, where similar active layer processing techniques do not necessarily have a related influence on device performance.

Bis-PDI-Se-EG (Fig. 4) is another derivative of Bis-PDI-T-EG. In this case, the bridging unit is a selenophene linker rather than thiophene, a substitution with literature precedence to potentially enhance charge transport and overall performance.91 The steric influence on the π-conjugated backbone is reported to be similar to that of the thiophene derivative, with a dihedral angle between PDI and the selenophene plane at approximately 56°. It also exhibited similar optical and electrochemical properties to Bis-PDI-T-EG with only subtle changes to the HOMO energy level and slight red-shifts in both λmax and λonset. The photovoltaic properties were assessed with P3HT and PBDTTT-CT and optimized in the conventional architecture while varying processing solvent, weight ratios, additive content and post-deposition annealing.75 The highest performance reached 4.0% PCE and was achieved for devices that contained no additives, with o-dichlorobenzene as the processing solvent and post-deposition solvent vapour annealing.
Introducing more complex non-coplanar arylene linkers between PDI monomers, such as spirobifluorene-2,7-diyl, is expected to offer different forms of intermolecular stacking and crystallization suppression.106SF-PDI2 (Fig. 5) has a similar absorption profile to di-PDI in terms of absorption onset and maxima. The electrochemical properties of SF-PDI2 are consistent with other materials of this type, exhibiting low-lying LUMO levels similar to that of the thiophene-bridged analogues, but a wider bandgap (2.1 eV versus 1.9 eV) where the HOMO levels are decidedly lower, yet just slightly raised from that of the monomer. As an initial screening, devices were fabricated in an inverted architecture with P3HT as the donor component, and reached efficiencies of 2.4%. Device optimization has since seen the PCE of SF-PDI2 reach 6.3% in an inverted architecture, which underlines that overall device optimization can lead to substantial performance increases.55 Inverted architecture optimization included active layers cast in a 1:1.4 weight ratio from chlorobenzene rather than o-dichlorobenzene, and a V2O5 interlayer replacing MoO3. To determine the best energy level compatibility with SF-PDI2 two donor polymers were screened in this evaluation, PffBT4T-2DT and PTB7-Th. PffBT4T-2DT, with the higher-lying LUMO level, reached 6.3% PCE, in comparison to just 3.0% for PTB7-Th. PffBT4T-2DT proved to be more well-matched, with higher Jsc values (10.7 versus 7.4 mA cm−2) and fill factors (0.57 versus 0.39), potentially due in part to a better active layer morphology with more efficient charge separation and transport. These subtle alterations cannot be overlooked, where variation in device fabrication, active layer processing, and donor selection demonstrates how critical each of these components are to realizing high efficiencies.

The success of PDI-dimer materials has led to the exploration of PDI trimers and tetramers. The introduction of an sp3 hybridized triphenylamine (TPA) central unit via a low-yielding (46%) Suzuki coupling leads to a 3-armed (dendritic) PDI trimer, S(TPA-PDI) (Fig. 6). Dendritic type molecules are attractive for their non-planar structures, which can lead to isotropic optical and charge-transporting properties.40 The electron-rich TPA core contributes to the relative high-lying LUMO level of −3.7 eV, the highest energy level of all PDI non-fullerene acceptors discussed in this section. The TPA unit also contributes to the donor–acceptor (D–A) character of the material, effectively narrowing the band gap to 1.8 eV, which is among the smallest for PDI-based non-fullerene acceptors. Solar cell devices using S(TPA-PDI) have exhibited performance efficiencies up to 3.3% in conventional device architecture when paired with one of the more electron-rich donor polymers, PBDTTT-CT (0.4 eV energy level offset) and processed from o-dichlorobenzene with 5.0 v/v% DIO additive, mitigating aggregation and large domain sizes.
 Fig. 6  Trimeric and tetrameric PDI small molecules. 
The structure of the high performance 4-arm PDI dendrimer, TPE-PDI4 (Fig. 6), incorporates a tetraphenylethylene core as the bridging unit between four PDI monomers, accessible through a Suzuki coupling with acceptable yields (63%). The four phenyl rings of TPE-PDI4 are highly twisted, angled approximately 50° to the double bond, due to steric demand, leading to a propeller-shape structure. In comparison to the 3-arm S(TPA-PDI), LUMO energy levels remain the same; however, the lack of the strong TPA core donor unit reduces the HOMO energy level by approximately 0.3 eV leading to a wide bang gap and blue-shifted absorption profile. Weak intermolecular interactions have been documented for TPE-based materials, leading to excellent solubility in organic solvents even with minimal alkyl side chains. Thin films of TPE-PDI4 have been shown to be smooth and amorphous, with featureless surfaces attributed to the ability of tetraphenylethylene to reduce the aggregation tendency of the PDI units. Devices were fabricated with an inverted architecture using a PTB7-Th:TPE-PDI4 active layer blend and a V2O5 anode interlayer. While the absorption profiles of the two materials complement each other nicely, the energy level offset is among the smallest reported for high performance non-fullerene acceptors with only approximately 0.1 eV between the LUMO of the donor and that of the acceptor. Despite this peculiarity, performance reached PCEs of 5.5% without any processing additives.63
A summary of key material properties, active layer components and device parameters discussed in this section can be found in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. PDI-based materials have reached promising efficiencies and satisfy many of the criteria for a viable alternative to fullerenes as the acceptor component in solution processable BHJ OPV devices, yet these materials still have a few drawbacks. Their aggregation behaviour and crystallinity continue to dictate their molecular design,48 often requiring both bulky alkyl side chains and a steric induced twist to the π-conjugated backbone. The synthesis of these materials can be demanding and low yielding with the formation of unwanted isomers, offering little advantage over fullerenes in terms of synthetic scalability.54

5. Non-PDI small molecule acceptors
While a large fraction of high performance non-fullerene acceptors are PDI-based, non-PDI small molecules have been designed to be synthetically simple and versatile, with PCEs that can match PDI derivatives. These materials have seen efficiencies rise from 3.0 to nearly 7.0%,48 surpassing the highest recorded PCE for a PDI-based acceptor this past year.
5.1 Dimeric small molecules
Considering the success demonstrated by oligomeric PDI materials, specifically due to their non-planar geometry, several new structures have adopted this methodology as a design principle for new non-PDI small molecule acceptors (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Dimeric non-PDI small molecules. 
The small molecule dimer, DBFI-T,21 has a similar design to the thiophene linked PDI dimer Bis-PDI-T-EG. Each monomeric unit has a planar and extended π-conjugated core with alkyl functionalized imide moieties to influence solubility, and phenyl substituents to influence intermolecular aggregation. A single thiophene linker is used to bring two monomers together into a dimer conformation, DFT analysis demonstrates that a nearly 33° interplanar angle exists between the two monomeric species due to steric hindrance.21 In comparison to the analogous thiophene tethered PDI dimer Bis-PDI-T-EG, this rylene-type structure offers nearly identical energy levels but the clear structural differences lead to different absorption profiles with DBFI-T offering minimal absorption beyond 450 nm. Employing conventional device architecture, with a LiF cathode interlayer, DBFI-T was screened in comparison with its monomeric species and PC60BM, blended with a common low-bandgap donor polymer PSEHTT,107 offering a 0.5 eV energy level offset. Due to the negligible absorption of DBFI-T beyond 450 nm the spectral coverage of the active layer materials has a large gap between the maxima of DBFI-T at 387 nm and that of PSEHTT at 579 nm. The thin film morphology was assessed by AFM and displayed uniform nanoscale phase separation with a nearly amorphous surface. When compared to the coarse phase separation of the highly crystalline monomer and its large domain sizes, the importance of the twisted dimeric structure is highlighted, which in this case, led to a favourable film morphology and domain sizes (Fig. 8). Optimization of the blend active layer composition led to a PCE of 4.2%, in comparison to 3.6% achieved by the PC60BM blend and more than double that of the monomeric structure blend. Further increases in performance were achieved by switching to the inverted architecture; DBFI-T PCEs reached 5.0%, accompanied by a small efficiency increase for the monomeric material blend, and decrease for the PC60BM blend.21

Another successful non-planar small molecule has been designed based on an azadipyrromethene dye. These materials have intense absorption in the visible to near-IR region of the solar spectrum and low reduction potentials, and can be further tuned through the coordination of boron or transition metals. Until recent reports, azadipyrromethene materials had not been utilized as electron acceptors for OPVs. The high performance azadipyrromethene-based material Zn(WS3)2 has been designed with extended conjugation through the incorporation of phenylethynyl groups at the pyrrolic positions and Zn-coordinated ligands, forming large conjugated structures. Zn(WS3)2 is among the most electron-deficient non-PDI fullerene alternatives, with a LUMO energy level of −3.9 eV, on par with many PDI-based materials. As opposed to many of the PDI-based non-fullerene acceptors where λmax is at 500 nm or higher energies, Zn(WS3)2 has its maximum absorption approaching 700 nm, which represents on of the most red-shifted λmax for high performance non-fullerene acceptors to date. The twisted nature of these conjugated ligands allows them to point in all directions, potentially resulting in isotropic charge transport while also preventing over-crystallization, leading to favourable nanoscale morphology. The selection of P3HT as the donor component in the active layer blend complements the absorption profile of Zn(WS3)2, which resembles many of the high performance donor polymers discussed in this review. In this case, it is the donor component P3HT, rather than the acceptor, that offers spectral coverage in the higher energy region, while Zn(WS3)2 serves to extend the absorption profile and is responsible light harvesting in the region of maximum solar flux. The photovoltaic performance of P3HT:Zn(WS3)2 active layer blends were investigated in inverted device architectures, and optimized by varying film thickness and thermal annealing conditions, with the best devices reaching 4.1% PCE.56
The successful use of non-planar small molecule acceptors has demonstrated that the methodology of perturbing aggregation by inducing a large twist to the molecular backbones can be extended to non-PDI structures. This represents an important tool for the design of future non-planar small molecules. However, it must be understood that dimeric small molecules are not a necessary criterion for high performance OPV materials.
5.2 Planar small molecules
Beyond the well-established performance of both PDI and non-PDI non-planar acceptors, including both PDI and non-PDI materials, linear small molecules as non-fullerene acceptors have also demonstrated impressive OPV device performance.
A common building block for the design of non-fullerene acceptors is benzothiadiazole (BT). BT is a well-known building block used in π-conjugated small molecules for its favourable electron affinity and strong absorption in the visible spectrum108 when coupled with electron rich units. As such, it comes as no surprise to see BT incorporated in the structure of several high-performance non-fullerene acceptors. HPI-BT (Fig. 9) is an example of a simple BT-based non-fullerene acceptor that has reached impressive performances. HPI-BT can be synthesized in a two-step protocol and functionalized with low-cost phthalimide end cap units, another building block that has been incorporated in many electron-accepting materials.79,109–113 The synthesis of this material exemplifies the straightforward and versatile synthesis of many non-PDI acceptors, wherein a single synthetic protocol can be adapted to access several materials. HPI-BT has one of the widest band-gaps of non-fullerene acceptors at 2.3 eV, with a relatively high lying LUMO level that sits at −3.5 eV. As a result, HPI-BT has minimal absorption past 500 nm but contributes to a broad absorption in the high-energy region with maximum absorption at 420 nm. The relatively high-lying LUMO level of HPI-BT influences the choice of donor material, where the average LUMO level of the donors discussed in this review rest at −3.5 eV. In this case, P3HT was chosen as the donor component, and with a LUMO energy level of −3.2 eV, can offer a suitable energy offset. With the inclusion of P3HT the spectral overlap of the active layer extends past 600 nm but remains well short of the broad coverage seen with other non-fullerene acceptors. Initial results demonstrated a 2.5% efficient device using P3HT as the donor,108 and this has since been improved to reach 3.7%.43 Much of the performance improvement was attributed to optimization of the synthetic and purification procedures as well as the use of higher purity and regioregularity P3HT, highlighting the importance of material purity and its relation to device performance.43
 Fig. 9  Non-fullerene acceptors with terminal imide units. 
Another high performance non-fullerene acceptor has been designed to incorporate imide-based terminal units. In this case, naphthalimide, a relative of phthalimide, was incorporated.76,108,114NIDCS-MO (Fig. 9) was synthesized through a Stille reaction and a Knoevenagel condensation to incorporate naphthalimide as the end cap unit for a dicyanodistyrylbenzene-based molecular framework.115,116 The combination of these building blocks into a functional structure resulted in synergistic electron-accepting properties and complementary self-assembly tendencies. The incorporation of the D–A thiophene-flanked dicyanodistyrylbenzene core unit serves to narrow the band gap of NIDCS-MO in comparison to HPI-BT lowering the LUMO energy level by 0.2 eV and red-shifting both the λmax and λonset. The choice of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 as the donor material represents an appropriate donor–acceptor pair, highlighted by a 0.4 eV LUMO energy level offset and complementary absorption profile from broad spectral coverage. AFM measurements of the active layer blends with p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 revealed the formation of larger domain sizes upon thermal annealing, yet the films remained reasonably smooth and uniform. The ability to induce small scale morphological changes was exploited in conventional architecture device optimization, where the fine tuning of annealing conditions and active layer thickness yielded device efficiencies reaching 5.4%.76 This is the best performance for a non-fullerene acceptor with terminal imide acceptors, highlighting the potential for other materials employing similar designs.
Several recent high performance non-PDI small molecule acceptors have been built around the common and low-cost building block fluorene. Fluorene offers versatile energy level tuning through substitution at the 2,7 positions and tunable solubility and crystallinity through side-chain engineering. The search for high performance, readily accessible non-fullerene small molecule electron acceptors has been notably pioneered by Watkins et al.117 They designed a fluorene-based non-fullerene acceptor assembled using a sustainable and scalable (>20 g) synthetic procedure. Ultimately, OPV performance was low, with the best cell PCE at 2.4%; however, device optimization rather than material design proved to be the limiting factor in the case of fluorene-based acceptors. F(DPP)2B2 (Fig. 10) is an excellent example of the inherent capability for high performance of fluorene-based non-fullerene acceptors. F(DPP)2B2 has a thiophene-flanked fluorene core with terminal diketopyrrolopyrrole units, a well-known dye building block.111,118,119 Two types of aromatic six-membered rings (fluorene and benzene capped DPP) were chosen as a means to incur small deviations from planarity, achieved through the creation of >20° dihedral angles in order to perturb the formation of large aggregates. This DPP-flanked fluorene acceptor employs the D–A approach to band gap engineering, red-shifting the absorption maxima beyond 700 nm; however, this relatively narrow band gap has the most destabilized energy levels of all non-fullerene acceptors reported in this review, with a particularly high LUMO level at −3.4 eV. Similar to HPI-BT, the high-lying LUMO level of F(DPP)2B2 has influenced the choice of P3HT as the donor component to investigate OPV performance, which is a fitting energy level match and contributes to a broadened the absorption profile in the high-energy region. AFM measurements confirmed the formation of a smooth thin film surface with favourable morphology for OPVs. Device performance was investigated in conventional architecture with a PFN/Al top contact and optimized with thermal annealing. The best efficiency achieved to date for P3HT:F(DPP)2B2 is 3.2%.47
 Fig. 10  Fluorene-based non-PDI small molecules. 

Flu-RH (Fig. 10) is another fluorene-based material that has recently surpassed 3.0% PCE as a non-fullerene acceptor. This material is functionalized with rhodamine end cap units; these building blocks and their derivatives are commonly used in dye chemistry and lead to strong push–pull chromophores, offering electron-withdrawing character through their ketone and thioketone groups. The substitution of these terminal acceptors in place of the ambipolar DPP end caps of F(DPP)2B2 drops the LUMO energy by 0.1 eV, highlighting the more electron-deficient nature of the rhodamine building block. Additional substitution can occur by varying the imide alkyl chain to tailor the solubility of the final material. Flu-RH can be synthesized in a sustainable three-step process that makes use of a Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation, which generate environmentally benign organoboron compounds and water as the respective side products. Similar to F(DPP)2B2, Flu-RH has been investigated as a non-fullerene acceptor with P3HT as the donor material. While this active layer composition has a larger energy level offset, the absorption profile of Flu-RH is very similar to that of P3HT (λmax = 510 nm, 550 nm and λonset = 600 nm, 650 nm respectively) and therefore does not offer the broad coverage seen for P3HT:F(DPP)2B2. AFM measurements of the active layer morphology highlighted the influence of processing solvent; where roughness was found to increase in active layers cast from o-dichlorobenzene in comparison to chloroform. Consequently, device optimization included assessment of processing solvents and thermal annealing temperatures. As a result, the performance of Flu-RH peaked at 3.1% when cast from o-dichlorobenzene compared to 1.3% from chloroform.58 Ultimately F(DPP)2B2 and Flu-RH returned similar efficiencies; however, structural modification of the Flu-RH framework eventually led to the highest performance fluorene-based non-fullerene acceptor to date.

FBR (Fig. 10) has a related structure to Flu-RH, and has improved on the established efficiencies of its predecessor. Modification to the structure of Flu-RH occurs at the thiophene bridge, replacing this weak donor with an electron-deficient BT substituent. FBR is synthesized through a similar protocol to that outlined for Flu-RH, highlighting the versatility of such a molecular architecture. The replacement of thiophene with BT dropped the HOMO and LUMO energy levels by 0.1 eV but band gap remained the same, with a slight blue-shift in the onset of absorption. To evaluate the performance of this material, devices were fabricated in an inverted architecture with P3HT as the donor material, and led to no discernible thin film aggregation based on optical microscope images of the active blends. In comparison to Flu-RH, FBR has a larger LUMO energy offset with the P3HT donor; however, it appears that thin-film morphology was more influential on device performance. The reported thin-film roughness of P3HT:Flu-RH did not manifest in thin-films of P3HT:FBR, presumably due to the different self-assembly tendencies resulting from thiophene for BT substitution. Optimization of devices included active layer thickness, post-deposition thermal annealing and a 4:1 CHCl3:o-DCB processing solvent mixture. Device performance has reached 4.1% PCE, which is among the highest efficiencies for a non-fullerene based device with P3HT.54
Indacenodithiophene-based π-conjugated materials are another promising class of non-fullerene acceptors. The indacenodithiophene unit is a rigid and planar structure with excellent hole transporting and light absorption properties.120–122 This five-ring fused core can be substituted with four rigid p-hexylphenyl groups to restrict molecular planarity, aggregation tendency and thus the formation of large domain sizes in BHJ active layer blends. Investigation of these materials as potential non-fullerene acceptors has focused on incorporating strong electron-withdrawing terminal units to tune the energy levels in order to provide a suitable energy offset when paired with established donor materials.

DC-IDT2T (Fig. 11) is an excellent example of this methodology put into practice. Through the incorporation of strong electron-withdrawing dicyanomethylene-indanone end cap units bearing one carbonyl and two cyano groups, the electron affinity of the material is drastically increased, making it suitable for accepting electrons. The material can be synthesized in high yields in two synthetic steps, where the precursor to the final material has terminal aldehyde units enabling various end cap units to be installed via Knoevenagel condensations. DC-IDT2T is a narrow band gap non-fullerene acceptor with broad optical absorption from 600 to 800 nm. Its low-lying LUMO level at −3.9 eV is comparable to the values for many of the PDI-based acceptors. To demonstrate the potential of DC-IDT2T as a non-fullerene acceptor, devices were fabricated with the conventional architecture and optimized with respect to weight ratios and the use of co-solvents to modify and control the morphology of the active layer. A dichlorobenzene and chloroform (15 v/v%) processing solvent combination was used to deposit active layer films of PBDTTT-CT:DC-IDT2T and led to a smooth morphology where AFM images suggested the presence of favourable interpenetrating networks without detrimental phase separation. The PBDTTT-CT:DC-IDT2T active layer blend has an energy level offset of 0.6 eV and constitutes one of the largest reported offsets for high performance non-fullerene acceptors. This active layer composition and its strong optical absorption in the region of maximum solar flux returned an OPV device performance best cell PCE of 3.9% without any post-deposition treatment.42
 Fig. 11  Indacenodithiophene-based non-fullerene acceptors. 
Building on this established success, a derivative of DC-IDT2T was synthesized based on the same molecular framework to include 2-ethylhexyl side chains substituted at each of the 3-positions of the thiophene bridge, contributing to material solubility and aggregation behaviour. This structural modification had no significant influence on the optoelectronic properties of the material and instead targeted a more favourable thin-film morphology through altered self-assembly tendencies as a result of the additional branch akyl chains. The device performance of IEIC (Fig. 11) was assessed in a conventional architecture, with the high performance polymer PTB7-Th instead of PBDTTT-CT, contributing to stronger light absorption in the 700–800 nm region. PTB7-Th offers a 0.3 eV lower LUMO energy level than PBDTTT-CT, drastically reducing the large energetic loss associated with the 0.6 eV offset of PBDTTT-CT:DC-IDT2T. Device fabrication was optimized for weight ratios, leading to a smooth morphology with nearly uniform crystalline domains. Initial OPV device performance reached 5.2% and later rose to 6.3% through the addition of an PDIN interlayer between the active layer and the top contact.49
The highest performance non-fullerene acceptor to date is another structural derivative of DC-IDT2T, in which the thiophene bridge has been incorporated into the core as a fused bithiophene unit, leading to a seven-ring core structure. ITIC (Fig. 11), adopts essentially the same electrochemical properties as its predecessors with a slight blue shift in both the maximum and onset of absorption. Devices were fabricated in a similar fashion to that of IEIC, employing a conventional device architecture with a PDIN interlayer and PTB7-Th as the donor polymer. The active layer morphology, as determined by AFM, was smooth, showing good miscibility of blend materials with uniform crystalline domains. The fused seven ring system clearly promoted the formation of a favourable active layer morphology as PCEs for the PTB7-Th:ITIC active layer reached 6.8%, representing the highest PCE of a non-fullerene to date.48
A summary of key material properties, as well as active layer components and device parameters discussed in this section can be found in Tables 3 and 4 respectively. As communicated, the development of small molecule non-fullerene acceptors has resulted in an excellent progression in OPV performance. This highlights the potential of these materials, offering comparable efficiencies to commonly used PDI acceptors with an advantage in terms of a low-cost, versatile, high-yielding and scalable synthetic accessibility.

6. Conclusions
The versatility of π-conjugated small molecule acceptors has enabled the fine-tuning of material properties through structural modification and has led to the emergence of a large diversity of materials in the development of alternatives to fullerene acceptors in OPV devices.
While the diversity of the high-performance non-fullerene acceptors reviewed herein cannot be understated, the reader should be aware of the three common design themes: (1) strong electron-withdrawing functionalities to increase the π-accepting character of the molecular framework (2) bulky substituents and induced non-planarity to reduce the propensity for strong π–π interactions and large aggregate formation, (3) aliphatic side chains to promote material solubility and influence thin-film morphology. The successful implementation of these design strategies with the help of significant advances in device optimization have led to remarkable improvements in device performance where the benchmark materials have risen from 3 to nearly 7% efficiencies within the last year. Yet, despite this noted success, one must realize these non-fullerene acceptors are often limited to high efficiencies with only one specific donor material, unlike fullerene derivatives, which have been shown to be compatible with a range of donors. This raises the question are these efficiencies an effect of the non-fullerene acceptor or are they primarily a consequence of the established high-performance donor material? Therefore, the challenge remains to find a non-fullerene acceptor that can achieve high performance with a range of donor materials.
In particular, significant advancement in the development of all-small-molecule BHJ devices is required to take advantage of the well-known benefits of molecular over polymeric systems. This is highlighted by the fact that the composition of the majority of high-performance active layer blends includes a polymeric donor, and only two of the twenty device architectures we have reviewed make use of a molecular donor. Evidently, high-performance all-small-molecule active layers have proved to be significantly challenging. This should encourage their investigation in the interest of further progress in non-fullerene acceptors for OPVs.
