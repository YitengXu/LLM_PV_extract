    , Accepted 9th July 2021First published on 9th July 2021AbstractInverted organic solar cells (OSCs) containing high work-function metal anodes (e.g., Ag or Au) and modified indium tin oxide (ITO) cathodes are more compatible with large area printing technique and exhibit superior stability. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles are widely used as cathode interlayer materials in inverted OSCs. However, low temperature processed ZnO nanoparticle films always have large amount of defect states, decreasing the device efficiency and stability. In this manuscript, a nucleobase adenine (A)-based polymer (PA) was synthesized through reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. PA works as an efficient modifier to passivate the defects, improve the conductivity, and reduce the work function (WF) of the ZnO nanoparticle films. The resultant organic–inorganic hybrid composite shows strong power on interfacial modification and energy level alignment at the device interface. The modification of ZnO nanoparticle interlayers with PA can efficiently suppress the charge recombination, and reduce the Schottky barriers of solar cell devices, affording high performance fullerene- and non-fullerene-based OSCs over a wide interlayer thickness range, from ∼18 nm to ∼100 nm. Devices containing ZnO nanoparticle interlayers modified with an optimal PA weight ratio (∼25%) yielded a maximum efficiency of 16.2%, which is among the highest efficiencies reported for inverted OSCs with the non-fullerene active layer.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are of considerable interest in academic and industrial community because of their promise towards low-cost energy harvesting.1–3 The last two decades have seen dramatic increases of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in OSCs due to tremendous efforts in device engineering4–8 and the synthetic tailoring on organic conjugated molecules,9–13 especially the recent breakthrough on fused-ring electron acceptors.14–19 Typically, OSCs consist of a bottom indium tin oxide (ITO) anode, an anode interlayer (e.g., PEDOT:PSS: poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate), a photoactive layer and a low work-function top metal cathode (e.g., Ca, Al).20 However, the acidity of PEDOT:PSS is corrosive to ITO and leads to device degradation,21–23 while the low work-function metal electrodes are not air stable and require vacuum deposition, which is incompatible with large area device fabrication.24,25 To avoid these, inverted OSCs containing high work-function metal anodes (e.g., Ag, Au) and modified ITO cathodes, have been developed, showing great advantages on device processing and stability.26–29 A major challenge associated with inverted OSCs is the charge extraction and transport at the interface between the active layer and ITO electrode,30,31 because non-Ohmic contact at this interface generally induces large energy barriers, leading to charge recombination and a resultant inferior device performance.32–36
To address this limitation, solution-processed metal oxides have been widely used as cathode interlayers to modify ITO electrode in inverted OSCs.37,38 Zinc oxide (ZnO) interlayers are of particular interest in producing inverted OSCs due to their excellent optical transparency, high electron mobility and low work-function.39 However, high quality ZnO films produced by sol–gel procedures usually need high temperature thermal annealing for a long time.39 Although the pre-synthesized ZnO colloidal nanoparticles are quite compatible with the roll-to-roll coating process without using complicated thermal annealing,40,41 there are many defects in ZnO nanoparticle films, such as oxygen vacancy, dangling bonds and surface groups, which are electron trap sites and charge recombination centers in solar cell devices.39 Thus, the fabrication of uniform ZnO nanoparticle films with low density defects is crucial for achieving efficient inverted OSCs. Some conjugated molecules and polarized polymers, such as 1,6,7,12-tetraphenoxysubstituted perylene bisimide dyes (PBI-SO3H),42 poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),43 poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),44 polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP),45 and polyaspartic acid46 were used to modify the ZnO nanoparticle films and efficiently passivate the defects. Considering the practical applications, polymers afford the advantages of both solution processing and robust film formation in comparison with small molecule modifiers. However, these modifiers are generally water-soluble and hygroscopic materials, which easily absorb moisture when processed under ambient atmosphere and degrade the long-term stability of the device. Moreover, the device performance is very sensitive to the amount of the polymers used to modify the ZnO nanoparticles,39,45 which is unfavorable for processing considerations. Also, the optimal thickness of the ZnO layer for device fabrication was usually found to be ∼30 nm, which limits the thickness processing window and reduces the reproducibility of device fabrication, especially for a large area roll-to-roll production.47
Herein, we integrated nucleobase adenine (A) into a polymer as pendent groups (PA: Poly(9-(4-vinylbenzyl) adenine), Mn = 8.1 kDa, Fig. 1) through the reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. This synthesis proved rapid and efficient, and the selected polymerization method afforded the adenine-based polymer (PA) with a controllable molecular weight.48 Nucleobase adenine (A) is a well-known purine nucleobase and can be adsorbed on the metal oxide surface.49,50 Yet, the nucleobase adenine (A) is generally soluble in boiling water, acid or alkali, which is not suitable for solar cell fabrication. By contrast, PA shows good solubility in alcohol-based solvents, compatible with multilayered device fabrication, such as OSCs. PA can efficiently passivate the defects, increase the conductivity, and decrease the work function (WF) of the ZnO nanoparticle films, which benefit the realization of film thickness insensitive interlayers with strong power on interfacial modification and energy level alignment. The use of the ZnO/PA nanocomposite interlayers in OSCs effectively suppresses the charge recombination and reduces the Schottky barrier at the device interface, increasing the efficiencies of fullerene- and non-fullerene-based OSCs over a wide interlayer thickness range, from ∼18 nm to ∼100 nm. Devices containing ZnO nanoparticle interlayers modified with an optimal PA weight ratio (∼25%) yielded a maximum efficiency of 16.2%, among the highest efficiency of inverted OSCs with a similar active layer.

Results and discussion
Inverted OSCs were first fabricated by coating the ZnO nanoparticles or ZnO nanoparticle solution containing PA directly onto the ITO substrates (Fig. 1). The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer, containing a blend of [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor and the low bandgap conjugated polymer PTB7 as the donor (Fig. S1, ESI†), was then spin-coated onto the pristine or PA-modified ZnO nanoparticle films. Molybdenum oxide was deposited by thermal evaporation, followed by silver as the anode. The devices with ZnO nanoparticle films annealed at 150 °C show almost the same performance as those without any treatment (Table S1, ESI†). Also, the inverted devices with ZnO nanoparticle films performed better than the devices with a normal geometry (Table S2, ESI†). The optimized inverted OSCs fabricated with pristine ZnO nanoparticle cathode interlayers gave PCE values of 7.01 ± 0.14% (maximum PCE 7.29%), which are comparable to previous report.51 Then, we investigated the dependence of device performance on the PA weight ratio by spin-coating ZnO nanoparticle solutions with different PA weight ratios onto ITO substrates to afford ZnO:PA interlayers with similar thickness (∼30 nm). As shown in Fig. 2A, with the increase in PA weight ratio from ∼5% to ∼30%, the device performance was largely improved in comparison with those without modification (Table S3, ESI†). Devices containing ZnO nanoparticle interlayers modified with an optimal PA weight ratio (∼25%) yielded highest PCE values of 8.73 ± 0.09% (maximum PCE 8.88%). We also conducted external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements to further confirm the short circuit current density (JSC) of the devices. The integrated currents calculated from the EQE spectra are within 5% of the values measured from the current density–voltage (J–V) curves (Fig. S2 and Table S3, ESI†). This notable improvement in PCE stems from higher open circuit voltage (VOC), JSC, and fill factor (FF) values, while devices with pristine ZnO nanoparticle interlayers suffer from the high density of defect states, which are electron trap sites to induce charges recombination in solar cell devices. Overall, an excellent device tolerance to PA weight ratio is observed, and high PCE values are maintained (>8%) across the whole weight ratio range from ∼5% to ∼30%. Moreover, the modification of ZnO nanoparticle films with PA dramatically improved the solar cell device stability as demonstrated by the stability experiments carried out in a glovebox for around 20 days (Fig. 2B and Table S4, ESI†).

Non-fullerene OSCs are invigorating the research community as they are promising to achieve higher performance due to the more diverse molecular design on the electron acceptors.52 We thus investigated the application of PA-modified ZnO nanoparticle interlayers in inverted OSCs with a non-fullerene active layer (Fig. S1, ESI:† PM6 is the electron donor and Y6 is the electron acceptor). As shown in Fig. 2C and Table S5 (ESI†), devices with pristine ZnO nanoparticle interlayers had a maximum PCE of 14.3%, while after modifying the ZnO nanoparticles with PA, the devices showed a remarkable PCE value of 16.2%, which is among the highest efficiency reported so far for the PM6:Y6 inverted OSCs.53 The integrated currents calculated from the EQE spectra are within 5% of the values measured from the J–V curves (Fig. 2D). Considering the influence of amino groups on the non-fullerene acceptors in active layers,54 we carried out the light soaking and thermal stability experiments to investigate the stability of the PM6:Y6 based devices containing pristine ZnO nanoparticle films or ZnO nanoparticle films with 25% PA in weight (Fig. S3, ESI†). Devices with ZnO:PA (25% PA) interlayer show better light soaking and thermal stability than those with pristine ZnO interlayer.
We next studied the dependence of device performance (PTB7:PC71BM based solar cells) on interlayer film thickness by spin-coating ZnO or ZnO:PA (25% PA) nanoparticle solutions of varying concentrations onto ITO substrates to afford cathode interlayers over a thickness range from ∼18 to ∼100 nm. As shown in Table 1, overall, the devices with PA-modified ZnO nanoparticle films performed better than those with pristine ZnO nanoparticle films, showing the power of PA modification on improving the performance of ZnO nanoparticle interlayers. The device performance showed good tolerance to ZnO:PA interlayer thickness variations, maintaining peak values of VOC (∼0.75 V) and FF (∼70%), with average PCEs over 7.9% across the entire thickness range from ∼18 nm to ∼100 nm, reflecting the excellent electron collection and transport capability of PA-modified ZnO nanoparticle films. Yet, devices with the pristine ZnO nanoparticle films showed inferior interlayer thickness tolerance, when the thicknesses of the ZnO nanoparticle films increased from ∼30 nm to ∼100 nm, the average PCE values decreased from 7.01% to 5.61%. The better film thickness tolerance of PA-modified ZnO nanoparticle film stems from its higher conductivity, which is beneficial for large area device fabrication through the roll-to-roll process.

To investigate the interaction between PA and ZnO nanoparticles, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to compare the ZnO nanoparticle films with or without PA modification. AS shown in Fig. 3A–C, the binding energies of Zn 2p3/2 and O 1s of pristine ZnO nanoparticle film are located at 1020.6 eV and 530.5 eV, respectively, which correspond to the Zn–O bonds. The Zn 2p3/2 peak and O 1s peak of PA-modified ZnO nanoparticle (25% PA) films shift toward higher binding energies (1022.4 eV for Zn 2p3/2 and 532.3 eV for O 1s). We then speculate that the formation of the Zn–N and O–H bonds in the PA-modified ZnO nanoparticle films contributes to these binding energy shift.55 Thus, PA tends to complex with free Zn and O vacancies in ZnO nanoparticle films to passivate defects and improve film quality. To evaluate the influence of PA modification on the conductivities of ZnO nanoparticle films, we measured the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO or ZnO:PA/Ag. As shown in Fig. 3D, the conductivity (σ) can be calculated from the equation: I = σST−1V,56,57 where S is the area of the electrode (0.04 cm2) and T is the film thickness. When the thicknesses of the ZnO and ZnO:PA thin films were measured to be 33 nm and 54 nm, respectively, the corresponding conductivities of the ZnO and ZnO:PA (25%) thin films are 6 × 10−4 S m−1 and 1.4 × 10−3 S m−1. Thus, the PA modification dramatically increased the conductivity of the ZnO nanoparticle films, crucial for achieving thickness independent interlayer materials. We performed scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) measurements to detect the impact of PA modification on the work function (WF) of the ZnO nanoparticle films. As shown in Fig. 3E, PA modification decreased the WF of the ZnO nanoparticle film by 0.25 eV, with a uniform distribution of surface potential at the millimeter scale, indicating the excellent film forming properties of the modified ZnO nanoparticle film on ITO substrates. Such a WF reduction of the cathode is beneficial for enhancing the built-in potential (Vbi) and improving charge injection and extraction, thus increasing the VOC, JSC and FF of solar cell devices.

To study the influence of PA modification on the morphology and surface energy of the ZnO nanoparticle films, we conducted atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurements on the samples of ZnO nanoparticle films with or without PA modification (25%). As shown in Fig. 4A, the surface morphologies of the ZnO nanoparticle films with or without PA modification are essentially the same, showing a quite uniform and smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of about 3–4 nm, an indication of the excellent compatibility between the nucleobase polymer (PA) and ZnO nanoparticles. The contact angles of water on the top of ZnO, PA-modified ZnO, and PA films were approximately 32°, 69°, and 70°, respectively (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the PA-modified ZnO nanoparticle film is much more hydrophobic than the pristine ZnO nanoparticle films. Thus, the coating of PA-modified ZnO nanoparticle films on ITO substrates affords a more compatible interfacial contact with the active layers, since the active layer materials are generally hydrophobic organic semiconductors.

To explore the influence of PA modification on the electron injection capability of the ZnO nanoparticle films, we fabricated electron-only devices with the architecture of ITO/ZnO or ZnO:PA/PC71BM or Y6/ZnO or ZnO:PA/Ag (Fig. 5A and B). Devices with pristine ZnO and PC71BM active layer showed an electron mobility of 2.62 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, while integrating the PA-modified ZnO (25% PA) enhanced the electron mobility to 4.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Similar effects were found in devices containing Y6 active layer. The modification of ZnO with PA (25% PA) remarkably improved the electron mobility of the devices from 4.88 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This improvement originates from the reduction of the Schottky barrier at the ITO/PC71BM or Y6 interface by modifying the ZnO nanoparticle films with PA, which enhances the electron injection in organic electronics devices. We next measured VOC and JSC of the devices as a function of incident light intensity (P) to understand the impact of the pristine or modified ZnO (25% PA) nanoparticle films on charge recombination kinetics (Fig. 5C and D). The relationship between the VOC and the light intensity (P) is VOC ln(P)−1 ∝ nkbT q−1, where kb is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, and n is the ideality factor (1 <n < 2). It has been documented that bimolecular recombination is dominant when n tends to 1, and trap assisted recombination is dominant when n tends to 2.58 As shown in Fig. 5C, the slope of the device with pristine ZnO nanoparticle films is 1.55 kbT q−1, demonstrating the coexistence of trap assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination. By contrast, the devices with PA-modified ZnO (25% PA) nanoparticle films display a smaller slope of 1.22 kbT q−1, the n value is closer to 1, indicating that bimolecular recombination becomes predominant and trap assisted recombination is significantly decreased in devices. The relationship between the JSC and P can be described as JSC ∝ Pα. The exponential factor α represents the degree of bimolecular recombination. The closer the α value is to 1, the lesser is the occurrence of bimolecular recombination.59 As shown in Fig. 5D, the α value of the devices with pristine ZnO nanoparticle films is 0.976. Yet, the devices with PA-modified ZnO (25% PA) nanoparticle films give a higher α value of 0.990, which suggested a weaker bimolecular recombination. Consequently, the modification of ZnO nanoparticle films with PA suppressed trap assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination of the solar cell devices.

Conclusion
A nucleobase adenine (A)-based polymer (PA) was synthesized through RAFT polymerization. PA is quite efficient to passivate the defects, increase the conductivity, and decrease the work function (WF) of the ZnO nanoparticle films. The resultant ZnO:PA composite can work as a film thickness insensitive cathode interlayer in inverted OSCs, showing strong power on interfacial modification and energy level alignment at the device interface. PA-modified ZnO nanoparticle interlayers effectively suppress the charge recombination and reduce the Schottky barriers of solar cell devices, affording high performance fullerene- and non-fullerene-based OSCs over a wide interlayer thickness range, from ∼18 nm to ∼100 nm, with a maximum efficiency of 16.2%, which is among the highest efficiencies reported for inverted OSCs with a similar active layer.
Experimental
Synthesis

PA was synthesized through RAFT polymerization with a controlled molecular weight (Mn = 8.1 kDa, Mw/Mn = 1.10) as described previously (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†).48 The chemical synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles was performed using the method described in the literature.38,60 After purification, ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) to form a uniform solution.
Device fabrication and characterization
ITO substrates were cleaned through ultrasonication in detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol for 10 min, respectively. Then, the ITO substrates were dried in an oven overnight and treated with ultraviolet (UV)-ozone for 15 min. PA solutions in TFE were mixed with ZnO nanoparticles at different weight ratios and the resultant mixtures were stirred overnight. The pristine or PA-modified ZnO nanoparticle solutions were spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO substrates at 2500 rpm for 50 s in air without post treatment. For the fullerene-based active layer solution, a mixture of PTB7: PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w) was dissolved in chlorobenzene. 1,8-Diiodoctane (DIO) with 3% volume ratio was added and the mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 6 hours before use. For the non-fullerene-based active layer solution, a mixture of PM6:Y6 (1:1.2 w/w) was dissolved in chloroform with 0.5 vol% 1-chloronaphthalene. After transferring the as-prepared substrates to the glovebox (O2 < 1 ppm, H2O < 1 ppm), we spin-coated the PTB7:PC71BM or PM6:Y6 active layer solutions onto the as-prepared pristine or PA-modified nanoparticle layers at 2000 rpm for 60 s.
Then, the films were put in vacuum to remove solvent additives without thermal annealing. Next, the anode interlayer MoO3 was thermally evaporated (∼8 nm) onto the active layer at a pressure of 4 × 10−6 mbar. Finally, a 100 nm Ag anode was deposited by thermal-evaporation at the pressure of 1 × 10−6 mbar and the effective area of the device was 0.04 cm2. The I–V characteristics were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source-meter under simulated AM1.5G irradiation using a Class AAA solar simulator (SAN-EI Model: XES-40S3-TT). A solar cell QE tester (QE-R3011, ENLITECH) calibrated with a Xe lamp probe was used to obtain the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum.
