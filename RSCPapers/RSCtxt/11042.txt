The morphological evolution has been observed from dandelion TiO2 nanorod clusters to vertically aligned nanorod arrays while increasing the solution treatment time. A heterogeneous nucleation–dissolution–crystallization mechanism is proposed for the growth of the brookite structured TiO2 nanorod arrays on the inner walls of honeycomb monoliths. The brookite structured TiO2 nanorod arrays have a high surface area up to ~250 m2 g−1, with an overall specific surface area in the hybrid nanostructured monolith increasing by 1.8 and 2.5 times after TiO2 nanorods coating for 4 h and 24 h, respectively. The thermal stability tests using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and hydrothermal stability tests under boiling water for 24 h suggest that the TiO2 nanorods coated hybrid monoliths are very stable. An as-prepared 9-cm-long TiO2 nanorod-array monolithic device was demonstrated as a continuous flow fixed-bed absorbent with efficient performance in Rhodamine B removal from aqueous solution.IntroductionCeramic monoliths, as one of the most popular 3D support substrate, are installed in almost every vehicle and power plant as support substrates in stationary and automobile catalytic exhaust emission control devices as a result of their high inertness to undesired reactions, low pressure drop, and enhanced mechanical and thermal stability.1 However, usually the relatively low-surface-area monoliths will need a high surface area porous alumina particulate wash coat to help increase their surface area before or while loading the catalytically active materials such as noble metal nanoparticles. The intrinsically non-adherent particle-based wash coat may be easily subjected to high velocity flow erosion. The in situ grown nanostructured catalysts could enable enhanced thermal and mechanical robustness as well as improved catalytic efficiency.2As an important catalyst support, titania (TiO2) has been extensively studied. V2O5/TiO2 has been suggested as one of the better catalysts for NO reduction under NH3 for industrial power plants.1 Latest research results demonstrate that the addition of TiO2 to the conventional alumina wash coat support increases the NOx absorber catalysts' sulfur tolerance, which is very important to enhance the catalysts' performance and lifetime.3,4 TiO2 has three polymorphs of different symmetries, including anatase, rutile and brookite, all of which can be described in terms of distorted TiO6 octahedra with different symmetries or arrangements.5,6 Anatase and rutile structures have been extensively studied, while the brookite structure is much less studied due to its lack in natural TiO2 phases. Anatase TiO2 nanoparticles could be achieved with 200–300 m2 g−1 high surface area by hydrolysis of an organic titanium compound such as tetraisopropyl titanate in aqueous solution.1 Brookite or rutile structured TiO2 is normally believed to have low surface area compared to anatase TiO2 despite the higher thermal stability due to the difficulty for their fine structure synthesis.In addition to the nanoparticles form, TiO2 in the forms of nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes have attracted extensive attention in the past two decades as a result of their unique shape-dependent electronic and optical properties7–9 as well as their widespread applications in batteries,10 solar cells,11 sensors12 and catalysis.13 However, the crystal structure and symmetry of TiO2 make the growth of oriented anisotropic single-crystalline TiO2 films or nanorod arrays very difficult.14 To date, there are only a few reports that describe heterogeneous growth of oriented single-crystalline TiO2 nanorods or nanowires, but most growths are restricted to fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates.14,15 The growth process and mechanism of well-defined brookite TiO2 nanorod arrays on 3D monoliths with confined space are not well understood. In addition, most heterogeneous growths rely on vapor phase techniques utilizing heterogeneous nucleation at very high growth temperatures.16,17 Compared to the vapor deposition technique, solution-based methods are more suitable for low-cost commercial scale-up production.In this work, we report a simple hydrothermal synthesis procedure which allows the one-step, large scale anisotropic growth of aligned, crystalline brookite TiO2 nanorod arrays on the channel walls of 3D honeycomb monoliths. With the increase of hydrothermal treatment time, the brookite nanostructure morphology was identified to evolve from dispersive dandelion TiO2 nanorod clusters to vertically aligned nanorod arrays fully covered on the monolith substrate. Based on the observation of the growth process, a possible heterogeneous nucleation–dissolution–crystallization growth mechanism was proposed. The scale-up synthesis of TiO2 nanorod arrays inside the 3D honeycomb monoliths enables a new type of 3D hybrid nanostructured catalyst support, which shows a great potential as a continuous flow fixed-bed absorbent for waste water treatment. The new type of as-prepared monolithic device also holds the potential for applications in various areas including catalyst supports, particulate matter filters, and environmental remediation and separation devices.ExperimentalChemicalsThe dilute solution of TiCl3 (0.15 M) was supplied by Spectrum Chemical MFG. Corp. Sodium chloride (NaCl) was purchased from Fisher Scientific. All chemicals are used directly after purchase without further purification.Cordierite monolith substrates were supplied by Honda Research Institute (Columbus, OH).Preparation of TiO2 nanorod arrays on ceramic monolithsNanostructured brookite TiO2 was synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of aqueous titanium trichloride (TiCl3) solutions with saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) (concentration around 5 M). Typically, 20 ml of the precursor solution, including 2 ml of TiCl3 solution and 18 ml of deionized (DI) water saturated with NaCl, was placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave. Honeycomb cordierite monoliths were used as substrates and were put in the solutions. The solutions were then heated at 180 °C for 1–24 h. Then, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The honeycomb monoliths were taken out, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and allowed to dry on a hot plate at 80 °C.Organic dye contaminant removal from waterAdsorption tests were carried out using Rhodamine B (RhB) as the contaminant and TiO2 nanorod-array coated monolith in a fixed absorbent bed in a continuous flow system. In the experiments, 1 mg RhB was dissolved in 250 ml de-ionized (DI) water to make an organic dye contaminated water (8.4 × 10−6 M). 10 ml RhB/water was used for the demonstration experiment. A syringe pump was used to control the flow rate at 1 ml min−1. The absorbent bed contains 9 pieces of TiO2 nanorod array coated monoliths with a total length of 9 cm. The total space velocity is ~167 h−1. The concentration change of RhB solution after different numbers of treatment cycles was recorded by a UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer) to investigate the efficiency of the RhB removal process. All tests were carried out at room temperature, ~25 °C.CharacterizationThe morphologies of the synthesized TiO2 nanostructures were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JEOL 6335F Field Emission SEM) equipped with a Thermo Noran EDS detector, and by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; JEOL 2010 FasTEM). The crystal structures were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis with a Rigaku Mini Flex II Desktop X-ray Diffractometer. The BET surface area was characterized using a Quanta chrome Corporation NoVA 1000 Gas Sorption Analyzer and Micromeritics ASAP 2020 physisorption analyzer. The thermal stability of samples was investigated using a TA instruments SDT Q600.Results and discussionFig. 1 shows a set of optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of 3D cordierite monolith and the TiO2 nanorod arrays synthesized inside the monolith channels by hydrothermal treatment of aqueous titanium trichloride (TiCl3) solutions with saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) at 180 °C for 4 h. Fig. 1a and b display the top view cross section of the monolith. The monolith has a cell density of 400 cells per square inch with a wall thickness of ~0.1 mm. Fig. 1c shows the side view SEM images of the monolith. It can be clearly seen that the wall surface of the monolith is not a flat surface, but with a certain porosity. The EDS analysis reveals the monolith to be of Si, Mg, Al, and Nb. The grown TiO2 nanorods are highly aligned and densely packed on the monolith substrate with a diameter of ~50 nm and a length of ~250 nm (Fig. 1c and d). Fig. 1  Top view optical (a) and SEM (b) images of the honeycomb monolith. (c) Side view SEM images of the honeycomb monolith and the corresponding EDX spectrum. (d and e) SEM images of TiO2 nanorod arrays grown using 2 ml of TiCl3, and 18 ml of NaCl-saturated DI water at 180 °C for 4 h on the 3D honeycomb monolith. To investigate the growth behavior of TiO2 nanorods inside the 3D cordierite monolith, hydrothermal treatment times of 1, 1.5, 2, 4 and 24 h were applied and the evolution of TiO2 nanostructures was examined by SEM imaging analysis (Fig. 2). With 1 h growth time, no obvious TiO2 nanostructures grew on the wall surface of the monolith, as indicated in the SEM image in Fig. 2a. Prolonging the reaction time to 1.5 h, the TiO2 nanorod clusters were grown on the wall surface with a dandelion-like morphology with diameters in the range of 250–350 nm (Fig. 2b). The TiO2 nanorod clusters consisted of many close-packed TiO2 nanorods grown in a radial outwards direction. Further prolonging the reaction time to 2 h, the TiO2 nanorod clusters grew even bigger with diameters in the range of 400–500 nm (Fig. 2c). At high magnification (Fig. 2c), some nanorods in the TiO2 nanorod clusters grew longer than the others and clearly out of the dandelion-like sphere surface. More interestingly, some individual TiO2 nanorods directly grew out of the substrate surface as indicated by the boxes in Fig. 2c. When the reaction time increased to 4 h, highly aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays grew on the cordierite substrate surface. Fig. 2d shows the SEM image taken on an extremely rough surface of the substrate. It certainly confirmed the TiO2 nanorods grew everywhere on the monolith surface, even on the porous surface in the substrate. When further increasing the reaction time to 24 h, no obvious morphology change was observed on the TiO2 nanorod arrays. Fig. 2  SEM images of TiO2 nanostructures grown on 3D honeycomb monolith using 2 ml of TiCl3, and 18 ml of NaCl-saturated DI water at 180 °C for different times. (a) 1, (b) 1.5, (c) 2, (d) 4, and (e, f) 24 h. Single TiO2 nanorods were also found on the substrate surface when the hydrothermal treatment time is 2 h, as indicated by the boxes in (c). As shown by the low magnification SEM images in Fig. 3a and b, the TiO2 nanostructures dispersively grew on the monolith after hydrothermal treatment for 1.5 and 2 h (Fig. 3a and b), which confirms that the dandelion TiO2 nanorod clusters grow all over the substrate with a very uniform distribution. The TiO2 nanorods assembly and morphology were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 3c shows the low-resolution TEM image of a typical TiO2 nanorod cluster grown for 2 h. The dandelion-like sphere morphology and an out-grown TiO2 nanorod (indicated in the box) were clearly identified. The diameter of the single TiO2 nanorod is about 8–10 nm. The high-resolution TEM images in Fig. 3d and e revealed the body and top portions of the TiO2 nanorods, respectively. A clear set of lattice fringes was revealed with 0.34 nm spacing, suggesting the single crystalline nature of the grown TiO2 nanorods. The electron diffraction (ED) pattern (Fig. 3f) in a distinct ring form confirms the brookite structure of grown TiO2 nanorods after 2 h hydrothermal treatment. The lattice fringes spacing of 0.34 nm can be assigned to the interplanar distance of single crystalline brookite TiO2 (111).

(f) ED pattern of the TiO2 nanorod cluster. The distance between the lattice fringes in (d–e) is 0.34 nm, which can be assigned to brookite (111). Fig. 4a shows the low-resolution TEM image of TiO2 nanorods grown inside the 3D honeycomb monolith for 4 h. Compared with the TEM image of Fig. 3c, no TiO2 nanorod clusters were found when the hydrothermal treatment time was 4 h, indicating the conversion of dandelion-like TiO2 nanorod clusters into aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays. Fig. 4b and c show the high-resolution TEM images of the body and top portions of a typical TiO2 nanorod. The atomic planes corresponding to (111) are clearly visible with the same interplanar distance of 0.34 nm, suggesting the single crystalline nature of the brookite TiO2 nanorods grown after hydrothermal treatment for 4 h.

(b, c) High-resolution TEM image of the body portion and top portion of one grown TiO2 nanorod, respectively. The brookite crystal structure of the grown TiO2 nanorods at different hydrothermal treatment times was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of the bare honeycomb monolith and the synthesized TiO2 nanostructures inside the honeycomb monolith. Since the honeycomb monolith is a mixed oxide cordierite of SiO2, MgO, Al2O3 and Nb2O5, some characteristic peaks of the honeycomb monolith overlap with the diffraction peaks of brookite TiO2. As shown in Fig. 5, when the hydrothermal time is less than 4 h, no obvious TiO2 diffraction peaks appeared in the corresponding XRD pattern, although the TiO2 nanorod clusters were obtained on the substrate surface according to the SEM imaging (Fig. 3a and b). This might be due to their dispersive distribution (Fig. 2b and c), and the extremely strong intensity from the exposed monolith substrate. Fig. 5  XRD patterns of (a) the honeycomb monolith, and the samples of TiO2 nanorods grown inside the 3D honeycomb monolith prepared at 180 °C for (b) 1.5, (c) 2, (d) 4, and (e) 24 h. However, with increasing hydrothermal time, the weakening intensities from the substrate is accompanied by the enhanced intensities from the brookite TiO2. As the hydrothermal treatment time increased to 4 h, two weak peaks appeared at about 25.4° and 25.7° corresponding to brookite (120) and (111), respectively (JCPDS No. 00-029-1360), which do not overlap with any diffraction peaks of the substrate. As the hydrothermal treatment time further increased to 24 h, the peaks in brookite (120) and (111) became more significant with higher intensities than those of substrate, suggesting a complete coverage of TiO2 nanorod arrays on monolith as well as the further improved crystallinity.Brookite TiO2 with different morphologies has been reported in the literature. For example, Cozzoli et al. synthesized anisotropically shaped brookite TiO2 nanocrystals using a surfactant-assisted nonaqueous strategy.18 A self-regulated phase-switching seed-catalyzed mechanism was proposed to explain the heterogeneous nucleation of brookite TiO2 on the initially generated c-axis-elongated anatase TiO2, and the anatase-to-brookite conversion. Sun et al. prepared high-quality brookite TiO2 flowers in the presence of NaOH by a solution chemistry technique.19 They proposed three steps for the synthesis of flower-like brookite TiO2: (1) the transformation of layer structured titanate into brookite nanoparticles, (2) the evolution of brookite particles to the spindle-like shape, and (3) the assembly of these spindle-like particles into flower-like TiO2. Obviously, the formation of the aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays on the 3D honeycomb monolith could be different from these mechanisms. According to our time-dependent morphology evolution evidence (Fig. 2–4), we could hypothesize that the formation of multi-nanostructures and morphology evolution from dandelion TiO2 nanorod clusters to aligned nanorod arrays can be rationally expressed as a heterogeneous nucleation–dissolution–crystallization mechanism (Scheme 1). Generally, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) or titanium alkoxides (Ti(OR)4) are used as a titanium source to synthesize TiO2. However, the reaction rate of Ti(IV) in forming TiO2 is too fast. A high degree of supersaturation is obtained due to the production of many nuclei in the solution, which accelerates the homogeneous nucleation to produce TiO2 nanoparticles. In our study, a low degree of supersaturation was achieved by using TiCl3 as the titanium precursor due to the slow oxidation of Ti(III) by dissolved oxygen. Scheme 1  As-proposed TiO2 heterogeneous nucleation–dissolution–crystallization growth mechanism. The low degree of supersaturation promotes the heterogeneous nucleation of TiO2 on the wall surface of the honeycomb monolith.20,21 Furthermore, a high concentration of chlorine ions in the solution helps the formation of brookite TiO2, and also avoids the conversion of brookite into rutile after prolonging the hydrothermal treatment time.22 The brookite structure was obtained at the very beginning of the reaction (Fig. 3) and prolonging the reaction time from 4 h to 24 h does not change the brookite structure but improves its crystallinity (Fig. 5). With the increase in hydrothermal time, the hydrothermal conditions changed into more acidic, which might make the not well-crystallized TiO2 nanorods dissolve and the dissolved TiO2 in the solution might nucleate onto the existing nanorods, which is confirmed by the change of TiO2 morphology from closely packed nanorod clusters to sparsely aligned arrays.To investigate the thermal stability of TiO2 nanorod arrays coated hybrid monolith substrates, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were carried out in ambient conditions. The TGA and DSC curves are plotted in Fig. 6. Blank honeycomb monolith substrate is very stable over the whole investigated temperature range. During the thermal analysis, different samples exhibit different degrees of weight loss. TiO2 samples grown for 1.5 and 2 h show a similar weight loss with less than 1% in total. That is possibly due to their similar cluster morphology and relatively low density distribution. TiO2 nanorod arrays grown for 4 h have less than 2% weight loss, while the TiO2 nanorod arrays grown for 24 h have the highest weight loss of 3.5%. However, the highest weight loss is just about 3%, which suggests that TiO2 nanorods arrays on the honeycomb monolith substrates are very stable in the temperature range of 20–800 °C. Fig. 6  TGA (a) and DSC (b) spectra of TiO2 nanorods grown inside the 3D honeycomb monolith prepared at 180 °C for 1.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 24 h. The weight loss in the temperature range of 40–250 °C, about 2% for the sample grown for 24 h, is attributed to the evaporation of H2O absorbed in the TiO2 nanorods arrays. The peak at 700–800 °C might be contributed by the phase transition of TiO2 nanorods from brookite structure to rutile structure. Clearly, the main weight loss is contributed by the loss of H2O absorbed on TiO2. All DSC data exhibit almost the same plot, further proving that the main mass loss is caused by loss of H2O.To further investigate the thermal stability of TiO2 nanorod arrays coated hybrid monolith substrates, isothermal annealing was conducted on as-prepared samples at 800 °C for 24 h. Mass loss vs. time spectra shown in Fig. 7a depicts the in situ weight change in the isothermal process. After less than 2% weight loss, which has been proved by TGA–DSC tests to be the evaporation of absorbed H2O on hybrid monolith substrate, there is almost no weight loss during the 800 °C isothermal annealing in air. Morphology after the high temperature aging was also investigated by SEM. As shown in Fig. 7b, the nanorod array structure was retained very well with no observable morphology change for the individual nanorods. Moreover, there is also no obvious crack on the coated TiO2 nanorod array in the large area under lower magnification. All the isothermal aging test results confirmed that the as-prepared TiO2 nanorod arrays coated hybrid monolith substrates have very high thermal stability in air.

In the real world application, surface coating layers are inevitably exposed to humidity in the environment, contacting with either liquid water or steam. The hydrothermal stability of TiO2 nanorod arrays coated hybrid monolith substrates at extreme conditions will be very helpful to evaluate the steam-related stability. In our experiments, we put TiO2 nanorod arrays coated hybrid monolith substrates directly into a sealed autoclave filled with half volume of DI water. Then, we put the autoclave into an oven and sustained the temperature at 120 °C for 24 h after reaching 120 °C at a ramp rate of 1 °C per minute. The morphology of TiO2 nanorod arrays after hydrothermal aging are displayed in Fig. 7c and Fig. 7d, which clearly show the densely packed and uniform nanorod array. It proved that the TiO2 nanorod arrays coated hybrid monolith substrates are quite stable at extreme hydrothermal conditions and show great promise for steam-related applications.To further investigate the structural stability of TiO2 nanorod arrays during the harsh thermal and hydrothermal treatments, the XRD spectra were compared for the fresh sample, 800 °C isothermal aging sample and 120 °C hydrothermal aging sample. Fig. 7e revealed the characteristic peaks at 25.4°, 25.7° and 30.8°, matching to brookite TiO2 (120), (111) and (121) respectively (JCPDS No. 00-029-1360), which were retained very well after the 24 h high temperature thermal and hydrothermal aging. The XRD spectra directly proved the good thermal and hydrothermal stability of the as-prepared single crystal brookite TiO2 nanorod array on cordierite monolith.In the meantime, we investigated the specific BET surface area of TiO2 nanorod arrays on honeycomb monolith grown for different times (Table 1). In our experiment, TiO2 nanostructures grown for 1.5 h have the lowest BET surface area. That may be caused by the lowest coverage of TiO2 nanorod clusters on the monolith substrate. BET surface area of TiO2 nanostructures grown for 2 h is a little bit larger than that of the sample synthesized for 1.5 h. This could be attributed by the higher aspect ratio of single nanorod grown out of the nanoclusters and higher TiO2 coverage on the monolith. Though having similar nanorod array structure, the BET surface area of the TiO2 nanostructure grown for 24 h is bigger than the sample grown for 4 h, which is because of the larger aspect ratio of TiO2 nanorods with increasing growth time. As shown in Table 1, the specific surface area of honeycomb monolith substrate increases after the deposition of TiO2 nanorods. With the increasing growth time, the surface area increases drastically. It is worth noting that the grown TiO2 nanorod arrays has a specific surface area as high as ~240 m2 g−1, ~3 times higher than the normal hydrolysis-derived anatase TiO2 nanoparticles.23–25

 Blank substrateTiO2 substrate (1.5 h)TiO2 substrate (2 h)TiO2 substrate (4 h)TiO2 substrate (24 h)HCl control samplea Surface area (with substrate) is experimental data collected by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000, while BET surface area (without substrate) is estimated data which was calculated from the surface area (with substrate) by subtracting the contribution of monolith substrate. The calculation was performed according to the following rule: a) Assuming TiCl3 was completely converted into TiO2 grown on the substrate; b) For growth time shorter than 4 h, the TiO2 nanorods array did not completely cover the substrate from SEM, so S = (STiO2 substrate × mTiO2 substrate − SBlank substrate × mTiO2 substrate)/mTiO2; c) For growth time longer than 4 h, TiO2 nanorods array completely covered the substrate from SEM, so S = STiO2 substrate × mTiO2 substrate/mTiO2.Surface area (m2 g−1, with substrate)0.30.58.644.158.80.2Surface area (m2 g−1, without substrate)a0034.9184.2245.60As it is demonstrated, during the TiO2 growth process, the precursor solution is very acidic with the pH value of ~1. It is reasonable to infer that after in situ growing the TiO2 nanorod array, the increment of surface area may arise from two factors: 1) the surface area of coated TiO2 nanorod array; 2) the net surface area increase of monolith substrate due to the acidic environment in TiO2 nanorod array growth. To shed light on the origin of the high surface area, control experiments were conducted by using HCl, NaCl and water as precursors. In the control experiments, the pH value was controlled as the theoretical value of TiCl3 totally decomposed in the TiO2 nanorod array growth process by adding HCl drop by drop. BET surface area was tested after complete drying of controlled samples overnight on an 80 °C hotplate. The BET surface area falls into the range below 1 m2 g−1 and is around 0.2 m2 g−1. It suggests that the surface area change induced by the acid etching during TiO2 nanorod array growth is negligible. We can conclude that the main contributor of the high surface area monolithic device is the high surface area TiO2 nanorod array grown on it.With the characteristic of ultra-high surface area, the as-prepared catalytically active TiO2 nanorod arrays on monolith might serve as an efficient absorbent in environmental remediation applications.13 Furthermore, the merit of low pressure drop for monolithic devices enables its usage in a continuous flow system, which is more applicable in realistic large scale water treatment processes due to its low operating cost and good adaptability to versatile processes such as waste pipelines of industrial plants.26 To confirm this potential, a proof-of-concept demonstration was carried out for the TiO2 nanorod array coated monolith to be used as an absorbent device for water treatment using Rhodamine B (RhB) as the organic dye contaminant in water. Fig. 8a illustrates the experimental setup for monolith-based fixed bed absorbents in a continuous flow treatment system. Specifically, in the lab scale demonstration, 10 ml RhB solution (8.4 × 10−6 M) flowed through the TiO2 nanorod array coated monolithic absorbent bed with the flow rate of 1 ml min−1, as controlled by a syringe pump (Fig. 8b). The monolithic absorbent bed is composed of 9 pieces of vertically aligned monoliths with a length of 9 cm and cross-sectional area of 0.04 cm2, and the space velocity is around 167 h−1 during the test. The UV-vis absorption peak intensity of RhB solution decreases with the increasing number of treatment cycles, with 45% of the original intensity after 12 cycles (Fig. 8d). As a control sample, the bare monolithic substrate was also tested under the same experimental conditions. No concentration change (Fig. 8e) was detected throughout the 12-cycle absorption treatment on the bare cordierite monolith sample. This suggests no absorption of RhB on bare monolith. However, a significant absorption was observed on the TiO2 nanorod array coated monolith sample. The concentration of RhB solution drops quickly at the first 5 cycles, while the absorption after 5 cycles is slower than the first 5 cycles but the saturation is not reached even after 12 cycle treatments, proving its potential as a highly efficient absorbent for industrial waste after treatment including, but not limited to, water treatment.

ConclusionsIn summary, single crystalline brookite TiO2 nanorod arrays were grown uniformly on the inner walls of a 3D honeycomb monolith by a hydrothermal approach. The evolution of TiO2 nanorod clusters to TiO2 nanorod arrays were observed while changing the hydrothermal treatment time. Slow oxidation of Ti(III) to Ti(IV) results in the maintenance of a low degree of supersaturation, which promotes the heterogeneous nucleation of brookite TiO2 on the wall surface of the honeycomb monolith. In addition, the presence of excess Cl− helps the formation of brookite TiO2 and maintains the brookite crystal structure. The synthesized TiO2 nanorods-based hybrid monolithic devices have high surface area and good thermal and hydrothermal stability. A proof-of-concept TiO2 nanorod-array coated monolithic device was demonstrated with a promising performance as a continuous flow fixed-bed absorbent in water treatment. The ultra-high surface area and excellent stability make the as-prepared TiO2 nanorod array monolithic devices promising for use in various energy and environmental applications such as emission control, industrial filtering, purification, and separation.AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful for the financial support from the UConn New Faculty start-up funds, and the DOE/National Energy Technology Laboratory (Award number: DE-EE0000210).Notes and referencesC.
