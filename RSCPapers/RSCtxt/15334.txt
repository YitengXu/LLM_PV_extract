    , Accepted 27th June 2014First published on 3rd July 2014AbstractHere, we report a highly conducting 1-dimensionally (1-D) aligned polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) along the inner and outer surfaces of a hollow carbon nanofiber (CNF) and its application as a counter electrode in a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The hybrid material (CP-25) displays a conversion efficiency of 7.16% compared to 7.30% for the standard Pt counter electrode, 4.48% for bulk PEDOT and 5.56% for CNF. The enhanced conversion efficiency of CP-25 is attributed to the accomplishment of high conductivity and surface area of PEDOT through the 1-D alignment compared to its bulk counterpart. Reduced charge transfer resistance and high conductivity of CP-25 could be proven by cyclic voltammetry, impedance analysis and Tafel experiments. Further, through a long-term stability test involving efficiency profiling for 20 days, it is observed that CP-25 possesses excellent durability compared to the bulk PEDOT.
1. Introduction
A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC)1 is promising over current silicon-based photovoltaic cells in terms of its low cost, easy fabrication and moderate energy conversion efficiency (∼12%). In a typical DSSC, the key reactions are photo-induced oxidation of the dye which is coated on a polycrystalline TiO2 at the anode and regeneration of the dye to its original state using iodide/tri-iodide (I−/I3−) redox species at the cathode. The tri-iodide (I3−) generated at the photo-anode requires a highly active catalyst to convert it back to I− at the cathode by collecting electrons from the outer circuit to complete the cycle. Hence, a highly efficient and stable counter electrode catalyst is very critical for achieving competent DSSC systems. The best known catalyst for the counter electrode is precious platinum (Pt) which possesses high catalytic activity and high corrosion resistance. However, the high cost of Pt metal and high energy required for the Pt electrode preparation through sputtering/thermal evaporation make Pt a non-viable choice for commercial applications.2 Thus, the replacement of Pt with a cheaper and abundant, but at the same time, highly active, stable and easily processable catalyst material is critical for improving the prospects of commercialization of DSSC. Among various conducting alternatives for a Pt catalyst, carbonaceous materials and polymers are promising over other metal compounds2–5 like metal sulphides,6–8 metal nitrides,4,9 metal carbide4 and metal oxides,4,10 owing to their low cost. One of the earliest reports on the use of carbonaceous materials as a counter electrode was in 1996 by Grätzel et al., who used conductive graphite powder and carbon black to ease the DSSC module processability.11 Other noteworthy reports in this direction include the activated carbon based counter electrode by Murata et al.12 and the mesoporous carbon aerogel based counter electrode by Tan et al.13 Other carbon materials like carbon-nanotubes (CNTs),9,14–18 carbon-nanofibers (CNFs),19,20 graphene,21–24 and heteroatom-doped carbons25 are also promising due to their high conductivities and surface areas. However, poor catalytic activity,9,15,23,24 corrosion and processability issues result in diminished efficiency and stability of carbon materials compared to Pt.26 On the other hand, polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT)27 is a promising counter electrode28–31 material compared to polyaniline32–35 because of its unique properties such as high catalytic activity for I3− reduction,31 low cost, and high-conductivity.36 However, low conductivity as well as the surface area in its bulk form results in poor catalytic activity. Low conductivity and surface area in the bulk synthesized PEDOT occur mainly due to the fast polymerization rate of PEDOT.37 Such fast polymerization results in aggregated polymer grains which may precipitate out in the medium. In such cases, processability will become difficult due to the low solubility of PEDOT. To address the above issues, nano-structuring of conducting polymers is known to be an excellent alternative to improve the electrical conductivity and surface area.38 Apart from this, a 1-D polymer possesses easy ion transport ability which helps to achieve low charge transfer resistance, and, therefore, results in improved catalytic activity towards the I−/I3− reaction. In the literature, few reports are available on such 1-D nanostructured conducting polymers39,40 for DSSC counter electrodes. However, the need for hard and soft templates in the synthetic part makes the strategy less viable. Similar to bulk PEDOT, nanostructured PEDOT also shows degradation in conductivity41 due to humidity under ambient conditions. This instability towards humidity makes it difficult to achieve stable photovoltaic performance.
Here, we developed a synthetic strategy of PEDOT in order to overcome its drawbacks such as fast polymerisation rate, low conductivity, low surface area, humidity sensitivity, and low stability. We have achieved 1-D aligning of PEDOT over a high aspect ratio carbon nanofiber (CNF) of diameter ∼50–70 nm and length of several micrometres (Scheme 1). In a previous report,42 we had disclosed high conductivity and surface area of the above hybrid material which leads to enhanced charge-storage properties. The inner diameter (20–30 nm) of CNF is sufficient for the solvent and monomer to pass through, which is otherwise not possible in other 1-D carbon materials like CNT and electrospun carbon fibers. It should be noted that the 1-D nanostructure of PEDOT aligned with the help of hollow CNF is quite different from the simple composites of PEDOT and carbon morphologies.43–46 The CNF, selected here, itself shows high conductivity, catalytic activity and sufficient inner as well as outer space which can be utilized for polymer anchoring. Consequently, the PEDOT-coated CNF resulted in high catalytic activity towards the tri-iodide reduction and, hence, delivered a power conversion efficiency of 7.16% with higher stability compared to a polymer in which bulk PEDOT was used.

2. Experimental section
Materials
Carbon nanofiber (CNF) used as the solid template was purchased from Pyrograf Corporation, USA. Ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and FeCl3 were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals. Acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were procured from Rankem Chemicals. All the chemicals were used as received without any further purification. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter paper (pore size, 0.45 μm; Rankem) was used for the filtration. Copper grids with carbon support (Icon Analytical) were used for the HR-TEM observations. A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass electrode with 15 Ω sheet resistances purchased from Solaronix (TCO22-15) was used as a substrate for counter and working electrodes.
PEDOT–FCNF composite preparation
Materials were prepared by using a method reported by our group.42 In a typical experiment, CNF was functionalized by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment. 100 mg of the functionalized CNF was dispersed in 20 ml of acetonitrile using a probe sonicator in a 100 ml round bottom flask. 25 mg of EDOT (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), in 20 ml acetonitrile was added drop-wise to the above solution and the mixture was kept under vigorous stirring for 24 h at room temperature. The oxidizing agent, anhydrous FeCl3 (at 1:4 molar ratio to the monomer) in acetonitrile (20 ml), was added drop-wise to the above mixture followed by stirring for 48 h, then filtering and washing. The solid mass obtained was kept overnight at 100 °C in an oven for drying. The obtained material is named as CP-25 as it contained 25% PEDOT determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Materials with different compositions were also prepared by varying the amount EDOT and CNF. For comparison, bulk PEDOT was also synthesized from EDOT using the above procedure without CNF.
Counter electrode preparation
An FTO plate was washed by ultra-sonication in soap solution, deionized water and absolute ethanol and 0.5 cm2 of the area was confined by adhesive spacer. 3 mg of the sample was dispersed well in 500 μl DMSO using mortar and pestle, and 25 μl of the above solution was drop-coated onto the confined area of the FTO plate. Electrodes were dried overnight at 100 °C under vacuum. Two such electrodes were sandwiched together for the symmetric cell experiments by facing each other and keeping an adhesive tape piece as a spacer. The electrolyte composition was 1 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine in 1:1 (v:v) acetonitrile and valeronitrile mixed solvent. All the electrolyte components except DMPII were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) fabrication
Standard P25 paste was prepared using a reported method.47 FTO substrates for the working electrode were washed by ultra-sonication in soap solution, deionized water and absolute ethanol. The P25 paste was doctor-bladed on the washed FTO plate and the plate was heated at 450 °C for 10 min. A thickness of 12–13 microns was achieved by multiple coatings. The final annealing was done for 1 h. TiCl4 treatment on the working electrodes was done according to a reported method47 and the electrodes were reheated at 450 °C for 30 min. The working electrodes were socked in 0.5 mM N719 dye solution overnight. DSSCs were assembled using a sandwich assembly of the working electrode and counter electrode. The electrolyte composition was 1 M DMPII, 0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine. I–V (current vs. voltage) measurements were done by using a Newport Solar Simulator attached to a Keithley 2420 source meter. In order to check the stability of the counter electrode for the best case scenario, we sealed the working and counter electrode using Surlyn.
Characterization
High-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HR-TEM) imaging was carried out using Tecnai-T30 at an accelerated voltage of 300 kV. The surface morphology was analyzed using Nova Nano SEM 450. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted using a Philips X'pert pro powder X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, Ni filter). Electrical conductivity was measured using a four-probe conductivity method at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), impedance analysis and Tafel experiments were carried out using Bio-Logic SP-300. CV was done in distilled acetonitrile containing 0.1 M LiClO4, 5 mM LiI and 0.5 mM I2 under an N2 atmosphere. A 3-electrode setup was used for CV in which the prepared counter electrode for DSSC was used as the working electrode and Pt wire which was internally calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium(Fc/Fc+) couple was used as the reference electrode. Pt foil was used as the counter electrode. Tafel measurements were done in a symmetrical cell in which the potential was polarised from −1 to +1 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Impedance analysis was carried out from 106 to 0.1 Hz frequency sweep against the open circuit potential with a sinusoidal amplitude of 10 mV (Vrms = 7.07 mV). Impedance data was fitted using EC-Lab Software V10.19. Electrical conductivity measurements were done using a four-probe conductivity meter having a probe spacing of 0.2 mm.
3. Results and discussion
Polymerisation of bulk PEDOT starts very fast in the presence of the oxidising agent FeCl3 and the reaction completes within ∼10–20 min.48 Whereas, in the presence of CNF, the polymerisation rate becomes slow and, hence, it takes longer time for completion. This is due to the π–π interaction between the functionalised CNF and EDOT monomers which restricts the motion and thus retards the polymerisation rate. Thus, such confined monomers and slow rate of polymerisation help in the formation of a thin film over CNF rather than the polymerisation in bulk. This is essential because the fast polymerisation results in a mixture of 1-D aligned polymer and bulk PEDOT.
The microstructural feature of the above materials was examined using TEM. The image of a bare CNF as shown in Fig. 1a reveals a hollow tubular nature with a cup-stacked structure on the inner wall. The inner diameter of the tube is around 60 nm whereas the total diameter is approximately 120 nm. CNF possesses a highly graphitised outer layer (Fig. 1b) which was activated via oxidative functionalization by H2O2 treatment for easy anchoring of the monomer. On the other hand, due to the presence of slanting graphene layers which terminate along the inner wall, the inner side of the tube is inherently active. Fig. 1c and d show the TEM images of CP-25, in which, a thin layer of PEDOT (10–15 nm thickness at outside) is coated along the inner and outer surfaces of CNF. The PEDOT inside the hollow CNF is found to be porous from the TEM images. The formation of the porous matrix of PEDOT along the inner wall of CNF is caused by evaporation of the trapped solvent inside the CNF. The continuous porosity of the polymer layer inside CNF plays a vital role for the easy movement of the redox species present in the electrolyte. Even though evidence for the surface area improvement in the composites is visible from TEM, quantification on this is obtained from Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurements. CP-25 shows a surface area of 23 m2 g−1 compared to 5 m2 g−1 for its bulk counterpart (Fig. S1 in ESI†). This is expected due to the porous nature of PEDOT in the composites along the high aspect ratio backbone of CNF, which is having a surface area of 5 m2 g−1.

FE-SEM imaging is used to observe the surface morphology of the counter electrodes. Fig. 2 corresponds to the FESEM images taken at the surface of a counter electrode prepared from CNF, PEDOT and CP-25. Surfaces of CNF and the composite in Fig. 2a and b are more porous than that of the bulk PEDOT. CNF and CP-25 show almost similar morphology even though a distinction between the polymer and carbon entities is difficult due to the lack of contrast difference. The presence of bulk PEDOT outside the CNF surface is negligible in the case of CP-10 (Fig. S2a, ESI†) and CP-25. In the case of the composites with even higher loading of PEDOT such as CP-40 and CP-60 (Fig. S2b and c†), the PEDOT phase is distinct and is clearly visible separately from the CNF surface. Thus, in CP-40 and CP-60, higher concentration of PEDOT leads to deviation from the expected core-shell morphology. Arrow marked portions in Fig. S2b† show the part of bulk PEDOT present in the composites. Higher concentration of the EDOT monomer during the synthesis, as in the case of CP-40 and CP-60, enhances the chance of polymerisation outside the CNF surface at a faster rate compared to CP-10 and CP-25. The deviation from the core-shell morphology of the composite for PEDOT loading beyond 25% has profound effects on the conductivity. For instance, lower four-probe electrical conductivity is observed in the case of CP-40 (26.3 S cm−1) and CP-60 (8 S cm−1) when compared to CP-25 (35 S cm−1) (Table S1†, ESI). It should be noted that bulk PEDOT and CNF show conductivity values of 1.5 and 2.2 S cm−1, respectively. Thus, 25% loading of PEDOT seems to give optimum conductivity among the other compositions which can be understood on the basis of template-mediated ordered polymerization of PEDOT over CNF.49 It has been observed that template-assisted synthesis of conducting polymers49–51 leading to fibrous structures possesses high electrical conductivity compared to their bulk counterparts. This feature was explained by various research groups49 on the basis of results obtained by polarized infrared absorption spectroscopy (PIRAS). The PIRAS study points towards formation of well-ordered polymer chains leading to higher conjugation length and hence high electrical conductivity in the case of the template-assisted growth. In the case of bulk PEDOT, the fast polymerization rate results in the formation of disordered polymer chains resulting in decreased conjugation length and low conductivity.49 The presence of CNF however lowers the rate of polymerization of PEDOT and also facilitates the growth of polymer chains in the direction along the axis of the pores of CNF. This preferential orientation along the pore axis (i.e., along the length) brings an order in the polymer chain which enhances the π conjugation length leading to higher electrical conductivity in the case of CP when compared to bulk PEDOT and pristine-CNF. This is also experimentally supported by the IV measurements of the material coated in between the two FTO plates as shown in Fig. 3a. It clearly illustrates the higher conductivity in the case of CP samples. The electrical conductivity of CP-25 is higher compared to CP-10 because of the higher amount of the ordered PEDOT. However, in the case CP-40 and CP-60, PEDOT is also seen to polymerize outside the CNF surface (Fig. S2, ESI†) leading to departure from the conformal core-shell architecture which makes the CP-40's and CP-60's electronic character to lean towards the bulk PEDOT character. This is because of the large proportion of disorders in the polymer matrix of CP-40 and CP-60, which lead to further decrease in conductivity with loading as compared to CP-25.

To examine the long term stability towards conductivity, the conductivity of the materials was evaluated at different time intervals. PEDOT is known to show degradation in conductivity with exposure to the atmosphere.41Fig. 3b shows the data corresponding to the conductivity evaluation as a function of time for different combinations of PEDOT and CNF. Bulk PEDOT degrades to 1/4 of its initial conductivity within 18 days whereas composites CP-15 and CP-25 retain 3/4 of their initial conductivities within the same duration. Such enhanced stability will help the material to deliver consistent efficiency for longer duration and can avoid expensive handling technologies needed for such a humidity-sensitive material.
Raman spectra and XRD (Fig. S3†) provide strong evidence for the interaction between the carbon surface of CNF and PEDOT in the composite. A strong peak at 26.20° obtained in the XRD spectra of CNF and CP samples corresponds to the well-known (002) graphitic plane (Fig. S3b†). A broad peak positioned at 25.80° in the case of the bulk PEDOT is due to the (020) reflection along with the small intensity peaks (6.20, 9.47 and 14.50°).52,53 In the case of the CP systems, the (002) graphitic peak at 26.20° overlaps with the PEDOT's prominent peak at 25.80° which also results in the increase of full width at half maximum (FWHM) from 0.57° for CNF to 0.67° for CP-25. However, the second prominent peak at a 2θ value of 6.20° is strong enough to prove the presence of PEDOT.
Raman spectra (Fig. S3a†) are dominated by D, G and 2D bands in the case of CNF and CP-25, and are positioned at around 1320, 1564 and 2641 cm−1, respectively. Evidence for functionalization of CNF has been proven by the change in the intensity ratio of ID and IG (i.e., ID/IG) from 0.30 to 0.39 after the functionalization.53 The strong interaction of PEDOT with the carbon surface is also supported by the change in the position of the G band in the case of CP-25 to 1571 cm−1 from the original position of 1564 cm−1 for FCNF. This positive shift indicates the electronic interaction of S+ of the PEDOT matrix with the carbon network of FCNF.54 The intense peak at 1430 and 1507 cm−1 indicates the Cα = Cβ symmetric stretching and Cβ = Cβ1 stretching bands of PEDOT, which provides valid evidence of the doped state.55 The above peak is clearly visible in the case of CP-25.
Higher surface area and conductivity of CP-25 as compared to CNF and PEDOT are expected to help the hybrid samples to display improved catalytic activity towards the reduction of tri-iodide species to iodide at the counter electrode which is represented as, I3−(sol) + 2e− → 3 I−(sol)(1)where sol indicates the acetonitrile solution which is generally used as the solvent to make the DSSC electrolyte.
In order to investigate the electro-catalytic activity of the counter electrode materials, we have carried out cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M LiClO4 electrolyte containing 5 mM LiI and 0.5 mM I2. A 3-electrode setup was used for the CV measurements in which the prepared counter electrode for DSSC was used as the working electrode and Pt wire which was internally calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium(Fc/Fc+) couple was used as the reference electrode. Pt foil was used as the counter electrode. Fig. 4a shows the CV profiles of CNF, CP-25 and PEDOT recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
 Fig. 4  (a) CV profiles recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and (b) plots showing the relationship between the peak current density and square root of the scan rate. 
Performances of the above samples are compared with the standard Pt counter electrode on the FTO plate.
The typical cyclic voltammogram shows the reduction–oxidation peaks at negative potentials vs. Fc/Fc+ which are assigned to reduction and oxidation peaks for the I3−/I− couple as clearly depicted in Fig. 4a. The second redox peak observed at the positive potential corresponds to the I2/I3− couple. The important parameters which determine the electrochemical catalytic activity of the counter electrode are the potential difference between the reduction and oxidation peaks of the I3−/I− couple as denoted by Epp and the peak reduction current density as indicated by Ip.56 The catalytic activity is negatively correlated with the magnitude of Epp and directly with the current density Ip. CP-25 shows an Epp of 0.27 mV which is very low compared to the Epp values of 0.34 mV for bulk PEDOT and 0.97 mV for CNF which clearly indicates the superior catalytic activity of CP-25 when compared to the bulk PEDOT and pristine-CNF. This is further supported by the comparison of the reduction current density Ip among CP-25, PEDOT and CNF. Note that in all the cases, the background current is subtracted to get the pure reduction current for appropriate comparison of Ip. Due to its higher catalytic activity, CP-25 shows an Ip of 1 mA cm−2 compared to 0.70 mA cm−2 for bulk PEDOT and 0.58 mA cm−2 for CNF. In comparison with the catalytic activity of Pt (Epp is 0.34 mV), CP-25 shows superiority in terms of its lower Epp value even though Pt retains an edge in terms of its high Ip (1.16 mA cm−2) value compared to CP-25. Thus, the CV results clearly indicate the superior catalytic activity of CP-25 over its constituent components (CNF and PEDOT) and it is interesting to find out that the performance is even comparable to Pt. The CV profiles of CNF, PEDOT, Pt and CP-25 at different scan rates are given in ESI.† To understand the effect of 1-D confinement on the catalytic activity, CV of different composites is also carried out and the corresponding voltammograms are given in Fig. S4 in ESI.† With the increase of the amount of PEDOT, Epp increases in the order of CP-25 (0.272 mV) < CP-40 (0.324 mV) < CP-60 (0.329 mV). Epp of CP-10 (0.882 mV) is found to be higher than that of CP-25 (0.272 mV) due to the very low amount of PEDOT which is not sufficient for the catalytic activity in a system containing higher amount of the less active CNF. As it can be seen from the FE-SEM images, perfect 1-D confinement is destroyed beyond CP-25 which results in lower conductivity and more bulk-like characteristics. Thus, the higher Epp values of the samples with a PEDOT loading beyond 25% can be ascribed to the lower electrical conductivity as well as to the high charge transport resistance of such samples. Fig. 4b shows that the square root of the scan rate has a linear relationship with the cathodic peak current density in the case of CP-25, Pt and CNF. Such a linear relationship indicates the involvement of a diffusion limited reaction and absence of any interaction of ionic species with the catalyst during the adsorption.57 On the other hand, in the case of bulk PEDOT, the high charge-transfer resistance makes slow ion movement especially at a higher scan rate, which leads to deviation from the linear relationship. The CV profiles taken at different scan rates are given in Fig. S5, ESI.†
To reconfirm the superior catalytic activity of CP-25 towards the tri-iodide reduction, EIS measurements were carried out in a symmetrical cell having the CE/electrolyte/CE arrangement. The corresponding Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 5a. Experimental data are fitted using the Randles-type circuit (Fig. S6†) and the individual circuit element's values are given in Table 1. The real axis intercept in the high frequency region is known as Rs, which corresponds to the equivalent series resistance and is contributed mainly by the sheet resistance of the FTO plate. Sample to sample variations in Rs values are omitted for the same reason. The first semicircle after Rs in the high frequency region corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) between CE and the electrolyte which is inversely correlated with the tri-iodide catalytic activity. A constant phase element (CPE) having a dimension of capacitance is also introduced to fit the data and is commonly used instead of pure capacitance. CP-25, which shows the highest catalytic activity, exhibits a low Rct value (3.18 Ω) compared to CNF (8.22 Ω) and PEDOT (7.35 Ω). This observation reconfirms the high catalytic activity of CP-25. The low charge transfer resistance of CP-25 ultimately comes from the 1-D aligning of PEDOT over CNF. Such a peculiar morphology helps in achieving high conductivity as well as easy ion transport. Compared to the standard Pt (2.55 Ω), CP-25 shows a little higher Rct. This is probably due to the higher thickness of the counter electrode (CE) and can be reduced further by process modification. The semicircle loop in the low frequency region is an indication of Warburg diffusion (Wd) impedance due to diffusion through the Nernst's diffusion layer.58Wd increases in the order Pt (4.76 Ω) < CP-25 (5.26 Ω) < PEDOT (10.33 Ω) < CNF (44.95 Ω), indicating that the diffusion coefficient of tri-iodide is in the reverse order. Thus, the superior catalytic activity of CP-25 over PEDOT and CNF is confirmed by the lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) and high diffusion (lower Wd). Tafel polarisation is also carried out in the above cell and is plotted in Fig. 5b. The exchange current density for the samples is calculated in the low overpotential region from the plot and the corresponding values are 1.40, 1.30, 0.90 and 0.60 mA cm−2, respectively for Pt, CP-25, PEDOT and CNF. Higher slopes in the anodic and cathodic tables indicate higher exchange current density (J0) and, thereby, higher catalytic activity.3 The limiting currents (Jlim) in the Tafel plots of CP-25 and Pt are nearly the same (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, it has been found that CNF is showing high limiting current even though it has less exchange current density. Thus, it can be concluded that CNF has a high overpotential for the tri-iodide reduction compared to PEDOT and CP-25. The J0 values are also calculated from the EIS measurement using Rct through the following equation.3 J0 = RT/nFRct(2)

The derived materials were tested as counter electrodes in DSSC under solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 6a shows the comparison of J–V curves of DSSCs made using different counter electrode materials as compared to the standard Pt electrode, and Table 2 shows the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. The counter electrode made with CP-25 shows superior photo-conversion efficiency of 7.2% compared to PEDOT (4.5%) and CNF (5.6%). The superior efficiency of CP-25 can be assigned to its high catalytic activity due to high conductivity and less charge transfer resistance coming from the 1-D alignment of PEDOT.39,40 Compared to PEDOT, the high conversion efficiency of CNF is due to the high open circuit potential (Voc) and short circuit density (Jsc) even though its fill factor was poor due to the low catalytic activity. The low fill factor of CNF is supported by the poor redox couple in CV, low exchange current density in Tafel and high Rct in the EIS measurements. Importantly, CP-25 overcomes the individual drawbacks of its constituents by retaining the high Voc as CNF and high fill factor as PEDOT. Among the counter electrodes with different loading of PEDOT, CP-25 shows superior photovoltaic parameters (Fig. S7†), which are in accordance with the catalytic activities obtained from CV. The photovoltaic parameters of CP-25 are comparable to Pt (7.3%), and therefore, CP-25 can be considered to be a promising candidate for an alternative counter electrode in DSSC. We also studied the photovoltaic stability of DSSCs made with counter electrodes comprising of CP-25 and PEDOT. As shown in Fig. 6b, the efficiency of CP-25 stabilized to a value of 95% whereas the efficiency of PEDOT is decreased to 66% of the starting value. The higher tolerance of CP-25 against deactivation is clearly due to high stable conductivity as well as the mechanical integrity acquainted from the CNF backbone compared to the bulk PEDOT.

4. Conclusions
1-dimensionally (1-D) aligned polyethylenedioxythiophene is prepared by using hollow carbon nanofiber (CNF) as a solid substrate. The composite sample CP-25 shows enhanced conductivity and surface area compared to bulk PEDOT. Poor catalytic activity of bulk PEDOT in the DSSC counter electrode could be overcome by the nano-confinement using CNF. The hybrid material CP-25, which possesses a PEDOT content of 25 wt%, shows superior catalytic activity as evident from its low Epp and high Ip in the cyclic voltammogram. EIS and Tafel measurements on the symmetrical cell re-confirm the superior catalytic activity of CP-25 over CNF and PEDOT. CP-25 shows low charge transfer resistance and high exchange current density. DSSC made with CP-25 as a counter electrode catalyst shows a conversion efficiency of 7.16% compared to 4.48% for PEDOT and 5.56% for CNF, and the value is nearly comparable to that of Pt (7.32%).
