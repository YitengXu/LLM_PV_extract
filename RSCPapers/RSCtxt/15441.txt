    , Accepted 6th November 2018First published on 6th November 2018AbstractExploring efficient and earth-abundant bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is of paramount significance for clean and sustainable hydrogen energy generation. In this work, amorphous Co–Ni–B–O nanosheets (CNBO-NSs) are synthesized by the chemical reduction of bimetallic Prussian blue analogues (Co–Ni PBAs) using sodium borohydride. The as-prepared CNBO-NSs exhibit excellent electrochemical catalytic activity and stability. They can steadily afford 10 mA cm−2 current density at overpotentials of 140 mV for hydrogen evolution and 300 mV for oxygen evolution during 24 h operation. The formation of a metal–boron bond and the improved surface area along with the enhanced conductivity in the resultant CNBO-NS structures are factors responsible for the enhanced catalytic activities. This work could offer new clues for the utilization of metal–organic frameworks for designing functional nanomaterials, and more importantly valuable insights into crystallinity engineering in efficient electrolysis for energy conversion and beyond.
Both energy and environmental issues caused by the combustion of conventional fossil fuels are an imperative driving force for the modern community to search for clean and renewable energy substitutes.1,2 Hydrogen has been considered as a sustainable energy carrier due to its conspicuous advantages of abundant resources, high combustion value and clean combustion products.3 This could be achieved by means of electrochemical water splitting coupled with sustainable power sources, such as solar, wind and water energies.4,5 However, impeded by sluggish kinetics, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode both instantly demand highly efficient electrocatalysts to drive electrochemical water splitting.6 To date, noble-metal based catalysts such as Pt and RuOx/IrOx compounds are state of the art for the HER and OER, respectively.1,7 However their high cost and poor durability make them unsuitable in large-scale practical applications. Consequently, non-precious metal-based composites are attracting increasing attention to achieve low-cost durable electrocatalysts. For example, to date metal (hydr)oxides,8,9 chalcogenides,10–12 nitrides6,13 and phosphides14–16 have shown considerable activity for the HER or OER. Nevertheless, the design and preparation of earth-abundant bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the HER and OER are valuable yet challenging to streamline the overall system and improve the efficiency of water splitting.17,18
Recent studies have shown that transition metal borides are potentially effective electrocatalysts for water splitting.19–22 Compared to their single-metal counterparts, bimetallic and ternary borides have been reported to exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity due to a synergistic effect.6,23,24 Normally, metal borides/oxides can be obtained in two ways: one is thermally treating metal (hydr)oxides with a boron precursor such as boric acid at high temperature,25 while the other is to reduce metallic compounds using sodium borohydride in aqueous solution. Compared with the annealing strategy, the latter demonstrates advantages such as facile reaction conditions and adjustable composition and structure.26,27 Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), as a sort of metal–organic framework (MOF) family,28–30 have been employed as the precursors or templates for metal hydroxides, sulfides, and phosphides.31,32 According to the different structures and metal ions, PBAs could be transformed into various nanostructural metal borides by a mild chemical reduction method. Nevertheless, few studies have reported the preparation of metal borides from PBAs. Taking all this into consideration, PBAs exhibit promise in the preparation of metal boride compounds for energy conversion and storage applications.
In this work, we report the preparation of amorphous Co–Ni–B–O nanosheets (CNBO-NSs) by the chemical reduction of a Co–Ni PBA precursor for the first time. The as-formed material is catalytically active for both the HER and OER, for which it only requires 140 mV and 300 mV overpotential, respectively, to drive 10 mA cm−2 current density. The unique structure with its corresponding metallic properties is responsible for the enhanced activity. This simple and effective chemical reduction method for the formation of amorphous CNBO-NSs will be useful for the development of functional compounds based on the PBA series with special structures and novel morphologies, and thus provides the materials platform for diverse and emerging energy and environmental applications.33–35
The amorphous CNBO-NSs are prepared by the facile chemical reduction of Co–Ni PBA precursors in the presence of sodium borohydride (NaBH4). The crystal structure of CNBO-NSs is first investigated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. Before reduction, the PBA precursor has a well-defined crystalline structure (Fig. S1, ESI†), while the XRD pattern of CNBO-NSs depicts non-evident signal peaks, demonstrating the amorphous nature of the CNBO-NSs and the successful transformation of PBAs to CNBO-NSs (Fig. 1a). Moreover, the gradual increase in crystallinity of the CNBO-NSs after the different annealing treatments also evidences the presence of an amorphous structure in the initial CNBO-NSs (Fig. S2, ESI†). The derived sample after annealing at 600 °C demonstrates the distinct diffraction peaks at ∼37° and 45°, which are indexed to the (101) and (021) planes of crystallinity of CoB (Fig. 1a).19 This result suggests that the initial amorphous CNBO-NSs could be transformed to the crystalline boride by a reductive annealing treatment at a higher temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show the flower shape (∼200 nm) of the as-obtained products, while their outer surface is composed of gauzy nanosheets (Fig. 1b). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation of the sample demonstrates that the inner nanoparticles are covered by the outer gauzy nanosheets (Fig. 1c). The diffuse ring of the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern confirms the amorphous structure (inset of Fig. 1c). The ultrathin nanosheets at the outer surface tend to have a 5–8 nm thickness (Fig. 1d), and contain several atomic layers of the CNBO-NSs (Fig. 1e). This unique morphology is associated with the optimized reduction time, while insufficient reduction time cannot ensure the complete reduction of PBAs (Fig. S3, ESI†), and excessive reaction time would result in the complete formation of CNBO-NSs but with the loss of the metallic core in the products (Fig. S3, ESI†). The high-resolution (HR) TEM image (Fig. 1f) shows the edge site of the nanosheets. Few apparently continuous lattice fringes can be observed, indicating again an amorphous structure (Fig. S4a, ESI†). The amorphous structure was reported as the primary product for metal borides obtained in aqueous media.26,36 Hence, compared to its crystalline counterpart, the as-prepared CNBO-NS sample is expected to display advanced catalytic activity for water splitting, owing to the advantages of having an amorphous structure such as more unsaturated atoms as active sites.37 The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping in Fig. 1g shows the homogeneous dispersion of the constituents and the atomic compositions are 19.79%, 4.47%, 55.33% and 20.41% for Co, Ni, O and B, respectively (Fig. S4b, ESI†).

The surface chemical states and element valences are analyzed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique (Fig. S5, S6, ESI†). The two peaks at 873.2 eV and 855.5 eV (Fig. 2a) are ascribed to Ni 2p 1/2 and Ni 2p 3/2, accompanied by the satellite peaks (879.3 and 861.2 eV). Notably, metallic nickel is present in the as-prepared CNBO-NSs as evidenced by the appearance of a peak at 852.1 eV.38 The Co 2p spectrum also reveals two major peaks at 796.9 and 780.9 eV, corresponding to Co 2p 1/2 and Co 2p 3/2. Significantly, metallic cobalt is also indicated by the presence of a binding energy peak at 777.7 eV (Fig. 2b).19,23,39 As for the B 1s spectrum (Fig. 2c), the formation of the metal–boron bond is evidenced by the appearance of a peak at 187.8 eV, while the oxidized boron (B–O) peaks are located at 192.7 eV and 191.3 eV.21 The presence of oxidized species is confirmed by the presence of three peaks at 530.5, 531.5 and 532.6 eV corresponding to the lattice oxygen, substituted hydroxyl group and surface oxygen, respectively (Fig. 2d). Comparing the PBA precursor and CNBO-NS products, their surface chemical states suggest obvious differences. For instance, there is no metallic nickel or cobalt signal in the initial Co–Ni PBA sample (Fig. S5, ESI†). More interestingly, the peaks for metallic Ni or Co and metal–boron are also absent in the CNBO-NS product obtained after an excessive reaction time, such as 3 hours, which suggests the reduction time is one of the determining factors for ultrathin metal boride formation (Fig. S3, ESI†).

Electrochemical studies of such PBA-derived products are performed in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. 3). The PBA precursor shows poor activity, while the amorphous CNBO-NSs demonstrate an onset potential of 1.47 V (vs. RHE), which is very close to that of commercial IrO2 catalysts (1.48 V vs. RHE). Amorphous CNBO-NSs also show a slightly smaller overpotential (at 10 mA cm−2) of 300 mV than commercial IrO2 catalysts (310 mV), which is much better than that of the PBA precursor (380 mV) and most of the recent B-based materials for the OER (Fig. 3b, Table S1, ESI†). Moreover, the CNBO-NS catalyst also has the advantage of larger current density for the OER. For instance, the current density of the CNBO-NSs at ca. 1.6 V (vs. RHE) is 75 mA cm−2, which is much higher than that of commercial IrO2 (48 mA cm−2) and the PBA precursor (9.5 mA cm−2) (Fig. 3a). The inset in Fig. 3a shows a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec−1 for the CNBO-NSs, which is smaller than that of the precursor (76 mV dec−1), suggesting favorable kinetics. CNBO-NS activities obtained at different reduction times were also compared. For a short and long reduction time (0.5 h and 3 h reduction time), both CNBO-NS products show similar overpotentials of 330 mV and 340 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2, which are much higher than those of the CNBO-NSs obtained in 1.5 hours (Fig. S7, ESI†). We speculate that the performance variance would be increased by the diverse microstructures induced by different reduction times. This agrees with the differences in observed structural and chemical states between PBAs and CNBO-NSs with respect to the reduction time (Fig. 2 and S3, ESI†). After annealing at different temperatures ranging from 300 to 600 °C, the performance decreases along with an increase in crystallinity, which further proves that the amorphous structure of metal borides is beneficial for electrochemical reactions (Fig. S8, ESI†). Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to study the charge transfer resistance. In the Nyquist plot in Fig. 3c, the CNBO-NSs show the smallest semi-circle diameter, suggesting excellent interface contact between CNBO-NS hybrids and the electrolyte and reveals the fastest charge transfer (resistance of charge transfer, Rct) process for accelerating the OER process. Because there is no metal–boron bonds in the PBA precursor and CNBO-NS product obtained at 3 h reduction time, the amorphous CNBO-NS product obtained at 1.5 h reduction time shows the lowest charge transfer impedance due to the formation of metal-boron bonds (Fig. 3c). From the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) measurements (Fig. S9, ESI†), the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) value of the CNBO-NSs (15.4 mF cm−2) is found to be 1.7 fold that of the CNBO-NSs obtained at 3 h reduction time, and larger than that of PBAs (Fig. S10, ESI†), demonstrating that excessive reduction is undesirable for the exposure of active sites. Thus, the formation of metal–boron bonds and the intrinsic amorphous structure might be responsible for the improved catalytic activity. Moreover, from the stability tests, the amorphous CNBO-NSs are capable of functioning normally during 24 h operation without evident driving potential fluctuation as shown in Fig. 3d. Meanwhile, before and after 2000 cycles, the LSV curve is approximately identical, indicating again that the amorphous CNBO-NS product is effectively stable for practical application (the inset of Fig. 3d).

Bifunctional electrocatalysts play a significant role in reducing the overall cost and heightening the efficiency of the water splitting technology. Our CNBO-NS electrocatalyst also exhibits comparable activity for the cathodic HER in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. As presented in Fig. 4a, the PBA precursor shows no significant HER activity, while CNBO-NSs display a promising performance. The overpotential required to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is 140 mV, which is comparable and even better than that of most of the recently reported transition metal based HER catalysts (Fig. 4b, Table S2, ESI†). From another perspective, the faradaic efficiency of hydrogen evolution in 1.0 M KOH is 97.1%, which demonstrates that our CNBO-NSs can work efficiently (Fig. S13†). Moreover, the CNBO-NS catalyst demonstrates excellent activity at large current densities, even comparable with that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. For instance, CNBO-NSs achieve a cathodic current density of 100 mA cm−2 at −270 mV, which is similar to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the Tafel slope of 116 mV dec−1 for CNBO-NSs means that the HER process on CNBO-NS electrocatalysts follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway. Compared with that of other CNBO-NSs obtained at different reduction times, an overpotential of nearly ∼190 mV is required to achieve 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. S11, ESI†). The exceptional HER activity of CNBO-NSs might arise from the metal–boron bonds as well as the good conductivity of metal particles in the nanosheet structure, which contributes to the improved intrinsic activity and enhanced conductivity (Fig. S9, ESI†). The stability test curve (Fig. 4d) demonstrates that the amorphous CNBO-NSs are capable of continuous working for 24 hours, and the LSV curves of the CNBO-NS electrode show no dramatic activity loss even after 2000 cycles (inset of Fig. 4d). In view of the as-prepared CNBO-NSs as bifunctional catalysts for water splitting, an overall water electrolysis cell is assembled by using amorphous CNBO-NSs as both the anodic and cathodic active material in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The CNBO-NS catalyst exhibited a fairly good performance for overall water splitting. Abundant gas bubbles could be observed from the assembled water electrolysis cell (Movie S1, ESI†). A relatively small cell voltage of 1.69 V (without iR correction) is required to afford 10 mA cm−2 and the water electrolysis cell also shows advantages at the region of large current densities (Fig. S14a, ESI†). For instance, at 2.0 V, the current density of the CNBO-NS pair is ∼70 mA cm−2, which is higher than that of the Pt/C‖IrO2 couple (60 mA cm−2) and PBA pair (29 mA cm−2), and is comparable with that of most of the recently reported transition metal-based catalysts (Table S3, ESI†). And the electrolytic tank can be stably operated for at least 24 hours without conspicuous cell voltage fluctuations (Fig. S14b, ESI†), suggesting promising application potential for practical overall water splitting.

In summary, we successfully obtained amorphous CNBO-NSs by reducing bimetallic (Co–Ni) Prussian blue analogues in the presence of NaBH4 for the first time. The as-prepared CNBO-NSs exhibit excellent and bifunctional activity for the OER and HER, and thus can be utilized as active electrode materials for overall water splitting technologies. These bifunctional amorphous CNBO-NSs need only 300 mV and 140 mV overpotential for the OER and HER, respectively, to deliver 10 mA cm−2 current density during 24 h with increased stability. Consequently, an assembled full electrolysis cell using a CNBO-NS couple shows a cell voltage of 1.69 V to drive 10 mA cm−2 current density. Based on the unique structure of the catalyst, we speculate that the metal–boron bonds enhanced the conductivity in the resultant CNBO-NSs and are thus responsible for the increased catalytic activities. This work provides not only an effective strategy to design and prepare novel transition metal catalysts but also valuable insights into crystallinity engineering for efficient electrocatalysis, and thus momentously constructs an innovative bridge between metal borides and future energy conversion and beyond.
