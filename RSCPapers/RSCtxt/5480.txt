    , Accepted 7th January 2019First published on 8th January 2019AbstractHalide perovskite based resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) devices are emerging as a new class of revolutionary data storage devices because their switching material—halide perovskite—has received considerable attention in recent years. Among the electrical characteristics of the material, its current–voltage (I–V) hysteresis, which may occur due to defect formation and migration, means that ReRAM can employ halide perovskites as a resistive switching material. Many studies have been conducted on resistive switching materials; however, the investigation of halide perovskites for ReRAM devices is still in the early research stages; therefore, the application of halide perovskites in ReRAM devices is a topic worth studying. Herein, we introduce halide perovskites and their operating mechanism within a ReRAM device. Moreover, recent notable achievements along with future challenges have been reviewed.

1. Introduction
Because photovoltaic devices have been targeted as prospective energy sources over the past several decades,1–4 the emergence of halide perovskite solar cells has created a significant impact in the field of semiconductor research and technology. In general, the term “halide perovskite” can be described as a crystal structure with the chemical formula ABX3.5 In terms of light absorbers, the noteworthy advantages of halide perovskites lead to great successes in photovoltaic technologies, thereby achieving power conversion efficiencies of 22.7%.6–8
Due to the extensive impacts of halide perovskites as light absorbers, the scientific potential of these materials has been broadened to other electronic devices beyond photovoltaics, such as resistive-switching memories, artificial synapses, and field-effect transistors. These additional applications are achievable owing to the other characteristics of halide perovskites, such as I–V hysteresis caused by ion migration. In particular, ReRAM devices have great potential as next-generation memory devices because of their wide selection of switching materials. Switching memories based on oxide materials such as TiO2,9 Ta2O5−x,10 Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (PCMO),11 and BiFeO312 have already been thoroughly investigated.
Also, halide perovskites can be potential candidates as switching materials. Compared to the conventional ReRAM devices which have been investigated for many years, halide perovskite-based ReRAMs have shown incredibly fast investigation and development. Moreover, a comparable difference exists in the constituent tuning of A, B, and X components in the ABX3 framework. The constituent tuning can be an influential factor to decide the band gap which leads to different Schottky barrier heights. This effect is important to decide the ON/OFF resistive ratio in memory devices.13
Additionally, compared to the conventional ReRAMs, halide perovskite based ReRAMs show high ON/OFF ratio and the transition to the low resistance state (ON state) occurs without the electroforming process at low voltages. However, studies on halide-perovskite-based ReRAM devices have not been conducted much; one example of such a device is a resistive switching mechanism based device. Therefore, a significant amount of research is necessary because this technology may prove to be an important research field in the future.
In this study, we briefly discuss the principles of halide perovskite materials and their operating mechanism within ReRAM devices. In addition, ReRAM devices are introduced as classified halide perovskite materials, and finally, we discuss current challenges as well as our potential future directions in these areas.
2. Halide perovskites
2.1 Formation of halide perovskite structures
In general, halide perovskites are a family of compounds with the chemical formula ABX3, wherein a monovalent A+ cation, a divalent B2+ cation, and the 1− charge of the X halide anion are positioned in a unit cell corresponding to a corner-sharing octahedral network, as shown in Fig. 1(a)–(c).14–16 In terms of geometric structures, to satisfy the ideal cubic halide perovskite cell unit, the tolerance factor (t) developed by Goldschmidt has to be met first, which is 0.85 < t < 1.11. The t is described by (rA + rX)/√2(rB + rX), where rA, rB, and rX are the ionic radii of the A, B, and X atoms, respectively.16–18 If the t value is smaller than 0.85, the B–X bonds are compressed and the A–X bonds are tensioned at the same time, which induces stresses in the cubic symmetry. When the BX6 octahedron tilts, it leads to a lower-symmetrical tetragonal or orthorhombic crystal structure.

(b) An alternative view of halide perovskite structure, which is equivalent to the figure on the left. (c) A corner-shared network of halide perovskite structures. (d) Layered halide perovskites with increasing dimensionality (n) from 1 to ∞. Reproduced with permission.15 Copyright 2018, John Wiley and Sons. 
However, when the t value is larger than 1, the dimensionalities of the halide perovskite structure can be changed due to the component sizes of the atoms. For example, the monovalent cations such as CH3NH3+ and Cs+ at the A sites create a three-dimensional (3D) framework, whereas larger A cations form two-dimensional (2D) structures. The latter destructs the 3D framework with a large A cation.
Secondly, the octahedral factor (μ) is also important for determining the halide perovskite formation. The μ is defined as rB/rX, which is related to the BX6 octahedron, and the μ value must exceed 0.442 in order for a halide perovskite structure to form.16,17,19
Though other factors are needed to determine the halide perovskite formation, these two combinations of tolerance and octahedral factors are commonly employed and are informative for the design of novel halide perovskite structures.
2.2 Dimensionality controls
Generally, the ABX3 framework of halide perovskites is referred to as a 3D atomic structure. According to this formula, (RNH3)2An−1BnX3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4,…), where RNH3 is a large organic spacer cation such as a large aliphatic (e.g. 2-phenylethylammonium) or aromatic alkylammonium cation (e.g. n-butylammonium), the dimensionality of halide perovskites can be controlled from 3D to 2D structures.1,20,21
As shown in Fig. 1(d), when n = ∞, the typical 3D structure is formed, while the thinnest 2D layered-perovskite can be formed if the n value is 1.15 Quasi-2D layered structures (meaning the intermediate dimensionalities lie between 2D and 3D) are formed when the n values are defined integers. In other words, in the case of 2D and quasi-2D layered-perovskite forms, the inserted large spacer cations do not fit between the spaces in the BX6 octahedra. As a result, the original 3D structures can be separated into 〈001〉 or 〈110〉 slices to hold the larger cations, which breaks the cubic symmetry in the structures.1,20–23
These 2D and quasi-2D layered perovskite structures exhibit quantum confinement effects by electronic multi quantum-wells when the BX6 octahedra inorganic layers and spacer organic molecules behave like “wells” and “barriers,” respectively.21 The electron–hole interaction, generated by each dielectric constant of the “well” and “barrier,” creates large binding energies, while these decreased symmetries decrease the forbidden electronic transitions. This results in an enhanced quantum yield. In addition, the binding energy can be easily tuned by controlling the number of BX6 octahedra inorganic sheet layers in the structure.1,24,25
3. Principles of ReRAM devices
As the demand for high-density, high-performance memory devices has increased, ReRAM devices have received increased attention as potential next-generation non-volatile memory devices because of their simple structure, fast operating speed, high memory density, low power consumption, and low fabrication cost.26 Moreover, an advantage of ReRAM is that the device can be investigated with various materials, and halide perovskites are one of the switching materials. This investigation may serve as a future research topic. In this section, the basic principles of ReRAM devices are explained to provide insight into the studies on previously developed halide perovskite ReRAM.
3.1 ReRAM device structure and the resistive switching mechanisms
Generally, ReRAM consists of a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) stack, which is a two-terminal device. The memory elements consist of an upper and lower electrode, and an insulating switching layer between the two electrodes. When a voltage or current is applied across the MIM stack, the electrode, where an external bias is applied, is referred to as the top electrode and another electrode, which acts as an electrically grounded electrode, is referred to as the bottom electrode.27
Basically, the device is operated by the reversible soft breakdown of an insulator. This leads to a change in its resistance by simply applying an external bias, and Fig. 2(a) schematically illustrates the electrochemical metallization mechanism (ECM) and valence change mechanism (VCM) of the ReRAM. In this figure, the ECM is defined as the formation of cation based conducting filaments by an active metal electrode. The VCM is the change in electronic conductivity due to enriched oxygen with the utilization of an inert metal electrode.28–32 When a high voltage stress is applied, the initial high resistance state is changed to a low resistance state (LRS), which is called “electroforming.” Forming-free devices, which do not undergo this process, are required due to the high voltage stress that occurs when the device is initially operated. Following the electroforming process, when the opposite threshold voltage is applied, the LRS is switched to a high-resistance state (HRS) at a particular voltage (reset voltage), which is called the “RESET process.” Then, the “SET process,” which refers to the switching from a HRS to a LRS, occurs at the set voltage in a manner opposite to the reset process. In the resistive switching operation, the changes from the SET to RESET process indicate an “ON” state, and the opposite behaviour indicates an “OFF” state.27,33 Generally, in order to avoid device damage during the set process, the current is limited through current compliance (CC) by adding a series resistor. These resistive switching behaviours are observed in many insulating oxides as well as halide perovskites.
 Fig. 2  (a) The operating mechanism of the resistive switching behaviour; electroforming process, filament formation, and rupture in the switching layer. (b) The filamentary-type switching mechanism and (c) interface-type switching mechanism. 
There are several models for ECM or VCM devices in halide perovskite memory devices. Menzel et al. suggested simulation models to explain ECM devices.34,35 The device which employed Ag as a top electrode is mostly a 1-dimensional model, which means ions from the anode surface are pulled by the electric field and reduced at the cathode to form a filament.28 Also, Larentis et al. suggested an electrical conduction model and thermal model to explain VCM devices.36,37 The device which employed Au as a top electrode shows the VCM switching mechanism, which occurs by ion migration including diffusion and drift components. To prove the ion-migration flux in a halide perovskite ReRAM, the electrical conduction model, which is electrical conductivity in the conductive filament, is needed.
3.2 The filamentary-type and interface-type halide perovskite memory devices
Generally, the switching mechanism can be classified as a filamentary-type and interface-type depending on the type of conducting path.

Fig. 2(b) shows filamentary-type memory devices. From the applied suitable external bias, it shows resistive switching behaviour by the formation and rupture of conducting filaments in the insulating layer, which takes place during the SET and RESET processes, respectively.27,33
The other type is the interface-type memory devices, for which resistive switching occurs at the interface between the switching material and the metal electrode, as shown in Fig. 2(c).31
Generally, the difference between filamentary and interface resistive switching is the portion of the active switching area in the top electrode for local or entire areal switching. In the filamentary switching, the current conduction is confined to a narrow part of the device area.38,39 The most common metallic bridges, which bring about resistive switching by formation and rupture, are generated by the migration of metal atoms (e.g., Ag and Cu) originating from electrodes crossing the insulating layer.40
In general, halide-perovskite-based ReRAM devices conduct filamentary conducting paths by employing electrochemically active metal electrodes. For example, Yoo et al. reported, in 2016, a resistive switching memory device using a structure of Ag/CH3NH3PbClxI3−x/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO).41 The authors explained that Ag conducting filaments played a key role in the formation and rupture of the resistive switching phenomenon.
In contrast, in interface switching, the resistance change occurs by field-induced modification over the entire electrode area.40,42 In 2015, Yoo et al. developed memory devices that were fabricated with Au and CH3NH3PbClxI3−x on FTO substrates.43 The device performed at a low operating voltage of <1 V, showed a reliable endurance of 4100 times, and demonstrated a long retention time of 4104 s while showing a typical resistive switching behaviour. In this paper, the authors suggested trap-controlled space-charge-limited conduction (SCLC), which is related to charge carrier trapping.
It means that this device is an interface type because traps are sited at the interface between a perovskite layer and an electrode.
3.3 Challenging issues of ReRAMs
As mentioned above, ReRAM is a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) stack, which is a two-terminal device. However, the voltage–time dilemma remains a fundamental problem for the two-terminal ReRAM devices. This means switching occurs at reasonable voltages in the nanosecond regime, but a small read voltage should not disturb the device state when reading for a long time or frequently in series. To overcome long-lasting read-disturb errors, the switching kinetics should show a non-linearity, spanning over 15 orders of magnitude.44
To achieve a high non-linearity, the electrochemical and physical processes such as electro-crystallization, ion migration, and threshold switching that determine the switching kinetics of ECM and VCM have to be confirmed.
In the ECM processes, electro-crystallization dominates the switching behaviour at low voltages, whereas electron-transfer at middle voltages and ion migration at high voltages limit the switching kinetics.44 Moreover, in the VCM processes, ion migration is field-accelerated at low voltages and the process is determined by local temperature increase at high voltages.44 With these understandings of the electrochemical or physical processes, the ECM and VCM devices can exhibit sufficiently strong non-linearity of the switching kinetics to overcome the voltage–time dilemma.
The second issue is referred to as the sneak path problem. Compared to other memory devices, ReRAM devices can be fabricated with only 2 access lines, which makes a cross-point array structure possible. It is feasible to maximize the integration of the memory device by employing a cross-point array. Moreover, a 3D multi-layered stack is possible for extremely dense data storage.45
Thus, a cross-point array structure with resistive switching memory has been actively investigated. However, one access line is connected to the other neighbouring cells in a cross-point array and sneak current occurs from the other neighbouring cells. Due to the sneak current, ReRAM has the problem of read failure, which should be resolved. To resolve this issue, a selector is inserted with a resistive switching material into a cell, preventing the unselected cell from interfering with the sensing current of the selected cell, thus mitigating the sneak current.46 Since the advantages of a selector in a cross-point array have been recognised, development of various selector materials is needed.
The third issue is the ReRAM reliability of the programmed states. This refers to the reduction in resistance stability of the device after programming due to the plasticity behaviour, which finally leads to read errors.47,48 The phenomena of program instability under continuous programming conditions also need to be studied.
4. Switching memory device based on halide perovskites
As the research on halide perovskite photovoltaic devices has reached its peak, the hysteresis behaviour in the I–V characterization produced by light or voltage biasing conditions has been studied.
The hysteresis, an undesirable shift in the I–V curve, may result from ferroelectricity, charge trapping, or ion migration.49–51 Several types of point defects, for example vacancies (VPb, VMA, VI), interstitials (Pbi, MAi, Ii), and antisites (PbI, IPb) in CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) may bring about a range of energy levels, which leads to charge trapping at these energy levels.52–54 In addition, ferroelectric polarization can be stimulated and released by positive and negative poling.52,54,55 Thus, halide perovskites can be strongly suggested for use as switching materials in ReRAM devices. Here, we introduce the advanced studies on ReRAM devices based on classified halide perovskite materials.
4.1 Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite (OIHP) based ReRAMs
Since Yoo et al. first investigated OIHP ReRAMs based on CH3NH3PbClxI3−x that show hysteretic I–V characteristics in 2015, the performance of ReRAM devices has been gradually improving.40,43 In OIHP, common organic cations include CH3NH3 (MA) and HC(NH2)2 (FA), whereas the metal cations are typically Pb (lead) or Sn (tin) and serve as the inorganic cations. In general, MAPbI3-based memory devices among halide perovskite ReRAMs have been widely investigated.
In 2016, Lee and co-workers demonstrated a resistive switching mechanism using MAPbI3 sandwiched between Au and indium tin oxide (ITO) using a simple solution process.52 The device achieved a constant ON/OFF ratio as high as 104, a switching endurance of 400 cycles, and a low operating voltage of approximately 0.7 V. Based on the results, the resistive switching behaviour was thought to involve an I (iodide) vacancy defect because its activation energy (0.58 eV) of formation is the lowest among the MA, Pb, and I defects.56 The I defect hopping along the neighbouring atoms easily migrates along the corner-sharing BX6 octahedral edge in the perovskite structure. When the applied voltage increases, the I defect builds filaments from the bottom to the top, and then electrons can move by trap-to-trap hopping along the occupied traps during the SET process.
As previously understood, the hysteresis in the I–V curve originates from the ionic motion/migration and charge trapping/detrapping at the bulk or interface traps of halide perovskites.57 Thus, in 2017, Im and Jo demonstrated that the hysteresis was related to the domain size of the halide perovskite film by fabricating an Au/MAPbI3/ITO structure.58 To prove that a small crystal grain size enhances the hysteresis, which improves the ReRAM switching performance, MAPbI3 films with different grain sizes were synthesized by an inter-diffusion controlled dripping method using a toluene and isopropyl alcohol mixture. The grain sizes of the MAPbI3 films were controlled in the range from 60–600 nm, and the ON/OFF ratio was slightly increased and saturated as the grain size decreased. When the average grain size was 60 nm, the device exhibited 600 endurance cycles, a data retention time of 104 s, and 0.7 V and −0.61 V set and reset voltages, respectively. To confirm the grain size effect, their trap densities were calculated. This indicated that the surface traps in the grain boundaries might be slightly related to the grain size of the MAPbI3 films, and they may also affect the switching behaviour in the memory device. However, the author mentioned that it was not clear how the surface traps affect the resistive switching behaviour owing to the slightly changed trap densities, as well as leaky dielectric behaviour caused by changes in the grain sizes. It seems likely that further studies on the relations between the status of the film and the switching behaviour of memory device are needed.
In the two studies mentioned above, the OIHP-based ReRAM devices were assembled using Au as a top electrode and ITO as a bottom electrode; however, Choi et al. conducted the fabrication of a MAPbI3 based memory device using Ag as the top electrode, which is a highly active metal, and Pt on the SiO2/Si substrate as the bottom electrode.

Fig. 3(a) shows the unit cell of MAPbI3.59 Compared to the device fabricated with an Ni and Au top electrode (which showed a high operating voltage of ±0.4 V), this Ag/MAPbI3/Pt structured memory device exhibited a much lower operating voltage of ±0.14 V. This indicates that the electrochemically active top electrode boosts the resistive switching behaviour. As shown in Fig. 3(b),59 reliable resistive switching can be seen with no remarkable variation in the five initial voltage sweeps, exhibiting a high ON/OFF ratio of 106. The most important point in this research is that the device presented four-level resistance states by setting the current CC, which means multilevel data storage. The CC, which regulates the upper limit of the current in LRS with no change in the operating voltage, can modulate the resistive switching mechanism, and under four different CC (10−3, 10−4, 10−5, and 10−6 A) in the SET process, four different ON states were operated. Thus, according to this multilevel resistive switching behaviour, it will be feasible to improve the data storage density of the device.60

4.2 All inorganic halide perovskite based ReRAMs
Unfortunately, the OHIP materials are vulnerable to ambient conditions owing to their organic groups, and especially poor photo and thermal stability are the main obstacles for storage, fabrication, and operation, which are bottlenecks for their potential future applications.61–64
To resolve these issues, the organic cations can be replaced with inorganic cations. For example, all-inorganic perovskites based on cesium (Cs) cations are known to be thermally stable above 100 °C, maintaining their structural and electrical properties.65,66
Han et al. reported an air-stable CsPbI3-perovskite-film-based device with an Ag/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/CsPbI3/Pt structure that showed a high ON/OFF ratio of 106 (Fig. 4(a)), a low operating voltage below 0.2 V, and reproducible resistive switching with ON/OFF ratios over 300 cycles.67 In this research, CsPbI3 was employed to confirm that the resistive switching behaviour corresponded to the transited perovskite phase. This is because CsPbI3 is the most unstable among the cesium lead halide perovskites.

In Fig. 4(b) and (c), the phase transition from the cubic phase (perovskite) to the orthorhombic phase (non-perovskite) reduces the structural flexibility, which degrades the switching property.67 In the cubic phase, a defect easily moves along the 1D-like migration path56 in a linearly ordered corner-shared PbI6 octahedra, whereas in the orthorhombic phase, the double chain structure of the edge-shared PbI6 octahedra makes defect migration inconvenient. Thus, it can be seen that the stability of halide perovskites, which determines the resistive switching property, is related to perovskite phase transitions.
Very recently, Wang et al. fabricated a photonic ReRAM using Ag (top electrode), ITO (bottom electrode), and CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) (as shown in Fig. 4(d)), which led to the formation and rupture of both Br− ion vacancy filaments and silver filaments.68 This occurred as a result of light irradiation and an external bias voltage. When a positive bias was applied to the anode, Br− ions migrated and accumulated around the anode, and a Br− ion vacancy filament was formed. This led to the transition from HRS to LRS. However, Ag was easily ionized into Ag+ by external bias and Ag+ migrated toward the cathode through the active layer by an applied voltage on the anode. Subsequently, Ag+ eventually transformed to neutral Ag atoms, forming Ag filaments after capturing charge carriers. As a result, by the synergistic switching effect of the valance change and electrochemical metallization, a higher ON/OFF ratio was obtained with an extremely stable endurance over 5000 times, as depicted in Fig. 4(e).68
4.3 Layered structure halide perovskite based ReRAMs
As previously mentioned, the quasi-2D halide perovskite formed by inserting large organic cations into a 3D perovskite structure can also be used as a resistive switching material. In 2017, Seo et al. reported ReRAM devices based on BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 (BA = butylammonium) by controlling its dimensionality.69Fig. 5(a) depicts the crystal structure of BA2PbI4 (2D) and 3D MAPbI3 (3D). As shown in Fig. 5(b)–(e), as the dimensionality decreased from 3D (n = ∞) to 2D (n = 1), the HRS current significantly decreased, which contributed to the improvement of the ON/OFF ratio from 102 to 107.

It is considered that the low HRS current is related to a higher Schottky barrier. The high Schottky barrier at the interface between an active layer and an electrode is contributed by an enlarged bandgap in the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum caused by the change in dimensionality from 3D to 2D.23 The increased barrier height diminishes the injected carrier density from the electrode to the perovskite, which hinders the current movement in the HRS.
In addition, its activation energy (Ea) can be another reason for the OFF current reduction. When the metallic filament is broken, a small current flow is created by thermally excited electrons hopping through shallow trap states.70,71 Namely, Ea is associated with the trap state at the conduction band and the deep trap state. This is related to a high conduction band minimum and a large band gap, which indicates an increased Ea. Thus, a small OFF current is caused by high Schottky barrier heights and Ea, which result in a high ON/OFF ratio in the resistive switching property. The 2D layered halide perovskites have several unique properties, such as large band gaps for high ON/OFF ratio as previously mentioned, as well as a hydrophobic nature of large spacer cations to prevent water molecules from penetrating into the perovskite lattice. Even so, only a few studies on layered-halide-perovskite-based ReRAMs have been conducted.
4.4 Lead-free and new composition halide-perovskite-based ReRAMs
Halide-perovskite-based ReRAM devices have recently emerged as a potential research topic; however, several issues still need to be resolved. In particular, the utilization of Pb must be addressed due to its toxicity. Although Pb is the most suitable for halide perovskites, non-toxic elements have to be applied at the B site to achieve an environmentally friendly ReRAM device.
As shown in Fig. 6(a), Lee's group successfully fabricated lead-free ReRAM using (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9, which presented approximately two orders of magnitude of ON/OFF ratio as shown in Fig. 6(b), an endurance of 300 cycles, a long data retention of 104 s, a switching speed of 100 ns, and multilevel data storage with four data levels.72 Here, we suggest two alternatives to replace Pb.

First, homovalent substitution of group-14 elements may be a possible option. Among them, tin (Sn2+) in the group-14 elements can be used in lead-free halide perovskites due to its similar ionic radius, which is optically close to Pb.73–75 Also, germanium (Ge2+) in the group-14 elements can be used because its optical and transport properties are similar to those of Pb.73,76 Second, the double perovskite is another proposed candidate to be an alternative to Pb. Its structure is A2B+B3+X6, considered heterovalent substitution, where the B+ site can have Ag, Cu or Au, and the B3+ site can be In, Sb, or Bi.77,78
Finally, the new composition of halide perovskites needs to be investigated for further switching behaviour studies regarding resistive switching materials. There are several candidates for new compositions, such as (PEA)2GeI4, which is a layered perovskite with PEA and germanium;79 Cs2[C(NH2)3]Pb2Br7, which is a mixture of Cs and guanidinium;80 (CyBMA)PbBr4, which contains 1,3-bis(methylaminohydrobromide)cyclohexane (CyBMABr) ligand;81 and RbPbI3, which contains the rubidium cation (Ru+), which is slightly smaller than the cesium cation.82 These types of new compositions of halide perovskites have been rarely studied; however, their research works are sufficient to allow halide-perovskite-based ReRAM devices to show the most potential for future memory devices.
5. Conclusion
ReRAM devices are being highlighted as next-generation alternatives to the conventional memory devices. Although several studies on switching materials have been reported, ReRAM devices based on halide perovskites have not been reported much because they have only recently emerged as viable materials. Currently, many groups have started to research halide-perovskite-based ReRAM devices owing to their potential. In this paper, recent advances in ReRAM devices are not only categorized as classified halide perovskite materials but also introduced with suggestions about new materials that can be applied as switching layers. With regard to commercialization, there are several challenges and issues that must be resolved, such as the enhancement of resistive switching properties and the stability of the switching materials. In addition, because of the rapidly growing interest in wearable and portable devices, increased flexibility of the device is required to fulfil customer demands.
Although formal research on halide-perovskite-based ReRAM devices has only just started, we undoubtedly believe that they will be highly influential devices with amazing advances in the future market and will serve as a stepping stone for the development of a resistive switching memory field.
In addition, this topical review will encourage researchers to investigate halide-perovskite-based ReRAM devices with useful insights, overcome their challenges, and give a direction to offer promising opportunities.
