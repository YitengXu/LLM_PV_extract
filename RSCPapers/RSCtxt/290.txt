    AbstractPhotoinduced intra- and intermolecular electron transfer (ET) in thin films of porphyrin–fullerene dyad (P–F) and perylenetetracarboxidiimide (PTCDI) was studied by means of photoelectrical and spectroscopic methods. Films consisting of smooth 100 mol% layers of P–F and PTCDI were prepared by the Langmuir–Schäfer (LS) technique and thermal evaporation, respectively. The time-resolved Maxwell displacement charge (TRMDC) and laser flash-photolysis methods were utilized to demonstrate photoinduced ET from P–F to PTCDI regardless of which chromophore is photoexcited. Finally, the information about the electron movement in the respective thin films was used to build a layered organic solar cell, whose internal quantum yield (ΦI) of collected charges was 13%.
Introduction
Organic solar cells represent an attractive and challenging alternative to Si-based photovoltaics, despite a huge discrepancy in terms of efficiency and durability existing between them.1–6 In fact, the main potential advantages of organic photovoltaics compared to the inorganic counterparts are their flexibility, light weight, versatility in the manufacture, easy integration in different devices, significant cost reduction, and possibility of large area coating.7,8 A deep knowledge of the fundamental light induced processes taking place in thin molecular films is essential to design efficient organic photovoltaic devices. The photoinduced electron transfer (ET) is a key step in the light-to-electricity conversion. If the active layers of a solar cell are constituted by oriented molecular films, it is possible to achieve vectorial photoinduced electron transfer (VPET) in one defined direction throughout the whole film structure.
Porphyrin–fullerene dyads are an interesting example of covalently linked electron donor–acceptor (D–A) pairs. Numerous photochemical studies have shown the capability of such supramolecules to perform efficient ET from porphyrin to fullerene moiety.9–12 Recently it was demonstrated how to achieve a vectorial multistep electron transfer by combining molecular films of dyads with electron donor or acceptor layers.13–17 In the reported studies, Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique has been adopted to prepare the films. In most of the cases, an octadecylamine (ODA) matrix had to be mixed with the active molecules in order to obtain LB films with a transfer ratio close to unity. Based on the main idea that the introduction of ODA, which is an insulator, could decrease the conductivity of the films, the latest research in our laboratory aimed to build molecular film structures constituted by active molecules alone, and to study the ET in such film systems. The compounds selected for our analysis were a porphyrin–fullerene dyad (P–F), synthesized18 in our laboratory and widely studied before,13–17,19–21 and perylenetetracarboxidiimide (PTCDI).
In this work, PTCDI was studied as an electron acceptor for P–F using photoelectrical and spectroscopic methods. The n-type characteristics of PTCDI are discussed in several papers.22–26 Furthermore, we have recently shown a secondary electron transfer to take place from the porphyrin–fullerene dyad in a charge-separated state (P+–F−) to a perylene derivative (PDI) in molecular film systems17 with large molar percentage of ODA matrix. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies revealed that in such systems PDI films were not smooth, and the surface coverage by PDI molecules was poor.17PTCDI can be thermally evaporated, ensuring smooth and homogeneous films with controllable layer thickness. Moreover, evaporated films open up the possibility to use a metal top electrode in the solar cell preparation, which has several advantages as discussed later. Photoinduced response of such films of improved layer quality was compared to that of similar film systems with ODA matrix investigated earlier.17 A spectroscopic method was then adopted to verify the conclusions about the ET made from the photovoltage (PV) measurements.
The intra- and intermolecular ET in 100 mol% film systems of P–F and PTCDI deposited by the Langmuir–Schäfer (LS) and thermal evaporation techniques, respectively, were systematically investigated by means of the time-resolved Maxwell displacement charge (TRMDC) technique, laser flash-photolysis, and photocurrent measurements to prove an efficient photoinduced interaction between the two molecules.
Experimental section
Materials
Molecular structures of the compounds used are shown in Fig. 1. The porphyrin–fullerene dyad (P–F or F–P), 61,62-[10,20-(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)porphyrin-5,15-diylbis(1-phenyl-3-oxy)di-ethylene]1,9:49,59-bismethanol[60]fullerene-61,61,62,62-tetracarboxylate, was synthesized in our laboratory.18 The acronyms are used to indicate the location of the porphyrin (P) and fullerene (F) moiety of the dyad in the films relative to other molecular layers. Perylenetetracarboxidiimide (PTCDI) and tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium (Alq3) are commercially available (Sigma Aldrich), and were used without further purification.

Sample preparation and characterization
Langmuir–Schäfer films of P–F were deposited by spreading a 0.2 mM solution of P–F in chloroform onto a subphase surface (phosphate buffer: 0.5 mM Na2HPO4 and 0.1 mM NaH2PO4 in MilliQ water) with pH ≈ 7. More information on the preparation of P–F films by the LS method can be found in the literature.27PTCDI and Alq3 were thermally evaporated in high vacuum (∼6 × 10−6 mbar) in an Auto 306 evaporation chamber (Edwards).
The thickness of the layers was estimated by measuring the step height of the films with a WYKO NT1100 optical profilometer (Veeco) in the phase-shift interferometry mode with 20× objective (horizontal resolution 0.75 μm).
A NTEGRA Prima (NT-MDT, Russia) AFM was used for analyzing the sample surfaces. The microscope was placed on a dynamic anti-vibration system (TS-150 by Table Stable Ltd., Switzerland), which was further placed on a massive stone table to eliminate external vibrational noise. Imaging was carried out in intermittent contact mode (semi-contact) using uncoated silicon probes (model NSC14/NoAl, Micromasch, Estonia). All the images were measured in ambient conditions (RH = 44 ± 1% and RT = 25 ± 1 °C) without filtering. A damping ratio (contact amplitude/free amplitude) of 0.8 was used for imaging. The Scanning Probe Image Processor (SPIP, Image Metrology, Denmark) software was used for the image analysis. The films for AFM measurements were deposited on mica substrates.
The steady state absorption spectra for the studied compounds in films were recorded by a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer.
For spectroscopic studies and profilometric characterization the films were deposited onto quartz substrates, cleaned by the standard procedure,28 and plasma etched for 15 min in a low-pressure nitrogen atmosphere with a plasma cleaner (PDC-23G, Harrick). For time-resolved absorption flash-photolysis experiments the quartz plates had both ends polished to 45° angle.
The samples for photovoltage and photocurrent measurements were fabricated on glass substrates coated with a transparent conducting indium-tin-oxide (ITO) anode supplied by SOLEMS. ITO plates for photocurrent experiments were patterned with aqua regia to prevent short circuit when contacting the top electrode.
Before use, the ITO plates were cleaned in ultrasonic bath with acetone, chloroform, isopropanol, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution, and finally with Milli-Q water. After drying the plates under N2 flow at 150 °C for 1 h, the deposition of active layers was carried out. In the samples for photovoltage measurements, 11 ODA layers were deposited onto ITO slides prior to the active layers, and 20 ODA layers were added onto the active layers to finish the sample, in order to insulate the active layers from the electrodes.
Electron transfer measurements
Several techniques were adopted to demonstrate the photoinduced intra- and/or intermolecular electron transfer in films of P–F and PTCDI. The interaction between molecular films was first investigated by the photovoltage technique, followed by a spectroscopic study with the laser flash-photolysis method. Finally, the information obtained from the VPET studies was used to build the photovoltaic devices containing the studied molecular films, and the photocurrent generation was evaluated.
Photovoltage and photocurrent measurements were carried out without protecting the samples from air exposure. Flash-photolysis experiments were performed in nitrogen atmosphere, after exposure to air.

1 TRMDC photovoltage method. 
The TRMDC method provides a useful way to study the VPET in thin films. The description of the method and data interpretation are reported in several publications.13–15,17,19,29,30
Samples were excited by a 10 ns laser pulse at 430 nm from the second harmonic of a titanium–sapphire laser pumped by the second harmonic of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (532 nm), and at 532 nm from the second harmonic of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. The typical sample structure for the PV measurements was ITO|11–12×ODA-layers|active-layers|20×ODA-layers|InGa liquid-metal drop electrode (InGa). For simplicity in this article we will refer to the different sample structures by presenting only their active layers, assuming the ITO and the InGa electrodes (including the ODA layers) on the left and on the right sides, respectively.
Since the photoactive layers are isolated from the two electrodes (ITO and InGa), the measured PV signals are caused only by the electron movement inside the active layers, in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the films. The signal polarity is determined by the direction of the displacement: if electrons move from ITO towards the InGa electrode, a negative signal is obtained and vice versa. The TRMDC measurements are carried out in a much shorter time domain than the instrumental time constant (∼10 ms) of the measurement system,31,32 thus the PV amplitude is directly proportional both to the charge separation (CS) distance and to the number of charge-separated states.


2 Time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. 
The laser flash-photolysis method in micro- to millisecond time scale provides information on the transient states formed upon photoexcitation. A detailed description of the flash-photolysis method is presented elsewhere.33
The flash-photolysis system (LFP-111, Luzchem) was modified for total internal reflection mode in order to increase its sensitivity.20 A Xe-lamp (66921, Newport) was used as probe light source. More information on the measurement setup can be found in ref. 20.
Samples were photoexcited at the wavelengths of 430 nm and 532 nm, using the same laser arrangement as in PV measurements, and the monitoring wavelength range was 460–1264 nm. For monitoring the IR region, a CM 110 (Spectral Products) monochromator and a 2053 (New Focus) detector were used.
Excitation energy density was ∼2 mJ cm−2, at both the excitation wavelengths.


3 Photocurrent measurements. 
Photovoltaic cells of the studied compounds were prepared, using ITO as anode and Au as top-cathode. A thin layer of Alq3 was adopted as a buffer under the Au electrode, and it was considered as a modification of the cathode, not as a photoactive layer.34 The gold layer (70 nm) was thermally evaporated through a mask in order to form cells with a 1 mm2 active area.
Two different structures with a generic “ITO|active layers|Alq3|Au” configuration were tested. The active layers were constituted by a PTCDI film in one cell, and by the bilayer P–F|PTCDI in the other sample. In the bilayered cell, three subsequent LS layers of P–F were deposited, thus increasing the absorption of the dyad. A cell with P–F alone was not built since the Au electrode penetrated through the thin LS layers, resulting in short circuit.
The generated photocurrent (PC) was evaluated by measuring the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics in dark and under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight illumination (532 W m−2) with a source/monitor unit (E5272A, Agilent). The AM 1.5 sunlight illumination was produced with a filtered Xe-lamp in the LZC-SSL solar simulator (Luzchem). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded in the range of 400–800 nm using monochromatic light provided by a 75 W Xe-lamp (model 71208, Newport), coupled with a monochromator. The spectra were corrected using a calibrated photodiode.

Results and discussion
Film characterization
The films of P–F and PTCDI were characterized by means of an optical profilometer, AFM, and steady-state absorption spectroscopy. The thickness of a P–F monolayer was estimated to be 2.5 nm. PTCDI film thickness was varied from 5 to 40 nm, depending on the measurement method used. The thickness of the thermally evaporated films (PTCDI, Alq3, Au) was monitored by quartz crystals during the evaporation. A correlation between the measured thickness and absorption was found by the profilometer, thus allowing us to control the reproducibility of film thicknesses.
AFM studies of P–F and PTCDI films (deposited on silicon and mica substrates, respectively) are shown and discussed in ESI† (Fig. S1 and S2).
The steady-state absorption spectra of the P–F monolayer and evaporated PTCDI (thickness = 40 nm) are shown in Fig. 2. P–F has a typical narrow absorption band with the maximum at 430 nm, corresponding to the porphyrin Soret band. PTCDI has a broader absorption with maxima between 500–600 nm. In bilayer samples the total absorption is the sum of the absorptions of each molecular layer, thus indicating a weak ground state electronic interaction between the molecules.

Electron transfer
The intra- and intermolecular interactions after photoexcitation can be investigated through the energy level diagram of the studied compounds (see Chart 1). ITO35 and Au36 work functions, as well as HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PTCDI37 were taken from the literature. HOMO and LUMO levels of P–F were estimated from differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) experiments.17

1 TRMDC photovoltage. 
The ET from P–F to PTCDI was studied with the TRMDC technique, by analyzing the polarity or signal direction and the amplitude of the photovoltage signals. To prove the capability of PTCDI to accept electrons from P–F, several sample configurations were tested. A bilayer structure containing P–F and PTCDI, the active layer structure P–F|PTCDI, was compared with the corresponding reference samples of P–F monolayer (thickness = 2.5 nm) and PTCDI single layer (thickness = 16 nm).
In order to fully understand the ET between P–F and PTCDI, the possible orientations of porphyrin and fullerene moieties of the dyad with respect to the electrodes were investigated. The F–P orientation represents the case in which the fullerene moiety lies on the ITO side, with the porphyrin towards the InGa, which is an opposite orientation to P–F. The F–P orientation was deposited by the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) method from water to air, while the P–F orientation was prepared by the LS technique to guarantee the desired orientation of porphyrin and fullerene moieties. The F–P films contained 60 mol% of ODA matrix, to ensure unit transfer ratio in the LB deposition. Thus, the amplitudes of positive and negative PV signals may differ due to the different surface coverage by dyad molecules in films with P–F and F–P layers.
The orientation of P–F in LB films (10 mol% P–F in ODA) has been widely studied earlier.19 Two opposite polarities of PV signals depending on the mutual orientation of porphyrin and fullerene with respect to the electrodes have been obtained. In Fig. S3 of ESI†, the photovoltage responses of 100 mol% P–F and 40 mol% F–P films at the excitation wavelength of 430 nm are presented. Opposite signal polarities are achieved for P–F and F–P, demonstrating the ET from porphyrin to fullerene moiety in both cases. The TRMDC signal of F–P has a characteristic shape, in which a fast formation to the expected direction is followed by a fast relaxation, resulting in the inversion of the signal polarity. Same behavior was observed for the 10 mol% LB films of the dyad in ref. 19, where possible explanations for such a behavior are supplied.
The other reference structure, PTCDI, showed a negative PV signal, which is typical of non-oriented molecular layers31 (see Fig. S4, ESI†).
The signal amplitudes for all the structures measured by the photovoltage technique at the excitation wavelengths of 430 and 532 nm are reported in Table 1 as signal sensitivities (voltage divided by the excitation energy density, V cm2 mJ−1). The photovoltage responses for the bilayers P–F|PTCDI and PTCDI|F–P at the dyad excitation wavelength (430 nm) are presented in Fig. 3. A negative PV signal is achieved for P–F|PTCDI structure, while the response of PTCDI|F–P sample has a positive polarity. This indicates that electrons are transferred from P–F to PTCDI in both of the film structures. An additional proof of the ET between P–F and PTCDI is provided by taking into account the amplitudes of the bilayer samples with respect to the references. At the 430 nm excitation, the amplitude of P–F|PTCDI is 25 times higher than the sum of the amplitudes of individual P–F or PTCDI (Table 1). Since the absorption of the bilayer sample is the same as the sum of absorptions of P–F and PTCDI, we can assume the number of excited states to be unchanged. Hence, the PV increase of the bilayer is attributed to the increased CS distance, which indicates electron movement through the whole bilayer system.

 Fig. 3  Photovoltage (PV) responses in a short timescale (a) and in a long timescale (b) for the bilayer structures P–F|PTCDI and PTCDI|F–P. The excitation wavelength is 430 nm and the excitation energy density is 0.04 μJ cm−2. 
It is well known that when the porphyrin moiety of the P–F dyad is excited, a fast and efficient ET takes place from porphyrin to fullerene, yielding a fullerene anion.19,21 At 430 nm, both P–F and PTCDI absorb light and become excited. However, since the ET in P–F is very fast, the dominant process upon the 430 nm excitation is the multistep ET: a primary intramolecular ET in P–F, forming P+–F−, followed by a secondary ET from the fullerene anion to PTCDI.
If the PV responses in Table 1 are compared to those of similar systems with ODA matrix,17 a significant increase in the sensitivities (several tens of times according to the sample structure) for the films with 100 mol% of active molecules is evident. Possible explanations are the enhanced coverage of active molecules in the films and the different photoinduced interaction between the two compounds (P–F and PTCDI compared to P–F and PDI).17
The photovoltage signals of the bilayers containing P–F and PTCDI are presented in two different timescales, namely 1.8 μs in Fig. 3a and 9 ms in Fig. 3b. After a relatively fast decay, signals are long-lived and they decay to zero in about 9 ms. The long-lived behavior of the bilayer systems can be attributed to the increased CS distance in the P+–F|PTCDI− film structure, followed by a lateral charge migration in the P+ and PTCDI− layers.14,15
The ET from P–F to PTCDI takes place independently of which molecular layer is photoexcited. Fig. S5 (ESI†) presents PV decays for P–F|PTCDI and PTCDI|F–P structures, obtained at the PTCDI excitation wavelength of 532 nm with the excitation energy density of 0.33 μJ cm−2. The PV amplitude of P–F|PTCDI at the 532 nm excitation is roughly 2 times lower than that at 430 nm (see Table 1). For PTCDI|F–P sample, the amplitudes are the same at both excitation wavelengths. However, it must be considered that absorptions of the bilayer structures at 532 nm are approximately 2 times higher than those at 430 nm. This reveals a roughly two times less efficient ET from P–F to PTCDI, when only PTCDI is photoexcited at 532 nm, which in turn suggests that the excitation energy is utilized for other processes than interlayer ET. For example an energy transfer process could take place from PTCDI to the dyad, followed by ET from the dyad in charge separated state to PTCDI, as proposed in ref. 38. Another possible mechanism triggered by the 532 nm excitation is the ET from porphyrin moiety of P–F to the excited PTCDI. Additional information on the possible ET paths will be provided in the next section, where the time-resolved absorption spectroscopy data are analyzed.


2 Time-resolved absorption. 
The time-resolved absorption spectra of three samples (P–F, P–F|PTCDI, PTCDI) were measured by the flash-photolysis method, to confirm the conclusions on the ET between P–F and PTCDI, and to provide more information on the photo-induced processes in the films. The P–F and PTCDI films were measured as references for the bilayer structure P–F|PTCDI.
The flash-photolysis response of PTCDI single layer is weak (see ESI†, Fig. S6), and thus the shape of PTCDI transient spectrum does not influence that of the P–F|PTCDI bilayer.
In order to achieve a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio, the sample absorption was increased by depositing 6 P–F monolayers and 6 P–F|PTCDI bilayers. Four ODA layers were deposited between each of the deposited photoactive segments in order to insulate one segment from the other. The steady-state absorption spectra of the measured samples are presented in Fig. S7 of ESI.† The thickness of PTCDI film was 10 nm in the reference sample, and 5 nm in each bilayer segment of P–F|PTCDI. All the samples were measured in similar conditions at the excitation wavelengths of 430 and 532 nm, with energy density of approximately 2 mJ cm−2. Hence, the amplitudes of the transient signals can be fairly compared with each other.
The time-resolved absorption spectra of P–F and P–F|PTCDI at 5 μs, after the 430 nm excitation recorded in the wavelength range of 600–1100 nm, are shown in Fig. 4. In the P–F spectrum, the transient band around 750 nm corresponds to the porphyrin radical cation.39–41 Moreover, the porphyrin Q-band bleaching at 600 and 660 nm is detected. In the near-IR-region, the broad transient absorption in 850–1050 nm range is attributed to the fullerene anion radical.41 The observed transient states support the CS between porphyrin and fullerene (P+–F−), which is consistent with previous works and with the photovoltage results of the previous Section.
 Fig. 4  Time-resolved absorption spectra of P–F and P–F|PTCDI film structures at 5 μs after the excitation. The excitation wavelength was 430 nm and the excitation energy density is roughly 2 μJ cm−2. 
In the time-resolved spectrum of P–F|PTCDI (see Fig. 4), three main transient bands are observed around 700, 820, and 1000 nm, corresponding to the PTCDI radical anion absorptions.42 The small shifts in the transient peak positions of PTCDI anion (with respect to ref. 42) can be explained by a difference in the chemical structure of the two perylene derivatives. In the bilayer spectrum, the bleaching of the porphyrin Q-band is detected at 660 nm, while the porphyrin cation absorption at 750 nm is covered by the PTCDI anion absorption. The observed transient bands of porphyrin cation and PTCDI anion demonstrate the interlayer ET from P–F to PTCDI, producing the final transient state of P+–F|PTCDI−. The nanosecond time scale of the flash-photolysis method is too slow to detect the formation of the transient intermediate states. As a result of this, only the final transient states of the film system can be observed.
The time-resolved absorption spectrum of P–F|PTCDI was recorded also at 532 nm excitation, where only PTCDI absorbs light. The comparison between the spectra of P–F|PTCDI at both excitation wavelengths (430 and 532 nm) is shown in Fig. 5. The shapes of the spectra correlate well with each other, with small differences at 800 nm and 1000 nm. Thus, the PTCDI anion and porphyrin cation are formed regardless of which chromophore is photoexcited (as in the PV measurements). However, the transient absorption spectrum at the excitation wavelength of 532 nm lies mainly below that of 430 nm excitation (despite the higher absorption and number of photons at 532 nm), showing that the interlayer ET from P–F to PTCDI is more efficient upon the 430 nm excitation, as concluded in the Photovoltage section. This indicates that the major interlayer ET mechanism is the ET from fullerene anion of the dyad to PTCDI at the 430 nm excitation. With the 532 nm excitation the ET pathway is less clear and can be either: (a) an energy transfer from excited PTCDI to P–F followed by the known primary and secondary ET reactions, and/or (b) the ET from P–F (from the porphyrin moiety) to excited PTCDI. In both the cases, the final transient state is P+–F|PTCDI−.
 Fig. 5  The time-resolved absorption spectra of P–F|PTCDI film at different excitation wavelengths (430 nm and 532 nm). The spectra were recorded with the excitation energy density of approximately 2 mJ cm−2, at delay time of 5 μs after the excitation. 
The radical anion of a perylene derivative may recombine to the triplet state.43 The absorption peaks corresponding to the triplet state are at 700 nm and at 1030 nm or 1.2 eV.43–45 The aforementioned difference in the shape of the spectra recorded with different excitation wavelengths could be explained by considering a more pronounced triplet state recombination of PTCDI anion at 532 nm. This possibility is also supported by the previous considerations on the ET between P–F and PTCDI, whose total efficiency was lower when only PTCDI was photoexcited (see previous Section).
The flash-photolysis decays of the P–F and P–F|PTCDI films monitored at 820 nm are presented in Fig. 6. The signal of P–F film has a half-lifetime of 3.3 μs, while that of the bilayer P–F|PTCDI is 8.5 μs. In both cases there is a fast signal recombination right after the excitation, but a long-lived “tail” can be found in the bilayer film. The prolonged lifetime of the CS in P–F|PTCDI is due to the increased distance of the CS system resulting from the interlayer ET between P–F and PTCDI and thus reducing the recombination rate.

3 Photocurrent. 
Learning to know the intra- and intermolecular photoinduced interactions between P–F and PTCDI helped us to develop photovoltaic devices. Layered organic solar cells of the studied compounds were prepared, as discussed in the experimental Section. The thickness of P–F in the solar cell was 7.5 nm (three P–F monolayers on top of each other), PTCDI 32 nm, and Alq3 5 nm. The use of thermally evaporated layers, such as PTCDI and Alq3, allows the selection of Au as a cell cathode.34 This has several advantages compared to the electrolytic electrode, which was previously adopted with thin LB film structures.14,15,17 The major disadvantages of the liquid electrolyte are the temperature stability issues and the necessity of a careful sealing of the cell. Au electrode is stable to oxidation, and this kind of layered cells can be stored in air without encapsulation, while still keeping a reasonable performance after several weeks.34 Moreover, the use of a solid electrode simplifies the cell preparation and the photoelectrical measurements.
The I–V curves for the PTCDI and P–F|PTCDI cells in dark and under white light illumination are shown in Fig. 7a. PTCDI cell is constituted by a single non-oriented layer with high resistance. Its I–V characteristics show a nearly Ohmic behavior, typical for photoresistors. When P–F is coupled with PTCDI, the I–V curve of the bilayered cell has totally different shape, resembling that of a photodiode. Moreover, under illumination the bilayered cell generates distinctive photocurrent and shows reasonable open circuit voltage (UOC), thus being able to produce electrical power under illumination. Evidently, a preferred direction for electrons is induced in the bilayer structure as a consequence of the ET, and the separated charges are collected at the respective electrodes resulting in generated photocurrent.
 Fig. 7  Current (I) vs. voltage (U) characteristics in darkness and under 532 W m−2 simulated AM 1.5 solar illumination (a) and IPCE and absorption spectra (b) of P–F|PTCDI and PTCDI structures. 
Action (IPCE) spectra of the two samples are presented in Fig. 7b. Both spectra resemble the shape of the respective absorption spectra, showing that the generated photocurrent results from the absorption.
The PTCDI single layer cell has an extremely low IPCE, and thus the introduction of dyad is crucial to the enhanced photocurrent generation of the bilayered cell. The contribution of P–F to the photocurrent is evident from the pronounced peak at 430 nm, which corresponds to the dyad absorption maximum. However, the action spectrum of P–F|PTCDI shows that the main contribution to the photocurrent comes from the wavelength region where PTCDI absorbs (above 500 nm). For a more quantitative analysis, the photovoltaic parameters calculated from the action spectra are given in Table 2. The internal quantum yield of collected charges, ΦI, defined as in ref. 17, is highest in P–F|PTCDI (13%) at both 430 and 580 nm. The ΦI of a published layered system including P–F and a similar perylene derivative (PDI) was 6.54% at 430 nm.17 Thus, a 2 times more efficient solar cell is achieved in this work, as a consequence of the removal of the ODA matrix from the active layers of the cell. Further improvements of the system will be however investigated, aiming mainly to enhance the absorption of the films and the coverage of the solar spectrum to get more efficient devices.

Conclusions
In this work, the intra- and intermolecular electron transfers (ET) in thin films of P–F, PTCDI, and P–F|PTCDI were studied. The use of 100 mol% films deposited by the LS technique and thermal evaporation allowed us to obtain smooth films with increased surface coverage, and strong photoelectrical signals. It was shown by TRMDC photovoltage technique that PTCDI is able to accept electrons from P–F, regardless of which chromophore is photoexcited. These conclusions were supported by the spectroscopic measurements, which provided more information on the ET mechanism and the final transient charge-separated states. At both the excitation wavelengths, the final transient state was P+–F|PTCDI−, as detected by the flash-photolysis method. The intermolecular CS was noticed to be more efficient with P–F photoexcitation thus suggesting the possibility of additional processes, e.g. energy transfer from PTCDI to P–F prior the intermolecular ET with PTCDI photoexcitation. With the information about the ET gained from the photoelectrical and spectroscopic methods, layered organic solar cell was developed. In the bilayered P–F|PTCDI cell, electrons move in a preferred direction as a consequence of the ET reactions (and holes in the opposite direction) resulting in photocurrent generation. Moreover, the cell shows a characteristic current-to-voltage response, typical of photovoltaic devices.
