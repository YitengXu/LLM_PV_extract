    , Accepted 12th November 2013First published on 12th November 2013AbstractMulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are limited by entanglement, and it is rather difficult to prevent graphene stacking in a polymer composite. These two challenges can be addressed by developing a MWCNT–graphene hybrid where MWCNTs and graphene are born as twins. We in this study employed a syngas production method using microwave irradiation for a one-pot synthesis of porous, crumpled and loose MWCNT–graphene hybrids, investigated the substrate compositions, measured their performance as electrodes for energy storage devices, and proposed the synthesis mechanisms. A number of hybrids, including MWCNT–graphene, MWCNT–cup-stacked CNT and MWCNT–graphitic nanofiber, were synthesized on Cr–Ni, Fe–Ni and Ni–CeO2 substrates, respectively. TEM analysis shows that the two challenges have been markedly addressed in the hybrids. They performed better in terms of capacitive properties than commercial MWCNTs.
1. Introduction
Carbon nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon fibers have attracted a great deal of interest in academia and industry over the past 30 years. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are the most extensively studied ones owing to their good mechanical, electrical and thermal performance,1–4 where a major challenge is to loosen or disentangle these tubes so as to process them in solution. Graphene, a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, is hailed as a rapidly rising star in materials science and engineering due to its exceptionally high surface area,5 extraordinary stiffness and strength and high thermal and electric conductivities.6–8 However, these striking properties diminish and even disappear when many graphene layers stack themselves producing graphite platelets where (i) the poor through-plane electric and thermal conductivities can pose a significantly negative effect and (ii) the adjacent graphene layers under loading can slide past each other leading to poor mechanical performance. Thus, it is a great challenge to prevent graphene layer stacking. From our perspective, these two challenges can be simultaneously addressed by developing a hybrid of CNTs and graphene; graphene in such a hybrid may loosen the entanglements of CNTs which in turn intercalate between the layers. As an additional benefit, CNTs and graphene may complement each other in terms of geometry and cost.
Known methods for fabrication of these hybrids include (i) simply mixing CNTs and layered graphite oxide with the assistance of ultrasonic treatment,9 (ii) using chemically derived layered graphene as the starting material followed by the growth of CNTs via thermal chemical vapour deposition (CVD),10 (iii) chemically grafting CNTs onto layered graphene,11,12 and (iv) forming layered graphene on a CNT network.13–16 These hybrid materials have great advantages in many applications such as mechanically compliant films, transparent conductive thin films, anodes for lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, reinforcing agents in nanocomposites, and biomedical imaging.17–21 Although these methods represent a great advance in the development of carbon nanomaterials, they are severely limited by the facts (i) that they require multi-stage fabrication processes resulting in high costs, (ii) that the combination between graphene and CNTs is weak since they are not born as twins, and (iii) that the graphene used is actually reduced graphene oxide which has a high ID/IG ratio and thus low structural integrity and electrical conductivity. A simple process, producing a hybrid of CNTs and graphene simultaneously in a one-pot process, is urgently needed in this century of energy and environment conservation.
Synthesis gas (syngas), a fuel gas mixture consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is usually produced by dry reforming of CO2 and CH4 in the presence of either a metal or a zeolite catalyst under conventional thermal energy. As a new heating source for syngas, microwave has received increasingly more attention because of (i) its user friendliness including noncontact, rapid heating and quick start-up and drop-off, and (ii) unique features, i.e. selectivity on target heating materials, heating from the interior of a material and volumetric heating (rapid energy transfer across a target material). Dielectrics are the materials absorbing microwave irradiation, such as metal-based catalysts, while gases do not absorb any microwave. Microwave is thus an ideal heating source in syngas production. Carbonaceous materials are often formed on catalysts and they need to be suppressed, reduced and even frequently removed for high catalyst efficiency. On the other hand, turning catalysis conditions may produce either graphene or CNTs, but it is unknown whether a CNT–graphene hybrid can be produced via syngas production. A hypothesis made herein was that, by carefully selecting metal-based catalysts, we should be able to fabricate CNT–graphene hybrids via syngas production; that is, we turn carbonaceous materials undesired in the production process into valuable hybrids of carbon nanomaterials. To the best of our knowledge, the growth of porous, crumpled and loose nanomaterial hybrids via syngas production has not been reported.
In this article, we present a simple, novel strategy to develop a number of carbon nanomaterial hybrids via syngas production, by investigating various catalysts coupled with the advantages of microwave heating. While either Cr or Ni alone cannot produce the hybrids, a Cr–Ni alloy is an ideal system due to its moderate, controllable carbon solubility.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Metal precursors, including nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), cerium nitrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O), chromium nitrate (Cr(NO3)3·9H2O) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), were all purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. Commercial MWCNTs (outer diameter: 10–20 nm) was purchased from Chengdu organic Chemicals, China.
2.2. Fabrication of catalysts
The CeO2 nanorods were synthesized through a hydrothermal process. To be specific, 60 mL of NaOH solution (9.17 mol L−1) was added dropwise to cerium(III) nitrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O solution (0.46 mol L−1)) under continuous stirring for 60 min forming a milky slurry. The slurry was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated in an electric oven for 72 hours at 100 °C. The precipitates were filtered, washed with deionized water and left to dry in an oven overnight at 100 °C. The material was then calcined in air at 500 °C for 5 h, with a heating ramp of 5 °C min−1. This produced ceria support. The support was co-impregnated with solutions of (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Cr(NO3)3·9H2O) under magnetic stirring at 60 °C, to obtain the Cr–Ni/CeO2 catalyst containing 40 wt% Ni and 2 wt% Cr. This was followed by drying in an oven at 100 °C overnight and calcination at 400 °C for 2 h in air. In order to fully understand the role played by the catalyst in the production of the carbonaceous nanohybrids, more catalysts (Fe–Ni/CeO2 and Ni–CeO2) were synthesized using the same procedure. Table 1 summarizes the catalyst compositions, catalyst acronyms and the product name of the carbonaceous hybrids formed on each catalysts.

2.3. Synthesis of carbon nanotube–layered graphene hybrids
The hybrids were directly grown on catalysts that act as substrates via syngas production under atmospheric pressure by a microwave reactor (SAIREM) consisting of a reaction chamber and microwave transparent walls. The output power of the microwave generator could be changed continuously from 0 to 2000 W at a fixed frequency of 2.45 GHz. After 500 mg of the catalyst was loaded into the chamber, it was pumped down for about 1 h. The chamber was connected to a vacuum system with a typical base pressure of ∼10−2 Torr maintained by a rotary vacuum pump. Once the pressure was stable, H2 gas (15 cm3 min−1) was introduced into the chamber, and then the microwave power was increased to 120 W and maintained within the plasma zone for 30 min. After the chamber was purged with argon gas for ∼45 min, the reactant gases were introduced into the system. A feed with a constant CH4/CO2 molar ratio of 1:1 was used throughout the experiments, with a gas flow rate of 35 cm3 min−1 and at a constant microwave power of 500 W for 14 h time-on-stream (TOS). The product composition was analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a Porapak Q column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A detailed description of the microwave processing conditions applied in H2 plasma reduction and in the catalytic reaction under microwave irradiation can be found in our previous report.22 The etching of the metal substrate from the samples was done by dissolving 100 mg of the spent catalyst in 3 M HCl. The mixture was stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 2 h at 80 °C, then the mixture was filtered, washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 24 h.
2.4. Characterization of samples
Phase purity of the catalysts was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in a Bruker Advanced X-ray diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu Kα X-ray source radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å) and operated at 40 kV and 40 mA under the following conditions: a scan speed of 2° min−1 and a measurement range, 2θ = 10–90°.
Samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were sonically dispersed in ethanol and transferred to carbon-coated copper grids. TEM observations were conducted using a JEOL 1010 electron microscope. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was done using a JEOL 2100 microscope operated at 200 kV. The samples were prepared by dipping a carbon film-coated Cu micro grid into the suspension.
Raman spectra were collected with a Renishaw inVia Raman spectrometer equipped with a Leica DMLM microscope and a 514 nm Ar+ ion laser as an excitation source. A ×50 objective of 8 mm optical length was used to focus the depolarized laser beam on a spot of ∼3 μm in diameter, with the laser power at 2.0 mW. The Raman scattering was collected with a CCD array detector in the 100–700 cm−1 spectral region with a resolution of 2 cm−1. Each spectrum is the average of 20 scans with an exposure time of 10 s for each scan.
Carbon formation was quantitatively analyzed on a Perkin Elmer STA 6000 thermal analyzer under air atmosphere in addition to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100). The carbon formation was also analyzed using Laser-Raman spectra, recorded in the range of 1000–2000 cm−1 using a laser excitation wavelength of 514 nm.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were acquired on a Kratos Axis ULTRA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer incorporating a 165 mm hemispherical electron energy analyser and a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation at 150 W (15 kV, 10 mA). Survey (wide) scans were taken at analyser pass energy of 160 eV and multiplex (narrow) high resolution scans at 20 eV. Base pressure in the analysis chamber was 1.0 × 10−9 Torr and it increased to 1.0 × 10−8 Torr during sample analysis. The binding energies were determined using the C 1s line at 284.6 eV from adventitious carbon as a reference. Recorded spectra were fitted using Gaussian–Lorentzian curves in order to determine the binding energies of the different element core levels more accurately.
The N2 adsorption measurements of the calcined samples were performed using a Tristar II 3020 analyzer. Surface area calculations were carried out using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) methods, while pore size distribution was estimated from the desorption branch of the isotherms using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed at 150 °C for 12 h under high vacuum.
The electrochemical measurement was performed on an Autolab PGSTAT302N workstation with 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte in a three-electrode cell. The working electrodes were prepared by mixing the carbonaceous materials (95 wt%) with polytetrafluoroethylene (5 wt%) and pressed on a stainless steel mesh. A graphite foil was used as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode was applied as the reference electrode. The mass loading of the electrode material was about 2–3 mg cm−2. The electrolyte was introduced by vacuum impregnation, and the cell was immersed in the electrolyte 24 h before measurement. The capacitive performance of samples was characterized by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) techniques. The specific gravimetric capacitance of the working electrode, C (in F g−1), was obtained from the discharge curve according to the following equation: C = I × Δt/(m × ΔV), where I is the current load (A), Δt is the discharge time (s), ΔV is the potential change during discharge (V), and m is the mass loading on working electrode (g).
3. Results and discussion
In typical syngas production, the carbonaceous materials formed on the catalysts need to be suppressed, reduced and even removed as a waste to improve catalyst efficiency. As shown in Scheme 1, we converted this waste into valuable nanocarbon hybrids by syngas production. Table 2 summarizes the reaction conditions, carbon yield and the type of carbonaceous material formed on the different catalysts. The catalytic activity in CO2 reforming of methane shows similar CO2 conversion rates of ∼95% for both 2Cr–Ni and 2Fe–Ni systems whose full names are shown in Table 1, while ∼91% is observed on Ni–CeO2 after 14 h time-on-stream (TOS). Similarly, higher CH4 conversion rates of ∼92% and ∼91% are recorded over 2Cr–Ni and 2Fe–Ni, respectively, while ∼88% is observed on Ni–CeO2 after 2 h TOS. All systems exhibit CO/H2 molar ratios between 1.1 and 1.5 over the whole TOS. The high CO/H2 ratios observed in all systems were caused by the occurrence of reversed water–gas shift reaction, which increases the CO formation rate with reduction in the H2 formation rate.

Using an infrared temperature sensor attached to the microwave reactor, the temperature on the catalyst surface during the catalytic process was measured. The lowest temperature of ∼936 °C was noticed on 2Cr–Ni, while the highest temperature ∼1006 °C was observed on Ni–CeO2. Through syngas production, various catalyst systems produced different quantities of carbonaceous materials, i.e. 0.61, 0.67 and 0.63 g deposited on 2Cr–Ni, 2Fe–Ni and Ni–CeO2, respectively. Although the carbon yield on these catalysts is low in terms of the time consumed, scale-up production in industry would markedly improve these yields. Furthermore, the formation of these materials poses no negative effect on the syngas production due to their excellent microwave absorption properties. We have ,in the following sections, investigated the morphology, structural integrity, composition and structure of these hybrids.

Fig. 1–3 show HRTEM micrographs of the multi-walled carbon nanotube–graphene hybrid (MW–G) produced by syngas production using 2Cr–Ni as the substrate. A typical bird’s eye view of the hybrid shown in Fig. 1a and b shows continuous, wrinkled and transparent few-layer graphene with a lateral size of ∼113 nm. MWCNTs have inner and outer diameters in the range of 9–11 nm and 36–44 nm, respectively (Fig. 1c and d). Interestingly, we observed a piece of much larger, few-layer graphene of ∼327 nm in length and ∼64 nm in width, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. These few-layer graphene were found wrinkled into many overlapped regions, likely due to the strong van der Waals interactions between these thin layers. Also, some graphene sheets were found rolling around MWCNTs (Fig. 2a), indicating the capacity of MWCNTs to attract and guide the self-assembly of graphene nanosheets on their external surfaces.23

 Fig. 2  HRTEM micrographs of MWCNT–layered graphene hybrid (MW–G) formed on 2Cr–Ni substrate. 

Fig. 2c shows layered graphene with folded edges, while a cross-sectional view of the suspended edge of graphene layers shows graphene sheets consisting of four layers only as pointed out in Fig. 2d. Adjacent interlayer distance in the graphene film was measured to be ∼0.34 nm, which is the d-spacing of the (002) crystal plane (0.335 nm) of bulk graphite with slight distortion.24Fig. 2e and f show a network of interconnected MWCNTs with crumpled graphene layers partially filling the intertube void space. This is because graphene featuring many π-conjugated aromatic domains in its basal plane can strongly interact with the MWCNT surface through π–π attractions.
A graphene sheet showing light color in Fig. 3a appears to consist of a few graphene layers, and its surface is not perfectly flat due to the presence of a few wrinkles. As shown in Fig. 3b, the number of graphene layers was measured as 4–7. In Fig. 3c, the layered graphene can be seen like a large crumpled paper; while a more accurate analysis of the crystallinity of graphene sheets is shown in Fig. 3d. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern in the inset clearly shows the crystalline nature of the graphene sheet. Fig. 3e shows the presence of MWCNTs with layered graphene sheets of folded edges. In Fig. 3f, the FFT pattern of the MWCNT consists of sharp spots, confirming their crystallinity.

In order to fully understand the role played by 2Cr–Ni substrate in the growth of multi-walled carbon nanotube–graphene hybrid (MW–G), Cr in the substrate was replaced by Fe. Fig. 4 contains HRTEM images of the MWCNT–cup-stacked CNT hybrid (MW–CSCNT) produced on 2Fe–Ni via syngas production, where MWCNTs of different lengths and sizes can be observed. The inner diameters of the MWCNTs are in the range of 7–20 nm, as shown in Fig. 4a. The diameters of some MWCNTs were found to be much larger than those obtained in MW–G. This might be due to Fe increasing the aggregation rate of the metal, thereby modifying the crystal structure of Ni, and this caused the enlargement of metal particles and then the larger-diameter MWCNTs. In addition to the MWCNTs, CSCNTs of various diameters noticed on 2Fe–Ni (Fig. 4b) have a large hollow tubular structure with open ends. Such morphological properties make them structurally similar to many truncated conical graphene layers, different from conventional CNTs made up of multi-seamless cylinders of hexagonal carbon networks.25,26Fig. 4c and d show cup-stacked carbon nanotubes of ∼1.4 μm in length, similar to tubes fabricated by multi-step methods.27–29

The MWCNT–graphitic nanofiber hybrid (MW–GNF) observed on the mono-metallic incorporated cerium catalyst (Ni–CeO2) is presented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a reveals the presence of MWCNTs of various lengths and sizes, along with interlocked bundles (carbon donut) of GNF. The MWCNTs have lengths of 1–4 μm, with inner diameters of 9–15 nm. As shown in Fig. 5b, the interlocked GNFs are ∼84.3 nm in width with their ends interwoven. Fig. 5c and d contain TEM images of MWCNTs and herringbone (or fishbone) GNFs produced on Ni–CeO2. Unlike MWCNTs, herringbone GNFs are solid inside and have many twisted edges on the outermost wall.

Raman scattering is highly sensitive to the electronic structure and proves essential to characterize carbonaceous materials. Raman spectroscopy analysis has been conducted on the treated carbonaceous materials formed on the different substrates. Fig. 6 shows the Raman spectra of the multi-walled carbon nanotube–graphitic nanofiber hybrid (MW–GNF), multi-walled carbon nanotube–graphene hybrid (MW–G) and multi-walled carbon nanotube–cup-stacked CNT hybrid (MW–CSCNT). Raman spectra for all samples show a G band at about 1577 cm−1 that corresponds to the E2g tangential stretching mode of an ordered graphite structure with sp2 hybridization and a D band at about 1346 cm−1 relating to the disorder-induced phonon mode due to finite size crystals and defects.30 All samples also exhibit absorptions between 2680–2730 cm−1 which is assigned to the first overtone of the D mode and often called the Gl or 2D band. This is an important band in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which gives information about the degree of nanotube crystallinity.31 The 2D band can also be used to confirm the co-existence of carbon nanotubes and graphene. The 2D band noticed on MW–G contains a shoulder at 2715 cm−1, indicating the presence of graphene layers but with carbon nanotubes in abundance; this observation is consistent with the work of Li et al.13 where two shoulders were observed at 2D: one corresponding to graphene and the other relating to CNTs. Although all these samples demonstrate similar absorptions, differences can be distinguished between MW–G and MW–CSCNT and MW–GNF. The former two samples show around 210% and 170% enhancement in the 2D intensity than the third, suggesting an increment in the degree of crystallinity. The radial breathing mode (RBM), corresponding to the atomic vibration of the carbon atoms in the radial direction was not observed for all samples, confirming the absence of single-walled carbon nanotubes. The ratio of D and G band intensities (ID/IG) is known to correlate with the in-plane crystal domain size and has been used to estimate the degree of disorder in graphitic carbon or, conversely, the extent of edge plane graphite.32 An ID/IG ratio near zero indicates high crystallinity (order) and a ratio close to or greater than one demonstrates high disorder due to abundant defects in the graphitic structure. The ID/IG ratios of the carbonaceous materials are within the range of 0.15 to 0.40, indicating a very low concentration of structural defects. The lowest ID/IG ratio (0.15) was observed on MW–G, indicating a carbonaceous material of high structural integrity. MW–CSCNT gave slightly higher ID/IG ratio (0.37) than MW–GNF (0.35), suggesting that the addition of Fe to the nickel substrate increased the defect concentration.

Fig. 7 shows deconvolution of the C 1s peaks in MW–G, MW–CSCNT and MW–GNF, where a main peak at 284.1–284.6 eV is attributed to the graphitic structure. The peaks observed at 285.5–285.9 eV can be assigned to defects, i.e., C atoms which are no longer in a crystalline lattice,33,34 while the peaks centered at about 286.9, 288.6 and 289.9 eV correspond to the C–O, O–CO and carbonates, respectively.35 Furthermore, the π–π* transition loss peak is also detected at ∼291.3 eV. The peak observed at 286.5 eV on the MW–G can be assigned to epoxide (C–O–C) groups, implying that the hybrid can be surface-modified by the reactions of the hybrid's epoxide groups and organic surfactant's end-amine groups.36,37 The results of the deconvolution analyses are summarized in Table 3, which shows that the number of defects in our samples is quite low. The dominance of the C–C peak in all samples also suggests that the number of oxygen-containing functionalities in our hybrids is extremely low.

MW–G, MW–CSCNT and MW–GNF exhibit obvious diffraction patterns in the range of 22–27° (in Fig. 8), which are assigned to the [002] planes of the hexagonal graphite structure. These patterns are broader and lower than that of the well-crystallized graphite. The low intensity of the [002] peaks in MW–G, MW–CSCNT and MW–GNF indicates higher nanotube alignment within the composite materials.38 The [002] pattern of multi-walled carbon nanotube–graphene hybrid (MW–G) is found at 2θ = 26.19°, while for MW–GNF and MW–CSCNT, the peaks shifted to 26.48° and 26.41°, respectively. Note that the peak position of MW–GNF is closer to that of the graphite (26.62°) as compared with the other two samples. According to Bragg's law (nλ = 2dsinθ), calculation of the interlayer spacing of these materials reveals the following sequence for the d002 spacing: MW–G > MW–CSCNT > MW–GNF. MW–G and MW–CSCNT possess the d002 spacing of 3.400 Å and 3.372 Å, respectively, while the spacing of MW–GNF (3.364 Å) is much closer to the crystal graphite (3.348 Å). The variation in the [002] plane spacing is attributed to the different interactions between the metal substrate and carbonaceous materials. That is, the 2Cr–Ni substrate showed much higher influence on the hybrid produced than the Ni–CeO2 substrate, leading to the resemblance of the MW–GNF hybrid to graphite.
 Fig. 8  XRD patterns of MW–G, MW–CSCNT and MW–GNF. 
We measured the electrocapacitive performance of the MWCNT–graphene (MW–G), MWCNT–cup-stacked CNT (MW–CSCNT), MWCNT–graphitic nanofibers (MW–GNF) and commercial MWCNTs used as a reference material. Fig. 9a and b show cyclic voltammetry (CV) behaviours of these materials at 50 and 200 mV s−1, respectively. At a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 9a), the quasi-rectangular shapes of the three hybrids indicate the capacitive behaviour of an electric double layer. The slightly distorted CV curve of MWCNTs implies their higher resistance than the hybrids. This became more obvious at a higher scan rate of 200 mV s−1 (Fig. 9b), where the heaviest distortion of MWCNTs is seen but this is not the case for the hybrids. Such marked rate performance implies the fast charge–discharge advantages of our hybrids, which might be attributed to the presence of graphene, cup-stacked CNT and graphitic nanofibers, loosening the entanglements of CNT and preventing graphene stacking, as confirmed in the foregoing TEM analysis. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements were conducted at current densities from 0.2 A g−1 to 5 A g−1 to investigate further. Fig. 9c shows GCD curves of all samples at 0.2 A g−1. At such a small current density, all the samples show quasi-triangular shapes with hardly observed IR drops, indicative again of the electric double layer mechanism. However, at a higher current density of 2 A g−1 (Fig. 9d), MWCNTs have the most serious IR drop (∼0.21 V), meaning a large amount of energy is wasted rather than stored. In other words, the three hybrids (MW–CSCNT, MW–GNF and MW–G) are more favourable to achieve higher power densities when used as electrodes for supercapacitors due to their low resistance, consistent with their remarkable rectangular CV shape as displayed in Fig. 9b. The superior rate performance of the hybrids is also closely related to their unique architecture as shown in Fig. 1–5. Fig. 9e compares the variation of specific capacitance against current density. The hybrid materials all demonstrate higher performance than commercial MWCNTs at the smallest current density 0.2 A g−1, with values of 60, 51.5, 51 and 43 F g−1 for MW–GNF, MW–G, MW–CSCNT and MWCNTs, respectively. MW–GNF and MW–G show higher specific capacitance than MWCNTs over the whole current density range, whereas the specific capacitance of MW–CSCNT dropped significantly with increase in current load. The best capacitive performance exhibited by MW–GNF might be due to the presence of graphitic edge planes on the walls of GNFs (see Fig. 5). Both basal and edge planes associated with the nature of chemical bonding in graphite generally exhibit completely different electrochemical properties.39 The graphitic edge planes present on the walls of GNFs have been shown to exhibit ∼30 times higher capacitance and orders of magnitude higher electron-transfer rates than basal planes.40,41 Therefore, the presence of abundant edge planes in the MW–GNF hybrid would have facilitated faster electrode kinetics than other hybrids. The higher performance demonstrated by the hybrids than commercial MWCNTs at a minimal current density 0.2 A g−1, can be ascribed to the presence of layered graphene, cup-stacked CNTs and graphitic nanofibers. Considering the dependence of the discharge current density as plotted in Fig. 9f, the nearly linear dependence of MW–GNF and MW–G reveals an excellent rate capability, while a slight deviation of current density from linearity is shown for MW–CSCNT. In contrast, a heavy deviation is observed for the commercial MWCNT at scan rates above 100 mV s−1 indicating that its use for faster energy storage demands is impractical. The desired linear current behaviour of the hybrids at high scan rates can be attributed to the enhanced electrolyte ion diffusion, while the deviation of MWCNTs indicates the limitation of electrolyte ion diffusion into the electrode.

3.1. Mechanism of the hybrid formation
Commonly used substrates in CVD are graphite, quartz, silicon, silicon carbide, silica, alumina, zeolite, etc.; their surface morphology and textural properties are known to play a significant role in the quality and yield of the carbon materials. In contrast, ceria has rarely been used as a catalyst support for the growth of carbonaceous materials including multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), graphene and graphitic nanofibers (GNF). Ceria nanomaterials (CeO2) were used as a catalyst support in this present study, whose morphology is presented in Fig. 10. These nanomaterials consist mainly of ceria nanorods and nanoparticles. The nanorods expose preferentially the well-defined (100) and the (111) planes and have a diameter of 7.5 ± 2.2 nm and length of 20–29 nm. Since the chemical properties of the substrate surface pose a direct influence on the morphology of the carbonaceous materials, the surface composition of the freshly reduced substrate materials was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Table 4). As expected, the highest concentration of Ni species was observed on Ni–CeO2 surface, while a low concentration of nickel species was noticed on 2Cr–Ni (0.44). This result indicates that partial surface coverage by Ni species has occurred during the catalyst preparation by co-doping metal oxides.

The hybrids were produced via a selective heating mechanism, since the absorption of microwave radiation solely depends on the properties of the target materials. How rapidly a substrate can be heated in a microwave field is dependent on its dielectric loss tangent: tanδ = ε′′/ε′, where ε′ and ε′′ represent the dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor, respectively. Therefore, a substrate must possess a value of tanδ higher than 0.1 to convert a maximum quantity of microwave energy into thermal energy. When we performed control experiments using only the CeO2 support, neither syngas nor CNT formation was observed because CeO2 could not absorb microwave energy. Whilst we performed a control experiment under identical conditions except with low loadings of Ni (10–35 wt%) on the CeO2 support, microwave did not stimulate the breakdown of CO2 and CH4 gases, and there was no evidence of either CNT or syngas formation, both of which are explained below. Although nickel catalyst can absorb microwave energy due to its dielectric loss tangent higher than 0.1 (tanδ ≈ 1.7),42 the absorbed energy dissipates rapidly through the CeO2 support. As a result, the substrate temperature cannot reach the temperature required for the formation of either CNT or syngas. These observations clarify the selective heating mechanism of the substrate under present experimental conditions.
In the synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotube–graphene hybrids (MW–G), the formation of the CNTs and the layered-graphene should be two independent processes. Scheme 2 presents the possible growth mechanism of MW–G on 2Cr–Ni substrate.

The growth of graphene usually occurs by exposure of the transition metal surface to a hydrocarbon gas under low pressure or ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Incorporation of Cr3+ into Ni–CeO2 directly affects its dielectric properties, resulting in a change in the microwave absorption properties of the 2Cr–Ni substrate. Cr exhibits a low microwave absorption property (tanδ = 0.0002427)43 and it is even considered transparent to microwave radiation. Substitution of a fraction of Ni3+ by Cr3+ would lead to reduction in the dielectric loss tangent (tanδ) of 2Cr–Ni. In our process, the growth of the layered-graphene is likely to occur due to the precipitation of crystalline carbon species in the Cr–Ni system, where Ni particles exist on the ceria nanorods whose surface are not fully modified by Cr; these particles may catalyze the growth of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The formation of MWCNTs on Cr particles is unlikely due to the low carbon solubility in Cr.44 Additionally, the Cr–C equilibrium phase diagram indicates that Cr has a strong tendency for carbide formation, causing adverse conditions for graphite or CNT formation.45,46 Deposition temperature has been known to determine the thickness and quality of graphene and graphite films.47 Therefore, formation of the hybrid might also have been facilitated by the moderation of the temperature (936 °C, see Table 2) due to the presence of Cr in the 2Cr–Ni system, resulting in lower carbon solubility and subsequent formation of layered graphene.
To further understand the growth mechanism of multi-walled carbon nanotube–graphene hybrid (MW–G) on Cr–Ni, we investigated substrates Ni–CeO2 and 2Fe–Ni under the same synthesis conditions. Ni–CeO2 produced a hybrid of MWCNTs and interlocked bundles of graphitic nanofibers (MW–GNF), while 2Fe–Ni resulted in a hybrid of MWCNTs and cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (MW–CSCNT). Scheme 3 presents the possible growth mechanism of MW–CSCNT on 2Fe–Ni.
 Scheme 3  Possible growth mechanism of MWCNT–cup-stacked CNT hybrid (MW–CSCNT). 
Dielectric materials with large penetration depths can be readily heated by microwave irradiation, while metals with high conductance have small penetration depths.48 Therefore, heating would only be confined to the thin surface layer of metals. 3d transition metal, such as Fe, is regarded as a good conductor that reflects microwave at the surface producing a small penetration depth. The penetration depth is larger for nanoparticles than for micro-particles; the volumetric heat produced by nanoparticles would also be much higher.49 Presence of Fe in 2Fe–Ni system changed the composition of the substrate surface leading to an increase in the dielectric loss tangent. It is known that both MWCNTs and CSCNTs can be grown by (i) diffusion of carbon (via catalytic decomposition of carbon-containing gases) through a metal catalyst and (ii) precipitation as graphitic filaments. Formation of MW–CSCNT on 2Fe–Ni is not surprising, since Fe and its alloys have been reported to produce platelets and tubular carbon nanofibers at both low and high temperatures.50,51 Rodriguez et al.52 reported that ribbon-like or tubular fibers were formed at high temperatures (950 K), regardless of the particle size of the catalyst. Therefore, the change in the dielectric loss tangent (tanδ) of 2Fe–Ni as well as the selective heating process of microwave might have created temperatures high enough to promote the growth of cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNT). The growth of MWCNTs might also be facilitated by the presence of Fe.
In the case of the mono-metallic incorporated cerium substrate (Ni–CeO2), MWCNTs and interlocked bundles of GNF were observed. Scheme 4 presents the possible growth mechanism of MW–GNF on Ni–CeO2.
 Scheme 4  Possible growth mechanism of the MWCNT–graphitic nanofiber hybrid (MW–GNF). 
Two major factors including hydrogen and the metal–support interaction might play a dominant role in the formation of these interlocked bundles of GNFs on Ni–CeO2. Hydrogen is known for its effect on the formation of nanofibers.53 On the one hand, hydrogen in abundance can terminate the large number of dangling bonds at the edges of the stacked graphene; however on the other hand, graphene itself would consume the dangling bonds to produce closed carbon nanotubes if hydrogen atoms are not available. In the latter case, the tubes are hollow because too much energy is required to precipitate the curved planes. Since the GNFs formed on Ni–CeO2 are not hollow, the formation of the interlocked GNF bundles in relation to hydrogen might be ruled out.
Another key feature that might influence the formation of the interlocked GNFs is the interaction between metal nanoparticles and the ceria support, since the interaction can alter the electronic structure of Ni nanoparticles and consequently affect the yield and morphology of the carbonaceous materials. Using our selective heating mechanism, the carbon atom dissolution and diffusion through the Ni nanoparticles are solely determined by electron affinity properties between Ni, the CeO2 support and the carbon atoms. Temperature may promote the formation of interlocked GNFs, because increasing temperature favours the reaction kinetics, which was reported for producing thick carbon nanofibers (non-catalytic CVD coated MWCNTs).54 By absorbing much microwave energy, Ni nanoparticles interact with the CeO2 support, generating a high temperature of 1006 °C which leads to formation of the interlocked GNF.
4. Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized a number of multi-walled carbon nanotube hybrids by varying the metal substrate that also acts as a catalyst for syngas production. This one-pot synthesis route markedly prevented the entanglement of MWCNTs and stacking of graphene layers. The Cr–Ni substrate led to the growth of a MWCNT–graphene hybrid (MW–G), while the Fe–Ni substrate produced a MWCNT–cup-stacked CNT hybrid (MW–CSCNT). In the case of the mono-metallic incorporated cerium substrate, a MWCNT–graphitic nanofiber hybrid (MW–GNF) was observed. The morphology and composition of these hybrids determine their electrochemical performance. The hybrids showed higher specific capacitance than commercial MWCNTs, with values of 60, 51.5, 51 and 43 F g−1 for MW–GNF, MW–G, MW–CSCNT and MWCNTs, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve showed that our hybrids have lower resistance than MWCNTs. We turned the waste in syngas production into valuable electrode materials for energy storage devices. These hybrids may have many other applications, such as in adsorption, biosensors and batteries.
