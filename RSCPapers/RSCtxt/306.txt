    , Accepted 17th January 2023First published on 18th January 2023AbstractAsymmetric nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) are an attractive candidate for high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs), whereas effective asymmetric strategies are highly needed to further advance their device performance. Herein, by alternating the substituted position of trifluorobenzene (Ar3F) in the terminal end group, two asymmetric NFA isomers, namely BTP-γ-Ar3F and BTP-β-Ar3F, are designed, and their photophysical and photovoltaic properties are fully compared. With the γ-substituted fashion, it is shown that BTP-γ-Ar3F features a better planarity, contributing to stronger crystallization and favorable phase separation with the PM6 donor polymer. As a result, a higher power conversion efficiency of 17.42% along with a high open circuit voltage of 0.90 V is realized in the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F-based OSCs. The established structure–property relationship provides a rational design principle for asymmetric NFAs toward high photovoltaic performance.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as a promising renewable energy technology due to their distinctive advantages of low-cost, light weight, and flexible processing.1–6 Rapid progress in material designing and device engineering promotes the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs approaching 19% toward commercialization7–12 wherein, molecular engineering of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in terms of molecular geometry, energy levels, and crystallization behavior is demonstrated as an effective strategy in realizing outstanding power output in devices.13–17 Despite that, effective strategies for molecular engineering are still limited. Thus, it's highly desirable to explore new strategies for advancing this promising renewable energy technology.
Recently, asymmetric structures have been well utilized to finely modulate the dipole moment, optical/electrochemical properties, and molecular packing behavior of organic semiconductors.18–22 It is well accepted that the regional dipole moment induced by the terminal asymmetry strategy can control the intermolecular interaction and optimize the crystallization and microstructure.23 Particularly, in the high-performing Y-series NFAs,24–27 the asymmetry variations in the heteroarene core unit,10,28–32 side chain,33,34 or terminal acceptor end unit35–42 offered various high-performance NFAs. For instance, the variation of the electron-deficient terminals in NFAs resulted in symmetric BO-5Cl; this approach produced not only a high electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (0.1%) in combination with the PM6 polymer donor, but also better interfacial energetics as a third component in ternary OSCs, leading to a certified 18.2% PCE. Moreover, the additional isomerization of asymmetric NFAs leads to more effective molecular packing and charge hopping in the solid state, fine-tuning the electronic structure.43,44 Based on a given asymmetric heteroheptacene-based NFA, Yang and co-workers found that alternation of the thiophene site in the conjugated core offered an enhanced planar structure with tighter molecular packing in ThPy6 NFA, contributing to a greatly suppressed non-radiative recombination and a decent fill factor (FF) of 78.9% in OSCs.45 On the other hand, the introduction of a noncovalent conformation lock (O⋯H) in the asymmetric isomer of TB-S1-O provides adjustable compatibility with the host matrix to form an interpenetrating network nanostructure, delivering efficient charge generation and dissociation.46 Thus, the isomerization of asymmetric NFAs offers an effective avenue for further regulation of the physical properties of NFAs for efficient carrier management in OSCs.47–49 However, due to limited chemical approaches, design principles of asymmetric NFA isomers are quite obscure; and as a result, an insightful understanding of the synergetic effect of asymmetry and isomerization on device performance is still not explored yet.
In this work, considering the strong electrostatic effect of fluorobenzene groups, we designed two asymmetric NFA isomers by alternating the substituted position of trifluorobenzene (Ar3F) on the benzene unit of the 1,1-dicyano-methylene-3-indanone (IC) terminal end group through the intramolecular noncovalent interaction (INCI) strategy.17,50,51 The advantages of conjugation extension and fluorination are combined to enhance carrier mobility, improve the molecular packing for more efficient charge transfer, and so on.52–54 Both theoretical calculation and experimental characterization were carried out to clarify the isomeric effect on their photophysical and photovoltaic properties. It was shown that the isomeric position has a negligible effect on their frontier energy levels but a strong effect on their aggregation behavior. Furthermore, the BTP-γ-Ar3F NFA with the γ-substitution fashion possesses better molecular planarity, contributing to an enhanced crystallinity character. The optimal morphology together with suppressed carrier recombination helps to realize an outstanding PCE of 17.42% with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.904 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 25.72 mA cm−2, and FF value of 74.92% in the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F-based OSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Materials design and synthesis
Two asymmetric isomers, namely BTP-γ-Ar3F and BTP-β-Ar3F, were designed and are shown in Fig. 1a. First, an isomeric mixture of Br-IC was crystallized from different solvents to afford IC-β-Br (2) and IC-γ-Br (3), following a method described by He.55 The two isomeric terminals, IC-β-Ar3F (4) and IC-γ-Ar3F (5), were obtained through a Suzuki coupling reaction with the brominated IC terminal-end group (compound 2 and 3) using Pd(dppf)Cl2 as the catalyst, which was subsequently mixed with fluorinated IC (F-IC) to carry out the Lewis-acid catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation56 with the aromatic-core-based mono-aldehyde (compound 6, obtained according to a previous report57) to produce the target NFAs. Compared with the classical pyridine-catalyzed method, the new approach provides facile access to NFAs with easier work-up.56 The chemical structures were fully verified using MALDI-TOF-MS, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR spectra (Fig. S1–S11†) provided in the ESI.†

2.2 Physical and chemical properties
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to clarify the influence of isomeric substitution on the molecular geometries. As shown in Fig. 1b, the dihedral angles between the fused aromatic core for the end groups of IC-γ-Ar3F and IC-β-Ar3F are 0.16° and 0.24°, respectively. And in the given terminal end moiety, the dihedral angles between the IC group and Ar3F groups are 39.79° and 42.24° for IC-γ-Ar3F and IC-β-Ar3F, respectively. Thus, one can speculate that the BTP-γ-Ar3F possesses a relatively planar conformation that favors a tighter skeleton packing for carrier hopping. The UV–Vis absorption spectra of BTP-γ-Ar3F and BTP-β-Ar3F in solution and solid state are depicted in Fig. 2a. Both BTP-γ-Ar3F and BTP-β-Ar3F exhibit nearly coincident absorption features in chloroform solution, showing the maximum absorption peaks at 732 nm (Table 1). When turning into films, the maximum absorption peaks shift to 820 nm for BTP-β-Ar3F and 825 nm for TP-γ-Ar3F films, contributing to respective optical bandgaps of 1.32 and 1.33 eV. The slightly red-shifted profile of the BTP-γ-Ar3F film verifies its planer molecular structure and thus a tighter π–π stacking in the solid state can be expected.58,59 For the blend films with PM6 (Fig. S12†), they show broad absorption covering the visible and near-infrared region (Fig. S13†). From cyclic voltammetry measurement, the energy levels were measured with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, following the equation of ELUMO/HOMO = −e(Ered/ox + 4.8 − EFc/Fc+) (eV) where the unit of Ered/ox is V vs. Ag/AgCl and EFc/Fc+ is 0.434 V vs. Ag/AgCl in our measurement system. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of BTP-γ-Ar3F and BTP-β-Ar3F are calculated to be −3.85 eV/−5.64 eV and −3.87 eV/−5.66 eV, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 2b). The difference in their energy levels is related to the conjugation between the Ar3F group and the IC group (Fig. 1b). For the two NFA isomers, the variation in their ELUMO energy levels is consistent with the tendency observed in the DFT calculation (Table S1†).

Moreover, the thermal properties of two asymmetric NFAs were explored by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Both NFAs show high decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) up to 330 °C (Fig. S14†). However, in the DSC thermograms, the BTP-γ-Ar3F specimen exhibits a relatively lower exothermic transition (cold crystallization temperature) at 164 °C and higher endothermic transition (melting temperature) at 270 °C than those (respective values of 178 °C and 251 °C) of BTP-β-Ar3F (Fig. 2c and Table 1). The difference suggests that the isomeric substitution is a feasible methodology to regulate the aggregation behavior of the two new asymmetric NFAs, which was further discussed in terms of their crystallinity properties in films. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization was performed to unveil the molecular packing behavior in the solid state (Fig. 2d–f). Both neat BTP-γ-Ar3F and BTP-β-Ar3F films exhibit predominant π-face-on orientation, with the (010) lattice diffraction at around 1.54 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and the (100) lattice diffraction at around 0.36 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction. Based on the Scherrer equation, in the OOP direction, BTP-γ-Ar3F shows a coherence length (CCL) of 7.4 Å for the π–π stacking peaks, significantly larger than that (5.7 Å) of BTP-β-Ar3F; in the IP direction, BTP-γAr3F shows a larger CCL value of 31.6 Å for the lamellar stacking peak relative to that (6.3 Å) of BTP-β-Ar3F. Therefore, the packing of BTP-γ-Ar3F is slightly more ordered, and thus more conducive to carrier mobility. By fitting the data with the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model, BTP-γ-Ar3F has an electron mobility of 0.532 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1, which is higher than that of 0.396 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1 for BTP-β-Ar3F (Fig. S15†).
2.3 Photovoltaic performance
The impact of terminal isomerization on photovoltaic performance was investigated in the conventional architecture of ITO (tin-doped indium oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate)/PM6:NFAs/PDINN/Ag, where PDINN is the perylene-diimide derived cathode interlayer.60 The detailed device optimizations, including the D:A weight ratio, additive amount, post-annealing temperature, and solution concentration, are summarized in Table S2.† For the two new NFAs, champion devices are realized based on a PM6:NFA blend weight ratio of 1:1.2 dissolved in chloroform with the addition of 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) as an additive (0.25%, V/V). The representative J–V curves of optimal OSCs are plotted in Fig. 3b, and the corresponding device parameters are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that the two devices show a similar VOC output. The high VOC benefits from their high LUMO energy level. In comparison with the PCE of 16.56% for the PM6:BTP-β-Ar3F blend, the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F blend delivers a greater PCE of 17.42% along with a VOC of 0.904 V, JSC of 25.72 mA cm−2, and FF value of 74.92%. It is worth noting that the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F combination demonstrates a much more concentrated statistical PCE distribution, which is essential for practical application (Fig. 3c).

External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded to further reveal the photocurrent generation that accounts for the JSC output in OSCs. As illustrated in Fig. 3d, the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F system generates an overall higher photocurrent response than that of PM6:BTP-β-Ar3F in the wavelength range from 450 to 800 nm, contributing a higher integrated JSC value of 24.85 mA cm−2. The phenomenon is consistent with the measured JSC value via the J–V curve; the result signifies an enhanced exciton dissociation, charge transport, and collection process in the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F combination as discussed below.
2.4 Morphology
When combined with PM6, a desirable π-face-on orientation can still be observed for both blends, showing the (010) diffraction peaks at ca. 1.6 Å−1 in the OOP direction and the (100) diffraction peaks in the IP direction at ca. 0.31 Å−1 (Fig. 4a–c). With the isomer effect, BTP-γ-Ar3F-based blends show an increased CCL value both in the OOP direction and in the IP direction. As shown in Tables S3 and S4,† the CCL010 is increased from 36.0 Å for the BTP-β-Ar3F-based blend to 41.2 Å for the BTP-γ-Ar3F-based blend. In parallel, the CCL100 is increased from 83.7 Å for the BTP-β-Ar3F-based blend to 86.0 Å for the BTP-γ-Ar3F-based blend. The more ordered packing for the BTP-γ-Ar3F-based blend can facilitate carrier transport in devices.

To probe the surface and bulk morphology of blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements are carried out. As shown in Fig. S16–S17,† the BTP-γ-Ar3F neat film presents a defined fiber texture with a higher root mean square roughness (Rq) of 0.83 nm relative to that of 0.72 nm in the BTP-β-Ar3F neat film, which concurs with its stronger crystallinity characters observed in GIWAXS. Upon blending with PM6, the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F platform exhibits a higher Rq of 1.33 nm relative to that (1.22 nm) of the PM6:BTP-β-Ar3F combination (Fig. 4d and e). A higher degree of phase separation is further verified in the corresponding TEM images (Fig. 4f and g).
Additional melting temperatures of various PM6:NFA combinations were detected to estimate their corresponding Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ).61–63 As shown in Fig. S18,† the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F combination exhibits a higher χ parameter of 0.70 than that (χ = 0.59) of PM6:BTP-β-Ar3F. Note that the contact angle measurement can also be utilized to directly obtain the surface tension of each component and thus also shed light on the miscibility among each component in blends. Then, the surface tension (γ) was calculated by Owen's method and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S5.† The respective estimated surface tensions of BTP-γ-Ar3F, BTP-β-Ar3F, and PM6 are 29.17, 27.44, and 19.95 mN m−1, resulting in the χ parameter of 0.87 for the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F combination and 0.60 for the PM6:BTP-β-Ar3F combination (Fig. S19†). The result agrees well with that obtained via the melting point depression method. The higher χ parameter between PM6 and BTP-γ-Ar3F in their blend implies the existence of a stronger driving force for phase separation in the matrix, giving rise to a stronger tendency for phase separation of the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F blend.
2.5 Device physics
In addition, using the SCLC model, the electron mobilities (μe)/hole mobilities (μh) of PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F and PM6:BTP-β-Ar3F-based OSCs are calculated to be 1.987 × 10−4/3.021 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.466 × 10−4/2.455 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. 5a and Table S6†). The higher and more balanced charge carrier mobilities favor efficient charge transport and collection in the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F-based OSCs, accounting for the simultaneously improved FF and JSC in devices. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements of the blend films were carried out under 375 nm light excitation to compare their PL quenching efficiency (PLQE). Fig. 5b depicts that the PL quenching effect (PLQE: 91.9%) in the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F blend is comparatively more efficient than that of the PM6:BTP-β-Ar3F blend (PLQE: 90.1%). The higher PLQE observed in the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F blend suggests a more effective charge transfer process at their donor/acceptor interfaces, partly explaining its higher JSC value in devices.

To directly compare the charge carrier recombination behavior, the dependence of JSC (and VOC) on light intensity (P) is provided in Fig. 5c. In general, JSC and P follow the relationship of JSC ∝ Pα.64 The value of α should be 1 if the carriers are all extracted by the electrodes, while α < 1 indicates that there is some extent of bimolecular recombination. For BTP-γ-Ar3F and BTP-β-Ar3F-based OSCs, the values of α are 0.957 and 0.955, respectively. The result indicates a suppressed bimolecular recombination behavior for both cases under short-circuit conditions. For the dependence of VOC on P, the competition between the bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination makes the slope of VOCversus ln(P) lie between kT/q and 2kT/q.64 The devices using BTP-γ-Ar3F and BTP-β-Ar3F show respective slopes of 1.18kT/q and 1.23kT/q. The results suggest that the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F combination gives relatively lower trap-assisted recombination, which accounts for its better device performance.
Next, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on effective voltage (Veff) was extracted to gain insight into the exciton dissociation probability (P(E, T)) in devices. Jph is expressed as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities, respectively obtained under AM 1.5 G illumination and in the dark. Veff is expressed as Veff = V0 − Vbias,65 where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied external voltage bias. As shown in Fig. 5d, the Jph reaches saturation (Jsat) when the Veff is as high as ca. 1.5 V, which means all excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and then collected. The exciton dissociation probability (ηdiss) can be estimated according to the formula of ηdiss = Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions. As a result, the ηdiss values are 97.8% and 96.5% for the BTP-γ-Ar3F-based and BTP-β-Ar3F-based OSCs, revealing a relatively higher ηdiss in BTP-γ-Ar3F-based OSCs.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we developed two asymmetric NFAs by alternating the position of a π-extended terminal on the IC unit. In comparison with BTP-β-Ar3F, BTP-γ-Ar3F with the β-substituted fashion exhibits better planarity in molecular geometry, contributing to a favorable crystallinity, finer phase separation, and suppressed carrier combination with the PM6 donor polymer in the matrix. As a result, an outstanding PCE of 17.42% with a synergistically higher VOC of 0.904 V, JSC of 25.72 mA cm−2, and FF value of 74.92% was realized in the PM6:BTP-γ-Ar3F OSCs. The findings present a feasible approach to design an isometric terminal end group via a convenient Suzuki coupling reaction and shed light on the isomeric effect for regulating the molecular geometry, aggregation behavior, and photophysical and photovoltaic properties of new asymmetric NFAs. At the same time, as the two new NFAs possess high VOC, they are also promising to work as the third component in ternary devices to further increase the device performance.
