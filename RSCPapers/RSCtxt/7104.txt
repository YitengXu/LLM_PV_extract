    , Accepted 5th February 2023First published on 6th February 2023AbstractExploring the effects of different pretreatment methods on the properties of materials is of great significance for the effective utilization of waste biomass to produce high value-added porous carbon. Herein, the waste eucalyptus bark was used as a low-cost biomass resource to produce a series of biomass porous carbons (BPCs) for supercapacitor electrode materials. The effects of different pretreatment methods on the physicochemical structure and supercapacitor performance of BPCs obtained by KOH were investigated systematically. It was found that the BPCs prepared from different methods had certain differences in morphology, phase structure, porous properties and surface chemical properties, which resulted in a significant influence on supercapacitor performance. The hydrothermal pretreatment was conducive to form 3D honeycomb-like architectures with a hierarchical pore structure in the KOH activation process, which resulted in an excellent cycling stability. The pyrolysis pretreatment was beneficial to improve the graphitization degree of porous carbons and produce more micropores and oxygen-containing functional groups, which presented a lower equivalent series resistance and higher specific capacitance with poor rate behavior and cycling stability. Among them, the PBPC-600 electrode possessed a marvelous specific capacitance of 349.4 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, displaying great application potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors. Moreover, to meet the portable requirement, the PBPC-600 based symmetric quasi-solid-state supercapacitor was assembled, which achieved a remarkable energy density as high as 15.0 W h kg−1 at a power density of 160.0 W kg−1.
1. Introduction
With the resource depletion and environmental pollution caused by the massive consumption of fossil fuels becoming increasingly serious, fresh and environmentally friendly energy sources such as solar energy, hydroelectric energy, tidal energy and wind energy have been widely explored to replace traditional fossil fuels.1 The key to utilizing these non-dispatchable energy sources is to develop efficient energy conversion and storage devices.2 Apart from batteries and fuel cells, supercapacitors which serve as excellent energy storage devices with many amazing properties (such as super long cyclic life, fast charging/discharging capability, high power density and a wide operating temperature range) were considered as an ideal choice for efficient energy conversion and storage.3 The electrode materials were the most significant components to affect the specific capacitance and energy density of supercapacitors. Owing to the massive demands for the electrode materials of supercapacitors, low-cost and abundant materials for fabricating electrode materials with excellent performance were constantly explored. At present, plenty of various types of electrode materials such as porous carbon-based materials, conductive polymers, metal oxides and composite materials are developed and applied to supercapacitors.4 However, the low conductivity of metal oxides and poor cycle stability of conductive polymers limit their further development and practical applications.4 Compared to metal oxides and conductive polymers, carbon-based materials have more advantages due to their unique advantages such as high conductivity, good chemical/thermal stability and environmental adaptability.1,4–6 Different types of carbon-based materials with their own properties and advantages, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, carbon nanocages, and activated carbons, have been widely studied whereas, the high cost of raw materials and harsh preparation conditions limit the large-scale production and further commercial application.7 Therefore, it is urgent to find low-cost raw materials and explore simple and economical methods for the preparation of electrode materials with outstanding performance.
Plants, as the green and renewable biomass in nature, are abundant and inexpensive. Most plants are mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Plant materials, which usually have a natural unique intrinsic pore structure, high carbon content and rich functional groups, are suitable precursors for preparing biomass porous carbons (BPCs). Through a relative facile treatment, they can be converted into BPCs with large surface area, good electrical conductivity and excellent electrochemical performance. A series of plant resources, such as biomass shells,8,9 tea leaves,10–12 sugarcane baggase,13,14 tree products,15,16 rise husk17–19 and fruit peel,20–22 have been successfully processed into various high-performance BPCs. Meanwhile, a great amount of waste eucalyptus bark was incinerated or abandoned in the south China rural region, which led to waste of resources and environmental pollution. Thus, it inspires the idea of utilizing waste eucalyptus bark as a precursor for preparing high value-added BPCs, which is a meaningful way to utilize biomass waste for solving environmental pollution and energy storage problems.
To convert biomass into carbon materials towards energy storage, the process primarily involves different pretreatment methods and activation methods.5,7,23 Direct activation without pretreatment is a simple method for preparing porous carbon derived from biomass. Juan Du et al.24 successfully prepared nitrogen enriched porous carbons derived from carrot via a simple direct activation process, the obtained N-PC showed a high capacitance of 268 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Pyrolysis pretreatment and hydrothermal pretreatment are two conventional ways to convert biomass precursors into carbonaceous materials. The pretreatment processes are usually combined with subsequent activation to modify the chemical and physical properties of BPCs. The hydrothermal pretreatment is performed in an airtight water environment with self-generated pressure at low temperatures of 120–250 °C and the surface of the product (hydrochar) of hydrothermal pretreatment usually showed a higher degree of aromatization with a larger number of oxygen-containing groups.25 Lulu Qiang et al.26 prepared hierarchical porous carbon derived from cypress coats through hydrothermal pretreatment followed by KOH activation, the optimal sample of SHPC-2 with appropriate pore size and hydrophilous surface properties exhibited a high specific capacitance of 330 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. And many works also found that the hydrothermal pretreatment combined KOH activation contributed the porosity and graphene formation in carbon materials.27 According to the study of Zhongxin Sun et al.,28 3D vertically aligned graphene nanosheet arrays derived from waste spruce bark can be synthesized successfully through a hydrothermal pretreatment approach and subsequent KOH activation; the obtained graphene nanosheet exhibited a high capacitance of 398 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 and an outstanding capacitance retention of 96.3% after 10000 cycles in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The pyrolysis pretreatment is carried out in an oxygen-limited atmosphere at high temperatures ranging from 400 to 600 °C and the biochar derived through pyrolysis is porous with certain specific surface area. Xiaoguang Liu et al.29 reported a 3D porous carbon with a high particle density of 1.06 g cm−3, which was synthesized by using jujube as a precursor through high-temperature carbonization and subsequent KOH activation, exhibited a volumetric capacitance as high as 476 F cm−3 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
In our previous work,30 the waste eucalyptus bark was converted into porous carbon materials by hydrothermal treatment combined with KOH activation for toluene adsorption and aqueous supercapacitors. The appropriate pretreatment method is the premise for converting low-cost waste biomass into high value-added porous carbon materials. However, because of the differences in the natural structure of biomass raw materials and preparation conditions, it is difficult to judge the advantages and disadvantages of different pretreatment methods according to the previous research works. Therefore, it is necessary to try other pretreatment methods to prepare talent BPCs with higher performance, so as to improve the added value of products. The physicochemical structure of BPCs is the key factor affecting their supercapacitance performance. It was found that the electrochemical performance was related to the morphology, phase structure, porous properties and surface chemical properties of materials.31–33 The different pretreatment methods may affect the subsequent activation process, resulting in momentous differences in physicochemical structure and supercapacitance performance of BPCs. Thus, in this work, waste eucalyptus bark was used as a low-cost biomass resource to produce a series of BPCs by different pretreatment methods (without treatment/hydrothermal/pyrolysis) combined with KOH activation at different activation temperatures. The effects of different pretreatment methods on physicochemical structure and supercapacitance performance of BPCs were investigated systematically. The received findings will provide the scientific basis for the rational design of converting biomass into biomass-derived carbon materials towards next-generation energy storage.
2. Experiment section
2.1. Preparation of materials
Eucalyptus bark was taken from a rural area of Guangxi, China. The preparation process of porous carbon derived from waste eucalyptus bark was illustrated Fig. 1. Firstly, eucalyptus bark was washed by deionized water and dried at 105 °C in an oven for 12 h then crushed into powder by a grinder to get raw materials.
 Fig. 1  A schematic of the process of different pretreatment methods and material preparation. 
In a pyrolysis treatment process, raw materials were heated to 500 °C (heating rate: 5 °C min−1) in a tube furnace with a nitrogen flow rate of 100 ml min−1, maintained for 2 h and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. Finally, the obtained biochar was treated with 5% HCl solution, washed to pH = 7 with deionized water, and dried at 105 °C in an oven for 12 h.
In a hydrothermal treatment process, 9.0 g raw materials and 60 ml deionized water were mixed together in a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated in an oven at 200 °C for 7 h and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The resultant brown mixture was filtered and washed with deionized water, after being dried at 105 °C in an oven for 12 h, and the pure hydrochar powder was obtained.
Next, 1.0 g precursor (raw materials/hydrochar/biochar) was mixed with 2 g KOH in deionized water for 8 h. The KOH-modified precursor was dried at 105 °C in an oven for 12 h, and then ground into powder in a mortar. The dried KOH-modified precursor was heated to T (600, 700, and 800) °C (heating rate: 5 °C min−1) in a tube furnace with a nitrogen flow rate of 100 ml min−1, maintained for 120 min and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. Finally, the sample was treated with dilute 5% HCl solution, washed to pH = 7 with deionized water, and dried at 105 °C in an oven for 12 h. The biomass porous carbon activated from raw materials, hydrochar and biochar was denoted as RBPC-T, HBPC-T and PBPC-T, respectively.
2.2. Characterization
TG-DTG curves of the samples were recorded on a Differential Thermal/Thermo-gravimetric Analyzer (DTA-60(H), Japan). Scanning electron microscopy (GeminiSEM 300, Germany) was used to observe the morphology of the samples. The crystal structure of BPCs was carried out on a powdered X-ray diffraction (XRD, DX-2700A, China) with Cu/Kα radiation operated at 40 mA and 40 kV. Raman spectra of the BPCs were taken on a laser Raman spectrometer (InVia Reflex, Renishaw, UK) with a 532 nm laser as the excitation source. The surface chemical state was detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, INA-X, Germany). Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured on a surface area analyzer (TriStar II 3020 3.02, USA). Ultrahigh-purity N2 was used for testing, and the samples were degassed in a vacuum at 200 °C for at least 12 h before measurement. The specific surface area (SBET) was calculated according to the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method from the adsorption data in the relative pressure range between 0.01 and 0.1. The total micropore volume (Vt) was deduced from the N2 adsorption data using the t-plot method, and the total pore volume (V0) was estimated from the adsorbed amount of liquid nitrogen at a relative pressure of 0.99. The pore size distribution was calculated by the density functional theory (DFT) method.
2.3. Supercapacitor performance tests
All electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua chi660e, China) at the room temperature of 25 °C. The detailed information of electrochemical measurements is shown in the Supplementary Data of “Electrochemical measurement methods”.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Material characterization
The TG-DTG curves of the samples were recorded to analyze the pyrolysis behavior of eucalyptus bark raw materials, hydrochar and biochar between 25 and 800 °C. According to the basic composition analysis results, the waste eucalyptus bark, as plant-based biomass materials, was mainly composed of 32.72% hemicellulose, 46.81% cellulose and 19.69% lignin. As shown in Fig. 2a, the weight loss curve of the eucalyptus bark raw materials can be clearly divided into four stages: 25–100 °C, 100–230 °C, 230–380 °C and 380–800 °C. A weight loss of 5.33% in the range of 25–100 °C agreed to the evaporation of free water. A weight loss of 2.89% in the range of 120–230 °C corresponded to the evaporation of bound water and decomposition of some unstable organic compounds. The weight loss of hemicellulose mainly happened at 220–315 °C and cellulose at 315–400 °C, lignin which was more difficult to decompose had a wide pyrolysis temperature range of 160–800 °C.34 The second stage with a conspicuous weight loss of 51.83% happened in the range of 230–380 °C, and one sharp DTG peak at 340 °C with a slight left “shoulder” at 295 °C was detected, which can be ascribed to the decomposition processes of hemicellulose, partial cellulose and a small quantity of lignin.35,36 The third stage with a weight loss of 16.34% in the range of 380–800 °C was due to decomposition of lignin and further carbonation of the sample.37 The weight loss curve of hydrochar (Fig. 2b) can be also divided into four stages: 30–120 °C, 120–380 °C, 380–500 °C and 500–800 °C. The first stage corresponded to evaporation of free water. Due to the hydrolysis and decomposition of hemicellulose and unstable cellulose during hydrothermal treatment, the second stage had a less weight loss of 4.86% in the range of 120–380 °C. The third stage with a weight loss of 46.31% was ascribed to decomposition of cellulose and some lignin, which happened in the range of 380–500 °C with a symmetric DTG peak. The temperature of maximum weight loss rate located at 460 °C was higher than eucalyptus bark raw materials; it was deduced that the retained large cellulose crystallite with high thermal stability after hydrothermal treatment needed higher pyrolysis temperatures. The carbonation happened in the fourth stage in the range of 500–800, which shown a weight loss of 16.59% and a higher residues retention of 28.32%. Moreover, the weight loss curve of biochar (Fig. 2c) can be divided into three stages. The first stage with a weight loss of 9.72% in the range of 30–150 °C corresponded to the evaporation of bound water and decomposition of some unstable organic compounds. Compared with raw materials and hydrochar, the biochar had a lower weight loss of 4.51% in the range of 150–500 °C, indicating that a large amount of hemicellulose and cellulose had been removed during pyrolysis treatment at a high temperature of 500 °C. The third stage with a weight loss of 8.30% was attributed to the decomposition of biochar during further carbonation.

The XRD patterns of raw materials, hydrochar, biochar and BPCs are presented in Fig. 2d–f. The raw materials and hydrochar showed two apparent diffraction peaks at 2θ = 15° and 22°, which was attributed to the cellulosic polymorphs.38 The peaks at 15° and 22° can be ascribed to the diffraction peak of the cellulose (101) crystal plane and the cellulose (002) crystal plane, respectively. Interestingly, the XRD patterns of hydrochar showed an obvious enhancement in peaks of 15° and 22°, which can be ascribed to changed chemical composition. As a kind of biomass resource, the waste eucalyptus bark contained three main components: hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. Among them, only cellulose was crystalline, whereas hemicellulose and lignin were both amorphous.39 During hydrothermal treatment, the amorphous components including most of hemicellulose, part of lignin, and amorphous regions of cellulose may be extracted to form the water-soluble chemicals during hydrothermal treatment, while most of crystalline fractions of cellulose remained intact in hydrochar. Therefore, it enhanced the crystallinity degree of hydrochar, resulting an increase in the diffractive signal intensity of (101) and (002) peaks. The sharp peaks disappeared in biochar, it was indicated that the crystal structure was destroyed and disordered carbon was formed during pyrolysis treatment. All of the BPCs showed an obviously intensity in the low-angle, and its intensity enhanced with the increasing activation temperature, which was consistent with the presence of a high density of pores produced by KOH activation.40,41 In addition, all of the BPCs possessed two broad diffraction peaks at approximately 23° and 43°, corresponding to the (002) and (100) planes of the graphite carbon layer, respectively.40
The phase structure of BPCs was characterized using Raman spectra. As presented in Fig. 2g–i, all of the BPCs exhibited two peaks located at 1338 cm−1 (D band) and 1586 cm−1 (G band), which can be assigned to defective or disordered structure of carbon and the stretching bond of sp2 hybridized carbon, respectively.16 The degree of disordered carbon and ordered graphitized carbon in BPCs can be evaluated by the intensity ratio (ID/IG) of the D and G band.40,42 In general, the value of ID/IG of disordered porous carbon increased as the activation temperature grew. The order of ID/IG followed as PBPC < HBPC < RBPC at same activation temperature, and it was indicated that pyrolysis pretreatment was more helpful to the formation of sp2 hybridized carbon.
The SEM images were carried out to observe the effects of different pretreatment on the structure and morphology of BPCs. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the waste eucalyptus bark displayed the original massive structure of a plant with a rough and non-porous surface. As displayed in Fig. 3a–c, it can be seen that RBPCs exhibited a tiny detrital shape with smooth surface. In particular, the 3D honeycomb-like architectures and a number of inter-connected macropores can be clearly observed on the top surface and within the interior of HBPCs (Fig. 3d–f), it was deduced that the most of hemicellulose and cellulose in the hydrothermal treatment process were degraded, the hydrochar with less retained cellulose reacted with KOH to display an appropriate “bread leavening”, and the 3D honeycomb-like architecture was presented.43 The sample of PBPCs showed a block with a relatively rough surface (Fig. 3g–i). RBPCs, HBPCs and PBPCs presented a different structure and morphology, which indicated that different pretreatment methods would significantly affect the morphology of the biomass porous carbon activated by KOH.

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for RBPC-600, HBPC-600 and PBPC-600 are displayed in Fig. 4a. According to the IUPAC classification, the isotherms of RBPC-600 and PBPC-600 belonged to the type I. The sharp increase of N2 adsorption at P/P0 < 0.05 meant that micropore-dominant structures existed in RBPC-600 and PBPC-600. The isotherms of HBPC-600 exhibited the characteristics of type I and IV mixed isotherms. A rapid rise at the low relative pressures (P/P0 < 0.05), the clear hysteresis loops at medium relative pressure (P/P0 = 0.5–0.95) and a long tails observed at high relative pressure (P/P0 = 0.95–0.99) in isotherms suggested the presence of micropores, mesopores and macropores, respectively.44 The curves of pore size distribution are presented in Fig. 4b. It can be seen that PBPCs had a high density of micropores compared with RBPC-600 and HBPC-600, and HBPC-600 exhibited a large number of mesopores with a pore size concentrated at 4 nm. The detailed parameters of surface area and pore volume are summarized in Fig. 4c and d. The BET specific surface areas of RBPC-600, HBPC-600 and PBPC-600 were 842.66, 939.50 and 1479.61 m2 g−1, and the total pore volumes were 0.46, 0.60 and 0.59 cm3 g−1, respectively. Among them, PBPC-600 with the highest BET surface has an ultrahigh surface area (1376.17 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.52 cm3 g−1) of micropore, and HBPC-600 with the highest total pore volume had a higher surface area (105.26 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.17 cm3 g−1) of mes/macropore. It was indicated that the hydrothermal treatment was beneficial to the more meso/macropore formation, whereas the pyrolysis treatment can help to produce more micropores in the process of KOH activation.

An XPS survey was conducted on BPCs to get detailed information of the surface chemical properties. As shown in Fig. 4e, three BPCs exhibited a strong C1s signal at 285.0 eV and a weak O1s signal at 533.0 eV. The sample of RBPC-600, HBPC-600 and PBPC-600 had an oxygen content of 11.53%, 11.56% and 15.99%, respectively. The high-resolution O1s spectra of BPCs (Fig. 4f–h) can be divided into three individual component peaks: CO (531.80 eV), C–O (533.23 eV) and COOR (534.42 eV),45 and the details of content of each of RBPC-600, HBPC-600 and PBPC-600 are presented in Fig. 4i. The sample of RBPC-600 contained 6.02% CO, 3.87% C–O and 1.64% COOR. Compared to RBPC-600, HBPC-600 with a hydrothermal pretreatment had a lower content of C–O (3.41%) and a higher content of CO (6.35%) and COOR (1.80%), PBPC-600 with a pyrolysis pretreatment had a lower content of CO (5.56%) and a higher content of C–O (7.25%) and COOR (5.56%), indicating that the pyrolysis can improve oxygen content of biomass porous carbon more effectively.
On the basis of the above characterization, the possible mechanism of the difference on the physicochemical structure of porous biomass carbons derived from waste eucalyptus bark with different pretreatment methods can be concluded. It was reported that the oxygen-containing groups in cellulose and hemicellulose would react with partial KOH to form corresponding potassium salts in the impregnation process, then produced a molten mixture of potassium salts and biomass at high activation temperature.43,46 In the activation process, KOH etched the biomass carbon to generate micropores. Under the action of CO, CO2, H2O and other gases produced by the pyrolysis of raw materials and potassium salts, the molten mixture as a soft template would expand like “bread leavening”, and the inter-connected macropores formed as the gases overflowed.47 According to the result of TG, DTG curves and XRD patterns, the difference of structure and morphology between RBPCs, HBPCs and PBPCs can be attributed to the differences in the composition of raw materials, hydrochar and biochar. The raw materials were composed of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin, the plenty of formed potassium salts were pyrolyzed, and the oxygen-containing gases were generated, resulting in a lowest oxygen content of 11.53% in RBPC-600. Moreover, the excess gases produced by pyrolysis of plenty of hemicellulose and cellulose enhanced the effect of “bread leavening”, and the macropores of RBPCs enlarged continuously and merged eventually, which led to the collapse of the carbon structure and the formation of RBPCs with a tiny detrital shape. Furthermore, because most of the hemicellulose and cellulose were degraded during hydrothermal treatment, less potassium salts and gases in hydrochar were produced, then the deoxidization and “bread leavening” was weakened, and more oxygen-containing groups and the formed macropores were retained. It was indicated that the HBPC-600 had an oxygen content of 11.56% and showed a 3D honeycomb-like architecture with a hierarchical pore structure. Different from raw materials and hydrochar, the biochar can be defined as disordered biomass carbon, the process of carbonization made the biochar retain the original shape similar to waste eucalyptus bark. In the subsequent activation process, KOH was mainly functioned to etch biochar to produce micropores, which resulted in PBPC-600 presenting the shape of a block with high contents of oxygen-containing groups and density of micopores.
3.2. Supercapacitance performance in a three-electrode system
To study effects of different pretreatment conditions on the capacitive performance of as-obtained BPCs, a series of supercapacitance performances of the materials as electrodes was characterized by GCD, CV and EIS in a three-electrode system.
The CV curves at different scan rates of BPCs, tested in a three-electrode system using 6 M KOH as the electrolyte, are displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and the CV curves of RBPCs, HBPCs and PBPCs at 10 mV s−1 are portrayed in Fig. 5a–c, respectively. The CV curves of all the samples exhibited a rectangular-like shape, demonstrated the dominant electronic double layer capacitor (EDLC) originated from the electrostatic charge accumulation at the electrode/electrolyte interface.48 Notably, a pair of apparent broad peaks superposed on the rectangular-like CV curve demonstrated the presence of a certain amount pseudo-capacitance, which can be ascribed to the reversible redox reactions originated from oxygen-containing functional groups on the biomass porous carbon surface.49 It has been reported that the reversible reactions of the oxygen-containing functional groups in alkaline electrolyte can be described by eqn (1)–(3):31,50,51 Hydroxyl: >C–OH + OH− ↔ >CO− + H2O(1) Carbonyl: >CO + OH− ↔ –COOH + e−(2) Carboxyl: –COOH + OH− ↔ –COO− + H2O(3)
 Fig. 5  Supercapacitance performance in a three-electrode system using 6M KOH as the electrolyte: CV curves at 10 mV s−1 of (a) RBPCs, (b) HBPCs and (c) PBPCs electrode; GCD curves at 1 A g−1 (d) RBPCs, (e) HBPCs and (f) PBPC electrode; the specific capacitance of (g) RBPC (h) HBPC and (i) PBPC electrodes at different current densities. 
The GCD curves of RBPCs, HBPCs and PBPCs at 1 A g−1 are depicted in Fig. 5d–f, respectively. It can be observed that the GCD curves of all electrodes showed a nearly symmetrical triangle, which was indicative of excellent reversible charge–discharge behavior and EDLC properties. The slight bend of linearity in GCD curves was attributed to the redox reactions of the oxygen-containing groups on the surface.52 The GCD curves of BPCs at different current densities are measured and displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†), where charge–discharge time decreased as the current density increased. The detailed specific capacitance of RBPCs, HBPCs and PBPCs at different current densities calculated from discharge curves are presented in Fig. 5g–i, successively. It can be seen that the specific capacitance of RBPCs increased with the increase of activation temperature, which was caused by the increase of micropores with the activation temperature increase. Moreover, the RBPC-800 electrode offered a larger specific capacitance of 266.1 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and 216.3 F g −1 at 20 A g −1 than that of the RBPC-700 electrode (250.7 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and 197.7 F g −1 at 20 A g −1) and the RBPC-600 electrode (197.7 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and 163.2 F g −1 at 20 A g −1). In contrast, the specific capacitance of HBPCs and PBPCs decreased with the increase of activation temperature, which can be attributed to the decrease of the contents of oxygen-containing groups and suitable narrow micropores, and the HBPC-600 electrode delivered a larger specific capacitance of 262.1 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and 198.0 F g −1 at 20 A g −1 than that of the HBPC-700 electrode (214.5 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and 163.3 F g −1 at 20 A g −1) and the HBPC-800 electrode (189.6 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and 151.8 F g −1 at 20 A g −1). What's more, the PBPCs with plenty of micropores and high oxygen content exhibited higher specific capacitance. At a current density of 0.5 A g −1, the specific capacitance of PBPC-600, PBPC-700 and PBPC-800 was 349.4 F g −1, 337.8 F g −1 and 305.6 F g −1, which retained 257.0 F g −1, 253.8 F g −1 and 238.0 F g −1 at a current density of 20 A g −1, respectively. As listed in Table S1 (ESI†), compared with some reported porous carbon derived from waste biomass such as fallen leaves,53 ginkgo leaves,54 bamboo,55,56 tea leaves,57 rice straw,58 withered rose59 and lotus seedpod,60 the PBPC-600 electrode possessed a marvelous specific capacitance, indicating that it had a great application potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The rate capability of each electrode is summarized in Fig. 5d, and it can be seen that the capacitance retention of BPCs decreased with the increasing capacitance value, which could be because the micropores were the main contributors to capacitance. At the same activation temperature, each PBPC electrode showed the lowest capacitance retention, which was attributed to the high microporosity of PBPCs. Although a great number of micropores can effectively improve the capacitance value, it had a negative effect on the rate capability.32 When charging and discharging at a large current density, the electrolyte ions cannot reach the adsorption sites quickly owing to the diffusion limitation of micropores. Therefore, the electrode of PBPC-600 electrode exhibited a highest specific capacitance with relatively low capacitance retention of 73.6%. In addition, benefitted from lower microporosity and unique hierarchical porous structure of HPBCs which shortened the ion transport path and accelerated the ion transfer speed, the HBPC electrode showed higher capacitance retention than that of PBPC electrode at the same activation temperature. Furthermore, because of the small size of detrital shape and fewer micropores, the rate capability of RBPCs electrode was better than that of PBPC and HBPC electrodes at the same activation temperature.
Nyquist plot was an excellent tool to explore the rate kinetics and charge transport properties of electrode materials. The Nyquist plots of RBPCs, HBPCs and PBPCs are presented in Fig. 6a–c, respectively. All the electrodes displayed a nearly vertical line in the low frequency region, indicating the ideal capacitive performance.61 A slash in the middle frequency region was related to the diffusion of the ions in the pore structure of biomass porous carbon,62 and represented the ion diffusion resistance which was usually called Warburg resistance (Rw).28,45 The PBPC-600 exhibited a longest slash, indicating a high value of Rw, which was attributed to reason that the high density of micropores limited the diffusion of electrolyte ions. A semicircle at the high frequency region reflected the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and the diameter of semicircle represented the value of Rct. Compared to other samples, the PBPC-600 electrode showed the largest semicircle, implying a high charge transfer resistance, which was due to the presence of plenty of redox reactions originating from rich oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of PBPC-600.63 The value of intercept with the real axis in the high frequency region represented the equivalent series resistance (ESR or Rs) of the electrochemical system, which included the electrolyte resistance, the intrinsic resistance of the electrode material, and the contact resistance between the current collector and the electrode interface.64 The ESR which reflected the conductivity of electrode materials was closely related to the degree of graphitization, the higher degree of graphitization of biomass porous carbon would lead to a lower ESR.33 Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6d, the ESR value of BPCs decreased with the increase of activation temperature, indicating the enhancement of the conductivity of electrode materials. At same activation temperature, the order of the ESR value of electrodes was as follows: RBPC > HPBC > PHPC. Compared with hydrothermal carbonization, pyrolysis pretreatment can improve the conductivity of BPCs more effectively.

Two types of charge storage mechanisms in discharge/charge process of electrode materials were widely discussed and classified as the surface-controlled behavior and the diffusion-controlled behavior.65,66 The surface controlled behavior with fast reaction kinetics included the electrostatic charge accumulation at the electrode/electrolyte interface and the redox reaction from surface functional groups.65 The diffusion-controlled behavior with slow reaction kinetics primarily referred to the insertion of electrolyte ions in narrow micropores.48 Therefore, it is necessary to explore the effects of different physicochemical structure on the discharge/charge process owing to the differences in the porous properties and oxygen-containing functional groups of different samples.
The relationship between the current density (i) and scan rate (ν) can be described as eqn (4):67 i = avb(4)where i (A g−1) is the current density, a is an adjustable parameter, v (mV s−1) is the scan rate, b is a coefficient fluctuating at a range of 0.5–1.0. The contribution of surface-controlled behavior and diffusion-controlled behavior to the charge/discharge kinetics can be evaluated by the following eqn (5):68 log(i) = log(a) + blog(v)(5)
According to CV curves, the value of b can be calculated from the slope of the best linear fitting line between log(i) and log(v), which was considered as a significant index to analyze the charge-storage kinetics of the electrodes. When the value of b approached 1.0, the surface-controlled behavior was suggested. When the value of b was equal to 0.5, it represented the diffusion-controlled behavior. As shown in Fig. 7a–c, it can be seen that b values of all the BPCs were between 0.5 and 1.0, and close to 1.0, which indicated that discharge/charge process was mainly controlled by the surface-controlled behavior.

The capacitance contributions via the surface-controlled behavior and the diffusion-controlled behavior can be quantified by Dunn's method.69 The current density (i, A g−1) at a fixed potential extracted from the CV curves is a function of the scan rate (v, mV s−1), and can be expressed in the following eqn (6):67,68 i = k1v + k2v1/2(6)where k1 and k2 are constants. The first term k1v equals the current density, which was contributed via surface controlled behavior with fast reaction kinetics. The second term k2v1/2 is the current density associated with diffusion-controlled behavior with slow reaction kinetics.70 The above equation can be rearranged as i/v1/2 = k1v1/2 + k2(7)
The current contributions of the surface controlled and diffusion controlled behavior were obtained by solving for the value of k1 and k2 at fixed potentials across multiple scan rates.71 And the proportion of capacitance contribution from each behavior at different scan rates generated by each contribution can be quantified by calculating the area of the CV curve. As presented in Fig. 7d, it can be noticed that the surface-controlled contribution of RBPCs showed no obvious change with the activation temperature increase. On the whole, the surface-controlled contribution of HBPCs and PBPCs improved significantly with the increase of activation temperature. Besides, at same activation temperature, the order of the surface-controlled contribution of BPCs followed as PBPC < HBPC < RBPC, which corresponded to the order of the rate capability. It suggested that although plenty of micropores enhanced the capacitance of EDLC, it caused more electrolyte ions insert into narrow micropores, which would lead to a lower surface-controlled contribution.
3.3. Supercapacitance performance in a two-electrode system
To further confirm the actual performance of PBPC-600 and explore the effects of different pretreatment methods on electrochemical performance of BPC-based supercapacitors, the samples of RBPC-600, HBPC-600 and PBPC-600 with a same activation temperature of 600 °C were selected to assemble symmetric supercapacitors in 6M KOH. The CV curves at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under different voltages of the RBPC-600, HBPC-600 and PBPC-600 supercapacitors were tested to select the stable operating voltage (Fig. S4a–c, ESI†). It was clear that the CV curves of each supercapacitor can keep a rectangular-like shape without obvious increase of anodic current within 1.0 V. An increase in the anodic current potential can be observed when the voltage exceeded 1.0 V, which indicated that the water was irreversibly decomposed under an over-potential.51 Therefore, a stable operating voltage of 1.0 V was determined for further electrochemical tests. CV curves at different scan rates of RBPC-600, HBPC-600 and PBPC-600 are displayed in Fig. S4d–f (ESI†). The CV curves of RBPC-600 at different scan rates almost retained rectangular shapes, which was indicative of excellent rate capability and dominant EDLC properties. The CV curve of HBPC-600 deviated slightly from the rectangular shape at high scan rate, suggesting a relatively poor rate performance. By contrast, the CV curves of RBPC-600 showed a rectangular-like shape with a redox peak between 0.1 V and 0.8 V, which was consistent with the result in the three-electrode system, and an obvious deformation at high scan rate indicated a poorer rate performance. As shown in Fig. S4g–i (ESI†), the GCD curves at different current density of each supercapacitor showed a symmetrical triangle shape, suggesting the excellent coulombic efficiency of all samples.

Fig. 8a and b show the CV curve at 5 mV s−1 and GCD curve at 0.2 A g−1 of RBPC-600, HBPC-600 and PBPC-600 supercapacitors, the area of rectangular-like CV curves and the time of GCD curves both followed the order of RBPC-600 < HBPC-600 < PBPC-600, suggesting PBPC-600 supercapacitor had a better capacitive performance, which was consistent with the result in a three-electrode system. The specific capacitance of three supercapacitors at different current densities is presented in Fig. 8c. The RBPC-600 supercapacitor exhibited a specific capacitance of 170.8 F g−1 at 0.2 A g −1 and at 143.8 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 84.2%. The HBPC-600 supercapacitor delivered a specific capacitance of 179.0 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and 146.6 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 75.5%. The capacitive capability of the PBPC-600 supercapacitor was significantly higher than that of the HBPC-600 supercapacitor, which showed a specific capacitance of 239.6 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and 189.3 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 79.0%. The value of specific capacitance followed the order of RBPC-600 < HBPC-600 < PBPC-600 and the rate behavior followed the order of RBPC-600 > HBPC-600 > PBPC-600, which was consistent with the order of those in a three electrode system. The energy density and power density were important indexes to measure the overall performance of electrochemical devices. As shown in Fig. 8d, the RBPC-600 supercapacitor showed an energy density of 5.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 99.8 W kg−1, and the HBPC-600 supercapacitor achieved a higher energy density of 6.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 99.8 W kg−1. Benefited from the excellent specific capacitance, when the power density increased from 99.7 to 8028.7 W kg−1, the energy density of the PBPC-600 supercapacitor decreased from 8.2 to 4.2 W h kg−1. As presented in Fig. 8e, the Nyquist plots of each supercapacitor showed a vertical linear in the low frequency region, suggesting a desirable capacitive behavior. Moreover, the PBPC-600 supercapacitor exhibited a longest slash in the middle frequency region, meaning a larger ion diffusion resistance caused by the majority of micropores. And a larger semicircle in the high frequency region can be seen in Nyquist plots of PBPC-600, indicating a greater charge transfer resistance resulted from a number of oxygen-containing functional groups. The ESR of the RBPC-600, HBPC-600 and PBPC-600 supercapacitor was 0.484 Ω, 0.482 Ω and 0.437 Ω, respectively, which was also consistent with the result of the three-electrode system. The cycling stability of each supercapacitor at a current density of 5 A g−1 is presented in Fig. 8f. The capacitance retention of the RBPC-600, HBPC-600 and PBPC-600 supercapacitors after 10000 cycles was 93.3%, 100.4% and 93.4%, respectively. Owing to the unique hierarchical porous structure, the HBPC-600 supercapacitor displayed an excellent cycling stability with high capacitance retention.

3.4. Symmetric supercapacitors based on PBPC-600
On the basis of the equation (E = 0.5C × ΔV2), the energy density of the supercapacitor devices is theoretically determined by the capacitance (C) and the operating voltage (V). As a cheap and environmentally friendly solution, due to the higher over-potential led by lower OH− concentration, Na2SO4 electrolyte can provide a larger operating voltage than acid and alkaline electrolytes.44,72 Thus, the PBPC-600 electrode with a superior capacitance and high-voltage Na2SO4 electrolyte was selected to assemble high energy density symmetric supercapacitors. Fig. 8a showed CV curves of the symmetric supercapacitor assembled in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte tested at various voltages from 1.2 V to 1.8 V at 10 mV s−1. All the curves are quasi-rectangular even at 1.6 V, while a fast increase of andic current can be observed at 1.8 V, which indicated that the stable operating voltage for this device is 1.6 V. From Fig. 9b, the shape of CV curve had not changed distinctly even at 200 mV s−1. Furthermore, the GCD curves at different current density showed symmetrical triangle shape in Fig. 9c, further indicating its good reversible and capacitive behavior. To meet the portable requirement, a seldom used CMC-Na/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte was employed to fabricate symmetric quasi-solid-state supercapacitor. As presented in Fig. 9d, the operating voltage of the symmetric quasi-solid-state supercapacitor can reach 1.6 V. Furthermore, all of CV curves maintained similar rectangular-like shape and the GCD curves exhibited symmetrical triangle shape, which implied that the CMC-Na/Na2SO4 gel was a favorable electrolyte (Fig. 9e and f). As shown in Fig. 9g, the Nyquist plots of the supercapacitors using 1M Na2SO4 and CMC-Na/Na2SO4 gel as electrolytes were both nearly parallel to the imaginary axis in the low frequency region, thus providing further evidence of the ideal capacitive performance of the PBPC-600 electrode. Obviously, the Nyquist plots of the supercapacitor assembled in CMC-Na/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte exhibited a smaller semicircle and a shorter slash than that in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, which indicated that the symmetric quasi-solid-state supercapacitor delivered a lower charge transfer resistance and Warburg resistance. The ESR of the supercapacitor assembled in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and CMC-Na/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte was 0.742 Ω and 1.200 Ω, respectively. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor assembled in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte was 170.5 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and 127.2 F g−1 at 20 A g−1, the supercapacitor assembled in CMC-Na/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte delivered a specific capacitance 168.2 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and maintained 127.2 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 (Fig. 9h). Because of the operating voltage as high as 1.6 V, the supercapacitor assembled in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte achieved an energy density of 15.0 W h kg−1 at a power density of 159.4 W kg−1 and maintained 5.7 W h kg−1 at 11317.7 W kg−1 (Fig. 9i). Moreover, the supercapacitor assembled in CMC-Na/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte achieved a remarkable energy density up to 15.0 W h kg−1 at a power density of 160.0 W kg−1 and retained a considerable energy density to be 6.5 W h kg−1 at 160.0 W kg−1. The symmetric supercapacitors with 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and CMC-Na/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte exhibited a wide operating voltage window and excellent energy density, which showed better performance than some recently published carbon-based aqueous symmetric supercapacitors (Table S2, ESI†) such as activated carbon synthesized from oil palm kernel shell73 (7.4 W h kg−1 at 300.0 W kg−1), porous carbon derived from sorghum stalk74 (9.8 W h kg−1 at 225.4 W kg−1), peanut shell-derived 3D porous carbon75 (9.0 W h kg−1 at 380.0 W kg−1), high graphitic biomass porous carbon76 (14.2 W h kg−1 at 218.8 W kg−1), monolithic carbon sponge77 (5.6 W h kg−1 at 250.0 W kg−1), nitrogen-containing graphitic hierarchical porous carbon nanosheets78 (11.7 W h kg−1 at 80.0 W kg−1), honeycomb-like biomass carbon materials79 (11.1 W h kg−1 at 20.0 W kg−1), tobacco-stem-derived porous carbon80 (7.8 W h kg−1 at 546.6 W kg−1) and heteroatom (O, N)-doped porous carbon derived from bamboo shoot shells81 (13.2 W h kg−1 at 546.6 W kg−1).

4. Conclusions
In summary, eucalyptus bark, as a biomass waste resource, were explored to prepare various porous carbons through multiple strategies, including direct activation, hydrothermal pretreatment followed by activation and pyrolysis pretreatment followed by activation. The pretreatment process had a great influence on the obtained porous carbon activated by KOH, which led to a significant difference in the physicochemical structure and supercapacitor performance. The hydrothermal pretreatment was conducive to form 3D honeycomb-like architectures with a hierarchical pore structure in the KOH activation process, which resulted in an excellent cycling stability. The pyrolysis pretreatment was beneficial to improve the graphitization degree of porous carbons and produce more micropores and oxygen-containing functional groups, which resulted in a lower ESR value and higher specific capacitance with poor rate behavior and cycling stability. Among them, the sample of PBPC-600 prepared by pyrolysis pretreatment followed activation was in the shape of a block with a 1376.17 m2 g−1 micropore surface area, 103.44 m2 g−1 meso/macropore surface area, 15.99% oxygen content and an ID/IG value of 0.923. The PBPC-600 electrode showed a specific capacitance of 349.4 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and an ESR value of 0.614 Ω. The PBPC-600 supercapacitor exhibited a specific capacitance of 239.6 F g −1 with an energy density of 8.2 W h kg−1 at 0.2 A g −1, an ESR value of 0.437 Ω, and a capacitance retention of 93.4% after 10000 cycles. Moreover, the PBPC-600 based symmetric quasi-solid-state supercapacitor assembled in CMC-Na/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte achieved a remarkable energy density as high as 15.0 W h kg−1 at a power density of 160.0 W kg−1.
