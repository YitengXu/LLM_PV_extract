    AbstractThe formation of three-dimensionally interconnected donor–acceptor nanocomposites from copper(II) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic tetrasodium salt (tsCuPc) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is reported. Thin films were formed using a multi-step template-directed growth method. The nanocomposites consist of crystalline, continuous and interpenetrating networks of tsCuPc and PCBM with an interfacial area to volume ratio 2–3 times greater than in a planar bilayer structure. This templating strategy allows the formation of engineered nanocomposites for optoelectronic applications whose structural properties can be easily tuned for increased efficiencies.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices show poor power conversion performance in comparison to their inorganic counterparts partly because of the short exciton diffusion length in organic semiconductors.1 The strongly bound excitons created by photon absorption in OPV devices must diffuse to an interface for efficient dissociation into free charge carriers which are then transported to the electrodes to generate a photocurrent. This dissociation typically occurs at an interface between an electron donor phase and an electron acceptor phase, but the short diffusion lengths of the excitons mean that recombination is a significant limitation in most OPV devices. The use of a bulk heterojunction allows improved exciton dissociation2–4 but relies on fortuitous interface formation and can lead to the creation of trapped donor and/or acceptor domains that have a detrimental effect on subsequent charge carrier transport. These issues could be overcome by engineering a three-dimensionally ordered microporous (3DOM) donor–acceptor nanocomposite with fully interconnected phases. This would provide a large donor–acceptor interfacial area to facilitate efficient exciton dissociation as well as a continuous pathway to the electrodes for the free charge carriers. However, the fabrication of such a composite structure remains extremely challenging. A certain degree of control over the donor–acceptor blend morphology can be achieved in bulk heterojunction devices by tailoring the deposition conditions or by post-deposition treatments such as annealing.4–7 Other strategies focus on the use of block copolymers to create nanostructured donor–acceptor blends with a controlled morphology.8 Alternative approaches consist of template-assisted growth of nanostructured porous structures that can be subsequently integrated in organic solar cells. For instance, Haberkorn et al. used anodic aluminium templates to form nanorod arrays of an organic semiconductor that could be employed as the electron donor of an ordered bulk heterojunction device.9 Clearly, this method, which is similar to the one presented here, would ultimately offer a much greater control on the architecture of the device active layer.
Template assisted growth using colloidal crystals is a low-cost and versatile fabrication method which also presents the advantage of being relatively straightforward to carry out. It has been extensively used to produce 3DOM thin films made of a wide variety of materials, such as ceramics,10,11 organic polymers,12 metals13 and inorganic semiconductors.14 The fabrication principle of 3DOM structures is very simple and consists of the infiltration of the interstitial holes of a 3D colloidal crystal with a fluid capable of solidification and the subsequent removal of the sacrificial templating spheres. This results in the formation of a solid scaffold surrounded by air spheres located in the positions previously occupied by the colloidal spheres. These porous structures can then be filled with another material in order to create a nanostructured composite that should show interesting structural and functional properties. However, the use of colloidal crystals for the fabrication of such a composite material has been so far reported only in very few studies on photonic materials,15 high-density optical memory storage materials,16 and ferromagnetic and ferroelectric thin films.17 In principle, such a strategy could be used for the creation of interconnected donor–acceptor nanocomposites with ideal structural properties for photovoltaic applications and is described in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Templating strategy for the growth of nanostructured donor–acceptor composite thin films. Colloidal crystal templates (a) are infiltrated with the donor phase. After removal of the template, 3DOM donor structures (b) are formed. These are subsequently filled with the acceptor phase to create donor–acceptor composites (c). 
In this paper we describe the template directed synthesis and characterization of nanocomposite thin films made using a water soluble copper phthalocyanine derivative—copper(II) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (tsCuPc)—and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and PCBM are organic semiconductors commonly used as electron donor and electron acceptor materials in OPV devices.18–20 A water soluble derivative of CuPc was chosen to infiltrate the colloidal crystal template using a solution process. The resulting nanocomposite thin films are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Finally, pseudo-tomography is used to generate the 3D reconstruction of the internal structure of the films and shows that they consist of two highly interconnected interpenetrating networks. To our best knowledge this is the first time that the fabrication of an engineered organic semiconductor nanocomposite following a templating approach is reported. The implications of exploiting such nanocomposites for OPV and other optoelectronic device applications are also discussed.
Experimental details
Monodispersed polystyrene microspheres with diameters in the 135–500 nm range were synthesized by emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization as described in ref. 21 and used to grow colloidal crystals by evaporative vertical deposition21 on glass, indium tin oxide (ITO) and CuPc coated ITO substrates. The latter was prepared by organic molecular beam deposition (OMBD).22 The colloidal crystal templates were infiltrated with a solution of tsCuPc (Alfa Aesar, purity grade 97.4%) in a 1:3 ethanol:water mixture using a concentration of 5 × 10−3 mol L−1. After solidification of the tsCuPc phase, the polystyrene spheres were selectively removed by dissolution in toluene, leading to the formation of tsCuPc inverse replica films. The tsCuPc inverse films were then infiltrated with a PCBM solution (NanoC, purity grade 99.5%) using a concentration of 10 mg per ml of chlorobenzene to form, after solvent evaporation, a tsCuPc/PCBM nanocomposite film.
Samples were characterized by SEM (LEO Gemini 1525 operated at 5 kV), Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw InVia spectrometer, 785 nm laser excitation, spot size ≈ 10 × 20 µm, power 0.1–1 mW) and XRD (Philips PW1700 powder diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation).
“Pseudo-tomography” experiments were carried out using a focused-ion-beam (FIB) microscope (Zeiss XB1540) equipped with an in situ SEM (Gemini column). A large trapezoid trench with exposed faces on each side was milled using the FIB Ga+ ion beam on a suitable region of the sample. Typically, the exposed face was ∼8 µm in width and 4–13 µm in height. A Pt protective layer was deposited on the film top surface and the Ga+ ion beam was then used to clean and polish the cross-sectional face before imaging. Secondary electron (SE) images of the cross-sectional face were recorded at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV before a slice (thickness 12–20 nm) was removed by the Ga+ milling at 30 kV and 100–200 pA. An SE image was recorded and the procedure of sputtering small sections of the top face and imaging it in this manner “slice and view” was repeated through an automated script until a volume of 4–13 × 8 × 1 µm had been analyzed.
The series of images obtained were corrected for foreshortening effects and image processed to reduce noise and separate features of interest from the bulk volume using in-house and open source codes (ImageJ, Volume Viewer, ITK). The images were then concatenated using a commercially available least squares fitting code (Amira™). The nature of each dataset meant the final step often required tailoring image processing techniques for the best result. The final volume was reconstructed with a voxel resolution of 12.3 nm and 15.3 nm for the samples grown with template sphere diameters of 461 nm and 224 nm respectively.
Results and discussion
SEM images of the 3D colloidal crystal templates grown on ITO substrates using 224 nm polystyrene spheres are shown in Fig. 2a–c. These images are typical of the templates obtained using all sphere sizes on various types of substrate.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of (a–c) a colloidal crystal template and (d–f) of tsCuPc inverse films (sphere diameter 224 nm). 
The templates consist of highly ordered elongated domains separated by cracks that form as a result of drying induced strains.13,14 SEM images of the tsCuPc inverse thin film, formed after infiltration and removal of the polystyrene spheres, are shown in Fig. 2d–f. A high degree of fidelity is observed between the original template and the inverse film. The 3D ordering in the tsCuPc inverse films is clearly apparent at higher magnification (Fig. 2f). The walls of tsCuPc surround periodically ordered “air spheres” that are inter-connected through windows formed at the contact points between the PS spheres in the original template. The diameter of the “air spheres” is reduced compared with the PS spheres due to shrinkage of the structure during crystallization of the tsCuPc. Here the volume shrinkage is estimated to be ∼14 to 18%.
Raman spectra of the tsCuPc inverse films formed using 224 nm spheres are shown in Fig. 3. The Bg(2) mode vibrations observed at 1431 and 1453 cm−1 correlate well with the values reported by Tackley et al. and Bovill et al. for α-CuPc.23,24 XRD patterns of the tsCuPc inverse films are also very similar to the α-CuPc polymorph (Fig. 4), in agreement with previous results.22 Raman spectra and XRD patterns from the nanocomposite tsCuPc/PCBM films are shown in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively, again formed using 224 nm spheres. There is very little published data on Raman spectra of PCBM;25 however, recently, Dzwilewski et al. reported that the Ag(2) mode of fullerene materials can be detected at 1465 cm−1.26 The Raman spectrum of the drop cast PCBM film (Fig. 3) exhibits a peak at 1465 cm−1 which is consistent with this observation. The spectrum of the nanocomposite film shows contributions from both the tsCuPc and the PCBM phases, confirming it is composed of both materials.

The XRD pattern recorded from a drop cast film of PCBM is shown in Fig. 4. Erb et al. investigated composites of PCBM and polythiophene (P3HT) and reported that PCBM crystallites were not detectable in the composites. However, their XRD pattern from pure PCBM powder is consistent with our result.27 The XRD pattern of the tsCuPc/PCBM nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 4. It is clear that the nanocomposite film is highly crystalline and exhibits an XRD pattern that is dominated by the PCBM phase. This is consistent as the PCBM is the phase with the highest volume fraction in the nanocomposite—if the template is close packed then the tsCuPc:PCBM ratio should be 26:74. The inset in Fig. 4 shows an expansion of the XRD patterns for the region 2θ = 5–12° which allows the contributions of each phase to be readily distinguished. The peaks at 6.83° and 7.27° correspond respectively to the (100) and (001) reflections of tsCuPc, whereas the series of peaks between 9 and 12° is due to the PCBM phase.
Since the PCBM phase should fill the “air spheres” in the tsCuPc structure, in the SEM it can be anticipated that the contrast between the phases of the nanocomposite in either secondary or backscattered electron imaging will be rather poor. The low magnification images in Fig. 5a and b confirm that this is the case, although they demonstrate that the drying cracks as well as the air spheres have been filled with PCBM. Very faint contrast between the tsCuPc walls (darker) and the PCBM filled voids (lighter) can be discerned in Fig. 5c and the hexagonal arrangement of the PCBM filled voids can be identified.

The “slice and view” FIB method was used to further assess the internal composite structure. This consists of milling the film using FIB in order to expose its cross-section and image it using SEM. The film is then further milled in a direction perpendicular to the cross-section and another image is acquired. This step is repeated a number of times and the images are finally used to reconstruct a 3D model of the film. The “slice and view” dataset before any reconstruction shown in the ESI† confirms the success of the infiltration to form a 3D ordered nanocomposite. Results presented in Fig. 6 show the reconstructions of the tsCuPc phase, of the PCBM phase, and of the whole tsCuPc/PCBM nanocomposite film. The ordered continuous structure of the tsCuPc scaffold can be seen, as well as the pore interconnectivity. This latter feature is of importance in order to achieve complete infiltration with the PCBM phase and formation of a dense composite without air trapped inside. The PCBM phase is also continuous and adopts a structure comparable to the template polystyrene spheres; spherical domains are connected to each other by channels. Fig. 6 illustrates the high degree of interpenetration of the two networks. Comparison of structures shown in Fig. 1 and 6 indicates that the nanocomposites formed in this study possess an architecture very close to the targeted one.
 Fig. 6  3D reconstructed images showing the tsCuPc phase, the PCBM phase and both phases forming the nanocomposite. 
The model structures shown in Fig. 6 were analyzed quantitatively and the results are summarized in Table 1. The estimated errors due to thresholding in the reconstruction procedure were below 5% for both the volume fraction and the interfacial area to volume ratio calculations. For both template sphere sizes (i.e. 224 nm and 461 nm), the volume fractions of each phase differ from the theoretical values. If the structures were totally defect-free, the PCBM domains would be perfectly spherical and form a face centered cubic array. Therefore, the volume fraction of the tsCuPc phase would be 26% and that of the PCBM phase 74%. However, in both cases, the tsCuPc volume fraction is significantly higher. The nanocomposite grown using the 224 nm template spheres is comprised of almost 50% tsCuPc. This may be explained by the fact that thick tsCuPc walls were formed during inverse film growth and the thickness of the walls did not decrease much when reducing the template sphere size. The interfacial area between the tsCuPc and the PCBM phases was measured and compared to the total volume. As expected, the ratio of the interfacial area to the volume is higher for the nanocomposite grown with 224 nm template spheres: the corresponding value is ∼1.72 times larger than that obtained for the film grown with 461 nm template spheres. These two ratios can also be compared to the expected value for a bilayer donor–acceptor device. Typical electrode dimensions are 0.2 mm × 0.8 mm. Consequently, for a typical device thickness of 200 nm, the interfacial area to the volume ratio would be 5 µm−1, which is lower than the values obtained for both nanocomposites.

The results discussed here open up the possibility to create engineered nanocomposites whose structural properties can be easily controlled by varying the template sphere diameter. Furthermore, the films were grown on various substrate types including ITO and CuPc coated ITO, which is a first step towards optoelectronic applications, most notably OPV, where a continuous layer of the donor material at the ITO electrode has been reported to improve efficiency. The crystallinity of the films should also facilitate charge transport and lead to improved device performance. While the sphere diameters used here are too large to see improvement in a device based on this structure, on a reduced length scale the interconnectivity and the interpenetration of the two phases will provide a large surface area for exciton dissociation and also a continuous pathway for the dissociated charges to the electrodes. Quantitative analysis of 3D model structures reveals that the introduction of a nanostructured interface in the composite films significantly increases the ratio of the interfacial area to the total volume. If used in an OPV device, this type of interconnected architecture should result in an increased number of dissociated excitons and, thus, in improved efficiencies. Future work will involve the control of the nanocomposite thickness and the use of smaller sphere size templates (<100 nm) in order to form nanocomposites with structural dimensions more compatible with the exciton diffusion lengths of organic semiconductors.
Conclusions
3D colloidal crystals have been successfully used as templates for the formation of tsCuPc inverse films and tsCuPc/PCBM nanocomposite thin films. Samples have been characterized by Raman spectroscopy and XRD and show good crystalline quality. The film structure was assessed by SEM and SEM/FIB pseudo-tomography and consists of two ordered interpenetrating interconnected networks of tsCuPc and PCBM with an interfacial area to volume ratio 2–3 times greater than in a planar bilayer structure. This template-assisted approach allows the formation of engineered nanostructured composite thin films whose structural properties can be tuned in order to match the requirements for targeted device applications, including OPV.
