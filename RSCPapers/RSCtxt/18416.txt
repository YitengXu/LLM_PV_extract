The highly ordered structure and miniaturization design have the intrinsic advantages of not only providing a large active surface area and plentiful pores but also enhancing mass and electron transport. Consequently, the developed photoanode exhibits both good photoresponse and operation stability under irradiation. Besides, the solar energy storage performance of the microfluidic all-vanadium photoelectrochemical cell with the developed TiO2 nanotube array photoanode is evaluated under various light intensities and vanadium ion concentrations. The performances of TiO2 nanotube array photoanodes prepared with different anodizing voltages are also investigated. The obtained results show that an increase in both the light intensity and vanadium ion concentration can improve the performance in terms of photocurrent density and vanadium ion conversion rate. The photoanodes prepared at higher anodizing voltages have larger active surface area and photocatalyst loading, thus leading to the improved performance.
1. Introduction
The energy crisis has become one of the most important issues in ensuring sustainable development. For this reason, the utilization of renewable energy to replace fossil fuels attracts widespread attention.1–5 Among these renewable energy sources, solar energy is the most competitive candidate because it is extensive and abundant.6–8 However, the use of solar energy also faces a critical issue of intermittence. Hence, to address this inherent defect of sunlight, the storage of solar energy by converting it into chemical energy is one of the most feasible approaches for practical solar energy utilization.9,10 Photoelectrochemical technology has been demonstrated to be able to convert solar energy into chemical energy through simple and efficient systems.11–13 For example, Zhang et al.14 proposed a photoelectrochemical system for water splitting and obtained high H2 evolution efficiency. Li et al.15 reduced CO2 into methanol via a photocatalytic reaction and obtained a methanol yield of 4.94 mmol L−1 cm−2 after 6 h operation. Wang et al.16 converted solar energy into hydrogen and electricity through a photoelectrochemical cell. Recently, Liu et al.17 reported a method using vanadium redox pairs as the storage media to store solar energy. Among these systems, photoelectrochemical cells using the reversible redox couples VO2+, VO2+ and V3+, V2+ as the storage media have been recognized as promising candidates because of their large storage capacity, low cost and effectiveness in avoiding cross-contamination of metal ions.18 Hence, efforts have been devoted to the exploitation of all-vanadium photoelectrochemical cells (VPECs).19–21
In general, improvements in the performance of VPECs can be made via the following two strategies: the development of highly efficient photoanodes and the optimization of the cell structure.22,23 As the most commonly used photocatalyst, TiO2 has been applied in numerous photoelectrochemical systems due to its remarkable merits of non-toxicity, chemical stability and low cost.24–27 In these systems, the TiO2 nanoparticles were usually stacked on the substrate to form the photoanode through various methods, such as wet-spraying, screen-printing, etc.28–30 However, these stacked structures not only lowered the active surface area but also inhibited the separation of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs, resulting in poor mass transport and photocatalytic quantum efficiency. In response to the above mentioned limitations, photoanodes with one-dimensional TiO2 nanotube arrays produced by anodization have been proposed,31,32 because one-dimensional and highly ordered nanostructures have the intrinsic merits of facilitating the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and providing large active surface area and plentiful pores.33,34 Thus, these one-dimensional structures have been considered as favorable photoanode structures and applied in various photoelectrochemical systems.35–37
Regarding the cell structure, the conventional H-type reactor design used in VPECs still exhibits the defects of both low mass transfer and large internal resistance as well as non-uniform light distribution,13,17,21 which significantly restrict the promotion of solar energy storage. To address the mass transport issue, a microfluidic all-vanadium photoelectrochemical cell (μVPEC) by incorporating a microfluidic design into the VPEC has been proposed. This combination possesses several advantages of microfluidics, such as tremendous specific surface area and continuous-flow design,21,24,38 which can ensure both high mass transport efficiency and uniform light distribution, and therefore has potential in promoting the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy.39 However, the TiO2 nanoparticle-stacked photoanodes used in these μVPECs still exhibit limited performance enhancement. Inspired by the structural merits of both the microfluidic design and highly ordered one-dimensional structures, a microfluidic all-vanadium photoelectrochemical cell with a one-dimensional TiO2 nanotube array (TNA) photoanode was proposed for solar energy storage in the present work. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the proposed design can offer the following desired properties to overcome the bottlenecks encountered in conventional VPECs through the synergistic effect of the highly-ordered structure and the microfluidic design. Firstly, the one-dimensional nanotube array structure can not only facilitate fast electron transfer but also offer a large active surface area with plentiful pores, which promotes the photoelectrochemical reaction and enables high photocurrent density. Secondly, via the microfluidic design, the transfer resistances of both photons and reactants can be reduced. Moreover, the charge transfer resistance can be minimized. All the above-mentioned properties favor enhancement of the solar energy storage. In this work, the solar energy storage performance of the proposed μVPEC was evaluated under various design and operating conditions in terms of the vanadium ion conversion rate.

2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the TNA photoanode
In this work, a commercial titanium foil (Xinxin Metal Plastic Materials Store, China) with thickness: 0.3 mm, width: 10 mm and length: 25 mm was used as the titanium source to prepare the photoanode through anodization. The fabrication procedure can be divided into the following three steps. Firstly, the titanium foil was placed into a mixed solution consisting of ethanol, acetone and deionized water (volume ratio = 1:1:1), and cleaned under ultrasound for 10 min to remove surface contaminants, followed by drying in a nitrogen gas stream. Secondly, the titanium foil was covered by a resin tape to obtain an electrode area of 1 cm × 1 cm in the middle region of the foil. Then, DC power was used to realize the electrochemical anodization. The pre-treated Ti foil and a graphite plate were directly connected to the negative and positive terminals of the DC power supply, respectively, forming an applied voltage between the two electrodes in an ethylene glycol solution for 5 h. The ethylene glycol solution was prepared by dissolving NH4F and deionized water in ethylene glycol, in which the NH4F concentration was 0.15 M and the volume fraction of deionized water was 2%. To control the nanotube structure, the electrochemical anodization process was carried out at different DC voltages ranging from 10 V to 50 V. To remove the impurities, the obtained samples were ultrasonically cleaned in ethylene glycol for 15 min and in distilled water for 1 min. Finally, to ensure the TiO2 crystal transformation, the prepared samples were placed into a tube furnace and treated sequentially at 200 °C for 0.5 h and 480 °C for 1 h in air. Through the above-mentioned three steps, the TNA photoanode on titanium foil was prepared successfully.
2.2 Assembly and setup

Fig. 2 presents a schematic description of the μVPEC. The as-synthesized TNA with an electrode area of 1 cm × 1 cm was used as the photoanode. Commercial Pt-coated carbon paper with an exposed active area of 1 cm × 1 cm was used as the cathode. Two reaction microchambers with depth of 1 mm were used as the flow channels for the photoanode and cathode electrolytes. A Nafion®115 proton exchange membrane was used to separate the photoanode microchamber from the cathode microchamber. Both the electrolytes were injected into the μVPEC using a syringe pump. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as simulated sunlight to illuminate the photoanode. It should be noted that the Xe lamp illuminated the photoanode from the cathode side because the TNA formed on the titanium foil was opaque. For this reason, the cell fixture was made of PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate). Moreover, the arrangement of the photoanode and cathode was not exactly face-to-face. They were misaligned with a minimal edge distance of 15 mm to ensure light transmission, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Although the electrolytes at both the photoanode and cathode were translucent as a result of the presence of vanadium ions, the photons could still reach the photoanode through the electrolyte and membrane because of the narrow gap (∼2 mm) between the photoanode and cathode, thereby driving the anodic oxidation reaction of VO2+ → VO2+. Besides, a visible radiometer (FZ-Z, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University, China) was utilized to measure the light intensity. Real-time monitoring of the current was realized by a data collecting instrument (34972A, Agilent, USA).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the photoanode
The surface morphography of the prepared TNA photoanode was characterized using an S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan). Fig. 3a and b show the top view and cross-sectional image of the prepared TNA film anodized at 50 V for 5 h. As shown, the TiO2 nanotubes were uniformly distributed and compactly arranged on the Ti foil with an average inner pore size of about 82 nm. It was also found that the mean tube length of the TNA layer was about 8.3 μm. Besides, the crystal structure of the prepared TNA photoanode was also characterized using a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) and the results are shown in Fig. 3c. As shown, the TiO2 nanotubes were mainly composed of anatase TiO2 at different crystal planes, which was consistent with the previous report.40 These results indicated the formation of the favorable one-dimensional TiO2 nanotube array on the Ti foil. The highly ordered structure not only provided a large active surface area but also facilitated electron transfer through the one-dimensional structure.

3.2 Performance evaluation

3.2.1 Photoelectrochemical activity. 
In general, both the photoresponse and durability under illumination could reflect the photoelectrochemical activity of the prepared photoanode in the developed μVPEC. Hence, the photocurrent–time characteristics and the long-term operation were first examined to investigate the photoresponse and durability. Here, the light intensity was kept at 130 mW cm−2. The photoanodic VO2+ and cathodic V3+ concentrations were both 100 mM. The flow rates of both the electrolytes were set at 50 μL min−1. Fig. 4a shows the photoresponse behaviors of the μVPECs with both the commonly-used P25 photoanode21 and the developed TNA photoanode under periodic light-switching. By identifying one light-on and one light-off as a cycle, it can be seen that both the P25 and TNA photoanodes were able to exhibit a repeatable response to the illumination during the tested five cycles. When the light was irradiated on the photoanode, for the TNA photoanode, the photocurrent density promptly rose to about 0.078 A g−1 cm−2 and then slightly decreased to 0.065 A g−1 cm−2 and finally became relatively stable. While for the P25 photoanode,21 the photocurrent density under illumination was maintained at about 0.025 A g−1 cm−2, which was much smaller than that of the TNA photoanode. Besides, to describe the durability of the developed μVPECs with both the P25 and TNA photoanodes, the variation in the photocurrent density with time was also characterized, and the result is shown in Fig. 4b. It can be found that the photocurrent densities of the μVPECs with both the P25 and TNA photoanodes were relatively stable during the 6 h operation. For the P25 photoanode, the average photocurrent density was about 0.024 A g−1 cm−2.21 Whereas it was boosted to 0.065A g−1 cm−2 for the TNA photoanode, representing a remarkable improvement of about 171%, which indicated that the proposed TNA photoanode can not only enhance the activity but also exhibit excellent stability. This enhancement of the photoelectrochemical activity can be ascribed to the synergetic effect of the highly ordered one-dimensional structure and the large active surface area with abundant pores. Firstly, the one-dimensional nanotube array structure could promote electron transfer and the separation of the photo-excited electron–hole pairs,32,33 thereby promoting the photoanode reaction. On the other hand, the nanotube array could also offer plentiful pores and a large active surface area, promoting reactant transfer and providing abundant catalytic sites. Hence, compared to the traditional P25 photoanode, the photoelectrochemical activity could be significantly enhanced. These results revealed that the developed TNA photoanode had good photoresponse performance and yielded a relatively stable photocurrent density, which is promising for future applications.

In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also performed with an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, American). In the test, the photoanode, an Ag/AgCl electrode and a platinum plate were used as the working electrode, the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. The testing conditions were light intensity of 130 mW cm−2 and ion concentration of 100 mM. The results obtained are given in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the charge transfer resistance of the TNA photoanode was far lower than that of the conventional P25 photoanode. This improvement can be ascribed to the highly ordered one-dimensional nanotube array structure, which not only enhanced electron transport and the separation of the photo-excited electron–hole pairs, but also greatly increased the number of active sites. In addition, compared with the P25 photoanode prepared by the spraying method, the contact resistance between the nanotube array and the substrate was smaller, which also enhanced the electron transfer. Therefore, the TiO2 nanotube array photoanode exhibited smaller impedance, leading to the improved performance.

3.2.2 Conversion rate of the vanadium ions. 
To more clearly present the inherent merits of the μVPEC with the TNA photoanode, the performance of solar energy conversion was also investigated under various operation conditions by examining the rate of conversion of VO2+ to VO2+. In the present study, the vanadium ion conversion rate, N (μmol h−1), was evaluated using the following equations: (1) N = Q/(T·F)(2)where Q (C), I (A), T (h) and F represent the total charge during the operation period, the photocurrent, the operation time and the Faraday constant. Basically, the solar energy storage via the change in the valence states of the vanadium redox couples can essentially proceed as soon as the light irradiation hits the photoanode. Therefore, the light intensity could play a significant role in affecting the solar energy storage performance. Fig. 6a shows the effect of the light intensity on the conversion rate. During the testing, V3+ and VO2+ concentrations of 100 mM and photoanodic and cathodic flow rates of 50 μL min−1 were chosen. As shown, when the light intensity was set at 70 mW cm−2, the conversion rate was only 0.97 μmol h−1. However, as the light intensity increased from 70 to 130 mW cm−2, the conversion rate was remarkably enhanced to 2.14 μmol h−1. This enhancement could be ascribed to the following reasons. On one hand, the increase in light intensity meant that more photons reached the photoanode, which allowed more electron–hole pairs to be generated and thus produced more photo-excited holes with strong oxidizing ability to convert VO2+ into VO2+. On the other hand, the increased light intensity could provide more photons to generate more photo-excited electrons, which may recombine with the holes more frequently and thus inhibit the vanadium ion conversion. However, benefiting from the intrinsic merit of the one-dimensional TiO2 nanotube structure which facilitates electron transfer, the recombination of the photo-generated electrons and holes can be limited to some extent, leading to the enhancement of the solar energy conversion.
 Fig. 6  Variation of the conversion rate with (a) light intensity and (b) vanadium ion concentration, and (c) the change in light intensity with changing vanadium ion concentration. 
In addition, the influence of the vanadium ion concentration on the solar energy conversion was also studied. In this experiment, a light intensity of 130 mW cm−2 and electrolyte flow rates of 50 μL min−1 were used. To balance the charges in the photoanodic and cathodic microchambers, the vanadium ion concentrations at both electrodes were kept the same and changed simultaneously. The vanadium ion concentrations of the electrolytes ranged from 1 mM to 100 mM. Fig. 6b shows the effect of the vanadium ion concentration on the conversion rate. As shown, the conversion rate gradually increased from 1.459 μmol h−1 to 1.983 μmol h−1 with the increase in vanadium ion concentration, indicating that the increased concentration can have a positive effect on the photoelectrochemical reaction. The increased vanadium ion concentration can reduce the mass transfer resistance between the bulk and the active sites. The enhanced mass transfer means that the photo-excited holes can be captured by VO2+ more efficiently, accelerating the separation of the electron–hole pairs. Hence, the reaction rate at the TNA photoanode could be increased, which enlarged the photocurrent density, leading to the improvement in solar energy conversion. Specifically, it can also be found that the increase in the conversion rate from 1 mM to 50 mM was smaller than that from 50 mM to 100 mM. This disparity could be attributed to the combined effect of the mass transfer enhancement and the light attenuation through the photoanodic and cathodic electrolytes caused by the increased concentration. As shown in Fig. 6c, with the increased concentration, the light attenuation through the electrolytes became increasingly distinct. Actually, the light attenuation and the increase in vanadium ion concentration have opposite effects on the performance. As discussed above, the light intensity can significantly influence the solar energy conversion. The increased light attenuation indicated that the photon irradiation on the TNA photoanode was inhibited. Whereas for the increase in vanadium ion concentration, the enhanced ion transfer can result in the capture of the photo-excited holes being more efficient. Hence, when increasing the vanadium ion concentration, the competition between the light attenuation and the enhancement of the ion transfer determines the cell performance. As the concentration increased from 1 mM to 50 mM, the light intensity declined from 127 mW cm−2 to 110 mW cm−2, displaying an adverse effect on the vanadium ion conversion. However, due to the positive contribution from the enhanced mass transfer, a small enhancement of the ion conversion rate could still be achieved. On further increasing the ion concentration to 100 mM, the light intensity on the photoanode surface was reduced to 98 mW cm−2. Although the light attenuation further restricted the photoelectrochemical reaction, the increased concentration could contribute more significantly to the performance improvement, resulting in a more significant promotion of the conversion rate.
To further demonstrate the merits of the μVPEC with the TNA photoanode, we also made a performance comparison with reported studies, as listed in Table 1. As can be seen, in terms of the reactor structure, the performance of the μVPEC was better than that of the conventional H-type batch reactor as a result of the enhanced mass and photon transport and more uniform light distribution arising from the microfluidic design. With regard to the photocatalyst type, the one-dimensional TNA exhibited a better performance than the photoanodes with the nanoparticles stacked on the substrates as a result of enhanced electron transfer. In particular, benefiting from the combination of the microfluidic reactor and the TiO2 nanotube array, the photocurrent density was larger than the other designs. This fact indicates that the μVPEC with the TNA photoanode exhibits good photoelectrochemical activity and shows outstanding potential for future applications in solar energy storage.

3.3 Effect of the anodizing voltage
Since the nanostructure of the anodized TiO2 nanotube array strongly depends on the anodizing voltage, the influence of the anodizing voltage on the performance is discussed in this section. Three sample photoanodes prepared at anodizing voltages of 10 V, 30 V and 50 V were chosen and investigated. The top views and cross-sectional views of the TNA photoanodes prepared at different anodizing voltages are given in Fig. 7. By comparing the results in Fig. 3a and b and 7, it can be found that with the increase in the anodizing voltage from 10 V to 50 V, the average inner pore size of the nanotubes was gradually enlarged from about 18 nm to about 82 nm. The mean nanotube length was increased from about 0.6 μm to 8.3 μm, and the pore density was decreased from about 53.47 × 109 pores per cm2 to 9.83 × 109 pores per cm2. In addition, to further describe the disparity between the TNA samples prepared at different anodizing voltages, according to previous studies,42–44 the exposed surface area and specific surface area were also calculated using the following equations: (3) (4)where Di (nm) and Do (nm) denote the average inner and outer diameter of the nanotubes; Ai (nm2 per tube) represents the exposed surface area of a single nanotube; L (nm) is the mean tube length of the nanotubes; A0 (cm2 cm−2) is the exposed surface area per unit electrode area, which was 1 cm × 1 cm in this work; n (pores per cm2) is the pore density, which means the total number of pores per unit area in the TNA.
 Fig. 7  Top view and cross-sectional view of the TiO2 nanotube arrays prepared at different anodizing voltages of 10 V (a and b) and 30 V (c and d). 
Besides, the photocatalyst loading could be determined by the following equation: M = ρV(5)where M (mg cm−2) is the TNA loading; ρ is the density of anatase TiO2, i.e. 3.85 g cm−3, because the TiO2 nanotubes were mainly composed of anatase TiO2 (see Fig. 3c and 8); V (cm3) is the total volume of the prepared TNA photocatalyst. In this work, the total volume of TNA, V, was estimated by: V = nLSA(6)where L (nm) is the mean tube length of the nanotubes and is determined from the cross-sectional SEM images of the TNA samples; S (cm2) is the top area of a single nanotube; A is the electrode area, i.e. 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm2. The top area, S, is calculated by eqn (7): (7)

With these equations, the photocatalyst loading could then be estimated and is given in Table 2.

Table 2 lists detailed information about the pore density and the exposed surface area as well as the specific surface area of the samples prepared at various anodizing voltages. As can be seen, benefiting from the smaller pore size, the TNA samples prepared at low anodizing voltage show larger pore density. Low anodizing voltage also resulted in shorter nanotube length. Although the pore density gradually declined with increasing the voltage, the enlarged mean nanotube length led to an increase in both the exposed surface area and the TNA photocatalyst loading. As such, the exposed surface area per unit electrode area was remarkably increased from 70.36 cm2 cm−2 (10 V) to 464.35 cm2 cm−2 (50 V). The photocatalyst loading increased from 0.20 mg cm−2 at 10 V to 0.78 mg cm−2 at 50 V (see Table 2). The increase in both the exposed surface area and the photocatalyst loading can provide more active sites for the photoelectrochemical reaction, and thus has the potential to enhance the performance.
Furthermore, the crystal structures of the above-mentioned samples were also characterized using XRD, and the results are shown in Fig. 8. As shown, the XRD peaks of anatase TiO2 and the Ti substrate can be observed for all three samples, and the intensity of the TiO2 signals was gradually enhanced with the increase in anodizing voltage (see Fig. 3c and 8). This is because at a low anodizing voltage of 10 V, only a thin TNA layer could be formed on the Ti foil (see Fig. 7a and b), and thus the intensity of the Ti substrate signal is greater. Whereas with the increase in anodizing voltage, both the mean nanotube length and the TNA loading were increased (see Fig. 7c and d and Table 2), resulting in an obvious increase in the intensity of the TiO2 signal.
Finally, the performances of the TNA photoanodes prepared at different anodizing voltages were assessed and the results are shown in Fig. 9. Here, a light intensity of 130 mW cm−2, ion concentrations of 100 mM and flow rates of 50 μL min−1 at both the photoanode and the cathode were selected. As shown in Fig. 9, the vanadium ion conversion rate was increased from 0.97 μmol h−1 to 2.14 μmol h−1 on increasing the anodizing voltage from 10 V to 50 V. As discussed above, with the increase in the anodizing voltage, both the exposed surface area and the photocatalyst loading were increased. Because the increased active surface area and TNA loading could offer more active sites for the photoelectrochemical reaction, more VO2+ could be oxidized on the TNA surface of the photoanode. Meanwhile, with the increase in the anodizing voltage, the larger pore size of the TiO2 nanotubes could facilitate the transport of vanadium ions into the nanotubes,44 which could also increase the photoelectrochemical reaction rate, leading to improved solar energy storage.

4. Conclusions
In this work, a high-performance photoanode with a one-dimensional TiO2 nanotube array was developed for a microfluidic all-vanadium photoelectrochemical cell to efficiently store solar energy. By combining the merits of the miniaturized design and the one-dimensional nanotube structure, the proposed μVPEC can provide the advantages of large active surface area and abundant pores accompanied by fast electron transfer, resulting in higher energy conversion efficiency. The experimental results indicated that the proposed TNA photoanode exhibited good photoresponse and stability upon illumination. Besides, the effects of both the light intensity and the concentration of vanadium ions as well as the anodizing voltage were also studied. It can be found that an increase in both light intensity and vanadium ion concentration facilitated an improvement in both the photocurrent density and the vanadium ion conversion rate because more electron–hole pairs were generated and the mass transport was enhanced. A high anodizing voltage could result in a TNA with larger active surface area and photocatalyst loading, leading to more efficient solar energy storage. Furthermore, it should also be pointed out that although the proposed photoanode in combination with the microfluidic design can significantly enhance the photocurrent, the output of the μVPEC is still rather small. More works on the integration of multiple microreactors and the optimization of the photoanode may be necessary to distinctly improve the overall output of the system for real applications.
