    , Accepted 6th December 2012First published on 7th December 2012AbstractSquarylium dyes with linearly π-extended structures involving three cyclobutene cores and four heterocyclic components were designed as metal-free sensitizing dyes that can enhance spectral responses in the range over 800 nm and successfully synthesized through the combination of Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling using stannylcyclobutenediones and condensation reactions. The dyes exhibited intense absorption in the NIR region with maxima at around 850 nm and onsets at around 950 nm. Although the HOMO levels remained at the same levels as the corresponding standard squaraine dye, the LUMO levels of the dyes were at lower energies owing to the lowering of the bandgaps of the dyes. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on these dyes exhibiting significantly wide spectral response including the NIR region showed enhanced short-circuit current density. Co-sensitization of the NIR-absorbing dyes with a standard far-red absorbing squaraine dye produced a complementary effect in spectral response, resulting in the increase in short-circuit current density.
Introduction
Squaraine dyes consisting of an electron-deficient central cyclobutene unit and two electron-donating aromatic/heterocyclic components are being actively researched due to their intense absorption in the long-wavelength region and their molecular packing tendency in the solid state.1 Valuable applications that can take advantage of these unique properties include use as chemosensors,2 noncovalent fluorescent probes for bioanalysis,3 nonlinear optics,4 organic light-emitting diodes,5 and organic thin-film solar cells.6 One of the applications that has attracted most attention is the use of squarylium dyes as metal-free sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).7 To improve the overall photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs, it is important to use the whole range of the spectrum of sunlight including visible and near-infrared (NIR) light. Squaraine dyes contribute to the enhancement of photovoltaic performance in the far-red and NIR regions, for which high-performance, metal-free sensitizers with a donor–π–acceptor array, as typified by triarylamine- and carbazole-based compounds having cyanoacrylic acids, show insufficient performance owing to the lack of light-harvesting ability.7,8 Far-red-absorbing indolenine-based squarylium dyes bearing carboxylic groups directly attached to the indole components and cyanoacryl groups incorporated by thiophene linkers achieved a high conversion efficiency, originating from the unidirectional flow of electrons from cyclobutene cores to the semiconductor surface.9 Although a lot of squaraine dyes exhibiting absorptions mainly in the far-red region have been reported as efficient sensitizers of TiO2 photoelectrodes, the photo-to-electric conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on these dyes in the NIR region above 800 nm is still insufficient.10 The use of π-extended heterocycles as substituents at the 1,3-position of cyclobutene instead of indolenines causes the shift of absorption wavelength from the far-red to NIR region.11 Dyes with π-extended heterocycles have been utilized as sensitizers for DSSCs, and the cells have shown spectral response in the NIR region. The use of homoditopic heterocyclic components for squaraine synthesis, which allows condensation with two equivalents of semi-squarylium and thereby produces squaraines with two cyclobutenedione cores, is effective for the synthesis of NIR-absorbing squaraine dyes since the two cyclobutenedione cores lie in the same plane, enhancing the extension of the π-conjugation.12 However, the connection of squaraines through π-conjugated linkers may seem to contribute to a redshift of their absorptions in solutions, but have only a limited effect on the absorption because intramolecular charge transfers between the squaraine dyes via π-conjugated linkers are inhibited by the distortion between the squaraines and linker components.6f,13 The polymers in which squaric acid residues and N-alkylated pyrroles were alternately connected by a condensation reaction exhibited intense absorption in the NIR region over 800 nm, suggesting that a direct connection between the squaraine chromophore and additional cyclobutene cores benefits the NIR absorption property.1c In the current work, we proposed a novel class of near-infrared-absorbing squarylium sensitizers with linearly extended π-conjugated structures, which were obtained by Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions with stannylcyclobutenedione used as a nucleophilic cyclobutenedione equivalent.14 The absorption was bathochromically shifted up to 138 nm by the incorporation of an additional semi-squaraine into a squaraine chromophore. The DSSCs based on these dyes showed a significant spectral response in the region over 750 nm. According to the design method, further extension of the π-conjugation should be accomplished by the subsequent fusion of semi-squaraine components to the linearly π-extended squarylium dyes and lead to the development of squaraine sensitizers for DSSCs with improved spectral responses in the NIR region.
We report here the synthesis of squaraine dyes exhibiting absorption in the range over 800 nm by means of the linear π-extension method utilizing Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions with stannylcyclobutenediones, and their application to DSSCs (Fig. 1). The spectral response of DSSCs based on these dyes in which three cyclobutene cores and four heterocyclic components were alternately connected was found from around 1000 nm to the visible region. Furthermore, DSSCs fabricated with a mixture of the newly synthesized dye and far-red-absorbing squaraine dyes exhibited enhancement of short-circuit current density due to the complementary effect in light harvesting, indicating the potential use of linearly π-extended squaraines as co-sensitizers.

Results and discussion
For DSSC applications, anchoring groups on the dye were needed to ensure the adsorption on the TiO2-based photoelectrode and efficient electron injection from the dyes to the conduction bands of TiO2.7 We designed our unsymmetrical squaraine-based dyes with a carboxy group on the terminal indolenine components accordingly. A diiodinated indolenine-based squarylium dye (1) was used for a starting material and reacted with stannylcyclobutenedione (2) according to the previous method to afford a semi-squarate (3) in which an iodine substitution remained on one side (Scheme 1).14† The semi-squarate was hydrolyzed and the resulting semi-squarylium (4) was reacted with indolenine and benzothiazole derivatives under azeotropic conditions to afford bis-squaraine dyes with an iodine substitution (6a–b). The mono-iodide derivatives were subsequently coupled with stannylcyclobutenedione, and the resulting semisquarates (7a–b) were hydrolyzed to give precursory semi-squarylium (8a–b). Finally, condensation of the precursors with indolenium salt having a carboxy group gave linearly π-extended unsymmetrical, squarylium sensitizers possessing three cyclobutene cores and four heterocyclic components (TSQa–b).

The absorption spectra of TSQa, TSQb, and a standard squaraine dye (MSQ) in solution are shown in Fig. 2, and the characteristic data are summarized in Table 1. These dyes exhibited intense and sharp absorption in the NIR region. Maxima were found at 856 nm for TSQa and at 848 nm for TSQb and their onsets of absorption reached approximately 950 nm. The absorption maxima of TSQ were bathochromically shifted ca. 200 nm compared to MSQ and ca. 70 nm compared to previously-reported squarylium sensitizers in which two cyclobutene cores and three heterocyclic components were alternately connected.14 This indicated that π-electrons were delocalized into the whole of the dye molecules including the additional semisquarylium components without the breaking of π-conjugation stemming from distortions between π-conjugated components. TSQ exhibited absorption in the visible region from 700 to 450 nm with moderate intensity, promising panchromatic performance for TSQ. The molar absorption coefficients at absorption maxima were found to be 3.36 × 105 for TSQa and 3.47 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for TSQb. These values were higher than that of standard MSQ (2.56 × 105 M−1 cm−1), indicating high light-harvesting properties in the NIR region. Absorption spectra of TSQ immobilized on TiO2 films in the presence of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) were broadened, implying an interaction between dyes immobilized on TiO2 and electronic coupling between the dye and TiO2.11c,17

The cyclic voltammograms of TSQa and TSQb showed irreversible oxidation waves with two peaks in the potential range from −0.20 to 0.75 V, but showed reversible waves in the scan from −0.2 to 0.3 V (Fig. 3). These results indicate that TSQ exhibited electrochemical reversibility under the one-electron oxidation conditions, while the electroactive species yielded in two-electron oxidation of TSQ showed no clear reversibility under the measurement conditions. To obtain an efficient charge separation, the LUMO of the dye should be more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (Ecb), and the HOMO of the dye should be more positive than the redox potential of the redox mediator as typified by I−/I3−. Therefore, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of TSQ were estimated by the oxidation potentials measured by cyclic voltammograms and the optical bandgap determined by the onsets of absorption (Fig. 4). The oxidation potentials Eox corresponding to HOMO levels of TSQ were almost the same as that of standard MSQ, although the π-conjugation was significantly expanded by the fusion of the additional two squaraine chromophores. The oxidation potentials were all sufficiently more positive than the I−/I3− redox potential value (ca. 0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating that the oxidized dyes could thermodynamically accept electrons from the I− ions. The bandgap of TSQ (1.32 eV for TSQa, 1.29 eV for TSQb) was much lower than those of previously reported squaraine dyes owing to the linear extension of π-conjugation. Therefore, Eox–E0–0 corresponding to the LUMO levels of TSQ were much higher than that of MSQ. However, the potential levels of Eox–E0–0 of TSQ were more negative than the potentials of the TiO2 conduction band edge (−0.5 V vs. NHE), which remained at a high energy for thermodynamically favorable injection of electrons.

To obtain insight into their molecular structures and electron distributions of TSQ, DFT calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G level (Fig. 5).† The HOMOs for TSQ are π orbitals delocalizing mainly on central cyclobutene cores and heterocyclic components. The HOMO − 1 orbitals are found on the cyclobutene cores located on either side of central squaraine chromophores. By contrast, the LUMOs are spread throughout the dye molecules. This suggests that the LUMOs are significantly affected by the fusion of additional squaraine components to central squaraine components while the HOMOs depend on the central squaraine components despite the expansion of the π-conjugations. It is important for efficient electron injection from excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 to situate the LUMOs close to the anchoring groups because the orbital overlap with the titanium 3d orbitals is thereby enhanced.18 In the LUMO of TSQ, the electron density was located on terminal indolenium components bearing carboxylic acid on the TiO2 surface, indicating that the transitions from HOMO to LUMO could effectively convert the electron density to the anchoring group. Thus, a unidirectional electron transfer from the cyclobutene core to the terminal indolenine with the anchoring group could take place through a HOMO–LUMO transition in TSQ, promising efficient electron injection to TiO2.

The photovoltaic properties of the solar cells fabricated with TiO2 photoelectrodes sensitized with TSQa and TSQb and an iodine-based electrolyte are summarized in Table 2, and the J–V curves and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the devices are illustrated in Fig. 6. DSSCs based on both dyes exhibited spectral responses in the remarkably long-wavelength region from ca. 1000 nm and local maxima at around 850 nm. In addition, the IPCE values of DSSCs based on TSQ found in the visible region from 600 to 400 nm indicated the contribution of the additional absorption properties observed in their absorption spectra. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) values of the DSSCs with TSQ (8.05 mA cm−2 for TSQ1a, 8.89 mA cm−2 for TSQb) were greater than those with MSQ (5.25 mA cm−2) fabricated under same conditions. The improvements of Jsc should be attributed to the expansion of the light-harvesting ability ensuring panchromatic response in addition to the NIR response. However, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the TSQ-based cell was low (0.45 V), which had a significant influence on its overall conversion efficiency (η). This result would be attributed to the significant charge recombination between the cationic species and electrons injected into TiO2. The use of two sensitizers in DSSCs, which are complementary in their light-harvesting properties, leads to enhancement of spectral responses.19 To gain insight into the possibility of TSQ for co-sensitizers combined with visible-light-absorbing sensitizers, DSSCs with TSQa and far-red absorbing MSQ were preliminarily fabricated and characterized. The spectral response from 700 to 550 nm was improved by the sensitizing effect of MSQ. Reflecting the result, the Jsc value of the cell was improved to 11.6 mA cm−2 although the Voc remained at a low value. Thus, effort should be directed towards the improvement of Voc including the modification of device structure and dye design, but TSQa was found to act as a co-sensitizer making up for deficiencies of the spectral response in the NIR region.

Conclusion
Novel squarylium dyes (TSQa–b), in which three cyclobutene cores and four heterocyclic components were alternately fused to linearly expand π conjugation, were successfully synthesized through the combination of the Pd-catalyzed coupling reaction of iodinated squarylium and tributylstannylsquarate and the condensation of the resulting semi-squarylium with heterocyclic moieties. The dyes showed absorption in the NIR region with maxima at around 850 nm. The cyclic voltammetry of TSQ indicated that HOMO levels of TSQ were comparable to those of a standard squaraine dye (MSQ). In contrast, the lowering of the bandgap attributed to the extension of π-conjugation lowered the LUMO energy levels. Thus, the red shifts in the absorption spectra of the three dyes are attributed to a shift of the LUMO levels to higher energies rather than to a decrease in the energy of the HOMO levels. DSSCs based on TSQ displayed not only remarkable responses in the NIR region from 1000 nm but also a panchromatic response, leading to enhanced short-circuit current density in DSSCs. The power conversion efficiencies of DSSCs with TSQ reached up to 2.4%, although the open-circuit voltage remained low due to the severe charge recombination. Co-sensitization with NIR-absorbing TSQ and far-red absorbing MSQ showed a complementary effect in spectral response and resulted in enhanced short-circuit current density. Thus, TSQ contributed to the enhancement of spectral response of DSSCs in the range over 800 nm. At the same time, however, this work elucidated that further π-extension achieved by the synthetic method could result in a mismatch of the LUMO levels of obtained dyes and the conduction band of TiO2 because the LUMO levels of dyes significantly lowered with the decrease in their band gaps. The utilization of other wide-band-gap semiconductors such as SnO2 may be required to obtain further π-extended squaraine dyes by this method.

Silica gel (SiO2, spherically-shaped, neutral) for flash chromatography was purchased from Kanto chemical. 1-Heptyl-5-iodo-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium iodide, 1-butyl-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium iodide (5a), 3-butyl-2-methyl-1,3-benzothiazol-3-ium iodide (5b), and 1-butyl-5-carboxy-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium iodide (9) were prepared according to the literature.15 3-(1-Methyl)ethyloxy-4-(tributylstannyl)cyclobut-3-ene-1,2-dione (2) was synthesized by the reaction of 3,4-bis(1-methylethoxy)-3-cyclobutene-1,2-dione with (tri-n-butylstannyl)trimethylsilane.16 The NMR spectra were obtained using a JEOL ECX-400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 1H-NMR and 100 MHz for 13C-NMR. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (δ) downfield from tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) measurements were performed on a Shimadzu AXIMA-CFR plus spectrometer using dithranol as a matrix. The IR spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu FT-IR 8400S spectrophotometer. The absorption spectra and fluorescence emission spectra were measured in a 1.0 cm quartz cell on a Shimadzu UV-3100 spectrophotometer and a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorometer. The oxidation potential of the dye was measured at a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1 on a Hokuto Denko HZ-5000 electrochemical measurement system equipped with a normal one-compartment cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt counter electrode, and a nonaqueous Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The measurement was performed in a CH2Cl2 solution including 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as a supporting electrolyte. The system was internally calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+).

General procedure for fabrication and photovoltaic measurements of dye-sensitized solar cells. 
Transparent TiO2 photoelectrodes (∼12 μm thick, 5 mm × 5 mm) were fabricated by screen-printing. Nanocrystalline TiO2 paste [PST-18NR (particle size; ca. 20 nm), JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd, Japan] was printed two times on the glass substrate coated with transparent conduction oxide (F-doped SnO2). After drying at 125 °C for 10 min, TiO2 paste consisting of large TiO2 particles (ca. 400 nm, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd, Japan) was coated on it as a scattering center. The resulting substrate was gradually heated and sintered at 500 °C for 15 min. After cooling, the sintered TiO2 films were impregnated in a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and then washed with distilled water and methanol. After drying under reduced pressure, treated TiO2 films were sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min. The resulting TiO2 photoelectrodes were immersed in a solution of dyes (0.12 mM) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 6.0 mM) in t-BuOH/acetonitrile (1/1 (v/v)) and then kept at a given temperature overnight, followed by washing with acetonitrile to remove the non-adsorbed dye. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 film and a Pt-coated ITO glass substrate were separated by a Teflon spacer (25 μm thick) that had two tiny cuts for injection of the electrolyte and then clipped together. The electrolyte consisting of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI), 0.1 M LiI, and 0.05 M I2 in CHCl3/acetonitrile (1/1, v/v) was introduced into the interspace between the TiO2 photoelectrode and the Pt counter electrode to obtain a sandwich cell. The photovoltaic performance of the DSSC was measured using an AM 1.5 solar simulator (CEP-2000, Bunko-Keiki, Japan) equipped with a source meter (Keithley 2400). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using an action spectrum measurement system connected to a solar simulator (CEP-2000, Bunko-Keiki, Japan).
