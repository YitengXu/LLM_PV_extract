    , Accepted 2nd March 2019First published on 9th March 2019AbstractMixed halide perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx) solar cells have been widely researched because of their excellent photoelectronic properties. However, Cl doping is difficult to obtain due to the low formation energy and low boiling point of MAPbCl3 which can decompose into PbCl2 and MACl. MACl can leave the perovskite film during the annealing process leading to the loss of Cl and undesirable pinholes or cracks. Here, we present the chloroformamidinium chloride (Cl-FACl) as a “stabilizer” to stabilize Cl ions and thus restrain the removal of Cl avoiding the undesirable defects. With the introduction of Cl-FACl, improvement of film quality and reduction of defects result in a longer TRPL decay time and thus more stable devices. High-efficiency methylammonium lead trihalide (MAPbI3−xClx) perovskite solar cells with an efficiency up to 20.36% have been achieved with negligible hysteresis.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been extremely attractive due to their excellent optical and electronic properties, such as a suitable optical bandgap, high absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, high charge mobility of both electrons and holes, and long charge carrier diffusion lengths.1–6 In the past few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has already been increased up to more than 23%.7,8 Similar to other kinds of thin film solar cells, the film quality of perovskite can seriously affect the device performance. Great efforts have been made to delicately control the film quality of perovskite layers, which is the key to achieving both high efficiency and reproducibility.9–18 Doping in an anti-solvent during spin-coating,19,20 hot-substrate casting,21,22 and adding additives23–25 have been used to assist the film formation. Among them, the use of additives has been proven to be an effective method for assisting homogeneous nucleation or for regulating the crystallization kinetics. With the inclusion of additives, the film morphology will be well controlled during film formation, which is expected to reduce the bulk defects during the device fabrication, and thus additives can support the development of high-performance solar cells.26
Among the various additives, chloride containing additives have attracted a lot of attention due to the Cl ion. With the addition of Cl containing additives, the Cl ion can be incorporated into the crystal lattice to produce mixed halide perovskites (MAPbI3−xClx), which have been reported to exhibit a longer carrier diffusion length compared with pure CH3NH3PbI3.3 The Cl-doped perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx) has demonstrated excellent optoelectronic properties by eliminating the structural and energetic discontinuities at grain boundaries.27–31 The stronger electronegativity of chlorine (vs. iodine) and the associated more rigid bonds formed with lead ions could restrain the lattice distortions and shift the holes and electrons far from the defect centers.32,33 The carrier diffusion length improvement, optimization of film growth and charge transport, defect density reduction of the mixed halide perovskite confirm that the Cl containing additives can improve the device performance dramatically.34 In a previous report, common Cl sources including MACl and PbCl2 are frequently added into the perovskite precursor solutions. And these materials can produce pure halide perovskites (MAPbCl3) directly, which may potentially produce impure phases in the iodide based perovskite film.21 Furthermore, Cl doping is difficult to obtain due to the low formation energy and low boiling point of MAPbCl3 which can decompose into PbCl2 and MACl during the annealing process.35 And it is generally believed that Cl leaves the perovskite film as methylammonium chloride (MACl) in the thermal annealing process,36 which may result in undesirable pinholes or cracks.37 Therefore, more effective Cl containing additives are demanded. On the one hand the additive can provide Cl ions, and on the other hand, it will not be removed from the film during the annealing process avoiding the undesirable defects. Finally, it can work as a “stabilizer” to stabilize Cl ions.
In this work, we present chloroformamidinium chloride (Cl-FACl) as a novel Cl containing additive for high-efficiency methylammonium lead trihalide (MAPbI3−xClx) perovskite solar cells. Cl-FACl is directly added into the perovskite precursor solution to control the film formation and improve the optoelectronic properties. The film quality is largely improved with Cl-FACl and the grains become larger, and the trap density is reduced compared with the control film. The trap states are effectively passivated with the addition of Cl-FACl which is confirmed by the prolonged PL decay compared with the pristine films. Obviously, the radius of the cation part (Cl-FA) is larger than that of FA and thus larger than that of MA, and the Cl-FA is very hard to dope into the perovskite crystal lattice, which can stay in the grain boundaries to passivate the defects. Meanwhile, Cl-FACl is more difficult to volatilize than MACl and thus stabilize the Cl in the film leading to a more stable device. Devices with an inverted structure of ITO/P3CT-N/MAPbI3−xClx/PC61BM/BCP/Ag are fabricated to assess the impact of the addition of Cl-FACl on the device performance. The champion device with Cl-FACl shows a PCE up to 20.36% with negligible hysteresis, while the control devices show a champion PCE of 18.93% with a larger hysteresis. In addition, for devices with Cl-FACl, the max power point output exhibits comparatively much slower degradation compared with the rapid decline of the control device. Remarkably, our results suggest that the addition of a tiny amount of Cl-FACl can effectively promote the performance of methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite solar cells, including efficiency and stability.
Results and discussion
Different concentrations (from 0 to 5 mol% of the Cl-FACl/MAI ratio) of Cl-FACl are added into the as-prepared MAPbI3 precursor solutions to investigate the effect of the Cl-FACl doping amount on their optical and electronic properties. Fig. 1a shows the chemical structure of Cl-FACl. Fig. 1b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra for the as-deposited films. All XRD results demonstrate that the perovskite films crystallize in a typical tetragonal crystal (I4/mcm) structure, which is consistent with a previous report.2 An obvious successive shift in the peak position toward higher 2 theta values could be observed for the (220) and (310) peaks with the increase of the Cl-FACl amount (Fig. 1c and d). Gradually positive shift indicates the shrinking of the crystal lattice with the increase of smaller ion content doping into the MAPbI3 lattice. It can be easily accepted that the radii of the ions are in the order Cl-FA > FA > MA while Cl < I. Thus, the smaller ions resulting in the shrinking of the crystal lattice are Cl ions, not Cl-FA.

The N 1s peaks of the annealed films with (w)/without (wo) Cl-FACl which demonstrate the Cl-FA ions remaining in the annealed film (Fig. 2a). The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra confirm the existence of Cl in the film with the incorporation of Cl-FACl (Fig. S1†). The Pb 4f peaks of the film doped with Cl-FACl shift toward higher binding energies (Fig. 2b) in contrast to the sample without doping. This shift to higher binding energies indicates the removal of electron density from the Pb atoms, pointing to stronger binding with the Pb, which can be attributed to the Cl due to the stronger electronegativity of Cl than I. The existence of Cl can be confirmed by the Cl 2p peaks (Fig. 2c), which includes Cl from hydrochloride (HCl) and chloroformamidine (Cl-FA). It should be noted that the Cl in Cl-FA is hard to ionize in solution, and thus the lattice shrinking is caused by the Cl from NH2+Cl−. The grain size becomes larger with the increase of Cl-FACl which can be demonstrated by the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Fig. 3). The SEM results confirm that the addition of Cl-FACl plays an important role in assisting the film growth.

The onset value of the UV-vis absorption spectra regularly blue shifted from 800 to 780 nm along with the increasing doping mole fraction of Cl-FACl from 0 to 5 mol% (Fig. S2a†). The bandgap of the perovskites is thus tuned from 1.55 eV (absorption edge at 800 nm) to 1.59 eV (absorption edge at 780 nm) with increasing concentration of Cl-FACl (Fig. S2b†). The trend of the bandgap varied with the increase of the Cl amount as has been reported in a previous study, which is also consistent with the results above.37
Considering all the evidence we have presented above, it is obvious that a tiny amount of Cl has been incorporated into the MAPbI3 with the addition of Cl-FACl. To understand the possible chemical reactions involved in the perovskite formation process, we describe our postulated reaction process here based on all the investigation above: Cl-FACl + PbI2 + MAI → Cl-FAI + PbCl2 + MACl(1) MAI + PbI2 + PbCl2 + MACl → MAPbI3−xClx + MACl (gas)(2) Cl-FAI + MACl (gas) → Cl-FACl + MAI(3)
Due to the stronger electronegativity of Cl, I ions in PbI2 and MAI may exchange with Cl producing PbCl2 and MACl. During the perovskite film formation, the Cl ions in the formed PbCl2 will further exchange with the I ions from MAPbI3, transforming into MAPbI3−xClx composite films.35 Furthermore, the Cl-FA ions may capture the Cl ions and restrain the removal of MACl gas.
Devices have been fabricated to find out the best concentration of Cl-FACl doping into the precursor. The device structure is ITO/P3CT-N/perovskite/PC61BM/BCP/Ag (Fig. 5a). A clear trend of enhancement in device performance produced by the introduction of Cl-FACl into the perovskite precursor solution from 0 to 0.6 mol% can be observed in Fig. 4. Open circuit voltage (Voc) has an obvious increasing trend, which can be attributed to two aspects: the increasing bandgap and the reduced trap states. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) is used to investigate the electronic structures of the perovskite films with and without Cl-FACl, and the Fermi level (EF) of the film with Cl-FACl is shifted to higher binding energy relative to that of the film without Cl-FACl (Fig. S3a†). According to previously reports, the shift of EF indicates a more n-type nature for the film with Cl incorporation and can result in an increase in Voc.38,39 The energy levels match well based on the results of UPS. The energy levels are summarized in the energy band diagram (Fig. S3b†). With increasing the concentration range from 0.6 mol% to 5 mol%, the performance decreases quickly, especially for current density (Jsc). Because of the incorporation of Cl, the bandgap gradually becomes larger. The reduction of Jsc is related to the blue shift of the absorption edge. The optoelectronic properties will benefit from a small amount of doping, while too much incorporation will impact the performance. The best concentration of Cl-FACl peaks at 0.6 mol%.

The HI of the device with Cl doping is 1.47%, while the HI of the device without doping is 3.49% which is two-fold that of the device with doping. Hysteresis is directly related to the film quality or the trap states and thus can seriously affect the stability of perovskite solar cells.40,41 The lower HI demonstrates the high film quality and fewer trap states of the perovskite with the additive of Cl-FACl as compared with the control film.
The space-charge limited current (SCLC) for different bias voltages is characterized to quantitatively analyze the defect density. Sandwich devices are fabricated by inserting the perovskite films between ITO/P3CT-N and gold (inset of Fig. 5c). The defect density (Nt) based on the SCLC measurements is calculated according to the following equation:42  where ε and ε0 are the dielectric constant of the perovskite and the vacuum permittivity, respectively. VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, L is the thickness of the perovskite films (inset images in Fig. 5c and 4d), and e is the elementary charge. We calculate the defect density to be 4.75 × 1015 cm−3 and 5.70 × 1015 cm−3 for the 460 nm thick perovskite films with and without Cl-FACl, respectively. The results further demonstrate the fewer trap states in the perovskite doped with Cl than that without doping. As shown in Fig. 5e, the PL intensity of the Cl-doped perovskite films is about 3 times higher than that of the control films. The enhancement of PL intensity further confirms the synergistic effect of Cl doping on the suppressed non-radiative recombination associated with a lower trap density, which is consistent with previous reports.43 To analyse the dynamic recombination, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurement is performed (Fig. 5f). The PL decay curves are fitted to a bi-exponential rate law:44  where A1 and A2 are the relative amplitudes and τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes for the fast and slow recombination, respectively. The decay is ascribed mainly to trap-assisted recombination at defects. The film with Cl-FACl presents fast and slow phase lifetimes of τ1 = 27.7 ns (fraction A1 = 21.85%) and τ2 = 168.7 ns (fraction A2 = 61.70%), and the average lifetime is 110.1 ns. In contrast, the sample without Cl-FACl gives τ1 = 24.0 ns (fraction A1 = 23.66%) and τ2 = 126.1 ns (fraction A2 = 67.09%), and the average lifetime is 90.3 ns. This indicates a lower defect concentration and hence superior electronic quality of the Cl-FACl containing perovskite film, consistent with the higher Voc of the corresponding PSC.20
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement is performed under AM1.5G solar spectra at 100 mW cm−2 irradiance (Fig. 6a). And the integrated Jsc values are 21.1 mA cm−2 and 20.4 mA cm−2 for the devices with and without Cl-FACl, respectively. With the inclusion of Cl, the EQE of the device with Cl-FACl shows a blue shift, which is consistent with the results of absorption spectra. Impedance spectroscopy is used to investigate the detailed electrical properties of the PSCs. Impedance spectroscopy spectra are measured as a function of frequency (0.1–1000 kHz) with 0.8 V bias under dark conditions. The device with the incorporation of Cl-FACl presents an increased carrier recombination resistance (Rrec) (347.2 Ω cm2) than that of the control device (257.4 Ω cm2) (Fig. 6b). The increased Rrec is attributed to the crystallinity of the perovskite films and thus an efficient carrier transport process. The higher Rrec indicates efficient carrier separation and carrier injection and reduced carrier recombination at the perovskite film because of the improved grain size and crystallinity of the modified perovskite film.45,46

We have measured the light intensity dependence of Voc, which can provide more detailed information on recombination processes under open circuit conditions, according to the formula:47δVoc = n(kBT/e)ln(I) + Cwhere n is the ideality factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, e is the elementary charge, T is the absolute temperature, I is the light intensity and C is a constant. The device with Cl-FACl exhibits a higher Voc than the control device under different light intensities (Fig. 6c). A plot of Voc as a function of logarithmic light intensity [ln(I)] is linearly fitted to evaluate the slope n, which represents the recombination process caused by trap states in the optoelectronic devices. The slope values of nw and nwo are obtained for films with (w) and without (wo) Cl-FACl, respectively. The decreased slope indicates that devices with Cl-FACl can effectively reduce trap assisted carrier recombination.45,48

Fig. 7a displays the steady-state output of the devices while holding at their maximum power point (MPP) voltage under simulated AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) and measuring the photocurrent as a function of time. Steady-state output measurement demonstrates an increased stabilized output efficiency from 17.18% for the devices without Cl-FACl to 18.66% for the devices with Cl-FACl. To further assess the stability of the device doped with/without Cl-FACl, we prolong the test time of MPP conducted using a standard xenon lamp (Newport Oriel Sol3A solar simulator, 100 mW cm−2) without any UV-filter. For the device without Cl-FACl, the performance declines fast in a very short time. And the device with Cl-FACl presents more than 94% of its initial performance after testing for 600 minutes (Fig. 7b), which corresponds to the analysis of hysteresis.

Conclusions
In summary, we report Cl-FACl as a novel and effective Cl containing additive in perovskite solar cells. We have demonstrated that a tiny amount of Cl from the addition of Cl-FACl has been incorporated into the crystal lattice and the perovskite film quality is improved. Compared with the control films, the perovskite films with Cl-FACl exhibit lower defect density and longer TRPL decay time. For devices with an optimized concentration, a higher performance up to 20.36% is achieved with lower hysteresis compared with devices without Cl-FACl.
