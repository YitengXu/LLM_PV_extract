This supramolecular self-assembly strategy can not only effectively improve the light-harvesting ability of the devices but also effectively reduces electron recombination by preventing I3− of the electrolyte from penetrating into the TiO2 surface. The DSSC based on JH1 showed a PCE of 2.46%, with a Voc of 615 mV, Jsc of 6.54 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.18%. After supramolecular self-assembly, the Jsc and Voc of the device were greatly improved. Specifically for the device based on JH1 + P2, the PCE reached 4.39%, which is about 78% greater than the PCE of the device based on JH1; this is mainly due to the Jsc increase of 2.85 mA cm−2 and the Voc increase of 93 mV. Compared to co-sensitization, supramolecular self-assembly does not require tedious optimization steps; thus, this may be a promising and convenient way to improve the overall performance of DSSCs.
Introduction
It is well known that the world is facing an energy crisis and the search for new energy is imminent for mankind. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as a promising optoelectronic technology, have aroused the interest of many researchers owing to their low manufacturing costs and simple fabrication techniques.1,2 Since Grätzel et al. first reported DSSCs in 1991,3 there have been a series of key breakthroughs in power conversion efficiency (PCE). The initial PCE was only 7.1%; however, in 2015, Toru Yano et al. prepared the alxoxysilyl-anchor dye ADEKA-1 and it was found that the PCE of the DSSC based on ADEKA-1 and co-photosensitizer LEG4 reached up to 14.3%.4
As a wide band gap semiconductor with innocuity, stabilization and cheapness, TiO2 is one of the best materials for preparing the anodes of DSSCs; however, the absorption of light from the ultraviolet region is a major defect. The sensitizers play a very important role in improving the spectral response range and in initiating electron transfer. The development of efficient sensitizers is seen as one of the most direct and effective ways to improve the PCE of DSSCs.5–8 Up to now, many excellent dyes have been developed, the most important of these are ruthenium complexes, porphyrin dyes and metal-free organic dyes.9–12 Ruthenium complexes were studied earlier, among which N3 and N719 are both excellent high efficiency dyes. A great deal of work has been focused on improving these dyes; however, the expensive metal ruthenium limits the development of such dyes.13 Porphyrin dyes, which have excellent optical properties such as broad absorption at the Soret band (400–450 nm) and moderate absorption at the Q-bands (550–600 nm), have become one of the most studied sensitizers for DSSCs.14,15 The DSSC based on the porphyrin dye SM315 was shown to have a very high PCE of 13.0% as reported by Grätzel et al. in 2014.16 The organic dyes have been developed very rapidly in recent years with the cheap and easy to design features attracting increasing attention. Some excellent dyes such as SGT-137, C281, IQ21 and YA422 have been successfully prepared.17–21 However, most excellent dyes require complex synthetic steps and have low yield. It is well known that excellent light harvesting capability is an important prerequisite for efficient dyes. For single layer dyes, in order to achieve this goal, researchers have to design lengthy synthetic routes. Supramolecular self-assembly may be one of the more convenient ways to increase light harvesting capability.22–27 The porphyrins, phthalocyanines and ruthenium complexes are often used as building blocks for assembling supramolecular systems. Compared with the cosensitization method,28,29 supramolecular self-assembly can eliminate lengthy optimization steps and does not require suitable adsorption conditions. The conditions for cosensitization need to be carefully explored and many factors influence the final result, such as types of cosensitizers, cosensitization mode, cosensitization solvent and cosensitization time. In addition, competitive adsorption often occurs between the main dye and the cosensitizer. In contrast, supramolecular self-assembly is very easy to operate, which can be accomplished by metal coordination, H-bonding and so on. Moreover, this method does not reduce dye loading. Notably, the antenna unit of the supramolecular systems can not only improve the spectral response but also reduce charge recombination by their steric effect. Up to now, there are few reports related to this. Han et al. increased the PCE of the DSSC based on ZnPA by about 47% using this method.30
In this study, in order to investigate the influence of supramolecular systems on the performance of DSSCs, we prepared a basic D–π-A metal-free organic dye, JH1. In the donor of JH1, two pyridine groups were introduced, which can enhance the electron donating ability. In particular, the two pyridine groups can coordinate with many metal-complex chromophores. Herein, we used two porphyrin intermediates, P1 and P2 of YD2-o-C8, as antenna units to coordinate with triphenylamine dye JH1 containing pyridine groups (Fig. 1).14 The DSSC based on JH1 showed a PCE of 2.46%, with a Voc of 615 mV, a Jsc of 6.54 mA cm−2, and a FF of 61.18%. After supramolecular self-assembly, the overall performance of the device greatly improved. In particular to the DSSC based on JH1 + P2, the device showed a PCE of 4.39%, with a Voc of 708 mV and a Jsc of 9.39 mA cm−2. The supramolecular systems effectively improved the light harvesting capability of the device, so the Jsc increases from 6.54 to 9.39 mA cm−2. In addition, both P1 and P2 acted as antenna units, effectively preventing the I3− of the electrolyte from penetrating into the TiO2 surface, thereby reducing charge recombination and improving the Voc. The supramolecular self-assembly strategy is very beneficial in improving the overall performance of the DSSCs. We studied the optical properties and photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs based on the supramolecular systems.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The chemical structures and synthetic route of JH1, P1 and P2 are shown in Scheme S1.† The synthesis details and characterization data are shown in ESI.†
Optical properties
The absorption spectra of JH1, P1 and P2 in THF are shown in Fig. 2a. The D–π-A type dye JH1 shows an unsatisfactory spectral response; the highest molar extinction coefficient at 399 nm is 1.40 × 104 M−1 cm−1. The two zinc porphyrin chromophores, P1 and P2, exhibit typical porphyrin absorption characteristics. The absorption below 400 nm could be attributed to electronic transitions from π–π*, and the 400–650 nm range could be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). P1 shows a high molar extinction coefficient (2.00 × 105 M−1 cm−1) at 426 nm in the Soret band, and shows the molar extinction coefficient of 0.05 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 596 nm in the Q band. As compared to P1, the absorption spectra of P2 show a pronounced red shift. At 431 nm in the Soret band, P2 shows a high molar extinction coefficient of 2.04 × 105 M−1 cm−1, and the lowest-energy Q-band absorption of P2 was redshifted to 608 nm. After anchoring on the TiO2 substrate, the absorption spectra became broader (Fig. 2b). The ICT bands of JH1 showed a significant red shift and the spectral response exceeded 600 nm, which could be attributed to J-aggregation.31,32 After supramolecular self-assembly, the absorption spectra of JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 changed dramatically compared to JH1. Since P1 and P2 have no anchoring groups, the two chromophores could not be adsorbed on TiO2. We tried to immerse TiO2 into P1 and P2 solution for 24 h (Fig. S1†), but the absorption spectra showed no change (Fig. S2†).
 Fig. 2  (a) UV-Vis absorption spectra of JH1, P1 and P2 in THF, (b) UV-Vis absorption spectra of JH1, JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 anchored on the TiO2 surface. 
However, significant changes occurred on the surface of TiO2 when we immersed TiO2 that was sensitized with JH1 into P1 and P2 solution for 24 h (Fig. S3†). As shown in Fig. 2b, compared with JH1, the absorption spectra of JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 became broader and higher and their spectral responses are both over 650 nm. Such superior light harvesting capability improves the short-circuit current of the device. However, in the Soret band, we observed that the absorption intensity of JH1 + P1 is lower than that of JH1 + P2. In view of this, we further measured the dye loading under the same conditions. After supramolecular self-assembly, the dye loading for P1 is about 5.36 × 10−8 mol cm−2, and the dye loading for P2 is about 7.65 × 10−8 mol cm−2. The larger dye loading for P2 can compensate for the absorption ability; this could be the main reason for the difference in molar extinction coefficient between JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 in the Soret band.
Electrochemical studies
The cyclic voltammetry curves of JH1, JH1 + P1 and JH2 + P2 anchored on TiO2 were measured to study the property of electron transfer from excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2.33 As shown in Fig. S4,† we used a photoanode as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode. From Fig. 3, we can observe that the ground state oxidation potentials (EOX) of JH1, JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 are 1.19 V, 1.12 V and 1.15 V (versus NHE), respectively. Clearly, they are all more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple (0.4 V), which shows that the oxidized dyes can be effectively recycled.34,35 The zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) was estimated from their absorption spectra. The E0–0 values of JH1, JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 are 2.54 eV, 1.98 eV and 1.91 eV, respectively. Therefore, the excited oxidation potentials  of JH1, JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 are −1.35 V, −0.92 V and −0.80 V, respectively, all of which are more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V versus NHE). This illustrates that the electron from the excited dyes of JH1, JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 can be efficiently injected into the conduction band of TiO2.36

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
In order to investigate the photovoltaic property of the supramolecular systems, we fabricated the DSSCs based on JH1, JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 under the same conditions. The photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 1 and the photocurrent-density–photovoltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4a. The histogram of the PCE of the DSSCs is shown in Fig. S5.† The PCE of the DSSC based on JH1 is 2.46% with Voc of 615 mV, Jsc of 6.54 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.18%. In order to improve the overall performance of the DSSCs, we designed the pyridine groups of JH1 to coordinate with porphyrin chromophores P1 and P2. As expected, the Jsc and Voc of this type of supramolecular DSSCs were both successfully improved. Compared to JH1, the Jsc of the DSSC based on JH1 + P1 increased from 6.54 to 8.16 mA cm−2, which can be attributed to improvements in light harvesting capability. Surprisingly, the Voc was also greatly improved with the value increasing from 615 to 664 mV. We infer that the main reason for this increase was that the antenna units can effectively prevent the I3− of the electrolyte from penetrating into the TiO2 surface, thereby reducing charge recombination.37–39 When P2 was the antenna unit, the PCE of the device reached the highest value of 4.39%, which is about 78% higher compared with the PCE of the device based on JH1. Because P2 has better optical properties, the corresponding Jsc reached 9.39 mA cm−2. The supramolecular systems of JH1 + P2 may be more conducive to reducing electron recombination. It is well known that we can improve the Voc by increasing the electron injection rate or by reducing electron recombination, which may account for the increase in the Voc from 615 to 708 mV in the JH1 + P2 system.

To further analyse the differences in Jsc, we measured the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices (Fig. 4b). Light harvesting capability affects the Jsc. From Table 1 we can see that the Jsc of the DSSCs follows the order: JH1 < JH1 + P1 < JH1 + P2; this trend is consistent with the IPCE spectra of the devices. As shown in Fig. 4b, the IPCE curves of JH1 exhibited a narrower response range and the photocurrent generation is up to about 550 nm. In the visible region, the highest value of JH1 is only 49.7% at 405 nm. The introduction of P1 as an antenna unit on the donor segment improves the spectral response range of the device and, consequently, the Jsc is improved. The IPCE spectrum of JH1 + P1 is broader than that of JH1, although the values of JH1 + P1 are slightly lower than that of JH1 in the shortwave region. This may be due to a slight decrease of dye loading for JH1 during the supramolecular self-assembly process. However, the IPCE spectrum of JH1 + P1 is much higher than that of JH1 after 425 nm, which is attributed to the contribution of P1 in light harvesting performance. The photocurrent of JH1 + P1 generation is up to about 650 nm in the long-wave region and the value is about 16.3% at 596 nm. The device based on JH1 + P2 exhibits a broader and higher IPCE curve from the 400 to 650 nm range. In particular to the long-wave region, the value is about 29.5% at 615 nm, which is consistent with the Jsc of the DSSCs.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under dark conditions is often measured to study the electron recombination dynamics of the DSSCs. Under the same conditions (with the same electrode materials and electrolyte), the electron recombination rate has an important influence on the open-circuit voltage (Voc).40–43 In order to analyze the difference between the open-circuit voltages of the DSSCs, we measured the EIS under the applied voltage of −0.7 V and scanned from 105 to 1 Hz. The equivalent circuit is presented in Fig. 5c, where Rh in the high frequency range corresponds to the sheet resistance of FTO and the contact resistance between the FTO and TiO2; R1 and R2 in the high and middle frequency regions are assigned to charge transfer resistance at the Pt/electrolyte and TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively. Nyquist plots of DSSCs are shown in Fig. 5a, in which we can see two semicircles: the small semicircle corresponds to the transport resistance at the Pt/electrolyte and the large semicircle corresponds to the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. It is clear that the radius of the large semicircle of JH1 + P1 is larger than that of JH1. The significant enhancement of R2 for JH1 + P1 indicates that the supramolecular systems are effective in TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface modification, implying that the supramolecular systems effectively reduce the electron recombination rate. This also explains why the Voc of JH1 + P1 increased by 49 mV. In addition, the R2 of JH1 + P2 is larger than that of JH1 + P1, which shows that the P2 unit is more conducive to suppressing electron recombination, which is in agreement with the Voc of the DSSCs. In general, the longer electron lifetime represents the lower dark current, which improves the open-circuit voltage of the devices. We further analyzed the electron lifetimes of the devices by Bode phase plots (Fig. 5b). From Fig. 5b, the peak frequency (f) at the lower frequency region from the Bode phase plots and the electron lifetime (τ) can be calculated by τ = 1/(2πf).44,45 The Bode phase plots show that f of JH1, JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 is 16.5, 12.1 and 5.0 Hz, respectively. Thus, the corresponding electron lifetime value of JH1, JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 is 9.7, 13.2 and 31.8 ms, respectively. This also explains why the DSSCs based on JH1 + P2 have the highest Voc.

Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared a metal-free organic dye, JH1, containing pyridine groups and two porphyrin chromophores, P1 and P2. These porphyrin chromophores were successfully used as antenna units to coordinate with JH1. This supramolecular system exhibits superior performance in improving spectral response and reducing charge recombination. The PCE of the DSSC based on JH1 is only 2.46%. Interestingly, the PCE of DSSCs based on JH1 + P1 and JH1 + P2 reached 3.68% and 4.39%, respectively. After supramolecular self-assembly, the light-harvesting ability was improved, particularly for JH1 + P2, and the Jsc increased from 6.54 to 9.39 mA cm−2. In addition, the supramolecular system can effectively prevent I3− of the electrolyte from penetrating into the TiO2 surface, thereby reducing the charge recombination and improving the Voc. The Voc of the DSSC based on JH1 + P2 increased by 93 mV compared with that of the DSSC based on JH1. In particular, compared with co-sensitization, the DSSCs based on supramolecular self-assembly do not require lengthy optimization steps; thus, this could be a promising and convenient method to improve the performance of DSSCs.
