    , Accepted 14th October 2018First published on 16th October 2018AbstractMonolayer indium triphosphide (InP3) is a newly predicted 2D material with a quasi-direct electronic band gap which is predicted to exhibit fascinating adsorption efficiency, foreshadowing its potential applications in the photovoltaic and optoelectronic communities. To achieve a combination of photovoltaic and thermoelectric technologies and further boost the energy utilization rate, in this paper we systematically investigate the thermal and thermoelectric properties through combining first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. Our calculations show that the average lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer InP3 is about 0.63 W mK−1 at room temperature, which is comparable to that of classical thermoelectric materials. Such a poor phonon transport property mainly originates from its smaller group velocity and stronger phonon–phonon scattering (including both scattering magnitude and channels). Unlike the isotopic phonon transport property, the electronic conductivity and electronic thermal conductivity of monolayer InP3 present obvious anisotropic behavior. Meanwhile, a high Seebeck coefficient is also predicted in monolayer InP3 with both n- and p-type doping due to the large electronic band gap and sharp increase in electronic conductivity. By using the electron relaxation time estimated from deformation potential theory, the room temperature thermoelectric figure of merit of monolayer InP3 is found to be as high as 2.06 (with p-type doping) and 0.61 (with n-type doping) along the armchair and zigzag directions, which are substantially larger than for black phosphorene (ZT ∼ 0.4 at room temperature). The results presented in this work shed light on the thermoelectric performance of monolayer InP3 and qualify its potential application in a multifunction device that contains both photovoltaic and thermoelectric technologies.
Introduction
Photovoltaic technology that could convert solar energy directly into electrical power is one of the most promising approaches to solving current energy and environmental crises.1–3 However, this technology is currently confronted with two key bottlenecks: i.e., high production cost and low power converting efficiency.1–3 For example, the efficiency of present photovoltaic materials is a mere 20%, while the rest of the 80% of solar energy is transformed into heat energy accumulated in the photovoltaic devices and lost to the environment. Thermoelectric technology that could potentially convert some low-grade waste heat into electricity is another pollution-free energy conversion approach, but also possesses two disadvantages analogous to those of photovoltaic technology.4–6 In the past few years, a great deal of effort has been put into improving their performance and reducing their production cost.2,6 These works focus mainly on single technology enhancement. There are a few pieces of work which pay attention to combining these two technologies and forming a multifunction device. This kind of multifunction device might provide another feasible way to boost the energy utilization rate and increase the economical applicability. To achieve such a device, it is desirable to seek materials, especially thin-film materials, that have high photoelectric conversion efficiency and a large thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) at the same time.
Triggered by the realization of graphene, research into two-dimensional (2D) functional materials has recently become one of hottest topics in materials science and condensed matter physics.7–9 Unfortunately, graphene and its derived nanostructures are undesirable photovoltaic and thermoelectric materials, which is mainly due to its zero (small) band gap9 and extremely high thermal conductivity.10 After that, various 2D nanomaterials have been proposed theoretically and synthesized experimentally, e.g., hexagonal boron nitride,11,12 silicene,11 borophene,13,14 black phosphorene,15,16 and a large family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides.17–19 However, few of these 2D materials are suitable candidates for achieving a multifunction device which contains both photovoltaic and thermoelectric technologies. This is because this kind of device requires materials possessing a series of unique physical characters. To be a high-performance photovoltaic device, the materials should have a direct or quasi-direct energy band structure with a bandgap of about 1.3 eV (according to the optimal Shockley–Queisser limit). To be an excellent thermoelectric device, the materials should be semiconductors with a high Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity, and low thermal conductivity.
Recently, a new layered material, indium triphosphide (InP3), which could be prepared from its bulk form by utilizing mechanical cleavage or liquid phase exfoliation approaches, has been predicted by Miao et al.20 They find that monolayer InP3 is a quasi-direct bandgap semiconductor (the bandgap is about 1.14 eV) with a high electron mobility of 1919 cm2 V−1 s−1. Meanwhile its magnetism and electronic transport properties could be effectively modulated by introducing doping atoms and applying an external strain. More interestingly, unlike diamond silicon (d-Si) and other 2D materials which could absorb light efficiently over a very narrow range of wavelengths, monolayer InP3 is revealed to exhibit extraordinary light harvesting ability over the entire range of the visible solar spectrum from 380 to 750 nm.20 Such an outstanding optical character is comparable to that of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),21 which foreshadows its potential application in photovoltaic solar cells and optoelectronic devices. In consideration of its fascinating optical and electronic properties, it is natural to ask whether this new layered material also possesses a superior thermoelectric performance. How high could the thermal conductivity and thermoelectric figure of merit reach? In order to achieve the combination of photovoltaic and thermoelectric technologies and further improve the energy conversion efficiency, exploring the thermal and thermoelectric properties of this new kind of 2D system is quite urgent and desirable.
Inspired by these integrated needs, in this work, we systematically investigate the phononic and electronic transport properties of monolayer InP3 by means of first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory. Our calculations show that monolayer InP3 has intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity and a high Seebeck coefficient. Based on the predicted electron relaxation time, the thermoelectric figure of merit of monolayer InP3 is found to approach 2.06 (with p-type doping at room temperature) or 0.61 (with n-type doping at room temperature) along the armchair and zigzag directions. This value could even exceed 3.0 in the medium temperature region (500 K, along the armchair direction with n-type doping), suggesting that monolayer InP3 is a promising candidate for realizing a multifunction device containing both photovoltaic and thermoelectric characteristics at the same time. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we give a brief description of the computational details of the first-principles and transport coefficients calculations. In the third section, we present the phononic and electronic transport properties of monolayer InP3. Moreover, based on these transport coefficients and the estimated electron relaxation time from deformation potential theory, the thermoelectric figure of merit of monolayer InP3 is predicted. Finally, our discussions and concluding remarks are summarized in the fourth section.
Computational details
In this paper, first-principles calculations are performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT), as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP).22 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof parameterization (PBE) is applied as the exchange–correlation potential.23 The kinetic energy cut-off of the plane-wave basis is set at 400 eV, and the Brillouin zones of the primitive cell of monolayer InP3 are sampled with Monkhorst–Pack k-meshes of 15 × 15 × 1. The internal coordinates and lattice constants are fully optimized through the conjugate gradient algorithm until the maximum Hellman–Feynman force on each atom is smaller than 1 × 10−5 eV Å−1. To avoid interlayer interactions under the periodic boundary condition, a large vacuum spacing of 20 Å is constructed perpendicular to the layer plane of monolayer InP3. Meanwhile, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE-06)24 screened hybrid functional is also employed to obtain a more accurate energy band structure for monolayer InP3. Based on the results of the electronic structure, corresponding electronic transport properties can be obtained through utilizing the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory25 with the constant scattering time approximation (CSTA), as implemented in BoltzTrap.26 Such a method has achieved good agreement between theoretical calculations and experiments for several thermoelectric materials.26–29 To obtain reliable electronic transport coefficients, a denser Monkhorst–Pack k-mesh in the first Brillouin zone of monolayer InP3 is used.
The phonon transport properties are evaluated by means of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (PBTE), as implemented in the ShengBTE package30 with harmonic second-order interatomic force constants (2nd IFCs) and anharmonic third-order IFCs (3rd IFCs) as inputs. The phonon dispersions and 2nd IFCs of monolayer InP3 are calculated by using VASP and PHONONPY packages31 with a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell. The corresponding numbers of the k-mesh are accordingly scaled down compared with the case of primitive cell calculation. The anharmonic 3rd IFCs, including the information about phonon–phonon scattering, are calculated using same supercell. As for the interaction cutoff of 3rd IFCs, we have done the self-consistent test on the Grüneisen parameters (the results can be seen in Fig. S1 in the ESI†). One finds that the Grüneisen parameters obviously change when the interaction cutoff is short (<third nearest neighbors), while it stays almost unchanged when the cutoff is larger than fourth nearest neighbors. Therefore, taking into consideration of the computational accuracy and time-consuming nature of the calculation, the sixth nearest neighbors are chosen as the interaction cutoff for the third-order force constant in the following work. Taking the symmetry of monolayer InP3 into consideration, the total number of displacements is 392. Meanwhile, the Lagrangian multiplier method is used to enforce the translational invariance constraint of 3rd IFCs32 (details can be found in the ESI†). Here, a dense phonon q-grid of 51 × 51 × 1 is used to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer InP3, and good convergence has been achieved (see the inset of Fig. 4). In this work, 4.16 Å (considering the van der Waals radius) is used as the nominal thickness of monolayer InP3.
Results and discussion
As illustrated in Fig. 1, monolayer InP3 is a hexagonal lattice structure with space group Pm1 (no. 164). The optimized lattice constant of monolayer InP3 is 7.5646 Å, which is in excellent agreement with a previous theoretical prediction.20 Starting from such a fully relaxed structure, the phonon dispersion and phonon density of state (PDOS) of monolayer InP3 can be obtained via solving the eigenvalues of harmonic 2nd IFCs. From Fig. 2(a) one can see that no imaginary phonon modes are observed in the phonon dispersion of monolayer InP3. The maximum frequency of the optical phonon modes reaches about 13.46 THz, which is comparable to that of black phosphorene.33 This implies that this 2D InP3 structure is thermodynamically stable and the bonding is as strong as that in black phosphorene. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 2(b), partial PDOS of phosphorus (P) and indium (In) atoms in monolayer InP3 share a uniform distribution in the low-frequency region, which further demonstrates that the P and In atoms form a quite stable lattice structure. This is mainly originates from the strongly overlapping electron states (covalent bonds) between the P and In atoms (see Fig. 1(c)).20 Each primitive cell of monolayer InP3 consists of six P atoms and two In atoms, indicating that the corresponding phonon dispersion possesses three acoustic phonon branches and twenty-one optical phonon branches. At the Γ point, the lowest three phonon branches in Fig. 2(a) are acoustic phonon modes, i.e., the out-of-plane flexural acoustic mode (labeled ZA), the in-plane transverse acoustic mode (labeled TA), and the longitudinal acoustic mode (labeled LA). Among the three acoustic phonon modes, one feature at first glance is that the ZA phonon mode presents a quadratic dispersion with respect to the wave vector around the Γ point. This is a general characteristic of 2D materials and is attributed mainly to the rapid decay of the transversal force.34,35 Moreover, it can also be seen from Fig. 2(a) that there is serious mixing among the phonon modes of monolayer InP3, especially the acoustic and optical phonon modes in the low-frequency region. This behavior plays a significant role in determining the thermal transport properties of monolayer InP3 and will be explored in the following discussion.

To show the characteristics of the phonon modes directly, some typical lattice vibrations of monolayer InP3 at the Γ point are depicted in Fig. 3. The phonon modes presented in Fig. 3(a) from left to right represent the vibration of three acoustic phonons (ZA, TA, and LA respectively). However, one should also note that the direction of vibration of these three acoustic phonon modes is not strictly along the in-plane (TA and LA) or out-of-plane (ZA). This is mainly caused by the intrinsic bulk geometric structure of monolayer InP3, which has also been found in silicene36 and black phosphorene.33 The other phonon modes shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c) have optical features: i.e., the P or In atoms move in opposite directions to the other atoms. Moreover, an interesting characteristic phonon mode is seen at 1.91 THz. In this mode, the P atoms stay fixed, while the In atoms have an out-of-plane counter phase motion with respect to the neighboring In atoms. Analogous phonon modes where In atoms stay fixed and P atoms move in opposite directions can also be found at 2.79, 12.89, and 13.46 THz. On considering their bond-stretching character, these unique phonon modes in monolayer InP3 are likely to be observed experimentally.

Based on the 2nd IFCs and 3rd IFCs, the lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer InP3 can be calculated by solving the PBTE, and the results are depicted in Fig. 4. One finds that the lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer InP3 decreases as temperature increases, typically following a 1/T dependence. This is a common behavior exhibited in the lattice thermal conductivity of crystalline materials, which is mainly attributed to the intrinsic enhancement in phonon–phonon scattering with temperature. Unlike the obvious anisotropic thermal conductivity in black phosphorene,33,37 it should be noted that the thermal transport property of monolayer InP3 presents an inconspicuous anisotropy, where the lattice thermal conductivity along the armchair direction is only marginally higher than that along the zigzag direction. This could be understood from their almost equivalent group velocity shown in Fig. 4(b) (Γ to M in reciprocal space represents the armchair direction) and Fig. 4(c) (Γ to K in reciprocal space represents the zigzag direction). The room temperature lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer InP3 is 0.61 W mK−1 and 0.65 W mK−1 along the armchair and zigzag directions respectively, which are significantly lower than those of black phosphorene (about 40–120 W mK−1 along different crystal directions)33,37,38 and blue phosphorene (about 80 W mK−1).37 The average lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer InP3 (0.63 W mK−1) is comparable to that of classical thermoelectric materials, e.g., lead chalcogenides, bismuth-tellurium, and tin selenide.39,40 Such low lattice thermal conductivity implies that monolayer InP3 might be a promising candidate for thermoelectrics.

The inset of (a) denotes the dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer InP3 on the phonon q-grid (300 K). 
To identify the underlying mechanism of such ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity, in Fig. 5, we extract the phonon mode properties (frequency-dependent group velocities (v) and phonon relaxation time (τ)) of monolayer InP3 according to the definition of thermal conductivity , where V and ci are the crystal volume of the primitive cell and mode heat capacity. The data of phonon modes of black phosphorene is also plotted for comparison. It is evident that the group velocity of monolayer InP3 is considerably lower than that of black phosphorene. For instance, at a long-wavelength limit the group velocities of TA and LA of monolayer InP3 are about 3.12 and 5.86 km s−1 respectively, while they are about 4.03 and 8.27 km s−1 for black phosphorene.33 This mainly stems from the small cutoff frequency of the acoustic phonon branches (about 3.35 and 5.81 THz for monolayer InP3 and black phosphorene) and more flat bands existing in the phonon dispersion. This is one reason for the low lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer InP3. Moreover, as we mentioned above, the acoustic and optical phonon branches of monolayer InP3 are mixed together in the low-frequency region. This behavior makes the requirements for energy and quasi-momentum conservation for phonon–phonon scattering easier, and thus leads to an enhancement in the three phonon phase space of monolayer InP3 (see the inset of Fig. 5(a)). On the other hand, owing to the inset of In atoms, the P–P bond lengths and angles of monolayer InP3 are distorted compared to those of black phosphorene, which will give rise to stronger anharmonic scattering when phonons are transported through this system (demonstrated from the mode weighted accumulative Grüneisen parameter (MWGP) shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a)). Because of the enhancement in phonon scattering strength and phase space, from Fig. 5(b) one can easily see that compared with black phosphorene, a distinct reduction in phonon relaxation time is also observed over the entire frequency region for monolayer InP3. This is another reason for the low lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer InP3.

The inset of (a) is the three phonon phase space (P3, magnitude 10−3) and mode weighted accumulative Grüneisen parameter (MWGP) of monolayer InP3 and black phosphorene at room temperature (300 K). 
The electronic transport properties, e.g., Seebeck coefficient S, electronic conductivity σ, and electronically contributed thermal conductivity κe, are indispensible for evaluating the thermoelectric performance of monolayer InP3. In this paper, these electronic transport coefficients are calculated through solving the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation with a constant scattering time approximation.25 Meanwhile, the rigid band approximation is utilized to simulate the doping effects on electronic transport.26 In this approximation the electronic structure is assumed to be unchanged and only the Fermi level is shifted to change the doping level, which is a reasonable and common treatment method used in previous first-principles thermoelectric calculations.27–29 In Fig. 6, we firstly plot the electronic band structure of monolayer InP3 obtained from the PBE potential and HSE-06 hybrid functional potential. One can see clearly that the two different potentials show an analogous trend in electronic band structure. Both PBE and HSE-06 potential calculation show that monolayer InP3 is a quasi-direct bandgap semiconductor. The conduction band minimum (CBM) is at the Γ point, while the valence band maximum (VBM) is located between the Γ point and the M point, which is a little higher in energy than the Γ point. The calculated electronic bandgap of monolayer InP3 is 0.61 eV based on the PBE potential and increases to 1.2 eV based on the accurate HSE-06 hybrid functional potential, which is in good agreement with the previous theoretical prediction.20 Accordingly, we use this hybrid functional potential to describe the electronic transport properties of monolayer InP3 in our following simulation.

Fig. 7 shows the electronic conductivity with respect to the scattering time σ/τ, Seebeck coefficient S, and electronic thermal conductivity with respect to the scattering time κe/τ of monolayer InP3 as a function of chemical potential at three typical temperatures (T = 300, 500, and 700 K). It should be noted here that the negative chemical potential implies p-type doping (simulated by shifting the Fermi level into the valence bands), and the positive chemical potential means n-type doping (simulated by the shifting the Fermi level into the conduction bands). Unlike the indistinct anisotropic lattice thermal conductivity shown in Fig. 4, one can see from the first layer of Fig. 7 that the electronic conductivity of monolayer InP3 displays a distinctive anisotropic behavior where the conductivity along the zigzag direction is obviously larger than that along the armchair direction. Meanwhile, it can also be found that the electronic conductivity along the armchair direction shares almost the same value as both n- and p-type doping, while n-type doping has better electronic conductivity than p-type in the zigzag direction of monolayer InP3. This can be qualitatively understood from the different electronic energy bands along the armchair (Γ to M in reciprocal space) and zigzag (Γ to K in reciprocal space) directions presented in Fig. 6. As the temperature increases, the conductivity around the VBM and CBM is improved slightly and the peaks are gradually flattened since the electrons obey a Fermi–Dirac distribution. Based on Mott's relation, the Seebeck coefficient depends on the logarithmic derivative of electronic conductivity.41 Although the electronic conductivity of monolayer InP3 presents an anisotropic phenomenon, the logarithmic derivative of conductivity (the first conductivity peak around the VBM and CBM) is almost the same magnitude. Therefore, one can see from the second layer of Fig. 7 that the Seebeck coefficient of monolayer InP3 along the armchair and zigzag directions possesses the same value: i.e., they are isotropic. At room temperature (300 K), the maximum value of the Seebeck coefficient of monolayer InP3 with p(n)-type doping is about 2.0(1.95) mV K−1. With an increase in temperature, the Seebeck coefficient of monolayer InP3 decreases as the temperature increases from 300 K to 700 K due to the reduction in the slope of electronic conductivity around the VBM and CBM. Similar to the electronic conductivity, the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity of monolayer InP3 also possesses an evident anisotropic phenomenon and increases gradually as temperature increases, as shown in the third layer of Fig. 7. This can be explained from the fact that thermal conductivity contributed by electrons is proportional to the electronic conductivity via the Wiedemann–Franz law: κe = LσT, where L (L = 1.5 × 10−8 W Ω K−2) is the Lorenz number.42,43

Based on the phononic and electronic transport properties presented above, we could estimate the thermoelectric figure of merit of monolayer InP3. The electronic relaxation time τ is taken from ref. 20 and obtained from deformation potential theory. Meanwhile, the electron relaxation time always obeys a reciprocal relationship with temperature:6i.e., τ ∝ 1/T. Thus, the electron relaxation times at different temperatures could be attained (as listed in Table 1). Fig. 8 depicts the calculated thermoelectric figure of merit of monolayer InP3 as a function of chemical potential along the armchair and zigzag directions at three typical temperatures. It is found that the thermoelectric figure of merit exhibits different behaviors along different directions. In the zigzag direction, the figure of merit with n-type doping is obviously superior to that with p-type doping. In the armchair direction, the figure of merit with p-type doping is better than that with n-type doping at low temperature (300 K), while it smaller than the latter case at high temperature. No matter the kind of doping, the thermoelectric figure of merit of monolayer InP3 along the armchair direction is generally superior to that along the zigzag direction, which originates mainly from the larger electronic relaxation time. As temperature increases, the figure of merit increases monotonously and the corresponding chemical potential of the peak figure of merit shifts to the low-energy region (absolute value). The peak thermoelectric figure of merit of monolayer InP3 along the armchair and zigzag directions at three typical temperatures for both n- and p-type doping is summarized in Table 1. At 500 K, the thermoelectric figure of merit could approach 3.23(2.97) and 1.72(0.34) along the armchair and zigzag directions respectively with n(p)-type doping, which is substantially larger than that of black phosphorene (ZT is about 0.2–0.7 at 500 K).44–46 The results indicate that monolayer InP3 is indeed a promising candidate for good thermoelectric materials and will stimulate further experimental studies. It should be noted that, in this work, we mainly study the possibility of monolayer InP3 in the field of combining photovoltaic and thermoelectric technologies. Therefore, a high temperature is not necessary under these circumstances. In order to further demonstrate the thermal stability of monolayer InP3, taking 500 K as an example, we perform ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations with a 5 × 5 × 1 supercell. The results show that the puckered arsenic-type honeycomb networks are well maintained, and all the atoms in a monolayer InP3 cell are vibrating around their equilibrium positions during the simulations (see Fig. S2 of ESI†). This result demonstrates that the monolayer is stable at 500 K and is a promising candidate for achieving the combination of photovoltaic and thermoelectric technologies.

Considering the geometric and bonding characters of monolayer InP3, the n-type (p-type) doping of monolayer InP3 could be realized through substituting In (P) atoms with Si/Ge/Sn atoms. In order to compare directly with experiment, in Fig. 9, we plot the thermoelectric figure of merit as a function of carrier concentration of monolayer InP3. It can clearly be found that the corresponding concentration of the maximum figure of merit (500 K) of monolayer InP3 with n(p)-type doping is of the magnitude of 1019 cm−3 (1020 cm−3) along both armchair and zigzag directions. Such a low concentration (smaller than 0.001 per atom) will only shift the Fermi-level and have a weak influence on the electronic structure and phonon properties of InP3 (as shown in the ESI†).

Discussion and conclusions
We know that the relaxation time might exhibit a little difference when the electron locates in the band edges or within the bands. However, it is quite difficult to calculate the relaxation time within the valence or conduction bands from first-principles calculations. Therefore, in this work we utilize the electron relaxation time in the band edges to estimate the thermoelectric performance of monolayer InP3, which was also a common treatment in previous first-principles thermoelectric calculations. In order to investigate such influence on thermoelectric performance, we recalculate the room temperature figure of merit (ZT) of InP3 with different electron relaxation times. One can find from ESI (Fig. S4†) that although the relaxation time is reduced by half, the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of monolayer InP3 could still approach 1.51 (with p-type doping) or 0.44 (with n-type doping) along the armchair and zigzag directions. This result further demonstrates that monolayer InP3 is a competitive thermoelectric material.
Strain engineering is one of the most effective ways to tune the electronic and phononic transport properties of materials, especially 2D materials. Previous work has shown that the lattice thermal conductivity can be effectively reduced through applying tensile strain. The typical example is graphene nanoribbon (zigzag-edged), whose lattice thermal conductivity can be significantly suppressed from 475 W mK−1 to 110 W mK−1 when the tensile strain increases from 0% to 16%.47 Analogous results could also be observed in penta-graphene48 and black phosphorene.37 The electronic structure of 2D materials is also found to be quite sensitive to strain. For example, in group IV–VI monolayer materials and MoS2, the strain could induce band convergence, which gives rise to an enhancement in thermoelectric power.49,50 The electronic band gap of monolayer InP3 is also found to decrease gradually with either compressive or tensile strains.20 In view of the common characteristics among 2D materials, one could expect that strain is also a possible approach to modulate the thermoelectric performance of monolayer InP3. Moreover, the adsorption of impurity atoms in monolayer InP3 is also expected to be an effective method to decrease the lattice thermal conductivity and further improve the thermoelectric performance.
In summary, we systematically investigated the thermal and thermoelectric properties of a newly predicted 2D material, monolayer InP3, through using the reliable first-principles calculation, including both electronic and phononic parts. Our results show that monolayer InP3 possesses an intrinsically low phonon transport property. The lattice thermal conductivity is about 0.61 and 0.65 W mK−1 along the armchair and zigzag directions, which are comparable to previous classical thermoelectric materials. This mainly originates from the smaller group velocity and stronger phonon–phonon scattering (including scattering magnitude and channels) in monolayer InP3. Unlike the isotopic phonon transport property, the electronic conductivity and electronic thermal conductivity present an obvious anisotropic behavior. Meanwhile, a high Seebeck coefficient also exists in monolayer InP3 with both n- and p-type doping due to the large electronic band gap (about 1.2 eV) and sharp increases in electronic conductivity. Finally, by utilizing the electron relaxation time estimated from the deformation potential theory, the room temperature thermoelectric figure of merit of monolayer InP3 is found to be about 2.06 (with p-type doping) and 0.61 (with n-type doping) along the armchair and zigzag directions, which is substantially larger that of black phosphorene (ZT ∼ 0.4). This value could even exceed 3.0 in the medium temperature region (500 K, along the armchair direction with n-type doping). The results presented in this work shed light on the thermoelectric performance of monolayer InP3 and foreshadow its potential application in a multifunction device which contains both photovoltaic and thermoelectric technologies.
