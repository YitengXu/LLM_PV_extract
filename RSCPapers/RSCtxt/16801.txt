    , Accepted 2nd October 2014First published on 3rd October 2014AbstractThe synthesis of multi-scale SnS nanostructures with favorable fluorescence is facilely accomplished via a well-excogitated gentle process, involving simple precursors, stabilized chemical medium and primitive ligand exchange. The fabricated SnS nanocrystals can be adopted as hole transporting materials in photovoltaic devices for enhancing its power conversion efficiency.
The need for the efficient utilization of renewable energy continues to fuel new research in the field of photovoltaic material synthesis. In this respect, SnS nanocrystals (NCs), as an archetypal IV–VI group semiconductor that exhibits both p-type and n-type conduction and prominent electro-optic activity, appear to be bright prospects. Recently, various synthetic methodologies have been conducted to produce SnS nanostructures, including 0-D (spherical particles),1 1-D (nanorods or nanotubes),2 2-D (nanosheets or nanoplates),3 and 3-D (nanoflowers)4 geometries. Although this appears to be impressive, to date the fabrication of SnS nanowires (NWs) with diameter less than 10 nm are still sparse. In addition, although multifarious SnS nanostructures have been developed, most of the synthesis protocols toward 1-D NCs appear to be tedious and complex, involving handling at high temperatures.5 The drawbacks are also created from required the toxic and expensive raw materials such as organometallic precursors (e.g. Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2) and (e.g. carbon disulfide),6 which also limit their practical application. Therefore, an exploration toward an alternative gentle protocol for multi-scale SnS nanostructures, integrating favorable cost-effectiveness, energy economy and environmentally friendly characteristics, is urgently demanded.
Intrigued by many encouraging results of SnS production, their viable application in photovoltaic cells (PVCs) has become a strong current interest.7 As noted, the first demonstration of PVC based on TiO2/SnS films was reported by Wang et al., which demonstrated that the addition of SnS results in better PVC performance.8 The incorporation of SnS NCs into inorganic or hybrid polymer contained heterojunction PV cells was also conducted by Stavrinadis et al. and Wang et al.9 These are all inspiring developments. Although they have a great deal of potential promise, one remarkable fact that needs to be identified is that the reported PVCs with SnS blended in the active layer have only slight enhancements in power conversion efficiency (PCE). In particular, the research for adoption of SnS NCs as transport materials in photoelectric devices still remains sparse.
Inspired from the aforementioned issues, it is highly desirable to devise a strategy with proper programming to fabricate high-performance SnS nanostructures, as well as optimize the functional characteristics of the NCs in the PVC structure, in an effort to achieve high performance. In this case, a robust and relatively gentle hydrothermal protocol was successfully devised to fabricate multi-scale SnS nanostructures. The implemented protocol involves chemical medium control with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) stabilizer and ligand exchange with versatile chemicals substitute for the initially used oleic acid (OA) ligand. By virtue of ligand exchange, the generation of multi-structured SnS nanocrystals (NCs), including 0-D quantum dots (QDs), nanoparticles (NPs), 1-D nanoworms (NWMs) and nanowires (NWs) was facilely accomplished. The acquired SnS nanostructures have representative orthorhombic SnS structure and bright photoluminescence with high quantum yield (QY). A substantial improvement of PVC performance using the resulting SnS NCs as a hole transporting layer (HTL) was further achieved with an increase of voltage as well as with the ascension of work function. With the adoption of SnS HTL, the PVC device yields a 43% enhancement in PCE compared to the reference device.
The robust programming protocol devised involves two crucial steps: (i) The vigorous emulsifying of green precursor with PVP medium as stabilizer and OA as initial functional ligand. (ii) The implementation of versatile chemical substitutes for the OA ligand for obtaining multi-nanostructures. With the goal to evaluate the influence of substitutional ligands on the morphological features of SnS NCs, miscellaneous chemicals, including trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), dodecyl mercaptan (DDM), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), dodecylamine (DDA) and triethylamine (TEA) were adopted. For comparison, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement was conducted. From the TEM image in Fig. 1a, the control sample with uniform dispersed SnS QDs can be identified to have a narrow size distribution with a mean diameter of 3.66 nm and standard deviation of 9.8% (±0.36 nm, histogram in Fig. 1a and Table S1†). Detectable dot-rings in the selected-area electron-diffraction (SAED) pattern revealed the crystalline structure of the control sample (Fig. S1†). Well-resolved lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.32 nm were observed from the HRTEM image (inset in Fig. 1a), which can be matched to the (012) plane of orthorhombic SnS. However, with TOPO and DDM as substitutional ligands, NPs with larger mean diameters of 5.14 ± 0.73 nm and 9.15 ± 1.01 nm were also synthesized (Fig. 1b and c). A high crystallinity and lattice spacing of 0.36 nm and 0.34 nm can be clearly observed for TOPO and DDM capped NPs from the inset HRTEM images, which are close to the (120) and (021) diffraction facets of SnS, respectively.
 Fig. 1  TEM and HRTEM images of SnS nanocrystals synthesized with (A) initial OA, (B) TOPO, (C) DDM, (D) NAC and (E) DDA as ligands respectively, and (F) SnO/SnS nanobelts using TEA as capping ligand. Insets in Fig. 1A–D are the corresponding size distribution of the SnS nanocrystals. 
Moreover, TEM reveals that the NAC-capped SnS has elongated, anisotropic NWMs morphology with a length 8.78 ± 1.30 nm (histogram inset in Fig. 1d), but it is more poly-dispersed with an average width of 3.84 nm. The HRTEM inset in Fig. 1d shows an apparent NWM with the (120) planes of d = 0.34 nm. Surprisingly, DDA-functionalized SnS NCs show NWs morphology with widths of about 3.80 nm and lengths up to micrometer scale (Fig. 1e). The NCs with oriented lattice fringes of 0.36 nm interplanar spacing indicates the crystallinity of the SnS NWs.
From TEM images, the width of NAC-capped NWMs and DDA-functionalized NWs can be seen to be almost unchanged in comparison with the controlled SnS QDs, indicating the anisotropic assembly of SnS along a defined crystal face. As reported, the organic amine chemicals may promote the anisotropic growth of nanoparticles.10 When TOPO or DDM is employed, the monomer activity (or activity coefficient) is high, and many nuclei are shaped at the nucleation stage. The depletion of monomers immediately occurs at the growth stage and, as a result, elongated shapes cannot be formed (Scheme 1). Contrastingly, the strong electron-donating ligands of acid amides or amines would be expected to bind to monomers as coligands and decrease the monomer activity. When NAC or DDA is added, the monomer activity would be expected to decrease at the nucleation stage and then increase at the growth stage because of their sufficient ligand protection. Consequently, elongated growth becomes favorable. Moreover, the bonding strength and steric effect of ligands can also affect the reactivity of monomers and determine the shape evolution of nanocrystals.11 Due to the stronger electron-donating ability and the steric effect originating from longer alkyl chains, the presence of DDA would further decrease the monomer activity at the nucleation stage, facilitating the formation of a longer nanowire morphology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for the fabrication of SnS NWs with a diameter less than 10 nm via hydrothermal process. Moreover, our work provides a method to simply synthesize multi-structure SnS products, including 0-D QDs and NPs, 1-D NWMs and NWs, by primitively changing capping ligands, indicating the effectiveness and simplicity of this programmed hydrothermal protocol.

An unanticipated result of SnO/SnS nanocrystals with nanobelts (NBs) morphology was also generated using TEA as the capping ligand. The NBs morphology interpreted in Fig. 1f reveals a width of about 3.18 nm and lengths of tens of nanometers. The inset in Fig. 1f shows the HRTEM images of one belt, in which the lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.34 nm matched the (201) plane of SnS nanocrystals. The elemental composition of the SnO/SnS nanobelts was confirmed by energy-dispersed X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Fig. 2a) and rare sulfur element content can be found (Sn:S = 1.02:0.13), which is significantly different from the SnS NCs. For instance, the atomic ratio of Sn/S of 1.27:1.25 for NAC-functionalized NWMs was determined to be near-stoichiometric (Fig. 2a).

(C) PXRD pattern of the typical SnS NWMs. The peaks in the curve correspond to the standard data of JCPDS no. 75-1803. Insets are the (001), (100) and (010) plane structures of the orthorhombic SnS unit cell with pbnm symmetry. The yellow atoms represent sulfur, whereas the ultramarine atoms represent tin. (D) PXRD pattern of the TEA-capped SnO/SnS NBs, showing that most peaks are matched to JCPDS no. 06-0395. 

Fig. 2b depicts the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the versatile samples. From the PXRD patterns, we can observe that the peaks of NCs capped with initial OA and substitutional DDM, TOPO, NAC and DDA ligands correspond well to the SnS powder diffraction patterns (Table S2†), whereas most of the peaks of the TEA-functionalized NCs correspond to the SnO patterns. In more detail, the XRD pattern of NAC-functionalized SnS NWMs shown in Fig. 2c can be indexed to the orthorhombic SnS structure with lattice constants of a = 4.33(4) Å, b = 11.20(0) Å and c = 3.98(7) Å (JCPDS no. 75-1803, space group pbnm). The inset in Fig. 2c depicts the representative (100), (001) and (001) planes of a model orthorhombic SnS cell with pbnm symmetry. Contrastingly, most of the diffraction features in the TEA functionalized NC pattern can be matched to the tetragonal SnO structure (a = 3.80(2) Å, b = 3.80(2) Å, c = 4.83(6) Å JCPDS no. 06-0395, space group P4/nmm) and SnS impurities (a = 11.18(0) Å, b = 3.98(2) Å, c = 4.32(9) Å JCPDS no. 73-1859, space group pnma) are also present in the sample (Fig. 2d), indicating that most NCs were oxidized. These results along with the above EDX analysis further verify the formation of SnO/SnS composites.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also performed to clarify the elemental composition and valence states of tin and sulfur in SnS NCs. Fig. 3a indicates the survey spectrum of SnS NWMs, which confirms the existence of C, N, Sn, S and O. The existence of O may be introduced by the oxidization of samples and contamination during the characterization. Fig. 3b and 3c show the high resolution spectra of Sn 3d and S 2p. The binding energy of Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 are 496.5 eV and 488.1 eV respectively, suggesting the Sn(II) form. In addition, the peak at 165.7 eV in Fig. 3c can be assigned to the binding energy of S 2p. The elemental composition of the nanocrystals is corroborated to be 42:39 Sn:S, which is basically in line with the EDX result, and further confirms the near-stoichiometric composition of SnS.

(D) PL spectra of SnS NWMs at different excitation wavelengths (in 20 nm increments starting from 300 nm to 480 nm). Insets are the images of SnS NWMs solution under daylight and UV lamp (λex = 365 nm). 
More interestingly, the acquired SnS NCs display intriguing optical properties and an excitation dependent feature is detected, in which the PL peak shifts to longer wavelengths with the increment of excitation wavelength (Fig. S2–S5†). For instance, the emission peaks of typical SnS NWMs exhibit a red shift from 439 nm to 527 nm gradually following the excitation wavelength increase from 300 nm to 480 nm (Fig. 3d and S3†). Under UV illumination (λ = 365 nm), the SnS NWMs solution displays bright blue fluorescence with the maximum emission band at 450 nm (inset in Fig. 3d). With quinine sulfate in 0.10 M H2SO4 solution as standard (Φ = 0.54), the quantum yield (QY) of the SnS NWMs without any surface treatment was determined to be 5.82% (Table S3†), which is comparable to the traditional II–VI semiconductor nanomaterials. It should be noted that there are very few reports for the fabrication of SnS NCs with bright photoluminescence as well as multiple emission colors under different excitation wavelengths. We here present multi-structured SnS NCs with tunable emissions, which might facilitate the potential employment of SnS NCs as emitting centers or labels in optoelectronics.
Following the successful fabrication of SnS NCs, further exploration toward potential application in PVCs was conducted. Fig. 4a depicts the schematic diagram of the ITO/SnS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al PVC structure incorporating SnS NWMs as the hole transporting layer (HTL). The thickness of the SnS NWMs and P3HT:PCBM layers estimated by the alpha-SE™ spectroscopic ellipsometer were ∼50 nm and 120 nm, respectively. To illustrate the effect of SnS HTL on the device performance, a reference PVC of ITO/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al without a transporting layer was also fabricated. The J–V characteristics measurement shown in Fig. 4b demonstrates that the Voc dramatically increased from 0.25 to 0.37 V with the incorporation of SnS HTL and shows the accompanying descent of Jsc from 9.18 to 7.96 mA cm−2. A lower leakage current was found for the SnS incorporated PVC (Fig. 4c), indicating the small probability of electron–hole recombination in the SnS HTL. In addition, the fill factor (FF) of the PVC with SnS HTLs is larger than that without HTLs, whereas the series resistances (Rs) of the two PV cells remain almost identical. This is consistent with the parameters summarized in Table 1, in which the increase of fill factor (FF) from 48% to 53% is displayed. The IPCE spectra of the relative devices were also measured (Fig. 4d) and the trends in the spectra were found to be consistent with the variation of Jsc shown in Fig. 4b. From all the results, we found that despite the slight decline of Jsc, the significant improvement of Voc and FF with the adoption of SnS HTL still results in the enhancement of PCE from 1.10% to 1.57% (raised by 43%), which is profound for their application in optoelectronic devices as hole transporting layers.

To understand the influence of the SnS NWMs, electronic structures at the SnS/P3HT:PCBM interface were examined by UPS measurements. Fig. 4e displays the zoom-in plots of the secondary electron cutoff (left panel) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) regions (right panel) of Hel UPS spectra for SnS NWMs, P3HT:PCBM blend and the blend on SnS substrates, respectively. Vertical bars in the right panel of Fig. 4e mark the HOMO edges of the corresponding films. The work function of the SnS NWMs extracted from UPS spectra is about 4.4 eV and the HOMO edge is at 2.7 eV below EF. Following SnS incorporation, the UPS spectra of the P3HT:PCBM blend show a slight shift towards higher binding energy, indicating the EF movement within the energy gap towards the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The HOMO edge of the pristine P3HT blend or the blend on the SnS layer is estimated to be 0.2 or 0.3 eV below EF, respectively, whereas the HOMO level of PCBM was found to have a negligible deviation after the incorporation of HTL. The work functions of the P3HT:PCBM blend on either substrate was almost identical and it was determined to be about 4.3 eV.
The direct energy level alignment at the interface was then accurately determined referring to the HOMO and vacuum level relative to EF extracted from UPS spectra, while LUMO positions were derived by adding the charge-transport gaps relative to the HOMO energy levels. As shown in the schematic energy level diagrams in Fig. 4f, the incorporation of the SnS layer give rise to a downward shift in the HOMO and LUMO levels of P3HT, resulting in good alignment of the energy levels between P3HT and PCBM in the polymer active layer. According to the empirical equation listed below,12 the larger offset generated between the HOMO level of P3HT and the LUMO level of PCBM tends to increase the Voc of the device:VOC = (1/q)(|EHOMO, P3HT| − |ELUMO, PCBM| − 0.3 V)where q is the elementary charge, EHOMO,P3HT is the HOMO level energy of the P3HT as donor and ELUMO,PCBM is the LUMO level energy of PCBM as acceptor. It should be noted that the VOC loss of 0.3 eV is empirical, and the loss could be greater or smaller. In addition, the enlarged interval between the HOMO level of P3HT and the LUMO level of PCBM tends to hinder the extraction of holes from the HOMO of P3HT, causing the decline of Jsc.13 This is consistent with the photovoltaic response shown in Fig. 4b and Table 1, in which an elevated Voc and a decline of Jsc were found after the incorporation of the SnS transporting layer.
Conclusions
A programmed hydrothermal approach is demonstrated toward multi-scale SnS nanostructures, involving simple precursors and primitively changing ligands. Chemical medium control and ligand exchange are crucial for the formation of multi-scale nanostructures. This led to the successful synthesis of SnS nanocrystals that have representative orthorhombic structure and bright photoluminescence under UV excitation. Further, the incorporation of SnS NWMs as HTL into PVCs promoted the power conversion efficiency up to 1.57%, with 43% enhancement compared to the reference device. This enhancement represents an innovation and breakthrough for the application of SnS as HTL in PVCs and may represent a new paradigm for the generation of transporting materials from the general category of polymer. We consider that this work will facilitate the further research of SnS synthesis and its application in photoelectric devices. Further investigation into the influence of morphologies as well the existence of capping ligands on PVC performance will be systematically discussed in the subsequent work.

(C) PXRD pattern of the typical SnS NWMs. The peaks in the curve correspond to the standard data of JCPDS no. 75-1803. Insets are the (001), (100) and (010) plane structures of the orthorhombic SnS unit cell with pbnm symmetry. The yellow atoms represent sulfur, whereas the ultramarine atoms represent tin. (D) PXRD pattern of the TEA-capped SnO/SnS NBs, showing that most peaks are matched to JCPDS no. 06-0395.	 

 	Fig. 3  (A) Survey XPS spectrum of typical SnS NWMs. High resolution XPS spectra of (B) Sn 3d and (C) S 2p. (D) PL spectra of SnS NWMs at different excitation wavelengths (in 20 nm increments starting from 300 nm to 480 nm). Insets are the images of SnS NWMs solution under daylight and UV lamp (λex = 365 nm).	 

 	Fig. 4  (A) Schematic of the PVC structure incorporating SnS HTL. Insets are the molecular structures of P3HT and PCBM, and the TEM image of the SnS NWMs adopted as transporting layer. (B) J–V characteristics of PV cell with and without SnS NWMs incorporated under AM 1.5 G simulated solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2. (C) The J–V characteristics recorded in the dark. (D) The corresponding IPCE curves of the devices. (E) Hel UPS spectra of SnS and P3HT:PCBM layers spin-coated on ITO substrate, and P3HT:PCBM active layer spin-coated on SnS layer: (left panel) normalized secondary electron cutoff region and (right panel) enlarged HOMO region. (F) Schematic energy level diagrams of the component materials used in PVC configuration with the Fermi level (EF) alignment: left is ITO/P3HT:PCBM and right is ITO/SnS/P3HT:PCBM structure.
