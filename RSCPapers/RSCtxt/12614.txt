    , Accepted 13th June 2017First published on 13th June 2017AbstractIn order to realize high photocurrent generation in the low-energy region of the solar spectrum, two conjugated A–D–A oligomers, PY-1 and DCI-2 comprising a central dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole donor (D) unit and end-capping acceptors (A) 1-butyl-4-methyl-2,6-dioxopyridine-3-carbonitrile (PY) or 3-dicyanomethyleneindan-1-one (DCI) have been synthesized and characterized. The oligomers showed strong absorptions in the red and near-IR region in solution and in the solid state. As a consequence of the strong electron-accepting character, the absorption band of DCI-2 in thin films is significantly red-shifted compared to that of PY-1 resulting in a low optical energy gap of 1.23 eV. In optimized solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells using a polymeric donor P1, the new non-fullerene acceptor DCI-2 provides an excellent power conversion efficiency of 6.94% which is noticeably higher than that of PY-1-based devices (PCE = 4.89%). Most importantly, a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of ∼0.8 V with unprecedented energy losses, between the optical energy gap and the open-circuit voltage, between 0.39 and 0.43 eV concomitant with excellent external quantum efficiencies of 69%@880 nm in the NIR-regime have been achieved for DCI-2-based devices.
1. Introduction
Over the past two decades tremendous progress has been made in the development of conjugated polymers or small molecules as donor materials for efficient organic single bulk-heterojunction solar cells (BHJSC) reaching power conversion efficiencies (PCE) over 11%.1–5 In these devices, the acceptor materials employed are mostly limited to fullerene derivatives, such as PC61BM or PC71BM despite several efforts being made to tailor the energy levels of other fullerene-based acceptors.6–8 These high performances are mainly due to the optimization of the active layer with respect to light absorption, matching of energy levels, tuning of the blend morphology by solvent or thermal annealing, use of solvent additives and interfacial engineering.9–17 Despite of the large electron affinity, high electron mobility and isotropic charge transport owing to their three-dimensional structures, the fullerene derivatives have several drawbacks, such as expensive preparation and purification, limited absorption in the visible region, difficulty in tuning of energy levels and morphological instabilities.7 Moreover, the fullerene-based BHJSCs suffer from relatively large energy losses (Eloss) (generally over 0.6 eV) and thus limit the further performance improvement.18–20
Therefore, over the past few years, the focus of many research activities has been on the development of molecular non-fullerene (NF) electron-accepting materials.21–23 To date the most successful NF-acceptors are twisted perylene24–26 or diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives,27 linear acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecules comprising 1,1-dicyanomethylenerhodanine28 or 3-dicyanomethyleneindan-1-one (DCI)29–33 moieties. Among the limiting factors in BHJSCs the material properties of the active layer are the most determining factor for overall performance. In order to increase the photocurrent (JSC) and therefore the PCE of BHJSC, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device should be broadened by extending towards the higher wavelength region. In single-junction devices, this can only be achieved by designing NF-acceptors with strong and broad complementary absorption in the visible region and appropriate frontier orbital energy levels with respect to the conjugated polymer donor for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. However, it is very rare to achieve high EQE in the near-infrared (NIR) region. Recently, Janssen and co-workers reported an EQEmax of 52%@∼850 nm with the EQEonset extended up to 1000 nm for polymer:fullerene solar cells.18 A maximum EQE value of 66%@810 nm (EQEonset = 900 nm) has been achieved for a NF-acceptor-based BHJSC.34 The Eloss between the optical gap and the open-circuit voltage in these devices was between 0.52 and 0.59 eV which is slightly lower than the empirical threshold value of 0.6 eV, suggested as an approximation to the maximum photovoltage achievable for BHJSCs.35 Therefore, it is a crucial challenge to obtain high EQE in the NIR region with further lowering of the energy losses.
Among the class of NF-acceptors, low energy gap A–D–A type molecules were found to be very promising with respect to tunable absorption and energy levels. Zhan and co-workers have developed such a class of NF-acceptors comprising indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the central donor unit and 3-dicyanomethyleneindan-1-one (DCI) as the acceptor end groups, which in combination with a donor polymer having complementary absorption achieved PCEs as high as 9.6%.32,36 Hou and co-workers have successively boosted the PCE to 12% by structural modulation of DCI-based NF-acceptors in conjunction with a suitable polymer donor exhibiting Eloss values between 0.50 and 0.66 eV.34,37 McCulloch and co-workers as well reported a NF-acceptor exhibiting a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) up to 1.12 V corresponding to a voltage loss of ∼0.5 eV.38
In our design strategy for structurally defined molecular materials, we have chosen oligothiophene-substituted dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) as the electron-rich backbone. This has been successfully applied in a series of A–D–A-type molecular donor comprising dicyanovinyl (DCV) acceptor groups showing excellent performance in solution-processed BHJSCs using fullerene-based acceptors.14,39 It has been demonstrated that by increasing the strength of the terminal acceptor units in A–D–A molecules it is possible to shift the absorption band to the longer wavelengths and simultaneously lower the position of the frontier molecular orbitals.40 Therefore, by replacing the terminal DCV groups with stronger electron-accepting 1-butyl-4-methyl-2,6-dioxopyridine-3-carbonitrile (PY) and DCI moieties in Py-1 and DCI-2, we would be able to switch the function of A–D–A donor molecules14 to A–D–A-type acceptors (Fig. 1). We note here that both of these acceptor moieties were originally introduced as acceptor components in D–A type merocyanine dyes, which achieved respectable performance in BHJSCs.41,42 In order to provide good solubility of these NF-acceptors in organic solvents for solution-processability, we attached branched octylnonyl substituents at the central DTP–nitrogen and hexyl side chains at each thiophene unit in a regioregular fashion. Oligomers Py-1 and DCI-2 exhibit deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels almost similar to the fullerene derivatives and are therefore now used as acceptors along with a D–A-based conjugated copolymer comprising benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and benzothiadiazole (BT) as the donor and acceptor units linked with thiophene43P1 as the electron donor. The novelty of this polymer is the simplicity of its synthesis as compared to that of other copolymers. The optimized devices exhibited an overall PCE of 4.89% and 6.94% for P1:PY-1 and P1:DCI-2-based active layers, respectively. The higher efficiency of DCI-2-based devices can be attributed to the improved JSC and FF, as confirmed from the EQE spectra and charge transport investigations.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
The synthesis of NF-acceptors PY-1 and DCI-2 is shown in Scheme 1. The Knoevenagel condensation reaction of dialdehyde 339 with PY and DCI acceptors in the presence of NH4OAC and/or pyridine as the base yielded oligomers PY-1 and DCI-2 in 87% and 83%, respectively. The purity of the oligomers was checked by high-performance column chromatography (HPLC) and confirmed by NMR and mass spectrometry.

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2 presents the optical absorption spectra of PY-1 and DCI-2 in dilute chloroform solution and thin films prepared by spin-coating from the chloroform solution and the data are summarized in Table 1. In solution, both the oligomers showed two distinct absorption bands in the shorter wavelength region (400–500 nm) and in the longer wavelength region (550–900 nm) with a maximum at 645 nm and 677 nm for PY-1 and DCI-2, respectively. The high energy band is assigned to the π–π* transitions, whereas the intense band at lower energy is ascribed to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition between the donor bridge and the terminal acceptors PY or DCI, respectively. The absorption maximum of DCI-2 is red-shifted by 32 nm compared to that of PY-1 which may be attributed to the stronger electron-accepting ability of DCI. The presence of carbonyl and dicyanomethylene groups in DCI-2 can induce stronger intramolecular charge transfer and extend absorption toward the near-infrared region. From the X-ray structure analyses it has also been shown that dicyanovinyl groups possess strong intermolecular H-bonding interactions between the vinylic or aromatic CH and the N-atom of a neighbouring cyano group (CH⋯NC).44,45 Compared to the solution spectra, in thin films the corresponding CT absorption bands were strongly red-shifted by 102 nm and 208 nm for NF-acceptors PY-1 and DCI-2, respectively. These observations indicate strong electronic coupling between closely stacked chromophores in the solid state for these two oligomers. Furthermore, DCI-2 exhibited a broad absorption band with a higher full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 248 nm compared to 190 nm for PY-1. Such a broad absorption profile should be beneficial for enhancing the JSC values in OSCs. The op/Fc+ as the optical energy gaps (Eoptg) of oligomers PY-1 and DCI-2 in thin films calculated from the onset of the absorption band are 1.40 eV and 1.23 eV, respectively, and were significantly lower compared to that in solution (1.51 eV and 1.42 eV for PY-1 and DCI-2, respectively). The absorption spectrum of the donor polymer P1 is also shown in Fig. 2 and displayed a CT absorption band at around 532 nm in solution and 585 nm in thin films which is complementary to the NF-acceptors used in this study.

Cyclic voltammetry was used to determine the positions of the frontier molecular orbitals of oligomers PY-1 and DCI-2 (Fig. 3a). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the oligomers were estimated from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction waves, respectively, and were −5.27 eV/−4.00 eV for PY-1 and −5.24 eV/−4.05 eV for DCI-2 (Fig. 3b). The electrochemical energy gaps ECVg for PY-1 and DCI-2 were 1.27 eV and 1.24 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy level of both oligomers is very similar to that of fullerene derivatives and therefore can be used as acceptors for solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells in combination with a suitable conjugated polymer or small molecules as the donor. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P1 were −5.10/−3.48 eV. It should be noted that the LUMO offset between the donor P1 and acceptors PY-1 and DCI-2 is more than the typical threshold value of 0.3 eV, which is favourable for efficient electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. However, the HOMO offset of PY-1 and DCI-2 with respect to P1 is only 0.17 eV and 0.14 eV, respectively, which is much smaller than the widely used experimental threshold value of at least 0.3 eV. Li et al. have reported a PCE of 6.5% for polymer solar cells using a non-fullerene-based acceptor with a HOMO offset between the donor and the acceptor of 0.2 eV.46

2.3. Photoluminescence quenching
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were carried out to probe the exciton dissociation in the blend film and are presented in Fig. 4. The thin film of the pristine polymer P1 exhibited a strong fluorescence band maximum at 814 nm, while the P1:PY-1 and P1:DCI-2 blend films showed around 82% and 90% fluorescence quenching, respectively, indicating that despite the small HOMO offset effective photo-induced charge transfer occurred from polymer P1 to acceptors PY-1 or DCI-2 in the blended film, which is beneficial for a higher JSC in BHJSCs.

2.4. Charge carrier mobility and molecular packing
Electron mobilities of the pristine acceptors were estimated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model using the current–voltage characteristics of the device structure ITO/Al/NF-acceptor/Al in the dark and exhibited about 4.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PY-1 and DCI-2, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is close to those of fullerene derivatives (10−4–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1)47 assuring effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes.
The grazing incident X-ray diffraction patterns of PY-1 and DCI-2 are shown in Fig. 5. The diffraction peak of DCI-2 is sharper (FWHM = 0.84) than the one for PY-1 (FWHM = 1.21), indicating a higher degree of crystallinity for the former. Additionally, a change in the position of the (100) diffraction peak of DCI-2 (2θ = 5.63°) compared to that of PY-1 (2θ = 4.92°) is observed, which translates into a smaller lamellar inter-chain stacking distance of 15.68 Å for DCI-2vs. 17.94 Å for PY-1. Furthermore, the DCI-2 film clearly showed the strong (010) reflection at 2θ = 22.06 Å, whereas PY-1 exhibited a weak (010) reflection that referred to the d010 spacing of 4.02 Å. These results demonstrated that DCI-2 has a stronger and tighter π–π stacking than PY-1, resulting from the presence of dicyanomethylene groups which may induce strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state compared to the PY-1 acceptor, resulting in enhanced electron mobility for DCI-2 in the active layer.

2.5. Photovoltaic properties
We have employed the oligomers PY-1 or DCI-2 as the electron acceptor in solution-processed BHJSCs using a D–A copolymer P1 as the electron donor. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P1 are relatively higher than those of the oligomers. The LUMO offset between the NF-acceptors and the P1 donor is higher (>0.5 eV) than the exciton binding energy suggesting effective exciton dissociation.35 The energy gap between the LUMO of PY-1/DCI-2 and the HOMO of P1 is as large as 1.10/1.05 eV which is favourable for high VOCs in the BHJSCs. Moreover, the absorption spectra of the blend of NF-acceptors and the D–A copolymer donor cover a broad spectral range that will benefit the light harvesting of the solar cells.
We have used PY-1 and DCI-2 as electron-accepting materials along with the D–A conjugated copolymer P1 as the donor for the fabrication of BHJ solar cells with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1:PY-1 or DCI-2/PFN/Al. First of all we have optimized the conditions for preparing the active layers by varying the weight ratios (1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:2.5) between P1:PY-1 and P1:DCI-2 and found that for both compounds a weight ratio of 1:2 gave the best photovoltaic response. The solar cells exhibited overall PCEs of 3.19% for P1:PY-1 (JSC = 8.08 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.86 and FF = 0.46) and 4.60% for P1:DCI-2 (JSC = 10.15 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.84 and FF = 0.54), respectively. Afterwards, the active layer was optimized by adding a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (3 vol%) as the additive in chloroform. The J–V characteristics of the best devices are presented in Fig. 6a and the corresponding data are compiled in Table 2. The solar cells based on the optimized P1:PY-1 active layers exhibited a PCE of 4.89% (PCEavg = 4.81 ± 0.08%) with an improved JSC of 10.53 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.83 and a FF of 0.56. The PV performance was as well improved for devices based on P1:DCI-2, which displayed notably larger values of both JSC (13.77 mA cm−2) and FF (63%) due to efficient charge-carrier extraction, leading to an increased PCE of 6.94%. The average PCE on a batch of five identical devices for P1:DCI-2 is 6.87 ± 0.08%. The VOCs of 0.84 V and 0.80 V for P1:DCI-2 devices with and without DIO are exceptionally high values for materials with such a low optical gap of 1.23 eV, indicating a photon energy loss, defined as the offset between the optical energy gap and the open-circuit voltage (Eloss = Eoptg − eVOC), which in this device was as low as 0.39 eV.46,48–51 In this expression Eoptg represents the smaller value of either the donor or acceptor materials and herein this refers to the Eoptg of DCI-2 or PY-1, which is smaller than that of P1. The photon energy loss is generally described as the loss in free energy in converting band edge photons to collectable charge carriers at an open circuit.11,51 We have measured the dielectric constants (εr) of these non-fullerene acceptors at 1 kHz which are about 4.3 and 4.7 for PY-1 and DCI-2, respectively, which are higher than that for PC71BM and may be due to the presence of CN moieties in the end-capping units.52 The high dielectric constant leads to the low exciton binding energy and may be attributed to the low energy losses in our devices. The concept of increase in the dielectric constant to decrease the exciton binding energy is still the concern of discussion. It should be noted that the best performing P1:PC71BM devices (optimized blend ratio of 1:1 w/w) generated PCEs of 3.45% and 5.30% (Eloss = 0.76 eV) in the absence and the presence of DIO as the additive,43 suggesting the advantage of the present NF-acceptors over the fullerene derivative. The high values of VOC and the low energy loss in these devices may be related to the radiative recombinations as described by Vandewal et al. for the devices based on polymer:fullerene systems.53,54 As reported in the literature, the energy loss of the solar cells originates from three parts, including an unavoidable radiative loss (0.2–0.4 eV), additional recombination loss and non-radiative recombination loss; the latter two may occur but the main losses are radiative losses in the present devices.

Moreover, the VOC of the organic solar cell can be expressed by the following expression:55  where EALUMO is the LUMO energy level of the acceptor, EDHOMO is the HOMO energy level of the donor and ECTEb is the binding energy of the charge transfer exciton (CTE). CTEs are thought to be the precursor to the free charge carriers, since this is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant. Since the dielectric constant of both non-fullerene acceptors is lower as compared to that of PC71BM it leads to the lower energy loss and high VOC.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are depicted in Fig. 6b. It can be seen that the P1:DCI-2-based devices showed a much broader response in the region 400–980 nm while that of the P1:PY-1 device was limited to 900 nm. Since in our systems the light absorption by the NF-acceptors also contribute to the overall photocurrent generation in the devices, the hole transfer from the NF-acceptors PY-1 and DCI-2 to the donor polymer P1 needed to be considered.56,57 Although the HOMO offset (ΔEHOMO) between P1 and NF-acceptors is in the range of 0.14–0.17 eV and well below the threshold value of 0.3 eV, the devices displayed exceptionally high EQE values in the absorption range beyond 800 nm corresponding to the NF-acceptors, where light absorption from P1 is negligible, indicating that this small HOMO offset is sufficient for the transfer of holes from the NF-acceptor to the polymer donor.58 Since the dielectric constant of these NF-acceptors is higher compared to that of PC71BM indicating a lower exciton binding energy, therefore, this small driving force is sufficient for hole transfer from the NF-acceptor to the donor polymer in the BHJ active layer. The EQE values of P1:DCI-2 devices were higher than that of P1:PY-1 across the entire spectrum, reaching an unprecedentedly high value of 69%@880 nm extending up to 1000 nm, an outstanding value for organic materials absorbing in the near-infrared region of the solar spectrum. The JSC values estimated from the integration of EQE spectra are 10.43 mA cm−2 and 13.65 mA cm−2, for PY-1 and DCI-2-based devices, respectively, which are very close to the values obtained from the J–V characteristics under illumination (Table 2).
In order to get information about the increase of JSC and FF in the P1:DCI-2-based device, we measured the electron and hole mobilities by the SCLC method with the device structures ITO/Al/active layer/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). The electron/hole mobilities are 2.21 × 10−4/1.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.06 × 10−4/2.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P1:DCI-2 and P1:PY-1 active layers, respectively. The relative low hole to electron mobility ratio of 1.94 for the device based on P1:DCI-2 compared to that of P1:PY-1 (2.05) suggests a relatively more balanced charge transport in the P1:DCI-2 blended film than P1:PY-1 and thus a higher JSC and FF.
In order to get information about the non-germinate bimolecular recombination mechanism in the devices, we have measured JSC values at different illumination intensities (Pin) and plotted them in a log–log scale (Fig. 7a). The correlation between the JSC and Pin can be expressed as JSC ∝ Pinγ. In general, the slope γ = 1 indicates the collection of all free carriers at the corresponding electrodes without any recombination, while γ < 1 indicates some extent of bimolecular recombination in the devices.59,60 Both P1:PY-1 and P1:DCI-2 devices showed a linear dependence of JSC with Pin in the logarithmic scale with the calculated γ values of 0.84 and 0.91, respectively, indicating less bimolecular recombination in the P1:DCI-2 device.
 Fig. 7  (a) Variation of JSC against the illumination intensity of the devices. (b) Variation in the photocurrent density (Jph) against the effective internal voltage (Veff) for devices based on P1:PY-1 and P1:DCI-2 active layers, respectively. 
In order to investigate the exciton dissociation and photocurrent generation in optimized devices based on PY-1 and DCI-2, the photocurrent density (Jph) is plotted as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) for all the devices according to the literature61–63 and shown in Fig. 7b. The Jph is defined as the difference between the photocurrent densities under illumination (JL) and in the dark (JD). The Veff is given by Vo − Vappl, where Vo is the voltage at which the Jph is zero and Vappl is the applied voltage. As shown in Fig. 7b, the Jph increases linearly with the Veff in the low voltage region and saturates at a high Veff. Therefore, we assume that at full saturation all the excitons generated after photon absorption in the active layer are dissociated into free charge carriers and subsequently collected by the respective electrodes. This allows us to estimate the maximum exciton generation and dissociation rate Gmax according to Jphsat = qGmaxL, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. The values of Gmax for PY-1 and DCI-2-based devices are 3.4 × 1027 m−3 s−1 and 5.5 × 1027 m−3 s−1, respectively. The trend observed for the Gmax of these devices is consistent with the enhancement of the JSC and EQE, indicating more exciton generation and dissociation in the DCI-2-based devices. In addition, a charge collection probability (PC) (PC = JSC/Jphsat) of 0.82 was obtained for the devices based on DCI-2 which is higher than that for PY-1-based devices (0.73). The decreased bimolecular recombination and increased exciton dissociation contributed to the high JSC and FF of the NF-acceptor-based device presented here.31,56,64 Moreover, the Jph of the device based on DCI-2 saturates at a lower Veff as compared to that of its PY-1 counterpart (see Fig. 7b), indicating that in the former device the recombination is less as compared to the latter. The value of PC at a maximum power point for DCI-2 (0.69) is higher than that for the PY-1 (0.61) device also indicating the reduced recombination in the DCI-2-based device.
Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the morphology of the optimized P1:PY-1 and P1:DCI-2 active layers (Fig. 8a and b). The root mean square (rms) of the surface roughness determined by AFM for the P1:PY-1 and P1:DCI-2 are about 0.86 nm and 1.23 nm, respectively. Moreover, the TEM analysis provides more clear evidence for the difference in the nanoscale phase separation morphology between the donor and the acceptor in the active layers. In TEM, alternative dark and bright domains can be distinguished; indicating that the donor P1 has a compatibility with the acceptor PY-1 with small domain sizes (Fig. 8c). However, for the P1:DCI-2 film processed under the same conditions (Fig. 8d), a more appropriate nanoscale interpenetrating network is observed which is beneficial for efficient exciton diffusion/dissociation and transport and leads to the high JSC and FF.

Fig. 9a summarizes the correlation of eVOCvs. Eg obtained in this work and is compared with a series of efficient solar cells based on the polymer/oligomer donor with PC71BM or NF-acceptors (see Tables S1–S3 for details, ESI†). The major efficiency drop in organic solar cells is due to the losses in the VOC. It can be clearly seen that with some exceptions a majority of the devices exhibit an Eloss above the empirical limit of 0.6 eV. Only a few donor:acceptor pairs with appropriate energy levels have shown to minimize the wasted energy and maximize the VOC value. We have now developed a type of molecular system which can generate high photovoltages at low voltage losses. Indeed, for the P1:PY-1 and P1:DCI-2 blends with optical gaps of 1.40 eV and 1.23 eV, the VOC values between 0.80 and 0.86 V are quite exceptional leading to Eloss values down to 0.39 eV. These values are superior compared to a similar energy gap polymer:PC71BM blend65 (Eg = 1.22 eV, VOC = 0.66 V, and Eloss = 0.56 eV) and a polymer:NF-acceptor blend66 (Eg = 1.24 eV, VOC = 0.74 V, and Eloss = 0.50 eV).
 Fig. 9  (a) Plots of eVOC against Eg, determined from the absorption onset, as well as (b) EQEmax and (c) PCE against Eloss (Eg − eVOC) in various BHJSCs with fullerene or non-fullerene acceptors (PCE > 5%). The dotted lines represent the Eloss at 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 eV showing high EQE and photovoltage at low energy losses. NF-A represents the non-fullerene acceptor. See ESI Tables S1–S3† for the detailed data and references. 
In order to maximize the PCE of BHJSCs it is important to minimize the Eloss. Moreover, in BHJSCs there is often a trade-off between JSC and VOC values, i.e. difficult to attain high quantum efficiencies at low Eloss. Recent results demonstrated that higher EQEs close to 60% can be obtained at an Eloss below 0.5 eV by the choice of suitable polymer donors and NF-acceptors.38,67 In our case, the Eloss is even close to 0.4 eV for P1:DCI-2 devices, much below the empirical limit and is in fact the lowest value achieved so far for fullerene and NF-acceptor-based BHJSCs, still maintaining a high EQE of 69% and a reasonable PCE of up to 6.94% (Fig. 9b and c). Since the absorption spectrum of both the non-fullerenes is extended up to NIR, the loss is radiative.51 Moreover, these very small losses in potentials are closer to the values reported for perovskite (Eloss = 0.41–0.45 eV)68,69 and some of the inorganic (c-Si, CIGS) solar cells (Eloss = 0.41–0.43 eV)70 (see Table S4, ESI†).
3. Conclusions
Here we show that the introduction of two different electron-accepting groups on a dithienopyrrole-based conjugated backbone leads to molecular A–D–A-type non-fullerene acceptors with distinctly different optoelectronic properties and solar cell performance. These materials displayed broad and low-energy absorption bands extending up to 1000 nm. Solar cell devices using these acceptors exhibited low energy losses relative to their optical gaps (∼1.23 eV) when mixed with a polymeric donor material with suitable energy levels. Among the two NF-acceptors, DCI-2 turned out to be the most promising material capable of generating a significant photocurrent up to 1000 nm with an exceptional EQE of 69% at 880 nm while producing a high VOC of 0.84 V, suggesting very low energy losses (∼0.39 eV). This is the first report in organic solar cells showing such low energy losses and close to the values reported for inorganic and perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, these NF-acceptors also outperform the devices based on P1:PC71BM (PCE = 5.3%). These results suggest that substitution of CN moieties in the end-capping acceptor unit increases the dielectric constant and lowers the exciton binding energy leading to the low voltage loss in the devices. Our findings foresee a bright future for efficient NF-acceptor-based OSCs with a view to achieve higher efficiency at low fundamental losses in potential.
4. Experimental details
4.1. Materials and methods
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz). The chemical shift values (δ) are expressed in ppm using residual solvent protons (1H NMR, δH = 7.26 for CDCl3, δH = 5.92 for tetrachloroethane-d2; 13C NMR, δC = 77.0 for CDCl3, and δC = 74.20 for tetrachloroethane-d2) as the internal standard. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet), t (triplet) and m (multiplet). The melting points were determined using a Mettler Toledo DSC 823. The EI mass spectra were recorded on a Varian Saturn 2000 GC-MS, MALDI-MS experiments were performed using a MS Bruker Reflex 2 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB) as the matrix. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a Hitachi instrument equipped with a UV-Vis detector L-7420 and columns (Nucleosil 100-5 NO2 with a pore size of 100 Å) from Machery-Nagel using a dichloromethane/n-hexane mixture (40:60) as the eluent. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded in 1 cm cuvettes with Merck Uvasol grade solvents on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with a computer-controlled Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat in a three-electrode single-compartment cell with a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a AgCl/Ag reference electrode. All potentials were internally referenced to the ferricenium/ferrocene couple. Tetrahydrofuran and N,N-dimethylformamide (Merck) were dried using a MB SPS-800 solvent purifying system (MBraun). All synthetic steps were carried out under an argon atmosphere.
4.2. Device fabrication and characterization
BHJSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1:PY-1 or DCI-2/PFN/Al. Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min each and then treated and dried under ambient conditions. After drying the substrates, a thin layer (40 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin coated on the ITO-coated glass substrate and baked at 110 °C for 10 min. The photoactive layer of the blends of different weight ratios of P1 and PY-1 or DCI-2 were prepared from chloroform solution and then spin cast at 2000 rpm for 60 s on the top of the PEDOT:PSS film and then dried in a vacuum under ambient conditions for 5 h to remove the solvent residue. For the solvent additive, different concentrations of DIO (1, 2, 3 and 4 vol%) were added to the chloroform solution of the active layer and stirred for 1 h at 50 °C. The concentration of the solutions was kept at 18 mg mL−1 for all the blends. A methanol solution of polyelectrolyte poly[9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) at a concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 was then spin coated onto the top of the photoactive layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s and dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h. Finally, an aluminium (Al) top electrode was deposited onto the top of the PFN buffer layer by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 1 × 10−5 Pa through a shadow mask area of 20 mm2.
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJSCs were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 2400 source meter in the dark and under simulated AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an optical filter was used to provide stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the devices through the light source and a monochromator and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short-circuit conditions. All the measurements were performed under ambient conditions with encapsulated devices. An aperture of 18 mm2 was used during the measurements of the J–V characteristics under illumination and EQE measurement.
In order to measure the charge carrier mobilities in the active layers, the hole-only and electron-only measurements were carried out for devices with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au (hole mobility) and ITO/Al/active layer/Al (electron mobility).
