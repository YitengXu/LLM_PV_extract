    , Accepted 27th June 2012First published on 27th June 2012AbstractWe have fabricated hybrid devices in the form of indium tin oxide/titanium dioxide/poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester/copper (ITO/TiO2/P3HT:PCBM/Cu) to clarify the impact of the TiO2/P3HT:PCBM interface on the charge transport using the charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV) technique. We found that a large equilibrium charge reservoir is accumulated at negative offsets at the TiO2/P3HT:PCBM interface leading to space charge limited extraction current (SCLC) transients. We show analytically the SCLC transient response and compare the experimental data to calculated SCLC at a linearly increasing voltage. The theoretical calculations indicate that the large charge reservoir at negative offset voltages is due to thermally generated charges combined with poor hole extraction at the ITO/TiO2 contact, due to the hole blocking character of TiO2.
Introduction
The development of large area, low cost and high efficiency solar cells is of great interest for the production of cheap, renewable energy. Among the possible candidates are the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), polymer solar cells or possibly a combination, i.e. hybrid solar cells. Recently polymer solar cells have achieved power conversion efficiencies over 9%,1 showing the potential of these types of solar cells for use in energy production, while DSSCs have reached over 12% conversion efficiency.2
Hybrid solar cells offer the opportunity of taking advantage of the best properties of organic and inorganic materials, possibly combining them into better devices. The use of metal oxides such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) offers the possibility of precise control of their nanostructure3–5 to achieve a preferable structure for the incorporation of organic materials, which require an interpenetrating structure with a high surface area to achieve efficient exciton dissociation due to their short exciton diffusion length.6–9 Titanium dioxide is widely used in DSSCs where it has been shown to be a good photo anode when combined with a visible light absorbing dye.10,11 Titanium dioxide has also been used to fabricate hybrid solar cells in the form of nanoporous TiO2 powders12 or as nanotubes13 for increased interfacial area to enhance exciton dissociation. Titanium oxide (TiOx) has been shown to be an efficient hole-blocking layer and an optical spacer to increase the absorption in organic bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells.14–17 In addition, the use of polymers as the hole-transporting layer (i.e. solid electrolyte) has been demonstrated, however, with low efficiencies compared to liquid electrolytes due to the low dielectric constant leading to poor charge screening in the polymers.18,19
Conjugated polymers such as P3HT have attracted considerable interest due to their ability to form ordered structures which leads to a high hole mobility.20 By blending P3HT with an electron accepting unit such as PCBM an interpenetrating network is formed which is beneficial for achieving high efficiency solar cells21,22 and has good charge screening properties.23
In this paper we present experimental results showing that a large hole reservoir is accumulated at the TiO2/P3HT:PCBM interface, by applying a negative offset. We show that thermally generated charges along with the hole blocking character of TiO2 are responsible for the creation of the charge reservoir. The charge reservoir can be extracted with a linearly increasing voltage ramp, causing space charge limited extraction currents.
Experimental methods
Device fabrication
Titanium dioxide thin films were fabricated on ITO substrates (Bruker) by dip coating in a titanium chloride (TiCl4) solution. The titanium chloride was dissolved in a mixture of ethanol (EtOH), deionized water, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and Pluronic 127 (Sigma-Aldrich) in the molar ratio (TiCl4:EtOH:H2O:THF:Pluronic 127) 1:250:10:20:0.001. The ITO substrates were immersed in the TiCl4 solution and withdrawn at a constant rate of 1.2 mm s−1 at a constant humidity of 25% at room temperature, using a KSV dip coater (KSV Instruments Ltd., Helsinki, Finland). After dipping, the films were sintered at 500 °C for 10 minutes to form anatase TiO2. Thicker films were obtained by heating the films at 400 °C for 3 minutes between each dipping step, followed by a final sintering step at 500 °C for 10 minutes to form the anatase film. The crystallinity of the TiO2 films was checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Discover), however, we note that the crystallite size in the thinnest TiO2 films (7 nm) as determined from the XRD measurements using the Scherrer equation was only around 1 nm. This method enabled the control of the film thickness from 7 nm to 54 nm, measured by X-ray reflection (Bruker D8 Discover). This metal-oxide fabrication method was utilized due to the simplicity in the TiO2 precursor used and the equipment required for dip-coating and sintering procedures.
The compounds P3HT (Plextronics, OS2100) and PCBM (Solenne PV) were dissolved in a chlorobenzene solution in a 1:1 weight ratio which was subsequently deposited on the TiO2 coated ITO substrate by spin coating (to achieve an active layer thickness of d = 600–900 nm). To complete the device structure a copper electrode (30 nm) was evaporated on top of the organic layer and the device was subsequently heat-treated on a hotplate at 120 °C for 15 minutes. Copper was chosen as a top contact due to its work function being close to that of ITO giving a close to zero built-in-voltage which is beneficial for transport and recombination measurements. The device structure and the energy levels of the materials used in this work are shown in Fig. 1.

Electrical characterization

We have used the charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV)27,28 technique to characterize our devices. The CELIV technique is schematically shown in Fig. 2.A linearly increasing voltage pulse with voltage rise speed A = Uapplied/tpulse is applied to the device and the resulting current transient consists of two parts: a rectangular current transient j(0) due to the displacement current (from charging the capacitance of the device) and an extraction current Δj due to extraction of mobile charge carriers. The number of extracted surface charges, p, is calculated by integrating the extraction current density Δj (obtained by subtracting the displacement current from the total current) over time as: (1)where e is the elementary charge. By applying an external offset voltage (Uoff), during the measurement, the electric field can be varied in order to modify the band alignment in the device. In this work, the applied voltage pulse and offset voltage are applied relative to the ITO contact.
Results & discussion
In Fig. 3a a typical extraction current transient of an ITO/TiO2(7 nm)/P3HT:PCBM(850 nm)/Cu device is shown. The extraction current is characterized by an initially slowly growing current which is followed by a sharp increase. The point of the increase is strongly dependent on the applied Uoff, with a higher negative offset shifting the increase in current to longer times, as seen in Fig. 3a. Applying a negative offset voltage results in a large extraction current, while a positive offset yields small extraction. The current response in Fig. 3a shows a slight injection current as evidenced by the slightly rising current at longer times, however, this injection current is much smaller than the current arising from mobile charge carriers and thus will not influence their behaviour.

The amount of extracted surface charges has been calculated and is shown in Fig. 3b as a function of the applied Uoff for different thicknesses of TiO2. As can be seen from the figure the amount of charge carriers increases when applying a more negative Uoff and decreases when applying a more positive Uoff. A similar offset voltage behaviour is also seen in devices without a TiO2 layer, but the amount of extractable charge carriers is much smaller than that in devices with a TiO2 layer, indicating that a large charge reservoir is formed at the TiO2/P3HT:PCBM interface.
These measurements indicate the presence of mobile charge carriers in the dark at the TiO2/P3HT:PCBM interface. When a negative offset is applied to the ITO contact, more carriers are accumulated at the interface, forming a charge reservoir. By applying a positive voltage ramp to the ITO contact, thus extracting electrons through the ITO and holes at the copper contact, and noting that a negative offset increases the amount of extracted charge carriers, it is evident that holes are accumulated in the charge reservoir. The number of charge carriers in devices with a TiO2 layer is much higher than in the devices without a TiO2 layer and is a direct consequence of the hole-blocking character of TiO2. The shift in the extraction maximum is caused by a combination of the applied offset voltage and the large amount of charge carriers at the TiO2/P3HT:PCBM interface. A high negative offset voltage will affect the applied linearly increasing voltage ramp, such that a longer time is required to reach a voltage which is sufficient to extract the charge carriers inside the charge reservoir. The large amount of charge carriers will also influence the extraction time due to the screening of the field inside the reservoir. The combination of these two effects will shift the extraction maximum towards longer times, when a more negative offset is applied.
Due to the large amount of charge carriers at the interface, extraction of the hole reservoir through the copper contact will lead to space charge limited current (SCLC). Juška et al.29 have earlier shown that in the case of SCLC in the case of linearly increasing voltage, when t ≫ ttr (ttr being the small-charge transit time at a linearly increasing voltage) will give a quadratic dependence on the extraction current as: (2)after all carriers have been extracted, the current will return to its initial value j(0) (the derivation of eqn (2) is given in the ESI†). The shape of the experimentally obtained CELIV transients is well explained by the analytically solved current equations, however, the current rise at longer timescales is more linear than superlinear.
To further elucidate the behaviour of the CELIV transients, we have also modelled our devices using a model based on that developed by Koster et al.30 The equations to be solved in this model are the Poisson equation: (3)where E is the electric field, p(x,t) and n(x,t) is the hole and electron density, respectively. The continuity equations are written as:31 (4a) (4b)where G and R is the generation and recombination rate, respectively, while the electron, jn, and hole, jp, current densities are given by (5a) (5b)with μn (μp) being the electron (hole) mobility and k Boltzmann's constant. We have assumed that the Einstein relation is valid.
To be able to represent a reduced extraction of charge carriers at the contacts, we have described the extraction rate as a surface recombination rate:32 j = eSrec (n − ni)(7)where ni (pi) is the thermally generated electrons (holes) at the copper or ITO contact, as described in accordance to thermionic emission theory and Srec is the surface recombination rate of electrons or holes at the respective contact. The equations presented above are solved numerically according to the iterative method by Gummel and Scharfetter.31,33,34 We note that in this simplified model we do not take into account the possible trapping of charge carriers.
We have modelled an ITO/TiO2(7 nm)/P3HT:PCBM(800 nm)/Cu device, where we have replaced the hole-blocking TiO2 layer by having a reduced extraction of holes at the ITO/TiO2 contact. This is motivated by the fact that the TiO2 layer is thin compared to the thickness of the whole device, and that TiO2 is known to be a very good hole blocker,14–17 thus reducing the extraction of holes at the ITO/TiO2 contact. The modelled CELIV transients are shown in Fig. 4a, (details of the modelling of the transients are given in the ESI†) where the surface extraction rate of holes, at the ITO/TiO2 contact, has been significantly reduced. We note that the field behaviour of the extraction maximum agrees very well with the experimental results showing that the charge reservoir is formed by thermally generated charges in combination with the hole blocking character of TiO2. Fig. 4b shows the spatial distribution of electrons and holes in the modeled device at Uoff = −0.80 V, showing that holes have been accumulated at the ITO/TiO2 contact. We note that the hole-blocking character of TiO2 is very pronounced even in the thinnest TiO2 layers used in this work (7 nm), confirming that TiO2 very efficiently blocks holes, even in thin layers.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that a large charge reservoir is accumulated at the TiO2/P3HT:PCBM interface. We have used CELIV to clarify the number of extracted charge carriers and found that the magnitude of the reservoir is dependent on the applied offset voltage. A negative offset results in a large reservoir at the TiO2/P3HT:PCBM interface and a positive offset depletes the reservoir. By applying a positive extraction ramp and negative offset we conclude that the charge carriers in the reservoir are holes which drift through the P3HT:PCBM film, giving rise to a SCLC extraction current transient. Theoretical calculations confirm that the shape of the transients is indeed due to SCLC and numerical modeling show that at negative offset the charge reservoir is due to thermally generated charges which remain in the device due to low hole extraction at the ITO/TiO2 contact.
