    , Accepted 5th January 2023First published on 6th January 2023AbstractHard carbons (HCs) are more conductive to the intercalation and adsorption of Na and K ions than commercial graphite, enabling their application in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). However, further improving the rate performance and cycle life of SIBs and PIBs has always been hindered. In this work, N, O, and S triple-doped hard carbons (NOS-HCs) with hierarchical micro/mesoporous structures were prepared by a one-step synthesis process. The adsorption effect of N and O in HCs could be weakened synergistically by the doping of S. Thus, the migration rate of solvated molecules is improved on the electrode surface. Furthermore, the reasonable adsorption effect caused by heteroatoms promotes sodium and potassium storage by adsorption and intercalation at defect edges. Based on the co-regulation between the turbine layers, porous structure, and defects of NOS-HC900, excellent rate capability (315.1 mA g−1 at 2000 mA g−1) for SIBs and stable cycle performance (322.7 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 1000 cycles) for PIBs were obtained. This work provides a simple and feasible strategy for improving the rate performance and cycle life of SIB and PIB anodes.
1. Introduction
High-performance large-scale energy storage equipment has become progressively significant for meeting the storage demand of intermittent green energy (such as solar and wind energy).1 Due to the surge in demand, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are confronted with grave issues of lithium shortage and the resulting rising cost. As they have chemical properties similar to LIBs, sodium- and potassium-ion batteries (SIBs and PIBs) are expected to replace some parts of the market in energy storage because of the abundant sodium (Na) and potassium (K) reserves on the earth.2–4 As an anode for lithium-ion batteries, carbon-based graphite has undergone significant development and has grown into a mature application system. What is essential is to build an attainable Na-intercalation compound with negative formation enthalpy. Nevertheless, graphite-derived compounds such as NaC6 or NaC8 result in a positive enthalpy of formation, which cannot satisfy reversible Na+ storage.5,6 In addition, the large radius of K+ would easily lead to the structural failure of graphite electrodes, thus inducing the attenuation of cycle life.7
Hard carbons (HCs) are deemed as extremely advantageous anode materials for SIBs and PIBs owing to their highly disordered structure and enlarged interlayer distance as well as abundant micropores and defects.8,9 The pivotal requirements for synthesizing pyrolytic HCs are the organic precursors with turbostratic structures induced by the sp3-carbon.10,11 Generally, the process of Na storage in HCs corresponds to a slope region with a potential above 0.1 V and plateau region with a potential lower than 0.1 V. The capacity of the slope region is contributed by adsorption and intercalation behavior (versus Na/Na+), and the contribution of plateau capacity depends on the filling behavior (versus Na/Na+).12–14 Similarly, the mixed structure of defects and layered graphite domains also provide a dual mechanism of insertion and adsorption for K storage.12 Indeed, the storage mechanism of Na and K in HCs is synergistically affected by interlayer spacing, defect concentration, pores, and active sites on the surface.12,15,16 The larger interlayer spacing can provide a more efficient migration path and maintain structural stability during the long cycle.17–19 While the capacity contributed by the slope region is positively related to the defect concentration, the excessive defect concentration would enhance the activation barrier for ion diffusion. Additionally, the immoderate surface trapping forces caused by defects can lead to difficulties in ion extraction, which is one of the reasons for the low coulombic efficiency.5 While the capacity of the plateau region can be effectively improved by adjusting the structure and volume of the pores, the capacity offered by plateau region would decay rapidly, which is contrary to excellent rate performance.20,21 More abundant active sites can be offered by the doping of covalent heteroatoms (N, O, S, and P). Notably, the stronger ability of surface trapping would be led by solely doping N atoms, but synergistically adjusting the role of heteroatoms is the key to enhancing the kinetics. It has been verified that the S element can synergize with N to obtain better kinetics of lithium–sulfur batteries, which is due to a lower charge transfer resistance and a lower activation energy obtained via co-doping.22 Furthermore, the original defects of the carbon matrix and the affinity between the electrode and the electrolyte can be modulated by heteroatoms, to give full play to the role of the pseudocapacitive mechanism.23–26 The reversible capacity, cycle life and rate capability of SIBs and PIBs can be promoted by the energy storage process based on pseudocapacitive reactions.27,28
Hitherto, the high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), fast kinetics, enduring cycle life, and low cost of precursors are all important factors for the potential application of SIB and PIB anode materials.29 Waste tires are the adjunctive castoff for the development of the motor vehicle industry, and the global annual volume of waste tires reaches 17 million tons.30 Data simulation predicts that the use of tires will reach 1.2 billion per year in 2030.31 The “black pollution” would be generated when the waste tires are recycled insufficiently or handled inappropriately. The main components of waste tires are natural rubber, more than 90 percent of which is polyisoprene.32 Simultaneously, some proteins (monomers such as alanine, leucine, and phenylalanine) also exist as additives. In addition, a small amount of sulfur is also added in tires, which makes rubber vulcanized for strong performance.33,34 The waste tires could be the promising raw material to fabricate the nitrogen/oxygen/sulfur tri-doped carbon matrix. The proper preparation method can retain the inherent heteroatom and avoid post-addition.
In this work, the waste tires were selected as the precursor to prepare HCs. Waste tires containing nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur were pyrolyzed in the range of 700–1100 °C. The N, O, S tri-doped hard carbon nanospheres (NOS-HCs) were obtained by thorough carbonization at high temperatures via Diels–Alder polymerization. The NOS-HCs with low crystallinity and turbine layer graphitic nanodomains were revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). It was confirmed that the N, O, and S were doped successfully from energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping. The obtained NOS-HCs possess a large interlayer spacing, abundant defects, active sites, and hierarchical micro/mesoporous structures. The HCs obtained at 900 °C (NOS-HC900) display the best electrochemical performance. For SIBs, it provides an initial charge capacity of 425.3 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and a reversible capacity of 402.5 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. The specific capacity of 315.1 mA h g−1 can be obtained at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1, which is due to the abundant active sites introduced by heteroatom doping. For PIBs, an initial charge capacity of 342.6 mA h g−1, a reversible capacity of 322.7 mA h g−1, and a good rate performance (231.7 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1) can be achieved at the same current densities as those of SIBs. Specifically, the pseudocapacitive mechanism was fully stimulated by the active sites, further resulting in the fast kinetic. Furthermore, the form of Na storage under a steady state was further investigated. The storage state of quasi-metallic Na was visually confirmed by XPS etching. Combining the results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it can be verified that Na is stored in NOS-HC900 by adsorption and weak intercalation behavior. In addition, the decline of rate performance caused by the storage form of pore-filling was well inhabited.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and sample preparation
Discarded tires gathered from the garage were repeatedly cleaned with absolute ethyl alcohol and deionized water to remove the impurities and greasy dirt on the surface. Subsequently, the waste tires were naturally dried and crushed, and the pretreated tire particles were carbonized at 700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C, 1000 °C, and 1100 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in an argon atmosphere and then kept at the corresponding temperatures for 2 h. After cooling down naturally, the products were ground and washed with 0.5 M dilute hydrochloric acid at constant stirring speed for 12 h. Then, the as-obtained products were washed with deionized water and ethanol alternately to reach a neutral pH to obtain carbon powders, which were denoted as NOS-HC700, NOS-HC800, NOS-HC900, NOS-HC1000 and NOS-HC1100, respectively.
2.2. Cell assembling and electrochemical tests
First, the NOS-HCs (active material), acetylene black (conductive agent) and polyvinylidene fluoride (battery grade PVDF) were well mixed in a ratio of 8:1:1 in the appropriate amount of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a uniform slurry. Then, the slurry was spread on a Cu foil as the anode current collector and dried at 70 °C for 12 h to obtain the working electrode. The average mass loading of active material was about 1.2–1.5 mg cm−2. For SIBs, the glass fiber (GF/A, Whatman) was used as the separator, and the electrolyte comprised 1.0 M NaClO4 in a mixed solution of ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1 in Vol) with 2.0% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). For PIBs, the electrolyte comprised 1.0 M KPF6 in a mixed solution of EC, DEC, and EMC (1:1:1 in Vol) with 0.5% FEC. The galvanostatic charge and discharge tests of the cells were carried out using a CT-4008T (NEWARE, Shenzhen) test system over a voltage window of 0.01–2.9 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (100 k Hz–0.01 Hz) and cyclic voltammetry (0.1–2.9 V) were performed using an electrochemical workstation (DONGHUA DH7000, Jiangsu). The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was carried out at a pulse current of 50 mA g−1 for 0.5 h, followed by 1 h relaxation.
2.3. Material characterizations
In this work, multiple characterization techniques were applied. The thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) test was carried out using a TGA/DSC 3 + (METTLER TOLEDO, Switzerland) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in an argon atmosphere from 25 °C to 900 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a PHI 5000 Versaprobe III (UIvac-Phi, Japan), which includes the spectra of surface composition and etching. The field-emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) images were obtained using a JIB-4700F (JOEL, Japan). In addition, the images of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping were recorded using a JEM-F200 (JOEL, Japan). The NOS-HCs were decentralized in ethanol and supported by carbon-coated copper grids. A D8-Advance (Bruker, Germany) X-ray diffractometer (XRD) was used to measure the XRD spectra with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a step speed of 0.06° in the 2θ range of 5–90°. A Raman spectrometer (Thermo Scientific DXR2xi, US) was used to characterize the crystal structure of NOS-HCs. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption tests were carried out using an ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics, US) to analyze and calculate the specific surface area and pore size distribution. The results for the surface area and pore size distribution were obtained based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model, respectively. For the electrode test after cycling, buckle cells were dismounted in an Ar-atmosphere glove box, and the electrodes were cleaned with DEC.
2.4. Theoretical calculation
The density functional theory (DFT) calculation of spin polarization was carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation (VASP) package, and the adsorption energies (Ea) of Na atom and solvated molecules in different environments were calculated. The wave potential was enhanced with a projector, and the plane wave cutoff was 400 eV. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was wielded in the simulation process. The k-point meshes were 3 × 3 × 1 for geometry optimizations. The criteria for lattice force and energy self-convergence were 0.02 eV Å−1 and 1 × 10−5 eV, respectively. The graphene structure based on 6 × 6 units simulated the local structure of NOS-HC900. The models were arranged periodically, and the influence of adjacent configurations was avoided through the vacuum zone (15°). The defect was constructed by directly deleting some graphite carbons or heteroatoms to replace the carbon atoms of primitive graphenes.
The calculation formula of adsorption energy (Ea) is shown as follows:Ea = Et − EHC − Eadswhere Et, EHC, and Eads represent the total energy of NOS-HC900 with adsorbates, primordial NOS-HC900, and single adsorbate, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
The percent conversion of the precursor was calculated using a TG analyzer in the argon atmosphere (Fig. S1†). For the precursor (waste tires), the rapid decline in weight occurred at 300–500 °C, and the yield of the prepared NOS-HCs reached 37.5%. This phenomenon is due to the complete decomposition of rubber and other organic additives below 500 °C, and the Diels–Alder polymerization and secondary carbonized reactions occur in the temperature range of 500–900 °C.35
The field-emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) images show that NOS-HCs are of an irregular 3D porous network connected by spherical nanoparticles (Fig. 1a and Fig. S2†). The abundant pores were formed by the disordered arrangement of dense nanoparticles, which provides abundant sites for Na (K) storage and shortens the diffusion distance upon the Na+ (K+) extraction and insertion. It was further confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) that NOS-HCs feature a porous structure with spherical particles (Fig. 1b and Fig. S3†). Interestingly, the HRTEM images disclose a graphite-like turbine layer structure, elucidating that NOS-HCs is amorphous. Fig. 1c implies discontinuous microcrystalline stripes in NOS-HC900, illustrating a certain degree of graphitization. The edges of NOS-HC900 have a more regular turbine layer, in which plenty of active sites are provided for ion storage.36 With the increase in pyrolysis temperature, the aggregation of nanoparticles is more obvious, which agrees with the SEM images. Meanwhile, the interlayer spacing of NOS-HCs also increases with the increase in temperature (the insets in Fig. S3†). The results of EDS mapping indicated that elements of C (80.3%), N (9.1%), O (6.9%), and S (3.7%) were uniformly distributed on the entire view field, signifying that N, O, and S were successfully doped into NOS-HC900 (Fig. 1d–h).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were carried out to characterize the structure of all the prepared samples. The XRD patterns of NOS-HCs display two broad diffraction peaks, where (002) located at 24.8° and (101) centered at 43.1° (Fig. 2a). It is suggested that NOS-HCs are amorphous with a disordered structure.37 Furthermore, the (002) peaks of NOS-HCs shift to a lower angle with the increase in pyrolysis temperature, which results from the increased lattice spacing. The lattice spacing was calculated by the Bragg law, and the calculated values are 0.371 nm, 0.380 nm, 0.392 nm, 0.395 nm, and 0.401 nm, respectively (Table S1†), which is consistent with the HRTEM images (Fig. 1c and Fig. S3†). The Raman spectra featured two characteristic peaks of all samples that centered at around 1350 cm−1 (D band) and 1592 cm−1 (G band) (Fig. 2b), which correspond to the disordered characteristics of sp3 carbons and the graphitic structural signal of sp2 carbons, respectively.38,39 The intensity ratios of the D band and G band (ID/IG) are 0.93, 0.99, 1.02, 1.05, and 1.10 for NOS-HC700, NOS-HC800, NOS-HC900, NOS-HC1000, and NOS-HC1100, respectively, indicating that the increasing degree of disorder in NOS-HCs is caused by the increase in pyrolysis temperature. The detailed microstructure of NOS-HCs is reflected by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The typical IV isotherm curves between 0.1 and 1.0 P/P0 (Fig. S4†) are recognized as the coexistence of microspores and mesoporous in the NOS-HCs. The BET surface area values of 60.1 m2 g−1, 57.7 m2 g−1, 55.8 m2 g−1, 49.9 m2 g−1, and 45.1 m2 g−1 were obtained for NOS-HCs at different temperatures, which decreases with the increase in temperature (Table S1†). It is further exhibited from the pore size distribution curves that NOS-HCs possess micropores and mesopores (Fig. 2c). The pore size is mainly distributed at 1.3–5 nm. The pore size of micropores is centered at about 1.1 nm, while that of the mesopores is at about 3.2 nm. The concentrated distribution of micro/mesoporous is conducive to the rapid migration of charges at the electrode interface.40

Furthermore, the elemental compositions of NOS-HCs were revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S5a and b and Table S2†). Fig. S5a† shows that the peaks of N, O and S decrease with the increase in pyrolysis temperature. The element content of NOS-HCs was further determined using an element analyzer (EuroEA 3000, Italy) (Table S3†), which confirmed that the element content of N, O and S decreased with the increase in pyrolysis temperature. The C–C bond appears at 284.8 eV with a clear peak (Fig. S5c†). In the N 1s spectrum, the successively enhanced binding energies of 398.5 eV, 400.9 eV, and 402.7 eV are related to pyridine N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively (Fig. 2d). The fast kinetics of the capacitive process is induced by the abundance of N species, which improves the electronic conductivity of NOS-HC900.18 Moreover, in the O 1s spectrum, the binding energies of 531.8 eV, 533.1 eV, and 534.6 eV prove the existence of CO (carbonyl group), C–O–C (ether group), and COOH (carboxyl group) (Fig. 2e).41 The oxygen groups with a high content facilitate the surface wettability of NOS-HC900, and thereby, enhance its absorption of electrolytes.42 For the S 2p spectrum, the characteristic peaks are located at 164.3 eV and 165 eV, corresponding to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks of the C–S–C covalent bond, respectively (Fig. 2f). It is reported that the C–S–C covalent bond may regulate the interaction between Na (K) and the carbon matrix with improved efficiency.43,44 Simultaneously, the peak related to the C–SO2–C bond appears at 169.0 eV, which is caused by the compound pyrolysis at high temperatures and further leads to the fast reaction kinetics of Na+/K+.45
The NOS-HCs as anodes were assembled in cells to evaluate Na storage performance. As shown in Fig. 3a, it can be found that the formation of the solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) leads to a distinct discharge plateau at around 1.23 V. The charge and discharge specific capacities of NOS-HC900 were 425.3 mA h g−1 and 980.5 mA h g−1, with a coulombic efficiency of 43.3%. The charging capacity of NOS-HC900 is higher than that of NOS-HC700 (273.6 mA h g−1), NOS-HC800 (320.2 mA h g−1), NOS-HC1000 (377.9 mA h g−1), and NOS-HC1100 (299.9 mA h g−1). Based on the higher capacity of NOS-HC900, in-depth electrochemical tests were carried out for NOS-HC900. Fig. S6a† reflects the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of NOS-HC900 from the 1st to 10th cycle at 100 mA g−1. The discharge plateau at 1.23 V disappears, and the specific capacity tends to be stabilized after the 1st cycle, indicating that the irreversible capacity loss is due to the formation of SEI. After the deep cycles, NOS-HC900 maintains an excellent reversible capacity of 402 mA h g−1 and a coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% (Fig. 3b), exhibiting excellent cycling stability. The rate performance of NOS-HC900 at different current densities from 100 to 2000 mA g−1 is displayed in Fig. 3c, corresponding to the reversible capacities of 421.1, 375.1, 352.7, 341.5, 332.3, and 315.0 mA h g−1 at 100, 200, 500, 800, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the specific capacity remains at 405.6 mA h g−1 when the current density returns to 100 mA g−1. It is suggested that a high reversible specific capacity can be achieved upon the high current density, which is probably attributed to the active sites provided by heteroatoms of N, O, and S. By comparing the sodium storage properties of different carbon-based materials in recent years (Table S4†), it can be found that NOS-HC900 has pretty excellent sodium storage properties.

To further understand the kinetic mechanism of NOS-HC900, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed. The EIS of NOS-HC900 after cycling was tested. The impedance spectra of different samples were fitted using an equivalent circuit. It is shown in Fig. 3d that all samples have a clear semicircle in the high-frequency region, corresponding to the SEI membrane resistance (RSEI) and charge transfer resistance (Rct). An inclined line is present in the low-frequency region, which is related to the solid-state diffusion of Na+.46,47 Compared with the uncycled state (198.4 Ω), the Rct (93.6 Ω) decreased dramatically after 10 cycles, and it tended to be stable after 50 cycles, which is attributed to the activation of the electrode material during repeated charging and discharging (process) (Table S5†). However, the decrease in diffusion rate is caused by the forming of the SEI layer. The CV spectra of NOS-HC900 were tested at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 3e). The two obvious cathodic peaks lie at around 0.45 V and 0.9 V in the 1st cycle and disappear in the following cycles for the reasons of the SEI formation and the decomposition of the electrolyte.48 The curves of the subsequent two cycles almost overlap. Two broad peaks in the range of 0.4–1.2 V are attributed to Na deintercalation and intercalation, proving the excellent reversible behavior of NOS-HC900.49 To further research the Na storage mechanism of NOS-HC900, the CV test was performed at scan rates of 0.1–10 mV s−1 (Fig. 3f). The shape of the CV curves remains analogous outline with the increase in scanning rates, and the storage mechanism was analyzed using the power-law equation (i(v) = avb). The functional relationship is composed of current (i) and scanning rate (v), and the b value can be calculated by linearly fitting the relationship between log(i) and log(v) (Fig. 3g). The corresponding b values of the anode and cathode are 0.81 and 0.96, respectively, indicating that the process is dominated by a capacitive-controlled process and powered by active site adsorption of N, O, and S.50 To quantify the capacitance contribution ratio, the value can be gained by the equation i(v) = k1v + k2v1/2. k1v and k2v1/2 are impacted by the capacitive behavior and the diffusion behavior, respectively. According to the calculated results shown in Fig. 3h and i, NOS-HC900 reveals that the capacitive contribution rate is 75.3% at a scanning rate of 2 mV s−1. The capacitance contributions are 52.1%, 60.7%, 63.5%, 68.6%, 75.3%, 84.7%, and 94.1% at different scanning rates from 0.1 mV s−1 to 10 mV s−1, which suggests that the storage mechanism is dominated by the fast capacitive-controlled process.
The NOS-HC900 was further matched with Na vanadium phosphate (NVP) to assemble the full cell. The charge–discharge specific capacities of the 1st cycle are 120.9 mA h g−1 and 108.1 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.5 C, corresponding to the coulombic efficiency of 89.3% (Fig. 4a). The rate performance of the full cell is displayed in Fig. 4b. The reversible capacities are 103.18, 91.25, 82.68, 65.75, and 45.02 mA h g−1 at rates of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 C. More excitingly, when the cycle number increases to 500, the discharge-specific capacity of 99.3 mA h g−1 can be achieved (Fig. 4c). It is confirmed that the NOS-HC900 can be successfully applied to full cells with excellent cycling performance and rate performance. The above-mentioned performance evaluation confirms the successful application of NOS-900 in full cells (Fig. 4d).

The same NOS-HCs were also used as anodes for PIBs. It is indicated by the initial GCD curves in Fig. 5a that the best capacity is also provided by NOS-HC900. The charge and discharge capacity are 245.5 and 678.1 mA h g−1 for NOS-HC700, 267.2 and 794.6 mA h g−1 for NOS-HC800, 342.6 and 900.5 mA h g−1 for NOS-HC900, 301.7 and 861.5 mA h g−1 for NOS-HC1000, and 282.1 and 812.9 mA h g−1 for NOS-HC1100, respectively. Excitingly, NOS-HC900 possesses extremely stable cycle life (Fig. 5b). The specific charge capacity of 322.7 mA h g−1 and CE of 98.8% can be obtained after 1000 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Besides, the impressive rate performance of NOS-HC900 is gained. As shown in Fig. 5c, the high reversible capacities of 323.1, 298.5, 287.6, 265.3, 252.3, and 231.7 mA h g−1 can be maintained at current densities of 100, 200, 500, 800, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. The performance of other carbon-based materials in recent years is summarized in Table S6,† which demonstrates the excellent electrochemical performance of NOS-HC900. Fig. 5d shows the results of EIS analysis after different cycles, and the specific fitting data are shown in Table S5.† The Rs, RSEI, and Rct of NOS-HC900 are 18.1, 82.5, and 1580.2 Ω for the uncycled state, 48.2, 158.1, and 369.5 Ω for 100 cycles, respectively (Table S5†). It is similar to the EIS result of SIBs, where RSEI increases after cycling and Rct decreases as the material is activated. The CV curves of the initial cubic cycles are shown in Fig. 5e. In the first cycle, the obvious cathode peaks are located at around 0.6 and 1.1 V, corresponding to the two plateau regions of the first discharge curve. This phenomenon is attributed to the formation of SEI and the decomposition of electrolytes.51 The CV curves of the second and third cycles almost coincide, indicating the good cyclic stability of NOS-HC900. To further explore the energy storage mechanism of NOS-HC900, CV tests were carried out at different rates. The CV curve with scan rates of 0.1–10 mV is shown in Fig. 5f, which shows no obvious polarization as the scan rate increases. The cathodic and anodic peaks correspond to b values of 0.94 and 0.86, respectively (Fig. 5g), indicating that K storage relies heavily on pseudocapacitive control procedures.52 The capacitance contribution at a rate of 2 mV s−1 is 79.5% (Fig. 5h). In addition, the capacitance contribution will increase with the increase in the scan rate, and the corresponding capacitance contribution rate increased from 44.2% to 95.8% when the sweep speed increased from 0.1 mV s−1 to 10 mV s−1 (Fig. 5i).

Subsequently, NOS-HC900 after cycling was discharged to 0.01 V, and its microstructure was observed by SEM and TEM (Fig. S6†). The typical spherical particles can be observed intuitively via SEM images. The reduced morphological clarity verifies that a stable SEI film formed on the sphere's surface. Additionally, the HETEM images confirm that NOS-HC900 still presents a graphite-like domain turbine layer structure after repeated Na (K) insertion and removal (Fig. 6a and c). The layer spacing after Na or K is of 0.401 nm and 0.403 nm, respectively, suggesting that the structure was not damaged. The EDS spectra further confirm the successful insertion of Na and K (Fig. 6b and d). As expected, the stable structure of the material lays the foundation for long cycle life.

The solvated molecules adsorbed on functionalized carbon: (e) N, O and S tri-doping and (f) N and O co-doping. 
Besides, based on the similar physicochemical properties of Na and K, SIBs are taken as an example to discuss the storage mechanism in detail. The fast reaction dynamics induced by heteroatoms were further explored by DFT. Taking the effect of the electrolyte solvent into account, a realistic microsolvation environment was modeled (Fig. S7†). The Na atom was solvated by three explicit EC molecules and interacted with NOS-HC900. The edge positions of HCs are reasonable sites for heteroatom doping due to their large transmutable range. Notably, moderate adsorption energy is the key to efficient migration. The heteroatoms could be integrated with the edges of the zigzag, armchair, and interior defect. However, the stronger binding energy is offered by zigzag edges, and the weaker binding energy is originated from armchair edges. The interior defects are between the two above-mentioned geometries, providing reasonable adsorption energy.22 Comparing the calculated results of adsorption energies, it can be found that a stronger adsorption energy of −2.367 eV is generated by the structure of non-doped S. S offers a regulating effect on the capture force, and the N, O, and S tri-doping system provides a lower adsorption energy of −1.452 eV (Fig. 6e and f). The weakening of the surface trapping force further provides a fast migration rate, leading to excellent rate performance. It is also confirmed from this phenomenon that most of the capacity is provided by surface activity, namely, the pseudocapacitive mechanism. Due to the similar physicochemical properties, it can be inferred that the adsorption of K onto the surface of NOS-HC900 can also be weakened, thus giving full play to the function of the pseudocapacitance mechanism.
It is generally believed that the behavior of Na storage in HCs comprises a sloping line in the high-potential region and a plateau in the low-potential region, which includes three different forms of adsorption on active sites, insertion of carbon layers, and pore-filling.5 The storage of potassium usually depends on adsorption and intercalation. Interestingly, the conventional plateau region of low voltage is not reflected from the discharge curve after a long cycle (Fig. S8a and b†). It is suggested that the storage of both Na and K might not have occurred in the pores of hard carbons.53 The GITT test was carried out to verify the Na storage mechanism of NOS-HC900 at a current density of 50 mA g−1. The diffusion coefficient was calculated based on Fick's second law:  
The specific values of ΔEs and ΔEt were calculated from the GITT test results (Fig. S9a and b†). In addition, the results of diffusion coefficients are shown in Fig. 7a. The diffusion coefficients are relatively large and can be divided into two stages. It does not change obviously in the initial stage of discharge and decreases significantly below 0.55 V, indicating two different mechanisms that are applied to the storage behaviors of Na.54

The specific storage behavior of Na in NOS-HC900 was further explored by DFT. The internal defect was introduced into pristine two-layer graphene,55 constructing a reasonable model of NOS-HC900 (Fig. S10†). The desolvation of a solvated molecule (ion-solvent) occurs first on the SEI surface, and then Na migrates to different sites (surface, interlayer, and pore) inside the structure of NOS-HC900.56 The storage of Na through the surface, interlayer and pores was reacted by calculating the adsorption energy. A smaller Ea indicates a stronger adsorption energy, which means Na is preferable to be stored. According to the calculation result, the values of Ea are −2.31 eV, −2.27 eV, and −1.65 eV, respectively (Fig. 7f), which correspond to adsorption, intercalation and pore-filling of Na. It can be summarized that the behaviors of adsorption and intercalation are more likely to occur in NOS-HC900.
The etching of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed to further elucidate the Na storage mechanism in NOS-HC900. For comparison, the specific chemical compositions of the electrodes after 3 cycles and 300 cycles were analyzed. The spectra and specific binding energies of Na 1s, C 1s and O 1s are shown in Fig. 7b–e and Table S7.† Specifically, according to the Na 1s spectrum after 3 cycles (Fig. 7b), the peak at 1070.8 eV could be attributed to the ingredient of C–O–Na,57 which is derived from the SEI on the surface of NOS-HC900. The etched NOS-HC900 electrode shows a similar shape and position of this peak (Fig. 7c). In addition, the existing form of Na at a steady state can be obtained from the result after 300 cycles. The binding energy of the C–O–Na bond is not biased towards the bonding site of metallic Na (1071.7 eV) and decreases with the increase in etching depth from 15 to 30 nm. The metallic Na is not present in NOS-HC900, suggesting the absence of hole-filling in the entire electrochemical process.57,58 Na is stored in NOS-HC900 in the form of a weaker binding energy than C–O–Na. Besides, the C 1s spectrum shows four peaks at around 288.4 eV (RCO3), 286.0 eV (C–O), 284.4 eV (C–C, C–H) and 283.5 eV (Nax–HC) (Fig. 7d and e), which are related to the sodiated NOS-HC900 and the decomposition of the electrolyte.59,60 The Nax–HC peaks fed back by different electrodes were further analyzed. When the electrode has been cycled three times, the peaks of Nax–HC located at 283.1 eV, 283.0 eV and 282.9 eV correspond to etching depths of 0 nm, 15 nm, and 30 nm, respectively (Fig. 7d). After 300 cycles, the Nax–HC peaks appear at 283.5 eV, 282.9 eV and 282.8 eV with the increase in etching depth (Fig. 7e). It is similar to the above-mentioned phenomenon of Na 1s spectral feedback, the storage of Na in the non-steady state behaves similarly in the interior and surface, which may be since the SEI does not reach the steady state. At steady state, it reflects that with the increase in etching depth, the binding energy of Nax–HC also maintains a weakening trend. However, the intensity of Nax–HC enhances strongly, which is attributed to the thicker SEI layer and the sufficient sodiation of NOS-HC900.61 There are a large number of unsaturated carbon atoms passivated by hydrogen atoms at the defect. In addition, the S atoms rationally tune the adsorption strength of the active site, which leads to a large amount of Na being concentrated at the defect edges. That is why a large amount of Nax–HC is formed in NOS-HC900. The Na storage at the edge of the defect has a way of adsorption and further intercalation between layers adjacent to the defect (weak intercalation), which leads to the discharge curve without a plateau region. The contribution to capacity is provided by the weak intercalation, corresponding to the results of GITT and theoretical calculations. Similarly, the storage of K is also mainly driven by the surface of the capacitive-controlled process. Therefore, the storage mechanism of Na is also expected to be applicable to the fast kinetics of K storage. PIBs can well maintain the structural stability via the behavior of weak intercalation, which makes the stable cyclic performance and fast kinetics obtained.
Briefly, HCs with the graphite-like turbine-layered structure were obtained by pyrolysis of waste tires at 900 °C (Fig. 8). Polymers based on the monomer polyisoprene are reliable sources of carbon skeletons. The inherent nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur in waste tires were successfully doped into the carbon skeleton during the carbonization process. Sulfur modulates the strong surface trapping force caused by nitrogen and oxygen. The moderate adsorption and weak intercalation of Na (K) at the defects are induced while the mobility of solvated molecules was enhanced.

4. Conclusions
In summary, based on the inherent composition of waste tires, N, O, S tri-doped hard carbon nanospheres (NOS-HCs) with enlarged interlayer spacing, hierarchical micro/mesoporous and enriched active sites have been successfully obtained via simple regulation of pyrolysis. The in situ-generated NOS-HC900 expresses a hierarchical porous nanostructure of graphite-like turbine layers, high reversible specific capacity, great rate capability, and excellent cycling stability, which are revealed when it is applied as the anode of SIBs and PIBs. The kinetics analysis of CV reveals that NOS-HC900 has a stable driving process of surface capacitance, which effectively improves the rate capability and cycle life. Fast surface-dominant processes benefit from the concentrated distribution of micro/mesopores and co-regulation of N, O and S. Moreover, the results of GITT, XPS etching and DFT calculations evidence the Na storage mechanism of NOS-HC900 based on the behavior of weak intercalation, which can be analogized to K storage. Na and K rely on the adsorption to combine with the reactive sites at the edge of the defect, and further intercalate between the layers, suggesting that Na and K are stored in NOS-HC900 under a form of quasi-ionic bond with a lower binding energy. The Na and K storage mechanism mainly depends on the synergy effect of the large interlayer spacing and abundant active sites, resulting in an excellent capacity contribution and fast kinetics. This work offers a simple way to design a heteroatom-doped material of HCs and provides a reliable idea for the development of new carbon anodes for sodium and potassium storage.
