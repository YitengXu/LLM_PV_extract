    , Accepted 14th May 2015First published on 15th May 2015AbstractThe low photocatalytic activity of single semiconductor photocatalysts mainly originates from their fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Constructing nanosheet-based composite photocatalysts is an effective way to enhance the charge separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In this work, AgI-decorated β-Bi2O3 nanosheet heterostructured photocatalysts were prepared by a facile method. The as-obtained AgI/β-Bi2O3 heterostructures exhibited enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of methyl orange (MO) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) in aqueous solution. The optimum photocatalytic activity of 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 for the degradation of MO was about 4.1 and 6.2 times higher than that of AgI and β-Bi2O3. The photocatalytic activity enhancement of AgI/β-Bi2O3 heterostructures could be ascribed to the formation of a Z-scheme system, which results in the efficient space separation of photo-induced charge carriers.
1. Introduction
Searching and optimizing visible-light-driven photocatalysts with high performance is of great importance for their potential application in solar energy conversion and environmental purification since visible light accounts for about 43% of the total radiation emitted by the solar spectrum.1–5 Bismuth oxide, a p-type semiconductor, appears to be a promising alternative due to its small band gap (∼2.8 eV), high oxidation power of valence holes, and non-toxic properties.6–9 Bi2O3 has many polymorphs, including the α- (monoclinic), β- (tetragonal), γ- (body-centered cubic), δ-(face-centered cubic), and ω- (triclinic) phases.10 Among these, tetragonal β-Bi2O3 was reported to have better photocatalytic performance due to its smaller band gap, which could induce stronger absorption in the visible light region.11,12 However, like many other semiconductors, the fast recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes is one of the main drawbacks that restricts the photocatalytic efficiency of pure β-Bi2O3. In order to further improve the photocatalytic efficiency of Bi2O3, various methods have been developed, such as construction of heterojunctions with other semiconductors, morphology and surface modification of Bi2O3.13–15 Especially, constructing heterojunctions between Bi2O3 and other semiconductors with matched band-edges is highly desirable because of their ability to enhance the charge separation efficiency. In this regard, a large number of Bi2O3-based heterojunctions, such as Bi2O3/Bi2WO6,16–18 Bi2O3/BiVO4,19,20 Bi2O3/Co3O4,21 Bi2O3/TiO2,22 Bi2O3/BaTiO3,23 BiOCl/Bi2O3,24 Fe3O4/Bi2O325 and Bi2O3/ZnO,26 have been developed to improve photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3. Recently, silver halide-based nanoparticles have been demonstrated as a class of highly efficient promising visible-light-response photocatalysts for organic pollutants.27–30 They also act as excellent sensitizers to modify wide-gap semiconductors to become visible-light responsive.31,32
Recently, two-dimensional (2D) inorganic nanosheets have drawn substantial research interest in photocatalysis due to their unique 2D geometry with outstanding electronic properties and high specific surface area, which could provide a large amount of reaction sites and enable rapid charge generation and transport.33–36 Various semiconducting metal oxide photocatalysts, such as layered metal oxides, double hydroxides, and transition metal chalcogenide nanosheets, are being extensively investigated.37–42 For example, Hu and co-workers recently reported the synthesis of 2D β-Bi2O3 nanosheets enclosed by the {001} facets with enhanced photocatalytic activity.43 By introducing the upconversion element erbium, the Bi2O3 nanosheets exhibited an enhanced photoactivity. However, much less attention has been paid to constructing Bi2O3 nanosheet-based heterojunction photocatalysts, which could provide abundant coupling interfaces due to their large surface area and structural features of 2D Bi2O3 nanosheets. Construction of a novel heterojunction with superior activity by using 2D Bi2O3 nanosheets as the support for the dispersed silver halide nanoparticles is desirable for achieving efficient visible-light-induced photocatalysts.
In this work, we constructed a novel AgI/β-Bi2O3 nanocomposite by the facile precipitation method at room temperature. The photocatalytic activity of AgI/β-Bi2O3 nanocomposites was evaluated by the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) dye and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). The as-prepared AgI/β-Bi2O3 nanocomposite exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activities for MO and TC degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these improved photocatalytic performances should be attributed to the fabrication of a direct Z-scheme system of AgI/β-Bi2O3, which can result in a more efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers. This work will provide new insights into the design of high-performance Bi2O3 nanosheet-based Z-scheme photocatalysts for efficient degradation of organic pollutants.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of β-Bi2O3 nanosheets
Bismuth nitrate hexahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, AR), silver nitrate (AgNO3, AR), potassium iodide (KI, AR), acetic acid and absolute ethanol were used as received without any further purification. Deionized water was also used in all the experiments. β-Bi2O3 nanosheets were synthesized via a previously reported hydrothermal method with some minor modifications.43 Briefly, 4 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was first dissolved in 5 mL of acetic acid. After complete dissolution, 35 mL of absolute ethanol was added into the above solution under vigorous stirring. The resulting solution was then transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, followed by heating at 180 °C for 20 h. Subsequently, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The final gray product was separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol three times and dried at 60 °C in air. Finally, the as-obtained precursor powder was calcined at 400 °C for 4 h at a rate of 5 °C min−1.
2.2 Preparation of AgI/β-Bi2O3 composites
As a typical preparation of the AgI/β-Bi2O3 composite, 0.2 g of β-Bi2O3 was added to an aqueous solution containing a certain amount of Ag(NO3). The mixture was dispersed by ultrasonication for 20 min; a certain amount of 0.01 mol L−1 of KI aqueous solution was added into the mixture under vigorous stirring in the dark. After stirring for 4 h, the AgI/β-Bi2O3 composite was separated by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol, then dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h before further characterization. To investigate the role of the composition in the photocatalytic performances, the amounts of Ag(NO3) and KI were varied to obtain AgI/β-Bi2O3 heterojunctions with mass ratios of 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, and the samples were labeled as 5%-AgI/β-Bi2O3, 10%-AgI/β-Bi2O3, 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3, 30%-AgI/β-Bi2O3, and 40%-AgI/β-Bi2O3, respectively. For comparison, pure AgI was synthesized by adopting the above-mentioned method in the absence of β-Bi2O3.
2.3 Characterization
The phase purity and crystal structure of the obtained samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a JEOL-JEM-2010 (JEOL, Japan) operating at 200 kV. Surface analysis of the sample was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an ESCA PHI500 spectrometer. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer equipped with a spherical diffuse reflectance accessory. The surface areas of the samples were measured by using a TriStar II 3020-BET/BJH Surface Area. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the photocatalyst were recorded by using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 270 nm.
2.4 Photocatalytic activity
Photocatalytic activity of the sample was evaluated by the degradation of MO in aqueous solution (10 mg L−1) under irradiation of a 500 W tungsten light lamp. 0.030 g of photocatalyst was suspended into 60 mL of the above MO solution. Prior to irradiation, the suspension was magnetically stirred for 1 h in the dark to ensure that the MO could reach the absorption–desorption equilibrium on the photocatalyst surface. Furthermore, all the experiments were performed at 25 °C under constant stirring. During every irradiation interval, about 4 mL of aliquots were sampled and centrifuged to remove the particles. The filtrates were analyzed by using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer and the characteristic absorption peak of MO at 464 nm was used to determine the extent of its degradation. Photocatalytic activity of the sample was also evaluated by the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC, 30 mL, 7.3 mol L−1) in aqueous solution under irradiation of a 500 W tungsten light lamp with a 400 nm cutoff filter. The concentrations of TC were monitored using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer according to its characteristic absorption peak at 356 nm.
2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode, single-compartment quartz cell on an electrochemical station (CHI 760D Chenhua Instrument Company). For the preparation of working electrodes, 12 mg of the sample and 200 μL of 10 wt% of the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder in the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent were mixed under vigorous stirring to form a homogeneous slurry and then 20 μL of the slurry was spread on a FTO glass electrode (1 × 1 cm2). Electrochemical measurements were taken by using an electrochemical analyzer in a standard three electrode system with a platinum plate as the counter electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. A 300 W Xe arc lamp was utilized as the light source. A 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase structures and morphology
XRD was used to identify and determine the structure and the phase purity of the as-prepared samples. The XRD patterns of the pure β-Bi2O3, AgI and AgI/β-Bi2O3 composites with different AgI contents are given in Fig. 1. X-ray reflections (Fig. 1a) of the pure AgI correlate closely with the cubic phase of miersite AgI (space group F3m (216), JCPDS card no. 78-0641). Similarly, as shown in Fig. 1g, all the diffraction peaks can be readily indexed to the standard of β-Bi2O3 (space group p21c (114), JCPDS card no. 78-1793). For the AgI/β-Bi2O3 composites (Fig. 1b–f), it can be seen that all the diffraction peaks are undoubtedly indexed to the AgI or β-Bi2O3, indicating the formation of AgI/β-Bi2O3 composites.

The morphology and microscopic structure information of the pure β-Bi2O3 and AgI/β-Bi2O3 with different AgI contents were characterized by TEM analysis. The TEM image in Fig. 2a demonstrates that the pure β-Bi2O3 sample features a typical two-dimensional nanosheet structure. The images in Fig. 2b–f for the AgI/β-Bi2O3 composites clearly present that the AgI nanoparticles with sizes of around 5–20 nm were nicely deposited on the β-Bi2O3 nanosheet surface, forming an intimate interfacial contact between AgI and β-Bi2O3 nanosheets. No apparent aggregation of the AgI nanoparticles was discerned, suggesting that the 2D β-Bi2O3 nanosheet can serve as a good support for the loading of AgI nanoparticles in the composites. The HRTEM image of the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 is given in Fig. S1.† Two different sets of lattice fringes are clearly seen. The lattice spacing of ca. 0.274 nm is ascribed to the (220) crystallographic plane of β-Bi2O3. Meanwhile, the lattice spacing of ca. 0.229 nm matches the (220) crystallographic plane of AgI.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to further study the surface elemental composition of the system. The typical full survey and high-resolution spectra for the Ag 3d, I 3d, and Bi 4f regions of the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 composite are shown in Fig. 3. The survey spectrum in Fig. 3a shows the presence of Bi, O, Ag, and I. C 1s peaks of the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 are ascribed to adventitious hydrocarbon from an XPS instrument itself. The binding energies obtained in XPS analysis were corrected for specimen charging by referencing C 1s to 284.6 eV. As shown in Fig. 3b, two strong peaks located at approximately 368.1 and 374.1 eV were assigned to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively. In Fig. 3c, the two peaks at 619.3 and 631.1 eV can be attributed to I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2, respectively. Fig. 3d shows the XPS spectra of Bi 4f, where the peaks at 164.3 and 159.0 eV can be assigned to 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 spectra of Bi3+ in the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3. The O 1s spectra of 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 are shown in Fig. S2,† it can be deconvoluted into three peaks located at 529.8, 531.0 and 533.0 eV, respectively. The former binding energy peak corresponds to the O 1s core level of the O2− anion in the β-Bi2O3 crystal lattice.44 The latter binding energy peaks are attributed to surface contamination, such as residual OH− and absorbed H2O.44,45

3.2 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and band gap

Fig. 4a presents the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of β-Bi2O3 nanosheets, AgI, and AgI/β-Bi2O3 composites. The AgI sample has an absorption edge at about 470 nm, while the β-Bi2O3 nanoplate sample has a broader absorption in visible light with an absorbance edge at 547 nm. The absorption edges of the composite samples shift to longer wavelengths as the amount of β-Bi2O3 increases, which can be clearly reflected by the color change of the as-prepared sample powder (see the digital pictures in Fig. 4a, inset). The energy level and band gap of the semiconductors play a crucial role in determining their physical properties. The band gap energy of a semiconductor can be calculated by the following formula: αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2(1)where α, h, v, Eg and A are the absorption coefficient, Planck constant, light frequency, band gap energy, and a constant, respectively.46 Among them, n is determined from the type of optical transition of a semiconductor (n = 1 for direct transition and n = 4 for indirect transition). For AgI and β-Bi2O3, the value of n is 1 for the direct transition. Therefore, the band gap energy (Eg value) of the resulting samples can be estimated from a plot of (αhν)2versus photon energy (hν). The intercept of the tangent to the X axis would give a good approximation of the band gap energy of the samples. The band gap energy of β-Bi2O3 is approximately 2.42 eV. Accordingly, the Eg of AgI was found to be 2.77 eV according to a plot of (αhν)2versus energy (hν) (Fig. 4b). All the values for the band gaps of β-Bi2O3 and AgI are very close to previously reported results.10,27 The band gap of the AgI/β-Bi2O3 composite ranged from 2.42 to 2.77 eV, and increases with the increased AgI content from 5 to 40%.

3.3 Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared AgI/β-Bi2O3 nanophotocatalysts was examined by visible-light degradation of MO molecules in aqueous solution, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. The time-dependent absorption spectra of MO solutions under visible light illumination in the presence of pure β-Bi2O3 nanosheets, AgI, and 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 are first shown in Fig. 5a–c. The absorbance of MO in pure β-Bi2O3 nanosheet suspensions under visible-light irradiation is hardly changed (Fig. 5a). The bare AgI could degrade MO by 57.8% after 240 min under visible light irradiation (Fig. 5b). In contrast, a sharp decrease in MO absorption at 464 nm was observed in the photodegradation of MO mediated by the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 sample. The 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 nanophotocatalyst could degrade MO by 97.8% after 240 min under visible light irradiation (Fig. 5c), indicating that the AgI/β-Bi2O3 heterostructure exhibits higher photocatalytic efficiency for MO degradation.

Fig. 5d compares the photocatalytic activities of different catalysts in the degradation of MO under visible light irradiation. The direct noncatalytic photolysis of MO was tested under the same conditions, and the result shows that the photolysis of MO was negligible. Upon formation of a heterojunction with AgI, the photocatalytic activity of the β-Bi2O3 nanosheets was greatly enhanced. When the optimum content of AgI was 20%, the best photocatalytic activity of AgI/β-Bi2O3 was obtained. On increasing AgI contents from 5 to 40%, the photocatalytic activity of AgI/β-Bi2O3 first increased and then decreased. These changes in the photocatalytic activity could be understood by considering the synergetic effects of light absorption and the heterojunction structure of AgI/β-Bi2O3. As the AgI content increased, the visible light absorption of AgI/β-Bi2O3 strengthened and generated more electron–hole pairs, contributing to the separation of electron–hole pairs. However, when the AgI content was above the optimal value, the efficient interface did not increase significantly whereas the excessive narrow band-gap AgI could act as the recombination center of electrons and holes. Consequently, the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs decreased and further restrained the photocatalytic activity. As a control, we also tested the photocatalytic activity of the mechanical mixture of AgI/β-Bi2O3 with 20% of AgI. Notably, we found that the photocatalytic activity of the mechanical mixture is significantly lower than that of the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 sample, which was prepared by the precipitation method. This result confirms that the formation of an intact interface structure between the AgI and β-Bi2O3 is the crucial parameter for the high photocatalytic activity of the resulting nanocomposite samples.
To further understand the reaction kinetics of MO degradation, the apparent pseudo-first-order model expressed by using eqn (2) was applied in the experiments: ln(C/C0) = kappt(2)where C is the concentration of the MO at time t, C0 is the initial concentration of the MO solution, and the slope k is the apparent reaction rate constant. In Fig. 6, the results imply that k values for all AgI/β-Bi2O3 samples are higher than those of AgI and β-Bi2O3. It can be found that the kapp of 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 (0.0128 min−1) is about 4.1 times that of AgI (0.00309 min−1) and about 6.2 times that of β-Bi2O3 (0.00205 min−1).

As a broad-spectrum antibiotic agent, tetracycline hydrochoride (TC) have been widely used for treating bacterial infections. The presence of TC in the natural environment generates several human health concerns. The toxicity tests reveal that it may cause various adverse effects of the ecosystem by inducing proliferation of bacterial drug resistance.47 Hence, it is of great important for the removal of TC. The comparison of the photocatalytic degradation of TC in the presence of β-Bi2O3 nanosheets, AgI, and 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 hybrid materials under visible light irradiation is shown in Fig. 7. TC was photodegraded slowly in the presence of pure AgI and β-Bi2O3 under visible light. Only 46% and 70% of TC were photodegraded after irradiation for 120 min, respectively. In contrast, the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 composite photocatalysts showed highest activity, which could reach 80% when the irradiation time extended to 120 min, confirming that the resulting 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 composite shows superior photocatalytic activity towards the photodegradation of TC.

3.4 Mechanism of MO photocatalytic degradation
It has been reported that the ˙O2−, h+, and ˙OH are the major reactive species for the photocatalytic oxidation of organic dyes.48–50 In order to distinguish the roles of the reactive species, the scavenger investigation was performed over 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 by adding different scavengers, such as tert-butanol (t-BuOH), ammonium oxalate (AO) and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), for the detection of the hydroxyl radical (˙OH) scavenger, hole (h+) scavenger and superoxide (˙O2−), respectively. As shown in Fig. 8, with 1 mmol of tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH) as a ˙OH scavenger added to the solution, the degradation rate of MO over the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 sample is not obviously decreased, indicating the absence of ˙OH radical species in the reaction system. When 1 mmol of AO as a scavenger for h+ radical species was added, the degradation of MO was significantly depressed, indicating that the h+ was involved in the degradation of MO. Notably, with the addition of 1 mmol of ˙O2− scavenger BQ, the degradation of MO was also significantly depressed, suggesting that the ˙O2− pathways have a crucial role in the process of MO oxidation. To further confirm this result, a N2 purging experiment was conducted compared with air-equilibrated conditions. As shown in Fig. 8, the removal efficiency of MO is obviously inhibited by conducting N2 (0 scavenger, N2); the degradation rate of MO was remarkably decreased compared with that under air-equilibrated conditions (0 scavenger), which shows that dissolved oxygen which can act as a photogenerated electron scavenger to give ˙O2− radical species is pivotal for the MO degradation. Based on the results, it is clear that h+ and ˙O2− are the major reactive species in the AgI/β-Bi2O3 reaction system.

3.5 Mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity
It is generally accepted that photocatalytic activity is mainly governed by light-absorption ability, surface properties (including adsorption property, specific surface area, etc.), and photogenerated charge-separation efficiency. To investigate the effect of specific surface area of the samples on the photocatalytic activity, we tested the specific surface areas of the two typical samples: pure β-Bi2O3 nanosheets and 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 composites. As shown in Fig. 9, both the isotherms for these two samples exhibit a type IV with a H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification. The BET surface area of pure β-Bi2O3 nanosheets and 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 is 8.85 and 8.16 m2 g−1, indicating that the BET surface area was only slightly reduced by the introduction of AgI nanoparticles. However, the apparent reaction rate constant of the MO degradation reaction over the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 is 6.2 times that of β-Bi2O3. Therefore, it can be concluded that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the samples has no direct relationship with the BET surface areas. As mentioned above, the AgI nanoparticle loading is incapable of enhancing the visible light absorption of β-Bi2O3, indicating that the light-adsorption property is also not crucial for the photocatalytic activity of AgI/β-Bi2O3 composites. Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic activities of AgI/β-Bi2O3 composites might be mainly attributed to the synergic effect between AgI and β-Bi2O3, which can greatly accelerate the separation of photogenerated carriers.

To investigate the migration, transfer and recombination processes of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, PL spectra of the samples were recorded. There is a strong correlation between PL intensity and the photocatalytic performance. Higher PL intensity indicates the higher recombination of the charge carriers, which results in lower photocatalytic activity. The comparison of PL spectra of β-Bi2O3 nanosheets and AgI/β-Bi2O3 composites for excitation wavelength 270 nm is shown in Fig. 10. The main emission peak centers at about 530 nm for the β-Bi2O3 nanosheet, which can be ascribed to the band gap recombination of electron–hole pairs. Compared with the β-Bi2O3 nanosheet, addition of AgI does not alter the spectral position of the peaks, but reduces the relative intensity of PL spectra. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the enhanced photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the effective interfacial charge transfer between AgI and β-Bi2O3.

The photocurrent–time measurement was employed to evaluate the interfacial charge transfer dynamics between the AgI and β-Bi2O3. Fig. 11a displays the transient photocurrent responses produced by the pure AgI and 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 samples. The photocurrent intensity remained at a relatively high constant value when the light was on, and rapidly decreased to zero as soon as the light was turned off. It is obvious that the photocurrent over the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 composite was greatly improved, being about 4.2 times β-Bi2O3, suggesting that the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 heterostructure possesses a more powerful ability in charge separation than pure β-Bi2O3. To further study the charge transfer properties, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements over pure β-Bi2O3 nanosheets and 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 were performed, and the result is shown in Fig. 11b. In the Nyquist plot, the radius of each arc is characteristic of the charge transfer process at the corresponding electrode/electrolyte interface with a smaller radius corresponding with a lower charge-transfer resistance. Notably, the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 exhibits a smaller charge transfer resistance among all tested electrodes under irradiation, suggesting that effective shuttling of charges between the electrode and the electrolyte, and faster charge transfer occurred at the composite interface due to the formation of the heterojunctions between AgI/β-Bi2O3.

In order to fully understand the photocatalytic mechanism for the present AgI/β-Bi2O3 composites, the band edge positions of the valence band and conduction band of AgI/β-Bi2O3 should be determined because they are also strongly related to the process of photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds. The valence band potentials of a semiconductor at the point of zero charge can be calculated by using the following empirical formula: EVB = X − Ee + 0.5Eg(3)where EVB is the VB edge potential, X is the electronegativity of the semiconductor (the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms), Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (about 4.5 eV)51 and Eg is the band gap energy of the semiconductor, and ECB can be determined by ECB = EVB − Eg. Based on the band gap positions, the CB and VB edge potentials of AgI are determined to be −0.42 and 2.36 eV, respectively. The CB and VB edge potentials of β-Bi2O3 are determined to be 0.53 and 2.95 eV, respectively.
On the basis of the above results, a possible pathway for the photocatalytic degradation of MO with the AgI/β-Bi2O3 photocatalyst (Scheme 1) is proposed as follows: AgI/β-Bi2O3 + hν → AgI (e−) + β-Bi2O3 (h+)(4) AgI (e−) + O2 → AgI + ˙O2−(5) β-Bi2O3 (h+) + MO → degradation product(6) ˙O2− + MO → degradation product(7)

Upon illumination photo-excited electron–hole pairs are generated in AgI and β-Bi2O3, which absorb visible light. The photo-generated electrons in AgI migrate to the surface and lead to the reduction reaction. Meanwhile, the electrons can activate molecular oxygen, e.g., the formation of ˙O2−, which together with photo-generated holes in the valence band (VB) of β-Bi2O3 can drive the oxidation reaction. The holes from AgI and electrons from β-Bi2O3 recombine at the interface contact, completing the relay of the “Z-scheme” system. This Z-scheme model has been also demonstrated in the previously reported work. For example, Tian et al. reported a Z-scheme BiVO4/g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalyst with enhanced photocatalytic ability due to the efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.52 Liu and co-workers found that the nanotree-like CdS/ZnO nanocomposites act as a “Z-scheme” system to drive the photocatalytic processes and improve the photocatalytic activity.53 Chen et al. synthesized the highly active Z-scheme NaNbO3/WO3 photocatalysts via the hydrothermal method and the resulting photocatalysts showed enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation.54
3.6 Regeneration and reusability
The reusability and stability of the photocatalysts are vital for the practical application. To evaluate the reusability and stability of the AgI/β-Bi2O3 composite photocatalysts, recycling reactions are performed for the photodegradation of MO over the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 composite under visible light irradiation (Fig. 12a). After four consecutive cycles, no apparent deactivation of the photocatalysts is observed, which implies the high stability of the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 hybrid material. The XRD and TEM patterns of the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 composite were also investigated after four recycling runs for photodegradation of MO. As shown in Fig. 12b and S3,† the XRD patterns and TEM image of the 20%-AgI/β-Bi2O3 composite before and after reaction reveal that the phase and structure remain unchanged. These results indicate that the AgI/β-Bi2O3 heterostructure photocatalyst is sufficiently stable during the photodegradation of the organic dye.

4. Conclusions
In summary, 2D β-Bi2O3 nanosheets were synthesized and decorated with AgI nanoparticles to construct nanosheet-based heterojunction photocatalysts. The as-obtained AgI/β-Bi2O3 heterostructures exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to the pure AgI and β-Bi2O3 in the degradation of MO and TC under visible light irradiation. It was found that the photodegradation of MO molecules is mainly attributed to the oxidation action of the generated h+ and ˙O2−. The photocatalytic activity enhancement of AgI/β-Bi2O3 heterostructures could be ascribed to the fabrication of Z-scheme AgI/β-Bi2O3, which can result in the more efficient separation and largely reduced recombination probability of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. This work not only furthered the understanding of Z-scheme photocatalysis, but also provides an opportunity for future development of high-performance photocatalysts based on 2D β-Bi2O3 nanosheets.
