    , Accepted 17th January 2018First published on 17th January 2018AbstractFluorine containing conjugated polymers have been widely applied in high performance organic solar cells, but their use in field-effect transistors is still quite limited. In this work, a conjugated polymer PTFBTV based on difluorobenzothiadiazole (DFBT) and dithiophene was synthesized, utilizing multiple vinylene as linkers. The polymer exhibits a relatively high hole mobility up to 2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared with the reported DFBT–oligothiophene based polymers, yet its structural complexity is much simpler. The polymer thin film exhibits a typical ‘face on’ molecular orientation. A single crystal of its monomer revealed a non-covalent intramolecular contact between fluorine and the neighbouring proton, which strengthens the backbone co-planarity. Meanwhile an intermolecular F⋯F contact was also observed, which might cause rather scattered lamellar crystallinity for PTFBTV in the solid state.
Introduction
High performance organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have attracted significant interest owing to their promising applications in flexible and wearable electronic devices.1 As one of the candidate materials for such applications, conjugated polymers have exhibited vast potential since the past few decades. Their solubility and mechanical flexibility are suitable for low cost and large area fabrication.2–6 Meanwhile, their rapidly improving charge carrier mobility even surpasses the typical amorphous silicon-based FETs, exceeding 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 nowadays.1,7–10 The inner mechanisms between the chemical structure and charge transport are gradually revealed in developing these outstanding materials, which provide guidance in the design of new conjugated polymers for flexible OFETs in industrial applications.
As for molecular design, heteroatoms such as fluorine have been introduced into a donor (D)–acceptor (A) conjugated polymer, in order to strengthen the co-planarity of the polymer backbone and crystallinity in the solid state,11–15 or to restrain the conformation of some vinylene structures, by utilizing their inter- and intra- molecular non-covalent interactions.16–20 While many reports show mobility improvement owing to the positive effects mentioned above, there are equal studies which suggest that the ‘face on’ molecular orientation would be the preference for some fluorine contained conjugated polymers,11,21–23 which is suggested to be beneficial for the power conversion efficiency (PCE) in organic solar cells,24–27 but it usually results in mobility loss for transistors when compared with the “edge on” orientations.
A typical example is the difluorobenzothiadiazole (DFBT) contained D–A conjugated polymers.21,28–31 While the DFBT–oligothiophene based conjugated polymers have been reported in achieving a PCE over 10%,21,31 their OFET performances are rarely reported to be over 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Although high performance has been achieved when pairing DFBT with more complex donors such as cyclopentadithiophene32 and dithienosilole,33 there is still a large scope for improving the carrier mobility of the simple DFBT–oligothiophene based conjugated polymers.
Efforts along this vein are mainly focused on the modification of branched side chains and their position. Notably, Cao et al. have reported a DFBT–quaterthiophene polymer FBT-Th4 incorporated with 2-decyltetradecyl side chains, which achieved a hole mobility up to 1.28 cm2 V−1 s−1 under ambient conditions and 1.95 cm2 V−1 s−1 under N2.34 On the other hand, backbone engineering in these DFBT–oligothiophene polymers, especially fusion of vinyl linkages, has seldom been reported. More recently, Heeney and his co-workers have achieved a hole mobility over 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the conjugated polymer P(FBT-V24T) containing vinyl flanked DFBT and quaterthiophene.35 In fact, the vinyl linker has been successfully introduced into other thiophene based D–A conjugated polymers and achieved rather high charge carrier mobilities.36–38 For instance, the vinyl containing diketopyrrolopyrrole-thiophene based polymer P-29-DPPDTSE has been reported to reach a hole mobility up to 12 cm2 V−1 s−1.39 However, due to the conformational isomerization effect from vinylene,40,41 usually there is only one thiophene–vinyl–thiophene (TVT) structure introduced in the repeating unit. Multiple vinyl fused polymers such as P(FBTV24T) are still less reported.35,42–44
In this work, we intend to simplify the polymer structure and further utilize the vinyl linkers. As depicted in Fig. 1, a DFBT–dithiophene conjugated polymer PTFBTV was synthesized, in which the donor and acceptor units are all connected with vinylene. The grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis revealed a typical “face on” orientation for the spin-coated PTFBTV thin film. This is in accordance with previous studies.21,31 Interestingly, an outstanding performance of a hole mobility up to 2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved from the PTFBTV based OFET devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the highest performances of the DFBT–oligothiophene based polymers. Additionally, a single crystal of the vinyl flanked DFBT–dithiophene monomer was also obtained and analysed, which gives us a glimpse on the inner mechanism of fluorine influences in the molecular arrangement.

Results and discussion
Synthesis

Scheme 1 demonstrates the synthetic route for PTFBTV. The procedure started with the formylation of 3-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophene (5). Then vinyl-thiophene (3) was synthesized via the Wittig reaction. The following coupling of vinyl-thiophene and DBFT was carried outing using the Heck reaction. Owing to its stereoselectivity, a trans-product, compound 2, in an overwhelming majority was obtained (as confirmed by 1H NMR, Fig. S8, ESI†). Thus, an all trans-configuration backbone was achieved by a Stille coupling using trans-1,2-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)ethylene, yielding the final polymer PTFBTV. Note that the base used in the Heck reaction to afford compound 2 was Et3N instead of commonly used K2CO3. This is because the stronger base such as K2CO3 could lead to defluorination of DFBT. The detailed synthetic approaches are provided in the ESI.† The molecular weight of the polymer was evaluated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with THF as the eluent. The results are Mn = 28.6 kDa and PDI = 2.21. Thermal gravimetric analysis revealed fine stability for PTFBTV, with decomposition temperatures above 350 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectrum of PTFBTV in solution and the thin film is all shown in Fig. 2. The maximum absorption wavelength peak of PTFBTV in solution (CHCl3, 10−5 M) was observed at 706 nm and slightly red shifted to 723 nm in the spin coated thin film. This indicates a possible aggregation in the solid state.45 In addition, for some vinyl containing poly(phenyl) vinylene derivatives, their backbone can switch from trans- to cis-configuration under UV irradiation, which appears as significant shifts or intensity changes in the absorption spectra.41 In our case, PTFBTV showed no obvious spectra variation in the exposure of UV irradiation (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating a relatively stable trans-configuration backbone for PTFBTV. The cyclic voltammetry curve is also depicted in Fig. 2, from which the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were estimated to be −3.60 eV and −5.59 eV, respectively. The detailed optical and electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the oligomer (n = 2) were also carried out. The results manifest a rather good planarity for the polymer backbone of PTFBTV (Fig. S4, ESI†). Note that the largely branched alkyl chains were replaced by propyl for simplifying the process.

Organic field effect transistors
The bottom contact/bottom gate (BGBC) OFET devices of PTFBTV were fabricated via a conventional spin coating technique with their corresponding o-dichlorobenzene solutions, using doped n-type Si as the gate electrode, Au as the drain/source electrodes and n-octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS)modified SiO2 as the dielectric layer. All devices were examined under ambient conditions. The corresponding output and transfer characteristics were measured as shown in Fig. 3. These devices worked on negative voltages, indicating a typical p-type semiconducting property. A relatively small hysteresis is observed in the transfer curve, possibly owing to some trapping or defects in the polymer, such as insufficient interchain packing or domain boundaries with interfacial trap distribution.46 Interestingly, the devices showed an insensitive response to thermal annealing. The highest device performance was obtained after annealing at 120 °C, and the devices exhibited a hole mobility up to 2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1, an on/off ratio of 105 and a threshold voltage of −5 V. In fact, there was no significant improvement in the performances of devices annealed at 120 °C compared to those of the as-prepared ones. And the carrier mobility degraded rapidly after further annealing at higher temperatures. A summary of OFET device performances from PTFBTV is displayed in Table 1. Properties of our previously reported polymer PTBTV are also included. PTBTV possesses the same polymer backbone as PTFBTV but without fluorine.9 As shown, PTBTV exhibited a relatively high mobility up to 3.2 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is known that there can be significant mobility losses in the non-fluorine polymers compared to the fluorinated ones even reaching an order of magnitude sometimes.32,48 But in our case such mobility reduction is relatively small, which can be even smaller judging from the average mobilities. Nevertheless, this carrier mobility of PTFBTV is among the highest performances for OFETs based on simple DFBT and oligothiophene, comparable to the previously mentioned polymer FBT-Th4,34 yet with less structural complexity.

Thin film and single crystal
To further understand the relationship between molecular packing and high carrier transporting ability in the solid state, XRD and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses were carried out to investigate the spin coated thin film of PTFBTV (optimized by annealing at 120 °C). The resulting 2D GIXRD and AFM images are all displayed in Fig. 3. As depicted, a crystalline fiber-like intercalating morphology in the AFM image was observed, with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.84 nm. This morphology is probably induced by the strong intermolecular π–π interaction in the solid state,47 which is believed to be beneficial for interchain charge transport. This echoes well with the strong out-of-plane diffraction peak at q = 1.70 Å−1 (010) observed from the GIXRD patterns, corresponding to a π–π interaction distance of 3.7 Å. However, such a diffraction peak also indicates a typical ‘face on’ molecular packing for PTFBTV, which is considered a less efficient orientation for carrier mobility than the ‘edge on’ packing, since the charge carrier transport along the direction is parallel to the substrate.49,50 Meanwhile, a ring-like diffraction pattern with ordered lamellar peaks at q = 0.27 Å−1 (100), 0.55 Å−1 (200) and 0.82 Å−1 (300) in both the out-of-plane and in-plane directions was obtained. The corresponding d-spacing was estimated to be 23.0 Å. Such ring-shaped diffraction peaks have also been reported by several other fluorine containing conjugated polymers, indicating a scattered lamellar crystalline structure rather than a more oriented pattern in the ‘edge on’ packed polymers.21,31,48 It has been pointed out that this lowered crystallinity resulting from fusing the fluorine can be reflected by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), for the fluorine containing conjugated polymers usually exhibit weaker thermal effects than the original non-fluorine polymers.48 This is also in accordance with our case that no obvious thermal peaks were observed in the DSC curve of PTFBTV (see Fig. S2 for details, ESI†).
A single crystal of the corresponding monomer DVFBT was obtained to investigate the role of fluorine in molecular packing. Fig. 4 displays the structural details of the single crystal. The unit cell dimension indicates a monoclinic crystalline structure for DVFBT. As depicted, the two vinyl linkers exhibit a ‘boat-like’ conformation, which could be attributed to the non-covalent F⋯H short contact. Interestingly, this short contact could be qualified as the C–H⋯F hydrogen bond (a linear angle of C–H–X (>90°) and a short distance between C⋯X (<3.3 Å, the combined van der Waals radii)), with a C–H–F angle of 101.77° and a C⋯F distance of 2.777 Å, similar to the reported five-membered-ring C–H⋯F bonds from the fluorinated OPV derivatives reported previously.19 To verify the influence of such a C–H⋯F bond, a single crystal of a comparative monomer DVBT without fluorine was also obtained, in which vinylene exhibits a ‘stair-like’ conformation (see Fig. S5 for details, ESI†). In addition, the torsional angle between the thiophene plane and BT plane is reduced to 1.5° in DVFBT compared to 5.5° in DVBT. Furthermore, the π–π interaction distance in DVFBT (3.47 Å) is also slightly shorter than that in DVBT (3.59 Å). Notably, the π–π interaction distance in the corresponding polymer PTFBTV (3.7 Å) is also slightly shorter than the non-fluorine PTBTV polymer (3.8 Å). These results manifest that the existence of fluorine not only affects the vinyl conformation, but also likely contributes to strengthen the planarity of the polymer backbone. Similar conclusions have also been drawn by Heeny et al. in a thorough study of a vinyl flanked DFBT–dithiophene monomer,35 using DFT calculations and 19F–1H heteronuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy NMR analysis. Such a planarization effect is suggested to be a positive influence for charge carrier mobility.

As is mentioned previously that the mobility of PTFBTV is slightly lower than that of the corresponding non-fluorine PTBTV, but still remains in at a relatively high level. From these former analysis results we can conclude that such a high mobility could be attributed to the following aspects: firstly, the existence of the C–H⋯F interaction enhanced the co-planarity of the polymer backbone, creating strong π–π interactions, which guaranteed the inter-chain charge carrier transport bridge; additionally, according to the previous reports, the multiple vinyl linkers can provide extra intra-chain charge transport improvements.9 Thus, despite the scattered lamellar crystalline and ‘face on’ orientation, which are both considered negative factors for charge transport in the solid state, the charge carrier mobility of PTFBTV still remains in at a quite high level. In particular, an F⋯F intermolecular contact with a distance of 2.855 Å was also observed in the single crystal of DVFBT. Such a contact is likely to induce ‘X’ cross shaped molecular stacking while in non-fluorine DVBT the molecules are arranged in a parallel mode (Fig. S5, ESI†). This might be the trigger for the ‘ring-shaped’ diffraction and scattered lamellar crystallinity for polymer PTFBTV in the solid state, eventually resulting in the ‘face on’ orientation. Should this obstacle be overcome, the performance DFBT based conjugated polymers could be further improved.
Conclusions
In summary we have synthesized a multi-vinyl flanked conjugated polymer PTFBTV based on DFBT and dithiophene. The polymer exhibits a promising hole mobility up to 2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the bottom contact/bottom gate OFET devices. Investigations on the polymer thin film and monomer single crystal suggest that, the short non-covalent contact of fluorine and the proton in the neighbouring vinyl strengthens the backbone co-planarity and intermolecular π–π interactions, which can facilitate inter-chain charge transport. On the other hand, the F⋯F intermolecular contact might be one of the reasons for the scattered lamellar crystalline and ‘face on’ orientation in the solid state, which limited the charge carrier mobility from further improvement. It would be beneficial to understand the inner mechanism and balance of the two aspects from fluorine for molecular design in both OFETs and organic solar cells. Further research along this vein deserves attention.
Experimental
OFET device fabrication
Bottom-gate/bottom-contact FETs were fabricated. A heavily doped n-type Si wafer and a layer of dry oxidized SiO2 (300 nm, with roughness lesser than 0.1 nm and a capacitance of 11 nF cm−2) were used as the gate electrode and gate dielectric layer, respectively. The drain–source (D–S) gold contacts were fabricated by photolithography. The substrates were first cleaned by sonication in acetone and water for 5.0 min and immersed in piranha solution (2:1 mixture of sulfuric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide) for 30 min. This was followed by rinsing with deionized water and isopropyl alcohol several times, and the substrates were blow-dried with nitrogen. Then, the surface was modified with n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). After that, the substrates were cleaned with n-hexane, CHCl3, and isopropyl alcohol. The films of PTFBTV were fabricated by spin-coating with their o-dichlorobenzene solutions (5.0 mg mL−1) at 2000 rpm. The annealing process was carried out in a vacuum for 1.0 hr at certain temperatures.
The field-effect characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer under ambient conditions. The mobility of the OFETs in the saturation region was calculated using the following equation:  where IDS is the drain electrode collected current; L (50 μm) and W (1440 μm) are the channel length and width, respectively; μ is the mobility of the device; Ci (11 nF cm−2) is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer; VG is the gate voltage; VT is the threshold voltage, and the VT of the device was determined by extrapolating the (IDS,sat)1/2vs. VG plot to IDS = 0.
