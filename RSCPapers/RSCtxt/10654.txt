China. E-mail: hej@nanoctr.cnReceived 31st July 2013, Accepted 30th August 2013First published on 5th September 2013AbstractA novel ZnO/reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/CdS heterostructure was successfully synthesized via a facile three-step solution method. RGO serves as an interlayer between ZnO nanowires and CdS quantum dots (QDs), which provides a high speed charge transfer channel, leading to an enhanced charge separation efficiency. Under UV light irradiation, the photocatalytic activity of the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure is 4.0 times and 1.9 times as high as those of pure ZnO and ZnO/RGO, respectively. Under visible light irradiation, the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure shows a dramatic visible light photocatalytic activity which is 2.3 times higher than that of the ZnO/CdS photocatalyst. The photocurrent of the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure under UV light irradiation was greatly enhanced and a photocurrent under visible light irradiation was observed. The enhanced photocatalytic activity and the extended light adsorption spectrum originate from the type-II ZnO/CdS band alignment and the introduction of RGO as a charge mediator. Our results might open up a promising way to develop novel and highly efficient RGO-based heterostructure photocatalysts.1 IntroductionWith rapid development of worldwide industry, increasing environmental pollution has become one of the biggest challenges of our society. The photocatalytic technique has attracted widespread attention because it is one of the prospective ways to deal with pollutants by using solar energy.1–4 TiO2 and ZnO are extensively investigated as candidates for ideal photocatalysts because they are relatively inexpensive and could provide photogenerated holes with strong oxidizing power.5,6 Although TiO2 is the most widely studied photocatalyst, ZnO appears to be a suitable alternative to TiO2 due to its higher electron mobility and longer carrier lifetime.7 Moreover, ZnO has exhibited a higher efficiency than TiO2 in the photodegradation of organic compounds in some studies.8–10 However, the high photogenerated charge recombination rate and poor visible light response of these photocatalysts have hindered large-scale industrial applications of ZnO. A lot of ZnO micro/nanomaterials have been studied for photocatalytic applications. Powdery photocatalysts dispersed in solution easily agglomerate and are hard to collect and recycle. To extend the application of photocatalysis, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures (such as nanowires and nanotubes) are studied as immobilized photocatalysts due to their specific physical and chemical properties.11 1D nanowires have large surface-to-volume ratios, direct electrical pathways for rapid transport of photogenerated carriers and recyclable characteristics, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic activity. ZnO nanowires are widely used in photoelectrodes,11–13 photodetectors7,14 and gas sensors.15,16 Much effort has been devoted to inhibit the photogenerated charge recombination process and extend the solar light response range of ZnO nanowires, such as combining ZnO with another semiconductor,17,18 doping19,20 and deposition of novel metals.21–23Combining ZnO with other narrow band gap semiconductors with a suitable band gap is an effective way to enhance its photocatalytic performance and extend its light absorption spectrum.7,24,25 CdS with a band gap of 2.4 eV is an attractive photocatalyst for conversion of solar energy into chemical energy; it can be synthesized by a simple and inexpensive chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. Various types of CdS sensitized semiconductor nanostructures have been reported, such as CdS sensitized TiO226,27 and CdS sensitized ZnO.28,29 Combining ZnO with CdS can form type-II band alignments, which could effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity and visible light absorption.24Graphene has attracted much attention since its discovery in 2004 due to its outstanding electronic, optoelectronic, thermal and mechanical properties.30–32 It exhibits excellent charge carrier mobility and a large specific surface area, and can be used as an electron mediator to achieve effective charge separation in electron-transfer processes.31,32 The combination of graphene and semiconductors may be an ideal system to achieve an enhanced charge separation in charge transport. Many studies have focused on the graphene based photocatalysts, such as TiO2/graphene,28,32 ZnO/graphene,33 CdS/graphene34 and so on. However, few reports have focused on the design and fabrication of a graphene/semiconductor heterostructure. The fabrication of a heterostructure is an effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity due to the combination of merits of each composition. In the heterostructure, graphene or reduced graphene oxide (RGO) could work as a good electron mediator and a gap linker to enhance the photogenerated charge separation efficiency.In this work, we present the first example of a ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure fabricated by a three-step solution method. ZnO nanowire arrays synthesized on a flexible substrate (carbon cloth) serve as a core material, RGO serves as a charge medium interlayer, and CdS works as a visible light sensitizer. The type II ZnO/CdS band alignment is beneficial to improving the photocatalytic activity and visible light utilization. The RGO interlayer works as an efficient charge transport medium, which provides a high speed charge transfer channel, leading to an enhanced charge separation efficiency. Compared with that of each pure ZnO, ZnO/RGO and ZnO/CdS, the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure shows a greatly enhanced UV light photocatalytic activity and a dramatic visible light photocatalytic activity. The structure and the mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure were systematically investigated.2 Experimental section2.1 Preparation of ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructurePreparation of ZnO nanowires. ZnO nanowires on a carbon cloth substrate were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. A carbon cloth substrate (2 cm × 4 cm) was cleaned by sonication in acetone, methanol and deionized water, and then dried in air. Firstly, a ZnO seed layer was deposited on the clean carbon cloth substrate by a dip-coating method. Then, the carbon cloth substrate was placed in a beaker with an aqueous solution of 0.0025 M zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and 0.0025 M hexamethylenetetramine (HMT). The beaker was heated at 90 °C for 10 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was rinsed with ethanol and deionized water, and then dried in air.Preparation of ZnO/RGO. Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared through chemical exfoliation of graphite powder via a modified Hummers method.35 Then the GO was deposited on the ZnO nanowires by a dip-coating method; the concentration of GO solution is 0.5 mg mL−1. The ZnO/GO was calcined at 400 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen atmosphere to enhance the adhesion between the ZnO nanowires and GO. RGO was generated via ZnO photocatalytic reduction according to the literature.36 ZnO/GO was immersed in ethanol, and then was irradiated using an 11 W UV-light lamp (λ = 254 nm) for 2 h at room temperature to reduce the GO sheets to RGO. The obtained ZnO/RGO was finally washed with distilled water and dried in air.Preparation of ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure. CdS quantum dots (QDs) were deposited on ZnO/RGO by chemical bath deposition (CBD).37 The as-prepared ZnO/RGO carbon cloth was immersed in an aqueous solution of 0.01 M Cd(NO3)2 and 0.01 M thioacetamide at 40 °C for 10 min. The ZnO/RGO carbon cloth became yellow, and then the as-prepared ZnO/RGO/CdS carbon cloth was washed with deionized water and dried in air. For reference, ZnO/CdS composite carbon cloth was prepared via the same method.2.2 CharacterizationMorphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared photocatalysts were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). SEM images were obtained with a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope. HRTEM were performed on a FEI Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 KV. The crystallinity of the as-prepared photocatalysts was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-TTRIII (CBO) diffractometer), using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Raman spectra were obtained using an InVo-RENISHAW system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded on an Escalab250xi XPS instrument. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was performed on a Hitachi U-3010, using BaSO4 as the reference. Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out on an electrochemical system (CHI-660B, China), using a standard three-electrode cell. The ZnO and as-prepared carbon cloths served as working electrodes, a platinum wire served as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) served as the reference electrode, and the electrolyte solution was 0.1 M Na2SO4. Photoresponses were measured at 0.0 V (with reference to the SCE) under on-off cycles of light. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at 0.0 V (with reference to the SCE). A sinusoidal ac perturbation of 5 mV was applied to the electrode in the frequency range of 0.005–105 Hz.2.3 Photocatalytic experimentsThe photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples for the decomposition of methylene blue (MB) were measured under UV light (λ = 254 nm) and visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). UV light irradiation was obtained from an 11 W UV lamp (λ = 254 nm) and the average light intensity was 0.9 mW cm−2. A 500 W xenon lamp (Beijing China Education Au-light Co. Ltd.) with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as the visible light source, and the average light intensity was 290 mW cm−2. MB dye (80 mL, 10−5 mol L−1) was used to test the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples. Before turning on the light, the reaction system was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to reach the absorption–desorption equilibrium. The concentration of MB was analyzed by recording variations in the characteristic absorption band (663 nm) using a UV-756PC UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shanghai Sunny Hengping Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd).3 Results and discussion3.1 Structure and morphology of as-prepared samplesThe morphology of ZnO, ZnO/RGO and ZnO/RGO/CdS is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the ZnO nanowires were successfully synthesized on the entire surface of the carbon cloth via a hydrothermal method. The length of the ZnO nanowires is in the range of 2–3 μm, and the diameter is about 30 nm. It is worth noting that the surface of the individual ZnO nanowire is smooth (the inset of Fig. 1a). After coating with RGO, the surface of the ZnO nanowire is covered by RGO sheets (Fig. 1b), indicating that RGO sheets are indeed attached to the ZnO nanowires. This RGO interlayer can work as a charge mediator, and it is helpful for a charge transfer process. After deposition of CdS QDs, the surface of the ZnO nanowires and RGO sheets becomes rough (Fig.1c and the inset of Fig. 1d). CdS QDs were uniformly coated on the surface of the ZnO nanowires and RGO sheets, and the as-prepared sample becomes yellow after CdS deposition. The EDX analysis (Fig. 1d) of the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure proves the presence of the elements C, O, Zn, S, and Cd. The approximate atomic ratio of S and Cd is 1:1, indicating the existence of CdS. This uniform CdS will be quite beneficial to improving the charge separation and extending the absorption spectrum of ZnO nanowires. Fig. 1  SEM images of ZnO (a) inset: an enlarged image of ZnO nanowires, ZnO/RGO (b), ZnO/RGO/CdS (c) and the EDS spectrum of the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure (d). TEM and HRTEM measurements were performed to further characterize the morphology of the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure. As can be seen from Fig. 2a, the ZnO nanowire is covered by RGO sheets and CdS QDs, proving the formation of an intimate ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure. In addition, the diameter of CdS is in the range of 25–50 nm, and the measured interplanar spacing is 0.33 nm, which corresponds to the CdS (002) plane.37 The measured interplanar spacing of ZnO is 0.25 nm, which could be indexed to the (101) plane. Fig. 2  TEM (a) and HRTEM (b) images of the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure. The XRD patterns of the ZnO, ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure and carbon cloth are shown in Fig. S1.† In the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure, all of the diffraction peaks, except four peaks of the carbon cloth, can be exactly indexed to the zincite structure (JCPDS 89-1397).38 Peaks at around 14.1°, 16.8°, 25.6°, and 43.7° are attributed to the diffraction peaks of the carbon cloth, and the peaks of the carbon cloth decreased after RGO and CdS coating. The characteristic diffraction peaks of CdS cannot be observed due to the low loading amount. In addition, no change in the ZnO crystal phase could be observed after RGO and CdS coating.Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of ZnO nanowires, ZnO/GO, ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure and carbon cloth. All Raman spectra show similar G (the presence of sp2 carbon-type structures) and D (the presence of defects in the hexagonal graphitic layers) band structures of carbon.32,39 In the spectra of carbon cloth and ZnO, the G and D bands are due to the carbon cloth substrate. Compared with those of the carbon cloth and ZnO, we can observe stronger and broader G and D bands in ZnO/GO and ZnO/RGO/CdS, which indicate that GO and RGO were successfully coated on the surface of ZnO. Raman spectroscopy is a useful method to characterize the degree of reduction of GO. After reduction of GO to form RGO, the sp2 carbon-type structures were rebuilt. The size of the rebuilt sp2 carbon structures in RGO is smaller than that of GO, which results in the increased D/G ratio. In the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure, an increased D/G intensity ratio is observed compared to that of ZnO/GO, suggesting that more graphene domains formed on ZnO/RGO/CdS by reduction of the GO.39 The formation of graphene provides a convenient channel for rapid charge transportation. In addition, compared with that of ZnO/GO, the G band shifts from 1596 to 1591 cm−1 in ZnO/RGO/CdS, which could be ascribed to the chemical interaction between ZnO and graphene.32,39 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of ZnO/GO and ZnO/RGO photocatalysts. To further investigate the reduction of GO in the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure, high-resolution XPS spectra of C1s are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen from Fig. 4a, the XPS spectrum of C1s of ZnO/GO can be divided into four smaller peaks (dashed lines), which correspond to the following functional groups: C–C (284.8 eV, sp2 C atoms), C–OH (285.3 eV), C–O (286.9 eV, epoxy/hydroxyls) and O–CO (288.9 eV, carboxyl), indicating the high percentage of oxygen-containing functional groups.34 In comparison, in the XPS spectrum of C1s of ZnO/RGO/CdS (Fig. 4b), the peaks for C–OH and O–CO almost disappear, and the peak for C–O still exists but much lower than that in GO, indicating that most oxygen-containing functional groups are efficiently removed from the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure. Fig. 4  C1s XPS spectra of (a) ZnO/GO and (b) ZnO/RGO/CdS. The optical properties of the carbon cloth substrate and as-prepared samples were analysed by UV-vis DRS (Fig. 5). Carbon cloth displays absorption in the visible light and UV light region. ZnO exhibits a sharp fundamental absorption edge rise at 400 nm, which coincides with the literature.40 ZnO/RGO/CdS and ZnO/CdS show two similar absorption bands. The first absorption band edge rise at 530 nm is due to the presence of CdS, and the second absorption band can be assigned to the absorption of ZnO. After CdS QD sensitization, the absorption of ZnO in the visible light region increase, indicating the successful CdS coating.

The photoresponse curves of the as-prepared photocatalysts were measured with light on/off cycles at 0 V versus SEC (Fig. 6). Fast and uniform photocurrent responses are observed for each light-on and light-off cycle in all electrodes, indicating that charge transport in the as-prepared electrodes proceeds very quickly. Under UV light irradiation, the photocurrent is enhanced step-by-step from pure ZnO, ZnO/RGO to ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure electrodes as shown in Fig. 6a. The photocurrent density of the ZnO/RGO/CdS electrode is 5.2 μA cm−2, which is about 3.3 and 1.6 times as high as those of the pure ZnO and ZnO/RGO, respectively. The photocurrent enhancement of the ZnO/RGO/CdS electrode indicates a higher separation efficiency of photoinduced electron and hole pairs. Under visible light irradiation (Fig. 6b), since ZnO cannot be excited by visible light, ZnO shows almost no photocurrent response. Similar to that of UV light irradiation, the photocurrent density is enhanced step-by-step from pure ZnO, ZnO/RGO to ZnO/RGO/CdS under visible light irradiation. The photocurrent density of the ZnO/RGO/CdS electrode is 19.7 μA cm−2, which is about 15.2 times as high as that of the pure ZnO/RGO electrode. It is worth noting that the photocurrent density of ZnO/RGO/CdS is much higher than that of ZnO/CdS, indicating that the introduction of RGO effectively improves the transport of charge carriers from CdS to ZnO nanowires so that the separation efficiency of photoinduced electron–hole pairs can be greatly enhanced. Fig. 6  Photoresponse curves of ZnO, ZnO/RGO, ZnO/CdS and ZnO/RGO/CdS: (a) UV light irradiation (λ = 254 nm); (b) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). EIS is a useful method to investigate the interfacial charge separation process. Fig. 7 shows the EIS Nyquist plots of the as-prepared samples without and with light irradiation (Fig. 7a: under UV light irradiation, Fig. 7b: under visible light irradiation). The radius of the arc on the EIS spectra reflects the reaction rate occurring at the surface of the electrode.32,41,42 Under UV irradiation (Fig. 7a), the radius of the arc in the EIS spectra is decreased step-by-step from pure ZnO, ZnO/RGO to ZnO/RGO/CdS. The ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure has the smallest arc radius, indicating a more effective separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and faster interfacial charge transport. Under visible light irradiation as shown in Fig. 7b, the EIS Nyquist plots present a similar change in trend to that of UV irradiation. ZnO/RGO/CdS has the smallest arc radius with or without visible light irradiation, indicating a more effective charge separation process and faster interfacial charge transport. Moreover, the arc radius of ZnO/RGO/CdS is smaller than that of ZnO/CdS no matter under UV light or visible light irradiation, suggesting that the RGO interlayer plays an important role in facilitating charge transfer thus enhancing the charge separation efficiency. Fig. 7  EIS Nyquist plots of ZnO, ZnO/RGO, ZnO/CdS and ZnO/RGO/CdS: (a) UV light irradiation (λ = 254 nm); (b) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). 3.3 Enhancement of photocatalytic activityTo extend the application of ZnO, a ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure was grown on flexible carbon cloth. In this ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure, ZnO serves as the main material; CdS acts as the visible light sensitizer. RGO was introduced to work as a high speed charge transfer channel to enhance the charge separation efficiency, thus leading to improved photocatalytic activity. To investigate the photocatalytic activity of ZnO, ZnO/RGO, ZnO/CdS, and ZnO/RGO/CdS photocatalysts, MB was chosen as a model pollutant for photocatalytic degradation. MB is a dye and is commonly used to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts. Fig. 8 shows the photodegradation rates of MB on ZnO, ZnO/RGO, ZnO/CdS, and ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure under UV light and visible light irradiation. The photolysis (in the absence of a photocatalyst), pure carbon cloth (under light irradiation) and ZnO/CdS photocatalyst are used as reference. Prior to irradiation, the reaction solution was kept in the dark for 30 min to ensure the equilibrium of the solution. As can be seen in the adsorption experiment (Fig. S2†), the adsorptivity of ZnO/RGO/CdS and ZnO/RGO is higher than that of ZnO and ZnO/CdS due to the large surface area of RGO and π–π stacking between RGO and MB.38 The photocatalytic degradation process is fit to pseudo-first-order kinetics, and a pseudo-first-order linear relationship was revealed by the plots of ln(C/C0) vs. irradiation time (t) (Fig. 8), where C is the concentration of MB at the irradiation time t and C0 is the concentration of MB in the absorption equilibrium before irradiation. The slope of the pseudo-first-order linear line is the photocatalytic reaction apparent rate constant k, and the value of rate constant k was calculated and is shown in Fig. 8a and b. As can be seen in Fig. 8a, photolysis and pure carbon cloth show no obvious photocatalytic activity. All of the ZnO composite photocatalysts exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than that of pure ZnO under UV light irradiation. The apparent rate constant k is enhanced step-by-step from pure ZnO, ZnO/RGO to ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure photocatalyst. The ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure photocatalyst shows the highest photocatalytic activity, which could degrade MB by 76.1% in 4 h. Its apparent rate constant k is 0.006 min−1and is 4.0 times and 1.9 times as high as those of pure ZnO and ZnO/RGO. These results indicate that the introduction of RGO and CdS can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanowires. In addition, the apparent rate constant k of the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure is 2.2 times higher than that of ZnO/CdS, suggesting that the introduction of RGO could facilitate charge transfer thus improving the photocatalytic activity. Fig. 8  Photocatalytic degradation of MB over ZnO, ZnO/RGO, ZnO/CdS, and ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure: (a) UV light irradiation (λ = 254 nm); (b) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Inset: apparent rate constant k of each sample. The photodegradation rates of MB on carbon cloth, ZnO, ZnO/RGO, ZnO/CdS, and ZnO/RGO/CdS under visible light irradiation are shown in Fig. 8b. Since ZnO cannot be excited by visible light irradiation, ZnO, photolysis (in the absence of a photocatalyst) and carbon cloth (under light irradiation) almost show the same photocatalytic activity in MB degradation. After combining with RGO and CdS, ZnO exhibits excellent visible light photocatalytic activity and its photocatalytic activity is much higher than those of ZnO/RGO and ZnO/CdS. Similar to that of UV irradiation, the apparent rate constant k is enhanced step-by-step from pure ZnO, ZnO/RGO to ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure. The introduction of CdS QDs not only extends the light adsorption spectrum of ZnO but also enhances the charge separation efficiency. Moreover, the apparent rate constant k of the ZnO/RGO/CdS photocatalyst is 2.3 times higher than that of ZnO/CdS, indicating that RGO could effectively enhance the charge transfer process between ZnO and CdS thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity.3.4 Mechanism of enhancement of photocatalytic activityOn the basis of the results of photodegradation and photoelectrochemical tests, a mechanism for highly efficient electron–hole separation and transport at the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure is proposed in Fig. 9. The type-II band alignment of ZnO and CdS is helpful for charge separation and transport.24,29 Under UV light irradiation, ZnO and CdS are excited to generate electrons and holes. The introduction of the RGO interlayer provides a high speed charge channel in the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure due to its high electron mobility. The RGO interlayer could easily transfer the electrons from the conduction band (CB) of CdS to the CB of ZnO, enhancing the photogenerated charge separation efficiency. Meanwhile, the excited holes at the valence band (VB) of ZnO would transfer to the VB of CdS via the RGO interlayer. The separated holes will directly react with MB or react with water to generate hydroxyl radicals. The separated electrons would subsequently react with water and oxygen to generate hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. The radicals would subsequently oxidize the MB due to their high oxidative capacity. Under visible light irradiation, ZnO cannot be excited by visible light, but CdS could absorb visible light to induce excited-state electrons and holes. The excited electrons at the CB of CdS would easily transfer to the CB of ZnO via the RGO interlayer due to the type-II band alignment. Therefore, only holes remain at the VB of CdS, leading to a spatial separation of the electrons and holes. The improvement of photocatalytic activity and PEC performance of the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure is mainly due to the high efficiency of photogenerated charge separation induced by the ZnO and CdS type-II band alignment and RGO interlayer. Fig. 9  Schematic of the energy band structure of the ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure. 4 ConclusionA novel ZnO/RGO/CdS heterostructure was successfully synthesized via a three-step solution method. The type-II ZnO/CdS band alignment is beneficial to improving the photocatalytic activity and visible light utilization. The RGO interlayer works as an efficient charge transport medium, which provides a high speed charge transfer channel, leading to an enhanced charge separation efficiency. Under UV light irradiation, ZnO/RGO/CdS shows the highest photocatalytic activity as compared to those of pure ZnO, ZnO/RGO and ZnO/CdS. Under visible light irradiation, ZnO/RGO/CdS presents a dramatic visible light photocatalytic activity. The enhanced photocatalytic activity and photoelectrochemical properties originate from the type-II ZnO/CdS band alignment and RGO interlayer. We believe that our results demonstrate a successful RGO-based heterostructure and expect that it will provide a new insight into the fabrication of a novel high efficiency heterostructure applied in photocatalysis.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the 973 Program of Ministry of Science and Technology of China (no. 2012CB934103) and the 100-Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (no.
