    , Accepted 15th July 2014First published on 15th July 2014AbstractHybrid heterojunctions of conjugated polymers and inorganic nanomaterials are a promising combination for obtaining high performance solar cells (SC). In this work we have explored new possible uses of the WS2 nanotubes (NTs) both as the only acceptor material blended with a polymer and in ternary systems mixed with a polymer and quantum dots (QDs). In particular we have spectroscopically investigated binary blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and WS2 NTs, P3HT and CdSe QDs, and ternary blends of P3HT, CdSe QDs and WS2 NTs. We report fluorescence quenching effects of the QD signal in the P3HT–CdSe–WS2 system with the increase of NT concentration. Static and time-resolved fluorescence studies reveal efficient resonant energy transfer from the QDs to the NTs upon photoexcitation. The evidence of energetic interaction between WS2 NTs and QDs opens new fields of application of WS2 NTs and holds very promising potential for improving charge transfer phenomena in the active layer of hybrid solar cells.
1 Introduction
The elevated cost of silicon-based photovoltaics and depletion of material stocks have given a strong input to search for new and less expensive materials for solar energy conversion. A valid alternative is represented by purely organic or hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells as they do not require expensive high temperature processes and can be easily processed on a large scale.1 In particular, bulk heterojunctions of conjugated polymers, as donor materials, and inorganic nanomaterials, as acceptor materials, can offer numerous advantages. On one hand, polymers having large absorption coefficients permit us to realize efficient thin film based devices. Polymeric thin films can be deposited by different solution based deposition techniques2 on rigid or flexible substrates also with special morphologies targeted to enhance the cell performances. However, much effort is being devoted to overcome major limitations of polymer based photovoltaic devices i.e. degradation and limited time stability. To this purpose air stable polymers, efficient encapsulation materials and other solutions are under development and have been extensively discussed by Jörgensen's review.3 On the other hand, inorganic nanomaterials do not easily degrade over time4 providing a longer lifetime to the hybrid blends and related electronic devices.5–7 Inorganic quantum dots (QDs) are the most used inorganic nanomaterials in hybrid blends for photovoltaics because of their tunable band-gap over visible and infra-red spectral ranges. In addition, multiple exciton generation effects occurring in several types of QDs can potentially lead to high photovoltaic conversion efficiency.8
Despite these promising properties one of the main factors limiting the performances of polymer–QD heterojunction solar cells is the poor charge transport among QDs in blends, due to the low carrier mobility leading to cell efficiencies of still around 4%.9 The low carrier mobility of QDs is often ascribed to the inefficient charge transfer processes between the nanocrystals themselves due to the presence of organic capping agents, which are used during their synthesis in order to avoid nanocrystal aggregation and the loss of quantum properties. These organic ligands are usually long alkyl chains that need to be replaced by shorter ligands after the synthesis through suitable ligand exchange processes that improve charge mobility while retaining the good miscibility of the dots in the polymer solution for a homogeneous blend.
Alternative non-toxic inorganic nanomaterials that do not require the use of ligands during and after their synthesis are tungsten disulfide (WS2) nanotubes (NTs). Moreover, they can extend the absorption region of the blend into the infrared region. Bulk WS2 is a metal dichalcogenide compound characterized by a direct bandgap at ∼1.95 eV and a small indirect bandgap at ∼1.3 eV.10 WS2 nanotubes were firstly synthesized in 199211 and nowadays pure multiwall WS2 nanotubes are available in macroscopic quantities on the market (about 0.5 kg per day).12 WS2 nanotubes are known mainly for their excellent mechanical behavior13 and reinforcing properties of polymer composites14 based on resins,15 thermoplastic polymers,16 and elastomers.17 Just recently the first nanocomposites of WS2 NTs and conductive polymers have been reported. They have shown to increase polyaniline conductivity by efficient doping18 and preserve OLED device performances until high percentage loading (about 10%).19 Anyway, their use in hybrid blends is quite challenging and unexplored.
In this work we have investigated the possibility of using WS2 both as the sole acceptor material blended with a polymer and in systems of a polymer and QDs to improve the performances of this better known system. We report a series of both static and time-resolved spectroscopic studies on binary blend systems, composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and WS2 NTs (P3HT/WS2), and P3HT and cadmium selenide (CdSe) QDs (P3HT/CdSe), and a ternary blend system (P3HT/CdSe/WS2). The ternary blends were prepared keeping a fixed ratio between P3HT and CdSe, and varying the concentrations of WS2 nanotubes in a range between 9 and 33 wt% with respect to the total weight of the blend.
2 Methods
2.1 Materials
The P3HT polymer was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, WS2 nanotubes from NanoMaterials Ltd, and CdSe QDs (absorbing at 620 nm) from NN-Labs. All the solvents were furnished by Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
2.2 Binary and ternary blend preparation
WS2 nanotubes were purified and disagglomerated before use. 1 g of material was dispersed in 1 l of 2-propanol and sonicated for 2 hours at low power. Successively they were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 15 minutes, and the supernatant was collected and dried in a vacuum to give purified nanotubes. To prepare the P3HT–WS2 binary blends, P3HT was dissolved in chlorobenzene at the concentration of 20 mg ml−1 and the solution was stirred for 15 minutes at 60 °C and for one hour at room temperature. It was then filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE filter and mixed with different amounts of WS2 chlorobenzene suspension (20 mg ml−1) to obtain blends with WS2 loading of 5, 10, 25, 50, and 75 wt%.
The QDs were provided in toluene solution by the company. In order to remove the excess ligand they were treated before usage. Indeed after precipitation and washing in acetone, they were dried and re-dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 20 mg ml−1. P3HT–CdSe binary blends were prepared by mixing different amounts of CdSe QD chlorobenzene solution with the polymer solution to obtain blends with QD loading of 25, 50, and 70 wt%. The resulting mixtures were stirred for 2 hours at room temperature to obtain homogenous nanocomposites.
For the preparation of ternary blends we followed a two step process. First a fixed volume of CdSe QD chlorobenzene solution (20 mg ml−1) was mixed with the appropriate amount of solid WS2 nanotubes to obtain the CdSe:WS2 weight ratio of 1:0.2, 1:0.5, 1:0.75, and 1:1. The mixtures were sonicated for 40 minutes.
Then the same volume of chlorobenzene polymer solution at the same concentration (20 mg ml−1) was added to each new solution. In this way it was possible to maintain the P3HT:CdSe weight ratio constant while varying the weight concentration of the nanotubes in the ternary mixture (9, 20, 27, and 33 wt%).
All the solutions were deposited by spin coating on glass substrates at 1000 rpm for 30 s, at room temperature. The substrates were pre-cleaned by sonication in d.i. water and the deconex detergent, acetone and subsequently in 2-propanol. The films were homogeneous and their thickness was in the range of 80–100 nm as measured using a Tencor profilometer.
2.3 Optical measurements
The pure polymer and the nanocomposite blend layers were characterized by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 Spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence emission (PL) of the same films was measured using a Fluorolog 3 instrument, Horiba Jobin Yvon Instruments SA.
The ultra-fast fluorescence emission experiments were performed using a femtosecond laser based system. The Second Harmonic output of a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire oscillator with the wavelength fixed at 800 nm was used as the excitation beam. The pulse duration was 70 fs and the repetition rate 80 MHz. A portion of this fundamental beam was frequency doubled to create the excitation beam with a wavelength of 400 nm. Fluorescence from the sample was focused on a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal along with the 800 nm fundamental beam. The fluorescence emitted at different emission wavelengths was mixed in the BBO crystal with the gate beam to generate sum frequency photons, which were detected using a photomultiplier tube. Data were acquired using Lab-View software and subsequently analyzed. The temporal reconstruction of the signal was obtained through a micrometrical precise delay line on the gate beam. The resolution of the system was measured to be 150 fs. Sample degradation was avoided by performing the measurements under flowing nitrogen and using a translation stage to move the sample within the beam, removing the effect of photobleaching and providing data averaged across the whole sample. The system has been already described in previous studies20,21 and the optical scheme is reported in the ESI† section (Fig. S1).
3 Results and discussion
In P3HT–WS2 blends we have investigated the possibility of using WS2 NTs as an electron acceptor due to the favorable band alignment between the polymer and the NTs. In Fig. 1(a) the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are reported both for WS2 and P3HT.10,22
 Fig. 1  (a) P3HT and WS2 energy levels. Pure P3HT, WS2 and P3HT–WS2 blends. (b) UV-Vis absorption spectra and (c) emission spectra after excitation at 400 nm. The intensity of the excitation beam is kept constant for all the measurements and the data are corrected for the number of absorbed photons. 

Fig. 1(b) shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of P3HT/WS2 nanocomposites with an increasing amount of WS2 NTs, ranging from 5 to 50 wt%, together with those of pristine P3HT and WS2 films for comparison. As expected the absorption signal between 400 and 630 nm, mainly due to the polymer, reduces as a function of the NT concentration because the relative amount of P3HT in the blend decreases accordingly. Moreover, a clear effect of the NT addition is an increase of the absorption of nanocomposites in the region between 630 and 800 nm, around the maximum absorption of NTs.
The emission spectra of pure P3HT and P3HT/WS2 nanocomposite films are shown in Fig. 1(c). All the emissions have been collected, after excitation at 400 nm, in whole visible and near infrared regions. The fluorescence signals of the blends are essentially dominated by the polymer contribution, since the NTs are not emissive, being an indirect bandgap material.23
The fluorescence spectra have been corrected by the number of photons absorbed at 400 nm where the sample was excited. It is clear that the fluorescence intensity of the P3HT is just very slightly quenched by the presence of the WS2 NTs indicating that no transfer mechanism is taking place between the two materials in the blends. Indeed, the quenching values are quite small (around 10%) for all NT concentrations. This suggests that such small variation can be attributed more to the different thickness and uniformity of the films and/or experimental uncertainty than to a real quenching effect. This result has also been confirmed by the time resolved measurements performed on all the blends showing that the lifetime of the polymer does not change due to the presence of the NTs. These data are reported in the ESI.†
An alternative way to exploit the properties of WS2 NTs could be using them in ternary blends of polymer and inorganic QDs. In previous studies ternary hybrid systems composed of polymers blended with carbon nanotubes (CNT) and QDs have shown interesting physical phenomena such as long-lived charge transfer and luminescence quenching via energy transfer and reduced blinking.24 In these systems the NT backbone is expected to promote carrier mobility25 and QD dispersion that are both very relevant factors for an efficient bulk heterojunction photovoltaic solar cell.
Starting from these observations, we wish to explore the spectroscopic properties of the ternary blend system P3HT–QDs–WS2, with the aim of testing its application as an active layer in hybrid solar cells with respect to the binary system P3HT–CdSe.
P3HT–CdSe hybrid blends are among the most studied hybrid nanocomposites where the polymer photoluminescence is quenched by the CdSe quantum dots.26,27 Nevertheless, there is room for addressing some critical points in this binary system. In particular the efficiency of charge separation at the donor/acceptor interface is crucial to the photocurrent generation in hydrid solar cells, and a complete understanding of this process is essential to optimize it.28–30 In order to follow this route, different amounts of WS2 nanotubes have been added to the P3HT–CdSe blends. The idea is to facilitate the charge generation at the interface and make possible the energy transfer between the QDs and the NTs. In our case, upon adding NTs, P3HT is the donor material and both CdSe QDs and WS2 NTs could act as the acceptors.
In the framework of Förster theory of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, the energy transfer phenomenon is mediated by a long-range dipole–dipole interaction between donor and acceptor molecules. The occurrence of an energy transfer event requires spectral overlap of the donor emission spectrum with the acceptor absorption spectrum for energy conservation. The maximum distance over which Förster energy transfer can, typically, occur is 30–50 Å.31,32

Fig. 2(a) clearly shows that the alignment of the energy levels of P3HT, CdSe and WS2 is very favorable for this kind of transfer. In the same way CdSe QDs and P3HT emission and WS2 nanotube absorption peaks, Fig. 2(b), nicely overlap satisfying the requirement for Förster energy transfer. Indeed the WS2 NTs can in principle efficiently absorb at around 650 nm both the less intense light emitted by the P3HT and the more intense light emitted by the CdSe QDs. Because the NTs are not emissive the occurrence of this energy transfer could not be probed directly by monitoring the WS2 emission as is usually done.10,33 In an equivalent way we have proceeded to monitor the changes of the static and dynamic emission of the QDs induced by the presence of different amounts of NTs.
 Fig. 2  (a) P3HT, CdSe and WS2 energy levels and (b) CdSe and P3HT emission spectra and WS2 absorption peak. 
In Fig. 3(a) the normalized static emissions of the pure QDs, pure P3HT and the P3HT–CdSe blends are reported. For the blends and the polymer the normalization was done with respect to the P3HT peak emission at 720 nm. This value has been chosen because at this wavelength there is no contribution from the QDs or the nanotubes. As expected, the emission from the QDs becomes more pronounced as their concentration in the blends increases, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3(a) even if the total emission is quenched (data are reported in the ESI† section).26–35 Interestingly, upon increasing the QD concentrations in the blend the emission peak linearly blue shifts from 660 nm, the position of the pure P3HT peak, to 640 nm, where the bare CdSe emission is centered (data are reported in the ESI† section). At this point we fixed the CdSe amount with respect to the P3HT in the blend at 50 wt% and varied the NT concentration. In Fig. 3(b) the emission spectra of the P3HT–CdSe blend without NTs (namely sample CdSe–WS2 0) together with all the ternary blends P3HT–CdSe–WS2 containing different amounts of nanotubes (from 9 to 33%), but the same amount of polymer and QDs, are reported. Also in this case the spectra are shown to be normalized with respect to the polymer emission at 720 nm. It is clear that the QD emission peak is strongly reduced by the presence of the nanotubes. This result suggests that the emission of the QDs is reabsorbed by the NTs and so an energy transfer process is efficiently taking place between the CdSe and the WS2 nanotubes. Therefore, following the exciton dynamics is a powerful method for evaluating these processes inside the blends. In order to probe the nature of this transfer in greater detail and evaluate the quenching effects, also in the lifetime of the exciton, time resolved fluorescence measurements have been performed on the ternary blend samples containing different amounts of WS2 nanotubes. Energy transfer processes occur typically on time scales ranging from picoseconds to nanoseconds for singlet energy transfer.
 Fig. 3  Emission spectra normalized at 720 nm after excitation at 400 nm of (a) P3HT–CdSe blends and (b) P3HT–CdSe–WS2 blends. 
The study of the fluorescence signals in the femtosecond (fs) to picosecond (ps) time range allows following the dynamics of the fluorescent excitons generated immediately after absorption right up until charge separation. The fluorescence decay time strongly depends on the nanocomposition of the blends and the energy transfer process inside the blends.
The emission decays have been measured exciting the sample at 400 nm and collecting the fluorescence decays at 650 nm where the contribution of both the polymer and the QDs is present. The fluorescence decays for the ternary blend samples are reported in Fig. 4(a) with WS2 contents varying from 9 wt% to 33 wt% with respect to the P3HT–CdSe 50 wt% blend (indicated as CdSe–WS2_0). Pristine P3HT has also been reported for clarity.
 Fig. 4  (a) Normalized fluorescence decays and (b) lifetimes vs. WS2 wt% in the ternary blend. 
It can be observed that the fluorescence decays are faster in the ternary blends with respect to pure P3HT, and the lifetimes decrease for increasing concentrations of nanotubes in the blends. It appears that for concentrations higher than 27 wt% the values of lifetimes reach a saturation level.
The kinetics is well described by a double exponential decay, a fast and a slow phase correlated with different phenomena as described in ref. 34. Indeed the emission at this wavelength (650 nm) is given by a contribution from both CdSe QDs and P3HT polymer emission. The results of the double fitting procedure (starting from the maximum of the signal, thus excluding processes occurring within the response function) are reported in Fig. 4(b). Lifetimes rapidly decrease as a function of nanotube concentration from about 100 to 40 ps. These results indicate that the quenching effect is most probably due to an energy transfer between the QDs and the WS2 nanotubes.
4 Conclusions
In this work we have reported unprecedented fluorescence quenching effects in the hybrid ternary system P3HT–CdSe–WS2 due to WS2 NT addition to P3HT–CdSe QD blends. Static and time-resolved fluorescence decays give a strong indication of an efficient energy transfer process from the QDs to the WS2 NTs in the ternary blend, responsible for fluorescence quenching. On the other hand, in the binary blend P3HT–WS2 no fluorescence quenching has been detected suggesting the absence of energy or electron transfer processes in this system. The evidence of energetic interaction between WS2 NTs and QDs, observed in purely inorganic systems,23 and here established for the first time in hybrid nanocomposites with P3HT opens new possible fields of application to metal dichalcogenide nanomaterials, which are non-toxic and nowadays available in large amounts. Moreover, our results provide new insights into the physics of hybrid blends based on conjugated polymers and QDs and promising improvements of the corresponding hybrid solar cell performances.
