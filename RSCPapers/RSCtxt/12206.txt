    , Accepted 30th November 2020First published on 7th December 2020AbstractSignificant progress has been made in organic solar cells over the past few years. However, the power conversion efficiency of all-small-molecule systems is still lower than that of polymer photovoltaics. Ternary strategies lead to a potential way to improve the performance of all-small-molecule organic solar systems. In this article, an all-small-molecule ternary organic solar cell is presented by incorporating a small amount of the IDIC acceptor into a ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl based binary system. On the basis of the enhanced absorption spectrum, the good miscibility enabled by two structurally similar acceptors can potentially form receptor alloys, leading to a simultaneous increase in both short circuit current density and open circuit voltage to 18.64 mA cm−2 and 0.90 V, respectively. Characterizations such as transmission electron microscopy and grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering confirmed good miscibility, ordered packing and high crystallinity in the ternary film with a fibrous structure that benefits electron transfer, increasing the fill factor to 69.66%. The simultaneous increment in short circuit current, open circuit voltage and fill factor increases the power conversion efficiency from 10.81% in the binary system to 11.65% in the ternary system.
1. Introduction
Among various photovoltaic devices, organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn plenty of attention in recent years owing to their flexibility, tenability, low cost and potential of roll-to-roll fabrication.1–5 Due to the unstable nature and relatively weak absorption in the visible light regime of fullerene acceptors,6–9 as well as the low reproducibility and high batch-to-batch variation of polymer donors,10–12 non-fullerene all-small-molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs) have attracted considerable academic interest and a high efficiency of over 15% has been achieved.13,14 However, the performance of the ASM-OSCs is still incomparable to that of polymer photovoltaics,15–20 partially limited by the mismatch of the absorption spectrum or energy levels of the donors and acceptors.21 Thus, ternary OSCs were designed to overcome these issues by forming a complementary absorption spectrum or cascade energy level alignment. In this article, small-molecule ternary OSCs were fabricated by mixing a small amount of structurally similar acceptor IDIC into a pre-optimized binary system with ZR1-Cl as the donor and IDIC-4Cl as the acceptor.22 The structurally similar acceptor IDIC formed a complementary absorption spectrum with IDIC-4Cl, which leads to an increase in short circuit current density (JSC) to 18.64 mA cm−2 due to the enhanced light absorption. Moreover, the addition of IDIC also lifted the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptors, enlarging the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptors, which increased the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the cell from 0.87 V to 0.90 V. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) confirmed a high miscibility of the ternary blend. The mixed ternary system formed a highly ordered thin film with a fibrous structure, which benefits charge transfer and improved the fill factor (FF) to 69.66%. The simultaneous increment in JSC, VOC and FF increased the PCE of ASM-OSCs from 10.81% in the binary system to 11.65% in the ternary system.
2. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the donor ZR1-Cl, and acceptors IDIC-4Cl and IDIC are shown in Fig. 1. The only difference between the two acceptors is four chloride terminal groups on IDIC-4Cl. The structurally similar acceptors ensured good compatibility,23 forming a cascade energy level alignment and a complimentary absorption spectrum that helps to improve the overall PCE.

Fig. 2a and b show the normalized UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the ZR1-Cl, IDIC-4Cl and IDIC in chloroform solution as well as in thin films, respectively. The removal of Cl substituents caused a small blue shift in the absorption spectrum of IDIC compared with IDIC-4Cl, resulting in complimentary absorption that enhanced the light absorbing ability of the ternary blend and increased the JSC. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the donor and acceptors were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV)24 and calculated to be −5.50 eV/−3.60 eV, −5.77 eV/−3.98 eV and −5.85 eV/−4.05 eV for ZR1-Cl, IDIC and IDIC-4Cl, respectively. This is consistent with the theory that chlorination could lower the energy levels of molecules.25 In this case, IDIC formed a cascade energy alignment with ZR1-Cl and IDIC-4Cl (Fig. 2c), which not only benefited energy transfer and exciton dissociation, but also lifted the LUMO of the acceptors and increased VOC.

A conventional device structure with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al architecture was fabricated to measure the photovoltaic properties of the binary and ternary solar cells. Optimum photovoltaic performance was reached after thermal annealing at 120 °C and solvent vapour annealing with dichloromethane. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of binary and ternary OSCs with different acceptor ratios are listed in Table S1 (ESI†), and the corresponding J–V curves are plotted in Fig. S1 (ESI†), showing that the VOC of the ternary OSCs increases with the amount of IDIC, which is plotted in Fig. 3a and can be explained by the alloy model26,27 and is consistent with the energy alignment shown in Fig. 2c. The highest PCE of ternary blends reached 11.65% at the active layer ratio of ZR1-Cl :IDIC-4Cl :IDIC = 1:0.8:0.2. The photovoltaic properties of the optimum ternary and binary OSCs are summarized in Table 1, while the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curve and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve are plotted in Fig. 3b and c respectively. Compared with the ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl binary device, which provided a VOC of 0.87 V, a JSC of 18.30 mA cm−2, an FF of 68.03% and an overall PCE of 10.69%, the ternary blend exhibited a simultaneous increase in all three parameters (VOC: 0.90 V; JSC: 18.64 mA cm−2, FF: 69.66%), leading to an ultimate increase in PCE to 11.65%. Further increasing the percentage of IDIC led to an enhancement in VOC with significant decrease in both JSC and FF, causing a sudden drop in efficiency. This change in photo-generated current upon the addition of IDIC might be due to the trade-off between the complementary absorption spectrum and the blue shift of the absorption edge. The small percentage of IDIC in the acceptors could facilitate light capturing and benefit current generation by forming a complementary absorption spectrum with ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl, while a large portion of IDIC would narrow the absorption spectrum by a blue shift of the absorption edge. As a result, the binary device composed of ZR1-Cl:IDIC exhibited a low PCE of 6.53%, with an increase in VOC to 1.022 V, but a large decrease in both JSC and FF to 13.46 mA cm−2 and 47.46%, respectively. The JSC values of ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl, ZR1-Cl:IDIC and ternary blends calculated from the EQE spectra are 17.55, 13.30 and 17.99 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the measured JSC.

The charge carrier mobility of each device was determined by space charge-limited current (SCLC) and plotted in Fig. 4a and b, where electron mobility was determined by devices with Al/active layer/Al architecture, while hole mobility was detected by ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au device structure. The hole/electron mobilities of devices with ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl, ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl:IDIC and ZR1-Cl:IDIC as active layers were calculated to be 2.99 × 10−4/3.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 6.05 × 10−4/6.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 5.04 × 10−6/6.69 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. A higher carrier mobility and better balanced μe/μh (1.12) were achieved by the ternary blend compared with the binary devices, providing a better charge transport property verified by the enhancement in JSC and FF.28,29

To gain more insight into light absorption and exciton dissociation processes in active layers, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) was investigated and plotted in Fig. 4c. When the effective voltage is large enough (i.e., Veff ≥2 V) so that all photo-generated excitons are dissociated, Jph reached saturation and is defined as Jsat. The Jsat values were 18.26 mA cm−2 for the ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl system, 19.32 mA cm−2 for the ternary system and 14.76 mA cm−2 for the ZR1-Cl:IDIC system, which is consistent with the measured JSC. Moreover, exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) were obtained by calculating the ratio of Jph/Jsat. Under short-circuit conditions, the ηdiss values were calculated to be 95.33% for the ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl system, 96.02% for the ternary system and 87.63% mA cm−2 for the ZR1-Cl:IDIC system, while under maximum power conditions, the ηcoll values were calculated to be 67.88% for the ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl system, 72.58% for the ternary system and 59.73% for the ZR1-Cl:IDIC system. The ternary blend showed the highest exciton dissociation rate and charge collecting efficiency, guaranteeing a high FF of 69.66% and a JSC of 18.64 mA cm−2.
The surface morphology of the binary and ternary active layers was obtained via atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 5(a–c). A decrease in RMS roughness can be observed with the addition of IDIC in the ternary film compared with the ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl film, indicating excellent molecular compatibility between IDIC-4Cl and IDIC. A suitable phase separation was also obtained in the ternary film, ensuring a better photovoltaic performance. The bulk morphology and phase distribution of binary and ternary active layers were investigated via transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 5(d–f), both binary and ternary films formed an interconnected network structure without distinct large phase separation, which helps to reduce electron–hole recombination and is beneficial for exciton separation. (A larger figure of AFM with a clearer view is shown in Fig. S2, ESI†.). One thing worth noticing is that a nanowire-like fibrous structure is observed in ternary and binary blends with IDIC as the acceptor. These fibrils, originated from self-assembly of donor molecule ZR1-Cl, were rarely reported in ASM-OSCs and can effectively facilitate charge transport, which gave rise to high JSC and FF, resulting in high PCE.22,30

Two dimensional grazing-incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) was conducted to gain an insight into the molecular packing and orientation of the pristine films (Fig. S3, ESI†) as well as the binary and ternary active layers (Fig. 6). The donor ZR1-Cl showed strong edge-on orientation, whereas two acceptors showed clear face-on orientation. Moreover, the (100) lamellar diffraction peak of IDIC-4Cl was stronger than that of IDIC along the in-plane (IP) direction, indicating a stronger crystallinity of IDIC-4Cl than IDIC, verified by the calculated crystal coherent length of 89.53 Å and 42.83 Å, respectively. On the other hand, (010) π–π stacking diffraction peaks could be observed along both the IP and out-of-plane (OOP) directions for all three blend films, revealing that both face-on and edge-on orientations are present in the blend films. The coexistence of face-on and edge-on orientation could facilitate intermolecular charge transfer inside the blends, which accounts for the enhancement in both JSC and FF. Additionally, the (100) lamellar diffraction peak of the ternary blend is identical to that of the binary blend with IDIC-4Cl as the acceptor, whereas the (100) peak is almost absent for the binary blend with IDIC as the acceptor, indicating that the crystallinity of the ternary blend was not affected by the addition of IDIC.

To further investigate the molecular miscibility in the blend films, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed by heating the sample to 300 °C and cooling to 0 °C at a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. The corresponding thermograms of both pristine small molecules as well as the blend samples are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The double peak of IDIC, which was also reported by Ma et al.,31 could be explained by the polymorphic structure of IDIC.32 Both IDIC and IDIC-4Cl exhibited high melting temperature (Tm) of 285.96 °C and 274.27 °C, respectively. After blending with each other, an obvious decrease in Tm can be observed (260.11 °C). This reduction in Tm is similar to the phenomenon observed in inorganic alloys.32,33 The change in Tm was further studied by calculating the molecular interaction parameter (χ) through the Nishi-Wang formalism, with higher χ indicating a lower molecular miscibility and higher phase purity.34,35 The calculated χ values were 1.94 for the IDIC:IDIC-4Cl system, 2.70 for the IDIC:ZR1-Cl system, and 2.54 for the IDIC-4Cl:ZR1-Cl system, confirming excellent miscibility between IDIC-4Cl and IDIC in the ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl:IDIC ternary system, which is consistent with the previous discussion.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a small amount of IDIC was incorporated into the ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl binary device to further improve the performance of ASM-OSCs. Two receptors with similar structures formed complementary absorption spectra and cascade energy alignment, adapting alloy properties and increased JSC and VOC of the ternary OSC to 18.64 mA cm−2 and 0.90 V, respectively. Characterization such as AFM, TEM, GIWAXS and DSC revealed appropriate surface morphology of the ternary blend with good compatibility between the two acceptors, maintaining high crystallinity as well as advantageous fibrous structure that facilitated charge transport and delivered a FF of 69.66%. The simultaneous increase in JSC, VOC and FF gave an overall improvement in PCE from 10.81% to 11.65%. This article verified the effectiveness and general applicability of methods to further improve the efficiency of ASM-OSCs by incorporating structurally similar receptors, providing a potential approach to construct high efficiency OSCs.
