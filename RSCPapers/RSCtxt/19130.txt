    , Accepted 23rd April 2022First published on 13th May 2022AbstractElectrocatalytic H2 generation under mild neutral conditions is an attractive proposition yet underdeveloped. Herein, a series of nonconsecutive carbon-coated RuP2 porous microsheets (RuP2@InC-MSs) was synthesized through an environmentally benign one-pot thermolysis route using low-cost and safe P-containing small molecules as phosphorization agents, including guanidine phosphate, amidinourea phosphate, and ammonium phosphate. Benefitting from the unique dual active site exposure, the RuP2@InC-MSs acted as superior bifunctional electrocatalysts in neutral electrolyte towards both the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR, −48 mV@10 mA cm−2) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, −83 mv@10 mA cm−2), thus demonstrating the energy-saving H2 production in a two-electrode hybrid water electrolyzer (0.366 V@10 mA cm−2). Further, an integrated solar-to-H2 device generated abundant green H2 gas with a current of 146 mA under natural sunlight, demonstrating its great potential for coupling applications with sustainable energy resources. This work provides guidelines for constructing metal phosphide–carbon nanohybrids, and facilitates the development of energy-efficient neutral H2 production.
Introduction
Electrocatalysts are the core, imaging the blueprint of electrocatalytic refinery (e-refinery) for combating the terawatt global energy demand while the rigorous goal of the two-degree-scenario established via the Paris Climate Agreement.1,2 Nowadays, numerous advanced nanostructures have been developed to steadily approach the thermodynamic limit of water electrolysis for green H2 generation in acidic or alkaline environments via the use of renewable but intermittent electricity;3,4 however, the corrosive operating conditions severely limit the catalyst species concentrated on the scarce and expensive noble metals, which imposes stringent constraints on electrolyzers and membranes.5,6 Being able to perform the water electrolysis in an environmentally benign and biocompatible neutral environment would significantly prolong the lifetime of the equipment, and more importantly, potentially enable the direct use of low-grade and impure water, such as the most abundant saltwater or sewage,7–10 offering hope for the long-term running of such processes. At the same time, the poor ion conductivity and the serious scarcity of hydronium and hydroxyl ions are pushing the voltage far away from 1.5 V, motivating the pursuit of more sophisticated and effective materials.11,12 For finding an effective solution, besides overcoming the sluggish kinetics,13–15 breaking the thermodynamics bottleneck is also important.16,17
Recently, it was proposed that hydrazine-oxidation-assisted hydrogen evolution could potentially realize energy-saving H2 generation in alkaline conditions.18,19 For example, Sun et al. reported that a Ni2P nanoarray electrode could act as a hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) catalyst and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HER) catalyst to drive a high current density of 500 mA cm−2 at a low applied voltage of 1.0 V in 1.0 M KOH/0.5 M N2H4 electrolyte.20 Our previous work also demonstrated that nanostructure engineering, including dual-doping and an artificial heterointerface construction for transition metal nitrides, can endow the catalysts with bifunctionality to achieve energy-saving H2 production in an alkaline electrolyte,21–23 in which, Ni3N–Co3N heterointerface arrays can optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy and hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics simultaneously, thus achieving impressive bifunctionality with a small applied voltage of 0.76 V for 400 mA cm−2.22 Despite these inspiring achievements, efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for use in neutral conditions have been rarely reported, severely hindering the development of advanced techniques for neutral electrolyte based H2 production. This mainly stems from the exponentially increased difficulties encountered when attempting to integrate the special active centres for neutral HER and HzOR, respectively, into a single material, requiring a highly precise design with a facile strategy for large-scale application. However, the advantages of simplifying the preparation of electrode materials and deciphering the relationship between different reactive intermediates with the active sites by only constructing one kind of DFT model or a similar model for realizing bifunctional HzOR and HER are driving the design of bifunctional catalysts as a matter of urgency.
Herein, we report a general and environmentally benign one-pot thermolysis approach to generate RuP2 porous microsheets composed of interconnected nanoparticles with nonconsecutive carbon coatings (denoted as RuP2@InC-MSs), with small organic molecules as phosphidization agents, such as guanidine phosphate (GP), amidinourea phosphate (AuP), and ammonium phosphate (AP). Taking RuP2@InC-MS synthesized with GP as an example, it exhibited a Pt-like bifunctional performance towards HzOR and HER in 1.0 M PBS electrolyate, where an ultralow working potential of −48 mV and a small overpotential of 83 mV could achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Importantly, the theoretical calculations indicated that the dual active sites of C and Ru in the unique RuP2 microsheet were responsible for the HER and HzOR activity, respectively. Specifically, RuP2@InC-MS was endowed a modified H adsorption/desorption behaviour (ΔGH* = 0.16 eV) over pure RuP2 (ΔGH* = −0.43 eV) for accelerating H2 evolution; also with a decreased energy barrier (0.68 eV) comparted to that of RuP2 (0.85 eV) for the dehydrogenation of the intermediates during the whole HzOR process. Impressively, it could achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low cell voltage of 366 mV for overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) in the two-electrode system, demonstrating great potential for energy-saving H2 production. To demonstrate the extendable application for solar-to-H2 conversion, an integrated device was realized with powering the hybrid water electrolysis system with a commercial photovoltaic cell (OCV: 2.0 V), where a decent current of 146 mA was achieved under natural sunlight.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of RuP2@InC-MS
This generalized strategy can be intuitively described according to Scheme 1. Here, a facile mixing of RuCl3, melamine, and a P source, such as GP, or AuP, or AP, was followed by conventional thermal annealing treatment under an Ar atmosphere. Benefitting from the electrostatic interactions of melamine with the Ru3+ or phosphate, the Ru and P were mixed uniformly at the molecular scale, hence forming regularly distributed nanoparticles in the whole microsheet, as shown in the aerial field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image (Fig. 1a). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1b) presented a micron-size sheet-like morphology with plentiful voids, indicating its porous topological feature. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image (Fig. S1†) presented a brighter contrast area, implying the existence of heavy elements in the nanoparticles. The corresponding elemental mapping results (Fig. 1c) portrayed the presence of the C element besides Ru and P. Detailed investigations of the architecture of this hybrid structure were then conducted through high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis. First, the major part of the small nanoparticles in the microsheet was confirmed as the RuP2 phase (Fig. 1d and S2†), where the clear lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 3.85 Å could be well indexed to the (110) plane of the orthorhombic RuP2 phase (PDF#34-0333, upper inset in Fig. 1d). Interestingly, the surface of the nanoparticle (marked with the cyan dotted line) was partially coated with a carbon layer (marked with the yellow dotted lines), as indicated in Fig. 1d, suggesting the formation of the hybrid structure of RuP2 microsheets with nonconsecutive carbon layers (schematic inset in Fig. 1d). For demystifying the special existence, the elemental abundance of the single nanoparticle was analyzed (Fig. S3†). The same space for Ru and P elements (Ru and P mapping images in Fig. 1e) confirmed the single entity was mainly composed of RuP2. Interestingly, the C element (mapping in Fig. 1e) mostly occupied the lower region of the investigated area, as labelled with the yellow dotted lines, indicating the carbon layers nonconsecutively covered the inner RuP2 core (Ru + C mapping in Fig. 1e). Importantly, the nonconsecutive cabon-coated RuP2 nanoparticles existed universally in the microsheet, as shown in Fig. 1f and S4.† Further, the specific surface area of this hybrid, as obtained from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm curve (Fig. S5†), was 13.6 m2 g−1, implying a high ratio of heavy constituents (RuP2) in this microsheet. This reveals that the porous microsheets consisting of interconnected RuP2 nanoparticles with nonconsecutive carbon coating (denoted as RuP2@InC-MS) had been successfully prepared. This RuP2-based microsheet structure is different with the others as well as those our group has previously reported. For carbon-based micro/nanostructures decorated with RuPx based particles,24,25 such as the S-doped RuP nanoparticles-embedded N,P,S-codoped carbon sheet matrix (S–RuP@NPSC),26 Ru2P nanoparticle decorated P/N dual-doped carbon nanofiber on carbon cloth (Ru2P@PNC/CC),27 and RuP2 nanoparticles-encapsulated N, P dual-doped carbon framework (RuP2@NPC),28 which may imply its special properties. It is worth emphasizing that the unique armour of nonconsecutive C on the RuP2 unit may not only expose multiple active sites for different catalytic reactions, but also strengthen its stability, which is of great significance for bifunctional electrocatalysis.29 Remarkably, the other transition metal phosphides, such as PtP2 (Fig. S6†), Pd5P2 (Fig. S7†), Ni2P (Fig. S8†), FeP (Fig. S9†), and CoP (Fig. S10†), could also be synthesized by just changing the kind of metal species, demonstrating the generality of preparing various TMPs via this one-pot strategy.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization identified the characteristic signals of Ru, P, and C elements, as shown in the survey spectrum (Fig. S11†). The high-resolution spectrum ranged from 278 to 288 eV and could be deconvoluted into two types of peaks (Fig. 1g), one couple containing the characteristics for CC, C–C, and C–P, C–O–P bonds in the C matrix, suggesting the presence of P-doped carbon in the microsheet,30 while the other located at 280.5 (lower than 279.8 eV of the metallic Ru) and 284.1 eV were the Ru 3d spin-splitting peaks, attributed to RuP2 with a partial positive charge (δ+) of Ru.28,31,32 In addition, the core level peaks at 461.2 and 483.3 eV in Fig. 1h are for Ru 3p3/2 and 3p1/2 in the RuP2 species.33 In the P 2p high-resolution spectrum (Fig. 1i), one pair of peaks at 127/131 eV is related to the spin splitting of P (δ−) in RuP2.34 The peak that emerged at 133.9 eV was associated with phosphate-like P, which may be ascribed to the surface oxidation when the sample was exposed to the atmosphere.35 The peak with a binding energy of 132.1 eV, smaller than that of P0 (130.2 eV), could imply the possible charge transfer from P to C in the P-doping C matrix.28,36 The charge interaction from Ru to P and P to C in the RuP2@InC MS may activate the heterointerface charge, which was positive to improve the multifunctional performance.36,37
Characterization of RuP2@InC-MS synthesized with other P sources
To verify the generality of the environmentally benign strategy, other phosphorization agents, including AuP and AP, were also utilized as P sources to synthesize the RuP2@InC MS. As shown in Fig. 2a–c, the porous nanoparticle-assembled microsheet containing C, Ru, and P elements was successfully fabricated via a similar method except for using AuP as the P source instead of GP. The HRTEM analysis (Fig. 2d) presented similar microstructures, namely the nanoparticle with the (110) plane of RuP2 (Fig. S12†) was coated by nonconsecutive carbon. The XPS investigation (Fig. S13a†) further detected the signals of C, Ru, and P. The characteristic spectra situated at 279.55 eV in the Ru 3d5/2 spectrum (Fig. 2e), 461.40 eV in the Ru 3p3/2 spectrum (Fig. S13b†), 128.75 eV in the P 2p3/2 spectrum (Fig. 2f), as well as the corresponding spin-splitted peaks of Ru 3d3/2, Ru 3p1/2, and P 2p1/2 could be ascribed to RuP2. The other fitting peaks at 285.85 eV in the C 1s spectrum of Fig. 2e and 132.05 eV in Fig. 2f co-suggested the existence of P-doped carbon. Remarkably, a weak signal at 496.30 eV in the Ru 3p envelope was ascribed to the Auger peak of Na, likely originating from phosphate/phosphite groups.38 Hence, the organic AuP was effective for synthesizing RuP2@InC-MS. Moreover, when using inorganic AP as the P source, the resultant product also displayed comparable nanoparticles consisting of a sheet-like morphology along with the coexistence of C, Ru, and P elements (Fig. 2g–i) and a similar microstructure of nonconsecutive carbon layers decorated with well-defined RuP2 grains (Fig. S14† and 2j), as well as the close surface species and their chemical valences (Fig. S15 and 2k and l) compared to those obtained by GP or AuP, thus confirming the generality of the green synthesis for fabricating nonconsecutive carbon-coated RuP2 porous microsheets.

Investigation of the electrocatalytic HzOR activities
The classical three-electrode configuration with Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and graphite rod as the counter electrode was first utilized to investigate the HzOR activity in 1.0 M PBS containing a certain amount of hydrazine (N2H4). First, the contents of GDA and the calcination temperatures were tuned to screen for the optimal sample, where the RuP2@InC-MS sample synthesized at 850 °C with 15 mmol of GDA presented the best performance (Fig. S16–21†), and thus was further used to execute a series of electrochemistry tests towards hydrazine oxidation. By comparing the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves recorded in various N2H4 concentrations (Fig. S22†), a quick current response was displayed in the potential window of −0.2–0.8 V (vs. RHE) upon adding 0.05 M of N2H4, representing an advance over the reported values in similar neutral conditions (50 mM N2H4).39–42 The current signal showed a steady increment until the concentration of N2H4 reached 1.0 M, suggesting the promising HzOR activity of RuP2@InC-MS. Then, operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at various potentials to explore the interface behaviour of RuP2@InC-MS towards N2H4 molecule. The Nyquist plots (Fig. S23†) displayed a complete semicircle at only −0.1 V, meaning the occurrence of a Faradaic reaction.43 Also, a noticeable shrinkage of these semicircles was noted with the increased potential from −0.1 to 0.3 V, suggesting the enhanced catalytic process, confirming the favourable electrocatalytic kinetics.44 Further, the traditional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the HzOR process were compared, and a big gap was noted of 2.632 V at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. S24†) between them, suggesting the tremendous advantage of HzOR for energy saving over the traditional OER. In order to evaluate the superiority of RuP2@InC-MS towards HzOR, the electrocatalytic performance of control samples, including commercial Pt/C (20 wt%), RuO2 powder and RuP2 prepared via the direct thermal treatment of a mixture of RuCl3 and red P, were conducted (Fig. S25†). For improving the dispersibility and conductivity, the RuP2 was physically ground with super carbon with a mass ratio of 1:1 to form RuP2 + C.45 As shown in Fig. 3a, the current densities of RuP2@InC-MS surpassed that of RuP2+C over the whole investigated potential region, demonstrating the contribution of the strong chemical coupling for HzOR.46 Ideally, our RuP2@InC-MS was surprisingly comparable with the benchmark Pt/C, even outperforming it in the weak polarization region. In detail, to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the 12.3% photoelectric conversion efficiency,47 RuP2@InC-MS merely needed −48 mV of working potential, smaller than that of Pt/C (19.6 mV), RuP2 + C (368 mV), and RuO2 (501 mV). Besides, the corresponding Tafel slope (Fig. 3b) of RuP2@InC-MS was 83.0 mV dec−1, smaller than that of RuP2 + C (204.5 mV dec−1) and RuO2 (330.8 mV dec−1), along with having a reduced semicircle (Fig. S26†), suggesting the favourable kinetics at the RuP2@InC-MS/electrolyte interface. The Tafel slope and EIS semicircle of Pt/C were slightly smaller than those of RuP2@InC-MS, which may explain its leading activity when the potential reached about 0.2 V. To inspect the specific activity, the apparent current densities of all the comparison samples were normalized with the electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs, Fig. S27†) via dividing the corresponding Cdl values by the average specific capacitance (Cs, 0.04 mF cm−2).48,49 Fig. S28† shows that the LSV curve rose sharply, implying the superior specific activity of RuP2@InC-MS. The RuP2@InC-MS also presented good electrochemical behaviour with a small working potential of −36 mV (Fig. S29†) to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH/0.3 M N2H4, much closer and even comparable to the recently reported values.23,50,51 Interestingly, RuP2@InC-MS further demonstrated a better catalyic capability towards N2H4 in simulated wastewater containing Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions (Fig. S30†),52 providing a broad avenue for hydrazine degradation in sewage via an environmentally friendly and economical protocol.

The scan rate was 5 mV s−1. 
On the other hand, durability is critical for practical applications, and so was also evaluated. First, the accelerated decay test (ADT) results showed nearly overlapping LSV curves during 5k cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles (Fig. S31a†). Numerically, the working potential at 150 mA cm−2 only increased by 2% (from 582 mV to 596 mV, inset in Fig. S31a†). The approaching semicircles in the Nyquist plots (Fig. S31b†) indicated the well-maintained electrode/electrolyte interfaces, contributing to its CV stability. Moreover, the outstanding current retention rates of 90.7% (Fig. 3c) and 84.6% (Fig. S32†) of the initial current density of almost 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, during the ever-lasting electrolysis of 15 h demonstrated the excellent long-term stability. It could thus be concluded that the RuP2@InC-MS exhibited extraordinary HzOR catalytic performance under neutral conditions, which has been rarely reported. Further, the post-catalytic sample was also characterized to gain a deeper insight into the possible structural evolution. First, the particle-interconnected microsheet morphology and the crystal structure of RuP2@InC-MS were well reserved after the catalytic reaction (Fig. S33a†). Importantly, the unique feature of a nonconseutive carbon coating could also be perfectly inheritated, as evidenced by the clear lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.38 nm (left inset in Fig. 3c), corresponding to the (110) plane of RuP2, the elemental mapping results (Fig. S33b†), and the XPS analysis (Fig. S33c and d† and inset in Fig. 3c). These complementary tests implied that RuP2@InC-MS could almost maintain its structural rigidity, further explaining the robust electrochemical activity and stability during the hydrazine oxidation catalytic process in neutral solution.
Investigation of the electrocatalytic HER performance
The catalytic behaviour of RuP2@InC-MS for the hydrogen evolution reaction was then investigated in 1.0 M PBS, whereby the sample screening process was identical to that used for HzOR (Fig. S34 and S35†). The comparison of the LSV curves (Fig. 3d) indicated that RuP2@InC-MS presented enhanced catalytic activity with a lower overpotential of 83 mV compared to that of RuP2 (158 mV) to achieve 10 mA cm−2, which was 33 mV higher compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C (50 mV). Uniquely, the smaller Tafel slope of RuP2@InC-MS (63.7 mV dec−1) than that of RuP2 + C (82.7 mV dec−1) and Pt/C (69.0 mV dec−1) suggests its profitable kinetics in neutral media (Fig. 3e), thus making the current density of RuP2@InC-MS surpass that of Pt/C at a high overpotential over 150 mV. The smaller semicircle (Fig. S36†) of the microsheet than those of both RuP2 + C and Pt/C from the EIS analysis revealed its superior interfacial transfer kinetics, supporting the necessity of coupling RuP2 with C in a delicate way. When normalizing the geometric current densities with the ECSA (Fig. S37a†), both RuP2@InC-MS and RuP2 + C expressed better behaviours than Pt/C, hinting at the advantageous HER ability of Ru-based materials.53,54 Concretely, to reach 0.1 mA cm−2, Pt/C needed a big overpotential of 177.3 mV, while the value for RuP2 + C (86.7 mV) was almost 50% of Pt/C, and that was further reduced to 58.6 mV for RuP2@InC-MS (Fig. S37b†), suggesting the splendid specific activity of the microsheet. Moreover, the RuP2@InC-MS also displayed good activity in alkaline solution (46 mV@10 mA cm−2, Fig. S38†) compared with some recently reported materials.55,56 Besides, 5k CV cycles were performed to research the decay of this material, whereby a negligible shift in the LSV curves (Fig. S39a†) as well as a slight increase in the Tafel slope values (inset in Fig. S39a†) and the semicircle in the Nyquist plots (Fig. S39b†) were observed, suggesting the good kinetics stability at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Meantime, the current density remained at the high rate of the initial 91.6% (the beginning current density was almost 10 mA cm−2, Fig. 3f) after 15 hour electrolysis, thus favouring its practical durability. Similarly, the characterizations on the sample after the HER stability tests (Fig. S40†) well demonstrated the retention of the morphology, crystal structure, composition, and microstructure, suggesting the good mechanical stability. Importantly, RuP2@InC-MS possessed a 100% Faradaic efficiency (Fig. S41†) during the whole electrolysis period of 1 h, suggesting its high efficiency for evolving hydrogen gas.
Evaluation of the bifunctional activities for hybrid water electrolysis
In order to evaluate the practicability, a home-made two-electrode hybrid water electrolysis system was built using RuP2@InC-MS as both cathode and anode catalysts to study hydrazine oxidation-assisted hydrogen evolution. First, the quantitative comparation (Fig. S42†) of the RuP2@InC-MS‖RuP2@InC-MS couples (366 mV@10 mA cm−2) with these benchmarking catalysts (Pt/C‖Pt/C couples and Pt/C‖RuO2 couples) established the superior bifunctionality of this hydrid with a Pt-like OHzS activity. Fig. 4a and b suggest that the RuP2@InC-MS can catalyze the hydrazine oxidation and hydrogen evolution simultaneously, and a low cell voltage of 366 mV was required to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2, much smaller than for traditional water splitting (Fig. S43,† the potential gap of overall hydrazine splitting and overall water splitting at 2 mA cm−2 was 2.190 V), suggesting its energy-saving superiority of the OHzS system. Besides, the catalytic stability in the two-electrode system was outstanding, as evidenced by the slight voltage increase of about 20 mV after 5k cycles (389 mV@10 mA cm−2 and 522 mV@20 mA cm−2). Furthermore, the current density kept almost constant after 15 h electrocatalysis in this system, as supported in Fig. 4c. The impressed stability in the neutral environment increases the prospect for practical application. As is well known, green H2 generation not only depends on the use of highly efficient electrocatalysts but also the utilization of renewable electricity. Thus, the solar-to-H2 conversion system has been constructed via commercial solar cells (OCV is 2.0 V) as the power to drive the OHzS system (namely PV-driven-EC, Fig. 4d) under natural illumination. As shown in the optical photo (Fig. 4e), the integrated system worked efficiently and the multimeter displayed a decent current of 146 mA. Visibly, lots of gas bubbles were generated on the surfaces of both the cathode and anode in the OHzS cell (Fig. 4f and Movie S1†), suggesting the feasibility for solar-to-H2 conversion with the OHzS system.

Comparison of the LSV curves (a) and voltages at 10 and 20 mA cm−2 (b); the I-t curve at the applied voltage of 0.415 V without IR correction (c); schematic diagram (d) and optical photograph (e) of the solar-to-H2 system; (f) macrophoto of the electrodes in the OHzS cell. 
Furthermore, the electrochemical performances of RuP2@InC-MS synthesized with other P sources towards HzOR, HER, and OHzS in 1.0 M PBS were further tested to indicate the generalized effect of the unique nonconsecutive carbon coating towards the bifunctional catalytic activity. As demonstrated in Fig. S44,† both RuP2@InC-MS samples displayed good activities for hydrazine oxidation and hydrogen evolution. When used in the two-electrode system for OHzS (Fig. S45†), they manifested a promising electrocatalysis behaviour with close voltages (381 mV for AuP-derived RuP2@InC-MS and 356 mV for AP-derived RuP2@InC-MS) to reach 10 mA cm−2. It could thus be concluded that the bifunctional RuP2@InC-MS for HzOR and HER in neutral conditions could be synthesized by the developed one-pot thermolysis route with good environmental-friendliness and cost-effectiveness features.
Discussion of the enhanced bifunctional performance
To understand the underlying relationships between the bifunctional activity and the RuP2-based microsheet structure, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed for HER and HzOR processes, respectively. First, the Ru-terminated RuP2 (110) surface (Fig. S46†) coupled with a graphene layer with one P atom substitute one carbon atom was found to be energetically stable (Fig. 5a). As a critical descriptor for HER catalytic activity, the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) could reflect the materials' intrinsic activity, and the value of zero is ideal and best in predicting activity.57 As shown in Fig. 5b, H adsorbed on the Ru site (−0.43 eV) of the RuP2 (110) planes (Fig. S47a†) was too strong and thus unfavourable for the subsequent desorption of hydrogen. Similarly, the Ru site (Fig. S47b†) in the RuP2@InC-MS was also too strong (−0.48 eV) for the H adsorption, thus making it tough to remove the adsorbed hydrogen. While the ΔGH* value (0.16 eV) of *H on the C site in the RuP2@InC-MS (Fig. S47c†) was closer to a thermoneutral level, which means the C atom in the hybrid holds the optimal H adsorption/desorption ability, and thus is responsible for the boosted HER activity.58,59 Besides, the dominantly restricted charge redistribution on the heterointerface and the charge transfer from RuP2 to the carbon via the charge density difference analysis (Fig. 5c) may potentially contribute to the improved catalytic activity of RuP2@InC-MS for HER.60,61

The cyan and yellow represent charge depletion and accumulation with an isosurface value of 0.005 eÅ−3. The arrow represents the direction of electron transfer and the values are the amount of Bader charge transferred. 
The DFT simulations were further performed to unearth the innermost secrets of the enhanced HzOR performance of RuP2@InC-MS. Considering that the C site in the hybrid mirocheet is active for the HER process, the adsorption ability of N2H4 molecule on this site was first explored, and the bond distance of the N atom in the reactant with the nearest neighbouring C atom was 3.86 Å, which could obviously decrease to 2.23 Å (Fig. S48†) when the N atom was adsorbed on the Ru atom, suggesting the shift of the active centre in the RuP2@InC-MS, and that Ru rather than C is active for the HzOR process. Moreover, the previous study indicated that the N2H4 molecule in the gas phase has three major conformations: gauche, anti, and cis.62 Therefore, the different adsorption conformations of N2H4 on the surface of Ru site were considered here, and the anti-conformer was shown to be more stable with the lowest Eads of −0.88 eV, and this was thus chosen for the combinatorial and systematic investigations (Fig. S49†). Next, the stepwise dehydrogenation processes of N2H4 and its intermediates (*N2H4, *N2H3, *N2H2, *N2H, and *N2) involved in the six-step reaction for both RuP2@InC-MS and RuP2 are presented in Fig. 5d and e, respectively. The first adsorption process was exothermic on the (110) surfaces of both RuP2@InC-MS (−0.40 eV) and RuP2 (−0.28 eV). In the whole reaction cycle, both the rate-determining steps (RDS) of RuP2@InC-MS (Fig. 5d) and RuP2 (Fig. 5e) were the dehydrogenation of *N2H4 to *N2H3, while the former energy barrier was 0.68 eV, which was 0.17 eV smaller than that of the latter (0.85 eV), resulting in the improved dehydrogenation kinetics of RuP2@InC-MS. Moreover, the charge density difference diagram (Fig. 5f and S50†) showed the electron drifts between the surface and the absorbed intermediates, where *N2H3, *N2H2, *N2H, and *N2 acted as charge acceptors while *N2H4 acted as a charge donor on both surfaces. Obviously, after coupling carbon with RuP2, besides the mildly changed amount of Bader charge transferred for the four intermediates, the total Bader charge transferred for *N2H2 adsorbed on the RuP2@InC-MS surface was 0.02|e|, which was bigger than that on the RuP2 surface, suggesting that the RuP2@InC-MS can strengthen the interaction between *N2H2 and the surface, consistent with the reduced free energy when *N2H3 was dehydrogenated to form *N2H2 (Inset in Fig. 5d and e).21
Briefly, the C sites in RuP2@InC-MS are more thermoneutral for H adsorption/desorption during HER catalytic process, while the exposed Ru sites in the nonconsecutive carbon-coated microsheet can reduce the dehydrogenation energy barrier from *N2H3 to *N2H2, along with the charge redistribution on the heterostructure interface and the charge density regulation, which endows dual active site exposure in the RuP2@InC-MS to achieve the superior bifunctional catalytic application. It should be noted that the unique nonconsective carbon coating on the RuP2 microsheet was beneficial to improving the HzOR and HER activity. For example, the resultant RuP2 mircosheet (RuP2 MS) with a negligible carbon coating exhibited a poor bifunctional activity (Fig. S51†). Further, the obtained RuP2 nanoparticles-decorated carbon microsheet (RuP2@C-MS) also possessed unsatisfied activity for both HzOR and HER (Fig. S52†). These comparisons hint that the unique character of the nonconsective carbon coating on the RuP2 nanoparticles-assembled microsheet was greatly helpful for realizing the excellent capacity. Besides, the chemical coupling between the carbon and the nanoparticle in the hybrid could not only improve the structural stability and the electronic conductivity, but also tune the local charge transfer and motivate the active ingredients, synergistically realizing the boosted bifunctional performance. Moreover, the porous microsheet could expose more active sites, promote the penetration of the electrolyte, further improve the activity and stability collaboratively.
Conclusions
In summary, we present a generalized and eco-friendly strategy to achieve the highly efficient synthesis of RuP2 porous microsheets composed of interconnected nanoparticles with nonconsecutive carbon coating (denoted as RuP2@InC-MS) using various cheap organic/inorganic P sources, including GP, AuP, and AP. An exemplary RuP2@InC-MS with GP as the P source exhibited Pt-comparable activity for HER with a low overpotential of 83 mV, and superior-Pt HzOR catalytic activity with an ultralow working potential of −48 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2. Impressively, an ultrasmall applied voltage of 366 mV in a two-electrode hybrid water electrolysis system could be achieved to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The DFT calculations revealed that the dual active sites in the hybrid may explain the satisfactory bifunctionality, where the C sites with the near-zero ΔGH* value (0.13 eV) can balance the adsorption/desorption behaviour of hydrogen, hence accelerating the HER kinetics, and the Ru atoms could effectively reduce the energy barrier from 0.85 eV (RuP2) to 0.68 eV (RuP2@InC-MS) in the dehydrogenation process of N2H4 molecules during the HzOR catalytic process. In order to demonstrate the possibility of integrating H2 generation with sustainable energy resources, specifically solar-to-H2 conversion, a proof-of-concept system by driving the home-made two-electrode hybrid electrolysis device with commercial solar cells was built, where a decent current and abundant H2 gas generation could be observed. Our work provides an advanced materials design strategy to fulfil the bifunctionality in electrocatalytic applications, which can broaden the avenue for energy-saving H2 generation in neutral conditions, and advance the practical applications of solar-to-H2 conversion.
