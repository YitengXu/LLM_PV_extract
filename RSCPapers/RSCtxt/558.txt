    , Accepted 27th July 2017First published on 27th July 2017AbstractTriple cation based perovskite solar cells offer enhanced moisture tolerance and stability compared to mixed perovskites. Slight substitution of methyl ammonium or formamidinium cation by cesium (Cs+), was also reported to eliminate halide segregation due to its smaller size. To elucidate the device kinetics and understand the role of the Cs, we undertook different modes of scanning probe microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments. Kelvin probe force microscopy revealed that the incorporation of the Cs cation increases the contact potential difference (CPD), this CPD further increases when Spiro-OMeTAD is used as a hole transport material. The current at the nanoscale level shows improvement with Cs inclusion and further enhancement by the Spiro-OMeTAD deposition, studied under light illumination, which supports the high photocurrent density obtained from the cells. EIS demonstrates that in a triple cation environment, reduced carrier recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface was also obtained which in turn allow us to achieve a higher Voc value.
Introduction
In recent years, perovskite solar cells have emerged as a disruptive technology, if successful, then they can be deployed on a wide scale. Owing to their notable opto-electrical properties, such as tunable direct band-gap, broad light-absorption, charge separation and transport capability along with an easy and inexpensive fabrication processes, perovskites are competitive candidates as light absorber materials for photovoltaic applications.1,2 Concerted efforts have been made in their development, which has led to a spectacular rise in device power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8 to 22.1%.3 This progress has been achieved using two fundamental aspects; materials engineering4 and optimization of perovskite deposition techniques.5 Perovskite materials, as such is composed of an inorganic part (generally a metal halide) and an organic part. The material properties can be tuned, simply by following the Goldschmidt6 rule in order to alter the electrical properties and thereby the final performance of the devices. The methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) based perovskite solar cell is the most investigated configuration, however it has been now established that the mixture of organic cations and anions enhances not only its photovoltaic properties but also results in improved stability.7 Grätzel et al. reported a remarkable 20% PCE using perovskite with a formula of ((FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13).8 The use of the mixed organic cations thermally stabilize the perovskite, apart from extending the absorption spectrum,9 the inclusion of bromine though increases the band gap but significantly improves the humidity tolerance of the devices.
Adequate preparation methods need to be established, in order to achieve precise control of physical parameters such as crystallinity and morphology, which are required to fabricate efficient and defect free stable solar cells. Approaches such as solvent engineering,5 vacuum10 or gas drying11 were reported in order to achieve homogeneous films and large size perovskite crystals. These approaches control the nucleation of perovskites in the precursor solutions, and decrease crystal growth rate, thus allowing formation of large crystals.
However, the ambient condition stability of perovskite remains a key point with regard to future scale-up and industrial commercialization.12 Different strategies have been applied in order to address this problem, such as fluorinated compounds in the matrix of perovskites,13 the use of hydrophobic polymers,14 or the inclusion of cesium in the perovskite stoichiometry.8,15,16 The latter resulted in an outstanding improvement of the device stability over 1000 h. Substitution of the mixed organic cation by a small amount of Cs, eliminates halide segregation.17 Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of the process that entails the inclusion of such elements inside the perovskite structure. In this work, we report our findings on perovskite based solar cells with the addition of cesium in varying weight percentages (0–15%). Samples have been prepared following one-step deposition process combined with solvent engineering techniques with different precursor concentration as well as different thicknesses of hole transport material (HTM). An array of techniques together with different modes of scanning probe microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to untangle the properties and improvements after the addition of cesium.
Scanning force microscopy (SFM) and its electrical operative mode, such as Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), is being employed here to investigate the homogeneities of the electrical properties of the fabricated solar cells at the nanoscale level.
Using KPFM, concurrent mapping of the topography and the value of the contact potential difference (CPD) between the tip and the sample at nanometer scale can be logged in real-time. In the past, we have also used KPFM to study the potential distribution across the interfaces of a working solar cell. We have found that the open circuit potential (Voc) is built up at the interface of the MAPbI3 layer to the gold (Au) electrode and when probed atop of the p-type (HTM) layer, the Voc at nanometer scale was in accordance with the bulk measurements.18 These findings are in contradiction to device models that regard the internal electric field as the main driving force for the spatial separation of charges.19,20
Here we probed a triple cation based solar cell with SFM measurements on different working layers. The full device was also subjected to investigation. The mapping of CPD atop the layers in a state of the art device was performed. Upon illumination and under short-circuit conditions, the sample exhibited an accumulation of charges (higher CPD) at grain boundaries in the case of the perovskite layer. The potential distribution across the surface before and after illumination was studied and correlated with separate layers. Conducting force microscopy (CFM) mode was also used to study the trend of dark- and photo-current alteration with Cs incorporation at the nanoscale level. To elucidate the internal carrier dynamics occurring inside a device, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also used, whereas the analysis of EIS data is subject to fitting into complex models that neglect key elements such as interlayer interface and molecular phenomena occurring due to the interaction between the layers. These local energetic landscapes (Scheme 1) in a working nanostructured device (thickness ≤ 1 μm) will allow developing a methodology for correlation of figures of merit with bulk properties. Moreover a correlation of the knowledge of the charge distribution through direct visualization of the surface and internal dynamics will facilitate better understanding.

Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the cross-sectional image of a typical perovskite solar cell. The micrograph shows that all the layers are well interconnected and have well defined interfaces. From the bottom to the top of these images, layers due to FTO (400 nm), compact TiO2 (ca. 50–60 nm), meso-porous TiO2 (ca. 100 or 200 nm) and perovskite (ca. 400 nm) of Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 are clearly distinguished. Atop the perovskite layer, the 200 nm thick Spiro-OMeTAD (HTM) and the gold as cathode layer (ca. 80 nm) are observed. It is to be noted that here, the thickness of the perovskite layer is relatively higher due to the 1.4 M concentration being used and the relatively thick HTM layer is due to the use of 90 mM of Spiro-OMeTAD.

Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and their corresponding integrated current densities as a function of wavelength plots are shown for the fabricated solar cells with the (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (control device), and with 5, 10, and 15% Cs+ based perovskites (Fig. 2). Hereafter, the mixed methylammonium formamidinium, i.e. (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 is abbreviated as perovskite. We then varied the thickness of perovskite by using 1.4 M concentration and it was observed that IPCE values were improved w.r.t to 1.2 M perovskite. To find a synergy between charge extraction and the higher thickness of perovskites and hole transport layer (HTL), we then used 90 mM of Spiro-OMeTAD, together with 1.4 M of perovskite (with 5% Cs+ content) concentration, and the resulting solar cell delivers the best performance studied here. Table 1 provides the solar cell parameters of cells with different compositions. The best device was composed of (with 5% Cs+): Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, and the concentration of the perovskite used was 1.4 M, and the Spiro-OMeTAD concentration was fixed to 90 mM. The cell parameters are: open circuit voltage (Voc): 1060 mV, short circuit current density (JSC: 21.92 mA cm−2), fill factor (FF): 75.06%, and PCE: 17.53%. J–V characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Electrical mode of scanning probe microscopy
To elucidate the role of Cs+ inclusion, and of Spiro-OMeTAD, CFM and KPFM studies were performed. Fig. 3 shows simultaneous topographic and current images for the (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 + Spiro-OMeTAD (90 mM concentration) samples and their respective section profiles are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1). Perovskite concentration was fixed to 1.4 M. The topography of the control sample, in the dark is shown in Fig. 3a, and it shows large particles, which are shapeless and a few hundred nanometers in size. In the corresponding current image (Fig. 3a′), the bright regions arise due to high currents and the dark regions correspond to lower current regions of the sample. The average value of current flowing across the film was in the range of 50–60 pA whereas a maximum current flow value of 130 pA was observed. The topography of the same sample under light irradiance is represented in Fig. 3b, and the corresponding current image (Fig. 3b′), shows an average current flow of 250 pA with a maximum current flow of 500 pA. A number of high current domains (bright regions) were observed more on illumination compared to the dark and the photocurrent magnitude was found to be larger than the dark current, thus providing evidence for charge separation under illumination. Fig. 3c and c′ illustrates the topography and current images of Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, in the dark. The value of the current lies in the range of 50 to 160 pA, with a maximum current flow of 230 pA. The value of the current flowing through the sample made from the triple cation in dark was higher compared to the control sample.
 Fig. 3  Simultaneous topography: (a, c and e) in the dark, (b, d and f) under green light, and current: (a′, c′ and e′) in the dark, (b′, d′ and f′) under green light-maps of (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 and Spiro-OMeTAD (90 mM) coated Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (all at 1.4 M perovskite concentrations). 
For the triple cation perovskite, topography and current images under illumination are shown in Fig. 3d and d′, and the photocurrent varies between 150 to 400 pA, with a maximum current of 1.2 nA. Upon inclusion of 5% Cs+ in the perovskite, the photocurrent improves, indicating that Cs+ addition enhances both the average and the maximum current. However, in the case of both mixed and triple cation perovskites, under dark and light conditions, the high current regions are localized, randomly distributed and well-separated. The samples with Spiro-OMeTAD deposited atop of triple cation perovskites, produce significantly different current and topography maps. The maps of the Cs+ doped and the Spiro-OMeTAD coated control sample Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 + Spiro-OMeTAD (Cs-FAMA-Spiro) are shown in Fig. 3e and e′. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the line tracings of these scans. On Spiro-OMeTAD deposition, a smoother surface relative to the other two samples was found. The maximum and the minimum in height profiles are the lower for this sample. The corresponding current flow is observed to be in the range of 40 to 160 pA, with a maximum current of 290 pA, which is higher than that observed for the other two perovskites under dark conditions. The corresponding topography and current images under irradiance are displayed in Fig. 3f and f′. The current flow shows a maximum value of 3 nA, which is the highest among all the above-stated samples. The grain sizes of perovskites vary from tens of nanometers to ∼100 nm (Fig. 3f′). A similar photocurrent effect was observed when TiO2 was doped.21 The grain sizes at the Spiro-OMeTAD coated surface are much smaller, compared to the only perovskite based surfaces, which aligns with the smoother surface of the hole transport layer (HTL), originating due to its small molecule nature, which covers the perovskite crystals. Notably, both under the dark and illuminated states, the high current domains are more uniformly distributed over micron length scales when Spiro-OMeTAD is coated, compared to the pristine surfaces without the HTL. It can also be deduced that on light irradiance, perovskites scavenge the holes more efficiently in the case of triple cation based samples, which is supported by a higher surface photocurrent relative to the perovskites without HTLs. Current distribution across the perovskite surface was also found to be favorably impacted by the HTL deposition, as the HTL forms excellent interfacial contact with the triple perovskite under-layer.
In a previous report, Kutes et al.,22 studied the photocurrent response of MAPbI3 thin films in the dark and under 0.07 mW cm−2 white light (LED) illumination. The authors observed that the distribution of dark ISC was homogeneous and the current showed values below 6 pA with a mean of 0.06 pA. Under illumination, the current showed a heterogeneous distribution and was found to lie in the range of 41.8 to 100 pA. ISC increased by approximately 10 times on going from dark to light illumination. MacDonald et al.,23 used photoconductive atomic force microscopy to investigate the electrical properties and electrical property heterogeneity at grain boundaries of a FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3 assembly under darkness and under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 with a 523 nm LED. The current in the dark and under light was found to be 200 and 300 pA respectively with an increase of 1.5 times on going from darkness to light. In this work, currents under darkness and light (using a green LED of 1.5 mW cm−2 intensity illumination) were measured for all the three thin films. The light intensity was measured with an ILT 1400 radiometer–photometer. The photocurrent increased for all the samples, perovskites, 5% Cs+-perovskites and Spiro-OMeTAD (90 mM) coated 5% Cs+-perovskites (at 1.4 M perovskite concentrations). The maximum current increases approximately 4, 5 and 10 times respectively on changing the conditions from darkness to light. These values are very much comparable to the reported magnitudes of current enhancement upon illumination in perovskite films.
The topography and the surface potential images of the perovskites under darkness and light are shown in Fig. 4. For the perovskite (mixed), in the dark (Fig. 4a and a′), the contact potential difference (CPD) is 50 mV. The respective topography and surface potential maps in the presence of light are shown in Fig. 4b and b′. The CPD was increased to 170 mV (Fig. 3e and e′). Fig. S2 (ESI†) displays the line tracings of these scans. Topographical comparison shows that the mixed perovskite grains have distinct shapes under dark conditions, but they appear to be incoherent under illumination. The area (grains) which showed a bright contrast in topography possesses high CPDs in the corresponding surface potential image. However, on light illumination, over the whole scan area, high CPDs were observed. The high surface potential domains (contrary to current distribution) are more evenly distributed across the perovskite surface and are not necessarily influenced by the height variations. From the dark to the illuminated state, the increase in CPD indicates that the photo-generated carriers are more effectively separated under light. The topography and the surface potential images of the triple cation perovskite in darkness and light are shown in Fig. 4c, c′ and d, d′. The CPD is 60 mV (in the dark) whereas it achieved a value of 190 mV (under light). Cs+ doping increases the overall photovoltage, but here, under dark and light conditions, the grains with a dark contrast (in topography) are characterized by lower CPDs in the corresponding surface potential map and the grains with a bright contrast (in topography) are characterized by higher CPDs. Photovoltage augmentation is induced by Cs+ incorporation, which leads to a higher open circuit voltage for the triple cation perovskite compared to the pristine mixed perovskite solar cells. In a recent study on mixed and triple cation Cs–Rb-perovskites, CPDs increases upon Cs doping.24 The triple cation with Spiro-OMeTAD deposited layer topography and potential maps are presented in Fig. 4e, e′ and f, f′ (under dark and light conditions). The CPDs are 65 and 220 mV under darkness and light respectively. Both under dark and light conditions, the surface potential images, especially under light, show very few “ultra-dark” domains. Over a lateral span of 2 μm, the bright regions which are attributed to higher CPDs are contiguous and evenly distributed, thus ratifying the role of Spiro-OMeTAD in efficiently collecting holes from the perovskite, and improving it's CPD, and boosting the open circuit voltage, thus improving it's PCE.

The CPDs are also be used for determining the work functions of the samples. The work functions are approximated to the fermi energy levels (EF). The average values of the surface potentials in the dark for the samples: perovskites, 5% Cs+-perovskites, and 5% Cs+-perovskites with Spiro-OMeTAD are 50, 60 and 65 mV respectively. The following equation is used for the estimation of EF.EF(Sample) = ϕ(Sample) = 4.6 + VCPD(HOPG) − VCPD(Sample)
The tip used was calibrated with a sample of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), which is taken as a reference, prior to the measurements on the perovskite films. The topography and surface potential images for HOPG are shown in Fig. S3a and b (ESI†). Fig. S3a (ESI†) shows the HOPG topography, wherein the aligned graphitic layers are clearly visible. Fig S3b (ESI†) shows the surface potential map of HOPG and the average surface potential is deduced to be 500 mV.
From the above equation, the magnitudes of EF for perovskites, 5% Cs+-perovskites, and 5% Cs+-perovskites with Spiro-OMeTAD electrodes are 5.305, 5.30 and 5.29 eV respectively. The Fermi levels are depicted through an energy band diagram in Fig. 5. The conduction and valence band positions for the perovskite with and without 5% Cs+, are taken from our previous study.17 As CPD decreases, the EF shifts deeper. In the presence of the only Cs+, the EF shifts to lower values and this is because of the strong p-doping nature of the cesium salt. Further addition of Spiro-OMeTAD, upshifts the EF, because of p-type behaviour and the hole transport layer. The energy gradient between the Fermi level of 5% Cs+-perovskites and the work function of Spiro-OMeTAD is lower than the gradient between the EF of perovskites and the work function of Spiro-OMeTAD. A lower gradient facilitates hole transfer to this layer.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
The fact that the organic constituent of perovskite (MA/FA) will not influence the electronic properties of perovskite solar cells will be of less significance, if we compare the metal cation with the halide anion. Nevertheless, some studies suggest the importance of the organic part and its bearing on opto-electrical properties and stability. Specifically, recent research has pointed out the possibility of ion migration (I−, MA+, or less probable Pb2+) to contact barriers can be one of the plausible reasons for the hysteresis behavior reported in perovskite solar cells.25,26 However with the formation of larger perovskite crystals, hysteresis behavior diminishes.
The use of mixed organic cation perovskite (MA/FA) reduces the migration of MA+, as FA stabilizes the crystal structure due to its relatively larger size (radii MA+ = 0.270 nm, FA+ = 0.279 nm)27 and the formation of hydrogen bonds with Pb octahedra. In the case of Cs+ (radii Cs+ = 0.118 nm),28 though arguable, the cation has high movement, however it has been shown that the presence of strong electrostatic attractive interactions between Cs+, I− and Br− contribute to stabilizing the lattice.17 In order to unravel the charge dynamics in these cesium perovskite based solar cells, EIS experiments were carried out. It can be observed that the resistance to recombination (Rrec), obtained from fitting the impedance response shows a decrease in value with the addition of Cs. (Fig. 6a) The inclusion of 10% or 15% Cs in the perovskite stoichiometry shows an almost similar profile regardless of the open circuit voltage. In contrast to this, no significant changes were observed for devices with and without 5% Cs. At a higher voltage, (close to Voc), all the devices represented similar values of Rrec. For higher Cs inclusion, lower values of electron recombination resistance were found.
 Fig. 6  Different electrical parameters derived from EIS studies using a concentration of 1.2 M perovskite solution. 
At a lower voltage, the slope for the recombination resistance is more pronounced which diminishes at a voltage close to Voc of the devices. From this, we assume that the recombination process is mediated via a trap-limited mechanism in the bulk of the perovskite, and at a short circuit condition close to 1 Sun; the device resistance decreases significantly.29 A similar behavior was also obtained when 1.4 M precursor solution was used (Fig. 7). By and large the value of capacitance remains unchanged, when measured across the voltage range.30 (Fig. 6b) This capacitance behavior is attributed to the dependence by its geometrical component. The capacitance–frequency response (Fig. S4, ESI†) measured under the range of (0.1–106 Hz), shows the presence of a narrow plateau appearing at medium frequencies (105–104 Hz). All the samples with cesium inclusion show a different profile, with the appearance of a sharp slope at a lower frequency range (0.1–103 Hz). This suggests that the electron–hole pair generation profile is altered with the presence of Cs.
 Fig. 7  Recombination resistance value for 1.4 M perovskite solution based devices. 
Lower electron lifetime values were obtained from the Cs+ based devices (Fig. 6c). Cs+ inclusion gives lower electron life times, and the results are consistent with the percentage of Cs+ in the perovskite stoichiometry. At a voltage close to the open circuit voltage, similar lifetimes are observed for all the devices, except that a slightly better electron lifetime was obtained by 5% Cs+ inclusion, which is in accordance with the photovoltaic performances. The interface between perovskite and charge selective contacts represents the main recombination pathway in perovskite solar cells.31 Nevertheless, the interaction between the perovskite and TiO2 selective contact could affect the performance of the devices.
In other words, if we analyze the behavior of the devices at low frequencies, we can correlate it to the charge accumulation at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. Some authors suggested32 that this charge accumulation together with the ionic motion, possibly explain the hysteresis behavior in the perovskite solar cell.
This charge accumulation of electrons at the TiO2 interface, follows a (2kBT)−1 slope when it is represented in the semi-logarithmic plot of capacitance at low frequencies versus voltage. The charge accumulation/ion motion is reduced with the inclusion of cesium cations (Fig. 8). This is in accordance with our previous results, where it was explained that the inclusion of cesium stabilized the crystal structure and helps the charge extraction as well as thermal stability.17

According to previous reports, the stability of perovskite solar cells is attributed to three main factors: moisture, heat, and UV light, with moisture being the most critical factor.33 However, a combination of these factors accelerate fast degradation in perovskite devices. Additionally, intrinsic instability also affects device degradation due to charge accumulation as mentioned above. To address this issue, UV+ and humidity degradation tests were performed in order to study structure degradation in cesium based perovskite films. After degrading for different periods of time, X-ray diffractograms were recorded. Results (Fig. S5, ESI†) showed that after 60 min UV exposure time, the ratio of the PbI2 (12.6°) and perovskite (14.1°) peaks increased, which is a clear indication that degradation is taking place in the film, whereas the sample with cesium content (15%) remains unaltered. This suggests that the incorporation of an inorganic cation (Cs+) improve the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells.

Transparent conducting coated glasses (TEC15, 15 Ω sq−1) were used as substrates. They were cleaned by ultrasonication in a 2% Hellmanex water solution for 30 minutes followed by rinsing with deionized water and ethanol. Then, a ∼40 nm TiO2 compact layer was deposited on a FTO substrate via spray pyrolysis at 450 °C from a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis-(acetylacetonate) in anhydrous ethanol. After the spraying, the substrates were left at 450 °C for 45 minutes and allowed to cool to room temperature. The mesoporous layer of TiO2 was deposited using spin coating (30 s at 4000 rpm). For this, a TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) was first diluted in ethanol (1:7), so that a 150–200 nm thick layer was achieved. Following this, the photoanodes were annealed at 450 °C for 30 min under dry air flow. This annealing process converts the rutile phase (amorphous) TiO2 layers into anatase and allows interconnection of particles. After cooling to 150 °C, these photoanodes were transferred to a glovebox for perovskite deposition. The perovskite films were deposited from a precursor solution containing FAI (1 M), PbI2 (1.2 M), MABr (0.2 M), and PbBr2 (0.2 M) in anhydrous DMF:DMSO 4:1 (v:v). The perovskite solution was spin coated in a two-step sequence at 1000 and 4000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively. During the second spinning step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was used as an antisolvent approach and was dripped on the substrate, 15 s prior to the end of the program (spinning). The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h in a glovebox. For the triple cation based perovskite, Csx(MA0.15FA0.85)100−xPb(I0.85Br0.15)3, cesium iodide (CsI) was separately dissolved (1.5 M stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)), and added to the perovskite precursor to achieve 5–15% composition.
After perovskite formation, Spiro-OMeTAD (70 mM in chlorobenzene) was spin coated (4000 rpm for 20 s) as the hole transport layer. For better performance, routine doping of Spiro-OMeTAD was carried out using lithium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide salt (Li-TFSI), tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)-tris(bis-(trifluoro-methylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, from Dynamo), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP). The molar ratio of additives for HTMs was: 0.5, 0.03, and 3.3 for Li-TFSI, FK209, and t-BP, respectively. The device fabrication was completed by the deposition of 70–80 nm of gold as cathode, this was thermally evaporated under low vacuum (10−5 × 10−6). All the solutions were prepared inside an argon-controlled glovebox.
Characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source-measurement-unit under AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm2 illumination from a certified Class AAA, 450 W solar simulator (ORIEL, 94023 A). Light output power was calibrated using a NREL certified calibrated mono-crystalline silicon solar cell. A black metal mask (0.16 cm2) was placed over the square shaped device (active area 0.5 cm2) to reduce the influence of scattered light. An optimized scan rate of 10 mV s−1 was used for the measurements so that accurate values for efficiencies can be calculated without having hysteresis. For IPCE measurements, a 150 W xenon lamp coupled to an Oriel Cornerstone 260 motorized frac1/4; m monochromator was used as the light source, whereas a 2936-R power meter was used to measure the short circuit current. Cross-sectional microscopy and normal topography images were taken with a Hitachi S5200 field-emission microscope operating at 5.0 keV.
Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements was carried out by means of a white LED over a wide range of DC light intensities. This allowed us to measure devices at different positions of the Fermi level. A response analyzer module (SP300, Bio-Logic Science Instrument) was utilized to analyze the frequency response of the devices. To avoid voltage drop due to series resistance, IS measurements were performed at the open circuit potential, the Fermi level being fixed by the DC illumination intensity. A 20 mV perturbation in the range 2 MHz–1 mHz was used to obtain the spectra. After measurement, data were fitted by Z-view software in order to extract the characteristic parameters of the cells.
Conductive force microscopy (C-FM), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements were performed on the electrodes using a Veeco, Multimode 8 with a Scan Asyst (Nanoscope 8.10 software) microscope. The conductive probes used in this study were made of antimony doped silicon (n-doped; resistivity ∼ 0.01–0.025 Ω cm) coated with platinum–iridium from Bruker (SCM-PIC-V2). The probe tip had a radius of 10 nm, with a spring constant of 0.1 N m−1. The sample was deposited on the FTO substrate and was affixed on a stainless steel disk with the help of conducting carbon tape. A thin strip of silver paste was glued for taking the contacts. All the images were recorded at room temperature under both dark and green light illumination. A green LED with an irradiance of 1.5 mW cm−2 was used.
For CFM measurements, a current sensitivity of 1 nA V−1 and a load force of 47.6 nN is maintained between the tip and the sample. The contact tip is scanned in contact with the sample surface. The z-feedback loop uses the dc cantilever defending a signal to maintain a constant force between the tip and the sample to generate topographic images. Concurrently, a dc bias of 500 mV is applied to the tip. The sample is held at ground potential. The built-in pre-amplified scanner head measured the current passing through the tip and sample and imaged the current profiles. For KPFM measurements, the distance (lift scan height) between the tip and the sample was maintained at 50 nm. Applied sample bias was 1 V in order to obtain decent images.
Conclusions
Conductive force microscopy studies show that the average current carrying ability of the mixed-perovskite is enhanced by 5% Cs+ substitution, both in the dark and under the irradiance state. The photocurrents were further improved, and have a more uniform delocalized distribution across the surface, when the perovskite samples are coated with Spiro-OMeTAD, confirming that the HTL/perovskite interface is most conducive for producing high photocurrents and therefore a high JSC ensues. KPFM analysis reveals that the CPDs increase with Cs+ doping and further with Spiro-OMeTAD layer deposition atop of the perovskites. The high open circuit voltage for the solar cells obtained by 5% Cs+ substitution17 is correlated to the uniformly distributed and interlinked high CPD domains, which spread over multiple length scales. Incorporation of Cs ions into mixed halide perovskites reduces the recombination resistance at a voltage close to open circuit, and it also increases the electron lifetime, both properties are beneficial for extending the device photovoltaic parameters.
