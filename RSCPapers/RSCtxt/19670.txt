    , Accepted 12th December 2019First published on 17th December 2019AbstractThe exploration of highly efficient and scalable potential electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essential in the field of sustainable energy systems. In this paper, we report the successful synthesis of CuCo2S4 ternary sheet arrays (CuCo2S4 TSAs) via a simple rational one-pot solvothermal procedure. The CuCo2S4 TSA was transformed from CuCo-dihydroxide and uniformly distributed on the microfibre of carbon felt, which effectively enhanced the charge transfer rate. Benefiting from the uniform freestanding sheet structure, the coordination effect of the metal species and the high-conductive carbon skeleton, the ternary composite exhibits excellent OER and HER activity, with the lowest overpotentials of 210 and 69 mV and Tafel slopes of 43.8 and 55.4 mV dec−1, respectively, outperforming the other ternary composites of FeS2/CoFe2O4 and CuS/CuFeS2, mono-metal sulfides and commercial RuO2 and Pt/C. Besides, the CuCo2S4 TSAs exhibit superior long-term stability relative to noble metal catalysts. Moreover, the excellent overall water-splitting performance was obtained by using CuCo2S4 TSA as a catalyst, providing an effective low-cost and large-scale synthetic strategy for high-efficiency binder-free catalysts in renewable energy conversion.
Introduction
The crisis of fossil fuel depletion and global environmental pollution have increased the need for the rapid development of renewable energy devices,1–8 especially fuel cells, in which oxygen and hydrogen play a key role in the battery operation. Among the gas generation methods, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are the most environmentally friendly methods.9–11 They can be operated via natural energy power generation, such as windmills or solar energy,12,13 and applied to a number of renewable energy technologies, especially water-splitting14–17 and rechargeable metal-air batteries.18–24 Commonly, such reactions require efficient electrocatalysts that possess high reaction rates and low overpotentials and maintain stability over time. However, the reaction kinetics are intrinsically sluggish due to the complex electron transfer process.25–27 RuO2/IrO2 and Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as efficient catalysts for the OER and HER,28,29 respectively, but their high-cost, scarcity and unsatisfactory operation stability seriously restrict their practical large-scale application.30–32 Thus, the development of cost-effective and earth-abundant catalysts as substitutes is important for the water-splitting industry.
Among the numerous materials, 3d transition metal-based materials are relatively abundant and low-cost, and attracted significant attention for enhancing the electrocatalytic activities towards the OER and HER.33–42 However, their poor electrical conductivity and slow ion transport rate severely restrict their further applications. Great efforts have been targeted toward resolving these issues. For example, Jin et al.43 designed a trimetallic NiFeCr layered double hydroxide electrocatalyst directly grown on conductive carbon paper, which effectively improved the OER kinetics according to the synergistic interactions among the metal centers. Strasser et al.,44 by combining experiments and theoretical analysis, tracked the atomic-scale structural evolution of well-defined CoOx(OH)y compounds in their catalytically active state during the OER reaction through operando and surface-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy combined with surface voltammetry, which revealed that near-surface oxidation played an organizing role in high OER activity. Suib et al.45 reported a facile template-less synthetic strategy for the synthesis of mesoporous FeS2 for HER application. The remarkable catalytic performance in alkaline media was attributed to the exposed (210) facets. According to the current research status, there is plenty of room for the investigation of cost-effective catalysts for the OER and HER in order to lower the voltage gap for the overall water splitting process.
Herein, we report a simple rational one-pot solvothermal procedure for the synthesis of CuCo2S4 TSA grown on the microfibre of carbon felt as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline media. Excellent OER and HER activities were obtained for CuCo2S4 TSA, which outperformed the other ternary composites of FeS2/CoFe2O4 and CuS/CuFeS2, the mono-metal sulfides and commercial RuO2 and Pt/C. The superior catalytic performance was ascribed to the uniform freestanding sheet structure, the coordination effect of the metal species and the highly conductive carbon skeleton. In addition, CuCo2S4 TSA exhibited superior long-term stability relative to noble metal catalysts. Moreover, as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, it showed efficient activity and stability, providing a promising avenue for high-efficiency binder-free catalysts in energy conversion.
Experimental section
Sample preparation
Carbon felt (CF) was pre-treated as follows. The CF (cut into 2 cm × 2 cm square) was refluxed in concentrated sulfuric acid for 12 h to remove impurities and modify the surface hydrophilicity, and was then washed several times in water and ethanol.
In a typical synthesis, 2 mmol of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 4 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 20 mL of water and isopropanol (1:1, v/v) mixed solution with continuous stirring for 30 min to obtain a uniform transparent solution. The solution and pretreated CF were transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 160 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the CF with CuCo-precursor was taken out of the autoclave, washed several times with deionized water/ethanol solution and then dried at 60 °C for 5 h. Subsequently, the CF with CuCo-precursor was placed in 0.4 mol L−1 of Na2S·9H2O solution and kept at 160 °C for 6 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. After cooling to room temperature, the products (CuCo2S4 TSA) were obtained by rinsing with deionized water and drying at 60 °C for 10 h. FeS2/CoFe2O4 and CuS/CuFeS2 were synthesized in a manner similar to that mentioned for CuCo2S4 nanomaterials, where FeNO3·9H2O was added during the synthesis of FeS2/CoFe2O4 and CuS/CuFeS2. The CuCo2S4 catalyst without carbon felt was obtained via the same method. The Cu–S catalyst was synthesized under the same conditions as mentioned above, except for the absence of Co salt. The synthetic methods of Fe–S and Co–S are similar to that of Cu–S.
Material characterization
The phase information was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku-Ultima III with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), ranging from 10 to 80° at a scan rate of 4° min−1. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) was adopted to investigate the surface morphology and elemental information of the as-prepared samples. To further verify the microstructure of the catalysts, transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, Japan) was performed. The surface chemistry of the as-prepared materials was determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250XI, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The full scan energy was 100 eV and the high-resolution (HR) studies were performed at an energy of 20 eV.
Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical tests were performed by using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation with a suitable three-electrode system at room temperature; 1.0 M KOH solution was used as the electrolyte, carbon felt-supported products as the working electrode, a graphite rod as the counter/auxiliary electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. For the convenience of comparison, all the potentials were adjusted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The calibration was performed according to the formula: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 × pH + 0.197.
The polarization curve of the electrode was then obtained by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) testing. The potential window for OER was 0.2–0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, while for HER it was −0.9 to −1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The scanning rate was 5.0 mV s−1. The electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) of the nanomaterial electrodes were measured by CV curves in a small potential range and calculated from the linear slope of the current density vs. scan rates. EIS measurements were conducted by applying an initial voltage bias with 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range from 100000 to 0.01 Hz. The stability tests were performed by using the chronopotentiometry technique in 1 M KOH solution for 10000 s at the potential where a current density of 10 mA cm−2 occurs.
Overall water splitting measurements were performed using a CHI 760E potentiostat in a two-electrode system by applying active materials as both the cathode and anode. Prior to measurement, the resistance testing was conducted and the IR compensation was applied, which was similar to the OER and HER measurements. The electrocatalytic activity of the CuCo2S4 electrode towards the overall water splitting was examined by polarization curves using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 1.0 M KOH with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. For comparison, 5 mg of Pt/C and RuO2 were dispersed in a mixture of 0.02 mL Nafion solution and 0.98 mL ethanol and ultrasonicated. The prepared catalyst ink was then uniformly coated on a 1 cm × 1 cm−2 carbon paper.
Results and discussion
As shown in Scheme 1, CuCo2S4 TSA was successfully synthesized via a simple, rational one-pot solvothermal procedure. The as-synthesized samples were characterized via XRD in order to reveal the crystal phase and purity of the optimal sample. As can be seen from Fig. 1a and S2,† diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 16.1, 26.6, 31.3, 38.0, 47.0, 50.0 and 54.8° are attributed to the (111), (022), (113), (004), (224), (115) and (044) planes, respectively, of the body-centred cubic CuCo2S4 phase (JCPDS 42-1450), which confirmed the successful synthesis of the CuCo2S4 phase on the carbon felt. On comparing the crystallinity of the three samples, CuCo2S4 synthesized at 160 °C was found to be the best. The XRD patterns of the Co–Fe based samples were also characterized and assigned to the typical diffractions of CoFe2O4 (JCPDS card 02-1045) and FeS2 (JCPDS card 02-0927), denoted as FeS2/CoFe2O4; the oxide formation may be attributed to the slight oxidation of the material under an air atmosphere. The diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern for the Cu–Fe based sample (Fig. S1b†) were assigned to the typical diffractions of CuFeS2 (JCPDS card 99-0029) and CuS (JCPDS card 01-1281), denoted as CuS/CuFeS2, revealing the successful synthesis of the complex sulfides.

(h) TEM image of a part of a CuCo2S4 sheet and the corresponding HRTEM image (inset). 
The surface morphologies of the three ternary samples were characterized by SEM. It was clearly shown that large amounts of CuCo2S4 TSA were uniformly and vertically aligned on the carbon felt (Fig. 1b and c) with average sheet width of 1–2 μm and thickness of 20–50 nm, which plays a key role in ensuring the overall performance of the electrode for electrochemical reactions by exposing adequate active sites. It should be noted that the sheet structure was not formed for CuCo2S4 reacted at 120 °C (Fig. S3a†). However, at 180 °C, CuCo2S4 showed severe aggregation with the appearance of some small particles. (Fig. S3c†). Thus, the reaction temperature of 160 °C is appropriate for the synthesis of the sheet array structure. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis (Fig. S4†) disclosed the existence of S, Cu, Co elements in the composite. The relative atomic contents of Cu, Co and S were approximately 15.76, 30.42 and 53.81 atom%, respectively; the atomic ratio was about 1:2:4, in accordance with the molar ratios of their precursors and further revealed the successful synthesis of CuCo2S4. Besides, the SEM image of FeS2/CoFe2O4 (Fig. 1d) and CuS/CuFeS2 (Fig. 1e) demonstrated polyhedron/particle complex and nanoparticle morphologies, respectively. As for a typical CuCo2S4 sheet, the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image showed a regular crystal shape (Fig. 1f). The corresponding EDS mapping of the sheet from Fig. 1f showed the uniform distribution of Cu, Co and S. The TEM image (Fig. 1h) of a part of a sheet showed numerous pores and defects (yellow dotted circles), which, according to previous reports, are beneficial for furnishing more active sites for electrocatalysis and accessible channels for ion transport.46,47 Compared with the TEM images obtained at different temperatures (Fig. S3b, d† and 1h), defects were only observed at the reaction temperature of 160 °C, while a lower or higher the temperature would result in a reticulated structure or severe aggregation. The HRTEM from a part of the sheet showed an obvious lattice fringe of 0.55 nm and was assigned to the (111) plane of CuCo2S4 indicating, along with the above discussion, the successful preparation of CuCo2S4 TSA.
Further investigation of the surface chemical information for the as-prepared samples was performed via XPS characterization. The full scan XPS spectrum (Fig. S5†) suggests the presence of C, O, and S elements for the three samples, among which the C signals could be ascribed to the carbon felt substrate and O might be introduced because of the exposure to the air atmosphere. Besides, metal signals were also detected in each sample at higher binding energies. High-resolution XPS spectra of the elements were fitted to elucidate the valence and bonding information of the three samples. As can be seen from Fig. 2a, the Co 2p spectrum of CuCo2S4 TSA was deconvoluted into two spin–orbit doublets and a shakeup satellite in which the binding energies at 778.6 eV and the two fitting peaks at 781.4 and 802.8 eV correspond to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 spin–orbit peaks, respectively, confirming the existence of two kinds of cobalt oxidation state, Co3+ and Co2+.48 The mixed-valence of +2 and +3 would form a redox pair, which plays a significant role in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity.15,49,50 In comparison, the FeS2/CoFe2O4 sample only showed a cobalt oxidation state of Co2+. Typical features are seen in the high-resolution deconvoluted XPS spectrum of Cu 2p in CuCo2S4 samples (Fig. 2b). The first doublet at 932.2 and 934.8 eV and the second at 952.0 and 954.5 eV are attributed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 core levels, respectively. Very strong shakeup satellite peaks were observed at 943.0 and 962.5 eV, which attest to the presence of the Cu2+ oxidation state and significant ligand–metal charge transfer.51 The much lower content of Cu2+ for CuS/CuFeS2 sample can be explained by the negligible satellite peaks of Cu 2p (Fig. 2b), which indicate the loss of Cu–O bond; this is one of the factors that reduce the OER performance. The spectrum of Fe 2p was fitted with two spin–orbit doublets arising from 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 signals (Fig. S6†), also indicating the existence of the mixed-valence of +2 and +3. The binding energies of the S 2p peaks were 161.9 eV (2p3/2) and 163.5 eV (2p1/2), indicating that the S species exist as S2− (Fig. 2c).8 Another peak at 168.8 eV suggests a strong interaction between the adsorbed oxygen and S to form sulfate or sulfite-like species.52 The fitting results of high-resolution S 2p peaks for FeS2/CoFe2O4 and CuS/CuFeS2 samples are consistent with the CuCo2S4 TSA. On the basis of these XPS analyses, we see that our nanostructured samples have some hydroxide and/or nitrate impurities at the surface that originated from adsorbed species such as water. However, these impurities are beyond the XRD detection limit.

The OER activity of the developed catalysts was evaluated via a three-electrode setup. The Co–S catalyst presented much better electrocatalytic activity (Fig. S7a†) as compared to Fe–S and Cu–S catalysts, while the Cu–S catalyst showed a much lower onset potential than the other two samples. With a similar synthetic procedure, CuCo2S4 TSA was successfully obtained, along with the other two samples, FeS2/CoFe2O4 and CuS/CuFeS2. As can be seen from the polarization curves in Fig. 3a, the CuCo2S4 TSA showed the best OER activity with a much lower onset potential and a steep elevating slope as compared to those of FeS2/CoFe2O4, CuS/CuFeS2 and commercial RuO2. Besides, the CuCo2S4 TSA also outperformed the CuCo2S4 obtained without carbon felt (Fig. S8a†), indicating the significant impact of the CuCo2S4 and carbon felt. Specifically, the CuCo2S4 TSA has an overpotential as low as 210 mV, which outperformed FeS2/CoFe2O4 (330 mV), CuS/CuFeS2 (400 mV), commercial RuO2 and mono-metal sulfides (Fig. 3b), and verified the coordination effect between Cu and Co. According to recently published research papers (Table S1†), the CuCo2S4 TSA electrocatalyst has excellent OER activity and ranks higher than most of the reported catalysts. Tafel plots were obtained by fitting the polarization curves according to the Tafel equation (η = blogj + c, where j is the current density, b is the slope, η is the overpotential, and c is a constant). The Tafel slope is an important kinetic parameter for revealing changes in the apparent OER mechanism, and the lower the value of b, the faster the OER kinetics. The Tafel slope (Fig. S7b†) of CuS (198.1 mV dec−1) is higher than those of CoS (75.9 mV dec−1) and FeS (84.8 mV dec−1), indicating the excellent reaction kinetics of CoS. For the bimetallic catalysts (Fig. 3c), the Tafel slope of CuCo2S4 TSA (43.8 mV dec−1) is much lower as compared to those of FeS2/CoFe2O4 (83.3 mV dec−1), CuS/CuFeS2 (171.8 mV dec−1) and commercial RuO2 (98.6 mV dec−1), revealing the fastest reaction kinetics of CuCo2S4 TSA for the OER. Besides, the optimum reaction temperature of CuCo2S4 TSA was investigated, where the polarization curves (Fig. 3d) and the corresponding point plots (Fig. 3e) both confirmed the best reaction temperature of 160 °C, at which the best OER activity was obtained. The Tafel plots (Fig. 3f) derived from the polarization curves also demonstrated the faster reaction kinetics of CuCo2S4 reacted at 160 °C. In order to obtain a suitable quantity for the sulfuration reaction, the activity and reaction kinetics of the corresponding materials were studied by tuning the proportion of Cu:S from 1:3 to 1:4 and 1:5 (Fig. 3g–i), demonstrating that at the ratio of 1:4, the optimum OER performance can be achieved, showing a lower overpotential and faster kinetics. Thus, according to the above discussions, the ternary CuCo2S4 TSA obtained at 160 °C with a Cu:S ratio of 1:4 can deliver the highest OER activity and kinetics, which could be due to the obtained well-defined crystalline structure as well as the pore- and defect-rich sheet morphology under these preparation conditions.

The HER properties of the samples were also evaluated. The mono-metal sulfide Cu–S catalyst exhibited much higher activity than Fe–S and Co–S catalysts, while Co–S showed a much lower onset potential than the other two samples (Fig. S9a†). Taking advantage of the Cu–S and Co–S, the ternary CuCo2S4 TSA showed a much higher activity (Fig. 4a) with an overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (η10) of 69.0 mV (Fig. 4b), which is much lower as compared to that of FeS2/CoFe2O4 (178.0 mV), CuS/CuFeS2 (139.0 mV) and CuCo2S4 obtained without carbon felt (213.0 mV, Fig. S8b†) and close to that of Pt/C (52.5 mV), and also outperformed most of the related non-noble metal catalysts listed (Table S2†). To gain insight into the catalytic properties, Tafel plots were further obtained from the conversion of the polarization curves based on the Tafel equation.53 Based on the calculations, CuCo2S4 TSA showed a much smaller Tafel slope value (55.4 mV dec−1) than FeS2/CoFe2O4 (65.9 mV dec−1), CuS/CuFeS2 (83.6 mV dec−1) and mono-metal sulfides (Fig. S9b†) and a closer value to that of Pt/C (57.8 mV dec−1), indicating the excellent reaction kinetics of CuCo2S4 TSA. Based on the excellent electrocatalytic performance of CuCo2S4, investigations of the reaction temperature and ratio of Cu:S were further performed in order to optimize the HER activity. As can be seen from Fig. 4d–f, the catalysts obtained at 160 °C showed the highest HER activity and fastest reaction kinetics as compared to the other catalysts obtained at 120 and 180 °C. This is because 160 °C could facilitate a well-formed crystal structure, whereas the lower or higher temperature resulted in a poor crystalline structure or severe aggregation. The HER polarization curves and the Tafel slopes of the materials prepared at different Cu:S ratios (Fig. 4g) confirmed that the optimum ratio was 1:4, with the highest OER performance as compared with that at 1:3 and 1:5.

Cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates was conducted to determine the electrochemical specific surface area (ECSA) of these composites over OER and HER. According to the CV curves in the potential range of 1.10–1.20 V (vs. RHE, Fig. 5a and S10†), the ECSA values of CuCo2S4 TSA, FeS2/CoFe2O4 and CuS/CuFeS2 nanocomposites calculated from the slope values of the linear plots of scan rate vs. the variation of charging current density (Δj) at 1.15 V (Fig. 5b) are 13.2, 8.5 and 4.6 mF cm−2, respectively. These indicate a larger catalytically accessible surface area of CuCo2S4 nanosheets arrays in the OER process. Further electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements have also been performed. Nyquist plots (Fig. 5c) for CuCo2S4 TSA, FeS2/CoFe2O4 and CuS/CuFeS2 all showed typical semicircles and subsequent linear parts, representing the charge transfer impedance (Rct) and diffusion resistance, respectively, while the point of intersection between the curve and the abscissa indicate the solution resistance (Rs). After fitting via the equivalent circuit diagram (Fig. S11†), the histogram of the three samples (inset of Fig. 5c) showed the Rs and Rct values, where CuCo2S4 TSA possesses the lowest Rct value, responsible for the quick charge transfer process across the electrolyte solution and electrocatalyst and accelerating the kinetics of the reaction. By comparing the CV curves and the corresponding fitting straight lines of the three catalysts (Fig. 5d, e and S12†), a larger electrochemical active surface area of CuCo2S4 TSA was demonstrated for the HER process, which enhanced the electrocatalytic activity. In addition, a smaller Rct value was obtained for CuCo2S4 TSA at an HER voltage bias of −0.1 V, indicating a faster charge transfer rate. Furthermore, to estimate the reflection of the intrinsic activity of the catalyst and the effect of Rct during the reaction, we calculated the exchange current density (iex, see the ESI† for the specific calculations). The iex value of CuCo2S4 TSA (18.3 mA cm−2 for OER and 13.7 mA cm−2 for HER, Table S4†) was evidence of the lower resistance across the electrode interface and rapid electron transfer during the electrocatalytic process. Thus, on combining the electrode kinetics for the OER and HER, the as-synthesized CuCo2S4 TSA exhibited more facile electrode kinetics, which is a key point for the excellent catalytic activity.

Despite the superior electrochemical activity, operation stability is another key parameter in real applications. Thus, durability testing is necessary for the CuCo2S4 TSA. I–t chronoamperometric measurements were conducted for the OER and HER stability of CuCo2S4 TSA, by fixing the potential at an initial current density of 10 mA cm−2, as compared with commercial noble metal catalysts. As can be seen in Fig. 6a, the CuCo2S4 TSA sample exhibited only a slight current attenuation of 16.7% after 10000 s of continuous running, whereas the current density decay of the commercial RuO2 was up to 34.7% (inset of Fig. 5a). Besides, the polarization curves after 5000 and 10000 potential CV cycles (Fig. S13†) measured under the same conditions showed a slight shift to the right, relative to the initial measurement. Durability testing in Fig. 6b showed the improved HER stability of CuCo2S4 TSA as compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Both of the durability tests confirmed the excellent operating stability of the carbon-felt-supported CuCo2S4 TSA, which can be possibly explained by the cross-arranged structure of the nanosheets preventing the aggregation and dissolution of active components, keeping continuous electron transfer pathways between the nanosheets and carbon felt. The remarkable bifunctional electrochemical activity and stability make CuCo2S4 TSA highly promising as a water-splitting catalyst.

Given the outstanding OER and HER performances of CuCo2S4 TSA, further overall water-splitting tests were applied by utilizing the as-prepared catalysts as both anode and cathode in a two-electrode configuration. Remarkably, the voltage to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for CuCo2S4 TSA was as low as 1.48 V (Fig. 7a and b). This is substantially lower than that of FeS2/CoFe2O4 (1.72 V), CuS/CuFeS2 (1.88 V), commercial Pt/C (1.67 V), RuO2 (1.57 V), and Pt/C–RuO2 composites (1.55 V), and is listed at the top of the previously reported bifunctional catalysts (Table S3†). Moreover, at a constant voltage of 1.65 V, CuCo2S4 TSA can drive a high current density of 180.8 mA cm−2, whereas other electrolyzers can only deliver current densities below 40 mA cm−2, suggesting the outstanding performance of CuCo2S4 TSA for overall water-splitting. At a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2, CuCo2S4 TSA exhibited excellent stability at a low working potential for more than 10 h, as compared to Pt/C–RuO2 composites, which was confirmed by steady chronoamperometry testing (Fig. 7d). Accordingly, the outstanding overall-water-splitting activity of the hybrid catalyst makes it a promising candidate for industrial use.

Conclusions
In summary, a CuCo2S4 TSA composite was successfully obtained via the simple rational one-pot solvothermal procedure. Taking advantage of the uniform freestanding defective sheet structure, the coordination effect of the metal species and the high-conductive carbon skeleton, the ternary composite resulted in excellent OER and HER activity with outstanding reaction kinetics that outperformed the other ternary composites, mono-metal sulfides and commercial noble metal catalysts. Besides, the CuCo2S4 TSA exhibited improved long-term stability towards the OER and HER relative to commercial noble metal catalysts. As a catalyst for overall water-splitting, the CuCo2S4 TSA showed excellent activity and stability, directing an effective low-cost and large-scale synthetic strategy for high-efficiency binder-free catalysts in renewable energy conversion.
