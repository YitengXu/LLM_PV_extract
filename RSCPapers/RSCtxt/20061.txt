    , Accepted 6th April 2023First published on 8th April 2023AbstractThermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been rapidly developed over a decade, and they all have efficiencies in excess of 35% in the visible range. Despite their high external quantum efficiency, the broad 70–110 nm emission spectra and short device lifetime have limited their commercialization. The recent rapid development of multiple resonance (MR) TADF materials with narrow emission has made them attractive to industry. Hence, high color purity MR-TADF materials are expected to be fourth-generation emitters for high definition (HD) organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this review, we systematically document the TADF emitters based on MR frameworks to date, including molecular design, material structure–photophysical properties and device characteristics. In addition, the molecular design guidelines and future commercial prospects of full-color MR-TADF emitters are envisaged.

1. Introduction
Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) have become vital to display techniques due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, such as self-emission, wide viewing angles, high-contrast color, fast response, and compatibility with various production methods.1–3 Over the past three decades, great breakthroughs have been achieved in improving the performance of OLEDs, allowing them to gradually dominate the display market.4–7 To date, three generations of emitter materials have been invented for high-performance OLEDs: fluorescence (1st generation), phosphorescence (2nd generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (3rd generation).8
The 1st generation fluorescent OLEDs exhibit a limited efficiency of approximately 5–7.5%, as only 25% of the singlet excitons are utilized.9 The 2nd generation phosphorescent emitters can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons due to the strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) of heavy metal atoms, resulting in 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE).10 Currently, commercialized OLEDs are mainly based on phosphorescent materials, although there are still several issues, such as strong exciton annihilation, limited molecular design, and high cost.11 The 3rd generation purely organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters can also realize 100% IQE via an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process,12 and they are low cost, design-unlimited, and highly efficient in full-color TADF OLEDs.13 The traditional TADF molecular design strategy for minimizing singlet–triplet split (ΔEST) involves using a twisted donor–acceptor (D–A) or D-bridge–A construction, which separates the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The wide full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) (∼70–110 nm) of these materials can be attributed to the increased structural relaxation in the excited states and the large Stokes shift, which is very negative for HD displays.14–16 To satisfy the color purity of HD displays, the use of color filters or an optical microcavity is needed, which will lead to significant energy losses.17 To overcome these problems, an innovative strategy should be established to minimize the ΔEST of the TADF emitters without broadening the FWHM.
In recent years, TADF materials have ushered in a new design approach based on the MR effect, which is proposed to achieve both high EQE and narrowband emission.17–20 Narrowband OLEDs are critical components in the development of energy-saving and HD displays.17,21–24 Highly efficient MR-TADF emitters have been achieved with a full-color spectral range in monomolecules.25–27 Narrowband MR-TADF OLEDs exhibit a larger color gamut than conventional LCDs with the prospect of 4th generation display technology. However, OLEDs also have a significant drawback in that the organic materials used in devices decay more quickly than the inorganic materials used in LCDs, which still cannot be resolved well. Further innovation is needed to develop efficient, stable and pure-color TADF emitters for commercial applications.
Currently, MR molecules are divided into two categories, one based on boron and nitrogen atoms and the other based on nitrogen atoms and carbonyl groups.28–31 Molecular frontier orbitals of the HOMO and LUMO are separated by the opposite resonance effect of the donor and acceptor. In this review, all MR-TADF materials based on polycyclic aromatic compounds are summarized to design high-performance full-color emitters that satisfy the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) color coordinate requirement defined by broadcasting standards.32 The synthesis methods, photophysical properties, sensitized MR-TADF project, and device performance are included. A prospect for full-color narrowband OLEDs is presented, which is a competitive candidate for commercial displays in terms of efficiency and lifetime.
2. Basics of MR-TADF emitters
Compared to conventional intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)-type TADF molecules, MR-TADF emitters show a narrow FWHM that can satisfy the requirements of display applications (Fig. 1a and b). The use of short-range charge density is an effective method to achieve narrow spectral emission in luminescent materials. MR-TADF emitters, as proposed by Hatakeyama et al., are characterized by a short-range charge density while maintaining a high degree of electron–hole overlap. MR-TADF emitters are a new type of fused polycyclic aromatic compounds, in which electron-donating atoms (donors) and electron-deficient atoms (acceptors) are arranged in pairs due to their complementary resonance effects in the fused planar polycyclic aromatic framework. As shown in Fig. 1c, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon core of the current MR molecules is based on the para-substitution of boron (B) and oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) or sulfur (S) atoms, or N atoms and carbonyl (CO) groups. In MR-TADF emitters, electron-rich regions are mainly located on donor atoms and their orthogonal and neighboring carbon atoms, while electron-poor regions are confined to acceptor atoms and their orthogonal and neighboring carbon atoms. In the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, the electronic density distribution exhibits alternating electron-rich and electron-poor regions throughout the ring; in the ground state, the electronic density distribution also shows the same alternating pattern, but the electron-rich and electron-poor regions are exchanged. Thus, MR-TADF emitters combine long-range interactions and conductivity in a unique way, promoting high radiative decay rates while minimizing short-range charge density rearrangements of singlet-triplet energy gaps. And the results showed that MR-TADF emitters exhibit high oscillator strength (f), leading to delayed fluorescence and high PLQY. Furthermore, the rigid character of the emitter leads to a significant reduction in the vibrational motion of the molecule, resulting in a narrower emission band. To date, MR-TADF-based OLEDs featuring high EQE and narrowband emissions simultaneously have been realized within the spectral range of 450–690 nm. However, pure red MR-TADF emitters are still lacking due to the highly restricted molecular design strategy.21 The timeline of the development of MR-core-based TADF emitters is shown in Fig. 2. We discuss the related materials based on these three parent cores in the next sections. The representative materials molecular structures and involved in each chapter are shown in Fig. 3–16. The photophysical properties of the emitters are summarized in Tables 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13. The emitting layer structures and the electroluminescent performances of devices are discussed in Tables 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14.

3. Design strategies for MR-TADF emitters
In this section, we provide the molecular design strategies of MR-TADF emitters and their representative molecules.
3.1. Color gamut of MR-TADF emitters
Because of their unique color purity, MR-TADF emitters have great potential in HD displays.17 Most MR-TADF emitters are B,N-based, limited by the backbone of the underlying molecules, resulting in light emitting regions that are basically in the blue to green range. Although all these blue emitters are very efficient, CIE y values below 0.10 are very rare. Also, there are very few reports of green MR-TADF materials with CIE y values beyond 0.70. Red MR materials with wavelengths greater than 620 nm are scarce, and near-infrared materials have not been reported.

3.1.1 Blue MR-TADF emitters. 
As shown in Fig. 1c, all unmodified MR backbones are blue emitters. Hatakeyama and co-workers successfully prepared a boron- and oxygen-containing polycyclic aromatic compound 2avia a scalable one-pot sequential synthetic procedure in 2015 (Fig. 4a).33 Moreover, a series of derivatives were synthesized by modification at the periphery with 2a as the core, called 2b–2d (Fig. 4a). The parent core 2a shows violet-deep blue emission at 398 nm with a small FWHM (34 nm) in 0.02 mM dichloromethane and a high PLQY of 72% in a 1 wt% polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film. The photoluminescence (PL) of derivatives 2b–2d (442–459 nm) is redshifted due to the introduction of two additional benzene rings, and the FWHM is also small. This shows the potential of host materials for application in OLEDs because of the higher triplet energy (T1) than that of blue phosphorescence and TADF dopants. Thus, PhOLEDs containing 2c or 2d as host materials exhibit superior performance and device lifetimes compared to those of CBP hosts. Following di-oxygen-bridged aromatic borane 2a, Oi and co-workers successfully synthesized tri-oxygen-bridged planarized triphenylborane 1 (Fig. 4b) in 2016.34 Compound 1 exhibited violet fluorescence with a peak at 386 nm and a high PLQY of 63.2%. We have found that there are no reports of their use as emitters in OLEDs, although they have MR properties, mainly because their emission spectra are in the ultraviolet or near ultraviolet range. Unfortunately, TADF emitters based on oxygen-bridged aromatic boranes connected with other donors failed to show MR performance, and these materials were only used as host materials or acceptor units.35–37
 Fig. 4  (a–y) Chemical structures of emitters discussed in Section 3.1.1.26,32–34,38–44,47–59 
Recently, Wang et al. designed and synthesized two ultrapure blue TADF emitters, PhCz-TOSBA and TPA-TOSBA (Fig. 4c), based on a rigid sulfur/oxygen-bridged triarylboron acceptor.38 Both emitters exhibit deep-blue emission at 444 and 447 nm with small FWHMs of 32 and 34 nm, respectively. Surprisingly, although the FWHM of PhCz-TOSBA is 32 nm, which is smaller than that of TPA-TOSBA (34 nm), TPA-TOSBA is an MR-TADF and PhCz-TOSBA is a typical D–A-type TADF. The reason for the occurrence of this phenomenon is probably the nonrigid triphenylamine group in TPA-TOSBA. However, they only show low kRISC values of 4.08 × 104 and 1.91 × 104 s−1 due to their ΔEST values of 0.23 and 0.36 eV, respectively. Since the PLQYs of PhCz-TOSBA (61%) and TPA-TOSBA (62%) were not so satisfying, OLEDs fabricated with them achieved medium-high EQEs of 16.65% and 16.69%, respectively, and deep-blue EL at 456 nm with FWHM of approximately 55 and 57 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.14,0.15) and (0.14,0.12), respectively.
Furthermore, Wang's group developed B,S-doped materials without O atoms as deep-blue TADF emitters, and they developed B,S-doped materials as deep-blue TADF emitters, BSS-Ac, BSS-SpAc, BSS-PA, and BSS-Cz (Fig. 4d).39 Unfortunately, DFT calculations showed that BSS-Ac is an emitter with distinct ICT characteristics, BSS-SpAc exhibits ICT and MR characteristics, and BSS-PA and BSS-Cz are MR-TADF molecules. Thus, BSS-Ac and BSS-SpAc show dual emission bands, a narrow emission band at 456 nm and a broad emission band at 513 and 505 nm, respectively. BSS-PA and BSS-Cz exhibited narrowband deep blue emission at 454 and 455 nm with FWHMs of 35 and 28 nm, respectively. They achieved PLQYs of 90%, 89%, 66% and 86% and ΔEST values of 0.04, 0.07, 0.13 and 0.14 eV, respectively. The authors used them as guest materials to fabricate OLED devices. BSS-Ac-, BSS-SpAc-, and BSS-PA-based devices exhibited broad emission with FWHMs of 67, 79 and 58 nm, λELs of 515, 495 and 475 nm and EQEs of 20.6%, 25.1% and 16.8%, respectively, while the deep-blue device fabricated with BSS-Cz showed a narrow FWHM of 29 nm with a λEL of 464 nm, CIE color coordinates of (0.13, 0.09), and an EQEmax of 21.8%. This work provides a new approach for the development of B,S-doped materials, which is beneficial for improving deep-blue MR-TADF emitters.
After proposing B,O-doped materials, Hatakeyama and co-workers presented a novel design strategy for TADF molecules based on a rigid B,N-doped polycyclic aromatic framework in 2016.32 B,N-doped polycyclic aromatic compounds are synthesized in the same way as B,O-doped compounds. The molecules with B–N para-substitution can significantly separate the HOMO and LUMO because the B and N atoms exhibit an opposite resonance effect. DABNA-1 and DABNA-2 are the MR-TADF emitters which were originally reported by Hatakeyama et al. (Fig. 4e).32DABNA-1 and DABNA-2 exhibit strong and sharp PL bands at 462 and 470 nm with FWHMs of 33 and 34 nm, respectively, because of the multiple resonance effect. Both compounds not only show small ΔEST (0.14–0.18 eV) but also exhibit a high absolute PLQY (84–90%) in solution and in the solid state. Due to the rigid π-conjugated framework, the deep-blue OLEDs employing DABNA-1 as an emitter exhibit an EQE of 13.5% and an EL peak at 459 nm with an FWHM of 28 nm and CIE coordinates of (0.13, 0.09). Compared to DABNA-1 (f = 0.205), the introduction of substituents in DABNA-2 can improve the oscillator strength (f = 0.415). The device based on DABNA-2 exhibits a higher EQE of 20.2% and pure blue emission at 467 nm with a narrow FWHM of 28 nm and CIE coordinates of (0.12, 0.13). This result provides a basis for the realization of high-performance OLEDs using MR-TADF emitters.
The next year, the same group synthesized boron-centered triangulene (2a) with MR properties (Fig. 4f).402a exhibits a sharp and strong emission band at 399 nm with an FWHM of 26 nm and a small ΔEST of 0.21 eV, making it a promising candidate as an OLED emitter. Regretfully, the device performance has not been reported. In addition, they successfully developed three B,N-doped nanographenes, B2–B4 (Fig. 4g).41B2–B4 in PMMA films (1 wt% doped) showed deep blue emission at 455, 441, and 450 nm with FWHM of 32, 34, and 38 nm, respectively. The ΔEST values were estimated to be 0.15–0.18 eV. They are promising MR-TADF emitters for OLEDs. The device based on B2 exhibited high performance with maximum EQE of 18.3% and 12.6% at 100 cd m−2. The blue EL emission wavelength peak was observed at 460 nm, and the FWHM was 37 nm (0.21 eV) with CIE color coordinates of (0.13, 0.11). Compared to B2, more B–π–N conjugation in B3 reduces the intensity of the donor and acceptor, which leads to a blueshift of the emission wavelength. Thus, the B–π–N design strategy has been helpful for the development of deep-blue MR-TADF materials.
To further improve the performance of blue devices without loss of color purity, Hatakeyama and co-workers developed a new polycyclic framework ν-DABNA containing two boron and four nitrogen atoms (Fig. 3 and 4h).42 This MR-TADF material exhibited an ultrapure blue emission at 468 nm with an FWHM of 14 nm in toluene. The ΔEST value was estimated to be 17 meV in the doped film. Based on the high PLQY (82%) and short lifetimes (τp = 4.1 ns and τd = 4.1 μs), ν-DABNA showed a fast kRISC of 2.0 × 105 s−1. Consequently, the device showed excellent efficiencies and low efficiency roll-off (34.4% at maximum, 32.8% at 100 cd m−2 and 26.0% at 1000 cd m−2). Furthermore, the device exhibited pure blue emission at 469 nm with an FWHM of 18 nm, and the corresponding CIE coordinates were (0.12, 0.11), making it the best B,N-doped-based device at the time.
One of the reasons that hinders the practical application of MR-TADF is that the construction of extension frameworks usually requires the integration of multiple synthesis steps. Thus, Hatakeyama et al. reported a new sky-blue MR-TADF emitter, V-DABNA-Mes, with three boron and six nitrogen atoms through a one-shot synthesis of expanded heterohelicene (Fig. 4i).43 Through the electronic interaction of three boron atoms and six nitrogen atoms, V-DABNA-Mes exhibited MR characteristics and showed narrow PL emission with a FWHM of 16 nm at 484 nm with 80% PLQY in a PMMA dispersion film (1 wt%). The solution-processed OLEDs fabricated with V-DABNA-Mes showed a sharp sky-blue emission at 480 nm with a FWHM of 27 nm and a high EQEmax of 22.9%.
Later, to boost RISC and consequently reduce the delayed fluorescence lifetime, Lee's group reported a derivative of the t-DABNA core, t-DAB-DPA, with two boron atoms and two diphenylamine donors attached at para positions to the boron atoms (Fig. 4j).44 Although t-DAB-DPA incorporates an additional donor unit (bis(tert-butylphenyl)amine) compared to t-DABNA, the emission peak is retained in the blue region as in DABNA-1. Thus, t-DAB-DPA exhibits deep blue fluorescence emission with a wavelength of 446 nm and a narrow FWHM of 18 nm. t-DAB-DPA achieves a smaller ΔEST (0.10 eV) and higher PLQY (94%). In addition, t-DAB-DPA shows a shorter delayed fluorescence decay time compared to t-DABNA because of its smaller ΔEST. The TADF devices based on different doping concentrations of t-DAB-DPA show high EQEmax values of 25.9–27.9% and low efficiency roll-off. The devices exhibit EQEs of 21.3–21.8% at 1000 cd m−2. Moreover, all of the devices show pure deep blue emission with CIE coordinates of (0.13, 0.08) and a small FWHM value of 26 nm. Therefore, this work allows the design of TADF emitters to achieve a high EQE, pure blue emission, and an EQE independent of doping concentration.
Many researchers have found that a new B,N-MR core, Cz-B (Fig. 4k), can be synthesized by replacing diphenylamine with carbazole, which exhibits sky blue emission.45,46 Yasuda et al. introduced electron-withdrawing imines partially into the B–N skeleton to synthesize a new blue emitter, γ-Cb-B (Fig. 4k).26 Compared to Cz-B, γ-Cb-B shows a significant increase in the energy band gap due to the presence of the imine group, decreasing the HOMO energy level. γ-Cb-B displays an emission peak at 461 nm and an FWHM of 30 nm in the doped film. Moreover, the emitter shows a small ΔEST of 0.12 eV and a high PLQY of 89% in the doped film. Consequently, the device based on γ-Cb-B as an emitter shows a λEL at 461 nm and a narrow FWHM of 28 nm. In addition, this device exhibits a maximum EQE as high as 19.0%. It can be assured that this method could effectively blueshift the emission color without loss of efficiency.
Recently, Yang et al. discovered a simple and effective strategy to develop narrowband blue MR-TADF materials by embedding a sulfone unit in a B/N multiring backbone.47 Therefore, they synthesized three types of MR-TADF emitters, PTZBN1, PTZBN2 and PTZBN3 (Fig. 4l), to verify this strategy. The sulfone-based emitter PTZBN3 showed a PL peak at 468 nm with an FWHM of 30 nm in toluene solution, which was blueshifted compared to that of PTZBN1 (490/41 nm) and PTZBN2 (483/41 nm) without the sulfone unit. These results are attributed to the efficacious suppression of the vibronic coupling between the S1–S0 transition and structure vibrations with the introduction of the sulfone segment. Their PLQY and ΔEST values were 98%, 95% and 98%, and 0.16, 0.15 and 0.17 eV, respectively. In devices, PTZBN1, PTZBN2 and PTZBN3 exhibited EQEmax values of 26.9%, 30.5% and 19.9%, respectively, and narrow blue emission (λEL of 496, 483 and 476 nm with FWHM of 47, 43 and 36 nm) and CIE color coordinates of (0.16, 0.51), (0.13, 0.31) and (0.13, 0.22), respectively. In particular, OLEDs with 11′-(2-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)phenyl)-10′-methyl-11′H-spiro[fluorene-9,12′-indeno[2,1-a]carbazole] (USF) as a TADF sensitizer showed EQEmax values of 32.7%, 34.8% and 32.0%. They demonstrated a new molecular design for obtaining narrowband blue emitters and high-performance blue OLEDs by incorporating a sulfone unit into the MR skeleton.
Additionally, this group reported a new strategy for synthesizing blue MR-TADF emitters by peripheral decoration.48 They developed three new MR-TADF emitters, DPACzBN1, DPACzBN2 and DPACzBN3 (Fig. 4m), by attaching one or two diphenylamine units on the B,N-embraced MR framework. These emitters were all structurally unsymmetrical and showed narrowband emission in toluene with λPL values of 469, 460 and 468 nm and FWHM values of 23, 22 and 20 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, they exhibited high PLQYs of 98, 92 and 94% and small ΔEST values of 0.11, 0.12 and 0.13 eV, respectively. Apparently, OLED devices fabricated with DPACzBN1, DPACzBN2 and DPACzBN3 achieved high EQEs of 23.6, 24.0 and 27.7%, respectively, and the λEL/FWHM/CIE values of these devices were 475 nm/34 nm/(0.14, 0.30), 469 nm/28 nm/(0.13, 0.16) and 472 nm/24 nm/(0.12, 0.18), respectively. The results indicated that the introduction of a diphenylamine unit into the MR core can enhance the performance of blue MR-TADF emitters.
Recently, a new approach using lateral peripheral moiety substitution on the MR core that can affect the electron density of the nearby nitrogen atom was proposed for blue MR-TADF by Kwon et al.49 The report contained two structurally related emitters, mICz-DABNA and BFCz-DABNA (Fig. 4n) (contrast molecule: DPACzBN2). The main difference is that mICz-DABNA has an N-phenyl group (electron-donating) at the periphery, while BFCz-DABNA has an O atom (electron-withdrawing) at the periphery. Compared to DPACzBN2 (λPL = 459 nm, in toluene), mICz-DABNA shows a redshifted emission at 461 nm, while BFCz-DABNA exhibits a blueshifted emission at 456 nm. This variation depends on whether the substituent groups are electron-donating or electron-withdrawing. Interestingly, both emitters showed a narrower FWHM of 22 nm in toluene compared to 24 nm for DPACzBN2. mICz-DABNA and BFCz-DABNA were measured to have high PLQYs of 92.6% and 93.1%, respectively, and the same ΔEST of 0.20 eV. The mICz-DABNA-based OLEDs exhibited a λEL of 466 nm (FWHM = 26 nm) with CIE color coordinates of (0.13, 0.11), while the BFCz-DABNA-based OLEDs showed a blueshifted λEL of 463 nm (FWHM = 26 nm) and CIE color coordinates of (0.12, 0.09). The maximum EQEs observed for the devices with mICz-DABNA and BFCz-DABNA were 26.4% and 28.0%, respectively. From this, it can be seen that this strategy will help develop deep and pure blue emitters.
Zhang's group obtained a new blue MR-TADF material DPMX-CzDABNA (Fig. 4o) based on the B,N system with a multiple resonance structure CzDABNA as the core by introducing a modified group diphenylfluorene (DPF) with large spatial site resistance at the periphery.50DPMX-CzDABNA exhibited narrowband sky-blue emission (λEL = 471 nm, FWHM = 22 nm) in toluene solution. Furthermore, a film of 15 wt% DPMX-CzDABNA doped in 2-(9,9′-spirobi[fluoren]-3-yl)-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (SF3-TRZ) exhibited high PLQY (94.2%) and small ΔEST (0.11 eV). Thus, the device based on DPMX-CzDABNA exhibited narrowband EL spectra with improved device efficiency (λEL = 484 nm, FWHM = 29 nm, and EQE = 27.4%). To obtain high-performance WOLED devices, the authors chose the reported high-efficiency orange TADF materials BPPZ-DPXZ and DPMX-CzDABNA to prepare binary WOLED devices and achieve the highest EQE of 26.5%. The device has a low efficiency roll-off (maintained at 20.4% at 1000 cd m−2) and is spectrally stable with CIE coordinates of (0.38, 0.43) at 100 and 1000 cd m−2. This work shows that by introducing a narrowband MR-TADF material as the blue component of WOLED devices, blue emission in the high energy region of WOLED devices can be effectively suppressed, providing a new idea for realizing high performance, blue hazard-free WOLEDs.
Unlike N,B,N-benzo-[4]helicenes (DABNAs), Hatakeyama and colleagues designed and synthesized a new MR-core, B,N,B-benzo-[4]helicenes (ADBNAs) (Fig. 4p).51 The λFL of ADBNA-Me-Mes and ADBNA-Me-Tip was redshifted to 482 and 479 nm, respectively, relative to DABNA-1 (460 nm). The other photophysical properties of ADBNA-Me-Mes and ADBNA-Me-Tip are similar to those of DABNA-1. Therefore, the OLEDs based on ADBNA-Me-Tip as an emitter show a λEL of 480 nm with a small FWHM of 33 nm and an EQEmax of 21.4%. The device employing ADBNA-Me-Mes as an emitter exhibits emission at 481 nm with a small FWHM of 32 nm, but the EQEmax only reaches 16.2%. This design strategy expands the scope of blue MR-TADF emitters.
Kwon and colleagues reported a novel full resonating extended π-skeleton, TPD4PA, by combining both the presented substructures, B,O-doped core (2a) and B,N-doped core (PAB).52 Furthermore, they introduced five tert-butyl groups on TPD4PA and developed tBu-TPD4PA (Fig. 4q). Due to the incorporation of a rigid 2a moiety into the PAB skeleton, the designed emitters exhibited significantly enhanced ICT characteristics with a clear MR effect in the deep blue region. Both emitters, TPD4PA and tBu-TPD4PA, showed deep-blue emission at 445 and 451 nm with the same narrow FWHM of 19 nm in toluene, respectively. TPD4PA and tBu-TPD4PA exhibited small ΔEST values of 0.05 and 0.06 eV and high PLQYs of 88.1% and 90.3%, respectively. They found delayed exciton lifetimes of 4.59 and 5.55 μs for TPD4PA and tBu-TPD4PA, respectively, which were attributed to the high RISC rate of ∼2.51 × 105 s−1. The TPD4PA- and tBu-TPD4PA-based OLEDs showed EQEmax values of 30.7 and 32.5%, respectively. These OLEDs also exhibited the same narrow FWHM of approximately 29 nm and exhibited a deep-blue emission at 455 nm with CIE color coordinates of (0.14, 0.06) for TPD4PA and a deep-blue emission at 460 nm with CIE color coordinates of (0.14, 0.07) for tBu-TPD4PA. This work demonstrated that amalgamating the high CT characteristic moiety into MR-type fragments facilitates the formation of efficient deep-blue MR-TADF emitters with improved CT characteristics.
Eli et al. developed a new molecule and synthesized the emitter NOBNacene (Fig. 4r) with nine six-membered rings fused along one dimension.53 In THF solution, NOBNacene exhibited deep-blue emission with a λPL of 405 nm, an FWHM of 40 nm and a PLQY of 33%. In 1.5 wt% TSPO1 films, NOBNacene showed a PLQY of 71% with a delayed exciton lifetime of 1.77 ms in the emission of the deep blue region. The optimal OLEDs fabricated with NOBNacene as a guest material for the emitting layers showed 11.3% EQEmax with a deep blue λEL of 409 nm and an FWHM of 37 nm, corresponding to CIE color coordinates of (0.176, 0.068). The performance of the device is suitable not only for displays but also for applications requiring a near-UV source.
Adachi and colleagues reported a B,N-doped core (BN1), which is the minimum building block to achieve MR characteristics.54 As shown in Fig. 4s, BN2, BN3 and BN4 were formed on the scaffold of BN1 in a ring-fused planar fashion of triarylborane and/or triarylamine to expand the π-conjugation. As a result, BN1, BN2, BN3 and BN4 exhibited PL peaks at 401, 415, 420 and 417 nm in toluene solution, respectively, and the FWHM values (25–36 nm) decreased with increasing molecular rigidity. They also showed high PLQYs of 76–82%, while their ΔEST values were not small enough to make the TADF characteristics visible. Among the four emitters, BN4 demonstrated the fastest kRISC (196.50 s−1), but it was much smaller than that of the other MR-TADF emitters. The OLEDs fabricated with BN4 exhibited an EQEmax of 9.1%, blue-violet emission at 423 nm, an FWHM of 31 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.17, 0.04).
OLEDs based on MR-TADF containing boron atoms have achieved deep-blue display, high brightness and high efficiency to date. However, the synthesis steps for most materials are complex, and the yields are low.42,43,51 Jiang and co-workers proposed a new method by incorporating carbonyl and aromatic amines to synthesize novel MR-TADF compounds QAO with a yield of 51% (Fig. 4t).55 The carbonyl and nitrogen atoms of the QAO molecule exhibit opposite resonance effects, which can significantly separate the HOMO and LUMO. QAO exhibits a typical MR-TADF signature with a pure blue emission band at 466 nm and a narrow FWHM of 32 nm. The ΔEST is calculated to be 0.18 eV. A high PLQY value of 72.4% is obtained due to a large oscillator intensity of 0.157. The device based on QAO exhibits blue emission at 465 nm with an FWHM of 23 nm, and the corresponding CIE color coordinates are (0.13, 0.18). Furthermore, a maximum EQE of 19.4% is achieved. This result largely improves the efficiency of the device based on aromatic diketone emitters. In addition, an MR-TADF emitter TOAT (Fig. 4u), surrounded by three carbonyl groups, was designed and synthesized by Zhang and colleagues.56 Although it emits in the deep-blue region with an FWHM of only 15 nm, it has a PLQY of only 4.5% and currently has no application prospects.
The reported synthesis of carbonyl-containing optoelectronic functional materials is mainly conducted in the following two ways: (1) derivatization modification of benzophenone and (2) the Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction. Zheng et al. used the addition reaction of carbon negative ions attacking cyano to obtain three carbonyl derivatives, 2,3-CZ, 2,5-CZ, and 2,3-DPA (Fig. 4v).57 As 2,3-CZ, 2,5-CZ and 2,3-DPA exhibit obvious MR effects, the PL spectra show narrow emission bands at 449, 459 and 496 nm with FWHMs of 36, 41 and 57 nm, respectively. However, these three MR-TADF materials show ΔEST values of 0.19–0.26 eV and low PLQY values except for 2,5-CZ, which shows a PLQY of 77.5%. Therefore, the devices based on 2,5-CZ exhibit an EQEmax of 22.3% and an EL peak wavelength of 463 nm with an FWHM of 48 nm. This work provides an effective reference for the synthesis of efficient blue carbonyl MR-TADF molecules.
Lee et al. developed two deep-blue emitters, CZCO and CZ2CO (Fig. 4w), via intramolecular cyclization in a N/CO resonant core (QAO).58 Compared to QAO, CZCO and CZ2CO exhibited blueshifted emissions at 430 and 440 nm with FWHMs of 32 and 16 nm, respectively. The ΔEST/PLQY values were estimated to be 0.33 eV/75% for CZCO and 0.34 eV/84% for CZ2CO. Thus, the EQEmax values of the CZCO- and CZ2CO-based OLEDs were maintained at 26.9% and 25.6%, respectively. Both hyperfluorescent devices exhibited deep-blue emission at 432 nm and 445 nm for CZCO and CZ2CO with FWHM of 44 and 26 nm, corresponding CIE color coordinates of (0.154, 0.051) and (0.157, 0.074), respectively. Notably, the devices maintained an EQE of 24.3% for CZCO and 22.4% for CZ2CO at 1000 cd m−2. This work provides a new molecular design for enriching narrowband deep-blue MR-TADF emitters.
Recently, Eli and colleagues designed and synthesized a new blue MR-TADF emitter, DiICzMes4 (Fig. 4y).59 Different from all previous MR skeletons, this emitter has no acceptor atoms or groups (B/CO) but still shows MR characteristics. The expansion of the π-system in DiICzMes4 ensures a limited overlap between HOMO–LUMO and leads to a small ΔEST of 0.26 eV. DiICzMes4 exhibits a PL emission peak at 441 nm with an FWHM of 17 nm and a PLQY of 70% in toluene (without oxygen). The hyperfluorescent device based on DiICzMes4 shows pure blue emission with CIE color coordinates of (0.15, 0.11), but the efficiency is not too high (16.5%).


3.1.2 Green to yellow MR-TADF emitters. 
Although green MR-TADF emitters were developed later than materials in the blue region, they are not inferior to blue materials in terms of quantity and performance. The MR-TADF material shows limited ICT properties, as the HOMO and LUMO of the MR-TADF emitter are mainly distributed on its rigid heterocyclic backbone. This makes it quite challenging to redshift the emission band for such materials with narrow FWHM and excellent EL properties. To address this problem, Duan and co-workers first reported green MR-TADF emitters (2F-BN, 3F-BN and 4F-BN) by amplifying the influence of the skeleton and peripheral units (Fig. 6a).60 They replaced DPA with Cz to obtain a larger π-conjugated MR core (TCz-BN) and introduced an electron-deficient fluorobenzene group at the para position of the B-substituted phenyl to tune the CT characteristics. Interestingly, the three BN derivatives (2F-BN, 3F-BN and 4F-BN) showed a stronger ICT nature compared to TCz-BN (Fig. 6a). Thus, these three compounds displayed green emission (501–503 nm) in doped films with PLQYs ranging from 83% to 91%. The devices based on 2F-BN, 3F-BN and 4F-BN emitted green color at 501, 499, and 493 nm with FWHMs of 40, 38, and 31 nm, respectively. These devices showed the same turn-on voltage of 2.6 V and EQEmax values of 22.0%, 22.7% and 20.9%, respectively. Notably, 3F-BN exhibited a very small efficiency roll-off, maintaining 21.1% at 1000 cd m−2, due to the smallest ΔEST (0.08 eV) and the shortest τd (16.7 μs).
The reported synthetic methods for long wavelength MR-TADF molecules suffer from several major disadvantages, which restricted the expansion of the MR-TADF family. The first is the low yield of the borylation reaction, the second is the difficulty in separation and purification, and the last is that stronger electron acceptor moieties cannot directly coordinate with boron and form an MR framework. Therefore, Wang's group reported a brief synthetic method to functionalize the MR core that can be attached onto strong acceptors.61 They synthesized a new family of MR-TADF, DtCzB-DPTRZ, DtCzB-TPTRZ, DtCzB-PPm and DtCzB-CNPm (Fig. 6b). In this method, the key step is the successful synthesis of precursor DtCzB-Bpin. Compared to DtCzB, the emission peaks of DtCzB-DPTRZ, DtCzB-TPTRZ, DtCzB-PPm and DtCzB-CNPm exhibit redshifts at 521, 501, 499 and 515 nm with narrow FHWMs of 24, 27, 25 and 36 nm, respectively. Moreover, they show small ΔEST values of 0.08–0.17 eV and high PLQYs of 93–97%. Consequently, OELD devices based on DtCzB-DPTRZ, DtCzB-TPTRZ, DtCzB-PPm and DtCzB-CNPm as emitters show λEL of 532, 516, 508 and 540 nm and narrow FWHM of 39, 38, 33 and 44 nm, respectively. These devices exhibit maximum EQEs as high as 24.6%, 29.8%, 28.6% and 25.0%, respectively. It can be foreseen that this method could effectively realize green emission without affecting the narrow spectral features.
Similar, Yang et al. developed two pure-green MR-TADF emitters, called BN-STO and BN-XTO (Fig. 6c).62 By attaching electron-deficient subunits (selenoxanthone and xanthone), the ICT character of the emitters was enhanced, resulting in a red-shifted emission compared to BCz-BN. BN-STO and BN-XTO exhibit narrow PL bands at 517 and 515 nm with FWHMs of 34 and 33 nm, respectively. These compounds not only show small ΔEST values of 0.13 and 0.08 eV, but also show high PLQYs of 96% and 93%. It is worth noting that the value of kRISC for BN-STO is 1.2 × 105 s−1, which is four times higher than that of BN-XTO (0.3 × 105 s−1). Therefore, the EQEmax of the BN-STO-based OLED is 40.1%, which is the current record for MR-TADF. And the device shows low efficiency roll-off and an EQE of 28.15% at 1000 cd m−2. The EQEmax of BN-XTO-based OLED was 37.4%, and the EQE was 18.9% at 1000 cd m−2. Both devices exhibited similar EL peaks at 517 and 516 nm with the same FWHM of 34 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.19, 0.70). In order to achieve significant improvements in their performance, they used 2,3,4,5,6-pentakis-(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)benzonitrile (5TBuCzBN) as a sensitizer for BN-STO in HF OLEDs. The device showed an EQEmax of 39.8% and the EQE remained 34.0% at 1000 cd m−2. The EL peak was observed at 511 nm with a narrow FWHM of 32 nm (0.154 eV). This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for achieving a balance between fast RISC process and narrow FWHM of MR-TADF by incorporating heavy atoms. The study highlights the potential of heavy atom integration in designing efficient and stable OLEDs with narrowband emission, which could be extended to other TADF emitters.
Although MR-TADF emitters have achieved high performance, these MR-TADF molecules are difficult to synthesize. Hence, Yang et al. simultaneously enhanced the donor strength and extended the peripheral conjugation to obtain three redshifted MR-TADF emitters, BN1, BN2 and BN3, (Fig. 6d) compared to TCz-BN.63 The emission wavelengths of BN1, BN2 and BN3 were tuned from 496 to 562 nm by enhancing the electron-donating ability and the number of peripheral groups. These three emitters exhibited nearly 100% PLQY and a small ΔEST of 0.09–0.13 eV in toluene solution. Thus, the devices based on BN1, BN2 and BN3 showed an EQEmax of 24.3–24.7% and brightness of over 5000 cd m−2.
The same team also proposed a new molecular design strategy based on frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) to achieve a redshift in the emission wavelength of MR-TADF materials.64 An auxiliary donor was attached to the MR framework without altering the MR features in this strategy. Green MR-TADF m-Cz-BNCz was constructed using BNCz as the MR backbone and 3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazole (tCz) as an auxiliary donor (Fig. 6e). The time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) results showed that the dihedral angle between the proximal substituted tCz donor and the B-substituted benzene ring is 51.48°. It is worth noting that the LUMO of m-Cz-BNCz is the same as that of BNCz, while its HOMO is a combination of the HOMO of the MR backbone and auxiliary donor. The separation of FMOs enhances the ICT characteristics of m-CzBNCz and reduces the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO, which realizes a redshift emission. m-Cz-BNCz exhibits a PL peak at 519 nm with a narrow FWHM of 38 nm in toluene. The ΔEST and PLQY of m-Cz-BNCz are 0.08 eV and 97%, respectively. The 10 wt% m-Cz-BNCz-doped device shows an EQEmax of 31.4% and a λEL of 528 nm with an FWHM of 45 nm.
Yasuda et al. successfully designed and synthesized two MR-TADF materials, BBCz-Y(4) and BBCz-G(3) (Fig. 6f).25 Compared to BBCz-Y(4), the presence of B–π–N conjugation in the emitter BBCz-G(3) reduces the donor and acceptor intensities, which leads to blueshift of the emission wavelength. Thus, the photoluminescence peaks of BBCz-G(3) and BBCz-Y(4) in toluene solution are observed at 517 and 549 nm with narrow peaks at 34 and 42 nm, respectively. All these compounds show small ΔEST values of 0.14 and 0.14 eV, respectively. Their PLQYs are 90% and 85% in 2 wt% doped films, respectively. Consequently, the prepared devices based on BBCz-G(3) and BBCz-Y(4) show narrowband EL emission peaks at 515 and 549 nm with FWHM values of 54 and 48 nm and EQEmax values of 31.8% and 29.3%, respectively. It is worth noting that CIE color coordinates of green (0.26, 0.68) are obtained for devices based on BBCz-G(3). This work provides a strategy for blueshifting the emission wavelength of MR-TADF emitters.
Pure green emitters are essential to realize the ultrawide color gamut of next-generation displays, but MR-TADF molecular skeletons and color purity are still limited. Duan et al. fused a nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon to the B–N skeleton and successfully synthesized a heterocyclic multi-resonance molecule AZA-BN (Fig. 6g).65 Compared with BCz-BN, the introduction of heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon not only increases the π-conjugation length but also adjusts the distribution of the HOMO and LUMO. Therefore, AZA-BN exhibits a fluorescence emission of 522 nm in toluene and CIE color coordinates of (0.23, 0.69). The absolute quantum yield of AZA-BN measured in degassed toluene solution was 99.7%, benefitting from the higher f value (0.2820). Hence, the maximum EQE and PE of the AZA-BN-based device were 28.2% and 121.7 lm W−1, respectively. The green OLED showed an emission peak at 527 nm with an FWHM of 30 nm and corresponding CIE color coordinates of (0.27, 0.69). Recently, Wang et al. synthesized a greener MR-TADF emitter, BN-TP (Fig. 6h), reported thus far using the same strategy.66 The results showed that BN-TP exhibits bright green fluorescence with an emission peak of 523 nm and FWHM of 34 nm. The OLEDs using BN-TP as an emitter show an ultrapure green emission with a peak at 528 nm and an FWHM of 36 nm and achieve an EQEmax of 35.1%. It is worth noting that the CIE color coordinates of the device are (0.26, 0.70), which basically meet the pure green requirements (0.21, 0.71) defined by the National Television System Committee (NTSC). Thus, the fusion of an aromatic ring to the B,N-framework points to a method for the development of efficient pure green emission MR-TADF emitters.
Unlike the use of multiple substituents to modify MR-TADF emitters to improve their luminescence properties, Zhang and colleagues proposed a multi-lock strategy for MR-TADF materials and introduced spiro-9,9′-bifluorene units into the MR-TADF emitter (BCz-BN) for the first time.67 They designed and synthesized two MR-TADF emitters, tCzphB-Ph and tCzphB-Fl (Fig. 6i). tCzphB-Ph and tCzphB-Fl showed similar photophysical properties with green emission at 524 and 532 nm, respectively, and the FWHM of both was 21 nm. Due to the regenerated isomeric structure and similar excited state energy levels, the PLQYs of tCzphB-Ph and tCzphB-Fl were 98% and 93%, respectively. The devices based on tCzphB-Ph and tCzphB-Fl showed high EQEmax values of 29.3% and 26.2%, respectively (Fig. 5). It is worth noting that the FHWM of the tCzphB-Ph-based device was 24 nm, and the CIE color coordinates were (0.21, 0.75), making it the purest green bottom-emitting OLED ever reported. Regrettably, both devices have severe efficiency roll-off (over 50% at 500 nit). By doping tCzphB-Ph into PHOLEDs based on classical green phosphors Ir(ppy)3, the device exhibited a reduced efficiency roll-off (EQE of 30.6% at 10000 cd m−2) and achieved an extremely high luminescence of 5.1 × 105 cd m−2. Therefore, we believe that the MR effect and multiple interlocking strategy greatly suppressed the high-frequency vibrations in the molecules, and this strategy for TADF materials facilitates the development of efficient and stable narrowband full-color organic emitters.

Currently, the purest green OLED reported is the BN-ICz-1-based top-emitting OLED (TE-OLED) prepared by Duan et al. with CIE color coordinates of (0.17, 0.78).23 The team fused MR fragments with conventional PAHs to develop two novel green MR-TADF emitters, BN-ICz-1 and BN-ICz-2 (Fig. 6j). This strategy leads to the extension of π-conjugation lengths while increasing molecular rigidity and reducing vibrational frequency, achieving a redshifted emission spectrum and suppressing its shoulder emission. In toluene, BN-ICz-1/BN-ICz-2 exhibits green emission with a λPL of 521/520 nm and an FWHM of 20/21 nm, respectively. Small ΔEST values of 0.22 eV for BN-ICz-1 and 0.18 eV for BN-ICz-1 and high PLQYs of 99.2% for BN-ICz-1 and 98.3% for BN-ICz-1 were measured in toluene. The OLEDs fabricated with BN-ICz-1 and BN-ICz-2 exhibited similar narrowband green emission with FWHM of 23 and 23 nm, λEL of 523 and 523 nm, and CIE color coordinates of (0.22, 0.74) and (0.23, 0.73), respectively. In addition, the devices also achieved high EQEs of 30.5% and 29.8% and low efficiency roll-offs of 43.6% and 12.4% at 1000 cd m−2, respectively. To further achieve an ultrapure green emission, TE-OLEDs were fabricated using BN-ICz-1. As expected, the optimized TE-OLED showed nearly BT.2020 green with CIE color coordinates of (0.17, 0.78), an emission peak at 525 nm and an FWHM of 19 nm. Furthermore, a record-high current efficiency of 220 cd A−1 was achieved for the optimized TE-OLEDs.
Inspired by these results, the team proposed another multiple fusion strategy for constructing MR-TADF emitters with narrower spectra and redshifts.68 Based on this strategy, they developed two proof-of-concept emitters, DBN-ICz and BN-DICz (Fig. 6k). As a result, both emitters gave yellowish green and yellow emission in toluene solution with λPL of 533 and 542 nm, narrow FWHM of 20 and 18 nm, small ΔEST values of 0.26 and 0.20 eV, and high PLQYs of 62 and 17%, respectively. When doped with 3,3′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (mCBP), both the emitters exhibited redshifted emission with λPL of 534 and 545 nm and broader FWHM of 32 and 23 nm, respectively. The devices fabricated with DBN-ICz and BN-DICz achieved narrowband emission with FWHMs of 23 and 27 nm and high EQEs of 31.5% and 37.4%, respectively. Notably, the devices exhibited EQEs of 17.8% and 23.6% at 1000 cd m−2 for DBN-ICz and BN-DICz, respectively. In addition, the T90 lifetimes (time to lose 10% of the initial brightness) were 87.8 h and 160.9 h at a brightness of 2000 cd m−2 for BN-DICz and DBN-ICz, respectively, demonstrating the stability of these emitters.
The para B–π–B and para N–π–N strategy proposed by Yasuda in 2020 is effective in achieving a significant redshift in the luminescence wavelength of MR-TADF emitters.25 Wang et al. pioneered the strategy of para B–π–B and para O–π–O to synthesize a novel green MR-TADF emitter, DBNO, as shown in Fig. 6l.69 Two para-B atoms in the central π nucleus instead of meta-B atoms can significantly increase the host intensity, leading to a significant redshift of the emission wavelength, while the para-alignment of the two atomic orbitals with lower energy O atoms instead of N atoms can restrict π-conjugation of the HOMO rather than the LUMO to prevent excessive redshift. Therefore, the emitter exhibits a distinct green emission with a high PLQY of 96% and a very narrow FWHM of 19 nm. DBNO-based OLEDs show narrowband green emission with a peak at 504 nm, an FWHM of 24 nm, and an EQEmax of 35.9%.
An alternative design strategy for green emitting MR-TADF materials is to dimerize an MR core. Zhang and Colman et al. used this strategy to dimerize DiKTa and synthesized DDiKTa (Fig. 6m).70 The distortion of DDikTa leads to slightly increased conjugation compared to DiKTa, resulting in a redshifted luminescence wavelength of 490 nm observed in the 9 wt% doped DPEPO film. Meanwhile, the ΔEST and PLQY of DDikTa were measured to be 0.16 eV and 72% in the film, respectively. Unfortunately, this film exhibited a wider FWHM of 61 nm, attributed to the large conformational landscape obtained at room temperature for the two DiKTa parts linked by a C–C single bond. Thus, the optimal device based on DDikTa exhibited an EQEmax of 19.0% with an EL peak at 500 nm and an FWHM of 59 nm.
Similarly, Yasuda and colleagues developed two narrowband green MR-TADF emitters, p-CzB and m-CzB (Fig. 6n), by a facile dimerization strategy.71 In a deoxygenated toluene solution, both p-CzB and m-CzB exhibited pure green emissions at 505 and 515 nm with narrow spectral FWHMs of 34 and 35 nm, respectively. The ΔEST values of p-CzB and m-CzB were determined to be 0.17 and 0.13 eV, respectively. m-CzB exhibited a higher PLQY of 90% compared to p-CzB (85%) in solution, corresponding to the stronger MR-induced HOMO–LUMO transition. In addition, the kRISC value of m-CzB is 23 × 104 s−1, which is faster than that of p-CzB (4.6 × 104 s−1). As a result, the OLEDs based on p-CzB and m-CzB showed EL peaks at 511 and 515 nm with FWHMs of 41 and 39 nm and CIE color coordinates values of (0.16, 0.66) and (0.20, 0.70), respectively. The m-CzB-based device achieved a high EQEmax of 23.5% and an EQE of 15% at 1000 cd m−2, which are better than those of the p-CzB-based device (EQEmax/1000 of 20.2%/9.3%). This work provides a new possibility for us to develop longwave MR-TADF emitters for low-efficiency rolling-off devices.
Different from the above strategies, Zhang and co-workers proposed a new molecular design strategy to fuse two MR cores by π-conjugation into an MR-TADF emitter (DBTN-2) with a highly distorted structure.72 As shown in Fig. 6o, DBTN-2 is the concept-design molecule. The emitter showed a narrowband green emission (512 nm with an FHWM of 20 nm) in toluene, a PLQY of 92% in a 2.5 wt% doped SF3-TRZ film, and a small ΔEST of 0.06 eV due to the highly distorted structure. Meanwhile, DBTN-2 exhibited a high kF of 2.7 × 108 s−1 and a kRISC of 1.7 × 105 s−1. Thus, high EQEs up to 35.2% with an emission peak at 520 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.19, 0.74) were obtained for the DBTN-2 emitter-based OLED. Such CIE color coordinates far exceed the color gamut defined by the NTSC. Moreover, the device maintains a decent EQE of 20.4% at 1000 cd m−2 due to the fast RISC process. This work represents one of the most advanced green MR-TADF and opens up new possibilities for the development of novel narrowband green emitters.
Hatakeyama and co-workers developed a novel synthetic protocol to synthesize a B,N-doped MR-TADF emitter, ω-DABNA (Fig. 6p), with five [4]helicene substructures and a highly twisted structure.73 The emitter exhibited narrowband green emission at 509 nm with an FWHM of 22 nm and a high PLQY of 87% when doped in PMMA. It is noteworthy that the ΔEST of ω-DABNA is only 0.013 eV. The green device fabricated with ω-DABNA achieved a high EQEmax of 31.1% and an extremely small efficiency roll-off (EQE of 29.4% at 1000 cd m−2, EQE of 20.1% at 10000 cd m−2) with emission at 512 nm, a FWHM of 36 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.13, 0.73). In addition, the ω-DABNA-based OLED exhibited an operational lifetime (LT80) of 292 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m−2. Thus, this strategy can be used for further development of highly efficient and stable MR-TADF emitters.


3.1.3 Orange to red MR-TADF emitters. 
Peripheral modification of the MR-skeleton with D or A units allows for fine tuning of the emission beyond the blue region. Introducing these units onto the HOMO- or LUMO-dominant carbons of the MR-core stabilizes their respective energies and lowers the bandgap, resulting in redshifted emission. By controlling the strength of the appended donor or acceptor units, the emission wavelength only can be toggled between green and yellow. To date, only two molecular designs have been reported for red MR-TADF emitters: one is a para-B–π–B and N–π–N arrangement coupled with an extended fused π-skeleton, and another is integration of MR-cores with strong electron-withdrawing rigid PAHs. Thus, further research is necessary to develop new molecular designs, expanding the scope of red MR-TADF emitters with narrow FWHM and high efficiency. This could involve exploring new D or A units, investigating the effects of different linker lengths and positions, and optimizing the structure of the MR-cores. With these developments, red MR-TADF emitters could find potential applications in fields such as OLEDs, bioimaging and sensing.
For this purpose, Yasuda et al. successfully designed and synthesized the first red MR-TADF material, BBCz-R (Fig. 8a).25 Compared to BCz-BN (Fig. 6a), the para B–π–B and para N–π–N of BBCz-R could greatly increase the acceptor and donor intensities, leading to a substantial redshift of the absorption and emission bands. Thus, the PL peak of BBCz-R was observed at 615 nm with an FWHM of 21 nm in toluene solution. Simultaneously, the emitter shows a small ΔEST of 0.19 eV and a high PLQY of 98%. The device based on BBCz-R exhibits a high EQEmax of 22% and red narrowband emission, with EL peaks at 616 nm, FWHM of 26 nm, and CIE color coordinates of (0.67, 0.33).
To meet the requirement of narrowband deep-red (DR)/near-infrared (NIR) emission, Duan et al. designed and synthesized two MR-TADF emitters, R-BN and R-TBN, with multiple linear B-phenyl-B and N-phenyl-N structures (Fig. 7 and 8b).24 Such a structure enhances the electronic coupling of those para-positioned atoms and limits the delocalized excited states of π-bonds on the phenyl ring, which narrows the energy gap. R-BN and R-TBN show deep red emission at 662 and 692 nm, and both FWHMs are 38 nm. The ΔEST values were estimated to be 0.18 eV for R-BN and 0.16 eV for R-TBN. The PLQY of both emitters in the deoxygenated toluene solution was up to 100%. The EQEmax of the R-BN- and R-TBN-based OLEDs was maintained at 25.6% and 24.7%, respectively. Both devices exhibited deep red emission at 663 nm and 686 nm for R-BN and R-TBN with an FWHM of 48 nm, corresponding to CIE color coordinates of (0.720, 0.279) and (0.722, 0.278), respectively. This work demonstrates the feasibility of designing and synthesizing efficient DR/NIR MR-TADF by constructing polycyclic heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons containing multiple B and N atoms.

 Fig. 8  (a–g) Chemical structures of emitters discussed in Section 3.1.3.24,25,74–80 
Different from the previous strategy of para B–π–B, Zhang et al. proposed a new strategy for the construction of long wavelength MR-TADF emitters.74 They fused carbazoles onto the initial DABNA framework (TCZ-F-DABNA) (Fig. 8c) to significantly shift the emission to the orange-red region. The emitter showed a narrow emission peak at 558 nm with an FWHM of 38 nm in toluene. The PLQY and ΔEST of TCZ-F-DABNA were measured to be 99% and 0.12 eV, respectively. Moreover, a high horizontal molecular orientation ratio (Θ‖) of 96% was determined, which is favorable for achieving high optical outcoupling efficiency. Thus, the best orange-red TADF OLED fabricated with 8 wt% TCZ-F-DABNA shows a very high EQE of 39.2% with λEL of 588 nm, FWHM of 61 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.54, 0.44), which is the highest efficiency among all the reported OLEDs in the orange-red region. When the doping ratio is 40 wt%, the EQEmax can still maintain a high value of 22.6%.
Almost at the same time, Yang's group proposed a promising similar approach that integrates a strong electron-donating indolophenazine building block into B/N-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.75 This approach has been shown to significantly influence the luminescence features of the resulting TADF emitters, BNIP-tBuCz, BNIP-tBuDPAC, BNIP-CzDPA and BNDIP (Fig. 8d), including their emission wavelength (544–583 nm) and FWHM (38–60 nm). The ΔEST values are 0.13, 0.11, 0.12, and 0.09 eV for BNIP-tBuCz, BNIP-tBuDPAC, BNIP-CzDPA and BNDIP, respectively, when doped in 1,3-dihydro-1,1-dimethyl-3-(3-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)phenyl)indeno-[2,1-b]carbazole (DMIC-TRZ) films with 1 wt% doping concentration. The four films exhibit a high PLQY of 96% for BNIP-tBuCz, 95% for BNIP-tBuDPAC, 95% for BNIP-CzDPA and 96% for BNDIP, respectively. In OLEDs, BNIP-tBuCz exhibits an EL peak at 566 nm, CIE color coordinates of (0.48, 0.51) and an EQEmax of 32.8%; BNIP-tBuDPAC exhibits an EL peak of 554 nm, CIE color coordinates of (0.41, 0.56) and an EQEmax of 39.4%; BNIP-CzDPA exhibits an EL peak at 584 nm, CIE color coordinates of (0.54, 0.45) and an EQEmax of 32.8%; and BNDIP exhibits an EL peak of 582 nm, CIE color coordinates of (0.53, 0.47) and an EQEmax of 34.1%, respectively. Out of the four TADF emitters, BNDIP demonstrated remarkable device stability with a lifetime (LT99: time to lose 1% of initial brightness) of over 110 hours at an initial brightness of 3000 cd m−2. These advancements suggest that the development of high-performance MR-TADF emitters in the long-wavelength range is possible and holds great potential for next-generation HD displays.
Recently, Duan and co-workers reported a molecular design strategy for creating pure-red MR-TADF emitters using conjugate charge transfer.76 This strategy enhances the target molecule's π-conjugation degree and charge-transfer properties while maintaining the basic features of multiple resonance. The resulting emitter, PPZ-BN (Fig. 8e), emits narrow pure-red at 613 nm with an FWHM of 48 nm. In addition to this, the emitter has a small ΔEST of 0.25 eV and a high PLQY of 82%. The OLEDs based on PPZ-BN exhibited EQEmax of 26.9%, a peak at 613 nm, a small FWHM of 55 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.66, 0.34). The sensitized emission mechanism plays a crucial role in achieving these high performances, as it enhances the radiative consumption of excitons. Thus, the device also shows high EQE values of 26% and 22.9% at 1000 and 5000 cd m−2, respectively, showing very low efficiency roll-off. It is noteworthy that the lifetimes of the device (LT99) more than 43 h at an initial brightness of 10000 cd m−2. This advancement could pave the way for further applications of red MR-TADF emitters.
To date, efficient TADF materials in the red region are rare due to the energy gap law. To expand the variety of efficient red MR-TADF materials, Yang et al. used the design strategy of para B–π–B, para N–π–N and para O–π–O to synthesize three red MR-TADF emitters, BNO1-BNO3 (Fig. 8f).77 These emitters exhibited red emission in the range of 605–616 nm with a FWHM of 32–33 nm in toluene solutions. In addition, they also showed high PLQY, fast kr and a high horizontal molecular orientation ratio (Θ‖). Hence, for OLEDs based on BNO1, BNO2 and BNO3 with DMIC-TRZ as the host material, their EQEmax values were 14.9%, 12.0% and 15.1%, respectively. However, these devices suffered from severe efficiency degradation due to the long fluorescence lifetime of the emitters and the inefficient direct energy transfer from the host to the guest. On doping with iridium(III) bis(4-phenylthieno[3,2-c]pyridinato-N,C2′)acetylacetonate (PO-01) as a sensitizer, high EQEmax values of 35.7%, 34.2% and 36.1% were observed for BNO1-, BNO2- and BNO3-based OLEDs, respectively. These three OLEDs exhibited narrow emission at 610, 618 and 625 nm with FWHM/CIE color coordinates values of 39 nm/(0.64, 0.34), 39 nm/(0.65, 0.35) and 40 nm/(0.66, 0.34) and ultrahigh brightness in excess of 105 cd m−2, respectively. In particular, the BNO3-based device shows an ultralow efficiency roll-off. The EQEs were 32.1%, 28.6% and 25.1% when the brightness was 1000, 10000 and 50000 cd m−2, respectively. This work has greatly contributed to the development of red MR-TADF emitters.
The application of FMOE is important for the exploration of MR-TADF materials in the longer wavelength range. However, it inevitably broadens the emission band because of the increased structural relaxation associated with the distorted D–A structure. Therefore, You and Bin et al. proposed a cyano (–CN) functionalization strategy to achieve redshifted emission while maintaining good color purity of the MR-TADF backbone.78CNCz-BNCz was prepared by introducing a –CN group on the yellow MR-TADF backbone (Fig. 8g). Compared to BBCz-Y, the emission wavelength of CNCz-BNCz is redshifted by 32 nm, and the FWHM remains unchanged. The ΔEST value of CNCz-BNCz is 0.18 eV in toluene, and the PLQY reaches 96% in the doped CBP film. Device A utilizing the host–guest system showed a maximum EQE of 23.0% while suffering significant efficiency roll-off. Device B with an additional sensitizer DACT-II showed slightly improved efficiency roll-off. Therefore, device C based on the TADF host 32aICTRZ achieved a record-breaking EQEmax of 33.7% by improving the up-conversion process of the triplet exciton. This device exhibits orange-red emission with a λEL of 583 nm and a FWHM of 49 nm. In addition, the efficiency roll-off is greatly improved with EQEs of 27.7% and 16.4% at 100 cd m−2 and 1000 cd m−2, respectively. This work not only provides a new avenue for the future development of full-color MR-TADF materials but also demonstrates the great potential of the TADF sensitization mechanism for high-performance devices.
In addition, Zhang's group introduced three compounds, modified versions of the TAOT core with different donor groups located para to the nitrogen atoms.79 The effect of the peripheral donor type on the performance of MR-TADF was investigated: mBDPA-TAOT (donor is bis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)amine, mBDPA), pBDPA-TAOT (donor is bis(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)amine, pBDPA), and DMAC-TOAT (donor is 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine, DMAC) (Fig. 8h). The three donors exhibited similar strong electron-donating abilities,h inducing similar redshifts in their emission spectra, while they exhibited significant differences in terms of efficiency and color purity. Although DMAC-TOAT, with a highly twisted framework, exhibited an extremely small ΔEST of 0.08 eV and an evidently faster kRISC, it lost the characteristics of MR compounds, such as a lower PLQY of 15% and a broad FWHM of 104 nm. mBDPA-TAOT and pBDPA-TAOT with mild twists exhibited obvious hybridization of MR and ICT featured transitions. Therefore, their PLQYs were obviously improved to 73% and 57%, respectively. More importantly, they showed narrow FWHMs of 37 and 48 nm, respectively. The OLEDs based on mBDPA-TAOT and pBDPA-TAOT exhibited red EL emission with peaks at 600 and 624 nm, narrow FWHMs of 45 and 62 nm, and EQEmax values of 17.3% and 11.3%, respectively.
By introducing an electron donor or an electron acceptor into the MR core, the emission wavelength of the materials can be redshifted, and thus, a series of MR-TADF materials with green to orange-red can be effectively constructed. To further enrich the types of pure red MR-TADF materials, Wang et al. proposed a synergistic strategy by introducing auxiliary electron donor and acceptor units into the single MR backbone.80 Based on this idea, they successfully developed a new type of pure red MR-TADF emitter (BN-R, EL = 624 nm, FWHM = 46 nm) and a yellow emitter (BN-Y, EL = 567 nm, FWHM = 34 nm) (Fig. 8i) that lacks an electron acceptor. The two emitters showed small ΔEST values of 0.11 and 0.12 eV and high PLQYs of 94% and 95% in toluene solution, respectively. In addition, this group prepared a doped film with a 1 wt% doping concentration of NPB:DMFBD-TRZ = 2:1 cohost to investigate the photophysical properties of BN-R in the solid state. The film showed a narrowband pure red emission with a wavelength of 620 nm and FWHM of 49 nm. In addition, τp, τd and kRISC were 17.8 ns, 71.8 μs and 1.1 × 104 s−1, respectively. BN-R still showed a high PLQY of 90.1%. Therefore, the pure red OLEDs prepared by a solution-process based on BN-R exhibited excellent electroluminescent performance. The EQEmax of the device was 22%, the emission wavelength was 617 nm, the FWHM was 47 nm, and the CIE color coordinates were (0.654, 0.344). Unfortunately, it has a relatively serious efficiency roll-off, which depends on the relatively small kRISC and a long τd. When they used sensitization technology, there was no obvious change in the luminous spectrum and EQEmax, and the efficiency roll-off was greatly improved. The device lifetime (LT50) at an initial brightness of 1000 cd m−2 increased from 113.5 h to 1088.5 h, which is the highest record for a solution based on MR-TADF materials to treat red OLED devices. This work provides a new idea for designing and developing MR-TADF materials with high efficiency and high color purity.

3.2. Performance of devices
The MR-TADF emitters reported thus far all have a large kr (108 s−1) and possess high PLQY.18,28,29 However, the kRISC values of these materials (∼104 s−1) are much smaller than those of conventional D–A type TADF emitters (>105 s−1).29 Such a slow up-conversion rate leads to severe efficiency roll-off in the device.27,30 To address this problem, researchers have developed three ways to improve device efficiency roll-off: (1) introducing donors or acceptors to MR cores to enhance the CT states of molecules, thus reducing their ΔEST and obtaining a faster RISC process; (2) adding heavy atoms, such as sulfur and selenium atoms, to MR cores to increase kRISC through the heavy atom effect; and (3) facilitating energy transfer in devices using sensitization technology.

3.2.1 Introducing donors or acceptors. 
Most MR-TADF materials suffer from a low RISC process on the order of 104 s−1, which leads to insufficient TADF characteristics both in oxygen-free solvents and polymer films. However, the TADF characteristics can be substantially enhanced when these materials are doped into suitable hosts. Recently, Zhu and Chou et al. successfully revealed the luminescence mechanism of multiple resonance effect-induced thermal activation delayed fluorescence materials.81 They found that the host and guest can interact with each other in doped films, enhancing the TADF properties of MR materials. Furthermore, the authors proposed a mechanism similar to exciton complexes, which could highlight the TADF properties of MR materials. In addition, QAO, QPO and QP3O also exhibited similar properties (Fig. 10a). The enhanced TADF mechanism can not only improve the performance of devices based on MR-TADF materials but also be extended to any fluorescent dye with a small ΔEST.
To achieve efficient MR-TADF emitters, Geng et al. designed compounds 1–4 based on the reported MR-TADF molecules (DABNA-1 and DABNA-2) (Fig. 10b).82 Because they have the same rigid polycyclic aromatic backbone, the introduction of substituents has no significant effect on their electronic properties, and the geometrical changes between S0 and S1 are minimal. Therefore, the shapes of the absorption spectra of 1–4 are very similar. Additionally, the effect of a substituent on the PL wavelength is small, and 1–4 retain blue emission at 454–466 nm. It is noteworthy that 1–4 possess smaller ΔEST values and larger kr and f than DABNA-1. In addition, the kr value (2.46 × 108 s−1) of 3 is larger than that (2.11 × 108 s−1) of 1. This means that the introduction of rigid groups at the periphery of the MR core can be more effective in improving kr. Therefore, the addition of aromatic amine derivatives is an effective way to improve the performance of MR-TADF materials without changing the emission wavelength.
Based on the strategy of Hatakeyama et al., Liang and co-workers introduced a carbazole unit at the para-position of the B atom, achieving an MR-TADF material TBN-TPA (Fig. 10c).83TBN-TPA showed a blue emission peak at 470 nm with a small FWHM of 26 nm in toluene. Due to the large oscillator strength (f = 0.3324), high PLQY (97.48%) and short delayed lifetime (51.02 μs), the MR-TADF-OLED exhibits an outstanding EQE up to 32.1% with an FWHM of 27 nm and low efficiency roll-off. Moreover, this material can also be used as a host for the phosphorescent emitter Ir(tfmphqz)2(tpip), and the PhOLED also shows high performance with a maximum EQE up to 22.2%.
Although the devices based on ν-DABNA achieve a high EQE, they still have a CIE color coordinates y value over 0.10. Therefore, Kwon et al. reported three new blue MR-TADF molecules, m-ν-DABNA, 4F-ν-DABNA and 4F-m-ν-DABNA, based on the ν-DABNA skeleton (Fig. 10d).84 This functionalization of methyl and fluorine leads to band-gap enhancement compared to that of ν-DABNA. Furthermore, m-ν-DABNA, 4F-ν-DABNA and 4F-m-ν-DABNA show small ΔEST values of 0.07, 0.05 and 0.07 eV and narrow blue emissions at 464, 457 and 455 nm with an identical FWHM of 14 nm, respectively. The PLQYs/delayed decay lifetimes are 90.5%/3.09 μs, 90.2%/3.12 μs and 88.9%/3.19 μs for m-ν-DABNA, 4F-ν-DABNA and 4F-m-ν-DABNA, respectively. Therefore, the fabricated devices based on m-ν-DABNA, 4F-ν-DABNA and 4F-m-ν-DABNA exhibit 471, 464 and 461 nm EL emissions with a narrow FWHM of 18 nm and high maximum EQEs of 36.2, 35.8 and 33.7%, respectively. In particular, 4F-ν-DABNA and 4F-m-ν-DABNA achieve CIE color coordinates of (0.13, 0.08) and (0.13, 0.06), respectively.
Hatakeyama et al. also designed a green MR-TADF material, ν-DABNA-CN-Me (Fig. 10e), derived from the introduction of cyano groups into ν-DABNA.85 The emitter exhibited a narrow PL peak at 496 nm with an FWHM of 17 nm in toluene solution. Furthermore, ν-DABNA-CN-Me showed a high PLQY of 86% and a fast kRISC of 1.0 × 105 s−1. OLEDs were fabricated with 0.5 wt% ν-DABNA-CN-Me in a DOBNA-Ph host. As a result, the device exhibited a high EQEmax of 31.9% and an EL peak at 504 nm with an FWHM of 23 nm. Moreover, the efficiency roll-off was low, and the EQE remained 28.5% even at 1000 cd m−2.
Currently, the planar and rigid π-conjugated structure of most MR-TADF molecules induces severe aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) and spectral broadening in the solid state. Therefore, based on the B–N skeleton, Lu et al. designed and synthesized four novel emitters: TW-BN, TPh-BN, pCz-BN, and mCz-BN (Fig. 10f).86 The four emitters exhibited blue-green emissions at 486, 492, 491, and 495 nm with narrow FWHMs of 20, 21, 21 and 21 nm, respectively. In addition, the PLQYs of the doped films (3 wt% doped in the mCBP host) were 88–95%, and the ΔEST values of these materials were 0.09–0.15 eV. Thus, the maximum EQEs of TW-BN-, TPh-BN-, pCz-BN-, and mCz-BN-based devices without a sensitizer were obtained to be as high as 27.8%, 28.9%, 27.2%, and 25.9%, respectively. Moreover, all the EL narrowband spectra are structureless with peaks at 488–496 nm and FWHMs of 26–31 nm. Excitingly, when these emitters are incorporated at a concentration of 6 wt% in the emitting layer of the devices, the EQEmax values remain at high levels (22.9–26.4%), and the emission bands exhibit a slight redshift and broadening.
MR-TADF materials can effectively suppress the structural relaxation of the molecular excited states to achieve narrowband emission. Additionally, the FWHM and vibration coupling of the emitters were inextricably linked. Therefore, Ma et al. introduced appropriate peripheral moieties in the MR core to further narrow the FWHM by suppressing the vibrational coupling strength (Λ).87 Based on the QAO framework, they designed and synthesized four symmetric materials, QA-PF, QA-PCN, QA-PMO, and QA-PCZ (Fig. 10h). The λFL values of these emitters in toluene were 465, 462, 475, and 471 nm, respectively. In addition, the excited states of these materials are HLCT states, which is favorable for obtaining high PLQYs. The PLQYs of the doped films are 66–89%, and the ΔEST values of these materials are 0.18–0.25 eV. The maximum EQEs of the QA-PF-, QA-PCN-, QA-PMO-, and QA-PCZ-based devices were as high as 16.8%, 16.9%, 15.0%, and 17.5%, respectively. All the EL spectra are structureless with peaks at 474, 473, 484, and 482 nm. It is worth noting that all the devices exhibited narrowband spectra with FWHM ≤ 30 nm. As a result, enhancing the low-frequency vibrational coupling and reducing the contribution of high-frequency modes are feasible and effective strategies to obtain narrowband emitters for high-purity color displays.
Additionally, You and colleagues proposed a new strategy, called “space-confined donor–acceptor (SCDA)”, to accelerate the RISC process of MR-TADF emitters. Two emitters, TRZCzPh-BNCz and TRZTPh-BNCz (Fig. 9 and 10g), were developed based on this strategy.88TRZCzPh-BNCz and TRZTPh-BNCz exhibited λPL values of 514 and 513 nm with narrow FWHMs of 34 and 29 nm, respectively. Both emitters achieved ΔEST values as small as 0.13 eV and 0.11 eV and PLQY values as high as 93.0% and 94.7%. The τd of TRZCzPh-BNCz (0.14 μs) was relatively shorter than that of TRZTPh-BNCz (0.24 μs) in the 3 wt% doped N,N-dicarbazolyl-4,4′-biphenyl (CBP) film, consistent with the high kRISC values of TRZCzPh-BNCz (2.13 × 106 s−1) and TRZTPh-BNCz (1.55 × 106 s−1). The OLED performance of these compounds is initially tested in a CBP host. The emitters TRZCzPh-BNCz and TRZTPh-BNCz exhibit green emission with λEL/CIE color coordinates of 513/(0.17, 068) and 513/(0.16, 070) nm and FWHM of 37 and 33 nm, respectively, and the EQEmax values of TRZCzPh-BNCz and TRZTPh-BNCz were 32.5% and 31.4%, respectively. Notably, the efficiency roll-off of these two conventional devices was very small, with EQEs of 22.9% and 23.1% at 1000 cd m−2, respectively. This work provides a valuable molecular design strategy for developing high-performance and low-efficiency roll-off MR-TADF emitters.

Recently, Zheng et al. proposed a new idea to achieve a small ΔEST by fusing two MR cores together.89 Based on this strategy, the team synthesized two green MR-TADF emitters, VTCzBN and TCz-VTCzBN (Fig. 10i). TD-DFT calculations showed large SOC values of 0.154 and 0.286 cm−1 between S1 and T1, benefiting from the efficient separation of the FOM of these two molecules. The PLQYs/kRISC values are 98%/1.0 × 106 s−1 and 98%/0.9 × 106 s−1 for VTCzBN and TCz-VTCzBN, respectively. The devices fabricated with VTCzBN and TCz-VTCzBN exhibited narrowband emission at 499 and 524 nm with FWHMs of 38 and 37 nm, respectively, and EQEmax values of 31.7 and 32.2%.
To reduce the efficiency roll-offs of MR-TADF OLEDs, Wang et al. systematically synthesized a series of MR-TADF, DCzB, DtCzB, Tip-DtCzB and tDPA-DtCzB (Fig. 10j).90 Incorporating sterically hindered groups at the periphery of the primitive MR core facilitated the weakening of contact between adjacent emitters, thereby reducing the occurrence of bimolecular events involving triplet excitons. The emitters showed sky-blue PL/narrow FWHM of 474/24 nm for DCzB, 481/22 nm for DtCzB, 477/19 nm for Tip-DtCzB and 470/21 nm for tDPA-DtCzB. They also displayed small ΔEST values of 0.11–0.13 eV and high PLQYs of 81–96%. The kRISCs of DCzB, DtCzB and Tip-DtCzB were 0.50 × 104, 0.74 × 104 and 0.92 × 104 s−1, respectively, while tDPA-DtCzB's kRISC was 2.45 × 104 s−1 because of its relatively stronger CT features. Consequently, the OLEDs fabricated with DCzB, DtCzB, Tip-DtCzB and tDPA-DtCzB achieved high EQEmax values of 20.2%, 23.2%, 28.9% and 25.0%, sky-blue emission at 480, 488, 484 and 480 nm with narrow FWHM of 30, 27, 25 and 27 nm, and CIE color coordinates of (0.11, 0.27). (0.10, 0.35), (0.10, 0.29), and (0.11, 0.23), respectively. In addition, tDPA-DtCzB exhibited the smallest efficiency roll-off (34% at 100 cd m−2) among the four devices. To further reduce the efficiency roll-off of the device, sensitized devices were prepared based on tDPA-DtCzB to achieve a higher EQEmax of 31.0% and a smaller efficiency roll-off of 5.8%, with an EQE of 29.2% maintained at 100 cd m−2.
In a similar vein, Kim et al. designed and synthesized a deep-blue MR-TADF emitter, pBP-DABNA-Me (Fig. 10k), to effectively suppress intermolecular interactions.22 Compared to DABNA-1, pBP-DABNA-Me has a highly twisted structure, which is attributed to the π–π repulsion between the biphenyl units and the steric hindrance between ortho-xylyl groups. As expected from the molecular design, pBP-DABNA-Me exhibits deep-blue emission at 462 nm with a narrow FWHM of 22 nm and a small ΔEST of 0.176 eV, similar to DABNA-1. Notably, pBP-DABNA-Me shows a higher PLQY of 98%, a faster kRISC of 6.85 × 105 s−1 and a shorter τd of 53 μs than DABNA-1 because biphenyl substitutions consequently make RISC faster by activating the second-order spin-vibronic coupling mechanism among S1, T1, and local triplet states in the emitter. As a result, the best device based on 5 wt% pBP-DABNA-Me without a sensitizer exhibits a narrow emission (FWHM = 23 nm) band at a λEL of 464 nm with CIE color coordinates of (0.132, 0.092) and a high EQEmax of 23.4%. With an increase in the doping concentrations of the emitter, the performance of other devices remains basically unchanged. Even so, the EQE for the 100 wt% emitter is 10.4%. The hyperfluorescent (HF) OLED presented an EQEmax of 30.1% with an FWHM of 22 nm at 462 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.132, 0.109). The molecular design strategy of this work contributes to the development of efficient deep-blue MR-TADF OLEDs with high doping concentrations or nondoped OLEDs.


3.2.2 Adding heavy atoms. 
MR-TADF materials have been developed considerably since Hatakeyama designed and synthesized the first MR-TADF material. In the study of conventional CT-type TADF emitters, it has been found that the addition of heavy atoms can enhance the SOC (such as O, S, and Se).62,91 Therefore, Hatakeyama et al. designed an MR-TADF material OAB-ABP-1 with an extended π-backbone and bulky substituents (Fig. 12a).92 The fluorescence peak of OAB-ABP-1 in the 1 wt% PMMA film is observed at 506 nm with a small FWHM of 34 nm. Moreover, the compound possesses a high PLQY of 90% and a small ΔEST of 0.12 eV. Therefore, the OAB-ABP-1-based device emits pure green color at 505 nm with an FWHM of 33 nm, corresponding to CIE color coordinates of (0.12, 0.63). The device exhibited a maximum EQE of 21.8%, and it is noteworthy that the device showed a small efficiency roll-off with an EQE of 17.4% at 1000 cd m−2. This was the first solution-processed OLED with superior color purity and high efficiency.

Axisymmetric and centrosymmetric configurations limit the development of MR-TADF materials. Therefore, Lee et al. pioneered the development of asymmetric blue MR-TADF emitters B-O-dpa, B-O-Cz, B-O-dmAc and B-O-dpAc (Fig. 12b).93 The weak electron-donating strength of the oxygen atom leads to a blueshift of the spectra. All four emitters displayed deep-blue emission at 433–463 nm with a narrow FWHM of 27–38 nm in toluene. The corresponding 10 wt% doped films showed high PLQYs of 86%, 94%, 91%, and 94%, respectively. In devices, B-O-Cz/B-O-dmAc/B-O-dpAc exhibited a sky blue EL peak of 481/475/473 nm, CIE color coordinates of (0.13, 0.22)/(0.12, 0.21)/(0.12, 0.20) and EQEmax of 13.4%/16.2%/17.0%, respectively. In particular, B-Odpa showed a deep-blue EL peak at 443 nm, a small FWHM at 32 nm, a CIE color coordinates of (0.15, 0.05) and an EQEmax value of 16.3%. However, the low brightness of these devices (less than 1000 cd m−2) hinders their further commercialization. To improve device performance, Yang et al. fabricated a sensitize-assisted TADF-OLED based on B-O-dpAc, and the device showed an EQEmax of 29.6%.94
The extension of π-conjugation of MR-TADF compounds causes an EL redshift, which contradicts the requirements defined by NTSC (0.14, 0.08). Hatakeyama et al. synthesized MR-TADF materials v-DABNA-O and v-DABNA-O-Me by using an oxygen atom instead of a nitrogen atom (Fig. 12c).30 Due to the low orbital energy of the oxygen atom, the HOMO energy level is reduced, and the emission wavelength is blueshifted. The fluorescence spectrum of v-DABNA-O-Me showed a deep-blue emission band at 464 nm with an FWHM of 24 nm in the doped PMMA film. A small ΔEST of 0.29 eV and a high PLQY of 90% are achieved simultaneously. The v-DABNA-O-Me-based device exhibited pure blue emission at 465 nm with an FWHM of 23 nm and corresponding CIE color coordinates of (0.13, 0.10). Furthermore, a high EQE of 29.5% and an extremely small efficiency roll-off of 2.6% at 1000 cd m−2 were achieved in the device. The strategy of incorporating oxygen atoms to induce a spectral blueshift paves the way for the further refinement and development of deep-blue or near-UV MR-TADF materials.
Recently, Yasuda et al. reported three blue emitters, BOBO-Z, BOBS-Z and BSBS-Z (Fig. 12d), which were an unprecedented report of ultra-pure blue MR-TADF emitters and one of the few attempts to introduce sulfur atoms into MR-TADF emitters.95 Compared to the representative pure blue MR-TADF emitter ν-DABNA, the prepared fluorophore solutions showed a significant blueshift in emission peaks for BOBO-Z (441 nm), BOBS-Z (453 nm) and BSBS-Z (460 nm), with narrow FWHMs of 15, 21 and 20 nm, respectively. Additionally, sulfur-doped BOBS-Z (94%) and BSBS-Z (93%) exhibited higher PLQYs compared to oxygen-doped BOBO-Z (76%). The devices based on BOBO-Z, BOBS-Z, and BSBS-Z realized narrowband blue emission with FWHMs of 18, 23 and 22 nm, λEL of 445, 456 and 463 nm, and CIE color coordinates of (0.15, 0.04), (0.14, 0.06) and (0.13, 0.08), respectively. In addition, the devices also achieved high EQEmax values of 9.8%, 24.0 and 24.0%, respectively.
To expand the variety of MR-TADF materials, Yasuda and colleagues investigated a ternary B/N/S-doped MR system and designed a fused nonacyclic molecule BSBS-N1 (Fig. 12e).96 The addition of two sulfur atoms in BSBS-N1 not only induces the MR effect but also takes advantage of the heavy atom effect to promote RISC. BSBS-N1-doped mCBP films showed sky-blue emission at 478 nm with an FWHM of 24 nm. Moreover, BSBS-N1 exhibited a small ΔEST of 0.14 eV and a high PLQY of 89% in the doped film. More importantly, BSBS-N1 showed a high kRISC of 1.9 × 106 s−1, which is equivalent to that of CT-type TADF emitters. As a result, the OLED based on BSBS-N1 exhibited a maximum EQE of 21.0% and low efficiency roll-off.
Yang et al. proposed a new strategy to improve the performance of MR-TADF emitters by fusing nonmetallic heavy atoms into a B,N-based framework to accelerate the RISC process.972PXZBN and 2PTZBN were developed by rigidifying the DABNA-1 backbone with oxygen and sulfur atoms (Fig. 12f). 2PXZBN and 2PTZBN showed λFL values of 504 and 510 nm and ΔEST values of 0.19 and 0.15 eV, respectively. Notably, the kRISC values of 2PXZBN and 2PTZBN were 1.03 × 105 s−1 and 2.76 × 105 s−1, respectively, which are much higher than those of most MR-TADF emitters. Although their EL spectra are similar, they show quite significant differences in device efficiency of 17.7% for 2PXZBN and 25.5% for 2PTZBN. Moreover, the 2PTZBN-based device significantly mitigates the efficiency roll-off with an EQE of 17.2% at 1000 cd m−2 due to the fast up-conversion process. Therefore, the heavy atom effect strategy is a promising approach for developing high-performance MR-TADF emitters.
Recently, Zheng et al. reported two green TADF emitters, TPXZBN and DPXZCZBN (Fig. 12g), by incorporating a skeleton of phenoxazine units as the MR core and amplification at the para-position of the boron atom using different donors (phenoxazine and tCz).98 Both emitters showed green emission at 502 and 500 nm with narrow FWHMs of 33 and 32 nm, respectively. Moreover, the ΔEST values of TPXZBN and DPXZCZBN were 0.13 and 0.16 eV, respectively. TPXZBN and DPXZCZBN also showed high PLQY values of 99% and 94% in 5 wt%-doped films. Therefore, the OLEDs fabricated with TPXZBN and DPXZCZBN as dopants showed narrowband emission with FWHMs of 37 and 36 nm and achieved EQEmax values of 21.3 and 19.8%, respectively. Notably, both devices exhibited small efficiency roll-off with EQEs of 17.4% and 19.6% at 1000 cd cm−2, respectively.
Two emitters, DBON and DBSN (Fig. 12h), based on O and S atoms were designed and synthesized by Zheng et al.27DBON and DBSN exhibited spectra peaking at 505 and 553 nm with FWHMs of 20 and 28 nm in toluene solution, respectively, and a high PLQY of up to 98% in the doped films. Notably, the DBSN emitter incorporated with S atoms showed a higher kRISC of 1.9 × 105 s−1 in the doped films due to the reduced ΔEST (0.11 eV) and stronger SOC. Significantly, OLEDs based on both emitters showed EQEmax values up to 26.7% and 21.8% with a low efficiency roll-off, maintaining an EQE of 20.2% and 20.6% at 100 cd cm−2, respectively.
To further improve the up-conversion rate, Yasuda et al. introduced Se atoms into MR-TADF molecules and realized ultrafast rate RISC. They developed three blue MR-TADF emitters, namely, CzBO, CzBS and CzBSe (Fig. 12i).99 The basic photophysical properties of these three emitters are not very different. However, the kRISC value of CzBSe, which contains Se atoms, is as high as 1.8 × 108 s−1, which is three or four orders of magnitude larger than those of CzBO (0.9 × 104 s−1) and CzBS (2.2 × 105 s−1). Therefore, the device based on CzBSe exhibited the best EL performance with a high EQEmax of 23.9% and retained an efficiency of 20.0%, even at 1000 cd cm−2. This strategy is effective in improving the kRISC of MR-TADF emitters and improving the efficiency roll-off of OLEDs. On this basis, Zhang et al. synthesized BNCzPXZ and BNCzPTZ (Fig. 12j), and Yang et al. synthesized BN-Se (Fig. 12k) by replacing carbazole with 3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazole.100,101 Similarly, the best performance was obtained for the B,N-Se-based OLEDs with a narrowband emission peak at 506 nm, an FWHM of 45 nm, CIE color coordinates of (0.15, 0.62) and EQEmax of 32.6%. In particular, the device exhibited an ultralow efficiency roll-off with EQE values remaining as high as 32.2% and 24.0% at 1000 and 10000 cd m−2, respectively.
In this context, Yang's group reported two new MR-TADF, BNSSe and BNSeSe, (Fig. 12l) in which the S atoms based on 2PTZBN were replaced with Se atoms.102 In toluene, both emitters showed narrow, green emission similar to that of 2PTZBN (λPL = 510 nm, FWHM = 39 nm), BNSSe (λPL = 505 nm, FWHM = 39 nm) and BNSeSe (λPL = 502 nm, FWHM = 38 nm). Although the ΔEST values were 0.12 and 0.14 eV for BNSSe and BNSeSe, respectively, the heavy-atom effect of the Se atom translated into a fast kRISC (short τd) of 0.60 × 106 s−1 (12.7 μs) and 2.0 × 106 s−1 (9.9 μs), respectively, which are much better than those of the parent core 2PTZBN (2.76 × 105 s−1 and 20.7 μs). Due to the similar PLQYs of 99% and 100%, the OLEDs with both emitters showed similar efficiencies, EQEmax of 35.7% for BNSSe and of 35.7% for BNSeSe. The BNSSe-based OLED exhibited a λEL of 512 nm (FWHM = 50 nm) with CIE color coordinates of (0.22, 0.66), and the BNSeSe-based OLED showed a similar λEL of 512 nm (FWHM = 48 nm) and CIE color coordinates of (0.19, 0.66). BNSSe- and BNSe-based devices achieved a maximum brightness of 113881 and 108188 cd m−2, respectively. Furthermore, the corresponding BNSeSe-sensitized device (emitter: DtCzB-DPTRZ) exhibited a narrower emission at 531 nm with an FWHM of 31 nm, CIE color coordinates of (0.29, 0.68), and a high EQE of 39.6%, which was the first example of employing an MR-TADF sensitizer for OLEDs. The device maintained an efficiency of 34.5% at 1000 cd m−2 and 24.3% at 10000 cd m−2.


3.2.3 Host–guest system. 
The efficiency of the energy transfer between the host and guest is one of the most important factors in determining the performance of devices. Kwon et al. designed another ν-DABNA-based blue-emitting MR-TADF material, t-Bu-ν-DABNA (Fig. 14a).103 The emitter exhibited a narrow blue PL peak at 467 nm with an FWHM of 14 nm in toluene solution, and the ΔEST was 0.04 eV. Compared to ν-DABNA, 5 wt% t-Bu-ν-DABNA doped in the DBFPO host showed an enhanced PLQY value of 91.9% due to the incorporation of the tert-butyl moiety. A hyperfluorescent (HF) device was fabricated with a 30 wt% TADF sensitizer (mMDBA-DI) and 1 wt% t-Bu-ν-DABNA in a DBFPO host. The HF-OLED shows a high EQEmax of 39.1% (Lambertian assumption) and a narrow EL spectrum at 505 nm with an FWHM of 33 nm. Moreover, the pMDBA-DI-based HF-OLED exhibits a long device lifetime (LT50) of 440 h at 1000 cd m−2. Therefore, the TADF sensitization technology will provide an important way to obtain efficient and stable pure blue HF-OLED devices.
Sensitization strategies could solve the efficiency roll-off of MR devices but cannot determine the concentration-induced spectral quenching and spreading. Recently, Duan's team reported a novel MR-TADF strategy with three-dimensional wrapping characteristics to solve these challenges.104 Two sterically wrapped MR-TADF emitters, S-Cz-BN and D-Cz-BN, were synthesized by sandwiching the MR core between the large site-resistant substituents (Fig. 14b). The effect of the introduction of the tCz unit on the FMO distribution is negligible, except for the slightly prolonged LUMO level on the phenyl linker. S-Cz-BN and D-Cz-BN displayed the same emission peak at 490 nm with similar FWHMs of 23 and 22 nm, respectively. Moreover, the spectral broadening, exciton quenching, and DET energy transfer rate of the sensitized systems were effectively suppressed with increasing doping concentrations. The PLQY was over 84% over a wide concentration range of 1–30 wt%, and the FWHM was less than 34 nm. Similar results were achieved for the corresponding EL devices. In particular, the TADF-sensitized TADF (TST) OLEDs of double-sided sterically coated D-Cz-BN achieved an ultrahigh EQE of 36.3–37.2% and a low efficiency roll-off (7.8–28.9%) in the doping range of 1–20 wt%. In comparison, the S-Cz-BN devices exhibit slightly worse EQEs of 28.8–30.5%. Furthermore, they also prepared nondoped devices of these materials. The D-Cz-BN-based device exhibited an EQE of 14.8% and a narrow FWHM of only 21 nm, which were significantly better than those of S-Cz-BN (EQEmax = 12.8%, FWHM = 40 nm). More importantly, the FWHM of this device is the narrowest emission of all nondoped OLEDs to date.
Similarly, Yang's group designed and synthesized two novel emitters, BN-CP1 and BN-CP2, with high efficiency, narrow FWHM and concentration resistance (Fig. 14c).105BN-CP1 and BN-CP2 showed similar monomeric photophysical properties but exhibited entirely different aggregation performances. Both emitters exhibited the same narrow emission at 490 nm with an FWHM of 23 nm. In the neat film, a sharp PL emission at 502 nm, an FWHM of 28 nm, and a PLQY of 40% were observed in BN-CP-1. Conversely, BN-CP2 maintained a further redshift of the PL band at 521 nm, featuring a long tail toward 700 nm, and the PLQY was only 25%. With BN-CP1, the devices showed a remarkable EQEmax of 33.3–40.0% in the dopant concentration range of 1–30 wt% and a λEL of 493–496 nm with an FWHM of 25 nm. For devices with BN-CP2 as an emitter, the EQEmax decreases and the emission redshifts and FWHM becomes wider as the dopant concentration increases. Hence, sandwiching the MR core between two large site-resistant substituents could effectively suppress concentration-induced luminescence quenching and spectral broadening. These results broaden the process window of dye concentration during vapor deposition and promote the practical application of MR devices.
Unlike Duan and Yang et al., who used multiple substituents to modify MR-TADF emitters to improve their luminescence properties, Jiang and his colleagues introduced spiro-9,9′-bifluorene (SBF) units into the MR-TADF emitter (BNCz) for the first time.106 They designed and synthesized two new MR-TADF emitters, SF1BN (BNCz was appended to the C1 site of SBF) and SF3BN (BNCz was appended to the C3 site of SBF) (Fig. 14d). With this design, SF1BN and SF3BN showed similar photophysical properties, and the two emitters exhibited bluish-green emission at 493 nm and FWHMs of 23 and 25 nm, respectively. Due to the regenerated isomeric structure and similar excited state energy levels, the PLQYs of SF1BN and SF3BN were 93% and 90%, respectively. With SF1BN and SF3BN, the devices showed high EQEmax values of 27.1–35.9% and 26.5–32.2%, respectively. It is worth noting that the SF1BN-based devices maintained a FHWM of 28 nm.
Limited by the molecular backbone of the MR-TADF material, the efficiency of the device decreases severely with increasing voltage. Therefore, Zheng and colleagues took the lead in integrating rigid hole transport units into the MR core (BCz-BN, name BBCz-SB in this work) to synthesize two high-efficiency and low roll-off MR-TADF emitters (NBO and NBNP) (Fig. 14e).107 Due to the effective expansion of the CT dissociation domain in the B,N-framework, the emission peaks of NBO and NBNP in toluene solution appeared at 487 nm and 500 nm, with FWHMs of 27 nm and 29 nm, respectively. Both emitters showed small ΔEST values of 0.12 and 0.09 eV and high PLQY values of 92% and 93%, respectively. The kRISC values were calculated to be 9.3 × 105 s−1 for NBO and 3.0 × 105 s−1 for NBNP, which were higher than that of BBCz-SB (1.4 × 104 s−1). Eventually, the devices based on NBO and NBNP achieved EQEmax values of 26.1% and 28.0% with FWHMs of 29 and 33 nm, respectively. Importantly, the EQE of the NBNP-based OLED was maintained at 22.4% at a luminance of 3000 cd m−2. These results prove the feasibility of this design strategy to construct effective MR-TADF emitters to suppress the decrease in efficiency.
Zheng and colleagues designed and synthesized a novel emitter, LTCz-BN, (Fig. 14f) by further rigidifying the NBNP.108 Similar to NBNP, LTCz-BN exhibited narrowband green emission at 497 nm with an FWHM of 27 nm and a small ΔEST of 0.10 eV in toluene. The high PLQY value of LTCz-BN was 93% in 5 wt% doped mCBP films. The TADF device with 5 wt% LTCz-BN as the dopant in the mCBP host exhibited an EQEmax of 27.2% with a λEL of 500 nm, a FWHM of 33 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.13, 0.60). Notably, the OLED suppressed efficiency roll-off, with an EQE of 25.4% and 23.5% at 3000 and 5000 cd m−2, respectively, because LTCz-BN showed a fast kRISC of 8.3 × 105 s−1. These results demonstrated that improving the rigidity of MR-TADF emitters is a potential solution strategy for better performance.
Xu's group proposed a new strategy, called self-hosts, in which host segments are introduced into the MR core.109 Based on this strategy, a blue MR-TADF, tCBNDADPO, was developed (Fig. 13 and 14g). It showed a strong and sharp PL band at 466 nm with an FWHM of 26 nm. The compound shows a high PLQY of 99% and short τp and τd of 0.9 ns and 0.5 μs, respectively. Therefore, the EQEmax of the tCBNDADPO-based device was 30.8% at 30 wt% doping concentration.

A strategy to further improve the device performance is to use a co-host system. Two green MR-TADF emitters, BN-DMAC and BN-DPAC (Fig. 14h), were developed by Yang et al.110 They showed narrow PL bands at 485 and 490 nm with FWHMs of 29 and 30 nm, respectively. These compounds not only show small ΔEST values of 0.14 and 0.11 eV but also show high PLQYs of 63% and 86%. The τp and τd of BN-DMAC and BN-DPAC are 5.1 ns/13.9 μs and 4.4 ns/11.6 μs, respectively. Therefore, the EQEmax values of the BN-DMAC- and BN-DPAC-based devices are 21.1% and 28.2%, respectively. Both devices exhibited similar EL peaks at 502 and 504 nm with the same FWHM of 48 nm. Furthermore, the OLED performance is improved by replacing mCBP with an exciplex mCBP:PO-T2T co-host system, corresponding to a maximum EQE of over 30%. The LT80 of the packaged device reaches 82 h with an initial brightness of 500 cd m−2, which shows the potential of these emitters in practical applications.
Recently, Eli and colleagues reported two emitters, 3TPA-DiKTa and 3DPA-DiKTa (Fig. 14i), which contain three diphenylamine or triphenylamine donor groups and modify a central MR-TADF core (DiKTa).111 In 2 wt% doped mCP films, 3TPA-DiKTa shows a green emission at λPL of 551 nm with an FWHM of 58 nm and a PLQY of 93%, while 3DPA-DiKTa exhibits red emission at λPL of 617 nm with an FWHM of 56 nm and a PLQY of 60%. Compared to 3TPA-DiKTa with a ΔEST of 0.13 eV, a τd of 131 μs and a kRISC of 2.49 × 104 s−1, 3DPA-DiKTa has a larger ΔEST of 0.20 eV, a longer τd of 323 μs and a kRISC of 0.14 × 104 s−1. The OLEDs fabricated with 3TPA-DiKTa and 3DPA-DiKTa achieved high EQEs of 30.8% and 16.7% and narrow emission at 551 nm with an FWHM of 62 nm and 613 nm with an FWHM of 60 nm, respectively. In addition, due to the long τd of 3TPA-DiKTa and 3DPA-DiKTa, the devices fabricated with them show severe efficiency roll-offs of 41.2% and 80%. To overcome this problem, they used the TADF material (4CzIPN) as a TADF assistant dopant to prepare TST devices. As a result, this corresponds to a significantly lower efficiency roll-off of 8.6% for the 3TPA-DiKTa-based device and 51% for the 3DPA-DiKTa-based device at 100 cd m−2. The TST devices achieved EQEmax/λEL/FWHM of 30.0%/556 nm/70 nm and 17.9%/615 nm/61 nm, respectively.
The feasibility of MR-TADF as a sensitizer has been demonstrated, which provides a strategy for developing green and red OLEDs with high performance and high color purity, but the efficacy of MR-TADF as a sensitizer for blue OLEDs has not yet been established.112 Thus, Wang's group selected a deep-blue MR-TADF emitter (3tPAB, peak wavelength of the lowest-energy absorption band (λabs) = 438 nm, λPL = 456 nm, PLQY = 74.7%, kRISC = 5.74 × 104 s−1) as a sensitizer for the blue traditional fluorescence emitter (DtPaPy, λabs = 428 nm, λPL = 481 nm, PLQY = 71%, no RISC) and MR-TADF emitter (PhDMAC-BN, λabs = 449 nm, λPL = 473 nm, PLQY = 86.4%, kRISC = 5.04 × 104 s−1) (Fig. 14j).1133tPAB was chosen as a sensitizer for two reasons: one is a large spectral overlap between the PL spectra of the sensitizer and the absorption of the emitter, and the other is the introduction of tert-butyl in the sensitizer prepared using DtPaPy as an emitter, which further induced the occurrence of Förster energy transfer (FET) and effectively inhibited the Dexter energy transfer (DET). First, the corresponding nonsensitized OLEDs were prepared using DtPaPy as an emitter, and TADF-sensitized fluorescence (TSF) OLEDs were prepared using DtPaPy as an emitter and 3tPAB as a sensitizer. Both devices exhibited blue emission at 480 nm with different FWHMs of 51 and 57 nm. Notably, the TSF-OLED achieveed an EQEmax of 14.4%, and the value was improved by approximately 2.4 times compared with the device without sensitizer (EQEmax = 6.1%). The PhDMAC-BN-based OELD exhibited an EQEmax of 27.2%, a λEL of 480 nm, an FWHM of 34 nm, and CIE color coordinates of (0.105, 0.264), and the EQEmax was further improved to 33.9% when 3tPAB was employed as a sensitizer for PhDMAC-BN. Therefore, this work provides a new approach to improve the performance of blue OLEDs by using MR-TADF materials as sensitizers.

3.3. CPL MR-TADF emitters
Chiral compounds are widely found in pharmaceuticals, food, pesticides, the human body and the environment.114 A wide variety of chiral materials play a crucial role in the fields of optics, electrochemistry, catalysis, and nanotechnology.115 At present, circularly polarized light-emitting (CPL) materials are attracting much attention due to their potential applications in 3D displays, information storage, and biological probes.116
CPL properties have been found in MR-TADF emitters, and the four types of chiral sources were applied to them as shown in Fig. 15.117 Zhu and Chou et al. proposed an asymmetrical peripherally locked enantiomer to synthesize five CP-MR-TADF molecules, BN1, BN2, BN3, BN4 and BN5 (Fig. 16a).118 These compounds exhibit narrowband emission in the range of 475–511 nm with FWHMs of 34–46 nm. Notably, BN4 and BN5 exhibit more remarkable CPL properties because of the whole helical skeleton and the related chiral behavior. As a result, two pairs of solution-processed OLEDs based on (+)/(−)-BN4 and (+)/(−)-BN5 display green emission with narrow FWHMs of 49/49 nm and 48/48 nm, respectively. More importantly, the EQEmax reaches 20.6%/19.0%, and gEL reaches +3.7 × 10−3/−3.1 × 10−3 for (+)/(−)-BN4-based OLEDs. For (+)/(−)-BN5-based devices, the EQEmax and gEL are 22.0%/26.5% and +1.9 × 10−3/−1.6 × 10−3, respectively.

To further investigate high-performance red CPL materials, Wang et al. reported three B,N-based chiral materials, 1a, 1b and 1c (Fig. 16b).119 These three compounds exhibit similar CD characteristics, but the chiral features are modulated by the surrounding substituents and gradually redshifted in the range of 1a–1c. Notably, the chiral response of 1a-1c covers the UV and visible region from 300 to 700 nm, which has rarely been reported for helicene compounds. The |gabs| of 1a–1c reaches maximum values of 0.033, 0.031 and 0.026 at 502, 518 and 526 nm, respectively, representing the highest |gabs| values of helicene molecules in the visible range. In addition, 1a–1c exhibit PL bands at 660, 684 and 696 nm, with high PLQYs (90–100%) and small ΔEST (0.18–0.22 eV). More importantly, the CPL brightness (BCPL) values of 1a–c are 28.5, 37.1 and 40.0 M−1 cm−1, representing one of the highest BCPL values in the red-near-infrared region of helicenes. These excellent chiral properties demonstrate the great potential of B,N heterocyclic alkenes as chiral materials and provide a new direction for the future development of chiral optoelectronics.
Dating back to 2003, Venkataraman et al. found that the QAO skeleton can be used to construct chiral molecules.120,121 Eli et al. developed an intrinsic helical chiral MR-TADF molecule, Hel-DiDiKTa (Fig. 16c), with CPL properties based on the extended DiKTa backbone.122 As expected, the emitter showed narrow photophysical properties at 473 nm and an FWHM of 44 nm. Notably, a maximum |gabs| of 2.8 × 10−3 was observed at 320 nm for both enantiomers, and a |gPL| of 4 × 10−4 was observed at 465 nm for both enantiomers. Unfortunately, the PLQY of both enantiomeric emitters is very small, making them unsuitable as an emitter in OLEDs. Before that, Liao et al. designed narrowband CP-MR-TADF emitters based on the triarylamine helicene framework.123 The enantiomers (M)-QAO-PhCz/(P)-QAO-PhCz exhibited CPL properties with glum values of −9.2 × 10−4 and 1.1 × 10−3 in toluene solution, respectively (Fig. 16d). The fluorescence spectrum at room temperature shows a distinct blue emission peak at 461 nm with an FWHM of 29 nm. The PLQY of QAO-PhCz is 46.6% in the mCBP-doped film under a nitrogen atmosphere. Blue EL emission at 467 nm with an FWHM of 36 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.13, 0.18) is achieved in the QAO-PhCz-based device. The CP-OLED shows an EQEmax of 14.0% and a clear CPEL signal with an electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (gEL) of 1.5 × 10−3. The simple and facile method of narrowband emission CP-TADF molecular construction will promote the wider application of helicene molecules in the field of organic electronics.
Recently, Yang and co-workers designed and synthesized a novel pair of helically chiral CP-MR-TADF enantiomers with double hetero[5]helicene, namely, (P/M)-helicene-BN (Fig. 16e).124(M)-Helicene-BN exhibits narrowband green emission with a peak at 520 nm and an FWHM of 46 nm in toluene solution, accompanied by distinct TADF properties in the doped film with a high PLQY of 98% and a small ΔEST of 0.15 eV. It is worth noting that the doped film has large gPL values of +1.3 × 10−3 and −2.0 × 10−3 for (P)-helicene-BN and (M)-helicene-BN, respectively. The OLED devices fabricated with (P)-helicene-BN and (M)-helicene-BN both exhibit EQEmax values of 31.5% and 30.7% with green emission at 523 and 524 nm, FWHM values of 49 nm and 50 nm, and CIE color coordinates values of (0.26, 0.66) and (0.26, 0.66), respectively. In addition, the devices show significant CPEL signals with gELs of +1.2 × 10−3 for (P)-helicene-BN and −2.2 × 10−3 for (P)-helicene-BN. In addition, this group developed a pair of ultraviolet CP-MR-TADF enantiomers, (+)-(P)-BTPT and (−)-(M)-BTPT (Fig. 16f), by using two sulfone groups as a linkage to lock the ortho-position of a triphenylamine core.125 In toluene, (+)-(P)-BTPT shows narrowband ultraviolet emission with a peak at 368 nm and an FWHM of 33 nm. As expected, the enantiomeric crystals displayed significant CPL signals with remarkable gEL values of −2.8 × 10−3 for (+)-(P)-BTPT and +7.8 × 10−3 for (−)-(M)-BTPT. Unfortunately, there are no relevant OLED data, but the first example of an ultraviolet CP-MR-TADF emitter has been reported.
Yang and co-workers proposed a new strategy, which is the incorporation of a chiral carbon center into the MR skeleton, to realize highly efficient chiral CP-MR-TADF emitters. Thus, a pair of chiral green CP-MR-TADF emitters, (R)-BN-MeIAc and (S)-BN-MeIAc (Fig. 16g), were designed and synthesized by Yang and co-workers with sp3-hybridized carbon.126BN-MeIAc showed strong and sharp emission peaking at 497 nm with an FWHM of 30 nm in toluene solution and high PLQYs of 96% in the doped film. Notably, the gPL of (R)-BN-MeIAc and (S)-BN-MeIAc in doped films were measured to be +3.1 × 10−4 and −3.2 × 10−4, respectively. As a result, the CP-OLEDs based on (R/S)-BN-MeIAc exhibited highly efficient narrowband emission at 504/503 nm with an FWHM of 33/33 nm, CIE color coordinates of (0.12, 0.63)/(0.12, 0.62), and an EQEmax of 37.2%/36.1%, together with apparent CPEL characteristics with gELs of +2.7 × 10−4 and −2.9 × 10−4. This work has enriched the range of CP-MR-TADF emitters with high performance.
Until recently, by introducing [2.2]paracyclo(1,4)carbazolophane (Czp) into a B,N-doped MR core, Zheng et al. synthesized two pairs of CP-MR-TADF enantiomers, (R/S)-Czp-tBuCzB and (R/S)-Czp-POAB, with planar chirality (Fig. 16h).127 Their emission peaks in toluene were observed at 478 nm and 497 nm, and the FWHMs were 23 nm and 36 nm, respectively. The PLQYs in doped films were as high as 98% and 93%, respectively. The (R/S)-Czp-tBuCzB-based CP-OLED exhibited sky-blue EL emission peaking at 479 nm with a narrow FWHM of 24 nm, and the EQEmax of the device reached 32.1%. When the brightness reached 1000 cd m−2, the efficiency roll-off was only 3.7%, which is the smallest among blue CP-OLEDs. The device based on (R/S)-Czp-MOAB shows the first almost pure green CPEL based on the CP-MR-TADF emitter, with an emission peak at 513 nm, an FWHM of 48 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.23, 0.65). Both CP-OLEDs show symmetrical CPEL spectra, and their coefficients are 1.54 × 10−3 and 1.30 × 10−3, respectively. In this work, Czp, a rigid planar chiral structure, was introduced into B,N-doped CP-MR-TADF emitters, and CP-OLEDs were prepared with high EQE, narrow FWHM and a high asymmetry factor. Among them, the blue CP-OLEDs had the smallest efficiency roll-off in the same kind of research, and the green CP-OLEDs showed CPEL close to pure green for the first time.
Wang and Li et al. combined CPL optical properties with MR-TADF to achieve CPEL signals. They used a chiral perturbation strategy by grafting chiral (R/S)-octahydro-binaphthol ((R/S)-OBN) units onto 2CN-BN and 4CN-BN to obtain CPL activity. Two pairs of green CP-MR-TADF enantiomers, (R/S)-OBN-2CN-BN and (R/S)-OBN-4CN-BN, were constructed (Fig. 16i).128 They exhibited green emission at 493 and 500 nm with FWHM of 22 and 27 nm, respectively. The PLQY and ΔEST in the doped films were estimated to be 0.12 eV and 95% for (R)-OBN-2CN-BN and 0.13 eV and 90% for (R)-OBN-4CN-BN. The CPL spectra of the two pairs of enantiomers in the doped films exhibited almost mirror-image relationships with photoluminescence dissymmetry factors (gPL) of +9.0 × 10−4 for (R)-OBN-2CN-BN, −9.1 × 10−4 for (S)-OBN-2CN-BN, +8.0 × 10−4 for (R)-OBN-4CN-BN, and −10.4 × 10−4 for (S)-OBN-4CN-BN. This result confirms the effectiveness of the CP-MR-TADF molecular construction strategy. Devices based on (R)-OBN-2CN-BN and (R)-OBN-4CN-BN emit sharp green spectra at 496 and 508 nm with FWHMs of 30 and 33 nm, respectively. The maximum EQEs of the two devices are 29.4% and 24.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the efficiency roll-off was significantly improved after using 5CzBn as a sensitizer. This provides a new idea for highly efficient MR-TADF materials with CPL properties.
In another report, Zheng et al. pioneered the incorporation of chiral unit R-octahydro-binaphthol into the MR skeleton to synthesize two novel CP-MR-TADF materials, R-DOBN and R-DOBNT (Fig. 16j).129 TD-DFT calculations revealed that R-octahydro-binaphthol is involved in the frontier orbital distribution and that there are simplicial orbitals, based on which both emitters achieved high vibrational strengths and stable axial chiral configurations. At the same time, due to steric hindrance, the conjugation between the two luminescent cores was decreased. The PL spectral peaks appeared at 453 and 459 nm for R-DOBN and R-DOBNT in solution, respectively. Both emitters are characterized by a small FWHM of 21 nm as well as high PLQY (91% and 96%). Furthermore, the OLEDs using R-DOBN and R-DOBNT as emitters exhibited ultrapure blue EL with CIE color coordinates of (0.14, 0.10) and (0.13, 0.12), narrow FWHMs of 38 and 35 nm, and EQEmax of 23.9% and 25.6%, respectively. Moreover, a remarkable CPEL characteristic, with |gEL| factors ≈ 10−3, can be observed, indicating the application prospects of R-DOBN and R-DOBN in CP-OLEDs with high color purity.
Recently, Yang et al. used a chiral exciplex-forming co-host combined with a nonchiral MR-TADF emitter to obtain strong CPL with high efficiency.130 As shown in Fig. 16k, the nonchiral MR-TADF emitter is BN1, and the chiral exciplex-forming co-host is composed of R/S-CzOBN and POT2T. Among them, R/S-CzOBN is used as the chiral donor molecule due to its stable chirality and electron-rich ability, while POT2T with a higher triplet energy level is selected as an achiral acceptor. Finally, the narrowband CP-OLEDs achieved a record high EQE of up to 33.2% with an FWHM of 42 nm and a strong CPEL signal with a |gEL| of 2.8 × 10−3 by effective FRET from the chiral excitonic complex to BN1. This strategy is effective in achieving full-color, high-efficiency narrowband CP-OLEDs.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
We summarized the applications of narrowband TADF emitters with multi-resonance cores, mainly including boron/oxygen, boron/nitrogen, boron/sulfur, nitrogen/carbonyl, boron/nitrogen/oxygen, and boron/nitrogen/sulfur polycyclic aromatic units. MR-TADF emitters have been demonstrated as a key solution to the problem of poor color purity that plagues conventional TADF emitters. As shown in Section 3.1, the fused molecular framework with enfeebled ICT characteristic restricts the emission in the blue to green region (mostly 470–500 nm). However, the production of ultrawide color gamut MR-materials is essential for the fabrication of full-color HD OLED displays. Thus, we summarize the strategies that can modulate the light of MR-TADF materials: (1) to blueshift the wavelength of MR-TADF emitters, two approaches are commonly used: (i) incorporating electron-deficient imine N or replacing amine N with O/S can lead to a blueshift of the emission wavelength and (ii) incorporating a meta-B–π–B and X–π–X (X = N/O/S) arrangement can interrupt the effective CT delocalization and increase the bandgap of the emitters. (2) To redshift the wavelength of MR-TADF emitters, three approaches are commonly used: (i) the peripheral modification of the MR-skeleton with D or A units can judiciously tune the emission beyond the blue region, only leading to redshifted emission with the ability to toggle between green and yellow wavelengths, (ii) incorporating rigid PAHs is another promising strategy to construct long wavelength narrowband emitters; the stronger the electron-absorbing ability of PAHs added, the more red-shifted the luminescence wavelength, and (iii) one reported design incorporates para-B–π–B and X–π–X (X = N/O) arrangement coupled with the extended fused π-skeleton to produce red MR-TADF emitters. In particular, Hatakeyama et al. employed ν-DABNA as an emitter and achieved high blue purity emission with a peak at 469 nm and an FWHM of 18 nm, comparable to quantum dot or chalcogenide LEDs. Zhang et al. used a green MR-TADF emitter tCzphB-Fl to obtain a purest green bottom-emitting device with an FWHM of 24 nm and a CIE y value of 0.75. The BN-ICz-1-based TE-OLED prepared by Duan et al. is the purest green OLED with CIE color coordinates of (0.17, 0.78). Yasuda and Duan et al. successfully obtained red MR-TADF emitters by the para B–π–B and para N–π–N strategies. The BBCz-R-based device displayed narrowband red emission with a peak at 616 nm, an FWHM of 26 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.67, 0.33). Deep red OLEDs based on R-BN and R-TBN emitted at 663 and 686 nm with CIE color coordinates of (0.720, 0.279) and (0.722, 0.278), respectively, and both FWHM values were 48 nm. These results provide a solid foundation for full-color HD displays.
To overcome the efficiency roll-off caused by triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA), singlet exciton-polaron annihilation (SPA), ACQ, etc., were employed. The design of the materials and the optimization of the device structure should be taken into account simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, the RISC rate and stability issue are key parameters for MR-TADF emitters. The RISC and lifetime of MR-TADF can be promoted by the following methods: (1) Modifying the MR core with auxiliary donors or acceptors can be an effective strategy to improve the RISC process. In addition, this strategy could modulate the wavelength and FWHM of the emitters, suggesting that careful control of the substitution positions and donor/acceptor strengths is necessary. (2) Incorporating heavy heteroatoms (O, S, Se, etc.) into the B,N-polycyclic backbone could help achieve a larger SOC and faster RISC. (3) Incorporating a TADF sensitizer with a fast RISC rate could reduce excimer quenching to achieve high efficiency, low roll-off, and improved device lifetime.
Blue, green and red MR-TADF emitters for highly efficient OLEDs have been developed over the past few years. However, the molecular structures and types of MR-TADF materials are very limited (Fig. 17), and the lifetime issue of MR-TADF-based devices still makes it difficult to meet the required specifications for commercial applications. Therefore, toward the practical applications of MR-TADF in the future, the following perspective strategies should be given sufficient research attention: (1) To design and synthesize MR-TADF materials with novel structures and new methods. (2) To construct full-color MR-TADF emitters. (3) To obtain deep-blue TADF sensitizers with wavelengths less than 460 nm. (4) To expand the application of MR-TADF materials in lasers, biological imaging and other research fields. These challenges continue to inspire researchers to develop more MR-TADF emitters and efficient narrowband OLEDs. We hope that this work will help stimulate the field of MR-TADF emitters research and drive further advances in narrowband optical science.
