    , Accepted 14th May 2019First published on 15th May 2019AbstractFor photovoltaic polymers with a D–π–A backbone, there are a great deal of D and A units, but the choice of π bridge is relatively limited and thiophene (T) is still the most effective one. Here, we utilize two D–π–A polymers, J52-FS with thiophene as the π bridge and PE2 with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) as the π bridge, to combine with a low band-gap non-fullenere Y6, respectively. The photovoltaic cells based on PE2:Y6 can realize a PCE of 13.50%, which is obviously higher than the 10.58% PCE of the J52-FS:Y6 analogue. Our work demonstrates that using TT as the π-bridge is a simple and promising approach to construct efficient photovoltaic polymers.
Solution processable conjugated polymers have attracted much attention for application in printed electronic devices such as polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs),1 field-effect transistors (FETs)2 and polymer solar cells (PSCs)3 because their optoelectronic properties can be easily modified by molecular engineering. For photovoltaic polymers, the most classical and promising configuration is the D–π–A backbone, which consists of alternating electron-donating (D), π bridge and electron-accepting (A) units. The absorption spectra, energy levels, crystallinity and charge mobility of the D–π–A type polymers can be modulated by optimizing the large amount of D and A units.4–6 However, the choice of the π bridge is relatively limited, and thiophene (T) is still the most important and effective one.
From the viewpoint of chemical structure, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) is similar to T and can always guarantee the polymer a linear backbone, which can effectively extend the conjugated length and improve the crystallinity. Thus, TT was also tested as the π bridge to fine-tune the properties of p-type polymers and sometimes can obtain an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE). For example, when alkylthiophene-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T) was used as the D unit to copolymerize with different A units of benzothiadiazole (BT),7 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),8 and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)9 respectively, the polymers with the TT π-bridge could realize higher PCEs than that of the T-based analogues. The PCE values could be increased from 2.3% to 6.0% (for BT-based polymers); 4.1% to 5.3% (for DPP-based polymers); and 4.4% to 6.8% (for TPD-based polymers), respectively. It is worth noting that the fullerene derivative of PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor in all the above cases. Obviously, the photovoltaic performance for these TT-based polymers is still unsatisfactory even after the improvement from T-based polymers.
In fact, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have promoted the rapid progress of PSCs since 201510–12 and the PCEs have been increased to over 15% in 2019.13 However, almost all the promising p-type polymers matched well with NFA utilized thiophene as the π-bridge,14–16 and polymers with a TT π-bridge play negligible roles in fullerene-free organic solar cells. Recently, we developed a “D–π–A” polymer of PE2 with TT as the π bridge as shown in Fig. 1, which can attain an extremely high VOC of 1.26 V with a moderate PCE of 5.83% in conjunction with a NFA of BTA3.17 The analogue polymer, J52-FS, with thiophene as the π bridge gave a lower PCE of 3.86% with a VOC of 1.24 V by using a similar NFA of BTA13.18 Although the TT-bridge polymer of PE2 exhibits a higher PCE than that of the T-bridge polymer of J52-FS, the PCE values are too low mainly due to small HOMO offset between the donor and acceptor.18 Very recently, a new class of low band gap NFA of Y6 based on a multi-fused ring central unit (as shown in Fig. 1) realized the highest PCE of 15.7% by using a T π-bridge polymer as the donor.13 Thus, in this paper, we used J52-FS and PE2 to combine with Y6, which has a low-lying and well-matched HOMO of −5.65 eV. We will systematically investigate the effect of the TT-bridge on the optoelectronic properties of the “D–π–A” polymers and simultaneously hope to realize the highest PCE for TT-based polymers.

J52-FS, PE2 and Y6 were synthesized via reported synthesis routes. The UV-Vis spectra were examined to investigate the effects of the TT π-bridge on the absorption properties. The normalized absorption spectra of the two polymers and Y6 are shown in Fig. 2a (in film) and Fig. S2 (in solution) (ESI†), respectively. The detailed data are provided in Table S1 (ESI†), where the energy-related data are directly taken from the literatures.13,17,18 As shown in Fig. 2a, J52-FS with the T π-bridge and PE2 with the TT π-bridge show very similar absorption characteristics featuring maximum absorption peaks at 542 and 545 nm respectively and a strong absorption range of 400–620 nm, which are well complementary to that of Y6. In addition, PE2 has a stronger shoulder peak than that of J52-FS in solution as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), which indicates that PE2 exhibits a strong pre-aggregation in solution and would be favorable to form a higher crystalline film, and potentially a better fill factor (FF) as well. The energy band gaps (Eoptg) of the two polymers are 1.93 and 1.95 eV, respectively, which also indicate that the TT π-bridge has a negligible effect on the Eoptg.

The energy level diagram of the J52-FS, PE2 and Y6 is shown in Fig. 2b. It is abnormal that the TT-based PE2 shows a downshifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level compared to that of J52-FS. In general, most TT π-bridge polymers exhibit an upshifted HOMO compared to their counterparts with a T π-bridge, which might be related with the large steric hindrance of the alkyl chain in the TT π-bridge. Anyway, the low-lying HOMO of PE2 will contribute to a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) for PE2:Y6 based solar cells.
To investigate the influence of the TT π-bridge on their photovoltaic properties, conventional photovoltaic devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/active layer/Ca/Al were fabricated. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are plotted in Fig. 3a, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1, where the data of J52-FS:BTA13 and PE2:BTA3 are directly taken from the literatures for comparison. The detailed optimization processes, including total concentration, thermal annealing (TA) temperature, solvent additive and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) are supplied in Tables S2–S7 (ESI†). As listed in Table 1, the best PSC based on J52-FS:Y6 (1:1.2, w/w) combination gave a VOC of 0.81 V, a JSC of 22.92 mA cm−2, FF of 0.57, and a PCE of 10.58%. Nevertheless, under the synergistic effects of thermal annealing, additive CN and SVA, PE2:Y6 achieved a remarkable PCE of 13.50% with a VOC of 0.83 V, a JSC of 23.24 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.70, which are distinctly superior to that of J52-FS:Y6. In addition, it is worth noting that the PCE (13.50%) of PE2:Y6 is not only the highest value for the TT-based polymers, but also the best performance for organic solar cells based on a simple calcium cathode layer. Obviously, both of the PCEs largely exceed their counterparts (3.84% for J52-FS:BTA13 and 5.83% for PE2:BTA3), which indicates that the choice of suitable NFAs is vital. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the best devices are shown in Fig. 3b. Both of them showed a strong absorption from 300 to 900 nm, and the calculated JSC values from the EQE curves matched well with those obtained from the J–V measurements within 5% mismatch.

Furthermore, the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) were characterized by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with corresponding structures of the ITO/PEDOT: PSS/active layer/Au (hole-only device) and ITO/TiOx/active layer/Al (electron-only device), respectively. The curves of the optimized J52-FS:Y6 and PE2:Y6 are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The μh/μe for J52-FS:Y6 and PE2:Y6 are 5.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/2.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/1.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The lower μh of the PE2:Y6 might arise from relatively large torsion between the BDT unit and TT π-bridge, which could be reduced by removing the alkyl chains in the TT unit. Meanwhile, both of them showed a high electron mobility, which implied that both of them formed effective electron channels in the blend films. However, different from many other material combinations, PE2:Y6 displayed a lower μe than that of the inferior performance device J52-FS:Y6, suggesting that the charge carrier mobilities are not the decisive factor when the value arrives at the order of magnitude of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.
The morphologies were further characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the height images for the optimized J52-FS:Y6 and PE2:Y6 blend films are shown in Fig. 4. At the first glance, these two blend films displayed obviously different surface morphologies. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the PE2:Y6 (1.65 nm) was larger than the former (1.15 nm), which implied its strong crystallinity in the blend film, and this might be attributed to the good crystallinity of PE2, as reported in our previous work.17

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was also carried out to evaluate the molecular orientation and packing in the blend film, and their 2D GIWAXS patterns and corresponding line-cut profiles are shown in Fig. 5. Both of them showed π–π stacking at qz ≈ 1.74 Å−1 along the out-of-plane direction, indicating a preferred face-on orientation in the blend film. In addition, the stronger π–π stacking of PE2:Y6 than that of J52-FS:Y6 would be favorable to vertical charge transport, and might be partly the cause of higher FF. Furthermore, PE2:Y6 exhibited additional (200) lamellar packing peaks at qxy ≈ 0.43 Å−1, implying its stronger crystallinity than J52-FS:Y6, which is in good agreement with the AFM analysis.

In summary, we used two similar D–π–A conjugated polymer donors J52-FS and PE2, containing thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) as the π-bridge respectively, to combine with a low band gap non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) of Y6. Compared to J52-FS, PE2 showed a down-shifted HOMO energy level, higher crystallinity and stronger π–π stacking, which account for the higher VOC, JSC and FF of PE2:Y6 (VOC = 0.83 V, JSC = 23.24 mA cm−2, FF = 0.70) than J52-FS:Y6 (VOC = 0.81 V, JSC = 22.92 mA cm−2, FF = 0.57). Consequently, a remarkable PCE of 13.50% was realized for the PE2:Y6 combination, which is also the highest value for TT-based photovoltaic polymers. Our work demonstrates that using TT as the π-bridge is a simple and promising approach to construct efficient photovoltaic polymers.
