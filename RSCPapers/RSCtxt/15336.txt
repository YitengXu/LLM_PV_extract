J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. 2, 1983, 79, 473-482Transfer and storage of chemical and radiation potential(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )George PorterAbstractThe change in potential which accompanies any spontaneous process is given by RT ln [1 –(j/J)], where j is the net forward flux and J is the forward flux at the same reactant potential but in the absence of products. This equation is applied to thermal and photochemical reactions. For the latter, we introduce and evaluate the quantities ‘radiation potential’ and ‘scattered radiation potential’ in analogy with ‘chemical potential’.‘Storage’ of energy is defined and shown to be a two-stage process. Thermodynamic losses are relatively small provided the rather stringent requirements of geometry and transport kinetics can be met. The influences of these several factors on the efficiency of solar-energy collection and storage are evaluated.
