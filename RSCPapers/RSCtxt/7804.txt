    , Accepted 26th October 2010First published on 2nd December 2010AbstractA high surface area electrode is functionalized with cobalt-based oxygen evolving catalysts (Co-OEC = electrodeposited from pH 7 phosphate, Pi, pH 8.5 methylphosphonate, MePi, and pH 9.2 borate electrolyte, Bi). Co-OEC prepared from MePi and operated in Pi and Bi achieves a current density of 100 mA cm−2 for water oxidation at 442 and 363 mV overpotential, respectively. The catalyst retains activity in near-neutral pH buffered electrolyte in natural waters such as those from the Charles River (Cambridge, MA) and seawater (Woods Hole, MA). The efficacy and ease of operation of anodes functionalized with Co-OEC at appreciable current density together with its ability to operate in near neutral pH buffered natural water sources bodes well for the translation of this catalyst to a viable renewable energy storage technology.

Broader context
Energy storage, when coupled to renewable generation, can transform society by providing carbon neutral, scalable, and sustainable energy anytime, anywhere, and at any scale. The conversion of intermittent electrical power from renewable generation sources, such as solar and wind, into renewable fuels presents a compelling storage solution. Recently we have begun investigating a cobalt-based oxygen evolving catalyst (Co-OEC) that affects the challenging energy storing reaction of water splitting. The Co-OEC catalyst is unique because it: (1) operates safely with high activity under benign conditions using inexpensive, earth abundant, and highly manufacturable materials, (2) is functional in unpurified, natural water streams and seawater, (3) is robust, self-healing and easy to use, (4) can form on diverse conducting surfaces of varying geometry and therefore can be easily interfaced with a variety of light absorbing and charge separating materials, (5) may be activated by solar-derived electricity or directly by sunlight mediated by a semiconductor, and (6) enables transformative small scale distributed energy models. The ease of operation of anodes functionalized with the Co-OEC catalyst at appreciable geometric current density together with its ability to operate in natural water sources bodes well for the translation of Co-OEC to a viable technology.

Introduction
Evaluating nascent technologies at the discovery stage against fully engineered commercial products is difficult because new technologies have generally not yet benefited from extensive iterative development. What is certain, however, is that new discoveries that involve materials that are difficult to make, manufacture and implement tend to have long product development cycles. In these cases, before discovery can be translated to a viable technology, the iterative developmental cycle can become mired in the so-called “valley of death” where financing constraints suffocate innovation.1–3 Conversely, discoveries that are based on materials that are easy to make, manufacture and implement can have much shorter iterative development cycles and consequently have a greater chance to avoid the chasm that the “valley of death” presents to nascent technologies.
For this reason, the discovery of new Co4,5 and Ni6 based water splitting catalysts are of potential technological interest. Converting water to O2 and H2 is the central chemistry of conversion processes that store renewable energy in the form of chemical fuels.7,8 This overall transformation can be accomplished using electrocatalysts to mediate the critical water splitting step. Precious and non-precious metal oxides have been optimized for use in commercial water-splitting electrolyzers.9–12 First-row metal oxides such as Co- or Ni-containing spinels and perovskites are employed in alkaline electrolyzers that operate in concentrated KOH solutions,13 while metal oxides such as RuO2 and IrO2 are employed in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers that operate under highly acidic conditions.14,15 Electrolysis at the pH extremes is a remarkably robust and efficient process with appreciable electric to chemical energy conversion efficiencies.16 Nevertheless, distributed renewable energy storagevia these commercial water splitting systems remains prohibitively expensive, especially for non-concentrated solar energy storage applications.17 One possible path to lowering the cost and the barrier to proliferation of hydrogen-based solar energy storage is to develop new technologies that do not require expensive membranes, catalysts or the high balance of system costs that accompany the operation of electrolysis in harsh environments. To this end, we have turned our attention to developing inexpensive, highly manufacturable, water-splitting catalysts for energy storage.
The Co-based oxygen evolving catalysts form as thin films on conducting surfaces when aqueous solutions of Co2+ salts are electrolyzed in the presence of phosphate (Co–Pi) or borate (Co–Bi);4,5 a similar strategy was used to create a Ni–Bi catalyst.6 These catalysts are of interest because they: (1) form in situ under mild conditions on a variety of conductive substrates,4–6 (2) exhibit high activity in pH 7–9 water at room temperature,4,5 (3) are functional in salt water,5 (4) are comprised of inexpensive, earth-abundant materials,4,5 (5) self-heal by reversing catalyst corrosion at open circuit upon re-application of an anodic potential,18 (6) can be interfaced with light absorbing and charge separating materials to enhance photoelectrochemical water splitting,19–21 and (7) are functional models of the oxygen-evolving complex of Photosystem II.22 The simple operation of the catalyst from conventional water sources under benign conditions is an important step towards providing distributed solar energy storage at low-cost with a fast transition to technology.23
Initial reports of the Co- and Ni-based catalyst films investigated activity on planar FTO and ITO electrodes.4–6Catalytic activity was investigated in low current regimes in order to isolate key aspects of the mechanism and to avoid limitations on mass and electron transport through and within the films. Herein we now report the transition of the basic science toward a viable technology. We show that a high surface area electrode functionalized with Co-OEC operates at a current density of 100 mA per cm2 of geometric surface area24 at overpotentials of less than 400 mV. We also show that Co-OEC, operated under near neutral conditions, behaves remarkably well in natural waters from the Charles River and the Atlantic Ocean. Unlike Co-OEC, we show that anodized Ni catalysts, operated under typical alkaline conditions, quickly degrade and lose activity in these types of natural waters. The tolerance of Co-OEC to impurities is important for delivering solar energy to the non-legacy world because it relaxes the water source requirements for solar energy storageviawater splitting.
Experimental
Materials and methods
Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar), K2HPO4 (BDH), KH2PO4 (BDH), KOH (BDH), H3BO3 (BDH), Triton-X (Alfa Aesar), and isopropyl alcohol (BDH) were purchased from the indicated supplier and used as received. Working electrode substrates were composed of fluorine doped tin–oxide coated glass (FTO, Hartford Glass), Ni foil (Strem) or open cell Ni foams (Marketech).
Highly purified water (>18 MΩ cm resistivity, <3 ppb total organic carbon) was provided by a Barnstead NANOpure Diamond water purification system. Water samples from the Charles River (CR) were obtained by hand and seawater samples were purchased from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. Seawater solutions containing 1 M KOH (pH 14), 1 M potassium phosphate (KPi, pH 7), and 1 M potassium borate (KBi, pH 9.2) were passed through Whatman filter paper (Grade 541, 20–25 µm particle retention) prior to use. Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a 760C potentiostat/galvanostat from CH Instruments. Ag/AgCl reference electrodes were purchased from BAS and stored in 3 M NaCl when not in use and were calibrated relative to a master electrode to correct for any potential drift. A Hg/HgO reference was purchased from CH Instruments (0.108 V vs.NHE in 1FNaOH) for use in alkaline media. Electrolyte was driven in the flow cell by a peristaltic pump from Cole-Parmer. SEM images were taken on a Jeol 5910 Scanning Electron Microscope. For low vacuum environmental SEM images, samples were sent to Hitachi corporation for analysis. Cobalt analysis was performed using a Horiba ACTIVA-S inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) housed in the MIT Center for Materials Science and Engineering (CMSE).

          Sample preparations
        
Deposition of Co–Pi films on FTO was carried out in solutions containing 0.5 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.1 M potassium phosphate (KPi) at pH 7.0 using a standard 3-electrode configuration comprising an FTO working electrode, a Pt counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The working electrode area was masked to 1 cm2 using scotch tape. Catalyst films were electrodeposited at 0.85 V vs.Ag/AgCl from quiescent solutions. Co–Bi catalyst films5 on FTO were prepared in a similar manner to Co–Pi films excepting the use of 0.1 M potassium borate electrolyte (KBi) at pH 9.2 in place of the KPi and a lower working electrode voltage of 0.72 V vs.Ag/AgCl to compensate for the more basic pH.
Anodized Ni electrodes were prepared by confining the Ni foil to 1 cm2 active surface area with silicon-based sealant, followed by galvanostatic anodization at 2 mA cm−2 for 5 min in 1 M KOH (18 MΩ cm water).
The cobalt content in electrodeposited Co–Bi films was ascertained by ICP-OES analysis. The instrument was calibrated using commercial Co ICP standard solutions (Fluka). Co-OEC electrodes for analysis were prepared under the same conditions employed for the measurement of catalyst activity. After deposition, the electrodes were rinsed thoroughly with distilled water, and then the Co-OEC film was dissolved into a known volume of 2 wt% HNO3. ICP-OES analysis was conducted on the resulting solution.
High surface area Ni foam supports were cleaned by sonication for 5 min in an aqueous solution of Triton-X, followed by rinsing with distilled water and isopropyl alcohol. After cleaning, the foam samples were masked to expose 1 cm2 of geometric electrode area using a robust and electrically insulating silicone adhesive. Deposition of the Co-OEC catalyst on the exposed active area was performed using 10 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O solutions in 0.1 M MePi buffer (pH 8.5) and applying a bias of 1.1 V vs.Ag/AgCl to the electrode. MePi buffer was chosen as the electrolyte (in place of KPi) owing to the greater solubility of Co2+ ions in this medium. The depositions proceeded in stirred solutions to mitigate Co2+ mass transport limitations within the Ni foam.
Results and discussion
Anode morphology and activity

          Co-OEC films that are examined by traditional SEM techniques reveal catalyst films with µm sized cracks (Fig. 1a and b). The ITO substrate can be seen through cracks, which appear to split into complementary pieces suggesting that the cracks form upon dehydration of the catalyst film. We have confirmed this contention by using environmental SEM to examine the morphology of the Co-OEC film under conditions relevant to catalysis (aqueous solution). SEM images of hydrated samples were obtained by utilizing a sample cooling stage and low vacuum conditions. For this experiment, Co-OEC films were grown under typical conditions (0.5 mM Co2+, 0.1 M KPi at pH 7.0, 1.1 V vs.Ag/AgCl) on a nickel foil substrate.5 The resulting “wet” SEM images shown in Fig. 1c and d reveal a contiguous film that covers the Ni foil substrate with no significant cracking. This result indicates that catalyst films crack upon film dehydration. Based on these results, it is likely that these cracks are not present in as deposited Co-OEC films or during catalysis using the as-formed films.

To determine how activity of the anode scales with thickness of the catalyst films, Co–Bi anode films of varying cobalt loading were prepared by systematically varying the charge passed during the electrodeposition. Charge limits were set at 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, and 384 mC cm−2 to produce anodes with catalyst layers ranging in thickness from ∼15 nm to ∼400 nm (see ESI† for calculations). The charge was passed at a potential (0.72 V vs.Ag/AgCl) where water oxidation chemistry is minimal; therefore most of the charge passed is due to cobalt deposition (oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+) on the electrode. Nevertheless, the cobalt content of the film was analyzed chemically. To accurately quantify the cobalt loading, independently prepared catalyst films were dissolved in 2 wt% HNO3 and the cobalt concentration in the resulting solutions was determined by ICP-OES analysis.
For each film thickness, a Tafel (Evs. log (current density, i)) plot was collected in Bi electrolyte, pH 9.2 (Fig. S1†). Interpolation of these Tafel plots provided an accurate measure of the steady state current density at 400 mV overpotential for each film thickness (Fig. 2). The data show a linear increase in activity as the film thickness is increased even up to the thickest films investigated (384 mC cm−2, ∼400 nm thick). This indicates that the film is highly porous and that oxygen evolution is not confined to the outer surface.
 Fig. 2  Co–Bi film activity (current density at 400 mV overpotential) vs.catalyst loading for films deposited at 0.72 V vs.Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M KBi solution (pH 9.2). 
The average turnover frequency (TOF, mol O2s−1 produced per mol of cobalt atoms) for Co-OEC at η = 400 mV was determined by dividing the slope of a linear fit to the activity vs.catalyst loading data (Fig. 2) by 4F to yield a value of ∼1.5 × 10−3s−1. This analysis assumes that all of the cobalt centers are electrochemically active and therefore represent a lower bound for the activity of the catalyst. The TOF measured here is similar to most Co-based water oxidation catalysts. For instance, silica-templated nanoclusters of Co3O4 measured under photochemical conditions possess turnover frequencies of 1140 s−1,25 which translates to ∼8 × 10−4s−1 per Co when one considers the number of Co atoms in the nanorods, which are stated to be poorly crystalline.
By increasing the number of electrochemically active sites, the activity of a Co-OEC-based anode can be enhanced. In this case, moving from a flat two-dimensional electrode support to a three-dimensional open cell Ni foam serves to greatly enhance the catalyst loading and thus the number of available active sites per 2-D geometric surface area of the electrode.24
Depositions of the Co-OEC catalyst on Ni foam electrodes were performed at 1.1 V vs.Ag/AgCl in pH 8.5 solution where oxygen evolution is vigorous. Thus, the Faradaic efficiency of the electrodeposition process is far less than unity and precise quantification of the amount of Co2+ deposited on the Ni foam electrode was not possible using coulometry. SEM micrographs of the resulting electrode show that thick forest-like films of Co-OEC are deposited on the Ni foam matrix when 100 C cm−2 (geometric surface area) is allowed to pass during the deposition (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  
            SEM images (left, 110×, and right, 1400×) of a thick Co-OEC film on a Ni foam electrode. The film was deposited at 1.1 V vs.Ag/AgCl from a 10 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O solution in 0.1 M MePi buffer (pH 8.5). 
The Co-OEC/Ni foam anodes prepared in this manner were loaded into a custom in-house designed flow-through electrochemical cell (Fig. S1 and S2†). This setup provides a stable platform for evaluating the Co-OEC activity by fixing the positions of the porous working, Ag/AgCl reference, and the coiled Pt wire counter electrodes. The flowing electrolyte provides efficient mixing which helps to reduce pH drops at the anode and additionally aids in bubble management by sweeping oxygen gas bubbles from the micrometre sized pores of the Ni foam. In this configuration, a Co-OEC/Ni foam working electrode swept at 1 mV s−1 achieves a current density of 100 mA per geometric cm2 at an overpotential of 442 mV when using 1.0 M KPi electrolyte (thermostatted at 25 °C) at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 (Fig. 4, top).
 Fig. 4  (Top) Current vs. potential trace for a Co-OEC/Ni foam anode swept at a rate of 1 mV s−1 in a custom designed flow-through electrochemical cell. The Co-OEC anode achieves a current density of 100 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 442 mV using 1.0 M KPi electrolyte (pH 7.0) maintained at 25 °C with a flow rate of ∼100 mL min−1. (Bottom) Overpotential vs. time plot for a Co-OEC/Ni foam anode operated in a flow through cell using 1.0 M KBi electrolyte (pH 9.2) at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1. To achieve stable activity at 100 mA cm−2 the Co-OEC anode required an overpotential of 363 mV for most of the ∼90 h experiment. 
The overpotential decreases in the presence of 1.0 M KBi as the supporting electrolyte. In these experiments, the overpotential required to drive the Co-OEC/Ni foam anode at a fixed current density of 100 mA cm−2 was monitored over the course of extended electrolysis. After 24 h, the Co-OEC catalyst film on the Ni foam anode settles to an overpotential of 363 mV. At this overpotential, 100 mA per geometric cm2 activity is maintained at a nearly constant value for ∼65 h (Fig. 4, bottom). Experiments were ceased after 100 h, though the activity of the catalyst film is preserved for even longer periods of time. This result represents an approximate 200-fold activity enhancement from that described in the original report:4 100 mA cm−2 at η ≈ 360 mV (present) vs. ∼0.5 mA cm−2 at η ≈ 360 mV.

          Catalytic activity for Co-OEC in natural waters
The activity of Co-OEC/FTO anodes is tolerant to the presence of solution impurities found in natural water supplies. Catalyst activity of Co-OEC was compared to an anodized Ni electrode, similar to that used in commercial devices, in Charles River water and seawater. Fig. 5 plots the overpotential during a 4 h galvanostatic electrolysis at 1 mA cm−2 using a Co-OEC/FTO anode in 1 M KBi (pH 9.2) and an anodized Ni electrode in 1 M KOH (pH 13.6) prepared using various water supplies. The KBi solutions for Co-OEC and the 1 M KOH solutions of the Ni anodized electrode were prepared from 18 MΩ cm, Charles River, and seawater. Stable overpotential values are obtained for the anodized Ni and Co-OEC when operated in pure, 18 MΩ cm resistivity water at 380 and 460 mV, respectively. Significantly larger overpotential values are required to operate the anodized Ni electrode in Charles River and seawaters (540 and 570 mV, respectively). For the Ni anode the overpotential continues to increase with operation time, indicating that the electrode fouls. At long times, the overall performance of the Ni electrode is significantly reduced. These data suggest the formation and buildup of metal oxides and hydroxides, and organic carbon deposits during Charles River electrolysis, similar to what has been observed previously during the electrolysis of seawater.26–28 In contrast, the Co-OEC exhibits a modest increase in overpotential upon operation in Charles River and seawater, and the catalyst activity is stable over the duration of the 4 h electrolysis experiment.
 Fig. 5  
Bulk electrolysis profile of anodized Ni (left, 1 M KOH) and Co–Bi on ITO (right, 1 M KBi, pH 9.2) anodes in 18 MΩ cm (– – –), Charles River water (), and seawater (). Plots show the overpotential required for electrolysis at 1 mA cm−2 current density. 

Fig. 6 shows Tafel plots for each electrode before and after electrolysis in each water supply; Tafel slopes and exchange current densities are listed in Table S1†. The Tafel plots of Co-OEC and anodized Ni electrodes are unchanged for operation of the anodes in 18 MΩ cm water (black lines). These data are consistent with the water electrolysis results in Fig. 5 and indicate stable operation of each electrode in 18 MΩ cm water. Conversely, the operation of anodized Ni in both Charles River and seawaters results in an increase in the Tafel slope, indicating a decrease in anode performance in impure water compared to 18 MΩ cm water, again consistent with the electrolysis results of Fig. 5. Moreover, the Ni anode performance continues to decrease with electrolysis time. Over the course of the electrolysis, the overpotential required to operate the Ni electrode at 1 mA cm−2 current density increases from 540 to 620 mV in Charles River and from 570 to 650 mV in seawater. In contrast, only a modest increase in electrode overpotential after 4 h of electrolysis is observed for Co-OEC in 1 M KBi prepared using Charles River and seawaters (460 to 480 mV and 530 to 550 mV, respectively).

To test the resistance of each electrode to Ca2+ induced fouling, the electrolyte for Co-OEC and the anodized Ni electrodes were titrated with Ca2+ during electrolysis. As the concentration of Ca2+ increases from 0 to 500 µM, the overpotential for operation of the Ni anode in 1 M KOH at 1 mA cm−2 current density increases from 360 to 510 mV (Fig. 7). In contrast, titration of the 1 M KBi (pH 9.2) electrolyte over the same Ca2+ concentration range results in minor changes in the overpotential for operation of Co-OEC from 460 to 480 mV.

Conclusions
Initial reports of the discovery and function of the Co-OEC catalyst were focused on defining the science of the catalyst, not optimizing electrode performance. These reports show that the catalyst structure is composed of ordered units of molecular dimensions,29,30 detail the nature of the active species31 and shed insight on the mechanism of the oxygen evolving reaction.32 We now show that the performance of electrodes functionalized with the catalyst, as quantified by water-oxidation current density at fixed overpotential, can be increased by >200× while demonstrating exceptional operational stabilities simply by increasing the number of Co active sites with increased catalyst loading for a specific geometric electrode area and facilitating mass transport to and away from the electrode using a flow cell configuration. Additionally, operation at neutral and near neutral pHs may serve to reduce the formation of passivating oxide layers of indigenous metals commonly found in natural water supplies (e.g., Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, etc.) and inhibit denaturation of biomolecules. These processes are accelerated in caustic alkali and can lead to electrode deactivation. The ease of operation of anodes functionalized with the Co-OEC catalyst at appreciable geometric current density, together with its ability to be highly manufacturable,33 to operate in natural water sources and to require only a simple pressure membrane bodes well for the translation of this catalyst to a viable technology.

Broader context
Energy storage, when coupled to renewable generation, can transform society by providing carbon neutral, scalable, and sustainable energy anytime, anywhere, and at any scale. The conversion of intermittent electrical power from renewable generation sources, such as solar and wind, into renewable fuels presents a compelling storage solution. Recently we have begun investigating a cobalt-based oxygen evolving catalyst (Co-OEC) that affects the challenging energy storing reaction of water splitting. The Co-OEC catalyst is unique because it: (1) operates safely with high activity under benign conditions using inexpensive, earth abundant, and highly manufacturable materials, (2) is functional in unpurified, natural water streams and seawater, (3) is robust, self-healing and easy to use, (4) can form on diverse conducting surfaces of varying geometry and therefore can be easily interfaced with a variety of light absorbing and charge separating materials, (5) may be activated by solar-derived electricity or directly by sunlight mediated by a semiconductor, and (6) enables transformative small scale distributed energy models. The ease of operation of anodes functionalized with the Co-OEC catalyst at appreciable geometric current density together with its ability to operate in natural water sources bodes well for the translation of Co-OEC to a viable technology.

            SEM images (left, 110×, and right, 1400×) of a thick Co-OEC film on a Ni foam electrode. The film was deposited at 1.1 V vs.Ag/AgCl from a 10 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O solution in 0.1 M MePi buffer (pH 8.5).	 

 	Fig. 4  (Top) Current vs. potential trace for a Co-OEC/Ni foam anode swept at a rate of 1 mV s−1 in a custom designed flow-through electrochemical cell. The Co-OEC anode achieves a current density of 100 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 442 mV using 1.0 M KPi electrolyte (pH 7.0) maintained at 25 °C with a flow rate of ∼100 mL min−1. (Bottom) Overpotential vs. time plot for a Co-OEC/Ni foam anode operated in a flow through cell using 1.0 M KBi electrolyte (pH 9.2) at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1. To achieve stable activity at 100 mA cm−2 the Co-OEC anode required an overpotential of 363 mV for most of the ∼90 h experiment.
