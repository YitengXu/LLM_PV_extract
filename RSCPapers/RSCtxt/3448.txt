    , Accepted 21st March 2021First published on 22nd March 2021AbstractDesigning highly active electrocatalysts for both the oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions (OER and UOR) with good durability at large current densities is very significant for greatly reducing the power consumption of water electrolysis and wastewater degradation. However, very few electrocatalysts simultaneously exhibit outstanding catalytic activities and large-current durability for both the oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoporous Fe-rich nitride hybrid electrocatalyst possessing extraordinary catalytic OER and UOR activities, as evidenced by extremely small potentials of 1.518 and 1.372 V with impressive long-term durability at a current density of 500 mA cm−2 for both OER and UOR in base, respectively. Thus far, this is one of the best electrocatalysts embedding excellent OER and UOR properties in a single electrocatalyst. In particular, combined with an efficient NiMoO4–H2 catalyst for the HER, we have actualized the commercially viable current density of 500 mA cm−2 at 1.623 V and 1.472 V for overall water and urea electrolysis with outstanding long-term durability, respectively, outperforming most water or urea electrolysers reported hitherto. This work offers a novel approach to develop multifunctional electrocatalysts from earth-abundant elements for the energy-efficient hydrogen production and pollution treatment of urea-rich wastewater.
Introduction
The excessive exhaustion of fossil fuels accompanied by environmental pollution problems has led to an urgent need for exploring abundant, clean and renewable energy sources for replacing natural fossil fuels. Hydrogen is regarded as a promising alternative to fossil fuels in future due to its high energy density (142 MJ kg−1), abundant resources and environmentally friendly nature.1,2 Compared to traditional routes for H2 production by steam reforming and coal gasification, alkaline water electrolysis is a more environment-benign and sustainable technology that can efficiently convert renewable electricity from solar, wind or water energy resources into chemically storable H2 fuel without any carbon footprint.3–6 Even so, it remains a grand challenge for practical use due to its high thermodynamic voltage of 1.23 V and large electric power consumption (1.8–2.4 V, 200–400 mA cm−2), in which the main cause arises from the low catalytic activity of anodic oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts.7–10 Namely, the OER process is crucial for the energy conversion efficiency of alkaline water electrolysis, which is the main bottleneck precluding its practical application owing to the slow kinetics and high energy barriers.9,11–17 Thus, in order to give rise to cost-effective and energy-saving H2 production, the key lies in developing highly robust oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts or substituting for OER with other alternative anodic reactions with much lower theoretical oxidation potentials.7,18–22
The anodic electro-oxidation of several readily oxidized molecules such as methanol, hydrazine, and urea is a promising energy-efficient strategy to produce H2 because of their more favorable oxidization thermodynamics relative to the OER process.7,20–24 Among them, the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is rather attractive for the merit of degrading wastewater and producing clean H2 fuel concurrently,24–28 not to mention that urea is a promising hydrogen carrier and renewable fuel for long-term sustainable energy supply due to its stability, outstanding energy density and easy transportation. In particular, compared to the sluggish OER process, the anodic UOR process is a more favorable chemical reaction at the anode, in that its theoretical cell potential (0.37 V) is much lower than that (1.23 V) for the OER.7,9,29 However, UOR is still subjected to sluggish kinetics due to a six-electron transfer process involvement and complicated steps for gas evolution. Indeed, significant advances have been witnessed recently on the developments of non-noble catalysts for boosting sluggish UOR kinetics, such as transition metal oxides,24,30–32 nitrides,33 sulfides,26,34 and phosphides.25,35 Unfortunately, very few non-noble electrocatalysts simultaneously possess superb catalytic performance for both the OER and UOR at large current densities (≥500 mA cm−2). Usually, nearly all of them show far better UOR properties than those of OER.7,35 In particular, the majority of non-precious electrocatalysts present good durability at a low current density like 10 mA cm−2, but it is still unknown whether they can withstand the electrochemical corrosion at large current densities with remarkable operational durability, which is a more practically relevant value in the industry. Thus, these available electrocatalysts are still far from being developed for practical use.
Considering that most non-noble electrocatalysts are very active for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media,36,37 rather than in base, and the OER or UOR catalysts are more favourable in base,35,38,39 it is highly paramount to design and construct multifunctional inexpensive electrocatalysts for lowering the energy barriers of OER and UOR as well as HER towards more energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen generation in a basic environment. In view of these points, iron and nickel-based bimetallic compounds are promising candidates as multifunctional electrocatalysts since iron is a promising enhancer for the catalytic activity.13,38 To this end, we designed robust and highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts by in situ formation of NixFeN/Ni3N (x = 1 or 3) nanoparticles on a Ni foam, which is demonstrated to be very efficient for driving the sluggish OER and UOR kinetics as well as the HER in base. More specifically, benefiting from the metallic feature of metal nitrides, three-dimensional nanoporous structures, and strong synergistic effects between different components at the interface, the NixFeN/Ni3N hybrid exhibits excellent catalytic performance for both OER and UOR in terms of extremely low potentials of 1.518 and 1.372 V at 500 mA cm−2, respectively, and only about 91 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2 for the HER in base. When coupled with another efficient HER catalyst of NiMoO4–H2 (ref. 4 and 7) for two-electrode electrolyzers, the urea electrolyzer requires very low voltages of 1.472 and 1.529 V to afford current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2, respectively, which are record performance indices reported as yet for alkaline urea electrolysis, and are reduced by 151 and 160 mV relative to those of water electrolyzers at 500 and 1000 mA cm−2, respectively. More interestingly, this hybrid electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional operational durability at large current densities above 500 mA cm−2 for the OER and UOR without noticeable activity losses during 50 h operation. All these information demonstrate the remarkable bifunctional catalytic activity of this bimetallic nitride hybrid electrocatalyst for driving the slow kinetics of OER, UOR and HER, which are promising for cost-effective and energy-saving H2 production.
Results and discussion
The formation process of the NixFeN/Ni3N hybrid catalyst involves two critical steps including surface modification of commercial Ni foams with iron nitrate precursors and subsequent thermal nitridation in a tube furnace. More specifically, in the first step, the iron precursor was first modified onto a piece of commercial Ni foam, which was dried in air at room temperature, followed by thermal nitridation in NH3 environment at 400 °C. In the second step, similar processes involving surface modification and thermal nitridation were repeated, so as to obtain a uniform NixFeN/Ni3N hybrid electrocatalyst and greatly expose Fe-based active sites at the surface (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, as revealed by typical scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images in Fig. 1b–d, the as-prepared hybrid catalyst is constructed by numerous intimately interconnected nanoparticles forming nanoporous structures covered on the Ni foam with high crystallinity. The abundant porous channels would greatly expose the active sites, provide a high surface-to-volume ratio, and facilitate the diffusion of the reactants and gas products, thereby accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics for water or urea electrolysis.8,36,38 In particular, the high crystallinity and interfacial structures between NixFeN and Ni3N were further examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1e–g). According to the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1f and g), we can clearly resolve many distinctive crystal stripes with interplanar spacings of 0.204, 0.225 and 0.217 nm corresponding to the facets (111) of the Ni3N, (101) of NiFeN, and (111) of Ni3FeN crystals, respectively, manifesting the high crystallinity of the as-prepared nitride particles.

(f and g) Typical HRTEM images taken from the NixFeN/Ni3N cat1alysts. 
To further analyse the chemical composition and crystal phases of the resultant samples, we conducted additional structural characterizations on the basis of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is obvious that all the prominent diffraction peaks appearing in the typical XRD pattern (Fig. 2a) can well match with the characteristic ones of Ni3FeN, Ni3N, NiFeN and metallic Ni crystals. More specifically, excluding three strong peaks from the Ni foam support, these diffraction peaks located at 41.485°, 48.259° and 70.534° could be attributed to the signals from Ni3FeN (PDF #50-1434) crystals,12 while other strong diffraction peaks at 38.94°, 44.484° and 58.518° could be mainly indexed to those of Ni3N (PDF #10-0280) crystals.33 Thus, the main phases of the as-prepared samples are composed of Ni3N, Ni3FeN and Ni foams as well as a minor amount of NiFeN (PDF #14-0129), which is consistent with the TEM analysis. Meanwhile, elaborate XPS analysis was performed to further probe the elemental composition and valence states of the electrocatalyst (Fig. 2b–d). In line with the XRD and TEM analysis, this hybrid catalyst is mainly composed of Ni, Fe, N and O elements on the basis of the survey spectrum (Fig. S1†). In particular, according to the high-resolution XPS spectra, it is prominent that two characteristic binding energies located at 852.74 and 870.14 eV for Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 corroborate the formation of Ni–N on the catalyst surface33 (Fig. 2b), while these two characteristic XPS peaks appearing at 707.0 and 720.0 eV derived from Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 are related to the Fe–N bond formation40 (Fig. 2c). Combined with the main N 1s peak appearing at 397.6 eV (Fig. 2d), all the XPS observations suggest the successful conversion of nickel or iron oxides into metal nitrides after thermal nitridation. Note that there are still some new prominent peaks detected at 855.58 eV and 873.18 eV (Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2), 711.9 and 725 eV (Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2), suggesting that some oxidized Ni–O or Fe–O species are formed on the catalyst surface possibly due to surface partial oxidation when the samples are exposed to the air.38,40 Thus, according to the detailed XRD and XPS analysis, we can conclude that a hybrid catalyst composed of Ni3FeN, NiFeN and Ni3N is obtained by our two-step growth procedures.

Obviously, this hybrid catalyst would possess the following advantages. First, the high porosity of the Ni foam and surface hybrids provides high electrochemical surface area for the electrocatalysts, which will lead to the exposure of abundant active sites for electrochemical reactions and facilitate the exchange of reactants and gas release. Second, the Ni foam would react with iron nitrate at the surface, directly providing the nickel source for growing Ni3N and Ni3FeN and exposing Fe sites. This process makes the surface electrocatalyst intimately contact the underlying Ni foam support, which is very helpful to enhance the electrochemical stability of the hybrid catalyst, especially at large current densities. Finally, the Ni foam and metal nitrides41,42 have good conductivity, which is beneficial for fast charge transfer between the support and surface electrocatalysts. All of these advantages would facilitate the reaction kinetics of this hybrid catalyst, thus contributing to its superb catalytic activities in base.8,13,36,38 To prove this point, we first assessed its OER performance in 1 M KOH using a three-electrode arrangement. As shown in Fig. 3a and S2,† the NixFeN/Ni3N electrode exhibits outstanding catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution demanding only an overpotential of 258 mV at 100 mA cm−2, which is superior to the benchmark IrO2 (366 mV), Ni3N-1 (397 mV), Ni3N-2 (379 mV) and Ni foam (471 mV) electrodes. This overpotential is still much lower than most of the non-noble electrocatalysts (Table S1†) including metal phosphides, sulfides and selenides. In particular, this catalyst demands an overpotential of 288 mV to supply a practical current density of 500 mA cm−2, which reaches the strict industrial criteria for water electrolysis, but still not so competitive for commercial use relative to other catalysts.8,38 More impressively, once 0.5 M urea is added into the electrolyte, its catalytic activity becomes more remarkable for driving the UOR (Fig. 3b and S2†), featured by an ultralow potential of 1.372 V to afford 500 mA cm−2 and extremely fast electrode dynamics (Fig. S3†), substantially lower than the one for the OER and that of the Ni foam (Fig. S4†). This performance also outperforms the best non-precious OER and UOR catalysts hitherto (Tables S1 and S2†), and the Ni3N reference catalyst (Fig. 3a, b and S5†). Moreover, it is noted that the NixFeN/Ni3N hybrids using two-step nitridation show much better OER and UOR activities than those using one-step nitridation (Fig. S6†). These observations support that iron is a good enhancer for boosting the slow OER and UOR kinetics of Ni-based compounds. Finally, this NixFeN/Ni3N hybrid is very active and stable toward the HER requiring as low as 91 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2 in base (Fig. S7†). Thus, this hybrid catalyst is effective to drive the OER, UOR and HER simultaneously.

(b) Polarization curves of the NixFeN/Ni3N electrode for the OER and UOR in 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea. (c) Chronopotentiometry tests on the NixFeN/Ni3N electrode for the OER at current densities of 50, 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 (inset: comparison of the polarization curves before and after 1000 mA cm−2 stability test). (d) Stability test of this hybrid catalyst for the UOR at 500 mA cm−2 (inset: 1000 mA cm−2). 
Electrochemical durability at large current densities is a significant performance criterion to rate an electrocatalyst for practical H2 production. Unfortunately, various UOR or OER electrocatalysts reported so far are tested at a relatively low current density of 10 mA cm−2 for stability examination, not to mention even larger current densities (≥500 mA cm−2) toward the practical use.9,13,38 In the light of these obstacles, we further examined the stability of the catalyst under constant-current operation. Notably, as confirmed by chronopotentiometry tests and steady polarization curves after durability tests, the electrocatalytic activity of the NixFeN/Ni3N electrode can be well maintained for over 40 h with negligible variation at 50, 500 and 1000 mA cm−2, indicative of its eminent durability for the OER (Fig. 3c). It is particularly impressive that our catalyst shows amazing stability at large current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 for more than 20 h for the UOR, corroborating that its superb catalytic activity can be sustained upon UOR testing (Fig. 3d). Finally, to gain further insights into the effects of the concentrations of the iron precursor and the nitridation temperature on the final catalytic activities (Fig. S8†), we conducted additional controllable experiments, such as changing the iron concentrations, 0.08, 0.1 and 0.15 g mL−1, and tuning the growth temperature, 350, 380, 400 and 430 °C. It is determined that the optimal calcination temperature is 400 °C, and the optimal concentration 0.1 g mL−1. Therefore, this concentration and temperature is used for further analyses, unless otherwise specified. All of these results establish the strong electrochemical durability of this catalyst for both the OER and UOR in base. To the best of our knowledge, it is probably one of the best electrocatalysts for driving the UOR and OER concurrently with outstanding catalytic activities and large current durability hitherto.
We next turn to figure out the underlying reasons that govern the remarkable catalytic activities of this electrocatalyst. In order to distinguish whether the active surface area contributes dominantly to the final activity,9,13,38 we extracted the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and normalized the polarization curves by Cdl values (Fig. S9 and S10†). It is clearly seen that even after normalization by Cdl difference, the current densities of the NixFeN/Ni3N hybrid are still much larger than those of the Ni3N support (Fig. S11†), manifesting that this NixFeN/Ni3N hybrid has better intrinsic activity than the Ni3N-2 catalyst, and that the introduction of iron elements into the sample can promote the UOR and OER reaction kinetics in base. Thus, the electrode activity mainly arises from the cooperative effects between the active surface area and synergistic effects between NixFeN and Ni3N. Meanwhile, according to the electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. S12†), both the series (Rs) and charge-transfer (Rct) resistances of NixFeN/Ni3N are much smaller than pure Ni3N-2, which is responsible for its faster OER or UOR kinetics probably due to the metallic feature and strong interfacial interactions between NixFeN particles and Ni3N support.38
To gain a deep insight into the real active sites, we performed SEM, EDX spectra, XRD, and XPS analysis (Fig. 4) on post-OER or post-UOR samples to examine the morphologies, surface chemical composition and elemental valence states. As reported in our previous reports,13,38 due to the large anodic potentials, the electrocatalyst was oxidized at the surface during the OER or UOR electrocatalysis, thereby leading to the surface reconstruction of the catalyst into thin nanosheets (Fig. 4a). Meanwhile, XRD was employed to examine the crystal structures of the post-OER or post-UOR samples, in which we clearly observe the much weaker intensities of the characteristic XRD peaks in the XRD patterns than those of the original one (Fig. 4b), demonstrating that the surface oxidized and etched species are probably amorphous during oxygen electrocatalysis. Furthermore, elaborate XPS analysis was conducted after OER or UOR testing (Fig. 4c–f). Prominently, the shifts of Ni or Fe valence states to higher binding energies, the disappearance of the Fe–N or Ni–N bonds (Fig. 4c and d) and the appearance of the N–O bond at around 403.5 eV (Fig. 4e) are detected in their XPS spectra, which is further supported by the O 1s spectra (Fig. 4f). These XPS analyses (Fig. 4c–f), combined with the XRD spectra (Fig. 4b), the increased oxygen elemental and decreased iron atomic ratio in the EDX spectra under different conditions (Fig. S13†), further verify the inevitable conversion of surface nitrides into amorphous Ni–Fe oxides/oxyhydroxides at the surface of the NixFeN/Ni3N hybrid during the OER or UOR testing at high anodic potentials. Therefore, all of these observations corroborate that the in situ formed amorphous Ni–Fe oxides/oxyhydroxides at the catalyst surface are the real active sites for oxygen electrocatalysis, which is well consistent with previous reports.13,38,43

Given that the NixFeN/Ni3N hybrid exhibits remarkable activity and stability toward both OER and UOR, it is essential to construct a two-electrode electrolyzer for H2 production at extremely large current densities.43 We employed this hybrid catalyst as the anode for OER or UOR, and paired it with another robust NiMoO4–H2 electrocatalyst4,7 for cathodic HER (Fig. S14†). Notably, this two-electrode electrolyzer shows excellent overall splitting activities in both the urea electrolysis and water electrolysis in base (Fig. 5a and S15†), which only requires 1.576 and 1.373 V to deliver 200 mA cm−2 for the water and urea electrolysis, respectively, considerably lower than 1.797 V of the coupled benchmark IrO2(+)/Pt(−) pair electrolyzer.37 In particular, compared to water electrolysis, there is a sharp decrease in the cell voltages at large current densities for urea electrolysis. To drive the electrolysis at current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2, the cell voltages of water electrolysis are around 1.623 and 1.689 V, successively, whereas the cell voltages of urea electrolysis are dramatically decreased to 1.472 and 1.529 V (Fig. 5b). These cell voltages, especially the ones for urea electrolysis, even surpass the industrial scale (2.4 V, 400 mA cm−2) for H2 production, and are record performance metrics for urea electrolysis, which outperforms nearly all the electrolyzers based on alkaline urea or water electrolysis (Fig. 5c, d and Table S3†), including NiFe LDH(+)//Ni@Cr2O3(−) (∼1.67 V at 500 mA cm−2), np-Co1.04Fe0.96P(+)//np-Co1.04Fe0.96P(−) (∼1.743 V at 500 mA cm−2) and NiFe LDH(+)//NiO/Ni-CNT(−) (∼1.667 V at 200 mA cm−2) for water electrolysis,44–46 and NiMoO–Ar(+)//NiMoO–H2(−) (∼1.55 V at 100 mA cm−2) and CoS2–MoS2(+)//CoS2–MoS2(−) (∼1.575 V at 200 mA cm−2) for urea electrolysis.7,26

(e and f) Durability tests of the (e) water and (f) urea electrolyzers at a constant current density of 500 mA cm−2. 
Large-current operation with good durability is very essential to alkaline electrolyzers when employed for large-scale H2 production.13,38 Impressively, according to the chronopotentiometry tests, it is worth mentioning that, not only the water electrolyzer, but also the urea electrolyzer performs energetically and shows strong capability of sustaining their outstanding performances with no sign of decay for over 50 h when operated at 500 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5e and f), suggesting excellent durability during large-current operation. Overall, all these information betoken that this NixFeN/Ni3N hybrid catalyst is the only one resistant to large-current electrochemical corrosion at the anode for both the OER and UOR, further providing strong support for maintaining the remarkable catalytic activities of alkaline water or urea electrolyzer at large current densities.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of Ni3FeN or NiFeN nanoparticles on the Ni3N/Ni support with high porosity by simple nitridation, which is proven to be very active and stable for driving the HER, OER, and UOR in base, featured by only 1.518 and 1.372 V to afford 500 mA cm−2 with excellent durability for the OER and UOR in base, respectively. When employed as an electrode material for the anode, the as-obtained water/urea electrolyzer requires extremely low cell voltages of 1.623/1.472 V to deliver a commercially practical current density of 500 mA cm−2 in base with superb stability. This is possibly the only UOR catalyst with excellent activity and durability at large current densities, and the cell voltages are record performance metrics for urea electrolysis, which surpasses nearly all the electrolyzers based on urea or water electrolysis, paving a new way for cost-effective and energy-saving H2 generation.
Experimental
Synthesis of the NixFeN/Ni3N (x = 1 or 3) hybrid catalyst
A two-step nitridation process was utilized to synthesize this material. In the first nitridation process, a fresh Ni foam was successively washed in a 3 M HCl aqueous solution, ethanol and deionized (DI) water for 10 minutes, which was then immersed into the iron nitrate precursor for several seconds. After drying in air, the pre-modified Ni foam was placed in a tube furnace for thermal nitridation at 400 °C for 2 h. In the second nitridation process, we just put the nitride sample into the same iron precursor for a second modification, and then performed similar nitridation in the tube furnace. During material synthesis, a high-purity Ar gas was continuously purged into the quartz tube, and 100 sccm NH3 served as the nitrogen source. To optimize the catalytic activities for the OER and UOR, we have tuned the nitridation temperature (350 °C, 380 °C, 400 °C, and 430 °C), and the concentrations of the iron precursor (0.08, 0.1 and 0.15 g mL−1). The optimal temperature and concentration were determined to be 400 °C and 0.1 g mL−1, respectively, which were utilized as the main conditions for performance analysis unless otherwise specified.
Synthesis of NiMoO4–H2 on the Ni foam
NiMoO4-precursor nanorods were synthesized on a Ni foam by a hydrothermal method.4 The starting precursors containing Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.04 M) and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.01 M) were directly dissolved in 20 mL of H2O in a Teflon autoclave and then a clean Ni foam was placed in it. The autoclave was well sealed and heated to 150 °C for 6 h in a drying oven. The foam was taken out and cleaned by DI water for several minutes. Subsequently, the NiMoO4-precursor was treated at 500 °C for 2 h under mixed 92 sccm Ar/8 sccm H2 gas, and then the NiMoO4–H2 samples can be obtained.
Preparation of the IrO2 catalyst on a Ni foam
The IrO2 powder was purchased from Alfa Aesar (99%). A homogeneous dispersion was prepared by mixing 0.178 mmol IrO2, 60 μL Nafion, 540 μL ethanol, and 400 μL DI water (Hitech Master-S15, 18.2 MΩ cm resistivity), which was then ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then, the IrO2 working electrode was made by depositing the IrO2 catalyst on the Ni foam.
Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical tests were performed at room temperature. The OER and UOR testing was carried out using a standard three-electrode system on an electrochemical workstation (Gamry, Reference 3000 or 600+) with the as-prepared sample, Hg/HgO and a platinum wire used as the self-standing working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All the potentials were referenced to a reversible hydrogen electrode RHE by adding 0.924 V according to the Nernst equation in 1 M KOH. Before data collection, the working electrodes were first activated by 50 CV tests. The CV and LSV experiments were run with and without 0.5 M urea in 1 M KOH in a potential window between 0.2 and 0.68 V vs. Hg/HgO. The water and urea electrolysis was carried out in a two-electrode setup using NF/NiMoO4–H2 as the cathode and NixFeN/Ni3N as the anode. The polarization curves for the UOR and urea/water electrolysis were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, while other polarization curves were obtained by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at 2 mV s−1 before stability tests. The impedance was conducted with the frequencies changing from 0.1 to 105 Hz.
