    , Accepted 4th November 2013First published on 5th November 2013AbstractCuIn1−xAlxSe2 (CIASe) thin films were grown by a simple sol–gel route followed by annealing under vacuum. Parameters related to the spin–orbit (ΔSO) and crystal field (ΔCF) were determined using a quasi-cubic model. Highly oriented (002) aluminum doped (2%) ZnO, 100 nm thin films, were co-sputtered for CuIn1−xAlxSe2/AZnO based solar cells. Barrier height and ideality factor varied from 0.63 eV to 0.51 eV and 1.3186 to 2.095 in the dark and under 1.38 A.M 1.5 solar illumination respectively. Current–voltage characteristics carried out at 300 K were confined to a triangle, exhibiting three limiting conduction mechanisms: Ohms law, trap-filled limit curve and SCLC, with 0.2 V being the cross-over voltage, for a quadratic transition from Ohm's to Child's law. Visible photodetection was demonstrated with a CIASe/AZO photodiode configuration. Photocurrent was enhanced by one order from 3 × 10−3 A in the dark at 1 V to 3 × 10−2 A upon 1.38 sun illumination. The optimized photodiode exhibits an external quantum efficiency of over 32% to 10% from 350 to 1100 nm at high intensity 17.99 mW cm−2 solar illumination. High responsivity Rλ ∼ 920 A W−1, sensitivity S ∼ 9.0, specific detectivity D* ∼ 3 × 1014 Jones, make CIASe a potential absorber for enhancing the forthcoming technological applications of photodetection.
Introduction
CuInSe2 (CIS) absorber, with a direct band gap of 1.0 eV and an absorption coefficient1 of 3.6 × 105 cm−1, has attained a good conversion efficiency of 15% in thin film solar cells. Alloying the CIS system with III A group elements like Al, or Ga can tune the band gap of CIS semiconductors. CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGS) optical window could be graded from 1.0 eV to 1.7 eV by varying R = Ga/(Ga + In) (increased Ga doping, R being 0.5 and Eg = 1.3 eV) which was found to limit the efficiency of CIGS (maximum efficiency attained with R as 0.3 and Eg = 1.15 eV), due to the defect concentrations and hence the recombination.2 CuIn1−xAlxSe2 (CIASe) is a potential candidate in thin film solar cells3,4 and light emitting diodes, owing to its band gap tunability from 1 eV (CuInSe2) to 2.7 eV (CuAlSe2).5 Material usage in CIASe alloying can be minimized when compared to the CIGS system for band gap modulation. Hence CIASe thin films are active in current research. Very recently a highly sensitive CIASe based metal–semiconductor–metal based infra-red photodetector has been reported.6 Fabrication of sensitive photonic devices usually employs high cost vacuum based physical vapor deposition techniques like molecular beam epitaxy,7 DC and RF sputtering,8 evaporation9,10etc. Moreover, phase formation of the chalcopyrite system involving either in situ or external annealing in the selenization source11 is always challenging. Therefore soft and non-vacuum based chemical approaches should provide economical and easy fabrication. In the present work CIASe films were grown from the sol by spin-coating followed by annealing at 450 °C under vacuum.
Experimental
Device fabrication
Deposition of CIASe thin films involved pre-cleaning of the soda lime glass (SLG) substrates, briefly (a) detergent cleaning, (b) boiling in acetone, methanol, isopropanol and de-ionised water at 150 °C respectively each for 15 min, (c) finally drying under nitrogen. CIASe sol was prepared from copper chloride (CuCl), aluminum chloride (AlCl3), indium chloride (InCl3) and thiourea (CS(NH2)2). Initially stoichiometric cationic solutions were prepared in 2-methoxyethanol (C3H8O2) and ethanolamine (C2H7NO) stabilizer, upon vigorous stirring. Desired CIASe film thickness was obtained by spin casting the sol at 1500 rpm for 30 s in nitrogen atmosphere in a glove box. As-obtained CIASe films were annealed under vacuum at 450 °C. CIASe films with 500 nm thickness were used in the device fabrication. Highly oriented aluminum doped (2%) ZnO, 100 nm thin films, were co-sputtered for CuIn1−xAlxSe2/AZnO based solar cells. Thermally evaporated aluminum, masked with pads of 500 μm circular diameter, was used for metallization. Three such devices were tested for photoapplications under a solar A.M 1.5 lamp, with a KG5 filtered lamp source, optimized with a NREL calibrated Si reference cell (oriel P/N-91150 V) to 100 mW cm−2 (one sun calibration). CIASe films with 20% and 30% Al doping were denoted as CIASe-20 and CIASe-30 respectively.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 advance X-ray powder diffractometer, with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with 2θ ranging from 20° to 70°. A field emission scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Gemini FESEM) was used to investigate the morphological aspects. Transmittance was recorded by an Ocean Optics S2000 spectrophotometer. Steady state photoresponse measurements were carried out using a Keithley source meter (model SMU-2420) and an Oriel Sol-3A solar simulator.
Results and discussion
X-ray diffraction
All the Bragg reflections in the XRD diffraction patterns (Fig. 1) were indexed to the chalcopyrite CuInSe2 tetragonal system (JCPDS ref. file no. 01-075-0107), space group 12d, with the lattice parameters ‘a’ and ‘c’ as 5.7730 Å and 11.550 Å respectively. Decrease in the lattice parameter ‘a’ and (112) peak position shifting (0.2° for CIAS-20 film compared to standard CIS) to higher angles, with the aluminium content, can be attributed to the lattice spacing shrinking of the (112) orientation (0.02 Å for CIAS-20 film) as per Vegard's law. Moreover the higher angle scattering could also be due to the intrinsic strain release in the film.12 The orientation of a particular plane was quantified using the texture coefficients (TChkl) calculated using eqn (1). Fig. 2 shows the TChkl values for different planes; it was observed that plane (204) showed higher TChkl value than the strong reflection (112). TChkl values obtained for CIASe-20 were smaller in comparison to CIASe-30. In general such deviations could be due to the increase in the structural factor or induced lattice deformation.13 (1)Ihkl is the obtained intensity of the (hkl) diffraction peak and Io(hkl) is the relative intensity of the JCPDS standard reference file. Strain and dislocation densities were calculated using the relations14 and were found to be minimal, suggesting the obtained films were strain free. Crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer relation15 (eqn (2)): (2)where D is the grain size of crystallite, λ (1.5405 Å) is the wavelength of X-rays used, β is the full width at its half maximum (FWHM) in radians and θ is the angle of diffraction.

Morphology and topographical investigations

Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the films selenized at 450 °C, for two different  concentrations. CIASe thin films with densely packed columnar shaped grains were observed. Grain sizes varied with  ratio, for instance in the case of x = 0.2, columnar grains in the range of 200 nm to 600 nm and for x = 0.3, columnar grains in the range 500 nm to 1 μm were observed. It is to be noted that the grain sizes in the order of the layer thickness would enhance the electronic properties of polycrystalline solar cells, as the detrimental grain boundaries would be decreased besides benefiting the efficient collection of charge carriers. Compositional uniformity of the film was confirmed with EDAX performed on the different sized grains, therefore the segregation of any secondary phases could therefore be ruled out. A similar result was also observed from the atomic force micrographs shown in Fig. S1 and S2† for CIASe-20 and CIASe-30 respectively. Though the average roughness was found to vary from 42.32 nm to 71.23 nm but the films showed lower root mean square (rms) roughness values between 5.79 and 6.14 for x = 0.2 and x = 0.3 respectively, within the tolerable limits for the formation of good heterojunctions.

Optical band gap measurements
CIASe is a potential candidate in the thin film solar cells and in photodetection applications, owing to its high absorption coefficient ∼10−4 cm−1 (α was calculated from spectral transmittance) in the visible spectrum. The log α vs. hυ plot exhibited three different absorption processes occurring in three distinct regions as marked in the plot (Fig. 4a). The indirect or direct transition nature of a semiconductor can be determined using the relation16 (eqn (3)): α = A(hυ − Eg)n/hυ(3)where A and h are constants, hυ is the energy of the photon, and Eg is the band gap. n is considered to be 1/2 for the directly allowed transitions and 2 for the indirectly allowed transitions. The plot of (αhυ)2versus photon energy (hυ) and its linear extrapolation over the photon energy axis determined the band gap in the fundamental absorption region. The band gaps Eg1, Eg2 and Eg3 calculated (Fig. 4b–d) following the previous reports17 were found to be 1.39 ± 0.02 eV, 1.42 ± 0.02 eV and 1.55 ± 0.02 eV respectively. It was observed that band gap increased with aluminum alloying. The band gap values obtained for  = 0.2 and 0.3 were consistent with the reported literature values.

Luminescence was excited at 325 nm (3.8 eV) and spectra were measured over the wavelength range from 350 nm to 850 nm as shown in Fig. 5. The photoluminescence recorded at different temperatures from the junction showed strong emission in the visible region, both at lower cryogenic temperatures of 77 K and at room temperature. This results further confirms the possibility of a Cu(In,Al)Se2/AZnO based visible photodetector. Photoluminescence spectra showed a red shift at lower temperatures.

Crystal field and spin–orbit parameters
A1–B3–C2 (1, 3 and 2 refer to the periodic table group numbers) types of compounds rest in the chalcopyrite crystal system. Reduction in the energy gap, upon moving from the analogous zinc blende to the chalcopyrite structure, would be due to the p and d orbitals interaction/hybridization possessing the same symmetry,18 for anion and cations respectively. Nevertheless the displacement of an anion from its ideal position in the zinc blende structure would also contribute to the reduction of the energy gap.19 Crystal field and spin–orbit splitting would govern the degeneracy of energy level splitting in the valence band. Molecular orbital considerations allow the degenerate triplet Γ15V in the valence band, and the formation of an upper antibonding state and a lower bonding state constituting the anion p-orbitals and cation d orbitals respectively, i.e., splitting into two levels Γ4V, Γ5V which in turn are non-degenerate and degenerate respectively. Degenerate level Γ5V further splits due to the spin–orbit interactions to Γ6V5, Γ7V5 levels. Upper antibonding state Γ4V goes to the Γ7V4 state due to spin–orbit interaction. Overall the schematic energy band diagram (Fig. 6) for the chalcopyrite system shows the three allowed transitions namely from (a) Γ7V4 to Γ6C1 (A-transition), (b) Γ6V5 to Γ6C1 (B-transition), (c) Γ7V5 to Γ6C1 (C-transition). A, B, C transitions correspond to the three energy band gaps Eg1, Eg2, Eg3 respectively as obtained for the CIASe system. Substitution of trigonal distortion (wurtzite compounds) for the tetragonal distortion (chalcopyrite compounds) led Rowe and Shay20 to propose a model, considering the Hopfield quasi-cubic model.21 According to the Hopfield model the splitting due to the trigonal uniaxial stress in zinc blende compounds and the crystal field splitting in wurtzite compounds are considered to be equivalent.
 Fig. 6  Schematic energy band diagram22 for the chalcopyrite system showing the three allowed transitions. 
Parameters related to the spin–orbit (ΔSO) and crystal field (ΔCF) can be experimentally calculated (eqn (4)) considering the three levels lying in the uppermost region of valence band, in the limit of the quasi-cubic model. (4)Using the equations E1 = Eg2 − Eg1, E2 = Eg2 − Eg3, E1 = 0.03 eV and E2 = −0.13 eV, values obtained were ΔSO = 0.15 eV and ΔCF = −0.05 eV. The obtained parameters were well in accordance with the reported literature.22 Similar results were reported earlier by varying the  concentrations. The valence band maximum due to crystal field splitting can be described by the relation23 (eqn (5)): (5)where  is the tetragonal distortion along the c-axis, calculated in our case to be 1.98. ‘b’ is the negative deformation potential found to be −3.0 eV. The tetragonal compression  was found to be 0.01.
Current–voltage characteristics of CIASe/AZnO heterostructures
Current–voltage characteristics of the CIASe/AZnO heterostructures were studied using a Keithley source measurement unit (SMU-2400) and a probe station. The unit was interfaced with the computer using a GPIB card, standard IEEE-488 to the Oriel Sol-3A solar simulator. The schematic device configuration used for transport characterization is shown in Fig. 7. Photoresponse measurements were carried out on x = 0.3 aluminum alloyed CIASe thin film.

Fig. 8 shows the current–voltage characteristics of CIASe/AZnO, junction measured at 300 K, in darkness and at different sun illuminations. Current increased exponentially in forward bias and a small amount of current, called reverse current, flowed through the diode in the reverse bias. Diode parameters such as barrier height, ideality factor, series resistance, shunt resistance and reverse saturation current were calculated. Ideality factor and series resistance were calculated at forward bias, whereas reverse saturation current and shunt resistance were calculated at reverse bias conditions. The series resistance can be determined (eqn (6)) from the I–V curves, as proposed by Kaminski et al.:24 I = Is[eα(V − IRs) − 1](6)where Rs is the series resistance, α = q/nkT is the coefficient of the exponent, Is is the reverse saturation current and n is an ideality factor. Lower series resistance has a direct impact on fill factor and efficiency of the thin film solar cells. Shunt resistance (Rsh) was calculated from the reciprocal of slope at reverse bias and was found to be 1 kΩ. Increase in the shunt resistance with increase in the intensity or the number of sun illuminations could be attributed to the enhanced shunt paths at the edges due to the diffusion. Current–voltage behavior of the heterojunction was analyzed by using the standard single carrier thermionic emission eqn (7):25 (7) (8)where A* is the Richardson constant, A is the area of the heterojunction, T is temperature in Kelvin, ϕb is the barrier height and k is the Boltzmann constant. Ideality factors (IF) and barrier heights (BH) of the heterojunction were calculated (Fig. 9a and 9b) from the slope and intercepts (linear fit) of log I–V plots, using eqn (9) and (10) respectively. Insets of Fig. 9 (9b′, 9b′′) show the variation of ideality factor with barrier height and intensity of illumination. (9) (10)

As-calculated barrier height (BH) and ideality factor (IF) values were found to decrease from 0.6 to 0.5142 and increase from 1.3186 to 2.095 respectively. It is to be noted that the recombination of charge carriers in the depletion region would result in the ideality factor exceeding unity. The slope calculated at the lower bias from the log J–log V plot (Fig. 10b) approached unity, whereas at a higher bias the slope exceeded unity, indicating a power law dependence which in general is a characteristic of typical space charge limited conduction (SCLC). The SCLC constitutes three limiting mechanisms:26 (a) Ohm's law, (b) trap-filled limit, (c) Child's law. At lower bias, the thermally excited electrons, located in the bulk of the semiconductor, populate much higher compared to the injection from the semiconductor and would contribute to the flow of current. In a situation when the carrier density injected from electrodes exceeds the thermal equilibrium carrier density of the material, typical SCLC would be observed. At higher bias, due to the high injected carrier density SCLC dominates the conduction, in which the carriers accumulate at the electrodes and form a space-charge region, thereby affecting the electrical distribution. In the lower voltage regime, current I varied linearly with applied bias V indicating an ohmic behavior, which can be modelled by using eqn (11): (11)where no is the charge carrier density, q is the electronic charge, V is the applied voltage, μ is the carrier mobility and d is the film thickness. For SCLC observed in the semiconductors without traps, the log J–log V plot would result in a slope of 2, following the Mott–Gurney law as described by eqn (12): (12)
 Fig. 10  Log J–log V plots showing current–voltage transport behavior. (a) Overall triangular confinement of space-charge phenomenon, (b) Ohmic regime, (c) trap-limit SCLC regime, (d) Child's law regime. 
The Mott–Gurney law (J ∝ Vm) deviates when the exponent m exceeds 2. As depicted in the current–voltage characteristics, region-2 (Fig. 10c) showed a slope greater than 2, which can be explained by considering the trap-limited SCLC. When the traps which are lying deeper compared to those of Ohm’s law are fully filled, injected electrons would experience repulsion. Upon further increasing the voltage, at a particular threshold voltage (VTFL), which in general depends upon the population of the traps present in the material, the repulsion would be overcome. After this voltage (eqn (14)) a sudden increase of current is observed indicating trap-limited SCLC,27 which can be mathematically modelled by eqn (13): (13)where Nv is the valence band effective density of states, H is the total trap concentration and l = Et/kbT where Et is the energy related to the trap distribution decay. (14)
Reduction in the slope for the log J–log V plot results in a higher bias as shown in region 3 (Fig. 10d), indicates the trap filling and a transition to a quadratic dependence of current on voltage as in the Mott–Gurney law.28,29 The three different regions formed a triangle similar to the one discussed by Lampert's theory. A clear transition from Ohm’s law to Child's law (Fig. 10a) is observed passing through the trap-limited SCLC. The voltage was termed as the cross-over voltage (Von) as described in eqn (15), where the concentrations of both the injected electrons and the thermally equilibrium free carriers balance each other. (15)
Density of states present in the conduction band, trap population and temperature influence the θ parameter.
Photodiode performance
Current–voltage characteristics were studied under both the dark and under standard solar AM 1.5 sun illumination. Photocurrent increased with the intensity per number of suns. The dark current of the photodiode was 3.6 mA and the photocurrent at 1 V applied bias was 32.4 mA upon 1.380 sun illumination. Photodetector properties are evaluated based upon the responsivity and the external quantum efficiency. Responsivity, defined as the photocurrent generated per unit power upon incident light on the effective area of the detector (eqn (16)), was calculated using the relation30 (16)where Pλ is the intensity of the illumination, S is the effective area of the illumination and Iλ is the photocurrent where Iλ = Ilight − Idark. Similarly external quantum efficiency (EQE) was described as the number of electrons detected per incident photon and was estimated using the relation (eqn (17)) (17)where h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light, q is the electron charge and λis the wavelength of the light source used for excitation. It was observed that the responsivity increased from 290 A W−1 upon 0.9645 sun illumination to 920 A W−1 for 1.38 sun illumination at 1 V applied bias (Fig. 11a). Moreover EQE varied between 32% to 10% in a response range from 350 nm to 1100 nm wavelength upon 1.38 sun illumination in Fig. 12b. Internal gain, defined as the ratio of photocurrent (in electrons per second) to photons absorbed, was determined from the relation31 (eqn (18)): (18)where η is the external quantum efficiency and λ is the exciting wavelength taken in micrometers, showed a similar behavior of EQE in the broad wavelength response from 350 nm to 1100 nm as seen from Fig. 12a. High responsivity and high gain can be attributed to the hole trapping states of oxygen and also due to the decrease in the barrier height upon photon flux illumination as depicted in the current–voltage characteristics (Fig. 8). In general in a photodiode high quantum efficiency would be achieved if tlife > textract, where tlife is the lifetime of excess charge carriers, and textract is the time taken to transport to the respective electrodes (eqn (19)) through the built-in field (L is the contact separation, Vbi is the built-in potential across the junction and μ is the mobility of the slower carrier):32 (19)The specific detectivity of the detector is expressed as eqn (20) (20)where q is the charge of electron, Io is the dark current. The calculated detectivity was found to be ∼3.0 × 1014 Jones at 1 V at 17.97 mW cm−2 sun illumination intensity (Fig. 11b). The photodetector parameters are compared with the previously reported values in Table 1. To the best of our knowledge to date the photodetection of CIASe films was demonstrated in the near infra-red region; we have demonstrated for the first time the visible photodetection of CIASe sol–gel processed films taking advantage of AZnO as the junction partner. Our present work showed a better responsivity and quantum efficiency to previous results as shown in Table 1. The dark current can be further decreased by employing conjugated polymers as a sandwich layer in between the inorganic layers. Moreover the nanowires, used as the seed layer, were also found to enhance the detector performance. A strategy for a highly sensitive detector is the focus of our ongoing current research.

Conclusion
Three different absorption phenomena were exhibited by CIASe spin coated thin films, indicating the possible allowed transitions. Crystal field and spin–orbit parameters were calculated from the quasi-cubic model. Al doped zinc oxide was firstly employed as an electron donor layer making a better junction with CIASe in the photodiode based photodetector. Junction parameters were calculated and analyzed. Steady state photoresponse was demonstrated with the standard A.M 1.5 solar lamp, under different sun illuminations. Higher responsivity and quantum efficiency make CIASe a sensitive photodetector not only in the near infra-red region but also in the visible spectrum.
