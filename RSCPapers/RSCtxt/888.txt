    , Accepted 26th March 2019First published on 26th March 2019AbstractHere, hollow CdS nanoboxes (average size of 120 nm) with graded nanovoids (ranging from 2 nm to 13 nm) distributed in the walls (average thickness of 20 nm) are in situ synthesized through directly sulfurizing a Cd metal–organic framework (Cd-MOF-47) with thiourea. A specific surface area of 153 m2 g−1 is achieved. With as-prepared hollow CdS nanoboxes as photocatalysts for water splitting to H2 (visible light irradiation), H2 evolution rate is as high as 21654 μmol g−1 h−1, which is nearly 79 times higher than that of bulk CdS. Such an excellent photocatalytic efficiency is ascribed to the large specific surface area for improving light absorbability and the porous nanostructure for efficiently utilizing excitation light due to the multiple scattering within the hollow framework. Moreover, a smaller band gap (2.30 eV) with a higher conduction band (−0.83 V) presents a strong reducibility, which is beneficial for reducing H2O to H2. A combination of fluorescence spectroscopy (PL), PL lifetimes and the photoelectrochemical technique shows that hollow CdS nanoboxes exhibit lower fluorescence intensity, longer electron lifetime and stronger photocurrent intensity than bulk CdS, implying an improved separation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers. This work presents a novel methodology to prepare hollow nanostructures, exhibiting potential applications in the field of energy conversion.
Introduction
With an ever-increasing demand for energy and emerging global environmental pollution, developing renewable and clean energy (such as CO, CH4 or H2) is crucial to alleviate energy- and environment-related issues.1–3 Among the sustainable energy sources, H2 is recognized as an ecologically friendly energy vector.4–6 Currently, photocatalytic water splitting with sunlight is an ideal approach to produce H2. So far, numerous semiconductor nanomaterials have been developed as photocatalysts.6–8 Thus, there are three sequential and pivotal processes:9 (i) the prepared semiconductor could absorb solar-light as much as possible, (ii) the as-produced electron–hole pairs efficiently separate/migrate, and (iii) H2O traps electrons and is reduced to H2. Thus, how to synthesize a photocatalyst to greatly meet these requirements is of great significance.
Inorganic semiconductors (such as metal oxide and metal sulfide) have been utilized as photocatalysts.10–14 As a widely used photocatalyst, TiO2 only absorbs ultraviolet light (4% solar spectrum), limiting the efficient absorption of solar-light.15,16 Subsequently, photocatalysts absorbing visible light (45% solar spectrum) have been synthesized and further developed.17–21 Among them, CdS is regarded as one of the most promising materials for solar-driven H2 evolution due to its suitable band gap (ca.2.4 eV) and its ability to efficiently excite charge carriers.22–24 The conduction-band edge potential is more negative than the reduction potential of H2O/H2, which is beneficial for preferably reducing H2O to H2. However, the ultrafast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and less active sites lead to low photocatalytic efficiency, thus significantly restricting the application in H2 evolution. Therefore, design and synthesis of CdS with higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and more active sites are really important.
Until now, various morphological CdS nanostructures (nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanorods, and nanosheets) were synthesized and applied in photocatalytic water splitting into H2.25–28 The results demonstrated that the structure design is an effective strategy to increase the specific surface area, improve the photogenerated electron–hole separation efficiency, and further enhance the efficiency of light conversion. Meanwhile, preparation of hollow CdS nanostructures is another effective solution to expose more active sites, efficiently utilizing excitation light, and suppress electron–hole recombination due to the following facts: (1) hollow nanostructures possess a high specific surface area and enable multiple reflections of light within the hollow framework29 and (2) thin shells can decrease the transport distance of charge carriers and thus reduce the possibility of charge recombination.30 As is well known, preparation of hollow nanostructures usually relies on hard or soft template-assisting methods, which require complicated and tedious post-processes to remove the templates.31–33 What's worse, removing procedures inevitably destroy nanostructures and also lead to the loss of active sites. Undoubtedly, it is a meaningful theme to explore a novel strategy to synthesize CdS hollow nanostructures without intricate template removal procedures.
Recently, synthesis of hollow CdS nanostructures without subsequent template removal procedures has been designed, which were applied as photocatalysts in the degradation of pollutants, but not in water splitting to H2.34–39 Alternatively, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are attractive nanoporous crystalline materials for a variety of potential applications, and they are also applied as promising sacrificial templates or self-templates to construct hollow and porous structures.40–43 Compared to other strategies, hollow structures derived from metal–organic framework templates often exhibited distinct merits, such as hierarchical porosity and a large surface area, and have been proven to perform extraordinarily in photocatalysis.44,45 To the best of our knowledge, with a MOF as a precursor, in situ synthesis of hollow CdS nanostructures has not been reported.
In this paper, with Cd metal–organic framework (Cd-MOF-74) as a precursor, hollow CdS nanoboxes (CdS-H) were firstly in situ synthesized through sulfurizing Cd-MOF-74 with thiourea under hydrothermal conditions (120 °C for 4 hours). The synthesized CdS-H photocatalysts were 120 ± 10 nm with a shell thickness of 20 ± 5 nm. Interestingly, graded nanopores with the size ranging from 2 nm to 13 nm were distributed in the shells. As expected, a specific surface area of 153 m2 g−1 was achieved. With as-prepared CdS-H as a photocatalyst in water splitting to H2, H2 evolution rate was 21654 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 79 times higher than that of as-synthesized bulk CdS. Such a greatly improved photocatalytic activity was due to the properties of CdS-H: (1) enhanced solar-light harvesting, (2) a smaller band gap (2.3 eV) with a higher conduction band (−0.83 V), and (3) efficient suppression of photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination. This work presents a novel methodology to prepare hollow nanostructures derived from MOFs.

Materials. 
Chromium acetate (Cd (CH3COOH)2·2H2O, 99%), thiourea (CH4N2S, 99%), and 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (C8H6O6, H4DOBDC 98%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). Ethyl alcohol absolute (C2H6O, 99.5%), N,N,-dimethylformamide (DMF), and methanol (CH3OH) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Deionized water was used in all experiments.
Synthesis of the Cd metal organic framework (Cd-MOF-74): Cd-MOF-74 was synthesized by solvothermal treatment. 0.699 g of Cd (CH3COOH)2·2H2O was dissolved in 15.8 ml of N,N,-dimethylformamide with stirring (solution A). 0.200 g of 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid was dissolved in 5.3 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide with stirring (solution B). Then, solutions A and B were mixed in a 50 ml reactor and could not exceed two-thirds of the total volume. The liner was polytetrafluoroethylene and the mixture was solvothermally treated at 140 °C for 24 h. A yellow solid was obtained by centrifugation, washed with DMF, and immersed in methanol for 3 days. The precipitate was further centrifuged, washed three times with ethanol and vacuum dried at 80 °C for 24 h. Yields based on cadmium acetate: Cd-MOF-74 (0.221 g, 30.0%).
Hollow CdS nanoboxes were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal treatment. 0.050 g Cd-MOF-74 was dispersed in 100 mL deionized water. Then, this suspension was sonicated for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension, in which 0.500 g thiourea was dissolved under magnetic stirring for 30 min. Finally, the suspension was heated to 120 °C for 4 h under hydrothermal conditions in a 50 ml reactor. The final products were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with ethanol, and vacuum dried at 70 °C overnight. Yields based on Cd-MOF-74: hollow CdS nanoboxes (CdS-H) (0.017 g, 34.0%).
Bulk CdS were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal treatment. 0.266 g of Cd (CH3COOH)2·2H2O and 0.076 g of thiourea were added into 100 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring for 30 min. Finally, the suspension was heated to 120 °C for 4 h under hydrothermal conditions in a 50 ml reactor. The final products were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with ethanol, and vacuum dried at 70 °C overnight. Yields based on cadmium acetate: bulk CdS (CdS-B) (0.103 g, 45.5%).

Material characterization and analysis
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out by using a Rigaku D/max-2400 diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 200 mA current using CuKα radiation (l = 1.5418 Å). The morphology of the as-prepared CdS nanostructures was observed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) (Hitachi S4800 instrument equipped spectrometers). High-resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were acquired by using a JEOL JEM 2100 transmission electron microscope. The compositions of the samples were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) attached to the FESEM instrument. The photoabsorption properties of photocatalysts were evaluated by UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) with a UV-2450 spectrophotometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was carried out on an FS5 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments). Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer. Nitrogen sorption isotherms and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were measured at 77 K with an ASAP 2020 physisorption analyzer (USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out with an ESCALab 250Xi electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300 W Al K radiation.
The photocurrent measurements were carried out on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China) using a standard three-electrode quartz cell under an applied bias of 0.5 V. 50 mg CdS-H was dispersed in 1 mL DMF to produce a slurry, and then 20 mL of the slurry was spread on a cleaned fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) glass electrode (1.0 cm × 1.5 cm). Finally, the electrodes were dried in air and calcined at 200 °C for 1 h. A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used as the visible-light source. The reference and counter electrodes were Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) and platinum wire under the visible light of a 300 W Xe lamp (light on/off at regular intervals of 30 s) equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter. Sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) aqueous solution (0.2 M) was used as a supporting electrolyte. Mott–Schottky plots were obtained to evaluate the energy band positions of the photocatalysts at a frequency of 1 kHz using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation in the dark.
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution tests were carried out in a Pyrex reaction cell connected to a gas-closed system. A certain amount of CdS powder (1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg or 30 mg) was dispersed in 30 ml aqueous solution containing 3 ml lactic acid with ultrasonic treatment. Next, 1 ml of H2PtCl6 (10 mg mL−1) aqueous solution was added into the above suspension under stirring. After this, the mixed solution was first purged with N2 for 30 min to remove the air and then irradiated using a 300 W Xe lamp with a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm). The amount of hydrogen was detected by gas chromatography (FULI; TDX-01 column, TCD, Ar Carrier).
Results and discussion
Synthesis of hollow CdS nanoboxes
Firstly, a Cd metal–organic framework (Cd-MOF-74) (Cd2 (DOBDC)) with a bulk-like morphology was synthesized by the solvothermal method and analysed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Fig. S1a†) and power X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S1b†).46 Subsequently, through sulfurizing Cd-MOF-74 with thiourea under hydrothermal conditions (120 °C for 4 h), the obtained CdS nanoboxes were characterized by XRD and SEM (Fig. S2†). XRD measurements clearly detected the characteristic peaks, which are located at 24.8°, 26.5°, 28.2°, 36.6°, 43.7°, 47.8° and 51.8° indexing to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) diffraction planes of CdS (JCPDS 41-1049), respectively.47 Compared to bulk CdS (CdS-B) (Fig. S2a†), these XRD peaks remained the same, corresponding to unchanged crystal structure. The representative SEM images show that the prepared CdS was nanoboxes with an average size of 120 nm (Fig. S2b†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1a) showed that the as-prepared CdS was hollow nanoboxes with an average size of 120 ± 10 nm and a shell thickness of 20 ± 5 nm (Fig. 1a). The enlarged TEM images reveal that the shell was a porous structure (Fig. 1b). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows that the widths of the lattice fringes were 0.336 and 0.292 nm, which correspond to (111) and (200) crystal planes of hexagonal CdS (Fig. 1c). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) tests observed the nanopores (distributed in the shells) with a size ranging from 2 nm to 13 nm (Fig. 1d), which was consistent with TEM image (Fig. 1b). The specific surface area was 153 m2 g−1 (Fig. S3a†), which was much higher than that of CdS-B (48 m2 g−1) (Fig. S3b†) and also higher than the reported results as shown in Table 1. The exact chemical composition was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in Fig. 1e. The survey spectrum detected Cd, S, and C (from the instrument testing process): (1) S 2p exhibited two prominent bands located at 162.8 eV and 161.7 eV (2p1/2 and 2p3/2) and (2) Cd 3d exhibited two prominent bands located at 412.17 eV and 405.45 eV (3d3/2 and 3d5/2) (Fig. S4†), which correspond to the chemical state of S2−and Cd2+.56 The results were further confirmed through energy-dispersive X-ray elemental analysis (Fig. S5†), and the detected elements were Cd and S. Based on these results, it was concluded that CdS-H was synthesized through in situ sulfurizing Cd-MOF-74 without post-template removal.

In order to clarify the forming process of CdS-H, the time-dependent morphology evolution was investigated as shown in Fig. 2. According to the literature,57 it was proposed that at the beginning of the sulfidation procedure (Fig. 2a, 0.5 h), S2− ions (released from thiourea through hydrolyzation) quickly reacted with Cd2+ on the surface of Cd-MOF-74 to form a thin layer of CdS, which was expressed as Cd2 (DOBDC) + 2S2− = 2CdS + DOBDC4−. Afterwards, the inner Cd-MOF-74 gradually dissolved and released Cd2+, which penetrated the preformed CdS thin layer to react with S2− ions on the outer surface and thus produced hollow voids inside the CdS shell (Fig. 2b, 2 h). Finally, CdS-H (hollow CdS nanoboxes) were formed (Fig. 2c, 4 h). Thus, it was believed that the formation of CdS-H followed an anion exchange effect mechanism. The schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 2d.

Performance of hollow CdS nanoboxes as a photocatalyst
The performance of as-prepared CdS-H as a photocatalyst for water splitting to H2 was investigated under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). With lactic acid as a hole scavenger and Pt as a co-catalyst and an electron promoter, a steady accumulation of H2 within 4 h was observed as shown in Fig. 3a. As expected, the rate of H2 production significantly varied with the used amount of CdS-H. When the amount of CdS-H was less than 5 mg (such as 1 mg), the light utilizing efficiency was lower. Alternatively, when the amount of CdS-H was higher than 5 mg (such as 10 mg or 30 mg), too much CdS-H catalyst had a shielding effect on the light, resulting in a decreased catalytic efficiency.58 The result showed that 5 mg CdS-H exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, and the H2 evolution rate was 21.654 mmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. S6a†). Compared to CdS-B (0.334 mmol g−1 h−1) (inset of Fig. S6b†), the prepared CdS-H exhibited a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance (increased by 79 times) (Fig. 3b). In addition, without Pt as a co-catalyst and an electron promoter, the average H2 evolution rate was 3.14 mmol g−1 h−1 for CdS-H (Fig. S7†). As a result, with CdS-H as a photocatalyst, the H2 evolution rate was much higher than that of reported CdS (Table 1). Recycling experiments were carried out to evaluate the stability (Fig. 3c). CdS-H almost remained unchanged during the four runs, while CdS-B was decreased by 54.8% after four runs. Moreover, the powder XRD data further showed that the morphology of the used CdS-H was consistent with that of fresh CdS-H (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the morphology of CdS-H was basically unchanged (Fig. S8†). The results demonstrated that CdS-H presented an excellent stability and resistance to photoetching.

Photocatalytic mechanism of hollow CdS nanoboxes in H2 evolution
The photocatalytic mechanism of CdS-H as a photocatalyst was investigated. According to the literature,48–52 it was generally believed that (1) CdS-H absorbed light to generate electron–hole pairs and further separate electron pairs; (2) electrons migrated to the surface of CdS-H, and H2O captured the separated electrons; and (3) H2 was produced with the aid of lactic acid (as a hole scavenger). Firstly, UV-Vis absorption spectra detected an absorption band at 574 nm as shown in Fig. 4a. Compared with that of CdS-B (at 541 nm), the absorption of CdS-H in the visible-light region was obviously enhanced, which indicated that the hollow structure could enhance the light absorption. According to the absorption band at 574 nm, the band gap energies (Eg) of CdS-H were calculated to be 2.30 eV resolved from the Tauc plot, which was smaller than that of CdS-B (2.38 eV) (Fig. S9†). The valence band (VB) XPS (Fig. 4b) showed that the VB-XPS of CdS-H was 1.68 eV and that of CdS-B was 1.86 eV.58,59 From the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. S10†), it was found that the Fermi energy level for CdS-H was −0.21 V (vs. NHE) and for CdS-B was −0.13 V (vs. NHE).60,61 Therefore, the VB of CdS-H was calculated to be 1.47 V vs. NHE (1.68 + (−0.21)) and that of CdS-B was 1.73 V vs. NHE (1.86 + (−0.13)). According to the band gap energies, the conduction band (CB) of CdS-H was determined to be −0.83 V (1.47–2.30) and that of CdS-B was −0.65 V (1.73–2.38). The difference of −0.18 V (−0.83 – (−0.65)) between the CB of CdS-H and CdS-B presented a strong reducibility of electrons appearing in the CB of CdS-H, which was beneficial for reducing H2O to H2. Based on the above discussion, a schematic diagram of the energy band structure was proposed as shown in Fig. 4c, exhibiting a smaller forbidden bandwidth and a more negative conduction band position.

PL spectra (d), time-resolved PL spectra (e) and transient photocurrent responses of the as-synthesized samples (f) (CdS-H (red) and CdS-B (black)). 
Next, the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers was further investigated using a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy (PL), PL lifetimes and the photo-electrochemical technique. Compared with CdS-B, the PL intensity of CdS-H was distinctly diminished (Fig. 4d), indicating a faster electron-transfer rate and a lower electron–hole recombination rate.62 Time resolved photoluminescence measurements were carried out (Fig. 4e). Through biexponential fitting (Table 2), the calculated lifetime was 2.31 ns for CdS-H and 1.06 ns for CdS-B, presenting an improved separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in CdS-H.36 Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4f, the photochemical measurements clearly showed that the current intensity of CdS-H was higher than that of CdS-B under visible light irradiation, revealing an increased mobility of charge carriers over CdS-H.63 Integrated with these results, such a greatly improved photocatalytic activity was due to the properties of CdS-H: (1) enhanced solar-light harvesting, (2) a smaller band gap (2.3 eV) with a higher conduction band (−0.83 eV), and (3) efficient suppression of the photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination.

Conclusions
In summary, CdS-H (average size of 120 ± 10 nm) with graded nanopores (ranging from 2 nm to 13 nm) distributed in the shells (average thickness of 20 nm) was in situ synthesized through vulcanizing a Cd metal organic framework (Cd-MOF-74). The measured specific surface area was 153 m2 g−1. With CdS-H as a photocatalyst for water splitting to H2 under visible light irradiation, the H2 evolution rate was 21654 μmol g−1 h−1, which was almost 79 times higher than that of CdS-B. Such an enhanced photocatalytic performance was ascribed to (1) enhanced solar-light harvesting, (2) a smaller band gap (2.3 eV) with an up-shifted conduction band (−0.83 V), and (3) improved separation efficiency of the photoinduced charge carriers. The results implied that directly vulcanizing Cd-MOF to prepare hollow CdS with a large specific area was an effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic efficiency. This study provided a novel clue for in situ synthesizing metal sulfides, phosphides, and even oxides with a MOF as a self-template.
