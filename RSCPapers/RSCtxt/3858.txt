In this work, we develop a one-pot solution approach to obtain copper selenide nanostructures with different morphologies and crystal structures (Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets). In comparison to previously reported methods, our method did not use expensive and very toxic raw materials. After detailed studies of reaction conditions, including temperature, reaction time, and feeding amount of surfactants and precursors, we found that the feeding ratio of precursors played a key role in the crystal structures and morphologies of the final products. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept study, the potential applications of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures in the photocatalytic discoloration of aqueous methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation and near-infrared (NIR) light induced photothermal therapy for cancer treatment were investigated. Encouraged by their strong photocatalytic activities and high photothermal conversion efficiencies (calculated to be 51.0%, 49.5% and 48.9% for Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets, respectively), we believe that copper selenide nanostructures fabricated from the one-pot solution approach developed in this work would be promising candidates for a wide variety of emerging applications.
Introduction
Over the past few decades, numerous reports have focused on the synthesis and potential applications of transition metal chalcogenides due to their fascinating shape/size-dependent properties.1–5 Among these materials, copper selenide is a significant eye-catching anisotropic p-type semiconductor material that has been serving as a promising candidate for solar cells,6,7 photo-detectors,8 thermoelectric converters,9 photocatalysts,10,11 and flexible electronics12 and in photothermal treatment of cancer cells.13,14 Inspired by the extensive role of copper selenide materials in both scientific and technological disciplines, plenty of efforts have been devoted to synthesizing them with various shapes and sizes.15 For instance, CuSe quantum dots, Cu2−xSe nanocubes and Cu3Se2 nanoplates have been successfully obtained by thermolysis of a single-source precursor,16 an electrochemical crystallization process17 and an ultrasonochemical process,18,19 respectively. However, relatively toxic raw materials and high reaction temperatures used in the aforementioned methods are the reasons which forced us to explore a novel synthetic strategy for synthesizing copper selenide materials.10 Moreover, there have been few reports on the fabrication of 2D copper selenide nanostructures.20–22 Therefore, exploring a novel synthetic approach to prepare copper selenide nanostructures with controlled shapes and crystal structures would continue to be an endless pursuit in materials science.
In the present work, a one-pot solution approach was developed to obtain high-quality copper selenide nanomaterials with controllable shapes and well-defined crystal structures. As shown in Scheme 1a, copper selenide nanomaterials with various phases and morphologies were obtained using a template-free process at a relatively low temperature and in limited time in comparison with the previously reported methods. Simply by changing the feeding ratio of the reaction precursors (CuCl and SeO2), Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates (in-plane diameter-to-thickness ratio ∼10) and CuSe2 nanosheets (in-plane diameter-to-thickness ratio ∼100) with good monodispersity were successfully obtained without using expensive and toxic phosphine ligands such as trioctylphosphine (TOP). Encouraged by their outstanding UV-Vis-NIR absorption properties, the potential applications of these as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures in visible light-driven photocatalysis (Scheme 1b) and near-infrared (NIR) light induced photothermal ablation of cancer cells (Scheme 1c) were evaluated here as a proof-of-concept study. The excellent performance further revealed that the copper selenide nanostructures fabricated from the one-pot solution approach developed in this work would be promising candidates for a wide variety of emerging applications.

Experimental section
Materials
Anhydrous cuprous chloride (CuCl, 97%, Aladdin), selenium dioxide (SeO2, 99%, Aladdin), hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O, 98%, Aladdin), ethylene glycol (98%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) and methylene blue (MB, 70%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) were used as received without further purification. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, K30, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB, Sigma-Aldrich) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as surfactants to improve the dispersity of the obtained copper selenide nanostructures. All the synthetic processes were carried out within an oil bath under the protection of a nitrogen atmosphere. All of the other reagents were used as received without any purification.
Synthesis of copper selenide nanostructures
The synthesis of copper selenide nanostructures was carried out using a facile one-pot solution strategy with EG as a solvent. For instance, in a typical synthesis of CuSe nanoplates, CuCl (1.0 mmol), SeO2 (1.0 mmol) and an appropriate amount of capping agents were dissolved into 20 mL EG with magnetic stirring to form the precursor solution at room temperature under N2 atmosphere for 1 h. The obtained solution was then transformed into a three-neck bottle followed by the addition of 1.0 mL N2H4·H2O and kept magnetically stirring for about 30 min to obtain α-Se products. After that, the reaction solution was heated to 160 °C and kept stirring for 1 h to generate a dark-brown mixture. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, the final products were collected by centrifugation and washed with DI water and ethanol several times. For synthesizing Cu2Se nanoparticles and CuSe2 nanosheets, the feeding amount of SeO2 was changed to 0.5 mmol and 2 mmol, respectively. The effect of reaction conditions, such as reaction temperature, different kinds of capping agents and the amount of surfactant, was further investigated in our study.
Characterization of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures were recorded on an X'Pert PRO MPD X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical B. V., Holland) using graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The size and morphologies of the as-prepared products were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with a SU8020 (Hitachi, Japan), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with a JEM-2100F (JEOL, Japan, 200 kV accelerating voltage). The UV-visible-NIR absorption spectra of copper selenide nanostructures were obtained by using a spectrophotometer (U-5100, Hitachi) with a quartz cuvette of 1.0 cm optical path length. The accurate concentrations of copper and selenium elements in the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Thermo Scientific iCAP RQ).
Catalytic degradation of MB using copper selenide nanostructures
Inspired by their strong absorption in the visible region, the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures were investigated by characterizing the photo-discoloration effect of MB with the assistance of H2O2. All measurements were carried out under visible light irradiation and at room temperature. Typically, 10 mg of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures were first mixed with 40 mL of MB solution (2 × 10−5 M) under magnetic stirring in the dark for 30 min to establish the adsorption–desorption equilibrium of the dye with the catalyst. Then, 1.0 mL of H2O2 was added into the dye solution and irradiated with a xenon lamp (the optical irradiance at the surface of the dye solution was maintained at 70 mW cm−2). The UV-vis absorption spectra of an aliquot of the dye solution at given time intervals were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer.
Hyperthermic effect of copper selenide nanostructures under NIR irradiation
3.0 mL aqueous solutions of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures with different concentrations were irradiated with a NIR laser (808 nm, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics, China) for 10 min. The solution temperature was subsequently recorded every 10 s.
The photostability of copper selenide nanostructures was further investigated by using five LASER ON/OFF cycles. Typically, the aqueous solution of copper selenide nanostructures was irradiated with 808 nm NIR laser for 10 min (LASER ON), followed by naturally cooling to ambient temperature without NIR light irradiation (LASER OFF). After five LASER ON/OFF cycles, the UV-vis-NIR spectra and TEM characterization were further performed to investigate the photostability of copper selenide nanostructures. Moreover, the photothermal conversion efficiency of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures was calculated according to a previously published method.23,24

In vitro cell cytotoxicity study
For a proof-of-concept study, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were employed here to evaluate the cytotoxicity of Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets. Typically, exponentially growing HUVECs were seeded into a 96-well cell culture plate (1 × 104 cells per well, 200 μL) and allowed to attach and grow overnight. The solutions of copper selenide nanostructures with gradient concentrations which were prepared with fresh DMEM medium were then added into the wells to replace the waste medium. With further 24 h of continuous exposure to various concentrations of copper selenide nanostructures, the solutions were exchanged with fresh medium and the cell viability was measured using the standard MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide) assay according to the manufacturer's protocol.
The localized photothermal cell-killing abilities of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures were evaluated using HeLa cancer cells. In brief, HeLa cells (cell density: 5 × 104 cells per well) were seeded onto a 24-well cell culture plate and allowed to grow for 24 h. Then, the cancer cells were refreshed with CuSe nanoplate solution (100 μg mL−1, 400 μL), followed by NIR light irradiation for different times (0, 3 and 5 min). After that, the cancer cells were gently washed with PBS and a typical live/dead assay was carried out by using calcein AM (green fluorescence) and propidium iodide (PI, red fluorescence), respectively.
A standard MTT assay was further used to quantitatively analyze the cell-killing efficiency with combined treatments of copper selenide nanostructures and NIR laser irradiation. HeLa cells (1 × 104 cells per well) were seeded onto a 96-well plate and cultured overnight. Then the cells were refreshed with solutions of copper selenide nanostructures at various concentrations and treated with NIR laser irradiation (808 nm, 2.0 W) for different times (0, 3 and 5 min), followed by a further 24 h incubation at 37 °C. Finally, the MTT assay was used to characterize cell viability according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Results and discussion
Copper selenide nanostructures with various morphologies and structures were obtained by changing the feeding ratio of precursors (CuCl and SeO2) in the synthetic system. The crystal structure and chemical composition of the as-prepared products were confirmed by XRD characterization. It is shown that the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the cubic Cu2Se crystal structure (JCPDS no. 65-2982), the hexagonal CuSe crystal structure (JCPDS no. 20-1020) and the tetragonal CuSe2 crystal structure (JCPDS no. 71-0047) (Fig. 1a, e and i). Particularly, as shown in Fig. 1e, obvious diffraction peaks can be indexed to (101), (102), (103), (006), (106), (110), (108), (116), and (208), which are in good agreement with the standard JCPDS card no. 20-1020. From the results of SEM and TEM characterization, the obtained products were Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets (Fig. 1b, c, f, g and j, k). Benefiting from the use of ethylene glycol as a solvent and PVP as a capping agent, all the obtained products could disperse well in either polar (DI water, etc.) or nonpolar solvents (methylene chloride, etc.) with a mean diameter of 15.0 ± 4.9 nm, 121.0 ± 32.9 nm (lateral size) with a constant thickness of ≈20.5 nm, a broad distribution of lateral sizes from 0.3 to 1.5 μm with a thickness of ≈30.4 nm for Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets.

The HRTEM images of individual copper selenide nanostructures are given in the insets of Fig. 1c, g and k. We can see that Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets are single crystalline in nature. The lattice spacings are measured to be 0.326 nm, 0.195 nm and 0.184 nm, which are attributed to the (111) interplanar spacing of the cubic Cu2Se crystal, (110) interplanar spacing of the hexagonal CuSe crystal and (311) interplanar spacing of the tetragonal CuSe2 crystal, respectively. Furthermore, the crystal structures of Cu2Se nanoparticles (Fig. 1d), CuSe nanoplates (Fig. 1h) and CuSe2 nanosheets (Fig. 1m) given by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) agreed well with those given by XRD measurements. In addition, ICP-MS was used to determine the accurate concentration of copper and selenium elements in the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures. For 20 μg L−1 copper selenide nanostructures, the concentration of the copper element was 10.15, 6.24 and 5.42 μg L−1 for Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets, respectively. For the same samples, the concentration of the selenium element was 6.15, 7.08 and 12.18 μg L−1 for Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets, respectively. Thus, the accurate concentration and the ratio of copper and selenium elements further confirmed the composition of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures.
To investigate the presence of surface capping agents in the reaction system, we used four different capping agents with positively charged (CTAB), neutral (Triton X-100 and PVP) and negatively charged head groups (SDS). As shown in Fig. 2a, the crystal structures and chemical compositions of the obtained products can be indexed to the hexagonal CuSe crystal structure (JCPDS no. 20-1020) with the feeding ratio of CuCl and SeO2 to be 1:1, regardless of the properties of surface capping agents. When the reaction is performed in ethylene glycol in the presence of either CTAB (positively charged) or SDS (negatively charged), the lateral sizes of the obtained CuSe nanoplates were a little bit bigger than the neutral surfactant (Triton X-100 and PVP) synthesis, but with less uniformity (Fig. 2b–f). The possible mechanism is that the charged head group may attract charged precursors and accelerate the oriented growth of nanoplates.25 Thus, although the capping agents used here have some influences on the size of the obtained products, they are not the dominant factor in deciding the crystal structures and the chemical compositions of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures. Moreover, the effects of the amount of capping agent (PVP) and reaction temperature on the crystal structure, chemical composition, shape and size of the obtained products were also investigated (Fig. S1 and S2†). Similar observations also confirmed that the amount of capping agents and reaction temperature may have a small effecton the lateral size or thickness of the obtained products, but not the dominant factors which affect the crystal structure and chemical compositions. Therefore, the feeding ratio of precursors in our developed solution synthetic strategy is the crucial factor for the crystal structure and chemical compositions of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures.

The results of the experiments obtained on investigating various factors imply that the feeding ratio of CuCl and SeO2 is the dominant factor in determining the crystal structure and the shape of copper selenide nanostructures. The possible reaction procedures can be deduced from the aforementioned results as below. First, the dissolved SeO2 in ethylene glycol can be easily transformed to a brick red α-Se precursor by reducing SeO2 with N2H4·H2O at room temperature, whereas the Cu+ cannot be reduced to Cu atoms at this stage. Subsequently, when the temperature increases to 160 °C, the generated Cu atoms obtained from the reduction of Cu+ by N2H4·H2O will randomly attach to the surface of the crystallized Se spheres. The copper selenide spherical nanoparticles were formed initially and gone through different growth processes. When the Cu+ is excessive compared to Se atoms, the initial Se spheres and the adsorbed Cu+ would grow into Cu2Se nanoparticles after further heating at 160 °C through an Ostwald ripening process. On the other hand, when the Cu+ precursor is insufficient to support Se spheres in ethylene glycol, oriented attachment growth would occur for reducing overall energy by removing surface energy associated with the copper selenide nanoparticle–ligand interfaces. Thus, when the reaction time further increases after being heated to 160 °C, the oriented attachment growth of copper selenide nanostructures would be induced by protection of a specific plane by hydrophobic interactions between ethylene glycol molecules and crystal surfaces, followed by an aggregation of the small copper selenide nanocrystals into CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets.26,27 Although the crystal growth habit of the final products is mainly determined by their intrinsic structures and chemical compositions, and the guided effect of surfactant molecules is not so dominant in ethylene glycol solvent, we still believe that the major function of the surfactant (such as PVP) was to prevent the nanostructures from growing too large or aggregating into large entities.
To examine the optical properties of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures, we further carried out the UV-vis-NIR absorption measurements at ambient temperature, as shown in Fig. 3a. The absorption spectra of Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets present a broad spectral response in the UV-vis-NIR region. The optical bandgap of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures was determined using the obtained absorption spectra. The curve of (αhv)2vs. (hv) is plotted in Fig. 3b. Then the values of the direct optical bandgap can be obtained from the Tauc relation as follows:(αhv)2 = A(hv − Eg)where α, hv and Eg are the absorption coefficient, the incident photon energy and the bandgap energy, respectively, and A is the constant.28 We calculated the direct band gap of Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets to be 2.36 eV, 1.50 eV and 1.62 eV, respectively, which confirmed their potential applications in visible light driven photocatalysis.10,11,29

Then we further evaluated the photocatalytic activities of the copper selenide nanostructures by photo-decoloration of MB solutions in the presence of H2O2 under visible light irradiation. As can be seen from Fig. 3c, typical UV-vis absorption spectra of MB solution catalyzed by Cu2Se nanoparticles at different time intervals were recorded. It was found that the relative intensity of absorption peaks of MB at 604 nm and 665 nm decreased rapidly with increasing time of visible light irradiation. In the presence of visible light irradiation and H2O2, Cu2Se nanoparticles could degrade MB almost completely within 18 min, which is similar to the photo-decoloration of MB with CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets (Fig. S3†). The photodegradation rates of MB solution using various combinations of visible light, copper selenide nanostructures and H2O2 were also investigated, as shown in Fig. 3d–f. Compared with copper selenide nanostructures and H2O2 under visible light irradiation, the photodegradation rates of MB were much slower when only copper selenide nanostructures or H2O2 were used. Particularly, about 19% and 42% of MB were degraded after 18 min when only cubic Cu2Se nanoparticles and only H2O2 were used, respectively. The above results reveal that the presence of copper selenide nanostructures can effectively accelerate the photocatalytic degragdation of MB, confirming the significant roles of copper selenide nanostructures in the photocatalytic degradation of MB. Probably due to the differences in the specific surface area, the photodegradation rates of Cu2Se nanoparticles were faster than the CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets (Fig. 3g). Moreover, for instance, the stability of Cu2Se nanoparticles was further investigated by repeating MB degradation with the same Cu2Se nanoparticles and adding 1.0 mL of H2O2 in each cycle. As shown in Fig. 3h, no significant change of catalytic performance was found after four cycles, which exhibits a stable photocatalytic activity and emphasizes the chemical stability of the as-synthesized cubic Cu2Se nanoparticles.
The aforementioned experimental results demonstrate that the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures could play an important role in the photo-decoloration of MB. Fig. 3i shows the schematic illustration of MB degradation in the presence of copper selenide nanostructures and H2O2 under visible light irradiation. Since the direct bandgap of the as-prepared Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets is 2.36 eV, 1.50 eV and 1.62 eV, respectively, the visible light irradiation would excite and move the electrons (e−) from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), and then the holes (h+) were generated in the VB. Consequently, the photo-generated electrons on the as-prepared nanostructure surface react easily with H2O2 molecules and form superoxide radicals (˙O2−), and the hydroxyl ions (OH−) will be oxidized into hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) by the photo-generated holes. The formed reactive hydroxyl radicals could then oxidize MB into smaller molecules such as CO2, H2O, etc.10
Encouraged by the strong absorption in the NIR region of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures (Fig. 2a), we further evaluated the potential of CuSe nanoplates (selected as a model for this proof-of-concept study) as an agent for photothermal therapy. To prevent a blockage of blood vessels or being eliminated by the body's reticuloendothelial system (RES), it is important for CuSe nanoplates to maintain their good dispersity in biological medium. Fortunately, as shown in Fig. 4a, CuSe nanoplates were dispersed very well in DMEM culture medium without any macroscopic aggregates due to the hydrophilic PVP molecules on the surface, as evidenced by the linearly increased absorbance with increased CuSe nanoplate concentrations (Fig. S4†). Moreover, the stability of CuSe nanoplates dispersed in DI water, DMEM and PBS with different pH values was also investigated for more than one week. As shown in Fig. S5,† no significant change was observed from the absorbance of CuSe nanoplates at 808 nm and no macroscopic aggregates were observed, indicating the good stability of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures in various biomimetic media.

(a) UV-vis-NIR spectra of CuSe nanoplates dispersed in DMEM culture medium (inset: photographs of CuSe nanoplate solution with different concentrations); (b) temperature elevation of the aqueous solution containing CuSe nanoplates (3.0 mL) under NIR laser irradiation (808 nm, 2.0 W); (c) temperature changes of copper selenide nanostructure solution (3.0 mL, 50 μg mL−1) under NIR laser irradiation as a function of power density; (d) temperature elevation of CuSe nanoplates (3.0 mL, 40 μg mL−1) over five LASER ON/OFF cycles of NIR laser irradiation; (e) UV-vis-NIR spectra of CuSe nanoplates (insets: photographs and TEM image of CuSe nanoplates) before and after five LASER ON/OFF cycles; (f) the photothermal profile of copper selenide nanostructure aqueous solution (3.0 mL, 20 μg mL−1) irradiated by NIR laser for 25 min, followed by natural cooling to room temperature (inset: time constant (τs) is determined to be 766.7 s, 759.7 s and 781.3 s for Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets, respectively). 
Next, the photothermal effect was investigated by monitoring the temperature of 3.0 mL of CuSe nanoplate solution with various concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 μg mL−1) under NIR laser irradiation (808 nm, 2.0 W). After being exposed to NIR lights for 10 min, the solution temperature was elevated from 19.5 °C to 25.9 °C, 30.7 °C, 38.9 °C, 44.9 °C, 49.1 °C and 51.8 °C, respectively (Fig. 4b). In sharp contrast, the temperature of DI water in the absence of CuSe nanoplates increased by only 2.4 °C. Moreover, the temperature elevation of CuSe nanoplates solution (as well as Cu2Se nanoparticles and CuSe2 nanosheets) was also laser power dependent (Fig. 4c). These data indicated that CuSe nanoplates could act as an efficient photothermal coupling agent.
The photostability of CuSe nanoplates was further investigated by using five LASER ON/OFF cycles. As shown in Fig. 4d, no significant decrease was observed in the temperature elevation of CuSe nanoplate solutions (40 μg mL−1) after five LASER ON/OFF cycles of NIR irradiation, indicating the good photostability of CuSe nanoplates. This was further confirmed by comparing UV-vis-NIR spectra and TEM images before and after five LASER ON/OFF cycles of NIR irradiation (Fig. 4e). Moreover, to investigate the photothermal conversion efficiency of copper selenide nanostructures (20 μg mL−1), the heating–cooling profile was performed (Fig. 4f).
According to the obtained data and reported method,30 the photothermal conversion efficiency was calculated to be 51.0%, 49.5% and 48.9% for Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets, respectively. According to many reported literature studies (Table 1), the photothermal conversion efficacy of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures is higher than a majority of nanomaterials-based photothermal agents, including Cu9S5 nanocrystals (25.7%),31 Au nanorod (21%),32 WS2 nanosheets (32.8%),33 Bi2Se3 spherical sponge (31.1%),34 and so on.

Without NIR laser irradiation, the feasible photothermal agent for cancer therapy should be harmless. Therefore, a typical MTT assay with HUVECs was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures. It was found that the copper selenide nanostructures appear to be largely biocompatible (Fig. 5b), because the relative viability of HUVECs was still 96.0 ± 4.8%, 93.8 ± 5.1% and 95.7 ± 4.7% after 24 h exposure to Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets with high concentration (500 μg mL−1), respectively. Encouraged by the good biocompatibility, HeLa cancer cells were selected to incubate with Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets, respectively, following NIR light illumination (808 nm and 2.0 W) to investigate their localized tumor photohyperthermic effect. After variable combination treatments with CuSe nanoplates and NIR laser irradiation, a live/dead assay was used to evaluate the acute damage of cancer cells. As can be seen from Fig. 5a, no significant acute damage of HeLa cancer cells was observed when cells were treated with NIR laser or copper selenide nanostructures alone. In contrast, a combined treatment with copper selenide nanostructures (100 μg mL−1, 400 μL) and a 5 min NIR laser irradiation resulted in substantial cellular death of HeLa cells, indicating the strong photothermal destruction ability of the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures. However, if the irradiation time decreases to 3 min, no significant cell death was observed ascribed to the insufficient heat, indicating the adjustable photothermal cell-killing ability of copper selenide nanostructures under NIR laser irradiation.

Cell viability of HeLa cancer cells after treatment with NIR laser irradiation and (c) Cu2Se nanoparticles, (d) CuSe nanoplates and (e) CuSe2 nanosheets. 
We further used a standard MTT assay to quantitatively evaluate the cytotoxicity of copper selenide nanostructures on HeLa cancer cells with/without NIR laser irradiation (Fig. 5c–e). The photothermal cell-killing ability of copper selenide nanostructures was shown both in dose-dependent and NIR laser irradiation time-dependent manner. For instance, in agreement with aforementioned results, only CuSe nanoplates or NIR laser irradiation shows low toxicity to HeLa cancer cells, whereas, when treated with NIR laser irradiation and CuSe nanoplates, the cell viabilities would significantly decrease as either the concentration of CuSe nanoplates or NIR laser irradiation time increased. Particularly, at a concentration of 5 μg mL−1 of CuSe nanoplates, the cell viabilities of HeLa cancer cells were 99.6 ± 1.3%, 79.5 ± 2.7% and 38.4 ± 3.7% with NIR laser irradiation time of 0, 3 and 5 min, respectively. While increasing the concentration of CuSe nanoplates to 10 μg mL−1, the cell viabilities of HeLa cancer cells were 96.9 ± 1.6%, 59.6 ± 4.0% and 24.1 ± 3.7% with NIR laser irradiation time of 0, 3 and 5 min, respectively. Similar adjustable cell-killing effects based on NIR laser irradiation time and concentration were also confirmed by Cu2Se nanoparticles and CuSe2 nanosheets. Thus, the results of these experiments implied that the as-prepared copper selenide nanostructures could act as a potential photothermal agent for cancer therapy.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that various copper selenide nanostructures (Cu2Se nanoparticles, CuSe nanoplates and CuSe2 nanosheets) could be obtained through a facile one-pot polyol method by only changing the feeding ratio of precursors. Comparing with previously reported methods, our approach shows many advantages, including low-cost, relatively low reaction temperature and good dispersity of final products in both polar and nonpolar solvents. Encouraged by their outstanding absorption properties, we further investigated their potential applications in the photocatalytic degradation of MB and the photothermal treatment of cancer cells. The excellent performance further revealed that the copper selenide nanostructures fabricated from the developed one-pot solution approach would be promising candidates for a wide variety of emerging applications.
