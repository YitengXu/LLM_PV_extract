    , Accepted 23rd January 2012First published on 1st March 2012AbstractA hybrid of polymer-dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) was utilized in networking with the conventional composition of gel electrolyte in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to purposely enhance the cell efficiency. The requisite polymer as the dispersant is structurally tailored for its functionalities consisting of poly(oxyethylene)-segmented amides and imides. The existence of the dispersant is multi-functional for first de-bundling the originally aggregated MWCNT and subsequently networking with the conventional gel electrolyte, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF–HFP)/LiI system. The gel electrolyte comprised of only 0.25 wt% MWCNT/POEM in the finely dispersed state was fabricated into a quasi-solid-state DSSC which showed high power-conversion efficiency (η) of 6.86% and short-circuit current density (JSC) of 15.3 mA cm−2 at the test of 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. The DSSC efficiency was significantly improved from the use of the unmodified gel electrolyte having the values of JSC = 9.6 mA cm−2 and η = 4.63%. The enhancement was further confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectra analyses for the lowest Warburg resistance (Rw). The fine dispersion of MWCNT in the polymeric dispersant was characterized by UV-Vis, TEM, FT-IR and DSC. The finding indicates the role of MWCNT for homogenizing the amorphous PVDF–HFP and facilitating the diffusion state of I−/I3− ion pairs in this electrolyte system.
1. Introduction
Since the original dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was proposed by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, the system has generated a great deal of interest due to its inexpensive materials and easy assembly processes. The typical DSSC consists of a dye-absorbed semiconductor photoanode, a counter electrode, and an electrolyte.1–3 One of the major developments is the liquid electrolyte component that renders the DSSC an acceptable power-conversion efficiency of 11–12%.4,5 However, the low durability due to the problems of leakage and volatilization of liquid electrolyte still remains the main technological challenge. To improve the cell stability, strategies using solid-state or quasi-solid-state electrolytes such as p-type inorganic semiconductors, conducting polymers, ionic liquids, and gelled metrical electrolytes, have been broadly studied.6–11 The first attempt to fabricate a gel electrolyte for a quasi-solid-state DSSC was made by Cao et al.12 In recent years, attention has been paid to the quasi-solid-state DSSC by adopting polymers as one of the gel electrolyte components owing to the possible structural tailoring for noncovalent chelating interaction with ionic species in forming hybrid networks and favorable properties.13,14 Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF–HFP), with superior mechanical strength, suitable interaction with ionic charges, and availability has gained acceptance as the gelling component for the quasi-solid-state DSSC.15 Previously, we have reported the uses of a nanoscale silicate platelet (NSP)/Triton® X-100 complex for promoting the performance of the quasi-solid-state DSSC with PVDF–HFP based gel electrolyte.16 Although NSP/Triton® X-100 could decrease the degree of the crystallinity of the PVDF–HFP to contribute the increase in the ionic transferability and the DSSC performance, it was non-conducting. To enhance the ionic properties of the gel electrolyte significantly, we substituted the multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) for NSP, because CNT possesses the diversity of mechanical, high electrically conductive and other physical properties.17–20 Nevertheless, CNT exists in an aggregated form due to its inherent geometric shape of a long tube and high tendency for bundling entanglement from van der Waals forces. In order to disperse and de-bundle MWCNT, surface modification by chemical covalent bonding reaction21–27 to gain an organic affinity is required. However, such a chemical modification inevitably alters the surface structures and reduces the intrinsic properties. Recently, there have been many reports to indicate the uses of organic dispersants involving noncovalent bonding interactions such as surfactant micelle formation, ionic liquids, and polymer wrapping which could gain the advantages of dispersing CNT without disrupting the sp2 structure.28–31 These methods may solve the dispersion purpose but minimize the CNT structural disruption.
The presence of physically nanosized carbon tubes with conductive properties could create suitable inter-networks for ionic species in the complex electrolyte system. The homogeneous MWCNT in strong ionic environments could be the essential factor for enhancing the ionic conductance. In the literature, CNT were used both for the counter electrodes and the electrolytes in DSSC, as reported by Hong et al.32 High catalytic efficacy was demonstrated due to the existence of the large surface area on CNT. Furthermore, Akhtar et al.33 have incorporated MWCNT into poly(oxyethylene) (PEO) based gel electrolytes for DSSC. The MWCNT/PEO hybrids offered a large surface roughness, amorphicity, and subsequent increase in ionic transfer ability. In this paper, we synthesized a polymeric surfactant34 with the tailored structure of PEG-segmented oligo(amide-imide) to disperse the MWCNTs and to hybridize them with the PVDF–HFP gel electrolyte. We demonstrated the effectiveness between dispersing MWCNT in the gel electrolytes and the DSSC performance. The mechanism of interactions among MWCNT, the polymeric dispersant, and interaction with ions in the electrolyte is explained and corresponded with the evaluation of DSSC performance.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), prepared by chemical vapor deposition at 95% purity and 5% catalyst (Fe, Co, and Ni), were obtained from Seedchem Company Pty., Ltd. The average dimensions of MWCNT were estimated to be 40–60 nm in diameter and 0.5–10 μm in length. Poly(oxyethylene)-diamine, i.e., poly(oxypropylene-oxyethylene-oxypropylene)-segmented polyether of bis(2-aminopropyl ether) with Mw = 2,000 g mol−1 (POE2000), was a water-soluble and crystalline oligomer (waxy solid, mp = 37–40 °C, amine content 0.95 mequiv g−1 with an average 39 oxyethylene and 6 oxypropylene units in the structure). Compounds 4,4′-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA, 97% purity), poly(vinyidene fluoride-co-hexafluoro propylene) ((PVDF–HFP), Mw = 400,000 g mol−1), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5% purity), and nitric acid (HNO3, 65%), were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. The anhydride, ODPA, was sublimed before use. Anhydrous LiI, I2, acetonitrile (AN) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mw = 20,000 g mol−1) were purchased from Merck Chemical Co. Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, +98%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%), and t-butanol (TBA, 99.5%) were obtained from Acros. The solvent, 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%), was purchased from Fluka Chemical Co. and used as such. Other materials, cis-bis(isothio-cyanato)-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II)-bis-tetra-butylammonium (so-called N719), 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), ionomer resin (Surlyn®, SX1170-25, thickness = 25 μm) and fluorine-doped SnO2 glass (FTO, sheet resistivity = 15 Ω square−1) were obtained from Solaronix S. A., Aubonne, Switzerland. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 95% purity) were from TEDIA Company Inc. Nanoparticles TiO2 (diameter = 300 nm) were obtained from Kronos Chemical Co.
2.2. Preparation of gel electrolyte containing MWCNT/polyimide hybrid
The well-dispersed suspension of MWCNT in the presence of POEM as the dispersant was prepared in aqueous media. MWCNT (0.025 g) were initially added into de-ionized water (4.98 g) in a vial, and the solution was agitated at ambient temperature for 15 min by a VCX 500 ultrasonicator. The resulting solution was dark black with some solid precipitates at the bottom of the container, indicating a poor degree of dispersion. In a glass container, the MWCNT/POEM ratio was 1/20 (w/w), which meant POEM (0.50 g) was dissolved in de-ionized water (4.5 g) followed by adding the dispersion of MWCNT (0.025 g) in de-ionized water (4.98 g). The black-colored and homogenous suspension was further stirred for several days at ambient temperature. The degree of homogeneity for the MWCNT/POEM hybrid was confirmed by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The viscous paste of MWCNT in POEM dispersant was prepared by a freeze-dried process. Various loading amounts (0.05, 0.25, 2.00 and 5.00 wt%) of the MWCNT paste were added into the gel electrolytes containing 5 wt% of PVDF–HFP in 0.6 M DMPII, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in MPN.
2.3. Fabrication of DSSC
The FTO glass was cleaned thoroughly by neutral cleaners, water, acetone, and IPA in sequence. Then a compact layer was coated on the FTO from a solution consisting of TTIP (0.5 g) and 2-methoxy ethanol (1.5 g) to serve as a good mechanical contact between the FTO and TiO2 and also to insulate the FTO from the electrolyte. The TTIP was hydrolyzed into TiO2 in media containing 0.1 M HNO3 by adopting a sol–gel method. Then, the TiO2 solution was autoclaved through a hydrothermal process at 240 °C for 12 h. By concentrating the autoclaved solution to 13 wt%, a paste of nanocrystalline TiO2 was obtained. In order to prevent the paste from cracking and to control the pore size of TiO2, PEG was added to 30 wt% composition based on the TiO2 paste.35,36 The photoanode for a DSSC was prepared by coating the TiO2 paste on the FTO previously treated with the compact layer by a doctor-blade method and followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. After the coating and annealing, another layer of TiO2 containing light scattering particles of 300 nm was coated and annealed under similar conditions. A project area of 0.16 cm2 for the coated TiO2 was selected as the active area and was soaked overnight in a solution containing 0.3 mM N719 dye in AN/TBA (v/v = 1:1). The DSSC was assembled with the photoanode and the counter electrode, which was prepared by sputtering the platinum on an indium tin oxide glass (ITO glass, sheet resistivity = 8–10 Ω square−1, Ritek Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan) at 40 mA for 120 s. A distance of 25 μm between the two electrodes was separated by using Surlyn as the spacer, and then the slurry-type gel electrolyte (heated under 90 °C) was injected into the internal space of the electrodes through a hole, drilled on the counter electrode, by the capillary effect.
2.4. Instrumentation
The FT-IR spectrum was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer. The samples were prepared on KBr plates and measured over the range 800–4000 cm−1. The dispersions of the MWCNT/POEM nanocomposites were analyzed using a Hitachi U-4100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 300–700 nm and 550 nm. TEM observations were obtained using a JOEL JEM-1230 electron microscope operating at 100 kV and photographed using a Gatan DualVision CCD Camera. The samples for TEM were prepared by dropping the sample solution on a copper grid coated with a carbon film. Thermal properties of crystallizing temperatures were characterized on a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, Perkin-Elmer Pyris 6). Samples in the amount of 3–8 mg on a sealed aluminum pan were generally used. The temperature range of 0 to 100 °C was controlled at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The crystalline point (Tc) was determined from the thermogram while the enthalpy of crystallization (ΔH) was measured by integrating the peak area. The surface of the DSSC was illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM 1.5 G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.) and the incident silicon cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). The photoelectrochemical characteristics of the DSSC were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands) equipped with an FRA2 module. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were analyzed under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun). The frequency range explored was 150 kHz to 1 Hz, with an applied voltage of 0.01 V. Impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model, exhibiting the interfacial charge transfer resistances of a DSSC.37 Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), controlled by SECM with a three-electrode potentiostat (CHI, model 900B), was used to record the diffusion of I− and I3− ions in the gel electrolyte. Observations with plane views of the samples were made using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Zeiss EM 902A) at 10 kV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of POEM and dispersing ability for MWCNT
The novel dispersant, poly(oxyethylene)-segmented oligo(amide-imide) or POEM, was prepared from the reaction of poly(oxyethylene)-diamine of 2000 Mw (POE2000) and ODPA dianhydride at a 6:5 molar ratio and 150 °C under agitation and water removal. This synthetic scheme involved the formation of amidoacid intermediates from the reaction of amine and anhydride, and followed by the cyclization into imide products at elevated temperature. The structure of POEM consists of POE–(CH2CH2O)x– segments, amide–(CONH)– and aromatic imide–(CONCO)– functionalities, as the presented structure in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic scheme for the poly(oxyethylene)-segmented oligo(amide-imide) dispersant (POEM). 
The generated structure has a combination of aromatic imides and hydrophilic POE segments with multiple sites of dipole–dipole interaction rendering POEM amphiphilic and it could dissolve in water as well as in organic solvents such as toluene, DMF, AN and MPN, commonly used in electrolytes. Furthermore, the POEM dispersant enabled a good solvating property for multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). Fig. 1a, demonstrates the effect of the MWCNT dispersant in the presence of POEM by observing the apparent aggregates on the bottom of vials and also by solution UV-Vis absorption. The homogeneous dispersion of MWCNT was observed in contrast to the pristine MWCNT without dispersant. The wrapping of CNT surfaces with dispersants was evidenced by the increase of the wall diameter from 43–56 to 53–65 nm after adding the polymer. The inherent aggregation forces such as van der Waals and π–π stacking among MWCNT were overcome by the presence of POEM. From the TEM observation, MWCNT in agglomerated form are revealed to be severely entangled while well-dispersed or de-bundled units are clearly observed by comparing Fig. 1b and 1c. It is noted that the appropriate amount of POEM required a higher than 2:1 ratio by weight of POEM/MWCNT. It appears that the POEM molecules may intervene in the MWCNT aggregation via the aromatic imide π–π stacking with the sp2 surface of the tubes as well as other possible surface attractions through the –(CH2CH2O)x– dipole–dipole and imide carbonyl lone-pair electron affinity. The presence of POE segments, potentially for hydrogen bonding with water molecules, could play an amphiphilic role for MWCNT to be dispersed in water through these interconnected non-covalent bonding forces. This dispersing ability of POEM can be quantified by UV-vis measurements since the CNT appears to have an absorance at 550 nm (Abs.550).30,38 As shown in Fig. 1a, the absorbance at 550 nm for the MWCNT under POEM dispersion was found to be Abs.550 = ∼0.99, which was much higher than that of the MWCNT dispersion without the organics (Abs.550 = ∼0.05). The comparison was made for the stability test over a period of 30 days. The high stability by the POEM assistance may later benefit to the generation of stable and homogeneous MWCNT/gel electrolytes.

3.2. High performance of DSSC with the gel electrolyte containing MWCNT/POEM
The homogeneous dispersion of MWCNT by POEM in water was allowed to be freeze-dried into the form of paste by removing approximately 85% of the water. The commonly used gel electrolytes, I−/I3− redox couple in PVDF–HFP, were added with the MWCNT paste at various contents (0.05, 0.25, 2.00, and 5.00 wt%). Fig. 1d to 1g show the FE-SEM images of pristine PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte and that containing various weight percents (0.05, 0.25, and 2.00 wt%) of MWCNT/POEM. A uniform and smooth surface morphology of the pristine PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte could be observed in Fig. 1d. Disorderly rod-like structures, presumably due to the presence of MWCNTs, were seen after the incorporation of MWCNT/POEM in the PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte (Fig. 1e to 1g). In Fig. 2, the photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSC at 100 mW cm−2 irradiation were shown with the corresponding parameters in Table 1. The short-circuit current density (JSC) and power-conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC based on 0.25 wt% of MWCNT/POEM hybrid into the gel electrolyte were demonstrated to be 15.3 mA cm−2 and 6.86% respectively. The performance is superior to the DSSC with bare gel electrolyte (JSC = 9.6 mA cm−2, η = 4.63%). The increase in both JSC and η is attributed to the addition of 0.25 wt% of MWCNT/POEM hybrid which minimized the diffusion resistance of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte and caused more favorable ionic conduction pathways. The improvement in the DSSC cell performance is also consistent with the apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) of I−. The addition of the MWCNT/POEM hybrid has a little effect on the open-circuit voltage (VOC), which is essentially determined by the recombination between conduction band electrons and I3− ions. Because the existence of high-aspect-ratio MWCNT, its high surface contact with the TiO2 photoanodes further promoted the electron recombination probability. Hence, the VOC of the DSSC without MWCNT is higher than that with MWCNT. By comparison, the same contents for the MWCNT/POEM hybrid paste were also added into the solution of liquid electrolytes without PVDF–HFP.

As shown in Table 2, the increasing addition of MWCNT/POEM from 0.05 to 0.25 and 2.00 wt% to liquid electrolytes, the value of Abs.550 was correspondingly changed from 0.713 to 0.722 and 0.704. The same trend of the hybrid effect was observed in the gel electrolytes. The decay is explained by the changes in Coulombic repulsion due to the chelating interaction between the lithium ions (Li+) and the POE segments of POEM in the electrolytes.7,39,40 The chelating interactions of the POE segment and Li+ ions were further confirmed by the FT-IR absorption spectra. In Fig. 3, the asymmetric stretching of the oxyethylene group in the POEM shifts from 1612 cm−1 (Fig. 3a) to 1598 cm−1 (Fig. 3c), indicating a complex coordination of –(CH2CH2O)x– dipole interaction with Li+. The bare gel electrolyte (Fig. 3b) lacked the oxyethylene group. Hence, the screened Coulombic repulsion among the MWCNT wrapped by POEM is verified.41–43 Moreover, the Abs.550 for the MWCNT/POEM-based gel electrolyte is lower than that for the corresponding liquid electrolyte (Table 2). It was attributed to the retardation of ionic mobility in solution by the presence of PVDF–HFP in gel electrolytes. This is in accordance with the existence of the screened Coulombic repulsion. The 0.25 wt% of MWCNT/POEM in the electrolytes was optimized for the performance, while the increasing amount of addition could result in an in-homogeneity of the electrolytes. It was observed that a stronger chelating interaction at the 2.00 wt% of MWCNT/POEM hybrid was shown, indicating the shifting of the oxyethylene group from 1598 cm−1 (Fig. 3c) to 1593 cm−1 (Fig. 3d). Especially in the case of the gel electrolyte, the Abs.550 decreased dramatically from 0.471 to 0.105 as the amount of MWCNT/POEM was higher than 0.25 wt% (Table 2). It is due to the formation of hydrogen bonding derived from the fluoride functionality of PVDF–HFP and the ring-opening amide group of POEM.44 In Fig. 3, the absorption peak centered at 1545 cm−1 (blend of N–H in the amide group) shifted to 1538 cm−1 as the MWCNT/POEM increased to 2.00 wt%. Moreover, there was only a little absorption at 550 nm (Abs.550 = 0.001) for the controlled electrolyte with the sole POEM addition, confirming the absence of the characteristic MWCNT absorption. Furthermore, in another controlled experiment with only MWCNT, there was still a low absorption (Abs.550 = 0.009) due to the aggregation caused by poor dispersion. Overall, the functions of POEM wrapping and de-bundling MWCNT are required to consequently interact with the electrolyte components, LiI and PVDF–HFP, as conceptually illustrated in Scheme 2.

3.3. Thermogram studies
The thermal properties of the gel electrolytes with various amounts of the MWCNT/POEM hybrid addition were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in Fig. 4. Also in Table 2, the crystallization peaks and their enthalpy for the bare PVDF–HFP gel electrolyte were shown to have the crystallinity at Tc = 85.7 °C (ΔH = 348.9 J g−1) during the first cooling run. After the addition of 0.25 wt% POEM, the Tc changed to 94.4 °C (ΔH = 536.1 J g−1), indicating a strong interaction between PVDF–HFP and POEM. This interaction is attributed to the hydrogen bonding delivered from the ring opening amide group of POEM when the POEM interacted with the fluoride group of PVDF–HFP leading to the fold of its polymer chain. The enthalpy decreased considerably when increasing the addition of MWCNT/POEM hybrid from 0.05 to 0.25 wt%. The decrease in the enthalpy indicates that the MWCNT/POEM rendered the partial crystalline regions of POEM with PVDF–HFP to be amorphous. When the incorporated amounts of MWCNT/POEM increased to 2.00 and 5.00 wt%, the interaction became stronger than that with 0.25 wt%. The enthalpy for the gel electrolyte containing 5.00 wt% MWCNT/POEM addition was much higher than that of the bare POEM/PVDF–HFP gel electrolyte. The results summarized in Table 1demonstrate the complimentary interactions among three basic additives, POEM wrapped with MWCNT and simultaneously with PVDF–HFP gel.

3.4. Diffusion behavior of I− and I3−
It is well documented that the diffusion rate of I− and I3− ions in the electrolyte is the dominant factor for the DSSC performance. To determine their apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was measured. Fig. 5 shows the oxidation of I− ions, obtained from the gel electrolyte containing the MWCNT/POEM hybrids. A Pt ultramicroelectrode was used for the steady-state current–voltage curves of the reduction of I3− ions and to measure the potentials at scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The Dapp values of I− and I3− ions were estimated from the anodic and cathodic steady-state limiting current (ISS), respectively, using the equation45ISS = 4nFrCDapp, where n is number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reaction, F is the Faraday constant, r is radius of the ultramicroelectrode, and C is the bulk concentration of the electroactive species. In Fig. 5, the steady-state currents of anodic I− and the cathodic I3− reactions are shown. The addition of POEM had caused I− diffusion to be much higher than that of I3−. The dominance of I− diffusion in the I−/I3− couple is due to its smaller ionic size than that of I3−. In Table 1, the mobility (Dapp) for I− at 1.26 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 was much higher than 9.6 × 10−7 cm2 s−1 without adding MWCNT/POEM. This enhancement resulted from the addition of 0.25 wt% of the MWCNT hybrid. It is explained that the presence of the POE segment in POEM could chelate Li+ ions and cause the ionic pair separation and mobility of the counter I− ions. Further increase in the amounts of MWCNT/POEM hybrid from 2.00 and 5.00 wt% in the gel electrolytes decreased the values of Dapp for I− and I3− ionic diffusions. This is due to the MWCNT aggregation that was observed by DSC as mentioned above. The degree of aggregation may substantially offset the advantages of the MWCNT characters such as large aspect ratios, excellent electron transport and strong catalytic ability.34

3.5. Impedance in DSSC
The interfacial charge-transfer resistance of a DSSC is usually studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). An electrochemical and photoelectrochemical method was used to analyze the variations in the impedances associated with the different interfaces of a DSSC.46Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plots of the DSSC at 100 mW cm−2 illumination. Each plot comprises three semi-circles at different ranges of frequencies. The semi-circles are denoted with Rct1, Rct2, and Rw referring to the charge-transfer resistance at the interface of the counter electrode and gel electrolyte, the interface of the photoanode and gel electrolyte, and the resistance for Warburg diffusion of the I−/I3− redox couple in the gel electrolyte, respectively.47 Since the values of Rct1 and Rct2 for the DSSCs with various electrolytes are only slightly different from each other, we believe that the difference in the η of DSSCs is essentially due to their difference in Rw (Table 1). Among all the gel electrolytes shown in Table 1, the Rw of the DSSC using a pristine PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte gave the largest value of 17.56 Ω; thereby rendering the lowest η of 4.63%. In comparison, the DSSC with the optimized amount of 0.25 wt% MWCNT/POEM hybrids in the gel electrolyte delivered the smallest Rw of 4.27 Ω. Thus, a corresponding highest η of 6.86% of DSSC was obtained. This is consistent with the highest Dapp (I−) of 2.10 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 obtained for the DSSC with the gel electrolyte containing 0.25 wt% MWCNT/POEM.
 Fig. 6  EIS spectra of DSSCs with gel electrolyte containing various additives (a) pristine, (b) 0.25 wt% POEM, (c) 0.05 wt% MWCNT/POEM, (d) 0.25 wt% MWCNT/POEM, (e) 2.00 wt% MWCNT/POEM, and (f) 5.00 wt% MWCNT/POEM at 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The inset shows the corresponding equivalent circuit model. 
Correspondingly, the Bode phase plots in Fig. 7 exhibit the characteristic frequency peak (f) in the frequency range from 1 to 1000 Hz. The value of f can be obtained by drawing tangents to the peaks and thereby identifying the accurate points of frequency on the x-axis corresponding to the peaks. Thus, the values of f for the cases of pristine PVDF-HFP, PVDF-HFP with 0.25 wt% POEM, and PVDF-HFP with 0.25 wt% MWCNT/POEM were obtained to be 12.3, 13.8, and 15.4 Hz, respectively. It is known that the value of f is inversely proportional to the electron lifetime.48 The longer electron lifetime in the TiO2 thin film of a DSSC has to do with the increased VOC of the cells. Thus, the case of pristine PVDF-HFP gave the largest VOC among these three cases. However, the lowest VOC was acquired for the case of PVDF-HFP with 0.25 wt% MWCNT/POEM. This is in accordance with the tendency of VOC for the three cases (PVDF-HFP, PVDF-HFP with 0.25 wt% POEM, and PVDF-HFP with 0.25 wt% MWCNT/POEM) (Table 1).

4. Conclusions
The functionalities in the poly(oxyethylene)-segmented amide-imide structure (POEM) enabled it to interact with the MWCNT surface and subsequently form homogeneous matrices with the (PVDF–HFP) copolymers in gel electrolytes. The resultant quasi-solid-state DSSC has achieved an enhanced efficiency and performance. In the POEM structure, the presence of aromatic and amide-imide functionalities could generate noncovalent bonds such as π–π stacking interactions with MWCNT and POE segments chelating with Li+ ions in the electrolytes. From LSV and EIS analyses, the conductance of the triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox couples was promoted. When the gel electrolyte was used in DSSC, the performance was highly related to the optimized MWCNT/POEM ratio at 1/20 (w/w) and the loading amount. The optimal amount of 0.25 wt% MWCNT/POEM achieved the maximum DSSC performance at 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. The short-circuit current density (JSC) and power-conversion efficiency (η) reached 15.3 mA cm−2 and 6.86%, significantly increased from 9.59 mA cm−2 and 4.63%, respectively.
