    , Accepted 8th May 2018First published on 10th May 2018AbstractIn this report, we explore the underlying mechanisms by which doped organic thin films as a top hole-selective layer (HSL) improve the performance and stability of colloidal quantum dot (CQD)-based solar cells. Molecular dynamics-based theoretical studies prove that the hydro/oxo-phobic properties of the HSL serve to efficiently passivate the CQD solid. Furthermore, the robust and outstanding electrical properties of the HSL, simultaneously ensure a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and increase the stability performance of CQD-based solar cells. As a result, a best PCE of 11.7% in a lead sulfide (PbS)-based CQD solar cell is achieved and over 90% of the initial performance is retained after 1 year storage under ambient conditions.

Broader context
Emerging technologies of the next generation of solar cells have been developed through various new materials and device engineering strategies. Especially, from a commercial perspective, enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE), the stability, and the figure of merit (FOM) of the devices with low cost fabrication processes, is crucial. Colloidal quantum dot-based photovoltaics have advantages in near-infrared absorption, boosting light harvesting. Recent advances in CQD device engineering led to a PCE of ∼11%; however, the PCE needs further increasing. Herein, a hydro/oxo-phobic hole selective layer (HSL) was introduced in PbS solar cells to increase both the PCE and the stability. The robust and excellent electrical properties of the HSL substantially improved the internal charge extraction, and simultaneously, the hydro/oxo-phobic nature of the HSL efficiently blocked the oxygen and moisture permeation into the CQD layer. Furthermore, the HSL pinned the Fermi level, enabling the replacement of an Au electrode with Ag, and thereby reducing the fabrication cost. Finally, our device exhibited a PCE of 11.7% and maintained over 90% of initial performance when stored for 1 year under ambient conditions.

Introduction
Currently, colloidal quantum dot (CQD)-based solar cells are drawing special attention as potential candidates for next generation solar cells1 because their optical properties can be efficiently controlled by changing the quantum dot size. In addition, the multiplication of charge carriers can boost efficiencies beyond the theoretically predicted efficiency limit of single junction solar cells.2,3
Advances in the field of CQD-based solar cells have been achieved by adopting various device engineering schemes including depleted heterojunction,4 plasmonic metal nanostructure,5,6 and band energy alignment7 to efficiently harvest incident photons and photo-generated carriers. In particular, careful surface engineering of CQDs is one of the key issues because optoelectronic properties of the underlying semiconducting layers strongly depend on the surface states in CQDs,8,9 leading to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 11%.10 Recent advances in high performance CQD-based solar cells were achieved by using an iodide-based ligand/1,2-ethandithiol (EDT)-treated double CQD layer structure;7,11 typically, a Au top electrode was deposited on the CQD layer.
Appropriate engineering of the interfacial layers between the CQD layer and the electrodes pins the Fermi level, thereby allowing greater flexibility in the choice of material for the top electrode.12 Therefore, the costly Au could be replaced with Ag or Al with shallower work functions. Moreover, the interfacial layers could enhance the stability of performance13 as well as boost the carrier collection efficiency. Nevertheless, to date, only a few studies have reported on interfacial layer engineering in CQD-based solar cells. Several studies have adopted a molybdenum oxide (MoO3) layer as the interfacial layer; however, despite its wide use in solar cells to achieve high performance, the MoO3 layer has serious stability issues.14,15 Therefore, the development of a new strategy to simultaneously improve both PCE and stability while using a low cost electrode material is indispensable.16
In this report, we found that a small molecular layer, a p-doped N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-benzidine (MeO-TPD), passivated on the PbS layer could notably enhance the stability of CQD solids. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the hydro/oxo-phobic organic layer significantly delays the oxygen and water permeation into the PbS layer. Furthermore, the efficient injection of holes in the p-MeO-TPD layer reduces the interfacial resistance and improves performance.
We applied the hydro/oxo-phobic organic layer as a hole selective layer (HSL) for efficient and stable CQD-based solar cells. Our schemes were tested in iodide-based ligand treated CQD devices to confirm the versatility of this technique. As a result, a PCE of 11.7% was achieved by including an efficient light trapping structure on the optimized device. Finally, the EMII/EDT-deposited CQD PVs utilizing the layer retained over 90% of the initial PCE after 1 year without any encapsulation.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a illustrates the equilibrated hydro/oxophobic pore structure of the organic materials used in this report. To understand the role of the MeO-TPD layer in preventing oxygen penetration at the molecular level, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as described in Fig. 1a and b. Using the cohesive energy density (CED) method,17 we obtained the fully equilibrated structure of an amorphous MeO-TPD film. When the MeO-TPD molecules are randomly packed in the condensed phase, our simulation results showed that (1) the molecules are rather densely packed in the film with a calculated equilibrium density of 0.98 g cm−3, and (2) the more polar and smaller MeO functional groups tend to interact with each other, while the non-polar and rigid phenyl rings fill the nanoscale cavities (Fig. 1a). This makes the micropores in the film chemically inert and renders them hydro/oxo-phobic.

(blue) oxygen content and (gray) sulfur content in the CQD-based device with and without the p-MeO-TPD layer, respectively. 
For a more quantitative assessment of the oxygen barrier properties of the MeO-TPD film, we further calculated the O2 permeability coefficient (P) from the solubility (kH: Henry's constant) and the diffusion coefficient (D) of the penetrant.18 We calculated kH to be 0.027 cm3 (STP) cm−3 atm−1 using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation (Fig. 1b).18,19 We note that this value is more than one order of magnitude lower than the solubility of oxygen in well-known O2 barrier polymeric membranes such as polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) (cf. kH(PVDC) = 0.75–0.92, kH(PP) = 0.53–0.74, kH(PET) = 0.46–0.68, and kH(PVOH) = 0.41–0.50); cited values are in cm3 (STP) cm−3 atm−1 and taken from a previous GCMC simulation study.20 This result clearly shows that the micropores in the MeO-TPD film are highly oxophobic and impermeable to oxygen dissolution. The diffusion constant (D) of the entrapped O2 is also calculated from MD simulations to be 1.08 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. This yields a value for the O2 permeability constant P = kH × D = 2.91 × 10−8 cm3 (STP) cm−1 s−1 atm−1, which is of the same order of magnitude as the experimental P value of PP, that is, 2.14 × 10−8 cm3 (STP) cm−1 s−1 atm−1,21 confirming the good oxygen barrier properties of the MeO-TPD layer.
Additionally, it also turns out to be a water barrier as elucidated in ESI† (Fig. S1 and S2). The H2O solubility (kH) of MeO-TPD was calculated as 6.66 cm3 (STP) cm−3 atm−1, similar to the kH value of polyvinylidiene chloride (PVDC), 6.5–10.2 cm3 (STP) cm−3 atm−1. The diffusion coefficient (D) was determined by MSD as a function of simulation time to be 5.67 × 10−7 cm2 s−1, yielding permeability P = kH × D = 3.78 × 10−6 cm3 (STP) cm−1 s−1 atm−1. This is comparable water barrier property to the 0.5 mm thick polyacrilonitrile (PAN), which permeability is 2.28 × 10−6 cm3 (STP) cm−1 atm−1 s−1. Using atomistic simulations, we elucidated that due to the dense packing of the MeO-TPD molecules, the intermolecular cavity space is occupied by phenyl rings, which are chemically inert and hydro/oxo-phobic. This significantly lowers the solubility of oxygen in the film and also restricts the diffusion of entrapped oxygen molecules, thus resulting in outstanding oxygen barrier properties.
Time of flight-secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMs) was performed to verify the MD simulation results as shown in Fig. 1d and Fig. S3 (ESI†). The TOF-SIMs results depicted the oxygen penetration level into the PbS layer observed with time. The 3D image of the oxygen and sulfur anions was illustrated to verify the oxygen content in the PbS layer. Indeed, the PbS film without the MeO-TPD film showed a notable increment of oxygen concentration, whereas, the oxygen variance was relatively low for the MeO-TPD layer-deposited device, after 60 days of air exposure (Fig. S3, ESI†). The TOF-SIMs and MD simulation results indicated that the p-MeO-TPD layer partially acts as an encapsulating layer from oxygen permeation, delaying the constituent change of the PbS layer.
Next, we utilized the MeO-TPD layer in PbS-based CQD solar cells and the schematic illustration of the device structure is shown in Fig. 2a. The scheme of the overall device structure is ITO/ZnO/PbS-PbI/PbS-MPA/(with or without) HSL/Ag electrode and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-sectional image clearly depicts the corresponding layers. The total thickness of the PbS QD layer (PbS-PbI/PbS-MPA) was ∼330 nm.

The device structure is glass/ITO (150 nm)/ZnO (25 nm)/PbS-I (290 nm)/PbS-MPA (35 nm)/MeO-TPD (5 nm)/p-MeO-TPD (50 nm)/Ag electrode (150 nm). TEM cross-section images of the devices. Scale bar: 50 nm. (b) Energy level of each layer in the p-MeO-TPD-deposited CQD-based solar cells. 
The MeO-TPD layer was utilized on the PbS layer as a top HSL. To give efficient hole injection, a p-type organic dopant, 2,2-(perfluoronaphthalene-2,6-diylidene)dimalononitrile (F6-TCNNQ), was incorporated in the MeO-TPD layer, forming p-MeO-TPD, and the molecular structures and doping mechanism are described in Fig. S4 (ESI†).22,23 The p-MeO-TPD utilized in this structure (Fig. 2a) served as a excellent HSL layer as follows: (1) by pinning the Fermi level, allowing the replacement of an Au electrode with Ag, (2) by providing sufficient holes, thereby enhancing the electrical properties of the device, and (3) by protecting the PbS layer from the oxygen and moisture because of the hydro/oxo-phobic nature.
Next, we explored the band alignments in the overall device structure in detail; these are depicted in Fig. 2b. We used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to determine the energy level of the individual layers as shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†). As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the HOMO level (5.1 eV) of the p-MeO-TPD layer is well aligned to the valence band (Ev = 5.26 eV) of the PbS-MPA layer. On the contrary, the MoO3 layer has a deeper work function (5.7 eV) than the p-MeO-TPD. This builds a high extraction barrier and presumably lowers the performance of the CQDs-based solar cells.12,24 The photoluminescence (PL) measurement results (Fig. S6, ESI†) also support that a well-aligned energy level of a p-MeO-TPD layer with that of the CQDs provides a more efficient charge extraction path compared to a MoO3 layer.

Fig. 3a depicts the representative J–V characteristics of CQD-based solar cells without and with HSLs; the detailed device performances are summarized in Table 1. For comparison, we fabricated a device using a vacuum-processed MoO3 layer (20 nm), which is commonly used as a HSL in organic and CQD-based solar cells.12 The device without HSLs showed a low Voc value of ∼0.35 V, a low fill factor (FF) of 0.37, and an average PCE of 2.4% (best PCE: 2.6%). For the MoO3 layer-deposited device, the Voc was considerably enhanced from 0.35 V to 0.51 V with a relatively high FF (∼0.49), compared to the control device. The best PCE was 6.3% with a 142% enhancement. When p-MeO-TPD was used as a HSL, the highest PCE (9.04%) was achieved. Thus, the PCE was improved by 248% and 44% as compared to devices without a HSL, and with a MoO3 layer, respectively. Especially, the p-MeO-TPD-deposited device had a high FF of 0.61 and the short circuit current density (Jsc) was also significantly enhanced. The statistical histogram (Fig. S7, ESI†) clearly illustrates the improved performance of p-MeO-TPD-based solar cells.

We measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) to confirm the Jsc enhancement of p-MeO-TPD-deposited solar cells. As shown in Fig. 3b, both the HSLs (MoO3 and p-MeO-TPD) enhanced the EQE but the p-MeO-TPD-based solar cells performed particularly well and showed higher EQE values than the MoO3-based devices in the whole wavelength range studied. The Jsc values calculated from EQE measurements are 21.1 mA cm−2 (without HSL), 25.4 mA cm−2 (MoO3) and 27.6 mA cm−2 (p-MeO-TPD), which agree reasonably with the Jsc values determined from J–V characteristics.
In particular, we noticed the substantial FF enhancement in devices utilizing the p-MeO-TPD layer. The p-MeO-TPD-deposited device had a considerably lower series resistance (1.97 Ω cm2) than the MoO3-deposited device (365 Ω cm2), which is calculated from the dark J–V curves (Fig. S8, ESI†). To understand the FF enhancement of p-MeO-TPD-deposited devices, we obtained the biased EQE for the p-MeO-TPD and MoO3 layer-deposited devices (Fig. 3c). More details on this characterization are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Typically, the reduction of EQE under forward bias does not depend on the wavelength.25 Thus, the MoO3-deposited solar cells did not show wavelength dependence, whereas the performance of the p-MeO-TPD-deposited devices clearly depended on the wavelength. In particular, the EQEs in the longer wavelength region from 700 to 1000 nm rapidly decreased. It was found that the photocurrent from the light source of the EQE measurement setup at those wavelengths was at a similar level to the dark current of the devices. Fig. 3c also shows the relative charge generation profile and it is seen that charge generation is concentrated near the HSL in the wavelength range 700–1000 nm. For the p-MeO-TPD layer-deposited device, under forward bias, the photo-generated carriers near the HSL could easily recombine with the abundantly injected carriers from the p-MeO-TPD side. On the other hand, because of the low carrier injection efficiency of MoO3 under the forward bias condition, active charge recombination near the HSL did not occur, even when the charge generation profile was similar to that for the p-MeO-TPD-based solar cells. Therefore, it can be concluded that the FF enhancement is principally due to the combined effect of a well-designed device structure and the p-doped characteristics of the p-MeO-TPD layer.26
The stability performance of CQD-based solar cells without and with HSLs (MoO3 and p-MeO-TPD) was assessed. For stability assessment, all devices were stored under ambient conditions without encapsulation. Fig. 4a depicts the normalized solar cell parameters of the CQD-based devices without and with HSLs. The p-MeO-TPD-deposited device maintained >90% of the initial PCE value during 6 months, whereas the PCE of MoO3-deposited devices rapidly decreased over time; the PCE dropped to 10% of the initial value after 6 months. In particular, the FF of the MoO3-deposited device rapidly reduced during the first 20 days, following which the Jsc and Voc sequentially decreased. The FF reduction is caused by the decreased stability of the electrical properties of the MoO3 layer over time. Interestingly, although the CQD-based solar cells without any HSLs showed poor initial performance (Fig. 3a), their stability surpassed the MoO3-deposited device during the time period of 6 months (Fig. 4a).

The Au electrode was used. 
To reveal the origin of the rapid FF degradation in MoO3-deposited devices, we measured the conductivities of MoO3 and p-MeO-TPD layers as described in Fig. 4b. The initial conductivity of the p-MeO-TPD layer was 2.5 × 10−4 S cm−1, which is 3 times higher than that of the MoO3 layer (∼8.0 × 10−5 S cm−1). While the conductivity of the p-MeO-TPD device remained constant for one month, the conductivity of the MoO3 layer decreased dramatically to 1.2 × 10−6 S cm−1 after only 7 days. Thus, it is inferred that the observed FF reduction of MoO3-deposited devices is mainly due to the reduced conductivity. The reduction in conductivity of the MoO3-deposited devices was caused by the change in the oxidation state in the MoOx layer.27 Exposure of the MoOx layer to air leads to a change in stoichiometry by modifying the O/Mo ratio. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) binding energy spectra of the MoOx layer clearly showed that the O/Mo ratio increased from 2.7 to 3.2, causing the increase in resistivity of the film as described in Fig. S10 (ESI†).27 On the other hand, the XPS of the p-MeO-TPD layer retained the initial binding energies even after 20 days, (Fig. S11, ESI†) implying that the MeO-TPD host and the F6-TCNNQ dopant molecules are relatively stable. It is known that upon air exposure, the formation of O2(H2O)2 complexes leads to the creation of deep electron traps (∼3.6 eV) in organic films, causing the degradation of organic semiconductors. In the case of the F6-TCNNQ dopant, due to its relatively high electron affinity (5.0 eV), electrons were not lost to the trap states (∼3.6 eV) and the p-doping effect was maintained with respect to the MeO-TPD layer. As a result, the p-MeO-TPD layer showed robust electrical properties.
Furthermore, the performance of devices without any HSLs also decreased, which implies that the PbS layer could also be degraded upon air exposure (Fig. 4a). It has been known that the increased presence of oxygen molecules28 or hydroxyl groups16 could change the optoelectrical properties of a PbS layer. Since the hydro/oxo-phobic properties of the HSL inhibit the PbS layer from degrading by oxygen and moisture as discussed in Fig. 1, the p-MeO-TPD layer-deposited CQD solar cells showed outstanding air stability performance. Fig. S12 (ESI†) reveals that the stability performance of a p-MeO-TPD layer was enhanced as the HSL layer thickness increased. We tested 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII) as an iodide-based ligand16 and used a 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT)-treated PbS layer (PbS-EDT). The p-MeO-TPD layer enhanced the PCE of EMII-based solar cells from 8.82% to 10.15%, by increasing the Jsc and FF as depicted in Fig. 4c and Table 2. We also examined the addition of a p-MeO-TPD layer to EMII-based devices with different sizes of PbS QDs and the best performance (PCE: 10.7%) was achieved as described in Fig. S13 and Table S1 (ESI†). Furthermore, we observed that the performance of electrically optimized, CQDs-based solar cells with a p-MeO-TPD layer could be synergistically maximized with the help of appropriate light managing schemes. We integrated two types of ray-optical light trapping schemes, such as V-groove and V-compound parabolic trapper (V-CPT) reported previously,29 in the EMII-based solar cells shown in Fig. 4c. Utilizing the V-groove structure enhanced the PCE of the solar cells from 10.15% to 10.9% and V-CPT achieved a PCE of 11.7% with a 15.3% enhancement (Table 2 and Fig. S14, ESI†). Finally, we assessed the air stability of the EMII-treated CQD device as depicted in Fig. 4d. For this study, the typical Au electrode was used to compare with previous results.10,16 The p-MeO-TPD/Au-deposited device showed air stability performance without encapsulation, retaining over 90% of initial performance after 1 year storage under ambient conditions.

Conclusions
In summary, we systematically investigated the role of a p-type doped organic host material used as a top HSL for efficient and stable CQD-based solar cells. The durable high electrical and hydro/oxo-phobic properties of the p-MeO-TPD layer efficiently protect the PbS layer, thereby achieving excellent stability performance and a PCE of 11.7%. This work demonstrates a promising way to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability while using a low cost electrode and we believe that the schemes proposed in this study have great potential to be applied in various optoelectronic devices.
Experimental methods
Device fabrication
Oleic acid-capped PbS QDs were prepared as previously described.30 The sol–gel ZnO layer was deposited by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. A 20–30 nm thick ZnO layer was formed after heat treatment (200 °C, 10 min). PbS-PbI QDs films were coated on the ZnO layer using a LBL spin coating process. Ten layers (thickness: ∼290 nm) were coated using a PbI ligand. In addition, two layers of 3-mercaoptopropaionic acid (MPA) treated PbS QDs were sequentially deposited. The total thickness of the PbS-MPA layer was ∼40 nm. Finally, a Ag electrode (150 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation onto the CQD films through a shadow mask. In the case of MoO3-deposited CQD devices, a 20 nm thick MoO3 layer was thermally evaporated (0.2 Å s−1) before depositing the Ag electrode. p-MeO-TPD was formed by the co-evaporation of MeO-TPD (sublimed, >99%, Lumtec, Taiwan) and F6-TCNNQ (Novaled GmbH, Germany). Each deposition rate was monitored separately. The deposition rate was 0.5 Å s−1 and 0.05 Å s−1, respectively, and the doping concentration was 8.40 wt% (0.154 molar ratio), (calculated as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). The conductivity of the doped films exceeded 10−4 S cm−1, and it can be easily controlled by changing the concentration properly.23 Before depositing the p-MeO-TPD layer, 5 nm of an intrinsic MeO-TPD layer were deposited onto the CQDs films to prevent exciton quenching by the dopants at the CQDs layer/p-MeO-TPD interface. The base pressure kept under 2.0 × 10−7 Torr during the thermal evaporation. Both light trapping structures that were made of PDMS were laminated on the glass side of the CQDs devices. The V-CPT comprised the 1D V-groove and compound parabolic trapper (CPT), where a V-groove structure was stacked on the CPT perpendicularly (Fig. 4c).

Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a solar simulator (K3000 LAB55, McScience Inc.) under 100 mW cm−2 power from a 150 W Xe short-arc lamp filtered by an AM 1.5G filter. A 6.25 mm2 mask was attached to the device to clearly define the active area. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with a spectral measurement system (K3100 IQX, McScience Inc.). Bias EQE was measured under bias voltage conditions (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 V) during the EQE measurement. The spectral reflection of the solar cells was measured immediately after the EQE measurement at the same spot. It should be noted that the estimated absorption includes not only the absorption of the active materials but also parasitic absorption by the Ag electrode and the ZnO layer. The cross-sectional image of a device was obtained with a focused-ion-beam (FIB, Helios 450 F1) and a field-emission TEM (300 keV). The TMF and MD simulations are described in ESI.†

Broader context
Emerging technologies of the next generation of solar cells have been developed through various new materials and device engineering strategies. Especially, from a commercial perspective, enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE), the stability, and the figure of merit (FOM) of the devices with low cost fabrication processes, is crucial. Colloidal quantum dot-based photovoltaics have advantages in near-infrared absorption, boosting light harvesting. Recent advances in CQD device engineering led to a PCE of ∼11%; however, the PCE needs further increasing. Herein, a hydro/oxo-phobic hole selective layer (HSL) was introduced in PbS solar cells to increase both the PCE and the stability. The robust and excellent electrical properties of the HSL substantially improved the internal charge extraction, and simultaneously, the hydro/oxo-phobic nature of the HSL efficiently blocked the oxygen and moisture permeation into the CQD layer. Furthermore, the HSL pinned the Fermi level, enabling the replacement of an Au electrode with Ag, and thereby reducing the fabrication cost. Finally, our device exhibited a PCE of 11.7% and maintained over 90% of initial performance when stored for 1 year under ambient conditions.
