, Accepted 13th June 2023First published on 17th June 2023AbstractEco-friendly nanocrystals have attracted worldwide attention in recent years due to the ultrahigh absorption coefficient, broad absorbance range and non-toxic atoms of heavy metals e.g., lead and cadmium. With these benefits, the photovoltaic performance of eco-friendly nanocrystal solar cells (AgBiS2) has reached over 9% and they have great potential for application in the field of nanocrystal solar cells.

Firstly, we discuss the synthesis methods of eco-friendly nanocrystals and highlight the key elements for high-quality nanocrystals. Thereafter, ligand exchange strategies are summarized to further enhance the performance of AgBiS2 solar cells. Subsequently, we focus on device structure and present an in-depth discussion on the photovoltaic stability to balance the performance and stability of AgBiS2 solar cells. Finally, the remaining challenges and our insights are proposed to further advance the development of eco-friendly solar cells based on AgBiS2 nanocrystals.
1. Introduction
Environmental pollution and energy crises have placed great threats on human survival and development, prompting the growing motivation to develop sustainable and green energy harvesting technologies. Solar energy is one of the most promising clean resources, which can greatly offset serious energy crises. Photovoltaic technology can convert solar energy into electric power, presenting great potential in meeting the energy needs of human beings. Organic, quantum dots (QDs) and perovskite solar cells as the third generation of photovoltaics have attracted broad research interest during the past decade.1–7 Organic solar cells with great flexibility, lightweight, and excellent processing properties have been quickly developed in wearable devices and buildings.8–14 However, it is generally established that organic solar cells suffer from notorious instability when exposed to air and light, which places great restrictions on their commercial applications.15 Quantum dots are partially composed of the II–VI (for example, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, and ZnS) and IV–VI (for example, PbS and PbSe) group nanocrystals with the characteristics of the surface effect and the quantum confinement effect, and have great application potential in the fields of optoelectronics and biofluorescent labeling.16–21
Nevertheless, these nanocrystal materials with heavy metals, e.g., lead and cadmium, are extremely hazardous when present in the water supply or the atmosphere. In recent years, abundant research attention has been focused on the environmentally friendly I–III–VI, I–V–VI, and I–VI group nanocrystal solar cells.22–25 High-performance and eco-friendly Zn-Cu–In–S–Se nanocrystal materials have enabled great power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 15% for dye-sensitized solar cells.26,27 Novel Ag-based nanocrystals with a direct bandgap and high absorption coefficient e.g., Ag3BiI6, AgBiSe2 and AgBiS2, have enhanced the performance of solar cells with planar heterojunctions to 5.44%, 2.61%, and 9.17%, respectively.28–30
AgBiS2 nanocrystals generally exhibit two phase crystallizations of the α phase (Schapbachite) with rock salt structure and the β phase (Matildite) with orthorhombic structure as illustrated in Fig. 1a.31 More strikingly, AgBiS2 nanocrystals exhibit the inhomogeneous cationic disorder, i.e., the disordered atom arrangement, which results in the local enrichment regions of Ag and Bi. Thermal annealing can accelerate the cation site exchange in AgBiS2 nanocrystals and the transition of the nanocrystal structure from cation segregation to homogeneous cation disorder, which can lead to a significant increase of the refractive index and the transition dipole matrix element, resulting in an ultrahigh absorption coefficient of ∼106 cm−1 as illustrated in Fig. 1b. It is 5–10 times higher than that of other photovoltaic materials as shown in Fig. 1c, which can contribute to a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 27.11 mA cm−2 with ∼30 nm active layer (Fig. 1d and e).30,32 The absorption of the semiconductor layer is mainly determined by its intrinsic material properties (complex refractive index n + iκ) and thickness. Many factors, e.g., nanocrystal radius and surface ligands will influence the optical absorption of nanocrystals. However, quantum dot materials e.g., PbS, do not have cation segregation and will damage the original structure and the corresponding device performance, when treated with thermal annealing at a temperature of above 90 °C. Regulating the exchange of cation sites in multicomponent materials by changing the processing conditions is a feasible strategy for modifying the characteristics of materials. However, the impact of cation disorder on the performance of various materials has to be investigated.

Additionally, ultrathin solar cells can significantly reduce the cost of materials and improve the efficiency of carrier collection for active layers with limited carrier diffusion, which is favorable for commercial applications. Meanwhile, AgBiS2 nanocrystals present a narrow bandgap (1–1.5 eV), a high absorption coefficient and a wide absorption range (300–1200 nm), which together results in a photovoltaic performance breakthrough of over 9% (Fig. 1f).30,33,34 As shown in Fig. 1b, the absorption of AgBiS2 nanocrystals decreased rapidly within the range of 800–1200 nm, which may be a key factor restricting the improvement of device efficiency.30 Enhancing surface passivation, finding more effective charge transport layers and optimizing the device structure may complement the absorption edge loss. A small radius with a larger specific surface area may lead to ligand shedding and insufficient passivation, which may damage the optical absorption of AgBiS2 nanocrystals.35 The optical absorption loss within 800–1200 nm can be slightly compensated by adjusting the cation disorder and radius of nanocrystals. Moreover, seeking out a feasible interface layer to offer complementary optical absorption with AgBiS2 nanocrystals may mitigate the rapid decline of the optical absorption.
To further advance the progress of eco-friendly QD solar cells, we present a comprehensive and critical review, focusing on the strategies for performance and stability improvement of AgBiS2 solar cells. Firstly, we discuss the synthesis methods of AgBiS2 nanocrystals in detail and highlight the impact of size distribution and stoichiometric ratio on high-performance solar cells. Subsequently, ligand exchange strategies are reviewed extensively to reveal the great superiority of solution-phase ligand exchange in further enhancing large-scale applications of AgBiS2 solar cells. Additionally, we focus on the existing device structure and offer an in-depth discussion on the photovoltaic stability of AgBiS2 solar cells. Finally, the remaining challenges and our perspectives are provided to further advance the progress of these eco-friendly solar cells.
2. Synthesis method
2.1 Hot injection method
In 2013, AgBiS2 nanocrystals were employed to fabricate sensitized solar cells, which can only achieve a PCE of less than 1%.36 In 2016, Konstantatos's group reported a 6.3%-efficiency AgBiS2 solar cell based on a hot injection method, which is a commonly used synthesis method of QDs.37 As shown in Fig. 2, Bi(OAc)3, Ag(OAc), and oleic acid (OA) were initially mixed at 100 °C to form the compound of Bi and Ag oleates. Subsequently, hexamethyldisilathiane (HMS) dissolved in 1-octadecene (ODE) was quickly injected into the mixed solution under an inert gas atmosphere to form AgBiS2 nanocrystals. Various synthesis strategies have been developed in this process, such as altering the feeding ratio or solution concentration, which has a great impact on the electrical properties of AgBiS2 nanocrystals.
 Fig. 2  Schematic diagram of the hot injection synthesis method for AgBiS2 nanocrystals at the center of the image and six various modified synthesis routes. 
We summarize the recent advances in synthesis strategies for high-performance AgBiS2 nanocrystals from recent years in Fig. 2. The hot injection method is based on two key aspects of metal precursor solution and sulfur element. Firstly, we discuss the recent progress of metal precursor solution and provide an in-depth understanding of the relationship between the size distribution and the stoichiometric ratio. Huang et al. reported that amines and Ag cations with complex structures can increase the solubility of Ag(OAc) in oleamine (OLA).38 It was worth noting that the Ag content of the modified AgBiS2 nanocrystals is higher than that of the control samples, resulting in the better stoichiometric ratios and nanocrystal size distribution. Moreover, Johansson's group systematically investigated the impact of feeding ratios for two metal precursors on the photovoltaic performance of solar cells, and found that Ag content played a key role in the synthesis of AgBiS2 nanocrystals.39 Strikingly, the nanocrystals synthesized by the ideal feeding ratio (0.72:0.9:1) were Ag-rich and trended to reach small sizes. Kim et al. pre-added non-coordination ODE solvent into metal precursor solutions to balance the nucleation and growth of nanocrystals during the synthesis process and demonstrated that Ag-rich solution can also result in a smaller size and more stable surface termination energy.40 The monodisperse AgBiS2 nanocrystals with smaller size distribution can be prepared due to the slight change of temperature and overall concentration of precursor solution after injecting sulfur precursor at a quicker rate. The energy level of nanocrystals was varied with different nanoparticle radii and stoichiometric ratios, which in turn impacted the optoelectronic properties of solar cells.41
We proceed to discuss the relationship between size distribution and device performance in detail, as well as offer some insights on further enhancing device performance and stability. Konstantatos's research discovered that injecting HMS in two steps increased the average particle size from 4.3 nm to 6.5 nm, leading to the reduced mid-gap trap density and the improved photocurrent by ∼4 mA cm−2.42 To further advance band alignment and improve charge transport, mixing small-size and large-size AgBiS2 nanocrystals was carried out to achieve the higher Jsc at a thick active layer.35
The commercial applications of AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells require low costs of both materials and processing. It is critical to seek out substitute materials to replace the expensive and pungent HMS for the commercial development of AgBiS2 nanocrystals. Lau et al. dissolved the sulfur powder in a long-chain amine solution, e.g., octylamine (OTA) or dodecyl amine (DDA), and amines acted as soft ligands to prevent the nucleus coalescence of AgBiS2 nanocrystals.43 Similarly, Zhang et al. employed OLA-S to synthesize the AgBiS2 nanocrystals with a reduced cost by ∼57%. Nevertheless, the size distribution was substantially increased (7.8 ± 1.9 nm), which may compromise the corresponding photovoltaic performance.44
From the above discussions, we can determine that stoichiometric ratio has a great impact on size distribution and Ag-rich AgBiS2 nanocrystals will generally achieve smaller particle sizes. Additionally, synthesis cost is still the main factor limiting the commercial application of AgBiS2 nanocrystals, indicating that more attention should be paid to developing low-cost and high-quality AgBiS2 nanocrystals.
2.2 Room-temperature method
Generally, it is highly essential to develop an unvented environment and high synthesis temperature for nanocrystal nucleation and growth, which will result in significantly increased synthesis costs. Compared to hot injection synthesis, room-temperature synthesis can not only simplify the synthesis process but also significantly reduce the cost of complex materials and high-temperature conditions. AgBiS2 nanorods with a diameter of 50 nm and a length of 180 nm were grown on the substrate by coating AgCl, BiCl3, and thiourea precursor solution and subsequently annealing under an inert atmosphere.45 Similarly, some reports proposed that mixing three different types of precursors in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at room temperature and manufacturing through spin-coating and thermal annealing can also produce the favorable AgBiS2 nanocrystals.37,46,47 Moreover, the sequential ion layer adsorption reaction (SILAR) technique without further ligand exchange and passivation steps was reported to reduce the trap state density, which has great potential in low-cost photoelectric devices.36,48 Additionally, Konstantatos's group used sulfur powder and amine to synthesize AgBiS2 nanocrystals with Bi-rich (Ag:Bi, 1:1.30) elemental composition at room temperature and the developed solar cells achieved a PCE of more than 5% with great potential due to the use of air-stable and low-cost chemicals.49 To date, there have been abundant investigations on hot injection synthesis, which may have great potential for application in the commercialization of AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells. More research efforts should be devoted to room-temperature synthesis methods in the near future. The development of cost-effective room-temperature methods will be a promising direction in advancing the commercial application of AgBiS2 solar cells.
3. Ligand exchange
3.1 Solid-state ligand exchange
Oleic acid and other long-chain ligands block the charge transport of the synthesized nanocrystals and must be replaced with short-chain ligands to further enhance the conductivity of nanocrystal films. The two most commonly used methods are solid-state ligand exchange (SSLE) and solution-phase ligand exchange (SPLE), as depicted in Fig. 3.50 Depositing AgBiS2 nanocrystals with an SSLE process to prepare the active layer is a viable approach in research laboratories. Nevertheless, the method is not feasible for large-scale applications due to the high costs of materials and solvents, film defects and carrier recombination. The advancement of SPLE techniques that are compatible with single-step deposition procedures, e.g., inkjet printing or spraying, is required. Moreover, the SPLE process can greatly reduce the material cost, deposition steps, and the defect density of films. Sargent's group discovered that PbS inks with hybrid organic–inorganic ligands via the SPLE process can remove organic residues and achieve a record device efficiency of 11.28%, which revealed the great potential of SPLE techniques.51 Fig. 4a depicts the commonly used short-chain ligands in AgBiS2 nanocrystals. Konstantatos et al. discovered that tetramethylammonium iodide (TMAI) ligand has a greater binding energy with Bi atoms compared to ethanedithiol (EDT), which may be mainly attributed to the stronger binding of halide ligand, resulting in the lower electron density around Bi atoms.37 High electron densities are generally easy to form n-type doping and higher trap densities, which may lead to an inferior device performance. With these benefits, halide ligands such as TMAI are more appropriate for surface ligand passivation of AgBiS2 nanocrystals. However, Wang et al. reported that using TMAI as the short-chain ligand for AgBiS2 nanocrystals can only enable a maximum PCE of 2.07%.52 They revealed that increasing the ligand exchange time and the number of SSLE can further enhance the PCE to 3.06%, due to the limited coverage area and insufficient ligand exchange of TMAI with low concentration and poor solubility in methanol. Moreover, Konstantatos's group also reported that stoichiometry has a direct impact on the binding energy of surface ligands.49 1-octanethiol has a higher binding affinity with Bi-rich AgBiS2 nanocrystals synthesized at room temperature, compared to TMAI. Therefore, they introduced ethanethiol as the short-chain ligand to remove the insulating 1-octanethiol from the AgBiS2 nanocrystal surface, leading to an increase in the PCE from 2.10 to 5.55%.

On the other hand, organic ligands, e.g., 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) and 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) were also commonly used in the SSLE process. The Fermi levels of MPA-AgBiS2 (−4.79 eV) and TMAI-AgBiS2 (−4.71 eV) are equivalent, while the valence and conduction bands can form the type-II heterojunction, resulting in the favorable energy level alignment for efficient carrier transport. Accordingly, Choi et al. employed TMAI-AgBiS2 and MPA-AgBiS2 to form the cascade energy alignment, which can improve the PCE of solar cells from 4.74% to 5.59%.53 The introduction of the MPA-AgBiS2 layer can enhance the open circuit voltage (Voc) to 0.50 V, which may be mainly attributed to the improved carrier extraction and the reduced charge recombination. Similarly, Lee et al. employed organic (2-ME) and inorganic (TMAI) ligands to jointly passivate the nanocrystal surfaces as shown in Fig. 4b, which can increase the S/Ag ratios in AgBiS2 films and alleviate the energy level mismatch between the AgBiS2 active layer and poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophene-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b’]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T-2F), therefore substantially enhancing the PCE from 3.33 to 7.1%.34 The 2-ME-AgBiS2 nanocrystals can form the cascade energy level structure, which can efficiently extract holes and reduce charge recombination compared to the iodide-capped AgBiS2 nanocrystals with carrier accumulation and recombination at the interface of PBDB-T-2F and AgBiS2 nanocrystals (Fig. 4c). As shown in Fig. 4d, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) values for the 2-ME-treated AgBiS2 nanocrystals were slightly enhanced within the range of 400–700 nm, while the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) exhibited a significant improvement in the range of 400–900 nm, indicating the efficient charge transport from active layers to hole transport layers (HTLs). However, the excessive 2-ME ligands may further reduce the conductivity of nanocrystal films and the corresponding photovoltaic performance. In addition, the SSLE process requires at least three to ten depositions of AgBiS2 films, leading to increased defects in the active layer, and probably resulting in the capture of carriers and charge carrier recombination in AgBiS2 solar cells.
3.2 Solution-phase ligand exchange
The SPLE process is based on two insoluble solvent phases, and long-chain organic ligand-coated AgBiS2 nanocrystals are readily soluble in non-polar solvents. N-Methyl formamide, formamide, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and DMSO with higher dielectric constants can work as the polar phase and dissolve short-chain ligands for the passivation of AgBiS2 nanocrystals. Kim's group combined AgI and BiI3 with methylammonium iodide (MAI) to form halogenated metalates as halide ligands and increase the solubility in the polar solvent, DMF.54 Despite this benefit, there were still substantial MA3Bi2I9 left after ligand exchange, resulting in the reduced Jsc (Fig. 5a and b). Moreover, MA+ was essential to induce phase separation and contribute to the colloidal stability of AgBiS2 nanocrystals. The corresponding PCE of AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells was improved to 4.08% by employing EDT-AgBiS2 as the interface layer (Fig. 5c). Nevertheless, the existing challenge was the high cost of MAI, which may compromise the commercial applications of AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells. Greytak et al. also achieved effective ligand exchange with the use of low-cost ammonium iodide ligand solutions.55 The phase transfer process was significantly accelerated by trans-4-(trifluoromethyl)cinnamic acid (4-CF3) from more than an hour to less than 5 seconds. The protons in the 4-CF3 additive can facilitate the shedding of oleic acid ligands and the surface passivation with iodide ligands.

Additionally, Konstantatos et al. employed the organic ligand 3-MPA and halide ligand to perform the SPLE process, which can enable a high PCE of 7.3%.56 Strikingly, the ligand exchange process employed the environmentally friendly solvents methanol (MeOH) and octane to significantly lower environmental toxicity, and AgBiS2 nanocrystals dispersed well in aqueous solution with a small amount of butylamine (Fig. 5d and e). Accordingly, the all-green solar cells can be developed by processing the organic interface layer with toluene solvent, revealing great potential in the commercial applications of solar cells. In addition, a hybrid strategy with organic and inorganic ligands can further improve the surface passivation of AgBiS2 nanocrystals in the SSLE process and may be one of the promising directions for the SPLE process.
4. Device structure
Over the past few years, the PCE of AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells rapidly increased from 6.31% in 2016 to 9.17% in 2022.30,37 AgBiS2 was generally employed in ultrathin solar cells due to its high absorption coefficient of ∼106 cm−1. However, the trap-assisted charge recombination and short charge transport distance in the AgBiS2 active layer will block the further progress of device performance.57 Abundant research efforts have been devoted to enhancing the charge transport in the active layer based on the improved understanding of synthesis and the surface passivation of nanocrystals and the corresponding photovoltaic performance.58 Halpert et al. employed NiO as the hole transport material with p–i–n structure, as shown in Fig. 6a and b, demonstrating the prolonged decay dynamics and efficient charge transport from AgBiS2 nanocrystals to NiO films. The EQE curves are plotted in Fig. 6c, from which we can observe that the developed device presented higher values up to 80% in 400–600 nm, indicating the suppression of trap-assisted recombination in AgBiS2 solar cells. The developed p–i–n devices can deliver the substantially improved Jsc by ∼4 mA cm−2 and the PCE of 4.25%, approaching the device performance with the n–i–p structure.59 Additionally, Segawa et al. employed ZnO nanowires and AgBiS2 nanocrystals to fabricate an efficient carrier pathway to prolong the short carrier diffusion length, and the maximum EQE in the visible region can approach ∼82%.60,61 As illustrated in Fig. 6d, electrons can be efficiently extracted by ZnO nanowires. They found that annealing ZnO nanowires at 500 °C and in an oxygen atmosphere (500-O2) can further reduce the electron traps of oxygen vacancies and the interstitial defect for scattering sites of zinc, which can enhance carrier transport efficiency (Fig. 6e and f). Moreover, Konstantatos et al. used thermal annealing to further promote the cation site exchange in the traditional n–i–p structure and achieve the transition from cation segregation to the homogeneous cation disorder of AgBiS2 nanocrystals, resulting in the record PCE of 9.17% (Fig. 6g and h).30,62,63 The absorption coefficient of AgBiS2 nanocrystals in the spectrum range of 400 to 1000 nm can reach 5–10 times than that of other QD materials after annealing due to the increase of refractive index and transition dipole matrix and the reduction of Urbach band trailing, leading to the ultrathin active layer in AgBiS2 solar cells. Moreover, homogeneous cation disorder and shorter Ag–S bonds can reduce the octahedral distortion and trap density of AgBiS2 nanocrystals, which will increase the crystallinity and the efficiency of charge extraction to achieve higher EQE values (Fig. 6i). From the above discussions, we can determine that there remains much room to further enhance the device performance, such as introducing NiO or ZnO nanowires as hole transport materials for high-performance AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells.

5. Photovoltaic stability
Cost and stability are the two critical factors limiting the commercial applications of AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells. Many factors will lead to the performance degradation, e.g., short carrier lifetime, electron-hole recombination, and unstable materials. Segawa et al. employed ZnO nanowires (NWs) as the ETL to efficiently extract the electrons, which can prolong the carrier lifetime and reduce charge recombination, resulting in better air-storage stability for ∼200 days without any device encapsulation (Fig. 7a–c).60

Halpert et al. introduced the p–i–n device structure with NiO HTL and PCBM/BCP ETL to develop AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells, which presented poor stability under an ambient atmosphere (relative humidity of ∼80%). The developed photovoltaic devices can only remain ∼17% of the original PCE after 30 days of storage.59 On the contrary, the previous reports revealed that AgBiS2 films immersed in water for several seconds had a slight impact on solar cell performance.64 It was generally established that organic materials contributed a lot to the rapid degradation of device performance. Inorganic solar cells with thin NiO layers and p–i–n device structures have also been developed to advance large-scale applications. As shown in Fig. 7d–f, Choi's investigation revealed that all-inorganic AgBiS2 solar cells demonstrated excellent stability under ambient, heat, and water conditions, compared to the traditional inverted devices.53 Moreover, the manufacturing cost of NiO film is only 1/10000 of that of Poly [[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7), revealing the great commercial application potential. The developed AgBiS2 solar cells can enable the record PCE of ∼5.59% for p–i–n structures. Based on the improved stability, further enhancing the surface passivation of nanocrystals may result in superior device performance.
The selection of various organic HTLs or electron transport layers is critical for charge transport from AgBiS2 films to the electrode.65–67 In the field of PbS QDs, many research efforts have been focused on the development of efficient organic HTLs, which may also be applicable for AgBiS2 nanocrystals.68–71 Konstantatos's group investigated the impact of different organic interface layers on the device performance.37 The EQE curves of the devices with the best-performing PTB7 HTL showed that the polymer with thiophene rings facilitates the charge transfer from AgBiS2 and enhances the corresponding charge collection. Moreover, poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) can enable improved film morphology, which can reduce the current leakage and interface carrier recombination, resulting in a longer carrier lifetime. For the maximum power point (MPP) testing, the PCE of the solar cell with PTB7 HTL quickly declined below 2% within 20 minutes. However, the PTAA solar cell maintained 85% of its original performance after 10 hours, demonstrating the greater operational stability to advance the commercial applications (Fig. 7g). Similarly, Yana Vaynzof et al. found that the devices with PTAA/C60F48 had better air-storage stability of 24 h, compared to that based on PTB7/MoO3 layers.72 During the first hours of the air-storage test, the device performance presented a slight increase, as depicted in Fig. 7g, which was also observed in PbS solar cells.73,74 Stability is one of the critical factors in commercial applications, and various methods e.g., enhancing surface passivation, finding stable organic HTL and optimizing device structure can improve the device stability of AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells. Compared with PbS solar cells, the AgBiS2 active layer can be annealed at 150 °C, showing great potential in high-temperature resistance. Finally, we further provided a summary of the performance of AgBiS2 solar cells with different synthesis methods, ligand exchange strategies, and device structures (Table 1).

6. Summary and outlook
Eco-friendly nanocrystal solar cells have achieved a PCE of over 9%, with great potential in commercial applications. In this review, we presented a detailed discussion on the synthesis, ligand exchange, device structure, and stability of AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells and offered the remaining challenges and our insights to further advance the development of eco-friendly solar cells based on AgBiS2 nanocrystals. We firstly discussed the synthesis process of AgBiS2 nanocrystals, revealing the impact of the stoichiometric ratio and size distribution on the performance of AgBiS2 solar cells. Subsequently, we reviewed the ligand exchange strategies and highlighted the promising solution-phase ligand exchange in advancing the large-scale applications of AgBiS2 solar cells. Thereafter, we focused on the existing device structure and presented an in-depth discussion on the photovoltaic stability of AgBiS2 solar cells to balance the performance and stability of AgBiS2 solar cells. Nonetheless, there are still some challenges for AgBiS2 solar cells, e.g., nanocrystal quality, trap-assisted recombination, tedious processing, and moderate hole transport. With regard to these challenges, this review further offers our insights into future research directions (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  The future development directions for eco-friendly nanocrystal solar cells in terms of synthesis, ligand exchange, device structure, and photovoltaic stability. 
(1) Room-temperature synthesis
Over the past few years, few research efforts have been devoted to the room temperature synthesis of AgBiS2 nanocrystals, and the corresponding solar cells can achieve PCEs of over 5%, indicating their great potential for high-performance and low-cost photovoltaics. Seeking out air-stable and low-cost alternative materials to replace HMS and mental precursors may be promising directions for the development of room-temperature synthesis. Konstantatos et al. successfully synthesized AgBiS2 nanocrystals with sulfur powder and amine at room temperature, and the corresponding solar cell achieved a PCE of 5.55%.49 This work may offer some insights into designing facile and room-temperature AgBiS2 nanocrystals for high-performance photovoltaic devices.
(2) Solution-phase ligand exchange
The tedious layer-by-layer deposition of AgBiS2 films substantially increases the processing cost and steps, which placed great restrictions on commercial applications. Seeking out alternative one-step processing methods for commercial manufacturing is highly desirable. Konstantatos et al. introduced 3-MPA as the ligand for the surface passivation of AgBiS2 nanocrystals via the SPLE process and achieved a high PCE of 7.3%.56 Optimizing surface ligand passivation, e.g., introducing inorganic–organic mixed ligands, may further reduce the trap-assisted recombination of the active layer to improve device performance. Additionally, introducing environmentally friendly candidates to substitute the toxic solvents e.g., DMSO and DMF in the SPLE process is another critical challenge.
(3) Water-resistant eco-friendly nanocrystals
The stability of water and oxygen limits the development of various solar cells, and it is essential to make up this market gap of solar cells that even can be used on rainy days. Choi et al. reported that few-second water treatment of AgBiS2 films had little impact on photovoltaic performance, which may be mainly attributed to the higher binding energy of iodine atoms with AgBiS2 nanocrystals during water treatment, compared to PbS counterparts.64 This work demonstrated that AgBiS2 nanocrystals have great potential in developing water-resistant photovoltaic devices for wearable electronics, which may be a promising direction for future commercial applications.
(4) Efficient organic hole transport materials
Organic hole transport materials (HTMs) play a critical role in carrier extraction and stability for AgBiS2 solar cells. Nevertheless, few research efforts have focused on the systematic investigation of organic photovoltaic materials in AgBiS2 solar cells. More attention should be paid to the development of new organic HTMs instead of the commonly used materials, e.g., PTB7 and PTAA.75–77 Additionally, several strategies of organic photovoltaics may also exhibit great application potential in the development of AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells, such as introducing bulk heterojunctions to form complementary absorption,78–82 incorporating insulating polymers to enhance the flexibility and the thermal stability of quantum dot/polymer solar cells83–85 and developing the facile organic semiconductors to regulate film aggregation and stability.86–90
(5) Large-area AgBiS2 nanocrystal devices
The layer-by-layer deposition with three to ten exchange steps increases the defects in ultrathin AgBiS2 films and hinders the use of traditional printing methods (blade/bar/slot-die-coating etc.). The development of SPLE methods is thought to be a feasible strategy for achieving large-area AgBiS2 nanocrystal devices. Konstantatos et al. developed the promising AgBiS2 nanocrystals via the SPLE process and the nanocrystals can be dissolved well in distilled water or a water/butyl-amine mixture to form AgBiS2 inks, which can be employed in one-step deposition techniques.56 Moreover, developing one-step synthesis methods to directly obtain nanocrystal inks with short ligands is another critical direction for the development of large-area devices in the future.91,92
