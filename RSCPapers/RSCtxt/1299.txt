    , Accepted 15th April 2017First published on 19th April 2017AbstractThe effects of partial replacement of Cu with Ag in a Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS) thin film on its structural, optical, electrostructural, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties were investigated, in order to improve its performance for PEC water reduction under sunlight illumination. Results from X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed the successful partial replacement of Cu with Ag to form solid-solutions with different Ag/(Ag + Cu) ratios (A(x)CIGS, x = Ag/(Ag + Cu) = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4), as confirmed by a gradual change in the (112) reflections to smaller 2θ angles with increasing Ag/(Ag + Cu) ratio. Analyses of the photoabsorption properties of the materials using photoacoustic spectroscopy indicated changes in the band gap energies associated with increasing the Ag/(Ag + Cu) ratio. In addition, valence band maximum potentials of A(x)CIGS were deepened gradually with increasing Ag/(Ag + Cu) ratio. After modifying these A(x)CIGS films with a CdS ultrathin (ca. 70 nm) layer and a Pt catalyst, the PEC water reduction properties were evaluated in an electrolyte solution with the pH adjusted to 6.5, under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) radiation. Compared to the CdS- and Pt-modified Ag-free A(x)CIGS (A(0)CIGS) films, appreciable enhancements in the PEC properties were observed for electrodes based on A(x)CIGS (x > 0) films, and the best PEC performance was obtained for the electrode based on the A(0.2)CIGS film. However, the electrode derived from the A(x)CIGS film with Ag/(Ag + Cu) ratios higher than 0.3 showed diminished PEC properties due to the partial conversion of its semiconducting properties from p-type to n-type.
Introduction
The utilization of solar energy for consumable energy is considered to be one of the backbones for realizing a sustainable society. Solar energy can be directly converted into electricity by using solar cells, or into other types of storable energy as fuel for future use. Producing hydrogen (H2) is one of the best ways to store energy, because of its high energy density and clean waste product of H2O. The conventional way to utilize abundant solar energy for H2 production is through the use of a photovoltaic system to supply the required voltage for electrolysis of water into H2 to O2.1 Although this approach seems quite straightforward, it requires several series connections in solar cells, leading to a significant increase in the production cost of H2. On the other hand, H2 production based on photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has emerged as a potential means for achieving low-cost production of H2 when a stable and abundant material can be provided.2 Therefore, various materials and strategies have been employed to produce H2 using PEC water splitting,3–8 since the pioneering work by Fujishima and Honda on photoinduced water splitting using an n-type TiO2 electrode.9 Materials that are currently used for PEC water splitting basically consist of photoabsorber semiconductors decorated with a hydrogen evolution catalyst or an oxygen evolution catalyst to drive the overall water splitting reaction. The former is used as a photocathode for water reduction into H2 and the latter is used as a photoanode for water oxidation. Since the thermodynamically required potential to split water is 1.23 eV (or 1.7 eV when a required overpotential is considered), a single electrode system or a tandem system composed of a series connection between a photocathode and a photoanode is used to supply the necessary voltage to drive the reaction, using only sunlight as an input without applying an external bias. As a single electrode system, a photocathode based on GaInP2 coupled with a GaAs p–n junction cell was designed by Turner et al.10 Upon combination with a Pt counter electrode (anode), non-biased water splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) of 16% was achieved, though instability under the conditions of continuous operation of PEC water splitting is an inherent problem for the electrode. Moreover, fabrication of such III–V semiconductor materials is relatively expensive, because of the requirement of a sophisticated fabrication process in a high-vacuum environment. It is clear that for PEC water splitting using this single electrode approach, one of the main constraints is the necessity of a cathode with a high photovoltage.
Compared to the above-mentioned single electrode system, the tandem PEC system is advantageous because the necessary voltage can be provided through the combination of photovoltages between the photocathode and photoanode, so that one can complement the other. Among various candidates for use in tandem PEC systems, Cu-based p-type semiconductors with the general formula of Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 and a chalcopyrite crystal structure are promising materials for use as photocathodes, since their conduction band maximum (CBM) energies are largely negative toward the water reduction potential. Furthermore, their band gaps can be tuned from 1.0 to 2.5 eV, which should be beneficial for obtaining a high photovoltage. In addition, these compounds work well as photoabsorber in photovoltaics, and have shown a maximum efficiency of over 22%.11 Due to these versatile features, there have been many studies on the application of these materials with various compositions as photocathodes for PEC water splitting. Our group reported the application of CuInS2 modified with an indium sulfide layer and a Pt catalyst, and the photocathode was found to exhibit a high photocurrent density at 0 V vs. RHE (18 mA cm−2).6,12 Kumagai et al. reported a larger photocurrent density of more than 25 mA cm−2 by using a solar-cell-quality Cu(In,Ga)Se2 film modified with a cadmium sulfide (CdS) layer and a Pt catalyst.13 Recently, we reported the advantages of using Pt- and CdS-modified Cu(In,Ga)S2 photocathodes containing various amounts of Ga (Ga/(Ga + In) of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.4).14 Compared to the Ga-free CuInS2-based photocathode, photocathodes based on Cu(In,Ga)S2 with a Ga/(Ga + In) ratio of up to 0.25 were found to show improvements in both the photocurrent (at 0 V vs. RHE) and photovoltage (i.e., positive shift of onset potential). However, a further increase in Ga in the Cu(In,Ga)S2 film (Ga/(Ga + In) ratio of 0.4) was found to be detrimental, probably due to the effects on certain qualities of the Cu(In,Ga)S2 film, such as grain size and compactness. Therefore, in order to drive the photoreduction of water in a more positive onset potential region, another approach is required.
The effects of the partial or complete replacement of the Cu component in Cu-based chalcopyrite films with Ag have been studied extensively in photovoltaic and PEC fields. For a photovoltaic system, Ag-replaced Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (Ag(In,Ga)Se2) was studied as a wide-gap photoabsorber for application to a tandem solar cell. Solid solutions of AgGaSe2 and CuGaSe2 ((Ag,Cu)GaSe2) were also reported to improve the onset potential for PEC water reduction.15,16 These studies motivated us to partially replace Cu with Ag in our reported Cu(In,Ga)S2 photocathode, in order to achieve a more positive photocurrent onset for PEC water reduction. In this study, therefore, we fabricated (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)S2 (Ga/(Ga + In) = 0.25) thin films with various Ag/(Ag + Cu) ratios. The structural, optical, and electrical characteristics of these films in relation to their PEC water reduction properties are discussed herein.
Experimental
Fabrication of (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)S2 thin films
Precursor films were deposited on Mo-coated glass substrates by spraying 2 cm3 of aqueous solutions containing 0.09 mol dm−3 mixtures of Cu(NO3)2 and AgNO3 with various Ag/(Ag + Cu) ratios, 0.075 mol dm−3 In(NO3)3, 0.025 mol dm−3 Ga(NO3)3 and 0.8 mol dm−3 thiourea (SC(NH2)2), heated at 380 °C. The spray rate was fixed at 0.8 cm3 min−1 by using a home-made spray deposition apparatus. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas during the deposition. The as-obtained films were annealed in an evacuated borosilicate glass ampoule (ca. 7 cm3) containing 5 mg elemental sulfur powder at 600 °C for 20 min. An Ag-free CIGS film was also prepared using the same procedure. The as-prepared samples were designated A(x)CIGS, where x denotes the Ag/(Ag + Cu) ratio.
Deposition of CdS layers
The as-obtained A(x)CIGS films were coated with CdS using a chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique. In a typical procedure, the films were immersed in an aqueous solution containing 12.5 mmol dm−3 CdSO4, 0.22 mol dm−3 SC(NH2)2, and 11 mol dm−3 NH4OH at 60 °C for 6 min. The deposition procedure resulted in the formation of ca. 70 nm-thick CdS layers.
Photoelectrodeposition of Pt
Deposition of Pt particles on CdS-coated A(x)CIGS (x = 0–30) (or CdS/A(x)CIGS) films was performed using a PEC technique with a conventional three-electrode setup consisting of the CdS/A(x)CIGS film as a working electrode, a Pt wire as a counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. A 0.1 mol dm−3 Na2SO4 solution containing 1 mmol dm−3 H2PtCl6 was used as a deposition bath. The applied potential for the deposition was adjusted to −0.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) by using a Solartron SI1280B electrochemical measurement unit. During the deposition, the CdS/A(x)CIGS working electrode was illuminated using simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation from an Asahi Spectra HAL320 solar simulator. The duration of the deposition was fixed at 10 min.
PEC measurements
The three-electrode setup used for the Pt deposition was employed for the PEC measurements of fabricated Pt-deposited CdS/A(x)CIGS (Pt–CdS/A(x)CIGS) films. A sulfate-phosphate solution consisting of 0.5 mol dm−3 Na2SO4 and 0.1 mol dm−3 phosphate buffer (i.e., a mixture of 0.1 mol dm−3 Na2HPO4 and 0.1 mol dm−3 NaH2PO4) with a pH of 6.5 was used as the electrolyte. Measurements were conducted using a linear sweep voltammetric mode with a negative scan direction at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, under chopped illumination using the above-mentioned solar simulator at a frequency of 10 Hz. Potentials referred to the Ag/AgCl electrode were converted into those for the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.199(1)
Half-cell solar-to-hydrogen (HC-STH) efficiencies were extracted from the current density-potential response of the photocathodes by using the following equation: HC-STH (%) = J × (V − VH+/H2) × 100/P(2)where J is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), V is the applied potential (V vs. RHE), VH+/H2 is the equilibrium redox potential of hydrogen (0 V vs. RHE), and P is the intensity of the simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2).
Characterizations
The crystal structures of the films were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku Mini Flex X-ray diffractometer (CuKα, Ni filter). The morphologies of the films were examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on a Hitachi S-5000 FEG scanning electron microscope. The optical absorption properties of the A(x)CIGS films were studied using a gas-microphone photoacoustic (PA) technique. Details of the PA technique have been described previously by one of the authors (Q. S.).17,18 In this study, PA spectra were obtained in an energy range of 1.5–1.9 nm with a modulation frequency of 33 Hz at room temperature. The PA spectra were normalized using the PA spectrum from a carbon black sheet. Ionization potentials of the A(x)CIGS films were analyzed using photoelectron (PE) spectroscopy on a Riken Keiki AC-3 surface analyzer. Resistivity measurements were carried out at room temperature using a Toyo Technica ResiTest 8300 Hall-Resistivity measurement system. For the measurements, A(x)CIGS films were deposited on a borosilicate glass substrate (without the conductive Mo layer) by using the same process as that described.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the A(x)CIGS films containing varying Ag content. The diffraction pattern of A(0)CIGS (i.e., Ag-free film) shows the formation of a crystalline CIGS film as indicated by the relatively intense peaks at 28.4°, 47.0° and 55.8°, assignable to the (112), (220)/(204) and (312)/(116) crystal planes of chalcopyrite CuInS2 (JCPDS 27-0159), respectively. However, the observed peaks are slightly shifted to higher angle regions due to the partial replacement of In with Ga as reported previously (Fig. 1a).14 The fact that there is no other reflections aside from the reflections derived from the Mo substrate and its sulfide (MoS2) indicates the absence of any impurity components. The MoS2 compound was formed by partial sulfurization of the Mo substrate. Compared to the XRD pattern of A(0)CIGS, all of the peaks of the Ag-containing A(x)CIGS films are shifted to lower angle regions, as is typically shown for their (112) reflections. The degree of shifting is dependent on the Ag content. Such observed shifts are reasonable, since the ionic radius of Ag+ (1.29 Å) is larger than that of Cu+ (0.91 Å). The Raman spectra of the films also show a shift of the A1-mode frequency to higher values with increasing Ag content (Fig. S1, ESI†).19–21 These results indicate the successful formation of a solid-solution (i.e., (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)S2) via the replacement of Cu atoms with Ag, instead of the formation of separate phases. It should be noted that the weak broad bands appearing at ca. 360–370 cm−1 in the Raman spectra of all the samples correspond to the E- and B2-modes of Ga-containing chalcopyrite compounds.19–21 The successful inclusion of Ag atoms into the chalcopyrite crystal was also confirmed by EDX analyses (Table S1, ESI†).

Fig. 2 shows the morphologies of the A(x)CIGS films observed using SEM. All of the films show well-grown grains of several hundred nm in size, as expected from the above XRD results. Although there was no appreciable difference in compactness, grain sizes were clearly different among the films, i.e., grain sizes of the Ag-containing A(x)CIGS films were larger than those of the A(0)CIGS film. A(x)CIGS films with relatively high Ag content ratios (A(0.2)CIGS and A(0.3)CIGS) had large grains, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. Such a trend was also observed for the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 system, in which the presence of Ag enhanced grain growth of the film.15,22

Fig. 3 shows optical absorption spectra of the A(x)CIGS films obtained using a PA technique. From the shoulder points of these spectra, determined as intersections between baseline components and fitting lines for the analyses of the Urbach energies (see below), the band gap energies (Eg) of A(0)CIGS, A(0.1)CIGS, A(0.2)CIGS and A(0.3)CIGS were assumed to be 1.67 eV, 1.68 eV, 1.75 eV and 1.76 eV, respectively. Since the Eg values of CuInS2 (1.50 eV) and CuGaS2 (2.43 eV) are known to be widened by the replacement of Cu with Ag (1.87 eV for AgInS2 and 2.65 eV for AgGaS2, respectively),23,24 the observed slight shifts of Eg in the present A(x)CIGS system can be considered as evidence for the successful formation of (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)S2 mixed crystals.

Energy values in the spectra denote band gap energies of these samples estimated from intersections between baselines (dotted lines) and fitting lines given by eqn (3) (solid lines). 
After deposition of an n-type CdS layer and Pt co-catalyst onto the A(x)CIGS films, their H2 evolution properties were evaluated. Fig. 4 shows typical J–V curves of the Pt–CdS/A(x)CIGS photocathodes with various Ag content, measured in the sulfate-phosphate solution (pH 6.5) and swept in the cathodic direction under chopped illumination from AM 1.5G irradiation. The J values at 0 V vs. RHE and the onset potentials, which are defined as potentials showing 0.1 mA cm−2 of J, are summarized in Table 1. It is apparent that cathodic photocurrents due to water reduction were observed from all of the samples upon illumination. The samples also showed a negligible dark current, indicating no side reactions due to the reduction of the samples, in agreement with our previous studies.6,14 The photocurrents (at 0 V vs. RHE) observed for the photocathodes based on the A(0.1)CIGS and A(0.3)CIGS films were increased compared to those observed for the A(0)CIGS-based photocathode. However, the photocathode based on the A(0.3)CIGS film showed a significant drop in its photocurrent. The same trend was observed for the change in the photocurrent onset potential: onset potentials for the photocathodes based on A(0.1)CIGS and A(0.2)CIGS were shifted to relatively positive regions when compared to that obtained for the A(0)CIGS-based photocathode. However, the Ag-replacement started to be detrimental when the x value reached higher than 0.3. Hence, the maximum HC-STH of 1.8% (at 0.4 V vs. RHE) was obtained for the Pt–CdS/A(0.2)CIGS photocathode, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

Scans were performed in cathodic directions at 10 mV s−1.

Based on the above-discussed SEM results (see Fig. 2), the A(x)CIGS films are composed of relatively large grains compared to those in the Ag-free A(0)CIGS film. Since frequent charge recombination should occur at grain boundaries, it is reasonable to assume that an efficient charge transport can be achieved when photocathodes composed of A(x)CIGS films are used. The relatively large currents and positive photocurrent onset potentials observed for the Pt–CdS/A(0.1)CIGS and Pt–CdS/A(0.2)CIGS photocathodes are attributable to such a structural advantage. However, this explanation cannot apply to the results for the Pt–CdS/A(0.3)CIGS photocathode: the photocathode showed an appreciable drop in its photocurrent and a negative shift in the photocurrent onset potential. These results suggest that grain sizes in the A(x)CIGS film are not the sole contributing factor towards their performance as H2-producing photocathodes.
In order to find other properties affecting the performance of the A(x)CIGS-based photocathodes, we examined electron energy levels of the CBM and valence band maximum (VBM) in the A(x)CIGS samples. For this purpose, PE spectroscopy was used to determine the VBM energy positions of these samples. Fig. 5 shows the as-obtained plots of photoelectron yields to the 0.33rd power (yield0.33) versus photon energy.14,15 All of the PE spectra show monotonous increases in yield0.33 as a function of photon energy. It is known that for a semiconductor sample, the yield0.33-photon energy plot gives a linear function. Onset energies corresponding to VBM energies were estimated by the extrapolation of linearly increasing parts of these plots to baseline values of yield0.33, as given by the dotted lines in these plots. As a result, a gradual increase in onset energy with increasing Ag content of the A(x)CIGS sample was observed. Since the valence band of A(x)CIGS is mainly composed of Cu3d and Ag4d orbitals, and since the electron energy level of the Cu3d orbital is shallower than that of Ag4d,25 the observed deepening of the VBM by Ag-replacement is a reasonable change. Indeed, such a trend has also been observed in the (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)Se215 and (Ag,Cu)GaS226 systems.

Combining the VBM energy levels estimated using PE spectroscopy and the Eg values (estimated from the above PA technique), the CBM energy positions of the A(x)CIGS films were determined. The as-obtained relative energies of the VBM and CBM are illustrated in Fig. 6. For comparison, the VBM and CBM energies of CdS are also shown in this figure.14 Despite the gradual deepening of the VBM energy positions induced by an increase in the content of Ag in the A(x)CIGS films, the CBM energy positions were not changed significantly by Ag-replacement. Hence, we can focus on the influence of the change in the VBM energy position on photocathode performance. In our previous report on a CdS/CIGS system, we postulated that the interface band gap of CdS/CIGS (Egint), defined as the energy difference between the VBM of A(x)CIGS and the CBM of CdS, is one of the factors determining the performance of a photocathode.14 In this study, the A(x)CIGS-CdS heterointerface consisting of a larger Egint was more advantageous for obtaining a more positive photocurrent onset. In principle, this should contribute to a more positive onset potential of the photocathodes based on A(0.1)CIGS and A(0.2)CIGS, compared to that based on A(0)CIGS. However, the observed onset potential was relatively low for the A(0.3)CIGS film despite having the most favorable band alignment with CdS.

To further inspect the electrical properties of the A(x)CIGS films, the photocurrent responses of the A(x)CIGS films (without any surface modification) were examined in an aqueous 0.5 M Na2SO3 solution under anodically biased conditions. In this system, we can observe n-type behavior of the photoelectrode used, since the SO32− ion works as a hole scavenger. As shown in Fig. 7, A(x)CIGS (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2) films showed no photoresponse under these conditions, while the A(0.3)CIGS film showed an appreciable anodic photocurrent that rose toward anodic polarization. Several studies have shown that Ag-based chalcopyrite films, such as AgInS2 and AgGaSe2, usually behave as n-type semiconductors.27–29 Hence, it is likely that conversion from p-type to n-type partially occurs when Ag/(Ag + Cu) is higher than 0.3. The fact that significantly high resistivity was obtained for the A(0.3)CIGS film compared to those obtained for the A(x)CIGS (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2) films (Table S2, ESI†) supports such a postulation, because of the occurrence of majority carrier compensation between the p-type and n-type parts in the A(0.3)CIGS film.

To find other factors that contribute to the photocathode properties of the A(x)CIGS films, we again examined the PA spectra of the A(x)CIGS films, as shown in Fig. 3. All of the plots of logarithmic PA intensities versus photon energies show linearity below the PA shoulder points, i.e., the absorption coefficients of these samples in these regions follow an exponential trend. The slope of the exponential tail corresponds to the absorption tail known as the Urbach tail, which reflects the crystal quality of the semiconductor material, such as disorder, defects, and impurities. It is usually expressed quantitatively by the Urbach energy, Eu, by fitting the following equation: α = α0exp[(hν − hν0)/Eu],(3)where h is Plank's constant and α0 and ν0 are material parameters. As a result, Eu values for A(0)CIGS, A(0.1)CIGS, A(0.2)CIGS and A(0.3)CIGS were determined to be 66 meV, 82 meV, 152 meV and 162 meV, respectively. Assuming that Eu values reflect the level of disorder and/or crystalline defects in these compounds, the width of the exponential tail increases when the density of defects increases. Hence, the relatively large Eu values obtained for the A(0.2)CIGS and A(0.3)CIGS samples suggest that there are larger amounts of defect states in these samples than those in A(0)CIGS and A(0.1)CIGS. This is another reason behind the low photocurrent and photocurrent onset potential of the A(0.3)CIGS-based photocathode. Moreover, since structural failure is included in the A(0.2)CIGS sample, which showed the best performance for water reduction in the present study (see above), there should be room for further improvements of the photocurrent and onset potential. The photostability of the present photocathode (Fig. S3, ESI†) could also be improved by applying a protective layer such as TiO2, as has been successfully demonstrated for numerous photocathode materials.30
Conclusions
In this study, we fabricated A(x)CIGS films with Ag/(Ag + Cu) ratios of 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3, via spray pyrolysis followed by annealing in sulfur vapor. Structural characterizations revealed that grain sizes of A(x)CIGS were increased with an increase in the amount of Ag included. PES measurements of the films showed that the Ag-replacement induced deepening of the VBM energy position, resulting in an increase of Egint. As expected from the results, the PEC water splitting activity of photocathodes based on these films, evaluated after modification with a CdS layer and Pt, was appreciably enhanced when A(x)CIGS films with x values of up to 0.2 were used. Due to several detrimental changes in film quality for the A(30)CIGS film, such as partial inversion of the semiconductor properties from p-type to n-type, enhancement of the resistivity, and an increase in defect states, significant drops in the photocurrent and the photocurrent onset potential were observed. Hence, suppression of such electrical and structural conversions for A(x)CIGS films with x values larger than 0.3 is required to approach a practical level.
