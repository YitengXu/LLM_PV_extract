    , Accepted 30th June 2018First published on 2nd July 2018AbstractDeveloping photocatalysts with efficient spatial charge separation and transfer as well as a high light-harvesting ability remains a key challenge. Here, we report a facile in situ process to decorate ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets (NSs) with a co-catalyst, Cu2MoS4, for photocatalytic water splitting. The as-obtained Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4 exhibits a superior photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 2170.5 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation, which is nearly 677 and 34 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 NSs, respectively, and far exceeds that of most g-C3N4 catalysts modified with other sulphide co-catalysts reported in the literature, demonstrating that Cu2MoS4 can serve as a promising non-noble metal co-catalyst to couple with g-C3N4 for highly efficient photocatalysts. Structural characterization confirms the well-defined morphology of Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4 in which Cu2MoS4 hollow spheres are uniformly attached on the ultrathin g-C3N4 NSs with numerous micropores and vacancies. The optical properties indicate that Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4 possesses a superb visible light absorption ability. The photoluminescence spectra, photocurrent response, and electrochemical impedance spectra combine to prove the highly efficient separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes. All these factors synergistically enhance the photocatalytic activity of Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4 for photocatalytic water splitting, providing new insights into the rational design of high-performance visible light-driven photocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to tackle global environmental and energy issues. Since Fujishima reported their pioneering work on photoelectrochemical splitting of water on TiO2 electrodes in 1972,1 numerous research studies focusing on the development of efficient photocatalysts have been carried out,2–7 among which graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), as a non-metal n-type semiconductor, has gained considerable attention for photocatalytic applications due to its unique features and superior properties.8–13 In detail, g-C3N4 is a semiconductor with a narrow band gap (2.7 eV), resulting in its ability for visible light absorption.14,15 Besides, the high thermal and chemical stability of g-C3N4 makes it a robust material under various conditions.16 Furthermore, due to the polymeric feature of g-C3N4, its surface chemistry properties can be easily tuned by means of surface engineering at the molecular level.11 Therefore, all of these features combine to make g-C3N4 a promising metal-free catalyst for high-efficiency photocatalytic water splitting. However, practical applications are still limited by several shortcomings of bare g-C3N4. For instance, pure g-C3N4 suffers from a high recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers and a low specific surface area with inefficient light absorption, resulting in poor visible light-driven photocatalytic performance.17
To cope with these challenges, many modifications of g-C3N4 have been conducted in terms of synthesis methods, electronic structure modulation, and nanostructure design.11 Besides, efforts have also been devoted to enhancing the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4via co-catalyst deposition,18,19 doping,20,21 and coupling with other semiconductors.22–25 Among various modification routes, loading co-catalysts is considered to be an effective approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 by promoting spatially efficient separation of charge carriers, providing effective active sites and suppressing surface back reactions.26 To date, noble metals such as Pt, Au and Pd have been mostly used as co-catalysts, which are normally expensive and rare.27–29 Therefore, there is a growing interest in developing novel, inexpensive and earth-abundant co-catalysts to further improve the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4.
Recently, layered transition metal sulphides (TMSs) such as MoS2 and WS2 have been widely investigated as co-catalysts,30–34 among which MoS2 has gained the most attention due to its unique physicochemical properties.35–39 More recently, it has been found that ternary transition metal sulphides (TTMSs) can provide more favorable redox reactions and better electronic conductivity compared with single component sulfides;40 thus TTMSs have been employed as novel promising photocatalysts for photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic applications.41–43 As a typical TTMS, Cu2MoS4 shows good visible light absorption with a narrow bandgap of 1.71 eV.44 Moreover, Cu2MoS4 is a semiconductor which is known for its advantages of being environmentally-friendly, earth-abundant and low-priced.45,46 Therefore, Cu2MoS4 is generally used as a photocatalyst or combined with other semiconductors to construct heterostructures (HSs).47–49 Recently, several articles reported that Cu2MoS4 was used as a co-catalyst to couple with other photocatalysts,40,50 indicating that Cu2MoS4 may be an ideal co-catalyst to couple with other semiconductors for more efficient photocatalysts.
In the present work, as a highly efficient co-catalyst, Cu2MoS4 was successfully grown in situ on exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets (NSs) via a facile hydrothermal route. In this process, bulk g-C3N4 is successfully exfoliated into NSs with abundant in-plane pores and vacancies, which endows g-C3N4 NSs with numerous active sites and diffusion channels, as well as extended visible light absorption. The loading of the Cu2MoS4 co-catalyst further expands the light absorption region and efficiently facilitates the charge separation, which dramatically accelerates the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, the hollow sphere structure of Cu2MoS4 provides the photocatalyst with unique properties such as a low density and a high light-harvesting efficiency. The as-prepared Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4 composites exhibit significantly improved photocatalytic performance compared to the bulk g-C3N4 (677-fold) and g-C3N4 NSs (34-fold) for photocatalytic H2 generation under visible light irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on g-C3N4 NSs modified with Cu2MoS4 hollow spheres as a co-catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthetic procedures

2.1.1 Synthesis of bulk g-C3N4. 
Bulk g-C3N4 (BCN) was obtained through a calcination procedure by using dicyandiamide (DCDA) as the precursor. Typically, 5 g of DCDA was placed in a covered ceramic crucible and then calcined at 550 °C in air for 4 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the obtained g-C3N4 was ground into powder.


2.1.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4 NSs. 
The g-C3N4 NSs (CNs) were synthesized as reported previously with minor modifications.51 In detail, 0.8 g of BCN was heated at 650 °C for 2 h under an Ar gas flow of 50 mL min−1 at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The obtained powder was then calcined at 500 °C in air for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. After naturally cooling to room temperature, CN was obtained. The yield of the exfoliated g-C3N4 compared to bulk g-C3N4 was 15.3%.


2.1.3 Synthesis of Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4. 
Four Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4 photocatalysts with different ratios were prepared. Typically, a certain amount of CN (280, 240, 200, 160 mg) was added to 25 mL of deionized water and ultrasonicated for 1 h to form a well-dispersed suspension. Then 15 mg of Cu2O powder, which was prepared as reported previously,52 was added to the above suspension followed by ultrasonication for 5 min. Subsequently, 40 mg of (NH4)2MoS4 was dissolved in the suspension by stirring for 5 min. The obtained mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 160 °C for 9 h. Finally, the precipitate was washed with deionized water and ethanol several times and then dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight, resulting in Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4 photocatalysts with four different ratios. The theoretical weight percentages of the loaded Cu2MoS4 for the four Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4 photocatalysts were calculated to be 11.6%, 13.3%, 15.5%, and 18.7%, respectively, denoted as Cu2MoS4/CN-1, Cu2MoS4/CN-2, Cu2MoS4/CN-3 and Cu2MoS4/CN-4 for convenience. For comparison, pure Cu2MoS4 was also prepared under the same experimental conditions without the addition of CN. The preparation process of Cu2MoS4/CN is illustrated in Scheme S1.†


2.1.4 Synthesis of Cu2MoS4/bulk g-C3N4. 
Cu2MoS4/bulk g-C3N4 (Cu2MoS4/BCN) was synthesized by the same procedure as for Cu2MoS4/CN-2, with the CN replaced by BCN.


2.1.5 Synthesis of CuS/g-C3N4 NSs and MoS2/g-C3N4 NSs. 
The synthesis procedures of CuS/g-C3N4 NSs (CuS/CN) and MoS2/g-C3N4 NSs (MoS2/CN) are provided in the ESI.†

2.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained with a Bruker D2 PHASER using Cu/Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using FEI Quanta 250 equipment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM2100 TEM. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained using a Quantachrome instrument at liquid N2 temperature. The specific area was determined from the linear portion of the BET plot. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB spectrometer with aluminum Kα radiation. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was conducted using a V-670 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on an FLS980 spectrometer at room temperature using a 350 nm excitation wavelength.
2.3 Photocatalytic measurements
The photocatalytic water splitting reaction was carried out in a top-irradiation quartz cell connected to a closed glass gas circulation system (CEL-SPH2N, Beijing). In a photocatalytic reaction, 10 mg of sample was dispersed in 20 ml of an aqueous solution containing 10% triethanolamine as a sacrificial agent. The suspension was thoroughly evacuated and then irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter. The temperature of the reaction solution was kept at 6 °C using a flow of cooling water during the photocatalytic reaction. The H2 evolved was analyzed with an on-line TCD gas chromatograph (GC-9720, nitrogen carrier).
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photocurrent, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and flat-band potential (Efb) measurements were carried out respectively using an electrochemical station (Autolab PGSTAT 302N) and an electrochemical analyzer (CHI 660E) in a standard three-electrode quartz cell. The working electrode was prepared as follows: 5 mg of sample was suspended in 0.5 mL of deionized water with 0.05 mL of 5 wt% Nafion D-520 dispersion, and then the mixture was dispersed by ultrasonication and spread onto an FTO glass. After being dried naturally, the FTO glass was heated at 120 °C for 1 h to evaporate the solvent. For the photocurrent and EIS measurements, the prepared thin film acted as the working electrode, using a platinum plate as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm filter was used as the light source for the photocurrent measurement. The flat-band potentials (Efb) of the samples were obtained from Mott–Schottky plots which were obtained at a frequency of 10 kHz. The prepared thin film acted as the working electrode, using a platinum plate as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte under dark conditions. The measurement and calculation of the apparent quantum yield (AQY) are depicted in detail in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure characterization

Fig. 1 shows the SEM, TEM, and HRTEM images of BCN, CN, Cu2MoS4, and Cu2MoS4/CN-2. As shown in Fig. 1A, the as-prepared BCN accumulates as irregular thick agglomerates with a micron-size, whereas the CN (Fig. 1B) exhibits ultrathin NSs with numerous micropores generated during the calcination process. The unique morphology of CN could provide more edge sites and greater exposure to the reactant, thus enhancing the charge mobility and reducing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Fig. 1C displays the SEM, TEM, and HRTEM images of the pure Cu2MoS4 hollow spheres. It can be obviously seen that Cu2MoS4 exhibits a uniform structure of hollow spheres with a diameter of about 100 nm and a thickness of around 20 nm. The inset HRTEM image of Cu2MoS4 clearly shows the crystal lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.51 nm, which corresponds to the (001) face of Cu2MoS4.50Fig. 1D–F display the TEM images of Cu2MoS4/CN-2 at different scales, showing that the Cu2MoS4 hollow spheres are uniformly deposited on the surface of CN. Similarly, the HRTEM image in the inset in Fig. 1F shows a lattice distance of 0.51 nm assigned to the (001) face of Cu2MoS4. It should be noted that an intimate interfacial contact between Cu2MoS4 hollow spheres and CN resulting from the in situ synthesis procedure can be observed in the TEM images of Cu2MoS4/CN-2, which could efficiently facilitate the separation and migration of photo-induced charge carriers during the photocatalytic process. To further illustrate the unique morphology of Cu2MoS4/CN, SEM was conducted on Cu2MoS4/BCN for comparison. As shown in Fig. S1,† a large number of separated Cu2MoS4 nanoparticles with a 100 nm diameter are deposited on the surface of the micron-sized bulk g-C3N4. Cu2MoS4/BCN exhibits a thick bulk morphology, which could result in a longer charge transport distance and a higher possibility of electron–hole recombination.

XRD was carried out to investigate the phase structure of the prepared CN and Cu2MoS4/CN. As shown in Fig. 2, the CN sample exhibits two distinct diffraction peaks at 13.0° and 27.4°, indexed to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C3N4, corresponding to the in-planar structural packing motif and the interplanar stacking of aromatic systems, respectively.53,54 For the Cu2MoS4 sample, diffraction peaks corresponding to I-phase Cu2MoS4 can be observed, indicating that phase-pure Cu2MoS4 was successfully synthesized. Diffraction peaks corresponding to Cu2MoS4 and CN are observed in the XRD patterns of the Cu2MoS4/CN samples, and the diffraction peaks correlated with Cu2MoS4 get stronger with increasing Cu2MoS4/CN ratio.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of CN, Cu2MoS4/CN, and Cu2MoS4 samples. 
XPS was further carried out to investigate the chemical composition and elemental valence state of the as-prepared samples. As exhibited in Fig. 3A, six peaks appeared in the XPS survey spectrum of Cu2MoS4/CN-2, and these can be assigned to C 1s, N 1s, Cu 2p, Mo 3d, S 2s and O 1s, respectively (the O 1s signal may come from absorbed CO2 and H2O on the surface of the sample).55Fig. 3B shows a comparison of the high-resolution spectra of C 1s in BCN and Cu2MoS4/CN-2 samples. The C 1s spectrum can be resolved into two peaks centered at 288.4 eV and 284.8 eV, which are respectively attributed to the C–C bonds derived from the graphitic carbon in the carbon nitride matrix and the NC–N bonds in the s-triazine rings.56,57 The C–C bonds can be identified as originating from pure graphitic carbon presumably formed during minor decomposition of the carbon nitride sample under X-ray irradiation or due to carbon-containing contaminants.58,59 It can be clearly observed from the comparison that the peak area ratio of C–C to NC–N increases in the Cu2MoS4/CN-2 sample, indicating the loss of some carbon atoms in the s-triazine rings during the calcination process. The carbon vacancies could enhance the electrical conductivity and the mobility of photogenerated charge carriers,60 thus resulting in a highly efficient photocatalytic performance. Fig. 3C displays the XPS spectra of N 1s in BCN and Cu2MoS4/CN-2 samples, which shows three similar peaks centered at 400.8, 399.7 and 398.8 eV ascribed to amino groups (C–N–H), tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3 groups and the sp2-bonded N (C–NC), respectively.55,61Fig. 3D shows the XPS spectrum of Cu 2p with two peaks located at 952.4 and 932.6 eV, which can be attributed to the Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 levels.54 From Fig. 3E, the Mo6+ 3d3/2 and Mo6+ 3d5/2 levels at 233.0 and 229.8 eV can be observed, respectively, while another peak at 226.2 eV can be assigned to the S 2s level.62 Besides, the other two peaks centered at 232.1 and 228.8 eV correspond to the Mo4+ 3d3/2 and Mo4+ 3d5/2 levels,63 respectively, indicating the minor existence of Mo4+ states. Fig. 3F shows that the XPS spectrum of S 2s consists of two peaks at 163.0 eV and 161.8 eV, which can be respectively assigned to the S 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 levels.54

To determine the surface area of the as-synthesized samples, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured over the samples. Fig. S2A and B† show the isotherm curves of BCN, CN, and Cu2MoS4/CN-2 samples, together with the corresponding pore size distribution. The specific surface areas of the samples are shown in Table S1.† The CN sample exhibits the largest specific surface area (SBET) (273.6 m2 g−1), which is over 43 times higher than that of BCN (6.2 m2 g−1). Meanwhile, the total pore volume of CN (3.05 cm3 g−1) is around 24 times higher than that of BCN (0.12 cm3 g−1). The dramatic increase in the surface area and total pore volume can be ascribed to the large number of in-plane micropores as well as the ultrathin NS structure formed during the two-step calcination process. Furthermore, the CN sample shows a pore size distribution between 1–5 nm, which is consistent with the TEM observation (Fig. 1). The SBET (228.2 m2 g−1) and pore volume (2.38 cm3 g−1) of the Cu2MoS4/CN-2 sample are both slightly lower than those of the CN sample, which can be attributed to the fact that some of the g-C3N4 NSs agglomerated and restacked with each other during the hydrothermal and drying procedures.
3.2 Optical absorption properties
To investigate the optical properties of the as-obtained samples, UV-vis DRS was conducted, and the corresponding band gaps of the BCN and CN samples were further determined by fitting the optical transition at the absorption edges using the Tauc/David–Mott model.64 As presented in Fig. 4A, an absorption edge at up to 460 nm can be found in the BCN sample, corresponding to its calculated band gap (Eg) value of 2.74 eV (the inset in Fig. 4A). After the calcination treatment, the absorption of CN considerably improved in the visible light region, while the band gap increased to 2.88 eV owing to the quantum confinement effect, which makes the valence band edge and conduction band edge shift away from each other.65 Notably, CN exhibited an additional absorption tail starting at 430 nm to around 600 nm, which is associated with more opportunities for n → π* transitions resulting from some different band energy inside the band gap structure that was generated during the calcination processes.66 This indicates that CN possesses a much higher visible light-harvesting ability than BCN, which can be attributed to the synthetic effects of the large exposed edge surface, abundant defect sites and numerous introduced micropores of CN. The inset in Fig. 4A displays the digital photos of BCN and CN samples with the same weight of 50 mg. The obvious difference in volume between the two samples indicates that the volume of the sample has significantly increased due to the exfoliation of CN NSs from BCN. Additionally, the color of g-C3N4 changed from light yellow to darker yellow after the calcination process, which can be attributed to the fact that the partially crystalline g-C3N4 was transformed into amorphous g-C3N4 due to the heat treatment in an inert atmosphere of Ar.67Fig. 4B depicts the UV-vis DRS of the CN, Cu2MoS4/CN, and Cu2MoS4 samples. Cu2MoS4 displays a nearly flat UV-vis absorption spectrum, which means that it may exhibit more metallic properties than semiconductor characteristics.47 Excitingly, the Cu2MoS4/CN samples show remarkably extended optical absorption in comparison with CN, and the composites display stronger optical absorption with increasing Cu2MoS4 content, indicating that the coupling of Cu2MoS4 and CN could effectively improve the visible light absorption of g-C3N4 so as to promote the photocatalytic activity of the composites. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the superior light absorption ability of the Cu2MoS4/CN samples could also be attributed to the unique hollow spherical morphology of Cu2MoS4, which allows multiple light reflections and scattering in the inner cavity, thus enhancing the utilization efficiency of the light source. As shown in the inset in Fig. 4B, the Cu2MoS4 sample exhibits a black color, while Cu2MoS4/CN-2 displays a reddish-brown color, in agreement with their optical absorption properties.

The inset shows the digital photos of the CN, Cu2MoS4, and Cu2MoS4/CN-2 samples. 
3.3 Photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production
To investigate the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared photocatalysts, the BCN, CN, Cu2MoS4, Cu2MoS4/BCN and Cu2MoS4/CN samples were irradiated without any other co-catalyst (e.g. Pt, Ru, Pd) under visible light (>420 nm) (Fig. 5A) and full-spectrum light (320–780 nm) (Fig. 5B), respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, BCN exhibits negligible photocatalytic activity under visible light, while CN displays a much improved photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 60 μmol h−1 g−1 owing to its structural advantages. The ultrathin nanosheets with a large specific surface area provide shorter pathways for the charge carriers to migrate from the material to the active sites.68 Meanwhile, these in-plane micropores can promote the charge transfer across the nanosheets during the photocatalytic reaction.69 Pure Cu2MoS4 presents a poor photocatalytic performance. However, once Cu2MoS4 was deposited on CN, outstanding photocatalytic H2 evolution rates were achieved over the Cu2MoS4/CN samples with the best H2 evolution rate of 2170.5 μmol h−1 g−1 (Cu2MoS4/CN-2), which is nearly 677 and 34 times higher than that of BCN and CN, respectively. This remarkable increase can be attributed to the co-catalytic role of Cu2MoS4, which effectively accelerates the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and inhibits their recombination. Besides, the unique hollow spherical structure of Cu2MoS4 could also be a critical factor in the photocatalytic performance due to its high light-harvesting property. It can be found that Cu2MoS4/CN-3 and Cu2MoS4/CN-4 samples with stronger visible light absorption display a lower photocatalytic activity than Cu2MoS4/CN-2. This can be ascribed to the excess Cu2MoS4 covering the surface of CN, which obstructs the incident light and therefore limits the generation of electrons from CN.40 For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of the Cu2MoS4/BCN sample was also measured. The photocatalytic performance of Cu2MoS4/BCN shows an obvious enhancement compared with BCN, but it is still far from that of Cu2MoS4/CN, indicating the synthetic effects of both Cu2MoS4 and CN components. Fig. 5B shows the photocatalytic activities of these samples under full-spectrum irradiation. The H2 evolution rates of the samples all far exceed those of the samples tested under visible light due to the greater energy intensity. Moreover, the Cu2MoS4/CN samples display more dramatically enhanced photocatalytic activities compared with the pure CN; for example, the Cu2MoS4/CN-2 sample exhibits the highest H2 evolution rate of 9247.2 μmol h−1 g−1, which is nearly 58 times higher than that of CN (160 μmol h−1 g−1), strongly confirming the excellent photocatalytic performance of the Cu2MoS4/CN samples. Notably, the photocatalytic performance of Cu2MoS4/CN is superior to that of several reported photocatalysts, such as CuInS2/g-C3N4, WS2/g-C3N4, Ag2S/g-C3N4, and CuS/g-C3N4, where the sulfides act as co-catalysts for g-C3N4,70–73 powerfully demonstrating the high efficiency of Cu2MoS4 as a co-catalyst. Moreover, the photocatalytic performance of Cu2MoS4/CN exceeds that of the majority of noble metal-free co-catalyst modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts in a reported work (Table S2†),71,74–82 indicating the advantage of the Cu2MoS4/CN heterostructure.

To further verify the superiority of TTMS Cu2MoS4 performing as a co-catalyst, we also prepared the single component sulfides (CuS and MoS2) and synthesized CuS/CN and MoS2/CN samples with 13% CuS and 13% MoS2 as co-catalysts, respectively. The detailed synthesis procedure is shown in the ESI.† The photocatalytic results shown in Fig. 5C demonstrate that both CuS/CN and MoS2/CN display a slightly improved photocatalytic activity compared with the pure CN, which is far below the photocatalytic activity of Cu2MoS4/CN. As shown in Fig. S3,† the Cu2MoS4/CN-2 sample displays the highest photocurrent intensity and the smallest arc radius, suggesting that Cu2MoS4/CN-2 has the most efficient interfacial charge migration and separation process. This indicates that TTMS Cu2MoS4 possesses better electronic conductivity compared with single component sulfides and thus could perform as a superior co-catalyst in photocatalytic applications. To evaluate the stability and durability of Cu2MoS4/CN photocatalysts, we performed photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments for four cycles. As shown in Fig. 5D, no obvious hydrogen evolution rate decrease was observed within the four cycles in 16 h, powerfully proving the good stability of Cu2MoS4/CN-2, which is obviously superior to other metal sulphide co-catalysts, WS2, for instance, as serious photocorrosion on a WS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst was proved in an early work.54 This result reveals that Cu2MoS4 is a promising candidate as a non-noble metal co-catalyst to couple with g-C3N4 NSs because of its high resistance to photocorrosion. To further verify the stability of this catalyst, comparison between the structures of fresh and recycled Cu2MoS4/CN-2 samples was carried out by the XRD characterization method. The XRD pattern (Fig. S4†) showed that no apparent change was found for the recycled sample, confirming that the structure of the catalyst could be maintained after the photocatalytic reaction.
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) over Cu2MoS4/CN-2 was calculated with different band-pass filters (band-pass filters at 400, 450, 475, 500 and 550 nm, ±10 nm). As shown in Fig. 6, the highest quantum efficiency of 0.41% was obtained at 400 nm, and the quantum efficiency decreased with increasing irradiation wavelength, which corresponds to the optical absorption of Cu2MoS4/CN-2. This indicates that the main driving force behind the photocatalytic reactions lies in the harvested photons that induce electrons and holes to participate in the surface redox reactions. Besides, the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies (STH) under visible light and full-spectrum light illumination were respectively evaluated by using a 300 W Xenon arc lamp with or without a 420 nm cutoff filter as the light source (25.8 and 70.0 mW cm−2, respectively) with a CNMS-2 sample as the catalyst (10 mg catalyst in 20 mL deionized water). The STH of CNMS-2 was determined to be 0.20% and 0.31% under visible light and full-spectrum light illumination, respectively, according to a reported method (the detailed calculation process is provided in the ESI†).83 The above results strongly indicate the high efficiency of the Cu2MoS4/CN-2 sample and the superior activity of Cu2MoS4 as a co-catalyst.

3.4 Photoluminescence spectroscopy
To investigate the recombination behavior of photogenerated charge carriers, PL spectra measurement was carried out on the BCN, CN, and Cu2MoS4/CN-2 samples at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. As shown in Fig. 7A, BCN exhibits the highest PL intensity due to the quick recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. A weaker PL intensity was observed in the presence of CN, indicating a reduced recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. This can be attributed to the unique structure of the ultrathin g-C3N4 NSs with numerous micropores and vacancies, which provide shorter pathways for charge migration and therefore noticeably enhance the charge separation. Moreover, the Cu2MoS4/CN-2 sample displays the lowest PL intensity, suggesting a much lower charge recombination. The remarkably reduced PL intensity reveals that the deposition of the Cu2MoS4 co-catalyst could realize a highly efficient charge transfer between the interfaces of Cu2MoS4 and g-C3N4 NSs, thus leading to a high photocatalytic activity.

3.5 Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To further understand the charge excitation and migration behaviors, transient photocurrent and EIS measurements were carried out on the BCN, CN and Cu2MoS4/CN-2 samples. As shown in Fig. 7B, CN exhibits an enhanced photocurrent response compared with BCN, demonstrating more efficient separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers. This can be attributed to the presence of carbon vacancies, the high specific surface area, and the stronger visible light absorption of CN. The Cu2MoS4/CN-2 sample displays a remarkable increase in photocurrent intensity, which mainly originates from the broadened absorption spectrum region resulting from the deposition of Cu2MoS4 and the accelerated charge separation and migration rate facilitated by the formation of a surface heterostructure between Cu2MoS4 and CN. Fig. 7C exhibits the EIS results for the BCN, CN and Cu2MoS4/CN-2 samples, in which a smaller arc radius is related to a lower electron transfer resistance. The arc radius of the samples turns out to be in the order BCN > CN > Cu2MoS4/CN-2, suggesting that Cu2MoS4/CN-2 has the most efficient interfacial charge migration process. Therefore, the results of PL, photocurrent response and EIS measurements combine to demonstrate that Cu2MoS4 can serve as a highly active co-catalyst for g-C3N4 NSs by promoting charge separation and migration, which could be considered as the critical factors for photocatalytic reactions.
3.6 Photocatalytic mechanism of Cu2MoS4/CN composites
To better illustrate the photocatalytic mechanism of Cu2MoS4/CN composites, a Mott–Schottky experiment was conducted to evaluate the band positions of the as-prepared catalysts to estimate the flat band potential (Efb). As presented in Fig. S5,† the Mott–Schottky plots showed positive slopes, demonstrating that CN and Cu2MoS4 possess n-type semiconducting properties with Efb values of about −1.59 and −0.27 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The Efb for n-type semiconductors can be approximately regarded as the conduction band (CB); therefore, the CB edge potentials of CN and Cu2MoS4 were evaluated to be −1.39 and −0.07 V vs. NHE, respectively.84,85 Moreover, the band gap (Eg) values of CN and Cu2MoS4 were estimated by fitting the optical transition at the absorption edges using the Tauc/David–Mott model. Fig. 4A and S6† imply that the band gaps of CN and Cu2MoS4 were 2.88 and 1.61 eV vs. NHE, respectively. Thus, the valence band (VB) positions of CN and Cu2MoS4 were calculated to be 1.49 and 1.54 V vs. NHE, respectively.
On the basis of the experimental results, a possible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of Cu2MoS4/CN is shown in Scheme 1. Upon visible light irradiation, electrons and holes are generated in the CB and VB of CN,86 respectively. The ultrathin NS morphology of CN allows photogenerated charge carriers to migrate from the inner part to the surface for a shorter distance, while the in-plane micropores and vacancies of CN provide sufficient diffusion channels that greatly speed up the charge transfer. Subsequently, the excited electrons can easily transfer to the Cu2MoS4 hollow spheres because the CB potential of Cu2MoS4 (−0.07 V) is much more positive than that of g-C3N4 (−1.39 V), which provides a great driving force for the migration of photogenerated electrons. Meanwhile, it is found that the VB potential of Cu2MoS4 (1.54 V) is quite close to that of g-C3N4 (1.49 V), suggesting that the holes can hardly transfer from Cu2MoS4 to CN. As a result, the electrons accumulated in Cu2MoS4 would reduce H+ to H2, while the holes left in the CN and Cu2MoS4 are trapped by the sacrificial agent (TEOA), leading to the efficient spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. The similar VB potentials of Cu2MoS4 and g-C3N4, coupled with the fact that Cu2MoS4 demonstrates poor photocatalytic activity but exhibits great attraction to electrons on CN owing to the large gap between the CBs of the two semiconductors, make it rational to consider Cu2MoS4 as an efficient co-catalyst for CN. Therefore, the superior photocatalytic activity of Cu2MoS4/CN can be mainly attributed to the formation of a surface heterostructure between Cu2MoS4 and CN, which provides a strong driving force for the migration of photogenerated electrons in the composites. Apart from this, the UV-vis DRS displays the light-harvesting property of the Cu2MoS4/CN composites, which ensures more photo-generated electrons participating in the photocatalytic reactions. To conclude, the efficient charge separation and migration, coupled with their high light-harvesting ability, synergistically endow the Cu2MoS4/CN composites with extraordinary photocatalytic performance for the H2 evolution reaction.

4. Conclusions
In summary, Cu2MoS4 hollow spheres were successfully grown in situ on ultrathin g-C3N4 NSs as an excellent co-catalyst. The as-prepared Cu2MoS4/CN-2 sample exhibits a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 2170.5 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation, which is nearly 677 and 34 times higher than that of BCN and CN, respectively. The highest quantum efficiency of 11.6% was obtained at 400 nm for the Cu2MoS4/CN-2 composites. The superb photocatalytic performance benefits from not only the structural advantages of the ultrathin g-C3N4 NSs with abundant micropores and carbon vacancies, which provide shorter pathways for charge migration, but also the co-catalytic role of Cu2MoS4, which realizes the efficient separation of electrons and holes, and its high light-harvesting ability, contributing to the excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. It is envisioned that this work will provide new insights into the rational design of hybrid nanocomposites based on earth-abundant elements for photocatalytic applications.
