The ACQ phenomenon in small organic molecules and polymers is detrimental to the performance of OLEDs. Efficient pure white electroluminescent polymers, obtained by the copolymerization of 9,9-dihexylfluorene as a blue host with (E)-2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-yl-2-cyano-3-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl) acrylate (FCP) as a yellow emitting covalent dopant with AIEE properties on the main chain of the copolymers, have been designed and synthesized. White light emission was achieved in copolymer FCP 2.5, which contained 2.5% of the AIEE luminogen. Interestingly the copolymers exhibited an enhanced emission upon aggregation even at low compositions of FCP. The enhanced emission in the copolymers is attributed to the supramolecular assembly of the polymeric chains. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) investigations of the monomer and copolymers of FCP revealed the presence of an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition between dimethylamine and the cyanoacrylic acid unit. OLEDs were fabricated using a device with a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/EML/Al structure. White light emitting diodes were fabricated from FCP 2.5 as the emissive layer (EML) and elicited a white electroluminescence with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate values of (0.33, 0.34). They exhibited a maximum brightness of nearly 9332 cd m−2, a power efficiency of 4.13 lm W−1 and a luminous efficiency of 6.34 cd A−1. Interestingly, the supramolecular ordering in FCP 2.5 considerably reduces the charge trapping which results in a reproducible white light emission.
Introduction
Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) present a hitherto different possibility of lighting architecture signifying a departure from conventional point source lighting. Owing to their high energy efficiency and robustness they are coveted as potential candidates for general lighting in the near future. OLEDs differ from conventional lighting sources by the fact that the injected charge carriers are converted into excitons that in turn lead to light emission.1–7 White light emission through the simple device architecture of OLEDs has been of seminal importance to researchers.8 A myriad of strategies have been devised by researchers for an efficient white light emission from polymer based devices. The proposed strategies include multilayer architectures with blends of different emitting polymers, multilayer phosphorescent emitters, single layer polymer blends and polymer hosts with fluorescent or phosphorescent small molecule dopant systems.9–13 Apart from the above conventional approaches, a few innovative schemes, like supramolecular hydrogen bonding14 and excited state intra molecular proton transfer, have also been reported.15 However the above systems suffered from an intrinsic phase separation problem during long-term device function, variable mobilities of charge carriers with resultant alterations of the recombination zone due to a complicated fabrication resulting in voltage-dependent electroluminescence (EL).16
A single polymer white EL is highly desirable since it has advantages such as phase stability and cost effective upscaling of OLED fabrication.17–19 Tailoring stable and efficient organic light emitting materials with various optoelectronic properties is paramount for achieving a breakthrough. In a white light emitting polymer the chromophores can either be attached to the main chain or the side chain.20,21 Copolymer based can also be classified as those based on primary colour mixing or complimentary colour mixing.22 After the first white light emitting polymer was reported, some innovative strategies were developed for such materials aimed at enhanced device performance, including the incorporation of triplet emitting metal complexes in the main chain as well as side chains of polymers.23–25 The majority of reported white light emitting systems exhibited a significant difference of electroluminescence (EL) from photoluminescence (PL) with a reduction in efficiency of OLEDs. The above undesired effect was largely attributed to charge trapping. Charge trapping also resulted in a superfluous energy cascade that could only be partially offset by a low composition of dopant units in the polymer chain. Nevertheless, researchers have highlighted the possibility of offsetting charge trapping by using bipolar emitters.26
The aggregation induced emission (AIE) phenomenon was recently introduced as an effective tool to offset the problem of ACQ.27 Aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) in organic luminogens caused reduced emissions in the solid state consequently limiting practical application in OLEDs.28,29 Ever since the initial discovery, AIE has continued to emerge as an important topic of research.30 Incorporation of AIE luminophores to the conjugated polymer backbone resulted in a twisted structure thereby transferring the AIE property to the polymer.31 AIE luminogens have found a myriad of applications like chemo/bio sensors, explosive detection, cell imaging and photo memory.32,33 Polymers with AIE moiety have also been used as the down conversion layer for white light emitting diodes and as the emissive layer for monochromatic polymeric LEDs.34 Supramolecular π-gel forming pyridinium salt has also been reported with the AIE property and white light emission albeit with temperature dependence.35 As a general criterion, AIE systems were tailored by the principle of restricted intramolecular rotation (RIR) to reduce π–π stacking interactions in the solid state.27 Some of the general structural components of AIE luminogens included tetraphenyl ethylene, polyphenyl ethylenes/cyano stilbene, polyphenyl thiophenes/siloles, triphenyl pyridines and other geometrically hindered systems.36 However, white light emission from polymers containing AIE luminogenic moieties is still seldom reported. In this report we demonstrate a simple and novel strategy for white light emission from a single copolymer of a yellow emitting AIE luminogen, (E)-2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-yl-2-cyano-3-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl) acrylate (FCP), and a blue host, 9,9-dihexyl-2,7-dibromofluorene (DHF), (Scheme 1). The electroluminescence of OLEDs was studied at varying compositions of the copolymers. Results from X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that the AIEE property of the copolymers is due to the formation of supramolecular J-aggregates under device conditions. An efficient white light emission is demonstrated in a single polymer, FCP 2.5 as the emissive layer in an OLED with a TO/PEDOT:PSS/EML/Al device configuration. To the best of our knowledge, the copolymer FCP 2.5 with AIEE properties represents a unique class of AIEE polymeric system with high purity white light emission and supramolecular assembly.

Results and discussion
Spectral properties of monomer and polymer
Spectral properties of the monomer and copolymers were studied in solution and in the thin film state (Fig. 1). The absorption spectrum of the FCP monomer in chloroform showed a strong absorption peak at 433 nm due to the charge transfer transition and a shoulder at 286 nm due to the π–π* transition. The copolymers elicited a change in wavelength of absorption with the various compositions of the FCP unit in the main chain of the copolymers.

In the solution state, the absorption peaks were observed at 374 and 380 nm for FCP 1 and FCP 2.5, which have a low composition of FCP units and can be assigned to the π–π* transition along the conjugated backbone. The π–π* transitions of FCP 5, FCP 10, FCP 25 and FCP 50 (with a higher FCP content in the main chain) were observed at 373, 380, 386 and 383 nm, respectively. The above polymers elicited a low energy shoulder observed around 432 nm that is characteristic of FCP units and was prominently observed due to its relatively higher composition in the backbone. In dilute solutions of FCP monomer intermolecular rotations are allowed due to the relatively low intramolecular rotation37 and as a result of an enhanced charge transfer (CT) between the electron rich N,N-dimethyl amine and electron deficient cyano segments.38 The thin film absorption profiles of the FCP monomer and of all the copolymers showed π–π* transitions very close to their corresponding solution values (Fig. 1(c)). The CT bands of the copolymers were observed at ∼443 nm, slightly red shifted by up to 12 nm relative to solution absorption. In the case of the monomer there was no observable change in the π–π* transitions. Nevertheless, the FCP monomer elicited an anomalous change of absorption in the long wavelength region. The thin film spectrum of the FCP monomer exhibited a new absorption peak at 370 nm with predominantly high intensity and the CT band was red shifted to 455 nm with significantly low intensity. The above observations can be interpreted as the appearance of a intramolecular twisted geometric form of FCP that elicited an absorption peak at 370 nm alongside the (CT) band that appeared at 455 nm.39 Similar observations were reported by researchers for systems with a hybrid localized charge transfer (HLCT).40
The normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the copolymers in solution and in the thin film state revealed some significant information on the mode of energy transfer within the copolymers. In FCP it includes two emitters: fluorene and the cyano stilbene derivative. The blue emission may originate from the fluorene in solution, and the yellow emission may be determined by the AIE-active cyano stilbene derivative in the aggregate. In the solution state, the FCP 50 and FCP 25 copolymers (higher compositions of the FCP unit) exhibited two characteristic emission peaks that correspond to the emission of poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene)-2,7-diyl (DHFP) centred at 416 and 413 nm.41 In addition to the above emission peaks, the FCP 50 and FCP 25 copolymers elicited emission peaks at 467 and 468 nm, respectively, that closely correspond to that of FCP units. The presence of emission peaks that correspond to FCP units in the case of FCP 50 and FCP 25 clearly indicate that there is a partial energy transfer from DHFP units to FCP units. Interestingly the FCP monomer exhibited a very low PL quantum yield of 0.01% in solution and a high quantum yield of 73.4% in the thin film that is very characteristic of an AIE system (Table 1).42 The observed low quantum yield in solutions of FCP 50 and FCP 25 (with values of 0.54% and 0.55%, respectively) despite the high quantum yield of DHFP (71.70% in solution) can be attributed only to the energy transfer to the FCP monomer that in turn elicited a very low quantum yield in the solution state. In this context, the above observation can be compared with the earlier reports that showed low quantum yields for systems with AIE properties in the solution state.42 Copolymers with low compositions of FCP monomer (FCP 10–FCP 1) showed a complete blue emission in the solution state and the emission peaks appear around 416 nm, which is similar to the emission of DHFP.

In the thin film the emission spectra of the copolymers was totally different from that of the solution state. The FCP 1 and FCP 2.5 copolymers showed a bathochromic shift (∼16 nm) from DHFP with emission at 456 nm. In addition to the above, FCP 1 and FCP 2.5 elicited an enhanced quantum yield of 67.3% and 71.5%, respectively (Table 1). It is also interesting to note that the emissions of FCP 1 and FCP 2.5 were extended to above 600 nm. From the above results it is clear that the change in emission properties of FCP 1 and FCP 2.5 is due to a partial energy transfer to FCP moieties. As a result of the high quantum yield of FCP units in thin films, pure white light emission was observed for FCP 2.5 while blue tinged and yellow tinged white light emission was observed for FCP 1 and FCP 5, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1(f)). The copolymers from FCP 10, FCP 25 and FCP 50 exhibited yellow emission at 526, 533, and 539 nm, respectively, with a considerable bathochromic shift and a high quantum yield compared to their respective solutions. The FCP monomer elicited a high quantum yield of 73.4% in the thin film and hence the enhanced quantum yield of all the copolymers in the thin film state is the direct consequence of an enhanced emission of FCP units. Thus the enhanced emission of the FCP monomer in the thin film state and low emission in the solution state is characteristic of a typical AIE system.
Solvatochromic study
Solvatochromism is a characteristic behaviour of dipolar molecules. In general, the different polarities of solvents provides a useful framework for studying solvent dependent spectral shifts. Using the Lippert–Mataga study the influence of different polarities of solvent environments on the photo physical properties of organic luminogens can be understood.43 The Lippert–Mataga study reveals the interactions between the solvent and dipole moment of the solute by using Stoke's shift as a function of orientational polarizability.
The spectral properties of the FCP monomer were studied as a function of orientational polarizability (f) by plotting Stoke's shift against (f). Since the orientational polarizability roughly corresponds to the amount of solvating power and interaction of the solvent with the solute, it can be used to study the photo-physical properties of luminogens. As an interesting observation, the absorption maxima of FCP in different solvents elicited a bathochromic shift of about 13 nm when the solvent was changed from toluene to acetonitrile (Fig. 2). The emission spectra of FCP also showed a uniform bathochromic shift with an increase in solvent polarity. A plot of Stoke's shift versus the orientational polarizability (f) exhibited a high positive slope of 2878 and a linear correlation coefficient (R) of 0.899. The above observation indicates that the transitions responsible for the yellow emission of FCP consists of a significant charge transfer (CT) characteristic and involves a high transition dipole moment. Thus the emission property of FCP is very sensitive to the microenvironment.

Dynamic light scattering and fluorescence decay of the excited state
The aggregation properties of the AIE luminophore incorporated copolymers were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments and fluorescence lifetime analysis (FLT).44,45 The size distributions of the aggregates in solution were studied. The copolymers exhibited significant changes in aggregation due to the varying composition of FCP monomer. Dynamic light scattering studies revealed a bimodal distribution of particle sizes for all copolymers except white light emitting copolymer FCP 2.5 (Table 2). The FCP 2.5 copolymer had a hydrodynamic radius of 566 nm with unimodal distribution. The above observation can be correlated indirectly with the spherical structures observed in the AFM and SEM analyses of the copolymers (Fig. 5). It can be clearly understood that the composition of FCP monomer is responsible for the intermolecular interactions.46 Previous studies have revealed that the aggregation characteristics in the solution state can be transferred onto films cast from the solution.47,53

The fluorescence decay of the copolymers was measured in solution and in the solid state to identify the effect of aggregation on the decay dynamics of the excited state. The time correlated fluorescence decay analysis revealed that the average lifetime of the excited states gradually increased (in solution and in the thin film state) with the composition of FCP units in the copolymers. Table 2 summarizes the fluorescence decay analysis in THF solution and solid films at room temperature. All the polymers elicited a bi-exponential fluorescence decay in the nanosecond range. Such bi-exponential decays are characteristic of polymers with a π–π* transition and an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state. The observed composition of short lived and delayed decay channels of the copolymers can be correlated to the amount of aggregated and non-aggregated states.47 The above correlation is possible since there is a more efficient energy transfer to FCP units in the aggregates than in solvated molecules.
In the solution state, polymers with a low percentage of FCP units showed a unique ultrafast decay channel which was very similar to that observed in DHFP, which used as a control for this study. The ultrafast decay channel with life time <1 ns can be correlated with the non-emissive states and also these ultrafast channels predominate in solutions of DHFP and copolymers FCP 1 to FCP 10.48 The ultrafast decay channel was not observed for copolymers FCP 25 and FCP 50. The FCP 25 and FF 50 copolymers elicited two decay channels in solution with longer average life times (Table 2 and Fig. 3). In thin films, DHFP, FCP 1 and FCP 2.5 exhibited bi-exponential fluorescence decays with an ultrafast decay channel, which is closely comparable with the solution. In contrast, the FCP 5 to FCP 50 copolymers elicited a bi-exponential decay with an increase in the average lifetime of the above decay channels with the composition of FCP units (Table 2 and Fig. 4(a) and (b)). The average lifetime of copolymers FCP 5 to FCP 50 increases compared to the solution life time and this signifies that the above observation can be attributed to the aggregation and enhanced emission in the solid state.

Aggregation induced emission enhancement properties
Incorporation of the cyanovinyl functionality into the structural design of multifunctional materials is a potential strategy to achieve efficient solid state lighting.49 AIEE properties of the FCP monomer and its copolymers were studied by adding a non-solvent into a solvent medium. In this experiment, water and THF were chosen as the solvent pairs to create different admixtures of varying compositions. The AIEE behaviour was examined by monitoring the changes in PL with the change in proportion of water in THF. The copolymers with major compositions of the FCP monomer, FCP 50 and FCP 25, elicited weak or no emissions when molecularly dissolved in a good solvent (THF). Interestingly, the FCP monomer and its copolymers FCP 50, FCP 25 and FCP 10 exhibited a high quantum yield upon aggregation in the presence of a higher percentage of water fraction (fw) in THF–water mixtures. In this experiment, the resultant mixture of THF–water with monomer and polymers were visually transparent and macroscopically identical, suggesting that the FCP monomer aggregates have nanometre sizes50 (Fig. 4(e)).

A closer observation of Fig. 4(a) showes an emission for the FCP monomer in 100% THF centring at 480 nm, with a low emission intensity observed. The maximum emission intensity was observed in 90% fw in THF, centred around 570 nm (Fig. 4(a)). The emission of aggregates in the FCP monomer revealed a bathochromic shift relative to that of the respective THF solution of ∼90 nm, which is possibly with the J-aggregate formation and restrictions of intra molecular rotation in the aggregate state.51 From the above observation it may be concluded that the FCP monomer possessed aggregation induced enhanced emission (AIEE) characteristics.
The DLS spectra of the FCP monomer (Fig. 4(f)) indicate a higher percentage of fw above 60% induced precipitation. The above inference is evidenced by the broadened absorption spectra and higher hydrodynamic radii for the FCP monomer in water–THF mixtures with fw > 60%.
The emission spectra of FCP 50 and FCP 25 showed interesting results of AIEE phenomena with a double emission. The addition of water to the THF solution resulted in an emission enhancement with a red shift relative to that of the THF solution indicating J-aggregate formation.52 A maximum emission intensity was observed in the cases of FCP 50 and FCP 25 at 90% water in THF. The corresponding results from the DLS measurement (Fig. S12(a) and (b) of the ESI†) show the hydrodynamic radii varying with increases in the percentage of fw in the THF–water mixtures. FCP 50 elicited two peaks appearing at 238 and 18 nm in THF solution, indicating the perturbation of π aggregates in 100% THF solution owing to the increased polarity and solvation.53 At fw 60%, the DLS result showed a broadened peak with a hydrodynamic radius value of 1000 nm. In case of polymer dispersions in 70 and 80% water the emission was slightly reduced and DLS showed one broadened peak at ∼1000 nm. Nevertheless, when the water composition was increased to 90%, the emission intensity reached a maximum for both FCP 50 and FCP 25 with corresponding DLS traces eliciting a broad peak around 1000 nm. This phenomenon should be attributed to the partial restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) in the aggregate state, which enhances the radiative process and simultaneously blocks the non-radiative decay of excited states.54 In contrast to the above observation, only a partial enhancement was observed for polymers with low compositions of FCP units and the same trends were observed with DLS. The time-dependant profile of the copolymers with aggregated states for FCP 50 and FCP 25 showed bi-exponential decay features with increased life time decay channels. Such lifetimes are characteristic and originate from π–π* transitions as well as the intramolecular charge transfer (Fig. 4(g) and (h)). Interestingly, the low percentage composition of FCP 2.5 showed the highest emission intensity at fw 10% in water–THF mixtures (Fig. 4(d)). This maximum intensity of fw 10% can be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of 9,9-dihexylfuorene moieties. While increasing the fw in water–THF mixtures, their emission was quenched remarkably up to fw 60%. Then the partial emission enhancement started at fw 70%, it was continued up to fw 90%. The above results are comparable with the reported polymeric AIEE system,64 in contrast to the white light emission from the thin film state where the solution state showed a blue emission for FC 2.5. The above emission effects can be attributed to the low percentage composition of the FCP monomer in the FCP 2.5 copolymer. This can be due to the lower emission in a polar medium and the partially enhanced emission which occurred with the addition of water.47
Thin film morphology and supramolecular assembly
The morphology of copolymers was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the results were correlated with the Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD) data. The copolymers were found to show variation in morphology with changes in percentage composition of the FCP monomeric units in the polymer backbone. It is to be noted that AFM and SEM analyses exhibited circular domains with two different size ranges that are clearly visible in the thin films of all copolymers (Fig. 5). It is interesting to note that the FCP 50 copolymer with the highest composition of FCP units in the main chain exhibited very prominent large numbers of smaller spherical assemblies in the AFM and SEM analyses.

It is clear from the morphological features that the composition of the FCP monomer units influenced the relative number of large and small spherical assemblies. FCP 50 showed a large number of circular assemblies with smaller sizes, while FCP 25 showed a slight change in morphology with a relatively lesser number of small circular assemblies. In the case of FCP 10, an ensemble of uniformly sized spherical assemblies was observed in spun thin films. In FCP 5 the uniformity in the size of assemblies were disturbed. In case of FCP 2.5 and FCP 1, even fewer circular assemblies with larger radii were visible, signifying a marked effect of FCP content in the main chain.
The XRD traces recorded on films deposited on ITO substrates were studied to decipher more details of the intermolecular interactions (Fig. 5(g)). The monomer FCP showed two prominent reflections at 5.97° and 12.01°, corresponding to spacings of 14.8 and 7.4 Å, respectively, which can be attributed to first and second order reflections. Another less prominent reflection was observed around 16.16°, corresponding to the spacing of 5.24 Å, indicating molecular level ordering.55 The reflection observed for the pure FCP monomer can be attributed to the crystallinity of the deposited film. XRD traces of copolymers with higher compositions of FCP units showed a very prominent reflection close to 5.90° 2θ. A similar broader reflection was observed in the case of FCP 50, FCP 25 and FCP 10. However FCP 10 elicited a very weak and broad reflection peak corresponding to 19.0° and is very close to the amorphous halo observed in the case of poly(9,9-dialkylfluorene). The reflection at 5.9° vanished and a new reflection peak corresponding to 7.1° 2θ (12.44 Å) was observed in case of FCP 5, which can be attributed to the β-phase observed in 9,9-dialkylfluorenes.56 However, the characteristic amorphous halo was not observed in case of FCP 5. FCP 2.5 showed a reflection corresponding to d spacing of 12.98 Å (6.8° 2θ), which is slightly higher than the characteristic β-phase of polyfluorenes. However the amorphous halo was observed in the case of the FCP 2.5 copolymer. Based on the above discussions, it is clear that the composition of copolymers can be correlated with the number of observable circular assemblies in the AFM analysis. Corresponding XRD traces showed a gradual decrease in the spacing of polymers compared to that of the FCP monomer. In copolymers with lower compositions of FCP units, the molecules became closer to give an assembly similar to that in the metastable β-phase. The characteristic metastable β-phase can be considered a cause for the enhanced quantum yield in thin films for all copolymers.57
It is probable that the composition of FCP units in the 9,9-dihexylfluorene backbone actuated a change in the radius of curvature of the polymer chain. It can be visualized that the alkyl chains and substituents form the core of the spherical micelles while the polyfluorene backbones form the shell.58 It has been previously observed that rod-coil type polyfluorenes showed the formation of hollow spherical micelles in THF solutions.59 An increase in FCP units in copolymers resulted in a decrease in the radius of curvature by reduced dihedral angle between the polyfluorene rings. A reduced composition of FCP units resulted in an increased dihedral angle between the polyfluorene rings that lead to a higher radius of curvature of the polymer chains and hence possibly larger spherical micelles. The red shifts that appeared in the aggregated state and solid films may be caused by the strong inter- and/or intra-molecular interactions, e.g. strong dipole–dipole interactions, between the pendants.
Electroluminescence characteristics and decreased charge trapping
LEDs were fabricated from monomer and copolymers with the ITO/PEDOT-PSS/EML/Al device configuration by the solution processing technique. The LED device characteristics were studied under different conditions. Interestingly the monomer and the copolymers exhibited bright electroluminescence and a low turn on voltage (Fig. 6(d) and (e) and Table S3 of the ESI†). The FCP monomer exhibited a bright yellow emission with CIE coordinates of (0.44, 0.49) with a turn on voltage of 4.3 V. The maximum brightness of the LED with FCP monomer as the emissive layer was observed to be 18746 cd m−2 at 13.5 V. The maximum current efficiency (ηCmax) and power efficiency (ηPmax) were found to be 11.91 cd A−1 and 5.77 lm W−1, respectively. The ambipolar charge carrier mobility of the FCP monomer obtained by space charge limited current (SCLC) method was found to be 2.11 × 10−6 S cm−2.60

The FCP monomer with bright yellow electroluminescence was copolymerized with 9,9-dihexylfluorene to get white light emissions of varying purity, as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The OLEDs fabricated from the copolymers of FCP and 9,9-dihexylfluorene elicited a broad emission due to Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).61 The copolymers, FCP 50, FCP 25 and FCP 10 exhibited a yellow emission in EL, with CIE coordinates of (0.38, 0.44), (0.36, 0.41) and (0.43, 0.42), respectively, in Fig. 6(b) and Fig. S3 (ESI†). Interestingly the PL CIE coordinates of copolymers FCP 50, FCP 25 and FCP 10 were found to be (0.37, 0.44), (0.37, 0.43) and (0.41, 0.38), respectively. Thus the CIE coordinates in EL and PL matched very closely for copolymers FCP 50, FCP 25, FCP 10 and FCP 5 that had relatively higher compositions of FCP units in the backbone. The current efficiencies for FCP 50, FCP 25, FCP 10 and FCP 5 were found to be 6.12, 4.79, 4.38 and 3.12 cd A−1, respectively. OLEDs with FCP 50, FCP 25, FCP 10 and FCP 5 as the emissive layer elicited a power efficiency of 4.83, 4.67, 3.98 and 5.93 lm W−1, respectively (Table S3 of the ESI†). Notably, the FCP 5 and FCP 1 copolymers exhibited EL CIE coordinates of (0.30, 0.38) and (0.30, 0.31), respectively. White EL with a better purity was observed for the OLED with FCP 2.5 exhibiting CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.34) with the obtained current efficiency and power efficiency values of 6.34 cd A−1 and 4.83 lm W−1, respectively. The maximum brightness of the white LED was found to be 9332 cd m−2 at 12 V. The good performance of OLEDs with FCP 2.5 as the emissive layer can be attributed to the energy transfer to FCP moieties in the main chain. The FCP units in the copolymers being AIE active resulted in efficient emission properties by dampening the aggregation caused quenching process in the polyfluorene chain. A deconvolution of the EL spectrum of FCP 2.5 is presented in Fig. 7. It is clear that the emission can be deconvoluted into three components with blue, green and red leading to a pure white light emission.
 Fig. 7  Deconvoluted EL spectrum of FCP 2.5 by Lorentz fit. 
Higher current and luminous efficiency values of the OLEDs can be explained by the possible balanced charge carrier injection in the copolymers as evident from the energy band diagram in Fig. 6(c). In contrast, the best efficiency of WOLED reported to date based on polyfluorene with naphthalimide and benzothiadiazole side chain based polymers showed an imbalance in carrier injection.62
Owing to the above imbalance in carrier injection, the above WOLED was reported to show a predominant long wavelength emission in EL compared to its PL spectra. The difference between PL and EL spectra of these polymers is due to charge trapping where the electronic levels of the covalent dopants are located within the band gap of the host (polyfluorene) polymer system. Such observations of charge trapping were observed for white light emitting single polymers with covalent dopants in the main and side chains as well.63 In the present case, it is clear from the band diagram (Fig. 6(c)) that the energy levels of the FCP units are offset from that of poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene-2,7-diyl) and hence the reduced charge trapping.
Theoretical studies on monomer and copolymer
To gain insight into the structural and electronic basis for the experimental findings, the geometry and electronic structure of the model systems were calculated by using density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, excited-state vertical transitions of the model compounds were also predicted by using the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) approach.
The calculated structures and properties of organic electronic materials in the ground and excited states with the Lee–Yang–Parr functional (B3LYP) often provide a good agreement with the experiments compared to other functionals.65–68 Hence, all the calculation were performed by B3LYP functionals. The computational details are given in the supporting information.† It can be seen from Fig. S14 (ESI†) that the optimized geometry of the FCP containing model copolymer (2) has twisted peripheral units with reference to the central fluorene unit. The calculated electron density distributions of frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) are depicted in Fig. 8. It is evident from Fig. 8 that in the FCP unit (1) both HOMO and LUMO are localized on the 2-cyano-3-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)acrylic acid moiety. Close analysis of these orbitals reveals that HOMO is predominantly localized on the electron donating amine nitrogen unit and LUMO is mostly concentrated on the cyanoacrylic acid. As a result, there is a possibility of an intermolecular charge transfer transition between the dimethylamine and the cyano acrylic acid unit. In the case of model system (2) the HOMO is delocalized on the fluorene units.

It is also interesting to note the presence of anti-bonding interactions between two fluorene units. The LUMO of (2) is concentrated on the 2-cyano-3-(4-dimethylaminophenyl) acrylic acid moiety. The electron density distributions of FMO on the different subunits signify that there is an intramolecular charge transfer between fluorene and the 2-cyano-3-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)acrylic acid units in contrast to (1). The origin of the HOMO–LUMO charge density separation is clearly evident from the presence of a node on the C9 carbon of the central fluorene unit which prevents the delocalization of HOMO on the 2-cyano-3-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)acrylic acid unit. Hence, localization of HOMO and LUMO is on the fluorene and cyanoacrylic acid units, respectively. The calculated vertical excitation energies for the monomer and oligomer using the TD-DFT approach are listed in Table 3. Examination of the calculated values shows that the calculated spectral properties of both the monomer and oligomer are in close agreement with the experimental values. For the model (1) the maximum absorption peak is predicted to be at 391 nm (F = 1.1047), which arises from the HOMO to LUMO transition. In (2) the maximum absorption peak is found to be at 371 nm (F = 2.2577) (Fig. S15 of the ESI†). For the same system the intramolecular charge transfer peak can be seen at 431 nm (F = 0.0044). This transition arises from the H → L+1 and H → L. To shed more light on the transitions, the orbitals involved in the dominant excited state electronic transitions were derived from the TD-DFT calculations. The calculated values are presented in Table 3. It can be observed (Table 3) that for both model systems the low energy transition arises from HOMO → LUMO (99%). Emission spectra of the model compounds (1) and (2) were calculated from the optimized excited state geometries. The calculated values are depicted in Fig. S16 (ESI†). For model system (1) the LUMO → HOMO transition mainly contributes to the emission at 426 nm (F = 1.0642), which is in close agreement with the experimental value of 416 nm. Similarly for model compound (2) the emission peak is observed at 420 nm (F = 0.6655), which is in very good agreement with the experimental value of 413 nm.

Conclusion
In this work, we have proposed a new design for a fluorene-derived polymerizable AIEE luminogen, (E)-2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-yl-2-cyano-3-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl) acrylate (FCP) monomer. The molecule elicited a very low PL quantum yield (0.01%) in the solution state that increased to 73.4% upon aggregation in the solid state. A series of solution processable copolymers of FCP with 9,9′-dihexylfluorene were synthesized and their photo physical properties were investigated. The incorporation of the FCP monomer in the polymer backbone resulted in white light emission and an enhanced quantum yield in solid films. The AIEE property in copolymers was observed for FCP 50 and FCP 25 and also the partial enhancement occurred when the FCP composition was at a minimum of 10% to 2.5%, which is comparable with previous reports based on tetraphenylethylene–fluorene copolymers. A pure white light emission was observed in the single copolymer FCP 2.5. The LEDs fabricated with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/EML/Al with FCP 2.5 as the emissive layer displayed an EL with CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.34) that was very close to standard white light emission. The maximum brightness of 9332 cd m−2, maximum power efficiency of 4.83 lm W−1 and maximum current efficiency of 6.34 cd A−1 were observed for FCP 2.5. The enhanced emission in the thin film state of copolymers was attributed to the supramolecular self-assembly of molecules due to the FCP AIE units. Moreover, the EL spectra of FCP 2.5 showed only a slight variation from PL, indicating that the energy transfer is the dominant process in white EL in contrast with previous reports on single layer copolymers even with an additional electron injection layer.
Experimental section
Materials and characterization
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dichloromethane (DCM) were distilled under atmospheric pressure and then purged with nitrogen overnight before use. 2,7-Dibromofluorenone, sodium borohydride, dimethyl amino pyridine, N,N-dimethylamino-4-benzaldehyde, pyridine, 9,9-dihexylfluorene and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received for the synthesis of monomer and copolymers.

1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic studies were measured on a JEOL ECA 500 MHz and Bruker NMR spectrometer using CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS, δ = 0) as the internal standard. Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI) mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker ultraflextreme MALDI-mass spectrometer by using 4-HCCA (α-hydroxycinnamic acid) matrix. Elemental analyses were carried out using a Euro Vector S.P.A, Euro EA 3000 CHNS elemental analyzer.
UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Carey 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer and photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Varian Carey eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer using solutions for absorption and photoluminescence with a concentration of 2.02 × 10−4 g dl−1 (monomer and copolymers). Spectral properties of the thin films were studied using spin coated thin films on optically clean quartz substrates with ∼1 mm thickness prepared from solutions with a concentration of 2 mg ml−1. Cyclic voltammeter (CV) experiments were done using CH instruments, CHI 600D electrochemical work station. The conventional three electrode configuration consists of a platinum disc electrode as the working electrode, a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M TBAPF6) was used as the supporting electrolyte.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were carried out on a DLS instrument from Malvern Instruments. Fluorescence life time experiments were done on a IBH fluorescence life time system with pico second resolution and data analyses were done using HORIBA JOBIN YVON, a decay analysis software program. Atomic force micrographs (AFM) were obtained on a NOVA 1.0.26 RCI atomic force microscope with NT-MDT solver software for analysis, a silicon cantilever (SII) with an average frequency of 260 to 630 kHz with a force constant of 28–91 N m−1 in semi contact mode. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained by an FEI Quanta 200. Samples for AFM and SEM were prepared by spin coating the chloroform solution (2 mg ml−1). 300 microlitres of the solution were coated over the surface area of 1.7 cm2 of an ITO coated glass substrate to simulate the end use device condition. Absolute quantum yield of electroluminescence for the polymer was collected by measuring the total light output in all directions in an integrating sphere using a FLUOROLOG3 (model FL3-II) fluorescence spectrophotometer from JOBIN YVON-SPEX instruments USA. GIXRD studies were performed on films of the polymers coated on ITO substrates using a Bruker AX D8 advance X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα wavelength.
OLEDs of polymers for all devices were fabricated on glass substrates precoated with indium tin oxide (ITO) with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω per square. The substrates were cleaned with ultra purified water, cleaned in an ultrasonic solvent bath, baked in a heating chamber at 120 °C and treated with oxygen plasma for 25 min before use. The PEDOT–PSS (10–30 nm) solution was spin coated on cleaned ITO substrates and baked in a heating chamber at 200 °C for one hour. After the above process 300 μl of polymer solutions with 1 mg ml−1 concentration in CHCl3 were spin coated at 2000 rpm for 60 seconds to get uniform films of polymers (with thickness 100–150 nm) and the aluminium was coated at 10−5 Torr. Current–Voltage (I–V) characteristics were studied on a Keithley 2400 source meter. Luminescence–Voltage (L–V) characteristics of the OLEDs were studied using a NUCLEONIX type 168 PMT housing with drawer assembly. Electroluminescence spectra of the OLEDs were further measured using a Carey Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) color coordinate values of the thin films of the LEDs were standardized using a Konica Minolta CS-100 Chromameter in automated mode.
