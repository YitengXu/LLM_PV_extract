    , Accepted 18th March 2013First published on 19th March 2013AbstractNovel PMMA opal photonic crystal/NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+/Er3+ nanocrystal composites were fabricated and tremendous improvement in upconversion luminescence (UCL) was observed under infrared 980 nm excitation. They were also explored to improve brightness of cell images.
Upconversion nanocrystals (UCNCs), which can convert a low frequency excitation photon into a high frequency emission photon through two-photon or multi-photon processes, are currently attracting extensive interest owing to their unique physical features and a large number of applications, such as solar cells, infrared detection, bio-labels, bio-sensors, etc.1–4 However, in contrast to traditional down-conversion phosphors, there is an obvious drawback of UCNCs, which is their relatively low luminescent quantum efficiency.5 For instance, the microsized hexagonal phase NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ or NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+, which is commonly considered as the most efficient UC phosphor under the pumping of the 980 nm laser diode; its UC quantum efficiency is only about 1% under 980 nm excitation. The efficiency of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs with an average size of 10–20 nm is only approximately one-tenth of the corresponding microsized phosphors.6,7 Therefore, until now it is still a challenge to effectively improve the efficiency of UCNCs to realize various applications. Very recently, various methods have been explored to improve the efficiency of UCNCs, such as changing the host lattices and doping ions of UCNCs, devising core–shell structure and organic–inorganic composites, surface plasmon induced field enhancement of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), etc.7–10
In this communication, we present a novel effective strategy to improve emission strength of hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNCs, which is based on the coupling of NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNCs with three-dimensional PMMA opal photonic crystals (OPCs). Photonic crystals (PCs), a kind of material with a periodically varying refractive index, have attracted intense interest, which can control the propagation of electromagnetic waves and are of practical significance for photonic devices.11 It was frequently used to modulate the emission wavelength, direction, radiative rate and intensity of some luminescent species, such as dyes, quantum dots and rare earth (RE) ions.12–14 However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no literature on UC enhancement related to the coupling of OPCs with UCNCs until now.
PMMA OPCs were prepared by the self-assembly method, by growing PMMA beads onto a glass substrate with vertical deposition, as described in previous work.15 By controlling the diameters of PMMA beads during polymerization, the photonic stop band (PSB) of OPCs was finely tuned. OA-coated hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNCs were prepared by the solvothermal method, at a reaction temperature of 320 °C and the detailed synthesis process has been presented elsewhere.16 Then, NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNCs were dissolved in cyclohexane with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1. After that the glass substrate with (or without) the PMMA opal template was dropped vertically into the cyclohexane solution and placed in an oven at 25 °C for over 4 hours. With the slow volatilization of cyclohexane, the NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNCs were laxly self-organized into the void space of PMMA OPCs or deposited directly on the surface of the glass substrate, driven by the capillary force of the liquid in the evaporation process (see Scheme 1(a)).
 Scheme 1  The schematic (a), the formation of PMMA OPCs/NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNC composites and the optical test path diagram (b). 

Fig. 1 depicts TEM image of NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNCs, typical SEM images of PMMA OPC thin films and the composite films of PMMA/NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ after loading. From Fig. 1(a) it can be seen that NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNCs yield monodispersed nanoparticles (NPs), with an average size of ∼20 nm. Fig. 1(b) shows that before NaYF4 loading, PMMA shows a surprisingly strong preference for close cubic packing (fcc) over the hexagonal (hcp) one and 111 planes are parallel to the substrate, with a lattice constant of a = 320 nm. From the top view of the composites (see Fig. 1(c) and (d)) it can be seen that after loading NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNCs, the edges of PMMA beads consisting of OPCs are corrupted to some extent by cyclohexane solution and are not perfect spheres, while surprisingly, NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNCs are padded regularly at the hexagonal corners of PMMA OPCs, instead of covering the whole surface of PMMA OPCs. The driving force of the deposition could be attributed to electrostatic attraction between PMMA and the NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ NPs which induces the NPs to occupy the potential minimum of the PMMA plane. Note that the average size of NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ NPs does not change after loading and all the composite films of PMMA/NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ demonstrate the same structure. Fig. 1(e) shows the side view of PMMA/NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ composites, which indicates that PMMA OPCs consist of about∼30 layers in the thickness direction. NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNCs are not dispersed into the inner lattices of PMMA OPCs. Fig. 1(f) indicates that very thin but continuous NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ films are formed on the glass substrate, consisting of closely packed UCNCs.

Fig. 2(a) shows the transmittance spectra of various OPCs measured at a normal to the substrate (θ = 0), which shows that the PSB can be tuned in the range of 400–1100 nm and overlap with either 980 nm excitation light or the emission lines of Tm3+. The inset shows that the OPC samples present beautiful structural colors under normal indoor illumination. Note that after loading of NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+, the location of PSB as well as the color of PMMA OPCs are nearly unchanged. The UCL spectra of different samples were measured and compared under the excitation of a 980 nm laser diode with the same excitation power (5 mW), and in the measurements the optical circuit remains unchanged (see Scheme 1(b)). Fig. 2(b) shows a comparison of UCL spectra between the NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ thin film deposited directly on the glass substrate and the NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ thin film deposited on the PMMA OPCs with a PSB of 980 nm. The two emission lines within the blue range are assigned to 1D2–3F4 and 1G4–3H6 transitions of Tm3+, and the lines from the red to the near-infrared region can be attributed to 1G4–3F4, 3F2–3H6, 3F3–3H6 and 3H4–3H6 transitions, in turn. The population of 1D2 originates from a four-photon process, that of 1G4 from a three-photon process, while those of 2F2, 2F3 and 3H4 all from a two-photon process, as shown in the inset.17 In contrast to the NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ thin film, the overall UCL intensity in the composite film increases by more than ∼32-fold. In the other PMMA/NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ composite films, the UCL intensity was also improved considerably than that of the corresponding pure NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ film. It should be highlighted that the UCL enhancement factor (EF) depends strongly on the transition processes of Tm3+, for instance, EF of four photon 1D2–3F4 transition is always much larger than that of three-photon 1G4–3H6, which can be distinguished by the varied intensity ratio of 1D2–3F4 and 1G4–3H6 between the pure NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ film and the composites. Because the red to NIR two-photon UC emissions of the NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ are too weak to detect, the EF of these transitions cannot be accurately determined. All the optical measurements mentioned above are stable and repeatable (see Fig. S1, ESI†).

A comparison of UCL spectra of NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ UCNCs and PMMA/NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ composites (b); inset: UC population and emission processes of NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+. Dependence of the UC enhancement factor as a function of PSB of PMMA OPCs (c). (d) Dependence of decay time constant factor as a function of PSB of PMMA OPCs. 

Fig. 2(c) shows dependence of the overall EF as a function of PSB location. It is obvious that as the PSB location varies, the EF changes from 7 times to more than 30 times. The OPC with a PSB of ∼980 nm is the optimum, which yields an EF of ∼32. As PSB deviates from the location of the excitation band, 980 nm, the EF decreases largely. This indicates that the coupling of OPC with the excitation field is the strongest. The room temperature UCL PSB-dependence of decay time constant of the 1G4–3H6 transitions monitored at 478 nm in all the PMMA/NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ composites and REF samples was measured, as shown in Fig 2(d). It can be concluded that the rising and decay time constants of 1G4–3H6 fluctuated insignificantly with the variation of PSB, with the exception of the OPC with a PSB of 980 nm, while demonstrating a significant decrease. This can be attributed to the enhancement of the excitation field due to its coupling with PSB, which induces an improvement in the local thermal effect and the nonradiative relaxation rate.
In order to further understand the nature of the PC effect on UC enhancement of NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+, the EF as a function of the angle of the incident light in different samples was measured, as shown in Fig. 3. It can be clearly seen that for the OPC with a PSB of 1040 nm, the EF gradually increases with the increase in the angle of incident light, owing to the gradual shift of the PSB toward the location of excitation light with the increase in the angle of incident light. As for the sample with a PSB of 980 nm, EF increases a little as the angle of incident light varies from 0 to 15 degrees, then it decreases obviously with a further increase in the angle of incident light, which is because the location of the PSB becomes far from the excitation light. The EF in the sample with a PSB of 480 nm shows little variation as the angle of incident light changes from 0 to 30 degrees, suggesting that the coupling of PSB with emission light is weak. Therefore, it can be concluded that the universal enhancement of UCL in PMMA/NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ OPCs is mainly due to the random scattering of PMMA spheres to light, and the extra enhancement of the sample with a PSB of 980 nm is due to the PC effect.
 Fig. 3  Dependence of the UC enhancement factor on the angle of incident light and the OPC sample. 
To further make the UCNCs possess the cell imaging function, we modified the NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs with polyacrylic acid (PAA).18 Then the PAA-modified UCNCs with a concentration of 150 μg mL−1 were incubated together with human lung cancer cell line (A549) in chamber slides at 37 °C for 16 h under 5% CO2 gas. After being washed with PBS three times, fixed for 15 min by 5% paraformaldehyde and naturally dried at room temperature on the coverslip, A549 cells were in vitro viewed with a confocal laser scanning microscope under continuous pumping of the 980 nm or the 488 nm laser. The PMMA OPCs was used as reflection substrates to enhance image brightness of A549 cells. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of confocal fluorescence images of A549 cells with and without the assistance of PMMA OPCs. It is obvious that with the assistance of PMMA OPCs, the images of A549 cells become more distinct and bright in contrast to those without the assistance of PMMA OPCs, both under 980 nm UC excitation and 488 nm down-conversion excitation. This meaningful phenomenon was most likely owing to the random scattering of PMMA spheres to light. Note that the toxicity of PMMA OPCs and PMMA/NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ composites is negligible and the composite film is stable in solution (see Fig. S2, ESI†).

In summary, we have fabricated highly ordered PMMA OPC/NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNC composites for the first time and observed considerable improvement of UCL owing to the effective coupling of UCNCs with PMMA OPCs. Moreover, the PMMA OPCs were explored using fluorescence cell imaging, which successfully enhanced the brightness and definition of cell images.
