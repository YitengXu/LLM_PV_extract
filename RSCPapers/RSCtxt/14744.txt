    , Accepted 28th April 2019First published on 1st May 2019AbstractThe plasmonic cerium vanadate (CeVO4) semiconductor and plasmonic silver (Ag) metal exhibit a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in the visible (Vis)-light region; however, weak absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region restricts their environmental remediation and biomedical application. Herein, CeVO4/Ag nanohybrids with self-assembled heterostructure and improved Vis/NIR light absorption were synthesized from CeVO4 nanosheets and AgNO3 solution, which could serve as potential solar-driven catalytic agents and near-infrared (NIR) light responsive anticancer agents. Oleic acid-stabilized CeVO4 nanosheets were modified with the HS-PEG1000-OH by the thiol–ene click reaction and presented self-assembly morphology in aqueous solution due to hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions. Sulfhydryl (–SH) groups provided stable sites for Ag+ ions on the surface of CeVO4, and Ag+ ions could be directly reduced by Ce3+ ions to form CeVO4/Ag heterojunction nanocrystals (NCs). Due to the higher absorption in the Vis/NIR light region than CeVO4 nanosheets, CeVO4/Ag NCs led to the improved solar light responsive photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes. Upon the exposure of these NCs to an 808 nm laser, CeVO4/Ag NCs show high photothermal conversion efficiency, ROS generation ability and photoacoustic (PA) signal for implementing PA imaging-guided photothermal/photodynamic synergistic cancer therapy with better tumor inhibition effect.
1. Introduction
Inorganic semiconductors, due to their unique photo-conversion performance, have shown great potential in environmental remediation and biomedical application as photocatalysts,1–4 photothermal agents,5,6 photosensitizers7–9 and imaging contrast agents.10,11 Semiconductor nanomaterials usually have comparatively small optical cross-sections in the visible (Vis) and near-infrared (NIR) regions,12 particularly wide-band semiconductors.13,14 As a result, most semiconductor nanomaterials interwork weakly with Vis/NIR light,15 which occupy a mass of energy portion in the whole solar spectrum. Great efforts have been devoted to improving the Vis/NIR light response of wide-band semiconductor nanomaterials for photocatalysts, phototherapy and multimode imaging.16–18 As a p-type wide-band semiconductor,19 cerium vanadate (CeVO4) has demonstrated outstanding redox properties20 and optical nature21 because of the specific 4f electronic structure and abundant electronic transition mode of the rare earth elements.22 It can also convert reversibly between Ce3+ and Ce4+,23 which endows it with oxidation resistance as a biological safeguard against inflammation and radiation injury.24 Meanwhile, CeVO4 has slight absorption in the Vis/NIR region due to intriguing plasmonic properties.25 That is to say, it could serve as potential solar-driven photocatalysts and NIR-responsive anticancer nanotheronastic agents.26,27
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) means that the optical excitation induces cooperative oscillations of free electric charges limited in various metal and semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs).28 Upon resonant excitation, the absorption and scattering cross profiles of the nanocrystals and the local electromagnetic field in the nanosize spatial range are greatly improved.29,30 The most investigated plasmonic NCs are precious metals of Ag,31,32 Au,33,34 and Pt,35 which is in favor of LSPR effect in the Vis/NIR spectrum region.28 The LSPR of precious metal NCs, depending on the size, shape and chemical composition,36,37 has generated great concern due to the interesting optical performances and tremendous versatile application of science and technology.38,39 In comparison with single-ingredient ones, heterojunction nanostructures can present comprehensive features or novel functions.40,41 The integration of plasmonic semiconductors with precious metals to form semiconductor/metal plasmonic heterostructure has lately acquired lots of concern due to the enhanced LSPR,42,43 which exhibited excellent properties, such as photoconversion,44 fluorescence,45,46 photocatalysis,47,48 photodegradation,49,50 surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS),51 magnetism52,53 and so on. In the past few years, plasmonic coupling between metal nanostructures and semiconductors has opened up a new regime in plasmonics for photocatalysis and phototherapy, such as Au@Cu9S5,28 AuNR@Cu2−xSe,29 Au@Cu2−xS core–shell NCs,54 Bi2S3@Au,55 Au core@void@CuS yolk–shell nanoparticles56 and so on.
Compared with Au NCs, Ag NCs with lower cost show more effective plasmonic properties over a large energy region.57 Silver NCs have attracted increasing attention for different biomedical applications such as biosensing, cancer treatment and biomedical imaging due to their size-dependent photophysical properties and local surface plasmon resonance which is sensitive to refractive index changes in the surrounding environment.38,39,58,59 Moreover, unlike most present research focusing on coupling plasmonic chalcogenides semiconductor with noble metal Au nanocrystals, this is the first report on plasmonic coupling between noble metal Ag NCs and rare earth orthovanadates of CeVO4 semiconductors. Hot electrons from Ag NCs could reach the conduction band of CeVO4 through plasmon-induced interfacial charge transfer upon the excitation of the LSPR.24,30 Thus, the plasmon-enhanced heterojunction structure of CeVO4/Ag NCs showed enhanced Vis/NIR light absorption property, stronger photothermal conversion performance and excellent ROS generation ability than pristine CeVO4 NCs, which led to improved solar-driven photocatalysis and NIR-responsive photothermal/photodynamic synergistic therapy (PTT/PDT). Meanwhile, owing to the thermal dilation under NIR irradiation, CeVO4/Ag could also act as a contrast reagent for photoacoustic (PA) imaging, which could implement PA imaging-guided PTT/PDT with better tumor suppression effect.
2. Results and discussion
The preparation process of CeVO4/Ag is illustrated in Scheme 1. Oleic acid (OA)-stabilized CeVO4 nanosheets were synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method.60 To transform hydrophobic NCs into hydrophilic ones and to improve biocompatibility, HS-PEG1000-OH was modified on the surface of CeVO4via a facile thiol–ene click reaction triggered by a UV lamp. This method first cleaved DMPA and generated radicals, followed by the abstraction of the hydrogen atom of thiol to form thiyl radical species and add to the CC bonds of OA, then forming C–S on the active site (Fig. S1†).61 Because of the large specific surface area of CeVO4 nanosheets and the flexibility of HS-PEG1000-OH, some CC bonds sites were covered by HS-PEG1000-OH, resulting in inadequate surface modification. After washing and centrifuging CeVO4, samples were transferred to water from THF and presented self-assembly morphology due to hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions. Sulfhydryl (–SH) groups provided stable sites for Ag+ ions on the surface of CeVO4, and Ag+ ions could be directly reduced by Ce3+ ions to form CeVO4/Ag heterojunction nanocrystals. The integration of the CeVO4 semiconductor and Ag metal into a single unit with low toxicity could take advantage of plasmon-enhanced absorption in the Vis/NIR region to perform solar-driven photocatalysis for sewage treatment and NIR-responsive anticancer treatment.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the transformation process of hydrophobic CeVO4 into hydrophilic one (a) and the synthesis process of CeVO4/Ag (b). 
The OA-capped CeVO4 nanosheets were obtained via the hydrothermal method (Fig. S2A†), and HS-PEG1000-OH was modified onto the surface for transforming hydrophobic CeVO4 to be hydrophilic ones. After surface modification, CeVO4 still maintained its sheet morphology (Fig. S2B†) and tetragonal phase (Fig. S3†). As shown in the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Fig. S4†), the characteristic peak at 3006 cm−1 (C–H) weakened and a new peak at 1106 cm−1 (–CH2–O–) appeared, confirming the certain modification of HS-PEG1000-OH onto the OA-capped CeVO4 surface. Furthermore, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) study (Fig. S5†) showed that the weight loss of OA-capped CeVO4 was 35.3%, owing to the pyrolysis of OA ligands, while the weight loss of the HS-PEG1000-capped CeVO4 was 50.2%, 14.9% higher than OA-capped CeVO4, owing to the pyrolysis of HS-PEG1000-OH, which illustrated the successful synthesis of HS-PEG1000-capped CeVO4. On this basis, Ag nanoparticles could be successfully deposited onto HS-PEG1000-capped CeVO4 to form CeVO4/Ag heterojunction nanocrystals. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images clearly showed the formation of CeVO4/Ag nanohybrids (Fig. 1A and Fig. S6†). According to the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image, the lattice distances of 0.2448 nm and 0.3623 nm correspond with the (200) plane of Ag and the (224) plane of CeVO4 (Fig. 1B), respectively. As shown in the elemental mapping (Fig. 1C), the Ce, V, O and S elements showed uniform dispersity and the Ag element distributes randomly in the CeVO4/Ag nanohybrids. It is interesting to find that the dispersive CeVO4 nanosheets tend to show self-assembly morphology in aqueous solution due to the hydrophilic–hydrophilic interaction caused by inadequate surface modification. Meanwhile, two sets of diffraction peaks assigned to the tetragonal phase CeVO4 (JCPDS No. 82-1969) and the cubic phase Ag (JCPDS No. 89-3722) were observed from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of CeVO4/Ag (Fig. S7†). The increased average hydrodynamic particle sizes from 61.21 nm to 127 nm and decreased zeta potential from 23.2 mV to 14.7 mV further indicate the formation of CeVO4/Ag (Fig. S8 and S11†). In addition, CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag displayed steady dispersion in various physiological solutions (Fig. S9†), and their hydrodynamic sizes remained constant after seven days of incubation in DMEM-containing serum (Fig. S10†).

The reaction mechanism of synthesizing CeVO4/Ag could be inferred from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. As shown in Fig. 1D and E, the binding energies of 881.1 and 900.0 eV indicate the existence of Ce4+, while the binding energies of 885.3 and 904.0 eV correspond to Ce3+,26 which endows CeVO4 with the ability to reduce Ag+ to Ag due to the presence of redox valence state in CeVO4. As shown in Fig. S12,† both wide XPS scan spectra of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag present Ce, V and O peaks, while the signal of Ag 3d3/2 (374.4 eV) and Ag 3d5/2 (368.4 eV) appear only in CeVO4/Ag. According to the reported binding energies of neutral Ag, ranging from 368.1 to 369.0 eV,62 uncharged Ag exists in CeVO4/Ag, indicating that the redox process occurred during the reaction. In addition, the contrast experiment was carried out under the same experimental conditions except using Nd(NO3)3 instead of Ce(NO3)3 to form NdVO4 nanosheets. No Ag peaks could be observed in the XRD pattern, and no Ag nanoparticles appeared in the TEM image as well (Fig. S13†). Furthermore, there were no Ag signals in the XPS spectrum (Fig. S14†). These results further verify that the redox environment in CeVO4 nanocrystals plays a decisive role in the formation of CeVO4/Ag.
The simple integration of the CeVO4 semiconductor and Ag metal into a single unit could provide enhanced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect. The optical properties of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag were studied by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2A, both samples had the similar characteristic peak of Ce3+ ions at 273 nm, while an intense absorption peak of CeVO4/Ag could be observed at the wavelength of 436 nm due to LSPR absorption of Ag NPs, resulting in an enhanced absorption in the Vis/NIR region as compared to single CeVO4, which is favorable for promoting solar-driven photocatalytic ability and NIR-responsive photothermal/photodynamic effect. The photocatalytic performances of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag were evaluated by methyl blue (MB) degradation experiments under sunlight irradiation. On the basis of the variation in the characteristic absorption peak intensity of time-dependent degradation of MB in Fig. S15,† the solar-driven photocatalytic degradation performances of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag could be detected. Meanwhile, photocatalytic ability contrast between CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag was presented in the pattern of the degradation rate. As shown in Fig. 2B, CeVO4/Ag represents higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency (88.0%) compared with the single CeVO4 (56.9%). In contrast, only 5.0% of MB could be degraded naturally under the same light irradiation condition for 60 min. The improved photocatalytic property of CeVO4/Ag could be ascribed to enhanced Vis/NIR light absorption due to the LSPR effect of Ag nanoparticles. To explore the photothermal performance of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag, the temperature change of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag solutions via 808 nm laser irradiation was recorded. As presented in Fig. 2C, the temperature of the CeVO4/Ag solution rose 34.7 °C in 5 min under 808 nm NIR laser irradiation (1.9 W cm−2), while the temperature of deionized water barely changed under the same conditions. Note that the CeVO4 solution could only increase by 25.2 °C after 5 min of irradiation. In addition, concentration- and power density-dependent experiments were also carried out (Fig. 2D and Fig. S16†). As expected, both CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag solutions showed elevated temperature with increasing concentration or power density, while the CeVO4/Ag solution exhibited a greater photothermal effect than the single CeVO4 solution. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) of CeVO4/Ag was 23.48% (as shown in Fig. 2E and F), which was twice as high as that of CeVO4 (only 14.91%) (Fig. S17†). The above results demonstrated that the light-to-heat conversion ability of CeVO4/Ag had improved due to enhanced LSPR absorption in the NIR region. Thus, plasmonic coupling between CeVO4 semiconductor and Ag metal exhibited enhanced photocatalytic and photothermal effect, which is beneficial for cancer treatment in the biomedical field.

(F) Linear time data versus −lnθ obtained from the cooling period of CeVO4/Ag aqueous solution. 
Moreover, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation ability of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag under 808 nm laser irradiation was also investigated. Because of LSPR excitation, Ag NPs could absorb resonant photons to produce hot electrons (Fig. 3A). Subsequently, the hot electrons from Ag NPs could reach the conduction band of CeVO4 through plasmon-induced interfacial charge transfer, which overcomes the wide band gaps of CeVO427 (3.08 eV) and CeVO4/Ag (3.07 eV) (Fig. S18†) and results in abundant electrons/holes generation in CeVO4/Ag heterojunction NCs. On the one hand, the hot electrons could be captured by O2 to produce ˙O2−. The capability of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag to generate ˙O2− upon photoexcitation was monitored by a 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) probe. As shown in Fig. 3B and Fig. S19,† the absorption intensity of DPBF in the CeVO4/Ag group decreased clearly as the NIR irradiation time increased, while the absorption intensity hardly changed in the CeVO4 group. On the other hand, the remaining holes in the valence band of CeVO4 could oxidize H2O to generate ˙OH, which subsequently leads to the degradation of methylene blue (MB). As displayed in Fig. 3B and Fig. S20,† compared with the CeVO4 group, the absorbance of MB diminished dramatically when CeVO4/Ag was irradiation with an 808 nm laser for 60 min. The above results indicated that the separation of electron/hole pairs originated from the hot-electron injection effect, resulting in plentiful ROS generation effectively upon photoexcitation. To investigate intracellular ROS production effect, NIR-induced intracellular ROS generation was measured by non-fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), which could be changed into fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), showing green emission once oxidized by ROS. As displayed in Fig. 3C, no visible fluorescence for the control, NIR, CeVO4, CeVO4/Ag or CeVO4 plus NIR groups could be observed. However, CeVO4/Ag plus NIR irradiation resulted in abundant ROS generation, as shown by the light green fluorescence of DCF, which further demonstrates the improved ROS production ability of CeVO4/Ag induced by the hot-electron injection effect upon photoexcitation.

With enhanced photothermal conversion performance and ROS generation ability, CeVO4/Ag could act as an excellent photothermal/photodynamic anticancer agent. To demonstrate the effective cellular uptake of CeVO4/Ag NCs by cancer cells in vitro, the fluorescence dye FITC was used to label CeVO4/Ag. As shown in Fig. 4A, the blue fluorescence from the cell nucleus dyed with DAPI and the green fluorescence from the endocytosis of CeVO4/Ag show obvious overlay, proving that CeVO4/Ag could be internalized effectively via endocytosis. In consideration of the cytotoxicity of Ag ions, the supernatants of CeVO4/Ag before and after NIR laser irradiation were collected for the detection of Ag ion concentration by ICP-MS. As shown in Fig. S21,† the nanosystem displayed negligible Ag ion release, which supports the biocompatibility of CeVO4/Ag NCs. Subsequently, the biocompatibility of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag was measured on an L929 fibroblast cell. No significant cytotoxicity was observed at high concentrations of CeVO4/Ag (200 μg mL−1), which ensured great potential application for cancer treatment (Fig. 4B and Fig. S22†).

(B) L929 cell viability when incubated with CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag for 24 h at different concentrations.

(D) HeLa cell viability when incubated with CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag (200 μg mL−1) for 24 h under 808 nm laser irradiation with different power densities for 5 min. (E) Flow cytometric analysis of the apoptosis of HeLa cells by staining with Annexin V-FITC and PI after different treatments: (a) control; (b) NIR light only; (c) CeVO4; (d) CeVO4/Ag; (e) CeVO4 + NIR light; (f) CeVO4/Ag + NIR light. The concentration of NCs is 200 μg mL−1 and NIR light refers to irradiation under an 808 nm laser at a power density of 1.9 W cm−2 for 5 min. 
Then, the NIR-induced phototoxicity of CeVO4/Ag was evaluated via a standard methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. As shown in Fig. 4C and D, the concentration and power density dependence drastically declining in proportion to cell viability were detected, and the cell mortality reached up to about 87% when the HeLa cells were treated with a relatively low dose of 200 μg mL−1 of CeVO4/Ag plus 808 nm laser irradiation (1.9 W cm−2, 5 min). In contrast, the phototoxicity of CeVO4 to HeLa cells was also assessed. Only about 46% of HeLa cells were killed under the same conditions, which is invalid for in vitro cancer treatment. In addition, the flow cytometry data clearly proves the path of cell apoptosis induced by NIR laser irradiation. As presented in Fig. 4E, Annexin-V/PI staining cells of the control group, NIR laser irradiation, CeVO4 or CeVO4/Ag incubation show a great living cell proportion. However, compared with the CeVO4 plus NIR laser irradiation group, the NIR-induced photothermal treatment of HeLa cells with CeVO4/Ag group showed a larger proportional transfer from viable cells to apoptotic cells. These data demonstrate the good biocompatibility and excellent NIR-triggered phototoxicity of CeVO4/Ag NCs, which could effectively absorb NIR light and generate hyperthermia and ROS to induce the apoptosis of cancer cells.
Multimodal imaging can provide comprehensive and valuable information for assessing and adjusting cancer therapy. In this study, the feasibility of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag as multimodal imaging contrast agents in vitro and in vivo was accessed. Fig. S23† shows photothermal response imaging in vitro captured by the infrared thermal camera per minute under continuous 808 nm laser irradiation. The temperature of CeVO4/Ag increased to about 42.8 °C, which was obviously higher than that of CeVO4 (27.1 °C) (Fig. S24A†). However, deionized water increased by only 2.3 °C under the same conditions. The real-time in vivo thermal images captured by the infrared thermal camera with 808 nm laser irradiation are presented in Fig. 5A. The temperature variation in the tumor region of control, CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag (20 mg kg−1) groups were recorded per minute during irradiation (Fig. S24B†). The temperature of the tumor region increased swiftly in the CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag groups via the identical 808 nm laser irradiation, increasing to 47.1 and 61.6 °C, respectively. The localized hyperthermia in the tumor regions of the CeVO4/Ag group could be attributed to the enhanced NIR absorption caused by the LSPR effect. In contrast, no obvious temperature increase of the control group was observed, suggesting that the laser irradiation is safe enough towards healthy tissues and could stimulate these NCs to generate photodamage to tumor regions. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging as an emerging noninvasive bioimaging technology, owing to the thermal dilation of CeVO4/Ag under NIR irradiation, shows superior spatial resolution and enhanced tissue penetration depth.63 As presented in Fig. 5B, the in vitro PA signal intensity of CeVO4/Ag dramatically rose more obviously than that of CeVO4 as the concentration increased from 0.03 to 0.5 mg mL−1. A quantitative study manifested the linear dependence between the PA signal intensity and the CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag contents, respectively (Fig. S25†). As presented in Fig. 5C, the tumor region of the CeVO4/Ag group presented obviously stronger PA signals compared with the CeVO4 and control groups. The outstanding in vivo imaging abilities indicate the significant potential of CeVO4/Ag NCs as an ideal PT/PA dual-modal contrast agent in the biomedical field.

(B) PA imaging phantoms, consisting of various concentrations of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag embedded in agar gel cylinders. (C) PA images of tumor site after intratumor injection with normal saline, CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag (20 mg kg−1, 100 μL). 
The outstanding PT/PA imaging performances, localized hyperthermia of the tumor region and ROS generation ability under NIR irradiation manifested the valid tumor monitoring and inhibiting effect induced by CeVO4/Ag NCs, which could serve as an NIR-responsive theranostic agent for imaging-guided cancer diagnose and treatment in vivo. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Jilin University (Changchun, China) and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the National Regulation of China for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Here, H22 tumor-bearing mice were divided into six groups at random: (a) normal saline injection only (control group), (b) 808 nm NIR irradiation only, (c) pure CeVO4 injection only, (d) pure CeVO4/Ag injection only, (e) CeVO4 injection plus NIR laser irradiation (0.7 W cm−2) for 5 min and (f) CeVO4/Ag injection plus NIR laser irradiation (0.7 W cm−2) for 5 min. The therapeutic schedule was implemented on day 0. The representative mice photographs and excised tumors of each group were taken at the end of therapy (Fig. 6A), and the tumor volume changes were recorded every 2 days during the 14-day treatment (Fig. 6B). Compared with groups 1–4, the CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag injection plus NIR irradiation groups showed a higher tumor suppression ratio, particularly the latter showed almost no tumor growth, confirming the great tumor inhibition efficacy induced by NIR-triggered PTT/PDT. Moreover, the weights of these mice showed no evident variation after the different treatments (Fig. 6C), which suggested the security and nontoxicity of CeVO4 and CeVO4/Ag and the therapy regimen to H22 tumor-bearing mice in the research. Histology analysis of major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) from the mice after NIR-induced anticancer therapy demonstrated no noticeable abnormalities or appreciable organ injury (Fig. S26†).

For the further use of CeVO4/Ag as a PT/PA imaging-guided PTT/PDT agent in vivo, it is necessary to evaluate the in vivo long-term toxicity of the CeVO4/Ag NCs. This investigation could be achieved by monitoring the blood biochemical index, weight fluctuation, histological examinations and bio-distribution. Healthy Balb/c mice were injected intravenously with CeVO4/Ag NCs (20 mg kg−1), and normal saline injection mice were used as the control group in the meantime. Serum biochemistry analysis was implemented at 1, 7, and 14 d postinjection administration of CeVO4/Ag NCs (Fig. S27A–C†). Encouragingly, all the measured parameters fell within the normal range and were pretty close to the control group (Table S1, ESI†), indicating no hepatic or renal dysfunction induced by CeVO4/Ag NCs. Moreover, the weights of mice in the CeVO4/Ag group presented similar variation as the control group during the 14 days (Fig. S27D†), suggesting that the CeVO4/Ag has no obvious poisonous effects on healthy mice. The histology analysis (heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney) is presented in Fig. S28,† suggesting that no apparent lesions or necrocytosis were found in the CeVO4/Ag group or the control group. The in vivo bio-distribution experiment was carried out by injecting healthy mice with CeVO4/Ag NCs intravenously. The main organs and tumors were resected from the mice at time points of 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days post-injection, and the Ce and Ag contents were measured via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). As displayed in Fig. S29,† Ce and Ag were distributed widely in different organs after 1 h, yet both Ce and Ag retained high content enrichment in the liver, owing to the elimination of extraneous substances via the macrophage in the early stage. Over time, the content of Ce and Ag in the liver gradually decreased, and most of the CeVO4/Ag NCs were excreted overtly from the liver after 7 days post-injection. The CeVO4/Ag NCs could effectively accumulate in the tumor site due to the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. Moreover, the concentration variations of Ce and Ag elements distributed in the feces and urine at different time points (Fig. S30†) indicated that the CeVO4/Ag NCs were mainly excreted through feces. Hence, all the above data suggested that CeVO4/Ag had no obvious poisonous effects on healthy mice, and eases the fears of the long-term toxicity of CeVO4/Ag in vivo.
3. Conclusions
In summary, OA-stabilized CeVO4 nanosheets were modified with HS-PEG1000-OH via the thiol–ene click reaction and presented self-assembly morphology in aqueous solution due to hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions. Sulfhydryl (–SH) groups provided stable sites for Ag+ ions on the surface of CeVO4, and Ag+ ions could be directly reduced by Ce3+ ions to form CeVO4/Ag heterojunction nanocrystals. The CeVO4/Ag showed improved Vis/NIR light absorption due to the LSPR effect of Ag nanoparticles, thus resulting in enhanced solar-driven photocatalytic performance, photothermal conversion ability and ROS generation capability compared to single CeVO4. For further application, CeVO4/Ag could serve as a PT/PA imaging-guided photothermal/photodynamic theranostic agent with better tumor suppression effect.
