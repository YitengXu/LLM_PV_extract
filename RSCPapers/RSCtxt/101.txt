, Accepted 26th March 2015First published on 7th April 2015AbstractTwo new D–π–A–π–D-type diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based organic small molecules (OSMs), M3 and M4, were synthesized successfully, consisting of ethynyl as π-linkage, and containing alkylated carbazole and fluorene as terminal electron-donating groups, respectively. To investigate the triple-bond effect on the optical electronic properties, non-ethynyl analogues M1 and M2 with a single-bond-linkage were designed and synthesized as well. The relationship between molecular structure and property was thoroughly investigated by experimental and theoretical studies. In contrast, the ethynyl-linkage structural design could not only lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, but also delicately balance the relationship between the deep-lying HOMO and narrow band gap, thus improving the photovoltaic (PV) performance. As a result, compounds M3 and M4 exhibited relatively deep-lying HOMO levels relative to M1 and M2, resulting in the corresponding PV devices with an increased open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.84 V and 0.98 V, with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.99% and 3.10%, respectively. Whereas M1 and M2 based devices showed a VOC of 0.46 V and 0.89 V, and a PCE of 1.48% and 2.23%, respectively. The best PV performance of M4 was primarily attributed to the deep-lying HOMO level and reasonably high hole mobility caused by the structural design with an ethynyl-linkage and a fluorene end-capping group. We found that the systematic investigation of the triple bond effect on novel OSMs could be critical for a deep understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and property. This work provided an important guide for the rational design of novel PV materials.
Introduction
In the past few decades, many investigations have been made into organic solar cells (OSCs) as alternatives to silicon semiconductor based solar cells because of their advantages of low-cost, easy-synthesis, high-flexibility, light-weight and the possibility of large-scale fabrication.1 It is worth mentioning that solution-processable polymer-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs have received much attention with PCEs near 10%.2 Meanwhile, solution-processed organic small molecules (OSMs) have become a fast growing field due to their potential of easy purification, well-defined structure and easy reproduction.3 In particular, an encouraging PCE of 10.10% has been achieved by Chen's group,4 making OSMs an excellent candidate for BHJ OSCs. However, the overall performance of OSMs-based BHJ devices is still behind those of their polymer counterparts. Hence, OSMs-based BHJ OSCs still require better material design for practical applications.
Low bandgap (Eg) conjugated D–π–A–π–D-typed OSMs are emerging as promising materials for the development of OSCs due to the improved absorption. The most straightforward way to reduce Eg of molecular donors is to either lower its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (LUMO) or raise its HOMO level. In other words, reducing Eg of OSMs to broaden the absorption range will enhance the short circuit current density (JSC), whereas increasing HOMO level will inevitably result in a loss of VOC.5 Since the VOC of the BHJ device is determined by the energy difference between the HOMO of donor material and the LUMO of acceptor.6 It is thus important to develop a delicate balance between the Eg and energy levels by fine-tuning the molecular structure. As previously reported, an effective method is to introduce electron-withdrawing moiety into the conjugated backbone, such as cyano-insertion and fluorine-substitution.7 It is worth mentioning that the linker-effect between the D and A units on the D–A-type materials provides an important guide for rational design of novel PV materials.8 In this work, we aim to investigate the ethynyl-linkage effect on novel OSMs. Among many studies, the ethynyl is recognized as one of typical π-linkage unit, because it could not only increase the rigidity of molecules, but also improve the molecular planarity, thus facilitating intra- and inter-molecular interaction.9 Therefore, systematic study of the ethynyl-linkage effect on novel OSMs will be important for deeply understanding the relationship between the structure and property of molecules.
In this work, DPP-based OSMs named M3 and M4 were designed and synthesized successfully, consisting of ethynyl as π-linkage, and containing alkylated carbazole and fluorene as terminal electron-donating groups, respectively. To fully understand the triple-bond effect on optical electronic property and molecular structure, compounds M1 and M2 with single-bond-linkage were designed and synthesized as reference molecules. The chemical structures of them are shown in Scheme 1. Among these compounds, DPP was chosen as the electron-withdrawing core since it has been well known as exceptional acceptor unit with broad absorption and high electron affinity.10 The motivation for choosing alkylated carbazole or fluorene as end-capping donors was due to their good electron-donating property and charge transport capacity.11 The photophysical and electrochemical measurements, as well as DFT calculations demonstrated that these synthesized OSMs combined broad absorption, efficient charge mobility and compatible energy level matching with PC61BM. Therefore, their PV properties were investigated by fabricating BHJ OSCs with PC61BM as acceptor. In comparison with M1 and M2, compounds M3 and M4 exhibited a deep-lying HOMO, resulting in the corresponding PV devices with an increased VOC of 0.84 V and 0.98 V, with PCEs of 1.99% and 3.10%, respectively. Whereas M1 and M2 based device showed the VOC of 0.46 V and 0.89 V, with the PCEs of 1.48% and 2.23%, respectively. As expected, incorporating the ethynyl-linkage into these OSMs contributes to the improvement of PV performance.

Experimental section
Materials, measurement and characterization
All reagents were purchased and used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried by distillation from metallic sodium/benzophenone before use. All reactions and manipulations were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere with the use of standard Schlenk technique unless otherwise noted. 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were performed on Bruker AVANCE II 400 MHz spectrometer, with CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 as solvent and TMS as the internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained using a MALDI Micro MX spectrometer. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer in chloroform solution and in thin film. Fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out with a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer. The electrochemical experiment was performed in 0.1 M anhydrous Bu4NBF4/CH2Cl2 solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 under nitrogen atmosphere using a CHI 610D electrochemical workstation from CH Instruments, Inc. The glass-carbon electrode, platinum wire electrode and Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M AgNO3 in MeCN) electrode served as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple was selected as internal standard. The J–V curves were obtained with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under simulated AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The hole mobility measurement of the device was carried out in the dark with Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit system. The IPCE spectra were recorded using a SM-25 photoelectric conversion analyzer.
Fabrication of PV device
Solution-processed PV devices were fabricated with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/OSMs:PC61BM (1:2, w/w)/Al. The ITO-coated glass substrate (10 Ω sq−1) was cleaned successively by ultrasonic in deionized water, methanol, acetone, toluene and isopropyl alcohol. Then a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated on the substrate at 4000 rpm s−1 for 60 s. After being baked at 140 °C for 20 min, the substrate was transferred into the glovebox. Subsequently, the active layer was prepared by spin-coating with the mixed solution of OSMs and PC61BM at 1500 rpm s−1 for 60 s (total concentration of 12 mg mL−1 in chloroform) on the top of prepared substrate. Finally, an aluminium layer was deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation (ca. 10−4 Pa) through a shadow mask, yielding six individual devices with 5 mm2 nominal area. The hole-only devices for hole mobility measurement with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/OSMs:PC61BM (1:2, w/w)/Au were fabricated, and the gold layer was used as the negative electrode.

The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at 110 °C for 24 h then cooled to room temperature. The resulting mixture was poured into 50 mL deionized water and the organic layer was separated. Then the aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (3 × 20 mL) and the combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Finally, the solvent was removed and the residue was purified by silica column chromatography with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 as eluent to afford the target compound.

Results and discussion
Material design and synthesis
The synthetic routes of compounds are shown in Scheme 2. DPP-based acceptor moiety A was synthesized in three steps starting from commercially available 2-thiophenecarbonitrile and dimethyl succinate according to previously reported methods.12 The synthetic details of 1b and 2a are shown in ESI.† The Miyaura borylation reactions of the halogen substituted donating groups and bis(pinacolato)diborane (B2Pin2) were carried out using KOAc as a base and Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 as the catalyst in toluene, resulting in compounds 1 and 2 in yields of 60% and 76%, respectively. Finally, using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and 2 M K2CO3 as the base in toluene,11a,13 M1 and M2 were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reactions at 110 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere in yields of 65% and 68%, respectively. On the other hand, Sonogashira cross-coupling of halogen substituted centre donating groups with trimethylsilyl acetylene afforded compound 1c and 2b in yields of 48% and 88%, respectively, with Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 and CuI as the catalyst and Et3N as the base in THF. Cleavage of trimethylsilyl group with K2CO3 in the mixture solution of methanol and THF afforded compounds 3 and 4 in high yields of 96% and 84%, respectively.14 Finally, compounds M3 and M4 were obtained by Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions in yields of 65% and 69%, respectively.15 The chemical structures of the synthesized products were identified by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and HRMS. Four synthesized materials (M1, M2, M3 and M4) are readily dissolved in common organic solvents due to alkyl-substituted core and end-capping groups, which satisfy the requirement for device fabrication of solution-process.
Theoretical calculations
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to preliminarily investigate the influence of molecular structure on their electronic properties. The ground-state geometry and the electronic-density distribution of these compounds have been optimized by Gaussian 09 software at the Becke's three-parameter gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP) with a polarized 6-31G(d) basis, and the calculated results are depicted in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the HOMODFT levels delocalize over the entire molecular skeleton, whereas the LUMODFT appears to be distributed throughout the molecule with a greater electronic-density of the DPP than the HOMODFT. The theoretically calculated HOMODFT values of them are −4.50, −4.68, −4.56 and −4.72 eV, and the corresponding LUMODFT values are −2.24, −2.44, −2.44 and −2.61 eV for M1, M2, M3 and M4, respectively. Obviously, the ethynyl-containing compounds M3 and M4 exhibit lower HOMODFT and LUMODFT energy level than those of M1 and M2, thus resulting in a decrease of EDFTg from 2.26 and 2.24 eV to 2.12 and 2.11 eV, respectively. The DFT calculation results indicated that the ethynyl-containing compounds could balance the relationship between the lower energy levels and the narrower EDFTg compared with those single-bond compounds.

To better understand the correlation between the molecular structure and property, the backbone conformation and the dihedral angles were discussed. Fig. 1(b) displays the molecular geometries and the calculated dihedral angles of these compounds. The θ1 is dihedral angle between DPP unit and thiophene ring, θ2 is dihedral angle between thiophene and bridge-linkage (triple bond or single bond), and θ3 is dihedral angle between ethynyl-linkage and terminal electron-donating groups. The θ1 for these four molecules are less than 1.5°, which suggests that the introduction of thiophene rings has little influence on the planarity of the core DPP.16 However, the θ2 are 25° and 27.73° for M1 and M2, respectively, indicating a decrease in planarity with the introduction of end-capped donor groups. In contrast, θ2 and θ3 are less than 1.0° for M3 and M4, which indicates that the torsion angles between thiophene and side groups are weakened in M3 and M4 due to the ethynyl-linkage. These results strongly suggested that the ethynyl-bridge could stiffen the molecular structure and eliminate the torsion, contributing to both intra- and intermolecular charge transport, thereby perhaps improving the PV performance.

All of them exhibit strong absorption bands in the long wavelength region due to the ICT transition. In solution, compounds M1–M4 exhibit high molar absorption coefficients (ε) of 84100 M−1 cm−1 at 623 nm, 50800 M−1 cm−1 at 621 nm, 86600 M−1 cm−1 at 626 nm and 76100 M−1 cm−1 at 623 nm, respectively. Notably, M3 and M4 show slightly higher ε relative to corresponding single-bond compounds M1 and M2, indicating that the ethynyl-bridge compounds contribute to the ICT process. In the thin film state, the absorption bands of them are broadened and red-shifted relative to those in solution due to solid-state packing. Furthermore, the optical band gaps (Eoptg) corresponding to their absorption onsets are 1.67 eV for M1, 1.65 eV for M3, 1.78 eV for M2 and 1.71 eV for M4, respectively, which are consistent with their electrochemical band gaps (ECVg).

Photoinduced charge separation. The fluorescence quenching experiment was performed to investigate the photoinduced charge separation process between the synthesized donor material and the acceptor PC61BM. The fluorescence quenching phenomenon of M1, M2, M3 and M4 in chloroform was observed, as shown in Fig. 3. The results showed that the fluorescence intensity of these compounds gradually decreased with the increasing concentration of PC61BM as shown in Fig. 3(a), suggesting an efficient charge separation process between donor and acceptor material PC61BM. Fig. 3(b) shows the fluorescence images in the absence and presence of quencher PC61BM, obviously the fluorescence was quenched with quencher. Moreover, the dependency of the emission intensity on the concentration of quencher PC61BM was described by the Stern–Volmer equation and a linear relationship was followed: F0/F = 1 + KSV[C], where KSV is the quenching constant, F0 and F represent the fluorescence intensity in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively, and [C] is the concentration of quencher.17 The fitting plots by Stern–Volmer equation are shown in insets of Fig. 3(a). Accordingly, the KSV values of M1, M2, M3 and M4 are 1528, 1566, 1603 and 1705 M−1, respectively. The values suggest that the charge separation of M4 is more efficient relative to others, in agreement with its best PV performance.

Electrochemical properties
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed to evaluate approximately the ECVg and energy levels (HOMOCV and LUMOCV) of these compounds (CV measurements details are described in Experimental section).13,18 The cyclic voltammogram of them are shown in Fig. 4, and the related electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. The onset reduction potentials (Ered) of M1, M2, M3 and M4 are −1.40, −1.32, −1.23 and −1.20 V, respectively, and their onset oxidation potentials (Eox) are 0.29, 0.46, 0.42 and 0.55 V, respectively. As a result, the increasing of reduction and oxidation potential values of M3 and M4 relative to M1 and M2 can be rationally attributed to the introduction of the electron-withdrawing ethynyl-linkage. The corresponding LUMOCV and HOMOCV energy levels could be obtained from Ered and Eox by following equation: LUMOCV/HOMOCV = −[Ered/ox − Eferrocene1/2 + 4.8] eV.19 Accordingly, the LUMOCV levels of M1, M2, M3 and M4 are −3.31, −3.39, −3.48 and −3.51 eV, respectively, and their HOMOCV levels are −5.00, −5.17, −5.13 and −5.26 eV, respectively. The calculated ECVg are 1.69, 1.78, 1.65 and 1.75 eV respectively determined by the level difference between LUMOCV and HOMOCV. These results demonstrate that all of them in principle can behave as donors in BHJ devices with PC61BM as acceptor. In contrast, the ethynyl-containing materials M3 and M4 possess relatively deeper HOMOCV levels and slightly lower ECVg relative to M1 and M2, which are probably contribute to the improvement of VOC and JSC in BHJ OSCs. Despite the existence of some discrepancies between CV measurement and DFT calculation caused by both intermolecular interaction and solvent effect, the CV experimental data are very important to explain their optical-electronic properties. Furthermore, these results could provide an important guide for better understanding the relationship between molecular structure and property.20

Hole mobility
Hole mobility (μh) is closely related to the PV performance of device, which is a key parameter for donor material design. In order to determine the μh of each material, the J–V curves are obtained in the dark for the hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/OSMs:PC61BM (1:2, w/w)/Au, as shown in Fig. 5. Then by fitting the J–V curves in a double logarithmic scale to a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model according to the Mott–Gurney law, the μh values of these OSMs can be derived: J = (9/8)ε0εrμh(V2/d3), where J is the current density, μh is the hole mobility value, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage.7a,21 As a result, the fitting plots of the data points in the SCLC regime with a slope of 2 are depicted in inset of Fig. 5 and the related data are summarized in Table 2. The μh values of M1, M3, M2 and M4 are 5.12 × 10−6, 6.90 × 10−6, 2.61 × 10−5 and 3.05 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. As reported, the μh of each donor material might be related to the inherent molecular structure, the intermolecular interaction and the film morphology, leading to the difference of the hole transporting property.21a Among them, the μh values of M3 and M4 exhibit about 1.2 times higher than those of M1 and M2, indicating that the introduction of ethynyl-linkage produces a slight effect on their hole mobility. It is worth mentioning that the μh values of M2 and M4 exhibit about 5 times higher than those of M1 and M3, demonstrating that M2 and M4 with fluorene as end-capping group are much favoured structures and possess better hole transporting capacity. These results provide valuable idea on design of new donor materials.

Photovoltaic properties
The energy levels of the components for PV devices are shown in Fig. 6(a). All the materials have the potential to generate sufficient charge separation at interface between OSMs and PC61BM, since their LUMO levels are 0.3 eV higher than that of PC61BM.22 In addition, their deep-lying HOMO levels of M2–M4 would guarantee the relatively higher VOC values relative to the HOMO of M1. Accordingly, four synthesized OSMs in principle can behave as good donors in BHJ OSCs with PC61BM as acceptor. According to the order of HOMO energy levels of these OSMs determined by both theoretical calculation and electrochemical experiment, the order of VOC should be M4 > M2 > M3 > M1, since the VOC of the BHJ device is determined by the energy difference between the HOMO level of donor material and the LUMO level of acceptor. To investigate their PV properties, solution-processed BHJ devices were fabricated with the conventional architecture: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/OSMs:PC61BM (1:2, w/w)/Al, as shown in inset of Fig. 6(b). The related J–V characteristics for the devices are shown in Fig. 6(b), and the corresponding PV parameters are summarized in Table 2. As a result, the PV devices based on M1, M3, M2 and M4 show PCEs of 1.48%, 1.99%, 2.23% and 3.10%, respectively. The ascending values of PCEs are in good agreement with their hole mobility properties. Among them, the best PV performance of M4 is primarily attributed to the deep-lying HOMO level and reasonably high hole mobility caused by the structural design with ethynyl-linkage and fluorene end-capping group. In addition, compounds M3 and M4 based devices exhibit the VOC of 0.84 V and 0.98 V, whereas their non-ethynyl analogues M1 and M2 based devices show the VOC of 0.49 V and 0.89 V, respectively. It is interesting to find that the VOC of M3 and M4 are 0.35 V and 0.09 V higher than that of M1 and M2, respectively. The relatively higher VOC values of M3 and M4 are proportional to their deep-lying HOMO levels caused by the ethynyl-linkage with electron-withdrawing effect, thus increasing their oxidation potential. Moreover, M3 and M4 give rise to the increased JSC of 7.67 mA cm−2 and 9.04 mA cm−2, whereas their counterparts M1 and M2 based devices show 6.60 mA cm−2 and 7.17 mA cm−2, respectively. It is clearly to note that the JSC of M3 and M4 are 1–2 mA cm−2 higher than that of M1 and M2, which could be rationally ascribed to their narrow Eg and the increased μh values due to the ethynyl-linkage. However, FF values are so low, which indicated further experiments on device optimization should be done. The series resistance (Rs) and the shunt resistance (Rsh) were calculated, as shown in Table 2. Probably the relatively higher Rs and relatively lower Rsh of compounds (M2, M3 and M4) resulted in the poor FF values directly. Nevertheless, the lower Rs and relatively higher Rsh of M1 resulted in an increased FF value. We believe that the performance could be further improved if the morphology is improved. Anyway, this work provided an important guide for rational design of novel materials with improved PV performance.

The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of these OSMs based devices were obtained as well. As shown in Fig. 7, all devices exhibit significant photon-to-current responses in the range of 300–800 nm. The maximum IPCE of M1, M2, M3 and M4 are 15.9%, 28.5%, 29.9% and 34.9% at around 350 nm, 9.4%, 30.6%, 29.8% and 32.6% at around 420 nm and 6.8%, 25.1%, 21.8% and 26.8% at around 600 nm, respectively, which are consistent with their UV-Vis absorption profiles. In contrast, the IPCE spectra of ethynyl-containing compounds M3 and M4 become broader and higher relative to their non-ethynyl counterparts M1 and M2, which is in agreement with their trends of PV performance.

Conclusions
In summary, two novel DPP-based OSM donors, M3 and M4 with ethynyl-linkage have been synthesized successfully and applied in solution-processed BHJ OSCs. To investigate the triple-bond effect, their corresponding counterparts, M1 and M2 with single-bond-linkage were designed and synthesized as well. In contrast, the ethynyl-linkage structural design could not only lower the HOMO levels, but also delicately balance the relationship between the deep-lying HOMO and narrow Eg, thus improving the PV performance. Accordingly, M3 and M4 based devices exhibit the increased VOC of 0.84 V and 0.98 V, with the enhanced PCE of 1.99% and 3.10%, respectively. Whereas M1 and M2 based devices show the VOC of 0.46 V and 0.89 V, with the PCE of 1.48% and 2.23%, respectively. The best PV performance of M4 is primarily attributed to the deep-lying HOMO level and reasonably high μh caused by the structural design with ethynyl-linkage and fluorene end-capping group. As a conclusion, incorporating the ethynyl-linkage into the D–π–A–π–D-typed OSMs contributed to the improvement of PV performance. This work provided an important guide for rational design of novel PV materials. Further experiments on device optimization are underway in our laboratory.
