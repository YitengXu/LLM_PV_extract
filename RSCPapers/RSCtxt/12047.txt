Organic ammonia ethanolamine was used as the reductant to adjust the valence of CuOx. Meanwhile, the bulk g-C3N4 was efficiently exfoliated into ultrathin nanoplates during the synthesis process. It is found that the different contents of g-C3N4 can effectively accelerate the valence transition of Cu in the nanocrystals. That is, the successive appearance of CuO and Cu2O with the enhancement of g-C3N4 content. These heterostructured composites were characterized for structural, morphological, elemental distribution, optical properties, specific surface area and photo-generated carrier separation efficiency by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. The photocatalytic performance investigations indicate that the CN5–CuOx is stable enough and shows a remarkable photocatalytic efficiency for degrading methyl orange (MO) under simulated sunlight irradiation, compared with the pure CuOx nanocrystals. The enhanced photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the enlarged surface area, beneficial heterojunction among Cu2O@g-C3N4 and efficient carrier separation efficiency. The abundant Cu substrate in the CuOx nanocrystals functions as a rapid electron/hole pair transfer avenue and inhibits their recombination. Thus the photocatalytic efficiency is tremendously enhanced.
Introduction
With the development of global industrialization, environmental pollution from organic pollutants and toxic waste water has become a universal problem.1 Many researchers have made efforts on photocatalytic pollutant degradation by using abundant solar energy. During the past decades, many photocatalysts have been successfully prepared, such as TiO2, Cu2O, CdS, etc.2–4 Regretfully, many drawbacks have greatly limited their photocatalytic efficiency and further practical application, such as exorbitant price, poor light adsorption ability, fast recombination rate of photo-generated carriers, or being highly toxic for human health and harmful to the environment.5,6 Thus, it is highly desirable to develop photocatalysts that are cheaper, have lower toxicity, a wider light adsorption range and higher separation efficiency.7
Copper oxides (CuO and Cu2O), two environmentally friendly semiconductors with narrow band gaps, have been widely used in pollution governance due to high chemical stability and excellent photoelectric properties.8 Numerous CuxO nanostructures, including nanoparticles, nanorods, nanoribbons, nanofilms, nanoplates, nanocubes, octahedra, nanospheres, nanocages, hollow microspheres and hierarchical nanostructures, have been successfully prepared by different methods and applied in many fields.9–13 CuO, a hot topic among the studies on transition metallic oxides with a narrow band gap (1.2 eV in bulk), possess superior physical and chemical properties and is widely used in lithium-ion batteries, solar cells, supercapacitors and photocatalysis.14 Focusing on its catalysis performance, this efficiently heterogeneous catalyst is also used in many important chemical processes, such as the degradation of nitrous oxide, selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxide with ammonia, oxidation of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and phenol in supercritical water.15,16 However, the relatively poor photodegradation efficiency restricts its further use in this domain.17 On the contrary, Cu2O has excited the unprecedented research interests and been extensively applied in photocatalysis because of the narrow band gap (2.0 eV in bulk) and superior photoelectrochemical properties. There are lots of studies presented each year, involving in designing the shape-controlled with different synthetic method or structure-directing agent, functioning with inorganic/organic semiconductor materials, loading with various noble metals.18,19 However, the large-scale application of these two semiconductor materials is still restricted by the complex preparation process to fabricate shape-controlled nanostructures with large specific surface area and high photo-generated carrier separation efficiency. It is well known that the bi-component often displays better properties than those of the single component due to the bi-component composite integrating two types of functional materials.20 Hence, designing multi-component CuOx photocatalyst has become a burning question to overcome the inherent imperfections.
The usage of g-C3N4 in photocatalytic decomposition of water into hydrogen by Wang's group is a landmark in the preparation of photocatalyst and has initiated worldwide attention. This metal-free polymer semiconductor shows good visible light absorption property (Eg = 2.7 eV) and photocatalytic stability, which was demonstrated under light irradiation in water solution as well as in acid or base solution due to the strong covalent bonds between carbon and nitride atoms.21–23 Compared with the common TiO2, metallic oxides or metal sulfides, layered g-C3N4 should be a good candidate for photocatalytic solar conversion because of low cost, nontoxicity, visible light activity and simple synthetic process.24 However, the fast recombination of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs greatly reduced the photocatalytic efficiency of pure g-C3N4. Many methods have been applied to further advance this promising photocatalytic material, containing doping metal/nonmetal elements to adjust its energy band structure,25,26 coupling with semiconductors to form heterojunction27,28 and exfoliating bulk to build multi-dimensionally shape-controlled materials.29,30
In this work, we successfully prepared a series of heterostructured g-C3N4/CuOx composites via a mixed solvent-thermal method to facilitate the photocatalytic activity.31 Using ethanolamine–water as the mixed solvent, the valence transition of CuOx was ultimately fulfilled with various addition contents of g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the g-C3N4 was drastically exfoliated into ultrathin nanoplates and covers the surface of CuOx composites. The appropriate content of g-C3N4 would result in the appearance of Cu2O nanostructure. This interesting phenomenon that the valence transition process of copper oxides controlled by the content of g-C3N4 was not mentioned in the previous studies. The degradation of MO solution under simulated light irradiation indicates that the CN5/CuOx nanocomposites is enough stable and possesses the best photocatalytic performance than those of others, due to the large surface area and efficient photo-generated electron–hole separation efficiency.
Experimental
Materials and synthesis
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was prepared by directly heating melamine under air atmosphere. Typically, 5 g of melamine power was put into four semi-closed porcelain crucible, then heated the temperature of muffle furnace to reach 500 °C and tempered for 2 h. It was followed that the temperature was lowered to room temperature. The resulting cakes were ground into powder with a mortal. Once again, the resulting powder was placed in the original porcelain crucible and heated to 520 °C for another 2 h. The final products were collected and milled into powder.
Synthesis protonated g-C3N4/CuOx nanocomposites
The g-C3N4/CuOx nanocomposites were synthesized by a mixed solvothermal route. Typically, a certain amount of g-C3N4 was dispersed in 80 mL of aqueous solution (containing 20 mL ethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, EA) and 60 mL distilled water) for 30 min to form a uniform dispersion under sonication. Then, 10 mmol Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was added into the above formed solution and the color of solution turns into navy-blue under constant stirring. Finally, the formed homogeneous solution was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave with a Teflon liner of 100 mL capacity, and heated in an oven at 200 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was centrifuged, rinsed with distilled water and absolute ethylalcohol for three times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 6 h. The as-obtained samples were named as CuOx, 0.1 g g-C3N4/CuOx, 0.2 g g-C3N4/CuOx, 0.25 g g-C3N4/CuOx, 0.5 g g-C3N4/CuOx, 0.75 g g-C3N4/CuOx and 1.0 g g-C3N4/CuOx, which were labeled as CuOx, CN1/CuOx, CN2/CuOx, CN2.5/CuOx, CN5/CuOx, CN7.5/CuOx and CN10/CuOx, respectively. Moreover, several comparing experiments were conducted under the same conditions. The CN5/CuOx–EG and CN5/CuOx–EDA were prepared by the replace of organic solvent in initially aqueous solution. Besides, a sample that expands the dosage of ethanolamine was also synthesized and donated as CN5/CuOx–2EA.
Materials characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the prepared materials were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer D/MAX-2200/PC equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 20 mA). The morphologies of the products were observed by using a JSM-6701F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; Germany) and a JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope (TEM; Japan). The structural information of the samples was obtained using a Fourier transform spectrophotometer (FT-IR, Vertex 70, Bruker) with KBr as the reference sample. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3100 spectrophotometer. The reflectance spectra were transformed to absorption intensity by using the Kubelka–Munk method. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were collected at 77 K on a TriStar II3020 system. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of samples were measured with a fluoro spectrometer (PE, LS-55) from 350 to 480 nm at room temperature under excitation at 260 nm. Photocurrent responses were conducted in a three-electrode quartz cell with 0.5 M Na2SO4 as electrolyte solution. Platinum plate is the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrodes. The power was deposited on FTO to serve as the working electrode. The dates were recorded by the electrochemical system (CHI-650B, China). Chemical state analyses of CN5/CuOx were performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Escalab 210 system, Germany) with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (Thermo VG Scientific).
Measurement of photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic degradation experiments were carried out with a photocatalytic reaction apparatus (XPA-G6) using a 350 W Xe lamp as light source. The reactors were horizontally irradiated and surrounded by water to cool. 10 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in an aqueous solution of MO (50 mL, 20 mg L−1). The suspensions were magnetically stirred in dark for 60 min to completely reach adsorption/desorption equilibrium of MO molecules on the surface of the photocatalysts. Then the mixed solution was irradiated and about 5 mL of suspensions were taken continually from the reaction cell at 10 min intervals for subsequent target dye concentration analysis after centrifuging. The degradation efficiencies of MO were evaluated by measuring the concentration of a centrifuged MO solution at 465 nm using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (TU-1901, Beijing Pgeneral).
Recycling experiments test
The recycling experiments for photodegradation of MO solution by CN5–CuOx sample is the same with that of photocatalytic activity measurements, the only difference is that after each cycle, all the used photocatalyst was collected and washed with ethanol–water mixed solvent, then centrifuged and dried at 80 °C for 6 h in a vacuum oven and weighted. The photocatalyst mentioned above was dispersed into fresh MO solution and cycled for three times, totally.
Active species trapping experiments
To further confirm the main reactive radical species involved in the photocatalytic process, the holes and radicals trapping experiments were conducted by adding various scavengers to the CN5–CuOx sample. In this work, different scavenges of potassium iodide (KI; 1 mmol), isopropyl alcohol (IPA; 1 mmol) and benzoquinone (BQ; 1 mmol) were used as scavenge the holes (h+), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), and superoxide radical anions (˙O2−) species in the photodegradation of MO, respectively. The trapping experiment is similar to that of the photocatalytic degradation of MO solution and the same doses of the scavenger were introduced separately into the MO solutions prior to the addition of the photocatalyst.
Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of all as-prepared samples were recorded to confirm the crystallographic phases of CuOx in the composites and reveal the influence of g-C3N4 on the valence transition of CuOx nanoparticles. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of g-C3N4/CuOx photocatalysts with various contents of g-C3N4. Meanwhile, several comparative experiments were also conducted for detailed disclosing the effects of different solvents with constant g-C3N4 content during the valence transition process of CuOx. As displayed in Fig. 1a–g, ethanolamine was used as the solvent. With the rising of g-C3N4 content, an amazing phenomenon occurs that Cu (0), Cu(I) and Cu(II) appear in succession. The peaks of the Cu phases correspond to the (111), (200) and (220) planes (JCPDS card no. 65-9743). The (002) and (111) planes at 35.7° and 38.5° are assigned to the peaks of CuO phases (JCPDS card no. 45-0937). And the (004) plane belongs to the peaks of Cu2O phases (JCPDS card no. 49-1830). Besides, a weak peak appears at about 27.4° attributed to (002) diffraction for graphitic material in the g-C3N4. It is very obvious that the valance state of partial Cu nanoparticles changes gradually and forms CuO and Cu2O with enhanced usage amount of g-C3N4. However, the peaks of Cu2O phases disappear when further increase the dosage of g-C3N4, due to the thick coating shell. To explore the reason causing such a transformation, the amount of EA was enlarged but keeping the same additive amount of g-C3N4 (Fig. 1e and h). Interestingly, the diffraction peaks of Cu2O phases disappear immediately while that of Cu phases left. As seen in Fig. 1a, the reducing EA could directly and effectively promote the transformation of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O into Cu nanoparticles. However, the appearance of g-C3N4 timely disturbs this process and eventually obtains Cu2O nanoparticles. For further investigate the mainly functional groups in EA, EDA and EG was chosen as the sources of –NH2 and –OH (Fig. 1i and j) to replace the solvent in Fig. 1e, respectively. Obviously, only Cu peaks are still kept and no any peaks of CuO or Cu2O could be detected in the solvent of EDA. On the contrary, a sharp C peak appears at 2θ = 23.0° and corresponds to amorphous carbon (JCPDS card no. 50-0926) in the solvent of EG. Meanwhile, the reappeared peaks at about 27.7° and 36.3° are ascribed to g-C3N4 and Cu2O, respectively. But there is no obvious peak of Cu phase reappearing. The series of evidences may indicate that g-C3N4 could work with –OH in EA and weaken its reducing ability, which prevents the Cu(II) from being completely reduced and results from the appearance of CuO and Cu2O phases in the composites.

Fig. 2a–f displays the morphology of g-C3N4/CuOx composites by SEM analysis. The pure CuOx sample shows that the composite with porously superficial morphology are composed by irregular lumps without the appearance of tiny and agglomerated nanoparticles. And the basic morphology of as-prepared g-C3N4/CuOx composites is consistent with pure CuOx. But it is no doubt that some minor differences still exist with the variable addition content of g-C3N4. The surface pores of as-prepared photocatalysts expand gradually. Meanwhile, some small flower-like micro-structures are growing and eventually cover the entire surface, which are identified as Cu2O phases and further demonstrated by the later characterization methods. The appearance of Cu2O nanoparticles not only increases the specific surface area of composite but also promotes the form of the Schottky junction with copper base, thus the separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons and holes is accelerated and promotes the photocatalytic performance of composites. Of course, these results will be detailed discussed. No surprising that the trace of g-C3N4 cannot be found from SEM images due to the transparent solution obtained by individually adding it into the ethanolamine–water (EAW) mixed solution, but can be observed from TEM images. As shown in Fig. S1,† the surface of composites become blurred and covered with a thick film after further enhancing the dosages of g-C3N4, which may mean that the g-C3N4 has totally packaged the CuOx nanocrystals. This is the direct reason why the Cu2O nanoparticles disappear on the surface of CN7.5/CuOx and CN10/CuOx, comparing with CN5/CuOx.

The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and elemental mapping are the two significant representatives to confirm the existence and distribution of g-C3N4 in the composites. As shown in Fig. 3, it is clear that the bulk g-C3N4 has been fully exfoliated into ultrathin nanoplates and well distributed on the surface of CuOx. Simultaneously, the peaks of Cu, O, C, N origin from g-C3N4/CuOx composites, which directly certificates that the g-C3N4 still exists in the as-prepared samples and uniformly disperses on the surface of CuOx. The peak of Al comes from the aluminium-foil paper. The peak of Au is from the sprayed gold during sample preparation process. And there is no any impure peaks appearing.

To further show that the g-C3N4 and CuOx have well combined, the TEM and HRTEM are used. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the CuOx nanoparticles were covered with the resulting ultrathin g-C3N4 nanoplatelets. Meanwhile, the abundant ultrathin nanoplates confirm the existence of g-C3N4. The as-observed lattice fringes in Fig. 4c correspond to g-C3N4 (d = 0.265 nm) and Cu2O (d = 0.247 nm), respectively. And there is no clues corresponding to CuO or Cu phase. Obviously, a distinct heterojunction has formed and combined g-C3N4 and Cu2O together. Thus, a direct and powerful evidence of as-formed g-C3N4/CuOx composites is presented. Besides, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of CN5/CuOx in Fig. 4d indicates that composite belongs to polycrystalline.32

FT-IR spectroscopy was used to investigate interactions between g-C3N4 and EA for the resulting transparent solution without adding Cu source. As shown in Fig. 5a, the broad absorption band at 3100–3300 cm−1 belongs to the stretching vibration modes of NH2 and NH and their intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions.33 The several peaks at 1200–1650 cm−1 correspond to the typical aromatic carbon nitride heterocycles.34–36 And the steep peak at 801 cm−1 can be indexed to the out-of-plane bending modes of s-triazine ring mode.37,38 Fig. 5b shows two absorption peaks at 3353 and 3297 cm−1 can be attributed to the asymmetric and the symmetric stretch of NH2 groups in ethanolamine. The bands at 2936 and 2871 cm−1 are the asymmetric CH2 stretch and the symmetric CH2 stretch. The peaks at 1575 cm−1 and 1483 cm−1 indicate a coupling of C–N stretching and in-plane bending of NH groups, respectively. And the C–O stretching vibration is located at 1071 cm−1.39 It is very clear that the peak of s-triazine ring modes in g-C3N4 was weakened after disposing in EA (Fig. 5c), which may be caused by the hydrogen-bond interaction between g-C3N4 and EA thus exfoliating the bulk g-C3N4 to form smaller and thinner nanosheets. This adequately gives the reasonable explanation why the g-C3N4 changes into transparent solution and no precipitate could be obtained after high speed centrifugation for a long period but detected by XRD analysis and HRTEM images.

In the formation process of CuOx nanocrystals, EA was regarded as both precipitating agent and reductant at the same time. There were only pure Cu phases obtained without addition of g-C3N4. In this process, [Cu(NH3)4]2+ and [Cu(OH)4]2+ were competitively coexisting (eqn (1) and (4)). The [Cu(NH3)4]2+ would change into elemental copper because of the reducing action of aldehyde produced from the alcoholic hydroxyl in EA, eventually (eqn (3)). After a series of complex reactions (eqn (4)–(7)), the generated [Cu(OH)4]2+ would ultimately change into Cu2O. However, the freshly generated Cu2O could further react with the ammonia solution, generating in eqn (3), and finally turn into [Cu(NH3)4]2+ again. When the EA was replaced by an equivalent amount of EDA and EG under the constant hydrothermal conditions, only Cu and Cu2O were obtained (Fig. 1g and h), respectively. However, the introduction of g-C3N4 could effectively improve these procedures and control the reactions proceeding, achieving phase transformation of Cu(0) to Cu(I) and Cu(II). This is due to the formation of hydrogen-bond between g-C3N4 and the amidogen in EA, which successfully prevents the occurrence of eqn (1). So that the alcoholic hydroxyl group in EA fully combines with Cu2+ to form [Cu(OH)4]2+, a typically planar square complex causing by the Jahn–Teller effect.40 Specifically, the reactions (1) to (3) would be gradually prevented with the rising of g-C3N4 content, which are benefit for the generation of Cu2O. Meanwhile, the eqn (8) that Cu2O turned into [Cu(NH3)4]2+ in the ammonia solution would cease without delay. The above discussion results consistent with the XRD patterns and FT-IR spectrum.31,41,42

Fig. 6 shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of the prepared pure g-C3N4, CuOx and their composites. It can be seen that both g-C3N4 and CuOx exhibit strong absorbance capacity in the visible region. It is noteworthy that a broad absorption peak around 285 nm can be observed in CuOx and its composites. Besides, a broad absorption band from 250 to 800 nm was also presented. The phenomena should be attributed to the coexistence of CuO and Cu2O bi-components, which consistent with the discussion results of XRD and SEM images.43 After combining the two semiconductors, the g-C3N4/CuOx composites show remarkably increased absorptions within the visible light range and appear a red shift in comparison with bulk g-C3N4 and CuOx. And the absorption intensity of g-C3N4/CuOx composites also increases with increasing g-C3N4 content. However, the absorbance range of CN5–CuOx presents a distinct decrease because of the weaker absorbance capacity of g-C3N4 in higher wavelength range. Besides, the CuO in the composite has completely transformed into Cu2O with the increasing of g-C3N4 content. Considering the relative weaker optical absorptivity of Cu2O than that of CuO, demonstrating in previous work,44 it is natural that the absorbance range and intensity of CN5–CuOx remarkably decrease. The band gap of CN5–CuOx is estimated and shown in Fig. S2.† The CN5–CuOx composites exhibited strong photo-adsorption in the visible region with the corresponding band gap energy at 1.61 eV. The lower band gap is beneficial to the photon excitation from its valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB), thus the migration process of photo-generated carriers is efficiently accelerated and photocatalytic activity is greatly promoted.

The BET surface area of the g-C3N4/CuOx composites and CuOx sample were investigated by using nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements and shown in Fig. 7. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for the aforementioned samples are type IV (Brunauer–Deming–Deming–Teller (BDDT) classification), indicating the presence of mesopores. Meanwhile, these isotherms exhibit H3 hysteresis loops reflecting slit pores formed due to the aggregation or accumulation of the irregular flake nanoparticles. The above results correspond to the SEM analysis (Fig. 2). The isotherms for all samples above show high adsorption at relative pressures (P/P0) approaching 1.0, suggesting the formation of large mesopores and slit pores. The specific surface areas of all samples are 1.58 m2 g−1, 4.69 m2 g−1, 7.73 m2 g−1, 15.03 m2 g−1 and 29.84 m2 g−1, respectively. It is very interesting to find that the specific surface areas of as-prepared samples increase with the enhanced g-C3N4 content. Undoubtedly, a photocatalyst with a larger specific surface area can accommodate more surface active sites and facilitate the transport of charge carriers, which is beneficial for enhancing the photocatalytic performance.

To better investigate the separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs, the transient photocurrent responses of the CuOx, 0.5 g C3N4/CuOx and bulk g-C3N4 were measured in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution under stimulated sunlight irradiation.45 As shown in Fig. 8a, the photocurrent responses intensity of CN5–CuOx composites is higher than that of CuOx and bulk g-C3N4, which means a more convenient pathway for photo-generated carrier separation and implies that it is more active in the degradation of organic dyes under the stimulated sunlight irradiation. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was used to estimate the recombination rate of photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the samples. Fig. 8b displays the PL spectrum of CuOx, 0.5 g C3N4/CuOx and bulk g-C3N4 samples excited at the light wavelength of 260 nm. The 0.5 g C3N4/CuOx presented the lowest intensity of the maximum emission peak at around 400 nm, which indicate that the recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs may have been effectively restrained. The difference of the maximum emission peak between bulk g-C3N4 and 0.5 g C3N4/CuOx may be caused by the mixed solvothermal process.

The XPS was used to determine the chemical composition of the CN5–CuOx for the fresh and used samples (Fig. 9 and S3†). The whole XPS spectrum is indexed to Fig. S3,† indicating the presence of C, N, Cu and O in the CN5–CuOx composites. As seen from Fig. 9a, the peaks intensity of Cu2O at 932.4 eV and 952.2 eV gradually decrease while that of CuO at 933.8 eV and 953.9 eV increase slightly, which means the Cu2O could be reduced into CuO during the photocatalytic process without further protective measures. The two peaks at 284.8 eV and 288.2 eV of C 1s in Fig. 9b are assigned to sp2 C–C bonds and sp-bonded carbon in N-containing aromatic rings (N–CN), which belong to the major carbon species in the g-C3N4. The related binding energies of N 1s spectrum locating at 398.8 eV and 400.0 eV correspond to the sp2-bonded N involved in the triazine rings (C–NC) in g-C3N4 and the tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3 groups, respectively.46 The obviously decreasing peaks of C 1s and N 1s at 288.2 eV and 400.0 eV might be caused by the loss of the ultrathin g-C3N4 film, which is also the prime cause that valence states of copper oxides change during the photocatalytic process for the weakening of protection.

The photocatalytic activities of as-synthesized g-C3N4/CuOx composites were measured by the degradation of MO in water under stimulated sunlight irradiation and shown in Fig. 10. In order to eliminate photosensitization, the direct photolysis of MO in the absence of the photocatalyst was tested under the same conditions. As seen in Fig. 10a and c, the direct photolysis of MO from the blank experiment could almost be neglected. Obviously, the samples have reached adsorption equilibrium after stirred for 30 min in dark (Fig. 10a). After 70 min irradiation, only 16.7% of MO is left with CN5–CuOx composites, but 34.0%, 30.1%, 36.8%, 54.8%, 62.4%, 82.5%, 57.7% for CN10–CuOx, CN7.5–CuOx, CN2–CuOx, CN1–CuOx, CuOx composites and bulk g-C3N4, respectively. The CN5–CuOx composites have better performance over the others. The spectrum scanning of degrading MO with CN5–CuOx composites is shown in Fig. 10b, the maximum of adsorption wavelength of MO at 465 nm is gradually decreasing with the change of irradiation time. Controlling the initial concentration of dye at lower level, the degradation of dyes molecule can be described by an apparent first-order equation with a simplified Langmuir–Hinshelwood model: ln(C0/Ct) = kt, where C0 is the initial concentration of dye, Ct is the concentration of the dye, k is the apparent first-order rate constant, and t is the illumination time.47 As shown in Fig. 10c, the apparent rate constants k is 7.50 × 10−3 min−1, 1.04 × 10−2 min−1, 1.40 × 10−2 min−1, 2.05 × 10−2 min−1, 1.50 × 10−2 min−1, 1.38 × 10−2 min−1 and 5.94 × 10−3 min−1 for CN1–CuOx, CN2–CuOx, CN2.5–CuOx, CN5–CuOx, CN7.5–CuOx, CN10–CuOx composites and bulk g-C3N4, respectively, compared to 6.29 × 10−4 min−1 for CuOx. Therefore, photocatalytic activity of CuOx nanoparticles was effectively improved by compounded with ultrathin g-C3N4 nanoplates. And the relevant kinetic rate constants are intuitively presented by histogram. As shown in Fig. 10d, the CN5–CuOx composites possess the optimum activity among all the samples. Its apparent rate constant is about 3.45, 1.49, 1.37, 1.47, 1.97, 2.74 and 32.68 times as high as those of bulk g-C3N4, CN10–CuOx, CN7.5–CuOx, CN2.5–CuOx, CN2–CuOx, CN1–CuOx and CuOx, respectively. Considering the above discussion results in XRD patterns (Fig. 1), SEM images (Fig. 2d–f, S1a–b†) and TEM analysis (Fig. 4c), it is clear that the enhancement of stimulated sunlight photocatalytic activity of CN5–CuOx composites should be attributed to the more reliable interfacial interaction of g-C3N4 and CuOx.

Fig. 11 shows the sustainable photocatalytic performance of CN5–CuOx sample and the degradation efficiency decreased about 3.5% after three cycles for the photo-decomposition of MO solution. The results indicate the CN5–CuOx composites exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity and high stability, which can be a potential and promising photocatalyst for photo-decomposition organic pollution and other applications.

To ascertain the main active species involved in the photocatalytic reaction and further clarify the mechanism, the holes and radicals trapping experiments were conducted by adding various scavengers to the CN5–CuOx sample. The holes (h+), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and superoxide radical anions (˙O2−) were scavenged by potassium iodide (KI), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and benzoquinone (BQ), respectively.48 The dosages consult previous works. As shown in Fig. S4,† the degradation efficiency of MO was clearly restrained with addition of KI (1 mmol) and BQ (1 mmol) than that of no scavenger, while IPA (1 mmol) showed negligible effect on the organic contaminant. These results demonstrate that both h+ and ˙O2− maybe function as the main active species in the photocatalytic degradation of MO by CN5–CuOx composites under simulated sunlight irradiation.
The greatly improved photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/CuOx heterogeneous nanostructure composites compared to the sole CuOx nanocrystals may be attributed to the formation of heterojunction between g-C3N4 and Cu2O, originating from CN5–CuOx. According to the previous reports, the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) potentials of the Cu2O semiconductor are −1.4 eV and +0.6 eV, respectively. The CB and VB potentials of the g-C3N4 semiconductor are −1.13 eV and +1.57 eV, respectively. Thus, the energy-band schematic diagram for CuOx and g-C3N4 is displayed in Fig. 12. The close contact of CuOx and g-C3N4 will spontaneously adjust their conduction and valence bands position to make each Fermi level reach an equilibrium state. Meanwhile, an inner electric field from Cu2O and g-C3N4 is established. The plasmon response of abundant Cu metal substrate, an electrical conductor with excellent performance, make it acting as the bridge to connect them together and provide a pathway for the charge carriers to substantially reduce their recombination because of its relative low resistance. And the metal Cu substrate is electron storage center benefits to improving the charge separation efficiency of photocatalyst. Besides, the plasmon-excited Cu metal is conductive to photocatalytic property of CN5–CuOx.49 Hence, the photo-generated electrons in the CB of Cu2O will smoothly transfer to that of g-C3N4, while the photo-generated holes in the VB of g-C3N4 will fleetly migrate to that of Cu2O through the Cu substrate. And the high-efficiency migration of photo-generated carriers can be ascribed to the internally formed electric field. At last, the separated electrons and holes voluntarily react with the dissolved O2 and H2O to produce the relevant radicals, resulting further reactions and leading to an enhanced photocatalytic activity.

Conclusions
The g-C3N4/CuOx photocatalysts with varied g-C3N4 contents were successfully prepared by a mixed solvent-thermal method. It is found that the different addition amounts of g-C3N4 are favor of the valence transition of CuOx. Specifically, there is only elementary Cu generating without adding g-C3N4. After the introduction of g-C3N4, Cu (0), Cu(I) and Cu(II) appear one by one. It is very obvious that the CuOx is covered with abundant Cu2O nanoparticles in CN5–CuOx composites. As a result, the photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MO over CN5–CuOx composites under stimulated sunlight irradiation was greatly improved comparing with that of the others. The degradation rate was improved from 17.5% (CuOx) to 83.3% (CN5–CuOx) by photoactivity enhancement up to ∼62.5%. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of CN5–CuOx composites contributes to the appearance of Cu2O. Besides, the Cu substrate functions as an efficient electron transmission channel, promoting the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes pairs and reducing their recombination. The high-stability CN5–CuOx composites may have more extensive application in other fields.
