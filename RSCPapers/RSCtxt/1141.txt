    , Accepted 13th December 2016First published on 13th December 2016AbstractThe efficiency of perovskite solar cells based on mesoscopic TiO2 has been soaring over the past three years and is expected to reach over 25% by engineering the composition of perovskite and interface layers. Efforts to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of planar junction perovskite solar cells have been made from different perspectives. For the first time, we use the wormhole-like hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) to modify the substrate surface inside the planar junction perovskite solar cell to improve efficiency. The formed random islands of HMS decreased the loading of the perovskite layer, leading to abnormal growth of perovskite and increased light path length. Using HMS islands in a planar heterojunction device, we realized an average PCE of 17.6% over 30 devices, which is higher than that of the controlled intrinsic planar heterojunction device (15.85%).
Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) energy promises to meet global energy demands if humans can fully make use of the solar irradiation onto earth. The need for a vast area for installation of solar panels and the costs of terrain surface, supporting wares, weathering protection, and mechanical enforcements contribute to a large fraction of solar energy costs. Represented by the recently announced solar roof made of glass tiles by Tesla, the integration of PV elements directly into the infrastructure (BIPV) is the direction of development of large-scale application PV devices, since all the surrounding costs of the PV elements will be shared by the infrastructure itself, e.g. windows, walls, roof, and automotive shells. Organolead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undergone rapid progress,1–3 with efficiencies competing with those of polycrystalline silicon, and can be potentially used in BIPV components.4 PSCs are constructed by imbedding a polycrystalline layer of an organolead halide perovskite, typically CH3NH3PbI3 or its mixed cation and/or halide variants, between the n-type and p-type charge-selective contacts. Depending on the presence of a mesoporous scaffold, PSCs can be either a mesoporous device or a planar heterojunction device. The mesoporous scaffolds include semiconductive metal oxides (e.g. TiO2, SnO2, ZnO and NiO)5–8 and insulating metal oxide nanoparticles (e.g. Al2O3, ZrO2 and SiO2).9–11 Although the insulating nanoparticles do not directly participate in the free carrier transport process, they influence the morphology and therefore the device performance profoundly.
Contrasted with the research on Al2O3 and ZrO2-based insulating scaffolds, studies on SiO2 are fewer. Jang and his colleagues reported the use of size-controlled SiO2 nanoparticles as scaffolds in PSCs in 2014 and demonstrated a maximum PCE of 11.45% based on SiO2 with particle size of 50 nm.11 Later, the same group used SiO2/TiO2 hollow nanoparticles as scaffold and realized an optimum PCE of 14.7%.12 When they used mesoporous SiO2 nanorods, a maximum PCE of 13.9% was achieved.13 Very recently, Zou and colleagues tried to use SiO2 nanoparticles as an alternative to mesoporous Al2O3 scaffolds and achieved a PCE of up to 16.2%.14 They found that the hysteresis for SiO2-based perovskite solar cells is less severe than for Al2O3-based perovskite solar cells. Mesoporous SiO2 has also been used in monolithic perovskite devices. Zhao and colleagues reported a hole transport material-free perovskite solar cell with carbon electrode and with SiO2 layer as the spacer between TiO2 and carbon.15 They reported a perovskite solar cell with superior PCE of ∼12% under optimized SiO2 thickness. SiO2 nanoparticles have also been used to form photonic crystals with TiO2 to exhibit well-defined reflectance bands for aesthetically attractive perovskite solar cells.
Hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) with wormhole-like mesoporous structure was reported by Tanev and Pinnavaia in 1995 for the first time and was used as an ideal support for adsorbents.16 It was found that HMS has one of the largest specific surface areas and pore volumes among the mesoporous silica materials.17 However, the small pore size (about 3 nm) of HMS18 may impede its application as a uniform and continuous scaffold because this pore size limits the infiltration of perovskite precursor solution and shrinks the crystal size of perovskite. In this report, we applied the HMS with an island morphology on top of the compact TiO2 electron-blocking layer to control the loading and crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Different from the recently reported method by Heo et al.,19 we obtain perovskite film with inverted island morphology without the need for polymer protection. A light-trapping effect was also observed after the inclusion of HMS islands. With HMS islands in a planar heterojunction device, we realized an average PCE of 17.6% over 30 devices, which is 11% higher than the controlled planar heterojunction device (15.85%), due to the synergistic enhancement in JSC, VOC and fill factor (FF).
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a and S1,† the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicate that the calcined HMS with highly porous surface has a particle size of approximately 70 nm, which aggregate to form clusters. The HMS, with island morphology on top of a compact TiO2, was deposited by spin-coating HMS paste ethanol solution, followed by calcination on a hot plate. The as-formed morphology can be seen from the secondary electron scanning electron microscope (SEM) image in Fig. 1b. These islands have a size distribution from 100 nm to 400 nm and locate randomly but evenly on the surface.

To check the impact of the HMS islands on the film morphology, we collected SEM images of the film surface after spin deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution and annealing at 100 °C for 20 min (Fig. 1c and d). The two films formed completely different types of morphology, besides the uncovered HMS islands in Fig. 1d. SEM image of perovskite film on compact TiO2 shows that the average grain size is around 300 nm (Fig. 1c). In the presence of HMS islands (Fig. 1d), the crystal grains are distorted, and the distribution of grain size becomes broader. In other words, HMS islands change the crystallization behaviour of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite significantly. Such kind of abnormal crystal growth has been observed by Dong et al. in a multi-cycle solution-coating process.20 SEM images of perovskite films show that the average grain sizes are 208 and 265 nm with and without HMS islands, respectively. Also, a larger size distribution in the film with HMS is observed (see statistical distribution in Fig. S4†).
In order to investigate the influence of the HMS islands on the crystal structure of the perovskite films behind the SEM images, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected from perovskite films with and without HMS islands on compact TiO2 substrates. The XRD spectra in Fig. 1e show that the perovskite grown on HMS islands mimics the case without HMS islands. However, it is noticeable that the intensity of the peak (211) relative to the intensity of the (110) peak (Fig. S2†) is significantly larger in the film with HMS islands, compared to the film without HMS islands. Moreover, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) peak is larger in the film with HMS islands (Fig. S2†). These data indicate that the preferential growth of (110) crystal planes parallel to the substrate is inhibited in the presence of HMS islands. The increased (FWHM) of the (110) peak suggests decreased crystal size inside the HMS islands, which is compatible with the small pore size of this material.
A schematic image for the device architecture of the HMS island-containing perovskite solar cell is shown in Fig. 2a. The perovskite layer infiltrates inside and between the islands to form an interpenetrated structure. Thus, the HMS islands not only function as a scaffold but also decrease the loading of perovskite in a unit area, since there is no significant capping layer to cover all the islands (vide infra). Upon illumination, the electrons and holes generated in the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer are transported into the TiO2 electron contact and spiro-OMeTAD hole contact, respectively (Fig. 2b). Due to the inert nature of SiO2, photo-generated electrons and holes pass through only the perovskite phase. In this case, although the uncovered HMS islands may contact with the spiro-OMeTAD, it will not lead to electron–hole recombination pathway and device efficiency deterioration.

Fig. 3a shows UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the spin-deposited CH3NH3PbI3 films on FTO/c-TiO2 with and without HMS islands. The absorption spectra of the perovskite film on the substrate with HMS islands show significant blue shifting and weakened absorbance compared to that on a smooth c-TiO2. This can be understood by the minimized crystal size and decreased perovskite loading due to the HMS islands, as indicated by the SEM images and XRD analysis. Due to these effects, a higher transmittance is expected with the perovskite film embedding the HMS islands (see Fig. 1 and S3†). The PL spectra of the two films exhibit little difference in intensity, but the film on HMS is blue shifted and in agreement with the absorption spectrum.

Excitation at λexc = 460 nm, excitation density of 1 nJ cm−2. All the samples have been encapsulated to prevent degradation or any oxygen/moisture-induced effects. Solid lines represent the fitting curve resulting from monoexponential fitting in the form of y = A1exp(−x/t1) + y0. The table with the fitting parameters is in the inset. 
The charge transfer dynamics of the perovskite layer with and without HMS islands are investigated by time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements, as shown in Fig. 3b. The signal was collected at 760 nm, at which the perovskite layer emits. To show the influence of HMS islands, the PL spectra of the specific film was illuminated from both sides. Due to the fact that all the perovskite films have direct contact with c-TiO2, the PL signals all show short lifetime constants (τ) after mono-exponential fitting.13 The emission of the perovskite on HMS-free c-TiO2 shows the longest τ (18.1 ns) due to the largest crystal size. The PL signal from the perovskite with HMS and illuminated from the perovskite side shows slightly decreased τ (17.5 ns), and when the same film was excited from the substrate side, an even smaller τ was calculated (16.3 ns). This can be explained by the constrained crystal size inside the HMS islands and especially on the bottom of these islands, which is in agreement with previous reports.21,22
Besides the increased transmittance, we further fabricated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by depositing spiro-OMeTAD as hole-transporting material and gold electrode on top to examine the effect of HMS islands. The typical device configuration is a planar junction device with or without HMS islands: FTO/c-TiO2/(HMS islands)/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Fig. 4a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of a planar junction device as control cell, from which the clear borders can be seen between different layers. Shown in Fig. 4b is the cross-sectional SEM image of the typical cell with HMS islands on top of c-TiO2. One island with a height of about ∼400 nm was captured in the image. The non-continuous part of the island, with discrete, smaller-sized HMS clusters, is buried under the perovskite layer as indicated by the light green colour. Since the perovskite layer has a thickness of 400–500 nm, the HMS islands were completely covered by the HTM layer and gold.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to understand the kinetics of the photoexcited electrons with and without HMS islands. Fig. S5a† shows Nyquist plots of devices with HMS islands and planar junction at a bias of −1.0 V over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 0.25 MHz in the dark. It was reported that under dark conditions, the main arc at low frequencies is related to recombination resistance (Rrec), which is inversely related to the recombination rate.23,24 The Rrec of the HMS island-containing device was larger than that of the intrinsic planar junction device. This could be related to the pin-hole filling effect of the HMS islands, which reduced the chance of contact between the hole-transporting layer and TiO2. Thus, without reducing electron transfer from perovskite to the TiO2 compact layer, the HMS islands reduced recombination, leading to an increase in VOC and JSC in perovskite solar cells. Fig. S5b† shows Bode plots of the photoelectrodes with and without HMS islands. The peaks of the spectra can be used to determine the electron lifetimes in different parts of the device. The estimated electron lifetimes at the c-TiO2/HMS island/CH3NH3PbI3 interface is about 6.68 μs and 1.98 μs under dark and illumination, respectively, which are longer than those of the planar TiO2 (3.52 μs and 1.75 μs) (Table S1†). This result is in agreement with the higher charge recombination resistance of the HMS samples.
A total of 60 solar cells in two groups were fabricated under the same conditions: one group was prepared with a device structure the same as in Fig. 4a, and the other, the same as in Fig. 4b. A direct comparison of the J–V curves from the best devices of each group measured in the dark and under illumination is shown in Fig. 4c. A significantly improved VOC is measured from the device with HMS islands, possibly due to the reduced recombination in the presence of HMS clusters, which can prevent contact between c-TiO2 and the HTM layer. Slightly increased JSC and FF are also observed with this device. As a result, the top PCE of 17.65% is obtained from the reverse-scanned data of JSC = 20.84 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.11 V and FF = 0.763, compared with the counterpart from the HMS-free group, with JSC of 19.97 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.08 V, FF = 0.742 and PCE of 15.93%. The high VOC of 1.11 V obtained in the presence of HMS islands is encouraging, demonstrating efficiently mitigated recombination. A surprisingly high JSC is also achieved from the same device. This is in contrast to the low UV-vis absorbance of the corresponding perovskite film. It means that the decreased perovskite loading did not decrease the photon-to-current conversion efficiency, but due to the unexpected light management effect (scattering and reflection) of HMS islands, more photons were converted after the deposition of gold. A similar so-called ‘moth eye’ effect has been observed with other types of light-scattering morphologies in organic solar cells, dye sensitized solar cells and PSCs.25–29 Without increasing the thickness of the active layer, this method increases the path length of light in the cell to ensure that all illuminating photons are efficiently absorbed by the perovskite.30 Therefore, this all-around improvement in PV parameters can be attributed to the HMS-induced abnormal growth of the perovskite, which blocked the recombination channel and enhanced photon recycling. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. 4d) of the champion devices as a function of wavelength shows a very broad plateau of over 80% between 400 and 600 nm. In agreement with the J–V measurement, in spite of the decreased perovskite loading, the device with HMS islands showed better photo-to-current response in the wavelength range between 650 and 800 nm (cavity interference region).31 The IPCE of this region is strongly thickness dependent. Since the two devices have the same perovskite thickness, the higher IPCE of the device with HMS islands is due to the increased path length of light.
An evaluation of the J–V hysteresis based on scan direction was conducted as shown in Fig. 4e and Table 1. A much-decreased hysteresis is observed from the device with HMS islands. This can be reflected in the hysteresis index32 calculated based on the ratio between the ηRev/ηFor. The hysteresis index of the HMS island-containing device is calculated to be 1.14, which is smaller than that of the intrinsic planar junction device.

Fig. 4f shows the statistical distribution of all four photovoltaic parameters of the two groups of solar cells, showing the reproducibility of each condition. In the case of the HMS-containing cells, the average values (with standard deviation s.d.) for short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and PCE are 21.55 ± 0.56 mA cm−2, 1.09 ± 0.01 V, 0.75 ± 0.02 and 17.56 ± 0.45%, respectively. As observed in Fig. 4f, all the photovoltaic parameters of the HMS-containing solar cells show higher average values and a similar standard deviation comparing to those of intrinsic planar junction devices (see Table S2†). These data clearly indicate that the presence of HMS islands on the c-TiO2 is a beneficial strategy for improving the performance of the solar cell.
Conclusions
In summary, hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) with wormhole-like mesoporous structure was introduced into planar junction PSCs to improve efficiency. Instead of forming a continuous scaffold layer, the HMS forms random islands on top of a compact TiO2 blocking layer. The islands occupied the space and decreased the loading of the perovskite layer. However, two unexpected effects, including abnormal growth of perovskite and increased light trapping effect, along with the expected pinhole-blocking effect increased the performance of the planar junction PSC. With HMS islands in a planar heterojunction device, we realized an average PCE of 17.6% over 30 devices, which is higher than that of the controlled planar heterojunction device (15.85%).

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) TEM image of the HMS particles, (b) secondary electron scanning electron microscope image of randomly distributed HMS islands on the surface of compact TiO2 (c-TiO2 is invisible under the electron beam due to ultra-low thickness), (c) SEM image of the CH3NH3PbI3 surface of a typical planar heterojunction device, (d) SEM image of CH3NH3PbI3-covered HMS islands (scale bar: 1 μm), (e) XRD patterns of FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite and FTO/c-TiO2/HMS-perovskite.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Schematic illustration of device architecture: FTO/c-TiO2/HMS island/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au; (b) the cell energy level (versus vacuum) diagram.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) UV-vis absorption and CW photoluminescence spectra excited at 500 nm, (b) time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay at 760 nm for the CH3NH3PbI3 film on compact TiO2 (blue square) and c-TiO2/HMS island/CH3NH3PbI3 sample (illumination from perovskite side, red circle; illumination from SiO2 side, orange triangle). Excitation at λexc = 460 nm, excitation density of 1 nJ cm−2. All the samples have been encapsulated to prevent degradation or any oxygen/moisture-induced effects. Solid lines represent the fitting curve resulting from monoexponential fitting in the form of y = A1exp(−x/t1) + y0. The table with the fitting parameters is in the inset.	 

 	Fig. 4  Cross-section SEM images of typical (a) planar heterojunction PSC and (b) PSC with HMS islands (denoted by the light green colour). Layers have been colored for better readability (scale bar: 1 μm). (c) J–V characteristics, (d) IPCE of the PSCs for champion cells, (e) reverse and forward-scanned J–V curves, and (f) statistical deviation of the photovoltaic parameters for (30 different solar cells each) using planar heterojunction with and without HMS islands measured in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 photon flux (AM1.5G).
