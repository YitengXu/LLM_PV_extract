    , Accepted 26th November 2018First published on 27th November 2018AbstractProducing green hydrogen fuel from water is one of the most promising strategies for sustainable and clean energy supply in the future. Seeking for highly efficient, noble-metal-free and stable catalysts for typical electrochemical catalytic (EC), photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photocatalytic (PC) hydrogen production has attracted much attention. In this work, for the first time, we rationally designed and fabricated an innovative class of CdS@Ni3S2 core–shell nanorod arrays (CSNS) on Ni foam. Thanks to the synergistic effect and catalytic role transformation between CdS nanorods and Ni3S2 nanosheets, CSNS was determined to be a new type of multifunctional noble-metal-free catalyst, which exhibited highly stable and efficient H2 production properties in EC, PEC and PC hydrogen production systems. Specifically, with an optimal Ni3S2 shell thickness, CSNS achieved its highest PEC activity with an applied bias photon-to-current conversion efficiency (ABPE) of 7.9% and an extremely high H2 production rate of 112.5 μmol cm−2 min−1. Moreover, a series of inconsistent catalytic behaviors were found during the EC, PEC and PC hydrogen production procedures. By establishing three corresponding charge separation and transfer models, the underlying catalytic mechanisms and the dominant role transformations between CdS and Ni3S2 in these three catalytic systems were systematically investigated. This study provides a new strategy and guidelines for searching for suitable photocatalysts/electrocatalysts and core–shell multifunctional catalysts which can be used in an optional H2 production system.
1. Introduction
To meet the increasing global energy demand and address the environmental pollution issues caused by the consumption of fossil fuels, exploring alternative energy production and conversion systems for renewable and clean energy sources (such as hydrogen energy) has sparked tremendous research attention.1–3 Generating green hydrogen fuel from water has been considered as one of the most promising strategies for sustainable and clean energy supply in the future.4–6 To realize this goal, there are three typical approaches including electrochemical catalytic (EC), photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photocatalytic (PC) water splitting strategies.7–10
Incorporating the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), EC water splitting provides a simple method for mass production of hydrogen fuel.11,12 The key technology in this field is the development of low cost, efficient and stable electrocatalysts that can achieve a high current density at a moderate HER or OER overpotential.13–16 In recent years, in order to reduce the utilization of high cost precious metal electrocatalysts, such as Pt and RuO2, earth-abundant non-noble Ni- and Ni-alloy based electrocatalysts, which are commonly directly grown on nickel foam, have been intensively investigated and exhibited improved EC catalytic performance.17 For example, a number of Ni-based metal phosphides,18–21 sulfides22,23 and selenides24 have been investigated as HER or OER electrocatalysts. In particular, Ni3S2, which can be used as both a HER and an OER electrocatalyst in alkaline electrolysis devices, is extremely attractive, because such bifunctional electrocatalysts can not only simplify the EC water splitting systems, but are also feasible for the industrial application of water splitting technology.25–27 Recently, Feng et al. synthesized Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays on nickel foam, and they proved that these Ni3S2 nanosheets with exposed high-index {210} facets had a large number of reactive sites and could provide enhanced catalytic activity toward both the HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte.12,28 Although significant progress has been made for these Ni3S2 and other Ni-based electrocatalysts, it is very hard to further increase the EC activity due to the limited reactive sites caused by the fixed surface area on Ni foam.29 Therefore, in pursuit of an ideal EC activity, it is highly desirable to fabricate novel nanostructured Ni foam supported electrocatalysts with sufficient active surfaces and fast charge transfer capacity.
Superior to the traditional EC water splitting technology, the power-saving PEC and PC hydrogen generation strategies combined with the inexhaustible supply of solar energy have stood at the forefront in the field of energy conversion.29–32 However, up to now, the solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency and stability of these PEC and/or PC systems are still far from meeting the practical demand of hydrogen production on a large scale. To realize a high STH efficiency, the employment of appropriate semiconductors with suitable band gaps and optoelectronic properties is extremely important. Cadmium sulfide (CdS), especially one dimensional (1D) ordered CdS nanoarray materials, is an excellent candidate,33–35 because it can not only remarkably enhance the light absorption and scattering efficiency, but can also provide a fast electron transport pathway for the photogenerated electrons.36,37 Unfortunately, the serious self-photocorrosion of CdS largely hinders its photoactivity, photo-stability and practical application.38–40 Moreover, like most other photocatalysts, pure CdS material is kinetically incapable of producing hydrogen from water. It is widely accepted now that CdS-based photocatalysts or photoelectrodes should be integrated with hydrogen or oxygen evolution cocatalysts to achieve efficient solar-driven water splitting.41–44 In recent years, it has been found that many of the HER or OER electrocatalysts can be used as highly efficient cocatalysts to enhance the photocatalytic properties of CdS.45–47 Especially, Ni-based metal sulfides can significantly improve the PC hydrogen generation properties of CdS.48–51 Despite these exciting advancements, most of the reported nickel sulfide/CdS composites always exhibit irregular alignment and/or serious aggregation, resulting in small specific surface area and insufficient catalytically active sites.52–54 Thus, it is quite desirable to engineer well-confined nickel-sulfide/CdS nanoarray catalysts with sufficient active sites and fast charge transport abilities to achieve a stable and high PEC or PC water splitting performance.
Based on the above considerations, herein, for the first time, we rationally designed and fabricated an innovative class of Ni3S2 {210} high-index facet exposed and shell thickness controllable CdS@Ni3S2 core–shell nanorod arrays on Ni foam (CSNS) by a very simple one-pot hydrothermal treatment. The unique CSNS possesses two main advantages in enhancing both the EC performance of Ni3S2 and the PEC/PC activity of CdS: (i) in the EC water splitting system, the well-aligned 1D CdS nanorod array cores can serve as supports, thus enhancing the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the Ni3S2 nanosheets; (ii) during the PEC or PC water splitting process, the outer layers of Ni3S2 can act as cocatalysts, which effectively suppress the photocorrosion of CdS and significantly enhance the photoactivity and stability of CSNS. Thanks to the advantageous heterostructural features and judicious integration between Ni3S2 and CdS functional components, the as-prepared CSNS samples can be employed as multifunctional catalysts in EC, PEC and PC hydrogen production systems, and they exhibit highly efficient and stable hydrogen production properties. Interestingly, it was found that the shell thickness of Ni3S2 had a prominent effect on the final catalytic performance of the as-prepared samples in the three different hydrogen production systems. The underlying catalytic mechanisms were systematically investigated, and three corresponding models were established for further understanding the interfacial charge separation and transfer properties during the catalytic process.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of CdS@Ni3S2 nanorod arrays on Ni foam (CSNS)
The CdS@Ni3S2 nanorod arrays were in situ grown on commercial Ni foam by a facile hydrothermal synthesis strategy. Firstly, a piece of Ni foam (2.5 × 3 cm2) was sequentially cleaned using acetone, deionized water, 0.1 M HCl and alcohol for 5 min to remove the surface oxide layer. Then the cleaned Ni foam was submerged into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 30 mL of 20 mM Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, 20 mM thiourea and 17.5 mM glutathione solution. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 200 °C for 3 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the samples were washed with water and ethanol and dried in air.
2.2 Preparation of CSNS samples with different Ni3S2 shell thicknesses (CSNS-x)
Similar to the above CdS@Ni3S2 sample, by varying the S2−/Cd2+ precursor ratios from 1:2 to 3:2 (maintaining the thiourea concentration at 20 mM), a class of CSNS-x samples was obtained with different Ni3S2 shell thicknesses (each 5 mM increase of S2− concentration corresponded to a new CSNS-x sample).
In order to well investigate the catalytic properties and mechanisms of the CSNS-x samples, pure Ni3S2 electrodes, RuO2 loaded electrodes, Pt/C loaded electrodes and pure CdS nanorod arrays were fabricated as follows.

Synthesis of pure Ni3S2 electrodes. 
Pure Ni3S2 electrodes were fabricated by the same experimental process as for CdS@Ni3S2 without glutathione and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O.


Preparation of pure CdS nanorod arrays on conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. 
In order to measure the band-gap structure of pure CdS nanorod arrays, the CdS nanorod arrays/FTO films were prepared by the same hydrothermal method as the above CdS@Ni3S2 sample instead of changing the Ni foam with a piece of FTO glass.


Synthesis of RuO2 loaded electrodes. 
0.01 mol RuCl3 3H2O was dissolved in 100 mL deionized water and maintained at 100 °C for 10 min, followed by the addition of 1 mL 1.0 M KOH solution. The mixture was kept at this temperature for another 45 min with stirring. After that, the solution was centrifuged and filtered to remove the remaining chlorides, and the precipitate was washed several times with deionized water. The resulting Ru-hydroxide was dried for 5 h at 80 °C and then calcined in air at 300 °C for 3 h to obtain RuO2.


Synthesis of Pt/C loaded electrodes. 
The Pt/C catalysts (5 mg) were first dispersed in a mixture of 0.5 mL ethanol and 10 μL Nafion solution. And then the dispersion was ultrasonicated for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous ink and then loaded onto a preprocessed 0.25 cm2 Ni foam by drop-coating, in which the loading mass for Pt/C was kept in line with that of the as-prepared samples.

2.3 Materials characterization
The power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the materials were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max 2550 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The distribution of various elements in the products was exhibited by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an ESCALAB 250Xi spherical analyzer. The evolved gases during photocatalytic activity measurements were detected using a gas chromatograph (Tian Mei, GC7900). The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were taken using a Philips-FEI Tecnai G2S-Twin microscope equipped with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken using an FEI Nano SEM 430.
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements of the HER and OER were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 650D, CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai, China) in a three-electrode system in aqueous KOH electrolyte (1.0 M) using the CSNS-x samples as the working electrode, Pt was used as the counter electrode and a silver chloride electrode as the reference electrode. All potentials measured were calibrated against the ohmic potential drop. All potentials measured were calibrated to the RHE using the following equation: . The overpotential values were described by the Tafel equation η = a + blogj + jRs, where η (V) denotes the applied overpotential, j (A cm−2) is related to the current density, b (V dec−1) represents the Tafel slope, and Rs (Ω cm−2) is the total area-specific uncompensated resistance of the system. A voltage-time curve was created using the data from the chronopotentiometry test under three different additional voltages of 0, 50 and 100 mV. The electrolyte is 1 M KOH solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the Schottky test were performed on a CHI 650D; the electrolyte used was a mixed solution of 0.5 M Na2SO3 and 0.5 M Na2S.
2.5 Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) measurements
The ECSA for each CSNS-x sample was estimated from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) obtained from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans.55 According to the previously reported method, the corresponding ECSA can be calculated as the following function: ECSA (cm2) = Cdl/Cs, where Cdl was derived from the plot of non-faradaic capacitive current densities (jc) against the scan rates (ν), jc = νCdl; Cs is the specific electrochemical double-layer capacitance, which was taken to be a general specific capacitance of Cs = 0.04 mF cm−2, as the samples were measured in an alkaline solution.56
2.6 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The test conditions of the photoelectrochemical measurements were the same as those of the electrochemical measurements except for the electrolyte. In the photoelectrochemical measurements, the electrolyte was a mixed solution (0.5 M Na2SO3 and 0.5 M Na2S). In the photoelectric response test, CdS–Ni3S2/NF was set in a special quartz bottle with a flat window on the side. The sample was irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp positioned 10 cm away and fitted with a λ > 400 nm filter. The irradiation light was cut off every ten seconds, and the current and time data were recorded using an electrochemical workstation.
2.7 PEC hydrogen production measurements
The PEC H2 production properties of the samples were also examined in the same Na2S and Na2SO3 mixed solution. The sample was set in a quartz bottle and remained sealed. Before irradiation, the reactant mixture was degassed by bubbling N2 gas for 30 min. The photoelectric response measurements were recorded for 50 minutes with continuous illumination. A 250 mL cylinder was used to collect the generating H2 gas.
The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained by the photoelectric response test with different wavelength filters (405, 420, 450, 475, 500, and 550 nm). The formula is as follows (eqn (1)): (1)where λ is the wavelength of the irradiated monochromatic light, Pλ is the monochromatic light intensity and Jλ is the photocurrent density under corresponding λ.
The applied bias photon to current conversion efficiency (ABPE) was obtained from the data of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV).57,58 The formula is as follows (eqn (2)): (2)Jph and Vb are related to the photogenerated current and bias (vs. NHE), Ptotal represents the power density of a 300 W xenon lamp covered by a visible light filter.
2.8 PC H2 production measurements
The photocatalytic experiments were performed at room temperature in a custom quartz bottle with a flat window, and a silicone rubber septum was used for sampling. The CdS–Ni3S2/NF was set in the quartz bottle with 100 mL Na2SO3 (0.75 M) and Na2S (0.5 M) mixed solution, and nitrogen was allowed into the bottle for 30 minutes. Finally, the bottle was kept under the 300 W xenon lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter and the sample was taken out once every hour 3 times. The xenon lamp was positioned 15 cm away from the reactor. The gas chromatograph was used to measure the amount of hydrogen evolved. During the whole experiment, the magnetic stirrer was kept at the bottom of the reactor in order to release the gas quickly.
The bandpass filters (405, 420, 450, 475, 500, and 550 nm) were used to measure the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions. The photon flux of the incident light was determined using a Ray virtual radiation actinometer. The reaction solutions were irradiated for 3 h with bandpass filters for AQE measurement on H2 production. The following formula was used to calculate the AQE (eqn (3)).59,60 (3)where λ is the wavelength of the irradiated monochromatic light, NH is the number of molecules of evolved hydrogen, and Pλ and Eλ are the light intensity per unit area and the average photon energy at the corresponding λ, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and composition
The morphology characterization of the obtained CSNS sample was first investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), after the hydrothermal synthesis process, the surface of Ni foam is completely covered with vertically aligned nanorod arrays. The enlarged SEM images (Fig. 1A and B) show that these nanorods exhibit hexagonal top structures the same as typical CdS nanorods. Meanwhile, the surfaces of these nanorods are covered with an ultrathin layer of disordered wrinkles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were also performed to investigate the detailed crystal structure of a single nanorod. In the TEM image (Fig. 1C), the nanorods with rough surfaces are approximately 200 nm in diameter and about 400–500 nm in length. From the HRTEM image in Fig. 1D, the distinct and consecutive lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.34 nm correspond well with the d-spacing of the (002) planes of hexagonal CdS.61 When observing the HRTEM image along the (002) crystallographic direction of CdS, another two sets of crystallographic planes with interplanar distances of 0.24 and 0.23 nm were found, which can be indexed to the (003) and (021) crystallographic planes of the hexagonal Ni3S2 phase.28 Moreover, the angle of intersection between the (003) and (021) facets is about 71°, which indicates that the main exposed surface of the Ni3S2 nanosheets is the high-index {210} facet.28 The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental analysis reveal the presence of Cd, S, and Ni. As shown in Fig. 1E, Cd element is mainly detected in the core region of the nanorod, while, Ni and S elements are covered on both the core and shell. These detailed observations confirmed that the Ni3S2 nanosheets with high-index {210} facet surfaces were successfully grown on the surfaces of CdS nanorods, forming a uniform CdS@Ni3S2 core–shell heterojunction structure.

The phase and crystal structure of the as-prepared samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 2A, except for the diffraction peaks at 44.5° and 51.8° arising from the Ni foam, all the other distinguished peaks in the XRD pattern can be attributed to the desired CdS and Ni3S2. The diffraction peaks at 24.8°, 26.5°, and 28.2° are ascribed respectively to the (100), (002) and (101) lattice planes of hexagonal greenockite CdS (JCPDS# 41-1049), and the main (101), (110), (003) and (021) lattice planes of hexagonal heazlewoodite Ni3S2 (JCPDS# 44-1418) are also found in the pattern with the diffraction peaks at 21.8°, 31.1°, 37.8°, and 38.3°. The obvious (003) diffraction peak of Ni3S2 suggests that the hexagonal Ni3S2 prefers the growth direction along the [001] crystal plane of CdS which has a relatively high diffraction intensity at the (002) peak. These results are consistent with the HRTEM results and further confirm that the Ni3S2 nanosheets were in situ grown on the surface of the CdS nanorod. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were acquired to further reveal the composition and chemical valence status of the sample. The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S2†) demonstrates the chemical composition of S, Ni and Cd. The high-resolution spectrum of S 2p, as shown in Fig. 2B, can be decomposed into two peaks located at 162.4 and 163.6 eV, which are assigned to the orbital of S 2p in Ni3S2 and the typical metal–sulfur bonds in CdS, respectively.23,62,63 In the Ni 2p high resolution spectrum (Fig. 2C), the two strong peaks at around 855.7 and 873.1 eV can be attributed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 in Ni3S2, respectively.64 The associated state satellite peaks at 861.3 and 879.4 eV prove the presence of nickel–oxygen species at the composite surface, which may be caused by the fact that the Ni3S2 nanosheet shells are on the surfaces of the CdS nanorods and are directly exposed to air. The small binding energy peak at 852.6 eV in the Ni 2p spectrum is the characteristic peak of Ni3S2.26 The two strong peaks at 405.7 and 412.3 eV in the Cd 3d high resolution spectrum (Fig. 2D) can be attributed to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, which means that cadmium is in the Cd2+ chemical state. These XRD and XPS results combined with the SEM and TEM analyses strongly confirm that CdS@Ni3S2 core–shell nanorod arrays were successfully synthesized on the Ni foam.

3.2 Formation mechanism of core–shell CdS@Ni3S2 nanorod arrays
According to the preparation process and the characterization results of CdS@Ni3S2 nanorod arrays, the formation mechanism of the sample can be explained as follows (Scheme 1). (i) At the early stage of the hydrothermal treatment, thiourea was firstly decomposed to release NH3, H2S and CO2 (eqn (4)). Simultaneously, under such alkaline conditions, the Ni0 atoms on the surface of Ni foam were oxidized to Ni2+ in the hydrothermal process (eqn (5)). (ii) Then, as the solubility product constant (Ksp) of CdS is much smaller than that of Ni3S2,65,66 the active S2+ species preferentially reacts with the Cd2+ ions to cause CdS nucleation, and with the presence of a glutathione capping agent, the CdS nanorods are aligned along the (002) direction and grown on the Ni foam substrate (eqn (6)). This result is confirmed by the HRTEM data (Fig. 1D) and is similar to the findings of a previous report by Li et al., in which they synthesized CdS nanorod arrays on FTO.67 (iii) With the consumption of Cd2+ and growth of CdS nanorods, more and more Ni2+ ions are adsorbed onto the CdS nanorods to form a Ni2+/CdS precursor, which is due to the existence of cation vacancies on the surface of CdS.51 Then, driven by the CdS nanorod backbone, the 2D Ni3S2 nanosheets were epitaxially grown on the surface of the CdS nanorods (eqn (7)). Notably, in this case, as the S2− ions in both Ni3S2 and CdS composites come from the same precursor, and Ni3S2 shares the same hexagonal crystal structure as CdS (see the HRTEM and XRD results), according to the Frank–van der Merwe heteroepitaxial growth mechanism,68 the 2D Ni3S2 nanosheets were in situ epitaxially grown on the surface of CdS nanorods along their [001] direction, as shown in the contrast interface area in the HRTEM image (marked with a red dashed rectangle in Fig. 1D). NH2CSNH2 + H2O → 2NH3 + H2S + CO2(4) 2Ni0 + 8NH3 + 2H2O + O2 → 2[Ni(NH3)4](OH)2(5) Cd2+ + S2− → CdS(6) Ni2+ + S2− → Ni3S2(7)
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the hydrothermal growth of the CdS@Ni3S2 heteronanorod composite. 
Interestingly, by increasing the S2−/Cd2+ precursor molar ratio from 1:2 to 3:2, the surface structure and morphology of the obtained CdS@Ni3S2 are remarkably changed, as can be seen in the SEM results in Fig. 3A–E. From the corresponding TEM images in Fig. 3F–J, it is found that CdS still maintains the nanorod morphology with almost unchanged sizes. However, the Ni3S2 shell thickness increased with increasing S2−/Cd2+ molar ratio. A set of HRTEM images (Fig. 3K–O) reveal the phase junction between the shell and core regions, which also further confirm that the average Ni3S2 shell thickness increased from 1 nm to 10 nm. More detailed XRD and XPS analysis results of all these samples and the SEM results of pure Ni3S2 nanosheets on nickel foam and pure CdS nanorod arrays on the FTO glass are displayed in Fig. S3 and S4.† These observations are consistent with the proposed kinetic and thermodynamic growth mechanism of the CdS@Ni3S2 sample. Moreover, the in situ epitaxial growth of Ni3S2 could induce an intimate contact interface between CdS and Ni3S2, which can provide much convenience for charge transportation. In the following, the obtained CSNS samples with different Ni3S2 nanosheet thicknesses were systematically investigated in the EC, PEC and PC catalytic systems, and for simplicity, the CdS@Ni3S2 samples were abbreviated as CSNS-x (x refers to the average Ni3S2 shell thickness estimated from the HRTEM results in Fig. 3K–O).

3.3 Electrochemical catalytic (EC) activity
Both the HER and OER electrocatalytic performance of the CSNS-x samples was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in alkaline solution (1 M NaOH). For comparison, the catalytic activity of pure Ni3S2, CdS, Pt/C (20% wt) and RuO2 was also measured. Fig. 4A shows the OER spectra of CSNS-x samples and RuO2 catalysts. It can be seen that all of the CSNS-x samples have pre-oxidation peaks before their onset potential, and the peak intensities increased with the Ni3S2 shell thickness; these phenomena are commonly observed with most Ni-based electrocatalysts and can be attributed to the oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III).69,70 The OER onset potential of CSNS-x is gradually decreased from 1.56 eV (CSNS-1) to 1.49 eV (CSNS-5), and then increased again to 1.51 eV for the CSNS-3 sample. Typically, the OER electrocatalysts are benchmarked by comparing their overpotential (η) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is expected from a 10% efficient solar water splitting device. In this case, since the large oxidation peak for the CSNS-x samples masked the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2, here we compared the η value at 20 mA cm−2 to verify the OER properties of the obtained samples. It can be found that the CSNS-5 catalyst exhibits the best OER activity with a η of 310 mV, which is much lower than that of pure Ni3S2 on Ni foam (η = 420 mV) and other CSNS-x samples. In addition to the OER catalytic activities, all the CSNS-x samples exhibited good HER properties in the same alkaline solution. As shown in Fig. 4B, CSNS-5 also has the best HER performance achieving a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 142 mV. Although this HER activity is still lower than that of Pt/C (η = 102 mV), it is actually much better than that of the pure Ni3S2 in this work (186 mV) and the previously reported high-index {210} facet exposed Ni3S2 (∼170 mV) in the same electrolyte.28 The kinetic parameters corresponding to the OER and HER activities were further calculated from the measured Tafel slope collected near the onset potential (Fig. 4C and D). The observed OER and HER Tafel slopes of CSNS-5 were about 176.8 and 138.6 mV dec−1, which are respectively smaller than those of pure Ni3S2 catalysts. The smaller Tafel slope suggests that CSNS-5 has faster reaction kinetics than pristine Ni3S2. According to a previous report, the turnover frequency (TOF) is another important parameter that can be used to evaluate the electrocatalyst in the EC catalysis procedure.71 In this work, the H2 TOFs of CSNS-5, CSNS-10 and pure Ni3S2 samples are calculated at various potentials for HER electrocatalysis (Fig. S5†). The TOF value of CSNS-5 is higher than that of CSNS-10 and pure Ni3S2; this result confirmed that the CdS nanorods play a critical role in dictating the HER activities and can further boost the EC catalytic performance of the active Ni3S2 nanosheets. In order to gain further insights into the intrinsic activity of Ni3S2 for hydrogen electrocatalysis, the exchange current density for the hydrogen evolution/oxidation reactions (HER/OER) was calculated from the Tafel plots and fitted with the simplified Butler–Volmer equation.72,73 As shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1,† CSNS-5 exhibited the highest exchange current density; this result suggests that CSNS-5 has the fastest reaction kinetics compared to the other samples. Besides, we also tested the long-term stability performance of the CSNS-5 electrode in 1.0 M KOH. As can be seen in Fig. 4E and F, when the applied current density is set at 20 mA cm−2 and −10 mA cm−2 for the OER and HER measurements respectively, a constant OER potential of 1.58 V (vs. RHE) and HER potential of −0.28 V (vs. RHE) can be well maintained for at least 10 h without obvious decay. These results indicate a good level of stability for CSNS-5 in both OER and HER electrocatalytic reactions.

The excellent OER and HER electronic catalytic properties of the CSNS-x samples can be attributed to the following reasons: (i) the high electrocatalytic properties are mainly induced by Ni3S2, while with increasing S2−/Cd2+ molar ratio the number of Ni3S2 electrocatalysts obviously increased; this result provides an essential advantage for improving the EC performance of the CSNS-x samples. (ii) The increased Ni3S2 number also enhanced the electronic conductivity of the synthesized electrodes (see Fig. S7†), which directly increased the current density of the CSNS-x samples. (iii) The CdS nanorod arrays here mainly play a supporting role, thus increasing the exposed surface of the CSNS-x samples. With increasing thickness of highly rough Ni3S2 nanosheets, more Ni3S2 catalytically active sites are exposed to the electrolyte due to the increased surface area, thus facilitating the catalytic process, while, for the CSNS-10 sample, as seen in Fig. 3E and S8,† the Ni3S2 nanosheets have fully covered the spaces between the nanorods, which may lead to a decrease in the exposed surface and electrocatalytically active sites of Ni3S2. In order to further investigate this point of view, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of each CSNS-x sample, pure CdS and Ni3S2 was determined by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) obtained from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans (Fig. S9 and Table S2†).56 As expected, CSNS-10 exhibited a smaller ECSA than CSNS-5, which has the highest number of exposed active sites. As a consequence, CSNS-5 displays the highest EC properties compared to other CSNS-x samples. We also summarized the partial electrochemical data based on previously reported Ni-based electrocatalysts. As illustrated in Table S3,† compared with other Ni-based catalysts, it is obvious that our synthesized CSNS sample exhibited as good or even better EC water splitting performance than most of these outstanding Ni-based electrocatalysts, with a low onset potential and overpotential for both OER and/or HER processes.
3.4 Photoelectrochemical catalytic (PEC) activity
Using a chronoamperometry strategy, the PEC behaviors of the obtained samples were explored by measuring their transient photocurrent in a Na2S and Na2SO3 mixed solution. As shown in Fig. 5A, unlike the EC measurement results, CSNS-2 shows the best photoelectric performance with a photocurrent density of 5.8 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V bias (vs. Ag/AgCl). Fig. 5B shows the PEC stability of this photoelectrode; it can be seen that CSNS-2 can maintain a photocurrent of ∼5.6 mA cm−2 (96.6% retention rate) after 4.5 h of continuous PEC measurement. The wavelength dependent incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) is another important parameter that can be used to quantitatively investigate the photoelectrical activity of the photocathodes in a PEC cell. Fig. 5C exhibits the photoresponse capability of CSNS-x photoelectrodes under different monochromatic light irradiation from the UV to visible light region. CSNS-2 has the highest photocurrent density of 0.9 mA cm−2 under 450 nm wavelength light irradiation, and it can still maintain a weak photocurrent response under 600 nm wavelength light irradiation (∼1 μA cm−2). The translated IPCE spectra of the CSNS-x samples from Fig. 5C are shown in Fig. 5D, and it can be seen that the CSNS-2 photoelectrode showed a huge improvement in PEC activity in the visible region compared with other CSNS-x samples. The CSNS-2 photoelectrode achieved the highest IPCE value of 15.6% at 450 nm. Fig. 5E further displays a set of LSV plots for the CSNS-x photoelectrodes under dark conditions and visible light illumination (λ > 400 nm), respectively, with the sweep range from −0.8 to 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The dark current of all the measured photoelectrodes exhibited a strong rising tendency with the impressed voltage increasing from −0.6 to 0.2 V, which may be caused by the excellent conductivity of the metal nickel foam substrates. Surprisingly, an extremely huge instantaneous photocurrent (∼121 mA cm−2) was detected at a voltage of 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for the CSNS-2 photoelectrode. The applied bias photon to current conversion efficiency (ABPE) of the CSNS-x samples was calculated and is shown in Fig. 5F. It can be seen that the CSNS-2 photoelectrode also reaches the maximum photon to current conversion efficiency with the best ABPE value of ∼7.9%. All these results indicate that when the CSNS-x samples were used as the photoelectrodes, CSNS-2 with a thin layer of Ni3S2 nanosheet shell has the highest PEC performance. We further measured the practical EC and PEC H2 evolution properties of CSNS-2 under 0.2 V external bias (vs. Ag/AgCl) in the Na2S and Na2SO3 mixed solution. As displayed in Fig. S10A,† the average PEC H2 production rate of the CSNS-2 photoelectrode reached 112.5 μmol cm−2 min−1, which is about 1.4 times higher than the EC H2 production rate (82 μmol cm−2 min−1). Moreover, as shown in Fig. S10B,† the dark current intensity of the CSNS-2 photoelectrode is around 225 mA cm−2, and the photo-current intensity is about 330 mA cm−2. Therefore, the photoinduced current density reached 115 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the LSV results and strongly demonstrates the stability of the CSNS-2 sample in these EC and PEC H2 evolution processes. According to the results, it was found that pure CdS exhibited negligible EC activity in either the OER or HER process, and under visible light irradiation, the pure Ni3S2 has scarcely any PC or PEC activity.

The possible PEC mechanism was put forward as follows: (i) as all the samples respond to the anodic photocurrent, this phenomenon suggests that the CSNS-x samples have typical n-type semiconductor characteristics. Thus, under visible light illumination (λ > 400 nm) and driven by an electric field, the photogenerated electrons in CdS will move into the bulk and transfer into the counter Pt electrode reducing H+ to H2. In contrast, the PEC oxidation reaction occurred on the CSNS-x photoelectrodes. (ii) On the one hand, the presence of Ni3S2 layers can promote the oxidation reaction rate, and therefore enhance the PEC properties of CSNS-x samples. On the other hand, thick Ni3S2 layers are disadvantageous for light absorbtion of the CdS nanorod core (this perspective had been proved by the following UV-vis absorption analysis), which has direct influence on the STH efficiency in the PEC system. As a consequence, with an optimal thickness Ni3S2 layer, the CSNS-2 photoelectrode exhibits the highest PEC activity.
3.5 Photocatalytic (PC) activity
Encouraged by the novel EC and PEC properties of the CSNS-x samples, we also investigated the PC activity of the obtained samples. The PC H2 generation results of these CSNS-x samples under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) are illustrated in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6A, without the assistance of an external bias, all the CSNS-x samples show continuous H2 generation in a consecutive five-hour reaction procedure. The calculated average H2 production histogram in Fig. 6B clearly reveals that with the initial increase of the Ni3S2 nanosheets from 1 to 3 nm, the PC H2 production properties step up from 5.9 to 8.2 μmol cm−2 h−1. Further increasing the Ni3S2 nanosheet thickness leads to a sharp decline in the properties to 3.5 μmol cm−2 h−1 for CSNS-10. The stability of the CSNS-3 sample in PC H2 production was further confirmed by cyclic experiments. Four successive runs were conducted without renewing the solution and the photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. S11,† a linear increase of H2 amount with the irradiation time can be observed in each run; in the fourth PC cycle, the average H2 production rate reached 7.8 μmol h−1 cm−2, about 87.6% of the H2 production rate of the first cycle (8.9 μmol h−1 cm−2) being maintained. We further measured the outstanding solar-to-hydrogen properties of the CSNS-3 sample under monochromatic light. As shown in Fig. 6C, CSNS-3 exhibits the highest H2 production rate of 1.38 μmol cm−2 h−1 under 475 nm monochromatic light irradiation, and the PC H2 production ability of CSNS-3 can remain up to 520 nm wavelength. Under irradiation with much longer single wavelength light, such as 550 nm, there is negligible H2 release in the PC system, which is hard to quantify. According to the practical hydrogen production under different wavelength light illumination, the apparent quantum efficiencies (AQEs) were calculated to evaluate the solar energy conversion ability of the CSNS-3 sample (Fig. 6D). It is found that CSNS-3 achieves a maximum AQE value of 1.36% under 475 nm visible monochromatic light irradiation.

To understand the in-depth photocatalytic mechanism of the samples, the optical properties of CSNS-x were investigated. Fig. 7A shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all the samples (excited with 420 nm visible light). According to previous reports, the three sharp peaks at about 470, 482 and 493 nm are attributed to the band-edge emission peaks of CdS, and the broad emission peak at about 520 nm can be attributed to the surface-defect-related recombination of the trapped electrons/holes on the CdS nanorod arrays.74–76 Therefore, CSNS-2 has the lowest charge recombination rate with the lowest PL emission peak intensity at 520 nm. Moreover, combined with the SEM and TEM results, the PL spectra also reveal a fact that the CdS nanorods in the CSNS-1, CSNS-2 and CSNS-3 samples have some exposed surfaces, while for the CSNS-5 and CSNS-10 samples, the CdS nanorods were fully covered by the Ni3S2 shells, which results in a missing PL emission peak at 520 nm. From the UV-vis absorption spectroscopy results (Fig. 7B), it can be concluded that all the CSNS-x samples exhibit a broad light absorption range in the visible light region. For the CSNS-1, CSNS-2 and CSNS-3 samples, the absorption peak at around 500 nm is similar to the characteristic absorption of the CdS species which has the absorption peak edge extending to about 560 nm. With the thickness of Ni3S2 nanosheets further increased, the absorption intensity of the CSNS-5 and CSNS-10 samples obviously decreased, which tended to be the characteristic absorption of Ni3S2. This phenomenon confirms that the Ni3S2 nanosheet shells could shield the CdS nanorod cores from absorbing light. Simultaneously, it can also be observed that the absorption edges from CSNS-1 to CSNS-3 samples are slightly red-shifted, which can be attributed to the effective formation of heterojunction band-gap structures between CdS and Ni3S2. The band gap structures of both CSNS-x samples and pure Ni3S2 samples were estimated from the corresponding Tauc plots, as shown in Fig. 7C, in which the curves of (αhν)rversus photon energy (hν) were derived from the UV-vis spectra, and r was evaluated to be 2 as CdS is a direct band-gap semiconductor. By measuring the x-axis intercept of the extrapolated line from the linear region of the curve,51 the calculated band-gap values for the CSNS-1, CSNS-2 and CSNS-3 samples were firstly decreased from 2.19 to 2.15 eV. However, with much thicker layers of Ni3S2 nanosheets, the band-gaps of CSNS-5 and CSNS-10 samples were increased to 2.50 and 2.53 eV, respectively, approaching the pure Ni3S2 band gap of 2.70 eV. Mott–Schottky (MS) plots were further obtained to estimate the electronic band structures and the carrier density of the CSNS-x samples. As displayed in Fig. 7D, it can be observed that all the synthesized catalysts exhibit n-type semiconductor characteristics with positive tangent slopes. And the slopes of the linear region for the CSNS-x samples are obviously decreased. This result suggests that the donor densities are gradually increased with increasing Ni3S2 shell thickness, which may be induced by the good electrical conductivity and large surface area of Ni3S2. From the MS plots, the flat band energies (Efb) of CSNS-x and pure Ni3S2 were estimated to be −0.74, −0.72, −0.70, −0.66, −0.62 and −0.51 eV (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. It is known that the CB position is generally more negative than the Efb by about −0.2 V; therefore, the VB position can be calculated by the CB and band gap energy.77 The corresponding electronic band structures of all the samples are illustrated in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8, with the Ni3S2 shell thickness increased, the CB edge potential of the CSNS-x samples becomes more and more negative than that of pure CdS NRs (see details in Fig. S12†), while their VB edge potentials are gradually decreased, as the synthetic band-gaps of CSNS are similar to the characteristic VB positions of the pure Ni3S2 species. It is well known that an appropriate band gap with a suitable CB edge position is favorable for obtaining optimal H2 production activity under visible-light irradiation. Therefore, the balance among the light absorption capacity, the reducing ability, the rapid spatial separation of photoinduced charges and the charge carrier density together proves that the CSNS-3 sample has the highest PC H2 production efficiency.

3.6 Discussion of the EC, PEC and PC catalysis mechanisms
Based on the above results, the possible EC, PEC and PC H2 evolution catalysis mechanisms of CSNS-x samples are presented, and the three corresponding charge separation/transfer models are displayed in Scheme 2: (i) in the EC water splitting system, the HER or OER mainly takes place on the surface of the Ni3S2 nanosheets and the opposite reaction occurs on the counter electrode, the electrons flow direction is shown in Scheme 2 (left). In this case, the CdS nanorods mainly play a supporting role to increase the exposed surfaces of the Ni3S2 nanosheets. CSNS-5 with suitable Ni3S2 exposed surfaces and conductivity exhibits the highest HER and OER properties in the alkaline solution. (ii) For the PC H2 production system as shown in Scheme 2 (middle), under visible light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons on the CB of CdS nanorods transmit to the surface of Ni3S2 nanosheets and take part in the H+ reduction reaction. In this process, the Ni3S2 nanosheets mainly act as cocatalysts, and an incompletely covered structure of the CdS nanorods has also provided advantages for the donor oxide reaction which takes place on the partially exposed CdS nanorod surface. As a result, with a balance between the appropriate synergetic band gap and light absorption capacity, CSNS-3 received the highest PC H2 production performance. (iii) Combined with the visible light irradiation and the external electric field, the photogenerated electrons from CdS nanorods transfer to the counter electrode through the Ni foam substrate, as shown in Scheme 2 (right). In this PEC H2 production system, the thickness of the Ni3S2 layers remarkably affects the light absorption performance of the CdS core. Therefore, with the assistance of external bias, the CSNS-2 sample exhibits the highest photon to current conversion efficiency.

3.7 The structure and composition stability of CSNS
The structure and composition stability of all the tested samples (CSNS-2, CSNS-3 and CSNS-5) after the corresponding long time PEC, PC and EC processes were well investigated by XRD and SEM. As shown in Fig. S13,† the XRD and SEM patterns of the used samples are identical to those of the fresh one and the used samples still have the rod-like core@shell structure with nearly the same length and diameter as the fresh ones. The XPS spectra of CSNS-2, CSNS-3 and CSNS-5 after they were used in long-time PEC, PC and EC measurements are displayed in Fig. S14,† which exhibits the same rule with fresh samples without a band energy shift. Moreover, the used CSNS-5 electrode was further investigated by HRTEM, as shown in Fig. S14D†; obviously, the Ni3S2 shell still exhibited high crystallinity similar to the fresh one. Thus, the composition and morphological stability of the prepared CSNS samples were confirmed by these results.
4. Conclusion
In summary, a class of versatile, binder-free, non-noble metal catalysts based on Ni3S2 {210} high-index facet exposed and shell thickness controllable CdS@Ni3S2 core–shell nanorod arrays has been successfully synthesized on Ni foam. The Ni3S2 shell thickness can be easily controlled from 1 to 10 nm by adjusting the Cd2+/S2− molar ratio in the precursors. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the as-synthesized CSNS samples have trifunctional catalytic properties in EC, PEC and PC water splitting processes. The excellent catalytic performance in the PC, PEC or EC systems was primarily attributed to the controllable shell thickness of the Ni3S2 nanosheets, and the synergistic catalytic role transformation effect between Ni3S2 and CdS. The results show that (i) the CSNS-5 sample exhibited a good level of activity and stability in both OER and HER electrocatalytic reactions; the lowest OER and HER overpotential is 310 mV (masked with a current of 20 mA cm−2) and 142 mV (masked with a current of 10 mA cm−2), respectively. (ii) The CSNS-2 sample achieved the highest PEC activity with an ABPE value of 7.9% and a high average PEC H2 production rate of 112.5 μmol cm−2 min−1. (iii) The CSNS-3 sample realized an AQE value of 1.36% under 475 nm monochromatic light irradiation, and the PC H2 production rate reaches 8.2 μmol cm−2 h−1. These advantageous properties as well as the durability and cost-effectiveness of CSNS can make it a promising material to replace noble metal-based catalysts for water splitting. This study provides new insights into the design and development of high-performance electrocatalysts/photocatalysts and core–shell catalysts for selective application of H2 production systems.
