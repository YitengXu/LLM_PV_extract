    , Accepted 4th May 2018First published on 7th May 2018AbstractElimination of charge trapping at defects is highly challenging for poly-crystalline organometal halide perovskites. Here, we report a new architecture for reinforcing the built-in electric field (Ein) across the photoactive layer with a pair of strong electric dipole layers (EDLs). The paired EDLs significantly intensify the Ein across the perovskite layer, resulting in suppressed charge trapping of photogenerated charges. As a result, our low-temperature processed P–I–N planar PeSC devices using the paired EDLs exhibit a higher power conversion efficiency (ηmax ∼ 19.4%) and a smaller device-to-device variation with a standard deviation (S.D.) of 0.70%, which far surpass those (ηmax ∼ 17.8%, S.D. ∼ 1.1%) of the devices with typical charge transport layers.

Broader context
Due to their superb optical and electrical properties as light absorbers in photovoltaics (PVs), organometal halide perovskites have attracted great attention as a promising future PV material. In particular, excellent crystallization of organometal halide perovskites via a simple solution process is a critical feature for efficient device performance of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). However, the poly-crystallinity of the perovskites inevitably results in uncontrollable and variable trap defects at grain boundaries and/or in bulk films. Because these defects critically affect the efficiency, reproducibility, and stability of PeSCs, the reduction of charge trapping is a crucial challenge for further PeSC development. One promising approach to minimize the effect of the trap defects is to provide a strong electric force to the photogenerated charges. However, an electric force that is commonly applied to photogenerated charges in conventional PVs is insufficient for efficient collection of the charges at each electrode. This manuscript introduces a versatile method of reinforcing the built-in electric force (Ein) across the perovskite layer by introducing a pair of strong electric dipole layers. The reinforced Ein (1) significantly boosts the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PeSCs via efficient sweep-out of photogenerated charges and (2) successfully reduces the device-to-device performance variation. We believe our approach offers some insight into the commercialization of PeSCs with excellent efficiency, reliability, and reproducibility.

Introduction
Since the groundbreaking development of solid-state perovskite-based solar cells (PeSCs) in 2012,1,2 tremendous efforts have been made toward efficient energy harvesting in PeSCs because of the excellent optoelectronic properties of the crystalline perovskite materials that are also fabricated by low-temperature solution processes.3–9 However, the poly-crystalline perovskites are still dominated by uncontrollable trap defects in their grain boundaries, crucially governing the device performance, reproducibility, and stability.10–13 To reduce the density of the trap defects, there have been many efforts to improve the perovskite film quality (uniform and large crystal size and well-defined stoichiometry) by compositional engineering,14–17 solvent engineering,18–22 introduction of additives,23–25 and hot solution casting.12,26 However, due to the sensitivity of the perovskites to the subtle changes under their fabrication conditions, such as atmosphere, temperature, stoichiometry and precursor preparation (concentration, host and additive solvents), it is still difficult to control the density of the trapping sites.12,27,28
One promising approach for overcoming this issue is to apply a strong electric force to the photogenerated charges. Previous studies suggested that the recombination at the trapping sites can be significantly reduced by applying an external reverse bias to the photoactive layer in polymer solar cells.29–33 Because the applied external bias provides a stronger electric force (F = qEin, where q is the elementary electric charge) acting on the photogenerated charges in the photoactive layer, the majority of these are effectively swept out to each electrode with minimal recombination.34,35 However, applying such a high electric field in a real device without an external bias is a serious challenge. In addition, there was no study to report the relationship between the built-in electric field (Ein) and device performance variation in perovskite solar cells. Thus, it is critical to find a method to increase Ein in the perovskite layer to ensure the efficient extraction of the photogenerated charges with minimal loss. Moreover, the method should be compatible with the solution and low-temperature processable advantage of PeSCs.
Here, we report a versatile strategy to simultaneously enhance the device performance and reproducibility of organometal halide PeSCs by introducing a pair of strong electric dipole layers (EDLs). Our paired EDLs substantially enhance Ein by adjusting the surface potential for both the hole and electron extraction layers and contribute to the decrease of the non-radiative recombination losses in the devices, thereby significantly improving both device efficiency and reproducibility. As a result, our P–I–N planar PeSCs incorporating paired EDLs exhibited the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.4% (ηmax) with an average PCE (ηave) ∼ 18.0% [standard deviation (S.D.) of 0.70%], which far surpasses the ηmax of 17.8% with ηave of 15.6% (S.D. ∼ 1.05%) for PeSCs with the typically used charge transport layers (CTLs).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows schematic illustrations of the structures and the energy level diagrams of the P–I–N planar PeSC devices with and without EDLs as interfacial layers for both the anode and cathode under short-circuit conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 1a and b, when light (>Eg) is applied into the perovskite layer, the photo-charges are generated and extracted to each electrode by Ein under short-circuit conditions. However, Ein developed in the conventional device structures with the common electrodes [e.g., indium tin oxide (ITO) and aluminum (Al)] is insufficient to efficiently extract the charges without recombination.33–35 In particular, the trapping sites such as under-coordinated ions (Pb and/or halides) due to point defects at perovskite surface/grain boundaries in the perovskites36–38 can attract and trap the dissociated electrons or holes via electrostatic force under such an insufficient Ein, significantly limiting the charge extraction efficiency and giving rise to the notorious device-to-device variation in PeSCs. On the other hand, when strong EDLs, such as conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) or fullerene monolayers with ionic functionality,39–41 are introduced between the metal electrode and the p- or n-type semiconductors, the well-aligned surface charges in EDLs help to enhance the built-in field (1) by shifting the vacuum energy level at the interfaces between electrodes and p- or n-type semiconductors which enlarges the difference in the effective WFs of the anode and cathode and (2) by reducing the energetic barriers through matching of the energy levels of the extracting layers to the quasi Fermi levels which eliminates the potential loss at the interfaces,39,42 thereby improving charge selectivity at each electrode and detrapping the trapped charges.39,43 The photogenerated charges under this stronger Ein can then be efficiently collected at each electrode with minimized charge trapping by the defects during transport.

Φ, μ, P, I, and N are the energetic barriers of holes (Φh) and electrons (Φe), and the net electric dipole moments of the EDL, and p-type, intrinsic, and n-type semiconductors, respectively. 
Our hypothesis is also supported by the schematic energy level diagrams of the PeSC devices with or without a pair of EDLs that describe the effect of the paired EDLs on the strength of Ein within the semiconductor (Fig. 1b). Generally, Ein originates from the work function (WF) difference between the two electrodes in the devices.44 To achieve a strong Ein, the WF difference (ΔWF) between the two electrodes should be maximized through strategic interfacial engineering of both electrodes. A pair of strong EDLs is a promising candidate for this purpose due to the wide range in the WF tunability of the metal electrodes. The EDLs generate strong electric dipoles and shift the vacuum energy (Evac) level at the metal–semiconductor interfaces.39,45 The shift (Δ) of Evac increases Ein in the perovskite under short-circuit conditions so that more efficient charge extraction is expected, as illustrated in Fig. 1b.
As efficient EDL materials, we adopted p-doped poly(9,9-bis(4′-sulfonatobutyl)fluorene-alt-co-1,4-(2,5-dimethoxy)phenylene) (p-PFP-O)46 as a hole extraction layer (HEL) for the anode and poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)47,48 as an electron extraction layer (EEL) for the cathode (Fig. 2a), the electronic characteristics of which show strong electric dipole formation at the interface (Scheme S1, ESI†). To confirm the WF tunability of p-PFP-O and PFN on the metal electrodes, we measured the WF of ITO before and after the deposition of p-PFP-O and PFN using a Kelvin probe measurement system. The WFs of ITO (4.8 eV) modified with p-PFP-O and PFN were shifted by +0.6 and −0.6 eV, respectively, demonstrating their excellent EDL features (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†).

The device architecture and the energy-level diagram of our PeSCs are shown in Fig. 2a and b. The PeSC devices were fabricated with a planar P–I–N type architecture of ITO/HEL (p-PFP-O or PEDOT:PSS)/PTAA/perovskite/PC61BM/EEL (PFN or TiOx)/Al, where PEDOT:PSS, PTAA and PC61BM stand for poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-amine] and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, respectively. In this study, we used methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) as the perovskite material. For a reference device, we chose the typically used CTL materials, PEDOT:PSS and TiOx, for the anode and cathode, respectively.
First, we compare the quality of the perovskite films for both types of devices. Fig. 2c and d show scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the MAPbI3 films deposited on p-PFP-O/PTAA and PEDOT:PSS/PTAA, respectively. We found that both MAPbI3 crystals exhibit similar grain size and morphology. To evaluate the crystallinity of the perovskite films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained as shown in Fig. 2e. Both films exhibit identical XRD patterns, indicating the same orientations of the MAPbI3 crystals for both films. Fig. 2f also shows the almost identical optical absorption spectra of both perovskite films. Therefore, we conclude that the quality of the MAPbI3 film grown on p-PFP-O/PTAA and PEDOT:PSS/PTAA substrates is almost identical.
Next, to directly confirm that the EDLs do in fact modify the surface potential of the next component films (PTAA for p-PFP-O and MAPbI3/PCBM for PFN) as described in Fig. 1, we carried out Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) measurements for each component film in our PeSCs. The contact potential difference (CPD) of each film was measured by using a Pt/Cr coated tip with the bias of −600 mV as the reference. A positive (negative) CPD value indicates a lower (higher) Fermi level compared to that of the biased tip. Fig. 3a–c show the surface potential images observed from the PTAA films (∼10 nm) on ITO, ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO/p-PFP-O, respectively. When PTAA is coated on ITO, the average CPD value increases from ∼90 to ∼230 mV, apparently due to the lower Fermi level of the PTAA film compared to that of ITO (see also Fig. 3g and j and Fig. S1, ESI†). Interestingly, when p-PFP-O or PEDOT:PSS are introduced underneath the PTAA, the surface potential of PTAA shifts to the negative direction, indicating an increase in the PTAA Fermi level. However, for PTAA coated on ITO/p-PFP-O, its CPD value decreases to −35 mV, which is much lower than that of PTAA on ITO/PEDOT:PSS (60 mV) (see also Fig. S2, ESI†). These results clearly show that p-PFP-O leads to a higher PTAA Fermi level due to hole accumulation induced by its self-aligned surface electric dipoles.45

The change of CPD values corresponds to WF shift. 

Fig. 3d–f show the surface potential images of the PC61BM films (∼100 nm) before and after TiOx or PFN coating (see also Fig. S2, ESI†). The PC61BM films on MAPbI3 showed a darker color corresponding to its average CPD value of ∼−480 mV (see also Fig. 3h and i). After TiOx coating onto the PC61BM film, we observed no significant change in the CPD values (from −480 to −500 mV). In contrast, when PFN was coated on the PC61BM film, the surface potential image exhibited brighter brown color (corresponding to the average CPD value of ∼−280 mV), resulting from an upper shift of the Evac level at the surface due to the electric dipoles of PFN. However, it is contradictory to that of the electric dipoles which reinforce the Ein as shown in Fig. 1 and 2b.
To clarify the real dipole direction of PFN at the junction with Al in the device, we carried out ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement for the PFN/Al interface. The Al/PFN∼ interface (∼denotes the target surface for the measurement) was obtained from a device structure of ITO/PC61BM/PFN/Al by using a film detaching technique with carbon tapes, as described in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The similar features of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) region of the UPS spectra from Al/PFN∼ and ITO/PFN∼ reveals that the PFN was apparently detached from the PCBM interface (Fig. S4, ESI†).49 In Fig. 4a and b, the vacuum energy level (Evac) clearly shifted upward at the PFN/Al interface, indicating that new electric dipoles with opposite direction are formed at the interface where anions turn to an Al electrode as shown in Fig. 1 and 2b. In addition, the UPS results of the Au/PFN∼ interface also support the up-shift of the metal WF in the real devices (Fig. S5, ESI†). Consequently, from these results, we concluded that the dipole direction of PFN at the interface of PFN/Al is rearranged after deposition of the top metal electrode (Fig. 4c). Because the thickness of the PFN film is very thin (∼5 nm), a strong interaction between PFN and the diffused metal atoms can cause rearrangement of the electric dipoles as reported elsewhere.50 Based on these results, we expect that more substantially enhanced Ein is generated throughout the whole device by introducing paired EDLs due to the large surface potential difference.

To directly confirm our hypothesis, we investigate the effects of the paired EDLs on the device performance, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a exhibits the J–V characteristics of PeSCs without interlayers and with paired EDLs (p-PFP-O and PFN) and CTLs (PEDOT:PSS and TiOx) measured under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the device performance parameters are summarized in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†). For the devices without any interlayers between the electrodes and the P–I–N layers, the J–V curves show a kink shape due to the energy barriers at their interfaces, resulting in the low PCE of 14.7%. The PeSC with the paired CTLs exhibited a PCE of 17.8%, with Jsc = 20.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.08 V, and FF = 0.80, which is a reasonable performance for a P–I–N type PeSC. This implies that paired CTLs reduce the hole and electron energy barriers and enhance the charge extraction efficiency by their energy level matching. However, by replacing CTLs with EDLs, we notice that the PCE dramatically increases from 17.8% to 19.4%, with Jsc = 21.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.10 V, and FF = 0.82. All parameters of the paired ELD devices were improved compared to those of the PeSCs with CTLs or only one EDL (Fig. S6, S7, and S8, and Tables S5 and S6, ESI†). In addition, the PeSCs with the paired EDLs exhibited good stability (90% of initial PCEs) even after 300 h in air with a relative humidity of ∼30% (Fig. S9, ESI†). The effects of the thickness of each EDL on the device performance are summarized in Fig. S10 and Tables S7 and S8 (ESI†).

(c) Normalized J–V curves of PeSCs with paired EDLs or CTLs. Histograms of solar cell performance parameters: (d) PCE, (e) Jsc, (f) FF, and (g) Voc. 
To verify the effect of EDLs on the device-to-device performance variation, the so-called ‘reproducibility’, we fabricated ‘40’ independent devices incorporating paired EDLs and CTLs and statistically analyzed the performance parameters obtained from their J–V curves. Fig. 5b shows the averaged J–V curves of devices with standard deviations and the area between the J–V curves of the devices with maximum and minimum PCEs. Based on these data, we can deduce that the device performance and reproducibility are dramatically enhanced when the paired EDLs are introduced into the PeSC devices. The normalized J–V curves of PeSCs in Fig. 5c clearly show an enhanced FF with a reduced deviation by introducing paired EDLs, in good agreement with the reduced series resistance (Rs) and increased shunt resistance (Rsh) value presented in Table S4 (ESI†).
For a close comparison of each performance parameter, we plotted histograms of PCE, Jsc, FF, and Voc. Fig. 5d clearly shows that the performances of PeSCs with the paired EDLs (18.0 ± 0.70%) surpass those of the PeSCs with CTLs (15.6 ± 1.05%). The standard deviation in the PCE of PeSCs with the paired EDLs is much lower than that for PeSCs with CTLs; this is primarily due to the narrower distributions of Jsc (20.8 ± 0.8 mA cm−2) and FF (0.79 ± 0.01) compared to those of PeSCs with CTLs (Jsc ∼ 19.3 ± 1.00 mA cm−2, FF ∼ 0.76 ± 0.02) as shown in Fig. 5e and f. In addition, the paired EDLs also substantially suppressed the device-to-device variation of PeSCs with various top metal electrodes (e.g. Cu, Ag, and Au) (Fig. S11 and Table S9, ESI†). Therefore, our results imply that reinforcing Ein in PeSCs by introducing a pair of EDLs may be a good strategy to reduce the notorious performance deviation in PeSCs.
To elucidate the effect of the paired EDLs on the strength of Ein in PeSCs, we performed Mott–Schottky analysis on the PeSCs with the paired EDLs or CTLs by measuring the junction capacitance:  where C is the measured capacitance, ε is the static permittivity, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, A is the active area, N is the doping density of the donor, and Vbi is the built-in potential. The intercept of the linear regime with the x-axis of the Mott–Schottky plot can be assigned to Vbi.51Fig. 6a clearly shows the increase of Vbi from 0.84 to 0.94 V when EDLs replace CTLs in the PeSC devices, confirming that Ein is stronger for the devices with the paired EDLs and that the photogenerated charges can be more efficiently swept out by the reinforced Ein. Considering that both devices with CTLs and EDLs have good Ohmic junctions at the interface of the perovskite and interfacial layers, the enhanced Ein is the main driving force for the performance improvement by introducing the paired EDLs.43 It is noted that the Vbi values are slightly lower than the Voc values. We attribute this behavior to the presence of charged ions and/or highly doped layers at the interfaces in the devices.52

The charge recombination process under different strengths of Ein was investigated by extracting the recombination resistances (Rrecs) from impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements of PeSCs with the paired EDLs or CTLs. Generally, the Rrec is obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots of the IS spectra in the low-frequency region, with higher Rrec values indicating a lower recombination rate in the device (see also Fig. S12, ESI†).53Fig. 6b shows the Rrec values as a function of applied voltage under 1 sun illumination. As shown in Fig. 6b, the devices with the paired EDLs exhibited much higher Rrec values compared to those of the devices with CTLs at all applied voltages, indicating that charge recombination is significantly suppressed by the incorporation of EDLs.
The dependence of Voc on the light intensity also provides information on the trap-assisted recombination under open-circuit conditions in such devices.34,54Fig. 6c shows a semi-logarithmic plot of Vocvs. light intensity, and it can be seen that these two parameters exhibit a linear relationship with the slope proportional to kT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. A slope constant close to unity is indicative of minimal recombination. The PeSC device with the paired EDLs (slope: 1.69kT/q) exhibits a weaker dependence of Voc on the light intensity than a device with the paired CTLs (slope: 1.80kT/q), clearly demonstrating that the paired EDLs reduce the trap-assisted recombination of charge carriers in PeSC devices.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully developed highly reproducible and efficient PeSCs by introducing a pair of strong EDLs consisting of CPEs (p-PFP-O and PFN). Studies of built-in potentials and charge recombination dynamics of the PeSCs demonstrate that the incorporation of the EDLs significantly enhances Ein in the perovskite layer, minimizing the effect of trap density variation on the device performance via an efficient sweep-out of the photogenerated charges. Consequently, our PeSCs with the paired EDLs show enhanced reproducibility and efficiency with ηmax = 19.4% that far surpasses ηmax = 17.8% of the conventional devices with typical CTLs (PEDOT:PSS and TiOx).
Experimental section
Solar cell fabrication
For the PeSCs, the device structure was ITO/HEL/PTAA/perovskite/PC61BM/EEL/Al. The p-PFP-O film was prepared by spin casting (at 5000 rpm for 40 s) methanol:DMSO solutions (99:1 by weight) at the concentration of 0.02 wt% to form films of ∼5 nm in thickness.46 For the devices with PEDOT:PSS HELs, a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was spin cast (at 5000 rpm for 40 s) to form a 30 nm-thick film. The PEDOT:PSS films were baked at 150 °C for 10 min in air. A PTAA solution (0.25 mg mL−1 in toluene) was spin cast (at 6000 rpm for 40 s) on top of the HEL film. The PTAA film was then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in air. The perovskite precursor solution (MAPbI3, 1.5 M in 1 mL of DMF:DMSO (8.5:1.5, v/v)) was spin cast (at 3000 rpm) onto the PTAA film, and diethyl ether (1 mL) was dropped on the perovskite precursor film after 15 s in the N2-filled glove box.55 The precursor film was annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, a PC61BM solution (40 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin cast (at 1500 rpm for 40 s) onto the MAPbI3 film to form an approximately 100 nm-thick film. The PFN (1-Material, Inc.) was spin cast (at 5000 rpm for 10 s) from a methanol solution (0.05 wt%). All materials such as titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP), mono-ethanolamine (EA), and 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME) for the TiOx precursor solution were purchased from Aldrich and used without re-distillation. TTIP (1 mol) was mixed with 20 mol of 2-ME and vigorously stirred for 5 min at room temperature. After this step, EA (2 mol) was added into the transparent sol precursor and the precursor was refluxed for one hour at 150 °C to remove the excess solvents. The entire process was conducted under nitrogen gas to prevent hydrolysis. For device fabrication, a precursor solution diluted to 1:200 (mol/mol) in 2-propanol was spin cast (at 5000 rpm for 10 s) to form TiOx films of 10 nm in thickness.56 Al (100 nm) then successively deposited via thermal evaporation under 1.0 × 10−6 Torr. For the reproducibility tests in Fig. 4, we used three different batches of perovskite precursor solutions.
Characterization
The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured in the reverse and forward scan directions at the scan rate of 25 mV/10 ms using a Keithley 238 source measure unit (Keithley Instruments, Inc.). The solar cell performance was measured in an N2-filled glove box under a calibrated AM 1.5G solar simulator with irradiation intensities ranging from 2.37 to 100 mW cm−2. The intensity of the solar spectrum obtained from the xenon (Xe) lamp (150 W Oriel) of the solar simulator was calibrated using a calibrated standard silicon solar cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The device area is 4.64 mm2.
The EQE spectra were obtained using a solar cell spectral response/QE/IPCE measurement system (PV Measurements, Inc.) with the chopping frequency of 100 Hz. The measuring systems were calibrated using an amorphous standard cell manufactured by PV Measurements, Inc. The calculated Jsc from the EQE spectra has <±5% error compared to the value of Jsc obtained by using the solar simulator.
For the impedance spectroscopy measurement of the devices, the frequency response analyzer (FRA) system of the AUTOLAB instrument was used. Sinusoidal voltage signals V(t) over the frequency range of 10 Hz–1 MHz were applied to PeSCs by the potentiostat at different applied bias values (0–1.1 V) under 1 sun illumination. The capacitance–voltage characteristics of PeSCs for the Mott–Schottky plot were measured under 1 sun illumination and the frequency of 100 kHz at bias potentials between −1.0 and 1.5 V by using the same system as in the impedance spectroscopy measurement.
SEM measurements were performed using a S-4700 SEM instrument (Hitachi, Japan). The WF values were obtained using a KP 6500 Digital Kelvin probe (McAllister Technical Services, Co.). The absorption spectra of the perovskite films and the reflectance spectra of PeSC devices were obtained using a UV/Visible/NIR absorption spectrometer (Lambda 750, PerkinElmer, Inc.).
UPS measurements were conducted using a SPECS PHOIBOS 150 hemispherical analyzer. An ultraviolet discharge lamp was used as an excitation source (He I, 21.22 eV) and a sample bias of −10 V was applied to obtain the second cut-off (SEC) in normal emission geometry. The spectrometer was calibrated with respect to the cleaned Au Fermi step as a reference and the spectral broadness of UPS was 0.1 eV. The base pressure of the analysis chamber was maintained below 6.0 × 10−10 Torr.

Broader context
Due to their superb optical and electrical properties as light absorbers in photovoltaics (PVs), organometal halide perovskites have attracted great attention as a promising future PV material. In particular, excellent crystallization of organometal halide perovskites via a simple solution process is a critical feature for efficient device performance of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). However, the poly-crystallinity of the perovskites inevitably results in uncontrollable and variable trap defects at grain boundaries and/or in bulk films. Because these defects critically affect the efficiency, reproducibility, and stability of PeSCs, the reduction of charge trapping is a crucial challenge for further PeSC development. One promising approach to minimize the effect of the trap defects is to provide a strong electric force to the photogenerated charges. However, an electric force that is commonly applied to photogenerated charges in conventional PVs is insufficient for efficient collection of the charges at each electrode. This manuscript introduces a versatile method of reinforcing the built-in electric force (Ein) across the perovskite layer by introducing a pair of strong electric dipole layers. The reinforced Ein (1) significantly boosts the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PeSCs via efficient sweep-out of photogenerated charges and (2) successfully reduces the device-to-device performance variation. We believe our approach offers some insight into the commercialization of PeSCs with excellent efficiency, reliability, and reproducibility.
