    , Accepted 13th December 2020First published on 14th December 2020AbstractThe electrochemical conversion of nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions is a highly promising alternative to the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process. However, it suffers from poor yields and selectivity because of the lack of efficient catalysts. Herein, we prepared an economical and eco-friendly efficient biochar catalyst from peanut shells and achieved a high ammonia yield (2.32 μmol h−1 cm−2) and selectivity (faradaic efficiency of 26.97%) over 12 h of stable operation. The results of density functional theory calculations illustrate that association pathways are more likely to occur on the active sites Bio-N4, Bio-O37, and Bio-S58, while dissociation pathways always occurred on the active sites Bio-O15, Bio-O21, and Bio-O52. Furthermore, Bio-O21 is the most promising active site for the NRR following the NNH2 dissociation pathway with a lower reaction barrier. The preferable adsorption of N2, desorption of NH3, and suppression of the HER demonstrated the peanut shell-derived material as a more promising catalyst for the NRR.
1 Introduction
Ammonia (NH3) is a highly demanded chemical substance that is widely applied in the production of fertilizers and nitric acid.1 Currently, the synthesis of NH3 gas is mainly achieved by the Haber–Bosch process,2 which is catalyzed by iron (Fe)-based catalysts at high temperatures (400–500 °C) and high pressure (150–250 atm) with nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen as raw materials.3,4 Accordingly, NH3 production can only be performed using bulky centralized equipment. Furthermore, it is a high-energy-consumption process that entails extensive carbon dioxide emission,5–7 and the transportation of NH3 gas is expensive and inefficient.
With energy and climate issues becoming increasingly important, the development of sustainable NH3 synthesis technologies has become necessary.8–14 Accordingly, the electrochemical synthesis of NH3 from N2 (or air) and water by reduction (also termed the N2 reduction reaction [NRR]) under normal temperature and pressure conditions is highly desirable and shows great promise.15–17 The basic process for the electrochemical synthesis of NH3 under alkaline conditions can be expressed by the following equations:Anode: 6OH− − 6e− → 3/2O2 + 3H2OCathode: N2 + 6H2O + 6e− → 2NH3 + 6OH−Overall: N2 + 3H2O → 3/2O2 + 2NH3
With electrochemical NH3 synthesis technology,18–21 the raw materials are green and sustainable, and the electricity required can be supplied by renewable sources such as solar or wind power.22 Thus, such technology can truly achieve sustainable NH3 production.23 Furthermore, the mild conditions required would allow the multi-distributed production of NH3 gas, saving transportation and distribution costs. It has been estimated that this technology could theoretically be 20% more energy-efficient than the Haber–Bosch process. However, the current efficiency of this technology is still 30% lower than that of the Haber–Bosch process.24
In recent years, significant research effort has been dedicated to achieving high-efficiency NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions, with the bulk of that research being focused on the development of suitable catalysts.25–28 Precious metals29–32 have been widely considered as catalysts for electrochemical NH3 synthesis because of their excellent adsorption properties, stability, and corrosion resistance. For example, Nazemi et al.33 used gold nanoparticles prepared from silver (Ag) nanoparticle templates to achieve a maximum NH3 yield of 3.9 μg cm−2 h−1 and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 30.2% at −0.4 V (vs. RHE).
The use of metallic ruthenium as an NRR catalyst is also an active research area.34 For instance, Manjunatha et al.29 supported a ruthenium–platinum (1:1) alloy on a sulfided XC-72 carbon (C) composite as an NRR catalyst, achieving an NH3 production of 5.1 × 10−9 g s−1 cm−2 at 0.123 V (vs. RHE) with an FE of 13.2%.
However, owing to the scarcity and cost of precious-metal resources, much of the catalyst research is now focused on non-precious metals that are easy to obtain.35–37 Typical non-precious-metals used in catalysts are molybdenum,38–40 Fe,41–43 and copper.44 In addition to their single metal forms, oxides and sulfides of such metals are often used in N2 reduction studies. For example, Li et al.38 studied defect-rich molybdenum sulfide nanocatalysts. They reported 100% selectivity, an NH3 yield of 29.28 μg h−1 mg−1cat., and an FE of 8.34% at a potential of −0.4 V (vs. RHE).
Metal oxides45–47 also have a wide range of applications in the field of catalysis, and their performances are markedly improved if they are in a nanosized form. For instance, Cui et al.48 used an o-ferric oxide–C nanotube composite as an NRR catalyst, achieving an average NH3 yield of 0.46 μg h−1 cm−2 and an FE of 6.04% at −0.9 V (vs. Ag/silver chloride [AgCl]).
Similar to non-precious metals, porous C materials are abundant resources and relatively easy to obtain, which have become more widely used as catalysts or catalyst carriers owing to their controllable pore structures and surface chemistries.49,50 For example, Mukherjee et al.51 used ZIF-8 as a precursor and pyrolysis at 1100 °C for 1 h to prepare a N2-doped nanoporous C catalyst, achieving an NH3 yield of 7.3 × 10−6 mol cm−2 h−1 and FE of 10.2% at 60 °C and −0.3 V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, N2-doped C-based catalysts52 have been shown to have very large specific surface areas and extensively porous structures, both of which promote adsorption and mass transfer and significantly increase NRR activity.
As porous C catalysts are currently highly popular research topics, a fundamentally sustainable material that can achieve true recyclability in preparation is interesting for electrocatalysis.53–55 Furthermore, the NH3 yields and FEs achieved using current porous C materials as NRR catalysts are poor. Thus, improving the catalytic activities of C-based catalysts is an urgent challenge. We have listed all kinds of carbon-based material catalysts in the ESI.†
Resource-abundant and green biochar materials56–59 have been widely studied and shown to exhibit very promising results as catalysts. Accordingly, in this study, we used peanut shells as raw materials to prepare a catalyst for the electrochemical synthesis of NH3. After carbonization and activation, the catalyst was thoroughly characterized, and its electrocatalytic performance in the NRR was assessed in terms of yield and FE. DFT calculations were performed on the possible pathways of the NRR with the peanut shell-derived biochar material as a catalyst and the adsorption energies of N2, N2H4, NH3, and H on the biochar catalyst were calculated to study the mechanism of the NRR on the biochar catalyst.
2 Experimental
2.1 Catalyst synthesis
The biochar catalyst was synthesized by pyrolyzing peanut shells using the procedure illustrated in Scheme 1. The peanut shells were first washed with tap water and then rinsed with deionized water. After drying at 100 °C for 12 h, the peanut shells were carbonized at 400 °C for 3 h in a tube furnace under a N2 atmosphere, transforming the peanut shells into biochar. The obtained biochar was soaked in 5 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) overnight and then collected by vacuum filtration. After drying in air, the biochar was activated at 1100 °C for 1 h and finally washed with 1 M hydrogen chloride (HCl) to remove inorganic impurities.

2.2 Material characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI) was used to reveal the morphology of the biochar catalyst. Its elemental distribution was analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F30, FEI) at a working voltage of 200 kV was used to further characterize the microstructure of the catalyst. The crystal structure of the catalyst was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, XRD-7000, Shimadzu) at an accelerating voltage of 35 kV and a tube current of 25 mA. The elemental composition and valence states of the catalyst were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 210, ThermoFisher). In addition, the biocatalyst was characterized by laser confocal micro-Raman spectrometry (Invia-Reflex, UK) in order to further reveal its C structure.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were conducted using a five-electrode electrolytic cell. A platinum wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The working electrode was a glassy C rotating disk electrode (θ = 5 mm, PINE instruments) coated with a catalyst layer. The electrolyte was 0.1 M aqueous KOH saturated with N2 or argon (Ar). Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) at 5 mV s−1, cyclic voltammetry at 50 mV s−1, and chronoamperometry at various potentials were performed using a CHI760E electrochemical workstation. A catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 10 mg of the catalyst in a mixture of 1 mL isopropanol and 30 μL Nafion with sonication. A 20 μL ink sample was drop-cast onto the working electrode. Ag/AgCl potentials were converted to RHE values, and iR compensation was used.
2.4 Analysis of products
The NH3 produced was quantified by the indophenol blue method, in which the NH3 concentration in the electrolyte stained by the indophenol blue indicator is proportional to the absorbance at a wavelength of 655 nm. First, three stock reagents were prepared. The chromogenic reagent (reagent A) was prepared by dissolving 5.0 g of sodium salicylate and 5.0 g of sodium tartrate in 100.0 mL of 1.0 M KOH; the oxidizing reagent (reagent B) was prepared by diluting 4.50 mL of sodium hypochlorite (effective chlorine 6–14%) in 100.0 mL deionized water; the catalyzing reagent (reagent C) was obtained by dissolving 0.20 g of sodium ferrocyanide in 20.0 mL of deionized water. Then, 1.50 mL of the sample solution, 1.50 mL of reagent A, 0.75 mL of reagent B, and 0.15 mL of reagent C were successively added to a test tube. After shaking the test tube and waiting for 1 h, absorption spectra were collected using a UV-vis spectrophotometer, and the concentration of NH3 was calculated using a calibration curve (Fig. S1†) obtained by analyzing a series of ammonium chloride solutions with known concentrations using the same procedure.
The NH3 yield (R) and FE were calculated using  and , respectively, where C is the concentration of NH3, V is the total volume of the electrolyte, t is the reaction time, A is the geometric area of the working electrode, and F is the Faraday constant. Q is the total charge during the reaction. The possible hydrazine (N2H4) by-product was quantified using the method of Watt and Chrisp. Briefly, 2.0 mL of sample solution and 2.0 mL of chromogenic reagent were placed into a test tube, mixed, and then analyzed by UV-vis spectrophotometry after 1 h. The chromogenic reagent for N2H4 was prepared by adding 4.0 g of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 20 mL of concentrated HCl to 200 mL of ethanol. The UV-vis absorption spectra and calibration curve for N2H4 are shown in Fig. S2.†
2.5 Theoretical calculation details
All theoretical calculations of the pathways of the NRR on the peanut shell-derived biochar material as well as the adsorption energies of N2, N2H4, NH3, and H were performed based on density functional theory (DFT) using the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) program in the Materials Studio package. The generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was utilized to describe the electronic exchange. Moreover, the plane-wave cutoff was tested and set to 500 eV.60–62 The self-consistent field tolerance was 2 × 10−6 eV with the on-the-fly generated ultrasoft pseudo-potential for core electrons.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization of the biochar catalyst
The biochar catalyst was prepared by pyrolyzing peanut shells. As shown by the SEM image in Fig. 1, the as-prepared catalyst has an elongated-flake-like morphology with an average particle size of 30 × 3 μm. At the same time, it can be seen from the TEM image that the catalyst has some wrinkles. The EDS elemental maps (Fig. 1c) show that the catalyst comprises uniformly distributed C, N, oxygen (O), and sulfur (S) elements.

(a) SEM image and (b and c) TEM images and the corresponding EDS maps of elemental C, N, O, and S in the sample. Comparisons of (d) the XRD patterns and (e) Raman spectra of the as-prepared biochar catalyst and graphite. 
The structure of the biochar catalyst was characterized by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD pattern and Raman spectrum of the biochar catalyst are compared with those of graphite in Fig. 1d and e, respectively. The XRD pattern of the biochar shows broad peaks at 26° and 44°, which correspond to the (002) and (100) planes of the graphite structure.57 The Raman spectrum shows two distinct peaks at 1340 and 1585 cm−1, which correspond to the D and G bands, respectively. The D-band peak is related to disordered C structure, and the G-band peak is related to the ordered graphitic structure. The intensity ratio (ID/IG) of the two bands indicates the degree of graphitization in the sample material.63–65 The intensity of the D-band peak is obviously higher than that of the G-band peak in the Raman spectrum of the biochar catalyst, indicating a dominantly disordered C structure in the catalyst.66 This is due to the high temperature treatment, which destroyed a significant portion of the graphitic structure, resulting in increased defects. Such defects have been demonstrated to be beneficial for the NRR.51
The composition and elemental valence states of the catalyst were investigated by XPS. The XPS survey results (Fig. S3a†) show that the biochar catalyst consists of C, N, O, and S. The C 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2a) can be fitted to four peaks at 284.1, 284.6, 285.2, and 286.3 eV, corresponding to C–C, CC, C–N, and C–O, respectively.67,68 The area percentages of these peaks are 37.6%, 44.7%, 13.3%, and 4.4%, respectively.
 Fig. 2  High-resolution (a) C 1s, (b) N 1s, (c) O 1s, and (d) S 2p XPS spectra of the biochar catalyst. 
The four peaks at 398.4, 400.1, 401.3, and 406.6 eV in the N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2b) are attributed to pyridinium N (N-6, 26.4%), pyrrole N (N-5, 13.2%), quaternary ammonium (NH4+) salt N (N-q, 15.1%), and C–N nitrogen (45.3%).68 N-5 and N-6 nitrogen can significantly improve the catalytic activity of a N2-containing material owing to their excellent electron-donating abilities, while N-q nitrogen can improve the electrical conductivity of a carbonaceous material.
The area percentages of the three peaks at 531.0 (CO), 532.0 (O–C–O), and 533.0 eV (OC–O) in the O 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2c) are 27.3%, 37.9%, and 34.8%, respectively.69 The peaks centered at 163.3, 164.7, and 168.1 eV in the S 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2d) correspond to sulfate, CS, and C–CS, and their peak area percentages are 32.3%, 14.5%, and 53.2%, respectively. The presence of N and S heteroatoms improves the electrocatalytic performance of biochar materials because they provide additional active sites.
3.2 Electrochemical NRR
In order to determine whether the presence of defects and heteroatoms (in this case, S) improves NRR performance, we performed electrochemical tests with a graphite sample as a comparison. Linear sweep voltammetry was conducted in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with N2 or Ar, and the results are shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Linear sweep voltammograms of biochar and graphite in 0.1 M KOH saturated with N2 or Ar. 
Over the potential range examined, the voltammogram obtained from the N2-saturated solution shows a higher reduction current density than that obtained from the Ar-saturated solution. A comparison of the voltammograms demonstrates that the prepared catalyst has activity for the NRR.70 In addition, when the biochar is used as the catalyst, the initial potential is more positive than that using graphite, and the current density difference between the N2- and Ar-saturated solutions for biochar is larger. Thus, biochar is superior to graphite in the electrocatalytic reduction of N2 to NH3, i.e., the presence of heteroatoms and defects are more favorable for NRR activity.
To determine the optimal potential for nitrogen reduction, the catalyst was evaluated at various potentials in a 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with N2. As shown in Fig. 4a, the current density increases from −0.65 mA cm−2 at −0.3 V vs. RHE to 9 mA cm−2 at −0.7 V vs. RHE.

(b) Current density for graphite as a function of time at various potentials in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. (c) NH3 yield and FE at various potentials calculated from the spectra in (a). (d) NH3 yield and FE at various potentials calculated from the spectra in (b). Stability of the biochar catalyst in the NRR. (e) Current density as a function of time over 12 h of continuous reduction in 0.1 M KOH saturated with N2 or Ar at −0.4 V vs. RHE. (f) NH3 yield and FE for seven consecutive cycles of reduction in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at −0.4 V vs. RHE. 
The electrolytes were analyzed using the indophenol blue method to determine the NH3 yield and reaction FE. The UV-vis spectra in Fig. S5a† show that the absorption peak for NH4+ at ca. 656 nm from the N2-saturated electrolyte after reduction is much stronger than that of the blank electrolyte (0.1 M KOH).71,72 These results indicate that a significant amount of NH4+ is produced by electrochemically reducing N2. The yield of NH4+ increases from 1.45 to 2.32 μmol h−1 cm−2 upon decreasing the potential from −0.3 V to −0.4 V vs. RHE and then decreases from 2.32 to 0.87 μmol h−1 cm−2 when the potential decreases from −0.4 V to −0.7 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4c). Thus, the biochar catalyst shows the highest yield (2.32 μmol h−1 cm−2) at −0.4 V vs. RHE and the highest FE (26.97%) at the same voltage.
As shown in Fig. 4b, the current density at different potentials for graphite is low. This result corresponds with the LSV results for graphite. The indophenol blue method was also used to analyze the electrolyte in this case, and the UV-vis spectrum is shown in Fig. S5b.† The NH4+ absorption peaks for the electrolyte after reactions at different potentials are only slightly stronger than the corresponding peaks for the blank electrolyte, with the strongest absorption peak appearing at −0.5 V vs. RHE. The more intuitive results can be seen in Fig. 4d. The yield of NH4+ increases from 0.13 to 0.82 μmol h−1 cm−2 with a decrease in potential from −0.3 V to 0.5 V vs. RHE and then decreases from 0.82 to 0.16 μmol h−1 cm−2 as the potential decreases from −0.5 V to −0.7 V vs. RHE. Therefore, the graphite catalyst shows the highest yield of 0.82 μmol h−1 cm−2 at −0.5 V vs. RHE and the highest FE (13.38%) at −0.4 V vs. RHE.
Thus, from the NH3 yields and FEs for biochar and graphite at different potentials, it can be concluded that the biocatalytic performance of biochar is superior to that of graphite in the NRR. This is most likely because the biochar contains more heteroatoms and defects.
In addition, in order to verify that the NH4+ in the electrolyte is obtained by hydrogenation of N2, we conducted the same reaction in Ar-saturated electrolyte. The UV-vis results are shown in Fig. S6.† The difference in absorbance between the Ar and N2 environments indicates that the biochar catalyst successfully promotes electrocatalytic N2 reduction to NH3. The difference in absorbance between the Ar environment and the blank electrolyte is mainly due to the insufficient purity of Ar, resulting in a small amount of NH3 being produced. This result is illustrated in Fig. S7.† Furthermore, the amount of NH4+ produced in the blank solution is negligible compared with that from the N2-saturated solution.
A mechanistic study of the electrocatalytic synthesis of NH3 has shown that the reaction process may lead to the generation of N2H4 due to incomplete reaction. However, in the present study, no N2H4 was detected in the electrolyte after 2 h of N2 reduction, as no absorption peak was found at 455 nm in the UV-vis spectra for all measured potentials (Fig. S8†).
The stability of the biochar catalyst was evaluated by conducting a reduction reaction continuously for 12 h at −0.4 V vs. RHE in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. The total current density, yield, and FE show no significant change over the tested 12 h, demonstrating the excellent stability of the biochar catalyst (Fig. 4e and f). The highest FE is 31.05% and the average NH3 yield and FE are 2.35 μmol h−1 cm−2 and 28.16%, respectively.
In order to theoretically evaluate the NRR reactivity on heteroatoms in the peanut shell-derived biochar, DFT calculations were performed on the NRR with biochar as the catalyst. Possible pathways of the NRR were divided into two categories, the associative pathway and the dissociative pathway. Based on the different dissociation intermediates, it can be divided into three different dissociation pathways, dissociation of NNH2, dissociation of HNNH2 and dissociation of H2NNH2, respectively. The specific conditions for the five pathways are shown in Fig. 5a with the structure of the biochar catalyst in Fig. 5b marked with labels and symbols. The existence of heteroatoms provides more active sites for the NRR on the peanut shell-derived biochar catalyst. Bio-N4 (the N atom at position 4 in the biochar structure model), Bio-O37 (the O atom at position 37 in the biochar structure model), Bio-O15 (the O atom at position 15 in the biochar structure model), Bio-O21 (the O atom at position 21 in the biochar structure model), Bio-O52 (the O atom at position 52 in the biochar structure model), and Bio-S58 (the S atom at position 58 in the biochar structure model) were the active sites of the peanut shell-derived biochar catalyst for DFT calculations.

(c) Free energy diagrams of the NRR at the peanut shell-derived biochar with Bio-N4 as the active site. (d) Free energy diagrams of the NRR for the associative pathway on the six biochar active sites: Bio-N4, Bio-O37, Bio-O15, Bio-O21, Bio-O52, and Bio-S58. 
As can be seen from Fig. 5c, in addition to the associative pathway, in the other four pathways, the desorption process of NH3 is a non-spontaneous process. The maximum reaction barrier of the association pathway is 9.40 eV, the maximum reaction barrier of the dissociation pathway is 10.49 eV, and the maximum barriers of the other three intermediate dissociation pathways are 30.51 eV, 19.61 eV, and 7.46 eV, respectively. The associative pathway and dissociation of H2NNH2 (dissociative pathway of H2NNH2) contain many non-spontaneous steps. Therefore, Bio-N4 as the active site is suitable for the NRR process through the associative pathway.
The NH2 → NH3 process on Bio-O37 is a non-spontaneous process (Fig. S11†), but unlike that on Bio-N4, the desorption of NH3 is spontaneous, which may be related to the release of NH3, and the release of the active site is beneficial. In addition, the associative pathway, the dissociative pathway and the dissociation path are all limited speed steps, which are NH → NH2 (5.09 eV), NH + NH → NH + NH2 (19.47 eV), NNH2 → N + NH2 (15.15 eV), HNNH2 → NH + NH2 (24.93 eV), H2NNH2 → NH2 + NH2 (20.61 eV), respectively. In summary, on Bio-O37, the best pathway for the NRR is the associative pathway.
As shown in Fig. S12,† for Bio-O15, the NH2 → NH3 process is a non-spontaneous process like that for Bio-O37. The maximum reaction barriers of the five pathways are 13.70 eV, 11.45 eV, 11.45 eV, 11.45 eV, and 12.72 eV, respectively. Except for the HNNH2 dissociation pathway, all the other pathways have four non-spontaneous steps. Compared with the dissociation pathway, it is obvious that the NNH2 dissociation pathway has a lower free energy, and the NNH2 dissociation pathway is more likely to occur on Bio-O15.
The maximum reaction barriers of the five pathways occurring on Bio-O21 (Fig. S13†) are 13.15 eV, 4.17 eV, 6.15 eV, 11.64 eV, and 8.45 eV. The maximum barrier of the dissociation pathway appears in the NH2 → NH3 step. This non-spontaneous step also exists for all the other four pathways. In addition to the NH2 → NH3 step, there are two non-spontaneous processes with small reaction barriers; the reaction barriers are 1.12 eV and 0.51 eV. Therefore, the dissociation pathway is more likely to occur on Bio-O21.
The free energy diagram of the five pathways occurring at the Bio-O52 site is shown in Fig. S14.† First, except that the maximum reaction barrier of the HNNH2 dissociative pathway appears in HNNH2 → NH + NH2 (11.63 eV), the maximum reaction barriers of the other four pathways all appear in the NH2 → NH3 step, which are 11.24 eV. It is worth noting that for the NNH2 → N + NH2 step of the dissociation of NNH2, the reaction barrier is also 11.24 eV. Compared with the associative pathway and the dissociation of H2NNH2, the dissociative pathway has only two non-spontaneous processes except the NH2 → NH3 step, and the reaction barriers of these two steps are relatively small. Taken together, the dissociation pathway is more dominant.
As can be seen from Fig. S15,† the reaction barriers of the HNNH2 → H2NNH2 step and the NH2 → NH3 step are relatively large, being 14.48 eV and 12.76 eV, respectively. Another more striking step is N → NH, and the reaction barrier in this step is 10.36 eV. Therefore, compared with the H2NNH2 dissociative pathway and the associative pathway, the remaining three reaction pathways are easier. From the perspective of spontaneous reaction, the dissociative pathway among the three pathways is more dominant. Therefore, using Bio-S58 as the active site is the most suitable for the NRR through the association pathway.
When performing NRR on the six biochar active sites Bio-N4, Bio-O37, Bio-O15, Bio-O21, Bio-O52, and Bio-S58 listed in the association pathway (Fig. 5d), except for the NH2 → NH3 step on Bio-N4, the reactions on the other active sites are all non-spontaneous reactions. The maximum reaction barriers of these six biochar active sites during the NRR are 9.40 eV, 5.09 eV, 13.70 eV, 13.15 eV, 11.24 eV, and 12.76 eV. From the perspective of the maximum reaction barrier, the Bio-N4 and Bio-O37 sites are more dominant. From the perspective of overall free energy, the Bio-N4 and Bio-O37 sites performed better. The free energies of the Bio-N4 and Bio-O37 sites are not much different in the early stage. Although the final NH2 hydrogenation step is spontaneous on the Bio-N4 site, its reaction barrier is higher than that on Bio-O37. Therefore, Bio-O37 is more suitable for the NRR through the associative pathway.
Similarly, in the energy map for the NRR with the dissociative pathway (Fig. S16†), only the NH2 → NH3 step at the Bio-N4 site is a spontaneous reaction. From the perspective of the maximum reaction barrier, the maximum reaction barriers of the above six active sites during the reaction are 10.49 eV, 19.47 eV, 11.45 eV, 4.17 eV, 11.24 eV, and 12.76 eV, respectively. It is obvious that the Bio-O21 site performance is relatively good. From the perspective of overall free energy, the free energy of Bio-O21 is smaller than that of Bio-O15, Bio-O52 and Bio-S58. In summary, Bio-O21 is the best active site for the dissociative pathway.
As shown in Fig. S17,† for dissociation of NNH2, the maximum reaction barriers for the NRR for each active site are 30.51 eV, 15.15 eV, 11.45 eV, 6.15 eV, 11.24 eV, and 12.76 eV. In addition, there are two reaction barriers (11.24 eV) at the Bio-O52 site. In terms of reaction barriers, the Bio-O21 site is dominant, while the Bio-N4 site and Bio-O37 site perform poorly. From the perspective of overall free energy, the Bio-O15 site is the least dominant. Although the free energy of the Bio-N4 site and Bio-O37 site is small, the reaction barrier is large. Compared with the Bio-O21 site and the Bio-S58 site, the Bio-S58 site has more non-spontaneous steps, and the reaction barrier and the overall free energy are greater. Therefore, the Bio-O21 site performs well and is the best active site for the dissociation of NNH2.
Similar to the NNH2 dissociative path, the reaction barriers at the Bio-N4 and Bio-O37 sites are relatively large, 19.61 eV and 24.93 eV, respectively. When the dissociative pathway of HNNH2 is used for NRR, the maximum reaction barriers of the remaining four active sites are relatively small (Fig. S18†). The maximum reaction barriers are 11.45 eV, 11.64 eV, 11.63 eV, and 12.76 eV. The reaction barriers of these four active sites are not much different. However, Bio-O37 has the most non-spontaneous steps, while Bio-O21 and Bio-O52 have the fewest non-spontaneous steps. From the perspective of total free energy, except for Bio-N4 and Bio-O37, the Gibbs free energy at Bio-O21 is the smallest. Therefore, in the HNNH2 dissociative pathway, the catalytic performance of the Bio-O21 site is the most excellent.
Looking at Fig. S19,† we can find that all sites except the Bio-N4 site are non-spontaneous reactions during the NH2 → NH3 step. Every pathway has a rate limiting step when performing the dissociation of H2NNH2. Their maximum energy barriers are 7.46 eV (Bio-N4), 20.61 eV (Bio-O37), 12.72 eV (Bio-O15), 8.45 eV (Bio-O21), 11.24 eV (Bio-O52) and 14.48 eV (Bio-S58). From the perspective of the maximum reaction barrier, the Bio-N4 and Bio-O21 sites performed better. From the perspective of the overall free energy, compared to that at the Bio-O21 site, the overall free energy at the Bio-N4 site is smaller, which is more conducive to the reaction. Therefore, compared with the other five sites, Bio-N4 is more suitable for the NRR with the H2NNH2 dissociative pathway.
Based on pathways of the NRR on the peanut shell-derived catalyst, association pathways are more likely to occur on the active sites Bio-N4, Bio-O37, and Bio-S58, while dissociation pathways always occurred on the active sites Bio-O15, Bio-O21, and Bio-O52. Furthermore, Bio-O21 is the most promising active site for the NRR following the NNH2 dissociation pathway with a lower reaction barrier.
To further evaluate the efficiency of the NRR on the peanut shell-derived biochar catalyst, the adsorption energies of N2, N2H4, NH3, and H on the biochar catalyst were calculated, as displayed in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Histogram of adsorption energy of N2, N2H4, NH3, and H on the biochar catalyst. 
It can be seen from the adsorption energies of N2, N2H4, NH3, and H at each active site of biochar (Fig. 6) that N2 is more easily adsorbed on the peanut shell-derived catalyst, illustrating that the competitive HER process was suppressed on the peanut shell-derived catalyst, consistent with LSV in Fig. 3 where the HER decreased more than the NRR as the applied voltage increased. The adsorption energy of NH3 is less than that of N2, indicating that NH3 is easier to be released and can further expose the active sites, which is beneficial to the NRR. In addition, the adsorption energy of N2H4 is particularly significant in the histogram, indicating that N2H4 is not easy to release, and it is highly likely that the reaction will continue at the active site and NH3 generated will be released, in accordance with the measurement that no N2H4 was detected in the electrolyte. The preferable adsorption of N2, desorption of NH3, and suppression of the HER demonstrated that the peanut shell-derived material is a more promising catalyst for the NRR.
4 Conclusions
We synthesized an economical and eco-friendly biochar catalyst for electrochemical N2 reduction via the facile pyrolysis of peanut shells. The flake-like biochar material was found to comprise the C, N, O, and S elements and contain a large amount of disordered C structures. The prepared biochar catalyst promoted the NRR with a high NH3 yield (2.32 μmol h−1 cm−2), high FE (26.97%), and very good stability (12 h) at −0.4 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Thus, this study constitutes a significant advance in the development of environmentally benign catalysts for electrochemical ammonia synthesis and will be of great interest to researchers in the field as well as those working in electrochemistry and catalysis fields generally.
Based on pathways of the NRR on the peanut shell-derived catalyst, association pathways are more likely to occur on the active sites Bio-N4, Bio-O37, and Bio-S58, while dissociation pathways always occurred on the active sites Bio-O15, Bio-O21, and Bio-O52. Furthermore, Bio-O21 is the most promising active site for the NRR following the NNH2 dissociation pathway with a lower reaction barrier. The preferable adsorption of N2, desorption of NH3, and suppression of the HER demonstrated the peanut shell-derived material as a more promising catalyst for the NRR.
