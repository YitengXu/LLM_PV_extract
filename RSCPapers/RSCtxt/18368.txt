The dyads also differ by the anchoring position of the spacer on the bipyridine, which is appended either at the 4-position or the 5-position. Cyclic voltammetry and the UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy suggested that the spacer linked at the 5-position ensures a longer π-conjugation length but the electron transfer rates indicate a lower electronic coupling, than in 4-position. Photoinduced emission yields indicate a significant quenching of the MLCT excited-state of the ruthenium complex in these dyads. Except for the dyad linked in 5 position with one phenyleneethynylene unit, the transient absorption spectroscopy of all the other dyads evidences that the MLCT excited-state decays almost exclusively by electron transfer to form the charge-separated state RuIII–NBI−. This state could not be observed, presumably because the subsequent recombination to the ground state was much faster than its formation. In the dyad linked in 5 position with only one phenyleneethynylene unit, at room temperature, the 3MLCT* state is in equilibrium with the 3NBI* state, and it also decays via electron transfer. The notable feature of these dyads is first the occurrence of a relatively long-range electron transfer reaction via a bis(phenylethynylene) linking unit anchored at the 5 position. Secondly, we show within these series of compounds that subtle variations in the structure of the dyads (length of the spacer and anchoring position on bipy) have a strong impact on the rates and in the mechanism of decay of the 3MLCT* state. The photophysical properties of the dyads can be explained in terms of energy proximity of different excited states and magnitude of the electronic coupling according to the anchoring position.IntroductionThe rational design of donor–bridge–acceptor (D–B–A) photomolecular system for photoinduced charge separation is of both fundamental and practical importance for solar energy conversion1–3 and molecular electronics.4–7 In D–B–A systems, the bridge plays a determining role because its electronic properties and its connectivity to A and to D control the rate of the electron transfer between D and A.1,7–12 The search of bridging units that can act as molecular wires and promote electron transfer over very long distance with a substantial rate is of high interest, because they can be employed to produce long-lived charge separated-states and with high quantum yield.13–19 The two latter features are the primary requirements that a system should fulfil in view of approaching the function of the photosynthetic reaction center. In this context, we have used oligophenylethynylene to connect porphyrin or phthalocyanine sensitizers and we showed that this type of bridge was particularly well-suited to assist photoinduced charge separation between these dyes.20,21 The ruthenium tris(bipyridine) complex is a well-known sensitizer that has been extensively used as photoactive electron donor in dyads and triads molecular systems for light induced electron transfer.22–24 In our continuing goal to design D–B–A systems performing bridge-mediated electron transfer, we were interested to use the ruthenium tris(bipyridine) complex as sensitizer, because its long-lived triplet MLCT excited-state and its strong oxidizing power after electron transfer (RuIII) make it particularly appealing for this application. In a previous paper, we showed that the combination of a ruthenium tris(bipyridine) complex with a fullerene unit could lead to quantitative energy transfer upon excitation of the ruthenium complex, instead of the desired electron transfer.25 This parasite reaction arises from the low lying level of the fullerene triplet excited-state. Naphthalene bisimide (NBI) has been used with success as an electron acceptor in association with porphyrin sensitizers26–32 but with ruthenium complexes energy transfer sometimes occurs in conjunction with the charge separation reaction.33–38 Moreover, in the ruthenium–fullerene dyads, we found unexpectedly that the energy transfer was essentially distance independent, giving the same rate constant for the dyads with one, two and three phenyleneethylene groups in the bridge.25 Various spectroscopic data showed that the nature of the ruthenium based excited state changed for the longest bridge, presumably from the usual metal-to-ligand charge transfer state to a state localized more on the bridge, with more π–π* character. We thus rationalized the similar energy transfer rate over distances from 1.1 to 2.3 nm by excitation energy hopping onto bridge states, which were thermally accessible also for the dyads with longer bridges.In this study we have prepared new dyads to investigate if we could obtain a similarly distance-independent electron transfer via excitation energy hopping. To this end, the fullerene was replaced by naphthalene bisimide. Moreover we compare dyads with the bridge attached to either the 5-bpy or 4-bpy position. We finally varied the bridge length from one to two phenylethylene units, to obtain the dyads D1p, D1m, D2p and D2m (Chart 1). We show that the utilization of NBI instead of C60 can restore the desired electron transfer from the excited ruthenium tris(bipyridine) complex. In spite of the very similar intrinsic properties of the ruthenium complexes with different bridge attachment positions, the dyads show very different behavior. We show that it can be explained by the energy proximity of different excited states that makes the resulting properties of the dyads very sensitive to small variations in the structure. Chart 1  Structures of the molecules studied in this work. ExperimentalGeneral1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX 300 MHz or AMX 400 MHz Bruker spectrometer. Chemical shifts for 1H NMR spectra are referenced relative to residual protons in the deuterated solvent (CDCl3: δ = 7.26 ppm, MeOD: δ = 3.31 ppm). Mass spectra were recorded on a EI-MS HP 5989A spectrometer or on a JMS-700 (JEOL LTD, Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) double focusing mass spectrometer of reversed geometry equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS) analyses were performed in m-nitrobenzyl alcohol matrix (MBA) on a ZAB-HF-FAB spectrometer. MALDI-TOF analyses were performed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR spectrometer in positive linear mode at 20 kV acceleration voltage with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as matrix.Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on aluminium sheets precoated with Merck 5735 Kieselgel 60F254. Column chromatography was carried out either with Merck 5735 Kieselgel 60F (0.040–0.063 mm mesh) or with SDS neutral alumina (0.05–0.2 mm mesh). Air-sensitive reactions were carried out under argon in dry solvents and glassware.Chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Compounds 2,5-bis(dodecyloxy)-4-(2′-trimethylsilylethynyl)iodobenzene 1,25N-octyl-N′-(4′-iodophenyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide 4,39 ruthenium complexes 7,259,398,39 dyad D1p,39 and reference complexes R1p,39R2m25 and R1m25 were prepared according to literature methods.The electrochemical measurements were performed with a potentiostat-galvanostat MacLab model ML160 controlled by resident software (Echem v1.5.2 for Windows) using a conventional single-compartment three-electrode cell. The working electrode was a 10 mm long Pt wire, the auxiliary was a Pt wire and the reference electrode was the saturated potassium chloride calomel electrode (SCE). The supported electrolyte was 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in DMF and the solutions were purged with argon before the measurements. All potentials are quoted relative to SCE. In all the experiments the scan rate was 100 mV s−1 for cyclic voltammetry and 15 Hz for pulse voltammetry. The UV-Visible absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-2401PC Shimadzu spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were recorded on a SPEX Fluoromax fluorimeter and were corrected for the wavelength dependent response of the detector system (Hamamatsu R928).Time-resolved emission and transient absorption spectra were recorded using an Applied Photophysics LKS60 laser-flash photolysis system. Excitation was obtained with 5 ns, 460 nm pulses (ca. 20 mJ pulse−1) from a Q-switched YAG laser (Quantel Brilliant B) with an OPOTEK OPO. The detection system of the LKS60 employed a 150 W pulsed Xe-lamp for analyzing light at right angle configuration, a monochromator after the sample, a P928 PMT, and a digital oscilloscope (500 MHz, 2 Gs/s).Syntheses2,5-Bis(dodecyloxy)-4-(2′-trimethylsilylethynyl)triisopropylsilylacetylenylbenzene 2.

The synthesis of the key intermediate 6 is depicted in Scheme 2 and it starts with the known bisalkoxy para-(trimethylsilylethynyl)iodobenzene 125 which was initially coupled with triisopropylsilylacetylene using the classical conditions of Sonogashira reaction to afford 2 with 85% yield. The trimethylsilyl group was then cleaved with potassium carbonate in a quantitative yield and the resulting compound 3 was connected to the iodonaphthalene bisimide 439 to give 5 in 69% isolated yield (Scheme 2). The last step consists of a final Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction, directly made on the complex (7 or 8) with the NBI derivative 6 or 9 (Scheme 1). The diphenylphosphinoferrocene (dppf) was chosen as ligand of palladium in the catalytic system of this last coupling because it proved to be particularly well-suited in previously reported cross-coupling reactions carried out on a ruthenium complex.25,41 The dyads D2m, D2p and D1m were thus respectively obtained in 33, 46 and 55% yield after purification on column chromatography. Scheme 1  Reagents and conditions: (a) Pd(dppf)Cl2, CuI, Et3N, DMF (33% for D2m, 46% for D2p and 55% for D1m).  Scheme 2  Reagents and conditions: (a) Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, Cu(OAc)2, Et3N, THF, 50 °C (85%); (b) K2CO3, CH2Cl2–CH3OH, RT (100%); (c) Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, Cu(OAc)2, Et3N, THF, 70 °C (69%); (d) Bu4NF, THF, RT (100%). Electronic absorption spectraThe absorption spectra of the dyads D1p, D1m, D2p, D2m are shown in Fig. 1 and the spectroscopic data are collected in Table 1. The most intense absorption in the UV, at around 290 nm, is assigned to a π–π* transition localized on the bipyridine ligands. The two sharp absorptions at 360 and 380 nm are attributed to the NBI unit and are almost not affected by comparison with the parent compound 4.25,42 This is consistent with the presence of nodes of the frontier molecular orbitals on the nitrogens of the imide groups, which lead to weak electronic communication with any substituents attached on these positions.39,43 Accordingly, the absorption bands of the ruthenium complex and of those of the phenylethynylene spacer are not affected by the presence of the NBI, as confirmed by the similar maximum absorption wavelengths of these transitions in the dyads compared to those in the parent reference compounds (Table 1). The π–π* transition of the oligophenylethynylene spacer occurs at 390 nm in dyads D2m–D2p and is naturally blue-shifted in dyad D1p and D1m containing the shorter linker. The broad absorption band in the visible region is attributed to the well-known spin-allowed metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition (MLCT). Interestingly, this absorption band is less intense and blue-shifted in the dyads D2m and D1m in which the spacer is attached in the 5 position of the bipyridine compared to the other dyads linked on the 4 position. The same effect has been observed in other tris-bipyridine ruthenium complexes functionalized either on the 4 position or on the 5 position of the bipyridine.44–48 Fig. 1  Absorption spectrum of the dyads D1p, D1m, D2p and D2m recorded in DMF.

The first oxidation reaction is a ruthenium-centred process which involves the π(t2g) metal orbital. In dyads D1p and D2p, the potential is cathodically shifted by 100 mV compared to that in dyad D2m and D1m, and to the unsubstituted [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (Table 2). This is attributed mainly to the consequence of electron donating methyl substituents, borne on the ancillary bipyridine of the former complexes, which stabilize the Ru(III).49 The two first reductions, taking place at about −0.45 and −1 V, respectively, correspond to the consecutive one-electron reductions of the NBI unit,42 while the third reduction, at around −1.2 V, is attributed to the reduction of the bipyridine ligand that is connected to the spacer. The third reduction is easier in the dyads D1p, D1m, D2p, D2m with respect to the unsubstituted [Ru(bpy)3]2+; this indicates a stabilization of the π* orbital upon the attachment of the spacer. It results from an increased π-conjugation length between the bipyridine and the oligoethynylenephenylene spacer as already observed when a π-conjugated spacer is linked to a polypyridine ruthenium complex.25,39,50–54 Interestingly, the stabilization of the LUMO orbital of the bipyridine is less marked when the spacer is connected on the 4 position (D1p or D2p) compared to the 5 position of bipyridine (D1m or D2m). This suggests a longer π-conjugation length when the bipyridine is substituted on the 5 position, probably due to a higher spin density of the LUMO orbital at this position and the larger number of mesomer structures between the pyridines and the oligo(phenyleneethynylene) spacer.55,56

The broad emission band in the above compounds is attributed to the phosphorescence of the triplet MLCT excited-state of the ruthenium complex. At 77 K a vibronic structure typical for 3MLCT emission of Ru(II)polypyridyl complexes is observed (see ref. 25 for spectra of R2m and R1m). In previous studies,25 our spectroscopic data suggested that with a tris(phenylethylene) spacer in the 5-bpy position of the ruthenium complex, the lowest excited-state of the system can be assigned to a triplet π–π* of the spacer.25,51,57–59 In contrast, for the mono- and bis(phenylethylene) complexes the 3MLCT state was the lowest excited state. Referring to previous work, the lowest excited state is 3MLCT in all of the present dyads.25

This can be explained by the inductive effect of the methyl substituents on the bipyridines of D1p and D2p that destabilize the π(t2g) HOMO orbitals and decrease the energy gap with the π* LUMO orbital on the bipyridine, whereas the longer π-conjugation of the bpy with the bridge in D2m and D1m stabilizes the LUMO orbitals, but to an overall lower extent.The emission lifetime measurements, made in degassed acetonitrile solution, indicate a significant shortening of the MLCT emission in the dyads D1p, D1m, D2p and D2m compared to those in the reference complexes (Table 3). The quenching rate of the ruthenium by the NBI decreases in the following order D1p > D2m > D1m > D2p.In dyads D1p, D2p and D2m, the transient absorption shows only the features of the initial 3MLCT state, which decays with the same time constant as the emission decay. Therefore, in the dyads D1p, D2p and D2m the most plausible interpretation of the results is an electron transfer process leading to RuIII–NBI−, which recombines with a faster rate than that of its formation. This is in analogy to our previous study of D1p and a related dyad, but where the electron transfer products were sufficiently long-lived to be detected. In the dyad D1m the decay of the emission and transient absorption signals are instead biexponential. A global fit to the transients at 360–700 nm gave time constants of 120 and 420 ns. The initial spectrum is identical to that for the R1p reference, while the spectrum that emerges after the faster phase can be assigned to a mix of the original 3MLCT state and the 3NBI state (Fig. 2). These two species decay simultaneously with a 420 ns time constant. The transient traces around 480 nm show a clear rise-and-decay behavior as the 3NBI is formed and then disappears.60 The results are consistent with electron transfer from the 3MLCT state to the NBI unit, in parallel to excited state equilibration by triplet energy transfer between the 3MCLT and 3NBI states. After equilibration the excited states are depopulated by further electron transfer via the 3MLCT state (Scheme 3). From a kinetic analysis in the Appendix, the individual rate constants can be calculated to give kET = 5 × 106 s−1, while the charge recombination (kCR) is again much faster so that no charge separated state can be observed, just as for the other dyads.

Inset: transient absorption traces of the same experiments, at (from top to bottom) 450, 580, 480, 670 and 370 nm.  Scheme 3  Reaction scheme for D1m after MLCT excitation of the ruthenium complex. The ratio of the energy transfer rate constants kEnT and k−EnT in Scheme 3 is close to unity, which means that the 3MLCT and 3NBI states in D1m lie at very similar energy. For the dyads D1p and D2p, linked in the 4-bpy position, the 3MLCT states are lower in energy. This can explain why energy transfer to form 3NBI was not observed in D1p and D2p. Also for D2m, which is linked in the 5-bpy position, the 3MLCT should be slightly lower than in D1m, due to the longer π-delocalization on the bridge (as evidenced by the lower reduction potential of bipy in D2m than in D1m, Table 2) and we did not obtain clear evidence for energy transfer in D2m. A minor transient component (5%) with a longer, ca. 1000 ns lifetime, was indeed observed, but the signal was small and the lifetime was similar to that for the reference, so we could not determine if there was any 3NBI contribution or if it can be attributed to a minor, unquenched 3MCLT population. In any case, the small magnitude means that the possible effect on the calculated rate constant for electron transfer in D2m is small, giving an error of at most 10%.The normal distance dependence of the electron transfer rate in D1p and D2p is an interesting contrast to the results of the other two dyads. If the putative, more bridge-localized state responsible for the distance-independent electron transfer in D2m and D1m were just another 3MLCT state, one could expect that its energy would also be lower for D1p and D2p, and that therefore it would be just as thermally accessible. Instead, if it is more a bridge-localized π–π* state, its energy should be almost independent of anchoring position. Thus, it would be somewhat higher lying relative to the energy of 3MLCT state in D1p and D2p and as a result they should not be as easily populated as in D2m and D1m. Indeed, the 30× difference in rate for the former, with a distance difference of 8 Å, is consistent with a distance decay factor “β” of 0.4 Å−1, which is normal for a super-exchange mediated electron transfer with this chromophore-conjugated bridge combination.20,61Note added in proof: Harriman and co-workers62 have pointed out the importance of bending flexibility of the phenylethenyl bridges. They presented molecular modeling simulations suggesting that the Ru(bpy)3 and C60 moieties in a Ru–C60 dyad bridged by one phenylethenyl unit frequently come into van der Waals contact, and suggested that electron and energy transfer processes may occur through close through-space contact and not through the bridge. While this may be correct for the shorter bridge, a close contact is not possible in the dyads with two or three bridge units, however. The flexibility of the bridge can therefore not explain the distance independent reaction rates in the series of 5-bpy bridged Ru-C60 presented earlier25 or in the Ru–NBI dyads presented here.ConclusionThe preparation and characterizations of three new dyads composed of a ruthenium trisbipyridine complex and a naphthalene bisimide electron acceptor are described. In the three dyads D1p, D2m and D2p the ruthenium trisbipyridine sensitizer decays almost exclusively by an electron transfer instead of an energy transfer process as observed in our previous systems in which the NBI was replaced by the fullerene.25 As a result, these new dyads constitute a significant improvement over the previous ones. The present results show the following effects of the structural variations of the dyads discussed in the introduction. First, the replacement of C60 with NBI as acceptor makes energy transfer less probable and opens for charge separation reactions. Second, the alternation between 4- and 5-bpy substitutions shows different effects that can be related both to the intrinsic difference in bridge-chromophore coupling and to the proximity of the 3MLCT, 3NBI and bridge excited states: on the one hand, the electronic coupling is stronger via the 4-bpy than via the 5-bpy position. This is shown by comparison of the two dyads with the short links, where D1p shows a faster electron transfer than D1m. On the other hand, the dyads with the longer bridges show the opposite behavior: electron transfer is much faster in the 5-bpy substituted dyad D2m. This leads to the interesting observation that while the 4-bpy linked dyads show a 30-fold slower electron transfer with addition of another phenyleneethylene group, electron transfer is equally fast in D2m and D1m, in spite of the 8 Å difference in distance. The near-independence on electron transfer distance in the 5-bpy linked dyads parallels our previous results on triplet energy transfer in the analogous 5-bpy linked Ru–C60 dyads.25 We concluded in that paper, based on various spectroscopic data, that the lowest excited-state of the Ru-bridge system was gradually shifted more onto the bridge as the latter became longer, which could explain the observed near-independence on bridge length on the energy transfer rate. In the present study we seem to observe an analogous effect for electron transfer. In summary, we showed within these series of dyads that subtle structural changes result in significant modifications of the rate and of the mechanism of electron transfer from the ruthenium complex to NBI. More precisely, the energy level of the 3MLCT* and/or the electronic coupling, which can be tuned by changing the length of the spacer, its anchoring position or the presence of the methyl groups on the bpy, govern the feasibility of the energy transfer to NBI. This information can be useful for the future design of photomolecular systems for photoinduced charge separation with ruthenium trisbipyridine sensitizer. Interestingly, the dyad D2m containing the bis(phenylethynylene) spacer appended in the 5-position of the bipyridine represents a potentially useful molecular basis to build multicomponent systems for long-range photoinduced charge separation since long range electron transfer occurs with a high quantum yield at room temperature in acetonitrile (86%).AppendixDerivation of the rate constants for D1m according to Scheme 3The reaction scheme has the following solution:63,64 θ1 + θ2 = k0 + kET + kEnT + k−EnT(A1) −(k0 + kET) − (1 + NMLCT/NNBI)kEnT + (1 + NNBI/NMLCT)k−EnT(A2)where θ1 and θ2 are the experimentally observed rate constants 8.3 × 106 and 2.4 × 106 s−1, respectively, and the ratios are the relative populations of the 3MLCT and 3NBI states. We determined the difference in extinction coefficient for the 3MLCT state at 570 nm as Δε = 8 × 103 M−1 cm−1 by comparison with the 450 nm bleach of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (Δε = 1.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1)65 under the same conditions in flash photolysis experiments. Also for 3NBI at 480 nm Δε = 8 × 103 M−1 cm−1.60 With these values we determined that the relative population of these states after establishment of quasi-equilibrium is about unity (dashed spectrum in Fig. 2). In the scheme the only quenching of 3MLCT emission is due to the competition between kET and k0. With k0 = 9 × 105 s−1 as in the reference R1m, and from the relative emission yield Φrel = k0/(k0 + kET) = 0.27, we obtain kET = 3 × 106 s−1. From eqn (A1) and (A2), and the condition kEnT = k−EnT, we then obtain a value of 3 × 106 s−1 for the latter two rate constants.The time-resolved emission data show that about 2/3 of the emitted photons lie in the 420 ns component (from the integrated areas under the emission traces), which means that about 2/3 of the initially formed excited state remains after the 120 ns phase. With the approximately equal concentrations of 3MLCT and 3NBI states at quasi-equilibrium one would expect to see a 3MLCT transient signal, just when equilibrium is obtained, that is about 1/3 of the initial signal. This is indeed the case (Fig. 2). This good agreement suggests that electron transfer from the 3NBI state is negligible and gives a posteriori support for Scheme 3. The accuracy of the value determined for kET is obviously less than for a direct observation in the absence of complicating parallel reactions. Nevertheless, the corresponding time constant of ca. 300 ns, as reported in Table 3, is clearly not shorter than for D2m with the longer bridge.
