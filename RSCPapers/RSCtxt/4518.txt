    , Accepted 26th April 2022First published on 27th April 2022AbstractRecently, selenium (Se) has regained interest as a possible wide-bandgap photovoltaic material for silicon-based tandem applications. However, the easy sublimation of Se below the melting point (220 °C) brings challenges for high-quality Se thin films. Herein, we design a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) method to balance the contradiction between the sublimation and crystallization of Se thin films. Through optimizing the annealing temperature, a high-quality Se thin film is obtained with a large grain size (∼1 μm) and preferred [003] orientation during the RTA process. Then, an optimized efficiency of 3.22% is achieved in a ZnO/Se heterojunction solar cell. This study provides a new guide to obtain high-quality Se thin film by RTA and the method can be extended to other materials with high saturated vapor pressure.
Introduction
Recently, selenium (Se) solar cells have regained interest as attractive candidates for top cells in Si-based tandem applications.1,2 Se enjoys a direct bandgap (∼1.8 eV)3 and high absorption (104 cm−1),4 allowing a high theoretical efficiency of ∼25% and ∼40% for single-junction and Si-based tandem solar cells, respectively.5–8 Moreover, its stable single-element component, high saturated vapor pressure (1.1 Pa @ 250 °C) and low melting point (220 °C) enable a simple, low-cost and scalable solar cell fabrication,9 and it is also compatible with monolithic Si-based solar cells.10,11 Many efforts have been made to promote the performance of Se solar cells, including through fabrication methods, device structuring, and bandgap alignment. To reduce the fabrication cost, Ito et al. and Zhu et al. have explored new ways to prepare Se films using electrochemical deposition and solution spin-coating methods, respectively.11,12 The n-type buffer layer of the Se solar cell has been developed from the toxic CdSe and CdO to the environmentally-friendly TiO2 and ZnMgO.13–16 The problem of the bandgap of Se (1.8–2.0 eV),3,17 being larger than the optimal bandgap of the single-junction solar cell (1.2–1.4 eV),8 has also been successfully solved by Hadar et al. through alloying Se with tellurium (Te, bandgap of 0.33 eV).18 So far, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a Se solar cell has been boosted to 6.5% by Todorov et al. on FTO/ZnMgO/Se/MoOx/Au.16 This progress confirms that Se is a promising photovoltaic material.
In the development of Se solar cells, the easy sublimation of Se is a common dilemma that is often discussed in this field. High-quality Se thin films, fundamental for high-performance devices, often require thermal treatment to obtain high crystallinity. However, the Se atoms can easily escape from the Se thin films, which can result in deterioration during the thermal treatment process.16 This causes a series of challenges for the preparation of high-quality Se thin films and hinders the high performance of Se thin-film solar cells. In particular, the research on the 6.5% record Se solar cell also mentions that the sublimation property can lead to porous Se thin films if no Te interface modified layer is present. Although Te can improve the adhesion of Se thin films to some extent, the thickness of the Te layer should be carefully controlled. Otherwise, the device performance will degrade, increasing the complexity of the device preparation to some extent. This is still not the best way to solve the sublimation problem of Se during the annealing process. Therefore, developing a new thermal treatment to obtain high-quality Se thin films is of great importance, which requires particular attention to balance the sublimation and crystallization processes. Considering that a period of high-temperature treatment is necessary for high-crystallinity Se films, we can minimize the impact of sublimation by shortening the heat-up time.
Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is an effective method to obtain high-quality thin films and has been widely applied in thin-film devices.19–22 Using this method, thin films can reach a high temperature within seconds to grow grains and crystallize, obtaining high crystallinity and also avoiding unnecessary reaction processes. For Se thin films, the RTA technique can provide the desired energy for crystallization, and meanwhile, the rapid heating treatment process can avoid sublimation because of the short annealing time. Therefore, RTA is an approach ideally suited to the preparation of high-quality Se thin films and high-performance solar cells.
In this work, we designed RTA for high-quality Se thin films and fabricated solar cells based on the RTA treated Se thin films. The amorphous Se thin films were deposited by a thermal evaporation method. Afterwards, the RTA of Se thin films was carried out in a furnace with a high heating up rate (20 K s−1) based on tungsten halide lamps. Through optimizing the RTA temperature, we obtained a compact and highly crystalline Se thin film with a large grain size (∼1 μm). In addition, the [003]-preferred orientation of the Se thin film was induced by the [002]-oriented ZnO buffer layer during the RTA process. Based on the ITO/ZnO/Se/Au device configuration, we achieved a PCE of 3.22%. We also performed physical characterizations on the champion device and provide research directions for the performance optimization of Se solar cells. We believe this RTA technique can be extended to other chalcogenide photovoltaics with high saturated vapor pressure, such as Sb2Se3, GeSe, etc.21,23,24
Results and discussion
For easy understanding, we give a brief overview of the Se film preparation process. Firstly, amorphous Se thin films were deposited on the glass/ITO/ZnO substrates by thermal evaporation (Fig. 1a), which are dark red and semi-transparent (inset of Fig. 2a). Then, an RTA process was designed to obtain highly crystalline Se thin films. Fig. 1b shows the schematic diagram of the RTA equipment. The RTA consists of three main parts: the inlet system (left), the heating system (middle) and the pump system (right). The pump system is designed to create a vacuum environment, avoiding oxidation of the samples by water vapor and oxygen in the air. Inert gas can be introduced into the heating system from the inlet, creating a high-pressure and inert atmosphere. The heating system is a core part of the RTA. The quartz tube constitutes a chamber, and the halogen lamps are used as a heating source because of their rapid heating rate. An unsealed graphite box supported by a quartz holder is employed to ensure a uniform temperature during the annealing process.

The as-deposited amorphous Se thin films were placed in the graphite box. Before annealing, the chamber was pumped below 8 Pa using a mechanical pump. Then, nitrogen was introduced to the chamber for 5 minutes to remove the water vapor and oxygen, which can reduce the oxidation of Se thin films during the annealing process. Considering the high saturated vapor pressure of Se, we needed to create a high ambient pressure to suppress the sublimation of Se during the annealing. Therefore, the mechanical pump was turned off before annealing, and nitrogen was kept supplied until the pressure of the chamber returned to one-atmosphere pressure (105 Pa), generating a high-pressure inert atmosphere. Subsequently, the halogen lamps were turned on to heat the Se thin films. Fig. 1c illustrates the heating curve of the full procedure of RTA treatment. It consists of a rapid heating-up process from room temperature to the target temperature at a rate of 20 °C s−1, an annealing process at the target temperature for 120 seconds, and a rapid cooling process within 30 seconds. The rapid heating-up of the RTA can reduce the thermal decomposition of the Se thin films and also provide enough energy to ensure high crystallinity. After RTA treatment, the Se thin film turned from dark red and semi-transparent to dark gray and opaque (Fig. 2c, for example), indicating the transition from the amorphous to the crystalline state.
In our designed RTA process, the annealing temperature is one of the key factors that determine the crystallinity of Se thin films. So, we set a series of annealing temperatures (80 °C, 120 °C, 150 °C, 170 °C, and 180 °C) to explore the optimal RTA temperature. From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Se thin films, we notice that below 80 °C, the Se films crystallize slowly and have a small grain size, showing a surface morphology (Fig. 2b) similar to that of amorphous Se films (Fig. 2a). The Se thin film annealed at 80 °C (the inset in Fig. 2b) demonstrates a darker-red color than that of the unannealed film (the inset in Fig. 2a). When the annealing temperature reaches 120 °C, the crystallization of the Se film is evident and the grain boundaries formed by the fusion of grains can be observed. The film also obviously turns dark grey and opaque (the inset of Fig. 2c). It is probable that this temperature is not high enough to allow the grains to fuse sufficiently, so the grains have an irregular shape and the film is not smooth and compact. At higher annealing temperatures, the small grains of the Se thin films gradually grow. The Se thin films annealed at 150 °C and 170 °C demonstrate more smooth and compact (Fig. 2d and e) grains than that annealed at 120 °C. The surface of Se thin films also becomes light grey (the insets in Fig. 2d and e). Moreover, it can be seen from Fig. S1a and b† that the Se films treated with RTA are more flat and compacted than those treated with conventional thermal annealing at the same 170 °C. This may be attributed to the fact that RTA can effectively reduce the sublimation of Se and minimize its effects on the surface morphology. While annealing at 180 °C, the Se thin films are quickly thermally decomposed and re-evaporated from the substrate (the inset in Fig. 2f) due to the high saturated vapor pressure of Se and the high annealing temperature. Thus, to ensure high crystallization and no thermal decomposition, the optimal annealing temperature of Se thin film can be from 150 °C to 170 °C.
We further carried out XRD to characterize the crystallinity of Se thin films. Fig. 3a exhibits the XRD patterns of the as-deposited and annealed (at temperatures of 80 °C, 120 °C, 150 °C and 170 °C) Se thin films. The XRD of the Se films shows intense peaks at high annealing temperatures (150 °C and 170 °C), indicating an improved crystallinity. In addition, we measured the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peaks, which is another important criterion of crystallinity. Generally, a smaller FWHM means better crystallinity. As the annealing temperature increases, the trend towards a smaller FWHM indicates the enhanced crystallinity of the Se thin films (Fig. 3c), consistent with the SEM observations. The minimum FWHM corresponds to the RTA 170 °C treatment. In this respect, the optimized annealing temperature of the Se thin films is 170 °C. At this temperature (170 °C), Se enjoys a high saturated vapor pressure (0.09 Pa @ 170 °C),9 so the Se atoms have a high risk of sublimating from the surface, which may lead to the degradation of the Se thin films during annealing. This contradiction can be well addressed by our RTA. Thanks to the rapid heating-up of the RTA, the Se thin films can achieve high crystallinity and avoid serious sublimation at high annealing temperatures. Moreover, we notice that the Se thin films demonstrate high intensities of [hkl] (l ≠ 0) orientations (like [003] and [112]) at high annealing temperatures. We carefully calculated the texture coefficient of each [hkl] orientation (Fig. 3b). The results show that the Se thin films prefer [hkl] (l ≠ 0) orientations ([003], in particular) at high annealing temperatures. We infer that the orientation of the substrate and the high annealing temperature contribute to these oriented Se films, which has been demonstrated in other one-dimensional materials, such as Sb2Se3.25–28 First, the deposited Se film can react with the ZnO substrate at the ZnO/Se interface to form Zn–Se bonds (Fig. S2a†). Induced by the ZnO substrate with a [002] orientation, the Se atoms involved in bonding at the ZnO/Se interface tend to form [hkl]-oriented (l ≠ 0) crystalline nuclei. Then, during the RTA process at high temperatures, Se atoms gain enough energy to migrate. The migrating Se atoms prefer to bond with [hkl]-oriented (l ≠ 0) crystalline nuclei, and form [hkl]-oriented (l ≠ 0) films. During this procedure, our RTA can not only provide energy for the migration of Se atoms, but also inhibit the sublimation of Se. So, RTA is a promising approach to achieving the [hkl] (l ≠ 0) orientation of Se thin films. Moreover, the orientations of thin films usually affect the carrier transport, especially for one-dimensional materials such as Se and Sb2Se3.29–32 According to the measurements of Chan et al., the hole mobility parallel to the Se chains is about 10 times higher than that in the perpendicular direction.33 Comparing the atomic configurations of the different crystal planes of the Se films (Fig. 3d), we notice that the Se chains corresponding to the [hkl] (l ≠ 0) orientations grow obliquely or vertically to the substrate. Therefore, the Se films on the [002]-oriented ZnO substrates have more efficient carrier transport in the vertical direction to the substrate after RTA treatment.

After the RTA process, the absorption edge of Se films demonstrates a redshift, corresponding to a decreased bandgap from 2.16 eV to 1.77 eV (Fig. 4a). The decrease of the bandgap suggests the enhancement of the crystallinity of the Se films after annealing. Notably, the Se thin film shows a strong sub-gap absorption at 1.41 eV (Fig. S6†). This could be attributed to the oxidation of Se films during annealing.34 Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) characterization was carried out to further determine the positions of the valence band (VB), conduction band (CB) and Fermi level of the Se thin film after RTA treatment. From the UPS spectrum (Fig. 4b), a Fermi level of 4.74 eV is derived from the extrapolation of the high kinetic energy cutoff of the spectrum, which is subtracted from the incident photon energy of 21.21 eV. Then, we can obtain the difference between the valence band energy and the Fermi level by fitting the low energy region (0.64 eV, inset in Fig. 4b). Thus, the VB is located at 5.38 eV. The CB of Se thin films is estimated to be 3.61 eV, combined with the 1.77 eV bandgap. The Fermi level is closer to the VB, which confirms the intrinsic p-type conduction of the Se thin films. This p-type Se thin film needs an n-type buffer layer to construct a p–n junction solar cell. Here, the n-type ZnO would be a promising candidate. Firstly, the n-type ZnO enjoys high electron mobility (>150 cm2 V s−1), a wide bandgap of 3.2 eV, and a low synthesis temperature (magnetron sputtering at room temperature), allowing good electron transport and high transmittance.35,36 More importantly, the energy level of the ZnO buffer layer is well-matched with that of the p-type Se thin film (Fig. 4c),37 so the photogenerated carriers can be transported to the ZnO buffer layer and be collected by the electrode. In addition, during the RTA process, the sputtered ZnO thin film can induce a [hkl]-oriented (l ≠ 0) Se thin film and benefit the transport of carriers as mentioned before. ITO is selected as the bottom electrode, and Au is employed as the top electrode to ensure ohmic contact. So far, we have constructed a complete Se solar cell, and the corresponding structure diagram is presented in Fig. 4d.

To obtain more morphological details about the device, we took a cross-section SEM image of the Se solar cell (Fig. 5a). The Se absorber layer after RTA is about 700 nm and demonstrates large and bottom-up grains on the ZnO substrate. The columnar structure of the grains echoes the [hkl] (l ≠ 0) orientations mentioned before, which ought to benefit the carrier transport along the Se chains. We measured the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the ZnO/Se solar cells under dark conditions and simulated AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 5b). In the dark J–V curve, a rollover beyond ca. 0.7 V can be observed, which can be ascribed to the reaction at the ZnO/Se interface to form the ZnSe layer (Fig. S2a and b†). From the illuminated J–V curve, a PCE of 3.22%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 639 mV, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 9.90 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 50.93% can be extracted. The high external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of >70% in the range of 420–600 nm can be attributed to the appropriate [hkl](l ≠ 0) orientation of the Se thin film (Fig. 5c). However, the maximum EQE value is less than 80%, which may be related to the ZnSe barrier at the ZnO/Se interface. The absorption cutoff edge of the EQE curve is 700 nm, consistent with the fitted bandgap. We noticed that the VOC of the Se solar cells is much lower than the bandgap, indicating a high energy loss. Then, we performed capacitance–voltage (C–V) and drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) characterizations and calculated the carrier densities of NA,CV = 1.23 × 1016 cm−3 and NA,DLCP = 5.48 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The high difference between NA,CV and NA,DLCP (Fig. 5d) is 6.82 × 1015 cm−3, suggesting a high density of interface defects in the ZnO/Se solar cells.

Compared with the SQ limit eficiency6,7 and the record device16 (device-performance data is shown in Table S1†), the large loss of VOC can be attributed to the nonradiative recombination caused by the sub-gap absorption of the Se film. This problem could be solved by finer deoxidation measures for our RTA. The less attractive fill factor is another limit of the PCE, which could be ascribed to the large series resistance (15.3 Ω cm2) and the small shunt resistance (419.13 Ω cm2). The reason for the high series resistance could be the imperfect contact between the Se thin film and the Au electrode, and the small shunt resistance indicates the necessity to passivate the interface defects and promote the compactness of the Se films. Considering the significant improvement of the record device by the usage of MoOx, we could expect the enhancement of the VOC, JSC and FF of our Se cell after the employment of a suitable hole transport layer (HTL) in the future.
By further promotion of the device performance, our Se solar cell would be a competitive candidate for application in tandem solar cells. The Se film can be fabricated directly on the Si bottom cell through the thermal evaporation method. The p-type homojunction Si cell (e.g. the p-type PERC) could be employed as the bottom cell due to the well-established synthesis method and high-temperature resistance (up to 400 °C). Upon the Se absorption layer, the electron transport layer (ETL) and the ITO electrode can be prepared sequentially (Fig. S4†). Overall, our Se solar cell is very suitable for integration with Si bottom cells.
Conclusion
In summary, the balance of the sublimation and crystallinity of Se thin films was realized through the RTA technique. After RTA treatment, the Se films were smooth, compact and uniform, with a large grain size (∼1 μm). Moreover, the Se films had a preferred [003] orientation, benefitting the efficient carrier transport. Finally, the ITO/ZnO/Se/Au solar cell achieved a PCE of 3.22%. The C–V and DLCP characterizations indicate an inadequate interface state of the Se solar cell. Therefore, the future optimization direction should focus on interface passivation and the selection of the HTL. Overall, the RTA approach is well suited to chalcogenide solar cells with high saturated vapor pressure.
Experimental
Solar cell fabrication
Commercially purchased ITO glass (25 mm × 25 mm × 2 mm, Liaoning Best New Energy Technology Co. Ltd) was continuously ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, isopropanol, and ethanol for 15 minutes before use, and the thickness of ITO was about 200 nm (15 Ω □−1, transmittance over 89%). Before depositing the Se film, a layer of ZnO with a thickness of about 200 nm was prepared by magnetron sputtering (JCP500, Technol Science; O:Ar = 1:99 atmosphere) as an n-type buffer layer. An amorphous Se thin film with a thickness of 700 nm (active area 15 mm × 25 mm) was deposited by thermal evaporation (Kurt J. Lesker, ∼5 × 10−3 Pa, 2.5 Å s−1) on the ZnO buffer layer using 99.99% pure Se powder (Sigma Aldrich).
Amorphous Se thin films were annealed by a rapid thermal processing system (RTP, OTF-1200X-RTP, Hefei), as shown in Fig. S5a.† Before annealing, the substrate was placed in an unsealed graphite box (internal dimensions: Φ = 70 mm, h = 15 mm, and an internal volume of about 5.8 × 104 mm3, Fig. S5b and c†), and the quartz tube chamber was first evacuated to 5 Pa with a mechanical pump and then filled with high-purity nitrogen at a small flow rate. The chamber pressure was kept at high pressure (105 Pa) during the annealing process. The temperature was set at 80 °C, 120 °C, 150 °C, 170 °C and 180 °C for the different annealing processes. After annealing, the Se thin film was attached with a mask for the preparation of pattern electrodes. Finally, 80 nm thick gold electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation (TEMD-600, Technol Science) on the annealed Se thin films to construct solar cells. Nine separated Au electrodes were prepared on each sample. The area of the square gold electrode was 0.09 cm2. The spacing between electrodes was about 3 mm.
Material characterizations
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, GeminiSEM, Zeiss, with Pt coating) was carried out to observe the morphologies and cross-sections of the Se thin films. The orientations of the Se films were characterized from the X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (Philips, X pert pro-MRD). The optical transmittance of Se thin-films was detected on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Instruments, Lambda 950 using integrating sphere). The CB, VB and Fermi level of the Se films were measured using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600 W, Kratos, HeI excitation, 21.21 eV, referenced to the Fermi edge of argon etched gold).
Device characterizations
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the Se solar cells were characterized using a source meter (Keithley 2400) under dark conditions and simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination (Oriel®, Model 9119, Newport, calibrated with a standard silicon cell). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) characterization was performed using a light source generated by a Newport 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel®, 69911), which was split into a specific wavelength using a Newport Oriel® Cornerstone™ 130 1/8 Monochromator (Oriel®, model 74004). The capacitance–voltage (C–V) and drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) were measured using Keithley 4200. C–V measurements were performed at room temperature in an electromagnetic shielding box at a frequency of 70 kHz and a.c. amplitude of 30 mV. The d.c. bias voltage was swept from −1.2 V to 0.6 V. DLCP measurements were performed with the a.c. amplitude varied from 14 mV to 140 mV and the d.c. bias from −0.4 V to 0.55 V.
