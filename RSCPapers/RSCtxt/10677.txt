    , Accepted 7th May 2014First published on 7th May 2014AbstractTwo new triphenylamine-based hole-transporting materials (HTMs) containing butadiene derivatives are employed in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells. Up to 11.63% of power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been achieved. Advantages such as easy synthesis, low cost and relatively good cell performance exhibit a possibility for commercial applications in the future.
Organolead halide perovskites have attracted much interest due to their outstanding advantages such as direct band gap, large absorption coefficient and high carrier mobility.1,2 In 2009, T. Miyasaka pioneered organolead halide perovskites as sensitizers in liquid-type sensitized solar cells with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3.13% for CH3NH3PbBr3 and 3.81% for CH3NH3PbI3, which were further improved to 6.5% by N.-G. Park.3,4 Over the last two years, solid-state organolead halide perovskite thin film solar cells have been developed rapidly, and an unexpected breakthrough has been achieved.5,6 It is expected that the perovskite solar cells are comparable to conventional thin film solar cells (Cu(In,Ga)Se2, CdTe). To date, perovskite solar cells with and without hole-transporting materials (HTMs) have been developed. The perovskite solar cells without HTMs exhibit a PCE of over 10%,7 whereas the corresponding devices with HTMs can exhibit much higher efficiencies of over 16%.8 The use of HTMs is often perceived to impart some advantages to the cells, mainly facilitating the hole transport to the metal anode and blocking the electron transfer from perovskites to metal anodes as well.
Different HTMs have already been demonstrated to work well in perovskite solar cells. First, a few polymer HTMs were successfully applied in these kinds of solar cells, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), poly-triarylamine (PTAA), poly[2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]] (PCPDTBT) and so on.9–12 Typically, the perovskite solar cells with PTAA exhibited a PCE of 12%.9 Moreover, low molecular weight amorphous HTMs are also good candidates due to their easy purification and good film-forming properties simply processed by coating techniques. Based on state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine]-9,9′-spirobi fluorene) as the HTM, M. Grätzel,13 H. J. Snaith14 and T. L. Kelly15 obtained PCEs of over 15% by using different mesoporous scaffolds or planar heterojunction structures, respectively. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells with pyrene arylamine derivatives presented 12.4% PCE.16 Besides organic HTMs, inorganic hole conductors like CuI with higher conductivity in the perovskite solar cells were also explored, achieving 6% PCE.17 However, current HTMs for these kinds of solar cells suffer from high cost or unsatisfactory cell performance, both of which are disadvantageous for future commercialization. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new HTMs for stable, highly efficient and cost-effective perovskite solar cells.
Suitable HTMs for perovskite solar cells should primarily meet the following requirements: (1) good hole mobility; (2) a compatible HOMO energy level relative to organolead halide perovskites and (3) low cost for commercialization. The triphenylamine entities with butadiene derivatives are known to have high hole mobility and good film-forming properties, which were applied in organic photoconductors (OPCs).18 In this respect, two new triphenylamine-based hole conductors containing butadiene derivatives have been used in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells for the first time, namely 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadienyl)-N,N-di(4-tolyl)-phenylamine (denoted as HTM1) and 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadienyl)-N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-phenylamine (denoted as HTM2), as shown in Fig. 1(a). Under AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), the PCEs of 11.63% for HTM2 and 11.34% for HTM1 have been achieved, in comparison with the PCE of the cell employing spiro-OMeTAD (12.08%). Our preliminary results reveal that both HTM1 and HTM2 are promising alternatives to spiro-OMeTAD. And they are quite cheap for potential commercialization.

HTM1 and HTM2 were synthesized by the Wittig–Horner reaction, and detailed procedures for the syntheses and characterization can be found in our previous work.18 Their absorption band maxima are located in the visible region, at 451 nm for HTM1 and at 471 nm for HTM2. At room temperature, their hole transporting mobilities were evaluated by time-of-flight (TOF) transient hole-current measurement, which are 2.98 × 10−3 for HTM1 and 1.27 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1 for HTM2. The energy levels of HTM1 and HTM2 were determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, as shown in Fig. 1(b). It is thus deduced that different p-position substituents (electron-donating ability –OCH3 > –CH3) on phenyl rings of the triphenylamine part do not strongly influence their energy levels, since triphenylamine and butadiene derivatives form a large π-conjugated system. Moreover, both HTMs have a suitable HOMO level in comparison to the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV), suggesting good HTMs for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells.
For fabricating the device (see Fig. 1(c)), a 50 nm thick TiO2 compact layer and a 400 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 anatase layer were deposited on the FTO glass in sequence according to the literature.5 CH3NH3PbI3 was subsequently deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 film by using a sequential method as reported.13 HTMs with appropriate concentrations were spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film at 3000 rpm for 20 s, and an 80 nm thickn Au layer was finally deposited on the top of the HTM layer by thermal evaporation. For comparison, the device with spiro-OMeTAD was also fabricated under the same conditions. Fig. 1(d) shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI, XL30 S-FEG) image of the FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM2 film in 120 mg mL−1 HTM solution. We can see that CH3NH3PbI3 is evenly distributed in TiO2 mesoscopic pores. A 271 nm thick HTM2 capping layer can be observed, whereas no obvious capping layer formed when 20 mg mL−1 HTM2 was used.

Fig. 2(a) shows photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of three cells with different HTMs. All of the three HTM films were obtained from a 20 mg mL−1 solution in chlorobenzene. We can see that, when new HTMs are introduced into the device, the PCEs are 11.34% for HTM1 with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 18.1 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 921 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.68 and 11.63% for HTM2 with a Jsc of 17.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 942 mV and a FF of 0.69, respectively. These parameters are comparable to those of spiro-OMeTAD-based perovskite solar cells obtained under the same fabrication conditions, with a Jsc of 18.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 936 mV, and a FF of 0.69, yielding a PCE of 12.08%, in agreement with photovoltaic parameters reported by S. I. Seok.19 The Voc of the devices with HTM2 and spiro-OMeTAD are close, in agreement with their similar HOMO levels, since the theoretical Voc is determined by the difference in the quasi-Fermi levels of the electrons in the TiO2 and the holes in the HTM. However, the Voc of the HTM1-based device is slightly lower, which is abnormal since its HOMO level is relatively lower, see Table S1 (ESI†). The origin of this phenomenon is still not fully understood so far, however, the dependence of the Voc on the HTMs is also influenced by charge recombination kinetics.16 The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the cell with HTM2 is presented in Fig. 2(b).20 An integral photocurrent from the overlap of the IPCE spectrum is 15.8 mA cm−2, basically in agreement with the experimentally obtained Jsc. Besides, the above results further confirm that the two substituents (–CH3 and –OCH3) do not strongly influence their HOMO levels and the cell performance. So, we will take HTM2 as an example to further investigate the properties of the cell in the following discussion.

The concentration of the HTMs: 20 mg mL−1 solution in chlorobenzene; (c) plot of the Jsc of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells with HTM2vs. light densities; (d) J–V curves for the perovskite solar cells with different HTM2 concentrations. 
The dependence of Jsc of the device with HTM2 on light densities was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the Jsc is linearly proportional to light density, indicating that the charge collection efficiency of the device is independent of light intensities. According to previous investigations, it is suggested that no space-charge limit exists in the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM2 junction due to the small difference in the mobility between electrons and holes.5,21
In order to investigate the influence of the HTM2 deposition amount on the cell performance, a series of perovskite solar cells were fabricated by varying the spin coating concentration. As shown in Fig. 2(d), with the increasing HTM spin coating concentration, the HTM2 overlayer gets thicker from unclear to 271 nm; however, the cell performance gets poorer. At higher concentrations, an increase in the capping layer thickness increases the series resistance and causes a decrease of the FF by nearly 50%. The decrease of Voc is mainly due to the increase in the dark current with the increasing HTM film thickness, lowering the electron concentration as well as their Fermi level.5 It is thus deduced that a thin HTM layer facilitates the hole transport as well as the cell performance. Further improvement in the conductivity of the HTM layer as well as the cell performance will be carried out in the future.
To understand the thickness-related influence on the cell performance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out, in which the potential bias was applied from 400 to 900 mV in the dark in the frequency range from 105 to 0.1 Hz (Zahner IM6ex), as shown in Fig. 3(a). According to the simplified transmission line model, the main arc is supposed to be a combination of the recombination resistance (Rrec) and the chemical capacitance of the film (CPEμ), see Fig. S1 (ESI†).17,22,23 By fitting the Nyquist plots, the relationship between the Rrec and the bias voltage is obtained.5 From Fig. 3(b), we can see that (1) for the same device, Rrec drops with the increasing forward bias voltage, mainly because the Fermi level in the mesoscopic TiO2 is elevated at the forward bias (>500 mV) which is beneficial to the easy electron flow across the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface; (2) at the same forward bias voltage, with the increasing thickness of HTM, the Rrec increases greatly in all bias voltage ranges, indicating that a thick capping layer is disadvantageous to the charge transfer.5 Likewise, large Rrec will lead to unsatisfactory cell performance, in good agreement with our test results shown in Fig. 2(d).
 Fig. 3  (a) Nyquist plots of the device with thin layer HTM2 in the dark over different forward biases, scattered point: experimental data, solid line: fitted curves; (b) plots of the recombination resistance (Rrec) vs. bias voltages for the devices with HTM2 of different thicknesses; (c) and (d) PL intensities for CH3NH3PbI3/HTM2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films, respectively, monitored at 775 nm during the transformation. Excitation at 445 nm. 
Furthermore, time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay measurement has been used to research charge transfer at a stable well-defined interface, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). The PL decay time can be obtained after fitting the data with a bi-exponential decay function.24 The TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film exhibits a time constant τ of 195.6 ns. Further introduction of the HTM2 as a quenching layer remarkably facilitates the PL decay with the time constant τ = 1.36 ns. This is due to the diffusion of the photogenerated excitons to the CH3NH3PbI3/HTM2 interface where they are quenched. It is thus suggested that the existence of the CH3NH3PbI3/HTM2 interface is beneficial to the hole transfer, and HTM2 has excellent hole pumping capacity as well.25,26 Finally, the device efficiencies from a batch of ten devices using HTM2 under the same conditions are given in Fig. S2 (ESI†). We can see that all of them show a PCE of over 11% with an average PCE of 11.30%, indicating their good reproducibility. A preliminary stability test was carried out, that is, unsealed cells were kept in the dark under ambient conditions which were tested every day for 7 days. The cells with HTM1 and HTM2 were quite stable, in which PCEs were almost constant with a 0.2% drop for HTM1 and a 0.9% drop for HTM2 compared to their initial PCEs.
In conclusion, we have, for the first time, employed two new triphenylamine-based HTMs containing butadiene derivatives in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells. Both of them show excellent capacity for hole transport, and up to 11.63% efficiency has been achieved for the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells with HTM2. Their typical advantages are easy synthesis, low cost and relatively good cell performance, which may provide a possibility for commercial applications of organolead halide perovskite solar cells in the future.
