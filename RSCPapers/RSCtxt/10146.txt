    , Accepted 20th January 2014First published on 21st January 2014AbstractIn this paper, we report a facile, low-cost synthesis of Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) by heating a mixture of metal salts, sulfur powder, selenium powder, oleylamine and dodecanethiol. The composition of the Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs could be tuned across the x range from 0 to 1 by modulating the molar ratio of the S/Se precursors. The lattice parameters (a and c) of the Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs, calculated from X-ray diffraction patterns, were consistent with Vegard's law, confirming the formation of homogeneous nanocrystals. The X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy results indicated that the as-prepared Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs had a monoclinic structure. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs revealed that the band gap of the nanocrystals could be tailored from 1.55 to 1.87 eV by decreasing the Se content. Additionally, compared with the more commonly used hot injection method, the procedure developed here is highly suitable for large-scale colloidal nanocrystal production, which we tested by performing a gram-scale synthesis.
Introduction
The need to develop low-cost, scalable and solution-processable photovoltaic materials is a leading impetus for research in the field of semiconductor nanocrystal synthesis. Though Cu(In,Ga)Se2 system compounds are well-known as promising candidates for solar energy harvesting materials,1,2 the limited supply and increasing price of indium and gallium have limited the large-scale, cost-effective production of these materials.3 Recently, there is a growing interest in the development of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanocrystals.4–9 Because of their Earth-abundant constituents, optimal band gap, and high absorption coefficient, these Cu-based multicomponent semiconductors were expected to be substitutes for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 materials.10,11 Yet due to the difficulty of controlling the composition and phase of the Cu2ZnSnX4 (X = S or Se) compounds,8 other potential substitute materials, simpler compound systems such as Cu2SnS3 and Cu2SnSe3, have drawn great attention recently.12–20 Cu2SnS3 is a ternary semiconductor with a p-type direct band gap of 0.95–1.35 eV in bulk material, while Cu2SnSe3 has a p-type direct band gap in the range 0.8–1.1 eV.12,17 Both of them possess a high absorption coefficient and high electron and hole mobility. Cu2SnS3-based solar cells have been fabricated and demonstrated a solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.84%.18
Meanwhile, multicomponent semiconductor nanocrystals are of great interest in the manufacture of thin-film solar cells.5,6,21–23 Multicomponent NCs offer the advantage of having tunable structural, optical, electronic, and defect properties that can all influence the photovoltaic properties. Multicomponent NCs synthesized by alloying two constituents may not only inherit the properties of their parent materials but also exhibit new properties distinct from them. It has been reported that a large efficiency increase appeared when an amount of Se is incorporated into a Cu2ZnSnS4 nanocrystal thin film.5 However, it still remains a big challenge to obtain stoichiometric multicomponent semiconductor NCs.23–28 The difficulty in controlling the reactivity of each precursor in the multicomponent system usually results in unwanted side products.
In addition, as mentioned elsewhere,10,21,29 the creation of nanostructured suspension ink for use in a scalable coating process is a key step in the development of low-cost thin-film solar cells. The use of colloidal nanocrystal inks requires the manufacturing of large amounts of NC materials, which calls for large-scale synthesis processes. To date, various synthesis approaches have been developed to prepare semiconductor nanocrystals, such as the hot-injection approach and synthesis by the direct heating of mixtures of precursors.30–32 The hot-injection route, relying on a fast injection of precursors to induce nucleation and growth, is not an ideal option for large-scale synthesis.33,34 Many efforts have been dedicated to developing direct heating procedures.26,35,36 Chiang et al. have reported a facile heating-up synthesis of quaternary CuIn(S1−xSex)2 nanocrystals recently. Manna and co-workers have synthesized composition and band gap tunable CuInxGa1−xS2 nanocrystals via a phosphine-free and scalable procedure. Based on inexpensive, environmentally friendly reagents, a one-spot fast direct solution-phase synthesis approach is highly attractive and applicable for the fabrication of photovoltaic absorber material.
In the present work, we report a facile and up-scalable synthesis of colloidal Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs by heating commercial metal salts (CuCl, SnBr2) in a chalcogen solution containing oleylamine and 1-dodecanethiol. Nanocrystals with controlled compositions ranging from Cu2SnS3 to Cu2SnSe3 through an intermediate Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 with tunable x, could be achieved by tailoring the precursor molar ratios. The as-prepared Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs possess good trends in their lattice parameters and band gap variations when they are modulated by their x-values. A crystallochemical study using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the as-prepared Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs have a monoclinic structure. Furthermore, the feasibility of up-scaling this approach is demonstrated by performing a gram-scale synthesis of Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3 NCs.
Experimental section
Chemicals
All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Tin (II) bromide (SnBr2, 99%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Copper (I) chloride (CuCl, 97%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Cupric acetate (Cu(OAc)2, 99%), selenium powder (99.999%), sulfur powder (99.99%), 1-dodecanethiol (98%), and oleylamine (80–90%) were obtained from Aladdin. Hexane and ethanol (analytical reagents) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works.
Synthesis of Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 nanocrystals
The synthesis of Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 nanocrystals was carried out in oleylamine (OAm) solution by a facile one-pot method. In a typical synthesis, 0.5 mmol SnBr2 (0.1392 g), 1 mmol CuCl (0.099 g), 0.75 mmol selenium powder (0.0592 g) and 0.75 mmol sulfur powder (0.024 g) were loaded into a 100 ml three-neck flask attached to a Schlenk line. Then, 10 mL of OAm and 1 mL of 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) were added. The mixed solution was degassed at 130 °C for 1 h with stirring and purged with argon three times. The temperature was then slowly raised to 240 °C with a ramping rate of 2 °C min−1. The reaction was held at 240 °C for 1 h with continuous vigorous stirring. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, 5 mL of hexane and 25 mL of ethanol were added, and the mixture was sonicated for 5 min to remove all the free ligands and the unreacted precursors. The solution was centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 10 min. The upper layer of liquid was decanted, and the isolated solid was dispersed in hexane and reprecipitated by adding ethanol. The centrifugation and precipitation procedure was repeated three times and the final products were redispersed in hexane or dried under vacuum for further measurements.
For the gram-scale production of Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3 NCs, the synthesis was carried out by dissolving 10 mmol Cu(OAc)2 (1.8164 g), 5 mmol SnBr2 (1.392 g), 7.5 mmol Se (0.5922 g) and 7.5 mmol S (0.24 g) in a solution of 60 mL oleylamine and 6 mL 1-dodecanethiol, degassing under vacuum for 1 h at 130 °C, then heating to 240 °C and keeping at this temperature for 1 h. The resulting product was cooled to room temperature and cleaned three times as described above, and the final NCs were dried under vacuum for further measurements.
Thin films for the characterization of the optoelectronic properties were deposited by spin-casting nanocrystals dispersed in toluene. The fabrication details of the device are as follows: a patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass was used as the substrate and cleaned by successive ultrasonic treatments in acetone and isopropyl alcohol and then dried at 120 °C for 30 min. The ITO glass was then subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 10 min. The Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3 film was fabricated by spin-casting the concentrated nanocrystal–toluene dispersion on the substrate. The substrates were then transferred to an evaporator and pumped down to 4 × 10−4 Pa to deposit 100 nm-thick aluminum (Al) cathodes. Post thermal annealing was carried out at 140 °C for 3 min on a hot plate inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox and the devices were encapsulated for measurement.
Characterization
UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 50 Scan UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian, USA). X-ray power diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D8 Focus diffractometer (Bruker) with a Cu Kα1 radiation source (λ = 0.15406 nm). The composition of the as-prepared Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 nanocrystals was determined quasi-quantitatively by a Hitachi S-4800 high-resolution FE-SEM equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyzer (XP30, Philips), at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL-100CX electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. The samples for scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-EDS were prepared by dropping nanocrystals dispersed in ethanol onto nickel grids. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) was carried out using a STA 449 F3 simultaneous thermal analyzer. I–V curves were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 236 source meter under AM1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
The challenge in synthesising multicomponent semiconductor nanocrystals is the accurate control of their stoichiometric composition. Balancing the reactivity of the relative precursors was found to be the key to producing the desired composition without unwanted side products.26 Cu+ ions are very soft Lewis acids, whereas Sn4+ ions are hard Lewis acids. According to the principle of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB), the chalcogen (S,Se) precursors, being soft Lewis bases, react preferentially with Cu+ rather than Sn4+. When tin bromide and copper chloride were dissolved directly in the pure OAm solution and heated to 240 °C for 1 h in an inert atmosphere, formation of CuSx (x = 1–2), Sn2S3 phases was found (Fig. S1a, ESI†). The different reaction activities of the two cation precursors with anions resulted in a separated nucleus and ultimately phase separation. It has been reported that alkane thiols could suppress the reactivity of the soft Lewis acids effectively.24 Therefore, dodecanethiol was added to our reaction systems. When a combination of precursors with the desired mole ratio was mixed with an OAm solution with 1 mL DDT and reacted at 240 °C for 1 h, Cu2Sn(SxSn1−x)3 quaternary nanocrystals with a controlled S/Se ratio formed (Fig. S1b†). We speculated that when dodecanethiol was added to the reaction, the strong binding of DDT and Cu+ ions gave rise to a relatively slow reaction of the copper ions with the chalcogens, ultimately leading to the formation of homogeneous Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs.
The compositions of the resulting Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 quaternary nanocrystals were determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and the results are listed in Table 1. The Cu:Sn:S:Se mole ratios in the products are in close agreement with the ratios of the precursors. This indicates that the reactivity of the relative precursors was balanced and the successful formation of compositionally tunable Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 quaternary nanocrystals was achieved.

Fig. 1 shows the powder XRD patterns of the Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs. The major diffraction peak shows a systematic shift to higher angles with decreasing Se content, which may have prevented the phase separation or separated nucleation of Cu2SnS3 and Cu2SnSe3 during the growth of the Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs. The shift in the diffraction peaks is attributed to reductions in the lattice constants, which are due to the substitution of significantly smaller S2− for the larger Se2− in the Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 lattices. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the lattice parameters (a and c) of the Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs have a linear relationship with the S composition, which is in agreement with Vegard's law. STEM-EDS elemental mapping of both Cu2Sn(S0.7Se0.3)3 and Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3 nanocrystals confirmed that Cu, Sn, Se, and S were equally distributed in the NCs (Fig. S2, ESI†). These results indicate that we have successfully synthesized alloyed NCs with a homogeneous distribution of S and Se in the Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 matrix.

In the literature,12,14,15,17 various kinds of crystal structures have been reported for Cu2SnS3 and Cu2SnSe3 ternary compounds, such as F3m cubic, I2d tetragonal and C1c1 monoclinic. These crystal phases are quite similar and the difference in these structures exists only in the small superstructure peaks and in the splitting of main peaks. To acquire the crystalline structure of the as-prepared Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs, a close investigation using XRD, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and select area electron diffraction (SAED) on the multicomponent Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 nanocrystals was performed. As shown in Fig. 3, the X-ray diffraction pattern of the as-prepared Cu2SnSe3 NCs is a better fit with the monoclinic structure, compared with the cubic structure. The small peaks at 2θ = 17.22, 19.97, 32.66, 34.33 can be indexed to be the (1), (021), (041), (32) planes of monoclinic Cu2SnSe3, respectively. Fig. 4 shows a HRTEM image of the Cu2SnSe3 nanocrystals and the corresponding fast-Fourier transform (FFT) image. The clear lattice fringes for the whole nanocrystal shown in the HRTEM image indicate that these nanoparticles are all crystalline. The observed d-spacings of 2.00, 3.28, and 1.71 Å are in agreement with the (060), (200), and (260) planes of monoclinic Cu2SnSe3, respectively. Based on the above results, we may possibly conclude that the as-prepared Cu2SnSe3 NCs exhibit a monoclinic structure. Similarly, the as-synthesized Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs can also be assigned to the monoclinic phase (Fig. S3–S5, ESI†).

A typical TEM image of Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs (x = 0.7) is shown in Fig. 5(a). The as-prepared nanocrystals were monodispersed and quasi-spherical. Fig. 5(b–h) show HRTEM images highlighting the lattice fringes of individual Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 nanocrystals representative of the various compositions. As the Se content decreases, the lattice spacings of d(200) in each nanocrystal decrease gradually, which is consistent with the trend in the d-spacing values of the (200) plane obtained from the powder XRD patterns.

The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs were used to study their optical properties. The band gap energies (Eg) were determined by extrapolating straight lines from the (αhυ)2versus hυ plots to intercept the x abscissa (Fig. 6(a)). To further understand the relationship between the alloys’ composition and their band gap evolution, the band gaps of the nanocrystals were plotted as a function of x (Fig. 6(b)). It was found that the optical band gap of the samples shows a curve, which is termed as band gap “bowing”. The data points were fitted by the modified bowing equation as follows:Eg(x) = xEgCu2SnS3 + (1 − x)EgCu2SnSe3 − x(1 − x)/bwhere EgCu2SnS3 and EgCu2SnSe3 are the bandgaps of Cu2SnS3 and Cu2SnSe3, respectively; and b is the bowing parameter describing the nonlinear relationship between the band gap and the composition. The bowing parameter determined by the best fitting curve is 0.12 eV, which deviates slightly from the linear relationship and shows that the band gap has a nonlinear dependence on x in Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 nanocrystals. This nonlinear relationship has been reported in the literature and could possibly result from several effects: (i) band-structure variations resulting from the alternating lattice constant, (ii) electron distribution deformation resulting from differences in electronegativity among the atoms, and (iii) differently sized constituents resulting from the internal structural relaxation of the anion–cation bond lengths and angles.6,10

This one-pot synthesis does not require a precursor injection and relies on relatively inexpensive, environmentally friendly reagents. The heating method presented here can provide a facile route for large-scale and high-throughput production of Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs. To test this up-scaling, we increase the synthesis to 10-fold the volume of that in the syntheses discussed in the previous sections. Fig. 7 depicts the results of a typical gram-scale synthesis, by decomposition of 10 mmol Cu(OAc)2, 5 mmol SnBr2, 7.5 mmol Se and 7.5 mmol S in a 100 mL flask containing 60 mL oleylamine and 6 mL 1-dodecanethiol at 240 °C. The heating time was again kept at 1 h. The XRD pattern confirms that NCs obtained from the scale-up procedure have the same crystal structure as those from the small-scale synthesis, with no other phases or side products. EDS of a field of nanocrystals indicates that the average Cu:Sn:S:Se molar ratio is 2.1:1:1.48:1.52, matching very well with the precursor molar ratio (2:1:1.5:1.5). The average diameter of the nanoparticles synthesized by the up-scaled procedure is slightly smaller than that of the small-scale synthesis, as shown in the XRD and TEM results. This is due to the fact that the precursor concentration in the up-scaled procedure is slightly higher, and a high precursor concentration usually results in small nanoparticles. These as-prepared nanocrystals can also be dispersed in most organic solvents and possess good colloidal stability in solution for several months.

The chemical yield is an important aspect of large-scale synthesis. It can be estimated from a comparison of the total weight of the product and that of the initial precursors. To calculate the synthesis yield, the contribution of the residual solvent and organic ligands to the weight of the final product was estimated from TGA analysis (Fig. S7†), and a synthesis yield of 93% was found. We can therefore conclude that the present synthesis approach could be utilized to produce large quantities of stoichiometrically-controlled Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 nanocrystals.
To validate the optoelectronic properties of the as-large-scale synthesized Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3 nanocrystals, current–voltage (I–V) measurements of Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3 thin films were performed. The films were fabricated on patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates via spin-casting using a toluene solution of Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3 NCs. After that, 100 nm thick aluminum (Al) cathodes were deposited by thermal evaporation. Fig. S8† shows the I–V curves of the Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3 film tested in the dark and under an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was measured in a 1 V bias range. The device exhibits a strong increase in current under light irradiation in comparison to the dark state. Light irradiation excites electrons in the valance band to the conduction band and then increases the number of holes in the Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3. As a result, the current is clearly increased and the conductivity of the film is enhanced. This obvious photoresponsive behavior suggests that the as-synthesized Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3 will be a potential candidate in the fabrication of photovoltaic devices.
These nanocrystals are potential materials for photovoltaic absorber film fabrication, but a ligand exchange procedure that frees the NCs from carbon-containing stabilizers and comparisons between the properties of the nanocrystals and films prepared by these nanocrystals still require further study.
Conclusions
In summary, we have reported a facile, green heating procedure for the synthesis of multicomponent Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 nanocrystals. By modulating the precursor molar ratios, the composition of the resultant NCs could be tuned over the whole range, from Cu2SnS3 to Cu2SnSe3. The lattice parameters (a and c) of the Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs were consistent with Vegard's law, which confirmed the formation of homogeneous nanocrystals. The XRD and TEM results indicated that the as-prepared Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs have a monoclinic structure. The band gap of the Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 NCs could be tailored from 1.55 to 1.87 eV by decreasing the Se content, yielding a nonlinear relationship with x, with a bowing constant of 0.12 eV. By scaling up the amount of precursors 10-fold using the same synthesis scheme, gram-scale amounts of Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3 NCs could be collected, which was facilitated by the high chemical yield of the synthesis (93%), while still maintaining control over the phase and composition. The photoresponsive behavior indicates the potential use of as-large-scale synthesized Cu2Sn(S0.5Se0.5)3 nanocrystals in solar energy conversion systems. Given the general approach in terms of precursors, solvents, and temperatures used, our strategy might be suitable for the large-scale synthesis of nanomaterials for low-cost photovoltaics.
