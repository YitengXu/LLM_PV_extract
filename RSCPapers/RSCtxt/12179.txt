1. Introduction
Cellulose is the most abundant renewable and biodegradable polymer on earth (1011−1012 tons produced annually). During the past few decades, nano-scaled particles coming from cellulose known as nanocellulose have attracted considerable attention. The nanocellulose obtained via chemical or mechanical treatment of cellulose fibers can be divided into two categories: cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and cellulose microfibrils (MFC), also called cellulose nanofibrils (CNF). Both CNF and CNC are found to be effective in various applications such as mechanical reinforcements in nanocomposites,1–3 barrier membranes,4 rheological modifiers,5 fluorescent labeling agents in medical imaging6,7 and drug delivery systems.8,9 The number of published books10 and reviews11–13 on the different nanocellulose applications indicates the interest in such materials. Recently, the desire to combine the outstanding properties and abilities of nanocellulose for designing flexible and sustainable electronics has attracted significant interest.
Flexible electronics and, more generally, printed electronics is an important and promising area of research exhibiting strong developments. Interest in printed electronics has exponentially increased in the last 15 years. Printed electronics can be defined as the combination of printing processes and ink chemistry for the manufacture of electronic components. Compared to the conventional lithographic processes used in microelectronics, this combination would lead to the production of flexible, cost effective and environmentally friendly electronic products due to the large variety of printing processes possible. Printed electronics processes include traditional printing processes, such as inkjet, flexography or screen-printing, and coating processes such as bar coating, spin-coating or sputtering for producing conductive tracks and layers. Recently, additive processes like 3D printing have also been considered for complex electronics designs.
As can be seen from Fig. 1, interest in the use of nanocellulose in printed electronics has recently been growing. However, its use in printed electronics is still very limited as compared to the other applications of nanocellulose. Among the 1000 papers and patents related to nanocellulose published in 2015, only 11 were related to printed electronics. Publications dealing with nanocellulose and printed electronics only represent 1% of the total number of papers with 75% of publications and 15% of patents. These papers focus mainly on two areas: (i) the blend of conductive particles and nanocellulose and (ii) the use of nanocellulose as a substrate. Recently, a few reports presented the use of nanocellulose as substrates,14 conductive composites15 and their integration in electronics devices.16 To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive and exhaustive review has reported on the use of nanocellulose in all the areas of printed electronics comprising inks, substrates, and the associated processes and applications as illustrated in Fig. 2.

This review aims at giving the first global overview of the use of nanocellulose in printed electronics: (i) the potential of nanocellulose in functional conductive inks, (ii) the use of nanocellulose as a substrate in printed electronics and (iii) electronics applications of nanocellulose. Analysis was performed on both publications and patents. The first part of the review focuses on a brief description of nanocellulose preparation and properties besides introducing the materials and processes used in printed electronics. Further parts would focus on the use of nanocellulose in printed electronics and emphasize the benefits of using cellulose nanomaterials.
2. Fundamentals of nanocellulose and printed electronics
2.1 Nanocellulose preparation and properties
The structure of cellulosic fibers can be represented as a succession of cellulosic filaments of different length scales as schematized in Fig. 3. Individual cellulose molecules are assembled to form elementary cellulose fibrils (width ∼3–5 nm), which are aggregated to form bundles of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) (width ∼20 nm) composing the cellulose fiber. Cellulose with a fibrillary nature and a hierarchical structure is at the origin of cellulose nanomaterials known as nanocellulose. Two types of nanocellulose can be extracted from cellulosic fibers differing in the steps involved in their isolation and in their structure. While CNC are rigid rod-like particles obtained by chemical treatment of cellulose and are mostly crystalline in nature, CNF are flexible ribbons obtained by a mechanical treatment of cellulosic fibers and are composed of both amorphous and crystalline domains. This section focuses on the preparation, properties, and applications of CNC and CNF.

2.1.1 Cellulose nanofibrils (CNF). 
Extraction of CNF was reported first by Turbak et al.17 who observed the formation of a viscous gel after mechanical disintegration of the cellulosic fibers. CNF can be produced from different sources such as cotton, wood and annual plants by mechanical disintegration of the cellulosic fiber suspension with an induced high shear. The high mechanical shear progressively causes a longitudinal cleavage of the cellulose fibers to obtain nanofibrils. Processes commonly involved in mechanical fibrillation are grinding, microfluidization and homogenization18 and the cellulose suspension passes several times through the apparatus before CNF isolation. These processes generally involve many passes and are really energy consuming. Consequently, pre-treatment methods, such as enzymatic treatment19,20 and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO) oxidation,21 can facilitate the fibrillation of cellulose fibers and reduce the number of passes. The reduction of energy consumption using these pre-treatment methods has allowed the industrialization of CNF since 2010. A recent review focused on recent advances in CNF preparation.22 The structure of CNF is composed of both amorphous and crystalline parts. CNF fibers possess a high aspect ratio (∼100) with dimensions of 2–60 nm in diameter and a few microns in length depending on the processing and pre-treatment methods. Abundance of hydroxyl groups on the CNF surface associated with their high aspect ratio induce the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between each nanofiber, resulting in the unique properties of CNF such as enhanced mechanical properties, gel-like behavior and the ability to form flexible self-standing films on drying. Presence of hydroxyl moieties also offers a very reactive chemistry for surface modification. Oxidation23 or grafting24 can be implemented for introducing new functional or charged groups on the CNF surface.
Other than the abovementioned vegetal sources, certain bacteria can also secrete cellulose nanofibers; these are called bacterial nanocellulose.25 Bacterial nanofibers are very pure and exhibit properties such as higher crystallinity, higher cellulose concentration (about 100%) and a finer web-like structure as compared to that of CNF obtained from vegetal sources. However, redispersion of bacterial nanofibers is more difficult.
The structure, mechanical properties and surface reactive chemistry of CNF have been utilized in a large range of applications, such as drug release,9 paper coating26 and as reinforcements in composites.2 Recently, the use of CNF networks to form self-standing films or coatings has attracted significant interest. A CNF network can be seen as a nanoporous web-like structure of highly entangled nanofibers. Resulting films appear smoother and less porous than the traditional cellulosic papers and have a certain level of transparency (light transmission) depending on the CNF dimensions.27 These enhanced surface properties make CNF very interesting for printing applications28 and in the development of flexible electronic devices.14 CNF can also be used for functional aerogel preparations29,30 and in 3D printers,31,32 but these points will not be detailed in this review.


2.1.2 Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC). 
Unlike flexible CNF, CNC are rigid rod-like nanoparticles corresponding to crystalline parts of cellulose fibers. CNC visualization was first reported in the 1950s by Rånby et al.33 who observed a birefringence of cellulose suspension after an acid hydrolysis, and the material was then extensively studied in the 1960s.34 CNC can be isolated by a chemical treatment of cellulose with a mild acid hydrolysis. Acid infiltration into the accessible amorphous regions of the cellulose fibers leads to the cleavage of the glycoside bonds. Thus, amorphous parts are dissolved, leading to the formation of crystalline CNC. Various acids, such as hydrochloric35 and hydrobromic36 acids, have been used for CNC isolation. However, isolation using sulfuric acid is by far the most common method, as it can introduce negatively charged half-ester sulfate groups on the CNC surface. These groups induce repulsive forces between the CNC, leading to an electrostatic stable colloidal suspension in water. Many research studies have focused on the isolation conditions37,38 and the effect of the raw material for producing CNC in terms of its yield, dimensions, and properties.
The structure of CNC differs from that of CNF. CNC have a rice-like structure rather than a filament-like one. Dimensions of CNC can vary from 10 to 50 nm in diameter and from 100 to 500 nm in length depending on the starting material.37 The high surface area of the CNC induces great mechanical properties and offers a good surface reactivity, allowing the introduction of functional groups by means of grafting39,40 or oxidation.41,42 Additionally, CNC can organize themselves in a chiral nematic way in suspensions leading to the formation of iridescent films once dried, unlike CNF.43 However, even though the films produced by CNC are transparent, they are usually more brittle than those of CNF due to their crystalline nature. Recently, the use of CNC as a stabilizer in pickering emulsion has been reported and seems very promising.44 The applications of CNC have focused on mechanical reinforcements in composites,45 iridescent films,43 and emulsions44 but its use in functional inks has recently been reported. These aspects would be detailed later.

2.2 Materials, processes, and applications of printed electronics
The field of printed electronics constitutes a combination of conductive material formulation and printing processes for the manufacture of electronic components. Printed electronics is a growing field and the market is estimated to be $73 billion in 2025.46 Due to the above-mentioned advantages in terms of productivity and waste production as compared to the traditional processes (vapor deposition or lithography), the use of flexible substrates is one of the crucial breakthroughs in the area of printed electronics. A brief overview of the materials, processes and applications of printed electronics is summarized in the following sub-sections.

2.2.1 Materials. 
Conductive materials for conductive inks can be divided into three categories: conductive polymers, metallic particles and carbon-based particles (carbon nanotubes, graphene, etc.). The conductivity, flexibility and transparency of these materials are different. Fig. 3 summarizes the conductive particles and their length scales as compared to nanocellulose. The conductive particles are generally selected by (i) the printing process due to specific physico-chemical ink properties and particle dimensions and (ii) the required performance for end-use application in terms of flexibility, transparency and conductivity. Some reviews have provided details of specific conductive materials dedicated to inkjet printing47,48 and to opto-electronic applications.49
Metallic particle inks offer the highest level of conductivity. To obtain a high level of conductivity, an additional post treatment of annealing (∼150–250 °C for several minutes) is usually required. This leads to the formation of a continuous interconnected phase between the metallic particles after the elimination of all the insulating components present in the ink (stabilizing agents, other additives, etc.). Silver has been the most widely used metal so far owing to its high bulk conductivity and high resistance to oxidation. However silver is expensive (∼500 $ kg−1), resulting in a high cost of the inks. Most of the conductive silver inks are based on spherical nanoparticles or flakes. These inks exhibit a high conductivity but the obtained printed tracks and layers are usually opaque and brittle. Copper has also been of interest owing to the high conductivity of bulk copper and the lower price compared to silver (∼5 $ kg−1). However, instability of the copper particles under environmental conditions is a major drawback to the use of copper in conductive metallic inks, and several research studies have focused on the protection of copper particles.50–52
Recently, nano-structured metal particles, such as metal nanowires and nanofibers, have attracted significant interest in the manufacture of flexible transparent conductive layers owing to their high aspect ratio.53,54 These elongated particles can form a percolated network at very low concentrations, resulting in printed layers with a high level of light transmission.
Conductive polymer and carbon particle inks differ from metal inks as they possess a moderate conductivity (about 100 times lower as compared to silver), but can exhibit transparency and flexibility. These inks do not require any annealing treatment, allowing the printing on flexible substrates such as plastics, which cannot withstand high temperatures.55,56 Concerning conductive polymers, poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) is the most commonly used one for processing conductive layers owing to its good processability and stability in water. As an example, a performance of 35 Ω □−1 at 80% transparency has been reported for spray-coated conductive PEDOT-PSS films.57 Regarding carbon particles, graphite has been largely used in flexible batteries while carbon nanotubes and graphene are common materials for the processing of conductive and transparent layers. CNTs and graphene sheets with unique properties such as high intrinsic current mobility, high mechanical properties and optical transparency have raised much interest for the development of low-cost printed electronics applications.58–60 For example, a conductivity of 286 Ω □−1 with a transparency of 92% has been reported for carbon nanotubes.61


2.2.2 Processes for printed electronics. 
Many printing processes such as flexography62,63 and gravure printing,64,65 have been used in printed electronics. However, recent studies have mostly focused on inkjet printing and screen-printing processes owing to the possibility of using additive processes and a large amount of deposited materials, respectively. Inkjet printing is a non-contact and additive process in which the ink is ejected through micrometric nozzles onto the printing substrate. Advances in inkjet printing in the field of printed electronics relies on the possibility of depositing a thin layer (∼0.8–0.2 μm) at a high printing speed with a high flexibility (no printing form is needed) and resolution. The limitations of inkjet printing are especially due to the specific ink physico-chemical property requirements for allowing droplet ejection and the restriction in the particle size (<1 μm) for avoiding nozzle clogging.66 The use of inkjet printing to manufacture printed electro-active components is growing rapidly. For example, Hun Eom et al. used inkjet for printing a conductive polymer layer for solar cell applications.67 Mäntysalo and Mansikkamäki deposited an antenna on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate using a catalytic ink.68 Recently, Sowade et al. have demonstrated a completely printed transistor using inkjet on flexible PEN using an industrial inkjet printer.69 The screen printing process has also been largely implemented for printing electronic devices. In the screen printing process, the printing is performed by passing the ink through a screen mesh using an applied pressure by a squeegee. A polymer emulsion covers the non-printed zone of the screen while the printed zone is exposed, allowing the ink to pass through the mesh. Screen-printing can be used for depositing layers with a thickness of several micrometers but the maximal resolution (∼100 μm) is lower compared to that of the inkjet printing. Screen-printing has been employed in various printed electronics applications such as solar cells,70 sensors71 and transistors.72
Coating techniques such as slot die, bar and blade coating and spray techniques can be used for processing transparent conductive layers with an easy, fast and large scale process. These processes can be easily scaled up and are adaptable to roll-to-roll production. An overview of coating techniques for solar cell applications73 was reported by Frederik Krebs. The limitations of the coating techniques are the high waste production and the impossibility of processing a detailed pattern.


2.2.3 Applications of printed electronics. 
Printed electronics have various applications, which can be divided into the manufacture of electronic components, such as antennas or transistors, which usually requires patterning, and the manufacture of conductive electrodes requiring conductive layers. Requirements can vary depending on the application. Electronic components require highly conductive materials while the performance of a conductive electrode depends on the targeted application. Conductive electrodes integrated in devices such as sensors or energy storage devices should have a high conductivity. Opto-electronic devices such as displays, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), and solar cells consist of conductive and transparent electrodes in a multilayer system and would generally be a trade-off between transparency and conductivity. As presented earlier in the conductive material section, the combination of a high conductivity and a high transparency is difficult to achieve.
Printed electronics have been realized using both rigid substrates like glass and flexible substrates like paper or polymeric films. Processing of flexible devices or components is one of the most important aspects in printed electronics. Electronic components such as antennas or transistors have been printed on flexible paper substrates74 and more recently on 3D objects.75 Opto-electronic devices like flexible displays76 and solar cells77 have also been produced using printing and coating techniques.

3. Use of nanocellulose for conductive inks
Conductive ink functionality is usually achieved by the addition of conductive fillers within the ink formulation. As mentioned earlier, three types of conductive materials are commonly used to formulate conductive inks: metallic nanoparticles or flakes (mainly silver, gold, and copper), carbon particles (nanotubes, graphene, graphite, carbon black, fullerenes) and conductive polymers (PEDOT-PSS, polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI), etc.). Major issues in the formulation of conductive inks are (i) controlling the raw conductive material synthesis and (ii) the ink formulation for improving the stability, dispersion and physico-chemical properties of the suspension.
Recently, nanocellulose has exhibited great potential in the synthesis of raw conductive materials and the ink formulation as schematically described in Fig. 4. Nanocellulose is a promising bio-based material in the synthesis of conductive particles as it can act as (i) a bio-template for the synthesis of tubular conductive particles using nanocellulose with a high aspect ratio and (ii) a capping agent in the synthesis of metallic particles. Nanocellulose can also be useful in ink formulation as (iii) a dispersing and stabilizing agent or (iv) a binding agent. Most of the currently published papers on nanocellulose and conductive materials mainly focus on composite applications. Here, we provide an overview of conductive materials based on nanocellulose that could have a strong potential in conductive ink applications.

3.1 Nanocellulose as a bio-template
For use as a template, either cellulose nanocrystals or cellulose nanofibers are used as raw materials. The high aspect ratio of nanocellulose is of interest for using nanocellulose as a template. The use of nanostructured particles with a high aspect ratio would allow a low functional loading. Most of the papers reported a templating method using nanocellulose and conductive polymers. However, metallic particles like silver, gold, and copper had also been a subject of interest. Table 1 provides an exhaustive overview of nanocellulose associated with conductive materials that can have potential application in conductive inks.

3.1.1 Conductive polymers. 
Conductive polymers are semiconducting materials owing to their conjugated bonds in the polymer structure. Mostly used conductive polymers are PEDOT-PSS, PANI and PPy, which are usually obtained by an oxidative polymerization of the corresponding monomers.78 As mentioned earlier, most of the papers dealing with conductive polymers and nanocellulose focus on achieving conductive nanofibers as a filler in composite applications. For printed electronics applications, the templated nanofibers are expected to be promising for achieving high aspect ratio conductive particles to develop conductive inks at a low solid content.
Polypyrrole is the most conductive synthesized polymer used in this regard. Oxidative polymerization is usually processed on the nanocellulose surface directly by the grafting from approach. The polymerization of PPy on the cellulose surface occurs via strong hydrogen bonds between –OH groups of cellulose and –NH groups of the Py monomer.79 Although covalent bonds were not formed, strong interactions with the network structure seem to happen. A disadvantage of this technique is the release of the non-adsorbed polymer. CNF and CNC have been used as templates for PPy polymerization as conductive fillers in the insulating matrix80 or in cellulose composites.81 Flandin et al. studied and patented the PPy polymerization on CNF for composite applications for the first time.80,82 Following that, several studies have aimed at understanding the influence of polymerization conditions such as the polymerization time83 and the rinsing conditions during the synthesis.84 The amount of pyrrole (Py) monomer introduced is found to be one of the most influencing parameters on the conductivity and the template surface coverage. Müller et al. determined the effect of the Py ratio on the electrical conductivity of the obtained bacterial CNF composites and observed a plateau starting from a given amount of Py.83 The successful templating of PPy on bacterial CNF was verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. Zhang et al. used polymerization of PPy on tunicate CNC for manufacturing conductive films.85 SEM images indicated well attached PPy on the nanocrystal template as can be seen in Fig. 5-a, as compared to the neat CNC. The PPy particle size and the electrical performances were also found to depend on the amount of introduced Py. Following this, Wu et al. examined the effect of the cellulose hydroxyl groups to Py ratio on the polymerization using TEMPO oxidized CNC.86 TEMPO oxidation has previously been employed on CNF–PPy nanocomposites to increase the PPy–cellulose interaction.87 An optimum Py to hydroxyl group ratio of 16 has been found for controlling the polymerization and obtaining the highest electrical properties (conductive CNC with a conductivity of about 4 S cm−1). While polymerization parameters need to be controlled to ensure a total coverage of the conductive polymer on the cellulose surface, one advantage of using nanocellulose for synthesizing PPy is the production of a water dispersible PPy material, usually insoluble in water. The use of CNC has been reported to enhance the PPy stability in water as compared to that of pure PPy.88 Wu et al. prepared redispersible conductive powder after freeze-drying, which was suitable for tunable conductive inks.86 However, obtaining a uniform PPy layer free of polypyrrole aggregates onto the cellulose surface is still difficult. They also reported a new method for coating the CNC surface with a smooth and uniform thin layer of PPy using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to produce a PPy/PVP/CNC core–shell structure, by oxidizing CNC beforehand.89 PVP was found to not only act as a stabilizer for avoiding PPy aggregates but also provide a uniform hydrophobic layer on the CNC surface for favoring the polymerization of PPy.

Combining the PANI conductive polymer with nanocellulose was first demonstrated by Van Den Berg et al. Adsorption of two conductive polymers, PANI and poly(p-phenyleneethynylene) (PPE), on CNC was investigated for developing electro-active composites with high mechanical properties.90 Composites were prepared by direct adsorption of the polymer by mixing a polymer suspension with CNC. Electro-conductive composites using PANI–CNC have been successfully manufactured with a PANI content (0.6%) lower than that calculated for the fully recovered CNC (20%). Thus, CNC were not fully covered by PANI; however, the electrical percolation threshold was decreased due to the partial templating onto CNC. Although their study focused on the adsorption of the conductive polymer on the CNC template, a similar trend was reported by Casado et al. using direct polymerization on CNC where composites with a higher electrical performance were obtained when using PANI coated CNC compared to neat PANI.91 Direct oxidative polymerization of PANI onto the nanocellulose surface has been implemented for applications such as flexible conductive films92,93 and addition of an electrical stimulus.94 An electro-chemical polymerization on a CNC film has also been reported for producing conductive films with a conductivity of 2 S cm−1.95 Surface coverage of nanocellulose using direct oxidative polymerization has been successful with Luong et al. demonstrating a uniform coating of PANI on CNF.96 Different ratios of PANI to cellulose were investigated to determine the morphology and the mechanical and electrical properties of the composite paper. Electrical percolation threshold was found at 4.57 vol% of PANI and conductivity was in the range of 2.6 × 10−5–1.8 S cm−1 depending on the PANI content. Interestingly, stable concentrations of PANI : CNF suspensions were obtained at a concentration of 1 mg ml−1 in the pH range of 1–7 as opposed to 2–3 for PANI particles alone, emphasizing the increase in the stability of CNF : PANI suspensions. Thus, CNF can also act as a stabilizing agent for the PANI polymer and even though the authors have used the suspension for processing composites, the enhanced stability and conductivity might be of interest for conductive ink applications.
Fewer papers dealing with the PEDOT-PSS conductive polymer have been reported. Mendez et al. were among the first to report the use of CNC for synthesizing conductive PEDOT-PSS nanorods.97 Based on the studies of other conductive polymers, they examined the oxidative polymerization of the EDOT monomer onto CNC by implementing two different methods. In the first method, polymerizations with iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate-doped PEDOT-PSS using methanol: water as the solvent were investigated, which led to the formation of PEDOT aggregates on the nanocellulose surface despite modifying the cellulose:EDOT and the solvent ratio. The aggregate formation was probably due to the interaction between iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate and CNC. Polymerization using PSS as the counter ion and polystyrene sulfonate as the main oxidative agent was then investigated. This second strategy resulted in a uniform polymerization without the formation of aggregates. Conductive properties were examined for different cellulose:EDOT ratios and the optimal ratio led to a cast film with a surface resistivity of 97 Ω □−1. Tkalya et al. used a CNC–PEDOT-PSS system for producing conductive fillers for the polystyrene matrix. In this case, the templating was carried out not by using in situ polymerization, but by the adsorption of PEDOT-PSS onto CNC.98 The use of CNC as a template resulted in the lowering of the electrical percolation threshold to 0.42 vol% as compared to that of CNC (2.31 vol%) for the pristine PEDOT-PSS composite. Thus, CNC acts as an effective scaffold for the PEDOT-PSS polymer, which preferentially organizes itself depending on the CNC network. The templating mechanism of CNC by PEDOT-PSS is not yet fully understood. However, a decrease in absorbance of CNC–PEDOT-PSS solution as a function of time suggested an adsorption of PEDOT-PSS onto CNC.
In conclusion, these strategies allowed the preparation of conductive films and some suspensions could be used for printing processes. The main drawbacks of such in situ polymerization methods lie in controlling the polymerization for obtaining a continuous layer free of aggregates and in releasing the adsorbed polymer layer.


3.1.2 Metallic particles. 
Numerous studies have taken advantage of nanocellulose surface chemistry for synthesizing metallic particles on the nanocellulose surface for antibacterial,99–102 bio-imaging,103 and catalytic104 applications or for enhancing the mechanical and thermal properties of the polymer composite.105 A very recent review by Kaushik et al. gave an exhaustive overview of the use of nanocellulose as a support for metallic particle synthesis.106 However, unlike in the case of conductive polymers, templating of nanocellulose using metallic particles for conductive applications has been less examined probably due to the difficulty in obtaining a percolated network between the metallic particles. Although several studies have reported on the synthesis of organized conductive metallic particles on the nanocellulose surface,107–111 the conductivity of the network has not been reported.
However, attempts to determine the set of experimental conditions for achieving the best coverage of the nanocellulose surface by the synthesized metallic particles were investigated. Metallic particles are usually synthesized by sol–gel chemistry methods using metallic salt as a precursor followed by a chemical or thermal reduction. Mechanisms involved in the particle synthesis are the classical nucleation and growth of the metallic particles. Many parameters influence the particle synthesis and the coverage. Padalkar et al. were among pioneers with a study and a patent deposition112 on the synthesis of different conductive metallic particles113 (such as gold, copper, and silver) as well as semi-conducting particles114 (such as cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide) using tunicate CNC as a template. Sol–gel parameters such as the reaction time, the pH of the suspension, and the concentration of the reactants were evaluated. Zhang et al. reported the optimum conditions of the pH and the surfactant concentration for producing gold nanoparticles on bacterial cellulose nanofibers.115 The abovementioned synthesis parameters and the interactions of metallic ions with the cellulose surface affected the templating coverage. Electrostatic interactions between the positively charged metal ions and the negatively charged nanocellulose were not enough for ensuring the complete coverage of the cellulose surface and an increased particle organization on using surfactant molecules was observed. Padalkar et al. reported the preferential deposition of different metallic particles on CNC obtained from tunicates using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant during the synthesis of metallic particles. In a similar manner, Zhang et al. used polyethyleneimine and demonstrated a higher coverage of gold particles on the CNF fibers.115 Mechanisms involved in the higher coverage are not yet fully understood. However, the interactions between the hydroxyl groups of cellulose and the ionic ammonium group of the surfactant seem to play a crucial role.
Instead of using additional molecules or polyelectrolytes for enhancing the metal ion–nanocellulose interactions, some researchers have focused on introducing new functional groups on the cellulose surface by oxidation. Presence of carboxylate and aldehyde groups has been reported to enhance the metallic particle synthesis on the nanocellulose surface.108,116 Ifuku et al. suggested the occurrence of an ion exchange between the Na+ counter ion of the carboxylate groups and Ag+, resulting in higher immobilization of silver nanoparticles on the oxidized nanocellulose surface.116 Wu et al. synthesized silver particles on CNF, which was oxidized by periodate to introduce aldehyde groups for increasing the interaction between silver and cellulose.117 Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis indicated a better ability of the periodate oxidized CNF in reducing the Ag+ ion via a thermal treatment compared to that of the neat CNF. Fig. 5-b illustrates the templated CNF along with the electrical properties of the system. The intensity–voltage curve revealed a nearly ohmic behavior with a conductivity of about 5 S cm−1. Even though this value is far less than the bulk silver conductivity value (about 6 × 106 S cm−1), the formation of a percolated metallic nanoparticle thin film onto the CNF surface using a metal bio-templating method was first reported in this study. More recently, Hoeng et al. proposed optimum conditions of CNC oxidation for a better longitudinal covering.118
The hybrid system of conductive polymer/metallic particles has also been studied119,120 and no improvements in the conductivity compared to that of the neat metal or the polymer network was observed. As summarized in Table 1, most of the published reports using the templating method on nanocellulose focus on conductive polymers for producing conductive composites. Metallic materials are less commonly used due to the difficulties in controlling the synthesis and obtaining an electrical percolating network pathway. Most of these conductive applications focus on composites and industrial applications as conductive inks have not been reported so far. However, we believe that nanotemplating on both CNF and CNC would be efficient in producing conductive inks with a lower functional solid content and a certain level of transparency.

3.2 Capping and nucleating agents for metallic particle synthesis
Metallic nanoparticles are one of the most widely used raw materials in formulating conductive inks. However, the control of particle size remains challenging and surfactant molecules are usually needed. Recently, the use of nanocellulose as both enhancing and capping agents during the chemical synthesis of metallic particles121,122 has been reported. Although the use of nanocellulose with the aim of controlling the synthesis of metallic particles has not been reported, this section details an interesting sustainable way for producing metallic particles with controlled size, which may be used as raw materials in the conductive ink formulation.
As previously mentioned, many research studies have used oxidized nanocellulose for anchoring metallic ions on the cellulose surface and enhanced the amount of synthesized particles.99,104,116,123 Charge density of nanocellulose seems to be a key parameter in the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles, even though few studies have focused on the comprehensive mechanisms of capping and nucleating actions of nanocellulose during the metallic particle synthesis. Lokanathan et al. studied the mechanism of silver nanoparticle synthesis in the presence of silver nitrate, sodium borohydride and CNC.122 They showed that despite a decrease in the particle size, the number of synthesized silver particles increased on increasing the CNC concentration, suggesting the nucleation controlling action of CNC. The ionic interactions between the negatively charged sulfate groups on the CNC surface and the silver nanoparticles were assumed to cause a capping action of CNC. Thus, the sulfate group impact on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles was investigated. Surprisingly, an optimum in the surface concentration of sulfate groups was obtained, minimizing the synthesized silver particle size dispersion. High amounts of sulfate groups may hinder the hydroxyl–metal particle interactions, reducing the control on the nucleation and growth processes. A very small amount of sulfate groups would, on the contrary, induced aggregation of CNC leading to a loss in the capping ability. Uddin et al. followed this investigation by carrying out a comprehensive study on the role of carboxylate groups in the silver nanoparticle synthesis using TEMPO oxidized CNC. The CNC charge densities obtained by modifying the reaction time and varying the carboxyl content between 0 and 1.5 mmol g−1 were examined. A combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis spectral analyses indicated that the presence of carboxyl groups enhanced the CNC ability to stabilize the silver nanoparticles, leading to lower size dispersion with an increased number of small particles. By examining the UV-vis kinetic measurements, the nucleation rate was found to be inversely proportional to the carboxyl content of CNC, suggesting that the action of TEMPO CNC occurs during the growth phase as a capping agent rather than during the nucleation phase as a nucleation enhancer. However, Hoeng et al. have recently suggested that the capping action of TEMPO CNC for silver nanoparticles was effective in both the nucleation and growth phases.118 Evaluation of both the size and amount of synthesized silver particles, with CNC at different charge densities, indicates that the carboxylate groups acted as a nucleation enhancer and a capping agent.
Even though the capping mechanism of CNC is not fully understood, the charged groups on the nanocellulose surface are found to be essential for controlling the synthesis of metallic particles. Although only CNC action was studied in the comprehensive previous publications, CNF were also used for producing metallic particle sizes. However, although no specific studies have evaluated the role of CNF in metallic particle synthesis, the tight and bundled CNF network as well as their easier aggregation might limit the capping action as compared to that of CNC. Recent studies demonstrate the ability of nanocellulose in controlling the metallic particle size distribution. Nanocellulose can thus be regarded as a renewable and greener alternative to the surfactant molecules commonly used for this purpose.
3.3 Stabilizing and binding agents
Good dispersion of hydrophobic conductive particles, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, is usually achieved by using surfactants or chemically modifying the particle surface. Recently, the potential for using nanocellulose as a dispersing agent for organic and inorganic particles has been reported on. Dispersion of inorganic particles using CNF was reported in the case of titanium dioxide particles (TiO2) for producing opaque CNF films.124 Among conductive particles, the stabilization of carbon nanotubes has been especially studied.125–128 Mechanisms involved in the stabilization of carbon nanotubes are not yet fully understood but Oliver et al. recently reported that interactions between the hydrophobic face of the (200) crystalline plane of CNC and the hydrophobic carbon nanotubes could occur. These interactions combined with the electrostatic repulsions of negatively charged CNC result in a stable dispersion of carbon nanotubes in water. Following their study, Koga et al. described the ability of TEMPO oxidized CNF to stabilize single wall carbon nanotube suspensions.127 They used the hybrid suspension for manufacturing conductive films by casting and inkjet printing on the PET films and obtained a conductivity of about 1.2 kΩ □−1 as illustrated in Fig. 5-c. This study demonstrated, for the first time, the ability of nanocellulose to be used as a dispersant in conductive inkjet inks. Similar mechanisms were assumed by Li et al.129 in the dispersion of 2D materials, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and boron nitride (BN), using CNF. TEMPO CNF were used to stabilize the MoS2 and BN flakes by mixing CNF with mineral particles followed by centrifugation to recover a stable supernatant suspension. The affinities between CNF and 2D materials are supposed to occur due to the hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic face of CNF and hydrophobic flakes of MoS2 and BN. Stable suspensions were obtained due to the electrostatic repulsive forces of CNF and additional steric hindrance as in the case of CNT mentioned above. In addition to stabilizing properties, the authors also reported higher mechanical properties of CNF–MoS2 and CNF–BN composites compared to that of other MoS2 and BN composites reported, and these composites were successfully integrated into sodium-ion batteries. Recently, the stabilizing properties of nanocellulose have proved their effectiveness in industrial applications (two announced patents by a company (Poly-Ink)) by using CNF and CNC for obtaining stable suspensions of silver nanoparticles.130,131
The use of nanocellulose as a binder in ink formulations is less common. However, some studies reported enhanced properties in conductive coating when using CNF. Sasso et al. studied the use of CNF mixed with PPy suspensions in forming conductive films and coatings, as compared to pure PPy suspensions. A binding action of CNF132,133 by obtaining a homogeneous film when using CNF in the suspension formulation was observed (Fig. 5-d). Pras et al. reported the ability of mixed copper/CNF slurry to be processed by filtration, coating and screen printing methods for conductive applications.134 While films obtained by vacuum filtration were conductive without any treatment, resistive patterns were obtained by printing and coating methods. Zinc addition combined with a calendering and corona treatments on the printed films resulted in the formation of a conductive pattern with a conductivity of 95 S m−1 and 570 S m−1 for coated and screen-printed films, respectively. These results indicated the processability of the CNF/copper suspension by coating and printing to obtain conductive patterns.
To conclude, CNC and CNF seem to be very promising in producing highly conductive organic and inorganic inks even though only a few studies have used nanocellulose for achieving this goal. Most of the published papers focus on the use of nanocellulose as substrates.
4. Nanocellulose as a substrate for printed electronics
One major breakthrough in printed electronics was the possibility of designing flexible devices. Flexible and transparent substrates, such as paper and polymer films, constitute key materials in the development of the future flexible electronic devices like solar cells, screens, and sensors. However, substrates for printed electronics have specific requirements. Printed electronics require a smooth and non-porous substrate in order to avoid cracks and discontinuities in the printed films. Ink infiltration owing to the substrate structure or roughness would increase the probability of conductive path breakage, thereby reducing the electrical conductivity. In addition, sintering of the samples at high temperatures (up to 250 °C) might be needed in some applications and the substrate should withstand such high temperatures without undergoing deformations.
Nanocellulose films, which fulfill all these requirements while being recyclable, have a great potential as a substrate in printed electronics. The different uses of nanocellulose substrates for printed electronics are summarized in Table 2 and more details are provided in the following sub-sections. As can be seen, most of the nanocellulose substrates for printed electronics are based on CNF rather than CNC. Therefore, we focus on CNF based substrates and their properties.

Nanocellulose substrates can be divided into two categories: (i) nanocellulose for enhancing the substrate surface properties and (ii) nanocellulose for flexible and transparent films.
4.1 Nanocellulose for enhancing the substrate surface properties
CNF exhibit the required properties for a printed electronic substrate. Numerous studies have demonstrated that CNF films, also called nanopaper, possess better smoothness and lower porosity than the traditional paper, approaching polymer film properties.135 Hsieh et al. emphasized the advantages of using CNF nanopaper rather than the traditional papers for producing conductive lines using two different deposition techniques, namely sputtering and inkjet printing.136 Two different functional inks were printed: a silver ink and a metal organic deposition ink (MOD). The sputtering process was performed on a plastic polyimide substrate, traditional paper and CNF nanopaper. Resistance of the printed line on the traditional paper was quite high (6430 Ω) while that on the CNF substrate was 180 times lower (34 Ω). This drastic decrease in the resistance can be attributed to the lower porosity of the CNF nanopaper as compared to that of the traditional paper, resulting in a reduction in ink infiltration and cracks as can be seen on the photographs of printed lines in Fig. 6-a. However, the resistance was still higher than that of the printed line obtained on a polyimide substrate (1 Ω) even when increasing the sputtering time. The inkjet printing process was evaluated following a similar protocol. Similar results as in the case of sputtering for the traditional paper were obtained, with an infiltration of both inks (silver and MOD) in the substrate leading to no conductivity. However, the conductivity obtained with inkjet on a nanopaper was similar to that obtained on the polyimide substrate (i.e. ≈1 Ω) as can be seen from Fig. 6-a. This superior conductivity obtained with inkjet printing on the nanopaper might be attributed to the additional sintering step that is only possible with the nanopaper. The authors highlight the higher ability of CNF nanopaper to withstand high sintering temperatures (up to 200 °C) as compared to that of the plastic substrate, which was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis. Thus, the suitability of CNF nanopaper for the printing of conductive tracks was comparable to the polymer film. Similar results were obtained by Nogi et al. by mask printing of silver nanowires on traditional paper137 and inkjet printing of silver tracks on plastics138 as compared to CNF nanopaper. Printing on traditional paper resulted in a higher resistance compared to printing on plastic films but similar conductivity values were obtained when printing silver nanowires on the CNF nanopaper. Even higher conductivities were obtained with the nanopaper as compared to plastic substrates with the inkjet silver tracks.
 Fig. 6  Examples of CNF substrates for printed electronics: (a) comparison of sputtered silver lines on paper (up) and nanopaper (down) with the associated electrical resistance;136 (b) comparison of CTE value for pure CNF and CNF acrylic resin composites;145 (c) haze-tunable transparent CNF substrate according to the CNF amount compared to PET151 and (d) illustration of fungal degradation of the nanocellulose substrate for flexible transistors.198 
The abovementioned results can be attributed to the tightly closed structure and smoothness that can be obtained with the CNF structure. Oxidation of nanocellulose is known to strongly affect the nanocellulose dimensions, leading to a highly entangled network as can be seen in Fig. 3. Chinga-Carrasco et al. were the first in 2012 to evaluate the possibility of using 100% CNF film as a substrate for printed electronics and studied the effects of CNF treatment on the produced films.139 Conductive tracks have been printed on three kinds of CNF films obtained by casting evaporation: CNF with no treatment, carboxymethylated CNF and TEMPO CNF. The inkjet printing process was chosen due to the low material consumption and the non-contact approach offered by this technique. The higher porosity of the untreated CNF network as compared to that of TEMPO-CNF induced ink absorption in the untreated CNF substrate. Therefore, a higher printing resolution was obtained when printing on the TEMPO-CNF substrate rather than the untreated CNF. However, lines printed on the TEMPO CNF films exhibited ink spreading due to the high surface energy. As the TEMPO-CNF film was also brittle in nature, carboxymethylated CNF films treated with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) were used for reducing the surface energy and obtaining a more flexible film. In this case, a good printing resolution was achieved with the treated carboxymethylated film (conductivity of 3 Ω □−1) owing to the low porosity and smooth surface of the treated CNF film.
While 100% cellulose films offer advantages in terms of sustainability, some studies evaluated the possibility of using a blend of mineral fillers and CNF for developing substrates suitable for printed electronics. Ketoja et al. studied the effect of filler addition (kaolin and precipitated calcium carbonate – 50 to 90 wt%) on the roughness and porosity of the CNF films for developing a suitable substrate for printed electronics.140–142 A combination of kaolin fillers with the CNF suspension in addition to calendering of the film leads to a roughness similar to that of a photo paper. Printing of silver ink on this nanopaper resulted in a similar conductivity to that on PET (0.3 Ω).140 A better understanding of the filler network was provided by simulating the packing of different fillers. Porosity at the sub-microscale was found to largely affect the conductivity of the printed tracks and, therefore, the best fillers for CNF nanopaper should provide a low porosity rather than a high smoothness.141
4.2 Nanocellulose as transparent flexible substrates
As nanocellulose substrates offer several advantages owing to their surface properties in the printing of conductive tracks, nanocellulose films are promising for processing transparent conductive flexible films either by coating or by impregnation of the composites. Currently, plastic substrates are mostly used owing to their flexibility and transparency, the simplicity of the processing methods and their low cost. However, poor thermal stability is the limiting factor in using plastic substrates.
The flexibility, thermal stability and biodegradability of transparent nanocellulose substrates provide an alternative to plastic substrates. This section gives an overview of the properties of such substrates for printed electronics. Applications with associated processes involved in using such substrates are reported in Table 2.
Yano et al. first reported the use of CNF in flexible electronics for the deposition of an OLED, on the bacterial CNF composite in 2008 and on the wood CNF composite in 2009.143,144 The substrates were not made with 100% CNF films but by the impregnation of dried CNF sheets in a transparent resin matrix. Since OLED processes require substrates with a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), they aimed at reducing CTE as compared to the plastic substrate while maintaining the transparency of the matrix. A decrease in the CTE of the composite was observed: the addition of CNF with a high Young's modulus decreased the CTE of the matrix with a low Young's modulus while increasing the flexibility of the composite. The concentration of CNF in the final composite was fixed at 30–40 wt% and the impregnation processing time was quite high (12 h). Nevertheless, the obtained flexible transparent substrate was suitable for depositing conductive materials for OLED production. Recently, Zhang et al. used similar impregnation methods in acrylic resin silver nanowires/CNF to obtain similar results145 (Fig. 6-b). However, the conductive electrode was directly produced by vacuum filtration of silver NWs in CNF sheets followed by impregnation in the resin. The resin impregnation improved the silver NW adhesion, surface roughness, and the total transmittance of the composite as compared to the neat silver NW/CNF film. The best opto-electrical performances were obtained with a density of 134 mg m−2 of silver nanowires (T% = 85%, Rsh = 6 Ω □−1) making it suitable for opto-electronic device applications. While thermal expansion is improved when using CNF, Nogi et al. demonstrated an increased stability of thermal transparency of CNF as compared to that of plastic substrates.146
In addition to thermal stability, another critical parameter for transparent substrates in printed electronics is the haze. The haze property is directly linked to the light scattering of the substrate and should be different according to the targeted application. Haze is defined as the percentage of light transmitted through a specimen that deviates the incident light beam by a scattering of more than 2.5° angle on average.147 Recently, Hu et al. were the first to compare the light scattering of transparent CNF films, plastic films and traditional paper.148 The angular reflection and transmission were measured and compared with those of the plastic substrate. CNF substrates exhibited both transmitted and reflected light scattering, as opposed to the plastic substrate, which could be attributed to the nanoscale diameter of the CNF leading to a high porosity structure, as compared to the dense plastic substrate. As the dimensions of the fibers play a major role in light scattering,149,150 a much higher light scattering of the transparent CNF substrate was obtained. Thus, CNF substrates can scatter light (unlike plastic substrates) while being transparent (unlike traditional papers). The diameter dependence of the scattering fibers has been used for producing functional substrates with a tunable haze by mixing TEMPO oxidized microfibers and CNF.151,152 The effect of tunable haze is illustrated in Fig. 6-c. Haze of the film was tuned while maintaining its transparency and the flexibility by introducing different amounts of CNF (from 20 to 80 wt%) into the TEMPO oxidized microfiber suspension. The haze was directly linked to the ratio of CNF to cellulose microfibers introduced into the film due to the high diameter of the microfibers. The high dimension of the cellulose microfibers causes light scattering and a high haze while smaller diameters induce a low haze. Substrates with haze varying from 18% to 60% have been produced and successfully integrated into devices such as transistors and solar cells.
Although the optical, surface and thermal properties of CNF substrates have been extensively studied, a few papers have focused on other important properties such as yellowing or water swelling of the CNF substrate. The shape stability against water is quite important in avoiding cracks in the conductive path upon drying of the aqueous conductive inks. Hu et al. mentioned this swelling problem in printed electronic applications and developed a transparent and stable CNF substrate using cross-linking agents.153 The obtained substrate was transparent and stable when immersed in water, exhibiting a swelling of only 33 μm against 6 mm for the neat nanopaper. Yellowing of transparent nanopaper has been mentioned recently by Yagyu et al.154
Koga et al. compared vacuum filtration, coating, and spin coating methods on the CNF transparent nanopaper.155 While coating and spin coating are widely used in the deposition of conductive materials, vacuum filtration cannot be implemented on traditional substrates. The nanoporous CNF film acts as a filter for depositing silver nanowires and CNT. The vacuum filtration method provided the best results in terms of conductivity in the case of silver nanowires and CNT as compared to coating and led to a decrease in the roughness of the conductive layer due to the embedding of the conductive structure. This embedding likely occurs due to the hot pressing drying on the wet CNF substrate while coating was performed on dry substrates. This decrease in the roughness (30 nm for silver NW films obtained by vacuum against 75 nm for coated films) is an important parameter when using such films in applications like OLED and displays, where the conductive layer should not damage the overlying layer.
4.3 Sustainability of nanocellulose substrates
A major advantage of using 100% cellulose films is the sustainability of the devices. While several studies have focused on the properties and performances of the nanocellulose substrates, some researchers have evaluated the sustainability of such electronic components. Zhou et al. studied the possibility of recycling a transparent smooth CNC substrate used in a solar cell device.156 Recycling was done by a simple immersion of the solar cell in water leading to the swelling and dissolution of the CNC substrate. The solar cell components can then be separated by washing and filtration. This recycling process is very easy and green. They also burned the solar cell to turn the cellulose substrate into ashes at a flame temperature and recover the metal components. Recently, Jung et al. demonstrated a new method for the degradation of nanocellulose substrates by biological degradation.157 The electronic components consisted of CNF coated epoxy substrates. Fungus degradation was evaluated for 100% CNF films and epoxy films and was found to be efficient for both films. After an extended time (84 days), the encapsulated electronic component can be recovered. In the same way, Seo et al. studied the fungal degradation of a transistor based on a CNF substrate as can be seen in Fig. 6-d.158
Sustainability of nanocellulose substrates has been proven for CNF and CNC based electronic components, offering a promising way to replace plastic and glass substrates. However, the performances of the electronic components integrating nanocellulose inks and substrates are still difficult to compete with the conventional electronics.
5. Applications of nanocellulose in printed electronics
Papers dealing with the integration of nanocellulose in flexible electronics devices and the associated applications are summarized in Table 2. Nanocellulose in electronic devices is mostly based on CNF rather than CNC and is used as a flexible (transparent) substrate. This is probably because the CNC films are more brittle in nature than CNF films, making it more suitable for flexible substrates. It is worth mentioning that the brittleness of the CNC film can be solved by the addition of plasticizers. In addition, the CNC iridescence property might provide an interesting additional functionality combined with conductive application for security or anti-counterfeiting applications.
Major applications of nanocellulose in organic electrical devices and conductive printed lines and less common applications have been examined. Daniele et al. used the CNF substrate for developing an electro-active water slide decal using the pullulan film as a water-soluble support and the on-top CNF layer as a transparent transfer layer.159 Gold and silver tracks were deposited onto this double layer support and were successfully transferred onto a finger and onto a biological substrate as can be seen in Fig. 7-a. Conductivity measurements indicated a high resistance to strain and twist with effective conductive circuits present even after the transfer. This provided the first study on electro-biocompatible devices and their properties (water vapor, oxygen barrier and thermal properties) indicated the suitability of CNF for this application. The use of cellulose nanofibrils in applications such as electro-memory,160 transparent electro-interactive nanopaper for anti-fake systems,161 strain sensors162 and electronic sticker layers with a reusable functional layer163 has also been investigated. However, this section focuses on the conventional applications of printed electronics and the obtained performances using nanocellulose.

5.1 Functional printing on nanocellulose substrates

5.1.1 Electronic component printing. 
CNF substrates, offering a low porosity and surface roughness with increased thermal properties, are ideal for the printing of conductive tracks. Successful printing of electrical conductive lines on nanocellulose substrates has been reported.136,139 Hu et al. printed radio frequency identification (RFID) antennas using silver ink on their shape stable CNF transparent nanopaper.153 Gravure printing has been implemented owing to its high printing speed and the possibility of using low-viscosity inks. Printing resolution on the CNF substrate appeared to be suitable and a great wettability and a sheet resistance of 0.3 Ω □−1 were achieved. Antenna performances were measured for two line resolution and the maximum gain was obtained for a frequency of 683 MHz and the insertion losses were measured to be −37 and −38 dB for 100 and 120 lpi resolution, respectively. Inui et al. used CNF substrates to print antennas using a modified CNF substrate with silver nanowires to produce a high dielectric constant (k) substrate. This high-k substrate reduced the antenna size (17 mm against 30 mm) compared to the neat nanopaper without changing antenna optimal performances at 2.60 GHz frequency.164


5.1.2 Transistors. 
The low surface roughness and the flexibility of transparent CNF substrates have been exploited for the fabrication of flexible thin film transistors (TFTs). Fujisaki et al. used CNF substrates for fabricating an organic thin film transistor (OTFT) and demonstrated improved properties of the sub-layers owing to the low roughness of the nanopaper.165 The dielectric layer, which was spin-coated on the CNF substrate, exhibited a low surface roughness of about 1.9 nm leading to a low current leakage (below 10−8 A cm−2). The crystalline structure of the top spin-coated organic semiconducting layer was similar to that obtained on a glass substrate owing to the smoothness of the dielectric layer. The OTFT performances were comparable with those obtained on plastic substrates with an on/off ratio of 106–108 and a mobility of 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Fig. 7-b indicates the device flexibility by illustrating a foldable and bendable transistor. No degradation in the mobility was observed after the device functioned under 1 H of bending. Huang et al. used a CNF substrate in an organic transistor device.166 The transparent conductive gate was made with bar coated SWNTs on the substrate and the dielectric layer was spin coated. Flexibility tests indicated a decrease of 10% in the carrier mobility. Transistor performances of 4.3 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an Ion/Ioff ratio of up to 200, respectively, were obtained. Fortunato et al. manufactured a flexible field effect transistor using a transparent flexible nanocellulose substrate using CNC as both a dielectric layer and a substrate.167 The obtained performances were comparable with those obtained on a traditional paper with a high mobility of 7 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an Ion/Ioff ratio of above 105.

5.2 Energy storage devices
Energy storage devices have been developed using CNF substrates. Beneventi et al. were the first to exploit CNF for flexible lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery applications. In this case, CNF was used either as a reinforcement for polymer electrolyte membranes168 or as a binding agent for producing flexible and self-standing graphite anodes.169,170 Slurry made using CNF to perform as a binding agent in Li-ion batteries had also been patented by Hayashi et al.171 Kang et al. studied the use of bacterial cellulose as a substrate.172 Electrodes for supercapacitor were prepared using bacterial CNF substrates with a top transparent CNT conductive layer obtained by vacuum filtration. The ionic liquid based polymer gel was used as an electrolyte between two conductive CNF–CNT electrodes. Electrochemical characteristic measurements indicated a specific capacitance of 20.2 mF cm−2 and the bending test indicated that the supercapacitor maintained its performances over 200 bending cycles when using the CNF substrate and the electrolyte ionic gel. Recently, Wang et al. focused on PPy–CNF electrodes for battery173 and supercapacitor applications.174–176 First, PPy-coated bacterial CNF compressed composites were examined and were found to be effective in supercapacitor applications, even though they were rigid in nature (or not bendable). Flexible graphene oxide covered PPy–CNF has also been tested as a supercapacitor electrode and moderate performances were obtained (C = 107 F g−1). Recently, Wang et al. tested anionic and cationic modified CNF–PPy as electrodes. Optimum mechanical and electrical performances were obtained for a cationic modified CNF substrate with a capacitance of 122 F cm−3 at a current of 33 A g−1, probably due to the highly packed network structure of the cationic CNF. While vacuum filtration and templating methods have been used for producing the conductive structure, a simple dipping into the conductive polymer appeared to be effective in producing flexible CNF electrodes.177
5.3 Opto-electronic devices
Achievement of the best conductivity–optical transmittance combination is still challenging in the development of transparent electrodes. Given the benefits of using CNF substrates, many researchers have tried to combine different conductive materials with CNF in order to compete with the mostly used material in conductive and transparent layers: indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO thin films possess excellent properties with a light transmittance of more than 75% and a conductivity of about 104 S cm−1 depending on the layer thickness. However, the sustainability and the price of indium as well as the brittleness of the material are the disadvantages of using ITO.
Opto-electrical properties comparable with those of ITO have recently been achieved by Song et al. Vacuum filtration of a silver nanowire–CNF mixture resulted in a transparent nanopaper with a sheet resistance of 1.9 Ω □−1 and a transmittance of 86%.178 The following sub-sections provide an overview of the obtained performances of opto-electronic devices integrating a nanocellulose based electrode.

5.3.1 Organic solar cells. 
Kippelen et al. studied the use of CNC as a substrate for organic solar cells.156,179,180 The advantage of using the CNC substrate compared to CNF is the low surface roughness. The authors first developed an organic solar cell made of a thermal evaporated modified-Ag layer as a semi-transparent bottom electrode. The top electrode was prepared by evaporating MoO3/Ag onto a photoactive layer. An open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.65 V, a photocurrent density (JSC) of 7.5 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.54, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.7% were obtained for the solar cell. Interestingly, solar cells of the same structure using the glass substrate and ITO exhibited similar values for Voc and FF. However, the PCE of 2.7% is still low as compared to the glass/ITO solar cell (PCE of 6.6%) and to actual performances of the organic solar cell. This is probably due to the lower transmittance of the CNC substrate/Ag compared to that of glass/ITO. However, a different solar cell structure made of CNC/PEDOT-PSS and a different photoactive layer were explored and a PCE of 4% was obtained, similar to the solar cell made on a polyethersulfone substrate. Thus, CNC films can be used in solar cells. Chiappone et al. used CNF as a light-scattering filler to improve the performance of a dye sensitive solar cell.181 CNF were mixed with a light-cured polymer matrix to produce an electrolyte membrane for the solar cell. Improved solar cell performances were observed with an increased PCE of 60% on the addition of 30% CNF to the membrane partly due to a light scattering enhancement. CNF increased the device stability by acting as a shield to protect the electrolyte agent. In the same way Miettunen et al. used CNF as an electrolyte membrane in dye solar cells by using a porous screen-printed and freeze-dried aerogel for absorbing and transferring the electrolytes.182 Similar solar cell performances were obtained to those of the reference cell with this technique. In addition to the transparency and haze, the flexibility of CNF nanopaper has recently been exploited for producing foldable solar cells (Fig. 7-c).137 The solar cell based on a CNF/silver nanowire electrode exhibited a power conversion during and after folding.
Even though the performances of the solar cells using nanocellulose were found to be lower than those of the conventional organic solar cells, these studies indicate the potential of using nanocellulose in these applications. The increase in the light scattering and the flexibility of nanocellulose substrates are promising in the development of flexible solar cells.


5.3.2 Diodes and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). 
A paper-transparent diode was developed by Zhang et al. using two types of modified CNFs.183 They used a combination of anionic and cationic transparent CNF films for creating a p–n junction, which on wetting created a gate for ionic transport needed for current circulation. This 100% bio-based CNF diode was then sandwiched between two conductive transparent ITO electrodes for examining its electrical performances. Moisture content, the thickness of the nanopaper, and the scanning frequency were found to affect the diode performances. For instance, moisture content especially affected the current rectification of the diode since water was required for ionic transport.
Nogi and Yano reported the manufacture of an OLED in 2008 using bacterial nanocellulose composites but the produced OLED was not flexible.143 Following that, flexible composites of bacterial CNF–polyurethane184 and CNF–acrylic resin144 have been produced for fabricating flexible OLEDs. While these devices were based on composite substrates, flexible OLEDs have also been reported on 100% CNF185 and 100% CNC substrates.186 Zhu et al. compared the potential of regenerated cellulose film and 100% CNF as transparent substrates in flexible electronics.185 The top-layer of CNF was made of bar coated CNT and the hole transport layer was made of evaporated molybdenum oxide and spin-coated PEDOT-PSS while the light-emitting layer was made of green polyfluorene. The manufactured OLED on nanopaper appeared to be stable in the bending state with a similar electrical performance to that of the flat state.

6. Perspectives and conclusions
Nanocellulose is promising in the development of renewable and biodegradable devices. As described in this review, nanocellulose is mostly used as a substrate in printed electronics. The majority of the published results compared the conductive performances obtained using nanocellulose substrates with those obtained with conventional substrates like glass and plastics. Regarding these performances, the low roughness of the nanopaper is obviously an important parameter allowing the printing of conductive tracks with higher printing quality and conductivity compared to those obtained on classical papers and similar to those obtained on plastic substrates. The performances of multilayer devices integrating such substrates have been more various but some studies reported similar or even increased performances thanks to the use of nanocellulosic paper.165,180
Few papers have evaluated the cost of the prepared nanocellulose substrates. Fang et al. evaluated the cost of nanopaper but the energy consumption quantification appeared very complex because of the numerous steps required for producing transparent nanopaper.187 Industrialization and the properties and price of nanocellulose should be considered to evaluate the possible breakthrough of cellulose nanopaper in the future market of printed electronics. Table 3 compares the properties of conventional substrates used in printed electronics with a 100% CNF nanopaper and a TEMPO-CNF (T-CNF) nanopaper. Since the commercial price of nanopaper is not available, the given prices are based on the raw material cost of CNF and T-CNF (ranging from 0.7 to 7 $ g−1) for a low weight nanopaper (20 g m−2). As can be seen from the table, the mechanical and thermal properties of nanopaper are much greater than those of conventional printed electronic papers and plastic substrates. Thermal stability is of particular interest as the electronic component and conductive tracks must withstand high temperatures. However, the price of nanopaper is much higher compared to the classic substrates. Even though nanopaper exhibits transparency, flexibility and improved mechanical and thermal properties, 100% CNF films are quite expensive. However, the nanocellulose price is expected to decrease with industrialization. Nanocellulose can then be used to provide a low-cost, renewable and biodegradable paper with improved properties for printed electronics. Hence, other aspects of nanocellulose such as the humidity sensitivity, yellowing of CNF/CNC films upon drying and their shelf life should be precisely investigated. Indeed, while the surface properties and thermal stability of the nanocellulosic substrate are key advantages of nanocellulosic substrates, the time-stability of such films might be, above its cost, an important issue. Indeed, upon considering opto-electrical applications like OLED or solar panels, a film yellowing or humidity sensitivity will not be acceptable. Thus ageing, under precise conditions, of such nanocellulosic substrates should also be studied according to targeted applications. In the same way, the shelf life of such substrates should be precisely evaluated and compared to that of classical printed electronics substrates before considering a possible substitution of plastic sheets by nanopapers.

Coating of nanocellulose is also one way to decrease the final substrate cost while taking advantage of the nanocellulose properties. Coating of both CNF and CNC has been studied for printing applications but no study has evaluated the impact of such coating on functional printing.
As of now, considering the price of CNF and CNC, we believe that their use in printed electronics should be focused on low-amount additives and high added value applications. The use of nanocellulose in conductive inks can be promising in this respect. Indeed, the use of nanocellulose as an additive in ink formulation can be promising given the cost of the conventional conductive raw material (10 $ g−1 for silver particles and 300 to 800 $ g−1 for silver nanowires for example). Using their properties for providing green dispersing and stabilizing agents would enhance the suspension stability while only having a small impact on the ink price. The use of nanocellulose as templates is also promising since only a small amount of nanocellulose is needed to achieve the percolation threshold. The amount of conductive material needed would then be decreased, thereby decreasing the production cost when adding a small amount of cellulose materials.
In conclusion, nanocellulose possesses very promising properties for various applications in flexible electronics ranging from inks to substrates. High added value applications can easily compensate for the actual price of nanocellulose and not be a restraint for their use in up-scaled applications. Even though properties such as ageing and humidity resistance still need to be evaluated, the enhanced properties of nanocellulose films such as their high thermal stability, high smoothness and high light transmittance are very promising for developing natural based substrates.
