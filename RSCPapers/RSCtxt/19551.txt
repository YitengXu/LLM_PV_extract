    , Accepted 31st December 2022First published on 13th January 2023AbstractThe limited selections of wide-bandgap polymer donors have prevented the further increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells. In this work, we report two novel wide-bandgap alternating copolymers (PL4 and PL5), which were synthesized by copolymerizing a new benzodithiophene-derived electron-rich unit (D) with two electron-deficient units (A) of 5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole and 1,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione, respectively. PL5 shows a broader and red-shifted absorption spectrum compared to PL4 due to the more electron-withdrawing feature of its A moiety. Moreover, the energy levels of PL5 are relatively down-shifted compared to those of PL4. When blended with a low-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor (Y6), the best-performing PL5:Y6-based device exhibits a significantly higher PCE of 15.77% with an enhanced VOC of 0.818 V, an excellent JSC of 26.60 mA cm−2, and a higher fill factor (FF) of 72.47% in comparison with the PL4:Y6-based PSC which shows a PCE of 7.53% with a VOC of 0.718 V, a JSC of 21.60 mA cm−2, and a FF of 48.58%. The improved PCE of the PL5:Y6-based device can be ascribed to its more efficient charge transfer, dramatically increased charge carrier mobilities and reduced charge recombination.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) will have a wide range of application scenarios because of their unique advantages, such as low-cost solution-based processing, light weight, and mechanical flexibility in comparison to the inorganic counterparts.1–7 So far, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been boosted to more than 18% on account of the innovations on high-performance active-layer materials,8–10 optimization of the film morphology,11,12 and improvements in interface engineering.13,14 Among them, the rapid advances in active-layer materials have made a great contribution to PCE breakthroughs in OSCs.15–19 In particular, the emergence of fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) provides plenty of room for the further PCE enhancement of OSC due to their narrow bandgaps with strong absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared regions, facile modification in structures, wide-range tunability of energy levels, and relatively stable film morphology compared to the traditional fullerene-derived acceptors.20 Thereafter, great efforts have been made for designing and synthesizing a large number of narrow bandgap FREAs and exploring the correlations between their molecular structures and device performance.21–26 However, for the active layer of OSCs, the donor and the acceptor materials play an equally important role in determining the film morphology, charge transport and the resulting photovoltaic performance of OSCs.27–30 Unfortunately, inherited from the development of fullerene-based OSCs, most polymer donor materials have narrow bandgap features, which are not favorable to achieve a complementary absorption with low bandgap FREAs.3,31–33 Therefore, there is a great need to design and synthesize novel wide-bandgap polymer donors for efficient OSCs.
Lin et al. reported a typical wide bandgap polymer donor named PffT2-FTAZ-2DT, which showed a complementary absorption with the low bandgap nonfullerene acceptor of IEIC, thereby leading to an excellent PCE of 7.3% for the resulting OSC.34 Except for a complementary absorption range, well-matched energy levels of a polymer donor and an acceptor are required to ensure a suitable driving force and to simultaneously reduce the voltage loss in the resulting device.35 For instance, Yan et al. developed a wide bandgap polymer donor of PvBDTTAZ, which showed matched energy levels with those of a low bandgap FREA (o-IDTBR), thereby achieving an excellent PCE of 11.6% with a low voltage loss of 0.55 V.36 Since 2015, benzodithiophene-based wide bandgap polymer donors have been frequently used for enhancing the PCEs of OSCs, and most high-efficiency (PCE > 16%) OSCs were fabricated by using PM6,37 D18,38 or PBQx-TF39 as wide bandgap polymer donors. We noticed that the chemical structures of those polymer donors (PM6, D18, and PBQx-TF) share the same electron-rich unit (D) of benzodithiophene with alkylthienyl substitutions in the central benzene ring. It is known that the two alkylthienyl substitutions can also be introduced into the thiophene rings of the benzodithiophene core. However, polymer donors based on benzodithiophene with alkylthienyl substitutions in the thiophene rings have never been reported, to the best of our knowledge.
In this context, we rationally design a new benzodithiophene with 2-alkylthienyl groups at the β-position of thiophene rings and two alkoxyl groups on the benzene ring (Scheme 1). By copolymerizing the electron-rich unit with the typical electron-deficient monomers of 5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d] [1,2,3]triazole and 1,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione, two wide bandgap copolymers (PL4 and PL5) were synthesized and characterized, respectively. Compared to PL4, PL5 shows a red-shifted absorption band and deeper-lying energy levels. When blended with the low-bandgap acceptor of Y6 (Fig. S1, ESI†), the PL5:Y6-based device shows more efficient charge generation, weaker charge recombination, more compact intermolecular π–π stacking, and higher and more balanced charge transport than the PL4:Y6-based counterpart. Therefore, the PL5:Y6-based device delivers a champion PCE of 15.77% (VOC = 0.818 V, JSC = 26.60 mA cm−2, and FF = 72.47%), which is more than twice as high as that of the PL4:Y6-based device (PCE = 7.53%).

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route for PL4 and PL5 is depicted in Scheme 1, and the experimental details as well as characterization details are provided in the ESI.† Compounds 1 and 3 were prepared according to previously reported procedures.40,41 Compound 2 was synthesized in 73% yield through the Negishi coupling reaction. Compound 4 was subsequently synthesized with 98% yield in the presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium as a catalyst. By bromination of compound 4, compound 5 was afforded in 71% yield. Finally, polymerization between compound 5 and 5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (6) gave PL4 in 76% yield. Similar to PL4, PL5 was synthesized in 70% yield by Stille coupling polymerization between compound 5 and 1,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (7). The number average molecular weight (Mn), weight average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) of PL4 and PL5 were evaluated by high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography at 150 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent. The Mn values for PL4 and PL5 are 55.1 and 64.3 kg mol−1 and their Mw values are 119.8 and 154.8 kg mol−1, respectively. Thus, the PDI values for PL4 and PL5 were determined to be 2.17 and 2.41, respectively. Both PL4 and PL5 show excellent solubility in dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF), toluene, etc., suggesting their good solution-processing potential.
Photophysical and electrochemical properties
Ultraviolet-vis (UV-vis) absorption spectra for PL4 and PL5 were recorded in diluted chloroform (CF) solutions and thin films (Fig. 1) to evaluate the influence of electron-accepting segments on their optical properties. The related optical parameters for PL4 and PL5 are summarized in Table 1. In CF solutions, both PL4 and PL5 have intense absorption in the wavelength range from 450 to 580 nm due to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-donating unit to the electron-accepting unit (A). However, the absorption profiles for the two polymer donors are different. PL4 shows a “dual band” absorption spectrum with two main absorption peaks (λmaxsol) located around 530 and 570 nm, respectively. The shorter wavelength absorption peak of PL4 is generally attributed to the localized π–π* transitions and the longer absorption band (550–600 nm) originating from the strong ICT effect. The replacement of the A segment in PL4 with a stronger electron withdrawing unit leads to another wide bandgap copolymer (PL5), which has a ∼30 nm broader absorption band than PL4. Both PL4 and PL5 show bathochromically shifted absorption spectra in the thin-film state compared to the counterparts in solutions, suggesting an increased intermolecular interaction in thin films. As depicted in Fig. 1b, the absorption edges (λonsetfilm) of PL4 and PL5 in films are slightly red-shifted by approximately 11 and 13 nm, respectively. In addition, the optical bandgap (Egopt) of PL4 is 2.03 eV, which was calculated from the absorption edge (λonsetfilm), while that of PL5 reduces to 1.90 eV. Overall, the broader and red-shifted absorption band of PL5 is beneficial to achieving higher short-circuit current density (JSC) values of the corresponding devices than the PL4-based counterparts. In general, both the polymer donors have complementary absorption spectra with the benchmark electron acceptor material of Y6.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was utilized to estimate the frontier molecular orbits of the two polymer donors. The CV curves for two donors and the energy level diagram for PL4, PL5, and Y6 are displayed in Fig. 1c and d, respectively, and the related electrochemical parameters are outlined in Table 1. According to oxidation and reduction onset potentials, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels can be calculated by using the equation of EHOMO/ELUMO = −(φox/φred + 4.82) eV. As shown in Fig. 1d, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PL4 were estimated to be −5.56 and −3.50 eV, respectively. Nonetheless, with a change in the electron-deficient unit, PL5 has slightly deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels (−5.58 and −3.54 eV) in comparison with PL4. The down-shifted HOMO energy level of PL5 is conducive to obtaining a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the resulting device than that of the PL4-based device. Meanwhile, both the molecular energy levels of the two donor polymers are matched with those of Y6, which is helpful to facilitate efficient exciton dissociation and thus enhance the photovoltaic performance of the resulting OSCs.
Photovoltaic performance
In order to study the photovoltaic performance difference between PL4 and PL5, conventional OSC devices were fabricated. In detail, the architecture of the conventional devices is indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer donor:Y6/PDIN/Ag. Here, Y6 was selected as the electron acceptor due to its well-matched absorption spectrum and suitable energy levels with the two as-synthesized polymer donors. In addition, different processing conditions were used to optimize the photovoltaic performance of devices, such as the additive amount and the thermal annealing temperature. The optimization details of the corresponding OSCs are listed in Table S1.† The optimal device preparation conditions are summarized as follows: a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.4, an active layer material concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in CF with a 1% solvent additive of 1, 8-diiodooctane (DIO), and the thermal annealing temperature at 85 °C for 5 min. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of OSCs based on PL4:Y6 and PL5:Y6 are displayed in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters with charge carrier mobilities are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 2a, the device based on PL4:Y6 exhibited a poor PCE of 7.53%, accompanied by a VOC of 0.718 V, a JSC of 21.60 mA cm−2, and a FF of 48.58%. In comparison, the PL5:Y6-based device demonstrated a much higher PCE of 15.77% owing to the simultaneously increased photovoltaic parameters (VOC = 0.818 V, JSC = 26.60 mA cm−2, and FF = 72.47%). The increased VOC value for the PL5:Y6-based device is partially attributed to the relatively deeper-lying HOMO energy level of PL5. And the much higher FF for the PL5:Y6-based device could be related to the improved morphology of the PL5:Y6-based blend in comparison with that of the PL4:Y6-based blend. The PCE of the best-performing PL5-Y6-based OSC is comparable to that of the PM6-based counterpart, suggesting great potential for the wide-bandgap D–A copolymers synthesized in this work.14

External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded to check the accuracy of the J–V measurements in this work. As depicted in Fig. 2b, both the devices based on PL4:Y6 and PL5:Y6 show similar photoresponse ranges from 300 to 1000 nm. However, the photoresponse intensities of PL4:Y6- and PL5:Y6-based devices are distinctly different. The PL5:Y6-based device displayed EQE values over 80% in the wavelength range of 510–840 nm, higher than the PL4:Y6-based counterpart (60%). These results suggest that the photoelectron conversion process for the PL5:Y6-based device is more efficient than that for the device based on PL4:Y6, which is in line with the increased JSC value for the former. Additionally, the JSC values integrated from the EQE spectra for the PL4- and PL5-based devices are 20.99 and 26.09 mA cm−2, respectively, which closely match with the JSC values obtained from J–V curves within 3% error.
Charge generation, transport, and recombination
To reveal intrinsic reasons for the photovoltaic performance differences between PL4 and PL5, the charge generation, charge dissociation and extraction properties of the corresponding photovoltaic devices were studied. According to the relationship of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective applied voltage (Veff) (Fig. 2c), the charge dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) of PL4:Y6- and PL5:Y6-based devices can be calculated by using the expression of Pdiss = Jph/Jsat. As shown in Fig. 2c, both the Jph values of PL4:Y6- and PL5:Y6-based OSCs reached saturation (Veff ≥ 2 V). The Jsat values for PL4:Y6- and PL5:Y6-based devices are 22.09 and 24.43 mA cm−2, corresponding to Pdiss values of 0.96 and 0.99, respectively. The higher Pdiss value indicates a more efficient charge generation in the PL5:Y6-based device compared to that in the PL4:Y6-based OSC. We also investigated the charge recombination in the PL4:Y6- and PL5:Y6-based OSCs by learning the relationship between JSC and light density (Plight), which can be expressed by the equation of JSC ∝ Plightα, where the α value is a key indicator of the bimolecular recombination rate in OSCs. Compared to the PL5:Y6-based device (α = 0.998), the PL4:Y6-based device suffers from a relatively severe bimolecular recombination rate (α = 0.979), thus leading to low EQE and FF values of the resulting OSCs.
Investigation on the charge transfer behaviors of the polymer donor:Y6 blends can partially explain the photovoltaic performance differences of the resulting OSCs. Here, the charge transfer behaviors of the neat films based on PL4, PL5, Y6, and their blend films were studied by using photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements. Both the polymer donor:Y6-based blends were prepared under the same conditions as those for the best-performing solar cell devices. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, both the polymer donors display strong PL in the wavelength range of 600–850 nm under an excitation wavelength of 550 nm. When the two polymers were blended with Y6, respectively, the PL of PL5 was completely quenched by Y6 with a quenching efficiency of approximately 98%, implying an efficient electron transfer from PL5 to Y6. In contrast, the electron transfer from PL4 to Y6 was relatively inefficient with a lower quenching efficiency of 80.8%. Fig. 3b shows the PL spectra of the Y6-based neat film and the donor:Y6-based blends under an excitation wavelength of 780 nm. The PL of Y6 in the range of 800–1000 nm was drastically quenched by over 98% when blended with PL4 or PL5, suggesting efficient hole transfer from Y6 to PL4 or to PL5. In general, the efficient electron and hole transfer in the blend based on PL5:Y6 is beneficial for obtaining a high JSC value for the resulting OSC.

The SCLC method was further utilized to measure the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of PL4:Y6- and PL5:Y6-based blends by fabricating single-carrier devices. The detailed charge mobilities are summarized in Table 2. As plotted in Fig. S2a and b (ESI†), the μh and μe values of the PL5:Y6-based devices were calculated to be 3.96 × 10−4 and 1.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while the PL4:Y6-based blend showed decreased μh and μe values of 4.99 × 10−5 and 1.64 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Meanwhile, the μh/μe ratio of the PL5:Y6-based blend film was calculated to be 2.87, slightly smaller than that of the PL4:Y6-based blend film (3.13). Overall, the higher and more balanced charge carrier mobilities of the PL5:Y6-based blend indicate the less charge recombination of the corresponding device and therefore favoring its higher EQE and JSC values.
Film morphology
Two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) was used to explore the molecular packing and the relative crystallinity of PL4, PL5, and the corresponding blend films. Fig. 4 shows the 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding one-dimensional line-cuts. The related parameters, including d-spacing and crystal coherence length (CCL), are outlined in Table S2 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4, (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and (100) diffraction peaks in the in-plane (IP)direction appear in both the pure PL4 and PL5 films, indicating that they tend to adopt a “face-on” orientation. The dominant “face-on” orientation favors efficient charge transport of the copolymers in the direction perpendicular to the substrate. For the PL4 and PL5 neat films, the (010) π–π stacking distance (dπ) in the OOP direction is determined to be 3.81 Å and 3.76 Å, respectively, and their (100) lamellar distances (dl) in the IP direction are calculated to be 21.16 and 21.59 Å, respectively. The PL5:Y6-based blend film shows a π–π stacking distance of 3.65 Å, which is relatively shorter than that of the PL4:Y6-based blend film (3.70 Å). The reduced π–π stacking distance of the PL5-based blend in comparison with that of the PL4-based blend is consistent with the higher hole mobility for the former one (3.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1versus 4.99 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, the CCLs for π–π stacking (14.45 Å) and lamellar stacking (63.05 Å) of the PL5:Y6-based blend are slightly larger than those of the PL4:Y6-based counterparts (12.83 Å for π–π stacking and 58.60 Å for lamellar stacking). The increased CCLs for the PL5:Y6-based blend suggest its more ordered molecular stacking and enhanced crystallinity in comparison with the PL4:Y6-based blend. These results are generally consistent with the more efficient charge transport and the reduced bimolecular recombination obtained for the photovoltaic device based on PL5:Y6 in comparison to those for the PL4:Y6-based device.

The nanoscale phase separation of the PL4:Y6- and the PL5:Y6-based blends was monitored by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in a peak force quantitative nanomechanical (QNM) mode. As found in Fig. 5a and b, both PL4:Y6- and PL5:Y6-based blends have uniform and smooth surfaces. A root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.98 nm was determined for the PL4:Y6-based blend film, larger than the 1.72 nm RMS roughness for the PL5:Y6-based counterpart. The smaller RMS roughness is beneficial for an improved ohmic contact between the active layer and the interface layer of the PL5:Y6-based device in comparison with that for the PL4:Y6-based counterpart. In addition, compared to the PL4:Y6-based blend film, the PL5:Y6-based blend has more suitable phase separation (Fig. 5c and d) with smaller domain sizes, which is also beneficial for achieving higher JSC and FF values of the corresponding OSC.42

Conclusions
In summary, a novel soluble benzodithiophene-based electron-donating unit has been designed and synthesized by introducing 2-alkylthienyl side-chains on its thiophene rings. Subsequently, two wide-bandgap copolymers (PL4 and PL5) were obtained by copolymerizing the benzodithiophene-based monomer with two typical electron-withdrawing monomers of 5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole and 1,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione, respectively. Compared with PL4, PL5 has a broader absorption band, down-shifted energy levels, and a reduced π–π interaction distance. When blended with Y6, the PL5:Y6-based device exhibited more efficient charge generation, a lower charge recombination rate, much higher (μh = 3.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 1.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and more balanced charge mobilities, and more suitable phase separation than the counterparts based on PL4:Y6 (μh = 5.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Therefore, the PL5:Y6-based device yielded a champion PCE of 15.77% accompanied by a VOC of 0.818 V, a JSC of 26.60 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.47%. In contrast, the device based on PL4:Y6 showed an inferior PCE of 7.53% with a low VOC of 0.718 V, an inferior JSC of 21.60 mA cm−2, and a poor FF of 48.58%. Our results demonstrate that the new soluble benzodithiophene derivative with multiple side-chains developed in the work is an excellent electron-rich unit for constructing efficient wide bandgap copolymers, which could achieve comparable PCEs with the benchmark donor polymers such as PM6, PBQx-TF and D18. By further copolymer optimization in the molecular weights, electron-deficient units and side-chains, more wide bandgap copolymers with even better photovoltaic performance could be expected.
