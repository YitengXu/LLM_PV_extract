Compared to an unmodified DSSC, the power conversion efficiency of a DSSC with SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs (SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSC) increased from 3.92% to 4.82%, an enhancement of approximately 23.0%.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were first reported in 1991 by O'Regan and Grätzel and have since gained much attention owing to their low cost and high power-conversion efficiency.1,2 However, the power-conversion efficiency of DSSCs needs to be further improved for them to be used as an economically viable alternative to conventional photovoltaic devices.
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are considered promising materials with potential to be used as sensitizers or as optional light harvesters because they exhibit a broad light-absorption spectrum, tunable emission wavelength, and multiple exciton generation.3,4 Lee and Lo reported that QDs are used as cosensitizers to improve the power-conversion efficiency of DSSCs.5 However, owing to their poor stability, a considerable decrease in the quantum yield of QDs is observed in iodide/triiodide-based electrolytes, thereby making it difficult to apply QDs as re-emitters in conventional DSSCs.6,7
The encapsulation of QDs using silica has many advantages including water compatibility, facile chemical modification, low cytotoxicity, and excellent chemical stability.8–10 However, the quantum yield of QDs dramatically decreases upon coating with silica. Very recently, we reported the successful synthesis of silica-coated QD-embedded silica nanoparticles (SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs) without any loss in quantum yield.11 Additionally, these multiple-QD-containing NPs are brighter than single QDs, enabling an easier handling because of their bigger size (120 nm).
In this study, we immobilized SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs on an active layer in a DSSC with SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs (SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSC) and demonstrated that these SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs were stable and enhanced the efficiency of the DSSC. The SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSC was analyzed using UV-vis spectroscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) to verify the function of SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs.
The fabrication of SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSCs and the structure of SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs are shown in Fig. 1. The TiO2 layer was controlled by the doctor blade method and its thickness was 6 μm. The DSSC contained N719 as the sensitizer and had a layer of SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs for providing extra light to the TiO2 layer. Briefly, the TiO2 paste was coated onto the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, followed by sintering. The SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs were then introduced onto a TiO2 layer using a spin coater (Fig. 1a(i)), followed by the adsorption of the N719 dye (Fig. 1a(ii)).

The schematic and the corresponding TEM image displayed in Fig. 1b highlight that the SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs exhibit a core–shell structure.11 The prepared SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs consist of 6 nm QDs (maximum emission at 630 nm) immobilized on a 120 nm-diameter SiO2 NP core and a SiO2 shell. The silica shell surface was coated to provide chemical stability to the QDs in an iodide/triiodide-based electrolyte. The resulting SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs showed quantum yields of 64%.

Fig. 2a shows the J–V curves of DSSCs; their properties are summarized in Table 1. To demonstrate the increasing efficiency of the SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSCs, an unmodified DSSC was also fabricated for comparison. The unmodified DSSC exhibited a current density (Jsc) value of 7.38 mA cm−2 and an efficiency of 3.92%. In comparison, the SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSC showed an increased efficiency value of 4.82% because of the increased Jsc (9.28 mA cm−2). Thus, compared to the unmodified DSSC, the power-conversion efficiency was increased by 23.0%. The fabricated solar cells were analyzed using IPCE spectroscopy (Fig. 2b). The IPCE spectrum of the SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSC was better than that of the unmodified DSSC across a broad wavelength range, indicating the positive effect of the light-harvesting layer.11–13

The UV-vis absorbance spectra of the cells are shown in Fig. 3a. A greater absorbance is observed when TiO2 is modified by SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs. Both types of films, TiO2 + SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs with and without the N719 dye, exhibit better UV-vis absorbance than the corresponding films without a layer of SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs (Fig. 3a). We further analyzed the solar cells using CLSM (Fig. 3b). When the SiO2 and SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs on the active layers were irradiated by a laser (1 mW power) at a distance of 543 nm from the FTO layer to SiO2/QD/SiO2, no fluorescence originating from the SiO2 NPs on the active layer could be detected. However, the SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs on the active layer did exhibit fluorescence owing to the QDs. The fact that the QDs in the working electrode display fluorescence indicates that they are in a stable state. Additionally, the results indicate that the light radiation could reach the SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs. Fig. 3c shows the long-term stability of the SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSC in an iodide/triiodide-based electrolyte. The SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSC was measured under air mass 1.5 and stored under dark (soaking) conditions. Variations in the efficiency and Jsc were investigated as a function of time. Even after 168 h, the efficiency and Jsc showed similar values, indicating that the SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs coated with a silica shell remain stable in the iodide/triiodide-based electrolyte. Thus, it can be concluded that the SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs in a DSSC can act as a light-harvesting layer, because they increase the efficiency and are stable for a long duration.

Furthermore, different types of solar cells—without dye and one with SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs on the working electrode—were prepared (Table 2). The solar cell without SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs exhibited the Jsc, Voc, fill factor (ff), and efficiency (η) values of 0.28 mA cm−2, 0.57 V, 0.59, and 0.10% respectively. For the same set of parameters, the solar cell with SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs showed the corresponding values of 0.28 mA cm−2, 0.59 V, 0.59, and 0.10%, respectively. The efficiency was not changed by SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs without dye, suggesting that SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs did not affect the solar cell as sensitizers. Thus, we verified that the main role of SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs is not acting as cosensitizers but as the harvesting layers of extra light.

In conclusion, we fabricated a SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSC that exhibited 23.0% better efficiency than the corresponding unmodified DSSC. Moreover, as the silica shell protected the QDs from degradation in an iodide/triiodide-based electrolyte, the values of Jsc and η in the SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSC were retained for (at least) 168 h. Moreover, SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs did not work as sensitizers but as the harvesting layers of extra light. We expect that our methods can be applied to other types of DSSCs to increase their efficiency. The synergistic effect of matching the wavelength of light emitted by QDs and the absorbance wavelength of dyes on the enhancement of DSSC efficiency is currently under investigation. Further studies on the size effects of QDs and SiO2 NPs are also in progress.
Experimental
Preparation of SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs11
Silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) were prepared by the established Stöber method. A 3 mL aliquot of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) was added to 40 mL of ethanol (EtOH) containing 1.6 mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) under continuous vigorous magnetic stirring at 25 °C for 20 h. The SiO2 NPs were centrifuged and washed with EtOH five times.
The prepared SiO2 NPs were thiol-functionalized using 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTS). A 300 mg sample of SiO2 NPs was dispersed in 6 mL of EtOH containing 60 μL of MPTS and 150 μL of NH4OH. The solution was stirred at 25 °C for 12 h. The resulting MPTS-treated SiO2 NPs were centrifuged and washed with EtOH three times.
A 100 mg sample of the MPTS-treated SiO2 NPs was then dispersed in 2 mL of EtOH, which was subsequently added to a solution of 100 mg of QDs (Nanosquare Inc., emission: 620 nm, core–shell type: CdSe–ZnS) dissolved in 0.5 μL of CHCl3. After shaking for 5 min, 20 mL of CHCl3, 1 mL of MPTS, and 1 mL of NH4OH were added to the solution. After further shaking for 1 h, the resulting solution was centrifuged and washed with EtOH five times. The collected powder residue was then dispersed in another solution containing 40 mL of EtOH, 1 mL of TEOS, and 1 mL of NH4OH. The resultant solution was then shaken one final time for 12 h, after which it was centrifuged and washed with EtOH five times. Then, SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs were dispersed in EtOH.
Fabrication of SiO2/QD/SiO2 DSSCs
The TiO2 paste was prepared using TiO2 powder (6 g), ethyl cellulose (3 g), acetic acid (1 mL), α-terpineol (20 g), and H2O (5 mL) in EtOH (130 mL). This paste was ground for 24 h using a ball mill,14 after which it was coated onto an FTO-glass substrate by the doctor blade method and then annealed under atmospheric conditions at 450 °C for 1 h. A sample of SiO2@QD@SiO2 NPs dispersed in EtOH was introduced onto the TiO2 layer using a spin coater at room temperature. The thickness of the SiO2/QD/SiO2 layer was controlled by the number of spin coatings. The substrate was then immersed in a 0.5 mM solution of (Bu4N)2Ru(dobpyH)2(NCS)2 (N719, Solaronix) in absolute EtOH at 50 °C for 8 h. The electrolyte used comprised 0.7 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidium thiocyanate (GSCN), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v). Pt was sputter-coated onto another FTO-glass substrate as the counter electrode. The working electrode was sandwiched with the sputtered Pt–FTO glass using 60 μm-thick surlyn as a melting sheet.
Instruments
The shape and size of the SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs were confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Jeol Inc., JEM 1010), and the photocurrent and voltage were measured using a digital source meter (Keithley instruments Inc., Model 2400) under air mass 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). The fluorescence of SiO2/QD/SiO2 NPs was imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss-LSM510). The IPCE value was measured using a Polaronix K3100 IPCE (McScience), where the light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single-crystal Si cell.
