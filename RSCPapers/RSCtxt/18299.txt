    , Accepted 27th May 2021First published on 3rd June 2021AbstractInspired by natural photosynthesis, direct Z-scheme heterostructures are considered as promising photocatalysts for solar-driven water splitting and attract ever-growing interest. To date, it is still a challenge to achieve a high efficiency based on direct Z-scheme photocatalysts for overall water splitting, because suitable band gaps and overpotentials for both half-reactions and spatially separated catalytic sites should be fulfilled simultaneously in a photocatalytic system. These challenges can be solved by taking advantage of the intrinsic dipole effect for polarized materials. Here, we propose a new strategy to achieve this goal by constructing van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures based on two-dimensional (2D) polarized materials. Using density functional theory calculations, we predict a promising photocatalyst In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure, with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) taking place separately on the SnP3 and In2Se3 layers. It is found that the intrinsic dipole of the In2Se3 monolayer effectively enhances the redox abilities for both the HER and OER. Moreover, the intrinsic dipole can promote the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, and also contributes to a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 19.26%, which is quite promising for commercial applications. This work opens up an avenue for the design of highly efficient Z-scheme photocatalysts for overall water splitting.
Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting utilizes sustainable solar energy to generate O2 and H2 without polluting the environment.1,2 Its efficiency is primarily determined by three processes: (1) light harvesting; (2) the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation and migration to the surface of semiconductors (active/reaction site); (3) the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the surface of photocatalysts.3–5 For single-component photocatalysts, the charge separation efficiency is quiet low due to the recombination of electron–hole pairs induced by the strong coulombic force.3,5 Type-II photocatalysts assembled from two semiconductors with a staggered band structure configuration can promote the spatial separation and suppress the recombination of charge carriers.6,7 However, the formation of type-II heterojunctions reduces the redox ability of the system, and thereby the driving force for photocatalytic reactions.4,5,8 Moreover, it is difficult for conventional type-II heterojunctions to simultaneously possess a wide light absorption range and strong redox ability. This is understandable since the light-absorption range requires a small band gap, but the strong redox ability needs to widen the band gap.3,5 Furthermore, type-II heterojunction photocatalysts mainly focus on the half reaction by utilizing one type of charge carrier. Consequently, the remaining photogenerated carriers need to be consumed by sacrificial reagents to suppress photocorrosion; this may cause the secondary pollution and consumption of natural resources.3,9
Inspired by natural photosynthesis in green plants, direct Z-scheme photocatalytic systems were proposed to overcome these drawbacks for overall water splitting based on type-II heterojunctions.5,8,10,11 Although direct Z-scheme photocatalysts possess many merits, such as increased light harvesting, spatially separated reductive and oxidative active sites, and well-preserved strong redox ability, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of current Z-scheme systems is still far from that required for economically feasible applications for their commercialization.11–13 The maximum STH efficiency of Z-scheme systems for theoretical stimulations is predicted to be 10.5% in a MoSe2/SnSe2 heterostructure.14 One of the challenges is that the formation of a direct Z-scheme is highly dependent on the nature of the semiconductor, which limits the flexibility in material selection.5,12 In theory, the difference (1.23 eV) between the redox potentials of H+/H2 and H2O/O2 further limits the applications of semiconductors with a narrow band gap in Z-scheme photocatalysts, because kinetic overpotentials are demanded to drive catalytic reactions. Therefore, highly efficient direct Z-scheme photocatalysts based on semiconductors with a narrow band gap (<1.2 eV) and strong redox ability to achieve solar-driven spontaneous overall water splitting have rarely been reported.14,15
Two dimensional (2D) materials show excellent performances for photocatalytic water splitting, due to their large surface area, high carrier mobility, short carrier migration distance and tunable electronic structures.16–18 Recently, 2D polarized materials with an intrinsic dipole have been proposed as promising photocatalysts for water splitting.19–25 First, the intrinsic dipole can efficiently separate photogenerated carriers. Second, the intrinsic dipole induces a shift of the redox potentials of H+/H2 and H2O/O2 at the two surfaces of materials, and thus breaks the conventional limitation of 1.23 eV for the difference between the redox potentials of H+/H2 and H2O/O2. This makes it possible to achieve solar-driven spontaneous overall water splitting using photocatalysts with a narrow band gap, leading to enhanced light absorption.9,20
Although some 2D polarized materials have been theoretically proved to be potential photocatalysts for water splitting, such as III2–VI3 materials,21 Li-III–VI compounds20 and Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),25 Z-scheme photocatalysts based on 2D polarized materials and the effects of the intrinsic dipole in these structures have not yet been explored. More recently, by stacking Janus materials, the intrinsic vertical electric field leads to a rigid shift of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) resulting in a large band offset and a small interlayer band gap.19,26–29 Inspired by these studies, we assumed that one can make use of the shift of the CBM and VBM due to the intrinsic diploe for polarized layers to construct a Z-scheme junction based on the polarized layers. In this case, the shift of the CBM and VBM would enhance redox ability and the reduced interlayer band gap would favor the recombination of photogenerated carries with lower redox ability. Therefore, to construct a highly efficient Z-scheme heterostructure for photocatalytic water splitting, a narrow band-gap is first needed to achieve a large light absorption. Second, a suitable intrinsic dipole for polarized materials is preferred to improve the separation of photogenerated carriers and enhance the redox abilities for heterostructures. Moreover, a high carrier mobility is required which helps the fast migration of carriers to the surface of heterostructures, and a type-II band alignment is expected which is a prerequisite to achieve the Z-scheme system mode.
In this contribution, we report an In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure as a potential highly efficient direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for overall water splitting. Using the density functional theory (DFT) method, we systematically investigated a series of Janus Group-III chalcogenides (M2XY, M = Ga, In; X = S, Se; Y = Se, Te; X ≠ Y) and III2–VI3 groups (M2X3, M = Ga, In; X = S, Se, Te). We found that the M2XY and M2X3 layers can effectively separate photogenerated carries, and the intrinsic diploe for these polarized materials leads to a rigid shift for redox potentials at the two surfaces of materials, resulting in the enhancement of the redox abilities.
To further investigate the role of the intrinsic dipole for polarized materials in heterostructures, we constructed a series of heterostructures by stacking two different polarized monolayers together. Our calculation results show that, due to the intrinsic dipole of polarized materials, different contact surfaces will lead to different charge transfer modes (Z-scheme or type-II heterojunction). More importantly, we found that for Z-scheme heterostructures, to enhance the redox abilities, the intrinsic dipole of the polarized layer should possess the same direction as the interfacial electric field of the heterostructure and they will be reduced conversely. Based on these findings, we construct an In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure, which is a Z-scheme photocatalyst for overall water splitting with large overpotentials for both the HER (0.58 eV) and OER (0.89 eV). Moreover, due to the strong intrinsic dipole of the polarized In2Se3 layer, the photogenerated electrons of In2Se3 and holes of SnP3 accumulate at the interface of the heterostructure and would recombine with each other rapidly under the interfacial electric field, while the photogenerated holes of In2Se3 and electrons of SnP3 remained on the two surface sides of heterostructures participating in the HER and OER. Finally, a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 19.26% was achieved in the direct Z-scheme In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure for photocatalytic water splitting, which is larger than that of conventional Z-scheme photocatalysts.
Results and discussion
The role of the intrinsic dipole in polarized materials
We first investigated a series of 2D polarized materials, which includes Janus Group-III chalcogenides (M2XY, M = Ga, In; X = S, Se; Y = Se, Te; X ≠ Y) and III2–VI3 groups (M2X3, M = Ga, In; X = S, Se, Te), and the representative geometric structures are shown in Fig. 1(a). Janus Group-III chalcogenides consist of four atomic layers with the two M layers sandwiched by different X and Y atoms on the two sides and the stable 2D M2X3 monolayers show quintuple layer structures of X–M–X–M–X. The calculated lattice parameters, bond lengths and band gap of Janus M2XY monolayers and M2X3 monolayers (listed in Table S1†) agree well with previous reports.21,30,31 The asymmetric structure for 2D polarized materials breaks the centrosymmetry of the 2D plane, giving rise to an intrinsic dipole along the z direction which induces a vertical electric field (E) and the direction of E is plotted as shown in Fig. 1(a).

The horizontal black line indicates the Fermi level, which is set to zero. (d) A schematic plot of energy levels and photocatalytic mechanism for the polarized materials. The green and blue dashed lines represent the redox potentials for the HER (H+/H2) and OER (O2/H2O), respectively. χ(H2) is the potential difference between the CBM and redox potential of H+/H2, while χ(O2) is the potential difference between the VBM and redox potential of H2O/O2. 
We present the difference of electrostatic potential ΔΦ between the top and bottom atomic layers for different 2D polarized monolayers in Fig. 1(b); the average Hartree difference potential ΔVH of Janus monolayer Ga2STe along the cross-plane direction was plotted in the inset. We found that In2STe (0.67 eV) and Ga2STe (0.84 eV) exhibit a larger ΔΦ due to the large difference between S and Te atoms, and for the group M2X3, the ΔΦ decreases as the X atom changes from the S atom to the Te atom. The calculated projected band structure and partial charge analysis of monolayer In2STe in Fig. 1(c) show that the VBM and CBM are mainly originated from the top two atom layers (S and In1) and the bottom atom layers (Te and In2) of monolayer In2STe, respectively. This result means spatially separated reductive and oxidative active sites in monolayer In2STe and the spatial distributions of the VBM and CBM for other M2XY and M2X3 groups can been seen in Fig. S1.† More importantly, the intrinsic electric field of polarized materials can further promote the effective separation of photogenerated carries under light irradiation.
Due to the built-in electric dipole in 2D polarized materials, the two vacuum levels for their two surfaces are different from the conventional 2D semiconductors. In the latter case, there is only one vacuum level, and thus the redox potentials of materials are the same on the two surfaces. However, for 2D polarized materials the vacuum level difference in the perpendicular direction between the top and bottom atomic layers can result in rigid shift of the redox potentials of H+/H2 and H2O/O2 between the two surfaces, as shown in Fig. 1(d). The shift of redox potentials at the two surfaces would increase the overpotentials of the HER χ(H2) and OER χ(O2) for polarized materials, which represent the redox abilities of photogenerated carriers and thus are important criteria for evaluating the performance of photocatalysts during the water splitting process.
The detailed χ(H2) and χ(O2) are listed in Table 1, as well as the band gaps and band type which determine the efficiency of light harvesting. Due to the breaking of mirror symmetry by the charge polarization and the strong built-in electric field introduced, the Janus M2STe and M2SeTe monolayers present a direct band-gap with the band gap in the range of 1.64 to 1.97 eV, in contrast to the intrinsic MX single layers, which are all indirect band-gap semiconductors with band gaps ranging from 1.33 to 2.44 eV. However, the In2SSe and Ga2SSe monolayers are still indirect band-gap semiconductors with band gaps of 2.36 and 2.96 eV respectively. All the M2X3 monolayers exhibit an indirect band gap, and among them In2Se3 (1.37 eV), In2Te3 (1.12 eV) and Ga2Te3 (0.77 eV) possess a narrow band gap, which favours the adsorption of sun light. Considering the energy loss during carrier migration between different materials, the required overpotentials for the HER and OER are assumed to be 0.2 and 0.6 eV, respectively.21 Although the intrinsic dipole of polarized materials can lead to a large shift of the redox potentials of H+/H2 and H2O/O2 between the two surfaces, resulting in an increase of overpotentials χ(H2) and χ(O2), only In2SeTe and Ga2Se3 monolayers can achieve spontaneous solar-driven overall water splitting along with a suitable band gap. In2SSe, Ga2SSe and Ga2S3 possess large χ(H2) over 0.2 eV and large χ(O2) over 0.6 eV; however the large indirect band gaps limit their light adsorption efficiency, which would affect the photocatalytic efficiency.

Geometric structures and band structures of heterostructures
To construct highly efficient Z-scheme photocatalysts for overall water splitting, as shown in Fig. 2, we built a series of heterostructures based on the above 2D polarized materials: In2STe/Ga2STe, In2STe/In2SeTe, In2Se3/In2Te3, In2Se3/Ga2Te3 and In2Te3/Ga2Te3 systems. Owing to their close lattice constants, the heterostructures are built by their unit cells containing 8 or 10 atoms in total with the energetically most stable configuration being the AA′ model (see Fig. S2 and Table S2† in detail). In2STe/InS systems, containing one polarized material layer and one non-polarized material layer, are also constructed for comparison, as shown in Fig. 2(a). To investigate the role of the intrinsic dipole for polarized materials in heterostructures, we constructed two types of polarized heterostructures for each system according to different atomic stacking orders. As shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), the intrinsic dipole for two polarized layers in heterostructures are in the same direction. The band structures of these heterostructures show that the majority of these heterostructures formed a type-II band alignment, see Fig. 2(d), which is a prerequisite to achieve the Z-scheme system mode. Due to the strong built-in electric field, the charge transfer can affect the band alignment of heterostructures. The superposition of strong intrinsic dipoles for the two polarized monolayers in heterostructures with the same direction would cause a shift of the band edges of each monolayer leading to a large band offset and small interlayer band gap, much smaller than those of the monolayers which is beneficial for the recombination of photogenerated carriers with lower redox ability.19 Especially, In2Te3–In2Se3 and Ga2Te3–In2Se3 have relatively larger charge transfer at the interfaces, resulting in a high internal electric field Ein of 0.58 and 0.65 eV. Therefore, the band edges shift considerably due to the strong interaction between the two layers, which turns In2Te3–In2Se3 and Ga2Te3–In2Se3 into type-III heterostructures. The SGa2Te–SIn2Te and In2Se3–In2Te3 systems are type-I heterostructures, whose VBM and CBM are contributed by the same layer. The charge transfer Q, the interlayer distance dl, the binding energy Eb, and the internal electric field Ein of vertical M2XY and M2X3 heterostructures in different types of stacking are listed in Tables S2 and S3.†

The orange arrows indicate the direction of the intrinsic dipole for the polarized monolayers. It is noted that the structures for the rest In2STe/In2SeTe, In2Se3/In2Te3, and In2Se3/Ga2Te3 systems are similar to the above structures, in which the intrinsic dipole of the polarized monolayers points to the same direction. (d) The projected band structures at the PBE level of the heterostructures based on the polarized monolayers. The sizes of the green, pink, grey, wine, blue, orange and olive dots represent the weights of InS, In2STe, Ga2STe, In2SeTe, In2Te3, Ga2Te3 and In2Se3 monolayers, respectively. The Brillouin path is set as M (0, 1/2, 0) – K (1/3, 2/3, 0) – Γ (0, 0, 0) – M (0, 1/2, 0). The horizontal black line indicates the Fermi level, which is set to zero. 
The role of the intrinsic dipole in heterostructures
The direction of the internal electric field Ein determines the type of charge transfer mode (Z-scheme or type-II heterojunction) under light irradiation, which is depended on the charge transfer at the interface of the heterostructures. For conventional vdW heterostructures, the direction of charge transfer at the interface is determined by the work function of the two layers. However, due to the intrinsic dipole of polarized materials, the work functions for the top and bottom surfaces of the polarized layers are different, and thus the two monolayers expose different work functions at the interface when they form heterostructures with different stacking configurations. Therefore, different stacking orders may lead to an opposite charge transfer direction at the interface, resulting in distinct charge transfer mode (type-II or Z-scheme) under light irradiation. The work functions for those polarized monolayers and InS monolayer are listed in Table S4.† Taking In2STe/Ga2STe systems for example, for SIn2Te–SGa2Te, the charge density difference and average Hartree difference potential in Fig. 3(a) show that the electrons prefer to accumulate on the side of the Ga2STe layer, rather than that of the In2STe layer due to the larger work function (5.72 eV) for the S-surface of the Ga2STe layer than that (4.64 eV) for the Te-surface of In2STe. The ΔΦ for the SIn2Te–SGa2Te heterostructure is lower than the sum value of those for the individual Janus layers, meaning that there is an Ein opposite to EJanus pointing to the Ga2STe layer from the In2STe layer. However, for SGa2Te–SIn2Te, the In2STe layer would obtain electrons from the Ga2STe layer due to the large work function (6.02 eV) for the S-surface of the In2STe layer than that (4.96 eV) for the Te-surface of Ga2STe, resulting an opposite Ein pointing to the In2STe layer from the Ga2STe layer. For the In2STe/InS system, the electrons always transfer to the InS layer from the In2STe layer forming an interfacial electric field pointing to the InS monolayer with different atomic stacking configurations Fig. 3(c) and (d). This is because the InS monolayer has a relatively high work function (6.22 eV) which is larger than those of both the S-surface (6.02 eV) and Te-surface (4.64 eV) of the In2STe monolayer.

The positive and negative values of Δρ indicate electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. The red (green) colour corresponds to the charge accumulation (depletion). The green, pink and wine line represent the average Hartree difference average potentials of the individual Ga2STe, In2STe and InS monolayers, respectively. The orange line represents Hartree difference potentials for heterostructures. The black arrows indicate the difference between the sum value of ΔΦ for two individual stacking monolayers and ΔΦ for heterostructures, which presents the effect of the internal electric field Ein. The purple, blue and pink arrows indicate the direction of Ein and the intrinsic electric field EJanus of Janus Ga2STe and In2STe monolayers, respectively. 
According to the direction of charge transfer at the interface and interfacial electric field Ein, the Z-scheme systems are shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c). In the Z-scheme systems, the internal electric field would promote recombination between photogenerated carriers with a lower redox ability and hinder the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes with a strong redox ability, and thus the photogenerated carriers with a strong redox ability are preserved and spatially separated to participate into the HER and OER. In contrast, for conventional type-II heterojunctions, the opposite internal electric field leads to a different charge transfer mode under light irradiation due to the opposite direction of charge transfer at the interfaces as shown in Fig. S3.†

The black arrows represent the charge transfer and e–h recombination process. The Ein represents the built-in electric field at the interface of heterostructures. (d) The scheme of the ideal Z-scheme heterostructures based on the polarized layers for photocatalytic overall-water splitting. The green and blue dashed lines represent the redox potentials for the HER (H+/H2) and OER (O2/H2O), respectively. The orange arrows indicate the intrinsic diploe for polarized layers. 
Considering the shift of the potentials for H+/H2 and O2/H2O due to the intrinsic diploe of polarized materials, we found that for Z-scheme heterostructures the shift direction of potentials for H+/H2 and O2/H2O is important, which determines the increase or decrease of overpotentials for the HER and OER. As shown in Fig. 4(d), for Z-scheme heterostructures, to effectively improve the redox abilities for the HER and OER, the layer L1 with a higher CBM and VBM should possess a surface with a lower vacuum level while the layer L2 with a lower CBM and VBM should possess a surface with a higher vacuum level. As the interfacial electric field for Z-scheme heterostructures is pointed to the layer L2 with a lower CBM and VBM from the layer L1 with a higher CBM and VBM, only the direction of the polarized layer is the same as that of the interfacial electric field, and the overpotentials for the HER and OER can be increased, and conversely they will be reduced. Therefore, the heterostructures should fulfil the following requirements: Φsurf1 ≤ Φin1 < Φin2 ≤ Φsurf2, where Φsurf1 and Φsurf2 are the work functions of L1 and L2 at the two surfaces of the heterostructure, respectively, while Φin1 and Φin2 are the work functions of L1 and L2 at the interface of the heterostructure, respectively. Most importantly, the CBM (VBM) must be more positive (negative) than the reduction (oxidation) potential of H+/H2 (O2/H2O) to achieve water splitting on the heterostructure. However, for heterostructures containing two polarized layers, the exposed work functions at the interface always lead to an interfacial electric field opposite to the intrinsic dipole for individual polarized layers as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). For the InS–SIn2Te heterostructure, the large work function of the InS layer leads to an interfacial electric field with the same direction of the intrinsic dipole for the In2STe layer.
Based on the above discussions, only InS–SIn2Te formed a Z-scheme heterostructure with increased χ(H2) (0.64 eV) and χ(O2) (0.92 eV), containing only one polarized material layer, which is a promising candidate for overall water splitting Z-scheme photocatalysts. We further calculated the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) of InS–SIn2Te heterostructure which is a key factor in determining the catalytic properties of photocatalysts and the corresponding formulas details can be seen in the Methods. Assuming 100% efficiency of the catalytic reaction, a solar-to-hydrogen (ηSTH) of 12.71% and corrected  of 8.52% for the InS–SIn2Te heterostructure are obtained with the efficiencies of light absorption ηabs of 49.28% and carrier utilization (ηcu) of 25.81%.
Overall water splitting on the In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure
The low efficiency of InS–SIn2Te is originated from the large band gap of InS and In2STe layers, which determines the light absorption ηabs and energy of photons that can be used for water splitting E. Therefore, searching for an unpolarized semiconductor with a narrow band-gap and suitable work function to contact with the polarized layers is the key to further improve ηSTH. To date, 2D semiconductors with a narrow band gap in the range of 0.7–1.2 eV are rarely known. Recently, several 2D triphosphate monolayers have been discovered, such as InP3, BP3, CaP3, GeP3 and SnP3,32–36 and the reported band gaps range from 0.55 eV to 1.15 eV along with relatively high carrier mobility (over 103 cm2 V−1 s−1). The SnP3 monolayer is an unpolarized semiconductor with a narrow indirect gap (0.80 eV) as shown in Fig. 5(a). We constructed a heterostructure by stacking SnP3 and In2Se3 layers together, and the supercell contains a 1 × 1 unit cell of SnP3 and 1 × 3 rectangle unit cells of In2Se3. It is noted that the SnP3 monolayer with a work function of 4.68 eV comes into contact with the surface with a lower work function (5.02 eV) of In2Se3 as shown in Fig. 5(b), resulting in charge transfer from the SnP3 layer to the In2Se3 layer at the interface and thus making the internal electric field keep the same direction as the intrinsic dipole of the In2Se3 layer. The charge density difference Δρ in Fig. S4† demonstrated that there is an internal electric field pointing to the In2Se3 layer from the SnP3 layer.

The horizontal black line indicates the Fermi level, which is set to zero. (b) The side view of the In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure. The supercell contains a 1 × 1 unit cell of SnP3 and 1 × 3 rectangle unit cells of In2Se3. (c) The projected density of states of the In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure and the partial charge densities of the CBM and VBM for In2Se3 and SnP3 monolayers in the heterostructure, respectively. The yellow and blue dots represent the CBM and VBM, respectively. The isosurface is set to 0.0015 e Å−3. (d) The band alignment and schematic illustration of the photocatalytic direct Z-scheme mechanism of the In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure. 
The projected density of states (PDODS) in Fig. 5(c) shows that the In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure forms a type-II band alignment and the spatial distributions of the VBM and CBM for the In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure indicate efficient electron–hole separation. The spatially separated reductive and oxidative active sites are beneficial for decreasing the recombination probability of photogenerated carriers participating in redox reactions. The intrinsic electric field of the polarized layer can further help the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. According to the band alignment in Fig. 5(d), the internal electric field would promote the transfer of photogenerated carriers with lower redox ability at the interface and hinders the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes with strong redox ability. Also, the strong dipole induces a large shift of the band edges of individual layers, resulting in a tiny interlayer band gap of the heterostructure. For the intrinsic Z-scheme, the tiny band gap increases the probability of electron hopping between potential energy surfaces, which brings about fast e–h recombination with lower redox abilities at the interface. Therefore, photogenerated carriers with strong redox ability are preserved and spatially separated to participate in the HER and OER. All these processes can enhance the lifetime of photogenerated carriers participating in reactions, which can well increase the efficiency of carrier utilization and finally improve the STH efficiency of the system. The intrinsic dipole of In2Se3 with the same direction as the internal electric field layer leads to the shift of the reduction potential (H+/H2) and the water oxidation potential (O2/H2O), which increases redox abilities for the HER and OER. More importantly, as shown in Fig. 5(d), based on our design, under light irradiation the photogenerated electrons for the In2Se3 layer and holes for the SnP3 layer with lower redox abilities would accumulate at the interface of the heterostructure, which would recombine fast with each other due to the strong interfacial internal electric field. On the other hand, the photogenerated electrons for the SnP3 layer and holes for the In2Se3 layer with strong redox abilities are preserved and spatially separated on the two surface sides of the heterostructure participating in redox reactions to generate H2 and O2.
The fast migration of carriers is beneficial for the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Due to the van der Waals interaction between In2Se3 and SnP3 layers, the high carrier mobility can be retained in the In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure. The calculated result shows that the In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure exhibits both high hole and electron mobilities of 1.02 × 103 and 1.05 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which would contribute to fast carrier transfer. We then explore the energy conversion efficiency of the In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure for photocatalytic water splitting. The light absorption efficiency is strongly dependent on the band gap. The quite small band gaps (0.94 eV) enable the large efficiencies of light absorption ηabs (88.60%) and the efficiency of carrier utilization ηcu is 35.35% with large χ(H2) (0.58 eV) and χ(O2) (0.89 eV). Finally, a high STH efficiency of 31.32% is obtained and the corrected STH efficiency is 19.26%, which are higher than those predicted for other conventional Z-scheme photocatalysts by using the same theoretical strategy, such as MoSe2/SnSe2 (10.5%) and WSe2/SnSe2 (9.53%).14
Conclusions
We have proposed a direct Z-scheme photocatalyst by constructing an In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure based on polarized materials. Density functional theory calculations are performed to reveal the role of the intrinsic diploe for polarized layers in Z-scheme heterostructures. By investigating a series of heterostructures based on polarized materials, we found that the different stacking orders determine the different charge transfer modes (type-II or Z-scheme) for the different work functions at the two surfaces for polarized layers due to the intrinsic diploe. Moreover, the same direction of the intrinsic dipole as the internal electric field of heterostructures can enhance the redox abilities by increasing the overpotentials for the HER and OER. Based on this, we constructed an In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure, which is a direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for overall water splitting with strong redox abilities and effective separation of photogenerated carriers. As a consequence, we achieve a high STH efficiency of 19.26% in the In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure. Our theoretical computations offer not only a promising photocatalyst for high efficiency overall water splitting but also a general strategy for the design of Z-scheme photocatalysts by making the best use of the intrinsic dipole effects. Notably, the defects usually play a significant role in the photocatalyst. Previous studies have demonstrated that surface chalcogen vacancies can create more active sites and improve the intrinsic catalytic activity.37,38 Furthermore, S vacancy induced trap states in monolayer MoS2 will accelerate e–h recombination, which indicates that defects may effectively engineer the competitive relationship between charge separation and e–h recombination, and even switch the charge transfer path from type-II to Z-scheme.39,40 The effects of defects at the interfaces will be studied in our further work.
Methods and computational details
Structural optimization based on density-functional theory (DFT) was carried out with the plane-wave basis set Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code,41,42 along with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) for the exchange and correlation functional.43,44 The vdW correction model45 within the PBE functional was involved to describe the long-range interlayer interaction. A kinetic energy cutoff of 450 eV was used in the simulations. For geometry relaxation calculations, the Brillouin zone sampling used was 9 × 9 × 1 in the Monkhorst–Pack grid.46 Geometry optimization was continued until the maximal residual force per atom is less than 0.02 eV Å−1 and the energy difference is less than 10−5 eV. The vacuum thickness was set to 20 Å. Because the GGA-PBE exchange correlation functional tends to underestimate the band gap of semiconductors, the screened hybrid HSE06 functional,47 which was implemented in the Fritz Haber Institute ab initio molecular simulation (FHI-aims) code,48 was utilized to determine the electronic band structures of all the systems. The Hartree difference potential (ΔVH) is calculated as follows: ΔVH = Vtotal − ∑Vatom, where Vtotal and Vatom represent the Hartree potentials of the system and each atom. The dipole correction has been considered in all the calculations of work functions. We carried out Bader charge analysis49 to investigate the electron transfer at the interface of the heterostructures.
The optimized lattice constants of rectangle SnP3 are a = 7.38 Å and b = 12.78 Å, while the lattice constants of the rectangle In2Se3 unit cell are a = 7.12 Å and b = 4.11 Å. These results are consistent with reported values.36 The overall induced mismatch between the optimized SnP3 and In2Se3 monolayer lattice parameters is <3%.
The carrier mobility of the of In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure was calculated according to the following equation:50,51μ = 2eħ3C/(3kBTm*2D2), where e, ħ, kB, and T denote the electron charge, reduced Planck constant, Boltzmann constant, and room temperature, respectively. The effective mass is defined as m* = ±ħ2(d2Ek/dk2)−1 and the elastic modulus C is defined as (∂2E/∂ε2)/S0, where E represents the total energy and S0 stands for the area of the system. D is the deformation potential constant, which is defined as: D = dVedge/dε, where Vedge is the energy change of the band edges under the appropriate perturbation and ε stands the strength of perturbatively deformed lattices.
The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) is a key factor in determining the catalytic properties of photocatalysts, and is a product of the efficiency of light absorption ηabs and the efficiency of carrier utilization ηcu defined as: ηSTH = ηabs × ηcu,(1)
The efficiency of light absorption ηabs and the efficiency of carrier utilization ηcu for the direct Z-scheme mechanism systems can be evaluated by using the following expressions:14,21 (2) (3)where P(ħω) is the AM1.5G solar energy flux at the photon energy ħω and Eg is the band gap of the layer with a larger band gap in heterostructures.14 The integral from 0 to ∞ in the denominator represents the total power density of incident simulative sunlight (AM1.5G), while the integral from Eg to ∞ in the numerator represents the power density that can be absorbed by materials. ΔG is the free energy difference of 1.23 eV for water splitting, and E is the energy of photons that can be used for water splitting. The integral from E to ∞ in the numerator is the effective photocurrent density. The factor 0.5 means that only half of the photogenerated carriers are available for the following catalytic processes.
Determining the extra energy needed to overcome the barriers of the HER and OER is important for calculating STH efficiency. Considering the energy loss during carrier migration between different materials, the required overpotentials for the HER and OER are assumed to be 0.2 and 0.6 eV, respectively.21,52,53 Then, E is determined as (4)
For polarized monolayers, the intrinsic electric field would do positive work for the electron–hole separation during the process of photocatalytic water splitting. Then the corrected STH efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting for polarized materials with a vertical intrinsic electric field is calculated as:21 (5)where ΔΦ is the vacuum level difference between the two respective surfaces of these 2D polarized materials, and the second term in the denominator represents the work done by the vertical intrinsic electric field.
