    , Accepted 3rd May 2019First published on 6th May 2019AbstractPhotonic microstructures placed at the topside of photovoltaic cells are currently one of the preferred light management solutions to obtain efficiency enhancement due to the increment of the optical absorption produced in the active medium of the devices. Herein, we present the results concerning a practical, low-cost and scalable approach to integrate metal-oxide based light trapping microstructures on the front contact of amorphous silicon thin film solar cells. A colloidal lithography method was used to pattern the wavelength-sized pyramidal-like features composing the structures, made of two different transparent materials, TiO2 and IZO, allowing the detailed study of the influence of their geometrical parameters on the optoelectronic properties of the devices. These top coating structures are deposited as a post-process after the solar cell fabrication, thus facilitating and broadening their industrial applicability. Measurements of the light absorption, external quantum efficiency and I–V curves revealed that the structured coatings provide strong broadband improvements in the generated current, due to the suppression of reflected light at short wavelengths and the increment of the optical path length of the longer wavelengths (via light scattering), within the amorphous silicon layer. As a result, in the four types of structures analyzed in this study, remarkable increments were achieved in the cells’ efficiencies (up to 14.4%) and generated currents (up to 21.5%), with respect to the flat reference cells.
1 Introduction
Solar energy is considered the most convenient renewable green source for the self-consumption and self-generation of energy, avoiding the large infrastructures required for production and distribution of electricity due to the possibility of constructing small and easy-to-handle photovoltaic (PV) devices that transform light power into electricity. The market dominant solar cell (SC) technology is still the first-generation wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si) SCs that can achieve efficiencies up to 26%.1 Nevertheless, they present several drawbacks such as the lack of mechanical flexibility, high weight and production costs. To overcome these inconveniences, a new generation of thin film silicon solar cells (TFSCs) is being strongly proposed to lead the new market of domestic/portable energy exploitation. They are still less efficient (up to ∼15%) but are much thinner, allowing them to be flexible, lightweight, with lower manufacturing costs, and more suitable for scalable fabrication over large areas. For these reasons, numerous efforts in the field of PV are directed to develop different strategies targeting higher efficiencies while keeping or further decreasing the already low thickness of the active layers of TFSCs.
Among all the proposed solutions, one of the most investigated is the inclusion of photonic nano/microstructures for light trapping (LT) in the SC, integrated in the rear or front contacts.2–6 One approach makes use of the intense light scattered from metal nanoparticles (NPs) sustaining surface plasmons.7–9 The resonant scattering resulting from arrays of noble metal NPs with monodisperse physical properties can lead to particularly pronounced optical path length amplification of the weakly-absorbed near-infrared (NIR) light within the cell active layer. The NPs array should be preferentially located at the cell rear, between the back contact and the PV layer, in a configuration known as a plasmonic back-reflector (PBR) structure.10 In this way, the NPs can boost the NIR photocurrent without parasitically absorbing the UV and visible light.7 The conventional technique employed to fabricate such NP structures is via ultra-thin film annealing, where a metallic precursor layer transforms into a drop-like NP array by a solid-state dewetting mechanism. Nevertheless, the high temperatures (400–500 °C) required for the annealing treatment make this technique incompatible with the most common flexible substrates (as paper-based or PEN/PET) used in TF PV, since such flexible polymeric materials can only withstand temperatures up to ∼150–200 °C without degradation.11,12 Besides, another crucial drawback is that metallic NPs can present significant parasitic light absorption, even in the NIR, which hinders their optical benefits.7,13
Wave-optical dielectric structures with dimensions comparable to those of the illuminating wavelengths, applied in the cell's front, are considered preferential LT approaches relative to PBRs.14–17 The simplest application of this type of structures is the use of arrays of dielectric colloids wet-coated from solution on the front TCO (transparent conductive oxide) contact of TFSCs.18 This was tested, for instance, with silica (SiO2) micro-spheres deposited on quantum dot15 and a-Si19 SCs. Nevertheless, high refractive index particles/features are often preferable for front-located LT structures,3,4,20,21 since they can provide the best light incoupling (i.e. suppression of reflection) towards the absorber medium when their refractive index is comparable to that of such medium (e.g. Si with n ∼ 4). Besides, their light scattering intensity is also increased with a higher real part of the refractive index of the photonic elements, thus leading to higher optical path length enhancement of the poorly-absorbed near-infrared (NIR) photons within the PV absorber; while the imaginary part should be the lowest possible to prevent parasitic absorption.17 In recent works,2,22 the authors demonstrated that almost 50% current enhancement is possible in TF Si cells using arrays of TiO2 (n = 2.5–2.7) half-prolate particles patterned on the cells’ front. This preferential LT design has been calculated using multi-parameter optimizations, employing an FDTD numerical model to determine the best set of geometrical parameters of high-index dielectric front structures that enables maximum photocurrent gain in TF Si cells of distinct thickness. Such gain results from the combined anti-reflection (mainly effective in the UV-Vis range) and light scattering (effective in the NIR) effects of the front LT structures, which lead to a strong broadband absorption enhancement in the Si material.
With the aim of reproducing this geometry experimentally, we developed a low-cost soft-lithography method, known as colloidal-lithography (CL), to fabricate TiO2-based pyramidal-shaped microstructures (MS).20 The method allows forming nano/micron-scale structures of virtually any material, and is compatible with the PV industry scalability requirements. Therefore, it is highly attractive for SC applications as it enables the precise engineering of wavelength-sized features, with the materials and geometries appropriate for efficient light trapping. It was demonstrated that, when directly deposited on amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin film absorbers, such TiO2 LT microstructures provided pronounced broadband absorption enhancement (27.3% on spectral average) in the Si medium relative to unpatterned ref. 20.
The present work shows, for the first time, the results concerning the integration of this class of LT structures in full PV devices, by lithographing them at the top surface of a-Si:H TFSCs. Besides, since the CL fabrication methodology allows the patterning of any material, here we compare the optical and photovoltaic properties of SCs incorporating MSs made of either TiO2 or the same medium as the front TCO (i.e. indium zinc oxide, IZO). Common TCOs (e.g. ZnO or SnO2 based) present a lower real part of the refractive index (1.8–2.0, as compared to 2.5–2.7 of TiO2) and a much higher imaginary part (3–4 orders of magnitude higher than that of TiO2 in NIR). Therefore, TCO-based MSs are not expected to produce as strong broadband absorption enhancement as TiO2, but they can bring important improvements regarding the electrical properties of the photonic-enhanced devices.
For all the devices produced for this study, a significant enhancement of the optical absorption was consistently obtained along most of the spectral range of interest. As a result, the I–V measurements show a systematic increment (within 17.6–21.5%) of the current produced by the TFSCs containing the microstructured coatings, with respect to that of planar reference SCs coated with only a flat anti-reflection layer. The remarkable enhancements reported here are therefore among the top results published up to now concerning wave-optical dielectric front structures as light management solutions in PV devices.4
2 Results and discussion
In this section we discuss the improvements in the PV response achieved due to the integration of metal oxide light trapping (LT) microstructured coatings in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin film solar cells (TFSCs). The use of amorphous Si PV technology was selected with the purpose of constructing SCs with a thickness of few hundreds of nanometers that allow mechanically flexible devices for applications that can benefit from their bendability. In addition, TF a-Si SCs are commonly used as test devices for the evaluation of LT solutions23–25 thus constituting a preferential PV technology for comparing the performances of different optical strategies. However, it is important to mention that front-located LT structures, as those presented in this work, are expected to provide even higher current enhancement if applied in TF SCs made of crystalline (or polycrystalline) silicon layers with thicknesses on the order of the micrometer, mainly due to the indirect bandgap of c-Si which makes it absorb more poorly than a-Si that has direct bandgap.2,22
The four types of LT microstructures (MS) implemented here are indicated in Table 1, composed of different materials (TiO2 and IZO) and patterned with different initial diameters (1.3 or 1.6 μm) of the PS colloids, which define the pitch of the resulting hexagonal arrays. Fig. S1 in ESI† presents the elemental characterization of the materials forming the photonic front contacts, performed via EDX analysis of TiO2 and IZO films deposited with the same conditions on glass.

The microstructures analyzed here (T1.3, T1.6, I1.3 and I1.6) were deposited following a colloidal lithography (CL) technique described in the Experimental section, at the end of the paper, and sketched in Fig. 6.20 It consisted in depositing a monolayer of close-packed colloidal polystyrene (PS) microspheres, of 1.3 μm (T1.3 and I1.3) and 1.6 μm (T1.6 and I1.6) diameter, by Langmuir Blodgett26 directly on the SCs surface (Fig. 6a). Then, the colloids were reduced and shaped by applying an O2 reactive ion etching (RIE) process, thus resulting in a non-closed-packed hexagonal array of spheroids that was used as mask (Fig. 6b). The voids between spheroids were infiltrated with TiO2 (T1.3 and T1.6) or IZO (I1.3 and I1.6) deposited by sputtering (Fig. 6c). The last step consisted in lifting off the PS colloids by combining a CF4 RIE with a toluene sonication bath, thereby leaving only the micro-structured TiO2 or IZO material on the cells’ top surface (Fig. 1 and 6d).
 Fig. 1  SEM images of the cross section of an a-Si thin film solar cell with a TiO2 based LT microstructures (I1.6) integrated on the top, deposited over the flat IZO front contact. The right panel shows a magnification of a smaller area in which the different layers composing the device are indicated with dashed horizontal lines and the microstructured top coating is colored in green. The thickness22 of the SC layers have been previously optimized for this type of devices.25,27,28 The height of the pyramidal feature of the patterned photonic structure is indicated with an arrow. Pyramids with average heights of 600 and 740 nm were achieved using PS spheres of diameters of 1.3 and 1.6 μm, respectively. Further details regarding the developed colloidal lithography micro-fabrication method are given in the Experimental section (Fig. 6). 
With this patterning technique the obtained structures were similar for TiO2 and IZO materials, which facilitates the analysis of the differences in their optical performance described latter. The SEM cross section of one of the structures (I1.6) is shown in Fig. 1 for illustration. The dimensions and the periodicity of the LT MSs are determined by the different steps of the CL procedure, as detailed in a previous contribution.20 In particular, the diameter of the colloidal PS spheres sets not only the separation between the scattering centers (i.e. the pyramidal-like features) but also determines their geometrical dimensions, which will have a strong influence on the amount of incident radiation flowing and getting trapping in the a-Si layer. Pyramids with average heights of about 600 and 740 nm and bases of about 550 and 700 nm were achieved using colloidal PS spheres of 1.3 and 1.6 μm diameters, respectively. These dimensions are close to those indicated in the aforementioned theoretical contributions involving extensive optimization studies performed by the authors.2,22
Several aspects were taken in consideration for choosing TiO2 and IZO as constituent materials of the LT microstructures. On one hand, the fact that they are deposited as a post-process on the top illuminated face of the SCs makes it indispensable to be optically lossless (transparent); on the other hand, their high value of refractive index, n ∼ 2.5–2.7 for TiO2 and n ∼ 2 for IZO, can ensure a better light incoupling towards the a-Si by suppression of the reflected light and by redirecting (scattering) the incident light waves towards more horizontal directions along the absorber layer. To evaluate these effects, for the two different materials and array pitches used to make the LT MSs (see Table 1), spectroscopic measurements (see Section 4.3) were performed to determine the optical absorption (shown in Fig. 2) of the SCs with and without (reference) the front photonic structures. The SC used as reference has layer structure similar to that of Fig. 1 but without the top patterned MS, terminating in the flat IZO contact.
 Fig. 2  Total absorptance (top row) and external quantum efficiency, QE (bottom row), measured for the SCs incorporating the photonic top coatings made with different materials, TiO2 (a and b) or IZO (c and d), and array pitches, 1.3 μm (a and c) and 1.6 μm (b and d). These spectra are compared with those (black curves) of a reference flat SC with no LT structures patterned on top. Based in previous studies,2,20,22 the total absorptance is mainly given by the light absorbed in the a-Si layers only for wavelengths between about 400 and 750 nm. Outside this wavelength range there is a significant portion of parasitic absorption, i.e. light absorbed in the other materials of the cells. In the UV, below 400 nm wavelength, such parasitic absorption is given by absorption only in the front LT + IZO layers, while above 750 nm it occurs both in the rear AZO + Al contact as well as in the front IZO. 
The absorption curves of Fig. 2 reveal that the four types of LT structures lead to a remarkable broadband enhancement of the light absorbed by the devices along most of the wavelength range of study (350–1100 nm). Such enhancement is more pronounced for longer red-NIR wavelengths, between 600 and 1100 nm, and lower for shorter wavelengths in the visible range (Vis), between 350 and 600 nm. In order to quantitatively study this behavior, we separated each curve in these two ranges of interest, integrated them and calculated the corresponding average values of the absorption enhancement relative to the reference cell. The results are given in the bar diagram of Fig. 3. The inset panel in this figure represents the average enhancement of the total absorption within the spectral region (350–750 nm wavelengths) where such absorption mainly takes place in the Si material of the cells and, therefore, contributes to the photocurrent, as shown by the measurements of the quantum efficiency plotted in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 3  Measured average enhancement of the optical absorption, relative to the flat reference SC, obtained from the top curves of Fig. 2, considering three wavelength ranges of interest: 350–600 nm (UV/Vis), 600–1100 nm (red/NIR) and the total investigated range, 350–1100 nm. The upper-right panel represents the average enhancement along the full UV + visible range, 350–750 nm, corresponding to the photocurrent response range of the cells shown by the QE spectra in the bottom of Fig. 2. 
There are two main optical effects produced by the LT structures that, simultaneously, give rise to the absorption enhancement occurring in the cells: (1) anti-reflection, consisting in the minimization of the light reflected off the SC caused by the geometric refractive index matching at its surface provided by the pyramidal-shaped features, which is specially relevant to improve the absorption of Vis radiation; (2) path length enhancement, forward scattering the vertically-incident radiation into oblique directions that can travel longer distances within the absorber film and be coupled to waveguided modes of the cell structure, which improves the absorption of only the longer wavelengths (in red/NIR) having penetration depths in a-Si higher than the thickness of the a-Si layer. Due to this effect, for wavelengths above 550 nm there is a general increase in the QE (bottom of Fig. 2) of the cells with the LT structures, with respect to the reference cell, and a smoothening of the light interference peaks observed at such longer wavelengths of the QE spectra.
From the optical results of Fig. 2 and 3, it is notorious that our MSs provide strong scattering but poor anti-reflection effects. The main reason for that is attributed not to the photonic structures themselves, but to the presence of the 230 nm IZO front contact layer between them and the a-Si (see Fig. 1), which mainly hinders the anti-reflection action since it prevents the establishment of a gradual increasing effective index (specially with the TiO2 MS) for the light travelling from air towards the high index a-Si material. The presence of such flat IZO layer is required for electrical reasons, to allow a good performing (low electrical resistance) p-contact, but it is the main optical disadvantage of the structures investigated in this work. In spite of that, pronounced absorption enhancements are attained mainly due to the scattering performance of the photonic structures. For that, TiO2 based MS are advantageous over the IZO ones due to the higher real part of the refractive index of TiO2 and lower imaginary part (i.e. lower parasitic absorption along the spectral range of interest). Among the different array pitches, the microstructures fabricated with 1.3 μm PS spheres behave better as light trappers than those made using spheres of 1.6 μm, since the lower is the pitch the higher is the surface density of scattering elements. According to previous theoretical studies,2,22 the optimum array geometry for this type of devices should have a pitch close to the micrometer. For the above reasons, the microstructured coating that performed optically better is that (T1.3) made with TiO2 and fabricated using 1.3 μm PS colloids.
An electromagnetic FDTD simulation program (see Section 4.3), described by the authors in previous related contributions,2,20,22 was employed here to model the electric field distribution in the solar cell structures studied in this work, considering the average layers thicknesses and geometrical dimensions of the photonic features measured from SEM analysis. This allows the determination of the optical absorption occurring in the a-Si layer and the consequent photocurrent density, JPH, produced by the cell, assuming that each photon absorbed in a-Si yields one electron and one hole collected by the contacts, and that the absorption occurring in the other layers does not contribute to carrier generation. The solar generation rate, G, profiles and the JPH values computed in this way are given in Fig. 4, for the planar reference cell (Fig. 4a) and the cells with the four types of LT structures (Fig. 4b–e).
 Fig. 4  FDTD computed log-scale distributions of the solar generation rate (G), within 400–1100 nm incident wavelength range, along cross-sectional xz planes of the solar cells analyzed in this work: i.e. the planar reference (a) and the cells coated with the four different structures T1.3 (b), T1.6 (c), I1.3 (d) and I1.6 (e). The origin of the z axis is at the top surface of the a-Si:H layer. The corresponding computed values of photocurrent density (JPH) are indicated in the a-Si layer. 
The optical G profiles of Fig. 4 show that the TiO2 MSs present much lower parasitic absorption within the TiO2 material than the IZO MSs, due to the lower extinction coefficient of TiO2. On the other hand, the IZO top coatings yield superior anti-reflection action, evidenced by the red regions of higher G intensity localized below the pyramidal features, due to their better light incoupling with the front IZO contact layer. Nevertheless, the lower parasitic absorption and stronger scattering of the light waves produced by the TiO2 features yields an overall higher distribution of the light absorption when considering the full volume of the a-Si layer, which translates into higher photocurrent relative to the IZO coatings. The distribution of G is also shown to be more intense for the 1.3 μm pitch relative to the 1.6 μm cases, due to the higher coverage of hot-spots along the Si medium produced by the photonic features.
The aforementioned light absorption aspects have a direct influence in the external quantum efficiency (QE) spectra of the SCs presented in the bottom plots of Fig. 2. The limited anti-reflection action of the LT structures prevents it from increasing the current for wavelengths below ∼500 nm, so the improvements are present at longer wavelengths up to the lowest photon energy (750–800 nm wavelengths) that can generate current in the a-Si:H cells.
The corresponding I–V characteristics of the solar cells studied in this work are plotted in Fig. 5a. The main parameters of these curves are given in Table 2, and the measured enhancements obtained relative to the reference planar device are shown in Fig. 5b. Here, the photocurrent gains are compared with the theoretical ones determined from the FDTD results of Fig. 4. The SCs integrating the different LT MSs produce currents consistently higher than the non-structured reference SCs, as expected. In every case, the modeled JPH values are higher but follow the same trends (relative gains) as the measured ones. This reveals the geometrical and optical quality of the fabricated structures and corroborates that the improvements attained with the photonic top coatings are due to the previously-described optical effects.

The increments of the current density generated by the SCs have values comprised between 17.6% and 21.5%, while the efficiency enhancements reach 14.4%, which are notable values taking in consideration the current state of art of photonic-enhanced a-Si SC technology.22,25
As discussed before, structures made of TiO2 and 1.3 μm pitch yield better light trapping performance than those of IZO or 1.6 μm pitch. Therefore, as seen in Fig. 5b, the T1.3 structure is that which provided the highest current gain, while the I1.6 structure provided the lowest one.
Nevertheless, since the photonic structures are integrated in the front contact, their electrical conductivity also plays an important role in the devices performance. For that, the use of a TCO material for the MS, such as IZO, is obviously better since it reinforces the front electrode (i.e. lowers the series resistance), which is not the case for TiO2 due to its low conductivity. Therefore, despite the lower optical performance (weaker scattering and stronger parasitic absorption) of the IZO MSs, their electrical benefits hinder the decrease of the fill factor, caused by the defects induced by the patterned structures, relative to the unpatterned reference cells (see Table 2). This explains why the higher efficiency enhancements were actually attained with the IZO structures (I1.3 and I1.6) and not with the TiO2-based ones. Finally, the I1.6 structure performs better electrically than the I1.3, as shown by the lower discrepancy between the current density and efficiency enhancement values attained with I1.6. This can be explained by the lower surface density of patterned pyramidal features for higher array pitch, hence less density of structural defects which will directly affect the electrical quality (mainly the fill factor – see Table 2) of the cells.
3 Conclusions
Here, an innovative design of front-located light trapping MSs was investigated to improve the light harvesting performance of thin film solar cells. A colloidal lithography method was developed to engineer different periodically-arranged MSs consisting in micropyramidal shaped features patterned directly on the top TCO electrode of a-Si:H solar cells. The strategy presented in this work highly facilitates and broadens the industrial applicability of the presented LT structures, since it has been shown that they can be simply deposited as top coatings with a post-process after the solar cell fabrication.
The versatility of our experimental procedure allows fabricating structures of several materials and sizes. Thus, in this work, two coating materials with different optical and electrical properties were tested: TiO2 and IZO; as well as two different array pitches (1.3 μm and 1.6 μm). Spectroscopic measurements revealed a substantial enhancement of the optical absorption produced in the solar cells when incorporating any of the four microstructures, with respect to planar reference SCs. The SCs integrating TiO2 MS made using spheres of 1.3 μm of diameter presents the higher optical enhancement (36% of spectrally-averaged absorptance). The values of the enhancements of the measured current (between 17.6% and 21.5%) in each case were consistent with those corresponding to the enhancements of the optical absorption. Nevertheless, the best efficiency enhancement (14.4%) was attained with the SC integrating the IZO based MS with 1.6 μm pitch.
In view of future work, a way to combine the advantageous properties of both LT materials studied in this work, TiO2 and IZO, could be via the development of optically-improved transparent conductive oxide (TCO) materials. Namely, TCOs with not only good conductivity (as ZnO or SnO based ones) but also with a high real part (n) and a low imaginary part (k) of the refractive index (as TiO2).

Deposition of a-Si:H layers. 
The samples were then transferred to an Electtrorava plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system where the silicon layers were deposited according to the n–i–p structure. A mixture of SiH4 and H2 defines the hydrogen dilution parameter (DH (%) = [H2/(H2 + SiH4)] × 100). In the case of the intrinsic silicon thin film a DH = 95% was used with a deposition pressure (Pgas) of 1 Torr and a power density (PW) equal to 69.44 mW cm−2. The i-layer thickness deposited was ∼230 nm. Adding trimethylboron (TMB, B(CH3)3) or PH3 to the mixture of SiH4 and H2 produced p- or n-layers, respectively. A p-a-Si:H layer of 12 nm was deposited with a DH = 74.98%, RTMB = TMB/(TMB + SiH4) = 1.3%, a Pgas = 1.05 Torr and a PW = 48.65 mW cm−2. As for the n-a-Si:H layer, the parameters were: DH = 95.05%, RPH3 = PH3/(PH3 + SiH4) = 1.3%, Pgas = 1 Torr, PW = 55.56 mW cm−2 and the corresponding thickness obtained was 30 nm.


Deposition of front contact and SC area delimitation. 
Transparent conductive oxide layers, made of 230 nm thick IZO, were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering for 80 min over the a-Si layers, with the conditions listed in Table 3.
To delimit SCs of 3 mm of diameter, the deposition of the IZO front electrode was carried out using a circular metallic mask of that diameter. Afterwards, SF6 plasma etching treatment was applied to remove the layer of a-Si of the surrounding area, revealing the AZO–Al back contact. SF6 was chosen because it does not affect the IZO in the dry etching process. Finally, to assist in the external connection to the front TCO contact, two Al pads were deposited at both sides of each SC using another mask.

4.2 Colloidal lithography patterning of photonic coatings

Assembly of the colloidal monolayer (see Fig. 6a). 
Colloidal suspensions of polystyrene (PS) spheres were used, purchased from Microparticles GmbH, with a diameter of 1.3 and 1.6 μm dispersed in a mixture of water and ethanol (1:3) solutions at a concentration of 2.5 wt%. A monolayer of such microspheres was directly deposited on the top IZO surface of the SCs following a Langmuir–Blodgett (LB)26 wet-coating methodology. This process started by depositing 400 μl of the colloidal suspension in the interface between water and air, using a syringe. The barriers of the LB system were then closed at a controlled speed of 10 mm min−1, driving the floating spheres to self-assemble at such interface in an ordered close-packed hexagonal array. Afterwards, the obtained monolayer was transferred to the surface of the prepared samples by dip coating, with a withdrawal speed of 2 mm min−1.


Shaping of colloidal array (see Fig. 6b). 
The geometry of the colloids, with 1.3 and 1.6 μm initial diameter, was tuned by exposing the deposited monolayer to O2 reactive ion etching (RIE) during 120 and 150 seconds, respectively, employing the conditions in Table 4.

TiO2/IZO infiltration (see Fig. 6c). 
The TiO2 or IZO material of the optical front structures was deposited by RF sputtering during 6 and 4.5 hours, respectively, employing the conditions given in Table 3.


Lift off of colloids (see Fig. 6d). 
The last step of the MS fabrication procedure consisted in removing the etched PS spheroids by sonicating the samples in a toluene bath. This solvent allows a fast lift-off of the PS particles with a quite low sonication time (1 min), therefore not causing any damage to the underlying layers of the SCs. Previously, an Ar/CF4 RIE process (see Table 3, row 2) was applied to remove the top capping layer of TiO2/IZO over the colloids and facilitate the subsequent dissolution of their PS material in the toluene bath.

4.3 Characterization

Scanning electron microscopy. 
The morphological characterization of the geometrical dimensions of the different components of all fabricated samples was performed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements using a CARL ZEISS AURIGA Cross Beam work station.


Spectrophotometry. 
The optical measurements were performed with a UV-VIS-NIR scanning spectrophotometer (PERKIN ELMER lambda 950), using a 15 cm diameter integrating sphere to obtain the total reflectance (RT) spectra of the solar cells. Total absorptance spectra were estimated by using the general formula: AT (%) = 100 − RT (%).


Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. 
The elemental analysis of the TiO2 and IZO materials deposited by sputtering was performed via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX – see ESI†) using a QUANTAX 70 energy dispersive microanalysis system installed in a TM3030 Plus SEM.


Photovoltaic response. 
The measurements of the I–V curves of the fabricated solar cells were performed with a LED Sun Simulator (Oriel Vera Sol LSH-7520) composed of multiple LEDs at 19 individual wavelengths spaced over the spectrum from 400 to 1100 nm, supplying a 1 sun illumination certified AAA in a 51 × 51 mm area. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed using a Newport QuantX-300 system, equipped with a xenon lamp of 100 W, at wavelength intervals of 10 nm with a nominal illumination spot size of 0.8 × 1.1 mm.


Electromagnetic FDTD simulations. 
A numerical 3D mesh-based FDTD (finite difference time domain) method was employed to model the optical response of the fabricated structures,2,22 using a specialized commercial solver.29 The mesh resolution was adapted to the geometry of the structures after sets of convergence tests, in order to minimize the computational requirements while maintaining high accuracy. The simulations were corroborated by matching the optical results (absorptance spectra) of flat multilayered solar cells with analytical formalisms based on the Transfer Matrix method. The samples with the TiO2/IZO MSs were simulated by considering a hexagonal array of vertically-aligned semi-spheroidal features made of TiO2/IZO material, yielding structures with the periodicity and average dimensions measured by SEM analysis.20

 	Fig. 1  SEM images of the cross section of an a-Si thin film solar cell with a TiO2 based LT microstructures (I1.6) integrated on the top, deposited over the flat IZO front contact. The right panel shows a magnification of a smaller area in which the different layers composing the device are indicated with dashed horizontal lines and the microstructured top coating is colored in green. The thickness22 of the SC layers have been previously optimized for this type of devices.25,27,28 The height of the pyramidal feature of the patterned photonic structure is indicated with an arrow. Pyramids with average heights of 600 and 740 nm were achieved using PS spheres of diameters of 1.3 and 1.6 μm, respectively. Further details regarding the developed colloidal lithography micro-fabrication method are given in the Experimental section (Fig. 6).	 

 	Fig. 2  Total absorptance (top row) and external quantum efficiency, QE (bottom row), measured for the SCs incorporating the photonic top coatings made with different materials, TiO2 (a and b) or IZO (c and d), and array pitches, 1.3 μm (a and c) and 1.6 μm (b and d). These spectra are compared with those (black curves) of a reference flat SC with no LT structures patterned on top. Based in previous studies,2,20,22 the total absorptance is mainly given by the light absorbed in the a-Si layers only for wavelengths between about 400 and 750 nm. Outside this wavelength range there is a significant portion of parasitic absorption, i.e. light absorbed in the other materials of the cells. In the UV, below 400 nm wavelength, such parasitic absorption is given by absorption only in the front LT + IZO layers, while above 750 nm it occurs both in the rear AZO + Al contact as well as in the front IZO.	 

 	Fig. 3  Measured average enhancement of the optical absorption, relative to the flat reference SC, obtained from the top curves of Fig. 2, considering three wavelength ranges of interest: 350–600 nm (UV/Vis), 600–1100 nm (red/NIR) and the total investigated range, 350–1100 nm. The upper-right panel represents the average enhancement along the full UV + visible range, 350–750 nm, corresponding to the photocurrent response range of the cells shown by the QE spectra in the bottom of Fig. 2.	 

 	Fig. 4  FDTD computed log-scale distributions of the solar generation rate (G), within 400–1100 nm incident wavelength range, along cross-sectional xz planes of the solar cells analyzed in this work: i.e. the planar reference (a) and the cells coated with the four different structures T1.3 (b), T1.6 (c), I1.3 (d) and I1.6 (e). The origin of the z axis is at the top surface of the a-Si:H layer. The corresponding computed values of photocurrent density (JPH) are indicated in the a-Si layer.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) I–V curves of the solar cells incorporating the four different microstructured top coatings of Table 1, and of the reference flat cell without LT. (b) Measured and theoretically modeled enhancement, relative to the reference, of the generated current density (dark grey and empty bars, respectively), and of the measured conversion efficiency (light grey bars) of the devices in (a).	 

 	Fig. 6  Steps of the colloidal lithography methodology20 used to deposit LT MSs on a-Si SCs: colloidal microspheres deposition in a close-packed honeycomb array (a), O2 dry etching to shape the colloidal mask (b), infiltration of metal oxide deposited by sputtering (c) and spheres removal by chemical lift off (d). The sketch in (d) indicates the materials composing the solar cell layer structure, and the negative and positive contacts of the device which has an n–i–p configuration in the deposited a-Si layers. Tilted SEM image of the final fabricated device coated with the top LT structure (highlighted in green) that uniformly covers the entire illuminated area of the solar cell (e).
