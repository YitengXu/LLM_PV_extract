    , Accepted 25th January 2018First published on 25th January 2018AbstractAluminum (Al) plasmonic nanostructures have attracted increasing interest for plasmonic applications due to their advantages of supporting tunable surface plasmon resonances over a wide spectral range, from ultraviolet to near infrared spectral regions, as well as their earth-abundance and thus low cost when compared to the noble metals. Nevertheless, developing a reliable fabrication method that enables the formation of Al nanostructures with designed dispersity, controllable size and large-scale production is still challenging. In this work, we report a novel self-assembly nanoparticle template method to achieve well-dispersed and size-tunable Al nanodisk arrays on a titanium dioxide (TiO2) substrate. The Al nanodisk arrays were successfully employed to enhance the performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for the first time. Compared to the reference devices, the average power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices utilizing Al nanodisk arrays are remarkably enhanced from 3.30% to 4.08% for a poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) blend and from 7.28% to 8.04% for a poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]]:phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM) blend. The champion devices show PCEs of 4.32% and 8.48% for P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC71BM active layers, respectively. According to the optical and electrical characterization of both the reference and Al nanodisk array-enhanced devices, the improvement in device performance was attributed to the enhancement in the light absorption of the active layer and the better energy level alignment caused by the Al nanodisk arrays. This study clearly demonstrates the promise of an Al nanoparticle array as a plasmonic nanostructure for photovoltaic performance enhancement in OPVs, and it could be easily extended to other types of photovoltaic devices and many mainstream plasmon-enabled or enhanced applications.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with bulk heterojunction active layers have attracted extensive attention in recent years as a potential alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells, mainly due to their inherent advantages, such as their large area and solution-based manufacturing compatibility, mechanical flexibility, light weight, rapid energy payback time (EPBT) and low cost.1–6 Recently, the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of polymer-based and/or small molecule-based OPVs have been rapidly enhanced. However, to pave the way for the viable and practical application of OPVs, further enhancements in PCEs are still urgently required for single-junction devices. One of the prominent hindrances for OPVs towards achieving higher efficiency is the very thin photoactive layers, which lead to insufficient light absorption and thus low external quantum efficiency (EQE). For most high performance OPVs, the optimum active layer thickness is typically only ∼100–200 nm due to the short exciton diffusion length and low carrier mobility in organic semiconductors.7–9 From this viewpoint, several light manipulation approaches, including using tandem device structures,5,10,11 photonic crystals,12 surface textures,13,14 and plasmonic metal nanostructures,7,15–18 have been proposed to enhance the light absorption of OPVs without the need to increase the thickness of the active layer. In particular, the utilization of plasmonic metal nanostructures has been identified as a promising strategy for enhancing the efficiency of OPVs due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects and the scattering effects, which induce light absorption enhancement, and the electrical contribution of the metal nanostructures.19–24
Recently, aluminum (Al) has attracted increasing interest in both fundamental studies and applications due to its advantages of supporting tunable and strong surface plasmon resonances over a wide spectral range, from ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR), as well as its earth abundance and thus low cost.25–27 Therefore, Al plasmonic systems represent a highly interesting, cheap alternative to noble metals for many potential plasmon-enhanced solar energy harvesting applications, such as solar cells and photocatalysts, for practical mainstream applications and commercial viability. A theoretical study suggested that Al nanoparticles (NPs) have the potential to achieve significantly greater enhancement of light absorption and thus efficiency of the OPV active layer than the typical noble plasmonic metals (i.e., Au and Ag), due to their much higher plasma frequency, which enables a better overlap between the plasmon resonance and absorption bands of organic active layers.28 Moreover, it is noted that Al NPs are easily oxidised after their exposure to air and the process is self-limiting, with the formed passivating oxide layer of Al2O3 inhibiting further oxidation.26,29–31 This native oxide layer imparts stability, which is an important property that favors their use for various plasmon-enhanced or enabled applications.31 In particular, the thin oxide surface layer can also act as an insulating shell to avoid direct contact between Al and the active layer, and thus eliminate the concern of exciton quenching in OPVs.
By directly blending wet chemical-synthesized Al NPs into the active layer32,33 or buffer layer,34 the performance of OPV devices can be enhanced. However, metal NPs tend to aggregate in the active layer blend solution or in the subsequent spin-coating process, which impacts largely on their LSPR effects and thus decreases the enhancement in light absorption of the active layer as well as the device performance.34,35 The aggregated plasmonic NPs in the active layer would also harm the morphological evolution of the BHJ active layer. Moreover, the chemically synthesized NPs face a poor stability problem, and the presence of surfactants and ligand coatings induces undesirable exciton quenching at the interface of the NPs and the organic active layer.36 From this viewpoint, the exploitation of Al nanostructures for the plasmonic-enhanced performance of OPVs still faces challenges, mainly due to the lack of reliable fabrication methods that enable the formation of Al nanostructures with a low degree of aggregation and size-controllable and large-scale production.24 Nano-arrayed Al nanostructures with controllable plasmonic effects may effectively avoid the aggregation of Al NPs, which relies on lithography fabrication techniques, such as electron-beam lithography (EBL),25,30,37,38 extreme ultraviolet (EUV) interference lithography,39 and nanoimprint lithography.35 Most of the aforementioned Al nano-array structures require complex and expensive fabrication processes, which prevent their practical application in devices. In addition, to effectively apply Al NP arrays in light-harvesting systems, the morphology, size and surface chemical properties, etc. should be taken into account, which depend largely on the fabrication method. To the best of our knowledge, experimental studies regarding Al NP arrays for performance enhancement in OPVs have not been reported yet.
Here, we present a non-lithographic route via a novel self-assembly nanoparticle template method to prepare well-dispersed and disk-like Al nanoparticle arrays, with tunable sizes in the nanoscale, on TiO2 thin films, here referred to as “Al nanodisk arrays”. Moreover, this fabrication method provides large-scale samples with high reproducibility, which favors their application in OPVs and other types of energy conversion systems. As a preliminary application in OPVs, the PCEs of devices utilizing Al nanodisk arrays are improved from 7.28% to 8.04% for the poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]]:phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM) active layer and from 3.30% to 4.08% for the poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) active layer, when compared to the reference devices without Al nanodisk arrays. The preliminary results suggest that the Al nanodisk array is a promising plasmonic system for improving the OPV performance. Since the plasmonic spectra of the Al nanodisk arrays can be easily tuned by adjusting their geometry, size and dielectric environment, they could be easily extended to other types of photovoltaic devices, such as inorganic and hybrid solar cells, and many other large-area and mainstream plasmon-enhanced light-harvesting applications.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
PC61BM (99.5% purity) and PC71BM (99.5% purity) were purchased from Solenne BV. PTB7 and P3HT were purchased from One-Material Inc. Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, Mw = 99k) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the chemical reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification. All devices were prepared on ITO-coated glass (10–15 Ω sq−1) substrates, which were cleaned sequentially by ultrasonication in a 2% Micro-90 detergent in water, then Milli-Q water, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min each, and then dried under nitrogen flow, followed by oxygen plasma treatment (200 W, 1 min) immediately prior to the deposition of the TiO2 film.
2.2 Preparation of TiO2 dense films
A sol–gel TiO2 precursor solution (0.5 mol L−1) was prepared by dissolving titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in n-butanol under vigorous stirring for 1 h at room temperature, to yield a homogeneous, clear and transparent sol, using a magnetic stirrer. Then the TiO2 precursor solution was dropped onto the ITO glass substrates, which were then spun at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The wet films were immediately baked at 350 °C for 30 min in air to convert the titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) precursor to TiO2.
2.3 Al nanodisk array fabrication
Al nanodisk arrays sitting on ITO/TiO2 substrates were fabricated utilizing a novel self-assembly nanoparticle template method.
The fabrication route included the following main processes: the synthesis and self-assembly of Au NPs on TiO2 thin films, preparation of the PMMA pattern, Al layer deposition and subsequent lift-off processes. Au NPs were synthesized using procedures described previously.40 Prior to the assembly of Au NPs, ITO/TiO2 substrates underwent a surface modification treatment, which was modified from the surface modification method described previously.41,42 Briefly, the samples underwent an oxygen (O2) plasmon treatment and were subsequently immersed into an ethanol solution of MPTES (6 vol%) and an aqueous solution of H2O2 (30 vol%) for 12 h and 3 h, respectively, and were finally rinsed in DI water. After that, the Au NPs were assembled onto the TiO2 surface by immersing the ITO/TiO2 substrates into the Au NP aqueous solution and holding for 8 h (Fig. 1a). The detailed fabrication processes of Al nanodisk arrays are presented in the ESI.†

2.4 FDTD calculation
The extinction spectra of Al nanodisk arrays were theoretically calculated using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The details of FDTD calculations are described in the ESI.†
2.5 Device fabrication
For the P3HT:PC61BM blend system, 20 mg ml−1 P3HT and 20 mg ml−1 PC61BM were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution. For the PTB7:PC71BM solution, PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5 wt%, 25 mg ml−1) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene (CB):1,8-diiodooxtane (DIO) (97:3 by volume). Both P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC71BM blend solutions were then stirred in a glovebox at 60 °C overnight, and allowed to cool to room temperature, and then filtered through a 0.22 μm filter prior to use. Thereafter, for the preparation of the P3HT:PC61BM active layer, an ≈200 nm film was obtained by spin-coating the P3HT:PC61BM blend solution at 700 rpm for 30 s. The wet films were then slowly dried in a covered glass Petri dish for solvent annealing and subsequently baked at 120 °C for 10 min in the glovebox to help the self-organization of P3HT, as well as driving away the residual solvent. For the preparation of the PTB7:PC71BM active layer, an ≈100 nm film was obtained by spin coating the PTB7:PC71BM blend solution at 1000 rpm for 1 min, and then the wet films were slowly dried inside a vacuum chamber with a dynamic vacuum for 2 h. Finally, an 8 nm thick molybdenum oxide (MoO3, 99.99%) buffer layer and a 100 nm thick silver (Ag, 99.99%) electrode layer were deposited onto the active layers under a vacuum of 8 × 10−5 Pa for both P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC71BM devices. The size of the solar cells prepared on ITO substrates was ∼2.4 cm2 and the effective device area was defined to be 0.0666 cm2 by using a shadow mask. To ensure consistent results, the devices based on Al nanodisk arrays and reference devices with pristine TiO2 films were simultaneously fabricated in the same batch for the spin-coating of the active layers and the deposition of the MoO3 buffer layer and the Ag electrode.
2.6 Al nanodisk arrays and device characterization
The micro-morphologies of samples were measured by Zeiss Supra 55 field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and element mapping were also obtained by a Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension Icon, Bruker) measurements were performed under ambient conditions and operated in the tapping mode. The PF-KPFM (Dimension Icon, Bruker) measurements were performed under ambient conditions with MESP-RC probes. Dark-field scattering spectra of Al nanodisk arrays were measured using a dark field scattering microscope (Princeton Instruments OLYMPUS BX51). UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR Spectrophotometer. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured in air using a Newport 91160 solar simulator (300 W) at 100 mW cm−2 under air mass (AM) 1.5 G, and a Keithley 2612 source measurement unit. A silicon solar cell certificated by the NREL was used as reference to calibrate the measurement condition.
An external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was performed in air utilizing a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System (QE-R3011, Enli Technology Co. Ltd) under lamp light passing through a monochromator, which was calibrated by a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of Al nanodisk arrays
In this work, a novel self-assembly nanoparticle template method was developed to fabricate well-dispersed Al nanodisk arrays on ITO/TiO2 substrates without any assistance of specialized lithographic facilities. Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the fabrication process of Al nanodisk arrays. Briefly, the fabrication of Al nanodisk arrays started with the preparation of the PMMA pattern, with a size-adjustable hole structure. To obtain the PMMA pattern, firstly, Au NPs with diameters of around 90–120 nm were synthesized and assembled on the TiO2 substrate (Fig. 1a). Secondly, to fabricate a replica of the assembled Au NPs, a PMMA layer was then spin-coated onto the Au NPs (Fig. 1b). Thirdly, the PMMA layer was partly etched using O2 plasmon at 200 watts power for 4 min for etching out around half the thickness of the PMMA layer to expose part of the Au NPs (Fig. 1c). Fourthly, after the removal of the Au NPs by immersing the samples into a KI solution for a quick rinse, the PMMA pattern with a hole array structure was achieved on the TiO2 surface (ITO/TiO2/PMMA pattern) (Fig. 1d). The size and density of the hole array structure in the PMMA pattern could be controlled by adjusting the size and density of the assembled Au NPs on the TiO2 substrate. By depositing an Al layer on the PMMA pattern using a vacuum thermal evaporation method (Fig. 1e) and performing a lift-off process (Fig. 1f), well-dispersed and disk-like Al nanodisk arrays could be obtained. It should be noted that, in order to favor the lift-off process, the thickness of the Al layer should be controlled. The more detailed fabrication process and experimental parameters are available in the ESI.†

Fig. 2a shows an SEM image of the TiO2 film, revealing a dense and very smooth surface. The SEM images of Al nanodisk arrays, as presented in Fig. 2b and c, reveal that the Al nanodisks have an average diameter of around 130 nm. The top and cross-sectional AFM profiles, shown in Fig. 2d, illustrate that the height of an Al nanodisk is around 25–30 nm. To examine the structure and composition of the nanodisk, the TEM image and the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental maps of a representative Al nanodisk scraped from a TiO2/Al nanodisk array substrate were recorded (Fig. 2e). As shown in Fig. 2e, the distribution of the Al signal is almost the same as the shape of the nanodisk, and the O signal is distributed uniformly over the nanodisk. It has been demonstrated that, for Al NPs, a thin (∼2–4 nm) and homogenous oxide surface layer will be formed on an Al NP surface very quickly after its exposure to air and the process is self-limiting, with the formed passivating oxide layer of Al2O3 inhibiting further oxidation.26,27,29–31 Thus, the distribution of the O signal suggests that a thin oxide layer of Al2O3 was formed on the surface of the Al nanodisk. By considering the experimental data and the results in previous reports,26,27,29–31 we suggest that the Al2O3 passivation thin layer could enable the stability of Al nanodisks in OPVs, and thus the effects of the degradation of the Al nanodisk on the device performance can be negligible in this work. However, for the long-life practical applications of OPVs, further studies are required to investigate the effects of the potential degradation of Al particles on the long-term device stability under harsh conditions.

By adjusting the diameters of the assembled Au NPs, Al nanodisk arrays with 90 nm, 100 nm and 130 nm disk diameters could be obtained (Fig. S1, ESI†). It has been demonstrated that the plasmonic resonance bands of small NPs with diameters less than 100 nm are located in the UV or near-UV region,25,38,43 and are mismatched with the absorption bands of the active layers (the P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC71BM blend systems). It has been demonstrated that Al NP plasmon resonance has a strong dependence on particle size and shape with a strong redshift and the emergence of broad features with increasing particle size, which enables a stable LSPR wavelength in the visible range.25,38,39 Therefore, an Al nanodisk with a 130 nm diameter was selected to enhance the photovoltaic performance of OPVs, because of its LSPR spectral band position, according to the reported data in the scientific literature, located in the range of 400–500 nm,25,35,38,39 which overlaps with the absorption band of the active layer.
In Fig. 2f (solid line), the experimental dark-field scattering spectrum of Al nanodisk arrays shows that the peak occurs at ∼470 nm, which is within the range of previously reported plasmon resonance data for Al nanoparticle arrays with similar sizes in the literature.25,35,38,39,44 To obtain deeper insight into the observed plasmon spectrum, we calculated the extinction spectrum (Fig. 2f, dotted line) of Al nanodisk arrays by utilizing the finite-difference tome-domain (FDTD) method. Details of the calculation are described in the ESI.† It can be found that the experimental dark-field scattering spectrum matches well with the calculated spectrum. It should be noted that the optical properties and LSPR peak position of physically deposited Al are sensitive to the deposition rate and the base pressure of the deposition chamber.39,45
3.2 Photovoltaic performance of the device with Al nanodisk arrays
Based on the TiO2/Al nanodisk arrays, inverted OPVs with a device structure of glass/ITO/TiO2/Al nanodisk arrays/BHJ active layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 3a) were fabricated and characterized. Two well-studied BHJ systems, P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC71BM blends, were used to fabricate inverted OPVs and demonstrate the effect of Al nanodisk arrays on the performance of the inverted devices. For the inverted OPVs fabricated with TiO2/Al nanodisk arrays, the TiO2 dense film and the Al nanodisk arrays act as a cathode buffer layer (CBL) and a light harvester, respectively. It is worth pointing out that prior to the spin-coating of the active layer, Al nanodisk arrays do not need to be coated with an additional insulating layer to prevent charge recombination on the Al surface. This is because a thin 2–4 nm oxide layer will almost instantaneously be formed on the Al surface after its exposure to air,26,29–31 which can serve as a native protective layer to eliminate the concern of exciton quenching by avoiding direct contact between Al cores and the active layer.
 Fig. 3  (a) A schematic device structure of inverted OPVs with TiO2/Al nanodisk arrays. (b) The respective current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for P3HT and PTB7-based devices with and without Al nanodisk arrays. 

Fig. 3b shows the respective current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for both P3HT and PTB7-based devices with and without Al nanodisk arrays. The key averaged parameters of the OPVs are summarized in Table 1. It is shown that the utilization of Al nanodisk arrays in OPVs results in an enhancement of short-circuit current (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) for both active layers. The average PCE of the P3HT:PC61BM-based device was improved by 24%, from 3.30% to 4.08% and the champion device shows a JSC of 12.02 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.60 V, a FF of 62.9% and an efficiency of 4.32%. For the highly efficient PTB7:PC71BM blend, the PCE was enhanced by approximately 10%, from 7.28% to 8.04% and the highest PCE was 8.48%. The relatively lower enhancement in the case of the PTB7:PC71BM blend compared to the P3HT:PC61BM active layer may be due to the fact that the PTB7:PC71BM active layer has a higher extinction coefficient and thus a better light absorption ability. In order to investigate the enhanced performance of OPVs by Al nanodisk arrays, we performed an optical and electrical investigation of the P3HT:PC61BM-based devices with and without Al nanodisk arrays. The reason for choosing the P3HT:PC61BM blend system is that it is the most studied and best characterized active material for BHJ devices, with the advantage of being highly reproducible.46 For P3HT:PC61BM devices based on TiO2/Al nanodisk arrays, the PCE enhancement results from a combined increase of JSC, VOC and FF, as compared to those of the control devices with pristine TiO2 films. For BHJ OPVs, the active layer morphology is an important parameter for device performance. Thus, as an initial investigation, the effects of Al nanodisk arrays on the morphological properties of the P3HT:PC61BM active layer were examined using AFM. According to the AFM images (shown in Fig. S2, ESI†), the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of P3HT:PC61BM films deposited on TiO2 and TiO2/Al nanodisk arrays is 7.26 nm and 7.09 nm, respectively. The ignorable difference of the RMS roughness suggests that the Al nanodisk embedded in the active layer has a negligible influence on their morphologies.

In order to illustrate the origin of the enhanced JSC, the UV-Vis absorption spectra of P3HT:PC61BM active layers with and without Al nanodisk arrays were also recorded (Fig. 4a). As shown in Fig. 4a, the absorption of the active layer incorporated with Al nanodisk arrays is enhanced in the wavelength region of 400–600 nm, when compared to the active layer deposited on the pristine TiO2 layer. The enhanced absorption band matches well with the plasmonic resonance spectrum of Al nanodisk arrays as shown in Fig. 2f. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of devices with and without Al nanodisk arrays was measured and the results are presented in Fig. 4b. From Fig. 4b, it can be seen that the typical EQE of the device based on Al nanodisk arrays increased over a broad wavelength range from ∼350 nm to ∼650 nm compared to that of the reference device.

(b) EQE spectra of the representative reference device and the Al nanodisk array-enhanced device with the P3HT:PC61BM active layer. (c) Photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) characteristics of the reference device and the device with Al nanodisk arrays. 
The EQE spectra of the PTB7:PC71BM devices with and without Al nanodisk arrays, which also show an enhancement in the device incorporated with Al nanodisk arrays, are shown in Fig. S3, ESI,†. On the basis of the EQE and light absorption results, we suggest that the plasmonic resonance of Al nanodisk arrays resulted in the enhancement in light-harvesting of the active layer as well as the photocurrent. To further confirm that the JSC enhancement results from enhanced light-harvesting in the active layer, the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) of both the reference device and the Al nanodisk array device using P3HT:PC61BM active layers was also determined. Fig. 4c presents a plot of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) on a double-logarithmic scale for the reference and the Al nanodisk array devices.
Here, the Jph is determined as Jph = Jlight − Jdark, where Jlight and Jdark are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively.47,48 The Veff is determined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at the point where Jph is equal to zero (Jlight = Jdark), and Va is the applied bias voltage.47,48 It is clear that Jph linearly increased with the voltage at a low Veff value (<0.1 V) and then tended to saturate at a sufficiently high Veff value (>1 V) for both the reference device and the Al nanodisk device. The saturated Jph at large reverse bias (Veff > 1 V) is the saturation current density (Jsat), which is only limited by the total amount of absorbed incident photons and independent of the bias and temperature.47 From Fig. 4c, it can be seen that the Jph were saturated for both types of device, with a Jsat of ∼102 A m−2 and ∼118 A m−2 for the reference device and the Al nanodisk array device, respectively. In addition, assuming that the photo-generated excitons in the solar cells totally dissociated into free charge carriers and contributed to the current at the high Veff region, the Gmax could be calculated using the equation: Jsat = qGmaxL,47,49 where q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer (200 nm). Then the Gmax calculated for the reference device and the Al nanodisk array device is 3.19 × 1027 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 102 A m−2) and 3.69 × 1027 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 118 A m−2), respectively. As the Gmax value is governed only by the maximum number of absorbed incident photons,47,49 a noticeable enhancement in Jsat and Gmax suggests enhanced light absorption and exciton generation in the active layer incorporated with Al nanodisk arrays. By considering the experimental data and the calculated extinction spectrum, we suggest that the enhancement in light absorption of the active layer plasmonic is due to the incorporation of Al nanodisk arrays. On one hand, the near-field surface plasmonic resonance of Al nanodisk arrays coupled to the photoactive layer increases its effective absorption cross-section and thus exciton generation and dissociation. One the other hand, Al disks can also act as light scattering centers to scatter incident light into a distribution of angles, causing an increase in the optical path length, thereby increasing the light absorption in the active layer.
To examine the influence of Al nanodisk arrays on the charge recombination process, the values of JSC of both the reference device and the Al nanodisk device at various illumination intensities were measured. Fig. 5 shows the nearly linear dependence of JSC on light intensity (Plight). For OPVs, the value of JSC follows a power-law dependence with respect to light intensity (Plight) (i.e., JSC ∝ Plight).48–50 The exponential factors (S) determined from Fig. 5 for both the reference device and the Al nanodisk array device are 1.028 and 1.044, respectively. The linear (S = ∼1.0) dependence of JSC on Plight suggests that the bimolecular recombination in either of these devices can be neglected.48–50 Therefore, it can be assumed that the incorporation of Al nanodisk arrays into the active layer in OPVs has negligible influence on the charge recombination and charge transport processes in the device. In addition to JSC and FF, the VOC in the device with Al nanodisk arrays has also been enhanced from 0.57 V to 0.60 V for the P3HT:PC61BM-based device as compared to the reference device based on a pristine TiO2 layer, which may be due to the change in the electrical properties at the interface between the active layer and the TiO2 electron-collecting layer caused by the appearance of Al nanodisk arrays. To explore the original possibility of the VOC enhancement, the work-functions of TiO2 and TiO2/Al nanodisk arrays were calculated from the samples’ average surface potential (SP) (Fig. 6d–f).

The measured average surface potential of ITO, TiO2 and TiO2/Al nanodisk arrays are −650 mV, −280 mV and 70 mV, respectively. (g) The energy levels of the materials used in OPVs. 
The SPs were measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM, Dimension Icon, Bruker) under ambient conditions and using a highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG, with a surface potential of −200 mV and work function of −4.5 eV) as the reference sample. The work function of the pristine TiO2 layer calculated from the SP is −4.55 eV, while in the presence of the Al nanodisk arrays, the work function reduces to −4.23 eV. A schematic diagram of the energy levels of the materials used in our device is shown in Fig. 6g. Similar to previous reports, wherein thin Al layers are evaporated onto metal oxides films, such as TiOx, ZnO and ITO layers, a reduction in the surface work-function is expected following Al oxidation.51–53 The lower surface work-function of the cathode buffer layer in inverted OPVs is expected to increase the built-in potential and improve the electron extraction properties of the cathode, and result in enhanced VOC in solar cells.51,53 Thus, the improved VOC from 0.57 V up to 0.60 V can be ascribed to the approximately 0.32 eV decrement in work-function between pristine TiO2 and TiO2/Al nanodisk arrays, which results in better energy level alignment (Fig. 6g) and may potentially form preferable Ohmic contact with PC61BM to enhance the built-in potential and improve charge collection in the device. All these results indicate that Al nanodisk arrays, without requiring an additional insulating layer, can be applied to improve the performance of OPVs. The development of a simpler method to fabricate large-scale Al nanodisk arrays, with adjustable size and gap, through polystyrene (PS) masks for application in light harvesting systems, such as solar cells and water splitting, is under way. In addition to light harvesting systems, surface plasmonic resonance effects of metallic nanostructures are of particular interest for optoelectronic devices, such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) or transistors.54–57 Therefore, the Al nanodisk arrays fabricated in this work may have great potential to be employed to boost the performance of OLEDs due to their advantages in supporting tunable and strong surface plasmon resonances in a wide spectral range, from ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR), as well as their earth abundance and thus low-cost.
Conclusions
In this study, a novel self-assembly template method was developed to prepare well-dispersed and disk-like Al nanoparticle arrays. The Al nanodisk arrays on TiO2 dense films were employed as a plasmonic nanostructure, for the first time, to enhance the performance of inverted OPVs. The improvement in the PCE of the devices is presented for two widely used BHJ systems of P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC71BM. The average PCE of the P3HT:PC61BM device was enhanced from 3.30% to 4.08% by utilizing the Al nanodisk arrays in the active layer, demonstrating the plasmonic device with an efficiency higher than 20%. Similarly, the Al nanodisk arrays led to an increase in the average PCE of PTB7:PC71BM devices from 7.28% to 8.04%. For the P3HT:PC61BM-based device, the PCE enhancement results from the increase of JSC, VOC and FF, as compared to those of the control devices with bare TiO2 dense films. The enhanced JSC is due to the enhanced light absorption of the active layer caused by the incorporated plasmonic resonance of Al nanodisk arrays. The improved VOC can be ascribed to the decreased surface work-function of TiO2/Al nanodisk arrays, which results in better energy level alignment and may potentially form preferable Ohmic contact with PC61BM to enhance the built-in potential and improve charge collection in the device. The preliminary results suggest that the Al nanoparticle array is a promising plasmonic system for photovoltaic performance enhancement in OPVs. In addition, devices based on Al nanodisk arrays with tuned plasmonic spectra, achieved by adjusting the size and density of disks for better photovoltaic performance, are under investigation. Moreover, our novel self-assembly template method could be easily extended to other types of metallic array nanostructures which are difficult to prepare using wet chemical synthesis.
