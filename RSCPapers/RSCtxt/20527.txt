    , Accepted 31st October 2014First published on 31st October 2014AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are an emerging photovoltaic technology with both low costs and good efficiency. However, the cathode used in most DSSCs is fluorine-doped tin oxide glass coated with a Pt film, which is both expensive and brittle and therefore limits the flexibility and large-scale implementation of this promising technology. We report here work which showed that flexible, seamlessly covalently bonded, three-dimensional vertically aligned few-walled carbon nanotubes (VAFWCNTs)/graphene on metal foil can act as a novel cathode free from transparent conducting oxide and Pt for application in DSSCs. This cathode has a lower charge transfer resistance and lower contact resistance between the catalyst and the substrate than the conventional combination in a brittle Pt/fluorine-doped tin oxide cathode. The covalently bonded graphene and VAFWCNTs ensure excellent electron transport through the electrode and the large surface area of the hybrid carbon materials rivals the catalytic capability of the Pt analogue. DSSCs utilizing this flexible VAFWCNTs/graphene hybrid cathode outperformed the Pt-based cells in both rigid (8.2% vs. 6.4%) and flexible (3.9% vs. 3.4%) assemblies. The VAFWCNTs/graphene on metal foil combination is a novel, inexpensive, high-performance, flexible cathode for application in solar cells.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are low cost, semi-transparent, easy to manufacture1–6 and are used as an indoor light resource for photovoltaic conversion. A typical DSSC consists of one photo-electrode made of semiconductive TiO2 with a dye molecule, a Pt cathode and an iodine/triiodide-based electrolyte between the electrodes. Under illumination, light is absorbed by the dye molecule attached to the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles in the anode. The excited dye molecule then injects electrons into the TiO2 conduction band, where the photocurrent ultimately forms. The electrons generated are transported through the disordered network of the TiO2 nanoparticles via diffusion. A redox shuttle (such as the I−/I3− system) in organic solution is then used to regenerate the dye and carry the charge to the cathode, where the oxidized form of the redox shuttle is reduced to complete the circuit.
The most common catalyst on the cathode is Pt nanoparticles, which show a high catalytic behaviour with the I−/I3− redox system.7,8 However, Pt is expensive and makes the production of DSSCs a high-cost process. Much research has been carried out on replacement materials for the Pt catalyst, particularly carbon-based materials as a result of their abundance, low cost, environmentally benign properties and reasonable catalytic effects.9–13 Carbon black,11,14 graphene,15–17 graphite,12,18,19 nanofibres13 and nanohorns9 have been reported as alternative cathodes for use in DSSCs. As a result of their large specific surface area (SSA) and high electrical conductivity,9,20–24 there has been extensive research on carbon nanotube (CNT)-based cathodes. Multi-walled CNTs9,20,25–27 and single-walled CNTs21–24,28–30 have been tested in DSSCs. The resulting random spaghetti-like nanotube film has a limited active surface area as a result of bundling and the electron mobility is largely dominated by the contact resistance. Vertically aligned CNTs (VACNTs), which have a much higher active surface area than spaghetti-like CNT films, are a better choice for carbon-based DSSC cathode materials.31 However, VACNTs are typically prepared on oxide substrates. To integrate the VACNTs into the DSSC device, they need to be transferred to suitable conductive substrates, such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass or indium tin oxide–poly(ethylene naphthalate) (ITO–PEN). Both wet21–24 and dry32 transfer processes have been reported. However, wet processes do not preserve the vertically aligned morphology of the CNTs, reducing their surface area and conductivity, and the dry transfer technique suffers from contact problems between the carbon carpet and the conductive substrate. In both instances, the catalytic effectiveness of the carbon electrode is lower than that of the Pt-based electrode. CNTs9,20–24,29,30 and graphene12,15–19,33–37 have been used as alternative cathodes; however, most reported work has been on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates, i.e. FTO glass. Two major concerns of these cathodes come from the weak adhesion between the catalyst and the substrate and thus the high contact resistance at the cathode/electrolyte interface,21,22,24,28,30,35–37 as well as the high cost of the TCO substrate.
We report here a novel TCO- and Pt-free hybrid material with covalently bonded aligned CNTs/graphene to solve these two issues. A seamlessly covalently bonded, three-dimensional vertically aligned few-walled CNT (VAFWCNT)/graphene hybrid material38 was constructed and applied as a novel flexible cathode for application in DSSCs. This configuration of the hybrid material provides an SSA >2000 m2 g−1 and an ohmic contact through the covalently bonded graphene and vertically aligned CNTs and the metal base.38 The entire hybrid material can be prepared on a thin Ni foil substrate, which is then used directly for the DSSC electrode without any transfer steps. As a result, the electron transfer at the cathode/electrolyte interface is an order of magnitude faster than that of the reference Pt cathode and the fabricated DSSCs out-perform the reference Pt-based cells. More importantly, this configuration eliminates the need to use a brittle FTO or ITO–PEN for the electrode substrate, providing a low-cost, flexible, highly efficient cathode for application in DSSCs.
2. Results and discussion
Fabrication and characterization of the hybrid cathode electrodes
The VAFWCNTs/graphene cathode was synthesized as reported previously.38Fig. 1a is a schematic diagram of the VAFWCNTs/graphene electrode and an image of the actual electrode with VAFWCNTs/graphene on top of the Ni substrate. The CNTs grown in this work are few-walled (the number of walls is typically between 1 and 3). The graphene film on the Ni substrate is usually less than three layers thick. Fig. 1b shows a schematic image of the DSSC. The left-hand part of Fig. 1b is the cathode based on VAFWCNTs/graphene and the right-hand part is the photo-electrode with TiO2 and the dye molecules.

The rings highlighted in red represent the seven-membered rings that seamlessly fuse the planar graphene and tubular CNTs. However, the CNTs are tens of microns long, whereas the graphene is <1 nm thick. The inset is an image of the VAFWCNTs/graphene (black circle) on the Ni foil cathode. The diameter of the black circle is 6 mm. (b) Schematic diagram of the DSSC with VAFWCNTs/graphene on Ni foil as the cathode. 

Fig. 2a shows a top view of the edge of the CNT forest standing on a graphene-covered Ni substrate. The SEM image of the section of the VAFWCNTs (Fig. 2b) indicates the tip-growth mechanism.39 Instead of forming an aligned structure over the entire surface, the CNTs are only aligned within every section, which may benefit the electrolyte wetting in the DSSC devices. The graphene layer has been shown to be crucial for preventing catalyst aggregation during growth, leading to a higher growth rate of the VAFWCNTs on the metal substrate.38Fig. 2c and d show that the graphene and CNTs form a fused structure after growth. Typical CNT Raman spectra based on different CNT growth times are plotted in Fig. 3a. The G/D ratios vary in the range 4.3–8.0 where the tubes are less defective or have less amorphous carbon with increased times of growth. The strong radial breathing mode signals between 100 and 300 cm−1 indicate that the diameters of the tubes are all small, which corroborates well with the TEM observations. The graphene grown on Ni foil was evaluated by Raman spectroscopy mapping. A typical graphene spectrum is plotted in Fig. 3b and the G/D ratio of a 25 × 25 μm sample is plotted in Fig. 3c. The high G/D ratio implies that the graphene films synthesized in this work are of reasonable quality.

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
Semi-rigid DSSCs using flexible VAFWCNTs/graphene cathodes and photo-anodes based on standard FTO glass were fabricated as described in the Experimental section. Iodine salt-based electrolytes were used. For comparison, a standard Pt cathode with 20 nm Pt sputtered onto an FTO glass substrate was used to fabricate the control group DSSCs. As the photo-anode used here was based on rigid FTO glass, the samples in the control group were fully rigid and the DSSCs with the carbon hybrid materials were semi-rigid. We systematically investigated the performance of the novel DSSCs made from VAFWCNTs/graphene with various lengths of CNT. Table 1 shows that the thickness of the VAFWCNT layer was 20–25, 75–92 and 100–150 μm for 4, 30 and 60 min of CNT growth, respectively. The G/D ratio increased slightly from 4.3 to 6.2 and then 8.0 with the increase in growth time. For longer exposures, the top of the forest experienced selective etching of the defective CNTs, as is evidenced by the increasing G/D ratio with growth time.

Fig. 4a shows the characteristic J–V performance for DSSCs with carbon hybrid material cathodes. Based on the results in Table 1 and Fig. 4, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the DSSCs with VAFWCNTs/graphene varied over a small range of 0.69–0.73 V, similar to the value of the Pt control group cells (0.72 V). The values of Voc did not follow a clear trend with increasing length of VAFWCNTs. The fill factor of the carbon DSSCs is between 65 and 68%, which is slightly higher than that of traditional DSSCs (64%). It is clear from Table 1 and Fig. 4a that the major improvement provided by the novel cathode is the increased short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc). The Jsc value of the new cells reached 14.33, 16.02 and 17.83 mA cm−2 with the different VAFWCNT lengths, compared with 13.86 mA cm−2 in traditional Pt-based DSSCs. This increase leads to an up to 20% enhancement of the power conversion efficiencies, which are 7.1–8.2% for the new VAFWCNTs/graphene cells and only 6.8% for the standard Pt control group. The DSSCs with the highest efficiency are those fabricated with the VAFWCNTs/graphene with the longest growth time (the corresponding length of the CNTs was 100–150 μm). This indicates that the higher surface area of the cathode is preferred during the cathode redox reactions of the novel electrode.

Fig. 4b shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the DSSCs fabricated with CNTs/graphene/Ni or Pt cathodes. The IPCE corresponds to the number of electrons collected as a photocurrent in the external circuit divided by the monochromatic photon flux that strikes the cell, also referred to as the external quantum efficiency.40 The IPCE can be expressed as:IPCE (λ) = LHE (λ)ϕηwhere LHE (λ)is the light-harvesting efficiency at a given wavelength, ϕ is the injection of electrons and η is the charge collection efficiency. The IPCE exceeds 80% in the wavelength range near 530 nm for N719.40 We found that the CNTs/G/Ni cathode not only has a higher IPCE response (82%) than the Pt cathodes (67%) near 530 nm, but also shows a higher value over the whole wavelength region. It has previously been thought that the construction of the photo-electrode and the dye molecule will have a more significant effect on the overall IPCE because the photo-electrode determines η directly. However, our result shows that the cathode also affects the IPCE, but probably via a different route, i.e. an electron–hole (TiO2/electrolyte) recombination process, which competes with the electron collection process. As a result, if the oxidized species in the electrolyte can be rapidly and effectively captured at the cathode/electrolyte interface, the recombination process can be significantly reduced and the overall IPCE increases. In our device, the carbon hybrid structure provides a much larger surface area than the traditional Pt-based electrode and therefore more reaction sites are created and provide a fast route for electrolyte capture and reaction. We speculate that the recombination process is avoided and the overall IPCE increases.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to further investigate electron transport at the cathode surface (Fig. 4c). By fitting with the transmission line equivalent circuit shown in the bottom right of Fig. 4c, the series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rpt) of the cathode could be estimated. The Rs of the VAFWCNTs/graphene on the Ni foil cathode was 23 Ω and the Rs of the Pt cathode was 24.5 Ω. However the Rpt of the new cathode was 0.91 Ω for the semi-rigid DSSC. These values are more than 20 times lower than those of the DSSC with a Pt cathode (about 19.6 Ω). As the graphene and VAFWCNT layers were grown in situ on the Ni foil, this hybrid structure avoids any transfer process recognized to be detrimental to interfacial electron transfer.39 This result shows the superior electrocatalytic activity of the hybrid carbon system, which is a combined result of the high SSA and the ohmic contact through the covalently bonded graphene and the VACNTs.
The electrocatalytic activity of CNTs/graphene on Ni foil electrode was compared with the Pt electrode using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a three-electrode system. The typical CV curves for both the CNTs/graphene on Ni foil and the Pt cathodes represent reactions indicative of the I−/I3− complex redox peaks. The cathodic peak current density (Ipc) indicates a catalytic activity towards I3− reduction of the CNTs/Ni foil electrode comparable with that of the Pt electrode. As a reference, CV of the Ni foil was also performed under identical conditions. No electrocatalytic activity of Ni foil was observed, as evidenced by the absence of the pair of I−/I3− redox peaks. The significant increase in the current density at potentials more anodic than 0.48 V vs. Ag/AgCl for CNTs/graphene on Ni foil is attributed to the oxidation of Ni foil as seen using CV.
An obvious advantage of the CNTs/graphene/Ni cathode is its flexibility. Flexible DSSCs on a conducting plastic substrate have attracted considerable attention as a result of their unique characteristics such as portability and low weight.41 The standard flexible cathode is prepared by sputtering Pt on ITO–PEN. However, ITO, the most widely used conductive layer in DSSCs, is very brittle. As a result of the easy propagation of cracks, ITO–PEN in flexible DSSCs can only survive for a few bending cycles; current ITO-based flexible DSSCs cannot even be bent a few times.42 The CNTs/G/Ni electrode is therefore preferred for flexible DSSCs, which can then be bent, folded and fitted to curved surfaces. As a demonstration, flexible DSSCs devices were fabricated using an ITO–PEN anode and the flexible CNTs/G/Ni cathode. A control group of DSSCs was fabricated with a 20 nm Pt-coated ITO–PEN substrate as the cathode for comparison. Fig. 5 and Table 2 show that the flexible DSSC with CNTs/G/Ni as the cathode achieved a PCE of 3.9% with a FF of 0.60, which rivalled standard flexible DSSCs (PCE 3.4%, FF 0.59). The Jsc of the flexible DSSC with CNTs/G/Ni was 9.23 mA cm−2 with a Voc of 0.71 V, whereas the Jsc of DSSCs with Pt was 7.94 mA cm−2 with a Voc of 0.72 V. The FF of the DSSC with CNTs/G/Ni was slightly higher than that of the traditional DSSC with Pt as the cathode. The better performance of the flexible DSSCs with CNTs/G/Ni is attributed to the lower Rpt properties provided by the novel materials. All these trends show the same consistency as those discussed for semi-rigid DSSCs. The bendability of this new cathode may contribute to the development of the next generation of flexible DSSCs on arbitrary surfaces, while maintaining their performance and long-term durability.

3. Experimental details
Preparation of hybrid cathode
The cathode materials were prepared based on a modification of a previously published procedure.38 The Ni foil (0.025 mm, annealed, 99.5%, Alfa Aesar) was cut into 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm squares. Graphene was grown on the Ni surface using a chemical vapour deposition method.18 A shadow mask (with circles 1 cm in diameter) was used to evaporate 1 nm Fe and 3 nm aluminium oxide on the graphene-covered Ni substrate. The Fe was evaporated first and then the aluminium oxide. The sample was charged in a low-pressure chemical vapour deposition system and VACNTs were grown from the graphene surface using acetylene at 2 sccm. The obtained sample was used directly for device fabrication without further treatment.
Preparation of semi-rigid DSSCs
The FTO glass (Pilkington FTO glass Tec 15 Glass, 2.2 mm thickness) was cleaned sequentially in deionized water and 200 proof ethanol in an ultrasonic bath. A 12 μm thick diffusion TiO2 layer (DSL 18NR-T, Dyesol) and 8 μm thick scattering layer (WER4-O, Dyesol) were screen-printed onto the FTO glass. Each layer was dried at 125 °C for 6 min after printing. The photo-electrode was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in air. The sintered photo-electrode was then immersed in the N719 ([RuL2(NCS)2]:2TBA; L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, TBA = tetra-n-butylammonium, B2 N719, Dyesol) solution (3 × 10−4 mol L−1) for 24 h at room temperature. The photo-electrode and cathode were packaged with the sealant (1170 Series, 60 μm, Solaronix) twice at 125 °C for 7 s. The electrolyte solution, with a composition of 0.05 M I2, 1.0 M 1-propyl-3-methyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.5 M N-methylbenzimidazole and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in 2-methoxyproprionitrile as the solvent, was injected into the cell and it was sealed using additional sealant (1170 Series, 60 μm, Solaronix).
Preparation of the flexible DSSC
A 8 μm thick film of TiO2 (about 21 nm particle size, Sigma-Aldrich) was screen-printed onto the clean ITO–PEN. The photo-electrodes were sintered at 150 °C for 30 min in air. The other procedures were similar to those used for the DSSC with a semi-rigid substrate.
Measurements
The efficiency of the DSSCs was tested using an Oriel 94041A Solar Simulator calibrated with a reference silicon cell (calibrated at NREL) under standard test conditions (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) at 25 °C. The active area of the DSSC was 14–16 mm2 (Table 1).
EIS measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 650C) in the frequency range 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. Fig. 4 shows the corresponding Nyquist spectra of the DSSCs with a VAFWCNTs/graphene on Ni foil cathode and with conventional sputtered Pt as the reference cathode.
4. Conclusion
A novel seamless three-dimensional CNTs/graphene/Ni scaffold was used as a TCO- and Pt-free cathode in DSSCs. The graphene and VAFWCNT layers were grown in situ on the Ni foil, avoiding any of the transfer processes that are recognized to be detrimental to interfacial electron transfer.38 DSSC devices with 100–150 μm length VAFWCNTs achieved the highest PCE of 8.2%, which is significantly higher than that of the rigid reference cells with a sputtered Pt cathode (ca. 6.4%). The EIS analysis showed that the Rpt of the new cathode was only 0.91 Ω for the semi-rigid DSSC, more than 20 times lower than that of the DSSC with Pt (19.6 Ω), which leads to a much faster electron transfer rate at the cathode/electrolyte interface. In addition, the flexibility of this new CNTs/graphene/Ni electrode enables the fabrication of truly flexible DSSC devices. Flexible DSSCs with the new cathode show a PCE of 3.9%, outperforming that of 3.4% for the DSSC with a Pt cathode. This superior electrocatalytic activity may originate from the combination of the high SSA of the hybrid electrode and the seamless electrical connection between the VAFWCNTs and the graphene layer. These experimental results show that the CNTs/G/Ni electrode may be an ideal cost-effective, high-performance and flexible alternative cathode for DSSCs.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the fabricated DSSCs. (a) Schematic structure of the VAFWCNTs/graphene. The rings highlighted in red represent the seven-membered rings that seamlessly fuse the planar graphene and tubular CNTs. However, the CNTs are tens of microns long, whereas the graphene is <1 nm thick. The inset is an image of the VAFWCNTs/graphene (black circle) on the Ni foil cathode. The diameter of the black circle is 6 mm. (b) Schematic diagram of the DSSC with VAFWCNTs/graphene on Ni foil as the cathode.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM and TEM characterization of the cathode materials. (a) Top view SEM image of the VAFWCNTs/graphene on Ni foil, scale bar = 50 μm. (b) Side view SEM image of the VAFWCNTs/graphene on Ni foil with high magnification, scale bar = 2 μm. (c) TEM image showing that the CNT forest is connected to the graphene film. The metal substrate was removed by etching and the CNTs/graphene material was transferred onto the TEM grid. The aberration-corrected TEM image showing the CNT–graphene seamless junction has been published previously.38 Scale bar = 100 nm. (d) High-resolution TEM image showing that the graphene is few-layered and the CNTs materials are one- to three-walled, scale bar = 10 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  Raman spectra of the cathode materials. (a) Typical Raman spectra of the synthesized VAFWCNTs. The times indicated in the legend are the CNT CVD growth times of different samples: Raman laser wavelength = 633 nm. (b) Typical Raman spectrum of graphene obtained in this work: Raman laser wavelength = 514 nm. (c) The G/D ratio map from Raman spectroscopy mapping on graphene-covered nickel foil: mapping area = 25 × 25 μm, Raman laser wavelength = 514 nm.

(a) Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of DSSCs using CNTs/G/Ni or Pt cathodes under 1 Sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). Times in the legend are the growth times of the VAFWCNTs corresponding to the lengths 20–25 μm (4 min), 75–92 μm (30 min) and 100–150 μm (60 min). (b) IPCE spectra for the DSSCs fabricated with VAFWCNTs/G/Ni or Pt cathodes with the ruthenium dye N-719. IPCE plotted as a function of the excitation wavelength. (c) Nyquist plots of DSSCs. Frequency range 100 mHz to 1 MHz and amplitude of alternating current 10 mV in the impedance measurements. Upper inset is the EIS result from 22 to 32 Ω, clearly reflecting the first semi-circle of the DSSC with CNTs/G/Ni. Lower inset shows the equivalent circuit used in the fitting process of the CNTs/G/Ni. (d) CV results of cathodes.
