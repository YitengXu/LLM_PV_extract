    , Accepted 9th January 2021First published on 15th January 2021AbstractPhotocatalytic reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons is considered to be a promising strategy to solve the energy crisis and environmental problems. Herein, the electronic and optical properties, and catalytic performance of g-C3N4 derivatives [C6N7(C6H4)1.5]n (systems 1 and 2), and [C6N7(C12H8)1.5]n (system 3) were studied by density functional theory (DFT) computations. Compared to g-C3N4 the band gaps of systems 1–3 are smaller, and the absorption intensities of the three derivatives in the visible light region increase, indicating that these derivatives can produce more electrons under visible light irradiation and enhance the photocatalytic performance. The computational results show that the main products of CO2 reduction catalyzed by system 1 are HCOOH and CH3OH. The rate-determining step is CO2 → COOH* with a ΔG of 1.22 eV. Therefore, system 1 is predicted to be a promising catalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction.
1. Introduction
The rising level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has caused severe global warming and environmental pollution.1–4 The carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) uses solar energy to give high-value fuels and chemicals, such as carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), methanol (CH3OH), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), and ethanol (CH3H2OH), which not only plays a pivotal role in renewable energy conversion technologies, but also contributes to mitigating CO2 emissions.5–12
Graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a fascinating conjugated polymer has attracted broad interdisciplinary attention in solar energy conversion and environmental remediation due to its moderate band gap (2.7 eV), appealing electronic band structure, nontoxicity, good physicochemical stability, low cost and easy preparation.13–17 However, the catalytic efficiency of pristine g-C3N4 is still limited due to its low quantum efficiency for visible light, fast charge recombination, deficient light harvesting ability and insufficient electrical conductivity.18 Therefore, several modification approaches including structure optimizations, elemental doping and semiconductor compositing have been carried out to improve the catalytic performance of g-C3N4.19,20 The electrocatalytic performance of nickel/cobalt/iron doped g-C3N4 was enhanced. Ni-C3N4, Co-C3N4, and Fe-C3N4 are more selective for the CO2RR than the HER. The analyses of the CO2RR pathways and limiting potentials indicate that Co-C3N4 shows higher CO2RR activity and better selectivity for CH3OH production compared with Ni-C3N4 and Fe-C3N4.21 The photocatalytic property of sulphur–oxygen co-doped g-C3N4 shows that the sulphur–oxygen co-doping could modulate the band structure of pristine g-C3N4.22 A Z-scheme heterojunction constructed from Bi7O9I3 and g-C3N4 has improved the photocatalytic degradation ability of pollutants and the recycling ability.23 Kroke et al. reported that some binary carbon nitride derivatives can be “graphitized” carbon(IV) nitrides containing C and N atoms and a few other elements, which are considered to be based on the C3N3 unit or C6N7 unit.24 Kroke indicated that the g-C3N4 structure based on the C6N7 motif is more stable than that of the C3N3 motif by 30 kJ mol−1.25–27 In our previous work, carbon nitrides (C6N7)n, [C6N7(C2)1.5]n, [C6N7(C4)1.5]n, [C6N7(C3N3)]n and [C6N7(N2)1.5]n containing C6N7 units were studied by first principles calculations, showing that the band gaps of those carbon nitride derivatives are smaller than that of g-C3N4, and the designed carbon nitride derivatives evidently extend the optical absorption of g-C3N4 and enhance the photocatalytic efficiency.28
Herein, inspired by the promising catalytic activity of g-C3N4 derivatives towards CO2 reduction, the catalytic performance for the CO2RR of three novel g-C3N4 derivatives was investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Systems 1–3 were constructed by para- and meta-position of benzene and biphenyl linking with s-heptazine units in g-C3N4. The possible reaction paths for CO2 reduction by system 1 were investigated, showing that the photocatalytic activity of system 1 is higher than that of g-C3N4. The purpose of this work is to find an effective way to modify g-C3N4 for improving the conductive and photocatalytic properties of g-C3N4.
2. Calculation method
The geometry optimizations of the studied systems were performed with the DMol3 code.29,30 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used.31,32 The unit cell (1 × 1) was repeated periodically on the x–y plane, and a vacuum region of 20 Å was applied along the z-direction, which is enough to avoid spurious interactions between repeating slabs. Based on the optimized structures, the band structures, density of states (DOS), partial density of states (PDOS) and absorption spectra of the systems were studied with the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)33,34 hybrid functional. The norm conserving pseudopotential was selected and a K-point mesh of 3 × 3 × 1 was used. A cut off energy of 300 eV and a Monkhorst–Pack k-mesh of 5 × 5 × 1 were used. The convergence in energy, force, and displacement was set as 1 × 10−5 Ha, 0.002 Ha Å−1 and 0.005 Å, respectively.
The adsorption energy (Eads)35 was defined as Eads = EA–S − ES − EA, where EA–S, ES, and EA are the total energies of the adsorbate–substrate (A–S) complex, the substrate (S), and the absorbate (A), respectively.36 According to this equation, a negative Eads indicates exothermic adsorption. The free energy change (ΔG) of each elementary reaction step on these systems was calculated according to the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model suggested by Nørskov et al.37,38 In this method, the free energy change is defined as ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE – TΔS + ΔGpH + ΔGU, where ΔE is the change in reaction energy directly obtained from DFT total energies, ΔEZPE is the change in zero-point energy, T is the temperature (298.15 K), and ΔS is the change in entropy. ΔGU = −neU, where n is the number of transferred electrons and U is the electrode potential. ΔGpH is the correction of the H+ free energy by the concentration, ΔGpH = kBT × ln10 × pH, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and the value of the pH was set to be zero for acidic conditions.39 Zero-point energies and entropies of the CO2RR intermediates were computed from the vibrational frequencies. The vibrational modes of the adsorbates were computed explicitly, while the catalyst sheet was fixed (assuming that the vibrations of the substrate were negligible).
3. Results and discussion
Geometric structures and stabilities
The structures of systems 1–3 were optimized and are shown in Fig. 1. The C6N7 units of systems 1 and 2 are connected via benzene and the C6N7 units in system 3 are connected via biphenyl. The C1 atom coordinates with three N atoms, and C2 connects with the benzene or biphenyl. The C3 and C4 atoms are from the benzene. N1 atoms are 2-fold coordinated with two C atoms, and N2 atoms are 3-fold coordinated by three C atoms. The optimized cell parameters of the three systems are a = b = 19.12 Å (system 1), a = b = 16.59 Å (system 2), and a = b = 26.69 Å (system 3). The stability is one of the criteria for a good catalyst. A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at 500 K was performed to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of system 1, in which the time step was set at 1.0 fs for a total period of 10 ps. We find that no significant geometrical distortion was observed for this system 1 (Fig. 2), suggesting its high thermodynamic stability. In order to further evaluate the stability of system 1, we computed the cohesive energy per atom (Ecoh), which is determined by using the following equation: Ecoh = [(Etot − aEC − bEN − cEH)]/(a + b + c), where Etot, EC, EN, and EH denote the total energy of [C6N7(C6H4)1.5]n, and the energy of isolated C, S, and H atoms, respectively, while a, b, and c represent the number of C, N, and H atoms. According to this definition, the computed Ecoh value of system 1 was −5.99 eV, indicating its high stability. Our results show the good stability and feasibility for experimental synthesis of this system 1.

Electronic structure
The band structures and DOS of all systems calculated by HSE06 are shown in Fig. 3. The band gaps of systems 1–3 were computed to be 2.57, 2.29, and 1.91 eV, respectively, which are smaller than that of g-C3N4 (2.7 eV).17 Therefore, introduction of benzene and biphenyl groups as connecting bridges in systems 1–3 is helpful to reduce the band gaps and increase the conductivity. In addition, the PDOSs of C and N atoms in all systems were calculated and are displayed in Fig. 4. The PDOS of g-C3N4 shows that the VB is mainly dominated by N atoms, and the CB is mainly contributed by C atoms and small amounts of the CB are from N atoms.17 For systems 1–3, the VBs are mainly dominated by C and N atoms, with small amounts from H atoms, while the CBs are mainly contributed by C and N atoms. From the PDOS of g-C3N4 it can be seen that the Fermi level adjoins the VB.17 For systems 1–3, the energy bands of the benzene and biphenyl groups effectively insert into the energy bands of g-C3N4, resulting in the reduced band gaps. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) and the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the studied systems are presented in Fig. 5. The LUMO of g-C3N4 mainly distributes on C atoms and moderately consists of N atoms, and the HOMO localizes on all N atoms, which is in accordance with the PDOS.17 In other words, for g-C3N4 no electrons would be excited from bridging N atoms under light irradiation, and the photogenerated electrons neither migrate to bridging N atoms nor transfer from one heptazine (C6N7) unit to the adjacent unit through bridging N atoms. It means that the excited e−/h+ in g-C3N4 are limited in each heptazine unit, so g-C3N4 has weak photocatalytic efficiency.17 For system 1, the HOMO mainly locates on N1 atoms, while the LUMO mainly locates on C1, C2, C3, N1 and N2 atoms, and slightly locates on C4 atoms. The results are consistent with the PDOS analysis that the C and N atoms are involved in the CB, and the excited e−/h+ locate on the neighboring C and N atoms. For system 2, the HOMO is mainly contributed by N1 atoms, and the LUMO mainly consists of C1, C2, and C4 atoms. The HOMO of system 3 mostly locates on C3 and C4 atoms, while the LUMO mostly locates on C1 and C2 atoms. In other words, in system 3, no electrons would be excited from bridging N atoms under light irradiation, and the photogenerated electrons neither migrate to bridging N atoms nor transfer from one heptazine (C6N7) unit to the adjacent unit through bridging N atoms. It means that the excited e−/h+ pairs are limited in per triazine unit, so system 2 has weak photocatalytic efficiency. System 1 will have better ability to separate the photogenerated e−/h+ pairs and enhance the photocatalytic efficiency.

Optical properties
In order to evaluate the photocatalytic efficiency of the systems, the absorption spectra of systems 1–3 were simulated and are plotted in Fig. 6. For g-C3N4 there is a strong absorption peak near 350 nm and the wavelength of the optical absorption edge (λedge) is near 475 nm,17 indicating that g-C3N4 has a certain visible-light response range. For the studied systems, the strong absorption peak is near 380 nm for system 1, 290 nm for system 2 and 430 nm for system 3. The wavelength of the optical absorption edge (λedge) is near 660, 430, and 780 nm for system 1, 2 and 3. Compared to g-C3N4, the optical absorption edges of systems 1 and 3 red-shift by 180 and 305 nm. The results clearly show that the optical properties of system 1 and 3 as photocatalysts are superior to those of system 2, predicting that more electrons of system 1 and 3 could be generated upon visible light irradiation.

CO2 reduction reaction on system 1
For the CO2RR, the initial step is CO2 → COOH*; the ΔG values for CO2 hydrogenation to COOH* on systems 1–3 were computed to be 1.22, 1.66, and 1.58 eV, respectively. It proposes that system 1 among the studied systems is more advantageous for the CO2RR. In the following, the detailed mechanism for the CO2RR catalyzed by system 1 is investigated. All possible reaction paths were considered and are shown in Scheme 1. The ΔG values of all reaction intermediates in Scheme 1 were calculated, and the structures corresponding to the optimal reaction path are shown in Fig. 7.

 Fig. 7  Calculated structures corresponding to the optimal reaction path followed by CO2 conversion on system 1. Selected distances are shown in angstroms. Chemisorbed (bound) species are indicated by full bonds, whereas physisorbed species are indicated by dashed bonds. 
Azofra et al.38 proposed that the reaction path for CO2 reduction catalyzed by g-C3N4 is as follows: CO2 → COOH* → CO → HCO* → HCHO → CH3O* → CH3OH. According to this reaction path, the shortest distances between the intermediates (CO2, COOH*, CO, HCOOH, and CH3OH) and system 1 are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 8. For COOH* adsorption, the CA–NS bond distance is 1.51 Å, while the OA–CS distance for HCOOH adsorption is 2.94 Å, and the OA–CS distance between CH3OH and the substrate is 2.90 Å, where A and S are the absorbate and substrate, respectively. Eads of CH3OH is −0.36 eV, suggesting that CH3OH easily desorbs from system 1. Eads of HCOOH is −0.50 eV, suggesting that HCOOH can desorb from the catalyst.

 Fig. 8  Calculated free energy diagram corresponding to the optimal reaction path followed by the CO2 conversion on system 1. 
For the CO2RR, the first step is CO2 hydrogenation to form COOH* or HCOO* intermediates, which are crucial to the entire reaction pathway. As shown in Fig. 8, ΔG for CO2 hydrogenation to COOH* on system 1 is 1.22 eV, which is smaller than that of HCOO* formation, suggesting that COOH* formation is thermodynamically more favorable. It is found that COOH* on system 1 prefers to adsorb on the N site and the CA–NS bond distance is 1.51 Å, where A and S are the absorbate and substrate, respectively.
Once COOH* is obtained, it can be reduced to the CO and HCOOH intermediates through the formation of O–H and C–H bonds, respectively. The ΔG values for CO and HCOOH formation are −0.37 eV and −0.76 eV, respectively, indicating that both CO and HCOOH can form. In general, the Eads values of adsorbates are all larger than 1 eV, corresponding to strong chemisorption.32,33 The adsorption energy (Eads) of CO and HCOOH is −0.10 and −0.50 eV, respectively, suggesting that CO and HCOOH can desorb from the catalyst. Besides, the weakly adsorbed CO on the CN material surface also possibly undergoes further hydrogenation.17,40,41 Hence, CO and HCOOH hydrogenation on system 1 were considered (Fig. 8). ΔG for CO and HCOOH hydrogenation to HCO* is 0.64 and 1.03 eV, respectively. It is found that CO hydrogenation is thermodynamically more favourable. ΔG of the rate-determining step (CO2 →COOH*) is 1.22 eV, suggesting that CH3OH formation on system 1 is feasible. So HCOOH is the main product through the two-electron CO2RR process. CH3OH is the product of the six-electron CO2RR process. The optimal path for HCOOH formation is CO2 → COOH* → HCOOH. For the CH3OH product, the optimal path is CO2 → COOH* → CO → HCO* → HCHO → CH2OH* → CH3OH. The ΔG of the rate-determining step (CO2 →COOH*) for system 1 is 1.22 eV and lower than g-C3N4 (ΔG = 1.43 eV)40 and comparable to S-doped g–C3N4.17 It suggests that system 1 is a promising catalyst for the CO2RR.
Side reaction analyses
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is competitive with CO2 reduction, which affects the faradaic efficiency of the CO2RR in a low pH region.40 Therefore, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also of great concern because of its significant effect on the photocatalytic efficiency.42,43 The HER on all possible sites was considered. In Fig. 9, we can see that the ΔG values of the HER on the N atom which is 2-fold coordinated with two C atoms in the C6N7-unit and the C atom are 1.78 eV and 2.84 eV, respectively, indicating that it is hard for the HER to occur, so the influence of the HER can be ignored.

4. Conclusions
In summary, this work represents a comprehensive study of the CO2RR on system 1 based on DFT calculations. The band gap, DOS, PDOS, and absorption spectra were investigated by using DFT calculations. The band gap of system 1 is smaller than that of g-C3N4, predicting that the adsorption spectrum of system 1 red-shifts compared to pristine g-C3N4. The HOMO of system 1 mainly locates on N atoms except the N atoms between the three C atoms, whereas the LUMO mainly locates on the C and N atoms. The result suggests that system 1 as a photocatalyst is favorable to promote charge separation, inhibit electron–hole recombination, and prolong the lifetime of charge carriers, thus enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency in comparison with g-C3N4. The photoexcited electrons and holes gathering in different semiconductor surfaces efficiently prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated carriers and enhance the photocatalytic ability. For system 1, the optimal path is CO2 → COOH* → HCOOH and CO2 → COOH* → CO → HCO* → HCHO → CH2OH* → CH3OH. ΔG of the rate-determining step (CO2 → COOH*) is 1.22 eV. ΔG of the rate-determining step on system 1 is lower than that of g-C3N4 indicating that system 1 is a highly efficient photocatalyst. The present findings could shed light on the design of efficient photocatalysts and provide important information for photocatalytic CO2 reduction fuel production.
