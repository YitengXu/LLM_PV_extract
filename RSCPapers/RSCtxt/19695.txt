    , Accepted 20th February 2023First published on 20th February 2023AbstractStructural defects at the surface and within the bulk of perovskite films hinder efficient energy conversion in solar cells due to the loss of charge carriers through non-radiative recombination. Post-passivation approaches have been proposed in an attempt to eliminate surface defects, with bulk defects being rarely studied. Moreover, it is of interest to investigate the difference in the perovskite crystal growth with and without simultaneous defect passivation. Here, we study a new crystal growth strategy to realize high-quality triple-cation perovskite crystals via utilizing microwave irradiation combined with a continuous supply of defect passivators from a reservoir solution of trioctyl-n-phosphine oxide (TOPO). The proposed method facilitates the growth of perovskite crystals with TOPO ligand coordination in the whole film region. Consequently, the processed perovskite film demonstrates distinctive features of significantly suppressed non-radiative recombination, substantial defect reduction and morphological changes compared to the perovskites processed by conventional thermal annealing. The power conversion efficiency is enhanced owing to the improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc). The results of this study are expected to assist in the development of diverse approaches for the control of perovskite crystal growth with in situ defect passivation toward high efficiency in solar cells.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskites are considered among the most promising solar energy conversion materials owing to their exceptional optoelectronic characteristics such as a high mobility of charge carriers, a low binding energy of excitons, high light absorption coefficients, and band-gap tunability.1–4 Perovskites can be further developed up to the Shockley-Queisser limit in solar cells, with more precise control of the production of defects that cause an efficiency loss because defects result in the creation of trap states that induce non-radiative recombination.5–8 Consequently, non-radiative recombination leads to a charge carrier loss, which narrows the quasi-Fermi-level splitting and thus limits the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Structural defects inevitably exist, in particular, for solution-processed synthesis from perovskite precursors, because of the failure of residuals to participate in perovskite crystallization.9–11 In addition, due to the polycrystalline nature of perovskites, perovskite films possess considerable defects at the grain boundaries as evidenced by weak local photoluminescence (PL).12,13
A wide range of Lewis bases have been used for defect passivation to suppress non-radiative recombination.14–17 Lewis bases such as phenylalkylamine,18 thiophene,19 and pyridine20 can passivate the dangling bond of under coordinated Pb2+ ions by pushing lone pair electrons to interact with positively charged ions, which neutralizes the positive charges in Pb2+ ions.21,22 Organophosphorus compounds including trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), tributylphosphine oxide (TBPO), and triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) have a tetrahedral structure with three organic functional groups at the three vertices in a plane and an oxygen atom at the fourth vertex. Such types of Lewis bases have been reported to reduce the dangling bond density by establishing Pb–O bonds, which eliminates the ionic defects of Pb2+ ions.23–25 Among them, TOPO exhibits a strong coordination ability of the oxygen atom in the PO group to Pb2+ ions, thereby suppressing non-radiative recombination by a reduction in ionic defects acting as trap sites. Therefore, TOPO has been an appealing defect passivator for enhancing the device performance in photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskites, regardless of the dimensions.26–29
Defect passivation with TOPO is often conducted by spin coating on top of a perovskite film that has already completed its perovskite crystal growth.30–32 This post-treatment method reduces surface defects.33–40 However, bulk defects are unlikely to be passivated because the low diffusivity and the compact film morphology handicap diffusion into the bulk of perovskite films. A few studies have reported the passivation of bulk defects using TOPO via addition into perovskite solutions or dripping a TOPO solution into a perovskite antisolvent during spin coating.24,25 Those additive approches were almost ineffective with respect to perovskite crystallinity and photovoltaic performance. The failure of TOPO in forming better crystalline perovskites despite its coordination with Pb2+ ions remains unresolved. In addition, defect passivation using Lewis bases is generally accompanied by the supply of thermal energy into a perovskite film to achieve crystallization by reaching thermal equilibrium on a hot plate. This is referred to as a conventional thermal annealing (CTA) process. The microwave annealing technique successfully facilitates the synthesis of organic molecules and nanocrystals in a dramatically shortened reaction duration via the direct application of electromagnetic energy to target material systems.41–43 Recently, it has been shown that thin films based on perovskites can be better crystallized with a higher efficiency.44
In this work, we developed crystallization processing techniques by utilizing microwave irradiation into the film immersed in a TOPO solution in chlorobenzene (CB) to grow triple-cation metal halide perovskite crystals in which the defects are passivated. To understand the impact of the microwave conditions, the photovoltaic performances of the devices processed with different microwave powers, irradiation times, and TOPO reservoir solution heating times (hereafter “holding times”) are discussed. In addition, four different devices were fabricated based on the perovskite film prepared only by CTA (CTA device), by CTA followed by spin coating TOPO on top (CTA–TOPO device), only by microwaves in CB (MWA–CB device) and by microwaves with TOPO coordination in CB (MWA–TOPO device), to elucidate the role of microwaves and TOPO for perovskite crystal growth. The microwave-assisted growth of perovskite crystals coordinated by TOPO in the entire region of perovskite films resulted in the prevention of Pb cluster formation, a reduction in trap sites, suppression of non-radiative recombination, and distinctive changes in the grain morphology. Consequently, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the short-circuit current (Jsc) were enhanced, thereby improving the PCE.
Results and discussion
For metal halide perovskites, we processed triple-cation perovskites, Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.87Br0.13)3, to study the crystal growth through microwave irradiation with and without passivators being continuously supplied from a reservoir solution in CB. TOPO was selected to passivate defects in the as-spun perovskite films because a strong coordination of TOPO to Pb2+ ions has been proved to be capable of passivating surface defects in single organic cation-based perovskites such as MAPbI3 films.30,45 Although the perovskites examined in this study have different cations occupying A-sites, it is plausible to assume that TOPO also passivates the defects in the triple cation-based perovskites.
The significance of bulk defects similar to that of surface defects motivated us to make an attempt to passivate defects in the bulk and at the surface. From the concept of a dip-coating deposition process that results in perovskite crystallization by having a PbI2 film being immersed in an organic halide solution in an antisolvent,46 we postulated that TOPO can diffuse into the bulk of the perovskite films to passivate the bulk defects. In addition, we questioned whether or not defect passivation by coordinating the undercoordinated Pb2+ ion leads to distinguishing properties with respect to the morphology and crystallinity in the case that the passivated perovskite grains grow via microwave irradiation. Therefore, we dipped the as-spun triple-cation perovskite film into the TOPO solution and then applied microwaves to facilitate the growth of TOPO-coordinated perovskite crystals. The experimental procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1. We chose chlorobenzene (CB) as a solvent for the reservoir solution because perovskites can withstand dissolution in CB. However, it dissolves organic molecules such as poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA), which is often used as a hole transport layer (HTL) for inverted perovskite solar cells with a high efficiency. Therefore, we employed nickel oxides (NiOx) instead for the HTL in the device.

The photovoltaic performances of perovskite solar cells are dependent on the selection of charge transport layers because of energy level alignment, interfacial recombination, and interfacial crystal qualities.47–50 The PTAA/PFN bilayer has been used as the HTL in the control device with a high efficiency reaching a PCE of over 19%, but NiOx, particularly when solution-processed, typically leads to a lower PCE, ∼15–16%, with a Voc of ∼1 V for the control device.51–55 Moreover, studies using NiOx often focus on the different processing techniques of NiOx films for engineering the interface between perovskites and NiOx to suppress the formation of interfacial defects.56–61 Despite the restriction of the selection on the underlying charge transport layer, we highlight that (1) the microwave annealing in this work required a short processing time, less than 10 min, for perovskite grain growth, which is otherwise longer, ∼30 min, in the case of CTA and (2) we improved the photovoltaic performance by processing the perovskite films following a spin coating step with microwave treatments combined with simultaneous defect passivation. Hence, these results pave the way for diverse new approaches to passivating defects with various reservoir solvents and passivators during crystal growth processed by volumetric heating using microwaves.
Devices with an architecture of ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag were fabricated under four different conditions depending on the annealing methods for perovskite growth with and without TOPO passivation: CTA, MWA–TOPO, MWA–CB, and CTA–TOPO. The statistics of the photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE) are presented in Fig. 2. The average values (10 devices) and parameters of the champion device for each condition are summarized in Table S1.† The CTA and MWA–TOPO devices exhibited hysteresis-free behavior (Fig. S1†). Both the Voc and Jsc values of the MWA–TOPO devices were higher than each of the CTA devices. The Jsc value increased from 20.515 (20.499) mA cm−2 to 21.618 (21.309) mA cm−2, and the Voc value increased from 1.027 (1.024) V to 1.137 (1.139) V, while the FF value was slightly decreased from 0.777 (0.771) to 0.759 (0.749) for the champion device (for average). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the wavelength range of 370–850 nm for the two devices is shown in Fig. S1c.† The PCE of the best device and the average PCE for the MWA–TOPO devices increased from 16.367 to 18.657% and from 16.178 to 18.174%, respectively. In addition, the MWA–TOPO device exhibited a better operational stability than the CTA device (Fig. S1d†).

To realize efficient devices, we washed the MWA–TOPO films with CB by spin coating on top of the perovskite film, because we observed that the film surface was unevenly covered with TOPO as shown in Fig. S2.† As TOPO is electrically insulating,62 its presence with a high molecular density in the device can deteriorate the photovoltaic performance. Indeed, Fig. S2c† shows poor J–V curves both in forward and reverse scans for the unwashed solar cells with a significant hysteresis, which prevented the determination of efficiency.
To clarify which factor is attributed to the photovoltaic enhancement between microwave irradiation and TOPO passivation, we compared the device performances of the MWA–TOPO and MWA–CB devices. The difference in processing methods between the two devices was the presence of TOPO while both the as-spun films were annealed via microwaves. The Jsc value of MWA–CB (19.777 mA cm−2) was lower than that of MWA–TOPO, and the FF value was almost identical, 0.751 for the best MWA–CB device. Furthermore, the Voc (1.118 V) value was lower than that of the MWA–TOPO device. Thus, PCE (16.598%) was reduced when annealed via microwaves without TOPO, implying that defect passivation by TOPO is crucial for photovoltaic enhancement.
Even in comparison with CTA devices, MWA–CB devices exhibited lower Jsc and FF values, which will be discussed in due course with the film properties of perovskites crystallized by the MWA–CB method. In contrast, we found that Voc was significantly enhanced. Our previous work showed that microwave annealing on the as-spun films of nickel nitrates on the ITO layer can suppress the formation of Ni3+, so the interfacial perovskite quality is improved, leading to a higher Voc.59,63 Microwaves produce heat in the ITO layer by the ohmic mechanism. In addition, dielectric heating is generated in the reservoir solution and perovskites by molecular rotation, friction, and collisions between ionic and polar constituents. In the MWA–CB and MWA–TOPO methods, microwaves directly or indirectly affect both the perovskites and NiOx because ITO/NiOx/perovskite samples are dipped in a solution for microwave annealing. Therefore, it must be clarified whether the Voc enhancement originates from the perovskite crystals or NiOx. To answer this, we applied microwaves to NiOx film already annealed by CTA (NiOx–CB), and fabricated devices based on the CTA–perovskite film. The Voc value of the NiOx–CB devices was higher than that of CTA devices but far lower than that of MWA–CB devices (Fig. S3†), indicating that the Voc increase is attributed primarily to the perovskite crystal growth.
The effect of CB surrounding the sample is also of interest to differentiate the MWA–CB and MWA–TOPO methods from other previously reported microwave treatments, given that no defect passivators are supplied.44,64 The photovoltaic devices based on the perovskites annealed by microwaves under a nitrogen atmosphere (MWA–N2) were compared with the MWA–CB devices in Fig. S4,† with the statistics for the photovoltaic parameters and the J–V characteristics of the best devices. The perovskite films processed by MWA–N2 had a foggy surface (the inset of Fig. S4e†). All the parameters for the MWA–N2 devices are shown to be lower than those of the MWA–CB devices. We attribute this to the excessive heat generated in the ITO layer due to the ohmic mechanism. The intense heat degrades the perovskites beyond the crystallization optimum. In contrast, CB encompassing the sample mitigates the overheating from ITO to perovskites by opening more channels for heat dissipation into the CB medium.
The fact that MWA–CB devices are worse than the MWA–TOPO ones with respect to the PCE brings up the question of whether microwave irradiation is necessary and TOPO passivation alone is sufficient for efficiency enhancement. To elucidate the role of TOPO with and without supplying microwaves, we compared CTA–TOPO devices to MWA–TOPO devices. Moreover, this comparison can provide evidence that the TOPO in the MWA–TOPO process can diffuse into the bulk of the perovskite films, because the as-spun film wherein perovskite grains needed to be further developed was dipped in the TOPO solution. CTA–TOPO (1.080 V) exhibited a higher Voc than CTA, which suggests that TOPO passivated the surface defects located at the top of the perovskite film. However, CTA–TOPO devices exhibited lower Voc and Jsc values than the MWA–TOPO devices. Based on these observations, we conclude that the TOPO only or microwave only treatments suffer a limitation in terms of enhancing the photovoltaic performance. In fact, their synergetic effects lead to a notable enhancement of the device efficiency. In addition, as expected, the results suggest that dipping in the TOPO solution enables the passivation of both bulk and surface defects.
We investigated the microwave dependence of photovoltaic performances, as shown in Fig. 3. The conditions for the MWA–TOPO devices were optimized by varying the three different processing parameters of microwave power, duration, and holding time. The holding time is the duration for which the solution temperature is preserved by intermittent irradiation with microwaves lower than a few watts. The device performances were found to be sensitively affected by the microwave conditions. With a small difference in microwave power of 6, 7, and 8 W and in duration with 1 min increments from 5 to 8 min, the photovoltaic parameters were dramatically changed. For a short microwave duration (e.g., 5 min), the Jsc and FF values were considerably low. This is attributed to the fact that the films have not yet reached the state where the synthesis process from the precursors is completed for the best crystallinity. However, for a long duration (e.g., 8 min), perovskites begin to decompose, which is detrimental for photovoltaics. These observations indicate that this microwave irradiation technique necessitates precise control for perovskite crystal growth.
 Fig. 3  Average (a) Jsc, (b) Voc, (c) FF, and (d) PCE with different microwave powers and irradiation times. 
The microwave-power dependence can also be observed in Fig. S5,† which shows the photovoltaic statistics of the MWA–TOPO devices processed with different powers for 7 min. The system consisting of CB, TOPO and ITO/NiOx/perovskite produces heat due to microwaves. As a result, the microwave power determines the temperature ramp of the sample (Fig. S5e†). More intense heat generated in ITO and the solution decomposes perovskites quicker. Consequently, the PCE is sharply reduced with increasing power following the turning point for the optimum.
We found that the holding time also sensitively affects the device performance. Fig. S6† shows the photovoltaic parameters with different holding times: no holding, 30 s, and 1 min holding. The Jsc and FF values sharply increased until the holding time increased up to 30 s and decreased afterwards. During the holding time, the perovskite film in the TOPO solution was annealed mostly by the hot solution, but not microwaves. The high sensitivity of microwave duration as discussed above leads to difficulty in determining the precise time required for perovskites to reach the optimum when treated with microwaves alone. However, the heat transfer from the hot reservoir solution with a preserved temperature by intermittently irradiating with microwaves can assist in determining the finely tuned thermal energy required in total to further crystallize perovskites for the optimum. Moreover, a substantial increase in the Jsc and FF values from no hold to 30 s holding suggests that temperature holding provides additional time for TOPO in a hot solution to penetrate deeper into the bulk of perovskites without the immense heat generated by microwaves.
As the last conditions to be determined for optimization, we investigated the TOPO solution concentration dependence (Fig. S7†). All the parameters increased together with increasing TOPO concentration from 2 to 3 mg mL−1 and decreased with 4 mg mL−1. The diffusivity of TOPO should depend on the TOPO concentration. With a low concentration, TOPO molecules cannot diffuse into the entire region of the perovskite film down to the bottom. Therefore, a reasonably high concentration is required for the effective passivation of bulk defects. However, if the TOPO concentration is excessively high, unnecessary excess TOPO may exist, which causes a low electrical conductivity owing to the electrical insulating properties,62 leading to poor device performance.
The high Jsc and Voc values of the MWA–TOPO devices compared to all the other devices imply that the perovskite crystal growth is most effectively facilitated owing to the adequate combination of microwave irradiation and TOPO coordination. The photovoltaic enhancement should be a consequence of suppressed non-radiative recombination via a reduction in the defect sites within the perovskite film. We investigated the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) to understand non-radiative recombination in the films (Fig. 4). We found that TOPO passivation not only enhanced the PL intensity and but also red-shifted the PL peak wavelength both for the post-passivation (CTA–TOPO) and for the in situ passivation (MWA–TOPO), but the enhancement and the red shift markedly differed as compared to the PL from the CTA perovskite film. The PL intensity of MWA–TOPO increased more than ∼six-fold and the average PL lifetime increased from 63.30 to 226.05 ns (Table S2†). For CTA–TOPO, only a ∼two-fold PL increase was obtained, and the average PL lifetime increased only to 80.56 ns. The red shift in PL occurred at 10 nm for MWA–TOPO but only at 4 nm for CTA–TOPO.

This similar behavior of the red shift in PL upon TOPO passivation has been reported in previous studies.27,30 Likewise, we attribute the red shift to the strong emission partially from the defect-passivated grain boundaries.30 The notable difference in the PL enhancement and red shift between CTA–TOPO and MWA–TOPO compared to CTA indicates that TOPO more effectively reduces the defect density in the MWA–TOPO process than just spin coating TOPO on top of the perovskite film without further growth afterwards. This supports that both bulk and surface defects are passivated by a continuous supply of TOPO during crystal growth by microwaves.
To ascertain the effect of TOPO passivation combined with microwaves on the suppression of non-radiative recombination, we also investigated the PL characteristics of microwave-annealed perovskite films in chlorobenzene in the absence of TOPO (MWA–CB). The PL intensity of the MWA–CB films was enhanced with a longer lifetime than that of the CTA films, but lower than that of MWA–TOPO with a shorter PL lifetime without shifting the PL peak wavelength. The lack of shift in PL suggests that the grain boundaries are not passivated as observed in TOPO passivation in the processes of CTA–TOPO and MWA–TOPO. The PL enhancement of the MWA–CB films can be explained based upon the elimination of miscellaneous phases that are responsible for trap-assisted recombination.44 The weak PL and short PL lifetime (126.57 ns) for MWA–CB compared to MWA–TOPO indicate that TOPO certainly helps in further suppression of non-radiative recombination.
The space-charge limited current (SCLC) for hole-only devices structured with ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PTAA/MoO3/Au was measured in the dark to quantitively determine the trap density from the trap-filled-limit voltage, VTFL. Investigations with electron-only devices were ruled out because perovskites are crystallized differently depending on the surface properties of the underlying layer such as the surface energy and chemical interactions between them. Fig. 5 shows the dark current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the hole-only devices based on CTA, MWA–TOPO, MWA–CB, and CTA–TOPO perovskites. VTFL was determined considering the voltage value of the interaction point between the two extended lines for the Ohmic region with a slope of 1 and for the trap filling region with a slope greater than 3. The trap density, nt, was then calculated from VTFL using the following equation:65  where ε is the permittivity, q is the elementary charge, and L is the film thickness. The thickness of the perovskite film was ∼450 nm. The dielectric constant was assumed to be 41.66

Based on the calculation from the above equation with the VTFL values of 0.17 and 0.71 V, the trap densities were determined to be 3.81 × 1015 and 1.59 × 1016 cm−3 for MWA–TOPO and CTA, respectively, showing that the trap density was reduced by a factor of ∼4. For CTA–TOPO and MWA–CB, the VTFL values were 0.61 and 0.52 V and the trap densities were 1.37 × 1016 and 1.16 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. The low density of traps in the MWA–CB perovskites is consistent with the high-intensity PL compared to the CTA and CTA–TOPO perovskites. However, although Voc is consistently high for MWA–CB, it does not fully agree with device performances due to the low Jsc and FF values. While the high Voc value can be explained by a wider splitting of quasi-Fermi energy levels owing to the suppression of non-radiative recombination, the Jsc and FF values should also be expected to be high because of the low density of traps. To understand the device performance, the NiOx HTL should not be considered to be the same between the CTA and MWA processes. For CTA or CTA–TOPO, there is no further significant annealing. The samples were mildly annealed at a low temperature of 100 °C after the NiOx crystallization was completed by CTA at 300 °C for 1 h. In contrast, NiOx during the processing of MWA or MWA–TOPO considerably suffered from the intense heat from the ITO layer generated by microwaves following CTA crystallization on a hot plate. Thus, the extra microwave annealing during the process of MWA–CB degrades the NiOx layer, causing a reduction in Jsc and FF values.
MWA–TOPO reduced the trap density compared to MWA–CB, which indicates the necessity of TOPO for better crystallization. The increase (∼0.02 V) in Voc seems too small to be sufficiently explained by such a reduction in the trap density and an enhancement in PL. Another factor limiting Voc is the band offset of the valence band maximum between perovskites and NiOx, which shrinks the quasi-Fermi-level splitting.67,68 Thus, this energy level misalignment limits the further increase in Voc despite the low defect density in the MWA–TOPO film.
In addition, the trap density was found to be ∼3-fold reduced in the MWA–TOPO film compared to the CTA–TOPO film, which clearly shows that the proposed approach for in situ passivation was more powerful than post-passivation. This substantial reduction in the trap density in MWA–TOPO perovskites compared to CTA–TOPO and CTA can be explained by the fact that a sufficient amount of TOPO enables it to diffuse into the inside of the perovskite films, which is consistent with the above-mentioned PL enhancement. Perovskite crystals with better quality were observed also in the absorption spectra (Fig. S8†). We observed that the MWA–TOPO perovskite film exhibited the highest absorbance, indicating that photo-active perovskites were best formed with a low trap density.
The role of TOPO during the process of MWA–TOPO is not only to passivate the bulk defects and surface defects, but also to differentiate the crystal growth owing to the combined effects of microwave irradiation and its simultaneous passivation. Whichever it is, different crystallinities are anticipated depending on the annealing type and the presence of TOPO. Thus, we examined the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the films. Fig. 6 shows the XRD patterns of the CTA, MWA–TOPO, MWA–CB, and CTA–TOPO perovskites. The diffraction peaks of the photoactive phase (α-phase), non-perovskite phase (δ-phase), and PbI2−xBrx in the films were visible at 14.2, 11.7, and 12.8°, respectively.34,69 We note that the diffraction peak corresponding to PbI2−xBrx disappeared for the MWA–TOPO film, indicating that the formation of the Pb clusters known for defect sites was completely suppressed.59 This is attributed to the establishment of a Pb–O bond by the coordination of TOPO to Pb2+ ions both in the bulk and at the surface. In the meantime, CTA–TOPO perovskites still exhibit a diffraction peak for Pb crystallinity, thus supporting our conclusion that TOPO spin coating alone cannot passivate the bulk defects to the extent that MWA–TOPO can.

As the α-phase perovskites contribute to photocurrent generation while the others do not, the relative intensity of the diffraction peak can be used to assess the perovskite crystal quality. Therefore, we calculated the relative intensity using the equation Iα/(Iδ + IPb), where Iα, Iδ, and IPb are the intensities of the diffraction peak corresponding to the α-phase, δ-phase, and PbI2−xBrx, respectively. Based on the calculation results shown in Table S3,† it is evident that MWA–TOPO resulted in the highest crystallinity (11.70) while CTA–TOPO (4.65) and MWA–CB (7.23) exhibited a better crystallinity than CTA (2.85).
Post-passivation can improve the crystallinity by surface defect passivation as assessed by the XRD for the CTA–TOPO perovskite film, but it is not as effective as MWA–TOPO, which is consistent with all the observations discussed above. Before the perovskite growth is completed to form a compact morphology, dipping the film into the solution enables TOPO to passivate defects even in the bulk and not only at the film surface. Importantly, from comparisons of the crystallinity between MWA–CB and MWA–TOPO, we can conclude that the microwaves facilitate the perovskite crystal growth to form better crystalline photo-active α-phase perovskites when small grains in the as-spun film are previously passivated by TOPO through coordination to the Pb2+ ions at grain boundaries.
If TOPO passivation at small perovskite grains participates in the process of perovskite crystal growth, different grain morphologies are expected to be seen, while post-passivation is unlikely to morphologically change the perovskite grains. To support our hypothesis, we investigated the perovskite grain morphologies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 7 shows the top-view SEM images of the perovskite films processed by CTA, MWA–TOPO, MWA–CB, and CTA–TOPO. Low-magnification SEM images are shown in Fig. S9† to exhibit more grains in the films. Bright spots were observed in the CTA film in parts of the grain or the entire region of grains. This is because of metallic Pb formation, which agrees with our results from XRD that indicate the presence of remaining Pb peaks.70 However, the bright spots disappeared for CTA–TOPO, indicating that the Pb defects were passivated by coordination with TOPO.

The three different perovskite films except for the MWA–TOPO film commonly exhibited definite boundaries between polygon-shaped grains with clearly angled edges, which feature is observed in general for three-dimensional perovskite films.71–74 In contrast, for MWA–TOPO, the perovskite grains were found to have round-shaped edges and multiple grains were connected or merged with obscure boundaries between them. It should be noted that the CTA, MWA–CB, and CTA–TOPO perovskites were grown without TOPO coordination or were passivated only after finishing the growth. This observation confirms that TOPO coordinating defects in the small grain affect the crystal growth mechanism as expected. It remains unclear whether such round shapes of grains found for MWA–TOPO benefit the photovoltaic performance. However, it is certain that the grain bonding reduces the area of grain boundaries, which helps to elliminate the defect sites and thus suppress non-radiative recombination, improving the photovoltaic performance.
Conclusions
In summary, we have discussed microwave-facilitated perovskite crystal growth with a continuous diffusion of TOPO deep into perovskite films by investigating the film properties and device performances when processed in different ways. TOPO molecules in a reservoir solution diffuse into the bulk of the film, enabling the passivation of both bulk and surface defects. The growth of perovskite grain with TOPO upon microwave irradiation enhances the perovskite crystallinity, reduces the trap density, and thus suppresses non-radiative recombination, leading to better photovoltaic performances. The perovskite growth has often been considered to be dependent on the previous nucleation stage. However, our results show that even starting with the same as-spun films, the perovskite crystal qualities differ depending on the energy supply (CTA or MWA) and on the defect passivation prior to crystal growth (with and without TOPO). We believe that our approach sheds light on the importance of perovskite crystal growth control, which can be implemented by different mechanisms toward low-defect metal halide perovskites.
Experimental section
Materials
Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.999%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.99%), anhydrous ethylene glycol (99.8%), ethylenediamine (99%), anhydrous N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, 99.8%), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO, 99%), and bathocuproine (BCP, 99.99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999%, Mw = 461 g mol−1) and lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, Mw = 367 g mol−1) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI). Formamidinium iodide (CH(NH2)2I, Mw = 172 g mol−1) and methylammonium bromide (CH3NH3Br, Mw = 112 g mol−1) were purchased from GreatCell Solar. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was purchased from Nano-C.
Perovskite solar cell fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates were sonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each, followed by oxygen plasma treatment for 10 minutes. Nickel oxide precursors were prepared by dissolving nickel nitrate hexahydrate in ethylene glycol with a concentration of 1 M. Then, 66.8 μL of ethylenediamine was mixed with 1 mL of a solution of NiOx precursor and stirred at 70 °C. After the precursor solution was spin-coated on ITO glass substrates, the films were annealed on a hot plate at 300 °C for 1 h. To prepare a perovskite precursor solution, PbI2 (1.1 M), PbBr2 (0.2 M), FAI (1 M) and MABr (0.2 M) were dissolved in a solvent mixture of anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a volume ratio of 4:1. 1.5 M CsI was dissolved in DMSO. The perovskite solution was partially replaced with a CsI solution. The solution filtered with a 0.2 μm PTFE filter was spin-coated on the substrates in a two-step program, 2000 rpm for 5 s and 5000 rpm for 25 s. 90 μL of CB was dripped onto the substrate at 10 s before completing the spin coating. For the CTA process, the dried perovskite film was annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 30 min. The CTA–TOPO perovskite films were fabricated by spin coating 1 mg ml−1 TOPO solution in CB on top of the CTA perovskite film at 6000 rpm for 60 s. The MWA–CB process was performed by heating the as-spun perovskite film immersed in CB at 7 W for 7 min, followed by a 30 s holding time (Monowave 400, Anton Parr). MWA–TOPO perovskites were fabricated with the same procedure for MWA–CB, but with TOPO dissolved in CB. After the microwave treatments, the microwave-processed perovskite films were washed by spin coating CB at 6000 rpm for 30 s to remove the remaining TOPO. Then, 20 mg ml−1 PCBM solution in CB was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s. Subsequently, 5 nm BCP and 100 nm Ag were thermally deposited to complete the device fabrication at ∼10−7 torr.
Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with forward and reverse scanning by employing a Keithely 2401 under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G) using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA solar simulators, Newport) with a xenon lamp. EQE measurements were performed in a wavelength range of 370–850 nm with a home-built set-up using a Cornerstone 130 monochromator (Newport), a calibrated photodiode (Thorlab), and a reference diode to monitor the light intensity. Optical absorption spectra of the perovskite films were recorded using an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer. XRD measurements were performed using an Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku) with Cu–Kα radiation. Steady-state PL spectra and time-resolved PL were recorded using a FS5 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments). The surface morphology of the perovskite films was investigated using a JSM-7610F (JEOL).
